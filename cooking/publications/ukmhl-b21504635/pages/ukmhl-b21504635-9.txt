PREFACE. In ray little book, entitled “ How to Live on Sixpence a-Day,” I said, “ I wish to show that a simple and cheap diet is not only sufficient for the perfect nourishment of the body, but conducive to strength of mind and serenity of soul; that living on sixpence a-day may be made even more delightful to the senses than indulgence in costly and pernicious luxuries, and that a pure and simple diet may be as elegant and deli- cious as it is healthful and invigorating.” I have treated briefly and comprehensively in that work of the elements of human nutrition and the dietetic system which I believe to be most conducive to health, and best fitted to sustain all the powers of man in their highest condition. The sale of this brochure, and the reception it has met with from the press and the public, have been quite beyond my expectations. There came to be, therefore, all the more need of a practical treatise which should enable people to carry out its principles; hence, I have written and compiled the present work. Ought I to apologise for writing and compiling a cook-book? Dr. Kitchener is a precedent, and the great Dr. Johnson would have been had he carried out his good intentions; but there is a better reason than that. Nine-tenths of our diseases arise from bad diet—under eating, over eating, bad eating, and bad drinking. A large proportion of them could be cured, and a still larger prevented, by a proper diet. No branch of hygiene is so important as the choice and preparation of food. A healthy gastronomy must be founded upon a sound physiology, Who, then, so fitted as a physiologist and a physician to write a cook-book ?

15 HOW TO COOK. THE COMPARATIVE VALUE OF VARIOUS KINDS OF FOOD AS NUTRIMENT. Food varies widely in quantity and kinds of nutritious matter. Some are rich in the nitrogenous or flesh-forming elements—caseine, albumen, fibrine, gluten—cheese, eggs, flesh, wheat; others have larger proportions of carboniferous, fat-forming, heat-producing elements—oil or fat, sugar, starch. Nearly all food contains a large proportion of water;—cheese, 3(> to 44 per cent.; eggs, 65 per cent.; wheat bread, 44 per cent.; potatoes, 74 per cent.; turnips, 93 per cent, water. The following table from Dr. Letheby gives the parts in a hundred of the two kinds of nutriment in several common articles of diet. The remainder is water, with a small residue of salts of soda, potash, &c., none exceeding 5 per cent:— Food Substances—Parts in 100.

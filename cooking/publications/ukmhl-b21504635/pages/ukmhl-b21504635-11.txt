HOW TO COOK. GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF COOKERY. The word cookery—latin coquo, to boil, seethe, bake, heat, scorch, dry, ripen,—expresses a great variety of operations. Cookery is generally the application of heat to articles of nutriment, to improve their taste or digestibility. Some modes of preserving food may also be called cookery. Fish, flesh, and fruits dried in the sun, have undergone a kind of cookery. The dry, salt codfish, the smoked, red, or Dutch herrings, dried and smoked beef, and even ham and sausages are often eaten without further preparation. A good cookery book must be based upon two important sciences, Chemistry and Physiology. All food is good just in proportion as it is adapted to the needs of the human system. A knowledge of physiology shows us the kind of food man can best assimilate, and by which he can best be nourished, while chemistry shows us how such food may best be prepared by artificial processes. Good food should be pleasant to the sight, and nicely and tastefully prepared and set upon the table. It should be pleasant to the smell, filling the air with those fragrant odours which “make our mouths water,”—that is, excite the flow of the salivary and gastric juices, which are so important in the process of digestion. It should be pleasant to the taste. This sapidity or savouriness of food keeps up the flow of the digestive juices, prompts to thorough mastication, stimulates the action of the stomach, liver, pancreas, and absorbents. Nature has given us three senses by which we first test and then enjoy our food,—sight, smell, and taste, and these should all be gratified, or, at least, not offended. How beautifully adapted to these senses are those kinds of food ready prepared for man, his original, his natural, most

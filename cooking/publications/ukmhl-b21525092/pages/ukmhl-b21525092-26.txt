i8 et defensio Pulicum ” ; the third “ Vituperium et damnatio Pulicum ” ; the fourth “ Cortum versicale de Flois.” The book ends with an epitaph— Pulchra Pulex teneras penetrat dum membra puellae ; Clamque subit niveum dente premente femur ; Comprimitur digitis, et nigro clauditur Oreo : Sed dedit hoc illi Distichon alma Venus : Mortuus hie jaceo, sed not hie mortuus ; ardens Dum premor albenti pollice, vivo Pulex. There is a delightful frontispiece of ladies hunting for the pulex out of doors, in the kitchen, parlour, bedroom. Diaries and commonplace books sometimes turn up at sales and in catalogues, are often cheap, and are always of interest. My two favourites cost me least. (i) The first is a small note-book labelled “ Pocock’s Dramatic Mems.”, sold in Marylebone Lane for half-a-crown. I bought this because I thought the writer was one of the Bristol family, and on examining the book found I was right. It is a diary kept during the years 1833 and 1834 by Isaac Pocock, the eldest son of Nicholas Pocock, the painter. He was born in 1782, was a pupil of Romney, came into money in 1818, and from that year to his death in 1835 gave himself up to the drama. The diary opens with an account of the proceeds of “ The Ferry and the Mill,” which was played from Oct. 21 to Nov. 11 (except on Sundays and Tuesdays, when “ Miss Kelly appeared in the ‘ Maid and Magpie,’ ”) and for a few times afterwards. He received £16 13s. 4d. for each of the first nine performances, and £5 for each of the next ten, making a total of £200. He received nothing for subsequent perfor- mances. Mr. Bunn was slow in payment, and on Jan. 22, when he brought the amount up to £150, “ talked of a mis- take about terms.” The last £50 was not paid until April. There is little in the diary except references to the drama, dramatic criticisms, and Mr. Bunn ; but all is interesting. t

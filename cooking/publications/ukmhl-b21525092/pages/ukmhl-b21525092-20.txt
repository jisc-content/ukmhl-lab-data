12 are made out of the whale’s real bone, and are of course white. They are all flat with rounded ends, from 13 to 15 inches long,* and about 2 inches wide. They taper much less than the wooden pnes, and two are the same width throughout. The backs are all plain. The first (black) is carved with five different shrubs. The second (black) with two ships, a whale, and the initials S.W. The third with a castle, bridge, and house. At one end are two hearts and “ Love,” at the other a trumpet and ears of corn. The fourth with two ships lying off a native village. The fifth with flowers and foliage, a heart transfixed by arrows, and the initials J.K. The sixth with the figure of a sailor, under which is the word “ arrived.” Above are a ship and a transfixed heart; below a basket of flowers. The seventh with a ship and four boats engaged in whaling. Above is a tomb with two trees ; below a plant in a pot. It has been badly pierced with five holes. The eighth (black) with ships, fish, flowers, and the name “ Mary Pringle.” The ninth with ships and a sailor holding a flag. The last two are from the Bidwell collection. An unusual variety is a broad ivory one, concave from side to side. It is only 9 inches long, and over 3 inches wide. There is a hole in the top, and a row of holes on the lower half of each side. It is not carved. The ivory one which I mentioned above is of much earlier date, and of a far superior workmanship to any of the others. It is sixteen inches long, f-inch wide, tapering slightly at the bottom. It is convex in front, with a ridge in the centre, running almost from top to bottom. There is a row of 23 semi-circles with triangles between carved on each side of the front. At the back are flowers and foliage surrounding three * Those of 15 inches long must have been uncomfortable, but I was once offered a whalebone one, the length of which was 19 inches.

38 A few fire strikers (one of old Russian work in gold), wool- winders, split-rings, paper-weights, theatre passes, tobacco stoppers, nutcrackers, puzzle-boxes, Japanese sword guards exist as the beginnings of collections, never pursued with vigour. Some things I have almost forgotten. Once the rage was for Bristol porcelain, which lasted until I had written a history of the factory as a preface to Mr. Alfred Trapnell’s catalogue, and then all interest seemed suddenly to fade. At another time the walls of the drawing room were covered with toasting- forks, of which a large number were bought from one dealer who killed his goose by offering me a fork with a curiously early date. This brought suspicion on the whole collection, and they were sold at once. I once had Cardinal Wolsey’s hat in my possession, while a subscription was raised to buy it. If I had realized at the time of the sale how much it would have been valued I would have bought and given it to the House, but it was sold and resold at a much higher price before I could get hold of it, and then it seemed too expensive a gift. Some years after I tried to make up for my meanness by presenting a manuscript con- taining a list of Wolsey’s household. There must have been many other things which are quite forgotten, and there are doubtless many more yet to come. One tires of collections but never of collecting.

The present method has led to horrid spectacles, even in the last 50 years; but when capital punishment was inflicted for theft the accidents in carrying it out were so numerous as to hardly receive any public notice. When twenty people were hanged at one time at Tyburn, it was to be expected that such would occur. Even if there was no accident, the cere- mony must have been tedious; and I much admire the man who, weary of waiting, hanged himself in his cart while his fellow sufferers were being prepared. But he created a scandal at the time by his unseemly conduct. Friends were allowed to assist in the execution by pulling the legs of the culprits, and doubtless often made only a pretence of this while in reality they supported the body in the hope of resuscitation as soon as it was in their possession. For the body was handed over to friends on the payment of 15s. 6d. to the hangman. I have in my collection a formal receipt given at a later period when executions took place at Newgate.

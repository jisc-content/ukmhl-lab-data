At one time I collected the different prints of Nelly O’Brien, and later those of Kitty Fisher. I was much in love with these ladies, and one of my deepest regrets was failing to buy a charming letter from Nelly to one of her lovers which came up for sale at Sotheby’s some years ago. I even meditated writing their lives and collected some material, but just at that time some rare editions of Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus fell in my way and revived my old love for them; The Stoics conquered the ladies. I should much like to see the old fashion of engraving the portraits of famous beauties flourish again. Why do not ladies insist on being etched or engraved instead of being photographed ?

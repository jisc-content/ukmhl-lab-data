5 white, pink, dark and light green, dark and turquoise blue. The usual shape is hexagonal, each side being the arc of a circle, but Mr. Trapnell has a circular set which Mr. Stoner, who sold them to him, says is the only specimen he has ever seen. A rare variety is made of salt glaze, the five trays fitting into one another like a supper service, and decorated with the suits of cards. I have only seen one complete set; one of the trays bore the inscription “ a token of regard 1772.” An odd tray from another set had the initials “ W. T.” on it. I have a set made of cardboard lined with silk, and another made of papier mache. The latter form is the most modern, and is fairly common. Small silver trays are sometimes seen which seem just the thing for holding counters, although the trade assert they are all stands for wine funnels, as some certainly are. Those which look most like counter trays are generally of Dublin make. I have two about the year 1800, which I am willing to allow were for funnels, but two others of the years 1729 and 1736 I still hold were for counters. The trade is not always right. Gaming tickets are sometimes found at sales and with coin dealers, made of wood, tortoise-shell, and ivory. They vary in designation from 10 shillings to 100 pounds. I have seen several with the word “ White’s ” on them, and have a guinea token thus marked, but have not come across the name of any other club. Some day I must collect dice boxes. I have two Crom- wellian ones in leather, one of ivory in the shape of a gavel, and another of ivory with a little silver snail as thumb-piece. I have seen domino boxes worth collecting, but I have only one, which is in the shape of a barrel. I have a brass box with 27 medals, which have a scriptural text on each side. They were, perhaps, used for a Sunday game.

14 In spite of the spelling this second specimen is of very su- perior workmanship, both the upper and lower sticks being inlaid with pieces of wood of different colours. On one of these is carved “ Miss I’anson.” There is a box to hold it which has an inlay on the bottom. Besides these wooden ones I have a silver one, two of plaited quills mounted in silver, an iron one with ornaments and the letters M N Z I, one of leather mounted in silver with the initials of the owner R. R. S., and with the silver- smith’s mark. Those of silver, and of quills mounted in silver, are fairly common, those of iron very rare, of leather still rarer. I also have a most beautiful specimen, ten inches long, made of bead work, with flower and chain ornament. It looks far too fragile for use, and must have been made to show to what perfection bead work can be brought. Among miscellaneous domestic things are a reel stand ; an instrument for goffering caps which looks like the model of a guillotine ; a few lace bobbins (window bobbins and specimens with names or mottoes are always interesting) ; two straw-splitters ; a few snuff rasps (I sold the best speci- mens years ago) ; buckles (silver and paste); Chinese nail protectors ; cases with implements ; needle cases ; bodkin cases ; patch boxes (mostly ivory, but I have two of silver, one London of 1799, the other Birmingham of 1796) ; a silver case with London hall-mark of 1799, containing tooth- brush, box, and tongue-scraper ; a box of silver weights, old French. All these form the starting points of collections which I have never found interest or time to undertake.

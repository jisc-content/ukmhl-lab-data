108 III. Foreign Books. MSS. I have a few foreign books, but only three of much interest. They are books on carving. (а) De sectione mensaria. This is a small oblong of 31 pages, A to B in eights, followed by 48 plates. Vicaire (782) states that the copy in the Bibliotheque de 1’Arsenal, which is apparently the only copy he has seen, has no title-page. Neither has mine, and it seems doubtful if there was one. On Ai is the half-title, De sectione mensaria, followed by an address, “ Ad Lectorem,” which begins with the verses :— Si multis quondam placuit sine veste libellus Quidni vestitus, recte placere potest ! Nuda fugit virtus : puro velamine gaudet. Hunc cinctum ergo sua simplicitate cole. The verses are signed “ C. S.” Vicaire says, “ Ouvrage des plus rares et dont les planches sont excessivement curieuses.” The date is about 1600. (б) De cierlycke voorsnydinge aller tapel-gerechten. Amsterdam, 1664.- This is an oblong of 96 pages with an engraved frontis- piece and 32 plates. A to F in eights. Vicaire, 870. % (c) L’art de trancher la viande, & toutes sortes de fruits, nouvellement, a la frangoise. Par Pierre Petit Ecuyer tranchant. The curious thing about this book is that the title and plates are engraved while the text is in MS. According to Vicaire (677) it was probably written in the reign of Louis XIII. Vicaire gives 35 as the number of plates.

log My copy has all of his and 16 others, viz., (i) La piece de boiily, (2) La tete de veau, (3) L’epaule du mouton, (4) L’aloyau, (5, 6) Le pigeon, (7) La moviette, (8) Le bequesigue, (9) L’ortolan, (10) Le merle, (11) Le pluvier dore, (12) La tourterelle, (13) La caille, (14) L’outarde, (15) La mocelle, (16) Le canard domestique. Old MS. cookery books are fairly common. I have only two, one bought because it was in the same lot as two rare printed books, the other on its merits. I have not read the first, but in turning over the pages I came across a receipt called “ A poetical pudding,” which begins : “ Of oats decorticated take two pound, And of new milk enough the same to drown.” There are a few medical receipts, one to cure the bite of a mad dog. “ This Receipt was taken out of Calthrop Church in Lincolnshire, where many in the Town were bitten by a mad Dog, and all that took the Medicine recover’d, but the rest dy’d Mad. The same Receipt is hung up in Bradford Church in Wilts, where its Efficacy hath been approv’d on the like occasion.” The entries seem to range from 1650 to 1700. The second is a vegetarian cookery book, founded largely on Tryon’s books, which have already been noted. It is beauti- fully written, and has an index. The first part is a series of extracts from famous men, such as Sir Matthew Hale and Abraham Cowley, who have written on kindness to animals or on the wickedness of killing them for food. The second part gives receipts for preparing dishes of food, “which do as far exceed those made of Flesh & Fish, as the Light doth Darkness or the Day the Night.”

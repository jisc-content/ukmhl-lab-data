6 CHAPTER III: Old Silver. Just as I was starting in the dangerous pursuit of collecting old silver, I was fortunate enough to come across the learned firm of Pairpoint Brothers, 8oa, Dean Street, Soho. This firm has made modern silver and repaired and sold antique silver for so many years, that if the three brothers agree that a certain piece is genuine, its owner may face the world with- out fear. At the same time he may be sure that he has only paid a reasonable price. I began with useful articles, such as three-pronged forks, milk jugs, trencher salt cellars, pepper pots, and derived much pleasure from finding out their date and maker, with the aid of Cripps, and later, of Mr. C. J. Jackson, who has represented most accurately the shape of the shield, the form of the lion, the small turn of some letters, on all of which the date depends. But I soon learned the joy of forming a series, and began with caddy spoons. I determined to have a London series, and end with 1821. No self-respecting collector could go beyond that year, in the latter half of which the poor leopard not only lost his crown but was transformed into a common cat. It would be a good thing if our present King would insist on a decent leopard with the old crown and restore the sovereignâ€™s head which, first used in 1784, was removed in 1890 on account of the abolition of the duty on silver plate. I did not know how far I should have to go back until an article by Mrs. Head in the Connoisseur for January, 1907, mentioned that the earliest specimen known is 1783. I have that date and now only need 1821, 1819, 1816, 1806, 1793, 1789, 1785, 1784, and of course 1782. I remember the date letters by the lines Capital U is Waterloo. While E begins the Century.

37 “ Absence ne’er parts Two constant hearts. H.D. S.O., 1774;" In addition to the inscriptions many have hearts, doves, portraits, farm-houses, carved on them; I have only one carved by a lady. Two doves and a heart pierced by two arrows have beneath, “ From Mary Mott Forget me not. 1826.” On the reverse are two names, Charles Hudson and H. Wood. A puzzling one has a crown with G.R., 1781, and round it “ Mary Bisard* 12 months Fine, January 22.” On the reverse a crown with G.R.j a heart pierced with two arrows, and the words “ Love True.” Round it “ Samuel Ford, 6 month’s Fine,* 1781.” Many are done by apprentices, who have recorded the date of their being bound, “ Timothy Blake Bound Augt. 7, 1771.” One man has recorded an event which most people pre- fer to forget— “ John Palmer aged 18 years in prison 3 months, 1820.” On many are election cries and trade advertisements, though it is difficult to see how a sufficient number could be carved to make them of any real service. “ Spence’s plan. Small farms and full bellies.” “ Blunt, operator for the teeth and bleeder, Great Wind- mill Street, near Brewer Street, Golden Square.” Some are religious. One has the Crucifixion on it, another the Ten Commandments and the Lord’s Prayer. I forget how many grandfather clocks I once possessed. Many are sold and others went as wedding presents, but there are seven still left. I have also three very fine bracket clocks ; two lantern clocks, one dated 1681, with a side escapement ; two German clocks working on a rack, which only have to be pushed up to keep going ; a table clock and a few others.

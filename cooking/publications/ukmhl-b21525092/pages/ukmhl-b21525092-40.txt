32 Reed. June the 30th, 1767, of the Sheriff of Middlesex, the sum of six pounds ten shillings by the Hand of Mr. George Search in full of all Demands. Thomas Turlis. Â£6 10 o CHAPTER VIII. Religious Objects* Egyptian Antiquities. I have always disliked collecting any articles connected with the Christian religion, and have only two reliquaries, an old Spanish one of gold, with the relic still inside it, and a carved wooden one in a gold mount said to have come from the sack of the Tuileries. Of ancient Hindu gods I once had a large number, having bought many from the first part of the Gennoo-Hodges collec- tion and still more from the second part which was privately sold. But the interest in them has gradually faded till even the names of the deities has been almost forgotten. I have, however, kept 28 lustral spoons and a number of Ganeshas which are supposed to bring good luck. Buddhas I once collected with great vigour, but the names and attributes of the rarer varieties were so hard to remember that I gave up the pursuit in despair. There are still about 100 in my possession. A ju-ju nail from Benin, used for crucifixion, may perhaps be classed as a religious object. I have a few Egyptian gods, and it was from the purchase of these that I was led to collect Egyptian antiquities generally. I have confined myself to small objects, and most of them are of the 18th dynasty, which is dear to me on account of the heresy of one of its kings, Amenhetep IV.

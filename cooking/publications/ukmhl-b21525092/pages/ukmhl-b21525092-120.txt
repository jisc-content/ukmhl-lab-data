112 Fountains Abbey, drawn and etched by J. Buckler and en- graved by R. Reeve (1809). I have tills also in colours. Two views, drawn by R. Dunning and engraved by R. Havell and Son (1819). (1) Fountains Abbey: (2) South-west view. View of an old Bridge near Fountains Abby. Pubd. Jany. 1, 1794? by S; W.- Fores, No 3, Piccadilly, where may be had all Rowlandson’s works. In B M. I have not been able to find a copy. Principal patterns of the Roman floors at Fountain Abbey, near Rippon, Yorksh: Wm. Fowler Winterton, del. et fecit. Publish’d Feby. 1st, 1800, by Wm. Fowler Winterton. In B. M. I have not been able to find a copy. Four views published by the Society of Antiquaries. The monastery of Fountaynes. David King, del. et sculp. Fountains Abbey. Drawn by T. Hearne from a sketch by J. Farrington, engraved by W. Byrne and T. Medland, 1782. This is I think from a book. With the exception of the last named all are separate publica- tions. I have not mentioned any books which merely in- cluded Fountains Abbey as part of their subject or any prints which were not published separately. One or two prints might, however, be mentioned as they are often seen in shops, torn from the books in which they were originally published.

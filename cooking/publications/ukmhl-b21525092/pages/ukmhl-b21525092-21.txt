13 panels. On the top one is a heart with four arrows round it, and the words “ Pas un ne m’attrape ” ; on the middle one a heart with an arrow through it and the words “ Un seul me blesse ” ; on the bottom are two hearts in flames with the inscription “ L’Amour les joint.” There are two holes at the lower end. Knitting needle holders are carved even now in some parts of the country, but the active life of to-day admits of only very plain specimens, and gives no time for the orna- mental sheaths cut by our forefathers. These knitting sticks are much commoner than stay busks, but good specimens are in great request by collectors, and foolish dealers spoil a good many by carving on them fictitious dates. There are articles on them in the Reliquary for July 1903 and April 1904. I have several wooden ones, but only three of much interest. One is quadrangular, with three compartments in it. The two upper compartments have each a small round ball which is cut out of the solid ; the lower compartment has a central carved pillar. There is a slot to fix the stick to the belt. The whole is carved with geometrical ornament. The other two are of the class illustrated in the Reliquary for April 1904, pages 126, 7. The stick of each of these is 5 inches long, f-inch square on section, with a deep vertical slot to fasten to belt. Attached to the stick is a chain, in one case of seven, in the other of eight, links, at the end of which is another stick carved with two projections for carrying balls of worsted. In both cases the whole is carved out of one piece of wood. There is an inscription covered with glass on each of them. On the first is— “ Remember me when this you see And bear me in your mind. Wm; Nelson, Nov; 9th* 1831.” On the second— “ When this you see think on me If many many miles whe distant be.”

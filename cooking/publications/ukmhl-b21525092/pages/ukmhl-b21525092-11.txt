3 The counters were either plain, or inscribed with devices or phrases. “ Keep your temper ” is a common motto. Nelson’s victories are frequently commemorated on them. Ger- man counters often have a different motto on each counter, and also the words simple, double, triple, quadruple. Some- times the counters or the box bear the method of scoring as an aid to memory; this is common on German counters. The counters often bear the numbers i, 2, 3, 4, by which it was made more easy to count from one to ten. At a later date boxes and counters were largely superseded by a dial, with a pointer which was pushed by the hand, or worked by pressing a spring. Patch boxes sometimes have a dial for marking whist on the cover. The prettiest of all the whist boxes are those of mother- of-pearl, which have sliding tops; and contain four mother- of-pearl counters, painted with some card of each of the four suits. I have four specimens of these, one in the shape of a butterfly. Silver boxes are very common, but rarely contain the counters. I have silver boxes containing George III. shillings, George III. three-penny bits, bone counters, but only one containing silver counters, and there are, unfortunately, only two of these. One has an enamelled heart in its centre, the other a diamond. Samuel Pemberton of Birmingham and John Toleken of Cork made many of the silver boxes. I have specimens of these, and also one made by R. B. of London in 1798. Porcelain counters are never in a box, and are usually, if not always, of foreign make. Mr. Stoner, of King Street, St. James’, gave me one set which he thought were Worcester, but they are marked simple, double, triple, quadruple, and are very like another set, clearly foreign, which he has since given me. Besides these I have two sets of Dresden make, marked with the cross-swords, and another set of foreign make. They are either painted with the four suits or with the four kings.

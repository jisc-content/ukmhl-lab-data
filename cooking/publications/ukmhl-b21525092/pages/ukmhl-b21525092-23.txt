15 CHAPTER v Writing Materials. Seals. Without any definite search I have collected a few travelling ink-holders. A common variety is made of silver with a screw top. My specimen is of the year 1814, but I have seen them as early as the reign of George II. Another common variety is made of tortoise-shell, and contains in addition to the inkstand a silver pen and penholder and seal. Inside the lid is a looking-glass. One of my specimens is said to have belonged to Lady Byron. A third common variety is made of leather, and also con- tains pen and penholder of silver, as well as an inkstand. One of my specimens has a silver box for wafers underneath the inkstand ; it is marked I B. More interesting than ink-holders are pounce boxes, which were used for sprinkling powder over freshly written paper before the invention of blotting paper. They are still used in small towns on the Continent. Most old silver and porcelain inkstands have one by the side of the ink bottle. I have one in Bristol and one in Plymouth china which illus- trate very plainly the points of difference and likeness in the two factories ; two in wood ; one of Spode china; one of Battersea enamel. I have also a little silver-gilt one of the sixteenth century, but it is possible that it is for scent and not for pounce. A common variety is of iron, oblong in shape, with an inner box sliding under the perforated outer box. One of mine is engraved “ Moses Basse Coroner Wend- over Bucks 1779,” and the holes are arranged to read “ Success to trade.” Another is engraved “ S. Greenwood Draper &c.” Wafer boxes are sometimes met with, but I have only one. It is made of tortoise-shell and silver, with a negro’s head at the top. Seals are innumerable, and belong to all nations and all

i6 ages. Of English ones I have collected and given away hundreds, and still they keep coming in a steady flow, for they always appeal to me. The prettiest set I have con- sists of three and a watch key on a ring. Each of these five articles is made of a gold snake, with little diamonds for eyes. One seal bears a crest, a second a coat of arms, the third an initial. The date is about 1780. Another consists of 11 seals in a silver box. The box is open at one end so that the seal at the bottom makes an impress. It must have been clumsy to use. CHAPTER VI. Books. Diaries.- Engravings. Books are most dangerous things to collect, unless one collects with method. I have made many efforts in different direc- tions, swimming, polygamy, English spas, etc., and have at last restricted myself almost entirely to the collection of old English cookery books anterior to 1700. These are all that remains of a foolish attempt to collect old medical books which, if carried out with perseverance, would have filled my house with books. Medicine and cookery are often found united in very attractive little volumes in the seven- teenth century, and on clearing out the medical books I still kept these compound treatises, and thus drifted into the collecting of all cookery books provided they were English, and earlier than 1700. In an Appendix I have given a bibliography, and hope it may be useful to any who wish to start a research into this branch of study. Apart from cookery books I am only collecting with zeal the early English translations of Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus, a list of which are in an Appendix. I have a few interesting books left from much miscel- laneous collecting, and am especially fond of three.

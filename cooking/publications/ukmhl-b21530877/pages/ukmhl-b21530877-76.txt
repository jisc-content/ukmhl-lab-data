62 EGGS, &C. a fine light brown, and serve them up with a little brown gravy. 120. A Fricassee of Eggs. Take a penny-loaf, without the crust, cut in thin slices, toast it a light brown, cut it into sippets. Put olive-oil and butter into the frying-pan, make it hot, put the sippet in, turn it over in the pan, and lay it on a dish. Have ready six eggs boiled hard, pare and cut them from end to end, into three, fry them in the remainder of the oil, put one on each sippet; sprinkle over them crisped parsley. Serve them up with melted butter. 121. Egg-balls. Pound the yolks of eggs boiled hard, in a marble mortar, with a little flour, white pepper and salt, add as much raw yolk of egg as will make it up into balls, about one to three, boil them three minutes be- fore they are put into soups, &c. 122. Egg-balls with Onions. Make some balls of eggs and boil them as in the preceding receipt; chop the whites a little, and fry them with some onion that has been partly boiled; when of a nice brown, add a little pepper, salt, and a little hot water or herb-broth; let it boil about a minute, then pour it on toasted sippets, and lay the balls round it. 123. Sorrel with Buttered Eggs. Boil some sorrel, chop it and stir it into some buttered eggs, and pour it on sippets. Beets or spinach boiled with a little parsley, and a leaf or two of sage, is also very good mixed with buttered eggs in the same way. Boiled sorrel, squeezed and stirred on the fire with some butter, and laid on fried toast with poached eggs, is very good.

INTRODUCTION. The pernicious custom of eating animal food having become so general in this country, the following observations are submitted to the consideration of the public, in the hope that some impartial and well- disposed persons will be thereby induced to relinquish the practice, from a conviction that the flesh of ani- mals is not only unnecessary for the support of man, but that a vegetable diet is more favourable to health, humanity, and religion. That animal food is unnecessary to the sustenance of man will appear evident, when it is considered that, in the first ages of the world, mankind lived wholly on the vegetable productions of the earth, and that even at this day, millions of human beings in Asia and Africa subsist in a similar manner. But we need not go back to the primitive ages, nor travel to dis- tant climes, in order to prove that vegetable food is nutritive and salutary; we have the evidence at hand: the most hardy Highlanders take comparatively little animal food; and the Irish labourer, who works hard and possesses much strength, lives principally on a vegetable diet. If additional testimony were needed, proofs sufficient to establish the practicability and salutariness of the system are afforded in the health and strength enjoyed by the persons belonging to the society of which the Editor of this work is a member, upwards of one hundred of whom have entirely ab- stained from animal food and intoxicating liquor from ten to twenty years.

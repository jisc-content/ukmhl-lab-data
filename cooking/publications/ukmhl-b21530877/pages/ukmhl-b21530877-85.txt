71 VEGETABLES, &C. 155. To roast Onions. Roast onions with the skins on in a Dutch oven, turning them frequently; let them be thoroughly done; they are very good with cold butter, pepper, and salt, to eat with bread or potatoes. 156. To make a Ragout of Onions. Take a pint of small young onions, and four large ones, peel and cut the large ones very small; put a quarter of a pound of butter into a stewpan; when it is melted and has done hissing, throw in your onions, and fry them till they begin to look a little brown; then dredge in a little flour, and shake them round till they are rather thick; put in a little salt, some pepper, a quarter of a pint of water, and a tea-spoonful of mustard. Stir all together, and when it is well tasted and of a good thickness, pour it into your dish, and garnish it with fried crumbs of bread or raspings. You may use raspings instead of flour, if preferred. 157. Calecannon Is an Irish dish, and is made by boiling and mashing greens, young cabbage, and spinach, and then mixing them with good mealy mashed potatoes, butter, pep- per, and salt, and pressing it into a basin or mould well-buttered ; set it in a hot oven five or six minutes; then turn it out on a dish. In this dish two-thirds should be potato. Plain Calecannon is made in cottages with infi- nitely less ceremony, and it is quite as good. Boil the greens or cabbage till nearly done; put the peeled raw potatoes to them; when done, drain the water very well from them ; dry them a little, and with pep- per, salt, or shred onion, and a good piece of butter, beat them up together.

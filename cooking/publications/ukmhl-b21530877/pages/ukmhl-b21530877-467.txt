SELECTIONS FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT; or, the Religion, Morality, and Poetry of the Hebrew Scrip- tures, arranged under heads. By Sarah Austin. “ My sole object has been to put together all that presented itself to my own heart and mind as most persuasive, consola- tory, or elevating, in such a form and order as to be easy of reference, conveniently arranged and divided, and freed from matter either hard to be understood, unattractive or unprofit- able (?to say the least) for young and pure eyes.”—Preface. “ Selections, we believe, are now generally used in Schools, but none that have fallen under our own notice at all equal the present attempt. It is not every one that can be intrusted with making these selections. The present is made by Mrs. Austin, a lady distinguished for many accomplishments, and particularly for her singular power of not translating but transmutiug German books into English ones.” — United Kingdom, Nov. 25.

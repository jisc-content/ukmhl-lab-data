199 BREAD, BUNS, &C. 621. Excellent Buns. To three and a half pounds of flour, take half a pound of butter, half a pound of powdered loaf-sugar, three eggs well beaten, a pint and three-quarters of new milk just warm, and four table-spoonsful of good yeast; let it rise well in sponge, then mix them up with currants, caraway-seeds, lemon-peel grated, or candied lemon. They should be very light, and baked in cheesecake tins. They are very nice without the currants. 622. Common Buns, To three pounds of flour put half a pound of sugar, rub in a quarter of pound of butter and a little salt; warm nearly a pint and a half of new milk, and mix with it five table-spoonsful of yeast; when it has stood a little to settle, clear it off into the middle of the flour, stirring it till of a thin batter, cover it and let it rise well in the sponge; then mix it up with three-quarters of a pound of currants, well cleaned, a tea-spoonful of ginger, and half an ounce of cara- way-seeds. Make it up into buns, cover them with a cloth, and let them rise twenty minutes, or half an hour in cold weather, and bake them in a brisk oven. 623. Hard Biscuits. Warm two ounces of butter in as much skimmed milk as will make a pound of flour into a stiff paste, beat it with a paste roller, and work it smooth, roll it out thin, and cut it into round cakes, prick them with a fork. Six minutes will bake them. 624. Biscuits or Cracknels. Take three pounds of flour, rub in six ounces of butter quite fine, very little salt, one egg well beaten, with a small table-spoonful of well-purified yeast,

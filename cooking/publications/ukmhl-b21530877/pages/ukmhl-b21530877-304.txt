290 PICKLES, &C. 894. Vinegar from Malt Liquor. To ten gallons of malt liquor, (not beer,) take half an ounce of cream of tartar, the same of bay salt and alum, dissolved in two quarts of the liquor boil- ing hot; put it hot into the cask, cover the bung- hole with a piece of brown paper, and it will be fine vinegar in a short time. 895. To distil Verjuice for Pickle. Take three quarts (or a larger quantity if requisite) of good verjuice, distil it off very gently in a cold still; the sooner it is done in the spring the better ; it will in a short time be fit to pickle mushrooms, or to put in sauces, &c., where lemon is required. 896. To make Verjuice. Take crabs when quite ripe, lay them together to sweat a few days or a week, then wipe them dry and pick them from the stalks ; they must then be stamped quite to a mash; strain and press them through a hair-bag. Put the verjuice in a large jar, covered close, and in a few weeks clear it off into bottles. 897. To preserve Vinegar. Put the vinegar in a clean vessel, and let it just boil a quarter of a minute, then put it into bottles ; or it may be put in bottles and set on the fire in a pan of water, till the water boils; when cold, cork them well, and it will keep several years. 898. Vinegar of Roses. Take dried roses, put them in a stone bottle, a large handful to a quart of distilled vinegar, set it in the sun or by the fire till the virtue is extracted, then strain and keep it for use.

54 OMELETS, FRITTERS, &C. well-beaten eggs and a little cream ; make it up in balls, and fry them in oil and butter ; put them in a dish with some eggs boiled hard, cut in quarters, or cut across in three, and fried with the balls; pour over them brown gravy. Currant jelly is a pleasant addition to this dish. 92. A Dish of Eggs and Bread. Beat the yolks of five eggs and the white of one; mix as much bread-crumbs as will make it a stiff batter, adding a little salt; put it in a small oval dish buttered, and set it in the oven about a quarter of an hour; melt some butter in a frying-pan, and turn the substance out of the dish into it, having ready the whites of the five eggs and one yolk beaten to pour over it, keeping it to one side of the pan as much as possible; sprinkle it over with bread-crumbs, and when browned, turn and brown it on the other side. Serve it up with brown gravy in the dish, and onion sauce in a boat. 93. Brovm Gravy. Take two or three ounces of butter and one table- spoonful of flour ; put them together in a frying-pan with a small bit of white sugar; keep stirring it over a slow fire till it is of a fine brown, then add boiling water till of a proper thickness; season it with pepper and salt, and a little mushroom catsup if approved. A little zest is an excellent seasoning for gravy. The gravy would be much improved by being made with vegetable broth instead of water, and thickened with potato-flour.

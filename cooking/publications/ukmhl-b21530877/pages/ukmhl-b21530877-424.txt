APPENDIX. 1264. Gourd, or Vegetable Marrow Soup, Let the gourds be full grown, but not those with hard skins; slice three or four and put them in a stew-pan with two or three onions sliced, and a good bit of butter; set them over a slow fire till quite tender, (be careful not to let them burn,) then add two ounces of crust of bread, and two quarts of boil- ing water, season with salt catsup and Cayenne pepper, boil ten or fifteen minutes, and pass it through a sieve; then make it quite hot and serve up with fried bread. 1265. Rice Soup. Steep half a pound of Patna rice two hours, in a quart of water, then set it over a moderate fire, with a pinch of salt, till the rice is tender, then add two quarts of milk, and let it boil a few minutes ; then serve it up in a tureen. 1266. Turnip Hash. To two quarts of water take four or five moderate- sized turnips, pared and cut in pieces as for a pie, a large onion chopped small with a little celery, let it boil an hour, then put in two middling-sized potatoes cut in pieces, with pepper and salt, boil it another hour, then thicken it with some butter and flour, stirring it till it boils; it is then ready to serve. It should be of the same consistence as soup.

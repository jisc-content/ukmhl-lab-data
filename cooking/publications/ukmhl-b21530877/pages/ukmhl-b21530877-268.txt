254 PRESERVED FRUITS, JELLIES, &C. every pint allow a pound of fine loaf-sugar: boil it til^ it is quite clear and will jelly. 788. Apricot Jam. Scald the fruit, take off the skins, and stone them ; then to every pound of fruit, take three-quarters of a pound of loaf-sugar pounded, boil it till clear, drop a little on a plate, and if it jellies, it is enough ; pour it into moulds to turn out. The bruised fruit, or that which is too ripe for pre- serving whole, may be used for this purpose. 789. Cherry Jam. To four pounds of cherries, allow a pound of fine sugar, and half a pint of red-currant juice; stone the cherries, and boil the whole together pretty fast till it will stiffen, then put it into pots for use. Boil the currant juice and sugar together before you put in the fruit. 790. Another way. To twelve pounds of Kentish or duke cherries when ripe, weigh one pound of sugar ; break the stones of part, and blanch the kernels, put them to the fruit and sugar, and boil it till the jam will leave the pan. Pour it on plates to dry. Keep it in boxes with white paper between each layer. 791. Red Currant Jam. Put any quantity of currants into a preserving-pan, with two pounds of sugar to every three pounds of currants, and a little raspberry-juice to dissolve the sugar; put in your currants, and boil them till they are very clear. Put them into jars, and when cold, strew sugar over, cover with paper, and keep them in a dry place.

156 PIES, TARTS, &C. Pears that are not good for eating raw, being of a hard kind, are generally the best baking pears, and make excellent pies when prepared as above. They are also very good mixed with apples. If of the softer kind, they do not, of course, require stew- ing. 475. Gooseberry, and other Fruit Pies. Gooseberries, cherries, and currants, should be fresh gathered, picked, and washed ; lay any of these fruits in a deep dish heaped to the centre, cover the edge of the dish with a shred of paste, allow about a quar- ter of a pound of sugar to a quart of fruit, cover it with paste, and bake it in a moderately hot oven. Plums, damsons, a mixture of currants and rasp- berries, or any other kind of fruit, may be used for pies in the same way. Black currants, though not in general use for fruit pies, make a very good pie, of which many persons are extremely fond, but if not quite ripe, they should be stewed in a little water, with the re- quisite portion of sugar, about a quarter of an hour, and remain till cold before being made into a pie. When gooseberries are very sour, pour boiling water upon them and let them stand about ten or * fifteen minutes, then drain the water from them. 476. Fig Tart. Slice some good figs, and put to them as much milk as will just cover them, put a plate over and set them in a moderate oven to stew a little; stir in a small piece of butter, and sugar to the taste ; line a soup- plate or patty-pans with puff paste; finish them in the same manner as mince pies. A few sharp apples or a little lemon-juice would probably be an improvement.

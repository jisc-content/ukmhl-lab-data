Gather the damsons quite dry and sound before they are too ripe, put them in wide-necked bottles, cork them loosely, and set them in a moderate oven for three or four hours. All kinds of fruit that are bot- tled may be done in the same way, and if properly done, will keep good for two years. When cold, cement the corks, and set them in a cool dry place, with the necks downward, to prevent them from fer- menting. Be very careful the oven is not too hot, or the bottles will fly. Cork them tight when they are quite cold. It is a very good plan to lay a double sheet of brown paper in the oven, and lay the bottles on their sides, turning them occasionally. 839. To bottle Green Currants. Gather the currants when the sun is hot upon them, cut or strip them from the stalks with a fork, and put them in clean dry bottles; set them in a dry cool place, or keep them in dry sand, with the necks downward. Black currants, before they are quite ripe, may be done the same way. 840. To bottle Cranberries. Pick them quite clean and put them in clean bottles, fill the bottles with cold spring water that has been previously boiled ; cement the corks, and keep them in a cool place. American cranberries and cluster- berries are kept in the same way. When to be used for tarts, stew them a little with a few spoonsful of the water they have been kept in, and sugar.

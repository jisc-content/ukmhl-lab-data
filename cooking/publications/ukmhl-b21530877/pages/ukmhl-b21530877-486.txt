By JUSTIN BRENAN, Author of ** Composition and Punctuation,** $c. In this little treatise, the important subject of classical utility is placed in an origi- nal and highly interesting point of view, and entirely free from the prejudices that are usually brought in aid of such discussions. “ We are happy in having another opportunity of complimenting the author of * Composition and Punctuation,’ on a work which, unlike many of the present day, contains multum in parvo, in which, iu short, good sense and practical utility are in an immense ratio to its size and page.”—Edinburgh Literary Journal.

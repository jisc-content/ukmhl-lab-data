192 BREAD, BUNS, &C. night. The next morning the whole lump will be well fermented or leavened; add a little salt, and as much warm water (not warmer than new milk) as will mix it, knead it up quite stiff and firm till it be smooth and pliable, the more it is kneaded the better : let it stand by the fire about two hours, then make it up into loaves and bake them. In the northern counties, where leaven is most used, it is common to mix some rye flour, in the proportion of about a fourth part, with the wheaten flour in leavened bread, and which, in all common household bread, is a great improvement. 606. To make Bread with Yeast. Put some water milk-warm to as much yeast as will be required, stir it well together, and let it stand to settle five or six minutes; then make a hole in the middle of your flour, and pour the water carefully off, leaving the brown sediment at the bottom ; add more water, and mix it with a part of the flour into a kind of batter; strew a little flour over it, and let the remainder lie round it. This is called setting the sponge, and should be done two hours at the least previous to kneading ; for a large quantity it should be done the night before, and by morning it will be much risen: add then more warm water and some salt, knead it exceedingly well into rather a stiff dough, and let it rise two hours or less according to quantity ; then make it into loaves. A quartern loaf requires about two hours in a well- heated oven, larger ones in proportion. 607. Bread with Potatoes. To fourteen pounds of good sound flour, either coarse or fine, take five pounds of potatoes, pared and washed very clean, boil them in a proper quan- tity of water till quite soft, mash them and rub them

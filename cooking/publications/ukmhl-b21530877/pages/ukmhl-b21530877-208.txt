194 BREAD, BUNS, &C. must be extremely well kneaded, then let it rise two or three hours; bake it in tins that will hold about nine pounds ; the oven should be hot as for other bread when first put in, but it should remain in the oven some time longer than bread made in the usual way. It is usual to put it in the oven at night, whence it has obtained the name of night-bread. When baked, fold it in a clean wet cloth, and put it in the cellar a day or two before it is cut. This is an excellent way of making bread, and will keep well if properly managed : but much depends on the knead- ing and the heat of the oven. It is only proper for coarse flour; that makes the best bread where the corn is ground all together, or only a little of the coarse bran taken out. 611. Common Wheaten Bread on Mr. CobbetCs Plan, Make a hole in the middle of a bushel of flour ; stir a pint of yeast into some milk-warm water, let it stand a little to settle, then pour it into the middle of the flour, and stir it with a wooden slice about a minute, till you have a thin batter; sprinkle a little flour over the batter, and cover the whole with a cloth three or four folds to keep it warm ; set it at a proper distance from the fire, according to the state of the weather and the season of the year: when the batter has risen enough to make cracks through which it ferments, form the whole into dough thus:â€” strew in six ounces of salt, then work the flour into the batter round the edges, pouring in milk-warm water, or milk, as it is wanted, till the whole is moist- ened ; knead it extremely well. It may then either be immediately formed into loaves, letting them rise twenty minutes before put in the oven ; or let the dough rise an hour in the mass, and then make it up into loaves, Bake according to the size.

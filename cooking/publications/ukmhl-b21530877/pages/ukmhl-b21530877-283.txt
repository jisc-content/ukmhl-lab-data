PRESERVED FRUITS, JELLIES, &C. 269 2 a 3 841. To bottle Gooseberries. Pick gooseberries of the small round kind, put them in clean dry bottles, cork them, but not tight, put them in a pan of cold water, and set them on a mo- derate fire; when the gooseberries change colour and begin to shrink a little in the bottles, take them off the fire and let them stand till cold, then cork them tight and cement the corks. Keep them in dry sand in a cool place, with the necks downward. They should be done very gently, and it is well to put a little hay at the bottom of the pan and between the bottles. Green currants answer very well done in the same way. Rhubarb peeled and cut as for tarts, bottled and scalded in the same manner as gooseberries, will keep many months, and answers extremely well. 842. Another way. Pick the gooseberries as before, into clean bottles, then fill them up with spring water that has been boiled with a small bit of alum in it, and stood till cold again ; set them on the fire in a pan of cold water; when they begin to look white in the bottles, j take the pan off the fire, and let them stand till cold ; I then take them out of the pan, cork and cement them, and keep them in a cool place free from damp. 843. To preserve Apples during the winter, Spread a coarse cloth on the floor in an upper room, place a layer of apples, then a cloth, and so on alter- nately to any height you please; then throw a large coarse cloth over the whole, taking great care that the cloth be turned under the edge of the cloth first laid on the floor, all the way round, so as to commu- j nicate with the floor on every side.

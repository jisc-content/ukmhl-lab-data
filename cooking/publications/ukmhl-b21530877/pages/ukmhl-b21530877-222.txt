208 BREAD, BUNS, &C. butter; let them stand on the hearth to rise about twenty minutes, covered with a thin cloth, then bake them in rather a quick oven. 650. Wigs. Two pounds of flour, mix with it half a pound of sugar sifted, and an ounce of caraway-seeds; melt half a pound of butter in a pint of milk ; when about as warm as new milk, put to it three eggs, leaving out one white, and a spoonful of yeast, mix them well together, and let the paste stand five hours to rise; make it into wigs, and bake them on tins. 651. Wigs. Two pounds of flour, a quarter of a pound of butter rubbed in it, a quarter of a pound of fine sugar, very little salt, and three spoonsful of new yeast; make it into a light paste with half a pint of warm cream, let it stand an hour to rise; then make it up into wigs. Bake them on tins in a quick oven. Caraway-seeds may be added, if approved. They may also be made into large round cakes, crossed so as to be easily di- vided into quarters, and stand before the fire to rise on the tins, before they are baked. 652. Yorkshire Cakes. Dry a pound and a half of flour before the fire; beat up an egg with a spoonful of good yeast, add three- quarters of a pint of new milk lukewarm ; strain the whole through a hair-sieve into the flour, mix it lightly into dough, and let it rise by the fire an hour, then make it up into cakes, rub the tins with very little butter, and let them be warm when you lay the cakes on them, cover with a thin cloth, and let them rise on the hearth about twenty or thirty minutes; bake them in a brisk oven. This makes very good buns, with a little good moist-sugar and a few caraway-seeds.

PIES, tARTS, &C. 155 of a proper size. Another way of making them is to cut the apples (when pared) in slices, and dip them in a thick batter and fry them. The apples should be of a good baking kind, or they will eat hard. Sugar and butter may be eaten with them. Currant fritters may be made in the same manner. PIES, TARTS, See. 473. Apple Pie. Pare, core, and slice some good baking apples ; cover the edge of the dish and about an inch down the sides with a shred of puff paste, put in the apples with moist sugar sufficient to sweeten it, cover the pie with the paste, make a small hole in the middle, and put in a slip of writing paper rolled up, but not close, to keep it open. Stew the parings and cores in a little water, strain it, and when the pie is baked, pour it into the pie through a small funnel. If the apples are good, seasoning is unnecessary ; â€”if they are insipid, a little grated lemon-peel and juice, quince marmalade, or a little grated nutmeg, is an agreeable addition. Bake in a moderately hot oven. The dish should be quite filled with apples, as they shrink very much in baking. 474. Pear Pie. Pare and slice the fruit, boil the parings a little with some apple parings and a bit of lemon-peel, in water, then strain the liquor, and put it in a broad pan with the sliced pears, stew them about a quarter of an hour, adding sugar to the taste ; pour them into a dish, and, when cool, proceed in the same way as for an apple pie, leaving out a part of the syrup to put in after the pie is baked,

PRESERVED FRUITS, JELLIES, &C. 27 L their flavour; the moisture is absorbed by the sand, the apples kept dry, and all mustiness prevented. Apples may also be preserved in hods, in the man- ner of potatoes. The apples should be of hardy, good keeping sorts, and not more than four or five bushels should be put into one hod. It is requisite to place straw or dried fern at the bottom and sides, and also to cover the top of the apples, so as entirely to separate them from the earth, which is not always observed with potatoes. Dry sand would probably answer better than either fern or straw. 847. To preserve Nuts. When ripe, put the nuts into a large earthenware-pan, and when filled with nuts, place it in a deep hole dug for the purpose, in a dry part of the garden. The top of the pan being covered with a flat piece of wood, put | on a heavy weight or stone, and fill the hole with earth. By these means, nuts may be kept in a fresh state till the time for gathering them from the trees returns. Another way is to shell them, rub them in a cloth, and bottle them ; place the bottles in the cellar. It is also not unusual to put salt amongst nuts to pre- serve them. 848. To clarify Sugar. Put half a pint of water to every pound of sugar, beat up some whites of eggs with it, allowing one with the shell to every six pounds of sugar; put it on the fire when the sugar is dissolved, and when it rises in boiling, sprinkle in a little cold water, which should be kept at hand in a basin, in case the sugar should rise rapidly; let it rise three times without skimming it; the fourth time skim it well, throwing in a little cold water each time, till the white scum ceases to rise, then strain it through a flannel or cloth strainer,

FRITTERS, &C. 151 456. Rice Fritters. Boil the rice in milk, put in a little cinnamon and the peel of a lemon, sweeten it with sifted sugar; when the rice is done, take out the lemon-peel and cinna- mon, and stir a piece of butter in, add four eggs and a little nutmeg, butter a pewter dish and spread the rice on it; when cold, cut it out with a cutter of what shape you think proper, then dip the rice in beaten egg, and fry the fritters in butter a nice brown. Serve them up with fine sugar. 457. Potato Fritters. Slice potatoes thin, dip them in smooth batter, and fry them. Serve them up with white sugar grated over them. Lemon-peel and a spoonful of orange- flower water may be added to the batter. 458. Potato Fritters. To half a pound of potato, mashed fine after it is boiled, add a large spoonful of cream, four eggs well beaten, a little salt, half a spoonful of lemon-juice, a wine-glass of sherbet, and a little nutmeg grated; beat these to a light batter, and fry them in butter the usual size of fritters. Serve them up with sugar sifted over them. 459. Tansy Fritters. Pour a pint of boiling milk on a pint of bread-crumbs, let it stand an hour, then add tansy-juice to the taste, and some spinach-juice to green it, the grated rind of half a lemon, the yolks of four eggs well beaten, mix all well together, and put them into a stewpan with three ounces of butter, stir it over a slow fire till quite thick, then pour it out and let it stand two hours; fry in butter the same as other fritters, and sift sugar on them. It is very good baked in puff paste as a pudding.

147 FRITTERS, &C. 441. Cream Sauce for Puddings. Boil gently some thin cream with sugar, cinnamon, and lemon-peel; when it tastes well, take out the seasoning, and thicken it with a little butter and po- tato-flour ; let it just boil up, then pour it from one vessel to another till quite smooth ; set it in a pan of hot water covered close till wanted; and immediately before it is served up, add a glass of sherbet or rasp- berry vinegar. This sauce is very suitable for custard, rice, or bread pudding; also for fresh fruit puddings, I leaving out the vinegar or sherbet. 442. Apple Fritters.

USEFUL FAMILY RECEIPTS. 343 1059. To clarify Isinglass. Break your isinglass into small pieces with a hammer, wash it in several waters, and to four ounces add six pints of water; reduce it by boiling one-third, skim- ming it carefully ; then strain it through a silk sieve : it is then ready to use for making whiskied jellies, creams, &c. 1060. To clarify Honey. The best kind is clarified by merely melting it in a water-bath, and taking off the scum; the inferior kind by dissolving it in water, adding the white of an egg to each pint of the solution, and boiling it down to its original consistence, skimming it fre- quently. 1061. Everton Toffy. Warm, and rub a pan with a little butter, put in a pound of brown sugar, with two table-spoonsful of water, let it boil on a slow fire till it becomes a smooth thick syrup, then stir in half a pound of butter; when it has boiled about half an hour, drop a little on a plate, and if it becomes hard, and leaves the plate quite clean, it is enough : pour it about half an inch thick on a dish or tin well buttered. From twenty to thirty drops of essence of lemon stirred in, after it is taken off the fire, gives it a pleasant flavour. 1062. Treacle Toffy. Bub your pan with a little butter, pour in the treacle, and let it boil about an hour, then pour it into a basin warmed and rubbed over with butter; when cool, roll it up in sticks, and fold it in clean paper. Before it is poured into the pan, a little essence of pepper- mint may be added.

352 USEFUL FAMILY RECEIPTS. 1092. Syrvp for Coughs, Spitting of Blood, fyc. Take six ounces of comfrey-roots, and twelve hands- ful of plantain-leaves ; cut and beat them well, strain out the juice, and with an equal weight of sugar boil it to a syrup. An infusion of tormentil-leaves, or a decoction of the roots, is very useful for spitting of blood: bran- tea, also, has been found highly useful. 1093. Syrvp of Angelica-root for the Influenza. Boil down gently for three hours a handful of ange- lica-root in a quart of water, then strain it off, and add liquid Narbonne or best virgirr honey sufficient to make it into a balsam or syrup; take two tea- spoonsful every night and morning, as well as seve- ral times in the day. If attended with hoarseness or sore throat, add a few drops of sweet spirit of nitre. 1094. For a Hoarseness or Difficulty of Breathing. Put a fresh laid egg into a small jar with the juice (strained) of two large lemons, or as much as will entirely cover the egg; keep it covered quite close, and set it in about the same degree of heat as if it stood on the chimney-piece where a moderate fire is kept; it will require about twenty-four hours to dissolve the shell; when dissolved, the skin may easily be removed by a pointed knife, then beat it up with two ounces of white sugar-candy powdered fine, or two ounces of honey; put it in a bottle, and keep it closely corked. Take a tea-spoonful at any time. A quarter of a pint of the best white-wine vinegar may be used instead of the lemon-juice, if more con- venient, and more honey or sugar-candy may be added if preferred.

46 SOUPS, &c. stew them over the fire till they are done enough, and lightly coloured, stirring them frequently, add boiling water or vegetable broth; salt and pepper, boil it two minutes, and afterwards simmer it a little, with some thin slices of bread toasted and put in. 68. Celery-Porridge. Cut some celery and endive small, and stew them well in some vegetable broth ; when quite tender, add a little butter browned, and a little flour if requisite; stew them ten minutes longer, and serve it up with fried sippets of bread, or a slice of toast laid at the bottom of the dish. 69. Soup Herb Powder, or Vegetable Relish. Take dried parsley, winter savoury, sweet marjoram, lemon thyme, of each two ounces; lemon-peel cut very thin and dried, sweet basil, an ounce of each; one drachm of celery-seed. Dry them in a clean Dutch oven, but not too quick; when quite dry, powder them very fine, and sift the powder through a fine-hair sieve ; stop it close in a bottle, and it will retain its flavour some months. 70. Savoury Powder. Salt one ounce, mustard half an ounce, mace and cloves together a quarter of an ounce, white pepper ground, and lemon-peel grated, half an ounce each, grated nutmeg a quarter of an ounce, prepared ginger three drachms, Cayenne pepper two drachms ; pound the mixture together very well, and pass it through a fine hair-sieve, and bottle it for use. The above articles will pound easier and finer, if dried in a Dutch oven at a good distance from the fire. Zest, a vegetable powder, prepared by the late Dr. Kitchener, is an excellent seasoning for soups, gravies, &c. &c.

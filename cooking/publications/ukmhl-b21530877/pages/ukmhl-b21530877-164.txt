Beat two or three boiled carrots with a wooden spoon till they are quite smooth, put to each carrot, if large, two eggs, a little nutmeg and salt; to three carrots put a handful of flour, moisten them with a little cream or milk, add sugar to the taste, beat them well half an hour, and fry them in butter or fine olive-oil; squeeze over them the juice of a lemon, and sift fine sugar on them. 453. Currant Fritters. Put four yolks and two whites of eggs to a pint of milk, mix with it half a pint of bread-crumbs grated fine, a little nutmeg, six ounces of currants, a quarter of a pound of butter melted, a little salt, and flour sufficient to make it of a moderate thickness; fry them the size of fritters. 454. Hasty Fritters. Take half a pint of ginger-beer, and stir into it by degrees as much flour as will make it a stiff batter, put in a few currants or chopped apples, beat them up quickly and fry them in butter, drop a large spoon- ful for each into the pan, taking care that they do not stick together, turn them, and when they are of a fine brown, lay them on a dish and strew sugar over them. 455.

75 VEGETABLES, &C. one onion sliced thin, a piece of butter the size of an egg, a little allspice tied in a bit of muslin, some pep- per, salt, and a quarter of a pint of water; stew it gently till the cabbage is well done, then take out the allspice and add a spoonful or two of good vinegar.

Cabbages of every kind are very much improved by being boiled in two waters. 170. To stew Carrots. About half boil your carrots, then nicely scrape and slice them, put them into a stewpan with half a tea- cupful of vegetable broth, some white pepper, salt, and a little cream ; simmer them till very tender, but not broken; then stir in a little flour and butter, mix well, and let it simmer a while longer. A little chopped parsley may be added a few minutes before it is served up, if approved. 171. Green and White Beet. The leaves of these plants are very good boiled with some parsley and eaten as spinach. The large white beet when full grown, and the leaves stripped off to the middle rib, which is thick and fleshy, may be peeled and stewed, and eaten like asparagus. Hamburgh parsley roots, boiled like young carrots, eat very well alone or in soups. 172. To cook Peas the French way.

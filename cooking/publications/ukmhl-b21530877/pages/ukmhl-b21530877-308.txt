294 PICKLES, &C. boil them a quarter of an hour in a stone jar set in a pan of water, then set it by for six weeks, stirring it well every day; pour it into small bottles, and keep them very well corked. Obs.â€”The only general rules that can be given for the proper and safe preparation of pickles are, to have sound vegetables, not over ripe, dry, and fresh gathered, trimming and wiping them carefully; washing only such things as are to be steeped or parboiled previous to pickling.

Stone jars are the best for keeping pickles, as they are not so porous as the common earthen jars; the pickles should also be kept well covered with vinegar, and the jars well closed ; cork bungs to fit the jars, with a wrapper of leather round, and a cover of the same tied over, answers extremely well for that purpose. Small glass jars or bottles are the best for mushrooms, nasturtiums, &c., dipping the necks in bottle-cement.

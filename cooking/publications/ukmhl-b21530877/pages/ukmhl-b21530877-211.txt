197 BREAD, BUNS, &C. After washing it in two waters, place it about an hour upon a sieve to drain, and add to it in its raw state the usual quantity of yeast mixed with a little warm water and salt; let it stand about an hour, then work it well in the flour. It requires very little addi- tion of water, but rather a longer time to rise. A wholesome bread may be made with the potato fibre and either barley-flour or oatmeal.

The flour should be made as dry as possible, and the soda either powdered fine and mixed with it, or dissolved in the water you make up the bread with. It is a much more wholesome ingre- dient to mix in bread than alum and many other things which are used for that purpose, and has been repeatedly tried.

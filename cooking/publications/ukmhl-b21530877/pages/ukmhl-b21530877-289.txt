Cherries, green gooseberries, Siberian crabs, and other fruits kept in syrups, should not be put into rich syrup at the first, as it tends to make them hard and shrivelled ^ a thin syrup of about a pound of sugar to a pint and a half or a quart of water, (ac- cording to the kind of fruit to be preserved,) will be found quite sufficient to begin with, adding more sugar each time of boiling, till the syrup is rich Enough.

Another way. Cut the cabbages in quarters, take out the cores, and cut them in thin slices. Salt the whole very well, and lay it in an earthen pan four days covered close, turning it every day; then squeeze it well, a handful at once, and put it in a pan of boiling vinegar, with bruised ginger, whole pepper, and a small bit of alum or nitre; let the cabbage boil one minute, then put it in jars, covering them till cold ; then tie leather over them, or two papers separately tied. Small sprigs of cauliflower, or slices of red beet- root, may be added.

Sickles, &c. 2 IS be very crisp and green done in this way, but if not quite green enough with once boiling, boil up the pickle again the next day, and pour it on the cucum- bers immediately. 861. Another way. Put the cucumbers into an unglazed stone jar, cover them with brine made with a quarter of a pound of salt to a quart of water, cover them with cabbage leaves and then a plate, set them on the hearth before the fire for two or three days till they turn yellow, then green them as directed in No. 763, for Preserved Cucumbers, then drain and wipe them quite dry; make a pickle as above, and pour it hot upon them. The pickles should always be kept well covered with vinegar. 862. Beet Roots. Boil the roots till tender, peel and cut them in slices, gimp the edges in the shape of wheels, or any other form; put them in ajar, and pour on them as much vinegar boiled with mace, ginger sliced, and some horseradish, as will cover them. Pour it on hot, and tie it down close. A little bruised cochineal may be added. 863. Mushrooms. Take only the buttons, rub them with a bit of flannel and salt, throw a little salt over, and put them in a stewpan with a little mace and white pepper; as the liquor comes out, shake them and keep them unco- vered over a gentle fire till all the liquor is dried up; then put as much good vinegar into the pan as will cover them, let it warm, then put them into small jars or glass bottles. They will keep two years.

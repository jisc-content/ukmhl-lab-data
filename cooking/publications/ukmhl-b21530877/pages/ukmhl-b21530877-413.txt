399 USEFUL FAMILY RECEIPTS. 2 m 2 Sponge is well suited for nearly all domestic pur- poses of cleaning. 1230. To preserve the colour of Black printed Muslins or Calicoes in Washing. Dissolve a little sugar of lead in the water the prints are to he rinsed in. 1231. To make Flannels keep their colour, and not shrink. Take off all the coloured edge, then pour boiling water upon the flannel, and let it stand till cold be- fore you wash it. It will seldom shrink much after- wards. After the first time of washing, flannels preserve their colour better if washed in merely cold water. 1232. To clean Carpets. Take up the carpet, and let it be well beaten, then laid down, and brushed on both sides with a clothes brush; turn it the right side upwards, and scour it with gall, soap, and water, very clean; then wash it well with clean water and a sponge; and lastly, with clean water with a table-spoonful of oil of vitriol in it, and dry it well with linen cloths; then lay it on the grass, or hang it up to dry. 1233. To revive Old Writings, which are much defaced. Boil gall-nuts in wine, then dip a sponge into the liquor, and pass it on the lines of the old writing: by this method the letters, which were almost unde- cipherable, will appear as fresh as if newly written. 1234. To prevent Ink from turning Mouldy. Put a bit of salt, the size of a hazel nut, to each quart of ink.

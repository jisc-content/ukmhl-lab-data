PRESERVED FRUITS, JELLIES, &C. 255 792. Black Currant Jam. Gather your currants when quite dry, pick them from the stalks, and bruise them in a bowl; to every two pounds of fruit, add a pound and a half of loaf or good moist sugar ; boil them an hour, stirring them all the time, then put them into pots before the sugar is added. 793. Raspberry Jam. Gather your raspberries when quite ripe and dry, mash them fine, and strew over them their weight of sugar, and to every three pounds of fruit, allow a pint of the juice of white or red-currants; boil them three-quarters of an hour over a slow fire, skim them well; and put them into pots or glasses, put papers over as before, and keep them dry. Strew on the sugar as soon as possible after the fruit is gathered; and in order to preserve its fine flavour, do not let it stand long before you boil it. Or, boil the raspber- ries with the currant-juice half an hour before the sugar is added, and half an hour afterwards. For white raspberries, use white currant juice. Another wayâ€”Is to weigh an equal quantity of fruit and powdered sugar, boil the fruit on a slow fire half an hour, then add the sugar, and boil it three-quarters of an hour more. 794. Gooseberry Jam. Put twelve pounds of the red hairy gooseberries, when ripe, and gathered dry, into a preserving-pan, with a pint of raspberry-juice, strained as for jelly, boil rather quick, and stir them with a wooden spoon; when they have boiled about an hour, put to them six pounds of white Lisbon sugar, and boil them slowly to a jam. It requires long boiling, or it will not keep ; it is excellent for tarts or puffs. Look at it

301 SYRUPS, &C. 925. Syrup of Roses. Pour four pints of boiling water on one pound of fresh rose-leaves, or half a pound of dried leaves, cover it close for twelve hours, then strain, and add four pounds of good loaf-sugar ; boil it to a syrup, and, when cold, bottle it. A table-spoonful or two of this syrup, put into a little water with a little lemon-juice, makes a very pleasant liquor. 926. Syrup of Vinegar. Take of good vinegar two pounds and a half, refined sugar three pounds and a half; boil it gently to form a syrup. This is a very pleasant syrup, and is often preferred to the lemon syrup. A little of this syrup, or ginger syrup, according to the taste, is an agreeable addition to any of the milder syrups when mixed with water. 927. Syrup of Clove-gillyflowers. Pour three pints of boiling water on one pound of clove-flowers cut off from the white part, let them stand twelve hours covered close, then strain and boil it gently to a syrup, with five pounds and a half of refined sugar powdered. Syrup of marigolds may be prepared the same way. 928. Syrup of Violets. Pour five pints of boiling water on two pounds of the fresh petals of blue violets in a glazed earthen vessel, cover it close, and let it stand twenty-four hours, then strain, and add seven pounds of refined sugar.

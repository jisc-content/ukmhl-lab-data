106 SAVOURY PIES, PUDDINGS, &C. 287. Potato Pudding. Peel five pounds of potatoes, one pound of onions, and half a gill of groats, chop them small, tie them up in a cloth, boil them three or four hours. When boiled, season to your taste with pepper, salt, and butter. 288. Peas Pudding. Wash the peas very well in warm water, and, if whole, steep them two hours ; tie them up loosely, and boil them till they will pulp through a wire-sieve, then add salt, pepper, and two well-beaten eggs ; stir in a good piece of butter, and tying it up firm, boil half an hour. Turn it out of the cloth, and serve it up with melted butter in a boat. 289. Herb Pudding. Steep a quart of groats in warm water an hour, put in half a pound of butter cut in little bits ; take spi- nach, beets, and parsley, a handful of each, three or four leeks, three onions chopped small, a few apples, three sage-leaves cut fine, and a little salt, mix all well together, and tie it close in a cloth; boil it two hours, and take it up to loosen the string a little when boiling. Three-quarters of a pound of rice may be used instead of groats, if preferred. 290. A Green-bean Pudding. Boil and blanch some beans when old and mealy, beat them in a mortar with very little pepper and salt; some cream, and the yolk of an egg ; a little spinach- juice will give a finer colour, but it is as well without; boil it an hour in a basin that will just hold it; pour parsley and butter over. 291. Onion and Sage Pasty. Boil some onions, fresh sage, and a little parsley;

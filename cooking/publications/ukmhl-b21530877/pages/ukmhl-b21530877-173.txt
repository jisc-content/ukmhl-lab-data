159 PIES, TARTS, &C. 485. Raspberry Tart with Cream. Lay some puff paste in a large patty-pan or shallow pie-dish, put in raspberries and a few red currants, sweeten with good sugar, cover it with a thin lid, and bake it; when enough, cut it open and have ready the following mixture warm: half a pint of cream, the yolks of two eggs well beaten, and a little sugar, add this to the tart, and return it into the oven for five or six minutes. It is a very good tart with plain cream. 486. Orange Tartâ€¢ Line a tart-pan with puff paste, put into it orange marmalade that is made with apple jelly, lay small shreds of paste on crosswise. 487. Tarts made after the French manner. Having made a crust as directed for this purpose, roll it out, and cut it round by a plate, according to the size required for the tart. Lay the paste on a sheet of tin, then spread the sweetmeat V\Pon it, which must be a jam or marmalade, not a sweetmeat made with syrup, but do not spread it too thick, leaving a border round the edge an inch, or an inch and a half wide, according to the size of the tart. Wet the border with a feather dipped in water, and then lay over it another border of the crust rolled tolerably thick, so as to rise just above the sweetmeat. Orna- ment this border according to the fancy, and lay over the sweetmeat little ornaments of paste cut with the jagging iron, or otherwise according to the taste; about three-quarters of an hour will bake it. Sift a little fine sugar over it before it is sent to table. If j preferred, the border may be made of the light puff crust; it renders the tart rather more delicate. P2 ,

104 SAVOURY PIES, PUDDINGS, &C 278. Potato Pasty. Peel, boil, and mash potatoes as fine as possible, mix them with salt, pepper, and a good piece of butter ; make a paste, roll it out thin like a large puff, and put in the potatoes, fold over one half, pinching the edges: bake it in a moderate oven. 279. Sage and Onions with Buttered Toast. Half boil some sage and onions in two waters, then fry them in butter, and season with pepper and salt, lay the mixture on buttered toast with some brown gravy. It is very good with mustard and apple- sauce. A little water in which peas, or asparagus, have been boiled poured upon the toast is an im- provement ; or the toast may be dipped in the water. 280. A Savoury Pudding. Take off the crust from a twopenny loaf, pour some boiling milk on it, cover it, and let it stand till cold, crush the bread very fine, add pepper, salt, four eggs, a quarter of a pound of butter, a few onions chopped small, a little thyme, sage, and marjoram; bake it in a dish in the oven. This is very good eaten with . potatoes. 281. Savoury Macaroni Pudding. Simmer half a pound of macaroni in plenty of water and a table-spoonful of salt, till tender, but not too soft; the form should be preserved, and no part be- ginning to melt (this caution will serve for the pre- paration of all macaroni) ; drain the water from it, beat up five yolks and two whites of eggs, half a pint of cream, three table-spoonsful of finely-grated cheese, and season with pepper and salt; mix these well together and put them in a pudding-mould well buttered, then let it steam in a stewpan of boiling wate? about an hour; serve quite hot with gravy.

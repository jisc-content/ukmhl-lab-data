10 INTRODUCTION. the use of man’s life are salt, flour, wheat, honey, milk, &c.; but there is no mention made of the flesh of cattle. From Prov. xxvii. 23—27, it would seem that the design of keeping flocks was for the fleece and the milk. See also 1 Cor. ix. 7, and Psalm xlix. 14. These and several other passages which might be adduced may reasonably be considered as sufficient to convince a humane person that it is contrary to the written law of God, and to the feeling of com- passion implanted in the heart, to kill innocent ani- mals for our daily sustenance. We are well aware, however, that objections will be brought from scrip- ture against this doctrine, as, for instance: ‘ Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you,’ &c. But it should be recollected that every moving thing that liveth is not fit for meat: people do not eat lizards, worms, flies, serpents, and dogs. Again : 4 Not that which goeth into the mouth defiles the man *—But does any man imagine that, by this de- claration, our Saviour meant to give full licence to gluttony and intemperance—that a man might swal- low poison—or that he might eat anything which the law of God forbade to be eaten ? The sense in which the words were used must be gathered from the rea- son and the occasion of their being spoken, which was this—The Pharisees, being offended, murmured at the disciples of Jesus for sitting down to meat with unwashen hands : in answer to them, Jesus says,4 Not that which goeth into the mouth defiles’ &c.; that is to say, not a little soil or filth taken into the mouth, by eating with unwashen hands, can be said to defile a man, &c. This is the plain and obvious sense of the words. Besides, these words were spoken twenty years before the Apostolic decree, which appears to forbid the use of animal food to the Gentiles; and would the Apostles make a decree in direct contradic- tion to the declaration of Jesus?

Blanch and beat four ounces of bitter and two ounces of sweet almonds with a little rose-water, a pound of sifted sugar, the whites of two eggs well beaten, and a table-spoonful of flour ; drop them into balls about the size of a nutmeg ; and bake them on wafer paper. 729. Sponge Cake. Grate the rind of a lemon to the yolks of seven eggs, beat them and five whites separately; boil a pound of loaf-sugar in a quarter of a pint of water, pour it boiling hot upon the eggs and lemon-peel, whisk it immediately very well for twenty minutes, then stir in three-quarters of a pound of flour well dried and sifted; put it immediately in moulds, and bake it in a moderately hot oven. If baked in two they will take near an hour. Be careful always to have your mould quite dry ; rub it all over the inside with clarified butter, then dust pounded sugar over it; tie a slip of white paper round the mound, fill it with the mixture about three parts full; when done, let the cake stand awhile be- fore it is turned out. 730. Turk's Cake. Take eight eggs, and the weight of them in fine sugar sifted, and the weight of six in flour ; beat the whites to a snow, then beat the yolks, mix these with the sugar, and whisk it very well, grate the rind of a lemon to the flour, beat all well together ; bake it an hour and a half, in a mould called a Turkâ€™s cap.

287 PICKLES, &C. 883. Sugar Vinegar. To six gallons of water, take nine pounds of brown sugar, the whites of four eggs well beaten, put in while the water is cold ; when near bailing, skim it well, and boil it a quarter of an hour; put it in a cask when about new-milk warm, with a little yeast spread on a toast; keep it in rather a warm place, stirring it frequently; the oftener it is stirred the sooner it will be ready for use. 884. Sugar Vinegar. To one gallon of water, put one pound and a half of sugar, dissolve the sugar in part of the water over the fire till it will make the whole just warm, then put it in a cask with a little alum and a little yeast, bung it up very lightly, and let it stand in a warm place till sour, then bottle it. Do not wash your cask, and the next making will be ready in a much shorter time. 885. Another way. Boil ten pounds of coarse sugar, twelve gallons of water, and half a pound of brown bread together for one hour, then take out the bread, and pour the liquor into an open vessel to cool, and on the following day add half a pint of yeast. Let it stand twelve or four- teen days, and then put it in a cask, and set it in the sun till sufficiently sour, which will commonly be in about six months. The bung-hole must merely have a bit of slate over it. 886. Gooseberry Vinegar. Take three gallons of water, and four quarts of gooseberries bruised ; place the whole in a tub, in which it must remain three days, being stirred often; then strain it off, and add to every gallon of liquor

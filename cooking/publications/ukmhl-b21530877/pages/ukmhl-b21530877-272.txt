258 PRESERVED FRUITS, JELLIES, &C. put three-quarters of a pound of sugar to every pound of apple into a preserving-pan, let it boil gently over a moderate fire, skimming it well. Put it into sweet- meat pots when of a proper thickness. Pears may be prepared in the same way ; or they may be mixed with apples. 803. Quince Marmalade. Pare, core, and quarter the quinces, boil them gently in water till they begin to soften, but do not cover them in boiling; strain through a hair-sieve and beat them in a mortar to a pulp; allow to every pound of pulp three-quarters of a pound of fine sugar; boil till the marmalade is stiff, then put it into pots. 804. Orange Marmalade. Rasp Seville oranges, or pare them very thin, then cut them in quarters, and take out the pulp quite clean; tie the rinds in thin cloths and set them on the fire to boil, changing the water three or four times to take out the bitterness; when quite tender, take them out and cut them in thin chips; take out all the seeds and skins from the pulp, and mix it with some lemon-juice, put it to the sliced orange ; and to every pound of fruit take a pound and a half of good loaf-sugar and a pint of water; set the sugar and water on the fire, and when it has boiled ten minutes, put in the orange, let it boil rather quickly, stirring it constantly ; when quite clear, pour it into pots or glasses. Lemon marmalade may be made the same way. Smooth Orange Marmalade may be made as above, only the rinds, instead of being cut into chips, must be pounded in a mortar, and gradually mixed with the syrup ; boil it till clear.

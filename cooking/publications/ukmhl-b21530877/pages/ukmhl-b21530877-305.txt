PICKLES, &C. 291 899. Elder Vinegar. Strip elder-flowers from the stalk, and dry them on a sheet of paper; when quite dry, put them into glass bottles, and fill the bottles up with vinegar ; cork them close ; it will be ready for use in five or six weeks. Put half a peck to a gallon. 900. Cucumber Vinegar. Put fifteen large cucumbers, pared and sliced thin, into a jar with a quart of vinegar, four onions sliced, a few eshalots, a little garlic, a very little Cayenne pepper, a little white pepper and salt; let it stand four days, then strain it off and bottle it with some whole pepper. 901. Essence of Vinegar. During a hard frost, expose vinegar to the weather in shallow vessels ; the watery parts will freeze* but the spirit will remain fluid. Repeatedly expose the fluid as it is obtained, and if the season be very cold, a pint of strong vinegar will be reduced, by the fre- quent exposure, to about a table-spoonful of fine- flavoured essence, and very pungent. 902. Vinegar in Balls. Take bramble-berries when about half ripe, dry them, and then beat them to powder, make it up into balls with strong vinegar, as large as nuts, dry them very well, and keep them in boxes. When wanted for use, dissolve a ball in some stale ginger-beer, or vinegar that is not so sour and good as you wish, and it will become strong vinegar. Green bramble-berries, put into good sherbet or wine, will make good vinegar in a few hours. 2 c 2

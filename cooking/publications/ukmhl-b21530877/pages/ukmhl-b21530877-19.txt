5 INTRODUCTION. b 3 killed, without feelings of compassion: this feeling of the heart, implanted by the Deity, should be consi- I dered as a guide to human conduct. Had the Creator intended man to be an animal of prey, would He have implanted in his breast an in- ! stinct so adverse to His purpose ?

Then ought we to induce others to commit what we cannot freely commit our- selves? Wild beasts of the field will seldom kill, unless impelled by hunger or in self-defence: what excuse then can we have for such a practice, while we have so many delicious fruits and vegetables ? If we attend to the anatomy of the human body, it seems as if man was formed by nature to be a frugi- vorous animal; and that he only becomes an animal of prey by acquired habit. The form and disposition of the intestines is very similar to that of the ouran- outang, or man of the woods, an animal which lives On fruit and vegetables. It has also been remarked that all carnivorous animals have a smooth and uni- form colon, and all herbivorous animals a cellulated one. Nor do we appear to be adapted by nature to the use of animal food from the conformation of the teeth. The carnivorous animals, such as lions, tigers, wolves, dogs, &c., have their teeth long, sharp, and uneven, with intervals between them ; but the herbi- vorous animals, such as horses, cows, sheep, goats, &c., have their teeth short, broad, blunt, adjoining

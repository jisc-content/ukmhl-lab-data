BREAD, BUN9, &C. 204 637. Common Crumpets. Take a pint and a half of milk, just warm, mix with it five table-spoonsful of good yeast; when it has stood to settle, pour it off by degrees into two pounds of flour and a little salt, stirring it till well-mixed, beat it till it become a thick batter. A small portion of salt of tartar dissolved in a little milk (in the pro- portion of about a tea-spoonful to two pounds of flour) and stirred well in, is a great improvement. When well-risen, bake them as above. 638. Potato Crumpets. Grate some potatoes of the most mealy kind into some clean water, rub them through a hair-sieve, addin g plenty of water, then pour off the water, leav- ing the starch quite clear at the bottom ; mix it with the potatoes, and to about three pounds of potatoes, mix half a pound of flour, an egg, and a little salt; bake them in the same manner as crumpets, and but- ter them hot. A spoonful of yeast may be added. 639. Muffins. To three pounds of the finest flour, take a pint and a half of warm milk and water, with some good yeast well-purified, and a little salt, strain the liquor into the flour, and beat it a quarter of an hour; set it an hour to rise, put it into pieces the size of an egg, roll them in the hand like balls, put them on a cloth dredged well with flour, and laid on the hearth; lay a clean flannel over them as you roll them up, also keep the dough closely-covered the whole of the time. All the dough being rolled into balls, those first done will be ready for baking, and will spread out into the right form for muffins; lay them on the heated plate or stone, and as the bottom begins to change colour, turn them on the other side, but be careful they do not burn.

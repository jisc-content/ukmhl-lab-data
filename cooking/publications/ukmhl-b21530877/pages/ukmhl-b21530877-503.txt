33 MISCELLANIES, MRS. SIDDONS, HER LIFE, TIMES, AND CONTEMPORARIES. By THOMAS CAMPBELL, ESQ., > To whom she bequeathed the necessary materials for the express purpose. “ Mrs. Siddons has found a fitting biographer in the poet Campbell. Simple, ele- gant, and noble in style, as was the wondrous creature whose extraordinary career the work describes, it at once enchains the reader’s attention.”—Bell’s New Weekly Mes- senger. “ Mrs. Siddon’s own Memoranda, in these volumes, display a deep and heart- j searching knowledge of human motives and feelings; they must be invaluable to actors, as proving by what patient and intense study she obtained that perfection which was, and is, and, we sincerely believe, will remain without a rival.”—Athe- fuBum. “ A Life of Mrs. Siddons, by Mr. Campbell the poet, cannot but strongly excite the curiosity of the public. We have read it through with an interest proportionate to the eminence of the parties; we never forget that a man of genius is the author, nor fail to recognise those touches of fine poetic feeling, and especially those felici- tous similes, for which Mr. Campbell’s criticisms are always remarkable.”—Leigh t Hunt’s London Journal. 111 " The impress of the immortal genius of the author is visible in every page of the work. In sentiments, manly, dignified, and ennobled ; in feeling, warm, generous, and enthusiastic; in language, pure, natural, and classically elegantthe Life of Siddons, by the bard of the Pleasures of Hope, is a book of great, of transcendent merit: it is, in one word, a pattern of biography.”—True Sun.

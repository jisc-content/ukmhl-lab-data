Take large fresh mushrooms, peel and wash them, dry them in a clean cloth; put a little olive-oil and butter into the frying-pan, put them in the gilled side upwards, sprinkle a little pepper and salt over them, and as they discharge their liquor, take it out of the pan and keep it hot. When they are enough, put them on the dish with the following gravy. Put a little butter and flour into the frying-pan, stir it on a slow fire till brown ; add the liquor which has been produced by stewing the parings and stalks of the mushrooms in water, with a little pepper and salt in it; stir it on the fire till it boils, and serve it up in a boat. It makes excellent gravy.

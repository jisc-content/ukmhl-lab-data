13 INTRODUCTION. consideration a few facts which may be the means of furnishing reasonable ground for doubting whether feasting on salmon, by way of fasting from flesh, be quite consonant with the practice of Jesus and his disciples. We learn from Numbers xi. 5, that when the Israelites murmured against Moses, and wished to return to Egypt, they said, * We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cu- cumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic.’ Now, we are informed by Herodotus, that fish was in his time very much used as food in Egypt, many families living entirely upon it: that it was sometimes usedybes/L and some- times roasted. Sometimes they dried it in the sun, then beat it small in a mortar, and afterwards sifted it through a piece of fine cloth; and thus formed it into cakes as bread. This is the very mode in which the Egyptians now prepare the Zofos-plants: they dry them in the sun, roast or broil them ; then having parched the seed within the lotos, whose head re- sembles that of a poppy, they make bread of it. (See Beauties of Nature and Art displayed, vol. xii. p. 141.)—Pococke says, that when he was in Upper Egypt, they told him there was a large fish called lotos, which probably is the lotos that was so highly esteemed by the Egyptians. (See his Travels in Egypt, Pinkerton's Coll. p. lxi. p. 333.)—Water- melons are much eaten in warm climates, which, being moist and cooling, are of course particularly grateful to the palate. These, and several other facts to the same purport which might be adduced, must, at least, lead us to doubt whether Jesus or his disciples did really eat animal fish. And especially, when we know that Parkhurst, in his Greek Lexicon, says, ‘ It seems not very natural to understand the Greek word, opsarion (John xxi. 9), as signifying fish. It signifies some other kind of provision, of the deli- c

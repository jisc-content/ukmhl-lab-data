SPOON-HEAT, &C. 327 let it'simmer gently on the fire, closely covered, an hour and a quarter, and it will be ready to serve. 1008. A Mixture of Rice and Scotch Barley. To one pound of rice and one pound of barley, put two gallons of water, let them boil over a slow fire four hours; before it is taken off the fire, add four ounces of sugar, and one of salt. 1009. Mucilage of Rice. Boil two ounces of fine rice flour with a quarter of a pound of loaf-sugar in a pint of water till like a clear jelly, strain it through a thin cloth ; let it remain till cold ; it affords a pleasant and nourishing jelly. A little cinnamon may be boiled in it, if approved. 1010. Vermicelli with Milk. Put your vermicelli in boiling milk, and stir it quickly to prevents its becoming a paste or doughy. Let it be well salted, or well sugared. Half an hour is sufficient to break the vermicelli. 1011. The best and most simple way of making Water Gruel. Set a pan of water on the fire, then mix as much oat- meal in a basin with cold water, as will make it a proper consistence ; when the water is hot (but not boiling), pour it upon the meal and water, and stir it well; take out the spoon, and leave it to settle about two minutes, then pour it carefully into the pan, leav- ing the coarse part of the meal at the bottom of the basin; set it on the fire, stirring it till it boils, and in five minutes you will have excellent smooth gruel. Do not put any salt in, unless intended to be eaten with pepper and butter. It is very good without anything; a little sugar and nutmeg may, however, be added, if preferred. 2f2

102 SAVOURY PIES, PUDDINGS, &C. be used instead of the turnips. A few mushrooms are a great improvement to a potato pie. 270. Potato Pie. Pare and cut the potatoes, and season them with pep- per and salt as before, butter the bottom of the dish, and put the potatoes in with a little sliced onion or some mushrooms, a tea-cupful of water, and a table- spoonful or more (according to the size of your pie) of tapioca that has been steeped an hour or two in warm water; put on a good crust and bake it. Have ready to eat with it four or five eggs boiled rather hard and chopped small, some butter and hot water, pepper and salt, just boiled up together; serve it up in a sauce-tureen. 271. Savoury raised Pies, to eat cold. Take some cold plain omelet, and some hard-boiled eggs, cut in small pieces, a few sliced potatoes and mushrooms, season them with pepper and salt, put them into good raised crusts, with as much tapioca jelly as will nearly fill up the pies, lay some bits of butter on the top and close them up. They are very good made with plain omelet and tapioca only, and a little butter. They may be made in small dishes or patty-pans with puff paste, and are considered excellent. 272. Mushroom Pie. Peel some mushrooms, and, if rather large, cut them in pieces, take about the same quantity of potatoes, pared and sliced, season them with pepper and salt, add some butter broken in small pieces, put in a little water, cover it with a good common paste and bake it. Stew the parings and stalks of the mushrooms half an hour in some water, then strain it, and when the pie is baked, put in the gravy.

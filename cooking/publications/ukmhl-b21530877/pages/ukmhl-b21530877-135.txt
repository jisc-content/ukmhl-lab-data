PUDDINGS, &C. 121 of common hasty pudding. Beat the yolks of two eggs with a little salt; take out a few spoonsful of the milk before you put in the bread, to mix with them ; then put it to the bread and stir it over the fire two or three minutes. It must not be suffered to boil. Eat this with sugar and cold butter. It is very good without the eggs. 349. Bread Pudding. Boil a quart of new milk, with a little cinnamon and lemon-peel, five minutes, take out the seasoning, and pour the milk on the crumbs of three twopenny rasps, or French rolls, cover it till cool, then add six well- beaten eggs, sugar, and nutmeg. It may be either boiled or baked. A Savoy pudding may be made the same way, with biscuits instead of bread. 350. Bread Pudding. Take a loaf of white bread, cut a hole in the bottom, add as much good milk as it will absorb, tie it in a cloth and boil it an hour. It may be improved by first boiling the milk with a little cinnamon in it, and when cool, add two or three eggs before it is poured upon the loaf. Serve it up with melted butter, or sweet sauce. 351. Bread and Butter Pudding. Boil gently for five or ten minutes a pint of good milk, with the peel of half a lemon, a little cinnamon, and a spoonful of almond or orange-flower water, then sweeten with good sugar ; break the yolks of five eggs and the whites of three into a basin, beat them well, and add the milk, beat all well together, and strain through a hair-sieve ; have some bread and butter cut very thin, put a layer of it in a pie-dish, and then a layer of currants, and so on till the dish is nearly full, then pour the custard over it, and bake it half an hour. m

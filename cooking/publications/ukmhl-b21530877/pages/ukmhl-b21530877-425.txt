APPENDIX. 411 1267. An improved way of making savoury Fritters. Cut the crusts off some good light bread, then pour some boiling water upon and cover it close, when it has stood a while, drain the water well from it, if any remains, and mash the bread well, adding pepper and salt, sage and onion, parsley, leeks, beet, or any other herbs according to the taste; add well-beaten eggs just when you are ready to fry them. Serve them up in the usual way with brown gravy. The fritters will be much lighter made in this way, and require fewer eggs. 1268. A savoury dish. Five ounces of bread-crumbs, rub them through a co- lander, two ounces of sage minced fine, a large onion I about one ounce and a half, minced fine, mix these together with an egg, some pepper and salt, and a bit of butter the size of a large egg. Bake and baste it with butter, serve it up with brown gravy. 1269. Puree of Green Pease. Take three pints of large green pease fresh gathered, boil them with a handful of parsley, and green onions over a slow fire till they are thoroughly stewed, then j put them in a bowl and pound them well, and rub them through a sieve ; moisten this puree with a little I cream and butter, but do not let it boil or the pease will lose their colour, but set on a corner of the stove : just at the time when you serve it up, put in square slices of bread nicely fried. The same made very green. Take pease, parsley, and green onions, as before, boil very quickly in salt and water, when tender drain, and pound them well, when you rub it through the sieve, moisten with a little of the water, season with salt and 2 n 2

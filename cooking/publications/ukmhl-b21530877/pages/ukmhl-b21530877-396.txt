Roast a decayed onion; when done, take out the soft pithy part, and apply it hot to the corns, after being well pared ; then lay over it a diachylon plas- ter, spread on thin leather, with a very small hole cut in the centre: by repeating this three or four successive nights, the corns will be removed.

Another.â€”After bathing the feet in warm water at bed-time, till the corn becomes softened, pare it down with a knife, but not to make it bleed; then wet the surface with saliva, and rub it over with the lunar caustic, extending it round the edges of the corn, continuing it till such a quantity adheres to it, as will shortly change it to a dark grey, and eventually black. There is no danger to be apprehended in applying too much, especially on the corn itself: a little lint or cotton wool should then be applied, to prevent the part coming in contact with the stocking. In five or six days, the part acted upon by the caus- tic will peel off, including every vestige of the corn, leaving the part quite smooth and natural. Another easy remedy is, to bathe the feet, half an hour, two or three successive nights, in a pretty strong solution of soda. The alkali dissolves the cuticle, and the corn falls out spontaneously, leaving a small cavity, which soon fills up.

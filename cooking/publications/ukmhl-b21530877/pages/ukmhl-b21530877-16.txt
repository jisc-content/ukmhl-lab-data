INTRODUCTION. 2 That a vegetable diet is more favourable to health there can be little doubt. The nations that subsist on this kind of food are strong, robust, and capable of enduring the greatest fatigue; and it is generally admitted that the long lives of the primitive race of men must, in a great degree, be attributed to the wholesomeness of the food on which mankind then lived. On the other hand, we have the testimony of several eminent characters, both ancient and modern, that many of the diseases with which mankind are afflicted may be ascribed to the eating of animal food. Dr. Lambe has clearly demonstrated that not a few of the diseases with which the people of this country are afflicted may be attributed to this baneful diet. An eminent physician of Paris, in a work published some years ago, has also shown that numerous dis- eases are caused or increased by the eating of animal flesh. It is generally allowed that the eating of swine’s flesh is the principal cause of the scurvy, and that a vegetable diet is absolutely necessary to effect a com- plete cure.

100 SAVOURY PIES, PUDDINGS, &c. 263. Herb Pie. Take lettuce, spinach, beets, a little parsley, and a little sweet leek (or a small onion and a leaf or two of sage), cut them, and season with pepper and salt; lay them in a dish with some butter and water, put a cup in the middle of the dish, lay a crust over and bake it; when the pie is enough, take out the cup and pour in three well-beaten eggs, lay on the crust again, and set it in the oven a minute or two before it is taken to the table. 264. Herb Pie. Take lettuce, beets, leeks, spinach, and parsley, of each a handful, give them a boil, then chop them small; have ready a pint of groats and two or three sliced onions boiled in a cloth, put all together in a frying-pan with half a pound of butter, a little salt, and a few apples cut thin, stew them over the fire a few minutes; fill your dish, and lay over it a good crustâ€”or bake it in a raised crust. The above quan- tity will make a large pie. 265. Herb Pie. Pick a handful of parsley, the same quantity of spi- nach, two lettuces, mustard and cress, white beet- leaves, and a small onion, wash and boil them a little, drain, press out the water, cut them small, mix and lay them in a dish sprinkled with salt. Mix a batter with a little flour, two eggs well beaten, half a pint of cream or good milk; pour it on the herbs, cover it with a paste, and bake it.

200 BREAD, BUNS, &C. mix all together with as much skimmed milk as will make it a very stiff paste, knead it, and beat it with a paste roller till perfectly smooth; cover with a cloth, and let it stand an hour and a half or two hours, then roll it out as thin as possible, cut the cakes with a tin cutter, and prick them with a stamp made with wire for the purpose the size of the bis- cuit, bake them on tins in rather a quick oven. The paste must be very stiff, or the biscuits will not be nice. They will keep good for many weeks in a dry place. 625. Excellent Biscuits. To a pound of flour put a little salt and one egg well beaten, mix it up with as much water (with a tea-spoon- ful of yeast) as will make it up in a stiff paste, knead it till quite smooth, cover it up close half an hour, then roll it out, and put in a quarter of a pound of butter, as for puff paste, dredge with flour, and roll it out well, stamp or prick, and cut it in squares or any form you please, bake in rather a quick oven. 626. Abemethy Biscuits. To seven pounds of flour, one quart of new milk, half a pound of butter, half a pound of loaf-sugar, add two ounces of caraway-seeds ; mix and knead them very well together, then roll them out, cut and stamp them with a block. Bake them in a quick oven. 627. Plain Crisp Biscuits. Take a pound of flour, the yolks of two eggs well- beaten, and a quarter of a pint of new milk, make it up in a stiff paste, knead it well and beat it with the paste roller, till quite smooth, then roll it out very thin, cut it into biscuits, and bake them in rather a quick oven; they should be quite dry and crisp.

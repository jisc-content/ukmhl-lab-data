SALADS, &C. 89 ones, and season them well with salt, cream and vine- gar. Add sugar, if approved. 219. Boiled Salad. Take boiled or baked onions, (if Portugal the better,) some baked beet root, cauliflower, or brocoli, and boiled celery, or French beans, or any of these arti- cles, with the common salad dressing ; add to this, to give it an enticing appearance, and to give some of the crispness and freshness so pleasant in salad, a small quantity of raw endive, or lettuce and chervil, or burnet, strewed on the top. This is considered more wholesome than the raw salad, and is much esteemed. 220. Dressing for Salad. Boil a cotiple of eggs for twelve minutes, and put them in a basin of cold water for a few minutes; the yolfcs must be quite cold and hard, or they will not incorporate with the ingredients. Rub them through a hair-sieve with a wooden spoon, or very smooth in a basin, and mix them with a table-spoon- ful of water, or very rich cream, then add two table- spoonsful of oil, or melted butter; when these are well mixed, add, by degrees, a tea-spoonful of salt, the same of made mustard, and a little powdered lump-sugar; when these are smoothly united, add very gradually three table-spoonsful of vinegar, rub it with the other ingredients till thoroughly incorpo- rated with them. Put this sauce in the dish, and lay the cut herbs lightly over it, and garnish with beet- root sliced and marked, rings of the white of eggs, young radishes, &c. Let the sauce remain at the bottom of the bowl, and do not stir up the salad till it is to be eaten. Onions may be served separately on a small dish.

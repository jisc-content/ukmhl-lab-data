117 PUDDINGS, &C. 332. Arrow-root Pudding. To a pint of boiling milk add two ounces of arrow- root, previously mixed smooth with a little cold milk, set it on the fire and let it boil, constantly stirring it; when cool, add three eggs, a few bitter almonds blanched and beaten, lemon-peel, and sugar ; bake it in a moderate oven. 333. Boiled Arrow-root Pudding. Set a pint of milk on the fire, mix two ounces of arrow-root with a little cold milk quite smooth like starch; when the milk is near boiling, pour it upon the arrow-root, stirring it all the time, return it into the pan and set it on the fire a few minutes to thicken, but do not let it boil, stirring it briskly ; when cold, add three eggs well-beaten and a little salt, boil it an hour in a buttered basin. Serve it up with melted butter and currant-jelly. 334. Batter Pudding. ! To three or four well-beaten eggs, add a little milk, salt, and six spoonsful of flour, beat it well with a wooden spoon till the batter is quite smooth ; add as much more milk as will make it of a proper consistence; boil it in a buttered basin, with a cloth tied tight over it, an hour and a half, or in a cloth without the basin, an hour and a quarter. In boiling puddings, the water should never be allowed to cease from boiling. 335. Common Batter Pudding. Beat two eggs very well, put to them about the third of a pint of milk, a little salt, and as much flour as will make it a stiff batter; when quite smooth, thin it by degrees with the remainder of the milk ; boil it an hour and a quarter, or butter a dish and bake it in a quick oven.

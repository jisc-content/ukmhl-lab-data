Make a ball of woollen cloth, or flannel, so that you can hold it conveniently in your hand, shake up the contents of the bottle, and put a little upon the ball, then touch the ball with linseed oil, with your finger, cover the ball with a clean linen rag, then apply it to the furniture, and it will produce a beautiful polish. 1245.

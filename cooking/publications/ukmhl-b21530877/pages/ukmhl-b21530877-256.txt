242 PRESERVED FRUIT, JELLIES, &C. carefully into small jars, laying a bit of stick cross- wise to prevent the fruit from rising ; boil the syrup a little longer, and when clear, pour it upon the apricots. Green-gages and Orlean plums (dividing them) may be done in the same way, leaving out the ginger. 751. Green Apricots. Gather the apricots just before they begin to ripen, lay vine or apricot leaves at the bottom of the pan, and the fruit in layers, with leaves between, and when all the fruit is in, put plenty of leaves on the top ; fill the pan with spring water, and cover it close, set the pan at a distance from the fire, where they can be gradu- ally heated, and remain in a moderate heat for several hours till they become rather soft, but not cracked; take out the fruit very carefully and drain it; make a thin syrup with some of the water, allowing a pound of sugar to a pint and a half of water; when cold, pour it on the fruit in a preserving-pan, set it on a very slow fire, or on a stove, till the apricots green, but on no account to boil or crack; remove them very carefully into an earthen pan, and let them stand in the syrup for three days, then pour off as much as will be requisite, adding more sugar to make a good syrup, and a little white ginger sliced ; boil it till clear, and when cold, pour it on the fruit after being well drained from the thin syrup, which will serve to sweeten pies. Cover them when cold with tissue paper. If the fruit is not so green as it ought to be, a small piece of alum boiled in the syrup will improve the colour. 752. Magnum,-Bonvm Plums; excellent as a Sweet- meat or in Tarts, but not good to be eaten raw. Prick the plums with a needle, and slit the skin at the seam with a sharp knife, simmer them very gently

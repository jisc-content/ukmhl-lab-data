■270 PRESERVED FRUITS, JELLIES, &C. The Americans fold them singly in papers, instead of laying cloths between the layers. 844. Another way to preserve Apples. Put a layer of apples and a layer of dried fern alter- nately in boxes, and cover them quite close: fern never gives the apples a musty taste, which straw is very apt to do. Chaff, or the husks of oats, answer very well for keeping either apples or winter pears. 845. Another. Dry a glazed jar perfectly well, put a few pebbles in the bottom ; fill the jar with apples, and cover it with a bit of wood made to fit exactly, and over that put a little fresh mortar. The pebbles attract the damp of the apples, and the mortar draws the air from the jar, and leaves the apples free from its pres- sure, which, together with the principle of putrefac- tion contained in the air, are the causes of decay. Apples have been thus kept quite sound and juicy till July. 846. Another. Apples, after remaining on the trees as long as safety from frost will admit, should be taken immediately from the trees to close casks, and kept as dry and cool as possible; if suffered to lie on the floor for weeks, as is frequently the case, they wither and lose their flavour. A much approved way of preserving them for spring, is to put them in dry sand as soon as gathered, about the middle or end of October, (drying the sand in the summer, and keeping it dry for the purpose,) put the apples in layers, with sand between each layer. The sand keeps the apples from the air—it checks the evaporation of the apples—thus preserving

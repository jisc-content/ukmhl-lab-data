Boil some eggs hard, take out the yolks and mash them with a little butter, add some bread-crumbs, some chopped parsley, beets, and sweet leek or a little onion, pepper and salt, mix them up with well- beaten eggs, till it will adhere together. Melt a little butter in a Dutch oven, then put in the force- meat, and roast it before the fire till of a good brown, basting it now and then with a little butter; when done, serve it up with brown gravy, to which may be added the whites of the eggs, cut as for egg-sauce, if approved. 86. Another. Take bread crumbs, some butter, either rubbed in the bread or melted, parsley, chives or sweet leeks, mush- rooms chopped, two raw eggs, salt, Cayenne pepper, and a little cream : mix all well together, and bake it, or fry it in balls. 87.

394 USEFUL FAMILY RECEIPTS. 1211. For recent Cuts or Wounds. Moisten a piece of lint with a saturated solution of copal gum in ether, moisten the lint with it once or twice a-day, without removing it. If the wound be a cut, care should be taken to close the edges together, before the lint is applied. 1212. For a Sprain. Take a pint of alegar, half an ounce of saltpetre* and an ounce of spirit of turpentine ; stir them to- gether until the nitre is dissolved; then warm it a little, and rub well the part affected twice or thrice a-day, keeping it warm with flannel folded round it. 1213. Plaster for a Sprain. Mix a little Venice turpentine with flour and the yolk of an egg; spread it on leather. 1214. To warm Beds. When you put the hot cinders in the pan, take out all the black or blazing coals, if any, and throw in a small handful of salt; this will in some degree prevent the smell of sulphur, which is so disagreeable and offensive. The following method is more cleanly, and is decidedly a better way. Fill a few stone bottles with boiling water (tying down the corks); put them in the bed half an hour or more before going to bed, and let them remain till you are ready to get into bed. A piece of iron chain heated and put into the pan is perhaps still better. A large stone bottle that will hold five or six quarts, filled with boiling water, and wrapped up in the bed-clothes, will keep warm, at least two days, in cold weather; of course, it is an easy way of airing beds which are not in regular use.

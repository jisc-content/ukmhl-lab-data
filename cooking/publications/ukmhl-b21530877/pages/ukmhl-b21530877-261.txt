PRESERVED FRUIT, JELLIES, &C. 247 761. Jargonel Pears. Pare them very thin, before they are quite ripe, and simmer in a thin syrup; let them lie a day or two ; then make the syrup richer, and simmer again, repeat this till they are clear, then drain, and dry them in the sun, or a cool oven, for a short time. They may be kept in the syrup and dried as wanted, as it makes them more moist and rich. 762. To preserve Ripe Fruit without Sugar. The gooseberries, currants, cherries, raspberries, &c. should not be too ripe: being ready picked, fill bot- tles with the fruit till they will hold no more, allow- ing room for the cork; and in filling, shake the bottles frequently. When filled, cork each bottle lightly, and then proceed to scald the fruit. This operation may be performed over a slow fire, either in a copper, or large kettle, first putting a cloth at the bottom to prevent the heat from cracking the bottles. The copper must be filled with cold water, so as nearly to cover the bottles, which must be put into the water rather slanting till they reach the bot- tom, in order to expel the air that might lodge in the cavity at the bottom of them. The bottles should not touch the bottom or sides of the copper, and the heat of the fire should be such as gradually to raise the water in the copper to the temperature of 160 or 170 degrees by a brewing thermometer, in the course of about three-quarters of an hour. For want of an instrument of this kind, the proper temperature may be determined by the finger, to which it will feel very I hot, but will not scald. If the water should become | too hot, a little cold water must be added to it, and when it has acquired the proper degree of heat, it I must be kept at it as steadily as possible for about an j hour, but not longer, as a greater heat, or a longer I time, is liable to crack the fruit.

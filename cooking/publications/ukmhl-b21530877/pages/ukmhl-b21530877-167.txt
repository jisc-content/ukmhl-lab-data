Rice Eggs. Wash very clean in warm water three ounces of rice, boil it in a pint of new milk till soft, pour it into small saucers about the size of an egg when poached, or a little larger; the next day turn them out of the saucers and lay half of a preserved apricot on each. They are equally good with any other kind of pre- served fruit. Blanc-mange put in saucers in the same way has still more the appearance of eggs. 466. Vermicelli Budding. Take four ounces of vermicelli, boil it in a pint of new milk, with a stick of cinnamon, till it is soft, then put in half a pint of cream, a little butter, the yolks of four eggs, sweeten it, and bake it in a dish without paste. 467. Dish of Rice and Apples. Blanch some of the best rice, strain it, and set it to boil in milk, with lemon-peel and a bit of cinnamon; let it boil till the rice is dry, then cool it, and raise a rim three inches high round the dish, having rubbed the dish over with egg, to make it stick; then egg the rice all over. Fill the dish half way up with mar- malade of apples; have ready the whites of four eggs beaten to a fine froth, and put them over the marma- lade, then sift the sugar over and set it in the oven, which should be hot enough to give it a beautiful colour.

BREAD, BUNS, &C. 396 it in such a degree as to leave part of it quite dry. Having thus scalded the corn-flour, lay it out in small lumps on a clean board to cool; then take it and rub it well into the two-thirds of wheat-flour; this being done, the whole will appear like dry flour, then proceed as directed in No. 611, to set the sponge, to let it rise, to make the dough and bake it. The finer the wheat flour is, the more water it will absorb; but the very finest of wheat-flour will not absorb so much water, pound for pound, as corn- flour. 615. Potato-Flour. The potatoes must be clean washed, pared, and lightly grated into an earthen pan of cold water ; let it stand till the pulp falls to the bottom and the water begins to clear, then pour off the water, and add a good deal more of spring water, stirring the pulp with your hand ; rub it through a hair-sieve, pouring plenty of water upon it in passing through the sieve ; let the water stand till the farina subsides and the water clears, then pour the water gently off, add fresh water several times; then put the farina upon earthen dishes before the fire, covered with paper to keep out the dust; when quite dry, pound or roll it to a fine powder, and sift it through a lawn sieve. The fibre that remains in the sieve may be used with wheat-flour in making bread, as directed in the following receipt. The potato-flour keeps well in tin canisters or bottles, and may be very usefully applied to a variety of purposes. 616. Potato-Flour. Twelve pounds of wheat-flour kneaded with six pounds of the fibre of potatoes, will produce, when well baked, twenty-one pounds of excellent bread. The mode of preparing the fibre is as follows:â€”

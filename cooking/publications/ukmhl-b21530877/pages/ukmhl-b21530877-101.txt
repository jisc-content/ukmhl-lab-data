Take sorrel, chervil, beet-leaves, purslain, parsley, chives, and cucumbers, if in season, in quantities pro- portioned to the strength of each. Pick these care- fully, wash them several times, and set them to drain. Then chop them, and press them with the hands, that little or no water may remain. Put a good piece of butter into a pan, and the herbs upon it, with as much salt as will salt them well. Stew them over a slow fire till they are well done, and there is no liquor remaining. Let them stand to cool, and then put them into nice clean pots. The smaller the consumption of them is likely to be, the smaller the pots must be, as, when once they are opened, the herbs will not keep at farthest more than three weeks. When the herbs are quite cold in the pots, melt some butter, and when it is no more than lukewarm, pour it over the herbs. Let them stand till the hutter is well congealed, then tie paper over the pots, and set them in a place neither too hot nor too cold. They will keep till Easter, and are very useful during the winter. When wanted for soup, put as much as there is oc- casion for into some broth made without salt, and the soup is prepared at once. If to be used as sauce, put them into a saucepan with a piece of butter, boil them very quick, and add three yolks of eggs with some milk. This sauce may be served with hard eggs. The best time for preserving these herbs is about the end of September. 2

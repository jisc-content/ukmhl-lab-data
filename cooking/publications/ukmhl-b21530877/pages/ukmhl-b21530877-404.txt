390 USEFUL FAMILY RECEIPTS. 1194. Burns and Scalds. In numerous cases of burns and scalds, the applica- tion of carded cotton has succeeded in effecting a cure in a few days. When the discharge exudes through the first layer, more cotton must be added to absorb it. In order that it may adhere to the injured part, the surface should be moistened with oil. The whole will peel off in a few days. When carded cotton is not at hand, apply oatmeal and cold soft water immediately, as a poultice ; when it dries, wet the meal again, and do not suffer it to be- come hard. In bad cases, keep the poultice on two or three days, occasionally moistening it with a little water. 1195. Burns and Scalds. When a burn or scald is trifling, and occasions no blister, it is sufficient to put a compress of several folds of soft linen upon it, dipped in cold water, and to renew it every quarter of an hour till the pain is entirely removed. Spirit of turpentine is an excellent thing for ex- tracting the fire, if it be applied immediately; also lime-water, and linseed or olive oil, of each four ounces, mixed well together, renewing the.application frequently. This liniment is extremely useful, if applied in time, in preventing the inflammation subsequent to scalds and burns, or even in removing it after it has taken place. 1196. Poultice for Burns and Scalds. Take an equal weight of brown sugar and onions sliced, beat them well together in a mortar to a pulp, and lay it on the part affected. Renew the poultice daily.

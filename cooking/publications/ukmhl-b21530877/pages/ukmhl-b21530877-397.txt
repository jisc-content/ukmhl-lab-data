383 USEFUL FAMILY RECEIPTS, 1172. Remedy for Warts. Cut the stem of a celandine, and rub the warts fre- quently with the yellow liquid which issues from it; or rub them with the juice of onions; but there is nothing more safe or certain than spirit of turpen- tine, applied twice a-day, with the point of a very small stick.

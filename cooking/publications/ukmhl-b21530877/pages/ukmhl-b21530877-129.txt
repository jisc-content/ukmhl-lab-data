115 PUDDINGS, &C. in a pie-dish, and pour over them a nice light batter, prepared as for batter pudding, and bake an hour in a moderate oven. 325. Boston Apple Pudding. Peel one dozen of good apples, take out the cores, cut them small, put them into a stewpan that will just hold them, with a little water, a little cinnamon, and the peel of a lemon ; stew over a slow fire till quite soft, drain the water from them, then sweeten with moist sugar, and pass it through a hair-sieve; add to it the yolks of four eggs and one white, a quarter of a pound of good butter, half a nutmeg, the peel of a lemon grated, and the juice of one lemon; beat all well together, line the inside of a pie-dish with good puff paste, put in ihe pudding, and bake it half an hour. 326. Apple Pudding with Cream. Grate four large apples, add to them a quarter of a pound of Naples biscuits grated, a little powdered cinnamon, half a pint of cream, sugar to the taste, a little salt, and six eggs well beaten, leaving out half the whites. Bake it with a crust round the edge of the dish ; when done, sift powdered sugar over it. 327. Apple and Bread Pudding. Pare and cut some apples as for a pie, put a little sugar to them, cover them and set them in a mode- rate oven till they begin to soften ; then take them out, and when nearly cold, cover them well with bread that has been soaked in warm milkâ€”or set the bread and milk, covered with a plate, in a moderate oven till the bread has absorbed the milk. An egg or two may be added to the milk, if preferred, but it is a very wholesome and good pudding without eggs.

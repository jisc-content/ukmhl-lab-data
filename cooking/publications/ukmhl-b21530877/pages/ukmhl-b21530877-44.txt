SOUPS, &c. 30 or four quarts of boiling vegetable broth, boil or simmer gently half an hour longer till the potatoes are dissolved, then rub it through a sieve, and sea- son to the taste; when it boils up again, take it off the fire, and add a pint of cream that has been boiled. 20. Herb Soup. Melt five ounces of butter in a stewpan with a little flour and water, when hot, slice into it four good sized onions, and shake the pan well over the fire for five minutes; cut very small two or three roots of celery, two handsful of spinach, a cabbage lettuce, and some parsley; put them into the pan with the onions. Set it over the fire till the vegetables are well done, stirring them pretty often; then mix in a little flour, Cayenne pepper, salt, some crusts of stale white bread, and two quarts of boiling water; stir the whole well together, and let it stew half an hour. Before you serve it up, add the yolks of two eggs well beaten, and a spoonful of vinegar, but do not let it boil again. The green part of asparagus is a pleasant addition, cut into the soup with the other vegetables. 21. Another Soup. Take four ounces of butter cut in pieces and put it in a stewpan, set it over the fire to brown a little, then take three or four onions sliced, three heads of celery, two handsful of spinach, a small cabbage, two or three turnips, two cabbage-lettuces, parsley, pepper, and salt to your taste; stew these gently about half an hour, then put to them two quarts of water, let them simmer till the roots become quite tender, when any part of them may be taken out, and the remainder served up in the soup.

Fresh Currant Water. Squeeze a quart of fresh currants through a sieve with your hands, put in two table spoonsful of pow- dered sugar, squeeze in a lemon, and add a quart of water. A very refreshing and delicious liquor may be made in the same way, from any kind of fresh, ripe, juicy fruit. 973. Currant, Cherry, Strawberry, and Rasp- berry Waters. Mash any of the above fruits, adding a little water, j then strain it through a sieve, and afterwards through a flannel bag ; more water must then be added, with clarified or capillaire syrup (Nos. 923, 924), to the taste ; strain it again through the bag, and serve it up l quite fresh.

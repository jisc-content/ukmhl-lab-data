4 INTRODUCTION. evinced by the different tempers of the carnivorous and herbivorous animals; the former are savage, ferocious creatures, that prowl out at night and seek to destroy all within their reach; the others wander tranquilly on the plains in herds, enjoy themselves in the day, and manifest their innocence by various playful sports with each other.

And the ferocity even of a lion has been greatly abated, and he has been ren- dered tractable, by being fed on vegetable food. The same effect of aliment is discernible among the different nations of men. ‘The Tartars,’ says Sir John Sinclair, ‘ who live principally on animal food, possess a degree of ferocity of mind and fierce- ness of character which forms the leading features of all carnivorous animals. On the other hand, a vege- table diet gives to the disposition, as it appears in the Brahmin and Gentoo, a mildness of feeling directly the reverse of the former.* There can be no doubt, therefore, that the practice of slaughtering and devouring animals has a tendency to strengthen in us a murderous disposition and brutal nature, rendering us insensible to pity, and inducing us more easily to sanction the murdering of our fellow men.

We shall now proceed to show that a vegetable diet ought to be preferred from a principle of human- ity. It cannot be doubted that there exists within us by nature a repugnance to the spilling of blood; and we cannot even see an animal tortured, much less

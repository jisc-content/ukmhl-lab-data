248 PRESERVED FRUIT, JELLIES, &C. fruit is properly scalded, take the bottles, one at a time, out of the copper and fill them up, to within an inch of the place to which the cork will reach, with boiling water, kept in readiness for the purpose, and which may be very conveniently poured into them from a tea-kettle; cork them immediately, pressing the corks down gradually, but make them very tight. In driving the corks the bottles must not be shaken, as that might cause the hot water to break them. When the bottles are corked, lay them on their side, which will cause the corks to swell, and prevent the air from escaping. When cold, they may be removed to a cool, dry place, always observing to let them lie on their side, until required for use. During the first month or two, it is necessary to turn the bottles a little round, once or twice a week, to prevent the fer- mentation that will arise in some fruit from forming into a crust; the turning of the bottles keeps the fruit moist with water, and no mould will ever take place. After the first two months, it will be quite sufficient to turn the bottles a little round once or twice a month. The liquor which is poured from the fruit, makes a very agreeable syrup, when boiled up with sugar. 763. Cucumbers. Take large cucumbers, the greenest possible, and most free from seeds, put them into a broad jar or stew-pot, with a cabbage-leaf over them, cover and set them in a warm place till they turn yellow, then boil the salt and water and pour on them, repeating it till they are green ; then wash them, and set them over a slow fire in clean water, with a bit of alum pounded fine ; and a cabbage-leaf under and over, till they just boil; then take them off and let them re- main till cold; cut them in two, and take out the seeds and soft pulp carefully ; put them in cold spring

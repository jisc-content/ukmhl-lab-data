PIES, TARTS, &C. 158 it through a sieve, put a little butter and the maca- roni into a stewpan, stew it a little, put in some sugar, beaten cinnamon, and half a pint of cream, boil it pretty thick, then cool it, cover the bottom of a tart-pan with puff paste, put in your macaroni with custard over it; bake it a good colour and serve it up. 482. Spinach Tart. Scald some spinach, drain and squeeze it dry, chop and stew it in butter and cream, with very little salt, sugar and bits of citron; and a little orange-flower water, and bake it in puff paste. 483. Cranberry Tart. Having picked and washed the cranberries, put them in a dish, with six ounces of sugar to a quart of fruit, and a little water, line the edges of the dish with paste, and cover it; bake it as other fruit pies. American, Russian, and Swedish cranberries make very excellent tarts. It is not unusual to stew them a little with sugar and a few spoonsful of water, and let them cool previous to being used for tarts. Crow-berry (clusterberry), or bilberry tarts may be made in the same way. 484. Fruit Pasty, or Turnover. Make a hot crust as for raised pies, allowing a little more butter, roll it out quickly and cut it in different forms ; lay apples stewed as for sauce, rhubarb or scalded gooseberries in the crust, with moist sugar, add to apples a little lemon-peel or cinnamon, double up the paste and pinch the edges ; bake in a moderate oven. Turnovers or pasties may be made in the same way, with any kind of solid preserves or jam.

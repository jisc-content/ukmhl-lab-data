Vinegar from Clover-flowers. Take a quartern measure of clover-flowers, half a pound of coarse sugar, and one pound of treacle, to one gallon of water; put the sugar and treacle to the water, and boil them twenty minutes ; when just warm, put a little yeast to it; put the flowers in a vessel, and pour the liquor upon them. Stop it up close, and let it remain till fit for use, which will not be many weeks. 892. Raisin Vinegar. To every two pounds of Malaga raisins put four quarts of spring water, lay a bit of slate on the bung, and set it in the sun till it is fit for use. A large wide-necked stone-bottle will do as well as a cask, if it be kept in the chimney-corner, or near the side of the fire-place a proper time. 893. Vinegar from Crabs. To one peck of crabs bruised, put nine gallons of cold spring water; let them stand about nine days, | covering the tub with a cloth, and stirring them twice every day; then strain the liquor through a hair- cloth, and put into a cask iron-hooped and painted. To every gallon of liquor put one pound of sugar, and stir it in the cask several times to dissolve I the sugar ; set the cask in the sun, and cover it with a bit of slate or tile till ready for use.

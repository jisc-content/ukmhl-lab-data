210 BREAD, BUNS, &C. four spoonsful of molasses (treacle), and stir in as much flour as will mingle it to the consistency of thin batter. Set the whole in the corner of the kitchen fire-place, or in any temperature of moderate warmth, until a fermentation takes place, which will happen in a few hours, then mix it with flour. This will be sufficient, for one baking, for a family of eight or ten persons. 657. The method of making Leaven. (As practised in the Northern Counties.) When leaven is to be first produced, a lump of yeast- dough must be put into an earthen vessel, and set in a cool damp place. In about ten or fourteen days it will be in a proper state to use as a ferment for bread. At every making of bread, a sufficient quantity of the leavened dough should be laid by for leaven against the next baking. The makers of bread with leaven have learnt from experience, that it is best to use the same pan for keeping the leaven, and the same tub for making the bread, without ever washing them. They are kept clean by scraping. It is usual to borrow a piece of leaven to begin with; if this can be done, it is better than to make it for immediate use. 658. To make and preserve Yeast. (As practised in America.) To make it:—Boil a handful of hops in three pints of water three or four minutes ; the water must boil when the hops are put in ; strain the liquor, and then thicken it with flour to the consistence of starch. Let it stand till it is about milk-warm, and put it into a jar large enough to allow room for it to rise; then add a tea-cupful of yeast, and let it work. To preserve it:—After the yeast has risen suffi-

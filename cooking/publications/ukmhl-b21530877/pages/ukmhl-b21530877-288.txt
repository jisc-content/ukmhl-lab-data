274 PRESERVED FRUITS, JELLIES, &C. making a noise, like glass ; when the sugar is at the crack, add to it five or six drops of lemon-juice, to prevent its graining. When boiled, take it from the fire, and set the bottom of the pan into cold water, to prevent its burning. The production of caramel is attended with some difficulty, and great attention is necessary ; the lemon-juice must be used cautiously, as too much would spoil the sugar: if lemon be not at hand, use a few drops of vinegar, honey, or butter; any acid or grease will smooth the sugar, as the sugar has no longer any moisture: it requires a strong fire, but it must be to the body of the sugar only, and not to the sides of the pan, as it is very liable to burn, which will completely spoil it. The edges of the pan must be kept clean with a small clean sponge. Observations on Preserved Fruits. Sweetmeats should be kept in a cool place, but quite free from damp; heat makes them ferment, and damp causes them to mould; they should be looked at several times in the first two months, after they are preserved, that they may be boiled again a little if not likely to keep; they keep best in small jars. \ In preserving gooseberries, currants, &c., it will be found useful to dissolve a part of the sugar in a little juice of fruit or water, to make a thin syrup before the pan is set on the fire, and when hot, put in the fruit, and sugar, (when it is preferred boiling the sugar with the fruit at the first,) and even where that system is not adopted, a little juice or thin syrup will rather prevent the fruit from sticking to the pan, which it is very apt to do, when first set on the fire, without great care. The practice of rubbing the bottom and sides of the pan with a little fresh butter is frequently adopted, and answers very well. It will be found to answer the purpose of economists, to

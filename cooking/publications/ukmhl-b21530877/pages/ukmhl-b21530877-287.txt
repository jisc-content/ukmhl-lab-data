273 PRESERVED FRUITS, JELLIES, &C. 851. Degrees of boiling Sugar. Confectioners have seven essential degrees of boiling sugar, or bases of their art : 1st, thread, large or small; 2nd, pearl; 3rd, the blow; 4th, the feather ; 5th, the ball, large or small; 6th, the crack; 7th, caramel. No. 1. A Thread.—Dip the tip of your fore-finger into the syrup, apply it to the thumb: on parting them you will find a thread, which will break at a little distance, and remain as a drop on the finger; this is the small thread: if the thread be longer, it is the great thread. No. 2. A Pearl.—When you separate the thumb and finger, and the thread reaches, without breaking, from one to the other, it is the small pearl; if the finger and thumb be stretched to their utmost extent, and the thread remain unbroken, it is the large pearl. No. 3. A Blow—may be known, by dipping the skimmer in the sugar, shaking it, and blowing through the holes ; if, in doing this, sparks of light or bub- bles be seen, we may be sure of the blow. No. 4. A Feather.—The larger and greater quan- tity of bubbles, when blown through the skimmer, are the large feather. No. 5. A Ball.—Dip your finger into a glass of cold water, then into your sugar, and into the water again ; if you make the sugar into a small ball, it is the small ball; when larger and harder, it is the great ball. No. 6. A Crack.—Dip the same finger into the sugar, and on taking it out, if the sugar that adheres to it breaks in your finger, with a slight noise, and does not stick to it, it is a crack. Boil it again, and if it breaks on plunging your finger into the water, it is the great crack; you must be very attentive, for it passes rapidly to caramel, if not attended to in a minute. No. 7, A Caramel.—It breaks, as just observed,

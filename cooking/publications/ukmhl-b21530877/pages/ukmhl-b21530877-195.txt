CREAMS, FLUMMERY, &C. 1S1 and the yolk of one egg, give it a scald over the fire and stir it all the time, but do not let it boil; add a little sugar, and let it stand till cold: lay it over the apples with a spoon, and then a whip made the day before as for other trifle. 567. A Froth to set on Trifle or Custard. Sweeten half a pound of the pulp of damsons, or any other scalded fruit, add the whites of four eggs well beaten, beat the pulp with them until it will stand very high, put it on the trifle, &c. with a spoon; it will take any form, and should be rough, to imitate a rock. 568. Cream Sponge. Boil an ounce and a half of isinglass in a quart of good cream, strain, and let it stand to cool, but not to set; take off the yellow rind of a lemon with lump- sugar, and grate the sugar into a bowl; squeeze the juice of the lemon upon it, mix this with the cream, and whisk all together till it begins to stiffen, then put it into moulds, and let it remain all night. 569. Raspberry Sponge. This may be made the same way as cream sponge, using raspberry-juice instead of lemon-juice and rind. Strawberry-sponge is made after the same manner. 570. Lemon Sponge. Dissolve one ounce of isinglass in a pint of water, then strain and let it stand till nearly cold; add half a pound of bruised loaf-sugar, the juice of three lemons, beat the white of one egg to a froth, and add to the otljer ingredients, beat them all together for an hour, then put it into moulds. The rinds of the lemons should be steeped in the water the isinglass is dissolved in. R

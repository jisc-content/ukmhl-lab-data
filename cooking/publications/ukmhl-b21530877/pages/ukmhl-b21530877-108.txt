SAUCES, &C. 94 put all together into melted butter just when it is wanted, as the herbs lose their colour by standing. 237. Gooseberry Sauce. Put some gooseberries into cold water, set them on the fire, and let them simmer very carefully till tender; then drain them and add a little juice of sorrel, a little ginger and some melted butter. It is very good made with plain melted butter and sugar only, or with a little boiled parsley chopped small and put in. 238. Mint Sauce. Take young mint, pick and wash it clean, then chop it fine, put it into a sauce-boat, sprinkle it well with sugar, and pour in vinegar to the taste. 239. Onion Sauce. Boil some large onions in water, till they are tender, changing the water twice ; put them into a colander; when drained, pass them through the colander with a wooden spoon, put them into a clean saucepan, with an ounce of butter, a little salt and a gill of cream; stir all together till it is of a good thickness. 240. Brown Onion Sauce. Slice some large mild Spanish onions, fry them in butter over a slow fire, add some brown gravy, pepper, salt, Cayenne, and a bit of butter rolled in browned flour; skim it, and put in a table-spoonful of mushroom catsup, or a dessert-spoonful of walnut pickle ; it may be flavoured with any pungent vine- gar, minced eschalot, or made mustard ; or made more mild by using celery, turnip, or cucumber, and only half the quantity of onions.

SOUPS, &c* 41 turnips, onions, carrots, parsnips, sweet leeks, and celery, of each in proportion to its strength, adding half a pint of peas. While the soup is preparing, put half a pint of lentils into a small pan, and stew them in a little water or vegetable broth; when soft, pulp them through a sieve. Wash a quarter of a pound of rice very clean, and stew it with a piece of butter and some of the vegetable broth strained quite clear; when it is ready, add to it the lentil cullis or pulp, and season it well. If too thick, put in some more of the broth. Add seasoning to the taste. 52. Another Soup. Melt a quarter of a pound of butter in a pan that will hold three quarts, fill it about half full with carrots and turnips cut into small pieces; set them on the fire a quarter of an hour, shaking them frequently; then add as much water as will nearly fill the saucepan, and after letting it stew for an hour, slice in three large onions, and put in a little rice or pearl barley, washed and steeped in warm water; stew it together two hours longer; about a quarter of an hour before serving up, stir in a tea-cupful of the raspings of bread, some salt, and Cayenne pepper. These preparations are best done over a small char- coal-fire, taking particular care that they stew very gently. 53. Savoy Soup. Take four good-sized Savoy cabbages, cut them in quarters and about half-boil them, strain the water off, and when they are cool, squeeze them as dry as possible, then put them into a pan with as much vegetable broth as will cover them, set them covered close on a moderate fire and let them stew two hours; melt a quarter of a pound of butter in a frying-pan, with a little flour, stirring it till it is a fine brown, Â£ 3

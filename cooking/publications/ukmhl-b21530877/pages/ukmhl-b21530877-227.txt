213 bread, buns, &c. 665. Potato Yeast. Peel and boil a peck of potatoes, mash them very well, put to them about three quarts of boiling water, or as much as will make it about the thickness of yeast, then rub it through a tin colander, and add half a pound or three-quarters of good yeast; put it in an earthen pot and tie it close up, it will keep good several months in cold weather. The bread will require three times more of this than of t, and rather Peel and boil some mealy potatoes till they are soft, and when bruised add as much boiling water as will make them of the consistence of common yeast. To every pound of potatoes put in two ounces of coarse moist sugar or treacle, and two table-spoonsful of good yeast, stirred in while the potatoes are warm. Make this in a vessel large enough to admit of the fermentation, and keep it warm till it has done fer- menting. It will then be fit for use. Let it be kept in the cellar. Put the yeast in a stone jar or wide-necked bottle, pour on it clean water and stir it well; cover the jar close, and set it on the floor in the cellar. By changing the water in summer every two days, it will keep well, and purify it, that it may be used for any kind of bread. 668. To purify and bleach Yeast. Bad yeast may be improved by mixing in it a little flour and sugar with a little warm water, or by bleaching it, that is, beating up the yeast with water equal in quantity to itself, and the white of an egg to a quart of yeast; let it stand twelve hours, then more time to rise. 666.

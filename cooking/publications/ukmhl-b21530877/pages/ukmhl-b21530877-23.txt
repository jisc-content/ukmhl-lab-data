INTRODUCTION. 9 to some passages of Scripture, which, if they have any meaning, must be directions to man in the choice of his food. If, then, reason, humanity, and the law of God point the same way, we have three witnesses to the truth of the doctrine. The conflicting opi- nions of men, respecting what is best either for the promotion of health or happiness, cannot safely be relied upon; let Deity, then, decide the question ; and if ye will do His will, ye shall know by experi- ence whether the doctrine be of God.

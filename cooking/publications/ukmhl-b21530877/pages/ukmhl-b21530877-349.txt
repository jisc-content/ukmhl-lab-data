USEFUL FAMILY RECEIPTS. 335 1034. Baked Milk, for Consumptive Persons. Set half a pint of new milk in a moderate oven all night; it will turn thick and brown. It must be drank the first thing in a morning, and the same quantity prepared in the same way for evening. This simple remedy has been found highly beneficial, when regu- larly attended to for a length of time. 1035. Buttermilk Whey Is made by pouring boiling milk or water on some rather sour buttermilk, letting it stand to settle a few minutes, then straining it. 1036. Treacle Posset Put two table-spoonsful of treacle into a pint of milk when near boiling, stirring it briskly over the fire till it curdles; take it off the fire, and after standing a few minutes, strain it, and take it warm immediately on going to bed.

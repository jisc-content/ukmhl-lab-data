176 CREAMS, FLUMMERY, &C. 549. Rhubarb Cream. Peel and wash a quantity of rhubarb, put it into a pan with a little water, lemon-peel, a bit of cinnamon, and as much moist sugar as will sweeten it, set it on a moderate fire, and reduce it to a marmalade, pass it through a hair-sieve, and when cold, mix with it a pint of cream, or two eggs beaten up with a pint of new milk. 550. Italian Cream. Take two parts of cream and one of milk, about a quart in all, boil, and pour it on four ounces of fine sugar and the thin rind of a lemon; when well- flavoured, add the beaten yolks of eight eggs, and beat the whole very well; set it on the fire, stirring it till it begins to thicken; add three-quarters of an ounce of isinglass, (which has been dissolved in as little water as possible,) whisk it well, then strain through a lawn-sieve, and pour it into moulds. It would be well to try a little in a small cup. 551. Quince Cream. Take quinces when quite ripe, pare and cut them in quarters, scald them till they are soft, pulp them through a hair-sieve; mix an equal weight of quince and fine powdered sugar, and the whites of eggs beaten till as white as snow; it is then ready to serve. Apple cream may be made in the same way. 552. Raspberry Cream. Mash the fruit gently, and let it drain through a sieve, sprinkling a little sugar on the fruit, which will produce more juice, then put the juice to some cream and sweeten it, then a little milk may be added; but the cream must be put in first, or the milk will curdle. It may be made from jam or jelly

SYRUPS, &C. 305 liquor; close it well up, and let it remain undisturbed for three months, then, if quite clear, bottle it, and it will be ready for use. This syrup makes an ex- ceedingly pleasant liquor mixed with water. Strawberry and Currant Syrup may be made in a similar way, but to obtain the juice from the straw- berries, half a pint of water should be put to each quart of fruit in a jar, and the jar set in a pan of water on the fire till the strawberries are in that state that the juice can be pressed from them through a sieve, it may then be put with the currant juice and proceeded with as above. White Currants may be used if preferred. Gooseberry, Cherry, and Mulberry Syrup, with a mixture of raspberry or currant juice, according to the kind of fruit used, may be prepared after the same manner. 939. Raspberry Vinegar. Bruise eight pounds of raspberries, and pour on them three pints of good gooseberry or sugar vinegar; let them stand twenty-four hours, frequently stirring them with a wooden spoon ; put six pounds of loaf- ยง sugar, broken in large lumps, into an earthen vessel, and the fruit and vinegar into a jelly-bag ; let it drop upon the sugar till all the juice is drained out, press- ing it gently now and then; pour the liquor into a preserving-pan and let it boil a little over a moderate fire, and, when cold, bottle it. When wanted for use, put two large spoonsful in a tumbler of water, and if too sweet, add a few drops of vinegar. This is one of the most useful preparations that can be kept in a house, not only as affording a most pleasant and refreshing beverage, but being of sin- gular efficacy in complaints of the chest. A stone jar is the best to boil it in, set in a pan of water; or it may be boiled in a-block-tin pan. 2p3

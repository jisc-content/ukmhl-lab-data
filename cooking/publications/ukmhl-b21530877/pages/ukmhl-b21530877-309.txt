A wooden spoon with holes in should be used for taking pickles out of the jars; they should never be taken out with a fork or the fingers; and pieces of pickle, such as mangoes, cucumbers, &c., should never be returned into the jar to the stock, but be kept separate in a small jar of vinegar. When the pickles are used, boil up the liquor with a little salt and fresh spice; when cold, bottle and cork it for use, either for sauce, or to pickle nastur- tiums and gherkins, where a fine colour is no object. CHEESE, &c. 909. New-Milk Cheese. Put five quarts of strippings, or afterings, as it is sometimes called, that is, the last of the milk, into a pan with a large spoonful of rennet*; when it is become curd, cut it through with a saucer or skim- ming-dish, just to break it; let it stand two hours, then spread a thin cloth in a sieve, put the curd in it and let the whey drain from it; break the curd a little with your hand, and put it into a vat with a two- pound weight upon it; when it has stood twelve hours, bind a fillet round, and turn it every day till dry, from one board to another. It may either be used in that state, or ripened with dock-leaves, or nettles, under and over, between two plates. If the weather be tolerably warm, it will be ready in three weeks. * In Barbary, instead of rennet, especially in the summer- season, they turn the milk with the flowers of the great-headed thistle, or wild artichoke.

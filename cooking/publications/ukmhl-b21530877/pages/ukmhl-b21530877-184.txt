170 CHEESECAKES, CUSTARDS, &Ci cream, acid four yolks of eggs ; if milk, six; with sugar to the taste; pour them into cups and hake them lightly. 528. Baked Custard. Boil a pint of cream with a little cinnamon, when cold, add four eggs beaten and strained, a few bitter almonds beaten fine, nutmeg, and sugar; bake it in cups. 529. Biest Custard Set a pint of biest over the fire, with a little cinna- mon and three laurel-leaves, keep stirring it till it be scalding-hot, then take it off; have ready mixed a spoonful of flour, and the same of thick cream ; pour the hot biest upon it by degrees, mix it well together, and sweeten it to your taste. 530. Biest Custard. Set some new milk on the fire, with a stick of cinna- mon, and as much biest as will make it the consist- ence of almond custard, stirring it constantly; when it thickens take it off; add sugar and spice to the taste. 531. Boiled Custards. If the custards be made with cream, four yolks of eggs should be allowed to a pint; but where good cream cannot be had, they may be made with milk, allowing six yolks of eggs to a pint, and adding a tea-spoonful of Indian arrow-root, or fine rice flour. Sweeten with fine sugar, and add a few bitter almonds pounded fine, or boil a laurel-leaf in them, which will have the same effect; a little orange- flower or rose-water may be put in, according to the flavour preferred. Be very careful to stir them all the time they are on the fire, to prevent their curdling.

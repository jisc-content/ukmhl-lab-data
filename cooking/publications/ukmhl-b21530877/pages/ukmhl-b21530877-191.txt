CREAMS, FLUMMERY, &C. 177 when the fresh fruit cannot be obtained. If made with jam, put six ounces to a pint of cream, pulp it through a sieve, and add the juice of a lemon, whisk it in a shallow dish; lay the froth on a sieve, adding a little more lemon-juice; when no more froth will rise, put the cream in a dish or glasses, and heap on the froth. Strawberry cream may be made the same way. 553. Raspberry Cream. Rub the pulp from a quart of raspberries through a hair-sieve, mix it well with cream and line sugar to the taste; put it in a stone jug, and mill it with a chocolate-mill or small whisk, taking off the froth as it rises, and laying it on a hair-sieve, as much as will be wanted; put the remainder in a glass dish, and heap the froth upon it. A mixture of strawberry and red-currant cream, the fruit to be strained through a cloth-strainer, may be made the same way. 554. Velvet Cream. Take a large tea-spoonful of orange-flower water, the juice of a large lemon, nearly half an ounce of isinglass, and sugar to the taste; let it boil till the isinglass is dissolved, then strain it, and pour about a pint of cream to it, let it stand till cold, then pour it into moulds. 555. Apple Solid. Dissolve [two ounces of isinglass in half a pint of water, strain it, and put it to a pound and a half of the pulp of good tart baking apples, when pared and boiled, and the water well-drained from them; add the juice and grated rind of a lemon, and bruised loaf-sugar to the taste; boil all together till it will leave the sides of the pan, then put it into a mould. If right, it will cut like citron.

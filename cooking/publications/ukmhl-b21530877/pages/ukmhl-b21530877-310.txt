296 CHEESE, &C. 910. Cream Cheese. To four quarts of new milk put two of cream, mix them together when cold, add as much boiling water as will make it new-milk warm ; when sufficiently curdled lay a thin wet cloth in a vat, then put in the curd with a dish, lay a board on that will go within the vat, lay on it a ten-pound weight, and let it drain fourteen hours ; then take it out, and if too thick to dry soon, cut it in two with a string of packthread, and dry the parts separately. Do not put in any salt. 911. Cream Cheese. Boil two quarts of cream, put it to four quarts of new milk, the yolks of three eggs, three spoonsful of sugar, and as much rennet as will turn it; mix all together, and run it through a clean hair sieve; when turned to curd, take it into a cheese-vat that will hold it all at once, lay a sinker (a board that will fit within the vat) upon it, and a weight upon that; let it stand till the next day; changing the cloths several times, and drawing it tighter each time, till it will go into a smaller vat. Turn it into clean cloths every day till ready for eating. The cloths should be very thin at the first. 912. Another way. Take five quarts of new milk, put to it a quart of cream and a quart of water boiled separately, add two yolks of eggs well-beaten, and a table-spoonful of sugar, and as much rennet as will turn it, lay a thin cloth in a sieve and pour it in ; change the cloths four or five times, then lay the cheese in clean grass or ruhes under and over, changing it twice a day; put a clean hot flannel twice a day over the grass.

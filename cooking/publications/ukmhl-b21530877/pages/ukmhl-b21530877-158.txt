144 PUDDINGS, &C. in a saucepan with a little salt, covered close; when boiled tender, put it into a sieve to drain, then chop it and mix it with some grated bread, half a pint of cream, a little nutmeg, salt, and two ounces of melted butter, add four well-beaten eggs, set it on the fire till it thickens, then wet and flour a cloth, tie it up and boil it an hour. Serve with melted butter and sift fine sugar over it. 431. Another Spinach Pudding. A pint of grated bread, three ounces of butter cut in small pieces, half a pound of currants, sugar, nutmeg, and salt to the taste; mix all together with half a pint of spinach-juice, three spoonsful of cream and three eggs; boil it an hour and a half in a basin well buttered. 432. Spoonful Pudding. A spoonful of flour well beaten up with a spoonful of cream or milk, one egg, a little salt, and a little pow- dered ginger; boil it half an hour in a cup well buttered. 433. Suffolk Dumplings. Make a very light dough with yeast, as for bread, but with milk instead of water, add a little salt; let it rise an hour before the fire; have ready a pan of boiling water, make the dough into balls about as large as moderate-sized apples, put them in and boil them twenty minutes; if you doubt their being enough, stick a clean fork into one, and if it come out clear it is done. When you eat them, tear them apart on the top with two forks, for they become heavy with their own steam. Eat them immediately, with melted butter and sugar, or common pudding-sauce.

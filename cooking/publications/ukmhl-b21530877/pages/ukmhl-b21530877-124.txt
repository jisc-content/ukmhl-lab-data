PREPARATIONS OF CHEESE, &C. 110 304. Stewed Cheese. To a pint of water take four middling-sized onions, three ounces of butter, pepper, and salt; stew them till the onions are quite enough, then shred in a quarter of a pound of good old cheese, but not faded, keep stirring it about one minute after the cheese is put in ; have bread ready toasted on a dish and pour it over. 305. Cheese Fritters. Pound some good cheese with bread-crumbs, raw yolks of eggs and butter; make this mixture into small oval balls, dip them in stiff fritter batter, and fry them. SANDWICHES. 306. Cheese Sandwich. Take two-thirds of grated Cheshire cheese, and one of butter, a little cream, and a small proportion of made mustard; pound them in a mortar; cover small slices of bread with this, then lay a slice of bread over each, press them gently together, and cut them in small pieces. A little Cayenne pepper may be added. 307. Beet-root Sandwich. Take slices of fried beet-root, as prepared in No. 202, and lay it between bread and butter, with mustard. Vegetable Marrows, if gathered before the seed is formed, and half boiled, then sliced, seasoned, and fried in the same manner as beet-root, make very good sandwiches.

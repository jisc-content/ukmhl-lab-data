61 EGGS, &C. ters. Have ready a pint of good herb gravy, well seasoned and thickened over the fire, with two ounces of butter rolled in flour. When quite smooth and hot, pour it over the eggs, and serve them up. By using cream instead of gravy, putting an ounce more of butter and omitting the flour, this will make a fricassee. 117. Ragout of Eggs and Mushrooms. Take some large mushrooms, peel and scrape them clean, put them into a saucepan with a little salt, cover them, and let them boil a little, then put in a gill of milk, an ounce of butter rolled in flour, sea- soned with mace and nutmeg: boil it till it be of a good consistency. Have ready six hard-boiled eggs, take out the yolks whole. Put some toasted sippets in a dish, and the yolks upon them, then pour over them the whole of your ragout. 118. Eggs with Cheese. Put a quarter of a pound of grated Swiss cheese into a saucepan with a piece of butter half the size of an egg, some parsley and chives chopped, a little nut- meg and half a glass of sherbet. Set it over a gentle fire, moving it about till the cheese is melted. Then mix with it six eggs, and set it again over the fire till they are nicely done. Serve it up with small pieces of toasted bread round the dish. 119. Eggs fried in Paste. Boil six eggs three minutes, put them into cold water, then take the shells off (be careful not to break the whites) and wrap the eggs up in slips of puff paste ; brush them over with beaten eggs, and sprinkle a very few fine bread crumbs over them, have some clarified butter in a pan, when hot put in the eggs; fry them G

33 SOUPS, &c. of boiling water to the vegetables, and stew them two hours; dust a little flour into a tea-cupful of water, stir it into the soup, and boil it fifteen or twenty mi- nutes longer, then serve it up. Take a small piece of butter and set it over the fire in a clean iron pan ; put it to a few spoonsful of fine oatmeal; stir the whole about briskly with a broad wooden spoon till the butter is melted, and the meal be uniformly of a deep brown colour; great care being required, by stirring it continually, to prevent the meal being burned in the pan. A very small quantity of this roasted meal (perhaps half an ounce) would be sufficient to be put into a saucepan, with an onion sliced, and boiled with a pint and quarter of water, and forms a portion of soup, which, when sea- soned with salt, pepper, and vinegar, and eaten with bread cut small and mixed with it the moment it is served up, makes a palatable kind of food. This soup may be made in a short time, a few minutes being sufficient for boiling it. Put into a clean pan three quarts or more of water with raspings of bread to thicken it, about a small tea-cupful to a quart, two or three onions sliced, some whole pepper, and salt, cover it close and boil it an hour and a half; strain it through a sieve ; cut some celery, endive, lettuce, spinach, and with any other herbs you like; fry them in butter, and put a piece of butter with a little flour into a pan, set it on the fire, stirring it till of a fine brown, then put in the herbs and soup, boil it till the herbs are tender, and the soup of a proper thickness ; serve it up in a tureen, with fried bread cut in dice, 28.

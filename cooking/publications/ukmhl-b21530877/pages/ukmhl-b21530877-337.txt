Sago with Milk. Prepare a large spoonful of sago by washing it well, then soaking it in cold water an hour, pour off the water, and add a pint and a half of new milk, simmer till reduced to a pint; sugar or salt may be added.

Set a pint of milk on the fire, when near boiling, pour it upon a dessert-spoonful of arrow-root powder, previously mixed smooth with cold water, pour the milk gently upon it, stirring it constantly, return it into the pan, and stir it on the fire a minute or two.

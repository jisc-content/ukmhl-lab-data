Take an ounce of marshmallow-root, and two or three figs ; boil them in a quart of water till one-half be consumed ; then strain the liquor. By adding an ounce of honey, and half an ounce of water of ammo- nia, it will make an excellent diluting gargle. It is peculiarly beneficial in fevers, where the tongue and throat are rough and parched. It is also very supe- rior to common acid gargles, in quinseys and inflam- matory sore-throats. A decoction of figs in milk and water, adding a little sal-ammonia, is also a very effective gargle. A pint of boiling water, poured on a table-spoon- ful of the best green tea, kept covered close and used lukewarm, as a gargle, is highly useful in bilious fevers ; adding sugar and milk, if agreeable. A solution of two drachms of borax in seven ounces of rose-water is also used as a gargle in bilious fevers and thrush; for the latter, add one ounce of honey of roses. 1141. An excellent Fomentation. Take dried wormwood, southernwood, and chamo- mile, of each an ounce, bay-leaves dried half an ounce, boil them gently in six pints of water, and strain it off for use.

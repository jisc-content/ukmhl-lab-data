MODERN COOKERY, [chap. XVI. 3 56 then wipe, and pound them to the finest paste, moistening them occasionally with a few drops of cold water, to prevent their oiling; next, add to, and mix thoroughly with then), seven ounces of highly-refined, dried, and sifted sugar; put them into a small preserving-pan, or enamelled stewpan, and stir them over a clear and very gentle fire until they are so dry as not to adhere to the finger when touched; turn the paste im- mediately into an earthen pan or jar, and when cold it will he ready for use. Jordan almonds, 7 ozs.; bitter almonds, 1 oz.; cold water, 1 tablespoonful; sugar, 7 ozs. Obs.'â€”The pan in which the paste is dried, should by no means he placed upon the fire, but high above it on a bar or trevet: should it he allowed by accident to harden too much, it must he sprinkled plentifully with water, broken up quite small, and worked, as it warms, with a strong wooden spoon to a smooth paste again. We have found this method perfectly successful; but, if time will permit, it should be moistened seme hours before it is again set over the fire. TARTLETS OP ALMOND PASTE. Butter slightly the smallest-sized patty-pans, and line them with the almond-paste rolled as thin as possible; cut it with a sharp knife close to their edges, and hake or rather dry the tartlets slowly at the mouth of a very cool oven. If at all coloured, they should be only of the palest brown; but they will become perfectly crisp without losing their whiteness if left for some hours in a very gently-heated stove or oven. They should he taken from the pans when two thirds done, and laid, reversed, upon a sheet of paper placed on a dish or board, before they are put hack into the oven. At the instant of serving, fill them with bright-coloured w hipped cream, or with peach or apricot jam; if the preserve be used, layover it a small star or other ornament cut from the same paste, and drie with the tartlets. Sifted sugar, instead of flour, must dredged upon tlie board and roller in using almond paste. Leaves and flowers formed of it, and dried gradually until per- fectly crisp, will keep for a long time in a tin box or canister, and they form elegant decorations for pastry. When a fluted cutter the size of the pattypans is at hand, it will be an im- provement to cut out the paste with it, and then to press it lightly into them, as it is rather apt to break w hen pared off with a knife. To colour it, prepared cochineal, or spinach- gyeen, must he added to it in the mortar.

6 MODERN COOKERY. [[CHAP. I. BOUILLON. (The Common Soup of France ; cheap, and very wholesome.) This soup, or broth, as we should perhaps designate it in England, is made once or twice in the week, in every family of French Pot-au-Feu; or. Earthen rice, or semoulina. The ingre- Soup Pot. dients are, of course, often other- wise proportioned than as we have given them, and more or less meat is allowed, according to the taste or circumstances of the persons for whom the bouillon is prepared; hut the process of making it is always the same, and is thus described (rather learnedly) by one of the most skilful cooks in Europe: “ The stock-pot of the French artisan,” says Monsieur Careme, “ supplies his principal nourishment; and it is thus managed by his wife, who, without the slightest knowledge of chemistry, conducts the process in a truly scientific manner. She first lays the meat into her earthen stock-pot, and pours cold water to it in the proportion of about two quarts to three pounds of the beef;* she then places it by the side of the fire, where it slowly becomes hot; and as it does so, the heat enlarges the fibre of the meat, dissolves the gelatinous substances which it contains, allows the albumen (or the muscular part which produces the scum) to disengage itself, and rise to the surface* and the osmazome (which is the most savoury part of the meat) to be diffused through the broth. Thus, from the simple circumstance of boiling it in the gentlest manner, a relishing and nutritious soup will be obtained, and a dish of tender and palatable meat; but if the pot be placed and kept over a quick fire, the albumen will coagulate, harden the meat, prevent the water from penetrating it, and the osmazome from disengaging • ThU is a large proportion of meat for the family of a French artisan ; a pound to the quart would be nearer the reality; but it is not the refuse-meat which would be purchased by persons of the same rank in England for making broth. j.cajjc^uiLMxi.Ly jlu. xiauuc; turn uy the poorer classes as often as their means will enable them to substi- tute it for the vegetable or maigre soups, on which they are more commonly obliged to subsist.

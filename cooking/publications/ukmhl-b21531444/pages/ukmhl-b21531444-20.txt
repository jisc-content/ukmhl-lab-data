The book has received, since it was issued to the public, numberless flattering and kindly testimonies of approval, both through the medium of the press, and through various private channels; but none which have afforded the authoress more heart-felt pleasure—though all have given her much—than the cordial assurances of many young housekeepers that it has realized to them all that it professes, and proved a most valuable assistant in their households.

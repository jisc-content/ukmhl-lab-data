271 GAME. CHAP. XIII.J CHAPTER XIH GAME. TO CHOOSE GAME. Beck venison, which is in season only from June to Michaelmas, is considered finer than doe venison, which comes into the mar- ket in October, and remains in season through November and December: neither should be cooked at any other part of the year. The greater the depth of fat upon the haunch the better the quality of the meat will be, provided it be clear and white and the lean of a dark hue. If the cleft of the hoof, which is always left on the joint, be small and smooth, the animal is young; but it is old when the marks are the reverse of these. Although the haunch is the prime and favourite joint of venison, *he neck and shoulder are also excellent, stewed in various ways, * It must be observed that venison is not in perfection when young : like mutton, it requires to be of a certain age before it is brought to table. The word cleft applies also to the thickest part of the haunch, and it is the depth of the &t on this which decides the quality of the joint.

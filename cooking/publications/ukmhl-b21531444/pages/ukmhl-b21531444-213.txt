CHAP. V.] 141 8T0RE SAUCES. TO MAKE FLOUR OF RICE. Take any quantity of whole rice, wash it thoroughly, chang- ing the water several times; drain and press it in a cloth, then spread it on a dish, and dry it perfectly; beat it in a mortar to a smooth powder, and sift it through a fine sieve. When used to thicken soup or sauces, mix it with a small quantity of cold water or of broth, and pour it to them while they are boiling. This flour, when newly made, is of much purer flavour than any usually prepared for sale. POWDER OF SAVOURY HERBS. All herbs which are to be dried for storing should be gathered in fine weather; cleared from dirt and decayed leaves; and dried quickly, but without scorching, in a Dutch oven before the fir*L or in any other that is not too much heated. The leaves should then be stripped from the stalks, pounded, sifted, and closely corked in separate bottles; or several kinds may be mixed and pounded together for the convenience of seasoning in an instant gravies, soups, forcemeats, and made dishes : appropriate spices, celery-seed, and dried lemon-peel, all in fine powder, can be added to the herbs. THE DOCTORâ€™S ZEST. Pound to the finest powder separately, eight ounces of basket salt, a quarter-ounce of cayenne, a drachm of mace, and of nut- meg ; of cloves and pimento, a drachm and a half each; then add the other ingredients, one by one, to the salt, and pound them together until they are perfectly well blended. Put the zest into wide-mouthed phials, and cork them tightly. Half an ounce of mushroom-powder, and a drachm of dried lemon-peel, will greatly improve this mixture.

394 MANAGEMENT Of the kitchen garden. To imitate Chejhire Cheefe. THE milk being fet, and the curd being come, do not break it with a difh, as is cuftomary in making other cheefes, but draw it togetherwith your hands to one fide of the veffel, breaking it gently and regularly ; for if it be prefl'ed roughly, a great deal of the richnefs of the milk will go into the whey. Put the curd into the cheefe vat or mote as you gather it, and when it is full, fait it at different times, and prefs it and turn it often. The thicknefs of thefe cheefes mull be about feven or eight inches, and they will be fit to cut in about twelve months. You muff turn and fhift them frequently upon a fhelf, and rub them with a dry coarfe cloth. At the yearâ€™s end, you may bore a hole in the middle, and pour in a quarter of a pint of fack, then flop the hole clofe with fome of the fame cheefe, and fet it in a wine cel- lar for fix months to mellow ; at the expiration of which you will find the fack all loft, and the hole in a manner clofed up. If this cheefe be pro- perly managed, its flavour will be pleafant and grateful, and it will eat exceedingly fine and rich. C II A P. XXXIV. The Management of the Kitchen Garden.

THE MANAGEMENT OF POULTRY. 381 fhe may difclofe the chickens in the increafe of the next new moon; for a brood of this month is preferable to that of any other. Hens may, how- ever, fet from this time to Oflober, and have good chickens till then, but not afterwards. If you fet a hen upon the eggs of ducks, geefe, or turkies, you mull fet them nine days before you put her own eggs to her.

Round about the infide of the walls, upon the ground, fhould be made large pens, three feet high, for geefe, ducks, and large fowls, to fet in, and near the roof of the houfe fhould be long perches, reaching from one fide to the other.

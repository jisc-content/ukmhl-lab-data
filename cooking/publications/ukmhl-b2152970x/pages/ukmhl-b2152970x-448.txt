386 THE MANAGEMENT OF POULTRY. Turkies. THESE birds are of a very tender conftitu- tion, and, while young, mull be carefully watched and kept warm ; for the hens are fo negligent, that while they have one to follow them, they will never take any care of the reft. Turkies are great feeders on corn, and, if kept on it, will confume a prodi- gious quantity ; but, if left to their own liberty when grown up, they will get their own living, by feeding on herbs, feeds, and what they can pick up.

When you intend to fatten turkies, give them fodden barley or fodden oats for the firft fortnight, and for another fortnight cram them with the fol- lowing. Take a quantity of barley meal properly fifted, and mix it with new milk. Make it into a good ftiff' dough pafte; then make it into long crams or rolls, big in the middle, and fmall at both

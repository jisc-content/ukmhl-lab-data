H E dairy requires a great fhare of care and attention, of which cleanlinefs is not the lead. As its produ&ions are effentially neceffary in a family, the houfekeeper fliould entrud the care of it to one, who is well converfant in thofe matters; and that the houfekeeper may judge when things are done properly, we fhall proceed to defcribe the mod edential points. Next to obferving that every thing is perfectly clean and neat, the cows mud be milked at a regu- lar hour ; for the detention of the milk will not only contribute to fpoil the cows, but keep the animals in great pain. They fhould not be milked later than five in the evening, that they may have time to fill their bags by the next morning, and their udders fhould always be properly emptied every time they are milked. As foon as the milk is brought into the dairy, it fliould be well drained, and emptied into clean pans. White ware pans are the bed, as they are of a fuperior cleanlinefs, the brown fort being very porous, and fcarcely any fcalding will be dif- fident properly to cleanfe them.

328 DIRECTIONS FOR MARKETING. Pheafants. PHEASANTS, as well as woodcocks and partridges, are not expofed to fale in the markets, fo that all choice is out of the quedion ; but, as many of them are fometimes fent as prefents to dif- ferent families in London, it may not here be im- proper to inform the cook, by what means they may didinguifh the better from the worfe.

If the vent of the hen be open and green, fhe is dale, and when rubbed hard with the finger, the Ikin will peel. The vent will be foft, if fhe be with egg. Partridges. THE legs of partridges will be yellowifh, and the bill of a dark colour, if the birds are young. The vent will be firm, if they be frefh ; but it will look greenifh, and the fkin will peel when rubbed with the finger, if they be dale. The bill will be white, and the legs blue, if they are old.

They are bed about a fortnight or three weeks after their fird appear- ance, when they have reded after their long flight over the ocean. If they feel firm and thick, it is a proof they are fat and in good condition. The vent will alfo be thick and hard, and a vein of fat will run by the fide of the bread ; but a lean one will feel thin in the vent. If the bird be newly killed, its feet will be limber, and the head and throat clean; but, if it be dale, every thing will have a contrary appearance. To

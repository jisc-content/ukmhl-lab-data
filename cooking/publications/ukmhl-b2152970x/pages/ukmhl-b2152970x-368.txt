They are common in the weftern parts of Europe, and we have them in fome of our gardens; but Toulon is the principal place for them. Some are fent us from Lyons; but they are flatter, and not fo firm. Some come from Majorca; but they are fait and difagreeable. They gather the buds from the bloffoms before they open, then fpread them upon the floor of a room, where no fun en- ters, and there let them lie till they begin to wither. They then throw them into a tub of fharp vinegar, and, after three days, they add a quan- tity of bay fait. When this is diffolved, they are fit for packing for fale, and are fent to all parts of Europe. The fineft capers are thofe of a mode- rate fize, firm, and dole, and fuch as have the pickle highly flavoured. Thofe are of little value, which are foft, flabby, and half open.

THE MANAGEMENT OF POULTRY. 383 When they have gained ftrength, you may give them curds, cheefe parings, white bread, crufts foaked in milk, or the like foft meat that is {mail, and will be eafily digefted. They rnuft be kept in the houfe a fortnight, before they are fuffered to go abroad with the hen. Take care that their water is quite clean, for if it be dirty it will per- haps give them the pip. In order .to fatten your chickens, confine them in coops, and feed them with barley meal. Put a fmall quantity of brick-duft with their water, which will not only give them an appetite to their meat, but will facilitate their fattening. All fowls, and other birds, have two ftomachs : the one is their crop, which foftens their food, and the other their gizzard, which macerates it. In the laft are gene- rally found fmall ftones and fharp bits of fand, which help to do that office, and without them, or fomething of that kind, a fowl will be wanting of its appetite ; for the gizzard cannot macerate or grind the food faft enough to difeharge it from the crop without fuc.h affiftance, and therefore, in this cafe, the brick-duft thrown into the water is of great fervice. Sitting hens are fometimes troubled with lice and vermin, for the cure of which, waffi them with a decoflion of wild lupines. Fowls in gene- ral are fubjeft to a diforder.called the pip, which arifes from a white thin fcale growing on the tip of the tongue, and will prevent their feeding. This is eafily difeerned, and generally proceeds from drinking puddle water, or want of water, or eating filthy food. This, however, may be cured, by pulling off the fcale with your nail, and then rub- bing the tongue with fait. â€¢* Ducks.

372 directions for brewing malt liquors, a great deal will be thrown away ; whereas, on the contrary, good wholefome drink will be valued, and confequently taken care of. It is ad- vifeahle, therefore, where there is good cellaring, to brew a flock of fmall beer in March or October* or in both months, to be kept, ifpoffible, in hog- flieads. The beer brewed in March fhould not be tapped till October, nor that brewed in Oftober till the March following. Some people, who brew with high-dried barley malt, in order to fine their beer, put a bag, con- taining about three pints of wheat, into every hogfhead of liquor, which has had the defired ef- fe£l, and made the beer drink foft and mellow. Others have put about three pints of wheat malt into a hogfhead, which has produced the fame effe£l. Malt liquors may be fpoiled by bad cellaring, be fubjefl to ferment in the call':, and confequent- ly turn thick and four. When this happens, the befl way of bringing the liquor to itfelf is, to open the bung-hole of the calk for two or three days ; and, if that does not flop the fermentation, then put in about two or three pounds of oyflcr-fhells, wafhed, dried well in an oven, and then finely pounded. After you have put it in, flir it a little, and it will foon fettle the liquor, make it fine, and take off the fharp tafle. -When you find this effefted, draw it off into another veffel, and put a fmall bag of wheat, or wheat malt, into it, in proportion to the fize of the veffel. In fome country places remote from principal towns, it is a praftice-to dip whifks into yeafl, then beat it well, and hang up the whifks, with the yeafl in them, to dry; and if there be no brewing till near two months afterwards, the flirring and beating one of thefe whifks in new wort, will foon raife a working or fermentation. It is a rule.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 3 is an improper method, though praftifed by fome cooks, to fait the meat before it be put to the fire, for that draws out the gravy. Take care that the fpit be clean, for a fpit mark is very difagreeable. When your meat is done, flour and bafte it juft before you take it up, when it will have a nice froth, and make a better appearance. Boiling. MUCH care, nicety, and attention, are re- quired in boiling all forts of meat, but particularly veal; to boil which properly, you muft fill your pot with a proper quantity of foft water. Having dufted your veal with flour, put it in your pot over a ftrong fire. The cuftom of putting in milk to make it white is ufelefs, and had perhaps be better left out. Oatmeal has no better effeH than milk, and flour is certainly better than either, when dufted on the meat. Be fure to fkim it well, for every thing will throw up a fcum, and if that be fuffered to boil down, it will give a black caft to the meat. The meat muft have plenty of water, and boil very flowly, which will give a plump ap- pearance to the veal. To let any fort of meat boil fall is a great error, as it hardens the outfide, pre- vents the water from properly penetrating, and gives a difagreeable colour to the meat. It is a general rule in boiling meat, to allow a quarter of an hour to every pound; but a leg of veal of twelve pounds, will require three hours and a half boiling, for the flower it boils the better. All forts of frefh meat may be put in when the water boils, but fait meat when the water is warm ; though there are many experienced cooks who always put the meat in when the water is cold, as they fay it thereby gets warm to the heart before t e outfide gets hard. To boil a leg of lamb of tour pounds weight, you muft allow an hour and B 2 half.

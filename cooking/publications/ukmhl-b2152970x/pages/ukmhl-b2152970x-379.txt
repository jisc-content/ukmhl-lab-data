HAVING rubbed the flitches well with com- mon fait, let them lie fo that the brine may run from them. In about a week, rub off all the fait, and put them into a tub.

Having let them lie a week, often rubbing them, turn them, and let them lie three weeks or a month in all, rubbing them well. Then dry them, and hang them up for ufe. Another Method. HAVING taken off all the infide fat of a fide of pork, lay it in fuch a pofition that the blood may run away from it. Then rub it well with good fait on both fides, and let it lie in that ftate one day. Then take a pint of bay fait, and a quarter of a pound of faltpetre, and beat them fine. To thefe add two pounds of coarfe fugar, and a quarter of a peck of common fait. Obferve to wipe off all the old fait before you put it into the pickle, and never keep bacon or hams in a hot kitchen, or in a room where the fun comes, as it will make them rufty. Lay your pork in fomething that will hold the pickle, and rub it well with the above ingredients. Lay the fkinny fide down- wards, and bafte it every day with the pickle for a fortnight.

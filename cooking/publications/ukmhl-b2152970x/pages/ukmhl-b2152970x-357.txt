THOUGH it fhould feem by the name given to this vinegar, that it is made from white wine only, yet the following direftions for preparing it will fhew the contrary. When you brew in the month 'of March or April, take as much fweet wort of the firft running as will be necelfary to ferve you the whole year. Boil it without hops for half an hour, and then put it into a cooler. Put fome good yeaft upon it, and work it well. When it is done working, break the yeaft into it, and put it into acafk; but be careful to fill the cafk, and fet it in a place where the fun has full power on it. Put no bung in the bung-hole, but put a tile over it at night, and when it rains. Let it hand till it is quite four, which will be in the be- ginning of September. Then draw it off from the fettlings into another cafk, let it hand till it is fine, and then draw it off for ufe. If you have any white wine that is tart, put it into a cafk, and treat it in the fame manner; or you may do cyder the fame way. A cafk of ale turned four, makes ale vinegar in the fame manner; but none of thefe are fit for pickles to keep long, except the white wine vinegar firft mentioned. Elder Vinegar. PUT two gallons of white wine vinegar, and the like weight of the pips of elder flowers, into a ftone jar. Let them fteep, and ftir them every day for a fortnight. Then ftrain the vinegar from the flowers, prefs them clofe, and let it ftand to fettle. Pour it from the fettlings, and put a piece of filter- ing paper in a funnel, and filter it through. Then put it in pint bottles, cork it clofe, andkeepitforufe. U 4 Tarragon

The flop is compofed of a thin wall in the centre of the right and left Tides of the copper, which is to afcend half the height of it. On the top muft be left a cavity, from four to five inches, for a draught for that half part of the fire which is next the door of the copper ; and then the build- ing muft clofe all round to the finifhing at the top. By this method the heat will communicate from the outward part of the fire round the outward half of your copper, through the cavity, as will the farthefl part of the flue, which alfo contrafls a conjunction of the whole, and caufes the flame to glide gently and equally round the bottom of the copper. Very great are the advantages arifing from a copper being fet in this manner, and among thefe confiderations, the faving of fuel is not the leaft. It has a confiderable advantage over wheel- draughts ; for with them, if there be not particular attendance given to the hops, by ftirring them down, they are apt to flick to the fides, and fcorch, which will deprive the liquor of its fweet and pro- per flavour. By the method above advifed, the copper will laft many years longer than it will by the wheel-draught; for that draws with fo much violence, that fhould your liquor be beneath the communication of the fire, your copper will there- by be liable to injury ; whereas, by the other me- thod, you may boil half a copper full, without any bad confequences enfuing.

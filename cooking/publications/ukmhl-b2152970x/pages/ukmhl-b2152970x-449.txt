THE MANAGEMENT OF POULTRY. 387 both ends. Then wet them in lukewarm milk* give the turkey a full gorge three times a day, morning, noon, and night, and in a fortnight it will be fufficiently fattened. Pigeons. MAY or Auguft are the bell months to provide yourfelf with pigeons, as at thofe times they are young and in good condition. Tame pigeons ge- nerally produce but two young ones at a brood; but they make fome amends for the fmallnefs of the number by the frequency of their hatching : if they be well fed, and properly looked after, they will have young ones twelve or thirteen times in a year. Though they make a great deal of dirt, yet they are not fond of it, and mull therefore be keptclean. Their bell food is tares, or white peas, and they fhould have fome gravel fcattered about their houfe, and clean water fet in different places. They muft be carefully preferved from vermin, and their nefts from the ftarlings and other birds, as the latter will fuck their eggs, and the former entirely deftroy them. The common, or dove- cote pigeon, has the advantage of many other kinds, as they are very hardy, and will live in the fevereft weather. If the breed fhould be too fmall, it may be mended by putting in a few tame pigeons of the moll common kind, and the leafl confpicuous in their colours, that the reft may the better take to them from their being more like themfelves. Good management is required in proportioning the fexes among pigeons ; for there is nothing fo hurtful as having too many cocks, ef- pecially if you keep the larger or tame kind.

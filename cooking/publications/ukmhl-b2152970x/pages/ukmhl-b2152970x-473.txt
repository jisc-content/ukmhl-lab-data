MANAGEMENT OF THE FRUIT GARDEN. 411, preparing to force fruit trees on hot walls for early fruit. The proper ages for trees to be planted are when they are one, two, or three years old, and thefe maybe hadatpublic nurferies, as well as thofe more advanced and trained to a bearing (late for imme- diate bearers. Particular attention mult be paid to their being taken up with their full fpread of roots as entire as poffible. Prune broken parts and long llragglers, and any very irregular branch in the head. When you plant them, dig a wide aperture two or three feet over, and one deep, or more or lefs according to the fize of the roots. Fill the earth in regularly about them from three or four to five or fix inches over the uppermoft roots, and tread it evenly and geptly thereto, firlt round the outfide, then gradually towards the middle, and clofe round the Hem of the tree. You mull now prune peaches, ne6tarines, apri- cots, and other wall fruit. They bear moftly on the young wood produced the preceding year, and of which a general fupply of the moll regularly- placed mull now be every where retained at pro- per diltances, for fuccelfional bearers, or for new wood, occafionally for multiplying the branches. When pruned, nail them to the wall, four or five inches afunder. Prune vines, which bear only on the young wood, the lafl fummer fhoots being the proper bearers. Take out molt of the 1 all yearâ€™s bearers, and all the naked old wood. Shorten the re- ferred fhoots, the fmaller to three or four joints, and the flronger to five or fix. Nail the vines to the wall as foon as pruned, arranging the general branches and fhoots from eight to ten or twelve inches diltance. Prune your apples, pears, plums, and cherries, on walls and efpaliers, and alfo currants and goofeberries*

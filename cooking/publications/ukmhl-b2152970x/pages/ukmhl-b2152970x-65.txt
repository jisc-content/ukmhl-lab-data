5 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. Made Difhes. THOUGH it is not our intention to devote any particular chapter to the article of Made Difhes of butcherâ€™s meat, as we fhall infert them under the general heads of Beef, Mutton, &c. yet it may not be amifs to give fome general obfer- vations thereon, as we find them in Raffald, Glaffe, Mafon, Farley, and other modern books of cook- ery. As neither eggs nor cream will contribute much to thicken your white fauce, be careful, before you put your eggs or cream into it, to have all your ingredients well boiled, and the whole of a proper thicknefs. Do not ftir them with a fpoon, nor fet your pan on the fire, after you have put in your eggs and cream, for fear they fhould gather at the bottbm and be lumpy. To prevent this, hold your pan at a proper height from the fire, and keep fhaking it round one way, which will keep it from curdling ; but be fure that you do not fuffer it to boil. Remember to take out what you are drefiing with a fifh (lice, and ftrain your fauce upon it, which will prevent any fmall bits of meat mixing with your fauce, and you will thereby have it clear and fine. Be particularly cautious, in browning difhes, that no fat floats on the top of the gravy, which may be prevented by its being properly fkimmed. It fhould have no predominant tafte, which depends on your juftly proportioning the different ingredients, and fhould be of a fine brown. Nothing is more hurtful to the reputation of a made difh than the tafte of raw wine, or frefh anchovy; in order therefore to avoid this defeft, you muft deprive it of its rawnefs, by putting them in fome time before your difh is ready. Fried force-meat balls muft. be put in a fieve to drain, that the fat may run from them, and never let them boil in your fauce, as that will foften B 3 them.

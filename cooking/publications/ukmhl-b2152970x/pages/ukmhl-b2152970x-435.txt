' DIRECTIONS FOR BREWING MALT LIQUORS. 373 that all liquor (hould be well worked in the tun, before it is put into the veffel, otherwife it will not cafily grow fine. The propercjl Method to bottle Malt Liquors. THE firft attention to be paid is to your bot- tles, which muff be well cleaned and dried ; for wet bottles will fpoil your liquor by making it turn mouldy. Though the bottles may be clean and dry, yet, if the corks be not new and found, the liquor will be liable to be damaged; for, if the air can penetrate the bottles, the liquor will grow flat, and never rife. Many, who have flat- tered themfelves of a faving knowledge, by ufing old corks on this occafion, have fpoiled as much liquor as flood them in four or five pounds, in or- der to fave three or four fhillings. If bottles - be corked properly, it will be difficult to draw the cork without a fcrew ; and to fecure the drawing of the cork without breaking, the fcrew ought to go through the cork, and then the air mufl neccf- farily End a paffage where the fcrew haspaffied. If a cork has once been in a bottle, though it has not been drawn with a fcrew, yet that cork will turn mufly as foon as expofed to the air, and will communicate its ill flavour to the bottle into which it is next put, and thereby fpoil the liquor. In the choice of corks, take thofe that are foft and clean from fpecks. You may alfo obferve, in the bottling of liquor, that the top and middle of the hogffiead are the flrongeft, and will fooner rife in the bottles than the bottom. When you begin to bottle a veffel of any liquor, do not go about any thing elfe till the whole of that bufi- nefs is completed. As foon as a veffel of liquor begins to grow flat whilft it is on tap, bottle it, and into every bottle put a piece of loaf fugar about the fize of a wal- b 3 nut.

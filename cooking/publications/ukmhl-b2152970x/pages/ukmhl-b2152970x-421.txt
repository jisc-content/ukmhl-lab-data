DIRECTIONS FOR BREWING MALT LIQUORS. 359 for ufe. Brewing utenfils fhould never be con- verted to any other ufe, unlefs for wines; and even then, as foon as they are done with, they fhould be thoroughly cleanfed, and kept in a clean place. Calks mud be well cleaned with boiling water ; and, if the bung-hole be large enough, fcrub them well with a fmall birch broom or brufti. If you find them bad, and have a mufty fcent, take out the heads, and let them be fcrubbed clean with a hand-brufh, land, and fullers earth. When you have done this, put on the head again, and fcald it well; then throw in a piece of unflacked lime, and flop the bung clofe. When they have flood fome time, rince them well with cold water, and they will then be in a condition proper to be ufed. Your coolers alfo require equal attention, they being implements of much confequence in brewing; for, if they be not properly kept in order, your liquor will contract a difagreeable flavour, of which nothing can cure it. This often proceeds from wet having infufed itfelf into the wood, it being fometimes apt to lodge in the crevices of old coolers, and even infefl them to fuch a degree, that it cannot be removed even after feveral wafh- ings and fcaldings. One caufe incidental to this evil is, fuffering women to wafh in a brewhoufe, which ought never to be permitted, where any other convenience can be had ; for nothing can be more hurtful than the remains of dirty foap left in veffels intended for brewing only. Never let the water Hand too long in the cool- ers while you are preparing them, as the water will foak into them, and foon turn putrid, when the flench will enter the wood, and make them almoft incurable. To prevent thefe ill effe&s, as well as to anfwer good purpofes, it has been re- A a 4 commended.

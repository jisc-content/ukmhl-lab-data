MANAGEMENT OF THE FRUIT GARDEN. 421 December. THE bufinefs of this month in the fruit-gar- den is principally the fame as in the laft ; that is, if the weather be open, to prepare ground, where neceffary, to plant with any kind of fruit-trees that may be wanted, or intended for planting this, or the two following months when the weather admits; but for fear of a fevere froft, it is advifeable to finifh the principal planting early in the month, at leaft all that is intended before Chriftmas. As to pruning it may be continued, when conveni- ent, all this month. Standard-tree planting may be now forwarded in open weather. Plant orchard trees where in- tended, as apples, pears, plums, and cherries, in full ftandards, thirty, forty, or fifty feet fquare, to form ftraight ranges each way. Likewife occa- fionally plant half ftandards, grafted on dwarf flocks, in fmall orchards, at lefs diftances. Efpa- lier-tree planting may be performed in apples, or pears, fifteen or twenty feet diftance ; plums, cher- ries, quinces, or medlars, at fifteen feet diftance. Fruit put by for keeping, fuch as apples, pears, and quinces, 'mull be occafionally examined, in order to remove what are decayed or rotten, and keep the whole clofely covered with ftraw, at leaft a foot thick, in order to exclude the damps.

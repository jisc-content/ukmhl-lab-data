4 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. half. Mutton or beef, which you mull: always be careful to dredge well with flour before you put them into the pot, do not require fo much boiling as lamb, pork, and veal, which, if they are not well boiled, will be unwholefome ; but it is not fo much thought of, if mutton and beef be not quite fo well done. A leg of pork will take an hourâ€™s boil- ing more than a joint of veal of the fame fize; but never forget to fcum the pot, let the meat be what fort it may. Frying. T O fry fifh properly, they mull be firft dried in a cloth and then dredged with flour. The drip- ping or hogflard, of which you mull put plenty in your pan, muft always boil before your fifh be put in. Hogflard, for frying, is preferred to but- ter, as the latter frequently makes the fifh foft, and is apt to burn and blacken them. Your fifh, when fried, fhould be put to drain, either in a difh or hair fieve, that, when you fend them up to table, they may not appear or eat greafy. If you make ufe of parfley, pick it very clean, and wafh it well in cold water, before you throw it into the pan of boiling fat, where you muft not let it remain too long. It will then be of a fine green, and eat very crifp. Broiling. THE principal matter in broiling is to have a clear fire. Turn your meat often while it is broil- ing, which will prevent its burning or getting fmokey. You muft have a difh placed over fome hot coals, in order to keep it hot as fall as it be broiled; for no meat of any kind is good unlcfs it be carried hot to table; and for this purpofe, many cooks fend up only a fmall quantity at a time, and that as foon as it is broiled. q Made

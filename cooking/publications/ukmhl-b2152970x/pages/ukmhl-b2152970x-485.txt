See. about two hours. 1 he cod mud, theiefoie, be laid to deep in the evening; the whitings, &c. in the morning of the day they are to be dreffed. After the time of deeping, they are to be taken out, and hung up by the tails until they are dreff- ed. The reafon of hanging them up is this, that they foften equally as in the deeping, with- out extrafling too much of the relifh, which would make them infipid. When thus prepared, the fmall fifh, as whitings, tufk, and luch like, mud be floured and laid on the gridiron, and when a little hardened on the one fide, mud be turned, and baded with oil upon a feather ; and when baded on both Tides, and heated through, take them up, always obferving, that as fweet oil fupplies the fifh with a kind of artificial juices, fo the fire draws out thefe juices and hardens them. Be careful, therefore, not to let them broil too long; but no time can be preferibed, becaufe of the difference of fires, and various flzes of the fifh. A clear charcoal fire is much the bed, and the fifh kept a good didance to broil gradually. The bed way to know when the fifh arc enough is, that they will fwell a little in the bading, and you mud not let them fall again. To thofe who like fweet-oil, the bed fauce is oil, vinegar, and mudard, beat to a confidence, and ferved up in faucers. If your fifh be boiled, as thofe of a large fort ufually are, it fhould be in milk and water, but not properly to fay boiled, as it fhould only jud fimmer over an equal fire. In this wav, half an hour will do the larged fifh, and five minutes the fmalled. Some people broil both forts after fimmering, and fome pick them to pieces, and then tofs them up in a pap with Â£ e 4 fried

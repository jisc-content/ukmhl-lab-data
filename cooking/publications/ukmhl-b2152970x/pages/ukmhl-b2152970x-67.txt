GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 7 but a batter pudding muft be tied clofe, and no pudding muft be put into the pot till the water boils. Puddings may be boiled in a bafon ; in which cafe, butter the bafon, and let it have plenty of water, and turn it frequently. As foon as you think it is enough, take it out of the pot, and let it ft and a fhort time to cool. Then take off the ftring, wrap the cloth round the bafon, and laying the difh over it, turn the pudding into it, in doing which you muft take great care that you do not break the pudding, as every light pudding is very liable to that accident. In making a batter pud- ding, begin with mixing the flour well with a little milk, after which gradually put in the ingredients, and thus your pudding will be perfectly fmooth, and without lumps. In making all forts of pud- dings, ftrain the eggs when you beat them, fo that they may neither have treadles nor lumps in them. Bread and cuftard puddings that are to be baked require time, and a moderate oven to raife them. If they be put in too great a heat, they will burn, and in courfe be fpoiled ; but batter and rice pud- dings require a quick oven. Before you put in the pudding, remember to butter the difh or pan. i Pies. ' RAISED pies require a quick oven, and that they fhould be well clofed up, otherwife they will fall in the fides. Put no water into them till juft as you are going to put them into the oven; for, if the water be put in fooner, it will give the cruft a fodden appearance, and may perhaps occafion it to run. Great judgment is ncceffary in determin- ing what fhould be the heat of your oven ; for light pafte requires a moderate, but not too flow a heat, as the latter will occafion it to look heavy ; and too great a heat will catch and burn it, without giving it time to rife. Iced tarts fhould be baked B 4 iu

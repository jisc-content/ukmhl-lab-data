390 MANAGEMENT OF THE DAIRY. To make. Butter. i BUTTER cannot be wholefome unlefs it be very frefh, and free from rancidity, otherwife it will hurt digeftion, render it difficult and painful, and introduce much acrimony into the blood. As foon as you have churned your butter, open the churn, and with both hands gather it well toge- ther, take it out of the butter-milk, and lay it in a very clean bowl, or earthen pan. If the butter is defigned to be ufed frefli, fill the pan with clear water, and work the butter in it to and fro, till it is brought to a firm confidence of itfelf, without any moifture. When you have done this, fcotch and flice it over with the point of a knife, every way as thick as poffible, in order to draw out the fmalleft hair, bit of rag, drainer, or any thing that may have happened to fall into it. Then fpread it thin in a bowl, and work it well together with fuch a quantity of fait as you think fit, and then make it up in what form you like beft. If the milk of any cow fliould happen to be foul and corrupt, owing to the teats being injured by fome accident, it mud by no means be mixed with the fweet milk, but given to the pigs. In the hot fummer months, the cream fliould be flcimmed from the milk before the dairy gets warm.from the influence of the fun; nor fliould the milk at that feafoh ftand longer in the pans than twenty-four hours, nor be fkimmed in the evening till after fun- fet. In winter, milk may remain unfkimmed for thirty-fix or forty-eight hours. The cream fliould be depofited in a deep pan, which fliould be kept, during the fummer, in the cooled part of the dairy, or in a cool cellar, where a free air is admitted, which is much better. You mud not omit to churn at lead twice a week in the hot weather, and this bufinefs fliould be done very early

388 THE MANAGEMENT OF POULTRY. The heft and mod eafy method of making a dovecote, is to build the walls with clay mixed with ft raw. They may be made four feet or more in thickncfs, and while they are wet it is eafy to cut holes in them with a chiftel or other inftrument. But of whatever materials the cote is erefted, it fhould be frequently whitc-wafhcd on the outfide, which will make the building more confpicuous. As pigeons are very fond of fait, they ftiould have a large heap of clay laid near the dovecote, and let the brine done with in the family be fre- quently beaten among it. It is belt to make it thin, and keep it fo by often mixing brine with it. The ufe of fait is of much more advantage to pige- ons than merely the pleafing them, for nothing will recover them fo readily from ficknefs, a mixture of bay fait and cummin-feed beingwiththem an uni- verfal remedy for moft difeafes they are fubje&to. Pigeons are fometimes apt to be Tcabby on the backs and breafts, which will kill the young, and make the old ones fo faint, that they cannot take their flights. In order to remove this diforder, take a quartern of bay-falt, and as much common fait, a pound of fennel feed, a pound of dill-feed, as much cummin-feed, and an ounce or two of afla- faetida; mix all thefe together with a little wheat flour, and fome fine worked clay. When it is well beaten together, put it into two pots, and bake them in an oven. When they are cbld, lay them longways on the ftand or table in the dovehoufe, and the pigeons will foon be cured by pecking it. Rabbits. FEW animals are more fertile than tame rab- bits, bringing forth young every month. As foon as the doe has kindled, (he muft be put to the buck, otherwife flic will deftroy her young. The belt .food for them is the fweeteft hay, oats and bran, fowthiftle.

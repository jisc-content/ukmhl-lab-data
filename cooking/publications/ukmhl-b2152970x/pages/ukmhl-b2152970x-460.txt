Great care fhould be taken that the feeds are quite frefh, which is a matter of great importance, and for want of which many are difappointed in their principal crops, when too late to fow again. When you fow your different crops, let it be in dry weather, and while the ground is frefh dug, or levelled down, or when it will admit of rak- ing freely without clogging. Cauliflower plants, that have flood the winter in frames or borders, fhould now be planted out, if the weather be mild, in well-dunged ground, two feet and a half diftant, and draw earth to thofe remaining under the glaffes. Give air to thefe, and your melon and cucumber plants; but cover the glaffes every night with mats. Towards the end of this month, plant potatoes for a full crop, in lightifh good ground, fome of the early kind for a forward crop in fummer, and a large portion of the common forts for the general autumn and winter crops. Plant your main crop of flialot by off-fets, or the fmall or full roots, fet in beds fix inches apart. Sow a fuccef- fional and full crop of fpinach twice this month, of the round-leaved kind, in an open fituation; or it may be fown occafionally between two rows of beans, cabbages, cauliflowers, horferadifh, arti- chokes, &c. As this month the weeds will begin to fpring up apace, you muff be careful to deftroy them either by hand or hoe, or they will ruin all your crops. April.

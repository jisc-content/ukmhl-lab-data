Wet or dry fweetmeats fhould be kept in a dry cool place, as a hot place will deprive them of their virtue, and a damp place will turn them mouldy. Be fure to let the fyrup be above the fruit, and cut writing paper in the fhape of your pot or glafs, notch it all round the edges, dip it into brandy, lay it clofe on U 3 thq

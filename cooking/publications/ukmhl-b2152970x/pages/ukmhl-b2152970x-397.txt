DIRECTIONS FOR MARKETING. 335 To choofe Trout. THE beft fort of this beautiful and excellent frefh-water fifh are red and yellow. The females, which are moft in efteem, are diftinguifh by hav- ing a fmaller head, and deeper body, than the male. They are in high perfection the latter end of June, and their frefhnefs may be afeertained by the ge- neral rules we have given in the article of falmon. To choofe Cod. A COD fhould be very thick at the neek, and, if it be perfectly fine and frefh, the flefh will be white and firm, and of a bright clear colour, with red gills. When they are {tale they will appear flabby, and will not retain their proper flavour. From Chriftmas to Lady-day is their proper feafon. To choofe Tench. TENCH fhould be drefied alive, in order to be eaten in perfection; but, if they be dead, ex- amine the gills, which fliould be red, and hard to open. If frefh, the eyes will be bright, and the body firm and ftiff. They are generally covered with a kind of flimy matter, which, if clear and bright, is a proof of their being good. Rubbing them with a little fait will eafily remove this flimy matter. To choofe Soles. WI-IE N foies are good, they are thick and firm, and the belly of a fine cream colour,- but if they are flabby, or incline to a blueifh white, they are not good. Midfummer is the proper feafon for this fifh.

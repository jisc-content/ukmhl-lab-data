VALUABLE EECIPES. 167 the milk separates from the whey and begins to appear cooked, let it settle; in a minute or two most of the water and whcj can be poured off; if not sufficiently cooked, more hot water may be used ; set the pan on edge, and with your spoon or hand draw the curd to the upper side, pressing out as much water as possible; if desired, it can stand a few moments in cold water; when squeezed dry, work the curd fine, rolling it between the hands; add salt and cream to taste; in very warm weather when the milk has turned quickly, it is very palatable without the addi- tion of cream. WHITE CORN BEEAD. Mrs. E. S. Cheeseborough. One pint of meal thoroughly scalded with hard-boiling water. Butter the size of an egg and one well-beaten tgg; add milk to make it just thin enough to flow over the pan. Have the batter an inch thick, and then bake. YFSILAI^TI EGO EOLLS. Mrs. A. M. Gibbs.

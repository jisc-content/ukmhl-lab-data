VALUABLE KECIPES. 143 one pound alum, one pound black pepper, tied in a bag; dissolve the alum in a little hot water; put all into a jar or keg; wash the cucumbers with great care, and have none that are bruised ; throw them in and place a weight to keep them under. When wanted for pickling, soak a short time, changing the water as often as necessary. CONGEESS PICKLES. S. S. Pierce. Wash the cucumbers; take one pint of fine salt to one hundred medium sized cucumbers, and sprinkle it over them ; pour on boiling hot water enough to cover them; let them stand forty-eight hours ; take them out of the brine, wipe them, put them in jars, and pour over them scalding hot vinegar with any spices you like. If the vinegar becomes tasteless, put them into fresh vinegar before using them. Keep them covered tight. KECIPE FOR 600 PICKLES. Mrs. F. D. Gray.

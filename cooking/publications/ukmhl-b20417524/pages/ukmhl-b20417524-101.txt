VALUABLE KECIPES. 97 Do not draw or take off the heads of either. Garnish with fried or toasted bread, lemon, parsley and currant jelly. PEAIETE CHICKENS, PAETEIDGES AI^D QUAILS. Miss Sarah Page, Albany, N. Y. Clean nicely, using a little soda in the water in which they are washed; rinse them and dry, and then fill them with dressing, sewing them up nicely, and binding down the legs and wings with cords. Put them in a steamer over hot water, and let them cook until just done. Then place them in a pan with a little butter; set them in the oven and baste them frequently with melted butter until of a nice brown. They ought to brown nicely in about fifteen minutes. Serve them on a platter, with sprigs of parsley alternating with currant jelly. QUAIL ON TOAST. After the birds are nicely cleaned, cut them open down the back; salt and pepper them, and dredge with flour. Break down the breast and back-bones, so they will lie flat, and place them in a pan with a very little water and but- ter in a hot oven, covering them up tightly until nearly done. Then place them in a spider in hot butter, and fry a moment to a nice brown. Have ready slices of baker's bread toasted, and slightly buttered upon a platter. The toast should be broken down with a carving-knife, so that it will be tender. On this place the quails; make a sauce of the gravy in the pan, thicken lightly with browned flour, and pour over each quail and the toast. 7

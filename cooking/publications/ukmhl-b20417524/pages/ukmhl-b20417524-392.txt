THE HOME COOK BOOK. 388 No. 3. Linseed oil five ounces, turpentine two ounces, oil of vitriol one-half ounce. OLEAN^ING WHITE PAINT. Mrs. C. H. Wheeler. Spirits of ammonia, used in sufficient quantity to soften the water and ordinary hard soap, will make the paint look white and clean with half the effort of any other method I have ever tried. Care should be taken not to have too much ammonia, or the paint will be injured. HAED SOAP. Mrs. Mary A. Odell. Six pounds of clean grease, six pounds of sal soda, three pounds of stone lime; slake the lime and put it into four gallons of soft water; add the sal soda, and when dissolved let it settle. Pour off the water into an iron kettle, and add the grease melted, and boil. If the soap does not come after boiling a few minutes, add more soft water till it is of the consistency of honey. Wet a tub and pour the hot soap into it. When cold, cut it into pieces and lay it away to dry. Always make soap in iron kettle.

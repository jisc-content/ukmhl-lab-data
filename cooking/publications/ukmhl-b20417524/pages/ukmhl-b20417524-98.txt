THE HOME COOK BOOK. 94 wet to mould readily; make with floured hands into rolls or ovate balls, roll in flour until well coated, and fry a few at a time, lest crowding should injure the shape, in nice dripping, or a mixture half lard and half butter. As you take them out lay in a hot colander, that every drop of fat may be drained off. Serve in a heated dish with cresses or parsley. CHICKEN CROQUETTES. Mrs. J. A. Ellis. Four and one-half pounds chicken boiled and chopped very fine; moisten to a thick pulp with the liquor in which it has been boiled. Mix with this a pint and a half of mashed potatoes, beaten to a cream; three eggs, one teaspoon of mustard, sweet majoram, salt and pepper to taste; a little celery chopped very fine ; soften with milk till very soft, and add a quarter of a pound of butter. Mould into forms, dip in egg and cracker dust, and fry in boiling lard. CROQUETTES. Mrs. I. N. Isham. Take cold fowl or fresh meat of any kind, with slices of ham, fat and lean; chop all together very fine ; add half as much grated bread, and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg; one tablespoon of catsup, one teaspoon of made mustard and one lump of butter; mix well together, make up in little rolls or balls, dip in beaten yolks of eggs, cover with grated bread crumbs, and fry brown in lard.

THE HOME COOK BOOK. 230 pie from the oven. If you use dessicated cocoanut, soak it in the milk over night. COCOANUT PIE. Mrs. Taylor, Ft. Wayne. One and one-half pints of milk, six eggs, one cocoa- nut, three cups sugar, one-half cup butter; mix sugar and butter, then the eggs, then the cocoanut, and lastly the milk. POLISH TARTLETS. Roll some good puff paste out thin, cut it into two and a half inch squares ; brush each square over with the white of an egg, then fold down the corners so that they all meet in the middle of each piece of paste; slightly press the two pieces together, brush them over with the egg; sift over sugar; bake in a quick oven for a quarter of an hour; when they are done make a little hole in the middle and fill with jam or jelly. LEMON TAPiTS. Mix well together the juice and grated rind of two lemons, two cups of sugar, two eggs, and the crumbs of sponge cake; beat it all together until smooth ; put into twelve patty pans lined with puff paste, and bake until the crust is done.

9,8 THE HOME COOK BOOK, A SUGGESTION. M. A. T. Singe all poultry with alcohol, and dip quails into clari= fied butter for broiling. PRESSED CHICKEN. Mrs. C. H. Wheeler. Cut up the fowls and place in a kettle with a tight cover, so as to retain the steam; put about two teacups of water and plenty of salt and pepper over the chicken, then let it cook until the meat cleaves easily from the bones, cut or chop all the meat (freed from skin, bones and gristle) about as for chicken salad ; season well, put into a dish and pour the remnant of the juice in which it was cooked over it. This will jelly when cold, and can then be sliced or set on the table in shape. Nice for tea or lunch. The knack of making this simple dish is not having too much water; it will not jelly if too weak, or if the water is allowed to boil away entirely while cooking. PIGEON PIE. Mrs. L. Make a fine puff paste; lay a border of it around a large dish, and cover the bottom with a veal cutlet, or a very tender steak free from fat and bone; season with salt, cayenne pepper and mace. Prepare as many pigeons as can be put in one layer in the dish; put in each pigeon a small lump of butter, and season with pepper and salt ; lay them in the dish breast downwards, and cut in slices a half dozen of hard-boiled eggs, and lay in with the birds; put in more butter, some veal broth, and cover the whole with crust Bake slowly for an hour and a half.

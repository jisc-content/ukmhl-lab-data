The inventors of stoves are likely to understand the principles governing their invention, and unless you know^ from practical experience, that the directions are incorrect, it is safe to be guided by them in every particular. Objections are made by a good many people ^o vapor or gasoline stoves on account of danger from their use ; but the character of gasoline is so well known to almost every one, and such care is exercised in handling it, that as few accidents occur from its use as from that of any other heating or lighting material.

A stove of any kind, to do satisfactory work, must be kept clean and in order. But this is more especially true in the case of an oil stove than that of any other kind.

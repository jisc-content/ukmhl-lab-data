HOME MAKING AND HOUSE FURNISHING. 15 generally preferred, and either a side-table with drawers for linen and silver, or a sideboard. If tliere is a sunny window a box of plants is a lovely addition to the out- look. If only one open fire can be enjoyed it should be in this room, for a cheerful dining-room naturally be- comes the family room, unless there is a special living- room or sitting-room. In this case the necessary arti- cles of furniture gradually accumulate there. Mother's work-table and machine, and father's easy-chair or lounge readily find a place near the open fire in winter, and by the window in summer; the family will rally about these two centres of attraction as naturally as bees about honey-bearing flowers. The windows should freely admit both light and air, being screened only so far as privacy from outside observation requires. The kitchen should have hard or polished walls that can- not attract any deleterious absorptions, a polished or oil- clothed floor which can easily be cleaned, windows that afibrd plenty of light and air; the furniture should be only that which is absolutely necessar}^, a stove, two tables, a few wooden chairs, a dresser, and the neces- sary utensils and dishes. When there is laundry-work to be done in the kitchen the proper appliances should be provided. As kitchen-wares become yearly cheaper and more varied it is best to buy only those which are necessary for daily use. A refrigerator should be placed somewhere near the kitchen, in a cool position, but not in the cellar, for there its own dampness would soon injure it.

SERVANTS. 65 nently at the left hand corner of the sink, with a very- fine drainer at the bottom, connected with the waste pipe beneath the sink, is a greater convenience than any can realize until they have tried it; also, a marble or soapstone drainer, with grooves, for rinsing and draining dishes. It should be fixed to the table connected with the sink, and set a little inclined, so that the water shall drain into the sink. A moulding about an inch high will be needed around the edges of the drainer, to prevent the rinsing water from flowing over on the floor, and also to keep the dishes from sliding off. With a sink thus furnished, no dish pans are needed, except to wash pots and kettles. It is a simple thing, but very useful, because it compels the one washing to put her dishes into this drainer one by one, as she washes them. There are many more items connected with the kitchen which we would like to notice, did space permit, as the table adjoining the sink for washing game and vegetables, the small drawers underneath, for scouring and polishing material, and various little conveniences.

142 THE H0K3 COOK BOOK. PICKLED MELONS. Mrs. Wicker. Take ripe melons, wash, pare and take out the seeds, cut them in slices; put them in a stone jar, cover with vinegar, and let them stand twenty-four hours. Take out, and to each quart of fresh vinegar add three pounds brown sugar; for twelve melons take three ounces cinna- mon, two of cloves, two of allspice; boil the sugar and spices in the vinegar; skim it well, then put in the melons and boil for twenty minutes; let the syrup boil a few minutes after taking them out, then pour it over them. PICKLED OAULIFLOWEE. After cutting off all the green leaves, put the cauliflower into boiling water, with a good supply of salt, and boil from three to five minutes; take them out of the salt and water, dip them in clear cold water one minute, to send the heat to the heart of the cauliflower, cut them in pieces convenient to put in jars, then make a mixture of one tablespoon of mace, one of cloves, one of allspice, one of gin- ger, two of white mustard seed, and a red pepper pod, with each a gallon of vinegar. Let the mixture boil and pour it upon the cauliflower, cover them closely and let them stand one week, then pour off the vinegar, scald it, and return it hot again to the cauliflower; then put them in jars ready for use. The best cider vinegar should be used, and if it is not perfectly clear it will dissolve the cauliflower, BEINE FOR CUCUMBERS. Mrs. J. B, Adams.

24 THE HOME COOK BOOK. personal inspection, that many of these stoves are han- dled in such a slovenly, shiftless manner that they often act queerly," and seldom do satisfactory work. The most important detail in the successful operation of an oil stove is absolute cleanliness. The air box should be kept perfectly clean by occasional boiling in soap suds and sal-soda, and both the interior and exterior of the stove should be subjected to a cleaning at regular intervals, as is the case with an ordinary kerosene lamp. Unless this is done, and the wicks are properly trimmed, the stove will be apt to prove a disappointment. Some people insist that the wicks should be rubbed off every other day, and that they should never be trimmed. My experience, however, satisfies me that it is better to trim the wicks with shears occasionally, rather than to fre- quently rub them off, as by trimming a new, clean wick surface is presented and better combustion is obtained. Many of the ovens of gasoline and oil stoves being of tin or other light metal, are considerably, affected by the temperature and by atmospheric changes. When it is desired to heat the oven of a gasoline or coal oil stove in windy or very cold weather, it is advisable to cover it with a blanket or some light woolen material that will protect the outside of the oven and keep the heat from escaping, (a tea-box with two sides knocked out will answer). The hot air coming in contact with the blanket, through the ventilating holes, may possibly injure the material, but no danger need be feared from thus cover- ing the oven, and, when these conditions are complied with, an oil stove will be found admirably adapted to baking bread or cake, and roasting meats of all kinds. Either of these processes can be performed as perfectly

THE HOME COOK BOOK. 6 life. There is so little practical application of science in the kitchen that many girls never see any connection be- tween physics and chemistry and the drafts and dampers in a stove or the behavior of yeast or baking powder. This is the office of the schools of cookery and house- hold science â€” to teach the reason for common pro- cesses and to reduce housekeeping to a systematic busi- ness. Any young woman receiving training in such a school, supplemented by home practice, will retain the best features of the housekeeping of the past and be ready for the new methods of the future. The rapid advances in the study of bacteriology are imposing new burdens upon the housekeeper, which she will cheerfully accept when she realizes that the health of her family is dependent upon such details. We are learning that surface or apparent cleanliness is not suffi- cient; everything must be chemically clean, free from any foreign substance. To this end the coming house- keeper will select utensils of the best material and the simplest pattern, with no grooves and crevices where dangerous micro-organisms can lurk. Every article of furniture and every decoration will be chosen with re- gard to the possibility of keeping it cleanly with little v^aste of labor. Future generations may be expected to learn, what the housekeepers of to-day have not discovered, that time has a definite value and must be counted in the cost of any process or article of food. It is often wiser to pay a few cents more for a reliable article, than to run the risk of obtaining either an unhealthful food or some- thing that will require time and strength in its prepara- tion.

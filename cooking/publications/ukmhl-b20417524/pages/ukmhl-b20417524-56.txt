52 THE HOME COOK EOOK. habits, which those who must labor for their living can ill afford; while to give them less time would be unjust. When two, three, or more girls are needed in one house, the question of how much company they can be allowed at the house is important. If one girl has the privilege of allowing her friends to call when they choose, the others will expect the same privilege, and justly. This will cause confusion and disorder in their regular duties.

We have been through a long experience of this kind of open hospitality, and confess

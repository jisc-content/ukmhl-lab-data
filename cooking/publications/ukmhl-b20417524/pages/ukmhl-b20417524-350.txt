THE HOME COOK BOOK. 346 TIPSY CAKE. Mrs. Gen. N. J T. Dana. Take sponge cake and stick it full of almonds which have been blanched ; turn over it as much white wine as it will absorb; put it in a deep dish or glass bowl, and let it stand one hour, then pour over it as much soft custard as the dish will hold. Let it stand two or three hours. Very simple and very nice. RUNAWAY CAKE. Mattie Winslow, Aurora, 111. One egg, one teaspoon sugar, two tablespoons butter, one cup milk, two teaspoons cream tartar, one teaspoon soda, flour to make a little thicker than griddle cakes. This is very nice eaten hot with butter for breakfast and tea. TUMBLER CAKE. Mrs. Lamkin. I'^our eggs, one tumbler sugar, one tumbler butter, one- half tumbler molasses, one-third tumbler milk, one tea- spoon saleratus; spices to taste; one-half pound raisins, one-fourth pound currants, flour to make it the usual con- sistency.

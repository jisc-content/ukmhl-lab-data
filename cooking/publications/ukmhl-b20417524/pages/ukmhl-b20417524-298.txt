294 THE HOME .COOK BOOK. TEEMOKT BISCUIT. Brought from Boston, by Mrs. O. B. Wilson. One and a half pints of warm milk, one tablespoon lard, two tablespoons white sugar, a little salt, one yeast cake (Twin Bro.'s), or a cup of home made yeast or half a cake of compressed yeast as is most convenient; two quarts of sifted flour. To mix â€” make a hole in the flour and mix in all the ingredients to make a sponge; set in a warm place to rise; when quite light, work in all the flour and set the dough once more to rise ; when well risen, work a little more, and .roll out about one-third of an inch thick, and cut with a biscuit cutter. Moisten one edge with melted butter, then fold together in the middle like rolls. Place them in a bread-pan about one inch apart; set to rise for about half an hour in a warm place, and when light, bake in a quick oven, allowing from ten to fifteen minutes if the oven is just right. Make up about ten o'clock in the morning if wanted for tea; if wanted for breakfast, make up about nine o'clock in the evenings and work in all the flour at the first fixing, then add as soon as you are up in the morning, one-half teaspoon of soda; mould your biscuit and they will be ready for bak- ing when the oven is hot. With compressed yeast, about six hours all together is required. These are very delicate and delicious when properly made. yiEGINIA BISCUITS. Mrs. J. G. Hamilton.

224 THE HOME COOK BOOK. MINCE PIE. Mrs. James Morgan. Boil beef until tender (three pounds after it is boiled); when cold, chop fine; add three pounds of fine chopped suet, and mix with the beef; add a tablespoon of salt, six pounds of apples, four pounds of currants, six pounds of raisins, two pounds of citron; season to taste with pow- dered cinnamon, mace, cloves and nutmeg; add boiled cider, brandy and wine until quite soft; mix well and pack in stone jars, pour brandy over the top and cover tightly. This will make about five gallons; add two pounds sugar. MINCE PIE. C. Kennicott.

THE HOME COOK BOOK. 38i hard. The proprietor of one of the oldest silver estab- lishments in the city of Philadelphia says that house- keepers ruin their silver in soap suds, as it makes it look like pewter. POLISH FOE ZINC OE TIN. Mrs. Thos. A. Hill. To three pints of water add one ounce of nitric acid, two ounces of emery, and eight ounces of pumice stone; shake well together. Any druggist will fill it for fifteen cents. STOYE POLISH. Mrs. O. L. Parker. Stove lustre, when mixed with turpentine and applied in the usual manner, is blacker, more glossy, and more durable than when mixed with any other liquid. The turpentine prevents rust, and when put on an old rusty stove will make it look as well as new. TO EXTEAOT INK. To extract ink from cotton, silk and woolen goods, saturate the spot with spirits of turpentine and let it remain several hours ; then rub it between the hands. It will crumble away without injuring either the color or texture of the article. TO TAKE INK OUT OF LINEN. Dip the spotted part in pure tallow, melted; then wash out the tallow and the ink will disappear.

336 THE HOME COOK BOOK. DELICATE CAKE. Mrs. J. A. Ellis. One and a half cups powdered sugar, one-half of butter, one and a half of flour, one-half of corn starch, sifted with the flour, one-half of milk, the whites of six eggs beaten to a froth, one small teaspoon cream-tartar, one-half tea- spoon soda; flavor with almond or vanilla. Bake in a moderate oven. DELICATE CAKE. Mrs. A. T. Hall. One cup butter, two of sugar, one of sweet milk, whites of eight eggs, three cups flour one teaspoon of cream tar- tar, one-half teaspoon soda. DELICATE CAKE. Mrs. C. E. Browne, Evanston. Two eggs, a trifle over half a cup of butter, one cup sweet milk, one and a half of sugar, and three teaspoons baking powder. Put together in the usual manner, and flavor with extract of almonds or lemon. Made with the whites of four eggs, it is admirable for cocoanut cake; or with yolks for chocolate. Use your judgment in adding flour. This recipe I have had in use for fifteen years, and while inexpensive, it is nice enough for most any occasion. WHITE POUND CAKE. Mrs. M. J. Woodworth. One pound of flour, one pound sugar, three-fourths pound butter, the whites of sixteen eggs beaten to a stiff froth ; flavor with bitter almond. Elegant.

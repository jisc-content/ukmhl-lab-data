THE HOME COOK BOOK. 262 PEACH BUTTER. Mrs. M. L. Take pound for pound of peaches and sugar; cook peaches alone until they become soft, then put in one- half the sugar, and stir for one-half an hour; then the remainder of sugar, and stir an hour and a half. Season with cloves and cinnamon. TOMATO BUTTER. Mrs. Johnson. Nine pounds peeled tomatoes, three pounds sugar, one pint vinegar, three tablespoons cinnamon, one tablespoon cloves, one and one-half tablespoons allspice; boil three or four hours until quite thick, and stir often, that it may not burn. APPLE JELLY. Mrs. J. H. Brown. Take nice green apples that will cook nicely; quarter the apples without paring, put them in a pan or kettle and cover over with water, and keep them covered; let them boil slowly until entirely done; then put in a bag and drain (not squeeze) them. Put a pound of white sugar to a pint of juice. This is very easily made in the winter; is best made day before using. APPLE JELLY EOR CAKE. Mrs. P. B. Ayer. Grate one large or two small apples, the rind and juice of one lemon, one cup sugar ; boil three minutes.

(181) PUDDINGS. "And solid pudding against empty praise,'* EVE'S PUDDING. If you want a good pudding, mind what you are taught; Take eggs, six in number, when bought for a groat; The fruit with which Eve her husband did cozen, Well pared, and well chopped, at least half a dozen ; Six ounces of bread, let Moll eat the crust, And crumble the rest as fine as the dust; Six ounces of currants, from the stem you must sort, Lest you break out your teeth, and spoil all the sport; Six ounces of sugar won't make it too sweet, Some salt and some nutmeg will make it complete ; Three hours let it boil without any flutter, But Adam won't like it without wine and butter. SUET PUDDING. Mrs. E. R. Harmon. One cup of suet chopped fine, one cup chopped raisins, one cup of molasses, one cup of sweet milk, three tea- spoons baking powder; spice to your taste; four cups of flour; mix and steam three hours.

Three teacups of light dough from hop yeast, three tea- spoons melted butter, one cup of sugar, three well beaten eggs, one-half teaspoon of soda dissolved and strained, a pinch of salt, and flour to make the dough stiff enough to knead well; set away to rise, and when light make out by rolling in cakes to fit your pans, one-half inch thick; place one in the pan, cover well with soft butter and lay another on top; when light bake and serve at once.

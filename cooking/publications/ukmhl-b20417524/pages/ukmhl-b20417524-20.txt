16 THE HOME COOK BOOK. BEDROOMS AND NURSERY. The upper portion of the house remains to be consid- ered. The remarks concerning one sleeping-room will apply to all unless there are many and the desire is to furnish them differently: taste will then decide the variations. First, in regard to air and light, without which in abundance we cannot live; healthful, normal sleep de- mands that sleeping-rooms should be freely exposed to light — sunlight, if possible, during the day — and should be well aired. For night ventilation where freely opened windows are not considered advisable, the window-board described below will meet all the requirements of health. In ordinary sleeping-rooms, opening to the external air, perfect ventilation without draught can be secured by the following device: raise the lower sash three or four inches, and fit under it a thin board which entirely fills the opening between the sash and the window-seat; the air will enter through the aperture w^here the two sashes overlap in the mid- dle of the window, without creating any perceptible draught. The fittings of all sleeping-rooms should ensure com- fort, order, convenience, and cleanliness ; employ only enough furniture to secure these; all other things are superfluities. Avoid heavy or excessive draperies ; their effect is tempting, but remember that all except the lightest fabrics make a sleeping-room seem stuffy. Above all never exclude light and air. If the toilet- table and bed are draped to match the windows use only the lightest fabrics of linen, cotton, or silken texture, sheer, and delicate of hue.

261 VALUABLE RECIPES. TO CAN TOMATOES. Mrs. Edward Ely. Wash your tomatoes and cat out any places that are green or imperfect; then cut them up and put over to cook with a little salt; boil them till perfectly soft; then strain them through a colander; turn them back to cook, and when they have come to boiling heat, pour them into stone jugs (one or two gallon jugs as you prefer). They will keep a day or two in winter if all are not used at a time; put the cork in, and have some canning cement hot and pour over the cork. The jug must, of course, be hot when the tomatoes are poured in. CEANBEERY SAUCE. Mrs. Bartlett. One quart cranberries, one quart water, one quart sugar, stew slowly. PIC mC LEMON BUTTEE. Etta C.

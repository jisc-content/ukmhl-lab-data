VALUABLE EECIPES. 327 DKESSING FOR SALAD. Mrs. Hoge. Two raw eggs, one tablespoon of butter, eight table- spoons of vinegar; one-half teaspoon of mustard; put in a bowl over boiling water and stir until it becomes like cream; pepper and salt to your taste. SALAD DRESSING. Mrs. A. A. Carpenter. The yolks of four eggs, two-thirds of a cup of oil, red pepper, salt and mustard to taste ; the juice of two lemons, and last of all, one cup of thick cream. If the dressing is for chicken salad, use the oil or fat from the chicken instead of sweet oil. Be sure and put the cream in last, just before sending to table. SALAD DRESSING. M. A. T. Take the yolks of two raw eggs, beat with them one teaspoon of made mustard ; this mustard should be mixed with water, not vinegar; then add to this, drop by drop, olive oil, stirring constantly until the mixture becomes very thick; then add two teaspoons of powdered sugar and a scant one of salt; mix thoroughly; squeeze in the juice of one lemon; beat well, and if too thick, thin with a little sweet cream. If preferred, omit the lemon and cream, and use vinegar. This dressing with lettuce, cel- ery or potato, makes a delicious salad. If needed for chicken salad, the yolks of hard boiled eggs added make it richer. Garnish lettuce with na^sturtium blossoms and

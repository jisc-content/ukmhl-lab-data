THE HOME COOK BOOK. 382 TO WASH WOOLEN. E. A. Forsyth. To every pail of water, add one tablespoon of ammo- nia, and the same of beef gall; wash out quickly, and rinse in warm water, adding a very little beef gall to the water. This will remove spots from carpets, making them look fresh. TO WASH CAEPETS. E. A. Forsyth. Spread the carpet where you can use a brush; take Irish potatoes and scrape them into a pail or tub of water and let them stand over night, using one peck to clean a large carpet; two pails of water is sufficient to let them stand in, and you can add more when ready to use; add two ounces of beef gall and use with a brush, as to scrub a floor; the particles of potato will help cleanse; when dry, brush with a broom or stiff brush. WASHING FLUID. Mrs. A. P. Iglehart. Nine tablespoons unslacked lime, two pounds of sal soda, four quarts water; let this simmer half an hour, then bottle up. Take a small teacup to a boiler of water. WASHING FLUID. Mrs. A. W. D. One pound sal soda, one pound potash, each dissolved in one gallon of water (separately); then mix together and bottled.

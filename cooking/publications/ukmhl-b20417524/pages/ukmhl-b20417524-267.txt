VALUABLE EECIPES. 263 APPLE JELLY. Mrs. N. P. Iglehart. Take juicy apples (Ramboes, if possible); take the stem and top off, and wash them nicely, then cut up in quarters and put cold water on them, just enough to cover them : boil them soft, afterward strain them through a jelly bag; then take two pints at a time with two pounds of crushed sugar; boil twenty minutes, then do the same with the other juice; to be economical, pare and core the apples; don't strain so close, but that you can, by adding a little more water, use the apples for sauce or pies. CEAB APPLE JELLY AND JAM. Mrs. Ludlam, Evanston. Remove stems and blossoms from the apples; let them scald and pour off the first water; next put them in plenty of water and let them cook slowly ; as they begin to soften dip off the juice for jelly, straining it through flannel. One pound of juice to a pound of sugar for jellyv Next add more water; let apples stew very soft; strain through a sieve, which takes out cores and seeds ; to this pulp add brown sugar, pound for pound ; it needs careful cooking and stirring. â€¢ GKAPE JELLY. Anonymous. Allow fourteen ounces of sugar to a pint of juice; boil fifteen minutes alone; add sugar and boil five minutes.

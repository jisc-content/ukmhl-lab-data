VALUABLE KECIPES. 153 CODFISH HASH. Mrs. N. P. Wilder. One pint boiled picked codfish well freshened, one quart cold boiled chopped potatoes mixed well together, three slices salt pork freshened, cut in very small pieces and fried brown; remove half the pork, and add your fish and potatoes to the remainder; let it stand and steam five minutes without stirring; be careful not to let it burn; then add one-third cup milk and stir thoroughly; put the remainder of the pork around the edge of the spider, and a little butter over it; simmer it over a slow fire for half an hour, until a brown crust is formed^ when turn it over on a platter and serve. BEEF HASH. Chop fine cold beef, either boiled or baked; have ready cold boiled potatoes; to one pint of meat put one pint and a little more of potatoes, chopped fine; have ready a spider, with a good piece of butter in it; put in the hash; season with pepper and salt, and then add rich milk or cream. Milk is a very great improvement. CORNED BEEF HASH. One and one-half pounds nice corned beef, boiled ten- der and chopped fine; one-third more potatoes when chopped than meat; three large onions sliced fine and browned in butter, and when tender, add the meat and potatoes, well seasoned with salt and pepper; enough water to moisten. A small red pepper chopped fine is a great improvement. It is good without onions also.

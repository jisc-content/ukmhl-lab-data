PEACHES A LA UDE. From " In the Kitchen.'* Make a syrup of a pound of sugar and half a pint of water; when boiled and skimmed place in it five or six large peaches peeled and halved with the blanched kernels. Let them boil gently until clear, being careful not to break them. Skim them from the syrup and leave them to drain. Squeeze the juice of six lemons and add to the syrup with gelatine, which has been soaked half an hour and melted over boiling water. It must be used m the proportion of one ounce to a quart of syrup; wet a mould, pour in the jelly to the depth of half an inch, and let it harden on the ice; then fill the mould with alternate layers of peaches and half formed jelly, and place on the ice. Do not disturb it until perfectly stiff.

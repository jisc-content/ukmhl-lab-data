83 VALUABLE RECIPES. OYSTER PATTIES. Mrs. Thos. Orton. Stew the oysters; take the broth and allow the yolk of one egg to every dozen of oysters ; turn off the broth and add the eggs; let it come to a boil; then turn back the oysters and fill the crust. TO FEY OYSTEES. Mrs. Edward Ely. Roll a few crackers; beat two eggs ; wash your oysters or not, according to your notion, but the bits of shell must be removed ; dip your oysters into the egg, then into the rolled crackers; take half butter, and half lard in a spider, have it hot; (but not so hot that your oysters will burn ; ) fry them; then have a colander in a pan on the stove, and as soon as done, put into the colander to dry; when you have a dozen or so, take them out and put on a hot platter; salt to you taste. TO FEY OYSTEES. Mrs. D., and Mrs. T. V. Wadskier. Use the largest and best oysters ; lay them in rows upon a clean cloth and press another upon them, to absorb the moisture ; have ready several beaten eggs ; and in another dish some finely crushed crackers; in the frying pan heat enough butter to entirely cover the oysters; dip the oys- ters first into the eggs, then into the crackers, rolling it or them over that they may become well incrusted ; drop into the frying pan and fry quickly to a light brown. Serve dry and let the dish be warm. A chafing dish is best.

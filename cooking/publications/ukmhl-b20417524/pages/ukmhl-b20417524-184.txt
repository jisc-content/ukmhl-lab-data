THE HOME COOK BOOK. 180 SCALLOPED OYSTER PLANT. Boil the oyster plant until perfectly tender, then take out of water and rub through a colander; add butter, pepper, salt and milk, and mix well. Put in a baking dish and cover the top with bread crumbs, with here and there small pieces of butter. Set in the oven and bake a delicate brown. Celery salt may be used with this for flavor, not using quite the quantity of common salt. SALSIFY CROQUETTES. Are made prepared as above before baking. The mix- ture should be made thin into balls, dipped in beaten egg and rolled in bread crumbs, and fried as croquettes in wire baskets, always deep in hot lard until of a golde^^ brown.

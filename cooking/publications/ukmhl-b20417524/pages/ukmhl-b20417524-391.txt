VALUABLE RECIPES. 387 TO BOIL COEN BEEF. Mrs. E. A. Forsyth. Put into boiling water when you put it on to cook, and do not take it out of the pot when done, until cold. This will leave the meat juicy, instead of dry, when cold. TO PREVENT RED ANTS. Put one pint of tar in an earthen vessel, pour on it two quarts of boiling hot water, and place it in your closet. FOR PRESERVING EGGS. Mrs. B. F. Adams. To one pint of unslaked lime and one pint of salt, pour one pail of boiling water; when cold, pour over the eggs, having placed them in a jar or tub, with the small end of the egg down. CLEANING MARBLE. Mrs. Gray. Dissolve a large lump of Spanish whiting in water which has previously dissolved a teaspoon of washing soda, take only sufficient water to moisten the whiting, and it will become a paste; with a flannel cloth rub the marble well, leaving it on for a while and repeating the process two or three times, if necessary. Wash off with soap and water, then dry the marble well and polish with a soft duster. FURNITURE POLISH. No. I. Shellac varnish, linseed oil and spirits of wine, equal parts. No. 2. Linseed oil, alcohol, equal parts.

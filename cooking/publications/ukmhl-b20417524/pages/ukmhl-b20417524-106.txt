Lay a thick tender steak upon a gridiron over hot coals, having greased the bars with butter before the steak has been put upon it; (a steel gridiron with slender bars is to be preferred, the broad flat iron bars of grid- irons commonly used, fry and scorch the meat, imparting a disagreeable flavor.) When done on one side, have 'ready your platter warmed, with a little butter on it; lay the steak upon the platter with the cooked side down, tnat the juices which have gathered may run on the plat- ter, but do not press the meat; then lay your beefsteak again upon the gridiron quickly and cook the other side. When done to your liking, put again on the platter, spread lightly with butter, place where it will keep warm for a few moments, but not to let the butter become oily, (over boiling steam is best;) and then serve on hot plates. Beefsteak should never be seasoned with salt and pepper while cooking. If your meat is tough, pound well with a steak mallet on both sides. BEEF WITH TOMATOES. Mrs. P. B. Ayer.

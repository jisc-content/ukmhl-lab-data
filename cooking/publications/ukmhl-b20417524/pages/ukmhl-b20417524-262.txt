258 THE HOME COOK BOOK. to remember, that the syrup should be well skimmed before pouring over the fruit. We prefer the proportions of half a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit for canning, although many excellent housekeepers use less. This rule is excellent for all of the large fruitsâ€”as pears, quinces, apples, etc. PKESERVED PLUMS. Jennie June. Allow to every pound of fruit three-quarters of a pound of sugar; put into stone jars alternate layers of fruit and sugar, and place the jars in a moderately warm oven. Let them remain there until the oven is cool. If pre- pared at tea time let them remain until morning; then strain the juice from the plums, boil and clarify it. Re- move the fruit carefully to glass or china jars, pour over the hot syrup and carefully cover with egg, tissue paper, or thick white paper pasted, or bladder tied closely down. PRESERVED CHERRIES. Jennie June. Stone the fruit, weigh it, and for every pound take three-quarters of a pound of sugar. First dissolve the sugar in water in the proportion of a pint of water to a pound and a half of sugar; then add the fruit and let it boil as fast as possible for half an hour, till it begins to jelly. As soon as it thickens put in pots, cover with brandied paper, next the fruit, and then cover closely from the air.

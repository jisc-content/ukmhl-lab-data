THE HOME COOK BOOK. 26 from four dollars to seven dollars a year for each stove, whether for heating or cooking ; and its marvellous cheap- ness can hardly fail to bring it into general use wherever it can be had. Ordinary cook-stoves and ranges are everywhere, through the gas regions, being converted into gas-burners, by simply introducing a large perforated iron pipe into the fire box, and in this shape they do more effective culinary work with gas, than they did originally with wood or coal. May not progress in cookery be as rapid as in any other direction, when wood and coal stoves are super- seded by perfectly constructed gas stoves? And may not natural gas be an important factor in the introduc- tion of better cooked and more wholesome food to the millions who are suffering from a badly prepared, im- proper diet ? Emma P. Ewing.

THE HOME COOK BOOK. 266 LADY MAEY'S JELLY. From " In the Kitchen.'' Put half a pint of calf's foot jelly in a mould that has been rinsed with cold water. When stiff and firm, place on it a small bunch of fine hot house grapes and above them two peaches and a nectarine, placing them very carefully, remembering that the whole is to be reversed when turned from the mould. When the fruit is tastefully arranged, add jelly that is partly formed; pour it in slowly on both sides of the fruit, being sure that it fills all the interstices ; let it reach top of the fruit, and above this place two or three small glossy vine leaves and add a little jelly to keep them firm and fill the mould. It must be carefully turned out. To do this, either loosen from the mould with a knife, or wrap the mould a moment in a towel wrung from hot water. If in this last mode a little melted jelly should settle around the form absorb it with a soft napkin. The fruit may be varied at pleasure. Plums or strawberries, large and firm; nothing, however, from which the juice would come. OEANGE JELLY. From *' In the Kitchen."

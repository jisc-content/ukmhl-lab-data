FEUIT BLANC MANGE. Mrs. T. V. Wadskier. Stew nice fresh fruit (whatever you may please, cher- ries and raspberries being the best), strain off the juice, and sweeten to taste ; place it over the fire in a double kettle until it boils ; while boiling, stir in corn starch wet with a little cold water, allowing two tablespoons of starch for each pint of juice ; continue stirring until sufficiently cooked, then pour into moulds wet in cold water; set them away to cool.

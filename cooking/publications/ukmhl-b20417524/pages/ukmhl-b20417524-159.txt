Mince cold beef or lamb ; if beef put in a pinch of pul- verized cloves; if lamb, a pinch of summer savory to season it, very little pepper and some salt, and put it in a baking dish; mash potatoes and mix them with cream and butter and a little salt, and spread them over the meat; beat up an egg with cream or milk, a very little; spread it over the potatoes, and bake it a short time, suffic- ient to warm it through and brown the potatoes. POTATO PUFFS. S. S. Pierce. Take cold roast meat (either beef, veal or mutton) ; clear it from gristle; chop fine; season with pepper and salt; boil and mash some potatoes, and make them into a paste with one or two eggs; roll it out with a little flour; cut it round with a saucer; put your seasoned meat on one half; fold it over like a puff; turn it neatly round, and fry it a light brown. Nice for breakfast. POTATO PUFF. Anonymous. Mearly potato, nicely mashed and seasoned with rich milk, butter, salt, pepper and two eggs; the whites and yolks well beaten separately. Mix all lightly together, put in a pie dish and in the oven to brown. The crust is made richer by spreading with a little butter after putting in the oven.

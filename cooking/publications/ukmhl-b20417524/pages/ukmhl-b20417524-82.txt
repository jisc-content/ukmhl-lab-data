THE HOME COOK BOOK. 78 salt pork cut in thin slices; put a layer of pork in your kettle, then one of fish; one of potatoes in thick slices, and one of onions in slices; plenty of pepper and salt; repeat as long as your materials last, and finish with a layer of Boston crackers or crusts of bread. Water suffi- cient to cook with, or milk if you prefer. Cook one-half hour and turn over on your platter, disturbing as little as possible. Clams and eels the same way. FISH CHOWDER Mrs. R. A. Sibley. Four pounds of fresh fish skinned and cut in pieces; put in a pot some of the fish, then some crackers and sliced potatoes, salt and pepper; another layer of fish, crackers and potatoes; cover the whole with water; add a little onion, if liked, and some fried pork or butter; boil until the potatoes are done, then add a quart of milk and let it boil. When dishing for the table, take out all the large bones. Codfish or haddocks are the best; other fish will answer; use the head. POTTED FISH. Mrs. Gridley, Evanston. Take out the backbone of the fish; for one weighing two pounds take a tablespoon of allspice and cloves mixed; these spices should be put into little bags of not too thick muslin; put sufficient salt directly upon each fish; then roll in a cloth, over which sprinkle a little cayenne pepper; put alternate layers of fish, spice and sago in an earthern jar; cover with the best cider vinegar;

GENEEAL EULES FOE COOKING MEATS. All salt meat should be put on in cold water, that the salt may be extracted while cooking. F'resh meat, which is boiled to be served with sauces at the table, should be put to cook in boiling water, when the outer fibres con- tract, the inner juices are preserved. For making soup, put the meat over in cold water, to extract the juices for the broth. In boiling meats, if more water is needed, add that which is hot, and be careful to keep the water on the meat constantly boiling. Remove the scum when it first begins to boil. The more gently meat boils, the more tender it will become. Allow twenty minutes for boiling each pound of fresh meat. Roast meats require a brisk fire. Baste often. Twenty- minutes is required for roasting each pound of fresh meat.

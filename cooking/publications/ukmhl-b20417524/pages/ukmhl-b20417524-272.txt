THE HOME COOK BOOK. 268 pan of boiling water; pour more lukewarm water over the tapioca, if it has absorbed too much of the liquid and heat, stirring frequently. If too thick after it begins to clear, put in very little boiling water. When quite clear, put in the sugar and lemon. Pour into moulds. Eat cold with cream, flavoring with rose water and sweetened, GELATINE JELLY. Dissolve one ounce package of sparkling gelatine in a pint of cold water for one hour; add the rind and juice of two or three large lemons, one and a half pounds of sugar, then pour on this mixture one quart of boiling water, add one pint of orange or ras[)berry Juice, and pour into mould. This flavoring is very nice, and is to supersede the necessity of wine, which some consider indispensable in the same proportion. EHUBAEB JAM. Mrs. T. W. Anderson.

8 THE HOME COOK BOOK. tions, but with continual adaptation to improvements in materials and utensils. The housekeeper of the twenti- eth century will have learned that it is more satisfactory in the end to have simple food in perfect condition, than to strive after novelties, or disguise imperfect material with elaborate seasonings and high-sounding names. Processes and proportions will to some extent take the place of recipes, but cook-books will not lose their charm. There are many suggestions to be gained from these, even where a recipe cannot be followed strictly. In the yearsto come, housekeepers will have learned the power and value of cooperation, and many undertakings which are dreaded to-day will have lost their terror. Through cooperation, the fireplace has given way to the cookstove and the range, which are gradually yielding to the gas and oil stoves, and may ultimately be displaced by electrical appliances. In the same way greater per- fection has been attained in our food materials, much of the tedious preparation which our grandmothers were obliged t3 carry on in their individual homes now being done for the community by the aid of machinery. All this is eliminating the drudgery from our house- keeping, and in this way that problem of the present cen- tury, "the servant-girl question," may ultimately be solved. The hands which cannot be skilled in half a hundred trades, to carry on the manifold duties of gen- eral housework, can be trained to one, and in factories may be directed to prepare someone portion of the daily food ; while the housemother, with trained mind and deft fingers, and with water, steam, gas, and electricity at her command, may in the home blend the efforts of these outside laborers in the forms most pleasing and valuable to her own home circle.

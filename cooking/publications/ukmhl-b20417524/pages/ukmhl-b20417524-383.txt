VALUABLE RECIPES. 379 FOE CEYSTALIZING GEASS. Mrs. Ludlam, Evanston. Take one and one-half pounds of rock alum, pour on three pints of boiling water; when quite cool, put into a wide-mouth vessel, hang in your grasses, a few at a time. Do not let them get too heavy, or the stems will not sup- port them. You may again heat alum and add more grasses. By adding a little coloring, it will give variety. CAMPHOE ICE. Mrs. A. M. One ounce of lard, one ounce spermaceti, one ounce camphor, one ounce almond oil, one-half cake of white wax; melt and turn into moulds. CAMPHOE ICE. Mrs. Bartlett. One-half ounce each of camphor gum and white wax, spermaceti and sweet oil; melt slowly the hard ingre- dients and then add the oil. COLD CEEAM. Mrs. Anna Marble. Four ounces sweet almond oil, two of rose water, two of white wax, two of cocoa butter, two of spermaceti; put a bowl in a pan of boiling water; cut the spermaceti, white wax and cocoa butter in small pieces; put them in the bowl, also the oil and rose water. When melted, stir contents until cold.

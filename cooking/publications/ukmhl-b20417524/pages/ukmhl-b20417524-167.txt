After Marion Harland. Soak one cup of very dry fine bread crumbs in two scant cups of milk (rich and fresh, or it will curdle); beat into this three eggs whipped very light, add one small tablespoon of melted butter, pepper and salt, and lastly one-half a pound of old cheese grated. Butter a neat baking dish, pour the fondu into it; strew dry bread crumbs over the top, and bake in a quick oven a delicate brown. Serve immediately in the baking dish, as it soon falls. A delicious relish.

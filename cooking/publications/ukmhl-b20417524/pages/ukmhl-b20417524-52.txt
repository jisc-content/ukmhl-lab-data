(48) SERVANTS. There is, in this country, a foolish prejudice against the term "Servant." Why? What is the true meaning of the word? A slave? No. An inferior? Not necessa- rily. The definiton is very simple : "One who serves or labors for another." What is there degrading in that ? Every one is, or should be, laboring for or serving others. That there are different degrees of servitude, no one will deny. The rank or position of each one who serves must depend largely on the ability of the servitor, and the qual- ity or character of the work he offers to his employer. The President is the " servant " of the people ; the law- yer, of his client; the physician, of his patient; the cler- gyman, of his church and congregation; the mechanic, of those needing his special services; the laboring man, of the farmer; and the cook, of the mistress of the house. Each receives compensation in accordance with the importance of the services rendered, and the terms mutually agreed on. This is true in every profession, in all business, from the highest to the lowest. In every department there are cer- tain stipulations to be accepted before service is rendered, and each party, employer, as well as employee, is bound to fullfil his part of the contractâ€”the lawyer who demands and receives his fifty thousand dol.ar fee, as much as the cook in the kitchen, who has such wages as she herself demands;

144 THE HOME COOK BOOK. PICKLED CUCUMBEES. Mrs. Packard. Wash with care your cucumbers, and place in jars. Make a weak brine (a handful of salt to a gallon and a half of water.) When scalding hot, turn over the cucum- bers and cover; repeat this process three mornings in succession, taking care to skim thoroughly. On the fourth day have ready a porcelain kettle of vinegar, to which has been added a piece of alum the size of a wal- nut. When scalding hot, put in as many cucumbers as may be covered with the vinegar; do not let them boil, but skim off as soon as scalded through, and replace with others, adding each time a small piece of alum. When this process is through, throw out the vinegar and replace with good cider or white wine vinegar; add spices, mus- tard seed and red peppers. Sort the pickles and place in stone or glass jars, turn over the hot spiced vinegar; seal and put away the jars not needed for immediate use. Pickles thus prepared are fine and crisp at the expiration of a year. Those that are kept in open-mouth jars may be covered with a cloth, which will need to be taken off and rinsed occasionally. I prefer green peppers, and prepare them with cucumbers in brine. They are not as apt to become soft. GREEN" TOMATO PICKLES. Mrs. J. L. Harris, Keokuk, Iowa. Chop one-half peck tomatoes, three onions, a gill of horse-radish, three green peppers; put them in a sieve and drain dry, salt in layers and let them stand one night;

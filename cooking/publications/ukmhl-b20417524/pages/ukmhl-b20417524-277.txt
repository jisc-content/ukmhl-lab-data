VALUABLE KECIPES. 273 half pints of water, dissolve in the water before putting with the sugar, one-quarter of an ounce of fine white gum arabic and when added to the sugar put in one tea- spoon of cream of tartar. The candy should not be boiled quite to the brittle stage. The proper degree can be ascertained if, when a small skimmer is put in and taken out, when blowing through the holes of the skim- mer, the melted sugar is forced through in feathery filaments ; remove from the fire at this point and rub the syrup against the sides of the dish with an iron spoon. If it is to be a chocolate candy, add two ounces of chocolate finely sifted and such flavoring as you prefer, vanilla, rose or orange. If you wish to make cocoanut candy, add this while soft and stir until cold. One pound sugar, one and a half cups water, three tablespoons rose water; boil twenty minutes; then pull. CANDY. Carrie A.

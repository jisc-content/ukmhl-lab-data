196 THE HOME COOK BOOK. STEAMED BATTER PUDDING. Mrs. L. H. Davis. Two eggs and one tablespoon of sugar beaten together, one cup of milk, two cups flour, one tablespoon melted butter, half teaspoon soda, one teaspoon cream tartar; beat well, and pour the batter over either sliced apples or peaches, and steam one hour and a quarter; this will fill a three pint basin. Serve with hot sauce. BATTER PUDDING. One quart of milk, twelve tablespoons of flour, nine eggs, a teaspoon of salt; beat the yolks thoroughly; stir in the flour and add the milk slowly; beat the whites of the eggs to a froth, and add the last thing; put in a tin pudding mould, having a tight cover, and boil two hours; the mould should not be full as the pudding will swell; the water must not stop boiling. Eat with liquid sauce. AMHERST PUDDING. Mrs. F. M. Cragin.

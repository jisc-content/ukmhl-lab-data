When perfectly cold mix it well, as the upper part is drier than the rest; put it in parts on the pasteboard, a tablespoon for each part. Have bread crumbs on the pasteboard, then make them into any form required. Dip each croquette in beaten egg; roll in bread crubs again and fry in hot fat. Garnish each croquette with a sprig of parsley. CHICKEN CROQUETTES. Marion Harland.

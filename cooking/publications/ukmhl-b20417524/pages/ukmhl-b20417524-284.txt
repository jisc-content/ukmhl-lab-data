GOOD YEAST. Mrs. Packard. Grate six good sized potatoes (raw); have ready a gallon of water in which has been well boiled three hand- fuls of hops ; strain through a cloth or sieve, while boil- ing hot, over the potatoes, stirring until well cooked, or the mixture thickens like starch; add one teacup of sugar, one-half cup of salt; when sufficiently cool, one cup of good yeast. Let it stand until a thick foam rises upon the top. Care must be taken not to bottle too soon, or the bottles may burst. Use one coffee cup of yeast to six loaves of bread. If kept in a cool place this yeast will last a long time, and housekeepers need not fear having sour bread.

When good, the skin will be thin and smooth. Reject it if the flesh be flabby or clammy to the touch ; and if there are kernels in the fat, it will be dangerous food. As soon as meat is brought in from the butcher's, wipe it dry with a clean cloth. Common fowls will be plump on the breast and fat on the back if good; when young, the legs and combs are smooth. Turkeys, when fresh killed, will have clear, full eyes and moist feet. In old birds the legs are rough and reddish; in the young, smooth and black. When geese are old, the bills and feet are red; when young, yellow. If fresh killed, the feet will be pliable; if too long kept, they will be stiff. Ducks and pigeons, when in good condition and fresh, will have plump breasts and pliable feet. These are simply general directions, but quite necessary if one would be an expert in marketing. Without some guide, by which to judge of the quality and value of articles needed in the home department, and especially of the food, on which so much of health and comfort for the family depends, the most experienced would often fmd their duties very trying; but for those just entering the field, and too poorly fitted for the work before them, there must be something definite and reliable, to assist while learning the way.

386 THE HOME COOK BOOK. COLOEING COTTON OAEPET EAGS. Mrs. S. I. Parker, Channahon, 111. Blue.—For five pounds of cloth, take five ounces of copperas, with two pails of water in a tin or copper boiler; set it over the fire till the copperas is dissolved and it be- gins to heat, then put in the cloth, stirring it frequently till it boils, one-half or three-fourths of an hour; then re- move the cloth where it can drain; pour away the cop- peras water and take two ounces of prussiate of potash in about two pails of water in the same vessel; when it is well dissolved and hot, put in the cloth from the copperas water, stirring it thoroughly till it boils, one-half an hour, then remove the cloth; add (with care and caution, ou account of the spattering which ensues,) one tablespooi^ of oil of vitroil, and stir it well in the dye; replace the cloth, stirring it briskly till it has boiled one-half an hour. Should be well rinsed and washed in clear water to pre- vent the dye from making it tender after coloring. Yellow.—For five pounds of cloth, dissolve one-half pound of sugar of lead in a tub of warm water and twelve ounces of bichromate of potash in another tub of cold water; soak, rinse, and wring the cloth in the lead water first, then in the other, and return from one to the other till the right shade of color is obtained. Orange.—Dip the yellow colored cloth into strong lim^ water—if it should not turn, boil it, rinse all well. Green.—Put your blue cloth in the yellow dye in the same manner as for coloring yellow. Old calico will take a darker shade of blue or green in the same dye with the white cloth.

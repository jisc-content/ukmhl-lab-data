Boil it like other syrup; skim, and bottle when cold. BLACKBERRY SYRUP. Mrs. Bausher. To one pint of juice, put one pound of white sugar, one- half ounce of powdered cinnamon, one-fourth ounce mace, and two teaspoons cloves ; boil all together for quarter of an hour, then strain the syrup, and add to each pint a glass of French brandy. LEMO^T SYRUP. Mrs. De Forrest. Pare off the yellow rind of the lemon, slice the lemon and put a layer of lemon and a thick layer of sugar in a deep plate; cover close with a saucer, and set in a warm place.

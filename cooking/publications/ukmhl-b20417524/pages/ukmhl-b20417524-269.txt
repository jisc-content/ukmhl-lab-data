Wheeler. Use the currants when they first ripen ; pick them from the stems and put them on the stove in a stone jar, bruis- ing them with a wooden spoon ; then when warm, squeeze through a coarse cloth or flannel, and put the juice on in 1 new tin pan or porcelain kettle; one quart of juice requires two pounds of sugar, or a pound to a pint; boil fifteen minutes; to be a nice color, the currants should not come in contact with iron spoons or tin dishes, unless new and bright; should be made quickly. It never fails to jelly good if the currants are not too ripe. The same method for jam, only do not strain the currants, but mash them well. Currants should not be dead ripe for jelly or jam. GOOSEBERRY JELLY. E. M. Walker. Boil six pounds of green unripe gooseberries in six pints of water (they must be well boiled, but not burst too much); pour them into a basin, and let them stand cov- ered with a cloth for twenty-four hours, then strain through a jelly bag, and to every pint of juice add one pound of sugar. Boil it for an hour, then skim it, and boil for one- half hour longer with a sprig of vanilla.

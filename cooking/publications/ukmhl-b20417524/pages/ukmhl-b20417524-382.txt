378 THE HOME COOK BOOK. too hot the leaf will shrivel â€” if too cool it will harden in lumps on the leaf. Another method is to iron each leaf with a middling hot iron until the moisture is all out of them. Are best without varnish. SKELETON LEAYES. Boil the leaves in equal parts of rain water and soft soap until you can separate the pulp from the skin ; take them out into clear water ; lay the leaf to be cleaned on glass, the upper side of the leaf next to the glass; then with a tooth-brush remove all pulp and skin, turn the leaf and repeat the process; when thoroughly done, put the leaf to bleach in this solution: One pound sal soda, dissolved in five pints rain water; one-half pound chlo- ride of lime, in three pints water; allow twenty-four hours for the latter to dissolve. Strain out the sediment, and pour the clear solution of lime into the solution of sal soda. The result will be a thick butter-milk solution, otherwise the lime was not strong enough. Filter this until it is perfectly clear. For leaves, use one part of solution to one part of water; for ferns, use the solution full strength. When perfectly white, remove to clear water; let stand for several hours, changing two or three times; the last water should be a little blue; float out on paper, press in books when nearly dry. In mounting use mucilage made of five parts of gum arabic, three parts white sugar, two parts of starch; add a very little water, boil and stir until thick and white.

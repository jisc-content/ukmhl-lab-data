248 THE HOME COOK BOOK. A SIMPLE DESSERT. A. S. Ewing. Put a teacup of tapioca into sufficient cold water; boil until the lumps become almost transparent; squeeze the juice of two lemons partially into the mixture, then slice them into it, sweeten or not, then eat when cold, with cream and sugar. JELLIED GEAPES. Mrs. A. M. Lewis. A very delicate dish, is made of one-third of a cup of rice, two cups of grapes, half a cup of water, and two spoons of sugar. Sprinkle the rice and sugar among the grapes, while placing them in a deep dish ; pour on the water, cover close and simmer two hours slowly in the oven. Serve cream as sauce, or cold as pudding. If served warm as pudding, increase slightly the proportion of rice and sugar.

10 THE HOME COOK BOOK. THE ENTRANCE HALL. Entering a house from the bright sunlight the eye tolerates an excess of color and light. For this reason the carpets and fittings may be as rich as the circum- stances of the occupants will permit. Gilding and brass-work is admissible, shown in lanterns, rods, etc. Rugs laid upon the floor-tiles or marbles, or a rather nar- row carpet to aflord footing upon the polished wood of floor and stairway, and door-hangings in harmonious contrast, go far towards furnishing the entrance hall. If there is space, an open fireplace gives an air of comfort that no other eflect can produce ; its glancing flames and the radiance of a bright colored lantern are the very lights of home. A few comfortable or picturesque chairs or benches, and some receptable for hats and umbrellas, will sufhce for furniture. CARPETS AND RUGS. The choice of carpeting for halls and rooms should be decided by fitness and cost. The prevailing tendency is to dark, rich colors for halls, stairways, and well- lighted south rooms; light colors are best for north rooms and bed-chambers, and neutral tints for parlors and living-rooms where the furniture is varied in color and eflect; drawing-rooms call for careful treatment, elaborate in proportion to other conditions. Carpets and hangings should harmonize, and their colors combine well with walls and furniture. For con- stant wear body brussels is one of the most durable of ordinary carpets; ingrains of good quality answer well in sleeping-rooms, preferably made into rugs. Oriental

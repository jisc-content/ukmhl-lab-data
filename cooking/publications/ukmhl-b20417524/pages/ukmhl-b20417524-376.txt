MISCELLANEOUS. What does cookery mean ? It means the knowledge of all fruits and herbs and balms and spices, and of all that is healing and sweet in fields and groves, and savory in meats. It means carefulness, and inventiveness, and watchfulness, and willingness, and readiness of appliance. It means the economy of your great grandmother and the science of modern chemists. It means much tasting and no wasting; it means English thoroughness, and French art, and Arabian hospitality; and it means, in fine, that you are to be perfectly and always ladies — loaf givers; and as you are to see imperatively that everybody has something pretty to put on, so you are to see even yet more imperatively that everybody has something nice to eat. — RusKiN.

Always sift soda, when not dissolved in hot water, through a fine wire sieve. Sugar for fried cakes should be dissolved in the milk, to prevent the cake from absorbing the lard while frying. (872)

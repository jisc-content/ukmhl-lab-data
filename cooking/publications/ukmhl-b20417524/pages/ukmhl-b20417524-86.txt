THE HOME COOK BOOK. 82 are on them; then add a layer of oysters with butter, a little pepper, and continue adding a layer of crackers and oysters until the dish is full; have the top layer crackers; strain over the whole the liquor; bake half an hour. OYSTER PIE. Anonymous. Take a large dish, butter it, and spread a rich paste over the sides and around the edge, but not on the bot- tom. The oysters should be as large and fine as possible; drain off part of the liquor from the oysters; put them into a pan, and season them with pepper, salt, spice and butter; have ready the yolks of three boiled eggs chopped fine, and grated bread crumbs; pour the oysters with as much of their liquor as you please into the dish with the paste, strew over them the chopped eggs and grated bread ; roll out the lid of the pie and put it on, crimping the edges. Bake in a quick oven. Nice also, with a gill of cream added, and a little flour. OYSTER PATTIES. Aunt Maggie. Make some rich puff paste and bake it in very small tin patty pans; when cool, turn them out upon a large dish; stew some large fresh oysters with a few cloves, a little mace and nutmeg; then add the yolk of one egg, boiled hard and grated; add a little butter, and as much of the oyster liquor as will cover them. When they have stewed a little while, take them out of the pan and set them to cool. When quite cold, lay two or three oysters in each shell of puff paste.

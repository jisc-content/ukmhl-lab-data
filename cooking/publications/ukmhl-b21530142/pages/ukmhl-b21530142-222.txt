196 GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY Coat some well-dried, cold, poached eggs with white chaud- froid sauce; garnish with pieces of tarragon leaves, and glaze with jelly. Turn out the tartlet-moulds; set an egg on each of the mouldings, and arrange them in a circle on a dish, placing between each egg a piece of very clear jelly, cut to the shape of a cockâ€™s comb. Garnish the centre of the dish with chopped jelly.

CHAPTER XVIII VEGETABLES AND FARINACEOUS PRODUCTS The preparatory treatment of vegetables—parboiling and braising, &c.—having been explained in Chapter X., as also the preparation of purges, creams, and vegetable garnishes, it is now only necessary to deal with each vegetable separately. Artichokes (Artichauts) 2028— ARTICHAUTS A LA BARIGOULE Take some very fresh and tender artichokes. After having trimmed their tops, take off the outermost leaves; parboil the artichokes; remove their hearts, and completely clear them of their chokes. Season them inside, and fill them with a pre- paration of Duxelles (No. 224), combined with a quarter of its weight of fresh, grated, fat bacon, and as much butter. Wrap the stuffed artichokes in thin slices of bacon; string them, and set them in a saucepan prepared for braising. Braise them gently with white wine, and cook them well. When about to serve them, remove the string and the bacon, and dish them. Strain the braising-liquor, and clear it of grease; thicken it with the necessary quantity of good half-glaze sauce; reduce it sufficiently to produce only a very little sauce, and pour the latter over the artichokes. 2029— CCEURS D’ARTICHAUTS A LA CLAMART Select some very tender small artichokes, and trim them. Set them in a buttered cocotte, with a small quartered carrot and three tablespoonfuls of freshly-shelled peas to each artichoke, add a large faggot and a little water, and salt moderately. Cover and cook gently in a steamer. When about to serve, withdraw the faggot, and slightly thicken the liquor with a little manied butter. Serve the preparation in the cocotte.

797 ICES 2791—MANDARINES GLACEES Cut the tangerines on top, with a round, even cutter, in such- wise as to remove a roundel of their peel with the stalk attached, and two leaves adhering thereto. With the juice of the tangerines prepare some tangerine ice, after the directions given under Fruit-ice Preparations. Fill the tangerines with this ice ; cover them with the roundels removed at the start ; and, with a brush, sprinkle the rinds of the fruit with water, and place them in a refrigerator. As soon as the tangerines are coated with frost, serve them on a napkin. 2792—MANDARINES GLACEES AUX PERLES DES ALPES Empty the tangerines as above, and garnish them inside with tangerine mousse, with which Chartreuse bon-bons have been mixed. Cover them, and frost them as directed above. 2793—GLACE MARIE-THERESE Take a Madeleine-mould; clothe it with chocolate ice, and fill it with vanilla-flavoured Chantilly cream. After turning out, decorate it with pine-apple ice. 2794—MERINGUES GLACEES Garnish some meringue shells with some kind of spoon- moulded ice, and set them on a napkin. Or, garnish the shells more sparingly and join them together in twos. 2795— GLACE PLOMBIERE Take a parfait mould. Garnish it with vanilla-ice cream combined with candied fruit, macerated in Kirsch; spreading the preparation in alternate layers with apricot jam. COUPES. We are now concerned with bowls garnished, either with differently-flavoured ices, or with ices combined with Chantilly cream or candied fruit. The bowls used for this purpose should be of crystal. 2796— COUPES D’ANTIGNY Three-parts fill the bowls with Alpine-strawberry ice, or, failing this, four-seasons strawberry ice, combined with very light and strongly-flavoured raw cream. The two most perfect examples of this cream are the “ Fleurette Normande,” and that which in the South of France is called “Creme Ni^oise,” and which comes from Alpine pastures.

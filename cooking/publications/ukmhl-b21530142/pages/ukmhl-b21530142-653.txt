617 LES ROTIS ET LES SALADES 1987—CELERY SALAD For salads, only the fibreless, white celery is used—com- monly known as English celery. Cut it into pieces, and cisel these into very thin strips without altogether separating the latter at their base. Place in cold water for a few hours, that the strips may curl; drain and season with a mustard sauce with cream. 1988—CELERIAC SALAD Cut the celeriac into a fine julienne or faysanne. Season, according to fancy, with a mustard sauce with cream, or a clear mayonnaise sauce containing plenty of mustard. 1989— CAULIFLOWER SALAD Divide the cooked and somewhat firm cauliflowers into small bunches, cleared of all stalk. Season with oil and vinegar, and flavour with chopped chervil. 1990— RED-CABBAGE SALAD Suppress the midribs of the leaves; cut the leaves into a julienne, and season them with oil and vinegar six hours in advance. The julienne of cabbages may be parboiled for a few minutes to modify the rawness of the vegetable; it should then be cooled and seasoned as above. 1991—CUCUMBER SALAD Peel and thinly slice them; sprinkle the slices with table- salt, and let them stand for two hours. Dry, and season them with oil, vinegar, and chopped chervil. 1992—HARICOT BEANS AND LENTIL SALADS, ETC. Thoroughly drain the vegetable, whatever be its kind; season with oil and vinegar, and add some chopped parsley. Serve separately some thinly-ciseled, washed, and pressed onion. 1993—POTATO SALAD Cut some long, fair-sized potatoes, cooked in salted water and lukewarm, to the shape of corks, and divide up the latter into thin roundels. Season with oil and vinegar, and add some chopped herbs. 1994—POTATO SALAD A LA PARISIENNE Select potatoes which do not crumble, such as the vitelottes or new kidney potatoes. Cook them in salted water; cut them to the shape of corks, and slice them (while still lukewarm) into thin roundels. Put them into a salad-bowl, and sprinkle them with two-thirds pint of white wine per two lbs. of potatoes.

384 GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY recipe of that name, i.e., braised cabbages, glazed carrots and turnips, potatoes a Vanglaise, rectangles of lean bacon, and roundels of sausage. 1158—LANGUES DE B(EUF FROIDES Ox tongues intended for cold dishing should be kept in brine (No. 172) for eight or ten days. When about to use them, put them to soak in cold water for a few hours, and then cook them plainly in water for three hours. This done, withdraw them from their cooking-liquor; skin them; cover them with buttered paper, and let them cool. The object of the paper is to keep off the air, the tendency of which is to blacken the surface of the meat. When quite cool, coat the tongues with a glaze composed of cne-half lb. of gelatine dissolved in one pint of water; the latter is given a scarlet tint by means of carmine and caramel. Cold ox tongues are dished amidst aspic jelly dice and curled- leaf parsley. N.B.—The gelatine glaze described above will be found a great improvement upon the coating of reddened gold-beaters’ skin. OX TAILS. Ox tails, sectioned or unsectioned, are usually braised, and only the thicker half of the caudal appendage is ever used. 1159— QUEUE DE BCEUF A L’AUVERGNATE Section the tail, and braise it in white wine, after recipe No. 247. Prepare a garnish of rectangles of lean bacon, large chestnuts cooked in consomm^ and glazed, and small onions cooked in butter. Put the sections of the tail in an earthenware cocotte with the garnish. 1160— QUEUE DE BCEUF A LA CAVOUR Section the tail, and braise it in a moistening two-thirds of which is brown stock and one-third white wine. It is well for the moistening to be somewhat abundant. Set to cook very gently, until the meat falls from the bones, i.e., for a matter of about four and one-half or five hours. This done, dish the sections of the tail in a cocotte; add some small, cooked mushrooms; clear the cooking-liquor of grease; reduce it, and thicken it slightly with fecula. Strain

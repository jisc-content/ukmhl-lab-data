GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY 588 Clothe a dome-mould with clear aspic jelly, and deck it with truffles. Set the collops of pheasant and the chaud-froid-coated truf- fles inside, alternating the two in so doing; fill up the mould with the same jelly, and let it set on ice. When about to serve, turn out after the manner of an aspic, on a low cushion of rice or semolina, lying on a round dish. Border with neatly-cut croutons of very clear aspic. ,855—FAI5AN A LA CROIX DE BERNY Roast the pheasant and keep it underdone. When it is quite cold, raise its fillets and leave the legs and the wings attached to the carcass. By means of scissors, completely bone the carcass; garnish its inside with a truffled foie-gras Parfait, and cover it with a thin coat of foie-gras Mousse. Replace the fillets upon this Mousse, after having sliced them, and fill any gaps that may exist between the slices with some of the same Mousse : thus reconstructing the bird. Let the Mousse set thoroughly, and glaze with aspic jelly. Meanwhile, coat eight boned, stuffed, poached and cold larks with brown chaud-froid sauce. Decorate them with pieces of truffle and salted tongue, and glaze them with aspic jelly Dish the pheasant on a low cushion ; surround it with the larks, and garnish the gaps between the latter with chopped and very clear aspic. 1856—FAISAN EN DAUBE Proceed as for “ Terrine de Poularde k la gel£e ” (No. 1701), making due allowance, in the cooking, for the difference between the sizes of the two birds. , 857—COTELETTES DE FAISAN Proceed as for “ Cotelettes froides de Volaille.” 1858— GALANTINE DE FAISAN See “ Galantine de Volaille ” (No. 1708). 1859— MOUSSE DE FAISAN Prepare the Mousse according to the usual procedure, and mould it after the manner of “Mousse de Volaille” (No. 1711). 1860— PAIN DE FAISAN EN BELLE-VUE The procedure follows that of No. 1709, but for the difference in the basic ingredient, which in this case is pheasant.

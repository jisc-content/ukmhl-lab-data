CHAPTER IV COLD SAUCES AND COMPOUND BUTTERS 121— AIOLI SAUCE, OR PROVENCE BUTTER Pound one oz. of garlic cloves as finely as possible in a mortar, and add the yolk of one raw egg, a pinch of salt, and one-half pint of oil, letting the latter gradually fall in a thread and wielding the pestle meanwhile, so as to effect a complete amalgamation. Add a few drops of lemon juice and cold water to the sauce as it thickens, these being to avoid its turning. Should it decompose while in the process of making or when made, the only thing to be done is to begin it again with the yolk of an egg. 122— ANDALOUSE SAUCE Take the required quantity of Mayonnaise sauce (No. 126) and add to it the quarter of its volume of very red and con- centrated tomato pur£e, and finally add two oz. of capsicum cut finely, Julienne-fashion, per pint of sauce. 123— BOHEMIAN SAUCE Put in a bowl one-quarter pint of cold Bechamel, the yolks of four eggs, a little table salt and white pepper. Add a quart of oil and three tablespoonfuls of tarragon vinegar, proceeding as for the Mayonnaise. Finish the sauce with a tablespoonful of mustard. 124— GENOA SAUCE Pound in a mortar, and make into a smooth, fine paste, one oz. of pistachios and one oz. of fir-apple kernels, or, if these are not available, one oz. of sweet almonds; add one-half table- spoonful of cold Bechamel. Put this paste into a bowl, add the yolks of six eggs, a little salt and pepper, and finish the sauce with one quart of oil, the juice of two lemons, and proceed as for the Mayonnaise.

456 GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY PORK Releves and Entrees. 1383— FRESH LEG OF PORK 1384— FRESH PORK FILLETS *385—FRESH NECK OF PORK Releves of fresh pork are only served at family and bourgeois meals. They are always roasts and allow of all the dry or fresh vegetable garnishes, as wrell as the various vegetable purges, and the pastes, such as macaroni, noodles, polenta, gnochi, &c. I shall, therefore, give only a few recipes, and shall select Fresh Neck of Pork as the typical joint. 1386— FRESH NECK OF PORK A LA CHOUCROtiTE Roast the neck of pork and withdraw it from the oven a few minutes before it is done. Keep it in the stove for an hour, that its cooking may be completed gently; but remember, that if a stove is not avail- able, the cooking of the piece should be well finished in the oven; for pork is indigestible when it is not thoroughly well cooked. Meanwhile, prepare a garnish of sauerkraut (No. 2097), and, during the last hour of its cooking, sprinkle it frequently with the fat of the neck. Dish the neck; clear the sauerkraut of any superfluous fat, and set it round the piece of meat in spoonfuls; slightly pressing it in so doing. 1387— FRESH NECK OF PORK WITH BRUSSELS SPROUTS Roast the neck of pork. Three-parts cook the Brussels sprouts; completely drain them, and put them round the piece of meat, that they may complete their cooking in its gravy and fat, being frequently basted the while. For this preparation it is well to roast the neck in an earthen- ware dish, in which it may be served with its garnish—a much better plan than that of transferring it to another dish. 1388— FRESH NECK OF PORK WITH RED CABBAGE A LA FLAMANDE Roast the neck of pork; dish it and surround it with a garnish of red cabbages, prepared h la Flamande (No. 2098).

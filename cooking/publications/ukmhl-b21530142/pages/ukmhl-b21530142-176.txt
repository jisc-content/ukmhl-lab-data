GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY 15o strips of the vegetable. Add an equal quantity of pimentos cut into strips, and season as in the case of cucumber salad. 333— YORK CONES Cut slices from a York ham as thinly as possible, and trim them to the shape of triangles. Roll the triangles into cones, and garnish their insides (by means of a piping-bag fitted with a grooved pipe) with any butter or cream. (See Nos. 280 to 299.) 334— TONGUE CONES Proceed as for York Cones. 335— MOULDED CREAMS Prepare a hors-d’oeuvre cream in accordance with any one of the recipes (Nos. 294 to 299). Put this cream into very small, slightly-oiled, and ornamented moulds, and leave it to set in the cool or on ice. Empty the moulds, at the moment of dishing up, either directly upon a dish, on tartlets garnished with a pur£e in keeping with the cream, or on toast. With these moulded creams1 endless varieties of delicate and recom- mendable little hors-d’oeuvres may be prepared, while in their preparation the moulds used in pastry for “ petits fours ” may serve a useful purpose. 336— SHRIMPS AND PRAWNS Get these very fresh and serve them on boat-shaped hors- d’oeuvre dishes, arranging them so that they overlap one another. Either garnish the middle of the dishes with curled- leaf parsley, or lay the crustacean directly upon parsley. 337— DUCHESSES This hors-d’oeuvre is almost equivalent to the Carolines (No. 325), except that the shape of the Duchesses is that of little clioux, about the size of a pigeon’s egg, and that, as a rule, they are merely glazed with some melted jelly, and not covered with a chaud-froid sauce. Sprinkle them with chopped pistachios, and serve them very cold on ornamented dish-papers. 338— NANTUA DUCHESSES Stuff the little choux, referred to above, with crayfish pur^e, and sprinkle them, again and again, with cold, melted jelly, in order to cover them with a transparent film.

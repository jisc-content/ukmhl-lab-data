Souffled Fritters 2427— ORDINARY SOUFFLED FRITTERS Put one pint of water, three and a half oz. of butter, a pinch of salt and two pinches of sugar into a saucepan. Boil ; take the utensil off the fire in order to add two-thirds lb. of sifted flour, and mix up the whole. Then dry this paste as directed for pate a choux (No. 2373); and finish it, away from the fire, with seven eggs, added one by one. Flavour according to taste. Take this paste in portions, the size of small walnuts ; put these portions in moderately hot fat, and gradually increase the heat of the latter, so as to ensure the rising of the paste. When the fritters are quite dry outside, drain them ; dish them on a napkin, and sprinkle them with icing sugar. 2428— SOUFFLED FRITTERS “ EN SURPRISE ” Prepare the fritters exactly like the preceding ones.

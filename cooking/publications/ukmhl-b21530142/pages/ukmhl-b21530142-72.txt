46 GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY 114— CELERY SAUCE Clean six stalks of celery (only use the hearts), put them in a saut^pan, wholly immerse in consomm^, add a faggot and one onion with a clove stuck in it, and cook gently. Drain the celery, pound it in a mortar, then rub it through a tammy and put the purde in a stewpan. Now thin the purde with an equal quantity of cream sauce and a little reduced celery liquor. Heat it moderately, and, if it has to wait, put it in a bain-marie. This sauce is suited to boiled or braised poultry. It is excellent, and has been adopted in French cookery. 115— CRANBERRY SAUCE Cook one pint of cranberries with one quart of water in a stewpan, and cover the stewpan. When the berries are cooked drain them in a fine sieve through which they are strained. To the purde thus obtained add the necessary quantity of their cooking liquor, so as to make a somewhat thick sauce. Sugar should be added according to the taste of the consumer. This sauce is mostly served with roast turkey. It is to be bought ready-made, and, if this kind be used, it need only be heated with a little water. 116— FENNEL SAUCE Take one pint of butter sauce (No. 66) and finish it with two tablespoonfuls of chopped fennel, scalded for a few seconds. This is principally used with mackerel. 117— EGG SAUCE WITH MELTED BUTTER Dissolve one-quarter pound of butter, and add to it the necessary salt, a little pepper, half the juice of a lemon, and three hard-boiled eggs (hot and cut into large cubes); also a teaspoonful of chopped and scalded parsley. 118— SCOTCH EGG SAUCE Make a white roux with one and one-half oz. of butter and one oz. of flour. Mix in one pint of boiling milk, season with salt, white pepper, and nutmeg, and boil gently for ten minutes. Then add three hot hard-boiled eggs, cut into cubes (the whites and the yolks). This sauce usually accompanies boiled fish, especially fresh haddocks and fresh and salted cod.

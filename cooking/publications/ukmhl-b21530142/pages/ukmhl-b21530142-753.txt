ENTREMETS 715 HOT SWEETS Fritters The numerous fritter recipes for sweets may all be grouped into five leading classes, viz.:— (1) Fruit fritters. (2) Custard fritters. (3) Viennese fritters. (4) Souffl^d fritters. (5) Sundry other fritters which are more or less like the four former ones without entirely resembling them. 2419—Class 1. FRESH FRUIT AND FLOWER FRITTERS Subject to the treatment undergone by them, fruits for fritters are of two kinds : firm fruits, such as apples and pears, and aqueous fruits, such as strawberries, &c. 420—FRITTERS OF FRUIT WITH FIRM PULPS Ex. APRICOT FRITTERS Select some apricots that are not over-ripe; cut them in two ; sprinkle them with sugar, and set them to macerate for an hour in kirsch, brandy, or rum, subject to the consumers’ tastes. A few minutes before serving, dry the halved apricots, dip them in batter (No. 234), and fry them in hot fat. Drain them on a napkin ; set the fritters on a tray ; cover them with icing sugar, and glaze them in a hot oven or at the salamander. Dish them on a napkin, and serve them at once. N.B.—Proceed in precisely the same way for Apple, Pear, Peach, or Banana fritters. 2421—AQUEOUS-FRUIT FRITTERS Ex. STRAWBERRY FRITTERS Select some large, somewhat firm strawberries; sugar them copiously; sprinkle them with kirsch, and let them macerate on ice for thirty minutes. It is most essential that the strawberries be well sugared before macerating, because the heat of the fat sours them while the fritters are being fried, and they consequently become tart. A few minutes before serving, drain the strawberries, dip them in batter (No. 234), and plunge them into very hot fat. Drain them, dish them on lace paper, and sprinkle them with icing sugar, by means of a dredger.

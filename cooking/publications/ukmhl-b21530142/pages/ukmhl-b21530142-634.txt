598 GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY 1897— CAILLES SOUS LA CENDRE Stuff the quails with a little smooth truffled game force- meat, and wrap them each in a buttered vine-leaf, followed by a slice of bacon, and finally by two sheets of buttered paper. Place them on the hearth-stone; cover them with very hot cinders, and cook thus for thirty-five minutes, taking care to renew the hot cinders from time to time. When about to serve them, remove the outside covering of paper which is charred, but leave the other coverings. N.B.—A log fire is essential for this recipe. 1898— CAILLES SOUVAROFF Prepare these as described under “ Faisan & la Souvaroff ” (No. 1845). 1899— CAILLES A LA TURQUE Truss the quails as for an entree; brown them in butter, and complete their cooking in pilaff rice, combined with a quarter of its weight of cooked and chopped egg-plant pulp. Set the rice in a pyramid on a dish; place the quails all round (upright against the rice), and surround with a thread of quail fumet. ,900—TIMBALE DE CAILLES ALEXANDRA Coat a well-buttered timbale mould with patty paste, and line it with slices of bacon so as to completely cover the paste. The slices of bacon in this case are there to prevent the mois- tening of the timbale from reaching the paste. Insert a piece of foie gras into each quail; stiffen them in butter, and set them against the sides of the timbale in successive tiers. Completely garnish the middle with small, peeled truffles; add one-quarter pint of excellent stock with Madeira (per six quails), and a few bits of bay-leaf. Close the timbale with a layer of paste and cook in a moderately hot oven for one and one-quarter hours. Turn out upon withdrawing from the oven, and serve the dish as it stands. N.B.—(1) The shell of paste merely serves to hold in the quails and their garnish, and ought not to be eaten (2) The same timbale may be prepared with ortolans, except •ifiat these need only forty-five minutes’ cooking.

512 GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY 1603— SUPREMES DE VOLAILLE A L’INDIENNE Saute the supremes in butter, and put them for a few minutes in a curry sauce & l’lndienne, but without letting the latter boil. Dish the supremes in a timbale with the curry sauce. Serve a timbale of rice k l’lndienne, separately. 1604— SUPREMES DE VOLAILLE JARDINIERE Saute the supremes in butter. Dish and surround with small heaps of vegetables, arranged very neatly, as explained in the case of the Jardiniere garnish. Sprinkle the supremes with a few drops of nut-brown butter, just before serving. 1605— SUPREMES DE VOLAILLE JUDIC Cut the supremes into heart shapes; season them, and poach them dry. Dish them in a crown, upon little braised lettuces; and set a slice of truffle and a cock’s kidney upon each heart of supreme. Coat slightly with thickened gravy. 1606— SUPREMES DE VOLAILLE MARECHALE It is the rule that all preparations termed “ k la Mar^chale ” should be treated with chopped truffle; that is to say that the latter takes the place of the customary bread-crumbs. For the sake of economy the a Vanglaise treatment (i.e., egg and bread-crumbs) is more commonly applied; so the reader may choose which of the two he prefers. In any case, saute the supremes in butter; dish them in the form of a crown, with a fine slice of truffle on each, and set in their midst a garnish of asparagus-heads, cohered with butter. N.B.—Formerly, these supremes, like all preparations “ k la Mar^chale,” were gently grilled upon buttered paper. 1607— SUPREMES DE VOLAILLE MARYLAND Proceed exactly as directed under “ Poulet saut6 & la Mary- land ” (No. 1565). 1608— SUPREMES DE VOLAILLE M0NTPEN5IER Roll the supremes in beaten egg and bread-crumbs, and saute them in clarified butter. Dish them in a crown with a slice of truffle upon each, and surround with small heaps of asparagus-heads, cohered with butter. Sprinkle the supremes with a few drops of nut-brown butter.

GAME 587 (3) Accompany the pie by a Salmis sauce, prepared from the pheasant’s carcass and remains. 1850—MOUSSES ET MOUSSELINES DE FAISAN As already stated in various parts of this work, the con- stituents and their quantities are the same for mousses and mousselines, and but for the basic ingredient, which is pheasant in this case, the procedure does not differ from that already described. The base of the sauces served with these mousses and mous- selines is a fumet made from the carcasses and remains. 1851—SOUFFLE DE FAISAN Prepare a very light, mousseline forcemeat of pheasant. Set in a buttered souffle saucepan, and cook in a moderate oven. Send a fine, half-glaze sauce, flavoured with game essence, at the same time. Cold Pheasant 1852—FAISAN A LA BOH^MIENNE Proceed as for “ Faisan k la Boh^mienne ” hot (No. 1831). Cook it in an earthenware terrine, and add thereto, at the same time as the prescribed brandy, enough succulent, savoury jelly to fill up the terrine. Leave to cool for a day or two, and, when about to serve, remove the grease that has settled on the surface, by means of a spoon. Remove the last vestiges of grease by repeated scaldings; carefully wipe the terrine, and serve it incrusted in a block of ice. 1853—CHAUD = FROID DE FAISAN Proceed exactly as for “ Chaud-froid de Volaille ” (No. 1689), and use a brown chaud-froid sauce, flavoured with pheasant fumet. In regard to the decoration, dishing, &c., follow the recipe already referred to. 1854—CHAUD-FROID DE FAISAN A LA BULOZ Poele a pheasant, keeping it underdone; raise its supremes, and cut these into thin collops. With a fumet prepared from the carcass and the poeling- liquor, prepare a brown chaud-froid sauce. Coat the collops with this sauce, and also coat ten cooked and grooved mush- rooms with a white chaud-froid sauce.

223 SOUPS 617—CONSOMME VILLENEUVE Have ready one quart of chicken consomm6. Prepare the following garnish :—Two small blanched lettuces, stuffed with chicken forcemeat combined with braised and chopped salted tongue; two dariole-moulds of ordinary royale, and two pancakes coated with a layer of chicken force- meat, which should be placed in the front of the oven for a few moments with the view of poaching the forcemeat. Put the cut-up lettuces, the pancakes cut into small, narrow lozenges, and the royale cut into pastils, into the soup-tureen; and, when about to serve, pour the boiling consomm^ over the whole. Special Cold Consomme for Suppers Remarks Relative to the Consommes.—I gave the recipes of these consommes in Part I. of this work (No. 6), and shall now, therefore, limit myself to the following remarks, which are of paramount importance :— 1. These consommes must be perfect in limpidness and quality. 2. The flavour which typifies them should be at once decided and yet not too pronounced. 3. When the flavour is imparted by a wine, the latter should be of the best possible quality. Rather than make use of in- ferior wines, the presence of which in the soup would tend to depreciate its quality, completely discard wine flavourings. 4. Supper consommes never contain any garnish. 618—CONSOMME A L’ESSENCE DE CAILLES Use roast quails in the proportion of two for each pint of consomm£; the fillets may be reserved for a cold entree. 619—CONSOMME A L’ESSENCE DE CELER1 It is impossible to state exactly how much celery should be used, the quantity being entirely subject to the more 01 less decided flavour of the vegetables at one’s disposal. Experience alone can guide the operator in this matter. 620—CONSOMME A L'ESSENCE DE MORILLES Allow five oz. of small fresh morels, or three oz.. of dry ones per quart of the consomm£. Pound them and mix them with the clarification.

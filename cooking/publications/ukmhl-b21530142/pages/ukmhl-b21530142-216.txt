Having dished the omelet, open it along the middle, and lay a nice little faggot of asparagus-tops in the interspace. 515— OMELET A LA PROVEN9ALE Rub the bottom of the omelet-pan lightly with a clove of garlic; put two tablespoonfuls of oil into the utensil, and heat it until it smokes.

Cook it quickly, tossing it the while, and add it to the beaten and seasoned eggs. Make the omelet in the usual way.

Surround it with a thread of half- glaze flavoured with truffle essence. 518— OMELET WITH TRUFFLES Add to the omelet one tablespoonful of truffles, cut into dice.

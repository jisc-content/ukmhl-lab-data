CHAPTER XXI DRINKS AND REFRESHMENTS. N.B.—The quantities given below are calculated to be sufficient for fifteen glassfuls. 2934— BAVAROISE Work eight oz. of powdered sugar with eight egg-yolks in a saucepan, until the whole becomes white and reaches the ribbon stage. Then add consecutively : one-fifth pint of capillary syrup, one pint of freshly made, boiling hot tea, and the same amount of boiling milk ; whisking briskly the while, that the drink may be very frothy. Complete at the last moment with one-third pint of the liqueur which is to characterise the Bavaroise, i.e. either Kirsch or Rum. If the Bavaroise be flavoured with vanilla, orange or lemon, let the flavour infuse in the milk for fifteen minutes beforehand. If it be flavoured with chocolate, dissolve six oz. of the latter, and add the milk to it, flavoured with vanilla. If it be coffee-flavoured, set three oz. of freshly-torrified and con- cassed coffee to infuse in the milk or flavour with one pint of freshly- made coffee. Bavaroise is served in special glasses, and it must be frothy. 2935— BISCHOFF Put into a basin one bottleful of Champagne, one Sherry- glassful of “tilleul” infusion, one orange and one lemon, cut into thin slices, and enough syrup at 320 to bring the preparation to 180. Let maceration proceed in the cool for an hour. This done, strain the whole ; freeze it like a Granitd, and finish it with four liqueur- glassfuls of liqueur-brandy. Serve in bumpers. 2936— ICED COFFEE Pour one and a half pints of boiling water, gradually, over ten oz. of freshly-ground coffee, and strain it gently. Put this coffee into a bowl with 20 oz. of loaf-sugar, and let the latter dissolve

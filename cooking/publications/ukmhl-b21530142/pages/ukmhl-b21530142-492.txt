460 GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY 1401— OREILLES A LA ROUENNAISE After having singed and well cleaned the inside of the pig’s ears, cook them in water, salted to the extent of one-third oz. of salt per quart, together with a garnish of vegetables as for pot-au-feu. This done, cut them across in suchwise as to have the end where the flesh is thickest on one side, and the thinnest end on the other side of the strips. Chop up the thick portion ; cut the other into collops, and put the whole into a saucepan with one-quarter pint of half-glaze with Madeira. Cook gently for thirty minutes. This done, add to the minced ears, one and one-half lbs. of sausage meat and a pinch of chopped parsley. Divide up the whole into portions, weighing three oz; wrap each portion in a piece of pig’s caul, insert a collop of ear into the wrapping, and give the latter the shape of ordinary crepinettes. Grill gently, until the cooking is three- parts done; sprinkle with butter and raspings, and complete the cooking of the crepinettes, colouring them in so doing. Dish in a circle, and serve a Madeira sauce at the same time. 1402— OREILLES A LA SAINTE MENEHOULD Cook the ears as explained above, and let them cool. Cut them in two, lengthwise; coat them with mustard; sprinkle them with melted butter and raspings, and grill them gently. Ears are usually served plain, but they may be accompanied by apple sauce. 1403— PIEDS DE PORC TRUFFES Truffled pig’s trotters may be bought already prepared; all that remains to be done, therefore, is to grill them. Sprinkle them with melted butter; grill them very gently, basting them from time to time the while, and serve them with a P^rigueux sauce. 1404— PIEDS DE PORC PANES Sprinkle the pig’s trotters copiously with melted butter, and put them on the grill, which should be very hot. Grill them very gently, turning them with care; and serve them plain, or with a tomato pur6e separately.

CHAPTER XIII SOUPS Soups are divided into two leading classes, viz.: — 1. Clear soups, which include plain and garnished con- sommes. 2. Thick soups, which comprise the Purges, Velours, and Creams. A third class, which is independent of either of the above, inasmuch as it forms part of plain, household cookery, em- braces vegetable soups and Garbures or gratined soups. But in important dinners—by this I mean rich dinners—only the first two classes are recognised. When a menu contains two soups, one must be clear and the other thick. If only one is to be served, it may be either clear or thick, in which case the two kinds are represented alternately at different meals. In Part I. of this work I indicated the general mode of pro- cedure for consommes and thick soups; I explained how the latter might be converted from plain purges into velout^s or creams, or from velout^s into creams; and all that now remains is to reveal the recipes proper to each of those soups. Remarks.—In the course of the recipes for consommes, given hereafter, the use of Royales (Nos. 206 to 213) and of Quenelles, variously prepared (Nos. 193 to 195 and 205), will often be enjoined. For the preparation of these garnishes, therefore, the reader will have to refer to the numbers indicated. The quantities for the clear soups that follow are all calcu- lated to be sufficient for a standaid number of six people, and the quantity of Royales is always given in so many dariole- moulds, which contain about one-eighth pint, or baba-moulds, which hold about one-fifth pint. Of course, it will be understood that the poaching need not necessarily have been effected in these moulds, for very small “Charlotte” moulds would do quite as well. But I had re- course to the particular utensils mentioned above, in order that

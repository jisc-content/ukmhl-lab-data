CHAPTER XV RELEVES AND ENTREES The difference between Relev^s and Entries needs only to be examined very superficially in order for it to be seen how entirely the classification hangs on the question of bulk. Indeed, with very few exceptions, the same alimentary pro- ducts—butcher’s meat, fish, poultry, and game—may be used with perfect propriety in the preparation of either Relev&s or Entries. And if the mode of preparation and the nature of the garnishing ingredients are sometimes dissimilar, it is owing to that difference in bulk referred to above, on account of which the Relev^s, being more voluminous, are usually braised, fioeled, poached, or roasted; while the Entries, consisting of smaller pieces, are chiefly sauted, poached, or grilled. In the menus of old-fashioned dinners k la Fran^aise, the line of demarcation between Relev^s and Entries was far more clearly defined, the latter being generally twice, if not thrice, as numerous as the former. The first service of a dinner for twenty people, for instance, comprised eight or twelve Entries and four soups, all of which were set on the dining-table before the admission of the diners. As soon as the soups were served, the Relev^s, to the number of four, two of which consisted of fish, took the place of the soups on the table; they relieved the soups; hence their name, which now, of course, is quite meaningless. The Russian method of serving greatly simplified the prac- tice just described. Nowadays a dinner rarely consists of more than two soups, two Relev^s (one of which is fish), and two or three Entries for the first service. Very often the fish Relev4, instead of being a large piece of fish, only consists of fillets of sole, of chicken-turbots, &c., or timbales, which are real entries; while the Relev^s (consisting of large pieces of butcher’s meat or game), instead of being served as common sense would dictate, i.e., after the fish Relev6, when the diner’s appetite is still keen, are placed, according to English custom, after the Entries.

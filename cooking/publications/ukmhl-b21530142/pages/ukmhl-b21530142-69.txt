43 THE SMALL COMPOUND SAUCES If it is to garnish fish, substitute for the Allemande Sauce some fish velouffl thickened with egg-yolks and the essences of mushroom and truffle as above. Complete with some fish essence. 104—SOUBISE SAUCE Stew in butter two lbs. of finely-minced onions, scalded for three minutes and well dried. This stewing of the onions in butter increases their flavour. Now add one-half pint of thick- ened Bechamel; season with salt and a teaspoonful of powdered sugar. Cook gently for half an hour, rub through a tammv, and complete the sauce with some tablespoonfuls of cream and two oz. of butter. 105—SOUBISE SAUCE WITH RICE The same quantity as above of minced onions, scalded and well drained. Garnish the bottom and the sides of a tall, medium stewpan with some thin rashers of fat bacon. Insert the onions, together with one-quarter lb. of Carolina rice, one pint of white consomm^, a large pinch of powdered sugar, and the necessary salt. Cook gently in the front of the oven for three-quarters of an hour. Then pound the onions and rice in a mortar, rub the resulting pur^e through a tammy, and finish with cream and butter as in the preceding case. N.B.—This sauce, being more consistent than the former, is used as a garnish just as often as a sauce. 106—SOUBISE SAUCE TOMATEE Prepare a soubise in accordance with the first of the two above formulae, and add to it one-third of its volume of very red tomato pur£e. Remarks. 1. The Soubise is rather a cullis than a sauce; i.e., its con- sistence must be greater than that of a sauce. 2. The admixture of Bechamel in Soubise is preferable to that of rice, seeing that it makes it smoother. If, in certain cases, rice is used as a cohering element, in order to give the Soubise more stiffness. 3. In accordance with the uses to which it may be put, the Soubise Tomatde may be finally seasoned either with curry or paprika.

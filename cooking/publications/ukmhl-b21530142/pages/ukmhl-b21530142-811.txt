773 ENTREMETS Cherries (Cerises). 2671—CERISES A LA DUBARRY Line a flawn-ring with good, short paste; set it on a small round baking-sheet ; prick the paste on the bottom to prevent its blistering while baking, sprinkle with powdered sugar, and garnish with fine, stoned cherries, pressed snugly one against the other. Bake the flawn in the usual way and let it cool. When it is quite cold cover the cherries with Chantilly cream, combined either with ordinary pr-alin or with crushed macaroons. Smooth the surface of the cream, as also the sides of the flawn; cover it with macaroon powder, and then decorate by means of the piping-bag with white and pink Chantilly cream. 2672—CERISES AU CLARET Select some fine cherries ; cut off the ends of their stalks, and set them in a silver timbale. Pour sufficient sweetened Bordeaux wine (flavoured with a mite of cinnamon) over them, to just cover them. Close the timbale, and keep it on the side of the fire for ten minutes, that the cherries may poach. Let them cool in the syrup ; drain the latter away; reduce it by a third, and add, in order to thicken it slightly, one table- spoonful of red-currant jelly per six tablespoonfuls of reduced syrup. Serve the cherries quite cold, and some lady’s-finger biscuits separately. Strawberries (Fraises). 2673—FRAISES A LA CREOLE Set some fine strawberries and an equal amount of pine-apple, cut into dice, to macerate in powdered sugar and Kirsch. Arrange a close crown of pine-apple slices, also macerated in Kirsch, upon a tazza. In the middle of the crown build a pyramid of the strawberries and pine-apple, and sprinkle with a Kirsch- flavoured syrup. 2674—FRAISES FEMINA Select some fine strawberries ; sprinkle them with sugar and Grand-Marnier Curagao, and leave them to macerate on ice for an hour. When about to serve, spread on the bottom of a bowl 01 timbale a layer of orange-ice (which should be combined with the macerating liqueur) and set the strawberries thereon.

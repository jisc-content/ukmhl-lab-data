RELEVES AND ENTREES 455 stituents, the undermentioned methods of preparation, explained in the various preceding series, may be applied to them ; viz.:— Attereaux, Brochettes, Croustades, Pate chaud, Vol au vent, &c. 1380—SAUTE D’AGNEAU PRINTANIER Prepare the following garnish :—Twenty new carrots, cut to the shape of large olives, cooked in consomm£ and glazed; twenty pieces of turnip, similarly treated; fifteen small, new onions, cooked in butter; twenty very small new potatoes, cooked in butter (or d I’anglaise if desired); three tablespoonfuls of peas; the same quantity of French beans cut into lozenge- form, and an equal quantity of small flageolet beans. The three last vegetables should be cooked a Vanglaise, and kept rather firm. Cut two lbs. of shoulder and breast of lamb into pieces weighing two oz., and completely cook them in butter without any moistening. This done, transfer them to a dish. Swill the saucepan with three tablespoonfuls of water; add five tablespoonfuls of pale meat glaze; heat without boiling, and finish with two and one- half oz. of butter. Put the pieces of lamb and the vegetables into this sauce, and gently rock the saucepan, that all the ingredients may par- take of the sauce. Serve in a hot timbale. 1381—PILAW D’AGNEAU Proceed exactly as explained under “ Pilaw de Mouton ” (No. 1354), only bear in mind that the time allowed for cooking should be proportionately shortened in view of the greater ten. derness of lamb’s meat. 1382—CURRIE D’AGNEAU Proceed as for “Currie de Mouton,” after duly allowing, as above, for the greater tenderness of the meat.

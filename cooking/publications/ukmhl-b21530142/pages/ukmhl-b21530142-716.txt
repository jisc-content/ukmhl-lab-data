CHAPTER XIX SAVOURIES 2298— REMARKS UPON SAVOURIES I have already expressed my opinion in regard to Savouries. I consider their use opposed to gastronomical principles, and that they have no raison d’etre on a good menu. But, not wishing to seem didactic, I shall give, hereafter, a few savoury recipes, selected from among those which are gastronomically the best, and which custom has sanctified. I resolved to make these recipes appear after the Vegetables and before the Ices, because I deem that Dessert alone is ad- missible after the Entremets and Ices. There is much in common between Hors-d’oeuvres and Savouries. Many of the former, the recipes for which I have given, may appear as Savouries, once their seasoning has been intensified. Among the latter class may be quoted the various Tartlets (No. 387, &c.); the Barquettes (No. 314); Frivolities (No. 350); Eclairs k la Karoly (No. 344); Allumettes aux Anchois (No. 300); City Toasts (No. 320), &c. 2299— ALLUMETTES Prepare a ribbon of puff-paste three inches wide by one- fifth inch thick, leaving the length to come as it will. Spread on it some very reduced B6chamel sauce, combined with two tablespoonfuls of grated Gruy£re cheese per one-half pint, and season with cayenne. Sprinkle the surface with grated Parmesan; press the latter into the sauce by means of the flat of a knife; cut into rectangles one inch wide; set these on a slightly-moistened tray, and bake them in a moderate oven for twelve minutes. 2300— BEIGNETS SOUFFLES WITH CHEESE Prepare some ordinary “ pate h choux ” without sugar (No. 2375), and combine it, per lb., with five oz. of a Brunoise of Gruy£re. Divide up this paste into portions the size of hazel-nut, and fry them in fat like other Beignets souffles.

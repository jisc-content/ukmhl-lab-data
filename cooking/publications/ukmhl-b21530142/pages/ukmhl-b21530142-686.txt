648 GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY 2142— TUBEROUS FENNEL (Fenouil Tubereux) This vegetable is not very well known in England, where it is sold only by the leading merchants of early-season vege- tables. It is prepared like the cardoons and the marrows. 2143— BROAD BEANS (Feves) Broad beans should be shelled just before being cooked, and it is quite the rule to peel them. Boil them in salted water containing a bunch of savory, the size of which should be in proportion to the quantity of broad beans. When they are cooked and drained, add the leaves of savory (chopped) to them. 2144— FEVES AU BEURRE Having well-drained and peeled the broad beans, toss them over a fierce fire to dry them, and then finish them, away from the fire, with three oz. of butter per lb. of beans. 2145— FEVES A LA CREME After having dried and peeled the broad beans, cohere them (per lb.) with three tablespoonfuls of thick, fresh cream. 2146— PUREE DE FEVES Proceed exactly as for pur£e of peas. This pur^e con- stitutes a very delicate garnish, which is particularly well suited to ham. 2147— GOMBOS This vegetable—so common in America and the East—is only very rarely used in England, where, however, it is now beginning to be better known. There are two kinds of Gombos : the long and the round kind. The latter is also called Bamia or Bamies. Both kinds are prepared after the same recipes. 2148— GOMBOS A LA CREME After having trimmed them, parboil them in salted water and drain them. Then cook them in butter, and, just before serving them, cohere them with a cream sauce. 2149— GOMBOS POUR GARNITURES Parboil the gombos until they are two-thirds cooked. Drain them well, and complete their cooking in the braising-liquor of the piece they are to accompany. If they are to garnish a poulet saute, complete their cooking in some thin veal gravy. 2150— HOP SPROUTS (Jets de Houblon) The eatable part is separated from the fibrous by breaking off the ends of the sprouts, as in the case of asparagus or sprew.

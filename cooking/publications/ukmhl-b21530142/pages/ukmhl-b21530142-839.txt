801 ICES Iced Biscuits. 2818— PREPARATION FOR ICED BISCUITS Whisk in a copper basin, in a bain-marie, twelve cgg-yolks and one lb. of powdered sugar, until the paste gets very firm and reaches the ribbon-s\.dLgQ. Take the basin off the fire, and whisk until the whole is quite cold. Then, add eight oz. of Italian meringue and one pint of whisked cream. 2819— THE MOULDING OF ICED BISCUITS These biscuits are moulded in rectangular brick-shaped cases, fitted with lids, top and bottom. Generally, the preparation moulded in the covers is of a different flavour and colour from the one filling the middle of the mould. For example, one of the covers may be garnished with straw- berry, and the other with violet preparation, while the central portion may hold a vanilla-flavoured preparation. After having frozen them for three hours, in a pail filled with freezing ice, and turned them out, these bricks are cut up vertically into rectangles, on the cut sides of which the differently coloured layers are distinctly marked. Place these rectangles in special paper cases ; decorate them on top, if the directions admit of it, and place them in a refrigerator until about to serve. Nearly all Bombe preparations may become the base of biscuits, which are then named after them ; eg.: from Bombe Odessa, Odessa Iced Biscuits may be prepared.

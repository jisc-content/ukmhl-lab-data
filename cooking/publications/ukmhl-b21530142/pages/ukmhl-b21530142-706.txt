GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY 668 2258— RIZOTTO A LA PIEMONTAISE Fry a medium-sized onion in butter, and add to it one-half lb. of Piedmont rice. Put the rice on the side of the stove; add some saffron to it and stir it until it is well saturated with butter. Moisten the rice with about one quart of consomm^ per lb. The consomm£ should be added to the rice in seven or eight instalments, and as fast as it becomes absorbed, a fresh supply should be forthcoming. When adding the liquor, stir the rice with a wooden spoon. Cook the rice under cover, and, to the resulting preparation, which should thus be creamy, add a few pieces of fresh butter and some grated Parmesan. The dish may be finished, either with shavings of white truffles or ham cut into dice. 2259— SALSIFY or OYSTER PLANT (Salsifis) There are two kinds of salsify :—the white and the black, which is also called “ viper’s grass.” After having carefully scraped and washed it, cook it in a blanc. The same preparations suit the two kinds. 2260— FRIED SALSIFY After having thoroughly drained it, cut it into three and one-half lengths, and put these on a dish. Season with salt and pepper; add lemon juice, a few drops of oil, some chopped parsley, and leave to marinade for from twenty-five to thirty minutes, taking care to toss the salsify from time to time. This done, drain the lengths of salsify, dip them in some thin batter; plunge them in very hot fat, and drain them when the batter is quite dry. Dish them on a napkin with fried parsley. N.B.—It is not absolutely necessary to marinade salsify; the question is one of taste. 2261— SALSIFIS SAUTE Cut it into two-inch lengths; dry them very well, and toss these in butter in an omelet-pan, until they are of a nice golden colour. Season, and dish in a timbale with fried parsley. 2262— SALSIFIS A LA CREME Proceed as directed in the case of other vegetables prepared in this way.

636 GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY 2081— MORILLES A LA CREME Proceed as for Cepes and Mushrooms with Cream. 2082— MORILLES FARCIES Select some large morels, and wash them well. Suppress their stems; chop them up, and prepare them like a Duxelles (No. 223). Add to this Duxelles half of its bulk of very smooth sausage- meat. Open the morels on one side; fill them with the prepared forcemeat, and set them on a buttered dish, opened side nether- most. Sprinkle with fine raspings, and use plenty of melted butter; cook for twenty minutes in a moderate oven, and serve the dish as it stands. 2083— MORILLES A LA POULETTE Cook them as described under No. 2080, and add them to a Poulette sauce (No. 101), together with their cooking-liquor reduced. Dish in a timbale, and sprinkle with a pinch of chopped parsley. 2084— MORILLES SAUTEES After having thoroughly washed the morels, dry them well in a towel, and halve or quarter them according to their size. Season them with salt and pepper, and saute them with butter in an omelet-pan, over a sufficiently fierce fire, to avoid the exudation of their vegetable moisture. Dish them in a timbale; squeeze a few drops of lemon juice over them, and sprinkle them with chopped parsley. 2085— TOURTE DE MORILLES Cook the morels as explained under No. 2080, and drain them well. Reduce their cooking-liquor by a quarter, and add to it two tablespoonfuls of very thick cream and one oz. of butter per lb. of morels. Heat this sauce without boiling it, toss the morels in it, and set them in a tourte crust, or merely in the centre of a crown of puff-paste, lying on a dish. Morels prepared in this way may also be served in a Vol-au- vent crust (No. 2390). 2086— MOUSSERONS, ORONGES, GIROLES These varieties of esculent fungi are not much liked in England.

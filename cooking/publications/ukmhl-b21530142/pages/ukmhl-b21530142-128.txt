GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY 102 The Completing of VeloutL—Having passed the soup through tammy, bring it to its proper degree of consistence with the necessary quantity of consomm£, boil while stirring, and place in a bain-marie. At the last moment finish the soup with the leason and two oz. of butter per quart of liquid. Garnish for Veloute.—In the case of vegetables : Chiffonade, fine printaniers, or brunoise. For fowl and game : The fillets of one or the other, poached and cut into small dice or in julienne-fashion; little quenelles made with the raw fillets, or either fowl or game royales. For fish : Small dice or fine julienne of fish fillets poached in butter. For shell-fish : Small dice of cooked shell-fish meat put aside for the purpose. Remarks.—In certain circumstances these garnishes are in- creased by means of three tablespoonfuls of poached rice per quart of the soup. 343—THE CREAMS Practically speaking, the preparation of the creams is the same as that of the velout^s, but for the following exceptions : — 1. In all circumstances, i.e., whatever be the nature of the soup, velout£ is substituted for clear Bechamel. 2. The correct consistence of the soup is got by means of milk instead of consomm£. 3. Creams do not require egg-yolk leasons. 4. They are not buttered, but they are finished with one-fifth or two-fifths pint of fresh cream per quart. Creams allow of the same garnishes as the velout^s. 244— SPECIAL SOUPS AND THICKENED CONSOMMES These are of different kinds, though their preparation remains the same, and they do not lend themselves to the re- quirements of velout^s or creams. I should quote as types of this class the Ambassador, h l’Am^ricaine, Darblay, Faubonne, &c. The same holds good with thickened consommes, such as “ Germiny,” “ Coquelin,” &c. 245— VEGETABLE SOUPS These soups, of which the “ Paysanne ” is the radical type, do not demand very great precision in the apportionment of

CHAPTER XI hors-d’ceuvres General Remarks The preparations described hereafter all belong to the order of cold hors-d’oeuvres. I did not deem it necessary to touch upon the hot kind, for, apart from the fact that these are very seldom served in England, at least under the head of hors- d’oeuvres, they are mostly to be found either among the hot Entries or the Savouries proper.

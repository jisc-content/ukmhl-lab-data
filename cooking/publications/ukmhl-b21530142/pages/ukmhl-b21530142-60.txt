Serve it with grilled, butcher’s meat and poultry. 63— BEARNAISE SAUCE WITH MEAT GLAZE, OTHERWISE VALOIS SAUCE OR FOYOT SAUCE Prepare a B^arnaise sauce as explained in No. 62. Complete it with three tablespoonfuls of dissolved pale meat glaze, which may be added in small quantities at a time. Serve it with butcher’s meat. 64— B^ARNAISE TOMATEE SAUCE OR CHORON SAUCE Proceed in exactly the same way as for B^arnaise No. 62.

Be careful that the sauce does not boil after it has been thickened. 67— BONNEFOY SAUCE, OR WHITE BORDELAISE SAUCE Put in a stewpan two oz. of minced shallots and one-half pint of Graves, Sauterne, or any other excellent white Bor-

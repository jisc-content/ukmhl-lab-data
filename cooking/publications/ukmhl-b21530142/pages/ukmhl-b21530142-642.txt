6o6 GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY Cut into squares or lozenges, and set these round the Roast or serve them separately. 1944— SAGE AND 0NI0N5 STUFFING (For Turkeys, Ducks and Geese) Bake four large onions in the oven with their skins on. This done, peel them and finely chop them; fry them in butter with a pinch of dry green chopped sage. Add bread-crumbs, soaked in milk and pressed, equal in weight to the onions, and half the weight of chopped veal fat. 1945— VEAL STUFFING (For Veal and Pork) This stuffing is made from equal quantities of chopped suet, sifted bread-crumbs, and chopped parsley. Season with salt and pepper as for an ordinary forcemeat, and be liberal with the nutmeg. Cohere this forcemeat with three small eggs per two lbs. of the above preparation. 1946— ROASTS OF BUTCHER’S MEAT I must remind the reader of this principle, viz.: that how- ever natural it may seem in a dinner to serve a roasted joint as a Remove, a piece of butcher’s meat must never stand as a Roast. Roasts really only comprise Fowl and Feathered Game, pro- vided the menu only announces one roast. If twro are an- nounced, the second generally consists of some kind of crus- tacean, such as a Lobster, a Spiny Lobster or Crayfish, generally served in the form of a Mousse; or of a preparation of foie gras, i.e. : either a Pate, a Terrine, a Mousse or a Parfait; sometimes, too, by a very good ham or a derivative preparation thereof. Beef Roasts 1947— ROAST RIBS OF BEEF Clear the joint of the vertebrae and the yellow ligaments. Roast before a moderately fierce fire, and place the joint if pos- sible in an uncovered braising-pan, the sides of which may pro- tect the meat during the cooking process. 1948— ROAST UPPER-FILLET Break the projecting bones of the vertebrae, and sever the yellow ligament at various points. For this joint the heat should be fiercer than in the previous case, the limit of time being less.

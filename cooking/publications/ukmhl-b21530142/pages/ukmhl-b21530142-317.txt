Coat the bottom of the dish intended for the sole with a pur£e of mushrooms, place the drained sole on this pur£e, lay six fine slices of truffle along the fish, coat with Mornay sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and glaze quickly. 841—SOLE AUX HUITRES Open and poach six oysters. Poach the sole in the liquor of the oysters, drain it, dish it, and surround it with the oysters (cleared of their beards). Coat with a white wine sauce combined with the reduced cooking-liquor of the sole, and glaze quickly. 842—SOLE A LA MEUNIERE Proceed for this dish as directed under “ Fish & la Meunifere ” (No. 778). 843—SOLE MEUNIERE AUX CONCOMBRES, otherwise DORIA Prepare a sole k la Meuni&re. Garnish it at both ends with little heaps of cucumber, turned and cooked in butter with a little salt and a pinch of sugar. 844—SOLE MEUNIERE AUX AUBERGINES Prepare a sole k la Meuni&re in the usual way. Surround it with a fine border of egg-plant rundles one-third inch thick, seasoned, dredged, and fried in clarified butter, just in time to be arranged round the sole when it is ready. The question of time is important, for if the fried rundles be allowed to wait at all they very quickly lose their crispness. 845—SOLE MEUNIERE AUX CEPES Prepare the sole k la Meuni&re in the usual way and sur- round it with a border of sliced cepes frizzled in butter just be- fore dishing up. 846—SOLE MEUNIERE AUX MORILLES Surround the sole with very fresh morels cooked in salted water and then tossed in butter just before dishing up.

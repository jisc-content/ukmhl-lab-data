604 GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY 1934— SYLPHIDES D’ORTOLANS Butter some very small porcelain or silver cassolettes, and garnish them half-full with mousseline forcemeat of ortolans prepared with truffle essence. Set these cassolettes in the front of the oven, that the force- meat may poach. Cook in butter, for three minutes only, as many ortolans as there are garnished cassolettes, and proceed so as to have them just ready when the forcemeat is poached. Place an ortolan in each cassolette, and sprinkle them with nut-brown butter, combined with a little pale melted glaze and pineapple juice. 1935— BECS-FIGUES ET BEGUINETTES (Fig Peckers) These birds are not met with in English markets; it is therefore useless to give the recipes concerning them. I will only say that they may be prepared like the larks. ,936—CANARDS SAUVAGES (Wild Duck) 1937— SARCELLES (Teal) 1938— PI LETS (Pintails and Widgeons) Birds of this class are mostly served roasted. They may, however, be used in preparing excellent Salmis, which may be made after “ Salmis de Faisan ” (No. 1847) or after “ Salmis & la Rouennaise ” (No. 1763). They may also be prepared after all the recipes of “ Caneton h la Rouennaise.” 1939— PLUVIERS DOR^S (Golden Plover) 1940— VANNEAUX (Lapwings) 1941— CHEVALIERS DIVERS (Various Sandpipers) These various birds are generally served roasted. They may also be served “ en Salmis,” but in that case the skin must be discarded in the preparation of the cullis. They only appear on very ordinary menus, and could not be served at an important dinner.

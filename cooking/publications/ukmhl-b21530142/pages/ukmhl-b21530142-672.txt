GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY 634 time as the former. When about to serve, finish with a little pale melted meat glaze, and dish in a timbale. Mushrooms (Champignons) Cookery includes under this head only the white Parisian mushroom and the meadow mushroom, which is the kind so commonly used in England. The other kinds are always identified by special and proper terms. 2072— CHAMPIGNONS A LA CR&ME Proceed as described under No. 2069. 2073— CHAMPIGNONS SAUTES After having washed the mushrooms, dried, and ciseled them, and seasoned them with salt and pepper, toss them with butter in a frying-pan over a fierce fire. Sprinkle them with chopped parsley at the last moment, and dish them in a timbale. 2074— CHAMPIGNONS GRILLES Take some large Parisian or meadow mushrooms. Care- fully peel them ; season them; smear them with oil, by means of a brush, and grill them gently. Set them on a round dish, and garnish their midst with well-softened, Maitre-d’Hotel butter. 2075— CHAMPIGNONS FARCIS Select some fine, medium-sized mushrooms; suppress their stalks; wash them, and dry them well. Set them on a dish; season them; sprinkle them with a few drops of oil; put them in the oven for five minutes, and garnish their midst with Duxelles (No. 224) shaped like a dome, and thickened or not with bread-crumbs. Sprinkle the surface with fine raspings and a few drops of oil or melted butter, and set the gratin to form in a somewhat fierce oven. 2076— FLAN GRILLE AUX CHAMPIGNONS Line a buttered flawn-mould with good lining paste (No. 2358). Garnish it with very fresh and barely opened English mush- rooms, tossed in butter with a little chopped onion, cohered with cream, and cooled. Moisten the edges of the flawn-mould, and deck it with criss-cross strips of short paste, as for a latticed apple-flawn. Gild the lattice work; bake the flawn in a very hot oven, and serve it the moment it is withdrawn.

796 GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY Turn it out upon a regular disc, consisting of a thick layer of white spun sugar, lying on a dish. This spun sugar throws the ice into relief, and emits rays which dart out from between the points of the star. 2784— GLACE FLEURETTE Take a square mould. Garnish it with strawberry and pine- apple ice, laid in very regular, superposed layers. After turning it out decorate with lemon ice. 2785— GLACE FRANCILLON Take a square mould; clothe it with coffee ice, and fill it with liqueur-brandy ice. 2786— FROMAGE GLACE These ices are made in fluted moulds, and generally with two differently flavoured and coloured ices, set vertically in the mould. 2787— GLACE DES GOURMETS Take a “ bombe ” mould. Clothe it with pralined, vanilla-ice cream. Fill it with alternate layers of chestnut ice flavoured with rum, and vanilla-flavoured Chantilly cream. When the ice is turned out, roll it in pralined splintered almonds. 278S—MOULDED ICES These ices are made in large or small moulds. The large ices are moulded in tin moulds, fitted with hinged covers, and ornamented with some design. The small ones, which are generally served at evening parties, or are used to garnish larger ices, are made in similar moulds, shaped like flowers, fruit, birds, leaf-sprays, etc. Any ice preparation may be used for these ices ; but, as a rule, the preparation should have something in keeping with the design of the mould used. Small moulded ices may be kept packed until they are served. They may also be turned out in advance and kept in the refrigerator. 2789— GLACE DES ILES Take a Madeleine-mould; clothe it with vanilla ice-cream, and fill it with pine-apple ice. 2790— MADELEINE GLACEE Take a Madeleine-mould. Fill it with vanilla ice-cream, combined with half its bulk of Chantilly cream and candied fruit macerated in Kirsch.

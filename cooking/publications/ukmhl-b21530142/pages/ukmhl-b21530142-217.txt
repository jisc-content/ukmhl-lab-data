EGGS 191 519—HOT LAPWINGS* AND PLOVERS’ EGGS Note.—In the chapter on hors-d’oeuvres, where recipes were given which deal with lapwings’ eggs, I made a few remarks relative to their freshness, and indicated the procedure for boil- ing them soft and hard. 520—SCRAMBLED LAPWINGS’ EGGS Proceed as for ordinary scrambled eggs, all the recipes given for the latter being perfectly applicable to lapwings’ eggs. They require, however, very great care in their preparation, and it should be borne in mind that one ordinary hen’s egg is equal to about three lapwings’ eggs. 521—LAPWINGS’ EGGS A LA DANOISE Poach the eggs as directed in the recipe dealing with the process, and dish them up in tartlet-crusts garnished with a pur£e of smoked salmon. 522—OMELET OF LAPWINGS’ EGGS Proceed as for other omelets, but one ordinary hen’s egg is generally added to every six lapwings’ eggs in order to give more body to the preparation. All the omelet recipes already given may be applied to lapwings’ eggs. 523—LAPWINGS’ EGGS A LA ROYALE Garnish'as many small tartlet moulds as there are eggs with chicken-forcemeat. Poach, turn out the moulds, and hollow out the centres of the tartlets in such wise as to be able to set an egg upright in each. Place a soft- or hard-boiled egg on each forcemeat tartlet, coat the eggs with a light pur£e of mushrooms, besprinkle with chopped truffles, and arrange in a circle on a dish. 524—LAPWINGS’ EGGS AU TROUBADOUR Select as many large morels as there are eggs. Remove the stalks, and widen the openings of the morels; season them, and stew them in butter. Boil the lapwings’ eggs soft. Garnish each stewed morel with an egg; set them on little tartlet-crusts garnished with a light, foie-gras pur^e, and arrange them in a circle on a dish.

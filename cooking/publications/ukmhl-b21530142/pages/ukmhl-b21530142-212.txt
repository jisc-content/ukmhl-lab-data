186 GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY 492—THE PREPARATION OF OMELETS Heat the butter in the omelet-pan, until it exhales the char- acteristic nutty smell. This will not only lend an exquisite taste to the omelet, but the degree of heat reached in order to produce the aroma will be found to ensure the perfect setting of the eggs. Pour in the beaten and seasoned eggs, and stir briskly with a fork, in order to heat the whole mass evenly. If the omelet is to be garnished inside, this ought to be done at the present stage, and then the omelet should be speedily rolled up and transferred to a dish, to be finished in accordance with the nature of its designation. When the omelet is on the dish, a piece of butter may be quickly drawn across its surface, to make it glossy. 493—AGNES SOREL OMELET Stuff the omelet with one tablespoonful of mushrooms, minced and sauted in butter.

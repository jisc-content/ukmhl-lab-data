561 POULTRY With some reserved forcemeat, combined with an equal weight of foie-gras pur^e, garnish some tartlet crusts, and poach them at the same time as the souffle. Dish the piece; surround it with the tartlets; set a collop of supreme on each of the latter, and serve a Rouennaise sauce separately. Canetons Froids 1765—CAN ETON A LA CUILLER Braise the duckling with Madeira, and cook it well. Put into a terrine just large enough to hold it; cover with the braising-liquor, strained through a napkin, and combined with enough aspic jelly to completely coat the duckling. Leave to cool. When about to serve, clear the surface of grease, first by means of a spoon, then with boiling water, and dish on a napkin. 1766—CANETON GLAC6 AUX MANDARINES Poele the duckling, and let it cool in its liquor. When it is quite cold, set it on its back; glaze it with aspic jelly, and place it on a low rice or carved-bread cushion lying on a long dish. Surround it with emptied tangerines, filled with cold mousse made from ducklings’ livers and foie gras. Alternate the tan- gerines with small timbales of aspic, combined with the poeling- liquor and the juice squeezed from the sections of the tangerines. 1767—CANETON GLACS AUX CERISES Roast the duckling, and keep it underdone. When it is quite cold, remove the breast, and remove the bones in such wise as to form a case with the carcass. Cut each fillet into eight thin slices; coat them with a brown chaud- froid sauce, and decorate with truffles. Fill the carcass with a mousse made from the remains of the meat, the duckling’s liver, and some foie gras, and shape it so as to imitate the con- vex breast of the bird. Glaze with aspic, and set in the refrigerator, that the mousse may harden. When the latter is firm, lay the chaud-froid- coated collops upon it, and set the piece in a deep, square dish. Surround with cold, stoned, morello cherries, poached in Bordeaux wine, and cover these with an aspic jelly flavoured with duckling essence. o o

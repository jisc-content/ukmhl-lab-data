CHAPTER IX Garnishing Preparations for Releves and Entries. 219— POTATO CROQUETTES Cook quickly in salted water two lb. of peeled and quartered potatoes. As soon as they seem soft to the finger, drain them, place them in the front of the oven for a few minutes in order to dry them, and then tilt them into a sieve lying on a cloth, and press them through the former without rubbing. Place the pur£e in a saut^pan; season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg; add one oz. of butter, and dry; i.e., stir over a brisk fire until the pur£e becomes a consistent paste. Take off the fire, complete with the yolks of three eggs, well mixed with the rest, and turn the paste out on to a buttered dish, taking care to spread it in a rather thin layer, so as to precipitate its cooling. Butter the surface to prevent the pre- paration’s drying. To make croquettes, equal portions of this paste, i.e., por- tions weighing about one and one-half oz. of it, are rolled on a flour-dusted board into the shape of a cork, a ball, or a quoit. These are now dipped into an Anglaise (No. 174) and rolled in bread-crumbs or raspings, the latter being well patted on to the surface of the croquettes, lest they should fall into the frying fat. Let the patting also avail for finishing off the selected shape of the objects. These are then plunged into hot fat, where they should remain until they have acquired a fine, golden colour. 220— DAUPHINE POTATOES Prepare as above the required quantity of paste, and add thereto per lb. six oz. of pate k choux without sugar (No. 2374). Mix the two constituents thoroughly. Dauphine potatoes are moulded in the shape of small cylinders, and they are treated a l’Anglaise, like the croquettes.

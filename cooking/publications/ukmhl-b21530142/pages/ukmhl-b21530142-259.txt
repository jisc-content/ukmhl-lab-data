SOUPS 231 Treated thus, the pur£e will be of a fainter shade than the preceding one, but its flavour will be more delicate. Garnish, in both cases, with one and one-half tablespoonfuls of very green, fine peas, and some chervil pluches. This soup may also be prepared as a velout£ or a cream. 649—PUREE DE POIS FRAIS A LA MENTHE Make the pur£e according to one of the above-mentioned methods, and add to the peas, while cooking, a faggot consist- ing of three little sprigs of fresh mint. Finish with con- somme, and add butter in the usual way. Garnish with nice peas, as above, and some very tender mint-leaves, chopped, instead of the chervil pluches. Remarks Relative to those Soups which have a Puree of Peas for Base.—A large number of soups may be made from purges of fresh peas; among others I may mention the follow- ing, with brief directions as to their constituents and garnish, viz.: — 650—POTAGE AMBASSADEURS Pur£e of fresh peas, quite ready for soup; finish with a small tablespoonful of sorrel and lettuce chiffonade, and two table- spoonfuls of poached rice per quart of pur6e. 651—POTAGE CAMELIA Prepare this after the recipe of potage Lamballe; finish with one tablespoonful of a julienne of the white of a leek and one tablespoonful of white chicken meat, cut julienne-fashion, per quart of the soup. 653—POTAGE FONTANGES Pur£e of fresh peas ready for soup; add two tablespoonfuls of a chiffonade of sorrel and a pinch of chervil pluches per quart of the pur£e, and two tablespoonfuls of poached rice. 653—POTAGE LAMBALLE Half of this consists of a finished pur^e of peas, and the other half of tapioca poached in consomm^ as for the ordinary “ potage au tapioca.” 654—POTAGE LONGCHAMPS This is the “ potage Fontange,” kept somewhat clear, and with a garnish composed of one and one-half oz. of vermicelli, poached in consomm£, and a pinch of chervil pluches per quart of the soup.

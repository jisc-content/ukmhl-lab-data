CHAPTER V Savoury Jellies or Aspics Jellies are to cold cookery what consommes and stock are to hot. If anything, the former are perhaps more important, for a cold entree—however perfect it may be in itself—is nothing without its accompanying jelly. In the recipes which I give hereafter I have made a point of showing how melting jellies may be obtained, i.e., served in a sauce-boat simultaneously with the cold comestible, or actually poured over it when the latter lies in a deep dish—a common custom nowadays. This method of serving cold entries, which I inaugurated at the Savoy Hotel with the “ Supreme de Volaille Jeannette,” is the only one which allows of serving a jelly in a state of absolute perfection. Nevertheless, if a more solid jelly were required, either for the decking of cold dishes or for a moulded entrde, there need only be added to the following formulas a few gelatine leaves—more or less—according to the required firmness of the jelly. But it should not be forgotten that the greater the viscosity of the jelly the less value will the same possess. The various uses of jellies are dealt with in Part II. of this work, where the formulae of their divers accompanying dishes will also appear. 158—ORDINARY ASPICS Stock for Ordinary Aspic.—Quantities for making Four Quarts. 4 lbs. of strung knuckle of veal. 3 calf’s feet, boned and blanched. 3 lbs. of strung knuckle of beef.

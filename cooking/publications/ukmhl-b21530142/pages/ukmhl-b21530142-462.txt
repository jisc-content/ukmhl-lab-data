GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY 430 1294— CERVELLE A LA POULETTE Prepare half a pint of poulette sauce (No. 101), combined with three oz. of small, cooked, and very white mushrooms. Add the brains, cut into slices; toss them gently in the sauce, taking care lest they break; dish them in a timbale, and sprinkle with a pinch of chopped parsley. 1295— CERVELLE A LA VILLEROY Cut the raw brains into slices; season them, and poach them in butter. Dip the slices into an almost cold Villeroy sauce, in suchwise as to cover them with a thick coating of it. Leave to cool, and treat them a Vanglaise. Set to cook for a few minutes before serving, and dish on a napkin with fried parsley. Serve a light P^rigueux sauce separately. 1296— VOL AU VENT DE CERVELLE Prepare a vol-au-vent crust, as explained under No. 2390. Slice the brains, and put the slices into half-a-pint of Allemande sauce, with twelve quenelles of ordinary forcemeat, poached just before dishing up; four oz. of small, cooked mushrooms, and one oz. of truffle slices, five or six of which should be reserved. Pour the garnish into the vol au vent; set upon the latter the reserved slices of truffle, and dish on a folded napkin. 1297— AMOURETTES A LA TOSCA Poach one lb. of amourettes, as explained above, and cut them into lengths of one in. Prepare a garnish of macaroni cohered with butter and grated Parmesan, and add thereto four tablespoonfuls of a crayfish cullis per four oz. of macaroni; three crayfishes’ tails for each person, and two-thirds of the pieces of amourettes. Toss well, in order to thoroughly mix the whole; dish in a timbale; cover the macaroni with what remains of the pieces of amourettes, and cover them slightly with crayfish cullis.

GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY 738 2515— SOUFFLED PUDDING SANS-SOUCI Copiously butter a mould, and sprinkle its bottom and sides with well-washed currants. Garnish with a souffled-pudding pre- paration, combined per two lbs. with one lb. of peeled apples, cut into dice and cooked in butter. Poach in a bain-marie. 2516— SOUFFLED PUDDING A LA VESUVIENNE Make a souffl^d-puddlng preparation, and add to it for the quantities given in the original recipe one and a half oz. of tomato jam and the same quantity of pipped Malaga raisins. Poach in a bain-marie in a mould with a central tube. When the pudding is turned out, surround it with apricot sauce, and pour in the middle some heated rum, which light when serving. 2517— ROLY-POLY PUDDING Proceed as for No. 2361 : prepare a firm paste from one lb. of flour, nine oz. of chopped suet, one and a half oz. of sugar, a pinch of salt, and one-sixth pint of water. Let this paste rest for one hour before using it. Roll it out to the shape of a rectangle one-fifth of an inch thick; spread a layer of jam upon it, and roll it up like a Swiss roll. Wrap it in a buttered and dredged cloth, and cook it in boiling water or in steam for one and a half hours. When about to serve, cut the roll into roundels half an inch thick, and dish them in a crown. As an accompaniment serve a fruit sauce. 2518— RISSOLES The preparation of rissoles for sweets is the same as that for rissoles served as hors-d’oeuvres, except that the former are garnished with marmalade or jam, with a fruit salpicon or with stewed fruit, with plain or pralined creams, etc. The best paste for the purpose is derived from puff-paste trimmings. The shape of rissoles varies very much. They may be shaped like half-moons, purses, small, round or oval patties, etc. Rissoles for entremets are also frequently made from ordinary brioche paste, and constitute a variety of Viennese fritters. In this case they are invariably mentioned on the menu as “ k la Dauphine.”

EGGS 167 407— OMER-PACHA EGGS Garnish a dish with a large tablespoonful of minced onions cooked in butter and unbrowned. Break the eggs over the garnish, sprinkle them with a small tablespoonful of dry, grated Parmesan cheese, and cook in a sufficiently fierce oven for a slight gratin to form as soon as the eggs are done. 408— PARMENTIER EGGS Bake some fine Dutch potatoes in the oven. Open them, from above, with an oval fancy-cutter; remove the pulp from the inside, rub it through a sieve, and make a smooth pur£e of it. Half-fill the potato-shells with this pur£e, break an egg into each, besprinkle with cream, and cook in the oven. Re- place the part of the baked shell removed in the first instance, and dish up on a napkin. 409—EGGS A LA PORTUGAISE Put a tablespoonful of tomato fondue into a dish. Break the eggs upon this, season, and cook. Between the eggs and at each end of the dish put a little heap of tomato fondue, and on each of the heaps drop a pinch of chopped parsley. 410—EGGS A LA REINE Cook the eggs in an omelet-pan, and trim them with a round fancy-cutter. Put each egg upon a small disc of Duchesse potatoes, of the same size as the egg, previously browned in the oven. Arrange the eggs in a circle round the dish; in the middle put a chicken mincemeat, and surround with a border of Supreme sauce. Poached and Soft-boiled Eggs All the recipes given hereafter apply equally to poached and soft-boiled eggs, wherefore I shall only mention “ poached ” in the titles, leaving soft-boiled to be understood. 411—PROCEDURE FOR POACHED EGGS The one and only essential condition in this case is the use of perfectly fresh eggs, for it is quite impossible to expect an even poaching if this condition is not fulfilled. (1) Have ready a saut£-pan containing boiling salted water (one-third oz. of salt per quart of water), slightly acidulated with vinegar. Break the eggs over that part of the water which is actually boiling.

614 GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY Serve them as they stand, but the questches are not eaten; they only serve as a support for the ortolan. 1976— ORTOLANS AU SUC D’ANANAS Heat some fresh butter in a flat, earthenware cocotte, and allow one-quarter oz. of it to each ortolan. Roll the previously salted ortolans in this butter, and put them in a very hot oven for three minutes. When taking them out of the oven, sprinkle them with a few tablespoonfuls of very cold pine-apple juice. Cover the cocotte, and serve immediately. The cocotte should be just large enough to hold the ortolans. 1977— ROAST WOODCOCK It should be just sufficiently high. Remove its gizzard; truss it, piercing the legs with the beak, after having drawn the eyes; cover it with slices of bacon, and cook it before a good fire for from fifteen to eighteen minutes. Dish on a cushion of fried bread, and serve the swilling-liquor separately, which in this case should be brandy and a few drops of good game gravy. ,978—SNIPES AND BECOTS For the preparation, proceed as for the woodcock. Cause to set before a fierce fire, and cook for nine minutes. >979—GRIVES ET MERLES DE CORSE (Thrushes and Corsican Blackbirds) Truss them, and wrap them in slices of bacon. Insert a juniper berry into the thrushes. Roast before a moderately fierce fire for ten or twelve minutes, and dish on small cushions of fried bread. Serve a very short gravy separately. 1980— MAUVIETTES (Larks) Wrap them in very thin slices of bacon, and impale them on a skewer, or discard the slices of bacon, and merely impale then on a skewer, separating them by blanched squares of breast of bacon. Roast for ten minutes before a fierce fire. Dish on small fried croutons, with quarters of lemon and bunches of watercress all round. 1981— CANARDS SAUVAGES (Wild Duck) SARCELLES (Teal) PILETS (Widgeons and Pintails) These birds are not covered with slices of bacon, and are 1 aasted before a fierce fire.

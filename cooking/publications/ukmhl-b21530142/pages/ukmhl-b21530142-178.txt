152 GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY minutes in this marinade, and transfer them to the dish, where they may be left to marinade for twenty-four hours. Serve very cold with a portion of the marinade. 347— FENNEL A LA GRECQUE Same process as for artichokes and celery k la Grecque. 348— FRESH FIGS Place them on a layer of very green leaves, and surround them with broken ice. 349— FOIE GRAS If in the form of a sausage, cut it into thin slices. If potted, shape it into little shells, after the manner in which butter is sometimes served, only a little smaller. In all cases serve it iced, and as soon as it is ready. 350— FRIVOLITIES I adopted the above term for those small, light, and elegant little preparations, the radical types whereof are barquettes and tartlets, which often take the place of hors-d’oeuvres on a menu. The term seems plain, clear, and explicit, and no other could denote more happily this series of trifles which constitute mere gewgaws of the dining-table. 35,—FROGS OR NYMPHS A L’AURORE For various reasons, I thought it best, in the past, to sub- stitute the mythological name “ Nymphs” for the more vulgar term “ Frogs ” on menus, and the former has been universally adopted, more particularly in reference to the following “ Chaud-froid k l’Aurore ” :— Poach the frogs’ legs in an excellent white-wine court- bouillon. When cooled, trim them properly, dry them tho- roughly in a piece of fine linen, and steep them, one after the other, in a chaud-froid sauce of fish with paprika, the tint of which should be golden. This done, arrange the treated legs on a layer of champagne jelly, which should have set beforehand on the bottom of a square, silver dish or crystal bowl. Now lay some chervil pluches and tarragon leaves between the legs in imitation of water-grasses, and cover the whole with champagne jelly to counterfeit the effect of water. Send the dish to the table, set in a block of ice, fashioned as fancy may suggest.

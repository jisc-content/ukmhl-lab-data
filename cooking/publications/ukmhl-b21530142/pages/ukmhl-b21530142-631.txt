595 GAME N.B.—This “Timbale Nesselrode'’ may be prepared after the same recipe, from Pheasant, Partridge, Woodcock or Hazel- Hen, but the name of the selected bird should, of course, appear on the menu. 1882—BECASSES ET BECASSINES FROIDES All the recipes given for cold pheasant and partridge may be applied to woodcocks and snipes. 1883—QUAILS Quails should always be chosen plump, and their fat should be white and very firm. Besides the spit, which should always be used in preference to the oven for roasting, they allow of two other methods of cooking : they may be cooked in butter, in a saucepan; or they may be poached in excellent strong and gelatinous veal stock. This last mode of procedure greatly enhances the quail’s quality and is frequently used. 1884—CAILLES EN CASSEROLE Cook them in butter, in the saucepan in which they will be served. Swill with a few drops of brandy; add a little game fumet; cover, and serve very hot. 1885—CAILLES AUX CERISES For four quails :—Truss them as for an entree and cook them with butter in a saucepan. Swill with a little brandy and a glass of port, in which a piece of orange rind should have soaked. Add three tablespoonfuls of excellent veal stock, three table- spoonfuls of red-currant jelly and about forty cherries, pre- viously poached in a boiling syrup of about 180 (Saccharometer) and cooled in the syrup. Drain them before adding them to the quail, and, if the sauce be too insipid, sharpen it with a few drops of lemon juice. 1886—CAILLES A LA DAUPHINE Wrap each quail in a buttered vine-leaf and a thin, square slice of bacon, and roast them for ten minutes. Meanwhile, prepare a well-seasoned pur6e of fresh peas with lettuce, and reduce it to a somewhat stiff consistence. Line the bottom and sides of a deep dish with very thin slices of ham; pour the puree into it; smooth the surface, and half-plunge the quails into this puree. Place in the oven for ten minutes, and this done, send the dish to the table immediately. Q Q 2

Apples (Pommes). 2588—APPLE FRITTERS Take some russet apples, which are the best for the purpose, and make a hole through their centres with a tube three-quarters of an inch in diameter, to remove the core and the pips. Peel them and cut them into roundels one-third of an inch thick, and macerate them for twenty minutes in powdered sugar and brandy or rum. A few minutes before serving, dry them slightly; dip the roundels into thin batter, and plunge them into plenty of hot fat. Drain them, set them on a tray, sprinkle them with icing sugar, glaze them quickly, and dish them on a napkin. 2589—APPLES WITH BUTTER Core some gray Calville or russet apples by means of the tube- cutter; peel them and parboil them for two minutes in boiling water, containing a little lemon juice. Then set them in a buttered saut6pan; add a few tablespoonfuls of vanilla-flavoured syrup, and cook them under cover in the oven. Dish them on little, round, brioche croiitons, glazed in the oven, and fill the hollow with butter worked with an equal weight of powdered sugar, and mixed with a little brandy. Cover the apples with their own syrup, slightly thickened with apricot purde. 2590—POMMES A LA BONNE-FEMME Core some russet apples with the tube-cutter, and slightly cut them all round.

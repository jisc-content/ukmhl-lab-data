GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY 462 tion; two-thirds oz. of salt, a pinch of pepper, and a little spice; a pinch of wild-thyme leaves, and a leaf of bay, both chopped. Mix the whole well with one pint of blood of pork, and put it into the gut without over-filling it, for it should be borne in mind that the preparation swells in poaching. Set the boudins on willow lattices or baskets; plunge them into boiling water, and, from that time, keep the latter at 203° F. Let them poach for twenty minutes, and remember to prick all those that, by rising to the surface, show they contain air, which might burst their skins. When about to serve them, cisel them on both sides, and grill them very gently. They are generally accompanied by a potato pur£e with cream. 1408— BOUDINS NOIRS A L’ANGLAISE Have ready the same preparation as for black boudins, given above, and add to it three-quarters lb. of rice, cooked in con- somm£ and kept somewhat firm. Poach as before, and leave to cool. Cisel the boudins, and grill them over a moderate fire. Serve very hot with an apple pur£e. 1409— BOUDINS NOIRS A LA FLAMANDE Have ready the same preparation as for black boudins, and add to it three oz. of moist sugar, two oz. of raisins, and the same quantity of currants, washed and swelled in lukewarm water. Put the preparation into the gut, and poach in the usual way. When about to serve, grill these boudins gently, after the manner of black boudins, and send them to the table with a sugared apple sauce.

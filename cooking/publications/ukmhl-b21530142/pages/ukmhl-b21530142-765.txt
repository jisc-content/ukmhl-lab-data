ENTREMETS 727 Smooth it all round with the blade of a knife; decorate according to fancy with the contents of the piping-bag, and cook in a good, moderate oven, for as long as the size of the omelet requires. Two minutes before withdrawing it from the oven, sprinkle it with icing sugar, that the latter, when melted, may cover the omelet with a brilliant coat. Flavour according to fancy, with vanilla, orange or lemon rind, rum, Kirsch, &c.; but remember to add the selected flavour to the preparation before the egg-whites are added to it. Surprise Omelets. 2466—Example: NORWEGIAN OMELET Place an oval cushion one and one half in. thick of Gtnoise upon a long dish, and let the cushion be as long as the desired omelet. Upon this cushion set a pyramid of ice-cream with fruit. Cover the ice-cream with ordinary meringue (No. 2382); smooth it with a knife, making it of an even thickness of two-thirds of an inch in so doing; decorate it, by means of the piping-bag, with the same meringue, and set in a very hot oven, that the meringue may cook and colour quickly, without the heat reaching the ice inside. 2467— SURPRISE OMELET MYLORD Proceed as directed above; but garnish the cushion of Gtnoise with coats of vanilla ice-cream, alternated with coats of stewed pears. Cover with meringue and cook in the same way. 2468— CHINESE SURPRISE OMELET The procedure is the same, but the vanilla ice-cream is re- placed by tangerine ice. On taking the omelet out of the oven, surround it with tangerines glazed with sugar, cooked to the large- crack stage. 2469—SURPRISE OMELET WITH CHERRIES Garnish the cushion of Gtnoise with red-currant ice, fla- voured with raspberries and mixed with equal quantities of cherry ice and half-sugared cherries, macerated in Kirsch. Finish it like the Norwegian Omelet. On taking it out of the oven, surround the omelet with drained cherries, preserved in brandy, and sprinkle it with heated Kirsch, to which set a light at the table.

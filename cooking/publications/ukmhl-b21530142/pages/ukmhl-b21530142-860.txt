CHAPTER XXII FRUIT-STEWS AND JAMS. 2952— PLAIN STEWED FRUIT Fruit for stewing is used whole, halved or quartered, and cooked or poached in a syrup, of a flavour in keeping with the fruit. Dish these preparations in tazzas, bowls or deep dishes ; cover them with their syrup, reduced or not; and, in certain cases, thicken the latter with arrowroot. They may be served hot or cold ; but in any case, the fruit used should not be too ripe. 2953— MIXED STEWED FRUIT These preparations generally consist of stewed, fresh fruit of one or several kinds ; combined with fruit purges. Quince and apple jellies are greatly used, either in coating the preparations or in bordering them with dice, &c. With this class of stewed fruits, which are merely a matter of fancy and taste, candied and preserved fruits are almost always used as auxiliary constituents. 2954— JAMS Under this generic title the following preparations are classed :— (1) Those in which the fruit is treated directly with the sugar:— (2) Those in which the j'uice alone, owing to its gelatinous nature, produces, together writh the sugar, consistent jellies. The amount of sugar used is subject to the nature of the fruit and its sweetness ; but in the case of nearly all tart fruits, the weight of sugar should equal that of the fruit, or nearly so. If too much sugar be used, the flavour is impaired ; while crystal- lisation will follow very shortly afterwards ; if too little be used, the jam has to be overcooked in order to be made sufficiently consist- ent, and the flavour is once more impaired by protracted evapora- tion ; finally if the time allowed for cooking be inadequate, rapid fermentation will be the result.

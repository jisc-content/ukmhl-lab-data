ICES B15 2932—PUNCH A LA ROMAINE Mix sufficient dry white wine, or dry champagne, with one pint of syrup at 220, to reduce the latter to 170; add the juice of two oranges and two lemons, a strip of orange and lemon zest, and let infusion proceed for one hour. Strain the syrup and bring it to 180. Freeze in the freezer, until it is somewhat stiff, and mix it with the quarter of its volume of Italian meringue (prepared from two egg-whites and three and a half oz. of sugar). When about to serve, complete with one-fifth pint of Rum, added little by little. Serve the preparation in glasses, after the style of the Sherbets. N.B.—For all Sherbets and Punches, one quart of the finished preparation should be allowed for every ten people. 2933—SPOOMS Spoom is a kind of Sherbet prepared from a syrup at 20°. Add to it twice as much Italian meringue as was added to the Sherbets. Do not work it too briskly, that it may remain very light and frothy. Spooms are made from fruit juices ; but more often from such wines as Champagne, Samos, Muscat, Zucco, etc. Serve it in glasses like the Sherbets.

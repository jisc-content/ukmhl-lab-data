602 GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY 1917 -MOUSSES DE CAILLES See the various remarks made concerning this subject, under Pheasant, Partridge and Woodcock. 1918— LAND RAIL, ROI DE CAILLES OU RALE DE GENETS The Land Rail, which must not be confused with the Water Rail, is most often served roasted, but all the quail recipes, hot or cold (except those in which Granite forms an accompani- ment) may be applied to it. 1919— HAZEL-HENS 1920-BLACK GAME 1921—PRAIRIE-HENS 1922—PTARMIGAN 1923—GROUSE *924—GANGAS These birds, one or two of which, such as grouse and the hazel-hen, are of incomparable delicacy and high culinary value, are mostly served roasted. Mousses, Mousselines and Salmis are also prepared from them, after the directions already given. But I must remind the reader that when they serve in the preparation of a salmis, their skins and legs, which are bitter, must be discarded. All these birds must be treated while still very fresh. 1925— GRIVES ET MERLES DE CORSE (Thrushes and Corsican Blackbirds) The greater part of the quail recipes, more particularly the “ en casserole” and “sous la cendre ” ones, may be applied to these excellent birds. The two following recipes are proper to them. 1926— GRIVES OU MERLES A LA BONNE-FEMME Cook the birds in butter, with one oz. of very small dice of salted breast of bacon to each bird. Put them into a hot cocotte with two-thirds oz. of butter per bird; heat; add some square croutons fried in butter; sprinkle with the saucepan-swillings, which should be a few drops of brandy; cover, and serve very hot immediately. 1927— GRIVES OU MERLES A LA LIEGEOISE Cook the birds in butter on the stove, in an uncovered earthenware saucepan. When they are nearly done, sprinkle them with two finely-chopped juniper berries per bird; add some round croutons of bread-crumb fried in butter; cover, and serve very hot. This procedure particularly suits thrushes, more especially when these come from the Ardennes.

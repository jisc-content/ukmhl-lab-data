776 GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY Gooseberries (Groseilles vertes). 2686— GOOSEBERRY FOOL Poach one pound of green gooseberries in some thin syrup. When they are cooked, thoroughly drain them; rub them through a sieve, and collect the pur£e in a flat saucepan. Work this pur£e on ice, and add the necessary amount of icing sugar to it. The amount of the icing sugar varies according to the acidity of the fruit and the sweetness of the poaching-syrup. Combine with the puree an equal quantity of very stiffly whipped cream ; set the preparation in the shape of a dome in a timbale: decorate its surface, by means of a piping-bag, with Chantilly cream, and serve very cold. Tangerines (Mandarines). 2687— MANDARINES ALMINA Cut a slice of the rind from the stem-end of the tangerines by means of a round, even cutter, one inch in diameter. Then empty them, and fill the rinds with a preparation of Bavarois with violets, combined with crumbled lady’s-finger biscuits, sprinkled with Maraschino. Close the tangerines with the slice cut off at the start; let them set in a cool place, and, at the last moment, lay them on a dish covered with a folded napkin. 2688— MANDARINES A LA CREME Empty the tangerines, and fill their peels with a somewhat thick tangerine Bavarois preparation, combined with a third of its bulk of fresh, raw cream. Place them in ice until they have to be served ; dish them as directed in the preceding recipe. 2689— MANDARINES EN SURPRISE Proceed as for the oranges, but for the orange ice sub- stitute tangerine jelly.

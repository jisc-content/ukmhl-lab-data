GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY 8oo Between the two ices set a line of small strawberries, macerated in orange juice. Border the bowls with Chantilly cream, and sprinkle the latter with crystallised violets. 2813— COUPES MADAME SANS-G&NE Garnish the bottom and sides of the bowls with a layer of vanilla ice-cream. Fill them with Bar red-currant jam, and cover the latter, by means of a spoon, with Chantilly cream. 2814— COUPES TUTTI-FRUTTI Sprinkle the bottom of the bowls with various fresh fruits cut into dice ; garnish the bowls with strawberry, pine-apple and lemon ices, spread alternately with layers of the same fruits. 2815— COUPES VENUS Half-fill the bowls with vanilla ice-cream. In the middle of each bowl set a small peach, poached in vanilla-flavoured syrup, with a very red, small cherry upon it. Border the peaches with a thread of Chantilly cream. 2816— LIGHT ICES These ices differ from those dealt with above, in that they are moulded and frozen directly, without a sojourn in the freezer. To this class belong the ices most commonly served and the best; and, since their preparation requires no special utensils, they may be served everywhere: such are the “ Iced Biscuits,” the “ Bombes,” the “ Mousses,” the “ Parfaits,” the “ Puddings,” and the “ Iced Souffles.” These different kinds of ices greatly resemble one another, and their names, which are puzzling at times, are only a matter of fancy. 2817— VARIOUS PREPARATIONS The old iced-biscuit preparation consisted of an English custard, prepared from one lb. of sugar, twelve egg-yolks, and one pint of milk. When the custard was cooked, it used to be strained into a basin, left to cool (being fanned the while), and then placed upon ice, and finished with the whisk. Originally this cream was moulded at this stage ; but now it is customary to add one quart of whipped cream to it ; which operation renders the recipe more like that of a Bombe, which, in its turn, resembles that of the preparation for Mousses.

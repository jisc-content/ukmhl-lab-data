282 GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY The sole is always laid on the dish with its opened side undermost—that is to say, on its back. 819— SOLE MORNAY Lay the sole on a buttered dish; sprinkle a little fish fumet over it, and add one-half oz. of butter divided into small pieces. Poach gently. Coat the bottom of the dish on which the sole is to be served with Mornay sauce; drain the fish, lay it on the prepared dish; cover it with the same sauce; sprinkle with grated Gruy&re and Parmesan, and glaze at a Salamander. 820— SOLE MORNAY DES PROVEN£AUX This sole, which used to be served at the famous restaurant of the “ Fr&res Provengaux,” was prepared, and always may be prepared, as follows : — Poach the sole in fish fuviet and butter, as directed in the preceding recipe; drain it, and place it on a dish; cover it with white-wine sauce; sprinkle liberally with grated cheese, and glaze quickly. 821— SOLE AU CHAMPAGNE Poach the sole in a buttered dish with one-half pint of champagne. Dish it; reduce its cooking-liquor to half; add thereto one-sixth pint of velout£, and complete with one and one-half oz. of best butter. Cover the sole with this sauce; glaze, and garnish each side of the dish with a little heap of a julienne of filleted sole, seasoned, dredged, and tossed in clarified butter at the last moment in order to have it very crisp. N.B.—By substituting a good white wine for the champagne, a variety of dishes may be made, among which may be men- tioned : Soles au Chablis, Soles au Sauterne, Sole au Samos, Sole au Chateau Yquem, &c., &c. 822— SOLE COLBERT On the upper side of the fish separate the fillets from the spine, and break the latter in several places. Dip the sole in milk; roll it in flour; treat it a Vanglaise, and roll the separated fillets back a little, so that they may be quite free from the bones. Fry; drain on a piece of linen; remove the bones, and fill the resulting space with butter k la Maitre d’Hotel. Serve the sole on a very hot dish.

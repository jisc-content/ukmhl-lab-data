596 GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY 1887— CAILLES FIGARO Insert a piece of truffle into each quail, and wrap them each in a piece of gut together with a bit of pale veal glaze, the size of a pigeon’s egg. String the pieces of gut at two points one in. from either extremity of the quails, that the envelope may not burst while cooking. Poach the quails in good veal stock, that they may not be washed as they would be if the gut happened to burst in a poaching-liquor consisting of salted water. Serve the quails as they leave their cooking-liquor. 1888— CAILLES A LA GRECQUE Cook the quails in a saucepan, and set them in a timbale, half-garnished with “ Riz h la Grecque.” Swill the saucepan with a few tablespoonfuls of game fumct, and pour this swilling- liquor over the quails, without clearing it of grease. 1889— CAILLES JULIETTE Divide the quails into two along the back and do not separate the two halves; season them; sprinkle them with melted butter and finely-chopped truffle. Wrap each quail in a piece of pig’s caul; sprinkle again with melted butter and fine raspings, and grill gently. Dish the quails and sprinkle them with a few drops of ver- juice. 1890— CAILLES JUDIC Poele the quails. Dish them in the form of a crown, each on a small, braised lettuce, with a cock’s kidney on either side and a truffle on top. Coat with a half-glaze sauce prepared with quail fumet. 1891— CAILLES LUCULLUS Cook the quails in butter. Dish them in a circle on a round dish, each on an oval or rectangular fried crouton, and between each set a fine truffle cooked in Champagne and chicken glaze. 1892— CAILLES A LA NORMANDE Peel, mince and toss some apples in butter, as explained under “ Faisan k la Normande.” Allow half an apple per quail. Garnish the bottom of a cocotte with some of these apples; upon them set the quails, browned in butter; add what remains of the apples; sprinkle with a few tablespoonfuls of cream, and complete the cooking in the oven.

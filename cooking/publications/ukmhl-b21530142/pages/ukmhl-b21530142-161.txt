PART II RECIPES AND MODES OF PROCEDURE In Part I. of this work I treated of the general principles on which the science of cookery is founded, and the leading operations constituting the basis of the work. In Part II. I shall proceed from the general to the particular ^-in other words, I shall set forth the recipes of every dish I touch upon, its method of preparation, and its constituent parts. With the view of making reference as easy as possible, with- out departing from a certain logical order, I have adopted the method of classifying these recipes in accordance with the position the dishes they represent hold in the ordinary menu, and thus, starting with the hors-d’oeuvres, I go straight on to the dessert. I was compelled, however, to alter my plan in the case of eggs, which never appear on the menu of a dinner save in Lent.

It will be seen that I have placed the Savouries before the Entremets, instead of after the Ices, as is customary in England. My reason for this apparent anomaly is that I con- sider it a positive gastronomical heresy to eat fish, meats, fowl- remains, &c., after delicate Entremets and Ices, the subtle flavour of the latter, which form such an agreeable item in a dinner, being quite destroyed by the violent seasoning of the former. Moreover, the very pretext brought forward in support of this practice, so erroneous from the gastronomical standpoint, namely, “ that after a good dinner it is necessary to serve something strange and highly seasoned, in order to whet the diner’s thirst,” is its own condemnation. For, if appetite is satiated and thirst is quenched, it follows

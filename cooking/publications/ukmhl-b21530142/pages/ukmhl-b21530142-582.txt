546 GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY 1722a—DINDONNEAU FROID All the recipes given for cold pullets may be applied to this bird. Goose (Oie) The principal value of the goose from the culinary point of view lies in the fact that it supplies the best, most delicate and firmest foie gras. Apart from this property, the preciousness of which is truly inestimable, goose is really only served at bourgeois or family tables. 1722b—OISON A L’ALLEMANDE Completely bone the gosling’s breast; season it inside, and stuff it with quartered, peeled and cored apples, half-cooked in butter. Sew up the openings, and braise gently, basting with fat the while. When the gosling is cooked, dish it and surround it with peeled apples, cored by means of the tube-cutter, cooked in butter, and garnished with red-currant jelly. Drain away three- quarters of the grease; swill the braising-pan with the required quantity of good gravy for roasts; strain this gravy, and serve it separately. 1722c—OISON A L’ALSACIENNE Stuff the gosling with very good sausage-meat; truss; colour in butter and focle. Dish and surround with sauerkraut braised in goose grease, and rectangles of lean bacon, cooked writh the sauerkraut. 1723— OISON A L’ANGLAISE Cook one lb. of unpeeled onions in the oven. When they are cold, peel them; chop them, and add to them an equal weight of soaked and pressed bread, one oz. of fresh or chopped sage, salt, pepper and nutmeg. Stuff the gosling with this preparation; truss it, and roast it on the spit or in the oven. Dish it; surround it with the gravy, which should be some- what fat, and serve a sauceboat of slightly-sugared, stewed apples, separately. 1724— OISON EN CIVET When killing the gosling, carefully collect its blood. Add the juice of a lemon and beat it, so as to prevent coagulation, until it is quite cold.

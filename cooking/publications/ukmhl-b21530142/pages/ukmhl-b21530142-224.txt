GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY 198 there might be no sort of doubt as to the exact quantity of royale it would be necessary to prepare for any one of the soups. Clear Soups and Garnished Consommes 539— CONSOMME ALEXANDRA Have a quart of excellent chicken consomm£ ready; add thereto, in order to thicken it slightly, three tablespoonfuls of poached tapioca, strained through muslin, and very clear. Put the following garnish into the soup-tureen : One table- spoonful of white chicken-meat cut in fine julienne-fashion, one tablespoonful of small chicken quenelles, grooved and long in shape, and one tablespoonful of lettuce chiffonade. Pour the boiling consomm^ upon this garnish, and send to the table immediately. 540— CONSOMME AMBASSADRICE Have one quart of chicken consomm^ ready; also there should have been prepared beforehand, with the view of using them quite cold, three different kinds of royales, consisting respectively of truffle pur6e, tomato pur6e, and purde of peas, each of which should have been poached in a dariole-mould. Cut these royales up into regular dice, and put them in the soup-tureen with one tablespoonful of chicken fillet and an equal quantity of small, freshly-cooked mushrooms, finely minced. Pour the boiling consomm6 over these garnishes, and serve at once. 541— CONSOMME ANDALOUSE Prepare a baha-mould of royale made from tomato pur6e. When quite cold, cut it into dice, and put these in the soup- tureen with one small tablespoonful of cooked ham cut in julienne-fashion, one tablespoonful of boiled rice, with every grain distinct and separate, and two tablespoonfuls of threaded eggs (No. 217). When about to serve, pour one quart of very clear chicken consomm6 over the garnish. 542— CONSOMME D’ARENBERG With a small spoon-cutter, pick out a spoonful of carrot pearls and the same quantity of turnip pearls. Cook these vegetables by boiling them in consomm^, taking care that the latter be reduced to a glaze when the vegetables are cooked.

GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY 166 401— EGGS AU GRATIN Put a tablespoonful of very hot Mornay sauce into a dish. Break the eggs into it, cover them with Mornay sauce, sprinkle with grated cheese mixed with fine raspings, and cook in a fierce oven, in order that the eggs and the gratin may be done at the same time. 402— ISOLINE EGGS Cook the eggs according to No. 395. Place between them, and all round the dish, some small, halved tomatoes k la Pro- ven<;ale. Put in the centre of each halved tomato a fine chicken’s liver sauted with Madeira. 403— JOCKEY CLUB EGGS Cook the eggs in an omelet-pan; tilt them gently on to a dish, and trim them with a round fancy-cutter. Place each egg upon a round, thin piece of toast, and then cover them with foie-gras pur£e. Arrange them in the form of a crown, on a dish, and pour into the middle a garnish of calf’s kidneys cut into dice and sauted, and truffles similarly cut, the latter being cohered by means of some dense half-glaze. 404— LULLY EGGS Cook the eggs in an omelet-pan, and cut them with a round fancy-cutter. Place each egg on a slice of raw ham, cut to the same shape as the former, and fried in butter. Then place the egg and ham on toast similarly shaped and of the same size. Arrange the eggs in a circle round the dish, and garnish the middle of it with macaroni combined with concassed to- matoes stewed in butter. 405— MEYERBEER EGGS Cook the eggs as in No. 395. Place a small, grilled sheep’s or lamb’s kidney between each yolk, and surround with a thread of P^rigueux sauce. 406— MIRABEAU EGGS Substitute for ordinary butter, anchovy butter. Break the eggs and cook them. Surround each yolk with anchovy fillets, and garnish each of these with a spray of parboiled tarragon leaves. Place a large olive stuffed with tarragon butter on either side of the yolks.

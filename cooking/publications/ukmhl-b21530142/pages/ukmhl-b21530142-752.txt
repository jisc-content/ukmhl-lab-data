7 H GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY pears, apples, &c., may also be used in the form of light purges or cullises. 2410— APRICOT SAUCE Rub some very ripe or stewed apricots through a sieve, and thin the pur£e with the required quantity of syrup at 28° (Saccharom.). Boil, skimming carefully the while ; take off the fire when the sauce veneers the withdrawn spoon, and flavour according to fancy. If this sauce is to be used with crusts, a little best butter may be added to it. 2411— RED-CURRANT SAUCE Melt some red-currant jelly and flavour it with kirsch. This sauce may be slightly thickened with arrowroot. 2412— SAUCE ORANGE Rub some orange marmalade through a sieve ; add thereto one-third of its bulk of apricot sauce, and flavour with Curasao. 2413— HAZEL-NUT SAUCE Flavour some English custard with an infusion of grilled hazel- nuts, and add two tablespoonfuls of moulded filbert pralin per quart of custard. 2414— GREENGAGE OR MIRABELLE SAUCE Proceed as for apricot sauce and flavour with kirsch. 2415— CHERRY SAUCE Take the syrup of some stewed cherries, add an equal quantity of red-currant jelly, and flavour with kirsch. 2416— RASPBERRY SAUCE Take the required quantity of melted raspberry jelly; thicken it slightly with arrowroot, and flavour with kirsch. 2417— STRAWBERRY SAUCE Proceed as for No. 2416. 2418— THICKENED SYRUPS These accompaniments of sweets, which are commonly used in Germany, have this in their favour, that they are economical; but they should be used in moderation. To make them, take some syrup at 15° thickened with arrowroot, coloured according to the purpose for which it is required, and flavoured with some liqueur or essence at the last moment. It is with this kind of sauce that flawns and all other sorts of tartlets are coated in northern countries.

GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY 654 Complete the cooking as directed in the preceding recipe. N.B.—Proceeding in the same way, turnips may be stuffed with spinach, chicory, and even with farinaceous vegetables or rice, kept very creamy. All these garnishes are at once sightly and excellent. 2179— PUREE DE NAVETS (Turnip Puree) Slice the turnips and cook them in a little butter, salt, sugar, and the necessary amount of water. Rub through tammy, and thicken the resulting pur£e with only just the required quantity of very good mashed potatoes. 2180— TURNIP-TOPS Young turnip-tops are very much liked in England as a luncheon vegetable. They should be prepared like “ Choux verts cooked a I’anglaise.” Onions (Oignons) 2181— STUFFED ONIONS Take some medium-sized, mild, Spanish onions; cut them at a point one-quarter of their height from the top, and parboil them thoroughly. Empty them, leaving only a wall one-third in. thick; chop up the withdrawn parts, and mix them with an equal quantity of Duxelles (No. 225). Garnish the emptied onions with this preparation; complete their cooking by braising them, and glaze them at the last moment, simultaneously with the formation of the gratin. N.B.—Proceed in the same way for onions stuffed with spinach, Rizotto, or semolina, &c., as suggested under Nos. 2177 and 2178. Onions may also be garnished with a souffle preparation of spinach, tomatoes, chicory, &c. Herein lies scope for a great variety of excellent and uncommon garnishes. 2182— FRIED ONIONS Cut them into roundels one-fifth in. thick; separate the rings; season them with salt and pepper; dredge them and fry them in very hot oil. Drain on a piece of linen and salt slightly. Onions prepared in this way are used particularly as an accompaniment. 2183— GLAZED ONIONS For the preparation without colouration: Peel some smah onions of equal size without grazing them. Set them to cook

GAME 603 1928—GRIVES ET MERLES FROIDS The various, cold preparations of quails, except those com- prising a Granite, may be applied to thrushes.

Place a lark in each potato, together with a few bacon dice and some of the cooking-fat; return cover of each potato to its place; fix it there by means of cotton, and wrap each potato in oiled paper.

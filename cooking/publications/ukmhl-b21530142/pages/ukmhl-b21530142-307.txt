FISH 277 Cut some small slices, one-third inch thick, from a fillet of salmon. Arrange them on a buttered tray; poach them, dry, in a moderate oven, and cool them under a light weight. Now trim them neatly, with an even cutter, oval or round, in accordance with the shape they are intended to have. Coat them, according to their purpose, either with mayon- naise sauce or one of its derivatives, thickened with jelly, or a white, pink, or green chaud-froid sauce. Decorate it in any way that may be fancied, and glaze them with cold melted aspic jelly. Dish after the manner described under “ Cotelettes ” (see above). 809—MAYONNAISE DE SAUMON Garnish the bottom of a salad-bowl with moderately seasoned, ciseled lettuce. Cover with cold, cooked and flaked salmon, thoroughly cleared of all skin and bones. Coat with mayonnaise sauce, and decorate with anchovy fillets, capers, stoned olives, small slices or roundels or quarters of hard-boiled eggs, small hearts of lettuce, a border of little roundels of radish, &c. 810—SALADE DE SAUMON This preparation comprises the same ingredients as the above, with the exception of the mayonnaise sauce. The de- corating garnish is placed directly upon the salmon, and the whole is seasoned in precisely the same way as an ordinary salad. TROUT. From the culinary standpoint, trout are divided into two quite distinct classes, viz., large trout, whereof the typical specimen is Salmon-trout, and small or fresh-water trout. 811—TRUITE SAUMONEE (Salmon Trout) In its many preparations, salmon-trout may be replaced by salmon, and all the recipes relating to the former may be adapted to the latter. In any case, however, as its size is less than that of salmon, it is very rarely cut into darnes, being more generally served fthole. The few recipes that follow are proper to salmon-trout. 812—TRUITE A LA CAMBACERES Select a male trout in preference; clean it, and remove its gills without opening it in the region of the belly.

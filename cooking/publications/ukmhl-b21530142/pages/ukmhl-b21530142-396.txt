3^4 GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY Important Remarks relative to the Sauces suited to Entries of Butcher’s Meat, Garnished with Vegetables The derivative sauces of the Espagnole are not, as a rule, suited to entries garnished with vegetables. Thickened gravy is better. The finest adjunct, however, is meat-glaze, which should receive an addition of four oz. of butter per pint, and should be slightly acidulated by means of a few drops of lemon juice. This glaze ought to be so light as not to impaste the vegetables. Such vegetables as asparagus-heads, peas, French beans, macedoines, &c., have a disintegrating action upon the sauces, and this is owing either to their natural moisture or to their leason. As a result of this action the preparation has an un- sightly appearance when served upon the diner’s plate. With Chateaubriand sauce (No. 71) or buttered meat-glaze this objection does not obtain, seeing that this sauce does not decompose, but combines admirably with the garnish, and lends the latter a certain noticeable mellowness. I therefore emphasise this point, viz., that the derivative sauces of the Espagnole and tomato sauces should be exclusively used with such preparations garnished with truffles, cock’s combs and kidneys, quenelles and mushrooms, as “ la Financtere,” “ la Godard,” &c. TOURNEDOS 1077— TOURNEDOS ALGERIENNE Season the tournedos, and fry them in clarified butter. Arrange them in the form of a crown on a round dish, and set a croquette of sweet potato, moulded to a round shape, upon each. Around the whole lay some small, emptied, and seasoned half-tomatoes, stewed in oil. 1078— TOURNEDOS ALSACIENNE Season and grill the tournedos. There should have been prepared in advance as many small tartlet-crusts as there are tournedos. Garnish these tartlets with well-drained, braised sauerkraut, and set on each a roundel of the lean of ham, stamped out with an even cutter. Arrange them in the form of a crown on a dish, and set a tournedos upon each tartlet.

4o GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY the dish. Reduce by a good quarter, and add two oz. of Gruyere and two oz. of grated Parmesan. Put the sauce on the fire again for a few minutes, and ensure the melting of the cheese by stirring with a small whisk. Finish the sauce away from the fire with two oz. of butter added by degrees. 92— MOUSSELINE SAUCE To a Hollandalse Sauce, prepared as explained (No. 30), add, just before dishing up, one-half pint of stiffly-whipped cream per pint of sauce. 93— MOUSSEUSE SAUCE Scald and wipe a small vegetable-pan, and put into it one- half lb. of stiffly-manied butter, properly softened. Season this butter with table-salt and a few drops of lemon-juice, and whisk it while gradually adding one-third pint of cold water. Finish with two tablespoonfuls of very firm, whipped cream. This pre- paration, though classified as a sauce, is really a compound butter, which is served with boiled fish. The heat of the fish alone suffices to melt it, and its appearance is infinitely more agreeable than that of plain, melted butter. 94— MUSTARD SAUCE Take the necessary quantity of butter sauce and complete it, away from the fire, with one tablespoonful of mustard per pint of sauce. N.B.—If the sauce has to wait, if must be kept in a bain- marie, for it should not on any account boil. It is served with certain small grilled fish, especially fresh herrings. 95— NANTUA SAUCE Boil one pint of Bechamel Sauce, add one-half pint of cream, and reduce by a third. Rub it through a tammy, and finish it with a further addition of two tablespoonfuls of cream, three oz. of very fine crayfish butter, and one tablespoonful of small, shelled crayfishes’ tails. 96— NEWBURG SAUCE First Method (with Raw Lobsters).—Divide a two lb. lobster into four parts. Remove its creamy parts, pound them finely with two oz. of butter, and put them aside.

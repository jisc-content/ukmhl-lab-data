GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY 772 Turn out the tartlets of apricot jelly and place them in a crown over the border. Garnish the centre of the latter with chopped anisette-flavoured pink jelly. Pine-apple (Ananas). 2668— ANANAS GEORGETTE Take a fine whole pine-apple, and hollow it out to within hall an inch of its outside all round and at the bottom. Put aside the slice cut from the top, on which is the bunch of leaves. Fill the inside with a Bavarois preparation made from pine- apple pur£e, combined with the withdrawn pine-apple pulp, cut into thin slices, and leave to set. Dish on a napkin, and return the top slice to the pine-apple, that it may seem untouched. 2669— ANANAS A LA V1RGINIE Proceed exactly as above, but replace the pine-apple Bavarois preparation by a strawberry kind, combined, as before, with the pulp withdrawn from the inside of the pine-apple, cut into dice. 2670— ANANAS A LA NINON Line the sides of a souffle timbale with vanilla ice-cream, laying it in an oblique strip from the edge of the utensil to the centre of the bottom of the timbale. Upon this layer of ice-cream set two or three rows of thin pine-apple slices, in such a way as to make the slices of the last row project beyond the edge of the timbale. In the centre of the mould build a pyramid of wild straw- berries ; cover this with a raspberry puree, and sprinkle the latter with chopped pistachios. 2670a—PINE-APPLE A LA ROYALE Take a fresh pine-apple and cut a slice from its top, contain- ing the bunch of leaves. Withdraw the pulp from the inside, and leave a thickness of about half an inch all round and on the bottom. Fill it with a macedoine of fresh fruit macerated in Kirsch ; set it in the middle of a crystal bowl; and surround the base with a crown of fine Montreuil peaches, poached in a vanilla-flavoured syrup, alternated by large strawberries, macerated in 'Kirsch. Return the bunch of leaves to its place upon the pine-apple.

28 GUIDE TO MODERN COOKERY with red wine. The wine is reduced by half, thickened by a pint of Lenten Espagnole per pint of the reduction, and the sauce is despumated for about twenty minutes. It is strained through a tammy, and finished, when ready, by a few drops of anchovy essence, a little cayenne, and two oz. of butter per pint of sauce. 39— GRAND-VENEUR SAUCE Take one pint of Poivrade Sauce (No. 49) and boil it, adding one pint of game stock to keep it light; reduce the sauce by a good third; remove it from the fire, and add four tablespoonfuls of red-currant jelly. When the latter is well dissolved, com- plete the sauce by one-quarter pint of cream per pint of sauce. This sauce is the proper accompaniment for joints of venison. 40— ITALIAN SAUCE Ordinary Italian Sauce.—Put into a stewpan six tablespoon- fuls of Duxelles (see No. 223), two oz. of very lean, cooked ham, cut very finely, brunoise-fashion, and one pint of half- glaze tomat^e. Boil for ten minutes, and complete, at the moment of dishing up, with one teaspoonful of parsley, chervil, and tarragon, minced and mixed. Lenten Italian Sauce.—Same preparation, only (1) omit the ham, and (2) substitute Lent Espagnole (combined with fish jumet made from the fish for which the sauce is intended) for half glaze with tomatoes. 41— THICKENED GRAVY Boil one pint of poultry or veal stock (according to the nature of the dish the gravy is intended for). Thicken this sauce by means of three-quarters oz. of fecula, diluted cold, with a little water or gravy, and pour this leason into the boiling gravy, being careful to stir briskly. The thickened gravy with the veal-stock base is used for choicest pieces of butcher’s meat; that with a poultry-stock base is for fillets of poultry. 42— VEAL GRAVY TOMATE Add to one pint of veal stock two oz. of pur£e and one- quarter pint of tomato juice, and reduce by a fifth. Strain the gravy through linen. This gravy is for butcher’s meat.

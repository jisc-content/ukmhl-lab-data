CHAPTER VII i. Elementary Preparations Before bioaching the question of the numerous prepara- tions which constitute the various soup, relev£, and entree gar- nishes, it will be necessary to give the formulae of the elementary preparations, or what are technically called the mise en place. If the various operations which go to make the mise en place were not, at least summarily, discussed here, I should be compelled to repeat them in each formula for which they are required—that is to say, in almost every formula. I should thus resemble those bad operators who, having neglected their mise en place, are obliged to make it in the course of other work, and thereby not only run the risk of making it badly, but also of losing valuable time which might be used to better advantage. Elementary preparations consist of those things whereof one is constantly in need, which may be prepared in advance, and which are kept available for use at a moment’s notice. 173—ANCHOVIES (FILLETS OF) Whether they be for hors d’oeuvres or for culinary use, it is always best to have these handy. After having washed and well wiped them, in order to re- move the white powder resulting from the little scales with which they are covered, they should be neatly trimmed to the shape of extended oblongs. Then detach the fillets from the bones by gentle pulling, divide each fillet lengthwise into three or four smaller fillets, put the latter into a small narrow dish or a little bowl, and cover them with oil. The fillets may also be kept whole with a view to rolling them into rings. S74—ANQLAISE (FOR EGG-AND-BREAD-CRUMBING) It is well to have this always ready for those dishes which arc to be panes a Vanglaise, or as many of the recipes direct: treated a Vanglaise.

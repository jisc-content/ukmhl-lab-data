141 HORS-D’CEUVRES 293—PIMENTO BUTTER Pound four oz. of preserved or freshly-cooked capsicum; add as much butter thereto, and rub through a fine sieve. 294— CAVIARE CREAM Pound four oz. of preserved caviare and add thereto, little by little, two tablespoonfuls of fresh cream and two oz. of softened butter. Rub through a fine sieve, and finish the pre- paration by an addition of three tablespoonfuls of whisked cream. N.B.—This cream and those that follow often take the place of the butters in the preparation of hors-d’oeuvres. The addition of previously well-softened butter to these creams is necessary in order to make them sufficiently consistent when they cool. 295— LOBSTER CREAM Pound four oz. of lobster trimmings, spawn, and coral, and add thereto three tablespoonfuls of fresh cream and two oz. of softened butter.

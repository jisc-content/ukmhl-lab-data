CHAPTER IV. FISH. BEFORE commencing the Receipts for various kinds of fish, I wish to remind my readers that the greatest care is necessary in the boiling, frying, and baking of all kinds of fish. I will endeavour to point out so far as it is possible how this may be accomplished, but no hard and fast rule can be laid down either for boiling, frying, or baking, the size and thickness of the fish varying so much in the first, the heat of the lard and oven and size of the fish in the two latter, that a great deal must depend on the attention and observation of the cook. GENERAL RULES FOR BOILING FISH. That four ounces of salt should be as a general rule put into each gallon of water, but eight ounces for salmon and six for shell fish. That all fish should be put into boiling water and well covered with it, and after having boiled up put on the side and simmered only ; the cook can judge when it is done by the meat being soft at the bone. The bones must never be removed from fish when it is to be boiled. When turbot, brill, or sole are filleted, the bones should be left in. GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR FRYING. That all fish must be well dried before it is egged and crumbed or covered with flour.

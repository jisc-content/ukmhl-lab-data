THE PYTCHLEY COOKERY BOOK. 156 The above may seem an extravagant way of frying, but it is the only way to avoid having a whitebait pudding,â€™ and the lard can be kept for frying fish. WHITING, FRIED. No. 171. Skin, clean, dry and fasten the tails in the mouths of six whiting about a quarter of a pound each. Flour, paint over with egg and sprinkle with bread-crumbs very finely grated, put them in a frying basket and fry in boiling lard for five minutes ; serve on a napkin garnished with parsley with half a pint of Anchovy Butter Sauce (No. 10), or Downton Sauce (No. 32), in a sauce-boat. WHITING, BROILED. No. 172. Prepare as many whiting as are required as above, but instead of being egged and crumbed, dip them in clarified butter, pepper and salt them, put them on a gridiron and broil over a clear fire, turning them frequently; they should take about twenty minutes to broil if the fire is nice and clear. Rub a little cold butter on each, put in a hot entree dish and serve. KEDGEREE. No. 173. Boil four ounces of rice and place it in a sieve to dry, when quite dry put it in a stewpan with one pound of either cold cod, salmon, whiting, or haddock, pulled into flakes, or bloaters boned and cut into small pieces, three hard-boiled eggs cut into quarters, three ounces of butter, a dessert- spoonful of pepper and salt, a salt-spoonful of Searcy Salt; simmer over a clear fire until quite hot, sprinkle a dessert- spoonful of dry curry powder over it and serve in a very hot entree dish. The mixture must be stirred frequently with a wooden spoon, but great care must be taken in so doing not to break the fish or egg into small pieces, or the kedgeree will be spoilt.

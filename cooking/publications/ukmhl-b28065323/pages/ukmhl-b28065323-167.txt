FISH. 155 twelve minutes ; place in an entree dish, and mask with three-quarters of a pint of Parmesan Sauce (No. 60), and a little grated Parmesan sprinkled over it; lightly brown with a salamander, and serve. TURBOT AND DUTCH SAUCE. No. 16S. Fillet as Brill (No. 114), and boil sufficient for six persons; pour over in an entree dish half a pint of Dutch Sauce (No. 29). TURBOT AU GRATIN A LA CREME. No. 169. Fillet, boil as above, and cover with half a pint of Cream Bechamel Sauce (No. 13); sprinkle with browned bread- crumbs, put in the oven five minutes, and serve. WHITEBAIT; FRIED. No. 170. A quarter of an hour before required for use put a quart of whitebait into a basin of iced water, sift some flour an inch thick on a dinner napkin, take a handful of the bait out of the water and sprinkle them on the napkin, take up the napkin by the corners and pour the contents into a frying basket, shake the frying basket over the napkin so that the flour may be shaken off the fish, but it must be done carefully so as not to break them ; take out another handful of bait, put them in the flour, and pour them into another frying basket, shaking the flour off as before, repeating the process until the bait are all floured, and adding flour to the cloth if necessary; three or four frying baskets are necessary, and a handful only must be put in each basket. Put six pounds of lard in two stewpans, put the baskets, one at a time, for half a minute in one, and then for a minute in the second to finish ; let them remain in the baskets before the fire for a minute, sprinkle with salt, and serve very hot in a napkin; hand round on a plate, two lemons quartered, some cayenne and black pepper, and slices of brown bread and butter.

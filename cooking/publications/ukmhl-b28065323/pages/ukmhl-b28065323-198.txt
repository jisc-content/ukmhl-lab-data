CHAPTER VII. GAME AND POULTRY ROASTING. A GOLDEN rule to remember in the roasting of all poultry and game is that it should be juicy and succulent. This can be assured by rubbing the bird all over with lard or butter, and by then covering it with thin slices of fat bacon ; it may add a trifle to the expense, but it certainly adds greatly to the excellence, it ensures it being well basted, and it comes to the table with a moist, luscious appearance, instead of looking like a piece of an old mummy. In trimming all poultry and game the legs are greatly improved by the bone being broken just above the foot and the sinews of the leg pulled out. The pinion bones should be cut off, and pray omit the barbarous custom of ornamenting birds with feathersâ€”one begins to think the dinner is given by an Ojibbeway Indian: a few glass beads would make the decoration perfect. I am quite aware that in the close ranges now so much in use, there is some difficulty in roasting before the fire, and although a large joint may give great trouble, all game and poultry can easily be done, either in a Dutch oven, or in one of Brown & Green's double-pan roasting screens. I have one of the most difficult ranges to manage, but I never dream of allowing any meat or game or poultry to be baked. In roasting in a Dutch oven care should be taken not to put it too close to the fire as, if so, the outside dries up before the part next the bone is cooked.

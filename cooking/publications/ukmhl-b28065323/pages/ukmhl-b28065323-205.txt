CHAPTER VIII. VEGETABLES. Three or four remarks in the dressing of vegetables are necessary :—■ 1st.—Especially in a small house, prevent the horrible smell which arises from boiling greens, fumigating and stinking out your guests, by tying a piece of bread- crust in a muslin bag and keeping it in the pot during the process of boiling. 2nd.—Remember that all vegetables, excepting globe artichokes, are better dressed the day they are cut or picked. 3rd.—That all vegetables, excepting split peas, Jerusa- lem artichokes, and potatoes, are put into boiling water. 4th.—That all vegetables should be well boiled, but not too quickly; and that two ounces of salt should be put in each gallon of water, and if the water is hard, a little soda. ARTICHOKES, GLOBE, BOILED. No. 299. Well wash and soak an artichoke for each person, cut off the stalks close to the leaves, trim the top of the leaves, put in a large pot of boiling water and boil until the leaves come easily out and the bottoms are soft—old ones an hour to an hour and a half, young tender ones from half to three- quarters of an hour; drain, turning them upside down, and serve with good Melted Butter Sauce (No. 16). o

CHAPTER XII. SAVOURIES. SAVOURIES are always acceptable and useful, especially in the spring and summer months, when there is no game, and quails and Bordeaux pigeons somewhat expensive, and in the country not always to be obtained. For this reason I have endeavoured to give a strong list of dishes which I trust may prove useful and really good. Many of the Vegetable Savouries I have put amongst the Vegetables, so I must ask my readers to refer to Chapter VIII. for any they cannot find in this chapter. In servingFish Savouries avoid their being dry,especially those in which shrimps and Parmesan cheese are used ; and in savouries which are masked with Parmesan, pray be careful not to serve them as if they were baits for mouse- traps. They should be coloured, but moist; if dry, they burn and are spoilt. ANCHOVY, ECLAIR OFâ€”ECLAIR HANCHOIS. No. 492. Roll out some Pastry (No. 368) very thin ; scrape, wash, and bone a dozen fish, and enclose each anchovy neatlyi 1. the paste. Bake, and sprinkle a little grated Parmesan cheese over each, and serve very hot. ANCHOVY TOAST. No. 493. Fry some square pieces of toast, butter with Anchovy Butter (No. iS), and cover with shredded anchovy, neatly arrange, either hot or cold. r 2

262 THE PYTCHLEY COOKERY BOOK. bottle. This may seem ridiculous, but I really think if you take the trouble to lay down wine for twenty years, no trouble can be too great to produce it in its best state at the table. HOCK. Decant most carefully all fine old Hock an hour before it is required ; warming does not improve it; in fact, when good, it is meat and drink. If any one drinks “ Steinberg Cabinet,” of a good vintage, once, it is a wine never for- gotten, but it is very expensive and dificidt to get. Light Hock, however, such as Nierstein, is a very nice clean wine for dinner, and a glass or two of Geisenheim after dinner won’t hurt you in the summer. PORT. Decant most carefully. This wine requires no heat if the cellar is warm. I think it should be decanted just before dinner. I never can tell why this excellent wine is gone out of fashion. No black wine has such flavour, and, if good, it is quite as wholesome as Claret. Our forefathers lived as long, drank more, and of this very wine, port; and nowadays, you see a poor weakly-looking “ masher ” say he “cannot drink port,” when probably a bottle of old’58 a day, and fevuer il cigarettes,” would make a man of him. SHERRY. Decant carefully old Sherry, and open it the day before it is required, leave the decanter without a stopper or cork in, and you will find this method brings out and docs not destroy the flavour.

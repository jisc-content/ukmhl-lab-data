ROASTS, BOILS, AND BROILS. 185 gravy, brown it with a little colouring, and pour boiling hot into the dish in which the haunch is served, and serve with it some currant jelly warmed up in a sauce-boat. ROAST NECK OF VENISON. No. 270. This is the joint I should strongly advise for all parties under eight. It is quite sufficient, more easily dressed and hung. Roast exactly in the same way as in the directions for the haunch, only roast according to the size, about an hour and three-quarters for a moderate-sized oneâ€”the best part of the neck must only be used, and the long bones cut off to within two inches of the meat. Serve the same gravy and sauce as for a haunch. VENISON, HASHED. No. 271. Cut the slices of venison very thin. Having stewed some rough parts of the breast in some Consomme (No. 2), let it get cold, and remove all grease or fat from it; thicken three-quarters of a pint of it with one ounce of butter and a table-spoonful of flour, add a chopped pickled walnut, a small onion chopped, and a table-spoonful of melted red currant jelly; let the whole boil up and simmer for five minutes, strain, add a squeeze of lemon, and put it in a stewpan with the slices of venison, and let them stew in it for half an hour.

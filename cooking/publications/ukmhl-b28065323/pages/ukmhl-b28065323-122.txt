THE PYTCHLEY COOKERY BOOK. I IO BECHAMEL CREAM. No. 13. The same as above, only use half a pint of good cream instead of milk. Great care should be taken in stirring these sauces that the spoon goes well to the bottom and round the sides, so that it does not burn. BREAD SAUCE. No. 14. Stew a small onion and six peppercorns in half a pint of milk for twenty minutes, remove the onion and pepper- corns, and add the crumb of a penny French roll, or two ounces of bread-crumbs, an ounce of butter, and salt to taste ; let it stew for a quarter of an hour, then put it on the fire and stir with a wooden spoon until it boils; add two table-spoonfuls of good cream and serve. If you wish it to be extra good, use cream instead of milk. BUTTER SAUCE OR PLAIN MELTED BUTTER. No. 15. Put two ounces of butter in a saucepan, let it melt, then add one and a half ounces of flour, stir with a wooden spoon until quite smooth, add two-thirds of a pint of cold water and stir the whole over the fire until it thickens, add salt to taste ; an ounce more butter is a great improvement, but not necessary. BUTTER SAUCE. No. 16. To the above Butter Sauce when completed, add a spoonful of cream, the yolk of a beaten egg, and just one squeeze of lemon.

Avoid as poison all brandies and whiskies and sodas after having drank sufficient wine. These are what ruin the health of and kill thousands every year.

Deal with one wine merchant, and so make it worth his while to supply you well, and if you have a good cellar and can afford to buy the best, lay down in a good year sufficient to last you for six or seven years ; there is seldom a good vintage more frequently. Many people think Champagne does not improve by keeping. No wine improves more.

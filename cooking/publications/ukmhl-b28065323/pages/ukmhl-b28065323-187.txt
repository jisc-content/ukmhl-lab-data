CHAPTER VI. GENERAL RULES FOR ROASTS, BOILS, AND BROILS. It will only be necessary to say a very few words as a preface to this chapter. The first and most important thing to remember is, that all brown meats should not be over-cooked, but when cut should be pink near the bone ; that all white meat should be thoroughly cooked and quite white at the bone. The second to remember is, as a general rule, that a quarter of an hour is allowed per pound for roasting, and ten minutes for boiling, but that thin pieces do not require so long. The third is, that in roasting meat it should be fre- quently basted, the fat preserved as much as possible, and not be put too close to the fire ; and for heaven's sake never bake it. BEEF. ROAST SIRLOIN. No. 235. Trim about eight pounds of the middle cut of the sirloin, roast for two hours and a half, baste frequently and serve with a pint of weak brown stock or water poured over, and with Horseradish Sauce (No. 37). ROAST FILLET OF BEEF. No. 236. Trim the rump fillet nicely round about four pounds, roast it for one hour, and serve with Horseradish Sauce (No. 37).

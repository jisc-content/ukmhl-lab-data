195 VEGETABLES. ARTICHOKES, JERUSALEM, FRIED IN BATTER. No. 304. Wash, peel, and cut into shapes the size of the eighth of an orange (viz., a pig), boil in water with a table-spoonful of vinegar (added to preserve their colour) until tender, drain, dip each piece into some Frying Batter (No. 372), turn into boiling lard and fry a nice light brown, sprinkle with salt, and serve very hot with some fried parsley. ASPARAGUS WITH BUTTER SAUCE, WHIP OF BUTTER, ETC. No. 305. Scrape, wash in cold water, and cut to one length one hundred asparagus, tie them in bundles of twenty each, put them upright in a pot of boiling water as per direction No. 3 of this chapter and boil until tender (about twenty minutes), but of course the size makes a difference and they require care. The water should not come quite to the top of the grass, so that the tender tips should only steam, or they will be overdone before the stalks are tender. ASPARAGUS, COLD. No. 306. The same as above, only let them get cold and serve with Mayonnaise (No. 44) or Dutch Sauce (No. 29) cold. BEANS, BROAD. No. 307. Shell a sufficiency of young broad beans to fill an entree dish; boil them in boiling water as above for about twenty minutes (they should be quite tender), and drain ; if no other directions are given, pop them in a stewpan with two ounces of butter and a little chopped parsley and serve when hot. o 2

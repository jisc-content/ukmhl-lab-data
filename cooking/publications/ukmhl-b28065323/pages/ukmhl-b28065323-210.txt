THE PYTCHLEY COOKERY BOOK. 198 CARROTS, BOILED. No. 317. Cut off the green tops, wash, scrape, and boil in boiling water until tender (young carrots about half an hour, old ones according to size, but about two hours). CELERY, STEWED. No. 318. Remove all the green top, wash and trim off the outer leaves, boil in some Consomme (No. 2) (just sufficient to cover it) for twenty minutes or until tender, and serve it with half a pint of Brown Clear Sauce (No. 22) made the substance of half-glaze. CELERY AU GRATIN. No. 319. Stew as in Receipt No. 318, cut into shorter lengths and cover with fried bread-crumbs. CHESTNUTS, BAKED. No. 320. Cut the noses off, and cut slightly across the incision, boil for ten minutes, and bake, either in a Dutch or other oven, until quite crisp, about fifteen minutes. CHESTNUTS, BOILED AND SKINNED. No. 321. Trim as above, and boil for some time, put them in a baking tin until the skin is easily removed, break into quarters and serve hot in an entree dish, with turkey. CUCUMBER. No. 322. Peel and cut into slices about as thick as a halfpenny, season with oil and vinegar, in proportion of three table- spoonfuls of oil to a dessert-spoonful of Chili vinegar; pepper and salt just before serving.

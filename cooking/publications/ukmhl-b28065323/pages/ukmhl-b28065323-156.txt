Split and take all the meat from a fair-sized lobster, cut the meat into pieces the size of dice, mix all the coral, cream, and inside with half a pint of Downton Sauce (No. 32), adding a little cayenne pepper to it. Put this in a saucepan with the meat, make hot, and fill the body shells of three small lobsters cut in half, which should be kept for this purpose, rasp a few bread- crumbs over each shell, put a little butter on each to pre- vent the crumbs burning, and put them in a Dutch oven before the fire for five minutes, and serve. LOBSTER LN ASPLC. No. 128. Split and take all the meat out of a fair-sized lobster, and cut into pieces the size of dice, take the cream and inside and beat it with some thick Mayonnaise Sauce (No. 44). Mix the meat with the sauce and an ounce of mustard and cress. Having filled some darioles with aspic jelly, cut out the inside of each with a cutter, or obtain some darioles with lining from Adamsâ€™, in the Haymarket, and fill in with the above mixture. Rap the darioles on the table to settle the mixture, and pour in some aspic jelly as cold as possible without its being set.

SAVOURIES. 253 mixture, stirring it so that the outside may not catch and cook like a pancake before the inside is set; if in an omelet pan turn it over and serve when set, if in a frying-pan scrape it with a fork as soon as it catches into half of the pan, and when the whole is set just allow it to stand a moment to brown ; turn it on to a hot dish. An omelet to be good should be thick and soft; one generally sees it like a bad pancake. FISH OMELET. No. 537. Make the omelet in an omelet pan ; cook whatever fish is to be used either stewed in butter or boiled and mixed with butter, and when the omelet is sufficiently fried put the fish on the side nearest the handle and turn the other half over it; turn out into an entree dish, and serve with some half-glaze. HAM OMELET. No. 538. The same as Fine Herbs Omelet, only chop three ounces of lean cooked ham, stew it a few minutes in a couple of table-spoonfuls of half-glaze, fry in an omelet pan, put the ham on one side of the omelet, turn over into a dish, and serve with half a pint of Brown Sauce (No. 22). KIDNEY OMELETS. No. 539. The same as Ham, only substitute kidneys, broiled first, chopped and then stewed in Fine Herbs Sauce (No. 35), and serve with half a pint of the same sauce. CHEESE OMELETS. No. 540. Mix two ounces of Parmesan cheese in, instead of fine herbs, fry and serve as Fine Herbs Omelet (No. 536).

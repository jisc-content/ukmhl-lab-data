130 THE PYTCHLEY COOKERY BOOK. 1 CONSOMME AU RIZ. No. 92. Wash and boil one ounce of best rice in water for ten minutes, drain, and boil in three pints of Consomme (No. 1 or 2), until the rice is tender and separates. Parmesan cheese may be handed round with this soup. COD'S HEAD SOUP. No. 93. Take a large codâ€™s head, wash it well, blanch it for five or six minutes, take all the skin off, and remove the flesh from the bone and put it on a dish. Boil for half an hour a bouquet of basil and marjoram in three pints of Consomme (No. 1); add a small wine- glassful of sherry, the brown parts of the fish cut up in pieces about an inch square, and a dessert-spoonful of corn flour well mixed, boil five minutes, and serve with lemon and cayenne handed round. OX CHEEK. No. 94. Wash and soak an ox cheek in warm water until quite clean, throw the water away and put the cheek in a stew- pan with four carrots, three onions, a stick of celery, a bunch of parsley, ten peppercorns, an ounce of salt, a gallon of water; let it boil gently for four hours, take out the cheek, remove the bone, put it between two dishes with a weight on the top and let it get cold. Clarify the stock (as in No. 1), add sugar and salt to taste, cut the cheek into pieces about an inch square, the vegetables into various shapes with cutters, and put them into the soup in time to get thoroughly hot, but not to boil.

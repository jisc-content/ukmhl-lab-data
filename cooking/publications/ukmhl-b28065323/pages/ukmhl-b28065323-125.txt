Stew in some salt and water two large white sticks of celery until quite soft, take out the celery, pound it in a mortar, rub through a sieve, and add to it half a pint of White Sauce ; season to taste with salt, and if too thick add new milk or cream until it becomes a proper substance, being about that of White Sauce.

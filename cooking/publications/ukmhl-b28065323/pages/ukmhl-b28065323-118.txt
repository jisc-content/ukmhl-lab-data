THE PYTCHLEY COOKERY BOOK. io6 WHITE THICKENING. No. 5. The same proportions of butter and flour, and the same process as in No. 4, only the fire over which it is prepared must not be so hot, and great care must be taken that the mixture does not acquire any colour. This mixture is used in thickening all white stocks and sauces, and a dessert-spoonful will thicken a pint of either. COMMON GRAVY FOR POULTRY OR GAME. No. 6. Stew the trimmings, that is, the neck, gizzard, pinion bones and feet of whatever poultry or game the gravy is required for in half a pint of water, with a small onion, and two slices of carrot or a small one, a little sugar and salt, for an hour, and add half a tea-spoonful of Liebig Companyâ€™s Extract of Meat; thicken a trifle with corn flour, about half a tea-spoonful. GLAZE. No. 7. The reduction of any good stock to the substance of liquid glue, and it is arrived at by boiling until it begins to thicken ; when this commences it should simmer gently until it is thick enough for use, which is when it drops from the spoon like a thick syrup. When required for use put the basin in which it has been placed in hot water to warm. No salt should be used in stock which is to be reduced to glaze, as the reduction is great, and the salt does not reduce with the stock.

CHAPTER V. QUENELLE MEAT, ENTRIES, ETC. QUENELLE MEAT. No. 174. This preparation is made of pounded raw fish or meat, and panada, which is prepared from the essence of the meat used and butter and flour. TO PREPARE THE MEAT. Cut eight ounces of lean fish, meat, or the breasts of poultry or game, and backs of hare and rabbit, pound it in a mortar until quite smooth (for the more it is pounded the better is the quenelle). PANADA. Stew the rough parts of whatever fish, meat, poultry or game the quenelle is to be made of in a quart of water, with a sliced carrot, one onion (if white meat, six mushrooms), a dessert-spoonful of salt, until it is reduced to two-thirds ; strain; put into the stewpan two ounces of butter; melt and stir in with a wooden spoon until it becomes quite smooth two ounces and a half of flour; add a pint of the broth, stir over the fire until it thickens, and then let it simmer for an hour, when it will become a thick smooth sauce ; pour it on a soup plate and let it get quite cool. Add to the pounded meat three ounces of butter, six ounces of panada and an egg beaten up; beat the whole well together, rub through a wire and hair sieve, or one of Kentâ€™s triturating machines, and place it in the cool until it is required for use.

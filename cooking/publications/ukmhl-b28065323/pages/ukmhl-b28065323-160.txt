148 THE PYTCHLEY COOKERY BOOK over with fried bread-crumbs, put small pieces of butter on each to prevent burning, put them in the oven for five minutes, and serve. FILLET OF PERCH, FRIED. No. 138. Wash, clean, scrape off all the scales from three perch, about one pound each, split down the middle and take all the bones out, dry, flour, egg and crumb, and fry for three minutes in boiling lard. FLOUNDER SOU CHET. No. 139. Wash and trim six flounders, about a quarter of a pound each, and lay in the bottom of a stewpan. Stew three pounds of trimmings of plaice in two quarts of water, one carrot, a dessert-spoonful of salt, and a sprig or two of parsley, for one hour, until it is reduced to half. Strain this liquor into the stewpan in which you have arranged the flounders, and boil five minutes, and serve in a deep entree dish, with the stock in which they were boiled. Serve brown bread and butter with all water souchets. P.S.â€”It is not necessary to stew plaice for stock when there are any trimmings of fish to make stock, but in flounders there are no trimmings to speak of. PERCH SOUCHET. No. 140.

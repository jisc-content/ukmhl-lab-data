191 GAME AND POULTRY ROASTING. WOODPIGEON. No. 291. Clean, trim, truss, and lard as a common pigeon, and roast from twenty to twenty-five minutes. PLOVER, GOLDEN, BLACK, AND GRAY. No. 292. Trim, truss, leaving the inside in, cover with fat bacon, and roast, if in a small grate, on buttered toast in a Dutch oven before the fire ; if in a large grate, put the toast under them and roast for twenty minutes : remember that the toast should be one-third of an inch thick and well buttered ; they require no gravy. QUAIL. No. 293. Be careful in selecting quail to choose nice white birds, and unless for a large party you had better get them trussed and larded by the poulterer.

YOUNG RABBITS. No. 293A. Clean, truss, rub with butter or lard, and cover with fat bacon, two young rabbits, and roast, according to size, from twenty to thirty-five minutes, and serve either Rabbit Sauce (No. 67) in a boat, or Tarragon Sauce (No. 76) thrown over them. SNIPE. No. 294. Trim, dress, and serve exactly as a plover, only from twelve to fifteen minutes.

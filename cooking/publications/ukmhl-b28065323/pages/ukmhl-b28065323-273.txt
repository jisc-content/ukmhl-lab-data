261 WINES AND THEIR SERVICE. and although it is not necessary to decant it, I personally think it is improved thereby ; but I should certainly say if the Champagne is moderate, do not decant it, and ice it as much as possible, the fizz and the ice may disguise the taste—I won’t call it flavour. CLARET. Clarets are warmed in different ways by different people. I have seen it plunged into hot water with tiie cork in ; I have seen it arranged by dozens in a bachelor’s room so as to be ready warmed in case of sudden thirst ; and this reminds me of a story poor Whyte Melville used to tell, that on calling one day on his way home from hunting on a gallant officer hunting with the Pytchley, he saw a dozen of Claret warming before the fire, when he remarked, “Got a dinner party?” “Oh, no, only the Colonel and myself.” Others put it before the fire and then into a cold decanter, and the sudden change from hot to cold chills and quite spoils the wine. I know no wine so difficult to produce at a right temperature, and I am quite convinced that the only way to produce all bottles alike is to put the decanters and claret in a temperature of 60 degrees for ten hours before dinner and decant each bottle when it is wanted, observing most carefully the rules laid down for decanting. I have heard that when old Claret has been moved it does not recover itself until after the second flowering of the grape ; that is, if it is moved in August it takes two years to recover, and I really think this is true. I remember perfectly a friend of mine buying some Claret in Paris, and he thought he had been swindled as it tasted so different after having rested six months ; but he kept some for two years, and it quite regained its excellence. 1 also remember having heard that a certain connoisseur had a closet made, warmed to a temperature of 60 degrees, on purpose for his Claret, and each decanter was encased in flannel so as to retain the heat, and he had a silver thermometer to try each

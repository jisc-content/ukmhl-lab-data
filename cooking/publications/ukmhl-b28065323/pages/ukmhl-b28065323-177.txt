QUENELLE MEAT, ENTREES, ETC. 165 catch up the liquor and curry powder ; put in the dish, and hand round some boiled rice, just sauted with a trifle of butter, so as not to be wet, sprinkled with dry curry powder. FILLET OF DUCKLING A DO RANGE. No. 197. Roast before a quick fire a fat duckling, so that the outside may be nicely brown and the inside slightly under- done ; let it get cold, cut it into six nice fillets, stew the carcase in a pint of Consomme (No. 1) until it is reduced to half and somewhat thick; let it get cold, and take off all the fat; warm it up, and squeeze the juice of three sweet oranges into it, and the rind of one very thinly peeled and shredded. The sauce should be the substance of half-glaze, and sweet, and if the oranges are sour sugar must be added, and if the sauce is thin it must be thickened at the last moment with a little arrowroot. Put the fillets of duckling in the sauce, and stew for ten minutes. Serve in an entree dish, with a fried crouton of toast under each fillet. FILLET OF DUCKLING WITH OLIVES. No. 198. Cook, cut up, and serve in the same way as in the above receipt, only instead of putting oranges in the sauce, put a dozen olives with the stones taken out, and a sprinkling of Searcy Salt. QUENELLE MEAT OF HARE. No. 199. Cut all the meat off a hareâ€™s back and the best part of the legs, and stew the carcase for stock ; and having gone through the process as directed for Quenelle Meat (No. 174), put it in a cool place. It will be sufficient to make an entree for six people for three nights.

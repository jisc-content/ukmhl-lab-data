104 THE PYTCHLEY COOKERY BOOK. extracted), six carrots well washed, scraped and divided lengthways into four parts, two onions quartered, two turnips cut in halves, two small sticks of celery, a dessert-spoonful of sugar and one and a half of salt, add one gallon of water. Put all the ingredients into a stockpot or large stewpan, boil up briskly, and then place on the side of the fire to simmer gently for six hours. Remove the scum as it rises, and after the stock has been on the fire for six hours, strain through a colander into a large basin so as to clear the stock from all meat and vegetables. Then run it again through a tammy cloth to clear it of all small remnants of meat or vegetables which may have been left after the former process, and put it into basins to become cold. When quite cold and required for use, remove the fat, which will have risen to the top, with a wooden spoon; but, as some particles of fat are sure to be left which cannot be taken off with the spoon, wipe the surface of the jelly Avith a clean cloth, which has previously been dipped into warm water and wrung nearly dry. If the stock is not quite clear it should be clarified as follows : Pass two pounds of lean beef, or any other meat of which the stock has been made, through one of Lovelock’s sausage machines, put it in a stewpan, and having warmed the stock, mix it by degrees, a pint at a time, with the meat with a wooden spoon, put it on the fire and stir it until it boils ; then put it on the side of the fire and let it simmer for an hour, add a carrot, onion, and stick of celery all sliced and let it boil, strain through a wet cloth—it should be put in the cloth a pint at a time, and when the last pint is put in, the four corners of the cloth should be pinned together and suspended over a basin until all that is clear has run through. This is the process of clarification for all stocks and soups, as the egg clarification makes them taste thin.

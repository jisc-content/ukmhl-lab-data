THE PYTCHLEY COOKERY BOOK. 4 had a mass of half-raw cod or salmon doled out, instead of helping oneself to a neat fillet ? He draws attention to a class of entree which is seldom seen on the tables of people of moderate means, and which, if it does appear, resembles dry potted meat instead of a creamy, excellent entree. The entree he alludes to is made of Quenelle Meat. It is the most refined and delicate of all entrees, can be made of veal and almost any game, and can be served poached and fried in various forms. The Author gives the receipt of a Frenchman who was celebrated for the softness and excellence of this class of entree. He impresses on his readers that nothing is in worse taste than too much; he has endeavoured to avoid this in the compilation of his “ Bills of Fare,” and to select the newest and most wholesome Receipts. It was his intention to have had “Bills of Fare” on one page, and directions for cooking the various dishes opposite, so that any master or mistress could have said to the cook, “That Bill of Fare and carried out by those directions I will have to-day,” but he found it quite impossible, as the repetition would have been endless.

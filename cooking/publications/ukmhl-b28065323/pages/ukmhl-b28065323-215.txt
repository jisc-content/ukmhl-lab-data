203 VEGETABLES. ANOTHER POTATO SOUFFLE. No. 341. Wash and peel and cut in thin slices a dozen moderate- sized potatoes all the same shape and size, wash and dry the chips, put some clarified melted butter in a soup plate and immerse each chip in it, arrange them on an oval baking tin in circular rows, one on top of another, gradually narrowing each row towards the centre until they form a spiral shape, add pepper and salt to each row; bake in a very hot oven until the centre melts and the outside presents a nice light brown appearance; this is quite excellent. POTATOES, NEW, TO BOIL. No. 342. Wash and rub with a rough cloth to take off the skins, and put into boiling water as many fresh new potatoes as are required ; boil them about a quarter of an hour, and when done drain off the water and let them remain in the pan by the side of the fire with the lid on for about a minute: when dry put them in an entrde dish, sprinkle with salt, and put some small pieces of butter on the top of them. RADISHES. No. 343. Wash, cut off the top part of the greens, scrape, and serve in a plate with a little water. SALSIFY. No. 344. Sciape and cut into lengths of about three inches, and put them into a basin of cold water with a little vinegar in it to preserve their colour; put into boiling water and boil until tender, which will be from thirty-five to fifty minutes, according to the size, flavour with salt, drain and serve in an entree dish and pour over it half a pint of White Sauce (No. 77).

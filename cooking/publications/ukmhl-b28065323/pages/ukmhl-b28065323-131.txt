119 SAUCES. purÂ£e of mint. No. 48A. Chop some mint finer than in the preceding receipt, and double the quantity. Add sufficient sugar to sweeten it and vinegar to make it a thick sauce. Beat it through a wire and hair sieve, warm it, and serve with lamb cutlets. MINT JELLY FOR MASKING CUTLETS. No. 49. If required for masking cutlets, to two table-spoonfuls of Espagnole Sauce (No. 35), add one table-spoonful of Aspic Jelly (No. 8), and one table-spoonful of Mint Sauce (No. 48). MUSHROOM SAUCE, WHITE. No. 50. Clean, peel, and remove the stalks from half a pint of button mushrooms, stew in half a pint of White Sauce (No. 77). When soft take them out, pound in a mortar, rub through a wire or hair sieve, and add to the purde sufficient White Sauce in which they were stewed to make it the substance of very thick cream, and pepper and salt to taste, and the juice of half a lemon. I think Searcy Salt is preferable to black pepper and salt. MUSHROOM SAUCE, BROWN. No. 51. The same as above, only the mushrooms need not be button ones, and Brown Sauce (No. 22) should be substituted for White Sauce (No. 77).

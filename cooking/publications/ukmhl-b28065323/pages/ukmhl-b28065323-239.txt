SWEET DISHES. 227 ICES. My only remark on the making of ice is that it should be quite smooth and not too much frozen. I do not think you ever get ice better than at Gunterâ€™s shop, where it is taken out of the freezing-pot and put into no shapes. It must be somewhat over-frozen to retain the shape, so unless you have a very good cook, I should strongly advise that all ices should be taken out of the freezing-pot just before they are sent to table and put into a glass dish in spoonfuls as they are taken out. Ice should be quite smooth, and soft enough to cut with a spoon. APRICOT CREAM ICE. No. 426. Peel, split, extract the stones of twelve apricots, put them in a stewpan with six ounces of pounded sugar and half a pint of water, stir this mixture on the fire until entirely dissolved and pass through a white hair sieve, add a pint of cream and freeze. APPLE CREAM ICE. No. 427. The same process. BARBERRY CREAM ICE. No. 428. The same process. BROWN BREAD ICE. No. 429. Mix eight ounces of stale brown bread-crumbs with a pint of whipped cream, sweeten with six ounces of pounded white sugar, flavour with three or four drops of essence of vanilla and freeze.

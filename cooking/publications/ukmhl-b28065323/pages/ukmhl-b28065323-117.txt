STOCKS, ETC. i°5 THE AUTHOR’S CHEAP CONSOMM&. No. 2. To four carrots well scraped, washed, and divided into four parts, two onions quartered, one turnip cut in half, small bit of celery, one dessert-spoonful of sugar, ditto of salt, add two quarts of water. Put all the ingredients into a stewpan, boil up briskly, and put on the side of the fire to simmer until the vegetables are soft; add one dessert-spoonful of Liebig Company’s Extract of Meat, let it simmer for half an hour longer, and strain through a fine colander into a basin. WHITE STOCK. No. 3. The same proportion of everything, excepting the sugar, as in the receipt for Brown Stock (No. 1), only substituting veal or knuckle of veal for beef. The same processes of boiling, straining, clearing of all* fat and grease, and, if necessary, of clarification must be gone through. N.B.—The advantage of putting stock into several basins is that if not required for immediate use, it keeps much better with the fat on. BROWN THICKENING. No. 4. Put half a pound of butter clarified (that is, cleared of all milk) into a stewpan, dissolve it, and stir in with a wooden spoon half a pound of flour until quite smooth, put it on the fire and let it simmer, stirring all the time for an hour or until it becomes a nice brown colour, when put it in a basin for use. It depends greatly on the heat of the fire how long it is before it is a nice brown ; great care must be taken not to let it burn. A dessert-spoonful will thicken a pint of gravy.

131 CLEAR SOUPS. OX TAIL. No. 95. Wash and soak in two quarts of cold water two ox tails for one hour, take them out and cut them in lengths of one inch.

Put the tail and cut vegetables in the soup, boil up and serve, and add salt and sugar to taste. TURTLE SOUP. No. 96. In selecting the dried turtle, be careful to pick the thickest pieces.

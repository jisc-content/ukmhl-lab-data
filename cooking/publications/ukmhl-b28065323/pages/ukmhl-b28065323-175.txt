163 QUENELLE MEAT, ENTREES, ETC. (No. 73), a table-spoonful of chopped parsley and chervil, a dessert-spoonful of chives and sugar, a tea-spoonful of shalot, or a small bottle of Bequinotâ€™s Fine Herbs Sauce and a little salt; stew the whole very gently for half an hour, serve in an entree dish, pouring the sauce over the fillets. Let me impress on my readers that all poultry and game used in these Entrees should be young and tender. SAUTE OF CHICKEN AUX CHAMPIGNONS. No. 190. The same as above, only add instead of the herbs half a pint of button mushrooms. SAUTE OF CHICKEN A LA MARENGO. No. 191. The same as Saute aux Fine Herbs (No. 189), only add a square of fried toast, on which place a poached egg for each person. The eggs should be fried with the sippets in oil or butter, to which should be added some chopped herbs. SAUTE OF CHICKEN AUX TRUFFES. No. 192. The same as Saute aux Fine Herbs, only substitute for the herbs three table-spoonfuls of sliced or chopped truffles. CHICKEN A LA TARTAR. No. 193. billet a roast or braised chicken into six nice fillets, and put them between two dishes, with a weight on top of the uppermost, until cold ; dip each fillet into some Frying Batter (No. 371), and fry a nice light brown. Serve in an entree dish, and hand round with it half a pint of Sauce Tartar (No. 74) in a sauce-boat. m 2

THE PYTCHLEY COOKERY BOOK. 120 MUSTARD SAUCE. No. 52. To half a pint of Butter Sauce (No. 15) add a dessert- spoonful of Keen’s best mustard mixed, and a tea-spoonful of Anchovy Sauce (Burgess & Son’s). MUSTARD SAUCE. No. 52A. Mustard is frequently so badly made that I think I cannot do better than give Messrs. Keen’s directions for making up their mustard, which are: That the water with which it is made should be first boiled and allowed to get nearly cold ; that the quantity of mustard required should be put in a cup, and at first a very little water only be put to it and be thoroughly incorporated before any more is added; water should then be added by degrees and well worked in until it becomes the substance of custard. NORVEGIENNE SAUCE. No. 53. To about half a pint of Mayonnaise Sauce (No. 44), omitting the capers, add two table-spoonfuls of finely- grated horseradish. SAUCE A LA NORMANDE, BROWN. No. 54. To half a pint of Brown Sauce (No. 22) add one dozen button mushrooms sliced in half, one dozen oysters with beards removed, one dozen crayfish if to be had, or one gill of picked shrimps chopped small, one table-spoonful of Anchovy Sauce, and Searcy Salt to taste.

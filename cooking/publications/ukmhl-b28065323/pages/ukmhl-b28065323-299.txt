Vesalius Pettigrew, M.D. “ I have no hesitation in stating that I have never met with any medicine so efficacious as an Anti-Spasmodic and Sedative. I have used it in Consumption, Asthma, Diarrhoea, and other diseases, and am perfectly satisfied with the results.” CAUTION—BEWARE OF PIRACY AND IMITATIONS. Caution.—“Vice-Chancellor Sir W. Page Wood stated that Dr. J. Collis Browne was undoubtedly the inventor of Chlorodyne, that the story of the defendant, Freeman, was deliberately untrue, which he regretted to say had been sworn to."—See Times, July 13, 1864.

STOCKS, ETC. 107 ASPIC JELLY. No. 8. Having broken into smallish pieces three pounds of shin of beef (the marrow being extracted), four calvesâ€™ feet, four pounds of knuckle of veal, wash them well and put them in a stewpan with three carrots, two onions, a bunch of parsley, and a gallon of water, boil it up and place it on the side of the fire to simmer until reduced to half, skimming the fat off it from time to time. Take it off the fire and let it stand for some minutes, when strain it first through a colander and then through a dinner napkin or rubber, and let it get cold ; when cold remove all fat and grease as in Stock (No. 1), and if necessary clarify by the following process: Whisk the whites of two eggs in a pint of water, warm up the jelly and pour it into it, stirring it well in, allow it to boil a quarter of an hour, and strain it through a jelly-bag. When it is clear, warm it up, and flavour with two or three sprays of green tarragon, and the juice of three or four lemons.

INTRODUCTION TO BILLS OF FARE. TWELVE FOR EACH MONTH. The Bills of Fare have been arranged with some care, and but few words in explanation will be necessary. Repetitions and omissions doubtless occur, but the Author thinks it better to make frequent use of those things which are in season, and readily obtained at a reasonable price, than to recommend dishes, easily written down, but con- taining articles difficult to procure and expensive. The Author again prefers, in which he hopes that his readers will agree, a good dish twice, or three times a month, to a moderate dish simply for a change. Some may think Game is too frequently entered, but if it is not to be had, one of the Savoury Receipts, or Dressed Vegetables can easily be substituted. Quails or Bordeaux pigeons may be thought expensive, but they are not really so—a Bordeaux pigeon is quite sufficient for two people. Messrs. Bellamy Bros., of Jermyn Street, will supply good fat birds from March to August at is. 6d. and is. 9d. each. Vegetables have not been entered in the “ Bills of Fare,” as the Author considers that the cook will be much better able to select each morning what are ready for use, than he possibly could, climates and seasons making so great a difference. One Entree only has been entered in each “ Bill of Fare.” Unless there is a large party, the Author considers one quite sufficient; if two are required, it is easy to insert a Cutlet or a substantial Entree, when a Quenelle, Rissolette, Friantine, or Croquet is the one selected, and vice versa a Friantine, Quenelle, Rissolette, or Fish Entree, when the Entffie is a substantial one.

ON COMFITS. 189 326. Hose Almond Comfits. You use water distilled from the Flowers, adding it to the sugar whilst clarifying it. Make them as the preceding (No. 325). Put a little liquid car- mine into the syrup you use for charges on the tldrd day; this is to give the Comfits the required colour. The first charge on the tldrd day should have a little liquid gum in it. Lessen the quan- tity of syrup used in the charges each time, in order that the last charge may consist of only a very small quantity of the syrup. As advised in the last paragraph of the preceding Recipe (No. 325), the Comfits should only be heated to the tempera- ture of the sun in a moderately warm day. Any greater heat would spoil their whiteness. Add no carmine to the syrup on the fourth day. Proceed exactly as for Almond Comfits (No. 325). 327. Pistachio Comfits Are made the same as Almond Comfits (No. 325). Select fine, green Pistachios. Dry them in the stove. It is usual to stop up the cavity in the end of the Pistachio kernels with sugar. Sift some fine sugar through a lawn sieve ; and during the first three charges powder the nuts with it. This is to fill up any cavities, and prevent them from ad- hering to each other, and forming into lumps.

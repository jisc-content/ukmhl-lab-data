CHAPTER IV. SYRUPS. 14. General Directions for Syrups. The best Syrups can only be made with the finer qualities of sugar. Syrup is the juice of fruit, flowers, vegetables, or whatever you desire to pre- serve, mixed with liquid sugar. In boiling to the degrees, it is from the "Small Thread'^ to the " Large Pearl" that Syrup is produced. The essences or virtues of most fruits, &c., suitable for Syrup-making may be extracted by simple in- fusion. The sugar should be dissolved in this decoction or infusion, and both placed in a glass or earthenware vessel. Close this vessel down, and place it in a pan on the fire surrounded with water. In some cases the Syrup should not be bottled until quite cold. When ready, cork it securely, and stand it in a cool, dry place. Care should be taken to boil the Syrup to the precise point. If not sufficiently boiled, after a time it is apt to become mouldy, and if boiled too much, it will grain a little, and thus become candied. Sauce-

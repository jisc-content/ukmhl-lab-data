COOLING DRINKS. 83 126. Strawberry Water Is made the same as Currant Water (No. 125). 127. Cherryade. Pound three pounds of Morello Cherries in a mortar, put them in a pan (one made of copper lined with tin); add the juice of three lemons, two quarts of water, one pint of syrup, the whites of five eggs, and a little cochineal. Mix well together, put on the fire, and let it boil; then pass through a flannel bag till clear; ice it, and serve fresh. The stones may be pounded with the Cherries, as their kernels impart a pleasant flavour. 128. Lemonade. Pare off very thinly the outer rind of three Lemons into one quart of syrup; then add one pint of Lemon-juice, and two quarts of water. These proportions will generally give satisfaction, but a little more or less of either the syrup or Lemon-juice may be added. Mix well together, and pass through a lawn sieve; then ice it, and serve. 129. Orangeade. This is made as lemonade. Select good fruit; those known as China Oranges are well adapted for making this agreeable beverage. G 2

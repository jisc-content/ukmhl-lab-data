The next day, take them out, and brush or blow off all the powder. If for fruit, colour some iceing green (see Chapter XXV., On Iceing, No. 354), with vegetable colour (see Chapter XVIII., On Colours, No. 295), and pipe the leaves on. The stalk should be coloured brown. The fruit should be made of Fondant (see the following, No. 277); tinge it with the proper shade or colour, then fasten it on. After this they should be crys- tallized. (See Chapter XIX., On Crystallization, No. 297.) 277. Fondant.

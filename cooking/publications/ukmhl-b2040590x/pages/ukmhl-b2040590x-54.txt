28 THE MODERN CONFECTIONER. 21. Barberry Syrup. The method of making this is precisely the same as that for making Morello Cherry Syrup. (See No. 18). 22. Capillaire (or Maidenhair) Syrup. 4 oz. Capillaire, 4 J lbs. Sugar. The best Capillaire comes from America, where it grows near ponds or running streams. Another kind comes from Italy and France. The English plant, however, is often sold for Italian or American. The leaves are green, and grow double, the stalk long, and of the colour of ripe plums. Be careful to obtain the genuine sort, whether foreign or native, which ever kind you require. Cut the Capillaire into little pieces, then infuse them in boiling water, covering the pan over. Add the sugar, and clarify with the whites of four eggs, if you are mixing in the above proportion. Boil to a " Pearl," then pour off through a strainer. When cool, add some orange-flower water, then bottle close. Ordinary Syrup, with tincture of orange-flower in it, is often sold for the genuine article. 23. Lemon Syrup. 2 lbs. Sugar (or 2 pints of Syrup), 1 pint Lemon juice. Let the juice settle, clear off the thin skin which forms on the top, then strain through a fine sieve

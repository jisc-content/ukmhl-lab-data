The sugar and water being put in the boiler, which should be supplied with a cover, the gas is lighted underneath, and regulated according to the requirements of the syrup. When finished, the clarified sugar may be drawn off through the tap or cock. A strainer, or another pan, may be placed underneath to receive the syrup.—See Figure 4, Plate 11. The great value of this Gas Stove consists in the extremely simple yet effectual method of in- creasing or lessening the heat, according to the requirements of the syrup being made. A turn of the tap either increases the heat to the extent of a blazing fire, or lessens it to a gentle simmer, or even a lukewarm point.

This will be found extremely serviceable in making small liqueur drops. The process is tedious, but other- wise satisfactory. When a small drop of the syrup has fallen, turn the screw down into the hole ; shiffc your paper, raise the screw, and let another drop fall. The paper may be stretched on a frame, as shown in the illustration.—Plate I. Figure 3.—Tin Funnel, for laying out Savoy Biscuits and Drops.—Plate L

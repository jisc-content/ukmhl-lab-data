ON CREAM AND OTHER ICES. 91 unknown, except in large establishments. They are generally built in the ground, although some- times they are erected above. When built under- ground, the Ice-house consists of a well or tank decreasing in diameter as it gets deeper. The object of this is to keep the Ice compact together, as it gradually melts and sinks. Select a spot with a northerly aspect, and with a soil either gravel or chalk, where the Ice-house will be re- moved from the sun, and drain itself through the soil, into either a small drain or a waste cistern underneath. If the waste water passes off through a drain, see that no warm air passes up through it, and melts the Ice. A trap or other contrivance must stop the mouth. Build the Ice-house of perforated bricks, the walls from fourteen (two bricks) to eighteen inches in thickness. The out- side should have a good coat of Roman cement, to prevent any earth-water from soaking in. The top should be arched over, with a hole for the Ice to go in at. At the top of one side have another aper- ture from whence you can take the Ice as you require it. As a general rule, this hole will serve the double purpose of entry and departure for the Ice. The entrance to the hole should be by a slanting passage, or by a few steps on the sides, if it is a perpendicular well. Cover the hole with a big stone, and from the stone to the surface, or open air, fill in with straw. Over the arched roof

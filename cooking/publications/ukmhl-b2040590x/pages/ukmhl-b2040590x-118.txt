THE MODERN CONFECTIONER. 84 130. Baspberry Water Is made the same as Currant Water (No. 125). 131. Orgeat Water. Take half a pound of sweet Almonds and one ounce of bitter; drop them into boiling water to blanch them; pound them very fine in a mortar, then put them in a quart of water. When pound- ing, add a very small quantity of water, to keep the Almonds from oiling. Now add sugar, and as much orange-flower water as will please the taste. Mix then thoroughly together; filter through a fine sieve, ice, and it is ready to serve up. (See Orgeat Syrup, No. 17, from which it is sometimes made.) 132. Iced Coffee. This is made in the same manner as ordinary breakfast Coffee, only with a little cream added to it. Put in a freezing-pot, with rough ice around it, but no salt.

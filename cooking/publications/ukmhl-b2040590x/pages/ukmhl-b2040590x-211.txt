ON CANDY AND LIQUEURS. 167 287. Barberry Drops. 6 oz. Barberries, li lb. Sugar. Press the juice out of the Barberries^ and mix it into the pounded sugar. Should the juice not moisten the sugar sufficiently, add a little clear water. Make no more paste than you can actually use, as the second time it is heated it becomes greasy, and difficult to drop. 288. Pine-Apple Drops. Take the Pine and rub the rind on a piece of rough loaf sugar. The sugar thus impregnated you scrape off for use directly. Pound the Pine, and pass the pulp or juice through a fine hair sieve; add the sugar just scraped off, and as much more as you think it requires to make it sweet. Make it into a paste with clear water. Every precaution must be used, as it soon greases. No more should be made than you actually want for immediate use. 289. Peppermint Drops. Moisten the sugar, which should be white, and of the finest quality, with Peppermint-water; or fla- vour it with the essence of Peppermint, and moisten it with a little clear water. See that your utensils are perfectly clean.

THE MODERN CONFECTIONER. 44 53. Chesnuts. The outside skins of the Chesnuts must be taken off. Rinse them well in cold water, then put them into another pan of cold water on the fire to blanch or scald them. The inner or thin yellow skin, may now easily be taken off. Have a pan ready with some ver}^ weak syrup (containing not more than half or one-third of the ordinary quan- tity of sugar), and into this drop your cleaned Chesnuts. The pan should not be on the fire, only by the side, where the Chesnuts and syrup can simmer for several hours, slightly covered over, so as to exclude dust or dirt. See that the syrup is not allowed to boil; and as the liquid dries up, add occasionally a trifle more syrup. With this gentle simmering the syrup will gradually thicken, which it should do^ otherwise it would quickly get mouldy and be useless. After heating for i\YO days in this manner, the Chesnuts will be fit to take out. Drain them. Boil some syrup to a Blow " in a small ]Dan, and just before it is quite cold, stir or work it against the inside edges of the pan with a proper spaddle. In a little time it will have a beautiful gloss. Into this dip your Chesnuts, now drained quite dry ; take them out and drain on a wire. After this, dry in a stove for two or three minutes.

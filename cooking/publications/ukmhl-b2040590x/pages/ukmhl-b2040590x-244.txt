196 THE MODERN CONFECTIONEE. 336. STonpareils. Use the large shallow pan with hot coals under- neath. Take a few ounces (according to the quantity of Nonpareils you desire to make) of Florence orris-root; pound it v/ell in your mortar, then sift it and put it into the pan. Take a very small quantity of syrup which has been boiled to the " Pearl" and mix it with the orris-root pow- der, so as to form a thick paste. Then roll it into little grains, or tiny balls. Now commence charging with syrup, gradual at first, until a coating of sugar is formed. In the making of Nonpareils you must be provided with sieves of various sizes. Sift often, so as to free them from sugar-dust and any imperfectly formed comfits. As in the case of other comfits, you dry these in the stove after completing the series of charges. The second and following days you proceed with them the same as for other comfits. 337. To Colour IMonpareils, or Comfits. Put the Nonpareils into the Comfit pan, shake or rub them about until warm, then add a sufficient quantity of prepared liquid colour (see No. 295, Colours), to give the desired tint; be careful not to make them too wet, nor of too dark a colour, but rather light than otherwise; shake or rub them

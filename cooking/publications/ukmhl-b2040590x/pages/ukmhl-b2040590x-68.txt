40 THE MODEKN CONFECTIONER. Kipe Apricots. The syrup, boiled to the " Small Thread," must be poured over the fruit in the earthenware pan. Some confectioners divide the Peaches before preserving. 45. White Pears, Wet. Called white, to distinguish them from the red. Select fine large Pears, either those known as " eating'^ or " baking but the " eating" Pears must not be over ripe. The Pears should be tender, sweet, and fine-flavoured, and the pips will generally be black—a sign of perfect but not over-ripeness. Prick them over, and blanch them soft; some add a little alum. Then drop them into cold water. Pare off the rind very thin, prick to the core with a bodkin, and drop them into another pan of cold water. Now put the pan on the fire again until the fruit is thoroughly scalded or blanched, and can easily be run through with your bodkin or pin-head. Once more put them into cold water, drain them from this, and put them into a thin syrup boiled to the " Small Thread." Boil up two or three times in this, take any scum off that may rise when the pan is off the fire ; then put them, with the syrup, into an earthen pan. Next day, drain off the syrup, add fresh syrup to this, and boil one degree more—viz., to the " Large Thread.''

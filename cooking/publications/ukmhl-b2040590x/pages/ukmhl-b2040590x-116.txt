CHAPTER XII. COOLING DRINKS. 124. On Cooling Drinks for Balls, &c. As Mr. Gunter remarks, they " are a sort of half ice, formed of the juices of mashed fruits, com- bined with syrup and water, and cooled down (after being strained) in the freezing pot." Below, I give directions for making the most fashionable, agreeable, and wholesome cooling drinks. They are highly esteemed at routs and balls. 125. Currant Water. Pick four pounds of fresh red Currants, mash them in a pan with three quarts of water, then add one pint of syrup, and a little cochineal. Mix w^ell together, and pass through a flannel bag three or four times ; then ice it, and it is ready for use. Some add a little water to the juice before straining, and then give it a boil, and pass, as before, through a flannel bag, adding a little lemon-juice to give it a palatable flavour.

CHxVPTER XVII. ON CANDY AND LIQUEUKS. 263. Candy, or Crystallized Sugar. The articles described in this Chapter are made by boiling sugar to the "Feather" and Ball/' and grained by rubbing it against the sides of the pan. Provide a round mould (Fig. 11, Plate TV,), smaller at the bottom than the top, of whatever size you may- think proper, made either of tin or copper, with holes pierced round the sides about three inches asunder, so as to fasten strings across in regular rows from the top to the bottom^ leaving sufficient room for the sugar to crystallize on each string without touching, or it will form a complete mass ; paste paper round the outside to prevent the syrup from running through the holes. Prepare the mould, and see that it is clean and dry. Take sufficient clarified S37rup to fill the mould, and boil it to the degree of crystallization, or the " Feather," and add a little spirit of wine; remove it from the fire, and let it rest until a thin skin is formed on the surface.

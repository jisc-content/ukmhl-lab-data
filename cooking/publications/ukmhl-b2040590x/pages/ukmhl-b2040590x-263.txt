ON GUM PASTE. 213 leaves you must roll out the paste of a red colour extremely thin; then take the cutter and stamp them carefully out. Now take them in your hand one at a time and model them out with the tool as at Figure 26, Plate VI. Roll or work them out thin, and try to imitate the natural leaf; then fix them around the yellow petals you have just made. Cut a small quantity of saffron very fine, and damp it with gum, to represent the seeds in the centre. The heart made, and the leaves fixed on, now ,push the flower into the engraved wooden die. For any finishing touches, imitate nature as closely as you possibly can. The leaves of different flowers will require the cutters of various -shapes. (See Figureie, Plate V.)

EGGS 251 Omelets can also be compounded with prawns, shrimps or oysters, all of which should be parboiled and then dressed with a little white sauce, and the ragout thus prepared should be served either within or round the omelet. The following is my formula for preparing oysters either for the above purpose, or to put into small bread croustades : Parboil a quantity of oysters in their own liquor, remove the beards, cut each oyster into four or six pieces. Melt a piece of butter in a saucepan, add to it a pinch of flour, the liquor of the oysters, a’ little cream, salt, pepper, nutmeg, the least bit of cayenne, and some finely minced parsley. Put in the oysters and toss them in this sauce just long enough to make them quite hot. Stir into them (off the fire) the yolk of an egg beaten up with the juice of half a lemon and strained. With the remains of fish—of salmon or trout especially, from the previous day’s dinner—a very neat omelet can be produced in the fashion following: Beat up three fresh eggs with a quantity equal to an egg in bulk of the flesh of boiled salmon shredded fine with a fork, a pinch of minced parsley, pepper, salt, and half a dozen bits of butter the size of a pea. Cooked according to art this mixture will produce a noble omelet. To conclude this matter of omelets I will give a modified formula of the celebrated Omelette au Thon, which graced the table of Brillat-Savarin’s curd. I say modified, because fresh tunny fish, which is occa- sionally procurable in Paris, is not, I believe, to bo had in London. Get some tunny fish preserved in oil, and mince half a slice of it very finely; do the same to a couple of fresh soft roes of carp previously parboiled ; rub a frying-pan with a piece of shallot; put into

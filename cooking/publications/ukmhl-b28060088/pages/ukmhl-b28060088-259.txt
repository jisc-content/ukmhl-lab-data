243 FABINACEOUS FOOD. rose are too "beautiful to be rejected in cookery because they are used in perfumery. The British form of rice pudding is very excellent for young children I have no doubt •, but for such as know how to eat, this is how a bice pudding should be made. Having boiled your rice in milk with plenty of sugar and the thin outer rind of two lemons, pour it into a basin to cool, and when cold stir into it several eggs; add a small quantity of candied citron cut up small, and pour the whole into a mould previously buttered and bread- crumbed. Bake half an hour and serve. This is very good cold, and may be served with custard or jam as a sauce. Rice so prepared can be used as a border for stewed fruit, as can also rice plainly boiled in milk or in water. Or again, the border may be made of a bouillie (porridge) of ground rice and milk ; and this latter is as pleasant an adjunct to a dish of stewed fruit as any I know of.

Make a custard with a gill of milk and the yolks of four eggs; when cold mix it with the rice. Beat up into a froth a gill of cream with some sugar and a pinch of isinglass dissolved in a little water ; mix this very lightly with the rice and custard. Rill a mould with the mixture and set it on ice; when sufficiently iced, turn it out and serve with any cold jam sauce or a salad of fruit—such as strawberries—round it. This latter is simply the fruit freed from stalks and tossed in plenty of powdered loaf sugar and a small quantity of pale brandy. B 2

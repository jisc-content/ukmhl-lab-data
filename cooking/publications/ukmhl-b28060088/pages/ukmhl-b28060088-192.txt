BOUND THE TABLE. 17G greenmeat (and rightly, too, only they do not know how to preserve it) should in some cases, by their very plain boiling, all but destroy the flavour so much prized. It is the universal custom in England to slice or cut into fillets both French beans, and scarlet runners, before cooking them. The result of such an operation is, that half the flavour goes to the water; and it is but natural that many people should say, as they do, that such vegetables have not much taste of their own, and are hardly worth eating. If they will take my advice, and boil beans and runners whole, they will come to a very different conclusion, and find out that beans have a flavour of their own, and a strong one, too. Runners and beans cannot be too young; directly the bean proper begins to form, and they have what is called a thread, they are too old. There is, however, some difficulty in procuring at London shops beans of the proper age; but, like many other luxuries, this can always be secured by giving a little more money for the beans, which in that case the greengrocer will pick out for you, although he may have a strong objection to doing so. The fortunate possessors of kitchen gardens, however, can easily exer- cise the power of selection themselves. Having secured beans of the right size, and nipped off the ends of each, you must boil them in plenty of water with a due quantity of salt and soda; and, like all other fresh vegetables to be boiled in water, they should not be thrown in until the water is boiling fast. In France, to preserve the green colour of the beans, they tie up in a piece of cloth a small quantity of wood ashes as washerwomen tie up their blue or indigo, aud put it into the saucepan while the water is getting up to boiling point; but I find soda answers quite as well, and with less trouble. The beaus should be thrown into cold

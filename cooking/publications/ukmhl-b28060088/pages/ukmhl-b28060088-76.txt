Let your sauce give a boil or two, add any condiment according to taste, and the sauce is made. Truffles or mushrooms, or both, may be added with advantage in the first part of the process. The addition of the juice of a lemon, and a glass of white wine, at the second stage of the proceedings, will produce what is called Mirepoix, a very good sauce for all hashes or fricassees of pigeons, fowls, ducks, and birds in general. White Sauce or Veloute, is made much in the same way as Espagnole, only, as it is a white sauce, all ingre- dients tending to give it a colour, such as sue colorant, should be excluded, and in the first part of the process the meat and vegetables should not be browned at all; also in making the roux the flour should not be allowed to brown, and mushrooms, at least, are de rigueur for this sauce. By stirring into your veloute two or three yolks of eggs beaten up with a little hot water, and adding a pat of butter, with a little finely-powdered nutmeg, you will have a Sauce Allemande. Sauce Supreme is nothing else (according to no less an authority than Careme) but some sauce Allemande, to which, at the moment of serving, a pat of fresh butter and a couple of tablespoonfuls of consomme, or clear gravy or stock have been added. The Bechamel, or rather one kind of Bechamel, is made by adding half a pint of cream to a well made veloute. I will now give the recipe for a sauce which I re- commend to those who love the flesh of that useful animal the pig. Having procured the livers of any kind of poultry, or of rabbits, or of hares, scald and proceed to mince them as fine as you can. Incorporate

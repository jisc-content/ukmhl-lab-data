Care should be taken always to boil maccaroni in plenty of water, the large sorts especially; for the paste it is not of so much consequence. Now, having boiled your maccaroni, proceed to dress it: Put a goodly piece of butter in a hot dish or bowl, and throw the maccaroni on the top of it, with plenty of grated Parmesan ; mis as you would a salad, and serve. Every sort can be dressed in this way, and it is a very good breakfast, luncheon, or supper dish. For children the smaller kinds of paste, with the omission of the cheese, are very wholesome food. The smaller kinds of long maccaroni are dressed as follows, in Naples, during Lent: Cut up a clove or two of garlic, wash and cut up two or three anchovies, and do the same to a few olives ; throw the whole into some fine salad oil, which you let boil until the slices of garlic begin to take colour, and then pour over your maccaroni.

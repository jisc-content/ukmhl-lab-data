BATTER. 81 Pears are treated in tlie same way as apples. Oranges.—Peel carefully, so as to remove every vestige of the white part of the rind; divide into quarters, remove the pips, roll each quarter in powdered sugar, then dip in batter and fry ; or peel and core as you would apples, cut in slices, and fry as above.

In the case of peaches and nectarines, if noyau or maraschino take the place of the syrup, the process, though expensive, will produce agree- able results.

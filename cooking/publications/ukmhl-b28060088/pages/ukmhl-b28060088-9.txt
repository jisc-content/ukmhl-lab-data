PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION. The G. C. The fact that the first edition of “ Round the Table ” has been so soon exhausted is a gratifying proof that the labours of the writer have been appreciated by the public, who have thus confirmed the favourable verdict of the Press. The Author ventures to hope that the Second Edition will meet with as cordial a reception-as that granted to the first, and that his humble efforts may continue to aid the improvement of that important part of social economy, the art of good cookery, on which depend, in so great a measure, health, good temper and contentment.

ROUND THE TABLE. 262 stiff froth with a tablespoonful of powdered lump sugar, sprinkle powdered sugar over, and bake about twenty minutes in a slack oven. The above dish can be varied by using, instead of apples cooked as above, a puree or marmalade of apples or of any other fruit, and likewise oranges treated in the manner following: Oranges au eiz Meringuees.—Peel off the thin rind of a number of oranges, make a thick syrup by boiling some loaf sugar in a little water, and let the orange rind infuse in this for a little time, but not boil in it. With a sharp knife remove from the oranges every vestige of the remainder or white part of the rind; core them as you would apples, so as to get rid of the pips, cut them in half, dispose them on the rice, pour some of the above syrup over them, and then finish the dish as in the foregoing recipe. The custard pudding of the nursery is also a very simple dish, which can be set before grown-up people if prepared after the following fashion: Caramel Pudding : Put a handful of loaf sugar to boil with a very little water until the syrup becomes a deep brown; warm a small basin, pour the syrup in it, and keep turning the basin in your hand until the inside is com- pletely coated with the syrup or caramel, which will by that time have set. Strain the yolks of eight eggs from the whites, and mix them gradually and effectually with one pint of milk. Pour this mixture (which may be left plain, or may be flavoured with orange flower water, essence of vanilla, or of lemon, &c.) into the prepared mould, lay a piece of paper on the top, set it in a sauce- pan full of cold water—taking care that the water does not come over the top of the mould—put on the cover, and set the saucepan by the side of the fire to boil gently for one hour. Then remove the saucepan to a cool place.

105 EPIGRAMS. When this second bread-crumbing has had time to dry, you must fry your Epigrams a light brown colour, and serve them on a puree of turnips, spinach, turnip tops, &c., as you may fancy, or with tomato sauce, piquante sauce, &c., or lastly, simply with fried parsley. I can safely assert that epigrams, if properly cooked, are not bad eating; and to my mind they are a better use for the breast of lamb and mutton than are roasting the one with the fore quarter and making Irish stew or mutton broth with the other. The two last-named dishes I by no means wish to disparage ; but I like them made with mutton chops or cutlets; and as for roast lamb, heterodox as I may seem, I think the brisket the worst part of the fore quarter. The only difficulty I can see in producing successful epigrams is in the frying of them. It should be borne in mind that the meat, being cooked, only requires warming, and yet the bread crumbs round it must be browned to the desired colour. The talent consists, therefore, in having the fat or lard in which they are fried—and there should be plenty of it—at the right temperature, and in knowing the exact moment at which to take the frying basket out of the frying pan. It would be too long to set forth at length the way to make the purees of turnips, spinach, turnip tops, &c., and I will only generally say that the vegetables should, when well boiled, be passed through a sieve, and the puree thickened by being warmed, at the time of serving, in a saucepan in which you have melted a goodly piece of butter and stirred a small quantity of flour; the proper seasoning of the puree with salt, pepper, and spices, not being omitted. To puree of turnips an onion may be added when they are first boiled. Epigrams, like games of chess, are capable of many

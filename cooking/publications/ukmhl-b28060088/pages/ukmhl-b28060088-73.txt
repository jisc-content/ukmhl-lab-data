57 ON NAMES. Sauce Piquante.â€”Having fried your shallots, or onions, add a small piece of garlic and some sweet herbs; use a mixture of equal parts of vinegar and water, or of vinegar and broth, strain and proceed as above. Any condiments and flavours, such as mushroom catsup, Worcester Sauce, tomato sauce, truffles, nutmeg, &c., may be advantageously added to this sauce by a capable cook. Chopped gherkins are sometimes added to this sauce, and they improve it. Sauce Robert is almost identical with the above; save in the addition of a small quantity of mustard, and if it be French mustard all the better. Sauce a la Tartare is produced by adding a larger quantity of mustard to a sauce piquante. The cold tartare is a different preparation, of which I shall treat in another place, as also of poivrade sauce, remoulade sauce, and ravigotte sauce, which are cold sauces. But there are likewise hot forms of these. Sauce Poivrade may be described as a plain sauce piquante without gherkins, but in which pepper predomi- nates. Sauce Remoulade and Sauce Ravigotte are almost one and the same thing, except that a small quantity of oil is put into the former. This is the way to proceed : Take some parsley, chervil, burnet, garden cress, tar- ragon, and any other green herbs you can get; chop them up very fine; slightly rub a saucepan with garlic or shallot; melt a piece of butter in it; add a little flour; mix tho- roughly ; add broth or stock q. sujf., pepper, salt, and a glass of white wine. A few minutes before serving throw in the herbs, a squeeze of lemon, and a pat of fresh butter. This constitutes ravigotte. By omitting the wine and the lemon, and putting in a tablespoonful of salad oil, and the least bit of mustard, you produce a remoulade.

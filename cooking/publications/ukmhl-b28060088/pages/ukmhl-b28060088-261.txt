245 EGGS. readers will successfully instruct their cooks from the directions that I am about to set forth. Given the ordinary British cook, this is how I should gradually train her up to the preparation of an omelet. By dint of great perseverance, I should endeavour to make her keep her omelet-pan perfectly clean and bright; that is a great step. Next, I should teach her how to fry a couple of eggs, thus : Melt a piece of butter in an omelet pan, and then break two eggs into it carefully so as not to break the yolks; let them set nicely over the fire, and when nearly set slip them out on to a hot dish. The butter should not be allowed to get too hot, but as soon as it is melted the eggs should be thrown in, and not more than two should be fried at a time. The butter which is left in the omelet-pan should be poured over the eggs when serving, or it may be left on the fire till it is nearly black, and then poured over the eggs with the addition of the least drop of tarragon vinegar (un filet de vinaigre), and a little minced parsley. Eggs cooked in this way are called CEufs au Beurre Noir, and when the butter is not made black they are called CEufs sur le Plat or au Miroir. A nice way of cooking eggs is au Fromage, which is done thus : Put a couple of slices of Gruyere cheese (or any other kindred sort) with a small piece of butter in the omelet-pan; break two eggs over them, add a very little salt and some pepper, and let the whole remain on a gentle fire until the whites are set: then serve. Other forms in which to serve fried eggs are t6 dish them over a puree of spinach, sorrel, endive, or celery. They may also be served with some tomato sauce, Italian sauce, sauce piquante, sauce Perigueux, &c., under them. But care must be taken not to put too great a quantity of puree or sauce in the dish.

172 ROUND THE TABLE. Greens on toast : Cut some croutons of bread in the shape of a cutlet, fry them in butter; having parboiled the cabbages or greens, arrange them in neat little pieces or heads to fit each piece of bread; stew them in some Spanish sauce, or in a well-devised brown sauce. When done lay each piece of greenmeat on its corresponding sippet of bread. Pour the sauce on the dish, and dispose the greens in a circle over it. That most vulgar greenmeat Turnip Tops, can also be dressed as above, but these can be made to assume a more artistic appearance by being reduced to a puree, the process being this: Boil thoroughly, in plenty of water, with salt and soda in due proportions, drain, and pass through a hair sieve. Melt a piece of butter, to which add a little flour and the pulp of your turnip-tops; stir on the fire a few minutes, adding a little milk or cream and a little broth or stock, with pepper and grated nutmeg to taste. When of a nice consistency, not too thick, dress on a dish as you would spinach, and serve with fried sippets of bread round it. If properly cooked this dish has a better colour than spinach, and a very pleasant- nutty bitter taste, which I some- times think preferable to that of spinach for a change. The sieve to be used should be a strong horsehair one, as wire sieves are apt to impart a bad taste, especially in the case of vegetables containing strong acids, such as sorrel. Sorrel should be treated exactly as above, only it should not be so thick as spinach, but have the consistency more of a thick sauce or puree. It is generally not served by itself, but under a piece of stewed veal or veal cutlets. The pleasant acidity of a puree of sorrel goes very well with veal, and it is made more attractive by the addition of the yolks of one or more eggs stirred into it with the

100 BOUND THE TABLE. called the scrag end of a neck of mutton—a very good dish ot Irish stew or haricot mutton can be made for the kitchen dinner; or the said trimmings can be used to make gravy or stock, or even simply mutton broth or soup. Every particle of gristle and almost all the fat should be removed from each cutlet, the bone or rib should not be more than two inches long from the cutlet itself, or “ nut,” and should be scraped quite clean. The said bone ought to be neatly sawed off, not chopped off, at the end. Having prepared your cutlets (which should not be thicker than about one-third of an inch), in the neatest manner, and given them a gentle beating with a cutlet bat, you have your choice of cooking them by various methods, which may be classed under two heads—the plain process and the bread-crumb process. There are also more elaborate ways of cooking cutlets, of which here- after. The plain process consists in broiling them on the gridiron over a clear fire, or they may be done in front of the fire, and this has the advantage, that the bones are less likely to become burnt or charred. The fire should be a brisk one, and the cutlets should be turned fre- quently during the operation. They should be under- done inside and juicy, instead of having the appearance and about the taste of a piece of soaked leather. There is no golden rule for learning to cook cutlets well by this method; practice and love of the art alone can enable the cook to approach perfection. Frying in butter, oil, or even dripping, are other modes of cooking coming under this head, but none are better in the plain form than broiling. It is easier, however, to fry a cutlet creditably than to broil it. The bread-crumb process is more elaborate. It has

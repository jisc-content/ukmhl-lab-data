64 ROUND THE TABLE. pickles of this country) put round the dish, are an improvement to the taste and appearance of it. Another way is to place the fish, when warmed, on a dish, and to cover it with a layer of bread crumbs; then brown the top and serve: or a layer of well-seasoned mashed potatoes may be put on instead. All the above refer more particularly to the remains of salmon, cod, turbot, brill, and even haddock. Fish Croquettes can be made with the remains of any boiled fish, and if well-flavoured and cooked can hold their own at any table. This is one way of proceeding : Having carefully picked out the flesh of your fish, pound it in a mortar, moistening with a little cream or milk, and a little butter; add one or more eggs, according to quantity, pepper, salt, and a few pounded spices to taste. When you have got the mixture to the consistency of a very smooth thick paste, roll it up into balls or any other shape you may fancy; they should be floured in rolling them up ; and they may be either boiled and served with a sharp sauce, or they may be fried and served without sauce, with a garniture of fried parsley. To boil them they should be dropped gently into a saucepan containing just enough boiling milk, or milk and water, or plain water, to cover them ; they take a minute or two to cook. Their fino name in this form is Quenelles of whatever the fish is, a la whatever the sauce which is served with them. When fried they are croquettes ; before frying them they should be dipped in a beaten egg and bread-crumbed, and this operation should be repeated after a little while. They should not be fried too much, but just enough to warm them and give them a light golden colour. And this reminds me of that popular English preparation, the Lobster Cutlet, for which I append several recipes.

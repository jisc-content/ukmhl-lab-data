When cold work into the mixture the yolks of four eggs ; add any flavouring you like; mix it well for some minutes; then have ready the whites of six eggs beaten up into a stiff froth, mix the two effectually and quickly together, pour into a tin, and put into the oven at once. Some cooks always put a very small pinch of salt in their souffle mixture, others do not use any butter, and others again put in some cream instead. The readiest mode of flavouring is by using the essences sold by all grocers in little bottles; but it can also be done by boiling a piece of vanilla in the mixture in the first instance, or a stick of cinnamon, or the rind of a couple of lemons or oranges. They may also be flavoured with liqueurs, such as maraschino, noyeau, &c., but these should be put in the last thing before the whites of eggs. The above is, so to speak, the common form of all souffles which take their name from the particular flavour put into them. A more delicate form of souffle is produced by using potato flour instead of wheat flour. In this case no butter should be used, and the mode of operation is somewhat different. The potato flour should be mixed with a little of the milk, and when quite smooth the rest of the milk should be added with the sugar, and the mixture stirred over the fire until it thickens. Rice flour, or arrowroot, may also be used instead of corn flour. Then, again, souffles are made absolutely of rice, potatoes, chestnuts, &c., in the manner following : Rice Souffle.â€”Boil a handful of rice in a pint of sweetened milk, with a stick of cinnamon, a piece of vanilla, or the thin peel of an orange or lemon, until the rice has absorbed all the milk.

SALADS. 217 well exposed to the sun. At the end of a week or so throw in another half-gallon of boiling vinegar, and nearly fill up the cask with white wine. Leave the bung partially open, and in six weeks you can begin to draw as good vinegar as can be wished for. If every time any vinegar is drawn it is replaced by an equal quantity of white wine, the supply will never fail; and if at the outset a certain quantity of brandy be put into the cask, the quality and strength of the vinegar will be improved thereby. Vinegar greatly improves by age, especially when a vinegar plant—or “mother”—forms in the cask; but this can be insured by procuring a vinegar plant and putting it into the cask. None but wooden taps should be used to a vinegar cask, and the bung-hole should be covered with a piece of muslin or may be stopped up, and an air-hole made in the head of the cask and covered with muslin; for, in spite of the proverb, flies will be caught by vinegar. When the acidification is complete, and the vinegar ready for use, the cask should be kept in a warm and dry spot, never in a cellar. To clarify vinegar, mix a wine-glassful of milk with a bottle of vinegar; then make a cone or filter of filtering paper, which you place in a glass funnel; pour the mix- ture into this very carefully, and in due course the vinegar will come through as clear as can be desired. For purposes of salad-making and cooking generally, vinegar is flavoured in a variety of ways. This is done by putting some strong wine vinegar into a wide-mouthed bottle, and adding to it any of the following: 1. A couple of handfuls of tarragon leaves, gathered the day before. 2. Twenty or thirty green capsicums, previously bruised.

51 ON A PINCH OP FLOUR. This is the simplest form of melted butter, which may he varied in several ways, viz. : 1. Beat up the yolk of an egg and the juice of half a lemon, strain, and stir them in just before serving, off the fire. The result is what is called sauce blanche. 2. Use milk, or milk and water, instead of water. 3. Beat up the yolk of an egg with a little cream, and stir (off the fire) into the melted butter just before serving. 4. Throw in, just before serving, some fennel, minced fine, or some chervil, picked out in little leaflets, or parsley minced fine, or capers chopped up.

Let the butter and flour get a good brown colour, then add water, and—when the sauce is made—Worcester Sauce, catsup, pepper, and other spices and condiments to taste. 6.

Cut up some onions and shallots, and a very small piece of garlic, boil them in milk, with whole pepper, mace, a few cloves, and some parsley.

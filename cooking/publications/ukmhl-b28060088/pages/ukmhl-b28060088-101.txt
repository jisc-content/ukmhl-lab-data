BATTER. 85 to bear in mind is the utmost swiftness in any operation which takes place between the pancake leaving the frying pan and being served. Coming now to savoury fritters, the most elaborate form of these is—as its fine name “ Kromesky" implies—a dish of Russian or Polish origin; and, when well executed, a most excellent dish it is. A kromesky may be defined generally as a teaspoonful of cunningly-devised mincemeat, called salpicon (not the mincemeat of Britain), wrapped either in a slice of bacon or of calf's udder, or in a piece of wafer, then dipped in batter and fried. It is the salpicon which gives the cha- racter to the kromesky, and this element of it can be prepai’ed in many ways from a variety of things. 1. Given some of the dreaded cold mutton of British households—and here I must remark that, in all prepa- rations of cold meat to be warmed up again, all fat and parts which have “ seen the fire," i.e., been browned, must be carefully excluded, else the dish you are making will betray its origin by its taste. Mince a small quantity of the said mutton until each piece is the size of a small pea. Having fried in butter to a pale straw colour some shallot or an onion finely minced, you throw in your minced mutton, give it a turn or two, then moisten with some good gravy or stock ; add spices, pepper, and salt to taste, and a pinch of minced parsley; let it reduce a little till it presents the appearance of what is called minced veal; then put it to cool, to be used as directed farther on. 2. Veal, beef, or pork may be treated in the same way, and the addition of minced truffles or mushrooms, and also (in the case of veal or pork) of a liaison of yolks of eggs and lemon juice, cannot but add to the success of the dish.

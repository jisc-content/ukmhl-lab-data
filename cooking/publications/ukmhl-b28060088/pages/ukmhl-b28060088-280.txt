264 ROUND THE TABLE. in this case no essence or spice should be used, as it would kill the flavour of the jam. An omelette soufflee is not quite in the nature of an omelet, for it is not fried but baked, and the way to make it is this : Beat up the yolks of three eggs with some pounded loaf sugar, and any flavouring essence, such as lemon, vanilla, &c.; whisk the whites into a stiff froth, mix the two together quickly and thoroughly. Lay the mixture in a heap on a silver dish, put it into a brisk oven, and the moment it is done send it up to table very swiftly. The above preparation is not an easy one to accomplish successfully, and a great deal of practice will be required to arrive at anything like perfection. And from this I am naturally led to describe that very delectable com- pound, a SOUFFLE. The same ingredients which go to make the homely batter pudding of English nurseries, manipulated in the proper manner, and flavoured as taste may suggest, become glorified into what is called a souffle. The mani- pulation is simple enough, but the cooking, which is done in the oven, requires a certain degree of skill, although it merely consists in knowing when the oven is at the right temperature; for if this be either too high or two low, the souffle will not be fit to eat, much less to look at. Souffles are usually served in the tin or dish in which they are baked. To pin a napkin round the tin when the soiffle is cooked, and to send it up to table, are operations which must be performed swiftly. A large paper case may also be used to bake a souffle, and some cooks will fix a band of paper round the tin when this is not deep enough to allow of the souffle rising. The best way, however, is to have a tin sufficiently deep, and, if within the resources of the establishment, when the soiffle is

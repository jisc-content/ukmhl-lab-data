COOKING CHEESE. \ 255 trouble and care required to prepare it. I will endeavour to describe as fully as I can tbe way I proceed in the operation of making a Fondue; and if any wbo may work from my recipe should fail, let them not be dis- heartened, but try again and again, and they will be rewarded.

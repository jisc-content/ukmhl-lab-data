ROUND THE TABLE. 20 tlie same time pastrycooks and confectioners. In fact, what Brillat Savarin says of the roaster may he said of a maker of pastry; for, unless such an one have by nat ure a light and a cool hand, no amount of teaching and practice will enable her to make good pastry. Still there are plenty and enough of sweet dishes into the composition of which paste does not enter. These should be taught by degrees —from the simplest to the more complicated. But above all things the preliminary operations, such as whisking eggs, buttering moulds, &c., must be learnt perfectly. Last of all comes the knowledge which constitutes the ethics of cookery, and this will gradually grow upon the cook who is fond of her calling and interested in it. If this be the case, she will lose no opportunity of watching better cooks than herself at work, and of seeing how they send up dinners, and of what these dinners consist. She will also make a collection of bills of fare, and last, but not least, she will study books on cookery—not mere strings of recipes, of which there are too many already, but such works as Gouffe (it has been translated), and a few others. Thus will she become able not only to cook, but also to compose a dinner. The above is but an imperfect outline of the course of study required by one who would become a good cook. Nor can the scarcity of good cooks be wondered at, when we consider the endless knowledge which must be acquired before you can honestly call yourself a cook at all. In fact, a cook must be an artist in the broadest sense of the word.

ROUND THE TABLE. ■44 to deter mine; lout I can at any rate describe the way to set about it. Fill a shallow saute-pan with water, and salt quantum suff., a few peppercorns and some leaves of parsley. When the water is on the point of boiling (it should never be allowed to boil) break two or more eggs into it (according to the size of the pan) and put on the •cover. When you judge they are done, take them out carefully, brush them clean on both sides with a paste brush, and cut each egg with a round fluted paste cutter, so as to get them all of a uniform shape, and to leave neither too much nor too little white round each egg. This done put them into the soup. Were I to continue describing all the soups thick and clear, au maigre and au gras, which are made or could be made, I should leave myself no room for anything else; but I cannot conclude this part of my subject without telling my readers how to prepare that homely but delect- able potage, the Croute au Pot, which is simply a more artistic form of putting pieces of toast into soup. Cut off the bottom crust of a cpuartern loaf, with the same thickness of crumb as there is of crust; cut it out in rounds the size of a six- pence ; soak them in some stock or broth from the pot au feu, put them (in a buttered tin) in the oven, and let them remain until they are dried up (gratines). Take some carrots and turnips out of the pot au feu, cut them out in rounds the size of a shilling and of the thickness of a penny; put these into the soup tureen, with as much stock or broth as is wanted; pick out the pieces of bread with a knife from the tin, put them in the soup, let it stand for five- minutes, and serve. Celery and leeks out of the pot au fen may likewise be added, being cut in the same manner, and also a few leaves of tarragon, which latter herb is an improvement to most clear soups.

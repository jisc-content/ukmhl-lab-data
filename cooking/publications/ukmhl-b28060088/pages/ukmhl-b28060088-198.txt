BOUND THE TABLE. 182 ture of oil, vinegar, pepper, and salt, and perhaps a little mustard. However, the process of eating an artichoke, either raw or plainly boiled, is such that many people would think it tedious, and perhaps not very elegant; wherefore professors of cookery have invented other ways of dressing this vegetable, the chief point of which consists in dressing only the eatable part of each artichoke, so that it may be eaten with a fork, as are carrots or potatoes. The process of removing from an artichoke the uneat- able part is a very easy one when you know it; but the simple word “ trim ” is hardly sufficient to explain it to the uninitiated. What is meant by trimming an artichoke is this : Cut off the stalk close ; turn the arti- choke bottom upwards, and cut it in four, six, or eight “ quarters/' as you would an orange; take each quarter, and remove with a knife the embryo stamens which are at the core; then cut off all the leaves, leaving only an eighth of an inch of the outside one; this must be done in a slanting direction, for as the leaves approach the core there is more to eat on them. Lastly, pare the outside of each quarter neatly. All these operations must be done expeditiously; and as each quarter is done it must be put into a basin of cold water with the juice of a lemon squeezed in it. When the artichokes are all trimmed they should be taken out of the basin and thrown into a saucepan full of boiling water, with salt and the juice of half a lemon; and when they are nearly cooked—say in fifteen or twenty minutes—they should be drained and put back again into the basin of cold water and lemon juice. They are now ready for dressing; and ten minutes before serving, having drained and dried them in a cloth, you can proceed to dress them in any of the following forms:

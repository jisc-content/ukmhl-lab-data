65 ON SOME ANCIENT POOD. 1. Pound the flesli of the lobster in a mortar with a fourth part of its bulk of fresh butter till you reduce it to a smooth paste; season with pepper, salt, and nutmeg, add two yolks and one white of egg; melt a small piece of butter in a saucepan, mix it with a tablespoonful of flour, and then with the lobster paste. Perfectly amalga- mate the whole, and when warm spread it out on a marble slab to the thickness you wish your cutlets to be. When cold cut out the cutlets, dip them carefully in beaten egg, and then bread crumb them with fine baked bread crumbs. After the lapse of an hour or so, repeat this operation; then fry to a nice gold colour ; insert in each cutlet bonewise a short piece of the small claws or of the antennae of the lobster. 2. Mince the flesh of a lobster to the size of small dice, season with pepper, salt and spices; melt a piece of butter in a saucepan, mix with it a tablespoonful of flour, add the lobster and some parsley finely minced ; moisten with some good stock till the mixture assumes the appear- ance of minced veal; then stir into it, off the fire, the yolks of a couple of eggs. Spread out the mixture to cool, and proceed as above. Those who like it may intro- duce into either of these dishes the slightest flavour of shallot or even of garlic, which is done by simply rubbing the saucepan with it before beginning operations. 3. Cut up, as in the foregoing, of the flesh of lobster three parts, and of mushrooms and truffles mixed one part, add pepper, salt, and spices to taste and minced parsley. Put the whole into a saucepan on the fire, moisten with some well-flavoured white sauce (veloute), add a small piece of glaze, and when the mixture is quite hot, take it off* the fire, and stir in a sufficient number of yolks of eggs to set it when cold. Then make it into, cutlets as above. p

61 ON NAMES. some butter and a little flour in a saucepan, throw in a small quantity of finely minced shallots, and the least bit of garlic (or you may rub the saucepan with a clove of that fragrant bulb); let the shallots fry a short time without taking colour, add as much gravy or stock as you want sauce, with parsley, pepper, salt, thyme, marjoram, nutmeg, and a very little cloves, all finely powdered; when the sauce boils, put in the minced liver, a glass of port wine, and, at the moment of serving, the juice of half a lemon, and a pat of fresh butter. Many other things besides pork are improved by the aid of this Liver Sauce. Here is another sauce, which in my opinion is preferable to the traditional port wine sauce with wild ducks. It is called Bigarade Sauce, and is made thus : Pare off as thin as you can the yellow rind of two Seville oranges, cut it into very thin shreds, and boil them in water for five minutes. Melt a piece of butter in a saucepan, mix with it a tablespoonful of flour, and stir until it begins to colour; add a gill of stock, pepper and salt to taste, and the juice of the oranges, with a good pinch of powdered loaf sugar, then put in the boiled rinds, stir the sauce until it boils. Lastly, here is a sauce imparted to me by a friend, whose eulogiums upon it I fully endorse; it is “ rich ” but good. “ Lady Peg’s Sauce,” for pike and other fish. Half a pint of cream, two tablespoonfuls of walnut catsup, and one of essence of anchovy. Boil these together, and just before you take them off the fire, add a little butter, rolled in flour, and a little cayenne; stir all the time after the butter is added.

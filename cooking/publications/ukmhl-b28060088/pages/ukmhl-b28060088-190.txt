And they are also served as a garniture to all sorts of meats; but for this purpose they must be made thicker. Lastly, in many cases they are made thicker still, and are eaten as vegetables by themselves. When you use vegetables which do not contain much starch, this should be supplied by flour; otherwise, when the puree comes to be put into the soup plates, the vege- table fibres will separate from the liquid, and sink to the bottom of the plate. For tbe thicker forms of puree the addition of flour is not of so much importance.

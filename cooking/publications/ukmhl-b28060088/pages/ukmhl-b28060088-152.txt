BOUND THE TABLE. 136 HOW TO CUT UP FOWLS. Having already attempted to explain the operations of trussing and of boning fowls, I am induced to try a description of the method of cutting them up to make a fricassee. To carve a cooked fowl with any degree of neatness is no easy matter, and one which requires some practice before it can be creditably accomplished. To perform the same operation at a picnic—in a plate on one’s knees—is still more difficult. Yet I have heard of expert knights of the carving knife, whose boast it is that they can carve a chicken holding it up impaled on a fork with one hand, whilst they gracefully sever the joints with a knife held in the other. But I have also heard, that on the occasion of a very limited picnic party, held on the top of some high cliffs, a gentleman, in attempting to dismember a roast chicken—the sole piece de resistance of the repast—sent it whirling down inaccessible crags, below all hope of recovery. What the consequences were form no part of the matter in hand, but they were pathetic, serious, awful. If it is difficult to carve a roast fowl properly, to cut up a raw one is still more so; and, in the latter case, it is of greater importance that the biped in question should be divided into neat and comely joints; for a fricassee de poulet, composed of ragged joints, with stumps of bone sticking out from most of them, is an unsightly object, and no amount of excellence in the taste of the sauce can make up for the unpleasant appearance of a dish.

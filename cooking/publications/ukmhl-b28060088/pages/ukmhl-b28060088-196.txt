Melt a piece of butter in a saucepan, and in it place your peas raw, with some onion, lettuce, mint or parsley or both tied up in a bundle, pepper, salt, and tbe least bit of nutmeg (grated).

In its proper season, however, there is but one way of eating asparagus, and that is plainly boiled. Tbe proper way to prepare asparagus is to scrape each bead with tbe back of a knife, then to tie it in small

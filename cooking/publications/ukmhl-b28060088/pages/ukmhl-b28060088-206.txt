ROUND THE TABLE. IDO be put after the parboiling process inside each endive. Then having tied them up again very carefully, pro- ceed as above. The way to dress lettuces is the same as for endives, with the only difference that the parboiling takes much less time. Both may also be served on bread sippets fried in butter, as mentioned for cabbages and greens. Many other vegetables may be stewed with advantage, for being thus cuits dans leur jus they lose none of their flavour. Vegetable marrows, turnips, carrots, beetroots (previously baked), potatoes, Jerusalem artichokes, par- snips, cucumbers and onions make capital dishes when properly cooked, without the agency of water. In the course of my experiments I have never tried a fresh com- bination for making a stew of the above but it has proved successful. It would be too long to describe them all, and I shall, therefore, content myself with setting forth those which have found the most favour with my friends. 1. Take some vegetable marrows, not too old (what this vegetable gains in size by age it loses in flavour), cut them up in pieces the size of a small egg, having first peeled them. Rub a saucepan with garlic, put a goodly piece of butter and a little flour in it, and throw in your pieces of vegetable marrow when the butter is melted, adding pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg. Take care they do not catch or burn, which is avoided by tossing and adding more butter if necessary. In about a quarter of an hour throw in a handful or two of grated Parmesan cheese, according to the quantity. If they look too dry add a small quantity of milk, and let the stew simmer till the marrows are quite done, when you serve with or without croutons (sippets) round the dish.

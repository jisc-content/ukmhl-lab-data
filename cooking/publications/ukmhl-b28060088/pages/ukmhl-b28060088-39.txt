23 GAENISHING. Suppose that a piece of beef be stewed according to art, and put in a dish on a tasteful and velvety gravy. Having all your vegetables ready cooked at band, you proceed to place four little heaps of cauliflowers at equal distances from each other; then you flank each with carrot cut in slabs on one side, and French beans cut into lozenges on the other; and lastly you fill in the remaining spaces, i.e., between the beans and the carrots, with potatoes cut to the shape and size of Spanish olives, and fried a very light colour in butter. I should here observe that, once cooked, these things should not be touched with the hand, but put into position by means of a larding needle and a teaspoon, or some other instrument.

The trimmings of carrots, tur- nips, &c., should go into the stock pot, those of potatoes make mashed potatoes, and purees can be made with most, if not all, of the remnants. In fact, a puree composed of a combination of vegetables is no bad thing, either as a soup or as a garnish for cutlets, &c. For purposes of gar- nishing, potatoes are also mashed, and then shaped into various forms, and they are likewise made into cro- quets, and fried a golden colour, in which latter case eggs and spices should enter into their composition.

Forcemeat, quenelles, tongue, eggs (hard boiled), olives, &c., are used in garnishing. Parsley should only be used in a fried form : a hot dish garnished with raw sprigs of

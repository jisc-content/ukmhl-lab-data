Then drain them again, and place them in cold water and lemon juice to wait till it is time to dress them for table. This pro- cess may be reversed, the parboiling taking place first, and the scraping afterwards. Cardoons are treated thus. But for artichoke stalks I prefer scraping them first. The usual formula for the preparation of cardons d la mo'elle is as follows ; and artichoke stalks may be treated in the same way. Put into a saucepan a few pieces of bacon cut small, as well as some carrots and onions, one bay leaf, a few sprigs of parsley, some whole pepper, and a few cloves. Add enough water to cover the pieces of bacon and vegetables, and set the saucepan to boil until the whole water is nearly evaporated, stirring the mixture at the latter stage of the process to prevent it “ catching.” Then add as much hot water as you put in at first; skim carefully, and strain through muslin. The liquor is called blanc : it will keep several days, and is very useful to dress artistically many vegetables besides cardoons. Having successfully prepared your blanc—lay your cardoons or artichoke stalks (previously scraped and parboiled) in a saucepan, with a few slices of lemon minus the pips and the peel; salt if necessary, and. pour in a sufficient quantity of blanc to cover them, letting them simmer till done quite tender. Now set them up in a dish, and pour over them a well-reduced sauce Espagnole in which you have incorporated two or three ounces of beef marrow dissolved au bain marie—i.e., in a vessel standing in another containing boiling water; then serve with bread sippets fried in butter. Another way is to lay the marrow on the bread sippets

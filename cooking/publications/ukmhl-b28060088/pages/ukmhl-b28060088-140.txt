124 ROUND THE TABLE. Germany with all forms of beef, either broiled, roasted, or boiled. I have met with something like it occasionally in this country, as an adjunct to roast beef, instead of the usual raw shavings of the root in question. I am now going to describe a pie invented, on purely theoretical principles, by a philosophic friend who im- parted his views to me upon the subject, and for my part I can strongly recommend it in a practical sense, having made it and eaten it on many occasions.

To put in the pie they should be sliced in pieces a quarter of an inch thick. Oysters should be bearded, and they

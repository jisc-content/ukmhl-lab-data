BOUND THE TABLE. so A pendant to the above is Potage a la Bonne Femhe, which is made in this way : Cut up a good-sized onion into very thin rounds, and place these in a saucepan with a good allowance of butter. Take care not to let the onion get brown, and when it is half done throw in two or three handfuls of sorrel, a lettuce, and a small quantity of chervil, all finely cut, add pepper, salt, a little nutmeg, and keep stirring until the vegetables are nearly done.

When it is time to send up the soup, you first remove the superfluous fat from it, then set it to boil, and when it boils stir into it (off the fire) the yolks of two or three eggs beaten up with a quarter of a pint of cream, or even milk. Pour the soup over the slices of bread, and serve in three minutes. A simpler kind of soup is made chiefly with onions, and this is the recipe for it as a maigre soup.

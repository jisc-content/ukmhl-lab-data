VEGETABLES. 191 The foregoing recipe is applicable to all the vegetables mentioned above, with the exception of onions. 2. Chop half an onion very small, and put it in a saucepan with a lump of butter; when it begins to brown throw in your vegetables (cut in pieces) pepper, salt, and a little grated nutmeg; moisten with a little broth or stock, and let them simmer till done. 3. Put the vegetables, cut up as before, into a sauce- pan with pepper, salt, nutmeg (grated), chopped parsley, and a large piece of butter; toss them for a few minutes in the saucepan, and add a small quantity of hot waterâ€”just enough to prevent their catching. When done, stir with them the yolk of an egg beaten up with the juice of a lemon. A combination of several vegetables, such as beetroot and potatoes, or carrots, turnips, and potatoes, or parsnips and turnips, &c., treated by any of the above methods, will produce very nice entremets de legumes. In most cases of stewing vegetables the least bit of sugar will be an improvement, but it must be used as carefully as if it were Cayenne pepper, under pain of spoiling the dish. Another very good way of dressing those vegetables, which the French call racines, mostly mentioned above, and also potatoes, is to cut them with a vegetable scoop, into the shape of one ounce bullets, and to toss them in plenty of butter till quite done, adding during the process salt, pepper, and a very little powdered sugar. Small new carrots are excellent cooked in this way, and when they are done the addition of some chopped parsley and a squeeze of lemon is an improvement. By a somewhat similar process, turnips are glorified into the dish called Navets Glaces. The process is this: Cut some turnips all to a uniform shape, either like small pears or like orange quarters. Parboil them for five

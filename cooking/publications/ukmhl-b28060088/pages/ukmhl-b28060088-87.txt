ON SOME ANCIENT FOOD. 71 oiled paper, broiled over a clear fire, and served either with a lump of maitre d’hotel butter over it, or with a brown caper sauce, is a dish fit for a king. Here is another form somewhat akin to the above for dressing that excellent fish the red mullet: Rougets en Papillote.—Cut one carrot and two onions into thin slices; add thyme, parsley, and marjoram, with pepper and salt to taste, and three tablespoonfuls of salad oil; mix these well together, cover each mullet with the mixture, and roll it up in a piece of white paper, pre- viously oiled ; bake them in a moderate oven half an hour, then carefully open the paper, place the fish neatly on a dish, ready to be served, and keep it warm. Melt a small piece of butter, add a large pinch of flour, half a tumbler- ful of good stock, and the vegetables, &c., the fish were cooked in. Let the sauce boil five minutes, add salt if wanted; strain, skim, pour it over the fish, and serve.

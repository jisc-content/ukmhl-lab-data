I SALADS* 227 Endive and mixed salads are not so well fitted for a lobster or a meat salad, but small and judicious propor- tions of pickles,- anchovies, olives, bam, Bologna sausage (minced small), add considerably to the merit of a salad of endive or of celery and water-cress. Of course when Bologna sausage is used there is no need of a piece of bread rubbed with garlic. These compound salads are a capital way—especially in summer—-of disposing of the remains of meat, fowls, &c.; and, as there is no end to the combinations which can be produced, I will not attempt to give a list of them. The ornamentation of salads is the next thing to consider. On supper tables more particularly, very pretty effects are produced by tastefully-ornamented salads, and to do this properly no small amount of taste and trouble is required. The readiest mode of ornamenting a salad is by dis-. posing, on the top of it, all or a portion of the following things, in some sort of pattern—viz., hard-boiled eggs, cut into rounds or quarters; shoes of beetroot, truffles, and cucumber, cut into shapes; radishes, pickled gherkins, cut in some fanciful way, fillets of anchovies, &c. The flowers of borage, nasturtium, &c., can also be used ; and in large dishes, according to the nature of the salad, crayfish, and prawns can be introduced—whole as ornaments, and likewise pieces of aspic jelly. Another way, which may be called the geometrical form, well repays by its effect the trouble it entails. Begin by preparing your colours, so to speak, each in a separate saucer. These are (black) truffles minced very small, also caviar; (two dark greens) watercress or parsley, minced fine; (three lighter greens) capers, gherkins, garden cress, all finely minced; (purple) Q 2

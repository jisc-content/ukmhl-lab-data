ROASTING. 149 In the case of joints of meat-the following are the mair points to be attended to. The joint should be trimmed neatly, I would cut off the end or flap of a sirloin of beef (this makes a very good stew for a kitchen dinner, or may be used to make stock with greater advantage than roasting it with the jointâ€”in the point of view both of economy and of taste); put a piece of buttered paper, tied on with string over the fat, and do not remove it until just before the joint is done. If it can possibly be avoided, do not used skewers to fix up the joints, but use string instead; and when practic- able perpendicular roasting is preferable to horizontal, as not requiring the use of the spit. Place the meat at first a foot and a half from the fire, or even further off if it be a large joint and the fire greater in proportion. When the meat is well warmed, gradually bring it nearer, and from that time never cease basting the joint at regular intervals, but this you must not overdo. The time that meat takes to roast is usually set down at from fifteen to twenty minutes for every pound that the joint weighs; but this is a very broad rule, so many circumstances tending to modify it. The quality of the meat, the age of it, whether it be fresh killed or not, the season of the year, the nature of the fire, and the position of it as regards currents of air in the kitchen, must all be taken into consideration. One thing only is certain, and that is that when the joint begins to smoke it is nearly, if not quite, done, and at this stage two or three minutes more or less at the fire will make or mar the success of the joint as a piece of artistic roasting. At the last stage of roasting salt should be sprinkled freely over the joint, and the usual practice is to froth it up, as it is called, by dredging flour over it, then the gravy is made by pouring a cupful of boiling

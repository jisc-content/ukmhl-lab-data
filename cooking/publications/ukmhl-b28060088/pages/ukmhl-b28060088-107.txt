BOILING MEAT. 91 accelerate evaporation, but will not make the water hotter â€”on the contrary, it will not only retard the cooking, but will help to make the meat tough, and is therefore pure waste. The talent in boiling a piece of meat consists in so regulating the fire as to keep the water always at the same temperature, and this should be a gentle simmer. When meat is put to cook in hot water the scum will not rise in such quantities as in the process of making stock ; but it should be as carefully removed, and no salt put in until the water is perfectly free from scum. Then also should be added a due proportion of certain vegetables, such as carrots, onions, celery, and also sweet herbs, according to the kind of meat which is being boiled; but by no means in such quantities as would be used in making soup. The next point which demands attention is, that the piece of meat be completely covered with water; and if during the process of boiling it should evaporate so far as not to cover some part of the meat, more boiling water should be added. The time that a joint of meat should boil is set down usually at the rate of fifteen to twenty minutes for every pound which the joint weighs ; but this is a very rough rule to go by. The only reliable rule is that which the experience of the cook supplies. A very good way to boil meat is to boil it in the pot in which stock is being made. It should be put in after the stock has gone through the process of skim- ming, and all the vegetables have been added to it. The joint should always be neatly trimmed and tied up with twine before being put to boil; and the English practice of salting beef which is intended to be boiled should be avoided. Such a practice cannot be too strongly con- demned ; for while it impairs the wholesomeness of the meat, and makes it less digestible, it considerably dimi- nishes the nutritive properties of it; and, boil it as

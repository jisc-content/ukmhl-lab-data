I have eaten delicious salads in Italy composed entirely of dandelions and other wild herbs gathered by the road and the river side. There is no lack of dandelions in the rural lanes of this country, and I believe burnet grows wild ; but I should be puzzled to find the dozen anu more different herbs which composed my wild salads, and I have not sufficient confidence in my botanical knowledge to try the experiment. Potatoes and beetroot are by no means the only vege- tables which can be made into a salad when cooked. Dried or fresh haricot beans, French beans, asparagus, Jerusalem artichokes, cauliflowers, brocoli sprouts, tur- nip-tops, &c., make very good salads. They should be plainly boiled in salt and water, and well drained. When they are quite cold, then make your salad.

What I have often said before of cook- ing applies still more forcibly to salad making; for in this you have no action of the fire, which sometimes corrects the mistakes of the operator; it is as in fresco-

BOUND THE TABLE. 42 some celery into round pieces with a cutter, and have some very small onionsâ€”about equal quantities of all. Boil each vegetable, separately, in salted water, with a small piece of butter, till it is cooked, but not overdone; lay the vegetables on a hair sieve, and throw a little cold water over them. At the time of serving put them all into a saucepan with a pint of well-flavoured stock, or of consomme, and when it is on the point of boiling add as much of it as you want soup, and a few sprigs of chervil or of tarragon.

Put the carrots into a saucepan with a large piece of butter, a teaspoonful of powdered loaf sugar, and pepper and salt. Toss them on the fire until they begin to take colour, then put in the celery; after a little time the onions; and lastly the turnips. Toss them altogether for a few

75 FRYING. up for frying. Fish and other things are egged and bread crumbed, floured, or dipped in batter. For fish, eggs and bread crumbs are a mistake; flouring is the proper thing, and this should be done at the moment of frying, and not before. To flour successfully whitebait and other small fry, oysters, &c., you should possess the instrument I am about to describe, which, if it is not to be bought in this country, can easily be made to order. It is in shape like a long drum, and consists of four parts, which fit into each other. The bottom compartment is like a deep sieve, with a piece of parchment stretched across it, instead of tammy or wire. On this fits another sieve, also with a parchment bottom, but pierced with holes the size of a pea, and on this again fits another sieve, the parch- ment of which is pierced with very small holes, or a piece of tammy is stretched across it instead; then comes a fourth piece, with whole parchment, which is simply a cover. When fitted together, the four pieces present three chambers, the bottoms of which are respectively a piece of parchment, the common bottom of the whole apparatus, another piece with large holes, and another with small holes, or made of tammy. If you place some flour in the top compartment, your whitebait in the second, fit the pieces together, put on the cover, and shake the apparatus from side to side on the table, a cloud of flour will descend on to the fish from the third floor, and the superfluity will fall through the large holes into the first floor, leaving the fish in the second floor, floured to a nicety. If you will bread crumb your fish, the process should be carried out some time before frying, and it is better always to do it a second time after the lapse of an hour or so ; and any other things which have to be bread crumbed, such as cutlets, &c., should be treated in like manner.

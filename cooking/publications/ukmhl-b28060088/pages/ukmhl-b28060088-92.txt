76 ROUND THE TABLE. Some vegetables, such as slices of vegetable marrow, or bottoms of artichokes, need only to be floured in the machine aforesaid before frying; but, as a general rule, they are better dipped in batter. When the thing fried is done it should be placed on a cloth or on several sheets of blotting paper in front of the fire to let all the grease evaporate and drop from it. If savoury it should be sprinkled freely with salt, as fine as can be procured, and this should be done at once; the sweets should be covered with finely-powdered sugar at the time of serving. The best fire to fry upon is a clear wood fire when this can be managed. Frying with a coal fire on an English fireplace, such as exists in most houses, is an opera- tion trying alike to the patience and to the back of the operator. That the frying-pan should, as everything else in a kitchen, be scrupulously clean I need hardly say; but, to fry successfully, this point is of some importance, and there are as many people, if not more, who require to be told of it as there are who do not. In conclusion, I will tell you of a homely conceit of a floury nature which is used in the land of the Gaul. Put about a pint of water in a saucepan with a few grains of salt, a piece of butter the size of an egg, and as much sugar, with plenty of grated lemon peel. When the whole boils, throw in gradually sufficient flour to form a thick paste; then let it remain ten minutes, and work into it (off the fire) three or four eggs, reserving the white of one or two, which you whisk into a froth, and mix into the paste. Let it rest a couple of hours, then proceed to fry by dropping pieces of it the size of a walnut into very hot lard. The paste will swell in the process of frying, and hollow balls of a fine golden colour will be produced

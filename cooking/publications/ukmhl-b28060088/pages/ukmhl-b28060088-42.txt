The clearness of the soup will depend upon all the scum being taken off, and upon the water not boiling until it is all removed. This done; have the following vegetables carefully cleaned and cut up in small pieces, which you put into the saucepan a few at a timeâ€” viz., a couple of onions, a clove of garlic (not a whole bulb), three or four carrots, three or four turnips, and three or four leeks (all according to size), one head of celery, one root of parsley and leaves, and a couple of tomatoes, either fresh or dried.

Then, or before, if, by tasting, the soup is found sufficiently flavoured, the muslin bag must be taken out.

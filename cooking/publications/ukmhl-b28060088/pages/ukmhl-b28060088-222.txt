ROUND TEE TABLE. 206 The first step is to boil them, and, unlike fresh vege- tables, which should always be thrown into boiling water, these must be put to cook in cold water. I have seen in a cookery book (not Irish) directions to “ boil beans in cold water ”—a difficult process, I imagine, to carry out. The point to be obtained is that the beans should be thoroughly done and floury, and yet that each should remain whole without the skin being cracked. To insure this, after having been picked out clean and washed, the beans before being put to cook should be allowed to soak in cold water for at least twelve hours. No salt should be put into the water until they are almost done; and during the process of boiling small quantities of cold water should be put at intervals into the saucepan, and the addition of an onion stuck with cloves, some whole pepper, and a bay leaf will be an improvement. When dried vegetables are intended for a puree the process of boiling is somewhat different, for it is obviously of no conse- quence that the skin should split. The principal varieties of dried haricots are the Soissons, the Flageolets, both green and white, and the red and the speckled haricots, all of which can be had in perfec- tion at good Italian warehouses in town. Of lentils there are two kinds—the small (called a la reine), and the large ; the former are the darkest, and best adapted for purees, hence some cooks call the potage a la Conti—poiage a la reine. Peas are well enough known, both whole and split, and are fit for purees only; but there is a kind called Spanish peas, which make a very good dish of them- selves ; and then there are peas dried green, wherewith o-reen pea soup can be made at all times. Lastly, DRIED BROAD beans are to be got, and they make a very fair puree of its kind for a change. I now proceed to set

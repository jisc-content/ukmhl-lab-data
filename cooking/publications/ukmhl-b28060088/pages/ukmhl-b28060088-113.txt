97 ON A TIN OP BEEP. mince was prepared, beyond stating tbat the juice of a lemon and the yolk of an egg put into it at the right moment gave it a piquancy of flavour, which made it quite a distinct dish from the other. From this experiment I opine that the best use of Australian beef is to make soup such as I have de- scribed. It will without doubt be a great saving, for to make soup means, with English cooks, the expenditure of pounds and pounds of meat. As for the Australian meat itself, the ugly fact will always remain that it is over- done ; overdone meat is not nice to eat, and no amount of sauce, ever so tasty, will make it a desirable dish. Scores of people, however, pronounce it excellent, but there are degrees of excellence, and tastes differ. I have no doubt that in time some better method of(ttinning” the meat will be found, and what I think above all a great desideratum is that the joints should be cut by some competent person, as then we should get out of a tin a presentable piece of meat, instead of a “ hunk ” cut any- how, with a few bits put in to make up the weight. When prepared in the form of a mince, the over- cooking of the meat is not so perceptible, and in this way a variety of dishes can be produced. Besides patties of puff paste, cases or borders of potatoes or of rice may be used. With poached eggs it makes a nice dish, and it will also make very fair croquettes and rissoles. To make hashes, haricots, and stews which shall be good in an artistic sense, we must wait till some improve- ment has been effected in the manner of tinning Austra- lian meat, and this, I am confident, we may look for at no very distant time. As to eating the meat cold, it would be better to make it into a salad than to eat it with a salad; and I would suggest the following as a sinqile form : H

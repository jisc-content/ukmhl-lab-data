BOUND THE TABLE. 184 present day these, as well as most vegetables, can be had in perfection preserved in tins and at a moderate expense. It is better, when practicable, to avoid boiling arti- chokes in iron saucepans; and, indeed, this rule applies to all vegetables containing acids which will act upon iron. An earthen pot or a tinned copper pan should be used, or, if you will have iron saucepans they should be lined with white enamel. Cabdons a la Mojelle is one of the standing dishes of the Paris restaurants. In England this vegetable is very little known. Cardoons are mentioned in seeds- men’s prices current, but in greengrocer’s shops they are seldom if ever seen. A very fair substitute for them, which, if it does not possess all the delicacy of taste of the real cardoon, has at all events the advantage of being very cheap—so cheap, in fact, that it is to be got for nothing—is to be found in the stalks of green artichokes, which often are sent to mai’ket with a foot or more of it attached to them—English-grown ones especially. Now these artichoke stalks can be made into a dish closely resembling cardoons—which are themselves a kind of artichoke—with this difference, that the leaves proper are very thick, and, being banked up like celery, grow very white and tender. The stalks or ribs (cotes) of these are eaten, and not the bud, so to speak, as with the green artichoke. This is how to proceed with the stalks of these same English artichokes to make a very, good dish of what most people' would look upon as vegetable refuse. Cut the stalks in lengths of four or five inches, scrape off them as you would off a carrot—their outer fibrous envelope, and as you finish each piece put it into a basin containing cold water and the juice of a lemon.

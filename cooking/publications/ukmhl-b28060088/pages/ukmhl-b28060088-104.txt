EOUND THE TABLE. 88 make the foundation of good savoury fritters. They sliouid mostly be previously parboiled, and of course cut into convenient shapes; and as all that need be done then is to dip each piece in batter and fry it, I shall content myself with enumerating some of those vegetables which make the best fritters—they are cauliflowers, vegetable marrow, artichokes, Jerusalem artichokes, celery, seakale, and asparagus, &c. Artichokes proper alone require special treatment. The upper part of the leaves and the small leaves in the centre should all be cut off, and the stalk trimmed away until nothing is left but what is good to eat. Then each artichoke should be cut into four “ quarters,” or more according to its size. During this operation of trimming the pieces should be kept in water in which the juice of a lemon has been squeezed, else wherever the knife has touched them they will turn black. They also should be parboiled longer than any other vegetables, some of which, such as vegetable marrow, re- quire no parboiling at all, if cut in sufficiently small pieces. In Italy, as I have before remarked, they also make fritters with the leaves of spinach, of sorrel, of borage, the flowers of vegetable marrow before it blooms, and the flowers of white acacia. The way to proceed is first to wash and thoroughly dry the leaves or flowers. Then, taking by the stalk a couple of leaves, or only one, ac- cording to the size, you dip it in batter, see that it is well covered, and then drop it into the frying-pan. "V egetable marrow flowers, or rather buds, are fried one by one, and acacia flowers in small bunches. Another description of savoury fritters is made with a kind of paste, which, being allowed to cool, is cut into shapes, which are dipped in batter and fried. Here are several forms of it. 1.

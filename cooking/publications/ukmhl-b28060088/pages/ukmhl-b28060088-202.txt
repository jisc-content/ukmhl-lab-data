ROUND THE TABLE. 186 instead of putting it in the sauce. The Spanish sauce is not indispensable, for the blanc in which the cardoons have been cooked, if it be more highly flavoured and thickened with butter and flour, will do for a sauce, only the dish will not be, of course, so distingue. With “tinned” cardoons the mode of proceeding is as follows: Take a tin, open it, drain off the liquor, and lay the cardoons in a stewpan with enough well-flavoured stock to cover them. Let this remain on the fire just long enough to warm the cardoons through. Procure some large pieces of marrow by getting the butcher to break the bones for you, and lay the marrow in a saucepan with cold water and salt for about an hour; then pour off the water, replace it with fresh salted water, and put the saucepan on the fire. As soon as the water boils, take the saucepan off the fire, and let the marrow remain in the water till wanted. Fry in butter some well-shaped sippets of bread; cut up the marrow, and place a piece of it on each sippet. Dispose these round a dish j pour some brown sauce, reduced almost to a glaze, in the middle; lay the cardoons on it, and serve. Seakale and celery, likewise, can be cooked as are cardoons; but the former is best plainly boiled, as described before.

Tomato sauce goes very well with them also, as

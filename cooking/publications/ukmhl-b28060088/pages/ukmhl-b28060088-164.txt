BOUND THE TABLE. 148 cooking like their meat to be dressed. In this matter tastes differ much; what some people would call a joint roasted to a nicety, others would pronounce spoilt. With those who will have their beef and mutton so overdone as no longer to contain a drop of gravy I have no patience. The veriest tyro is aware that beef overdone is as indi- gestible as veal underdone; and that neither is so nice to the palate as when the former is full of ruddy gravy, and the latter well done through without being dried up. The taste for dried-up meat must have arisen from a continuous era of unskilful cooks, whose legs of mutton were overdone outside and raw inside. This I own to be disgusting, and I can quite understand that a joint overdone right through would be preferable to such an one; and likewise I can understand that a practice adopted in self-defence from bad cooking, may have gradually, by the force of habit, become a confirmed taste. Neither do I hold, on the other hand, with those who carry out almost to the letter the Breton proverb : “ Canard saignant, Mouton belant.” This is, like most proverbs, figurative language, but none the less true for all that. Fancy an over-done wild duck—a wild duck from whose breast the carving knife does not draw one drop of the rosy gravy ! There is an old rule well-known all over the world of cookery, and that is, “ white meats well done, black meats underdonethis applies to all meats of the four as well as of the two-legged sort, but then it means properly well done, and properly underdone. To attain this end the first thing which demands attention is the making up of the fire. It should be regulated according to the size and the nature of the article which is to be roasted, and should be so managed as to last all-aglow tho whole length of time that the roasting will take.

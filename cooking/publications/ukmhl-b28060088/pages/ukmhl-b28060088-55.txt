ON SOME ANCIENT AND MODERN SOUPS. 39 Carefully skim and strain the liquor; then put it on the fire again, and when it boils put in the cut pieces of sole. When they are cooked take them out, put them into the soup tureen with a few sprigs of chervil or parsley, and, having strained the liquor once more, put it over them and serve. Passing now to clear soups ; these may always be pre- pared with the bouillon of the pot clu feu, or with ordinary stock. If this latter is more highly flavoured by the addition of ham, veal, or poultry, you will have what is called consomme, which is the highest form of clear soup, not to be confounded with the liquefied glue which goes by the name of gravy soup.

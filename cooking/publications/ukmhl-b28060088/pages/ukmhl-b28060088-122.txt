ROUND THE TABLE. 108 variations. One of them consists in this, that mushroom trimmings are added to the liquor in which the breast has been braised, and being well reduced on the fire, then strained, and skimmed of all fat, a liaison of two yolks of eggs and the juice of a lemon is added to this sauce, off the fire. The breast being cut up into cutlets, each is dipped into the sauce, instead of into eggs, in the bread-crumbing process; but the sauce must be applied, hot, and the bread crumbs when it is cold. Another form is to fit to each epigram, before bread- crumbing, a small neck-chop bone, and—having cooked some cutlets in the same fashion—to serve, them round some potatoes sautees, in a circle composed alternately of an epigram and a cutlet. Another way is this : When the breast is cold, instead of being cut up, it is neatly trimmed, then anointed with butter melted for the purpose, bread-crumbed, and grilled. It is then served very hot, with a pat of butter under it, the juice of a lemon over it, and a good sprink- ling of white pepper—those who like it may introduce cayenne. A simpler way of cooking the breast in the first in- stance is to put it into the soup or stock pot; but, the instant that the bones can be pulled out, it must be taken out. Breast of veal also may be treated in the manner detailed above; only, when it has been pressed and is cold, if it is found to be too thick, it must be neatly split in two with a sharp knife, and then cut into cutlets. Epigrams made of veal should be served with a puree of sorrel or of spinach; a puree of turnips or of turnip tops would not go well with them.

A large piece of butter, a couple of onions, a head of celery, some sliced carrots, whole pepper, mace, cloves, a bundle of sweet herbs and parsley, with salt to taste, should be added. The boiling should be carried on slowly, the pot should be carefully skimmed, and in a couple of hours or less, according to the size of the victim, the sacrifice will be accomplished. Some people stuff a boiled turkey with oysters, and serve oyster-sauce with it—that is a matter of taste; not to stuff it with truffles is also a matter of taste, but there cannot be much doubt about it. A puree of celery, or of chestnuts, or of onions (and why not?— call it Soubise, and no one will object), will go very well with boiled turkey. But to my mind the best of all sauces is tomato sauce; nor would I object to a puree of endive, or of any other green meat if a proper degree of piquancy were given to it by the admixture of lemon juice. Many other things are done with turkeys; they make the best galantines; their wings (ailerons) make very good entrees, and French cookery books—especially the old ones—contain scores of dishes made with these; lastly, the leg of a turkey makes the best “ Devil” I know.

HOW TO BONE FOWLS. 135 the breast; and this requires great care to avoid injuring the skin, especially over the breast bone. When you have worked round both sides you remove the carcase—which can be drawn at leisure, and should be boiled along with the galantine when this is put to cook—and you have the fowl all boned except the thigh and leg bones on each side. The mode of getting rid of these is this : Make an incision along the thigh, as in Fig. 3 ; dissect the Fig. 3. bone from the flesh, as on the opposite thigh in the same figure; scrape the flesh along the leg bone, and finally pull this out, and it will carry the remaining sinews with it. All that now remains to be done is to cut out the “ wishing-bone,” which will probably have remained in the flesh of the breast, as well as the two large white sinews of the breast; and you may proceed to finish your galantine in the way you think best. Remember only that a galantine without truffles in it, and a good aspic jelly, clear as amber, round it, is very much a Hamlet-without-the-prince sort of dish.

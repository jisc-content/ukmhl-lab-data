38 ROUND THE TABLE. of sausage called “ zampone,” cliiefly from sucli material. It is eaten boiled, and very delicate eating it is. The liquor in which a leg or a neck of mutton bag, been boiled, in the English fashion, can be turned by the economical housewife, to very good account to make- soup in this wise : Remove all fat from it, which is easily done when it is cold; then add to it the pulp of dried or fresh peas, or haricot beans, and put into it a muslin bag containing some spices, whole pepper, and sweet herbs. Let it boil a short time, add salt if necessary, and serve with bread sippets. The practice of serving mint with peasoup is barbarous; /t should be boiled in the soup in the bag aforesaid. The liquor in which a knuckle of veal has been boiled can be put to the very same use as the above, as can also that obtained from boiling fowls : it can in fact be made into stock by boiling a judicious selection of vegetables in it, and otherwise flavouring it with liei’bs and spices. A very good soup can be made with some of the liquor aforesaid by the following process : Put a root of parsley and a piece of celery into the liquor, with pepper, mace, a few cloves, a piece of lemon peel, and ysalt if necessary. Let it boil for an hour; then strain and boil in it some filleted soles, cut up into small pieces. Serve when the soles are done, with a few sprigs of parsley or chervil thrown in at the moment of serving. This is a more elaborate form : Consomme de Soles.—Remove the fillets from a pair of soles, cut them out with a cutter in pieces the size of a penny : put the bones and all the trimmings of the soles in a saucepan with one quart of plain white stock, a large handful of parsley, a piece of celery, one onion, two or three cloves, a blade of mace, pepper and salt to taste. Let this boil slowly from three to four hours.

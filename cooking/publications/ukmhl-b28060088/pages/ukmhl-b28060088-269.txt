Rubbing the dish slightly with garlic or shallot before commencing operations is accounted by some an improvement. (Eufs Farcis.—Cut some hard boiled eggs in halves. Mince the yolks with olives, capers, anchovies, and truffles, a little tarragon and chervil, and add pepper and salt. Fill each half egg with this mixture, pour some liquefied butter over, warm them in the oven and serve each half egg on a bread sippet, cut with a fluted cutter and fried in butter. I need hardly remark that this dish can be varied in many ways. Hard boiled eggs may also be served a la martre d’hotel or with a Bechamel, or with a Soubise sauce. The first form consists in tossing them till warm in some butter—after having cut them in pieces—and then adding pepper, salt, minced parsley, and a few drops of lemon juice. For the others they need only be warmed in a sufficient quantity of the respective sauces. I would observe in conclusion, that I by no means pre- tend to have exhausted all the forms that eggs may bo made to assume as a savoury dish ; but I have described I think a sufficient number for my present purpose. Of eggs made into sweet dishes I treat elsewhere.

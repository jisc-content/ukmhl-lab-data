STOCK. 2ff will be found a glassful or more of pui’e meat stock, which comes in vei-y well to put into sauces, or to improve common stock. Some of this, put into stock, will also have the effect of clarifying it, nearly if not quite as well as any other method. Of course the stock obtained from a joint of beef, in the manner just described, will be better than that which a joint of mutton will yield; but still this latter is by no means to be despised. Great care must be taken in making stock or soup not to let the meat, bones, or vegetables be over-boiled. It is a mistake to suppose that the more these things are boiled the better the stock will be. A piece of meat, a bone, or a carrot has only so much flavour to give, and, when this is got out of it, it will rather spoil than improve the stock by being- further boiled in it. What is the precise length of time that these things should be boiled, is a matter which—supposing the operator to have average brains—pi-actice alone and not I can determine.

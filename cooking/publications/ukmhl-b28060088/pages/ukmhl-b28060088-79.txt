ON SOME ANCIENT FOOD. G3 water, or milk and water, in equal parts, may be used instead of the water and glass of vinegar. It is better, when fish is intended to be boiled, to clean it from the gills, without splitting it open. This is an operation not understood, I believe, by English fish- mongers ; but it is not more difficult than skinning eels, and is easily learnt by a little practice. Fresh-water fish are ver)>- much improved by being- boiled in a court bouillon, and the muddy taste which some have can be got rid of by pouring a small quantity of vinegar down the throat of the fish while it is still alive.

The remains, or, as the French say, “ reliefs,” of most boiled fish can be turned into very nice dishes when you know how to do it. The first principle is to pick out carefully all the bones, skin, &c., leaving nothing but the flesh. This done, you can simply put it into a saucepan, with a goodly piece of butter and minced parsley; keep shaking till the fish is warmed, and then add a little lemon juice, pepper, and salt, and cayenne, if liked.

There should not be too much sauce; and a few sliced gherkins (pickled a la Fran^aise, not the mixed

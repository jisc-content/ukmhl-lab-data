ROASTING. 153 to be classed in our days with domestic poultry, should be treated in the same manner as fowls. Partridges, however, being a dark-fleshed bird, require to be less done; but they should always be roasted with a slice of fat bacon tied round them, and the introduction of a couple of bay leaves inside them is said to improve their taste. Pheasants are of course always finely larded and stuffed with truffles by the true gourmand. Woodcocks, snipes, and plovers, and every other kind of winged game not of the duck tribe, should be enclosed in a slice of bacon while roasting, and should be judi- ciously basted, neither too much nor too little. Trail birds should have one or more slices of buttered toast placed under them, to catch the trail, and great care must be taken not to overdo them under pain of render- ing them uneatable. It is a bad plan to “spit” any small birds; they should be tied to the spit, and, if roasted in the contrivance which the French call a rotissoire, they stand a better chance of being artistically roasted. This machine is simply a diminutive meat screen holding a horizontal spit, which is set in motion by clockwork. I do not know whether such an apparatus is to be procured in this country; but I well remember how, in days gone by, this machine had a bell, which began to toll slowly some time before the works had run down, and gradually increased to a mad peal as the stoppage of the machinery drew nigh. Then there was a kind of arm with a ladle at the end attached to a spit in the rotissoire, which at every revolution of the spit gathered up the gravy, and then discharged it over the bird. Of course this machine would not do to roast large joints nor a bird with toast under it; but in this latter case the self-acting baster could be removed. In roasting venison, the great point to attend to is to

ROUND THE TABLE. 50 recipe; details of quantities of ingredients, such as a quarter of a teaspoonful of salt, three peppercorns, one clove, and so forth, are simply ridiculous. Tastes differ; and the proportions of salt, spices, and such things, can safely, and indeed should, be left to the taste of the operator. But it is much more to the purpose to state when and how to put in these things. Take, for instance, the case of salt, which should be put into most things when they are first set to cook; whilst with dried haricot beans it should only be put in when they are nearly boiled, or else they will all split and break—every one. Plain melted butter is another instance. In its simplest form it is a mixture of flour, butter, water, and salt. The proportions of it should be, butter and water, with just enough flour to thicken the mixture, and salt quantum suff. The way in which your plain cook usually sets to work, is to dredge some flour, generally a good deal of it, into the water, adding a small piece of butter and salt, and stirring the whole on the fire. Another wav is to roll a piece of butter in flour, and then to put it into the water with the salt. The result of these manipulations most people know too well, and rightly deplore. Some- times, by chance or extra care and the use of a colander, the butter may be free from little round lumps of flour, and be less like paste than it usually is. Now, with these very same ingredients, and less trouble, good eatable melted butter can be made. The whole secret lies in the modus operandi, and it is this—the butter should be melted first, then the flour added, which will amalgamate with it almost of itself, and thereby render impossible the lumps above referred to; the water (boiling) is now put in with a proper quantity of salt, and the mixture being stirred on the fire until it thickens, your melted butter is made.

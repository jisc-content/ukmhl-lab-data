COOKING CHEESE. 257 paper cases with the mixture; bake in a quick oven —a longer or shorter time, according as you use patty pans or paper cases—say from ten to twenty minutes. These are called rahequins (ramakins) in cookery books. Their Gallic form is as follows : 3. Into a saucepan containing about a pint of hot water put three ounces of grated Gruyere cheese, and the same quantity of butter, and pepper and salt quant, snff. Let the water boil until the cheese is dis- solved, then incorporate with it as much flour as will make a very stiff paste, which you may touch without its sticking to the fingers. Work it well with a wooden spoon, and be careful to leave no knots in it. You now remove the saucepan from the fire, and work into it at least four eggs, one by one. Let the paste get quite cold, and then dispose it in little balls, a size bigger than a walnut, on a baking sheet. Bake a light brown colour, and serve. Or, instead of baking them, they may be fried in plenty of lard. What are called Talhouses a la St. Denis are not unlike ramakins, except that Brie cheese is used instead of Gruyere. This, however, is a better way of preparing them: Take equal parts of Brie and of butter, and, having- removed with great care all the rind from the cheese, make a paste by working some eggs and flour with the cheese and butter, a little salt, and a very little pepper. Roll out your paste to the thickness of two half-crowns, cut it out in triangles, brush the top with egg, and bake till done. Some English soft cheeses may be used instead of Brie, but I am afraid the result would only bo a bad imitation of the real Talmouses s

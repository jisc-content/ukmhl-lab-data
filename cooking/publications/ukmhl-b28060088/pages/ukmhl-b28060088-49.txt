33 ON SOME ANCIENT AND MODERN SOUPS. Supposing no stock to be available, tlie way to proceed would be to put tbe remains of the fowls bodily into a saucepan, with carrots, onions, sweet kerbs, a little bacon, and any bones, veal trimmings, &c., which may be handy; moisten with a quart or so of water, and let the whole simmer away slowly. After about three hours’ simmering take out the pieces of fowl, which you treat as directed above, and strain the broth in which they have been boiled; when it is cold remove all fat from it, and use it instead of stock. The above formula will apply to the making of soup with remnants of any kind of poultry or game, with such variations as taste and practice may suggest, as, for instance, if wild ducks were thus treated—and a truly toothsome potage they make—no cream should be used, but the yolks of egg should be beaten up with a wine- glassful of sherry or claret, and little or no bread crumbs should be used. Another variation consists in pounding the fowls, bones and all, and after having passed the result through a sieve, adding the bread crumbs. Some use boiled rice instead of bread crumbs. The following is a very good form of white thick soup. Boil a few Jerusalem artichokes with salt, and when quite done pass them through a fine hair sieve. Take as much milk as you want soup, and boil in it a handful of pepper, some mace, cloves, nutmeg, &c., also some parsley, and the smallest bit of shalot. The success of the soup depends upon the proportions of these things, and these, as I have said before, practice can best teach. When the milk is well flavoured, strain it; then melt a good-sized piece of batter in a saucepan, and stir into it first a handful of potato flour, if you have it, or if not, corn flour, then the milk and the pulp of the Jerusalem arti- chokes, each in such quantities as will give your soup the D

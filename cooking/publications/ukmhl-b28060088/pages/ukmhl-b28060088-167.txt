BOASTING. 151 fillet witli salt, and cease basting, to let the larding take colour. Collect wliat gravy is in tbe dripping pan, free it entirely from fat, and serve it under tbe fillet; which may be garnished either with fried potatoes or with water- cresses. If the gravy collected in the dripping pan is not sufficient, some well-flavoured and reduced clear beef stock can be added to it. Loin of Mutton en Papillote.—Take a piece of the neck end of the loin, saw off the chine bone, remove all superfluous fat and gristle, and trim the joint to a nice shape. Lay it for half a day or more in a marinade com- posed of olive oil, and plenty of onions and carrots sliced fine as for Julienne, with some whole pepper, cloves, salt, chopped parsley, a couple of bay leaves, and sweet herbs to taste. Then pack up the joint in oiled paper, with the vegetables, &c., composing the marinade, and roast it at a slow fire, basting it occasionally with the oil of the marinade. Some time before serving remove the paper, brush off the vegetables, let the joint take colour, glaze the top if you like, and serve either with potatoes sautees an beurre, or with a ragout of any suitable vegetable cooked in a rich gravy. Red wine is sometimes used for the above marinade, either in equal parts with—or instead of—oil; in the latter case, butter is used for the basting. The neck end of a loin of veal trimmed in the same manner, then larded, put into a marinade, and roasted in paper, makes a very nice dish. It need not necessarily be garnished with a ragout of vegetables, but in that case it should be served with some well-flavoured and well- reduced gravy. Legs of mutton are put into a marinade for two or three days, and basted with it when roasted. A clove of garlic inserted in the knuckle gives the joint a flavour very agreeable to those who do not object to that bulb.

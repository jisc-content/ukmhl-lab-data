MUTTON CUTLETS. 101 one great advantage for those whose principal object is economy. The streak of meat, with the fat and gristle which adhere to the bone of the cutlet, need not be cut off, but simply detached from the bone, leaving one end attached to the nut of the cutlet. It is then turned back round the said nut, the cutlet is plentifully smeared with egg, and thickly plastered over with bread-crumbs. Frying consolidates the whole mass, and you have as handsome a cutlet, at all events in size, as ever graced the -window of a cheap restaurant. This meretricious process, however, is never resorted to by true artists and professors; they trim their cutlets just as for broiling, then, holding them by the bone, they dip them into an egg well beaten up, or butter melted for the purpose, or hot gravy, or olive oil, either warm or cold; or, lastly, in the pot an feu, or stock pot; then they turn them over and over in a plateful of bread crumbs with a due amount of pepper and salt, and put them by, to repeat both opera- tions after a lapse of about half an hour. The bread crumbs are sometimes mixed with finely-minced parsley and sweet herbs. Minced shallots in small quantity may also be added, and sometimes baked bread crumbs (chapelure) are used instead of plain bread crumbs. Cutlets thus prepared are generally fried, but they may also be broiled. They should be fried, not too brown, in plenty of butter or fat. Cutlets cooked in any of the above forms can be served with a plain clear gravy, a thick brown sauce such as Espagnole, tomato sauce, sauce piquante, Soubise (onion sauce), sauce ravicjotte, tartare, sauce aux corni- chons, sauce Robert, sauce provenyale, sauce Perigueux, maitre dâ€™hotel, &c., &c. They are served also with mashed potatoes, or spinach, and likewise with purees of potatoes, celery, carrots.

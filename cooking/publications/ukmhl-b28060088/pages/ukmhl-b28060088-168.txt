ROUND THE TABLE. 152 To roast fowls and chickens, an onion and a large piece of salted butter should always be put inside them, unless they are otherwise stuffed; and it is best always to tie over their breasts a large slice of fat bacon, which should be removed a short time before they are done. Capons, turkeys, and guinea fowls are best larded, and the two first ought to be furnished with an appropriate stuffing; but all larded poultry should have a piece of buttered paper tied over the larding, to be removed in time to let the larding take colour. Basting with butter is an essential part of the process of roasting poultry, and the fire ought by no means to be so fierce as that for roasting a joint. All white fowls, be they tame or wild, should be roasted slowly. Black poultry, i.e., ducks and geese, re- quire to be quickly roasted, and at a brisk fire. These latter do not require any larding, nor a slice of bacon to be tied over them; but, at the first stage of roasting, it is well to tie a piece of buttered paper over the breast. The basting should be done with butter, and should be almost continuous towards the end of the process; and this applies also to all kinds of wild ducks. The young domestic duck, which it is the traditional custom in this country to eat with peas, is to my mind an insipid viand. Domestic ducks are only fit to eat when they are full grown, and then they should be stewed or braised; and in that form the accompaniment of peas is all very well. But as a roast your skinny domestic duckling is not to be compared to a wild duck. This, however, is a matter of custom as much as of taste; moreoverwheu young ducks are in season, the choice of winged animals for roasts is very limited. Still, quails are in season then, and who would prefer a roast duckling, of the domestic sort, to a roasted quail ? Pheasants and partridges, the former of which ought

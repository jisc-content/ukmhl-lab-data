236 ROUND THE TABLE. Having boiled your maccaroni, place it on a dish with plenty of butter and grated Parmesan cheese, add a little pepper, and sprinkle the top freely with Par- mesan, so as to cover the maccaroni completely; brown with a salamander, and serve very hot. Where no sala- mander is obtainable, judicious exposure to the fire will produce the desired effect; but in any case, care should be taken not to dry up the maccaroni too much, but just to brown the cheese on the top of it. For this dish the maccaroni may be boiled in milk instead of water, and the result will be still more satisfactory. The following is a recipe more suitable to the English taste :—Take two ounces of boiled maccaroni and drain it well; put into a saucepan one ounce of butter, mix it well with one tablespoonful of flour, moisten with four table- spoonfuls of veal stock and a gill of cream; add two ounces of grated Parmesan, one tablespoonful of mustard, salt and cayenne to taste; put in the maccaroni, and serve as soon as it is well mixed with the sauce, and quite hot. Any kind of maccaroni may be served with curries instead of rice; it is also a good garniture for hashed mutton and kindred dishes. The introduction of maccaroni in meat and chicken pies is a great improvement to them, but the king of maccaroni pies is as yet unknown in England, and is thus made: Maccaroni Pie.—Make a short crust with flour, eggs, butter, sugar, and a little salt, roll it to the thickness of the eighth of an inch, and line with it a plain shape previously buttered. Have some large macca- roni boiled and dressed with rau, as described above, some balls of well devised forcemeat, and of sausage meat; some yolks of hard boiled eggs, mushrooms.

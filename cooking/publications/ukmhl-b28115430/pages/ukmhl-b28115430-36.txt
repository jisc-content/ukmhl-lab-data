30 SOURCE OF MUSCULAR STRENGTH. could be supported in this arduous undertaking on fats and amyloids and without nitrogenous food, which could be converted into muscle and then oxygenized. To prepare themselves for the work, for seventeen hours before they commenced their ascent they ate only solid food, composed of starch, fat and sugar, compressed into solid cakes. They began their ascent by the steepest and most dangerous route at 5.30 in the morning, and at twenty minutes past one in the afternoon they had, without fatigue, finished their jour- ney. Now what was the result ? 1. That they had, without a nitrogenous diet, easily accomplished their task. 2. That the amount of nitrogen excreted was one-third less during the hours of vigorous exercise than the hours before and afterward. This not wholly unexpected result was almost conclusive proof that the source of muscular power is mainly found in fats and amyloids, and not in the proteids. Now let us glance at the work done. Fick, weighing 145|- pounds, had climbed 6,417.5 feet high. This was equivalent to raising 933,746 pounds one foot high. Wislicenus, weighing 167.5 pounds, had climbed to the same height, which was equivalent to raising 1,074,931 pounds one foot high. In addition, however, to the mere labor of ascending the mountain, was the labor of the beat- ing of the heart, and respiration. Now, according to the calculations of Bonders, each heart beat is estimated to be equal to raising 4.65 pounds one foot high, and each respira- tion equal to 4.56 pounds one foot high. Let us then add this to the other work done. Fick says that during his ascent the heart beat at the unusual rate of 120 per minute, while his respirations were 25 per minute. There then must be added to the other work for this man 220,968 pounds for heart and respiration work, and if Wislicenus was in the same proportion there must be added for him

Where used, they should be free from adulteration, of the best quality, and of the finest kinds. Pot herbs are used often for condiments, especially for broths and soups.

I find it in the fact that horses and cows love grass which has a taste of salt, and the American bisons make long pilgrimages to lick the salt rocks; in the notorious fact that it kills worms in children. Hence it may be inferred that a certain portion of it is healthful, and preservative from ailments. When instinct and common

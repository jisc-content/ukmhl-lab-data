CHAPTER VI. SOURCE OF MUSCULAR STREMQTH, N a general way we have already shown that our strength of body comes from our food. It is proper now for us to inquire whether it comes from the proteids, fats, amyloids, or salts. Liebig taught us that all muscular strength exerted was at the expense, the breaking down, using up, metamor- phosis, or oxydation of the muscular tissue. So much mus- cle destroyed, so much strength exerted. Now 2Jroteids, that is, the albumen, fibrin, gluten in our food go to make up muscular structure; and Liebig taught, and all physiolo- gists accepted his doctrine, that during exercise the des- truction of the muscles was the source of the strength exer- ted. This would be very much like a theory that a saw-mill received all its power to saw logs from the wear and tear of itself. His theory made it necessary that the proteids of our food should be converted into muscle, and then during exertion destroyed, new proteids constantly, during rest, being converted into muscle for further use. Liebig also taught that the fats and amyloids were only necessary to supply heat for the body; but it seemed never to have entered his head that they were the source of muscular power. In the present state of science this is all changed. Now the muscles are not regarded as the source of strength, but the vehicle to convey or exert it. In exercise they are not metamorphosed, or oxydized, or used up to an extent BuflScient to account for all the strength; but their destruc-

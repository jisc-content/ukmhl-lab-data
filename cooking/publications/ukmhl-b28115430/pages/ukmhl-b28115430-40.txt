THE DAILY WANTS OF THE BODY, 34 of these different elements, and also mineral matter. This is no easy task. Science may aid ns in the decision, but we must rely largely on good judgment and instinct, provided the former is instructed by science and the latter not per- verted by bad habits and depraved tastes. Science teaches, according to Letheby, that the best pro- portions of food for the body are, of fat, nine parts; of flesh-forming material, twenty-two parts; and of starch and sugar, sixty-nine parts. To this the same author adds, that when we eat of a food which is deficient in any necessary ingredient, we generally combine with it another, which contains an excess of it. For instance, we combine bread with butter, lean meat with potatoes, salad with eggs. On the other hand, we should never mix together a great variety of foods containing an excess of carbonaceous matter, and a deficiency of nitrogenous. DISTEIBUTION" OF MEALS. As a general rule, savages eat when they can get food. If it is abundant, they eat nearly all the day long; if it is scarce, they live on one meal a day. They are like ani- mals in this respect. They are as little injured by it as the cow or horse that grazes from morn till night on the sweet grass of the pasture. Civilized beings must not do this, because their mental and physical labors would seriously interfere with the processes of digestion. As a rule, three meals a day are best for most persons, though two meals are ample, and better for some. It depends on the kind of food, rapidity of digestion, and work done, how often we should eat. Our meals should be so arranged as not to offend the taste and burden the digestive powers. BAD DIETETIC HABITS. We suppose there is no doubt but at least half the ill health of the world comes from improper eating.

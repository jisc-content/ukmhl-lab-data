26 VALUES OF FOOD. comparative value of foods to support strength, multiply the above figures by this sum. It must not be supposed, how- ever, that these figures are yet fixed beyond improvement, though it is certain they are very nearly correct. It is, of course, understood that when these values are got out of foods, they must all be digested, and completely absorbed and converted into nutriment; and this is never done. No invention ever made is so perfect as this. The human body, perfect as we think it is when in robust health, is not perfect enough to get all the virtue out of food. A working diet of 4|- ounces of perfectly dry nitrogenous mat- ter, and 22|- ounces of dry carbonaceous matter—equivalent to a daily allowance of some six pounds of ordinary food— possesses, theoretically, a working value sufficient to raise 10,874,136 pounds one foot high, yet the most work that can actually be got out of this amount of food is—includ- ing the beating of the heart, and respiration—not over 1,610,206 pounds. From this it will be seen that there is a vast difference between the theoretical and the actual value of food in work. No allowance, however, is here made for the food used up in thought, in feeling, emotion, and the molecular movements of the body. This cannot, in the present state of science, be calculated—if it ever can. It has been found by experiments on a large number of men, that the carbonic acid exhaled and urea secreted daily in the amount of food mentioned above, really should sup- ply force sufficient to raise 7,720,000 pounds one foot high, while the actual work is only about one-sixth of this amount. What becomes of the other force ? Is it lost, or used up in mental and molecular labor, which cannot be measured? It must be the latter. AN INTERESTING COMPARISON.

27 VALUES OF FOOD. actual power of the fuel is realized in work. The human machine is therefore more economical of its force than a steam engine; in fact it is assumed by Heidenham that less than half the force applied to the living muscles, as it is developed in their tissues, is realized. But although the animal machine is so much more economical of force than the steam engine, yet on account of the costliness of its food (fuel), it is far more expensive.” Taking, for example, a steam engine of one-horse power, it will take two horses to do the same work for ten hours a day, or twenty-four men.

THE DAILY WANTS OF THE BODY. 35 An excess of carbonaceous food promotes the formation of fat, and prevents the complete nourishment of the muscles. It gives a person bulk, but not strength. Vital power is deficient in very fat people. An excess of nitrogenous food gives rise to diseases of a plethoric character—apoplexy, fevers, etc., etc. Too little food, we all know, impoverishes the blood, and gives rise to feebleness and starvation. Nothing will so soon derange the brain and the nervous system as a low diet. The salts in our food must neither be in excess nor de- ficient. Man cannot live without them any more than without the elements which go to form flesh or give heat. So too goitre and cretinism are caused by certain minerals in the water. There is much to be discovered on this subject. I.—GENERAL STATISTICS.

IIKCIPES. 96 SriNACn "WITH Eggs.—Wash the spinach leaves in several waters, and keep in cold water until time to cook it. Then put in boiling water enough to cover it, and add a little salt. Cover the pan, and boil the spinach briskly until the leaves are tender ; they will sink when done. Then press the water out, cut the spinach fine, put it in the pan, season with butter, and serve hot. Have the eggs ready poached, lay them on the spinach, and mix well with it. This is a delicious dish, and seasonable in the spring of the year. Gem and Cheese Sandwiches.—Toast good cheese lightly; split wheatmeal gems in halves, and spread between two halves, so as to come to the edges allround, a slice of the toasted cheese. It makes a wholesome and palatable lunch ; children are fond of it. Some ob- ject to toasted cheese. The principal objection to it is that it is gen- erally toasted too much. If toasted dry, it is as hard to digest as a very hard-boiled egg. Another objection is, that it is too often eaten as a dessert with rich pie and cake, instead of with the principal part of the meal.

THE AMYLOIDS. 18 ill the gastric and pancreatic juices. They give a soluble form to those substances which would otherwise be semi- fluid, like glue or jelly. They maintain this fluidity in the blood that it may circulate through the arteries and veins and capillaries. It is very curious, but probably true, that as the nutrient material leaves the blood and is converted into tissue, this too is done by means of the help of the mineral constituents of the blood. In the blood, which is alkaline, the proteids remain fluid; but in the flesh, which is acid, they lose their fluidity and become solid. Then, again, when any tissue is worn out and must be re- moved from the system, it needs become fluid again, and this is accomplished by the action of mineral substances. Letheby says : “ As to the special functions of each of the saline (or mineral) constituents of food, little can be said ; but it is a remarkable fact that the alkaline (or basic) phos- phate of soda is invariably found in the blood, while the acid phosphate of potash is the chief constituent of the juice of flesh; and,” he continues, “ most likely the former is con- cerned in preserving the liquid condition of albumen and flbrin, and so keeping them from being lost by secretion, while the latter is engaged in an opposite duty.” The following table will show the relative amounts of dif- ferent minerals in human blood: Phosphoric acid 31.79 Alkalies 55.66 Alkaline earths 3.33 Mineral acids and oxide of iron 9.22 100.00 Just how much of each mineral our food should contain for each day is not so easy to answer; but Dr. Edward Smith says that a full-grown man requires daily from 32 to 79 grains of phosphoric acid, 51 to 175 of chlorine (equal to

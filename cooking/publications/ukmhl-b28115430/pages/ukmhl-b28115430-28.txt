MINERAL MATTER. 22 without salt. We are, however, inclined to believe that there is a good deal of extravagance of statement in all such stories. At any rate, what is true of savages and of animals, whose choice of food is narrow and meagre, is no rule for civilized beings who have a great variety of food, rich in mineral matter. Moreover, we have known many persons to refuse to eat salt with their food for weeks and months, and declare they were improved by abstinence from it. We are of the opinion that while a moderate use of salt may be advisable, most people eat far too much of it; in this way corrupting the appetite and taste, and taxing to far too great an extent the excretory organs in getting rid of it. Then, too, those who live on foods rich in mineral matter would naturally need less of this mineral. So, too, a con- stantly improving agriculture improves our foods. By using salt largely on certain crops as a fertilizer they may probably be made to contain more of it, and thus it will be introduced into our systems as a constituent of our food, and not as a condiment. That its use on almost everything, and the un- savoriness of foods without it, is a mere habit, and not an instinct, cannot be doubted. In using salt, therefore, we advise moderation. Learn to use some articles of diet without it, and others with but little; and make up for any deficiency of this article by such foods as are rich in mineral matter, of such kinds as are im- portant in the animal economy. CONDIMENTS. A discussion of foods and drinks which should omit con- diments would be very incomplete. According to Dr. Letheby, â€œ they are merely stimulants of the digestive organs, promoting the flow of saliva, gastric juice, and other intestinal secretions, and increasing the peristaltic movement of the viscera. Thus they aid in the processes of digestion, and by giving flavor to the food they whet the appetite and

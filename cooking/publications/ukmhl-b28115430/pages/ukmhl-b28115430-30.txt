And here we find that the gastric juice is reported to us as containing muriatic acid, for which salt, being muriate of soda, gives a supply. Besides, salt is one of the ingredients of blood. Thus salt is really food, though any excess of it is of course mischievous. “ But that vegetarians should sweepingly renounce vege- table condiments comes to me as a paradox.

Salt and butter are their ordinary demand, and then they call it pilau (pro- nounced pildiv). The English generally expect milk with it, or milk and sugar. All watery vegetables seem to need some condiment. Salt may suffice, but it is difficult to understand why other tasty articles are to be banished from our tables.”

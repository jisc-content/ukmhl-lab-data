CLASSIFICATION OF ALIMENTS. 12 THE FATS AND THEIR FUNCTION, OR USE. The fats are, in the scientific works on food, called hydro- carbons. They contain some oxygen, but never enough to satisfy the affinities of the carbon and hydrogen. For this reason they are powerful generators of heat. An ounce of fat burned in the fire generates a large amount of heat. An equal weight of it when burned will produce two and a half times as much heat as dry starch, or sugar. Some idea of its wonderful heating properties may be gained by the fact that ten grains of fat burned so as to save all its heat, will raise the temperature of twenty-three pounds of water one degree. This is sufficient to raise 18,000 pounds weight one foot high. Their two great uses, then, are first, to maintain animal heat; and second, to generate force. It is very easy to see how it does the former, by burning in the body; but how heat be- comes force is not so easy to see. That it does in the steam- engine is evident, and the same is true in the body. The man who does a hard dayâ€™s work, does so by virtue of the fact that he is, so far as his labor is concerned, an engine. The muscles do not furnish the strength, they only transmit it. The wheels of the engine do not furnish the strength, that is the power behind them. Not only the heat of the body, but the working power of it, is largely due to the con- sumption of fat. (The reader must not confound fat with fat meat alone, butter is a fat, and so are oils and oily nuts.) Still another use of fats is that, like the proteids, when taken into the body, they enter into its structure, forming in all cases an essential part of muscle, nerve, brain, and other organs; and also entering largely into the adipose tissue. Besides these important and principal functions of fat, it has minor uses in the processes of digestion, assimilation, and nutrition, and, it is believed, in the formation of bile. Food digests more readily if fat is mixed with it. It also

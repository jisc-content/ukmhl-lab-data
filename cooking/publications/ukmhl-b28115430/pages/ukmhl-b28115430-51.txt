CHAPTER II. CHOICE TKEATMEHT OF FOODS. IN the choice of foods we cannot exercise too much care. It is cheaper to procure only the very best articles. All vegetables and fruits should be grown on the best soils, and the fertilizers used should be well decomposed and not fresh and rank. Partially decayed food of whatever kind, should be avoided. For breads, the best white wheat is none too good. If grown in new soil it is likely to be better and to contain abundance of the mineral matter so needful to health. Fruits for eating without cooking should be ripe, tender and not too tart; while those for cooking may be either sweet or sour, but they must possess the peculiar quality of retaining when cooked their best flavors. All woody fibres must be removed from fruits and vegetables be- fore eating. Potatoes should be fresh and rip6—old ones are less wholesome, especially when they have been exposed to the light and air, and bruised by much handling, or long exposed to the cold. Animal food should be chosen with gi’eat caution. Only healthy animals should be used for eating. They should neither be too old nor too young, too fat nor too lean. In butchering, all the blood should be removed from the body, as otherwise the flesh putrefies readily. It should be thorough- ly cooled before eating. It is also desirable that the animal be not killed for several hours after eating or after fatigue. The long journeys animals are sent on crowded, filthy cars, render their flesh unwholesome. They ought to be butchered far away from the city and the meat transported in refriger- ator cars, for city use.

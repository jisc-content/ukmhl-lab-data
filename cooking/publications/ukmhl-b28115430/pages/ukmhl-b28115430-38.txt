CHAPTER VII. THE DAILY WANTS OF THE BODY. The requirements of the body vary with age, sex, occupa- tion, health, work done, climate, and race. Therefore any attempt to decide just how much any person should eat would be fruitless. Still some facts may be useful and in- structive. In the first place it may be stated that as a general rule a healthy man requires from 700 to 800 pounds of perfectly dry food in a year. This amounts to about two pounds of solid matter daily. In addition to this are re- quired from five to six pounds of fluid. So, again, a man cannot live well on the meagre diet of a pound of bread daily, with water, but will become thin and weak. It is said that the poor needle-women of London almost starve on a daily allowance of a pound and a half of bread and an ounce and a half of butter daily. It is well known that farm laborers have a good appetite and eat heartily. Dr. Edward Smith made inquiries into the food allowance of some hundreds of families in Eng- land, Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, and formed the following tables: AVERAGE DAILY DIET OF FARM LABORERS IN GREAT BRITAIN.

Butter, fat meat, vege- table and animal oils, oily nuts, etc., etc., are of this class. They are also called hydro-carbons. The amyloids include starch, dextrine, sugar and gums. They are also non-nitrogenous and hydro-carbons; but the hydrogen and oxygen are in the form of water, while in the fats the oxygen is not in sufficient quantity to satisfy the affinity of the hydrogen. The minerals are water and certain salts of alkalies, and other substances, such as go to make up the bones and teeth, They act as regulators of nutrition. None, however, of these substances alone will perfectly

33 THE DAILY WANTS OF THE BODY. Dr. Playfair, who also made extensive observations in the same field of inquiry, gives in his valuable work the follow- ing table: DAILY DIET ACCORDING TO WORK DONE. Flesh-formers. Fat. starch and sugar. Subsistence diet ... 2.0 0.5 12.0 Quietude 2.0 1.0 12.0 Moderate exercise.. 4.2 1.8 18.7 Active labor 5.5 2.5 20.0 Hard work 2.5 20.0 According to Voit and Pettenkofer, an adult working- man requires daily five ounces of nitrogenous matter and twenty-three ounces of carbonaceous matter (calculated as starch). According to Liebig, the Bavarian wood-choppers, wdio live five and a half days in the forests, are allowed three and a half pounds of fat, eight pounds of meal, and four and a half pounds of bread for five daysâ€™ rations. This equals four and one-third ounces of nitrogenous matter and fifty ounces of carbonaceous matter. The Russian peasant has his yearly rations apportioned to equal five and two-thirds ounces of nitrogenous matter and forty-two and a half of carbona- ceous. The Chinese laborer eats daily four and two-thirds ounces of dry nitrogenous and thirty-six and one-third ounces of carbonaceous. These statements will not, perhaps, enlighten our readers much, unless they carry them further. This, however, is certain, the working-man requires about six times as much carbonaceous food as nitrogenous. Children, however, who have bodies to build up, require a larger proportion of nitro- genous; and so do those who are run down in flesh, and need building up, while, on the other hand, those who suffer from a lack of animal heat, require perhaps more carbonaceous. Now it becomes a matter of some importance how we are to eat, so as to combine in our foods the right proportions

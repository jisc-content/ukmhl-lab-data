CLASSIFICATION OF ALIMENTS. 13 I I)lays an important part in the formation of cells, blood corpuscles, and even the generation of blood. It is present in large quantities in the tubules of the nerves; and in all the nervous centers serves some highly important function in nervous action. Indeed the distribution of it in every tissue and its accu- mulation around certain organs, serves to fill up the cavities of the body and give roundness to the form, equalizes the external pressure, and diminishes friction; and, by its bad conducting property, retains animal heat. Fat, therefore, must ever be regarded as highly important to the physical development of the body, and any system of diet that ex- cludes it is faulty and to be condemned. An interesting case of the evil efiects of the non-use of fats was recently brought to our notice. A gentleman of education and refinement, in rather feeble health, put him- self under the care of a physician who ordered him to ab- stain from all butter, sugar, salt, milk and meat, and to live exclusively on farinaceous articles and fruits. The result was that he lost rapidly in flesh and strength, and soon took to his bed. The physician insisting that he would in the end be better for this course, advised him to continue it. The patient thinking that hickory nuts were not forbidden, purchased a quantity and ate freely of them. Being very rich in fatty matter, they supplied the place of butter and fat meat perfectly, and he soon became much better and be- lieved he had made a great discovery in the dietetic value of this nut. We may add, this nut is excellent food for those who can digest it and for those who abstain from animal fats it will often prove to be very valuable. Where oily foods are not used, the proteids exist in excess in the blood, and furnish more nitrogen than can be used. The result is that the system is poisoned and seriously suffers.

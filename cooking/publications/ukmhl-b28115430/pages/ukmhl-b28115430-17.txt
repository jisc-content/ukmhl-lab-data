CLASSIFICATION OF ALIMENTS. 11 nourish the body. All of them must he present. The food which Nature has provided for the newborn babe is the only one which perfectly illustrates a combination of them all. 1. The curd of milk is o. proteid. 2. The cream or butter of milk is a fat. 3. The sugar of milk is an amyloid. 4. The water, magnesium, potassium, iron, sodium, lime, phosphorus, etc., are the minerals. Is this not simple and beautiful ? How perfectly good milk nourishes the young. If in after years, when we eat and drink what we please, we were to choose food so wisely adapted to our wants as the Creator does for the child, it would save much suffering. THE PROTEIDS. Now let us look at the functions of the different kinds of food. This subject is not so well understood as we wish it was; still what is known will help to decide somewhat as to the choice of articles of diet. First in the list come the proteids. What is their function in the body? One point at least seems settled, that their chief value is to construct and repair the tissues of the body. The nerves, the muscles, the glands, the secretions of the mouth, stomach and ali- mentary canal which help to transform our food, are all pro^ teids. Parke says that every structure in the body in which any form of force is manifested, as heat, electricity, or mechan- ical action, is mainly built up of these proteids. This is so the world over. May we not, then, safely conclude, that the main function of the proteids is to build up and repair cer- tain tissues of the body ? It is also believed that by oxidation they develop some heat, and a small portion of the strength of the frame. If the proteids are cut off the functions of the body languish. If we wish to increase the power of the body to do work, we must invariably increase the consump- tion of proteids.

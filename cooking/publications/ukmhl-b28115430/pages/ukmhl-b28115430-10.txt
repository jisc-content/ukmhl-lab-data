PREFACE. 4 It is suggested that in the use of Recipes, a reasonable amount of brains be mixed with them. The best wUl prove failures in careless hands. Food, to be well cooked, must be under the eye of a thought- ful person. It will not cook itself. It must be magnetized, so to speak, by a living force, and Recipes must often be somewhat varied to suit individual tastes and circumstances. The editor also suggests, that those who read this book experiment and invent new methods of their own. He will gladly print the results in the Herald of Health. , As to the other departments, it is hoped that they will furnish numerous and acceptable hints for correct eating and drinking. Should they not, the Authorâ€™s hopes will not be realized. M. L. H. New York, October 1, 1874.

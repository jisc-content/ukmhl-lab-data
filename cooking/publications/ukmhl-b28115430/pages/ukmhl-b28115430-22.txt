THE AMYLOIDS. 16 But tlie amyloids have other important uses in the sys tern besides the generation of heat. In the first place, they may be converted into fat, and stored up in the system for future use. This has been abundantly proved by numerous experiments. Perhaps as good an illustration of its truth is the one familiar to most, that the negroes of the South al- ^vays become fat from the sweets they eat during the season for gathering the cane and manufacturing its juice into sugar. Indeed, it is generally thought that most, if not all, of the fat of the system is produced from the amyloids of the food we consume. Other uses still remain for the amy- loids. In the processes of digestion and circulation, they are converted into lactic acid, found both in the stomach and in the flesh, and into butyric, formic, and acetic acids, found in the sweat. These acids have their uses in the vari- ous reactions of the fluids of the systemâ€”the blood being alkaline, while most of the secretions are acid. They also assist in the solution of effete matter in the system, and ren- der it more easy of removal. MINERAL MATTER. The bodies of men and animals contain a very con- siderable amount of mineral matter, and this comes from the food we eat. Minerals constitute one of the important divisions of food as now divided. The bones and teeth are largely composed of mineral matter. They also constitute an important element of the blood, and of many of the secre- tions. Nearly every tissue contains a small amount of min- eral matter. The principal minerals of the body are calcium (the base of lime), magnesium, potassium (base of potash), sodium (base of soda), iron, chlorine, phosphorus, and sul- phur; water is also included in this list. The minerals are equally important with the proteids, fats, and amyloids. Lime, chiefly in the form of phosphate, is absent from no

PEEFAOE. The Author and Editor of this little work sends it on its mission with the earnest hope that in some degree it may prove useful and acceptable. He would like to acknowledge his obligations to those who have aided him in his labors in the department of Recipes, by a mention of their names, but those to whom he is most indebted do not desire thus to be brought before the public. He may say this, however, that they are one and all practical experimenters and deeply interested in the subject of preparing wholesome and pal- atable food for our tables. Not one of all the number is a mere theorizer, but could, if need be, themselves cook a most delicious and healthful meal. He also begs to acknowledge his indebtedness to several Health Cookery Books, both English and American. Many of the best Recipes, however, are those which have oeen tried in our own kitchen, where they have stood the test of almost constant use for years. It will be observed that no Recipes are given for cooking meat or fancy dishes, but our apology for this is, that there is no necessity for doing so. Such Recipes are found in abundance in nearly every cookery book, and this is not intended so much to supplant these books as to supplement them.

15 Laight Street, New-York. Climates for Invalids, Etc. BY LEBY^RB BIBB, Author of'''‘A Winter in Florida." * • This work has been prepared with unusual care, and is designed for nearly every class of invalids requiring a change of climate, and especially for those alllicted with iveak lungs. The volume treats of the climates of the following places, well known for their high sanitary repute, namely; Minnesota, California, Florida, Nassau, and Fayal. The chief part of the work is devoted, however, to the State oi Minnesota, treating of its climate, physical structure, together with some of the principal causes of debility, with hints on getting well and keeping well. The Chi'istian Union, edited by Henry Ward Beecher, speaks enthusi- astically of this book as follows: “Minnesota for most people, Florida for delicate temperaments, where disease has a mental origin, afford the best climates, in the author’s opinion, for those who are stricken with consump- tion or allied maladies. In justifying this view, the author enters upon climatic considerations with enthusiasm and knowledge. Indeed, we have seldom read of a book of this kind, so delightful in its general methods, so full of newly- collated facts, and so scientifically entertaining. The author’s advice to in- valids as to physical means of recovery is excellent, and altogether the volume is one of genuine merit.” It is advertised in another colmnn, and may be had at the bookstores, or sent by mail on receipt of price. • ♦ • TABLE OF CONTENTS.

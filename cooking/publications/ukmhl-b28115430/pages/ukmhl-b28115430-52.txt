46 CHOICE TREATMENT OP POODS. The treatment of animal food is a matter of importance. Why do we cook it at all? First, to render it more pleasing to the sight; second, to develope its best flavors; and third to render it digestible and palatable. Flesh cooked too much is rendered innutritions and indigestible; if cooked too little, it is disagreeable eating. The albumen of flesh coagu- lates at 133° F., and the coloring matter is coagulated and destroyed at about 170° F., says Liebig, and he would never have flesh subjected to a higher temperature than this, except for a few minutes after it is put into the pot, when it may be submitted to a temperature of boiling water in order to coagulate the albumen into a sort of crust on the outside to hold in the flavors that might otherwise be evaporated. In roasting meat, also, let the heat at first be high, and gradually decreased to the boiling point for the same reason. Stewed meats are more wholesome and nutritious than any other. The process renders flesh tender and succulent and easy of digestion. Letheby says, “ all kinds of tongue and strong flavored meats may be cooked with advantage in this manner. The process is, moreover, susceptible of very delicate treatment of flavorless foods.”

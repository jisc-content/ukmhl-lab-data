When is the best time to eat fruit? Ans.—Most writers advise that fruit should always be eaten as a part of the regular meal ; but we believe tliat from an hour before to an hour after quite as good a time as any.

In good healtli they may be eaten moderately at any time when they are demanded. Fruits are more of a drink than food. Children in health may have fruit most freely, but should not eat it just before going to bed. If it causes flatulence, eat less of it.

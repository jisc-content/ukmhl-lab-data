Proper selection of food. 2. Best treatment of food as regards cooking, flavoring, and serving. 3. Proper variety of food, with occasional change of diet. 4. Moderate exercise; warmth and a genial state of mind. 5. Abundance of sleep. 6. Pleasant social surroundings at the table. 7. Thorough mastication. 8. Regularity in eating, and proper intervals between meals.

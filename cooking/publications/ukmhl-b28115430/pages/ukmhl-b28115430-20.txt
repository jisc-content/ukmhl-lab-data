CHAPTER III. THE AMYLOIDS, HE word “ amyloid ” is from two Greek words, which, taken together, signify “ resembling starch.” The prin- cipal amyloids are starch in its various forms, as arrow-root, corn-starch, potato-starch, etc.; sugar in the form of grape- sugar, milk-sugar, cane-sugar; honey and cellulose. Cellu- lose is the woody substance of plants, after all other mat- ter in their composition is dissolved and washed away. The amyloids, like the fats, discussed in the last chapter, are destitute of nitrogen, and are composed of only oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon. They are the true hydro-carbons. (A hydro-carbon is a substance in which the hydrogen and oxygen are in the proportion to form water; and, to make the matter perfectly simple, we might call them water-car- bons—hydro meaning water.) Liebig divided foods into two great classes, nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous, and fats and amyloids come under the latter head; but as they are very different in their chemical composition, and in their uses, they have more recently been subdivided. Liebig thought their use was to support animal heat, and this they do to a certain extent; but, as before remarked, they do not equal the fats in this respect. The reason of this is, that the fats contain a great deal of hydrogen in excess of what, with its oxygen, forms water, and this excess, when burned, helps to maintain heat. The following table will make this clear:

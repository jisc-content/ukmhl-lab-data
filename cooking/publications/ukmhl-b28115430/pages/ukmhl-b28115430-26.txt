The value of this mineral has been stoutly denied by a few modern hygienists, and there will be no doubt many readers of this book inclined to take this view of the question, and perhaps many of them never use it. It is not our intention to enter into any discussion on this subject, but to present briefly the points in its favor put forward by those who maintain that it has a normal relation to the healthy action of the body. Salt does not enter into the composition of the tissues, but it is a large constituent of every one of the secretions, the saliva, gastric juice, bile and sweat, and exists in the blood in larger amounts than any other mineral matter. Indeed, about one-half of the mineral matter of the blood is salt. This amount in the blood cannot be much increased. If one should use a very large amount of it with his food, any excess beyond a certain amount is immediately thrown out in the excretions. Letheby says: “ It is a curious fact that common salt has the faculty of forming crystallizable com- , pounds with most of the organized and effete constituents of the body; ” and inquires, “ May it not therefore be an im- portant agent of diffusion; and be thus concerned in the phenomena of absorption and secretion ? for albumen and fibrin cannot pass through the walls of the intestines, or the blood-vessels. It may well be that through the agency of common salt and the free acid of the gastric juice, they

15 THE AMYLOIDS. CALOKIFIC POWER OF TEN" GRAINS OF THE SUBSTANCE IN ITS NATURAL STATE. Lbs. of water raised 1Â° P. Grape sugar 8.42 Lump sugar 8.61 Arrow-root 10.06 Butter 18.60 Beef fat 20.91 From the above instructive table it will be seen that fat is over twice as valuable a beat-producing agent as starch. This might be inferred by throwing an ounce of each into the fire, and noticing the difierence in the amount of blaze they produce. There is also the same difference in the amount of work these substances will do when burned, as the following table will show: MOTIVE POWER OF TEN GRAINS OF THE SUBSTANCE IN ITS NATURAL STATE. Lbs. lifted one foot high. Grape sugar 6,500 Lump sugar 6,647 Arrow-root 7,766 Butter 14,441 Beef fat 16,142 That the above may be made perfectly clear, it must be understood that any substance which, when burned, will heat a pound of water one degree, will, by another mode of action, raise 772 pounds one foot high. This seems marvel- ous at first sight; but the marvel will disappear when we consider the wonderful power that a little coal generates in the engine of an ocean steamer, and in this case much of the power is lost, as no engine has yet been made perfect enough to save all the force generated by the fire under the boiler.

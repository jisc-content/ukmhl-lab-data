8 FUNCTIONS OF FOOD. exercise and sleep,insures a far greater size and development than when the food is scanty. Farmers sometimes, by feed- ing, produce enormous development of the bodies of oxeUi sheep, and other animals. This abnormal development, how ■ ever, is not desirable in human beings, and should not be sought for; but a normal development is desirable, and is the legitimate aim of every parent for his child, and person for himself. 2. Still another function of food is to supply the waste that goes on in the body from its daily wear and tear. This varies greatly with different persons, and with the amount of work done. Great workers wear out and use up every day several pounds of the blood and tissues of the body. New food is demanded to take its place, to make good this loss. Those who work but little require less food. A month of sickness sometimes wastes away a third of the weight of the body. The patient becomes thin, emaciated and bony. But a. hearty appetite and plenty to eat soon restore it to its full size. There are some men of powerful frames who, if they do a hard day’s work, waste many pounds of their avoirdupois, and must eat as much to make it up. Small workers, and lazy, idle people eat less; and there are a few, mainly corseted and inactive young women, and foppish, idle young men, who waste very little of the tissue of the body by effort, and consequently eat but little. It is, then, no bad sign to see healthy people eat heartily—they must do it to work and live. 3. Still another function of food is to maintain animal heat. So important a function is this, that it has been com- puted that four-fifths of the food of the body is used to maintain its temperature of nearly one hundred degrees. If any one would appreciate the heat-producing power of his food, let him in cold weather go Avithout eating for a day and still continue exposing himself to the Aveathcr, and he will learn that a good meal will do more to warm his body

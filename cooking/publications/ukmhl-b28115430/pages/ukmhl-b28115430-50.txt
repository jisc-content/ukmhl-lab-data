44 RECEIPTS AND GENERAL DIRECTIONS. ORDER. 4. Cleanliness and order should prevail throughout the domain of the kitchen. SIMPLICITY. 5. Mr. William Horrel says, “ Simplicity is a virtue which has almost grown out of fashion, especially in relation to food and cooking. You can scarcely sit down anywhere to a good plain meal, and find everything simple. Even our dietetic reformers have much to learn in this respect, before the full amount of the good their system contains can be enjoyed by them. All that'pertains to the science of cooking, on physiological principles, is easily accomplished. The real object of cooking should be to increase the quantity, and improve the quality of food; to render it more economi- cal and physiological. This is best accomplished by simplicity. It saves money, time, and health. Variety may still be ke^Dt up to almost any extent, without complexity, by taking one kind one day, or at one meal, and another on the next day.”

AMYLOIDS. FATS. MINERALS. Such a body would lose in 24 hours—of water, about 40,000 grains, or 6 lbs.; of other matters, about 14,500 grains, or over 2 lbs.; among which of carbon 4,000 grains; of nitrogen 300 grains; of mineral matters 400 grains; and would part, per diem, with as much heat as would raise 8,700 lbs. of water from 0 degree to 1 degree Fahr., which is equivalent to 3,000 foot-tons. Such a body ought to do as much work as is equal to 450 foot-tons. The losses would occur through various organs, thus—by Water. Other matter. N. C. grs. grs. gre. grs.

THE AMYLOIDS. 17 tissue. No cell growth can go on without it. Lime and magnesia are necessary to bone growth. Potash and soda, combined in the form of phosphates and chlorides, are important. They are thought to be concern- ed in the molecular currents. They form parts of nearly all tissues. Potash seems to constitute an important part of the formed tissues, while soda is contained in the fluids that bathe them. Chlorine and phosphoric acid exist in considerable quan- tities. Chlorine is found combined with sodium, and also in a most important acid, the hydrochloric; and has a spe- cial action on the proteids. The phosphoric acid produces important actions with the alkalies. Nearly all food con- tains them. Iron is found in all foods, and is an important constituent of red blood corpuscles, and in the coloring matter of red flesh. A small amount of iron is found in nearly every tissue. Sulphur and phosphorus exist, in the tissues as important constituents of the proteids, or albuminates. Silica is present in the integuments, the hair, nails, etc., and in the lower animals is more important than in man. It has been one of the most difficult problems of physiol- ogists to discover the uses of some of the minerals of the blood. It was easy enough to discover the uses of lime to build up the bones and teeth; but the other minerals had uses more difficult to find out. Even yet there is doubt and uncertainty about it. Still much is known, and it is pretty certain that the mineral constituents of blood are largely concerned in the constant changes going on in the body. In the first place, the food, as it goes into the stomach for digestion, could never be digested or absorbed through the microscopic absorbing vessels if not rendered perfectly fluid, and this is done by the minerals contained

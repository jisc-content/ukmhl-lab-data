PEACTICAL DIETETICS. 152 cepts are wise and judicious, and its hints and receipts valuable. In conclusion, let the writer urge on the reader the necessity for his mak- ing the subject of which this work treats a study. l3o not trust to find out all you need to know from your doctor, your parents, or your friends, or even the ordinary cook-books, but delve into the science of dietetics. On it hangs, to a greater extent than is believed, the future of our race—well fed, they will reach a higher civilization—better health, greater beauty, and more happiness, than illy fed. Guard ever against excess, and avoid the extremes—either great abstemious- ness or gluttony. With these words the author bids the reader an affectionate farewell.

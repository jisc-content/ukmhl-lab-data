CHAPTEE VIII. DIGESTION. T is well to conclude this portion of our work with a brief account of the manner in which foods are converted into nutriment. Digestion is a process of washing or rinsing from food those substances needed for the nourishment and maintenance of the body. It begins in the mouth. During each twenty-four hours the salivary glands pour into this cavity—mainly during mastication—about three and a half pounds of saliva. This contains nearly half an ounce of solid matter, and less than a quarter of an ounce of ptyaline, which is its active principle. Saliva dilutes the food and the ptyaline acts on its starch, converting a portion of it into sugar. It is calculated that one part of ptyaline will convert 8,000 parts of starch into sugar. It produces no action on fat or albumen. Where the food is well chewed the saliva is more thoroughly mixed with it, the starch more completely converted, and digestion more perfect. The food passes from the mouth into the stomach when it meets another digestive fluid, the gastric juice. It lias been estimated that a healthy stomach secretes fourteen pounds of gastric juice daily, which contains less than half a pound of solid matter, and two-thirds of an ounce of pepsin, the active agent of digestion. The gastric juice converts all the soluble albumen and fibrin of food into liquid albumen and fibrin, which differs in many particulars from common albumen, more especially in this that it is capable of being passed through animal membrane by absorption, which al- bumen is not. The power of this pepsin in the pres-

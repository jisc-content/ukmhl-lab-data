149 rHACTICAL DIETETICS. grow good sweet potatoes requires a liglit, warm, porous soil, and a proper degree and continuance of summer heat. Planted in ground of a compact, retentive nature, they become watery, insii^id, heavy, and quite unfit for human food. Their fine qualities are often impaired likewise by rough, careless handling, and by exposure to cold. They should be gathered when fully ripe, and only on a clear day. Allow them to lie exposed to the sun for a few hours to become dry; then place them in clean barrels or boxes, handling them carefully as if they were eggs; store them in a dry place where the temperature will be pretty uniform, never lower than 45®, and they will keep fresh and good all the year round. Owing to the large amount of starch and sugar in their composition, they may be regarded as constituting a rich and valuable food. When properly grown and cooked they are delicious, wholesome, and satisfying. If eaten in an unripe state they are apt to produce flatulence. ANALYSES OP FOODS.

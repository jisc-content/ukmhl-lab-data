SOURCE OF MUSCULAR STRENGTH. 31 257,706 pounds. Adding tliese sums together we have the work done as follows : Pick, in 5|- hoursâ€™ work, 1,154,714 pounds raised one foot high; Wislicenus 1,332,727 pounds one foot high. Now the amount of urea excreted in Pick shows a destruction of muscle which, perfectly oxygenized, would only have raised 498,525 pounds one foot, while Wislicenus shows the des- truction of even less, namely sufficient to only raise 481,618 pounds one foot high. These results show conclusively that, in their cases at least, by far the larger source of mus- cular strength was derived, not from the destruction of muscle and nitrogenous food, but from the destruction of fats and amyloids; the proportion being about two-thirds of the latter to one-third of the former. Kecent experiments confirm the general result of those above given. Prom an economical point of vieAv, these re- sults are interesting. If the source of muscular strength is entirely the destruction of muscular tissue, then the labor of assimilation, the constant repair of destroyed muscle would be very much greater than economy would dictate, for all the nitrogenous food would have to be converted into muscle before available. But if the source of strength is largely fatty and amylaceous matter, then much is saved, for they become oxydized and give out their virtues in the capillaries when they meet the oxygen. Whether brain and nerve energy has the same origin is not yet settled, but there is little doubt that, to a certain extent, they have; though it is likely the addition of phos- phorus, and perhaps other substances, are necessary for this work. The practical value of these facts might be very great, if properly applied. We shall discuss this point as we proceed.

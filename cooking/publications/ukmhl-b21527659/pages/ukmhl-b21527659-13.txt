They may also be cut in two lengths instead of four, and these divided into fifteen small pieces, and then, with a paste-cutter, formed into crescents. The ingredients, and the proper quantities for this cake, are as follows:—six ounces of flour, the same of powder-sugar, three ounces of sweet and liitteralmonds, six yolks, and tivo whole eggs, six ounces of butter, two of sugar mixed with the whites of two eggs whipped, four ouncesof cutalmonds added to the sugar and eggs, a spoonful ofbrandyanda grain of salt.

Almond {small) Cakes.*—Blanch half a pound of almonds, pound them to a paste with white of egg, add three quar- ters of a pound of powder-sugar, one of orange flowers pralin&e, and about two ounces of creme pdlissiire ; take some puft’ paste, roll it out very thin, cut it into small square pieces, lay them on a baking plate, and put some of the above mixture on each, moisten the edges, cover them with the puff paste, dorez, prick and bake them in a hot oven, when done, ice them with sugar.

Place the coloured al- monds on a sieve in a stove; when dry, mix all together, adding the white ones.

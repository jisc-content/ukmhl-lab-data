397 ) PIE PIE livers (see Forcemeat for Raised Ries)^ Hnd lay in long slips of lean liHm,tnifnes, and fat livers; then close your chickens, or whatever it may be, by drawing the skin of the neck over the part that is open ; raise your pie the, same as in the receipt for Raised Pie to be served Hot, only let the crust be much thicker, and secure all the joining parts ; tvhen so far done, cut some large thin slices ol fat bacon, lay them first at the bottom, then allround tlie sides; make what you in- tend to put in as nearly to the shape of the pie as you possibly can, by filling up every part, that there may be no cavity under the meat; or it may occasion your pie to fall or lose its shape; when all is put in, cover it well over with fat bacon, and lay three bay-leaves on the top ; for gravy, put in some liquor in which truffles have been stewed, or some good strong veal or beef braize, egg the edge of the pie round, and lay on a good thick cover, joining it well to the edge, that being a great support to the pie; then neatly trim it all round ; form on the top of the crust a star of leaves with a hole in the centre; on the sides festoons, leaves, or garlands, according to your own taste; egg it lightly over, and bake it in a hot regularly heated oven; a small-sized pie will take about four hours baking, a larger pie accordingly; take care, on first putting it in, that it does not catch or burn, which it is apt to do, and in that case, have plenty of paper to lay over it. Before the pie is quite done, set on some good consomme or veal braize, and let it boil till it becomes very strong, and pour it into the pie as soon as it is taken out of the oven, and set it to cool; if the next day it should appear to have taken all the gravy, more must be added. It had better stand three or four days before it is served ; you may, for a change, take oft’the cover, and in its place sprinkle some clear savory jelly on the top. This is a good dish for the side table.

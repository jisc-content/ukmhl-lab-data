Pheasant, Standing Pie of.*—Bone three fine pheasants which have hung for some days, lard them with small lardons ; then lay them open on the table, season with spiced salt, put in each two spoons- ful oifarce, and a few truflles ; then sew up each in the form of a ball. Take a stewpan, the size you intend to have your pie, line it completely with slices of ham and bacon, on which lay the pheasants, and a noix of veal, tied up that the form may be preserved ; add to these, a sufti- cientquantity of spiced salt, the bones of the pheasants, some cuttings of veal, and truflles, four onions, fsluck with three cloves, two carrots, a large bunch of pars- ley and scallions, bay-leaf, basil, thyme, a glass of Spanish wine, two ladiesful of good consomme, and four of other broth skimmings ; talte care that your meat is covered with the liquor; put a buttered paper over the whole, and set it on the fire ; when it has boiled a few minutes, take it off, and put the saucepan on the stove with fiie on the lid, and leave it for an hour, boil'ng constantly. When quite cold, take out each article, add the ham and bacon to a /arce, made as directed for Partridge Standing-pie Chaud-froid. Raise your crust as usual, and put into it a quarter of the/arce, make it smooth, and having untied the veal, lay that in the pie, strew a little spiced salt over, a third of the remaining farce, and four truffles, each cut in two; then take the thread from the pheasants, trim them a little that they may lay in the pie without injuring the shape; put a pinch of spiced salt, and some truffles, cover them with the rest of the/«ree, in which put more truflles, cut in halves, then add the but- ter, bay-leaves, &c., and finish as direct- ed in the above mentioned receipt. Three hours and a half are sufficient to bake this pie; when taken out of the oven, pour in the consomme, previously strained through a cloth, and close the hole with a piece of paste. Pheasant to Roast.—Take out the en- trails, and singe the pheasant over the stove, then roll a bit of butter in pepper and salt, and put it into the inside of the bird ; truss it neatly with the head turn- ed on one side, keeping the breast as full as possible; over which should be laid slices of fat bacon tied on with pack- thread : before it is put on the spit, break the liackbonc, that it may lay the better on the dish. A good sized phea- sant will take half an hour; when nearly done, take away the bacon, brown the pheasant well; sprinkle it with flour and salt, and froth it with butter; serve it with water-cresses, a good gravy under it, and bread sauce in a lioat. Pheasant, Salmis of.*—Take two cold roasted pheasants, cut them up, trim the pieces properly, take off all the skin, and put the limbs into a stewpan. Put the remains of the pheasants into another saucepan, with a glass of white wine, four shalots, a little Seville orange-peel, half a clove of garlic, half a bay-leaf, four spoonsful of espagnoletravaiilee, a bit of glaze, and a spoonful o{consomme; re- duce these, and then strain the sauce over the pheasant, make it hot in the bain marie, but do not let it boil; lay them in a dish, the smallest pieces first, and the more considerable ones round, intermixed wilh fried bread; squeeze the juice of a Seville oi-ange into the sauce, which pour over the bird. Pheasant with Saur-Kraut.*—Take a large pheasant, and liaving picked and singed, truss it like a chicken; season the inside with parslev, scallions, salt, pepper, and spices, and lard it; take a sufficient quantity of saur-kraut to fill a good sized dish, put it into a saucepan, with a piece of bacon, and a servehas, and some pot skimmings, set it on a moder- ate fire for a quarter of an hour, then take out the bacon and servelas, put in the pheasant, and leave it an hour and a . half; when done, take it out, put it on a dish, drain the saur-kraut, and lay it round the bird; remove the skin, and cut the servelas into slices, which, with the bacon also sliced, place round the whole. . .

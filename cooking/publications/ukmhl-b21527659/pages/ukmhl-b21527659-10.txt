ADVERTISEMENT. IV Confectionery, so much neglected in other Cookery Books, much i attention has been paid; and, upon the whole, the Editor ventures i to hope that he will be allowed to have given to the public a valuable • Work Among other novelties will be found an alphabetical list of' the various kinds of Fish, Flesh, Fowl, Fruits, and "V^egetables, with i the months when each is in season, and original instructions for • choosing the several kinds of Food. The Editor has only further to observe, that, so far is he from arrogating too much to himself of the credit which may be thought due to the work, that he is free to confess himself largely indebted to the talents and labours of numerous friends in the profession, to whom he takes this opportunity of returning his grateful acknow- ledgments. London, May, 1830.

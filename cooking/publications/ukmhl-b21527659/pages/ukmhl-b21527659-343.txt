( 333 ) MIL MEL done before yori are ready to serve, take it up, set the dish over a pan of boiling water, put a deep cover over it, so as not to touch the meat, and then put a cloui over that. This way will not dry up the gravy. Meat Patties. —The tins should be about the .size of a small teacup, but not so deep; lay pud-paste at llie bottom, put in some forcemeat, and cover it with pud-paste; bake them a light brown, turn them out; five or seven make a side-dish. MELON Fritters.—Cnt a melon into small pieces, (remove the seeds and rind), soak them in brandy and sugar for half an hour; then drain them well, dip each piece in pod batter, and fry them. Serve them with sugar sifted over. Melon Fromage Bavarois.*—Cut a moderate sized melon into slices, from which take the rind and seeds; cut the fruit small, and reduce it to a marma- lade with half a pound of clarified sugar; rub it through a fine sieve, add to it six drachms of clarified isinglass, stir it well, and place it on ice; as soon as it begins to thicken, mix a plate of whipped cream with it, and finish as usual. Melon Mangoes.— There is a parti- cular sort for this purpose, which the gardeners know. Cut a square small piece out of one side, and through that take out all the seeds, mix them with mustard-seeds and shred garlic, stuff the melon with them, as full as the space will allow, and replace the square piece. Bind it up with small pack-thread. Boil a sufficient quantity of vinegar to allow for wasting, with pep per, salt, and ginger,and pour it boiling hot over the mangoes, for four successive days; the last day you pour it over, add flour of mustard, and scraped horse-radish, into the vine- gar, just as it boils up. Stop close. Be careful there is plenty of vinegar. All pickles are spoiled if not kept well covered with vinegar, and the greater number of times the boiling vinegar is poured over the mangoes, the sooner it will be ready for use. Large cucumbers, called green Turley, prepared in the same manner as above, are very good, and come sooner into eating. Melons fo Preserve for Cookery.—Boil two parts of water, and one ofvinegar, with salt, cloves (and other spice if you like), in proportion ; in the meanwhile take some small melons, wipe them with a cloth, and put them into a saucepan ; pour the above mixture, whilst boiling, over them, and set them on ashes till the next day ; then renew the fire, and keep them for several days, until the melons become quite green, then put them into pots. and when cold,_cover them close; they should he kept in a cool place. _ Melons (fo preserve like Ginger).*— Haifa pound of ginger to one pound of melon; scrape the ginger, and save the scrapings ; pour a quart of boiling water on the ginger, let it stand two days : scald the melon (with the scrapings of the ginger in the water), taking care not to make it too soft: cut it into small pieces resembling ginger; then prepare a syrup, half a pound of sugar to a pint of water; boil the ginger in it; when cold, put in the melon, and set it over the fire for a short time, but not to boil; let the syrup, with the ginger, be boiled every day for a fortnight, hut not poured upon the melon till nearly cold; then boil a rich syrup to keep it in. N.B. — Carrot is equally good with melon. MERINGUES.—Whisk the whites of nine eggs to a solid froth ; then add the rind of six lemons, grated extremely fine, and a spoonful of sifted sugar; after which, lay a sheet of wet paper on a tin, and with a spoon drop the rnixture in little lumps,separately upon it, sift su- gar over, and put them to bake in a moderately heated oven, taking care that they are done of a nice colour. Then put raspberry, apricot, or .any other kind of jam between two of these bottoms, add them together, and lay them in a warm place, or before the fire to dry. Meringues.*—Take the whites of twelve eggs, six ounces of the best lump sugar, pounded and sifted, and half a pound of pistachios ; blanch and beat the latter in a mortar, with a little white of egg, to a very fine paste. Whisk the whites of eggs to a snow, then add the sugar, and pistachio paste, mix them well, but very lightly, and when they are thoroughly incorporated, put some sheets of paper on tin plates, lay your prepara- tion on the paper, with a spoon, lay the meringues^ at least an inch apart ; sprinkle sifted sugar over them, and put them into a moderate oven or stove ; when done, detach them gently from the paper with a knife, and place them on a sieve in a dry place. .Just before they are_ sent to table, fill each witli a little whipped cream, to which add a small quantity of either orange-flower, rose, or vanilla water. _ MIGNONETTE.—A mignonette con- sists of the long pepper, ginger, cinna- mon, cloves, coriander, and mace, tied together, in a bit of linen cloth. MILK-PORIUDGE.—Make a fine gruel of half grits, boiled a long time; strain ofl'; either add cold milk, or warm it with milk : serve with toast.

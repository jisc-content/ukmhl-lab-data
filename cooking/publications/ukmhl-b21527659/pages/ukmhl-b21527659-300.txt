( 290 ) ICE HOT caic to filter the first drops twice, as they generally carry with them some portion of the coal. The syiupwhicli still adheres to the coal, and other materials, may be separat- ed as follows: pour boiling water on tliem until they no longer retain any sweetness ; then put these different waters together, set them over a large fire to evaporate, till the syrup only re- mains. This syrup contracts the flavour of barley sugar, and must not be added to the clarified honey. HOPS *—The early shoots of hops are sometimes used in the spring, as substi- tutes for asparagus; they are dressed in the same manner; and served with a white sauce, or with oil. HORSERADISH Sauce Cold.—Chop up some parsley, chibbol, shalots, a clove of garlic, capers, and anchovies, to these add a spoonfut of horseradish scraped very fine, a spoonful of oil, vinegar, pep- per and salt. Horseradish Sauce Hot.—Slice two onions, and fry them in oil, and when they begin to colour, put them into a saucepan, with a glass of white wine, the same of broth, two slices of lemon, peel- ed, two cloves of garlic, a bay-leaf, thyme, basil, and two cloves; boil these a quarter of an hour, and then strain it; add capers, and an anchovy chopped, pepper, salt, and a spoonful of horse- radish, boiled to a pulp ; warm the whole without boiling.

Serve all together in a soup dish, knuckle of veal, and scrag of mutton, stewed with the pease, onions, and lettuces; without frying is likewise an e.'ccellent way of making this dish. Hotch-potch.—Cut four ox tails into pieces at the joints, take a pound of gravy beef, and the same of pickled pork, cut each in half, and put these articles into a Siiucepan, cover them with water, and when it boils, skim it well; add half a savoy, two ounces of mushrooms, some turuips, carrots, onions, leeks, celery, a bay leaf, whole pepper, allspice, and a little mace; when nearly done, put in two quarts of veal stock ; as soon as the meat is tender, take it out, and put it into a deep dish, hut keep it hot; siraiii the liquor, take off’ all the fat, season it with cayenne, salt and lemon-juice ; have leady some carrots, turnips, celery, and onions, the three former cut in pieces; stew these separately till tender, and strain off' their essences to the above liquor; clear it with whites of eggs; strain it, put in the vegetables; boil the whole gently for ten minutes, and then pour it over the meat. Hotch-potch.—Take some young car- rots, cut them into round pieces, all ihe same length ; boil them in a little stock, with a small quantity of sugar; when sufficiently done, reduce the sauce; put some good espagnole to them, season it well, take off' the fat, and serve.

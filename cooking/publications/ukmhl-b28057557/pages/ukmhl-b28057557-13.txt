PUBLISHER’S NOTE TO TWELFTH EDITION, There is here given for the first time a Shilling Edition of the famous Cookery Book by the late Countess Munster, ‘ Dainty Dishes,’ which has run through eleven editions. The larger edition (3s. 6d.) retains some special features and additional receipts of value. But what it has here been possible to give, viz. : upwards of Eight Hundred Receipts for Soups, Sauces, Fish, Meat, Poultry, Game, Vegetables, Salads, Eggs, Cheese, Entremets, Puddings, Jellies, Pastry, Baking of Bread, Biscuits and Cakes, Pickling and Preserving, Cookery for the Sick and Poor, etc., will, it is hoped, speedily secure for the work a position as one of the favourite Shilling Cookery-Books. Of the excellence of the Receipts collected by Lady Harriet St. Clair (late Countess Munster) it may suffice to quote from two Press notices. The British Mail said : ‘ A design so excellent and an accomplishment so complete may well recommend this volume to the consideration of the ladies of this kingdom. If economy can be combined with an agreeable and nutritious diet, by all means let the fact be well known.’ And the Glasgow Herald certified : ‘ It is something to say, in this age of many cookery-books, that the receipts given are not farciful, but practical. They can really be cooked, a recommendation that cannot be given to many of our cookery-books.’ Should it be desired to simplify or to cheapen the Reoipes, it is generally possible to vary or to omit some of the ingredients, according to judgment.

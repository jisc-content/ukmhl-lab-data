WHEN you fpin a Elver web for a defert, always take particular care your fire is clear, and a pan of water upon the fire, to keep the heat from your face and fto- mach, for fear the heat fhould make you faint; you mull not fpin it before a kitchen fire, for the fmaller the grate is, fo that the tire be clear and hot, the better able you will be to fit a long time before it, for, if you fpin a whole defert, you will be feveral hours in lpinning it; be fure to have a tin box to put every bafket in as you fpin them, and cover them from the air, and keep them warm until you have done the whole, as your receipt directs you. If you fpin a gold web, take care your chafing- difh is burnt clear before you fet it upon the table where your mould is; fet your ladle on the fire, and keep ftirring it with a wooden fkewer till it juft boils, then let it cool a little, for it will not fpin when it is boiling hot, and if it grows cold it is equally as bad; but as it cools on the fides of your ladle, dip the point of your knife in,, and begin to fpin round your mould as long as it will draw, then heat it again; the only art is to keep it of a proper heat, and it will draw out like a fine thread, and of a gold colour; it is a great fault to put in too much fiugar at a time, B b for

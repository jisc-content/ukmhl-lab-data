ENGLISH HOUSE-KEEPER. 317 CHAP. XV. Obfervations on Wines, Catchup, and Vinegar. WINE is a very neceffary thing in moft fa- milies, and is often fpoiled through mif- management of putting together, for if you let it ftand too long before you get it cold, and do not take great care to put your barm upon it in time, it fummer-beams and blinks in the tub, fo that it makes your wine fret in the calk, and will not let it fine; it is equally as great a fault to let it â– work too long in the tub, for that takes off all the fweetnefs and flavour of the fruit or flowers your wine is made from, fo the only caution I can give is to be careful in following the re- ceipts, and to have your veftels dry, rinfe them, with brandy, and clofe them up as foon as your wane has done fermenting. To make Lemon Wine to drink like Citron Water. PARE five dozen of lemons very thin, put the peels into five quarts of French brandy, and let them ftand fourteen days, then make the juice into a fyrup with three pounds of {ingle-refined fugar; when the peels are ready, boil fifteen gallons of water with forty pounds of ftngle-re- fmed fugar for half an hour, then put it into a tub; wThen cool, add to it one fpoonful of barm, let it work two1 days, then turn it and put in the |>randy, peels, and fyrup, ftir them all together.

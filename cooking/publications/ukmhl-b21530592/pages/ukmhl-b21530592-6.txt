BARBEL.—Thi fifh fpawns at the latter end of April, or in the beginning of May; begius to be in feafon about a month after, and continues in feafon till the time of fpawning returns. It is very bony and coarfe, and is not accounted, at any time, the beft fifh to eat either for wholefomenefs or tade ;* but the fpawn is of a very poifonous nature. When it is full of fpawn, in March and April, it may be-fo eafily midaken for Tench, if the barbs or wattels, under the head, are carefully cut off; and (if the fame art is taken to difguife it) its fine cafe and hand- fome diape, during the red of the year, give it fo * Hawkins, the editor of Walton’s Complete Angler, ob- ferves, p. 217, Note, T hat ‘ though the fpawn of Barbel is « known to he of a poifonous nature, yet it is often taken, by • country people, medicinally, who find it at once a moft « powerful emetic and cathartic. And, notwithstanding what 1 is faid of the wholefomenefs of the flefh, with fomc conftitu- ‘ tions it produces the fame eflefts as the fpawn. About the * month of September, in the year 1754, a fervant of mine, * who had eaten part of a Barbel, though as I had cautioned • him, he abflained from the fpawn, was feized with fuch ‘ a violent purging and vomiting as had like to hare coft him ‘ his life.’

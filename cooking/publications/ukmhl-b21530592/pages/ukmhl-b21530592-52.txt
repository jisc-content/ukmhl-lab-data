To make Pig Royal. Take a pig and roafl it the fame way as you did for lamb, when you draw it you mull not cut it up ; when it is cold you mull lard it with bacon ; cut not your layers too fmall, if you do they will melt away, cut them about an inch and a quarter long; you mult put one row down the back, and one on either fide, then flrinklc it over with a few bread crumbs and a little fait, and fet it iÂ« the oven, an hour will bake it, but mind your oven be not too hot ; you mull take another pig of a lefs lize, roall it, cut it up, and lie it on each fide : the fauce you make for a roall pig will ferve for both. This is proper for a bottom difh at a grand enter- tainment.

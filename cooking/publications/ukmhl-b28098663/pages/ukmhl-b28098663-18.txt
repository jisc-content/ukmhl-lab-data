SWEETS A LA MODE. 6 Cabinet Pudding. Pouding de Cabinet. Butter a pudding mould, and garnish with raisins, citron peel cut in slices, and dried cherries ; fill the mould with alternate layers of sponge cakes, ratafias, macaroons, and the fruits, and then pour into it an uncooked custard made of the yolks of six eggs, two whole eggs, half a pound of sugar, a pint of milk, a glass of sherry, and the rind of one lemon grated ; simmer the pudding in water nearly boiling, but be careful not to let the pudding boil. When done, turn it out, and serve with half a pint of syrup flavoured with sherry. This pudding can be put in ice and served cold, and called Iced Cabinet Pudding. o Caramel Custards. Take four cupfuls of boiled milk ; put it into a basin with one cupful of caramel prepared as follows :—take half a pound of pounded sugar, stir over the fire till it becomes a dark brown colour, add one cupful of water ; boil one minute till the sugar is dissolved, add four yolks of eggs and one ounce of pounded sugar. Mix well and strain. Pour this into a basin or jar, skim off carefully all froth from the surface, put the jar in a flat stewpan with boiling water; put this on a very slow fire for fifteen minutes—the water should only just bubble. When set let the custards cool in water. Coffee custards are made the same, only with one cupful • of very strong coffee instead of the caramel.

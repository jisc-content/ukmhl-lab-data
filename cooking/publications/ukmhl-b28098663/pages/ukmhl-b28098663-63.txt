SUPPER DISHES A LA MODE. 5J Artichokes a la Barigoule. Take some artichokes and cut them so that nothing but the bottom and the tender begin- nings of the leaves remain. Then in the spaces between each leaf drop in salt, pepper, and a few drops of oil. Now place the artichokes in an earthenware dish and pour oil over them till they are covered to their middle height. Add two onions cut in quarters, a sprig of thyme, a clove of garlic, a laurel leaf, salt and pepper ; cover the earthenware dish with a sheet of paper, and on this place a dishful of water, so that it shall be her- metically closed, and then let them cook.

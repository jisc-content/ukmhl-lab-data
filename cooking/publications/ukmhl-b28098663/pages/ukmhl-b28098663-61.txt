SWEETS A LA MODE. 49 Whipped Madeira Jelly. Put an ounce and a half of gelatine in a stew- pan with three-quarters of an ounce of lump sugar and one pint of water; melt it over the fire, strain it through a silk sieve, and add three gills of Madeira. Put a tinned or enamel basin in the ice and whip it with a wire whisk ; take it off the ice and whip it for ten minutes more. Should the jelly become too firm, dip the bowl in warm water for a few seconds. Continue whipping until the jelly is all a thick froth ; then pour it into a mould set in ice ; let it remain for three-quarters of an hour. Turn the jelly out and serve. White Currant Jelly with Raspberries. Pick a pound and a half of white currants ; boil a pint and a half of syrup ; put the currants in it, and let them remain on the fire for two minutes, tossing the syrup to cook the currants evenly ; pour the whole into a basin and when cold pass through a jelly-bag. Clarify two ounces of gelatine with half a pound of sugar and two whites of egg, &c., as before directed. Add to it the currant syrup ; pour the jelly in a mould set in ice, putting in a pound and a half of picked raspberries, and finish as before.

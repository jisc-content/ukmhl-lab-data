Make a creme patissiere as follows : Break two eggs into a stewpan, with a little salt and as much sifted flour as they will take up ; mix in a pint of new milk; put it on the fire; stir constantly, that it may not stick ; then add a piece of butter the size of a walnut; put it into a dish and rub a little butter over it, that it may not harden on the out- side ; then blanch a quarter of a pound of pistachio nuts and sweet almonds ; pound them together, occasionally adding a drop of water to prevent their oiling. When smooth add a paste made of a spoonful of blanched spinach pressed in butter, beaten, and rubbed through a colander, and put all this into the creme patissiere, which should have as much flour in it as it will take. Add three-quarters of a pound of castor sugar, a teaspoonful of orange- flower water, four whole eggs, six yolks, and a quarter of a pound of melted butter. Mix all well together. Whip the four whites, mix them in lightly. Butter a stewpan and powder it all over with fine bread crumbs, put in the mixture, and bake for three-quarters of an hour. Serve at once.

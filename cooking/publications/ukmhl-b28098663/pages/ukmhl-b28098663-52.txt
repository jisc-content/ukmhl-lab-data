40 SWEETS A LA MODE. Pineapple Toast. Take a small tin of preserved pineapple and a stale sponge cake ; cut the sponge cake in slices half an inch thick, and cut them and the slices of pineapple to the same shape. Fry lightly the slices of cake on both sides in butter. Arrange on a dish in a circle alternately a slice of cake and one of pineapple ; take as much syrup out of the tin as may be necessary ; add to it a glass of sherr}^ or a liqueur of brandy ; pour this over the dish and serve cold. Potato Cheese Cakes. Boil a quarter of a pound of mealy potatoes; mash them well; then add to them two table- spoonfuls of brandy, a quarter of a pound of sugar, a quarter of a pound of butter oiled, four eggs, and the rind of half an orange mixed. â€¢ Mix these ingredients well together, and bake in hollow pattypans with puff paste. Potato Souffle. Mix a large spoonful of potato flour and of pounded sugar with half a pint of new milk; put it into a pan and stir it over the fire till it boils. Remove the pan from the fire and flavour the mix- ture with orange-flower water or chocolate ; beat up the yolks of six eggs with a little sugar; add them to the mixture. Mix in lightly the beaten whites and bake for half an hour, and send up quickly to table.

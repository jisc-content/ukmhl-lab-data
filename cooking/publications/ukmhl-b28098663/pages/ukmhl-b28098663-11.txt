PREFACE. In offering my fifth small volume on culinary matters, which finishes the series, I shall hope to obtain the continued approval I have hitherto re- ceived from the public, I have compiled the best recipes from all sources, varied now and again by an original con- ception. If at any time my readers should wish to cor- respond with me on the gastronomic art, or on what is now a leading accessory to the dinner table, viz. Floral Decorations, I shall be most happy to communicate with them. HARRIET A. de SALTS. 71 Warwick Road, Earlâ€™s Court, S.W. January 1888.

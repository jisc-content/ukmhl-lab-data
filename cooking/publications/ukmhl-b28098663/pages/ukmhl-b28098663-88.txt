76 TCING. Frying Batter. J^eat up one tablespoonful of brandy, one of olive oil, and a little cold water with the yolk of one egg ; add a pinch of salt ; then work in sufficient flour to make, with the addition of more water, as much batter as will be wanted. It should be of the consistency of thick cream. Just before using whisk into the batter the whites of two eggs, and mix them lightly but effectually. Icing. Take twelve ounces of icing sugar, whisk the whites of four eggs to a strong froth, and stir in the sugar by degrees, beating the whole time to make it smooth ; mix in the strained juice of half a lemon, and lay on the preparation while the cakes or pastry are warm, smoothing it equally all over with a flat spoon or a broad knife. Let it harden in a cool oven ; it must not be hot or it would colour the icing. Carmine or cochineal is added when pink is required ; for coffee icing a little Bransonâ€™s essence of coffee is added, and a little liquid chocolate when chocolate icing is required. Syrup. Put a pint of water in a preserving pan over the fire ; when it boils drop gradually into it half a pound of sugar. When the sugar is dissolved let it boil up. Remove the .scum as it rises. When it is clear it will be ready. Let it get cold, and then it will be fit for use. Different liqueurs or essences are poured into the .syrup when different flavours are required.

43 SWEETS A LA MODE. crumbs are slightly coloured ; stir in two ounces of sugar and a pint of boiling milk, and let the whole boil till the mixture becomes rather thick ; take the mixture off the fire and whilst it is getting cool whip up to a froth the whites of six eggs, on which put two or three drops of vinegar ; mix the yolks of the eggs with the mixture, and add the whip, turning it lightly over until well mixed ; butter and sugar a mould, fill it to within an inch of the top with the mixture, place the mould in a stewpan of hot water with a bottom to prevent its slipping, and put in an oven not too hot and bake for three- quarters of an hour ; turn out the mould and cover with half a pint of whip sauce flavoured with vanilla. Strawberry Fluff. Separate five eggs ; beat the whites to a stiff froth. Beat a cupful of nice ripe strawberries to a liquid ; add two-thirds of a cup of powdered sugar to the yolks, beat well, and add the juice of half a lemon and the strawberry liquid. Boil this till scalding and slightly thickened, then add quickly the well-beaten whites; stir briskly all together and remove quickly from the fire and fill custard glasses with it. Serve cold with sponge cake. Strawberry Fritters. Beignets aux Praises. Make a batter of two eggs well beaten, add a quarter of a pint of cream and a quarter of a pint of milk thickened with a little corn flour, sugar, and a trifle of cinnamon. Put the strawberries raw into this batter and fry them in a pan of hot lard, a spoonful at a time.

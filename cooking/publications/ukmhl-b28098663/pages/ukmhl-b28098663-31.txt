SIVEKTS A LA MODE. 19 sponge fingers and two ounces of ratafias, and let them soak some time, but they must not boil. Duchess Loaves. Talniouses a la Duchesse. Put half a pint of milk into a stewpan with five ounces of flour, four ounces of butter, two ounces of sugar, two ounces of chopped almonds, and a little lemon juice. Place the pan upon the fire and stir it until it boils for about three minutes. Mix in three eggs one at a time. Divide the mix- ture into small round balls the size of a pigeonâ€™s egg ; place them on a baking sheet spread with butter, and bake to a light brown colour. When cold make an incision down the sides and fill the loaves with strawberry jam, sprinkle with desic- cated cocoa-nut, dish up, and send to table. Plane of Peaches. Flanc de Peches. Make some good compote syrup ; stone some peaches or apricots and fill in the spaces with vanilla cream ; then boil them up in the syrup, reducing the syrup to the consistency of thick cream strained, and when cool pour over the fruit. Have some pistachio kernels blanched and cut into halves, quartered again, and stick the peaches or apricots all over with them hedgehog fashion. Dish them in a circle on some iced cream that has been moulded into a border form and fill up the centre with glace cherries. Apples, oranges, and large plums may be dressed in a similar way, but fill up apples with preserved ginger.

Make the nougat by scalding one pound of Jordan almonds, removing the skins, and washing them well. Split them into halves and then into short shavings. Now place them on a baking sheet and put them in a slow oven till they get a pale gold colour, shaking them about all the time. Whilst the almonds are baking put half a pound of castor sugar into a stewpan (a copper sugar boiler is best) and stir it over the fire to melt ; as soon as it is dissolved put in six drops of lemon juice, and when it begins to form little bubbles throw in the hot almonds and mix very gently with the sugar. Then lift the pan off the fire, but keep the nougat hot. Have ready some little dariole moulds, well oiled with oil of sweet almonds ; put a little of the nougat paste on an oiled marble slab and spread it out well with a broad-bladed knife, and then it must be immediately placed in the mould, but very thinly ; trim the edges and let it cool. When cold turn them out and fill up with whipped and sweetened cream ; lay some crystallised sugar violets on the top, and stretch across from side to side a strip of citron for the handle ; colour and sweeten a little piece of gelatine, and when nearly cold tie them in a bow and fasten on the top of the handle.

lo SlVIiETS A LA MODE. half a pint of water, and a glass of wine ; let them boil up, strain the syrup, take out the kernels, re- move the outer skin carefully from the apricots, and leave them to get cold ; add one pint of the syrup and sixteen sheets of best French gelatine steeped in a little water, boil up the whole, and clarify with two whites and shells of eggs. Have two plain moulds, one about one inch and a quarter larger than the other ; pour a very little jelly into the bottom of the larger mould and let it cool ; then place in it a layer of the apricots and a few of the kernels split; cover this with more jelly, but only just enough to get a smooth surface. Lay this on ice to set; when it is quite firm put the smaller mould inside the larger one, taking care to place it exactly in the middle, so that the vacant space between the two moulds may be of the same width all round. In this vacant place dispose slices of apricots and the rest of the kernels, filling up the interstices with the jelly until all the space is filled up. Place the mould upon ice ; whip a pint of cream with half an ounce of dissolved isinglass and some of the aj)ricot syrup, which must be added to it a very little at a time or the cream will not rise to a froth. When the cream is ready and the jelly set, remove the inner mould by pouring warm water into it and fill up the inner space with the cream. Set on ice for an hour and turn out.

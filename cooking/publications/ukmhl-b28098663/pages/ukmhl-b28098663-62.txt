Make some toast, cut it into five neat square pieces, butter it, then spread lightly on it the follow- ing mixture : Stir in a gallipot (placed in a sauce- pan of hot water over the fire) the beaten yolk of an egg, one ounce of butter, two teaspoonfuls of anchovy paste (P'ourrier and Cunningham’s is best), a teaspoonful of mushroom ketchup, six olives finely chopped, and a gill of cream, until it becomes the thickness of a rich custard. It must not be allowed to boil. Whip a gill of cream to a froth, let it drain on a sieve, then pile it up on each piece to roast over the anchovy custard.

SWEETS A LA MODE. 12 boil for five minutes, and pour the whole into a basin ; clarify two ounces of gelatine with three- quarters of a pound of sugar, the juice of a lemon, two whites and shells of eggs, and two pints of water in the usual way ; add two gills of cherry brandy to the jelly when cold. Break about forty or fifty cherry stones, blanch and peel the kernels, drain the cherries well, put a mould on ice, pour in a little jelly, put a row of cherries on this ; go on filling the mould with alter- nate layers of jelly and cherries, throwing in some of the kernels whilst filling it.

Dissolve one ounce of butter in two ounces of water, add one and a half ounce of flour and mix well together over the fire ; then remove from the fire and mix in, one at a time, three whole eggs and a pinch of salt; add to it three ounces of sugar, work it up with a wooden spoon into twelve rolls of this mixture about four inches long and half an inch wide and deep ; place them carefully on a greased baking-tin, cover the whole with pounded sugar and shake it all off again. The paste will not leave the sheet; bake it to a nice golden colour. Whip some cream flavoured with chocolate, add a little pounded sugar, rub through a fine hair sieve. Make a hole at one end of the eclairs and force in some of this mixture, and cover them with chocolate icing.

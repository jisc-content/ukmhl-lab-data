Pound a quarter of a pound of salmon with a quarter of a small cucumber, also pounded, mixed with thick cream, one tablespoonful of salad oil, a teaspoonful of tarragon vinegar, a little green colouring, and a dust of cayenne pepper. Pass all these through a hair sieve with half a pint of aspic jelly ; then let it get cold on ice. Then cut into little rounds with scallopped edges (cut with a cutter) and arrange these upon the mould about three inches apart ; between these rows put little sprays of barberry garnish ; also place a wreath of the latter round the top of the mould ; set these with aspic jelly ; fill up the centre with a mixture of cooked lobster and anchovies, and mince these fine ; add a teaspoonful of chopped tarragon and chervil, six small olives, and two tomatoes from which the skin and pips have been removed. All these should be cut into little square shapes. Add in with this two tablespoonfuls of sauce tartare mixed with a tablespoonful of aspic jelly. Stir well and continually. Put the mould on ice ; turn out in the usual way. Garnish the base with a border of whipped aspic and decorate with thin rounds of scalloped cucumber and crayfish. Powder the chopped aspic here and there with lobster coral.

SUPPER DISHES J LA MODE. 53 place them on their dish ; ornament tlieir breasts with designs stamped out with cutters from thin slices of truffle, red-tongue, or with spread leaves of tarragon and chervil ; the base should be garnished with some chopped aspic jelly and a border of aspic croutons round alternately red and white. They may also be decorated with red and white designs cut out in aspic instead of truffles, &c. Croutes of Caviare. Cut some pieces of bread half an inch thick and one inch wide ; hollow out from the centre a little piece and fry a nice golden brown, and then fill up with caviare ; flavour with a little lemon, butter, and a tiny dust of Nepaul pepper ; put them in the oven and serve very hot. Dressed Ham. Take a ham weighing about nine pounds, which should be soaked about ten hours in cold water. Then simmer the ham with a carrot and bay leaf in the water for three hours ; when done let it remain in the water to get cold, having first skinned it whilst hot. When cold glaze it with a pale glaze and make designs in red and gold- coloured savoury jelly, and ornament it, and dish with chopped aspic and croutons in the same all round the dish. One way of ornamenting a dressed ham is to make a one-inch border all round with different designs in Italian paste, and a star of the same in the middle, and whipped aspic, put on through a forcer in designs between the centre and sides.

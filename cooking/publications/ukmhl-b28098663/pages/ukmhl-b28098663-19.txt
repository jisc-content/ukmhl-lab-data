SlFÂ£/rrS A LA MODE. 7 Caramel Pudding (Superior). Ponding au Caramel (.Superieur). Make a custard with two ounces of castor sugar, three raw yolks of eggs, two whites beaten, a quarter of a teaspoonful of vanilla essence, and half a pint of rich milk ; mix these ingredients together and strain. Tut half a pound of castor sugar into a basin and fill it up with a breakfastcupful of water to melt the sugar. Then set it on the fire to boil, stirring it constantly and removing the scum that may arise when it Jias become a syrup and begins to look white and bubble up; pour in the juice of a lemon free from pips, and never leave off stirring till it gets a deep golden colour. To .sec when it is done dip the handle of a knife into it, then im- mediately into cold water ; it will harden and be- come brittle. Have prepared a mould oiled with sweet almond oil, and to ornament it take two silver forks together, back to back; dip them in the caramel, and draw some of it out in threads, which can be laced about the mould in all directions. The caramel must be kept hot all this time by placing the saucepan in another with hot water. \Vhen the sugar threads are dry in the mould pour in some of the liquid caramel, and roll the mould round and round to make it cover all the side ; then stand the caramel in cold water to set it, and pour in the custard. Steam till firm, turn out and serve.

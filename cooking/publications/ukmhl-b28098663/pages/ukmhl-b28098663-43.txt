SWEETS A LA MODE. 31 Madeleines. These are made of the same kind of batter as Genoese cakes, and when the batter is ready poured into a sufficient number of plain dariole moulds and baked in a moderate oven. When done turn them out and roll them in diluted preserve, and then in crystallised sugar. Place a crystallised cherry on the top of each and four pieces of angelica to represent leaves. They can be varied in colour by rolling them in different-coloured jams. Maraschino Jelly with Peaches. Cut six peaches in halves, blanch them in boil- ing water for five minutes, peel and put them into some syrup in a basin ; clarify one ounce of gelatine and add a quarter of a pint of maraschino to the jelly.

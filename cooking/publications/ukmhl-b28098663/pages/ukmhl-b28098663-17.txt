5 SWEETS A LA MODE. Bread Meringue. Meringue au Pain. Take half a pound of stale bread and put it in a lined saucepan with a pint and a gill of milk. Let it boil slowly, then beat it thoroughly with a fork to free it from lumps, until it is perfectly smooth. Add some lump sugar (on which has been grated the zest of a lemon) to taste, two ounces of butter, and the yolks of three eggs. Mix all together, put into a small pie dish, and bake till a light brown. Spread over the top a layer of greengage or any other jam. Take the whites of three eggs, add a pinch of salt, and whisk till they are a stiff froth ; pile the whip on the top of the pudding, sift a little castor sugar over, and return to the oven for a few minutes. Well watch, so that the whip should not turn brown. Drop a crystallised cherry in each crevice of the icing, and put cross bars of strips of angelica between, which makes the pudding very ornamental. Brown Bread Souffle. Pain l3is Souffle. Beat two ounces of butter to cream and add gradually ten yolks of eggs, one and a half ounce of sugar, a little powdered cloves, some grated lemon-peel and four ounces of grated brown bread- crumbs, one ounce of picked currants, and the stiffly whipped whites of the eggs lightly stirred in. Bake for one hour. This is enough for a large dinner party; half these cjuantities are generally sufficient.

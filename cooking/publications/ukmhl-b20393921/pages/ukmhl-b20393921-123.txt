109 BAKED ONIONS. be put into a saucepan covered with cold water, put over the fire and when boiling, boiled for fifteen minutes. At the end of this time, the first water should be drained off, nearly all of the salt sprinkled over them, and recovering them with boiling water, allow them to boil for half an hour longer. While the onions are boiling, melt in a small saucepan the butter, stir into it the flour, and by degrees the milk, and when this mixture boils, add to it the cream, and let all cook together for two minutes, when it must be sea- soned with the pepper and remaining salt. Take the onions from the water, when boiled, one by one, with a draining spoon, pressing them against the side of the saucepan in lifting them, that the water may be entirely expressed. Place them in a vegetable dish, pour over them the white sauce, and they are ready to serve.

Remove them from the frying pan, drain them of grease upon a sheet of kitchen pan, and serve piled high in a vegetable dish. Notes—All batters should be made an hour or two before using, adding the white of egg just at the moment of use, as the grains of flour soak and swell out by standing after being moistened, and so the batter becomes lighter. Parsnip fritters may be prepared with the same kind of batter used for the potato, but when parsnips are used they must be thor- oughly dried before being dipped into the batter.

Pierce the oysters through the ear with a skewer, and lifting them in this way, dip them one by one into the

27 SOLE A W GRATIN Note—Large flounder may also be prepared after this recipe with the same result. Boiled Codfish.—Provide: four pounds of cod, middle cut, one large tablespoonful of vinegar, one-half tablespoonful of salt. The codfish should be purchased the day before it is desired to serve, and permited to lie over night in salt. When ready to boil, fill the fish kettle two thirds full of boiling water, add to this the vinegar and salt, place the fish into the drainer, and plunge it into the boiling water, where it must remain for thirty minutes, boiling rapidly. Serve upon a dry napkin, garnished with parsley and with it * oysters or egg sauce. Notes.—If the cod should be of more than ordinary thickness, it must boil a few minutes longer, that it may become done through. This recipe may be used in boiling all large fish, except salmon. Salmon must be treated with this difference. It should be put to boil in tepid instead of boiling water, and thoroughly skimmed as it boils up. For boiling small and fresh water fish, use cold water, and the in- stant the boiling point is reached, remove the fish. In this way small fish may be prevented breaking in the kettle. If not provided with a fish kettle which has the plunging drainer, it is better to wrap the large fish in a single layer of course toweling. Sole au gratin.—This requires: one small sole, two heaped tablespoonfuls, of bread crumbs, one table- spoonful of chopped parsley, two small mushrooms, one ounce of butter, a piece of chalot the size of a bean, two tablespoonfuls of second stock, one saltspoonful of salt, one saltspoonful of pepper. First the bread crumbs must be put into a dry tin, and * See sauces, page 163.

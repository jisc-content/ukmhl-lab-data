Iced SoufB.^.â€”Yolks of six eggs, whites of two eggs, one pint of milk, two ounces of sugar, one-half tea- spoonful of grated nutmeg, one pint of double cream. Beat the whites and yolks of eggs together, add to these the nutmeg and sugar and, heating the milk until almost at the boiling point, pour this over the mixture, stirring all together while pouring in the milk. Pour this into the saucepan in which the milk was boiled, and stir it over the fire until the eggs begin to thicken, but exercising great care that the milk does not again boil. Put the custard into a bowl and allow it to stand until quite cold ; then one-half pint of the cream should be stirred in and the whole be poured into a freezer and frozen until stiff enough to be conveniently moulded. Work the frozen custard into a pint and a half souffle tin. Tie around the souffle tin a sheet of kitchen paper in such a manner as to increase the depth of the tin five or six inches. Whip the remaining cream to a stiff froth, pile this upon the top of the frozen custard, and setting the tin with its contents into a freezer, pile around this sufficient ice and rock salt to freeze the souffle. This should be transferred carefully, when frozen, to a silver souffle dish, or served in the tin in which it is pre- pared, with a napkin folded around the same.

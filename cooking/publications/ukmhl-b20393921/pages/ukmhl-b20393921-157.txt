FIG PUDDING, While the bread crumbs are soaking, pour over the almonds some boiling water to blanch them and remove their skins. Remove the skin from the suet and chop it very finely, and chop the almonds. Stir into it the bowl with the soaked bread crumbs the four remaining ounces of crumbs, add to this the chopped suet and almonds, also the grated rind of lemon together with the sugar and citron, which last must have been cut into very small pieces. Separate the yolks from the whites of the eggs very carefully, drop the yolks one by one into the bowl and stir all well together. Whip the whites of the eggs to a very stiff froth, add- ing the grain of salt to cool and lighten it. Mix this lightly also with the other ingredients in the bowl, and taking a quart mould, dry it thoroughly, and greasing the interior with butter, pour into it the mixture and place securely over the top a greased sheet of kitchen paper. Place the mould when filled, in a deep saucepan con- taining enough boiling water to reach half way up the sides, and let the pudding boil therein for two hours. When done the mould should be removed from the boiling water, allow two minutes for it to cool, and then turn the pudding out upon a hot platter. This pudding should be served either with a jam, wine or lemon sauce, to prepare which see directions for sauces, pages 167 and 168.

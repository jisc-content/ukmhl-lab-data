ME A TS, 54 a hot platter, the turnip and carrot filled into the centre, and the soubise poured around the whole. Ragout of Rabbit.—One rabbit, one-quarter of a pound of bacon, one teaspoonful of mixed dried herbs, six small mushrooms, one very small onion, one teaspoon- ful of salt, juice of one-half of a lemon, two ounces of flour, one tablespoonful of Harvey's sauce, one wineglass- ful of sherry, one gill of stock. The rabbit must first lie for an hour in strong salt and water, after which it should be cut into convenient pieces and dried thoroughly in a towel. The bacon should then be cut into dice, and putting it into a stew-pan and over a hot fire, fried until it is brown. Take out now the browned bacon and substitu- ting the pieces of rabbit there for, fry these also until brown, sprinkling in the flour as they cook which helps them to a fine color. While the meats are browning the mushrooms and onion should be chopped exceedingly fine—almost to a powder, and this sprinkled over the browned rabbit, also the salt, pepper and herbs. Stir all well together, then squeeze over it the lemon-juice, adding also the Harvey's sauce, sherry, and, last of all the stock. Cook slowly for one hour, stirring constantly mean- time as the perfection of this preparation lies in preserv- ing its exceeding dryness without letting it burn. Note.—Only a young rabbit is suitable for this dish as an old one requires too long for the cooking. The bacon is used for this preparation because of the fine flavor which it imparts, but butter may be substituted for it in cooking the rabbit, if more convenient or desirable.

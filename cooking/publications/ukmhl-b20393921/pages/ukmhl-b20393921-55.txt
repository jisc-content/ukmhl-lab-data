41 BOILED FOWL, Meantime the carrots should be well washed and thinly scraped, and three-quarters of an hour before the meat will be ready for serving, throw them in to cook with it. When this is done, mix next, in a large bowl, the suet, finely chopped, and flour ; add to this the baking-powder and salt and knead into a dry dough with the water. Divide this dough into six or eight pieces, roll each piece into a small ball and throw them one by one into the boiling liquor with the beef twenty minutes before serving. Note—The dropping in of the balls of dough cools the boiling liquor and care should therefore be taken to wait an instant between the putting in of each one that the liquid may boil up, otherwise the balls will burst apart,making a very ugly combination. Beef suet should be used unless the dish prepared is designed for the sick as it mixes most readily with other materials. For the sick, mutton suet should always be used as it is easier of digestion, being thinner in the fibre, although more difficult to manipulate. Boiled Fowl.—Egg Sauce.—Two fowls, three ounces of butter, one and one-half ounces of flour, one- half pint of milk, one-half pint of cream, two eggs, one saltspoonful of salt, one saltspoonful of pepper. After the fowls have been cleaned and singed, the legs must be chopped off at the first joint, and pocketed, which is done by pressing the bones inward until entirely sheathed in the skin. Take then a trussing-needle, threaded from a ball of twine, put the points of the wings behind the shoulders, and passing the needle through the under part of the first wing at the point of the joint, on through the thick part of the leg at the top, thence straight through the body, through the other leg and wing at the corresponding point, draw the thread after

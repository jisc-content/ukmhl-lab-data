127 RICE CROQUETTES, crumbs, and throwing them into hot clarified fat or lard, let them cook for five minutes. When done take them from the fat, place them for a moment upon a piece of kitchen paper to drain, arrange them neatly in a napkin folded in cup shape, and garnish with parsley. Rice Croquettes.—One quart of milk, three-quar- ters pounds of rice, three ounces of sugar, one teaspoon- ful of lemon juice, two eggs, four tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, one-half saltspoonful of salt. Wash the rice thoroughly, put it into a saucepan and pour over it the milk. Cover the saucepan closely, and putting it over the fire without having stirred the contents let all simmer slowly for twenty minutes. At the end of this time remove the saucepan from the fire, stir in the yolks of eggs, lemon juice, salt, and half of the sugar, beat all thoroughly together and turn out, when mixed, the compound into a bowl and let it stand until it becomes thoroughly cool. When this mixture is quite cold, mould it into small equal-sized balls, beat the whites of egg until quite light, and dip the balls therein. Roll them in the bread crumbs which must have been placed upon a sheet of kitchen paper for this pur- pose, and throwing the croquettes from this into hot clari- fied fat or lard, let them fry for two minutes. When done take them from the fat, place them upon a sheet of kitchen paper to drain for a moment, and serve them in a folded napkin with the remainder of the sugar sprinkled over them. Notes—If it is preferred, these croquettes can be made without the sugar, and if so done a little more salt may be used. It must be observed that the rice is not to be stirred when boiled

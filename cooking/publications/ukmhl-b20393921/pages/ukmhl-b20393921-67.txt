53 MUTTON SOUBISE, Mutton Soubise.â€”Five mutton chops, three table- spoonfuls of bread crumbs, one egg, two Spanish onions, one ounce of flour, one-half pint of milk, one saltspoon- f ul of salt, one-half saltspoonful of pepper, two ounces of butter, one ounce of clarified fat, two carrots, one turnip. First throw the onions into boiling water to draw out the greenness, and then allow them to stand in the soak over night. When ready to prepare the dish throw the onions again into boiling water, and let them boil in it for half an hour. Cut the carrot and turnip into small balls, with a French vegetable cutter and throw these also into boiling water, letting them boil for twenty minutes. Pre- pare the cutlets then by trimming the fat off and dipping them into a well beaten egg, when the bread crumbs should be put into a sheet of kitchen paper, seasoned with a little pepper and salt and the cutlets rolled from side to side therein until well covered. After the cutlets have been rolled thus in the bread crumbs the coating should be pressed on firmly and smoothly with the blade of a knife, and when the clarified fat has been heated in a frying-pan until the blue smoke arises from it, the cutlets should be dropped one by one therein, and cooked for seven minutes, turning them once in the pan while frying. While the cutlets are cooking the onions should be taken from the boiling water and chopped very finely. Put them then into a dry saucepan, and mix them to- gether with an ounce of flour, add by degrees the milk, pepper, and salt, when the saucepan must be placed over the fire and its contents stirred until the milk boils. When boiling add the butter, letting all cook together for two minutes. The cutlets should now be arranged in a circle upon

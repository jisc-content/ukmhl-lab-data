Maccaroni and Cheese.—Three ounces of mac- coroni, three ounces of grated Parmesan cheese, one-half pint of milk, two ounces of butter, one gill of cream, one egg, one teaspoonful of dry mustard, one saltspoonful of grated nutmeg, one saltspoonful of salt, one saltspoonful of pepper. Wash the maccaroni in cold water, and removing it from the water, place it into a saucepan, cover it with cold water, and let it boil in this for fifteen minutes. At the end of this time drain off the water, cover the maccaroni with the milk, and allow all to boil for three- quarters of an hour longer. When this is done put the cream into a bowl, beat it until very light, add the egg and beat both together until thoroughly blended. Season this mixture with the pepper, salt, cayenne and mustard, pour into it the boiled maccaroni, add to this two ounces of the cheese and one ounce of the butter, and when all has been well mixed, pour it out upon a platter, sprinkle over the remainder of the cheese, and distribute over also the remaining ounce of butter in small pieces. Place the platter in a mod- erate oven and bake its contents for ten minutes, and serve at once upon the dish upon which it is prepared. Egg-Plant.—One small egg-plant, two eggs, four tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, one-half teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, three ounces of butter. Slice the egg-plant very thinly, and pour over the slices some boiling water, allowing them to soak in this for ten minutes.

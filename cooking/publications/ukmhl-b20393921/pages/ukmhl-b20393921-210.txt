196 BREAD AND CAKES, ounces of butter, one-half pint of sweet milk, three eggs, three teaspoonfuls of baking-powder. The flour, corn meal and sugar must first be well mixed together, and the baking-powder must be added to these. Melt the butter and pour it into the centre of the prepared flour and mix all to a batter with the milk. Break the eggs into a small bowl and beat them until very light, pour this over the batter and stir it in. Grease a bread pan or pudding dish and pour the bat- ter into it, filling it about half full. Place this in a quick oven and bake for twenty minutes. Serve hot, covered with a napkin. Note.—If corn bread is preferred not sweetened, the sugar may be left out of the above preparation. Galettes.—One ounce of compressed yeast, one dessert spoonful of sugar, one and one-half gills of milk, one gill of cold water, two pounds of flour, seven eggs. Put the yeast and the sugar into a mixing bowl. Bring the milk and water to a tepid degree of heat and pour- ing this over the powdered yeast and sugar, stir these together until both sugar and yeast dissolve. Mix into this as much flour as will make a firm dough, covered with a towel, and place it in a warm place to rise, which will take about two hours. Put into another bowl one pound of the flour, and into this drop one by one, the eggs. To this add half a gill of milk, and beat all together with the hand for fifteen min- utes. When the dough has risen, mix into it the beaten flour, egg and milk; beat all again with the hand until the different components are thoroughly blended.

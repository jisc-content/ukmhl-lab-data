29 FRIED SMELTS. crumbs, one teaspoonful of chopped thyme, one dessert spoonful of chopped parsley, one egg, one saltspoonful of salt, one saltspoonful of pepper. The haddock must be thoroughly dried after cleaning and the tail and fins cut off leaving the head. Make a stuffing by mixing two tablespoonfuls of the bread crumbs with the parsley, thyme, pepper and salt into which drop the egg to give the dressing consistency. Pack this stuff- ing snugly into the stomach of the fish, sew the sides together with needle and thread, place it in a greased baking pan, dampen it over with milk or egg, sprinkle over it the remainder of the bread crumbs and bake three quarters of an hour in a moderate oven, taking occasion to baste from time to time with the drippings. Note—To bake evenly the fish should stand in the pan in the position which it naturally takes in the water, and this may be ac- complished by placing a long skewer first through the tail of the fish, next through the centre of the body and lastly through the head. A strong cord passed in the same manner through the fish and drawn taut will serve the purpose. Salmon, trout, sea bass, and shad may be done also after this recipe. Fried Smelts.—One dozen smelts, two tablespoon- fuls of flour, two eggs, four tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, one teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of pepper. Take first the flour and the bread crumbs and place them upon separate sheets of kitchen paper. Mix with the bread crumbs the salt and pepper, when the fish have been thoroughly prepared, dip them one by one into the flour for the purpose of drying them. Beat now the eggs until very light and roll the fish one by one therein, place them then into the bread crumbs, rolling each from side to side

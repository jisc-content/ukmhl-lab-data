THE ART OF COOKING. SOUPS. Brown Stock.â€”For this stock there will be required material in the following quantities : Four pounds of the shin of beef, four young carrots, four Bermuda onions, one small turnip, one-half head of celery, one-half tablespoonful of salt, one-half teaspoon- ful of white pepper-corns, one-half teaspoonful of black peppercorns. First, cutting all of the meat from the bone, remove the marrow, and break up the bone with a hammer. Put the meat and bone together in a large saucepan and pour over these five pints of cold water, placing the saucepan over the fire. Bring the water now quickly to the boiling point and skim off, when boiling, all of the scum that arises to the surface. Throw into the saucepan then the salt, which will bring any remaining albumen or scum to the top, when, skimming once more, add to the contents of the pan the carrot, turnip and celery all cut into very small pieces. Before adding the onion blanch it with boiling water, to draw from it the greenness which produces in- digestion, having done which, put it together with the pepper-corns into the saucepan and allow all again to boil. When this is done, draw the saucepan to the side of the fire, cover it closely, and allow its contents to simmer

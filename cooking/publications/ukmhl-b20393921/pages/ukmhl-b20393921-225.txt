211 POTATO SAUTE, Take eight of the largest mushrooms, skin them and cut off the stalks. Chop the eschalot as finely as possible, and chop also finely the remainder of the mushrooms. Put the butter into a frying pan, and place this over the fire letting the butter melt and become hot. Brown in this the eschalot and chopped mushrooms, sprinkle over them the pepper and salt, and stuff the centre of the eight skinned mushrooms with this mixture. Sprinkle over each of these equal portions of the bread crumbs, place the mushrooms into a baking tin, and placing this in a brisk oven, let them bake therein until a skewer will easily penetrate to the centres of the mushrooms. Take the mushrooms when done carefully from the tin to avoid breaking them or disarranging the stuffing in their centres, and serve them in a hot dish. Potato Saute.—One quart of potatoes, one and one-half ounces of butter, one teaspoonful of salt, one saltspoonful of white pepper. Young potatoes should be used for this preparation, and should be first scraped, then thrown into boiling water, and allowed to boil rapidly for ten minutes. Drain the water carefully from them, cover the saucepan, and let the potatoes cook in their own steam until a fork will pierce easily to their centres. When done, sprinkle over the potatoes the pepper and salt, throw in with these the butter, and shake the sauce- pan over the fire until the potatoes become a pale brown upon their surfaces. Serve very hot. Note.—Old potatoes may be used for a saute if young ones are

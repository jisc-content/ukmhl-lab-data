GRENADINES OF VEAL. 89 quinelles, when they must be put into the saute-pan carefully, that they may not lose their shape, and when the pan is so filled, pour in at the side as much boiling water as will cover the quinelles, when they should be placed over a slow fire and allowed to poach for ten minutes. Now melt in a small saucepan the remaining ounce of butter, stir into it the remaining ounce of flour, add by degrees a gill of stock and let all boil up. When boiling, pour in the cream, season with pepper and salt, and taking it from the fire, add then the lemon-juice. Arrange the quinelles when done, and taken from the water, in a circle upon a flat dish, and pour the sauce around them. Note—When a mortar and pestle are not available, the veal may be first cooked a little in boiling stock, and then chopped as finely as possible, before being passed through the sieve. Grenadines of Veal.—Two pounds of filet of veal, one carrot, one turnip, one head of celery, one pint of white stock, six ounces of fat bacon, one teaspoonful of whole white pepper, one-half teaspoonful of salt. Removing the skin from the veal, cut it into shapely oval pieces about half an inch in thickness. Cut the bacon into thin strips two inches long and one-third of an inch wide, and threading a larding needle with the bacon, lard the ovals of veal as thickly as possible with it. Place in a saucepan the vegetables cut in small pieces, over which sprinkle the pepper and salt, and pouring in around the vegetables the stock, bring all to the boiling point.

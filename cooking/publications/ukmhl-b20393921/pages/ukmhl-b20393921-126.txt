VEGETABLES. 112 Wash the parsnips as cleanly as possible in cold water, when they must be put into a saucepan of boiling water in which the salt has been dissolved. Boil them from half an hour to three-quarters of an hour, as their age and size may demand, and when boiled until tender take them from the water, one by one, rubbing each in a clean towel to remove the skin, which will have become loosened by boiling. Place them in a heated vegetable dish, and when the butter has been melted, the milk added thereto, to- gether with the pepper and nutmeg, and all boiled, this should be poured over the parsnips and all immediately served. Note—To fry parsnips they must first be plainly boiled, then skinned, dried in a towel and split into halves and fried in hot melted butter until browned. Leeks au Gratin.—Provide : Eight leeks, one- half tablespoonful of salt, one ounce of butter, one ounce of flour, one-half pint of second stock, one saltspoonful of grated nutmeg, three ounces of grated cheese. Remove first the fibrous roots from the leeks, cut off the green stalks, leaving about an inch length of them on for use. Put them into a bowl and covering them with boiling water let the leek soak for ten minutes. At the expiration of this time put them into a saucepan of boil- ing water into which throw the salt and let all boil for three-quarters of an hour. While the leeks are boiling, mix together in a saucepan placed over the fire, the butter and flour, to which add the stock by degrees, and let all cook for two minutes, after which season with the pepper, throw in the nutmeg and one ounce of the cheese.

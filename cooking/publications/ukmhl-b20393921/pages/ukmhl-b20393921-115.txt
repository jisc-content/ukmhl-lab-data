BOILED SUMMER SQUASH. lOI Boiled Cabbage.—For this provide : one head of cabbage, three tablespoonsful of beef-drippings, one tea- spoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, one lump of saleratus the size of a pea. Select a large, firm head of cabbage, wash it well and cut away the coarse outer leaves. This done cut off the stalk and make cuts in the base of the cabbage, cross- ing each other in the centre, so that the water may pene- trate to the heart and cook it equally. Prepare a large saucepan of boiling water, into which throw the saleratus, put into this the cabbage, covering the pan until the water boils up, when removing the cover, it must be allowed to boil rapidly, until a skewer or fork will pierce readily through it. Remove the cabbage now to a cullender and let the water drain from it, and chop it roughly with a knife when drained. When chopped put it into a vegetable dish, pour over it the beef-drippings, sprinkle over the pepper and salt, when it must be tossed about with a fork very quickly in order that the cabbage may not cool. When the seasoning is thoroughly distributed send it at once to the table. Notes—This may be cooked exactly the same way and served whole if preferred, in which case the dripping must be heated and poured over and the pepper and salt sprinkled over afterwards. Cabbage may also be boiled very palatably in the liquor in which either salt beef or salt pork is boiled. Boiled Summer Squash.—Take for this purpose : two medium sized squashes, two ounces of butter, one- half teaspoonful of pepper, one dessert spoonful of salt. The squashes must first be pared, then cut into slices and put into cold water for ten minutes.

207 HAM OMELETTE, Put one ounce of the butter into a saucepan. Cut each kidney into eight pieces, put the flour upon a plate and roll the pieces of kidney in it until they are com- pletely blanketed with the flour. Throw the kidney into the hot butter and brown each piece well upon both sides. Pour into the saucepan, over the browned kidney, the stock and catsup, season all with half of the pepper and salt, and covering the saucepan draw it to the side of the fire, and let its contents cook very slowly for one hour. Beat in a bowl the eggs until the yolks and whites are mixed, sprinkle over them the remainder of the pepper and salt, melt an ounce of the butter in an omelette pan pour into this half of the well beaten egg, and stir this with a spoon until it begins to firm around the edges, after which it should remain upon the fire until the egg becomes nearly all firm. Put upon the omelette half of the stewed kidney, fold the omelette over so that the outer edges meet. Let it remain a minute longer in the pan and turn it quickly out upon a hot platter. Repeat this process with the remaining egg and kidney and when the second omelette is ready, place it beside the first upon the platter and serve as speedily as possible.

100 VEGETABLES. teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, one sprig of mint. Place the peas in a large saucepan of boiling water, in which should be thrown the sprig of mint, and covering, let them boil rapidly from ten to twenty minutes, as the age of the peas may require. The moment the peas are done, they must be taken from the water and drained, as over cooking spoils them. While the peas are draining, melt the butter, in the sauce- pan in which they have been cooked, and when this is melted, throw back into it the peas, sprinkle over them the pepper, salt and sugar, and, covering the saucepan, shake it over the fire until the peas are very hot, taking care that they neither brown nor break. Turnips.â€”For this take : six turnips, two table- spoonsfuls of beef dripping, one teaspoonful of salt, one- half teaspoonful of pepper, one tablespoonful of cream. First pare the turnips, taking care to cut off the white lining of the skin which is bitter, and the thickness of which will be perceived by the clearly defined circle discovered in cutting off the top. Wash the turnips thoroughly in cold water to whiten them and remove the finger marks, and putting them into a saucepan, cover them with boiling water, and closing the lid of the saucepan boil them rapidly until a fork will easily penetrate to their centres. When done, drain the water well off them, add the beef- dripping, pepper and salt, and with a potato-masher mash them finely, using a fork occasionally to break the lumps. When mashed stir in with them the cream, and pile them high in a vegetable dish, smoothing the edges around with a knife.

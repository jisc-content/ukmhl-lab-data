26 FISH. FISH. Filet de Sole, a la Maitre d'Hotel.—Take for this : two large sole, two ounces of butter, one-half ounce of flour, four tablespoonfuls of cream, one-half teaspoon- ful of lemon-juice, one dessert spoonful of chopped pars- ley, one-half saltspoonful of salt, one-half saltspoonful of pepper. Begin this by reversing the usual rule for cleaning fish, skin the sole first and then filet it. To do this the skin must be loosened at the tail, the fish being held firmly to the table with a dry towel, and with the disengaged hand the skin quickly torn off. This process must be repeated as the sole has two distinct sides to be relieved of skin Make then an incision straight down the back with a sharp knife, and pressing the knife as closely as possible to the backbone, separate the flesh from it, removing the four filets. Roll each filet separately,—in the fashion of a rolled jelly-cake, place them side by side in a slightly greased tin, squeeze over each a little of the lemon-juice, to preserve their color, cover them with a piece of greased kitchen-paper and bake in a brisk oven ten minutes. While the filets are baking, cover the heads and skins of the fish with cold water, and boil for five minutes ; then melt in a small saucepan the butter, add to it the flour and one gill of the liquor, obtained by boiling the heads and skins, boil all for two minutes, stirring meantime, when it must be taken from the fire and the cream, pepper and salt added. Put the filets now into a flat dish, pour this sauce around them, and sprinkle over each filet a little of the chopped parsley. And serve.

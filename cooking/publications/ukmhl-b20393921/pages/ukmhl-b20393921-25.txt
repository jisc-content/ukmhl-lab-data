Note—In departing from the usual mode of using either cold water or cold stock as above, it is to be noted that the boiling water is here used to keep the meat from darkening, which it has a ten- dency to do. Note—If it should be desired, the small, nice pieces of meat may be added to this soup, and also a soup of squirrel may be made after this same method. MuUigatawney Soup.—Materials and quantities; one fowl, two quarts of cold water, two onions, two ounces of butter, two ounces of flour, one tablespoonful of curry- powder, one teaspoonful of sugar, one-half teacupful of whole rice, one desserts poonful of salt, one teaspoonful of whole white pepper. Begin this preparation by first covering the fowl with the two quarts of water, and bring it to boiling over a quick fire. When it boils up and has been skimmed, add the pepper-corns, salt and onions, then boil slowly until the meat of the fowl becomes tender. Now removing the fowl from the saucepan, cut the meat from the breast and legs, making the same into small pieces to thicken the soup with later, and return the bones and remaining fowl to the stock, when all must be allowed to boil for one hour longer, and then strained. The butter has then to be melted in a fresh saucepan, and the flour, curry-powder and sugar added, with which put the strained stock, and whole rice, and boil the whole for twenty minutes.

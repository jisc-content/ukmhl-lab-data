VANILLA ICE CREAM, ICES, CREAMS AND JELLIES. CREAMS. Strawberry Ice Cream.—One pint of milk, four eggs, one and one-half pints of fresh strawberries, one quart of cream, one-half pound of sugar.

When this is done add the sugar to the syrup so formed and when the custard has become quite cold, stir the fruit mixture into it. Add the cream and stirring this well through the custard, pour all into a freezer, and freeze until quite solid, stirring the cream down from the sides from time to time, to keep it smooth while freezing unless the freezer be arranged to do this while being turned.

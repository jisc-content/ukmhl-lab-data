When the eggs are done remove the spinach from its saucepan and pile it high in the centre of a vegetable dish, smoothing the edges around and the top with a knife blade. Take the eggs from the water with a skim- ming spoon, and arrange them upon the flat top of the spinach. This dish should be garnished for serving with cor- ners of fried bread or toast.

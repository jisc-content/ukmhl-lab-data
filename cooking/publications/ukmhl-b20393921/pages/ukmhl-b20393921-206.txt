BREAD AND CAKES, 192 First place the butter and milk together in a tin basin and placing this over the fire, let them heat until the milk becomes tepid. Put the yeast into a mixing bowl, and pour over this the tepid mixture. Beat the egg thoroughly, and pour this also into the bowl, together with the salt, stir into the mixture the flour, cover the bowl with a cloth and stand it in a warm place for two hours, to allow its con- tents to become light. At the end of this time knead the light dough until it cleaves from the sides of the bowl, after which divide it into twelve rolls, form them upon a mixing board and place them on a slightly floured baking tin, and allowing them to stand to rise for twenty minutes, bake in a quick oven for ten minutes. Serve hot. Milk Biscuit.—One gill of milk, one ounce of but- ter, one teaspoonful of baking powder, one-half pound of flour, one saltspoonful of salt.

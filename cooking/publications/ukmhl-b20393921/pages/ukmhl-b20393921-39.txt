25 LOBSTER CUTLETS. of cream, one-half teaspoonful of lemon-juice, one grain of cayenne, one saltspoonful of salt, one saltspoonful of pepper, one egg, three tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs. The lobster should be put into boiling water for twenty minutes after which the head must be twisted off and the coral that runs down the back removed. Beat this coral with half an ounce of butter together in a mortar, and to make it perfectly smooth rub it through a wire sieve. Now melt in a saucepan the remainder of the butter, add thereto the flour and cold water, stir all until the water boils, and then allow it to boil two minutes, Take it now from the fire, and add the coral, cream, pepper and salt, lemon-juice and cayenne. When this is done cut the lobster into small, convenient pieces, and mix them well with the contents of the saucepan. Turn all now out upon a plate and set to cool for one hour. When cool, divide into five pieces and form into cutlets, similar in shape to cutlets of lamb, dip them lightly into the egg, which must have been well beaten, roll them in the bread crumbs, which must have been placed upon kitchen paper for the purpose, from side to side, and fry for two minutes in hot clarified fat or lard. When done put them to drain for a moment upon a clean piece of kitchen-paper and serve on a hot napkin, garnished with the claws of the lobster. Note.â€”The female lobster should be selected for this dish as it alone furnishes the coral which gives both a delicious flavor and beautiful color to the composition.

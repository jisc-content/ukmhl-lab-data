FRENCH OR STRING BEANS, When the leeks are done take them from the boiling water, drain them, and place them upon a gratin-dish. Pour over them half of the sauce from the saucepan, sprinkle over with the remainder of the cheese and plac- .ing the dish in a quick oven let all become slightly- browned. When browned remove the dish from the oven pour around the leeks the remaining sauce and serve. Note.—When a silver gratin-dish is not available, an ordinary flat dish may be used, with the consideration that it must be some- thing that will not be injured by the heat and also that the prepara- tion must be served in the same dish in which it is baked, French or String Beans.—Provide : One quart of beans, two ounces of butter, one saltspoonful of pepper, one dessert spoonful of salt, one grain of cayenne. First string the beans observing always to begin at the stem end of the pod when the strings will strip easily down- ward. Lay them flat upon a board and with a sharp knife cut them through the centres lengthwise, when they must be gathered into small bunches of equal size and secured with a piece of twine. Place the bunches now into a saucepan two-thirds full of boiling water in which the salt has been disolved and bcil them for twenty minutes if the beans are very young, but if older they will require quite half an hour to become tender. When done drain off the water, and transferring each little bunch to a vegetable dish and cutting the strings arrange them neatly therein. Melt the butter, season it with the cayenne and pep- per and pour it over all just before serving.

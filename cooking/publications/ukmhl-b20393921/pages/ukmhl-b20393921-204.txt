BREAD AND CAKES, 190 BREAD AND CAKES. BREAD. Wheat Bread.â€”Three and one-half pounds of flour, one ounce of compressed yeast, one dessert spoon- ful of salt, one and three-quarters pints of tepid water. Place in a large mixing bowl or pan three pounds of the flour and mix with it the salt. Put the yeast cake into a bowl and covering it with the tepid water let it dissolve. Make a hole in the centre of the flour and into this pour the yeast and water, pouring it through a strainer to remove any remaining lump. Stir into this from the side the dry flour, until all becomes smooth, and covering the bowl place it in a warm, dry place giving its contents two hours in which to rise. At the end of this time sprinkle the remaining half pound of flour over the light dough and knead all to- gether until the dough cleaves cleanly from the sides of the bowl or pan. Divide the dough into two equal parts, mould these into loaves and greasing slightly two bread pans, place the loaves therein and set them in a warm place for half an hour to rise. When this time expires place the bread pans into a moderate oven and bake the bread for one hour and a half. When done the bread should be placed upon a sieve or folded towel to cool before being put away, otherwise the steam which it generates,being put into a close place hot, will make it damp and heavy, and inclined to crumble when dry.

BOILED POTATOES. Note.—Old carrots may be used also in this way but they must first be scraped and pared down to uniform sizes, and also will re- quire a little longer boiling. Boiled Potatoes.—For this provide : ten potatoes, one-half tablespoonful of salt. Select the potatoes of nearly an equal size, and wash them well in cold water. Pare them very thinly, as the best part of the potato lies nearest the skin, and putting them into a saucepan, cover them with cold water and bring the water quickly to the boiling point. Throw in the salt and covering the saucepan, let the whole boil rapidly until the surfaces of the potatoes begin to crack; then the water must be drained entirely off, leaving the pota- toes dry in the saucepan, and re-covering them, put the saucepan at one side of the fire, turn it occasionally that they may not catch on the bottom and let them cook in their own steam until they can be easily pierced with a skewer. When done remove the cover and set the saucepan for a moment over the fire to aid the escape of the steam and dry off any moisture. They must be carefully trans- ferred to a vegetable dish in order to preserve them un- broken. Notes—Instead of serving these potatoes whole they may be passed through a collender or coarse wire sieve directly into a vegetable dish, the vegetable dish should be put into a very quick oven and the pota- toes browned over the top. Served in this way the potatoes have a beautiful light appearance resembling well boiled rice, beside being most delicious to the taste. New potatoes should be boiled after the above method with this difference. They must be scraped instead of pared and thrown into boiling water to boil instead of into cold. If the potatoes are desired plainly mashed, a little cream and but-

CHAUD-FROID OF CHICKEN: 85 cutter if the first be not convenient, cut in each a smaller circle, about one inch from the edges, half way through the crust, and placing both upon a baking tin, bake in a hot quick oven for twenty minutes. When done remove the crust from the inner circle by slipping in a knife-blade and splitting it asunder, scrape out the centre of the vol-au-vent in order to make a hol- low in which to pack the sweet-breads, put into each equal parts of the sweet-bread, sprinkle over the meat the re- mainder of the lemon-juice, cover over it the little baked circle previously split out, garnish with fresh sprigs of parsley and send to table in a hot napkin. Notes—The difficulty in making the vol-au-vent paste lies in its becoming heated in rolling and the butter, which is used in excessive proportion, running in consequence. This may be prevented by put- ting it to cool between rollings and taking a little longer time for its preparation. It is really puff-paste that is used for the vol-au-vent and the crust should rise in baking at least three inches. Chaud-froid of Chicken.—One young fowl, two ounces of butter, two ounces of flour, one-half pint of milk, one gill of cream, one saltspoonful of salt, one saltr spoonful of white pepper, one quart of second stock, one-half ounce of gelatine, one tablespoonful of vinegar, one sprig of parsley, one gill of cold water, whites of three eggs, one-half teaspoonful of black pepper. This dish requires two days for its preparation, and therefore its use must be anticipated. Melt first the gelatine in half of the cold water, and let it stand for ten minutes ; put then the stock into a copper or porcelain-lined saucepan, add to it the vinegar, parsley

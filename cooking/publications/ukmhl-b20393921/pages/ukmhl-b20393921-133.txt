119 SHRIMP SALAD, must be poured over the salad in the salad bowl, and the dish garnished with the fresh green leaves of the lettuce. Shrimp Salad.—One can of shrimps, two heads of lettuce, one gill of salad oil, one tablespoonful of vine- gar, one teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of white pepper, yolks of two eggs. The heads of lettuce should be carefully trimmed, well washed and thoroughly dried in a towel, avoiding as much as possible the crushing of the leaves, which causes them to wilt. They should next be picked apart, and the outer leaves torn into medium sized pieces, reserving the tender inner leaves for garnishing. Place the torn lettuce in the bottom of a salad bowl, and removing the shrimps carefully from the bag in w^hich they are put into the can, take from them any bits of shell or specks of black that may mar them, taking care not to break their form, and pile these high upon the lettuce in the centre of the bowl. Put the yolks of eggs into a small bowl, drop in upon them, drop by drop, the salad oil, and beat these to a thick cream when the vinegar must be added, also the pepper and salt, and all stirred together until thor- oughly blended. Pour this dressing over the shrimps, garnish around the sides and in the centre of the top, with the pale deli- cate inner leaves of lettuce and serve. This salad must not be mixed at all until it is served at table, as to stir it destroys the fine appearance of the shrimp, which are so delicate as to be easily broken. Notes—Mayonnaise dressing should invariably be stirred one

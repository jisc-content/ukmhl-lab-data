Five minutes before the asparagus is done, take a small saucepan, and mixing it in the butter and the flour, add to this by degrees a gill and a half of the liquor in which the asparagus is boiling. Stir this with the butter and flour until the mixture boils, when the milk should be added, and two minutes additional boiling allowed. Season with the salt and pepper, and drawing the sauce- pan aside from the fire, stir into it the cream. Take the asparagus from the water at the expiration of the twenty minutes, and drain it upon a wire sieve, place it in a vegetable dish and pour the sauce carefully around and across the tips, exercising caution not to spatter the ends of the stalks that are to be taken in the fingers. Notes—Asparagus may be boiled in the above manner, and served upon toast instead of with the white sauce. A very simple manner of boiling this vegetable, is to stand the unbroken bundle of asparagus upon the stalk end upright in a sauce- pan containing boiling water enough to reach nearly to the tender green tips. It must be boiled rapidly until tender, and then, prepar- ing a hot napkin upon a platter, take the asparagus from the water, and draining it for a moment, place it upon the napkin, cut the bands and draw them away, and fold over all snugly the ends of the napkin. The white sauce which is used for this, must be served in a gravy boat. A favorite way of serving boiled asparagus, is to make it very cold by standing in the ice-box, and then serve with a sauce piquant, com- posed of vinegar, pepper, salt and salad oil. In this way, asparagus may be used as a salad. Green Peas.—One quart of shelled peas, one ounce of butter, one-half teaspoonful of powdered sugar, one

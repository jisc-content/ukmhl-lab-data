ME A TS. 46 Hot-pot.—One and one-half pounds of lean mutton, two pounds of raw potatoes, one and one-half ounces of flour, one dessert spoonful of salt, one-half dessert spoon- " ful of pepper, one saltspoonful of grated nutmeg, one tablespoonful of catsup, one ounce of butter, one-half pint of cold water. When the potatoes have been pared, put them into cold water, and allow them to come to the boiling point, which being reached, they are at once to be taken out. Slice then enough of the potatoes to cover the bottom of a good sized vegetable dish, putting them in in layers, after which cut the mutton into small, convenient pieces, roll each piece into a mixture made of the flour, pepper, salt and nutmeg, and put them into the dish in layers alter- nating with the layers of potato, until the contents are level with the top. The remaining potatoes should be cut in half and arranged over the top leaving the round sides up. Melt the butter and brush it over the top of the potatoes to prevent their hardening in the oven, pour the catsup and water in at the side of the dish, and bake in a moderate oven for an hour and a half. Note—Potatoes should never be used without being put first into cold water and then brought to the boiling point. This draws out the greenness, which produces indigestion and is exceedingly in- jurious to some stomachs. ^ Stewed Beef.—Four pounds of stewing beef, two carrots, two turnips, one onion, one-half ounce of flour, one ounce of butter, three gills of second stock, one-half tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce, one-half table- spoonful of catsup, one teaspoonful of salt, one-half tea- spoonful of pepper.

122 SALADS, Chop the Aspic jelly now coarsely, and arrange a wall of it around the sides of the salad bowl, taking care to keep *the centre clear, and within this wall place the lobster cutlets in a circle. Into each of the cutlets stick one of the feelers from the lobster, rub the head with a little oil to brighten and bring out the color, and place it in the centre of the dish. Take the dried coral, and either pound it lightly in a mortar, or roll it fine upon aboard with a rolling pin, and sprinkle a little of this over each cutlet, and the remainder over the wall of jelly. Notes—To boillobsters, plunge them into boiling water in which a little salt has been dissolved, and boil them for twenty minutes rapidly. A plain lobster salad may be made by following the directions for shrimp salad, by substituting the meat of the lobster cut in coarse pieces for the shrimps. Cucumber Salad.—Three medium sized green cucumbers, two tablespoonfuls of salad oil, one table- spoonful of vinegar, one teaspoonful of salt, one-half tea- spoonful of black pepper. The cucumbers should be kept upon the ice until thoroughly chilled which renders them pleasantly brittle, after which they should be pared lengthwise, taking care to cut deep enough to remove all of the green inner skin which is exceedingly bitter, and when pared slice them into round thin slices. Arrange these slices in a mound in a shallow salad bowl and mixing together the pepper, salt, oil and vinegar, pour this dressing over the cucumbers and stir all together until the dressing is well distributed when serving.

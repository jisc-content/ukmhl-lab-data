167 BRANDY SAUCE, whisk until the froth arises and from it the escaping steam. Remove the sauce from the fire and serve. Jam Sauce.—One heaped tablespoonful of jam, one-half ounce of sugar, one gill of sherry, one tablespoon- ful of cold water, six drops of cochineal. Place the jam in a small saucepan, pour over it the sherry and water, add to these the sugar and stir all over a brisk fire until the mixture boils. When boiling drop in the cochineal and the sauce is ready for serving. Xjemon Sauce.—One lemon, six pieces of cut loaf sugar, one teacupful of cold water. Pare the rind from the lemon and cut this into strips the size of a straw. Put these straws of lemon-rind into a small saucepan together with the lumps of sugar and covering these with the cold water squeeze into the mix- ture the juice of the lemon. Put the saucepan over the fire and stir the contents until boiling; when this takes place cover the saucepan, and drawing it to one side of the fire, let all simmer slowly for twenty minutes. This sauce should be poured over the pudding with which it is served, in order that the straws of lemon-rind may garnish the top of the pudding. Brandy Sauce.—One ounce of butter, one-half ounce of flour, one-half pint of cold water, one wine- glassful of brandy, one ounce of sugar. The butter must first be melted in a small saucepan, the flour stirred into it, and the water then added. When this comes to the boiling point let it continue to boil for two minutes, add the brandy and sugar, and when all is well stirred together, it is ready for serving.

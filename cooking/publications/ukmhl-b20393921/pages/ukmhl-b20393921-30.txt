i6 SOUPS, single cream, one ounce of butter, one-half saltspoonful of salt, and the same amount of pepper. So provided, put into the saucepan the potatoes, pared and sliced, the celery, onion and butter, stirring all over the fire for five minutes, taking care that they do not dis- color. Add now one pint of stock, and let it boil slowly until the potatoes are cooked done, then pass all through a sieve, using the remaining one-half pint of stock hot, to prevent the gluten of the potatoes from stiffening and clogging in the sieve. The saucepan should then be well washed and the puree returned to it, the cream, pepper and salt added, and stirred until it boils. This should be served with fried bread or asparagus tips, arranging either in the tureen as before directed, and pouring the puree over. Note.—By single cream, that is meant which arises in twelve hours. Double cream arises in twenty-four hours, and cream for but- ter in forty-eight hours. General Notes on Purees.—These purees are intended to suf- fice for serving four persons, and the apparent inequality of liquids used will be found to correspond with the different lengths of time for boiling which is, of course, the reducing process. If it should happen that the puree is thickened unduly by boiling too quickly, this fault may be remedied by adding more of the stock while it is being passed through the sieve. OYSTERS AND OTHER SHELLFISH. Oyster Soup ^-la~Reiue.—One quart of oysters, one pint of white stock, one-half pint of cream, one and one-half ounces of butter, one ounce of flour, one blade of

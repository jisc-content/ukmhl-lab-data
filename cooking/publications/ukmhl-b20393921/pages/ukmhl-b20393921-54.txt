Fifteen minutes before the mutton will be done, pre- pare the sauce by melting in a saucepan the butter, and stirring into this the dry flour. When the flour and but- ter are thoroughly mixed, add one gill and a half of the liquor that the mutton is boiling in, also the milk, pepper and salt, cook all two minutes to swell the grains of the flour. Then take the mutton up and place it on a large hot platter, pour over it the sauce, adding just before doing this the capers, in order that their color may not be lost by standing in the hot liquid. Note—The plunging of the mutton first into boiling water is for the purpose of hardening the albumen and confining the juices of the meat; it is then allowed to cook slowly, that the fibre may not toughen, which rapid boiling would inevitably bring about.

Place over the fire a large saucepan two-thirds full of cold water and put into it the meat. Bring this quickly to the boiling point over a hot' fire, and when it boils, skim thoroughly. When the albumen has all been displaced and the scum all taken off, draw the saucepan aside from the blaze, and allowing fifteen minutes to each pound of meat, and fifteen minutes over, let the beef boil gently until done.

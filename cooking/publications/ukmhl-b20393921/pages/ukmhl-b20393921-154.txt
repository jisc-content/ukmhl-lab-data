SOUFFL^.S. I40 Transfer the pan to a quick oven and allow it to re- main there for five minutes. Turn the souffle out quickly upon a hot platter, fold it evenly together and serve at once. A tablespoonful of jelly or jam may be placed in the centre of the souffle when served, if desired. Notes.—Salt is added to the whites of eggs for the purpose of cooling them, and, if in the slightest degree stale, to aid in bringing them more quickly and lightly to a froth. The whites of eggs must be whipped upon a dry plate and with a dry knife as the slightest moisture will prevent their coming to a froth, and unless the frolh of egg be very stiff the omelette souffle will be made heavy by it and so spoiled. Cheese Souffle.—One ounce of butter, one ounce of flour, one gill of milk, one-half teaspoonful of white pepper, one-half teaspoooful of salt, one grain of cayenne, three ounces of grated cheese, yolks of three eggs, whites of four eggs. Melt the butter in a small saucepan and stir into it the flour, adding also the milk and stirring all until boil- ing. Throw into the boiling mixture the pepper, salt and cayenne, when removing the saucepan from the fire, the yolks of egg must be added together with the grated cheese and the whole very thoroughly beaten to- gether. Whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth and stir this in also, using care not to beat down the froth. Fill this mixture equally into small paper ramakins or cups, or into tin cups if more convenient, and bake them in a quick oven for ten minutes. Arrange the cups when the souffles are done upon a hot plate and serve imme- diately.

18 SOUPS. Note.—Wh*en soft clams are not available the number may be made up with the ordinary hard clam, and if these should be large, it might be better to chop them, not too fine. When pilot biscuit are not to be obtained, hard crackers may be substituted. Clam Soup.—Procure: one quart of clams, one pint of milk, three ounces of butter, one grain of cayenne, one- half teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, one ounce of flour. The clams must first be strained and the liquor re- duced by taking one third or its quantity, and adding to it two thirds of water and the liquid so produced brought to the boiling point. Melt then the butter in a separate saucepan, add to it the flour, then the milk, and stir the mixture until it boils. Add now the pepper, salt, cayenne and clams, which should be cut into pieces, and pour over this the boiling liquor, allowing all to cool, until the pieces of clam are tender, probably ten minutes, and serve hot. Stewed Terrapin.—For this there will be required: one terrapin, seven ounces of butter, one and one half ounces of flour, one gill of cream, one-half pint of madeira wine, one grain of cayenne, one-half saltspoonful of salt, and an equal quantity of pepper. Begin by throwing the terrapin into boiling water, and boiling it until the claws will draw out. This will take from thirty to forty-five minutes. The shell should now be drawn asunder, which may be readily accomplished by inserting the fingers at the aperture of the neck. Pick out then the meat, exercising caution not to break the bladder, the gall, or the sand bags, which are of course, to be considered as refuse.

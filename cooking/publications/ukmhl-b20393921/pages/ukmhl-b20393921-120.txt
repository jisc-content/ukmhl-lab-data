VEGETABLES, io6 to cover the ear in its natural fashion, and secured at the tip end with a piece of twine. Prepare a large saucepan of boiling water into which throw the salt and then the corn, laying the ears in the* fashion of a cob-house, that the water may boil equally through and around all. The corn must be left to boil twenty-five or thirty minutes, unless very young, when twenty minutes will do. Serve in the husk, having first removed the binding twines, and covered closely with a folded napkin. Notes—Corn may be overdone as well as other vegetables, but by watching when the kernels are swelled to their largest size and the prick of a fork will bring a little puff of steam followed by the shriv- eling of the kernel, no mistake of this kind need be made. An in- stants longer boiling when this point is reached, will cause the small puff of steam generated, to find its own outlet, and the corn will shrivel and become watery in consequence. Green corn may also be stewed very palatably by being cut from the cob, put into a saucepan with such equal parts of milk and water as will cover the corn nicely, and when stewed until the kernels lose their milky rawness, season with the pepper, salt, and a lump of ■butter. Oyster Plant.—For this take: one-half dozen oyster plants, one-half tablespoonful of salt, three ounces of flour, one dessert spoonful of salad oil, one gill of tepid water, white of one egg. The oyster plants must be scraped and thrown into cold water in order to keep their color. Cut them when scraped, into convenient pieces and preparing a saucepan of boiling water into which throw the salt, put in the plants to boil until tender, the time for which depends upon the age of the plants. While the plants are boiling, place in a bowl the flour,

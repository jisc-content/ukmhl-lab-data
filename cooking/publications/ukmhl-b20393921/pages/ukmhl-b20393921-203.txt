MINCE PIE, To prepare the mince meat, which should stand at least one month before being used, skin first the suet and chop it very finely. Seed the raisins and chop these also very finely. Wash the currants well and drying them thor- oughly, chop these finely with the citron, which must first be cut in very thin slices. Place the chopped ingredients in a large bowl, mix them thoroughly together and add to this the sugar, the mixed spice, cinnamon and ginger, and stirring all well together, pour over the brandy, and stir all again until thoroughly saturated with the moisture. This mince should be packed for keeping, into a stone- jar and closely covered, When a pie is desired, take out of the jar six heaped tablespoonfuls of the mince, put it into a bowl and mix the cider and strawberry jam, also the beef which must be minced exceedingly fine. Chop the apple also very finely and stir this together with the mixture in the bowl; after which line a deep pie tin with puff paste—see page 182. pour the mince prepared as above into it, cover all with a thin sheet of the paste cut to the proper size, and pinching the covering firmly to the lining paste at the edges, cut two or three gashes in the top to let the steam escape while the pie is baking, brush all over with a little white of egg or milk and placing the tin in a quick oven bake the pie for three-quarters of an hour. Note—There is a Scottish proverb that mince meat becomes poison if minced too fine or kept too long," implying that it is im- possible to do either. Mince prepared as above may be kept six months or a year if desired. . . .

ME A TS, 52 a saucepan, the yolks of egg dropped into them, and stirred over the fire until the eggs are rendered dry by the action of heat. When the cutlets are ready take a fifth part of the potatoes so prepared, and flattened with a knife upon a mixing-board to the thickness of a quarter of an inch, and roll in this one of the cutlets, leaving the bone bare as a handle. Envelope each of the cutlets in its blanket of potato prepared in this way, and when this is done lay all of them upon a baking-tin, lightly greased, brush them over with a little milk or egg, and brown them in a very quick oven. While they are browning. Stir into the frying-pan the butter, place it over the fire, and add thereto the flour, when the cold water should be put in and all stirred until boiling. Put then with this the catsup, Worcestershire sauce and caramel, and allow the whole to cook for two minutes. Arrange the cutlets now in a circle upon a hot platter, fill into the centre a pint of boiled green peas, and pour the brown sauce around the whole through a strainer to keep out the vegetables that have been used to flavor it. Notes.â€”In preparing the potato envelope, a little flour should be sprinkled over the board to prevent sticking. If the oven should not, by any accident, be hot enough to brown the cutlets quickly, this may be done by holding over them a heated fire shovel, as leaving them long in the oven dries out the potatoes and so spoils the dish. The sauce is made in the frying-pan in preference to a fresh one in order that it may partake of both the flavor of the vegetables and of the juices of the meat, which adhere to the pan in the process of cooking. ... .^

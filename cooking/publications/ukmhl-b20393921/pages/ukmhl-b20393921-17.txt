3 KIDNEY SOUP. Note.—Maccaroni and Vermicelli Soup are made from this Clear Soup by simply boiling the maccaroni and vermicelli in water, put on cold, then putting them into the tureen and pouring the hot stock over. Kidney Soup.—Quantities and materials are to be used as follows : Two ox kidneys, two quarts of second stock, two tablespoonfuls of Harvey's Sauce, two tablespoonfuls mushroom catsup, one ounce of flour of rice, two ounces of butter, one grain of cayenne pepper and a little of black pepper and table salt. In preparing this soup the kidneys have first to be well washed in cold water, then after being thoroughly dried in a towel, they must be cut into thin slices. The butter is next to be put into a dry saucepan and heated until smoke begins to arise therefrom, the pieces of kid- ney added and browned therein; the flour of rice must then be put into a basin and be made smooth with a little of the stock, when the Harvey sauce is to be added, also the pepper, salt, cayenne and catsup, after which the rest of the stock is thrown into the basin, stirred until well mixed, and then the whole mixture poured over the kidney as prepared and placed in the saucepan. Now, putting the saucepan over the fire, stir the con- tents until boiling to prevent the flour lumping, and skim carefully meantime. After this boiling point is reached the saucepan must be drawn aside from the fire, tightly covered and allowed to simmer for two hours, when it is done. Note.—In browning meats of any kind the stock should be poured over them cold, that the brown which has been obtained may not be washed away in the process. Kidney especially should be cooked over a slow fire to prevent them hardening.

19 FRICASSEE OF OYSTER, Melt the butter now in a saucepan, add the flour and cream, which must be very sweet, as it is so apt to curdle, stir carefully until it boils, when the pepper^ salt and cayenne should be thrown in together with the meat from the terrapin. Cook this now for ten minutes, then draw it from the fire, and add the madeira and eggs, if the ter- rapin have furnished any. Serve immediately. Stewed Terrapin Superieure.-For this there will be required: two terrapin, one-half pound of butter, yolks of four hard-boiled eggs, two teaspoonfuls of flour, one and one-half gills of cream, two wineglassfuls of sherry, one saltspoonful of salt, and as much pepper. Boil and open the terrapin, as directed in Recipe No. 4. Put the butter into a bowl and beat it to a cream with the back of a wooden spoon. Add to this the yolks of the eggs, and beat both until thoroughly mixed, when the flour should be introduced by degrees, and the whole brought slowly to the boiling point. Take then the pieces of meat from the two terrapin, the pepper and salt, and put all with the butter, eggs, and flour previously prepared and boil the whole slowly for three quarters of an hour. Care should be taken to stir from time to time, to prevent burning, while thus boiling, and at the expiration of this time, add the cream, letting it all boil for fifteen minutes longer, when it should be drawn from the fire, the sherry added. Serve at once. OYSTERS AND OTHER SHELLFISH.—SECOND DIVISION. Fricassee of Oyster.—Procure for this:

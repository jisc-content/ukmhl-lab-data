BREAD AND CAKES. 194 Cut the dough in two pieces, and roll each piece out round, and to about half an inch in thickness. Divide each round into four pieces, place them on a heated gir- dle and bake them fifteen minutes, turning them once meantime. Serve cold with butter. Soda Scones.—One pound of flour, two ounces of butter, one ounce of sugar, one teaspoonful of carbonate of soda, one-half teaspoonful of cream of tartar, three gills of butter milk, one-half teaspoonful of salt. Put the flour into a bowl, mix through it the salt and then rub into it the butter. Put the soda and cream of tartar together upon a plate, and rub them free of lumps with the back of a spoon, after which mix them in with the flour and butter. Add to this mixture half of the sugar and all of the milk, and when these are stirred thoroughly in, pour the batter out upon a floured mixing board. Knead it with a little dry flour until stilf enough to roll out, when cut- ting the dough in two pieces, roll each of them to a round about half an inch in thickness, and marking each with a sharp knife from side to side at right angles, place them on a slightly floured baking tin, and bake in a moderate oven for twenty minutes. At the end of this time draw the tin from the oven long enough to brush the scones over with a little butter- milk, sprinkle them with the remaining sugar, and return them to the oven for one minute. Cool the scones upon a sieve or folded towel before serving. Note.—In using soda, care should be taken that the quantity given is not exceeded, and when a teaspoonful is required, the spoon should be just level full, otherwise the preparation will be turned very yellow.

IS8 PUDDINGS. and bake it for half an hour. At the end of this time take the pudding from the oven, beat the whites of the eggs to a light froth and pile this roughly upon the top of it. Sprinkle over all the remaining ounce of sugar, place the dish once more in the oven for five minutes, to firm the froth of egg and brown it also slightly. Serve at once. Note.—This pudding may also be made with preserved apples or pears as taste or convenience may dictate. Apple Dumplings.—Five apples, twelve ounces of flour, four ounces of butter, one ounce of sugar, one tea- spoonful of baking powder, one and one-half gills of cold water, one saltspoonful of salt. Rub this flour and butter together in a bowl, add to them the baking powder and the salt, and with the cold water mix all to a firm dough. Place this dough upon a mixing board, and cut it into five equal pieces. Pare the apples now very thinly, and take from them their cores, leaving the form of the apple unbroken. Roll the dough into balls, and taking an apple, work it into the centre of a ball of the dough; and just before closing the ball so formed at the top, put into the place of the apple cores, a portion of the sugar. When the apples are all prepared in this way with the dough and sugar, place them into a baking tin, and the baking tin into a quick oven for half an hour. At the end of half an hour test the dumplings with a skewer, and if the apples be not soft to the centre, they must remain in the oven until the skewer proves them entirely done.

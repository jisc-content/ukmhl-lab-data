GREEN CORN. lOS boiling, cold water must be poured in to keep the quan- tity the same, taking care to do this with sufficient fre- quency to prevent cooling the boiling liquor too much by the quantity of cold water added. Five minutes before the beans will be ready to dish up, melt in a small saucepan the butter, stir into it the flour, add by degrees the milk, and stir all until boiling. Let the mixture cook for two minutes, and season it with the salt. When the beans are done, drain the water from them in the quickest and most convenient way, so that they be rendered perfectly dry, place them in a deep vegetable dish, take the sauce from the fire, drop into it the yolk of egg, and pour all immediately over the beans. Take the shells from the hard-boiled eggs, cut them in two, and arrange them around the dish of beans with the rounded sides up. Sprinkle over each piece of egg a little of the chopped parsley, when the dish is ready for serving. Notes—It is contended that the dried Haricot beans cannot be properly cooked through, without breaking their skins, but if the above directions are strictly followed in the particularities of adding cold water, and boiling rapidly^ the result will be that the beans are not only thoroughly cooked to their centres, but have preserved their form unbroken. The dried white bean in ordinary use, may also be successfully boiled in this way. Green Corn.—Prepare : ten ears of corn, one table- spoonful of salt. Strip off the outer husks and turning the fine inner leaves carefully down, remove the silk from about the kernels, when the remaining husk must be again brought

O VER TON P UDDING. \ 5 i Grease with butter a deep pudding dish, pour into it the pudding, sprinkle over the top the grated nutmeg, and put all to bake in a moderate oven for half an hour. Overton Pudding.â€”Seven ounces of flour, three ounces of butter, one-half teaspoonful of baking powder, one-half gill of cold water, three tablespoonsfuls of pre- served strawberries, three ounces of dry cake crumbs, one gill of milk, one teaspoonful of essence of vanilla, three ounces of powdered sugar, one saltspoonful of salt. First rub the cake crumbs through a coarse wire sieve into a bowl. Bring the milk to the boiling point, and pour it over the crumbs, to which add also the essence of vanilla. Place upon a mixing board the flour, and into this rub the butter with the hands, sprinkle over this the salt, make a hole in the centre of the flour, pour into it the cold water, and kneading from the edges into this, mix all to a light paste,. Rub a little flour upon a rolling-pin, and with it roll out the paste to the thinness of a quarter of an inch, and cut from this ten lozenges about the size of a silver half dollar. Cut ten smaller lozenges of about half the circumfer- ence of the first, and, brushing a small platter over with cold water, roll the remaining crust out to the proper size, and line the platter therewith. Wet the edges of the lining paste with a little cold water, and arrange around them at equal distances, the largest lozenges. Upon these place the small lozenges, pressing them down in the cen- tre with the tip of the finger, spread over the centre sur- face of the crust-lined platter the preserved fruit, over this, spread the soaked cake crumbs, and sprinkle over all the sugar.

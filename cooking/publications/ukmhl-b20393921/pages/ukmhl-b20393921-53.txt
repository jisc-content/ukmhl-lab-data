When the heart is roasted, strain the liquor from the * deaf ears,' melt in the saucepan the butter, stir into it the flour, and add to this the strained liquor, also the catsup, pepper, and salt, and allow all to cook for two minutes, when the pepper should be removed from the heart, and placing it upon a hot platter, serve with the sauce poured around.

95 SPINACH WITH EGGS. substituted for each other as convenience may require, but the result will be more satisfactory from using each as directed. The recipes throughout this work have been kept as nearly as pos- sible to quantities for serving four persons, using such surplusage as must necessarily occur in the proper cooking of joints, in the cold meat preparations. The etiquette of entrees making one service to a person sufficient, the proportion of quantity has still been in a measure preserved, as these are generally served in odd numbers five, seven, nine, etc. VEGETABLES. Spinach with Eggs.â€”For this provide : four quarts of spinach, one tablespoonful of cream, one ounce of butter, four eggs, one teaspoonful of lemon-juice, one grain of cayenne, one dessert spoonful of salt, one salt- spoonful of pepper. The spinach must be thoroughly washed through three or four waters and the stalks picked off. Put it when washed into a dry saucepan, sprinkle over it the salt, and covering the saucepan closely place it over the fire. The salt and heat together will draw from the spinach enough of its own green liquor in which to boil, and when it reaches the boiling point allow it to boil for ten minutes. At the end of this time remove the spinach to a cul- lender that it may drain entirely of its liquor and when drained it must either be very finely chopped or passed through a coarse wire sieve. Into a small saucepan put the butter and cream and place all over the fire until the cream boils, then stir in the spinach and let the mixture get very hot but not boiling, as boiling will draw more liquor from the spinach and spoil the dish.

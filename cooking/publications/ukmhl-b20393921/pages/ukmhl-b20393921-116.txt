VEGETABLES. 102 Put the slices into a saucepan together with sufficient water to cover them, into which must be thrown the salt, and boil for about twenty minutes. Remove the squash to a cullender, drain off as much" of the water as possible and mash them up, using a fork to break up all the lumps. Place all in a vegetable dish, add the butter and pepper, and toss them about with a fork until the butter is melted, when it should be smoothed over the top with a knife-blade, and served immediately. Boiled Carrots with Brown Sauce.â€”For this prepare : one bunch of young carrots, one ounce of but- ter, one-half ounce of flour, one-half pint of brown stock, one dessert spoonful of catsup, one saltspoonful of salt, one saltspoonful of pepper. Wash the carrots in cold water and cut them squarely across at the tops. Throw them into boiling water and boil them for twenty minutes. Ten minutes before this time expires, take the carrot tops that have been cut off, dry them thoroughly, and melting the butter in a frying pan, put these in top pieces and brown them upon both sides. When these are browned stir in with them the flour, add by degrees the stock and stir all together until the stock boils. Season with the pepper and salt, flavor with the catsup and again let the sauce boil for two min- utes. When the carrots are boiled take them from the water and rolling them one by one in a towel, wring lightly to rub off the thin outer skin, stand them in regular order upright in a vegetable dish, and strain the sauce around them.

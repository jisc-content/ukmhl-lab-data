5 BROWN SOUP, Now taking a clean saucepan let the butter be melted and the remainder of the flour stirred into it, when the liquor should be added and the whole stirred until it boils. The pieces of meat from the cheek and tongue pre- viously prepared must now be thrown in, and all allowed to boil for ten minutes. The lemon's, thinly sliced, are to be placed in the tureen, together with the sherry and the balls and the catsup, over which the soup is to be poured, when it is ready for serving.

To this add the water in its given quantity and allow the whole to come quickly to the boiling point, skimming carefully

83 LARDED SWEET-BREADS. cream and chopped parsley, and moving the saucepan off the fire, stir this mixture in with the sweet-breads, and stir all together for two minutes, taking care that it does not boil. This should be served immediately and very hot, that the eggs may not get heavy. ILarded Sweet-breads.â€” One pair of sweet- breads, two ounces of fat bacon, one-half pint of stock, one-half teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, one lemon, four drops of caramel, one-half ounce of flour. The sweet-breads must be first thrown into boiling water, boiled for five minutes and then put into iced water for half an hour. Cut the bacon into thin strips two inches long and one- third of an inch in thickness, and when the sweet-breads have been taken from the water and dried thoroughly in a towel, thread the strips of bacon into a larding needle and lard the sweet-breads thickly, making a deep, long stitch as the flesh of the sweet-bread is so apt to break. When larded, place the sweet-bread into a stewing-pan and pour over it the stock, boiling hot. Cook them slowly for half an hour, when they must be put into a slightly greased baking tin, set into a hot oven, and baked for fifteen minutes. While the sweet-breads are cooking, stir into the stock in the saucepan half an ounce of the flour, add to it the caramel, aud let all cook for two minutes, when it should be seasoned with the pepper and salt. When the sweet-breads have baked the fifteen minutes, take them from the oven and putting them upon a small, hot platter, pour around them the sauce from the pan and garnish with the lemon, sliced.

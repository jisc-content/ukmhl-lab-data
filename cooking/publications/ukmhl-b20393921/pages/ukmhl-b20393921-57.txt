BOILED BEEFSTEAK PUDDING, Remove now the fowl from the saucepan, take the papers off from the breasts, and cut out the strings, and place them upon a large hot platter, pouring over the breast of each the sauce, to which must be added at the last moment the whites of eggs, in order that they may not discolor with standing.

Now chop the suet finely, and put it upon a mixing board, together with the flour, add to this the baking powder and the remaining salt, and knead all into a light dough with the cold water.

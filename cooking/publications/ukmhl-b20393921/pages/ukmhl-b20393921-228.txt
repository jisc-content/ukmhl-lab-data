BREAKFAST DISHES, 214 Chickens Livers.—One and one-half dozens of chickens livers, one-quarter of a pound of fat bacon, one saltspoonful of pepper, one saltspoonful of salt. Place the livers into a saucepan, cover them with cold water, throw in the salt and bringing the water quickly to the boiling point, let the livers boil for five minutes. When done, remove the livers from the water, slice them lengthwise carefully, in order not to break them, and cutting the bacon into very thin slices, and of a size similar to the slices of liver, thread alternate slices of liver and bacon upon a spit, and broil all over a bright fire five minutes, turning them constantly in order that they may brown evenly. When broiled sprinkle over all the -pepper and send them to the table on the spit. Note.—Livers of chicken or turkey boiled in the manner above described, may also be served with a hot, thick brown sauce poured over them, with the addition if desired of a little chopped onion, browned in butter. Pig's Feet.—Four pigs feet, one and one-half pints of milk, one teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, one ounce of flour. When the feet are cleaned and scraped, cut them each across the knuckle deep enough, to let the water pene- trate to the joint. Place them in a large saucepan, cover them with cold water, and putting all over the fire, let the water boil up. When this occurs drain the first water olf. Cover the feet with boiling water, and allow them to boil in this very slowly until the meat becomes tender. Pour the water off again, cover the feet with the milk.

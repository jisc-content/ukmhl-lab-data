141 CHESTNUT SOUFFLE, If the tin cups are used, a napkin may be folded in basket shape upon the plate, and the tins be placed in it. Chicken Souffle.—The breast of one raw chicken, one gill of cream, one egg, one-half ounce of butter, one- half ounce of flour, one saltspoonful of white pepper, one saltspoonful of salt, two truffles. Take the skin from the breast of chicken, chop it finely and pound it when chopped, in a mortar. Melt the butter in a small saucepan, stir into it the flour, and one tablespoonful of the cream. Let this boil, and when boiling take the saucepan from the fire and pour its contents over the chicken in the mortar, adding also one egg. Pound all well together and season with the pepper and salt. When pounded pass the mixture through a sieve, and putting the remainder of the cream into a small bowl, beat it with a fork until it comes to a stiff froth; mix this very lightly with the strained mixture, grease a few cup tins, and cutting the truffles into stars, place one of these in the bottom of each tin. Fill the tins about half full with the mixture, and place them into a sautie can half filled with boiling water, cover them with a round of greased paper and let them steam slowly for fifteen minutes. When done turn the souffles out upon a hot platter, having the truffle stars uppermost, and serve at once. Note.—Any shallow pan will answer if a saute pan is not availa- able, but care must be taken that the boiling water does not reach more than half way up the sides of the cup tins. Chestnut Souffle.—One pint of fresh chestnuts, one and one-half gills of milk, yolks of three egg, whites

ICES, CREAMS AND JELLIES. 176 dipping them into cold water arrange them in any fanciful form in the bottom of the tin ; when the cream has commenced to firm a little in the bowl, pour it into the mould very carefully, in order that the wall of lady- fingers may not become disarranged, and set the whole away to harden. When the charlotte russe has firmed sufficiently to be turned out of the mould, transfer it to a dessert dish, using care not to break its shape or to disarrange the cherries which garnish the top. Notes.—Charlotte russe may also be made by baking a sponge cake in very thin sheets as for rolled jelly-cake, and cutting this into lengths about four inches wide and ten long, form these into small cups, sticking them together by brushing a little white of egg between the over-lapping ends. Arrange the cake cups upon a platter, placing a round of orna- mental paper under each, fill them two-thirds full with the cream prepared as above, and when this hardens, whip sufficient white of egg to a stiff froth, and fill up the cups, placing upon the top of each a small lozenge cut for the purpose from the sponge cake. When filled they should be covered over with a sheet of paper and placed in the oven for a moment to " set" the white of egg froth, when they are ready to serve. The lozenges upon the top of each may be garnished with a raisin or candied cherry if desired. Rice Cream.—Two large tablespoonfuls of finely cracked rice, one pint of milk, one ounce of butter, two ounces ofcut loaf sugar, rind of one lemon, one-half ounce of gelatine, one-half pint of double cream. Prepare the gelatine by soaking it in the milk for one hour. Put into a fresh, bright saucepan the butter, stir into it the rice, which must be as fine but not finer than granulated sugar, add to this by degrees the milk and gelatine and rubbing the lumps of sugar upon the rind

TIBBIE SHIELS OR GIRDLE SCONES. 193 Put the flour into a bowl, mix with it the salt, make a little hole in the centre of the flour, and separating the whites from the yolks of the eggs, drop the yolks into this hole, and place the whites upon a plate. Melt the butter, taking care that it does not become hot, and pour this over the yolks of eggs, when the milk also must be poured in, and as it is poured the dry flour must be worked in from the sides. When all the flour is mixed in, the mixture should be beaten until bubbles arise upon its surface. Whip the whites of eggs to a stiff froth, and stir this lightly into the batter. Slightly grease and heat twelve muffin rings, place them into a baking pan and pour into them equal parts of the batter, when they must be put into a very quick oven and baked for ten minutes. Serve hot. Note.—A very delicious muffin may also be made after this recipe, of equal parts of corn meal and wheat flour. Tibbie Shiel's or Girdle Scones.—One pound of flour, one teaspoonful of bi-carbonate of soda, one-half teaspoonful of cream of tartar, one-half teaspoonful of salt, three gills of butter milk. Put the flour into a bowl and mix through it the salt, place the soda and cream of tartar upon a plate, and make all smooth with the back of a teaspoon. Mix this also with the flour, pour in the butter milk and stir all thor- oughly together. Flour a mixing board, pour the batter out upon this, and adding a little flour from time to time to prevent sticking, knead the batter until it becomes a dough, stiff enough to roll out.

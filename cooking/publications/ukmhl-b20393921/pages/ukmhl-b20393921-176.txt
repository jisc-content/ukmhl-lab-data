PUDDINGS, cakes are sugared, sprinkled with the lemon juice, rolled and placed beside the first, when they may be arranged in the fashion of a cob-house, or as the fancy may direct upon the hot platter, and should be served at once. Note.—This batter may also be fried in smaller sized cakes, and served,well buttered and very hot, as a breakfast dish. Rice Pudding.—One and one-half pints of milk, one-half a pound of rice, two ounces of sugar, one-half teaspoonful of salt, one egg, one ounce of butter. Grease a deep pudding dish thoroughly inside with the butter and pour into this the milk into which stir the dry rice. Cover the dish with a plate, to confine the steam and prevent premature browning on the top should the oven be very hot, and placing all in a moderate oven let the pudding bake slowly for an hour and a half by which time the kernels of rice will have soaked, and swelling absorbed nearly all of the milk, leaving the grains beau- tifully whole and the pudding devoid of the glutinous paste which by stirring processes is developed from the starch-flour of the broken rice. Ten minutes before re- moving the pudding from the oven beat the egg until very light, add to it the sugar and salt, and taking the plate off, of the pudding dish stir this mixture into the pudding, and allow to bake for the remaining ten minutes uncovered that it may brown on the surface. Serve with hard sauce directions for making which may be found on page i68. Note.—This pudding may be further enriched by the addition of a quarter of a pound of raisins or if desired more plain than as above, the egg may be omitted and the sugar alone stirred in when the pud- ding is uncovered to permit its browning.

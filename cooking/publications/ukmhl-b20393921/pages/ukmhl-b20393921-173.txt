SWISS RISSOLES. When done, take them from the oven, brush each over with a little milk, sprinkle them with a little sugar, and return all to the oven for one minute, and serve them with a hard sauce, directions for making which, will be found on page 168. Swiss Rissoles.—One-half pound of pears, one- quarter pound of raisins, two ounces of sugar, eight ounces of flour, four ounces of butter, one egg, one-half gill of cold water, one-half of a lemon. First pare and core the pears, cut them into small pieces, squeeze into a saucepan the juice of the lemon, add to it half of the cold water and an ounce and a half of the sugar, and placing the saucepan over the fire, let its contents come to the boiling point ; when boiling, throw into it the pears, also the raisins, and let them cook therein very slowly for half an hour. When done, turn the mixture out upon a plate. When quite cool make up a crust by mixing upon a board the flour and butter, make a hole in the centre of this into which drop the yolk of egg, pour over the remaining cold water, and knead all lightly together. Roll this out to about an inch in thickness, and cut it into pieces about four inches square. Beat the white of the egg lightly, and brush the edges of the crust with it j put into each of these squares an equal quantity of the cold mixture from the plate, fold the edges together, brush over each a little of the white of egg, sprinkle over each a little of the sugar, and placing the rissoles upon a slightly floured baking tin, bake them in a moderate oven for half an hour. Serve in a folded napkin. Peach-Sago.—One quart of peaches, one-half pound of sago, three ounces of sugar, one pint of cold water.

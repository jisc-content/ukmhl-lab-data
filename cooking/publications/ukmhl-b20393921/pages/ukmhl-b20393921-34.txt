20 SHELLFISH. Twenty-five oysters, two ounces of butter, one ounce of flour, yolks of two eggs, one teaspoonful of lemon juice, one grain of cayenne, one grain of grated nutmeg, a lump of salt the size of a pea, one-half a saltspoonf ul of pepper.

The oysters should now be removed to a plate and left standing for

17 CLAM CHO WDER, mace, one grain of cayenne, one teaspoonful of salt, and half as much pepper. Drain first the liquor from the oysters, and putting the liquor over the fire, bring it to the boiling point. In a separate saucepan melt the butter, stir into it the flour and pour in the stock. Add also the mace, pepper, cayenne and salt, and let all boil for ten minutes, when the oysters should be added. Watch the oysters closely, and when the leaves begin to shrivel, pour the soup into the tureen and add thereto the cream, which must have been made boiling hot. Note.—The great difficulty to be surmounted in making this soup, is bringing the cream and liquor together without curdling, which is obviated by boiling each separately. Clam Chowder.—For this is required; fifty hard clams, twenty-five soft clams, three Bermuda onions, one fourth pound of pork, six potatoes, four pilot biscuits, one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, one dessert spoonful of chopped thyme, one fourth of a quart can of tomatoes, one dessert spoonful of salt, one dessert spoonful of pepper, one-half wineglassful of Worcestershire sauce, two ounces of butter. Begin by melting the butter in a frying pan, and put into the same when hot, the pork and the onion cut into very small pieces, and fry to a light brown. Put this pre- paration into a saucepan with the potatoes boiled and mashed, and add the pilot biscuits which must have been previously soaked in cold water. The chopped parsley, thyme and tomatoes should then be put in, also the clams, Worcestershire sauce, pepper and salt, and the whole now cooked for thirty minutes slowly.

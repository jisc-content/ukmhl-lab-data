ME A TS. ss a very pale brown the sliced onion. Stir into this the curry-powder and flour, and when all is thoroughly mixed, add to the mixture by degrees the stock. Stir now carefully until boiling and when this point is reached, grate the apple, and add it also. Put on then the lid of the saucepan and allow all to simmer slowly for ten minutes, in the meantime cut the mutton into slices, drop it slice by slice into this boiling sauce, and allow it to cook just long enough to heat the meat through when the saucepan must at once be removed from the fire, and the preparation served. Note.—The great fault in preparing cold meats for a second serv- ing, lies in losing sight of the fact that the meat is already cooked to a turn, and allowing it to remain too long exposed to the drying and toughening action of heat in the second preparation. Cold boiled mutton with tomato sauce.— Three-quarters of a pound of cold mutton, one pint of cold stewed tomatoes, two ounces of butter, one-half ounce of flour, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, one-half teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of sugar, one grain of cayenne, one gill of second stock. First cut the mutton into slices, place them neatly into the bottom of a flat vegetable dish, and season each piece lightly with the salt, pepper and cayenne. Melt then the butter and make it hot, when half should be poured over the meat and into what remains stir the flour, adding to it when smooth, the stock. When this mixture boils add to it the sugar, the remainder of the seasoning and the tomatoes, and let all cook for two minutes that the tomatoes may become very hot, when the sauce should be poured over the mutton and the whole covered tightly until taken to the table.

208 BREAKFAST DISHES, Stir all, until the omelette begins to set at the edges, draw all down to one side of the pan, and when it becomes firm on the under side, turn the omelette quickly over to the other side of the pan, without breaking its form, and remove the omelette to a hot platter. Repeat this process for the second omelette, the cook- ing of which should only consume about two minutes and serve both as quickly as possible. Dried Herb Omelettes.—One dessert spoonful of chopped parsley, two teaspoonfuls of dried mixed herbs, a piece of eschalot the size of a bean, eight eggs, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, one teaspoonful of salt, two ounces of butter. Put the eggs into a bowl, and with them the chopped parsley, dried herbs, pepper and salt. Chop the eschalot finely and throw it in also. Beat all together until the eggs are thoroughly blended, the yolks with the whites. Melt in an omelette pan, one ounce of the butter and when the blue smoke arises pour into it half of the mixture from the bowl, and stir this until the omelette begins to firm at the edges. Draw all down to one side of the pan, and when the omelette becomes firm on the under side, turn it over to the other side of the pan, and transfer it from this at once to a hot platter. Repeat this process of cooking with the remaining omelette mixture, and with as much dispatch as is possible, place the second omelette beside the first, and serve im- mediately. Note.—Omelettes should always be cooked over a very quick fire, and should never consume more than two minutes in the doing.

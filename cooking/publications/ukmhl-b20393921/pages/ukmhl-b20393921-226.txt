Stuffed Potatoes.—Eight large potatoes, one pound of beefsteak^ one dessert spoonful of mushroom catsup, one teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, one grain of cayenne, two ounces of butter, one egg.

Take the potatoes from the water, and drying them thoroughly with a towel, pack the meat mixture firmly into them. Beat the egg until very light, and roll in this both the stuffed potato and the tops, and cover the meat stuffing with the top cut from each potato, pressed firmly on.

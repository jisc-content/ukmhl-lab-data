PIES AND PASTRIES. Pare the pumpkin of its yellow rind, remove the seeds, slice and cut the pumpkin into small pieces, and placing these in a saucepan, cover them with cold water, and put- ting the saucepan over the fire, stew the contents until quite soft and nearly dry, when the pumpkin should be passed through a cullender and made quite smooth. Take one pint of the stewed pumpkin, stir into it the milk and sugar, beat the eggs until very light, and add these also, after which line a deep pie tin with the pie crust, pour into this enough of the pumpkin mixture to fill it within a quarter of an inch of the top, and place the tin in a quick oven and bake for twenty minutes. When done, the spice should be grated over the top and the pie then be returned for a moment to the hottest part of the oven to brown a little on the sur- face. There will be sufficient of the pumpkin mixture to fill two pie tins, which may be used at once if required, or set aside until the following day, as pumpkin pies require to be eaten when quite fresh, or the crust becomes soaked and indigestible. Note.—Squash pie may be prepared in the same way as the pump- kin pies. IVEince Pie.—Fourteen pounds of brown sugar, eight pounds of suet, eight pounds of raisins, eight pounds of currants, one-quarter pound of mixed spice, two pounds of citron, one-half gallon of brandy, one tablespoonful of powdered ginger, one tablespoonful of powdered cinna- mon, three ounces of apple, one-half gill of cider, two ounces of lean boiled beef, two heaped tablespoonfuls of strawberry jam.

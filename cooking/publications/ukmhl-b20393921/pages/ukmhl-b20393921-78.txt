Arrange the potato mixture then in a circle upon a hot platter leaving a round hole in the centre, smooth it with a knife, and place in the centre the minced chicken and serve. Note.—If it is desired the potato wall may be browned before the chicken is put in, but if this is done at all it must be done in a very hot oven, otherwise the potato will dry out and become tough and heavy. Cold meat shape.—One pound of cold meat, two ounces of maccaroni, one teacupful of bread crumbs, one ounce of butter, one egg, one tablespoonful of stock, one teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper. Chop the cold meat very finely, put it into a basin, when done and season with the pepper and salt. Wash the maccaroni well in cold water and boil it for half an hour. Drain it then thoroughly and cut into inch lengths, when it must be mixed together with the chopped meat and bread crumbs, and separating the butter into small pieces mix that in also. Bind all now together with the egg and the stock, and when thoroughly mixed together, pack the mixture into a well greased basin or bowl and steam the contents for one hour. Notes.—The maccaroni must be put on the fire in cold water and boiled rapidly. By steaming it is meant that the bowl or basin, covered with a piece of kitchen paper, should be placed in a saucepan within which is sufficient water to reach half way up its sides and allowed thus to cook in its own steam. Any kind of cold meat except pork can be used for this preparation.

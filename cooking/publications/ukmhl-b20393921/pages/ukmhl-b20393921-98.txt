ENTREMETS. Vol-au-Vent of Sweet-breads.â€”Six ounces of flour, six ounces of butter, yolk of one egg, one teaspoon- ful of lemon-juice, one-half gill of cold water, one gill of milk, one-half teaspoonful of salt, one-half saltspoonful of pepper, one grain of cayenne, one pair of sweet-breads. First put the flour upon a mixing board, make a little well in the centre thereof, and drop into it the egg and half of the lemon-juice, adding by degrees the cold water, kneading all meantime firmly together and when kneaded, roll out thinly. Into the centre of the rolled paste put five ounces of the butter, fold the edges together until the butter is covered, and, flouring a rolling-pin, roll out as thinly as possible. Fold the crust now into three layers and roll out again and repeat this process of folding and rolling seven times, when it should be put into the ice-box and left long enough to become chilled through and firm. Take the sweet-breads, first thoroughly washing them, and putting them into a saucepan, cover with cold water and bringing the water to the boiling point, allow them to boil in it for five minutes, when they should be again thrown into cold water, rewashed, and cut into small pieces. Now put the butter and milk into a saucepan over the fire and when the milk boils, put into the pan also the pieces of sweet-bread, season them with the cayenne pep- per and salt, and let all simmer slowly for three-quarters of an hour. When the crust has become cool and firm in the ice- box, take it out and placing it upon the mixing board roll it out to about a third of an inch in thickness. Cut out two vol-au-vent with the vol-au-vent cutter, or a biscuit

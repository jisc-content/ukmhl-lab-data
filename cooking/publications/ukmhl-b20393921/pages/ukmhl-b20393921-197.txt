The paste may now be used for vol-au-vent, or what-' ever purpose required. Note.—If a larger quantity of this paste is required, it should be made in divisions, as a larger amount than is given above is not so successfully manipulated. When flour is in the least inferior, the quantity of matter must be decreased, as there will not be sufficient gluten in it to absorb the quantity of moisture. Flaky Crust.—One pound of flour, one-half pound of butter, one teaspoonful of baking powder, one salt- spoonful of salt, one-half gill of cold water, whites of two eggs. Sift the flour through a sieve upon a mixing board. Put the whites of eggs upon a plate, add to them the salt and whip all to a light froth. Mix the flour to a firm dough with the froth of eggs and the cold water, roll it out very thinly, divide the butter into three pieces and spread one of them upon the dough. Fold the dough in three layers and roll it out thinly again, reversing the ord^r of rolling each time. Repeat this process until the butter is all rolled into the dough when the crust is ready for use and may be used for meat pies, or fruit tarts. Short Crust.—Six ounces of flour, four ounces of butter, one-half gill of cold water, one-half teaspoonful of lemon-juice, yolk of one egg. Place the flour when sifted upon a mixing board, add to it the butter and rub these gently together with the finger tips until all look like bread crumbs.

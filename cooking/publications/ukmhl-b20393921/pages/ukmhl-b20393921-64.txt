MEATS, cover them with cold water and let them boil for five minutes, when they should be poured out and strained, and the saucepan thoroughly cleansed. Melt then in the saucepan the butter, add to it the flour, and by degrees, the strained stock, and when this boils, add the mace, the flour, and the mushrooms and allow all to cook together for twenty minutes longer. Remove now the mace and at the last moment add the cream. Serve on a large hot platter. Note.—If the canned mushrooms are used they will be found already prepared, but if the fresh ones are preferred or are found more convenient they must be skinned before using. Rolled shoulder of Mutton.—One shoulder of mutton, three ounces of butter, one teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of pepper, three tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, one and one-half ounces of chopped suet, one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, one egg, one gill of cold water. It is desirable that the mutton should be boned by the butcher, but should this oflice fall to the cook it is easiest done by placing the mutton with the skin side to the table, and with a sharp knife, making an incision that will enable the bone to be firmly taken hold of. Proceed then very carefully to separate the bone from the flesh, exercising caution not to break the outer skin. When this is accomplished prepare the dressing. Begin this by mixing in a bowl the pepper, salt, bread crumbs and suet. Add to this the chopped parsley and bind all together with the egg. Place this dressing into the shoulder where the bone has been removed and roll the meat into a neat roll, tying it loosely around with twine

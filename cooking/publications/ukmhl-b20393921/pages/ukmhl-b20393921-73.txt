59 CORNISH PASTIES. Notes.—It should be remembered that all highly seasoned dishes, particularly those in which pepper predominates, should be served very hot. When cold tomatoes are not in the larder, either fresh or canned ones may be prepared for the above use. Corned-beef Hash.—One pound of chopped corned-beef, three-quarters of a pound of boiled potatoes, two ounces of butter, one gill of stock, one teaspoonful of pepper, one-half teaspoonful of salt, one Spanish onion. Before chopping the meat, trim away and remove all the skin and grizzle, that all substances likely to present hard lumps may be taken out. Chop then the potatoes, taking care that they do not become too fine or a mashed paste, and mix them together with the meat in the chopping bowl. Chop the onion then finely and brown it, to a pale brown in the butter. When brown, add to it the stock, and, when this is hot, the chopped corned-beef and pota- toes, season all with the pepper and salt, and stir over the fire until very hot. Serve this hash banked up in a hot vegetable dish with a piece of butter let into a hole made by the print of a spoon bowl in the top. Notes.—Cold roast beef may also be used in this way, and pieces of cold beef steak as well, and a delicious, juicy hash can be made after this method for those who enjoy rare meats by substituting raw steak, minced for the cold cooked meats. Potatoes are best for this use that are a little underdone as when hard they mince without mashing and so retain their character. Cornish Pasties,—Three-quarters of a pound of cold beefsteak, one-half pound of raw potatoes, one Span- ish onion, one teaspoonful of pepper, one teaspoonful of salt, one pound of flour, four ounces of beef suet, one tea- spoonful of baking-powder, one-half pint of cold water.

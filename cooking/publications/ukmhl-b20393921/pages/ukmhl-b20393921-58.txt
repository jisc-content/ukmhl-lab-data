Put now loosely into this crust-lined bowl^ the steak and kidney, and having poured over the top the catsup, and Worcestershire sauce, fill it to within an inch of the top, with cold water. The remainder of the crust should then be rolled out to the exact size of the bowl, and put over the meat, pinched firmly together with the lining crust around the edge. Dip a towel in hot water, flour it slightly, and tie it tightly over the top of the bowl to prevent any of the juices escaping, and putting all into a large saucepan of boiling water, allow it to boil for two hours and a half. If served in the bowl, a napkin may be arranged to cover the ware and the whole be carried to table on a round china or silver plate; If it is to be transferred to another dish for serving, one should be selected for the purpose into the bottom of which the round of the upper crust will fit nicely, and care be exercised not to break the paste in turning it out.

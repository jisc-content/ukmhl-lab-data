2 SOUPS, slowly for five hours, at the end of which time the stock should be strained through a clean towel to remove the meat and vegetables, the juices and flavor of which have been extracted, and put away to cool for future use. !NOTE.—Water boils at a temperature of 212 deg., and to boil meat in it for eating or to prepare stock, the water having been first brought to the boiling point should be permitted to fall to a tempera- ture of 160 deg. to prevent the meat hardening. A second stock can be made from the meat and bones used for the first, by covering them again with cold water, adding some fresh vegetables, and bringing all to the boiling point; allowing the pre- paration to simmer slowly thereafter for four hours. Clear Soup.—Material and quantities required : One quart of brown stock, the whites and shells of two eggs and as much salt and pepper as can be held between the thumb and finger. The stock must have been allowed to become quite cold, when it will have thickened, and set. Then, dipping the corner of a towel in boiling water, wash the grease from the top. Now put the stock into a saucepan and allow it to melt—a copper saucepan is preferable. Put the whites and shells of the two eggs into a small bowl, add to them one-half a gill of cold water and the salt and pepper. When the stock has melted add the eggs so prepared, and with two forks whisk the whole briskly until it boils. The instant the soup boils cover the saucepan closely and draw it aside from the fire, and allow it to simmer for ten minute^\ Then strain through a clean towel, taking care not to break the crust which the eggs have formed at the top in process of clearing, and it is ready to serve.

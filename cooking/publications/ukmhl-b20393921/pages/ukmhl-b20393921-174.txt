i6o PUDDINGS. Put the sago into a pudding dish, cover it with the cold water and allow it to soak therein for two hours. And when the sago is sufficiently soaked, skin and stone the peaches, place them regularly upright in the sago, sprinkle over all the sugar, and placing the pudding dish into a moderate oven, let the pudding bake for one hour. Serve hot. Corn Starch Pudding,—Four tablespoonsfuls of corn starch, one quart of milk, two ounces of sugar, one saltspoonful of salt, two bay leaves, two eggs.

Stir all constantly until boiling, and when boiling allow this to continue for five minutes, still stirring to pre- vent scorching, which the corn starch and milk are both apt to do. Draw the saucepan then aside from the fire to let its contents cool a little, and in the time allowed for this beat together the eggs and sugar.

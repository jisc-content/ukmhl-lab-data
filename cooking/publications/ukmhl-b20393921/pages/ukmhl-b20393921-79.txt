BROILED KIDNE YS. 65 Savory Hash.—Three quarters of a pound of cold meat, one Spanish onion, one ounce of butter, one ounce of flour, one teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, one dessert spoonful of catsup, one dessert spoon- ful of Harvey's sauce, one-half pint of second stock, one carrot, one turnip. Clean and chop fine both the carrot and turnip, when they must be put to boil in a small saucepan with boiling water until tender, which will take about twenty minutes. While these are cooking, melt the butter in a separate saucepan, brown in it the onion, sliced, then cutting into slices the cold meat roll them in the flour, and placing these slices in the butter with the onion brown them slightly also. Pour over this now the stock, the Harvey's sauce and catsup, stir all together gently until the stock boils and season with the pepper and the salt. When the pieces of meat have become thoroughly heated through, arrange them in a flat dish and pour the gravy over. Strain the water carefully from the turnip and carrot, lest by after draining it impoverish the gravy, and pile them high upon the top of the pieces of meat when it is ready for serving. Notes.—Cold roast beef or cold beef steak is best for this dish, but any other cold meat may be used.

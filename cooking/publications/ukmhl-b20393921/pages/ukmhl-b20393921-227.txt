Melt the butter in a small saucepan, stir into this the flour, add the milk and stir all together until boiling. Throw into this mixture the shredded salmon and season all with half of the pepper and salt. Cover the saucepan and, drawing it to one side of the fire, let its contents simmer, but not boil, until the fish is heated through. The slices of bread should be cut at least an inch and a half thick and cut a large round from each with a bis- cuit cutter. Wi^h a smaller cutter cut these rounds half way through in the centre. Put the cream upon a plate and dip the rounds in this, quickly in order that they may not soak soft, beat the egg thoroughly and roll the rounds in this, after which season the bread crumbs with the remaining pepper and salt and roll the rounds in these also. Throw the prepared rounds into hot clarified fat or lard and fry them for three minutes. Take them from the fat, drain them upon kitchen paper and splitting carefully off with a sharp knife the inner round to the depths at which it is cut, scrape out from the centre of the large round all of the bread remaining soft. Into this bread cup fill in equal portions the fish mix- ture, and place over this the small rounds of bread. Serve the patties garnished with sprigs of parsley. Note.â€”These patties may also be made with oysters, lobsters, truffles, mushrooms or any kind of boiled fish.

2IO BREAKFAST DISHES. them gently from this into the water, letting each egg form before another is put in. Allow two minutes and a half to each egg, and remov- ing them from the water with a skimmer, place them, so drained, upon the slices of buttered toast. Curried Eggs.—Eight eggs, three ounces of butter, one and one-half ounces of flour, three gills of white stock, one tablespoonful of curry powder, one-half tea- spoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of sugar, one tea- spoonful of vinegar. Drop the eggs into a saucepan of boiling water, and let them boil therein for ten minutes. Throw them when boiled into a basin of cold water to cool, and while they are cooling melt the butter in a small saucepan, stir into it the dry flour and curry powder, add the stock by degrees, and when this mixture reaches the boiling point, let it continue to boil for two min- utes thereafter. Throw in the salt, sugar and vinegar, and draw the saucepan aside from the fire. Take the shells from the eggs and cut them into halves, put them into the saucepan with the prepared curry, and allow all to remain over the fire until the eggs are heated through, taking care however, that the mixture does not boil, as this will cause the eggs to break up and so injure the appearance of the dish. When done pour all carefully into a hot deep dish, and serve with boiled rice. Mushrooms.—One and one-half dozens of large, fresh mushrooms, four tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, one eschalot, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, one-half teaspoonful of salt, two ounces of butter.

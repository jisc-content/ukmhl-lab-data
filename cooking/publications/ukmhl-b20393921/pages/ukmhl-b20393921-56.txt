42 ME A TS, carefully, forming a straight line across the fowl; then turning back, put the needle through the upper part of the wing, through the skin of the neck and the upper part of the remaining wing, drawing the thread again after/ and tying the two ends of the twine, which now approach each other, into a secure knot. Thread the trussing needle now anew, and putting it through the fowl at the tail, just over the back bone, pass it over one leg, through the skin at the base of the breast, and over the other leg, bringing the ends of the twine again together, where they must be tied very tightly. When both fowls have been trussed, grease two sheets of kitchen paper and tie one over the breast of each fowl. Have then in readiness a large saucepan of boiling water, plunge the fowl therein and allow the water to boil up. When boiling cover the saucepan closely and drawing it aside from the blaze of the fire, allow the fowls to simmer slowly, from an hour to an hour and a quarter, until the chickens are tender. While this is being accomplished put two eggs into boiling water, let them boil for ten minutes, then taking them from the fire, throw them at once into a bowl of cold water, that they may cool quickly, and the coating of the yolks preserve their coloring. When the eggs are quite cold, remove the shells and chop the whites into irregular pieces, preparatory to making the sauce. Five minutes before the fowls are to be removed from the boiling, put into a small saucepan the butter, and melting it, stir therein the flour, adding by degrees the milk, stirring meantime until all boils, when the cream must be thrown in, also the pepper and salt, allowing the whole to cook together for two minutes.

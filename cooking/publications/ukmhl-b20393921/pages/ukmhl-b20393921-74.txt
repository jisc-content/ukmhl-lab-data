MEA TS, 6o Cover the potatoes, in a saucepan, with cold water and bring the water to the boiling point, and when this is • reached take out the potatoes and cut them into small, square pieces. Put the pieces upon a plate and shred over them the onion, add to these the steak, which must also be cut into small square pieces, and sprinkle over all, the pepper and nearly all of the salt. Toss these all now together with a fork, then place the suet upon a board and chop it very finely, mix well with it the flour, baking-powder and the remainder of the salt, and r»ake these into a light dough with the cold water. Cut the dough then into six or eight pieces, roll each piece out round and to a quarter of an inch thickness, brush the edges of the rounds with a little cold water, and put into each an equal part of the meat mixture. Gather up the edges of the crust and pinch them firmly together, brush each over with a little egg or milk, and bake them in a quick oven three-quarters of an hour. Shepherd's Pie.—One pound of cold roast beef, one Spanish onion, one and one-half, ounces of butter, one- half ounce of flour, one pound of mashed potatoes, one tablespoonful of catsup, one-half gill of cold water, one teaspoonful of pepper, one teaspoonful of salt. Mince the meat very finely, and melt then in a sauce- pan half an ounce of the butter, throw into it the minced meat and brown it well, keeping the meat moving all of the time to prevent its lumping. While this is doing sprinkle the flour in by degrees both to help the browning and to thicken the composition. Add then the pepper, salt and water, and stir all until boiling when the onion must be sliced and put in. Draw the saucepan now to one side of the fire, in order that it may keep hot without

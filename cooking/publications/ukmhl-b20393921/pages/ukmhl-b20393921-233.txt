BREAKFAST COFFEE, 219 ley, one teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pep- per, one saltspoonful of powdered mace, four tablespoon- fuls of bread crumbs. Throw the brains into a strong mixture of salt and water and let them remain in this for an hour. Put them into a saucepan over the fire, cover them with cold water and allow them to boil therein for twenty- minutes. At the end of this time take them from the water, chop them into rough pieces, place these in a bowl and rub into them the butter. Add to the brains two table- spoonfuls of the bread crumbs and season all with the pepper, salt and mace. When these are mixed sprinkle over the preparation the chopped parsley and drop in upon it, the yolks of the eggs. Beat all well together, and flouring the hands slightly to prevent sticking, form the mixture into small, flat, round cakes. Whip the whites of the eggs, dip the cakes into this, roll them in the remainder of the bread crumbs, throw them into hot clarified fat or lard for two minutes, when done drain them for a moment upon a piece of kitchen paper, and serve them in a folded napkin garnished with sprigs of parsley.

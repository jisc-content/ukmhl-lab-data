138 SOUFFLES, drop in also one by one the yolks of eggs, stirring all thoroughly together. Whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and stir this in also, taking care not to break the froth. Pour the mixture now into the souffle tin, which it should about two-thirds fill, place the tin into a deep saucepan containing sufficient water to reach half way up the sides of the mould, and covering the saucepan closely, draw it aside from the fire and let the water there- in simmer slowly for thirty minutes, keeping it always covered. Five minutes before this time expires, rub through a horsehair sieve the jam, add to it the sherry and lemon juice, also the cochineal, put all into a small saucepan ; place over the fire, and stir until the mixture boils. Draw it then from the fire. Remove also the souffl6 from the saucepan, cut the paper from it and turn the souffle out upon a hot, flat dish. Pour the sauce around it, and serve immediately. Note.—The lemon souffle may also if desired be served upon a hot platter, with the above sauce poured around it. Chocolate Souf&es.—Three ounces of grated chocolate, one ounce of sugar, one ounce of butter, one ounce of flour, one gill of milk, yolks of three eggs, whites of four eggs. Grease and bind around a pint and a half souffle tin, a band of paper to form a wall above the tin, and confine the souffle as it rises. Grease also the interior of the tin. Melt the butter in a small saucepan, stir into it the flour, and adding the milk stir all until boiling.

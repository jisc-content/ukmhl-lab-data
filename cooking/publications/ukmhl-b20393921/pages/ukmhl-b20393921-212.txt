198 BREAD AND CAKES, pick them out and stir into the cake batter as quickly as possible, and pouring all into the prepared baking pan, bake the cake in a moderate oven for an hour and a quarter. When done remove the cake from the oven and place it upon a sieve to cool. Notes.—The cake tins should always be prepared before the cake, because when baking powder is used there should be no delay in bak- ing, as it effervesces but once, and the mixture to be raised should be firmed by the heat while the baking powder is doing its work. For this same reason the raisins should also be prepared prior to the stirring of the cake and added last, because being heavy, they naturally sink to the bottom of the mixture if allowed to stand. Raisins should be never be washed, as it is extremely difficult to dry them thoroughly and the moisture which they would gather in being washed must inevitably cause heaviness in whatever they are used. Cakes should always be tested before being removed from the oven with a skewer or clean broom splint, for the reason that if ex- posed to a chill before thoroughly done they will always fall. If done, the skewer or broom splint will come out of the cake without any dough clinging thereto. The oven should always be kept closed, until the cake dough firms, and opened thereafter as little as is con- sistent with the proper watching of the baking. Cream Cake,—One teacupful of sugar, two teacupr fuls of flour, one teaspoonful of soda, two teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar, four eggs, one-half pint of milk, one table- spoonful of flour, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, one egg, one saltspoonful of salt, six drops of essence of almond.

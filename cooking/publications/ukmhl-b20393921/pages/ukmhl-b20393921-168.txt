Roll this dough out very thinly, cut it into strips about three inches wide, and wetting the edges of a pudding dish with cold water, line them with the strips of dough, also cut some small lozenges from the fragments of dough remaining, and place them ornamentally around on the rim of dough. Take the apples from the saucepan, and pouring them into a sieve, rub them through it, in order to make them perfectly smooth. Separate the yolks from the whites of the eggs, drop- ping the yolks into the apples, and putting the whites upon a dry plate. Stir the apples and yolks of eggs to- gether, and pour these when blended, into the pudding dish. The pudding dish must be placed in a quick oven and allowed to remain ten minutes to bake the paste and cook the eggs, and while this is being done, whip the whites of eggs to a very stiff froth, and when the pudding is taken from the oven, pile this froth upon the top of the apple very high, and smooth it over with a knife blade. Sprinkle over this the remainder of the powdered sugar, and return the dish to the oven for two minutes, that the froth of egg may set and brown slightly on the surface. Serve this pudding hot.

CORNLUNN. Folded Rolls.—One pint of milk, two ounces of butter, two medium sized potatoes, one-half teacupful of brewers yeast, one tablespoonful of sugar, one teaspoon- ful of salt, two pounds of flour. Bring the milk first to a tepid degree of heat, add to it the butter, and when the butter has melted, pour all into a mixing bowl, and add to these the potatoes which must have been boiled and finely mashed. Mix in the salt and sugar, and thicken all with half of the flour. Cover the bowl with a cloth, and set it in a warm place to rise through the night. When light knead the batter to a dough with the remainder of the flour, and let it rise the second time, the length of time required for this depending upon the quality of the yeast, heat, etc., but should not exceed an hour. When light, place the dough upon a board, roll it out to about an inch in thickness, and cut this into rounds with a large sized biscuit cutter. Have ready now in a saucer a little melted butter, and brush over one-half of the roll with this, folding the other half over upon it. When this is done, arrange the rolls upon a slightly floured baking tin, set them to rise for the third time, and when this is done, place the tin into a quick oven and let the rolls bake therein for ten minutes. Serve hot. Note.—In preparing all yeast and risen breads, care should be taken that the process of rising is not retarded by a chill, nor unduly accelerated by excessive heat, as the one will produce hard, heavy bread, and the other sour, hollow loaves.

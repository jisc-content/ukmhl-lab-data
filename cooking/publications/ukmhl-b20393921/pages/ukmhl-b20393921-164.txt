PUDDINGS. sugar to a cream. Stir into this a little of the flour and a little of the marmalade alternately until the full quantity of each is stirred in. Drop into this mixture then the yolks of the eggs, sprinkle over these the baking-powder and beat all thoroughly together. Whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth and stir this also into the bowl, taking care not to beat down the froth in the process. Grease with butter the inside of a pint and a half souffle tin, pour into it the pudding and bake in a mod- erate oven for one hour. Before placing the souffle tin into the oven, a band ot greased paper should be arranged around the top of the tin in order to keep the pudding from bursting over the sides should the heat of the oven cause it to rise quickly. When the pudding is done it should be turned out upon a hot flat dish and served with a custard sauce poured around it. The recipe for this sauce will be found upon page i68. Tapioca Pudding.â€”Three ounces of tapioca, three gills of milk, one tablespoonful of sugar, two eggs, one saltspoonful of grated nutmeg. Cover the tapioca with cold water twelve hours before the pudding is to be prepared, and let it soak in this until required. When ^bout to use, drain the tapioca as thoroughly as possible of the water, and when as dry as it can be made, put the tapioca into a saucepan, pour over it the milk, and placing it over the fire, stir slowly until the milk boils. Take the saucepan from the fire, place the eggs and sugar into a bowl, and beating them to a cream, pour this into the saucepan with the tapioca and milk.

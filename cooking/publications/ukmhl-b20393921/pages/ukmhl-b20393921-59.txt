45 BEEFSTEAK PIE. square, into each piece put a little of the pepper and salt, and then roll each separately into a roll. Put these rolls loosely in the bottom of a flat, vegetable dish, pour over them the Worcestershire sauce, the catsup, and the stock. Place upon a mixing board the flour and baking powder with a little salt, mix all well together and knead into a light dough with the cold water. Roll this dough out as thinly as possible and dividing the butter into three pieces, spread one piece upon the dough. Fold the dough into three layers and again roll out, and repeat this pro- cess until the butter is all used. When this is done, roll it out to a size a little larger than the top of the vegetable dish and a half an inch in thickness. Rub the top of the vegetable dish with cold water, and cutting some narrow strips from the dough, line the edge therewith, and wetting this strip of lining also with cold water, cover the remaining dough over the top, when the edges should be pressed together with the thumb and the whole evenly cut around with a knife. The pie should then be brushed over with a little egg or milk as may be most convenient, a hole cut into the top to permit the steam escaping, and the pieces of crust that have been cut off at the edges, cut and arranged ornamentally, over the surface to conceal the hole as much as possible without covering it. Put the pie to bake in a quick oven for half an hour, to raise and cook the crust, then cooling the oven a little, allow it to bake slowly an hour longer or until the steak is quite tender, which may be ascertained by inserting a skewer or a fork. Noteâ€”If the crust should appear to be browning too much or too rapidly in the baking, it may be protected by covering it with a sheet of greased kitchen-paper.

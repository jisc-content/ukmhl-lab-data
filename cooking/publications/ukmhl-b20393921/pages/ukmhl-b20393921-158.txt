PUDDINGS, 144 put it into a bowl and chopping the figs also very finely mix both together. Stir into this the bread crumbs, beat in a separate bowl the eggs and sugar, mix this with the figs, suet and bread crumbs, and greasing the interior of a melon mould pour this mixture into it, put on the cover and plunging it into a large saucepan of boiling water, let it with its contents boil for two hours. When done the pudding should be turned out upon a hot platter and served with wine or brandy sauce poured around it, for the preparation of which sauces, see pages 167 and 168. Albert Pudding.â€”One-quarter of a pound of but- ter, one-quarter of a pound of flour, one-quarter of a pound of sugar, three eggs, rind of one lemon, two ounces of raisins. Grease well a pint and a half pudding mould with but- ter and seeding the raisins, stick them against the walls of the mould at intervals so that they may garnish the exte- rior of the pudding when done. Put the butter into a bowl, rub into it the sugar with the back of a wooden spoon, and if the weather is cold the butter will require to be warmed a little, care being taken that it does not oil. Add to this cream of butter and sugar, a little of the flour and the yolk of one of the eggs. Stir all well together and repeat this process until the flour and eggs are all used. Add to the mixture now the grated lemon rind, whip the whites of the eggs to a stifl* froth and stir this in also, very lightly. By this time the butter with which the mould is greased will have cooled and the pudding may be poured in, using a little care to avoid disarranging the raisins.

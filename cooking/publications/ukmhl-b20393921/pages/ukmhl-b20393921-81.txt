67 BROILED CHICKEN. the iron to a very hot platter, put the butter in pieces over the top and press it in with the point of a knife blade, sprinkle over all the pepper and salt, and serve in its own gravy, of which the butter will have drawn out sufficient from the steak without adding water. Note.—To this gravy may be added a tablespoonful of Worces- tershire sauce if desired. Mutton or lamb-chops may be broiled also in this way. Broiled Chicken.—One young fowl, two ounces of butter, one teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper. The fowl must first be split down the back, washed thoroughly, in and out, with cold water and as thoroughly dried in a clean towel. Grease then slightly a broiler, season the chicken, inside and out, by rubbing on the pep- per and salt, and putting the fowl in it, place to broil over a strong, clear fire; as soon as the juices begin to draw out, commence turning and turn constantly thereafter until the meat is done, which may be determined by run- ning a skewer into the breast and when this draws out easily the chicken will have been sufficiently cooked. Serve on buttered toast, distributing butter also in pieces over the fowl and send it to table very hot. Note.—Unless a very young spring chicken is used for broiling it will be better that the fowl should have a slight preparatory cook- ing by steaming which may be done by putting the chicken into the broiler and laying this over a baking pan of boiling water, then cov- ering it with a plate, set all into the oven for about twenty minutes. If the broiling fire smokes in the least, throw upon it a handful of salt, which will at once clear it, and prevent the fowl tasting smoky.

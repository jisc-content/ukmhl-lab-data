Ill BOILED PARSNIPS. Gabbage S.-la-Mode.—Provide: one head of cabbage, one-quarter pound of cold chicken, two ounces of cold pork, one-quarter pound of rice, three ounces of butter, one-half ounce of flour, one pint of brown stock, one teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of pepper, one Bermuda onion. A close firm head of cabbage should be selected, and this well washed in cold water, after which it must be placed in a large saucepan of boiling water, and boiled over a brisk fire for fifteen minutes. At the end of this time take the cabbage from the water, place it upon a platter to cool a little, and while this is cooling, put into a chopping bowl and chop very finely the chicken and pork, chop the onion also and mix it with the meat, season all with the pepper and salt, wash well the rice and mix it with the pork, fowl and onion, open the leaves of the cabbage gently, and insert- ing this mixture between them, bind the cabbage around with a piece of twine, and melting in a large saucepan the butter, fry the cabbage in it until thoroughly brown. Mix the flour with a little of the stock in a bowl, and when the lumps are all beaten out, add the remainder of the stock. Pour this over the browned cabbage, and let all stew very slowly for three hours thereafter. When done, serve in a vegetable dish with the sauce poured around. Note—Cold roast beef or lean roast mutton, may be substituted when chicken is not convenient. Boiled Parsnips.—Prepare : ten medium sized parsnips, three ounces of butter, three gills of milk, one tablespoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, one saltspoonful of grated nutmeg.

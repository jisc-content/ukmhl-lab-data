CHICKEN CROQUETTES. 8/ When the sauce is quite cold upon the pieces of fowl, arrange them neatly into the bottom of a flat dish, chop roughly the jelly and scatter it around and garnish the dish either with fresh sprigs of parsley, or with parsley finely chopped and sprinkled over. Notes—Small pieces of cold turkey may be made up in this way, into a most delicious entree. A leek or onion may be used to flavor the sauce, being put in, if used, with the parsley. Chicken Croquette??.—One-half of a cold chicken, six mushrooms, one gill of stock, two tablespoonsfuls of cream, one-half teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, one saltspoonful of grated nutmeg, two eggs, six tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, one ounce of butter, one ounce of flour. The skin must first be taken from the cold chicken and the bonesjremoved, when the meat should be chopped very finely, and the mushrooms, having been also well washed and chopped, must be mixed therewith. Melt the butter in a saucepan, stir into it the flour, add by degrees the stock, stirring until it boils and then put into it the cream. Season with the pepper and salt, flavor with the nutmeg, and let all cook briskly for two minutes. When this has cooked, remove the sauce- pan from the fire, stir into it the chopped chicken and mushrooms, and pour all out upon a plate to cool. When quite cold separate into equal parts, and form the compound with the hands to something near the shape of a pear, beat the eggs well upon a plate, roll each cro- quette therein, and placing the bread crumbs upon paper, roll each also in this, and throwing them into hot clari- fied fat, fry for two minutes.

187 PUMPKIN PIE. Peach Pie.—One quart of peaches, three ounces of sugar, three tablespoonfuls of cream. Line a pudding dish with flaky crust—see page 183,* and cut also a round of the same, large enough to cover the top of the pudding dish. Bake the crust lining and the covering upon flat baking tins in a quick oven for fifteen minutes; while these are baking, pare and slice the peaches, which must be very ripe, mix together the sugar and cream and pour over them, and when the crust is done, place the prepared peaches in the pie dish, cover them over with the top crust and place all in the oven for five minutes; in order that the fruit may steam through and the crust brown lightly upon the surface. Note.—When small fruits are to be made into pies, such as straw- berries, raspberries, etc., they should be treated in the manner above laid down, as baking them with the crust causes them to lose flavor and freshness. Custard Pie.—Three eggs, three gills of milk, one ounce of sugar, one-half teaspoonful of grated nutmeg. Line a pie tin with the pie crust, see page 185, and putting the eggs and sugar into a bowl beat them together until the eggs become very light. Add to this the milk, and pour all into the crust lined pie tin, place the whole in a moderate oven, and bake the pie for half an hour. When done, grate over the surface the nutmeg, and serve cold or hot as the taste may suggest, although cus- tard pie should be cooled at once if desired cold, as the crust soaks with standing, and becomes unpalatable. Pumpkin Pie.—One-half of a pumpkin, three eggs, one pint of milk, one-half teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, one saltspoonful of powdered mace, four ounces of sugar.

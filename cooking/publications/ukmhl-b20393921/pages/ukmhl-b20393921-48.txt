34 ME A TS, Kedgeree.—For this will be required: one pound of cold boiled fish, two ounces of butter, two eggs, one teacupful of rice, one teaspoonful of curry powder^ one saltspoonful of salt, one-half saltspoonful of pepper. Boil the eggs for ten minutes, and the rice for a quarter of an hour. Chop the eggs,into irregular pieces ; and removing the skin and bone of the fish, melt the butter in a saucepan, and add thereto the hard boiled eggs, the fish and rice. Stir all now together, over the fire, until it is very hot, taking care that the mixture does not burn, it being very dry and apt to spoil, since the only moisture in it, is the butter. Add, just before serving, the curry-powder, pepper, and salt, and piling it very high in the middle of a hot dish, garnish the preparations with a little fresh parsley, and serve very hot. Note—Instead of garnishing this dish with sprigs of parsley, the parsley may be chopped and sprinkled over the top. MEATS—FIRST DIVISION. ROASTS. Roast Beef.—Six pounds of sirloin beef, one-half tablespoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of pepper, one ounce of butter, one-half ounce of flour, one-half pint of second stock.

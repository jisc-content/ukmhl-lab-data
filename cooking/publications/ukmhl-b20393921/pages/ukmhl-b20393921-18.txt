4 SOUPS. Mock Turtle Soup. —The ingredients for this soup must be provided in the following quantities : One calf's head, five ounces of flour, five ounces of butter, one ounce of mixed spice, two Bermuda onions, two wine-glassfuls of sherry, five quarts of cold water, one lemon, one tablespoonful of mushroom catsup, one- half tablespoonful of salt and two teaspoonfuls of pepper. The method of preparation is : First soak the calf's- head in cold water for an hour for the purpose of cleans- ing it of blood or such other remaining impurities as there may be, then after drying the same in a clean towel, put it into a large sauce-pan and pour thereon the five quarts of cold water. The sauce-pan is then placed over a quick fire, and being carefully cleared of scum as it boils, which it should do speedily, the onions, mixed spices, pepper and salt must be thrown in at once. Hav- ing reached the boiling point and the flavoring materials been added, the whole should now be permitted to boil slowly until the meat will readily separate from the bones —a period of from two to five hours to be determined by the age of the calf—when the tongue is to be removed and skinned, also the meat taken from the cheeks and both cut into small pieces to be presently used. The bones and head remaining in the saucepan, must now be permitted to boil four hours, at the end of which the liquor should be drawn off and strained, and the small pieces of meat remaining in the saucepan, must be col- lected, cut finely, seasoned with pepper and salt, to which add a little flour, and then combined with the. two fresh eggs to give consistency to the mixture, rolled into small balls, and placed in the oven for five minutes in order that they may keep shape by being hardened.

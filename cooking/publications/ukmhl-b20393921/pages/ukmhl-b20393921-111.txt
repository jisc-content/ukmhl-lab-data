97 TOAfA TO FARCI, order that sand, grit or other foreign substances may be drawn out. Trim off the green leaves and cut the stalk squarely across about two inches below the flower, after which prepare a large saucepan by putting it over the fire, filling it two-thirds full of boiling water with a table- spoonful of salt. Into this saucepan put the cauliflower, the flower down- wards and covering it until the water boils up vigorously, when removing the saucepan cover, all should be allowed to boil rapidly for fifteen minutes. At the end of this time take the cauliflower from the water and placing it upon a gratin plate with the flower uppermost, wrap over it thickly but lightly a clean towel both to keep it hot and to absorb such moisture as may have remained in the top. Melt in a small saucepan the butter into which stir the flour, and add by degrees the cold water. When this boils take it from the fire, add to it the cream and two ounces of the grated cheese. Season all with the cayenne and pepper, and removing the towel from the cauliflower pour this sauce over it. Sprinkle over the flower the remaining ounce of cheese and place all into a quick oven where the cheese upon the top must be allowed nicely to brown. Serve immediately. Notes.â€”If Parmesan cheese cannot be obtained, any strong, old cheese that is dry enough to grate, may be used instead, In boiling all vegetables and cereals the more rapidly the water boils the more satisfactory will be the result. If a gratin-plate is not available, the cauliflower must be put upon a plate that will stand the heat of the oven and in serving, a napkin may be laid under and prettily folded around to conceal the plate, if unsightly.

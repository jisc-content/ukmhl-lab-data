ME A TS. 68 Pork Sausages.—One pound of pork sausages, one and one-half pounds of raw potatoes, one tablespoon- ful of cream, one ounce of butter, one teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper. Put the potatoes pared, into a saucepan, cover them with cold water, and bringing them quickly to the boiling point over a brisk fire, throw in the salt. Boil them now rapidly until they begin to break on the surfaces when they will be half cooked, and the water should be strained carefully off them, the saucepan closely covered, and drawn to the side of the fire, that they may finish cooking in their own steam. When a skewer will go into them readily, set the potatoes for a moment, with the saucepan uncovered, full over the fire, that the dampness of the steam may dry off, and while hot mash them finely, adding the cream, pepper and butter, after which again cover them closely in order that they may keep hot while the sausages are being prepared. Prick through the skin of the sausages now with a fork in various places that they may not burst with the steam that will be generated in them under the action of heat, and placing them in a cold frying pan, put them over a moderate fire, that the fat may draw out in which to cook them, and fry for ten minutes. Take up then the potatoes and fill them into the bot- tom of a small hot platter, and smooth them down with a knife blade that has been dipped in milk, to a flat bed about an inch in thickness, and across this bed arrange the sausage lengths at regular intervals. Notes.—If the gravy from the pan is used at all it must be served by itself in a gravy boat.

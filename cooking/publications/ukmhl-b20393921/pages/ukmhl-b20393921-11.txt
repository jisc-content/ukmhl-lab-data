PREFACE. course of lectures, the whole range of instruction, and should give the particular application of the general prin- ciples ; a book that should be not a mere stereotyped schedule of dinners, suppers and breakfasts, nor a de- pressing list of semi-intelligible recipes, but one that should present a comprehensive insight into the general rules for the intelligent preparation of food, and at the same time clearly describe the several means and pro- cesses of arriving at desired results. In response to such demand this volume has been prepared. Nothing has been included in it, of which the practical worth has not been thoroughly tested, and it is believed that the examples have been so selected, that, although of necessity limited in number, they demonstrate the whole theory and practice of the culinary art, and will make the reader familiar with the most approved methods and the latest attainments therein. The purpose of our work is now set forth, although if the whole story were told it might be proper to show how the original cook-book grew from an onion, the veritable " Piece of chalot Which she never forgot." But this touches the romance of the whole matter, without which nothing, however prosaic, is complete. With such prose and such suggestions of romance as belong to my subject, these pages are now submitted to the interpreta- tion of those to whom my book is most affectionately dedi- catedâ€”the world-wide sisterhood of Housewives and their Husbands^ trusting that through its instrumentality all may be convinced that while Heaven still furnishes the food, the promethean fire of knowledge has redeemed the cooks.

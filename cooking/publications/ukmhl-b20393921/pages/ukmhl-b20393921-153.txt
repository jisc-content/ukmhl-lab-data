OMELETTE SOUFFLE. When boiling take the saucepan from the fire, throw into it the chocolate and the sugar, and drop in the yolks of the eggs one by one, stirring all meantime. Whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth and stir this in also, very lightly. Pour the mixture into the souffle tin, which should make it about two-thirds full, and place the tin into a deep saucepan containing sufficient water to reach half way up the sides of the form. Cover the saucepan and drawing it aside from the fire allow the water to simmer therein for thirty minutes, keeping it all the time covered. When steamed take the souffle from the saucepan, transfer it quickly to a silver souffle dish or fold around the tin in which it is prepared a napkin and serve at once, carrying the dish upon a hot shovel if the dining-room be distant from the kitchen.

TRIPE WITH ONION SA UCE. 217 well greased pint and a half mould, cover the top of this with a piece of paper, and place the mould, in a saucepan containing sufficient water to reach half way up the sides of the mould, and allow its contents to cook in this while the water boils for one hour. Turn the casserole when done out into a deep, hot dish and serve with egg sauce poured over and around it for which sauce see recipe on page 163. This dish may be garnished with red and green chillise if desired. Boiled Tripe.—Eight pounds of tripe, one-half tablespoonsul of salt. Cover the tripe with cold water and let it stand in this over night. Removing it from the bath, place it in a saucepan, cover it with cold water, put the saucepan over a quick fire and when boiling, drain the water off and cover it with additional cold water. Continue to drain off and recover the tripe with suc- cessive quantities of cold water until the water at last boils up quite clear and ceases to give off a disagreeable odor. Draw the saucepan to one side of the fire and allow its contents to simmer very slowly for five hours keeping the pan covered that the water may not boil away. When done, add the salt and the tripe is ready to dress in any manner desired, or may be served simply as it is. Tripe with Onion Sauce.— Two pounds of boiled tripe, three gills of milk, one-half teaspoonful of white pepper, one Spanish onion. Cut the tripe into small irregular pieces. Put these into a saucepan, cover them with the milk and allow all to stew over a slow fire for half an hour.

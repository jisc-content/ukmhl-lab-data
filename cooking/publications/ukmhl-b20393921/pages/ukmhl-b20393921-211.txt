197 SULTANA CAKE. Set this again for two hours in a warm place to rise, add the remainder of the flour and knead the dough slightly. Cut from it pieces of dough which should be moulded in the hands, to the shape and size of a large egg. Gash them over the surface with a pair of scissors, place them upon a slightly floured baking tin, let stand for a short time to resume their lightness, and bake in a quick oven for fifteen minutes, drawing them out, how- ever, when about half done, long enough to sprinkle each galette with a little sugar. Serve either hot or cold ac- cording to taste. BREAD AND CAKES. CAKES.

CALF'S FOOT JELLY. 179 Take the saucepan from the fire and having pressed out the juice of the oranges and lemons and strained it, add this to the contents of the saucepan, after which pour the mixture into a mould and stand the mould upon ice : when it becomes jelly, turn it out upon a crystal or other jelly plate, and serve. Calf's foot Jelly.—Two calf's feet, juice of two lemons, rinds of three lemons, one-quarter pound of cut loaf sugar, ten cloves, one inch of cinnamon stick, whites of three egg, one-half gill of sherry wine, three pints of cold water. Cut the feet into three pieces—across the first joint and through the hoof. Place them in a large saucepan cover them with cold water, and putting the saucepan over the fire, bring all quickly to the boiling point. When the water boils take the feet from the saucepan, and throwing them into a basin of cold water, wash them thoroughly. Put the feet when washed into a copper or porcelain- lined saucepan, pour over them the three pints of cold water, put the saucepan over the fire and when the water boils, draw it to one side and let its contents simmer very slowly for five hours. Strain the liquor through a horsehair sieve, or if this be not convenient, through a coarse towel, let the stock so extracted stand over night, and then removing the grease which will have gathered upon the top, dip a towel in boiling water and wash the surface of the stock which will be found quite firm, having stood for twelve hours. Now put the stock into a copper or porcelain-lined saucepan, and placing this over the fire let it melt. Add

PIES AND PASTRIES. drop the yolks in with the mixture in the bowl, and beat all well together, adding two tablespoonfuls of the sugar. Line a pie tin with pie crust, see page 185, pour the mixture from the bowl into it, and placing the tin into a moderate oven, bake the pie for twenty minutes. Whip to a stiff froth the whites of eggs, and to this add the remainder of the sugar, and when the pie is done take it from the oven and place over the top the sugared froth of egg, when it should be returned to the oven for five minutes that the froth of egg may set" and brown slightly upon the surface. Serve hot or cold as the taste may dictate, although a lemon pie should never be allowed to stand long enough for the crust to become soaked with its moisture. Apple Pie.â€”One and one-half pounds of apples, three ounces of sugar, one tablespoonful of cold water, one-half teaspoonful of grated nutmeg. Line a pie tin with pie crust, see page 185, wet the edges of the crust with a little cold water, pare, core and slice the apples and arrange these in the tin. When this is done sprinkle over the apples the sugar and nutmeg and pour in the cold water ; then cut a covering of the crust of the proper size, having rolled it to the thickness of one-third of an inch, cover the pie with this, pressing it firmly together with the lining crust at the edges, and cutting two or three slits in the top with a knife to permit the steam to escape while the pie is baking. This pie should be baked in a quick oven from twenty minutes to half an hour, according to the length of time the apples may require to be exposed to the heat before becoming soft.

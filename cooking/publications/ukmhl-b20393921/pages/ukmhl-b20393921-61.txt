47 HARICOT OF MUTTON, The butter must first be melted in a saucepan, and when the smoke arises therefrom put into it the beef and brown well on both sides. While the beef is browning put into a bowl the flour and make it smooth with a table- spoonful of the stock ; add then the catsup, Worcestershire sauce with the pepper and salt, and the remainder of the stock, stir all until thoroughly blended and pour the mix- ture over the browning beef. Stir the liquor around the meat until it boils, skimming the grease from the top as it arises, and adding then one carrot and one turnip, sliced, also the onion. Draw the saucepan now aside from the blaze of the fire, and allow it to simmer slowly for two hours; meantime, half an hour before the time for cooking expires, cut the remaining carrot and turnip into fancy shapes with a vegetable cutter, throw them into a small saucepan filled with boiling water and cook them until quite tender. When the meat is done, place it upon a large hot platter, strain over it the gravy, and taking the prepared carrot and turnip from the water, drain, and garnish with them the stew.

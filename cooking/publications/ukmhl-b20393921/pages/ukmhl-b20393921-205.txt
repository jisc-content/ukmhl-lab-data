191 FRENCH ROLLS. Notes,—Rye bread may be made from wheaten potato sponge. The sponge must be set over night by taking three potatoes, boiling them, and mashing these in a half pint of the liquor in which they are boiled, stir in also wheat flour until a light batter is made and break- ing into this half of a yeast cake mix all thoroughly together and stand in a warm place to rise. With the addition of this yeast, the r}'e bread is prepared in the same manner as the wheat. Flour should be sifted for bread as well as for pastries and cake. Milk Rolls.—One pound of flour, one ounce of butter, one ounce of sugar, one teaspoonful of baking powder, one saltspoonful of salt, one-half pint of milk. Put the flour into a bowl and rub into this the butter with the hands. Add to this the salt, half an ounce of the sugar and the baking-powder. Make a well in the centre of the mixture, pour into it the milk, stir into this the dry- flour from the sides, and turning all out upon a mixing board, knead all together as quickly and lightly as possi- ble. Cut the dough into six pieces, and draw each piece quickly to the length of about four inches, with a sharp knife cut each roll twice across the top, place them side by side upon a slightly floured baking tin, and bake them in a quick oven for twenty minutes. At the end of this time withdraw the tin from the oven, brush the rolls over with a little milk, sprinkle over their tops the remainder of the sugar, and return them to the oven for one minute to dry the milk. Serve hot. Note.—In using baking powder for dough, the quicker the mix- ture containing it is baked, and the less handled, the more satisfac- tory the result. French Rolls.—One ounce of butter, one saltspoon- ful of salt, one-half pint of milk, one egg, two tablespoon- fuls of brewers yeast, one and one-half pounds of flour.

ROAST GROUSE, 71 in small pieces over the breast of each, and putting the pan in a moderate oven, roast the birds therein for an hour and a half, basting them constantly with the butter as it melts.

Partridge Pie.—One brace of partridge, one pound of filet of veal, one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, three gills of brown stock, four ounces of butter, one dessert spoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of pepper. Pluck, draw and singe the partridges after which split each in halves. Put into each half a piece of butter, sprinkling them also with a little pepper and salt. Place then in the bottom of a deep pie dish the filet of veal, sprinkle over it the chopped parsley and putting the halves of partridge upon this, line the edge of the dish with a strip of puff paste,—seepage i82,pour over all the stock, and cover over all a blanket of the paste rolled to half an inch in thickness. Bake the pie in a quick oven for an hour and a half. Note.—If desired half a pound of lean bacon may be placed upon the veal as a flavoring ingredient. Roast Grouse.—Two brace of grouse, one-half pound of butter, one dessert spoonful of salt, one tea- spoonful of pepper. The birds should hang in a cool place at least three days after being shot, when they should be plucked, singed and drawn, and wiped outside and inside with a clean cloth.

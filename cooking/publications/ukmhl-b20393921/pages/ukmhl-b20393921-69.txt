55 BRAISED FILET OF VEAL. Stewed Kidney.—One pair of ox-kidneys, one ounce of butter, one and one-half ounces of flour, one- half ounce of flour of rice, three gills of second stock, one teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, one dessert spoonful of mushroom catsup, six drops of caramel. Begin by washing the kidneys thoroughly in cold water. Dry them well in a towel and cut into very thin, slices. Prepare upon a plate the flour, pepper, and salt, into which dip each piece separately, and melting the but- ter in a frying pan, when the blue smoke arises, brown the kidney therein. As the pieces of kidney become brown remove them from the butter into a stew pan and when all are thus transferred, put the stock into the frying pan, and stir until it boils. When boiling pour the stock over the kidney in the stew-pan and let all cook over a very slow fire, for an hour and a half. At the end of this time put the flour of rice into a bowl, moisten it with the catsup, add the cara- mel, and pouring this into the stew-pan with the kidneys, cook all together for half an hour longer. Serve in a cov- ered dish. Braised filet of Veal.—Three pounds of filet of veal, one-quarter of a pound of fat bacon, one and one- half pints of stock, one carrot, one turnip, one head of celery, one teaspoonful of whole white pepper, one tea- spoonful of salt. Cut the bacon into thin strips about two inches in length and one-third of an inch in width. Place next the filet upon a board and with a sharp knife take off the skin, then threading a larding needle with the bacon, lard the top of the filet with it as thickly as possible. When the veal is larded, cut the vegetables into small pieces and

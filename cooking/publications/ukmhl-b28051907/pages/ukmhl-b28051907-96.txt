78 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT AND COOKERY. dark. Veal should be firm to the touch, and at least three months old before being killed. The fore quar- ter of the three last-mentioned meats is always the cheapest. Steaks are cut from the sirloin, the tender- loin, the rump, and the round. The most economical is the round steak, and when the beef is large and ten- der, and the steak cut from the top of the round, it is a very delicious piece of meat. BROILING. For broiling the fire must be clear; coals from a hard-wood fire or charcoal are best, but the most com- mon fires for broiling are the hard coal. Beefsteak should be cut three fourths of an inch thick, sprinkled with salt, pepper, and flour, put in toaster, and placed over the fire ; as soon as it begins to brown on one side, which should be in two minutes, turn and brown on the other side; keep turning every few minutes until done, which should be in ten minutes if the steak is to be rare, but fifteen if well done. Now place on a warm dish, butter, and send to the table instantly. Chops are broiled in the same way, omitting the flour. Never use a fork to turn chops or steak, as much of the juices of the meat is lost that way. When there are no coals over which a steak or chop can be broiled, heat the frypan very hot, and put into it about a tea- spoonful of butter to prevent the steak from sticking; then put in the steak, and cook about the same time as if broiling over the coals. Fish is broiled in the same way, only that the broiler must have a little pork or butter rubbed over it before the fish is put on. It must, however, broil more slowly than beefsteak or

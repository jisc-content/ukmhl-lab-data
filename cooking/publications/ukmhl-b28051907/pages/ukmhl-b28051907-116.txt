SEVENTH LESSON. Materials. â€” Two quarts of beans, one and a half pounds of salt pork, eight potatoes, one beet, one turnip, one carrot, one onion, three eggs, one head of lettuce, four table-spoonfuls of oil, one large cup of vinegar, one cup of milk, one table-spoonful of mus- tard, salt, pepper, one table-spoonful of molasses. SALADS. Salads are quickly and easily made, and can be prepared from almost any of the cold vegetables. We do not give in this lesson (for practice) any of the rich salads, but shall give a few receipts that the pupils may use if the teacher thinks best. In that case the plain salads must be omitted. FRENCH SALAD DRESSING. Three table-spoonfuls of oil, one table-spoonful of vinegar, one saltspoonful of salt, one half of pep- per. Put the salt and pepper in a cup and then add one table-spoonful of the oil; when all is thoroughly mixed add the remainder of the oil and the vinegar. This is dressing enough for a salad for six persons. If you like the flavor of onion, grate a little of the juice in the dressing.1 1 Onion juice is got by first peeling the onion and then grating

MEAT HASH. Chop fine any kind of cold meat (before chopping dredge with salt and pepper. This is always the best manner of seasoning hash, as by this means all parts will be seasoned alike). If you have cold potatoes, chop fine and mix with the meat; if they are hot, mash. Allow one third meat to two thirds potato.

Put the head and bones on to boil in two quarts of hot water; have five potatoes pared and sliced thin ; put a layer of potatoes and then one of fish in the kettle; dredge well with salt, pepper, and flour; keep putting in alternate layers of potatoes and fish until all is used. Take about one and one half table-spoon- fuls of salt in all, one half a teaspoonful of pepper, and one small cup of flour. Fry brown half a pound of salt pork, and then add to it the onion cut in thin

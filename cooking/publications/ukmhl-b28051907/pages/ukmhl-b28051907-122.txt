Now cross and tie the legs down tight; run a skewer through the wings, fastening them to the body; fasten the neck under the body with a skewer, and tie all with twine. Rub the turkey with salt, and spit it; baste often with the drippings and flour, and occasionally with butter. About fifteen minutes before dishing baste with butter, and dredge on a little flour; this will give it a frothy appearance. For eight pounds, allow one hour and three quarters, if roasted in the tin-kitchen ; if in the oven, one hour and a half, and fifteen minutes for every pound more. Serve with giblet gravy and cranberry sauce. To make the gravy: Boil the heart, gizzard, liver, and neck in two quarts of water two hours ; then take them up and chop the gizzard and heart, braid the liver, and put them back again ; thicken with one table-spoonful of flour wet with cold water; season with salt and pepper. Let this simmer one hour longer, and when you dish the turkey turn the drip- pings into this gravy ; boil up once, and send to the table. Make all the gravy for poultry in this man- ner, omitting the chopped gizzards in chicken gravy. ROAST CHICKEN. Prepare, stuff, and truss the same as turkey. A pair of chickens, weighing each two and a half pounds, will require an hour and a quarter to roast if in the tin-kitchen; one hour, if in the oven.

• 66 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT AND COOKERY. sugar, after being ground very fine, is termed choco- late. Vanilla is often added as flavoring. Sometimes the cocoa is mixed with starch. When the bean is broken into small pieces, these are called nibs. To Make Cocoa. —Put a gill of the broken cocoa in a pot with two quarts of water, and boil gently three hours. There should be a quart of liquid in the pot when it is done ; if the pot has boiled so rap- idly that there is not this much, add more water, and let it boil once more. This same cocoa will do to be boiled again. Many prefer half broken cocoa and half shells. If the stomach is delicate, it is better than all cocoa. Sugar and milk are used with it, the same as with tea and coffee. Shells. — Use twice as many shells as broken cocoa, and boil twice as long. CHOCOLATE. Scrape one ounce (one of the small squares) of Baker’s, or any plain chocolate, fine ; add to this two table-spoonfuls of sugar, and put into a small sauce- pan with one table-spoonful of hot water; stir over a hot fire for a minute or two, until it is perfectly smooth and glossy; then stir it all into a quart of boiling milk, or half milk and half water; mix thor- oughly, and serve immediately. If the chocolate is desired richer, take twice as much chocolate, sugar, and water. Made in this way, chocolate is perfectly smooth and free from oily particles. If it is allowed to boil after the chocolate is added to the milk, it becomes oily and loses its fine flavor.

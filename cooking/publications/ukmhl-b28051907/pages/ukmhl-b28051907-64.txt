CHAPTER X. THE BREAD WE EAT. x. The bread we eat is made from wheat, rye, In- dian corn, and sometimes oats and rice. 2. Wheat is the principal grain used for bread. There are a great many kinds of wheat, more than one hundred and fifty! 3. The red wheat, from which macaroni and vermi- celli are made, contains a greater amount of nitrog- enous substances than the white wheat does. It is harder, and is not so floury. 4. Wheat is composed of nearly two thirds starch, about eleven parts albuminoids, water, mineral, and other matters. Whole wheat meal, on an average, contains one part flesh-formers to six and a half of heat-givers. 5. In different kinds of flour the amount of starch varies. There are now two processes of making flour : one is called the old process, or St. Louis flour, and the other the new, or Haxall flour. In the new there is more starch and less of the albuminoids, the flour makes a very handsome white bread, which keeps moist for a long time, from the fact that starch in baking is changed to gum. It is questionable if this is the best flour to build up the body.

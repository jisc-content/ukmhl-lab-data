100 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT AND COOKERY. POTATO SALAD. Ten potatoes cut fine, the French dressing, with four or five drops of onion juice in it, one table-spoon- ful of chopped parsley. LETTUCE SALAD. Two small or one large heads of lettuce; break all the leaves off carefully and wash each one separately and then throw them in a pan of ice water, where they should stand at least an hour ; then put them in a wire basket or a coarse towel and shake out all the water. Either cut with a very sharp knife or tear into large pieces. Mix the French dressing with this and serve immediately. Beets, cucumbers, tomatoes, cauli- flower, asparagus, etc., can be each served as a salad with the French or boiled dressing. Cold potatoes and cold beef, mutton or lamb, cut up fine and fin- ished with either dressing, make a nice salad. ADDITIONAL SALADS. RICH SALAD DRESSING. One table-spoonful of mustard, one table-spoonful of sugar, one tenth of a teaspoonful of cayenne pep- per, one teaspoonful of salt, yolks of three uncooked eggs, juice of half a lemon, one quarter of a cup of vinegar, one pint of oil, one cup of whipped cream. Beat yolks of eggs and the dry ingredients (until they are very light and thick) either with a silver or wooden spoon, or, better still, with a second sized Dover beater; then add a few drops of oil at a time

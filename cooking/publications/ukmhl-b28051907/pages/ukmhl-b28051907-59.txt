CHAPTER VIII. 5. Beets. — The beet is also largely water; has VEGETABLES. 1. A certain amount of fresh vegetables is necessary to perfect health. The most common and useful with us are the potato, squash, turnip, beet, cabbage, and onion, because they can be kept for many months after being gathered from the garden. 2. The potato is the most general in use. Three fourths of the weight of the potato consists of water; the greater part of what remains is starch, with a little fibrine, albumen, and small quantities of mineral and other matters. Being so largely composed of starch classes it among the carbonaceous foods. 3. Turnips.—Nine tenths of the weight of the turnip consists of water. It contains no starch, but has mineral, pectose, and other matters in small quan- tities. Some chemists think that it is a nutritious food, and others think that there is very little nutri- ment in it. Having so much pectose and no starch, it is a good vegetable to be eaten with potatoes. 4. Squash. — A large proportion of the squash is water, while starch, sugar, albumen, and mineral mat- ters are found in it. As a food it is pleasant and healthful.

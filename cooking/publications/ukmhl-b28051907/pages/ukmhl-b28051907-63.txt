CHAPTER IX. FRUITS. Fresh fruits are very necessary to perfect health. They must be ripe and sound to be entirely healthful. Unripe and decaying fruit causes a great amount of sickness and death every year in our large cities, where it is sold at low prices on the streets. The most use- ful of the fruits, and very extensively grown, is the apple. It is not only good eaten fresh, but it can also be cooked in more ways than any other fruit. Figs, dates, and bananas, either fresh or preserved, are very healthful, nutritious fruits.

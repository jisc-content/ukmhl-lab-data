For the white clothes, half fill the tub in which the flannels had been rubbed with clean warm water. Now begin with the cleanest articles and wash them carefully ; wring them out and put into the tub of warm water; rinse out of this, and put soap on the most soiled parts, which in under-clothes are the bands, sleeves, and waists. Place all in the boiler, with cold water enough to cover them, and let them come to a boil; then take them up and put them in a tub of clean cold water, rinse them thoroughly in this water, then rinse again in warm water which has been slightly blued, wring very dry from this, and hang out.

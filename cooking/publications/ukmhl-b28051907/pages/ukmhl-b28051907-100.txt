Materials. â€” Any large fresh fish weighing from four to five pounds, three large crackers, quarter of a pound of pork, two table-spoonfuls of salt, quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper, half a table-spoonful of pars- ley, two table-spoonfuls of flour. Scrape and wash the fish clean, and rub into it one table-spoonful of salt; roll the crackers fine, and add to them the parsley, half the pepper, half a table- spoonful of salt, a table-spoonful of chopped pork, and an eighth of a cup of water. Put this into the fish, and fasten it together with a skewer. Now cut gashes across the fish, about half an inch deep and two inches long; cut the remainder of the pork into strips and put them in the gashes. Now dredge well with flour. Put a tin sheet in a baking pan, lay the fish on this, cover the bottom of the pan with hot water, put in a rather hot oven, and bake one hour, basting very often with the gravy in the pan, and each time dredging with salt, pepper, and flour. The wa- ter must be renewed in the pan very often. When done, lift the fish out of the pan on the tin, and slide it carefully on the platter. Now set the baking pan on top of the stove, and if there is not gravy enough to make half a pint, add more water. Mix one tea- spoonful of flour with cold water; stir it into the boiling gravy, season, and serve on the dish with the fish.

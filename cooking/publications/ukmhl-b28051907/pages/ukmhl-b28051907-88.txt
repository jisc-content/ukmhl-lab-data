It should al- ways be scalded first, and then let cool to blood-heat. One table-spoonful of lard or butter makes the bread a little more tender when water is used. In cold weather, some kitchens grow cold very quickly after the fire goes out. In that case, the bread should be made earlier in the evening and set in a warmer place (about eighty or ninety degrees); because if it begins to rise well the first two hours, it will continue to rise, unless the temperature of the room falls to the freezing-point. The reason for let- ting the rolls rise longer than the loaves is that the rolls being smaller, heat penetrates them much more quickly than it does the loaf, and of course fermen- tation is stopped sooner; therefore the small rolls do not rise so much in the oven as the large loaves.

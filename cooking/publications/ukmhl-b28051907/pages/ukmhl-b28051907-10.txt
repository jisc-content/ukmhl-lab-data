PREFACE. IV and dwelling. The schools have been in successful operation for two years, and have done a wonderful amount of good. The same method is followed with marked effect in the manufacturing and mining dis- tricts. After seeing all this, the determination was taken to write a book that could be used in,the schools and families of America with like beneficial results. In this work the aim has been to state clearly the causes of disease and the prevention of the same through sanitary laws ; the order of household work ; the com position and preparation of food, with sick-room cook- ery ; and to give a few hints on the care of the sick. In treating subjects of such importance, it has been difficult to decide what to omit, and yet make the work complete ; but the kind reception of the Apple- dore Cook-Book, and the generous support given it during the past seven years, lead the author to hope that this volume may, too, find favor with the public.

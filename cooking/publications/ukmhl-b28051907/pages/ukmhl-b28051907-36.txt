No poison in the air is more deadly than that from decay- ing vegetation. In the autumn many fevers arise from the poisoned air caused by the dying plants and fall- ing leaves. WASHING. 1. The first days of the week are always best for washing, because the clothing is then washed nearly as soon as changed, and so more easily, as the dirt does not have time to harden in them. Also, be- cause dirty clothes are very unhealthy to have in the house; and, again, it is the time set apart for this work in nearly all families, and therefore people are less liable to interrupt on “ wash-day; ” lastly, it is best to have the work planned for each day, and then it will be sure to get done in time. 2. For washing you must have plenty of water and soap, and if the water is hard add a little washing soda or borax. 3. Look the clothes over carefully, putting the clean- est by themselves to be washed first. Have two tubs, which about half fill with warm water in which has been dissolved soap enough to make a good suds (hard water will take more than soft). Into one tub put the cleanest articles, having the most soiled at the bottom ; into the other tub put the rest of the clothes, always remembering to have the most soiled at the bottom of the tub. Have a third tub of soap suds, hot as you can bear your hands in it. Shake all the dust and lint out of the flannels, putting the cleanest white ones into the hot suds, and wash very carefully,

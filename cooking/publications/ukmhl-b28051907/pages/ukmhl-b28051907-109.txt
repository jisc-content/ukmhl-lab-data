91 BOILED RICE PUDDING. VEAL OLIVES. Veal olives are made in the same manner, except that a dressing like chicken dressing is made for them. For one and a half pounds of veal take three crackers, half a table-spoonful of butter, half a teaspoonful of savory, one fourth of sage, one teaspoonful of salt, a very little pepper, and one eighth of a cup of water. Spread the strips with this and proceed as for beef olives. BOILED RICE PUDDING. Pick and wash clean one cupful of rice, and put into a basin with a pint and a half of cold water ; set on the stove where it will cook slowly, or, better still, set into another basin of water, and cook slowly. When the rice has absorbed all the water, turn on it one quart of new milk, and stir in one table-spoonful of salt; let this cook two hours, stirring often. Serve with sugar and cream. BOILED RICE PUDDING, NO. 2. Pick and wash one cup of rice, and boil in one quart of boiling water fifteen minutes, and then drain dry. Wring a pudding-cloth out of boiling water, and spread in a deep dish, and turn the rice into it, and sprinkle in one cup of raisins and a table-spoonful of salt; tie the cloth loosely that the rice may have room to swell, and boil two hours. Serve with lemon sauce, or sugar and cream.

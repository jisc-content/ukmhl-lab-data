All fish that is split must have the inside put to the fire first, and when that be- gins to look a handsome brown the side on which the skin is should be turned to the fire. Care must be taken that the skin does not scorch, as it does so very readily. BOILED POTATOES. Pare the potatoes, and let them stand in cold water an hour or two ; then put them on in a kettle, which has a close cover, with boiling water enough to cover them. Let them boil fifteen minutes; then for every twelve potatoes add one table-spoonful of salt, and boil fifteen minutes longer. Now pour off all the water; set the kettle on the back part of the stove, with a clean towel over the potatoes, for three minutes, that they may dry and yet have the steam pass off. Shake them up and turn into a hot dish, and send to the table immediately. It takes them half an hour to boil, five minutes to dry and be served ; so that you want to put them on just thirty-five minutes before time for sitting down to the table. No vegetable requires more care in boiling than thevpotato, and yet none gets less. Remember, the water must be boiling when the potatoes go into it, and must boil all the time they are on the fire ; that the water must be poured off as soon as they are done ; and that they must be served as soon as dry.

10 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT AND COOKERY. into the wells. It is just like pouring a liquid which we wish to make clear into a sieve. If the sieve is coarse, the liquid is not perfectly clear; if we keep on pouring it through one sieve after another, and each sieve be finer than the last, we will soon have it nearly pure ; if there is anything dissolved in it, of course that will go through the finest sieve. Now the deeper the well the purer the water, because the earth is like the sieves, which keep back all the un- dissolved impurities. In light sandy soils the wrater filters through very rapidly, and carries with it much impure matter. If the well is near the house, and there are soap-suds or slops, etc., thrown on the ground near it, the rain will carry those impure wash- ings through the earth into the well water. Water from a well so situated is like slow poison, caus- ing many diseases, the most common being fevers. Many people sicken and die from drinking it. Thoughtless people often do their washing near their well, throwing the dirty water upon the ground ; or they have no sink-drain, so all the waste water is thrown out of doors and windows, to be finally washed into their well, keeping it poisonous all the time, while they wonder what makes so much sickness in their family. 10. We can see that the rain that falls within a few feet of the well would not be enough to keep the well full of water, but that it must come from some distance, so manure heaps should be at a great dis- tance to prevent them from rendering the well foul. 11. Another source of poisoning is the leaves which fall into the water and decay in the well. It is best

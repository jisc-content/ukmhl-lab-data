96 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT AND COOKERY. will give some general rules which will cover them all. Green Vegetables. — All green vegetables must be washed thoroughly in cold water, and then be dropped into water which has been salted and is just begin- ning to boil. There should be a table-spoonful of salt for every two quarts of water. If the water boils a long time before the vegetables are put in it has lost all its gases, and the mineral ingredients are de- posited on the bottom and sides of the kettle, so that the water is flat and tasteless, the vegetables will not look green and have a fine flavor. The time of boil- ing green vegetables depends very much upon the age, and how long they have been gathered. The younger and more freshly gathered the more quickly they are cooked.

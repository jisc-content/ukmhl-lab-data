CHAPTER Y. THE HUMAN BODY. i. The human body has often been compared to the steam-engine, and no better illustration can be found. In the engine we have a material structure ; in the body we have a material structure also, only very much more complicated. The fuel and water with which the engine is fed answers to the food^for the supply of the human body. The same agent, air, is used to consume the fuel in both. The burning of the fuel is necessary in both, that work may be done ; and the greater the amount of work to be done, the greater must be the supply of fuel. ANALOGIES OF THE STEAM-ENGINE AND THE LIVING BODY. The steam-engine, in action, takes : — 1. Fuel. Coal and wood, both combustible. 2. Water, for evaporation. 3. Air, for combustion. And produces: — 4. A steady boiling heat of 2120, by quick combustion. 5. Smoke loaded with carbonic acid and watery vapor. The animal body, in life, takes : — 1. Food. Vegetables and flesh, both combustible. 2. Water for circulation. 3. Air, for respiration. And produces : — 4. A steady animal heat, by slow combustion, of 98°. 5. Expired breath, loaded with carbonic acid and watery vapor.

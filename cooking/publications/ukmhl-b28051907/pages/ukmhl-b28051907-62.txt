It is used as a salad, as a seasoning for soups, and, when cooked, as a vegetable. 4. Water-cress. — This salad is grown in wet places and shallow-running streams. It has nearly the same food value that celery has. It is always eaten uncooked. Great care must be taken in wash- ing and preparing these salads, as there are frequently little insects upon them. 5. Cucumbers. — Cucumbers have but little food value, and to some persons are very injurious. They are eaten when uncooked as salads, and are also cooked in various ways.

Cut half a pound of lean beef (the round is the best) into dice. Put into a saucepan, with a teaspoonful of salt, one of flour, and one fourth of pepper. Pour on this a large pint of cold water. Let it stand an hour or two, then put on the fire; bring slowly to a boil, and boil slowly for an hour. If it has boiled away too much, add a little hot water; but this rather hurts it. Skim off carefully every particle of fat. This tea is more palatable than the other, and can be taken by those not extremely sick. SACK POSSET. Pound one Boston cracker, or one soda biscuit. Put it in a pint of cold milk; set it on the fire, and simmer fifteen minutes. Beat together one egg, one wineglass of wine, a little sugar, salt, and nutmeg. Turn this into the simmering milk, stirring con- stantly ; boil up once, and take from the fire imme- diately. CHICKEN BROTH. Put the bones and about one pound of the lean meat of chicken into a saucepan with three pints of water. When it comes to a boil, skim well. Simmer three hours, and strain and salt. If the patient can bear it, a little rice or tapioca boiled with it is an im- provement.

54 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT AND COOKERY. the bread. Baking also changes a great part of the starch into gum. Some of the starch belonging to the wheat does not change, except that the cells are broken and the starch dissolved so that it is digestible. The gluten becomes tender, and unites with the starch paste. LEAVEN. Leaven is a paste made with flour and water and allowed to sour. Sometimes housekeepers and bakers keep a piece of the risen dough for the next bread mixing, and they call this leaven. In many of the bakeries of Paris they do this, and use a little dry yeast with it in making common bread, but it always gives to the bread a slightly sour taste. SALT-RISING BREAD. In salt-rising a batter is made with flour, salt, milk, and water a little more than blood-warm. The basin in which the batter is must be covered and placed in another basin of blood-warm water, and kept in a warm place near the fire, where it will keep at that temperature until it becomes a perfect sponge ; more flour is then added to it, and all is well kneaded and put in the baking-pans, and allowed to rise again till ready to bake. Bread made by this process is very sweet and delicate, but one tires of it very quickly. AERATED BREAD Aerated bread is made by mixing the flour with water into which carbonic acid has been forced under high pressure. As soon as the pressure is removed the bread begins to rise, and is baked immediately.

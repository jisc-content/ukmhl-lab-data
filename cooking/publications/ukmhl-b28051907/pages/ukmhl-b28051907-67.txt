THE BREAD IVE EAT. 49 water and let it dry, we shall find it is composed of grains which, if rubbed between the hands, will give off a crackling sound, and be fine and powdery. If we could examine these grains with a glass, we should find that each grain is covered with an outer skin, that will not dissolve in cold water; but if we put the starch in boiling water these skins crack, and the in- sides are then dissolved and become gummy. We see from this how important it is that everything into which starch enters should be thoroughly cooked. INDIAN CORN. ii. Indian corn is poorer than wheat as a flesh- former, but richer than rice. It contains more fat than any of the other grains except oats. It is used in this country in a great many forms as food. It is eaten, while green, from the cob, as a vegetable; the whole pearled grains as samp ; the broken grains as hominy; and the ground grains as meal ; and in a very fine powder it is sold as corn starch, but it is rarely used as a laundry starch. In any form it makes a healthful addition to our food, but it is partic- ularly convenient and palatable in the form of hominy or meal. The hominy is ground from quite fine to very coarse. The meal, also, is ground coarse and fine. There are two processes for grinding meal. The old one gives a very sweet-flavored meal when it is first ground, but owing to the heating that it gets between the millstones and the moisture in the corn, it will grow musty very quickly. The product of the new process, called granulated meal, keeps perfectly well for years in all climates. The corn is first dried for 4

CHAPTER III. THE WATER WE USE. 1. The water we use is of as great importance as the air we breathe. It forms three fourths of the sur- face of the earth, and about three fourths the weight of living animals and vegetables. 2. Pure water is composed of oxygen and hydro- gen, eight ninths of its weight being oxygen, and one ninth hydrogen. Hydrogen, like oxygen, has, when a pure gas, neither color, taste, nor smell. 3. In the waters of our wells and rivers there are also vegetable, animal, and mineral substances, beside the gases of the air. The animal and vegetable sub- stances are considered unhealthy by nearly all chem- ists and physicians, but there is a great difference of opinion in regard to the mineral. The gases from the air give the water a bright, pleasant taste. 4. The purest water we have is rain water collected in the country; after a shower has cleared the air and washed off the roofs of the houses, it is run into cis- terns, where sometimes it is filtered. The cisterns should always be exposed to pure air, as the air not only gives flavor to the water, but oxygen, which puri- fies it by burning up all decaying animal and vege- table matter. Cisterns are divided into two parts ; the one where the water first enters being divided from

40 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT AND COOKERY. fish is placed with the skin under, and so the fish does not freshen. In the morning, the fish should be placed in the same position and covered with water, and then let come td a boil; cover tightly, set back where it will not boil, and cook for five or six hours. Fish cooked in this manner will be tender and juicy. Boiling hardens the fibres of the salt-fish just the same as it does meat. Salt-fish cooked in this way, and served with potatoes, beets, carrots, and salt fried pork or butter sauce, makes a very substantial dinner. What remains from dinner can be used for a great many dishes, such as hash and fish-balls. All cold fish left from one meal can be warmed up in some way to be a savory dish and used again.

73 BREAD AND YEAST. each pupil practice kneading on this batch; then one of the pupils should begin a new batch, the remainder of the class directing her. This dough will answer for an afternoon class, if put where the temperature is between ninety and a hundred; or for a class the next morning, if it stands in the kitchen for an hour, and is then set in a cold room, where it will rise very slowly. The yeast can now be made, and while it is cooling the baking and cleaning up may be done, ad- ditional notes given, and dresses changed, so that there shall be no delay, but as soon as the bread is baked the class may be dismissed. The yeast will have cooled meantime, and the half cup of yeast will be added. The pupils knowing all about the tempera- ture and the time, they cannot fail to understand this important element of bread making. The bread les- son is the hardest of all the cooking lessons, on ac- count of the rising; but if these simple directions are followed the foundation will be laid for good bread making all through the after life of the pupil, and nothing should stand in the way of the perfect mas- tering of this lesson. When more or all Graham is desired in the bread, the sponge can be made with the Graham, using, how- ever, only half as much yeast: as there is so much more gluten in the whole wheat, it ferments more rapidly than the fine white flour. Demand of each pupil that she make bread and yeast at home, and re- port to you.

43 VEGETABLES. gestible. When dried, they require a great deal of cooking. They are very nearly alike in composition : over one half is starch, one fourth casein ; the re- mainder is water, mineral matters, etc. The casein resembles the curd in cheese, and belongs to the flesh- forming or nitrogenous foods, so that these vegetables by themselves form a more perfect food than any other of which we have spoken. If a small teaspoon- ful of mustard be added in the cooking of beans, there is less danger of their producing colic, as they often do when eaten by some persons. Carrots and Parsnips. â€” Carrots and parsnips are somewhat alike in their composition. The parsnip contains albumen, sugar, starch, cellulose, lignose, pec- tose, dextrine, fat, and mineral matter. The carrot contains albumen, sugar, cellulose, lignose, gum, pec- tose, fat, and mineral matter. There is no starch in carrots, but more sugar, so that its heating power equals the parsnip. SALADS. 1. Under salads are classed all green vegetables that are eaten uncooked. This term is now commonly applied to all vegetables, meats, and fish which are eaten with a dressing made of oil, vinegar, salt, etc. In this place we shall only speak of the vegetable. Those most used as salads are lettuce, celery, cress, sorrel, chicory, tomatoes, and cucumbers; also some kinds of cabbage. 2. Nearly all the food value that lettuce contains is in the water and mineral matter which it introduces into the body, but it is a very refreshing dish when eaten with rich food.

32 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT AND COOKERY. ALBUMINOUS MATTERS. 1. Albuminous matters are derived from both ani- mal and vegetable sources, but they are more abun- dant in animal substances, for which reason animal food is richer and more nutritious than vegetable food, and less of it is needed to supply the waste of the body. Albumen is the principal ingredient in the white of the egg. It is found in the blood, and it is this element which makes it grow hard when exposed to the air or heat. Caseine is the albuminous sub- stance of milk, gluten of flour, and is a common in- gredient of all vegetable juices. It exists in two states : one soluble in water, the other insoluble. 2. One of the properties of albumen is that of co- agulation, that is, hardening. They do not all coag- ulate by the same method. The white of an egg will harden when heated to the boiling point; the fibrine of the blood coagulates when exposed to the air. 3. Milk will not coagulate when boiled; but if a piece of rennet is added to it, in a few minutes it will harden if it is blood-warm. This property of coagu- lation belongs entirely to albuminous substances. An- other property belonging to them is that they will fer- ment. This is also a very important property. When milk or soup has become sour, it has fermented ; when we put bread to rise with yeast, it begins to ferment; but if the yeast is sweet and the bread does not rise too long, the bread will be sweet. 4. Fermentation will not take place in a very cold or very hot atmosphere, and will be most rapid about 100 degrees Fahrenheit, that is, about as warm as the human bodv. j

There are less fibres in lace to take up the starch, so it must be dried before starching, unlike cotton or linen articles, and the starch must be boiled thick, being quite hot when used. Never iron lace curtains. Place a mattress in a clean spot which is exposed to the sun ; on this pin firmly and smoothly a sheet; then upon this pin your curtain, being par- ticular to have the sides all straight, and the whole perfectly smooth to dry in shape.

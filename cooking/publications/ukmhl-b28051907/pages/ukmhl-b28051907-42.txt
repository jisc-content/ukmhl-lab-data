24 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT AND COOKERY. grate until the fire burns brightly; after removing the blower the fire will continue, if undisturbed, for from six to twelve hours. LAMPS. 1. There used to be a great many kinds of oils burned, and of course a great many kinds of lamps suited to the different oils, but now kerosene oil is what nearly every one uses who has not gas in the house. The wick should touch the bottom of a lamp and be trimmed square across. 2. Keep every part of the lamp perfectly clean, or the air cannot circulate freely and the lamp will not burn well. Never burn a lamp when the oil is very low, as a gas collects in the lamp, which is liable to explode. 3. Do not fill the lamp to the very top, as the heat expands the oil, which forces its way out of the lamp, making it both dirty and dangerous. 4. When you light a lamp, do not turn the wick up much at first, until the chimney is gradually heated, because the inside of the glass heats first, and if the heat is strong at first the glass expands too rapidly and breaks. 5. When you take a lamp from a warm room into a cold one, or into a draft, you must first turn down the wick that the chimney may cool a little ; a cold current of air striking on a hot chimney will break it as quickly as heating too rapidly. 6. In a very moist climate, like East Florida, or on the sea-shore, the lamp-chimneys break very often; for cool moist air cools glass more quickly than cool dry air does.

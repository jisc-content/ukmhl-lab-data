STEAMED CUSTARDS. US MILK TOAST. Put one quart of milk on to boil. Mix two table- spoonfuls of flour with half a cup of cold milk, stir this into the boiling milk and let it boil ten minutes, then add one table-spoonful of butter, and one large teaspoonful of salt. Now dip the bread in, and serve. The bread must be toasted as carefully for this as for dry toast. The bread must be stale to make good toast. BAKED CUSTARD. One quart milk, four table-spoonfuls of sugar, four eggs, one teaspoonful of salt, a little nutmeg. Beat sugar, salt, and eggs together with a spoon, then add the milk. Fill the custard cups, grate on a little nutmeg, and place the cups in a deep baking pan, then nearly fill the pan with warm water. Bake in a moderate oven till firm in the centre. It will take from twenty to forty minutes to bake them, all de- pending upon the heat of the oven. The slower they bake the richer and smoother they will be. Try them by running a knife through the centre; if they are firm they are done. STEAMED CUSTARDS. Steamed custards are made the same as baked, only that they are steamed from twelve to fifteen min- utes over a kettle of boiling water.

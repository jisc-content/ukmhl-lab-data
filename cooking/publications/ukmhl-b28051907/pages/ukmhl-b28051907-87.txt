The loaves will take from forty-five to sixty minutes to bake, and the rolls will bake in thirty if placed close together in the pan ; but if French rolls are made, they will bake in fifteen minutes. As soon as baked, the bread should be taken out of the pans, placed on the table, where they can rest against something until they are cool; they should then be cut in a stone Dot or tin box which

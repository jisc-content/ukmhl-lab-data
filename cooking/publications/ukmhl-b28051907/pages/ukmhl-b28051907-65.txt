THE BEE AD WE EAT. 47 6. Wheat and all cereal grains consist of three lay- ers of bran-coats and the inside or heart of the grain. The outer coat of the grain has but little food value, and as it is very hard and irritating to the digestive organs it is better to have it removed from the wheat before grinding. 7. The greater part of the gluten, phosphates, etc., are in the bran-coats. The inside of the grain con- sists of cells filled with starch. When the wheat is ground by the old process, a great part of this bran is ground so fine that after being sifted many times some of the bran still remains. This makes the flour darker, but also much more healthful and nutritious. The less of the bran-coatings there is in flour the whiter it is. 8. Graham meal, or, as it is now commonly called, whole wheat meal, the whole wheat ground rather fine and not sifted. But we do not always get the pure wheat meal. It is oftener a poor quality of flour with which common bran has been mixed. A great difference of opinion exists concerning which is the more nutritious, flour or Graham; some scientific persons claiming that flour is robbed of its most healthful parts, while others claim Graham is not so nutritious as flour for hard-working people, because in its irritation of the digestive organs it causes the digesting fluids to flow more freely, and so hastens the food through the various channels too rapidly, not al- lowing time for proper digestion or absorption. Both of these theories are right in part, but to a hard-work- ing person we would advise the use of flour as the most nutritious and economical of the two, because all of it is digested.

48 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT AND COOKERY. For persons of quiet habits, such as students and persons in offices or stores, the Graham would be better. 9. If you will take a little flour and wet it with cold water, enough to make a dough, and then place it on a sieve and pour a stream of cold water over it, work- ing the dough all the time with one hand until the water that runs through the dough is no longer white, you will have remaining on the sieve the gluten of the flour; and after the water has stood a while, at the bot- tom of the pan there will be pure wheat starch, which you can get by pouring off the water very carefully. The water that you have poured off from the starch contains the sugar, gum, and mineral matter; these being dissolved in the water, they cannot be separated like the gluten and the starch. By washing a little dough in cold water we have learned some very important things. That the gluten of the flour does not dissolve in cold water; that it is of a rather grayish color; that it is tough and elastic, something like India rubber. This tough, elastic property is very important in bread and pastry making. 10. When bread is made with yeast, the yeast unit- ing with the sugar of the flour produces carbonic acid gas. This gas tries to escape from the dough, but the tough gluten makes a wall which holds it back. The gas goes on forming in the dough, and soon there is a panful of light sponge where a few hours before there was about a third of . a pan of solid dough. Next, we learned that the starch of the flour does not dissolve in cold water; and if we pour off the

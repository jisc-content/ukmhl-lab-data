TENTH LESSON. OMELETS. Beat lightly two eggs, and stir in one table-spoonful of milk and a pinch of salt. Heat the omelet pan hot, and then put in half a table-spoonful of butter, and when melted turn in the beaten eggs; set on the fire, shake the pan, cook until a light brown ; then fold the omelet and serve on a hot dish. Ham, mush- room, lobster, chicken, and all kinds of omelets are made by chopping up the meat, and laying it between the folds before dishing. QUAKER OMELET. Three eggs, one and a half table-spoonfuls of com starch, half a cup of milk, half a teaspoonful of salt, one table-spoonful of butter. Put a good sized omelet or frypan, with a tin cover, on to heat. Beat the yolks of the eggs, the salt, and the corn starch together ; then beat the whites to a stiff froth, add to the yolks, then add the milk; but- ter the hot pan with the table-spoonful of butter, pour the mixture in, and cover with the hot cover; keep where it will not burn, but will brown, for about seven minutes, fold and serve on a hot dish. This omelet is improved by having the cream sauce poured around it.

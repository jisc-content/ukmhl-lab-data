CHAPTER VI. PHYSIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL CLASSIFICA- TION OF FOOD. Nitrogen compounds are the chief muscular flesh formers. They may yield fat, and, by their oxidation or burning, set free heat and motion. Carbon compounds are sugar, starch, etc. They produce heat. The carbon and nitrogen compounds are all combustible, that is, they will burn or oxidize in the body. Water and mineral compounds, such as phos- phate of lime and salt, are not combustible, but they are necessary to the building up and repairing of the body. The flesh-forming foods are sometimes termed the nitrogenous foods, and sometimes albuminoids. The foods that produce heat are often termed warmth-giving, and sometimes carbonaceous foods. We must remember that the nitrogenous foods form muscular flesh, and that the carbonaceous foods pro- duce heat; also that one is as necessary as the other to a healthy body. In winter and a cold climate we require more fat and starch to keep the body warm than we do in a hot climate or in summer. Also, we must have a proper supply of such food as goes to build up the bones and muscles.

This will make a clear, strong coffee, with a rich, smooth flavor. The advantage of the two extra strainers is that the one coming next to the fine strainer prevents the coffee from filling up its fine holes, and so the coffee is clear, and made with more ease. The upper strainer causes the boiling water to fall on the coffee in a shower, like rain. In this way it is more evenly distributed, and the fine coffee is not carried through the fine strainer, as it would be if the water were poured directly on the dry coffee. When milk or cream is added to this, it does not turn a rich yellow, as in the case of that boiled with an egg. A few spoonfuls of this coffee, without sugar or milk, aken after dinner, is said to help digestion. STEAMED COFFEE. Another mode of preparing coffee is steaming it. The coffee is put into the pot, and the boiling water poured on it. This pot, which is made to fit into a tea kettle, is then placed in the kettle, and let cook from ten to twenty minutes, the water in the kettle boiling all the time. This will make a clear, deli- cious coffee.

When there is not cream for coffee, the milk should be boiled, as it makes it much richer. As soon as the milk boils up it should be taken off the stove, since it grows strong and oily by much boiling. To many persons it is in-

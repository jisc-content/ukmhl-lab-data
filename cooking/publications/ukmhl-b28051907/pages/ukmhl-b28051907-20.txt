2 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT AND COOKERY. the lights will begin to burn dimly, ?lnd the people will begin to feel drowsy and oppressed. But if the windows are opened, the pure air filled with oxygen rushes in, and the poisoned air filled with carbonic acid gas rushes out. The people begin to breathe easier and feel better, and the lamps burn brighter. 6. In breathing we take air into our lungs; there the blood absorbs the oxygen and carries it through the body, where it burns up all the waste tissue, and so keeps our bodies warm, strong, and healthy. 7. It is oxygen which makes fruit and vegetables decay, and meat and fish “ spoil.” For this reason, when we wish to keep any of those things for any length of time, we make them boiling hot, to free them from the oxygen, and then seal them in a jar so tight that no air can enter. If kept perfectly free from this gas they will keep for years. 8. You will ask what is the use of nitrogen in the air ? The nitrogen dilutes the air. If the air were undiluted oxygen, animal and vegetable life would burn out too rapidly. “ A mixture of the fiery oxy- gen and the inert nitrogen gives us the golden mean. The oxygen now quietly burns the fuel in our stoves and keeps us warm; combines with the oil in our lamps and gives us light; corrodes our bodies and gives us strength; cleanses the air and keeps it fresh and invigorating; sweetens foul water and makes it wholesome ; works all around us and within us a con- stant miracle, yet with such delicacy and quietness we never perceive or think of it until we see it with the eye of science.” (Steele.) 9.

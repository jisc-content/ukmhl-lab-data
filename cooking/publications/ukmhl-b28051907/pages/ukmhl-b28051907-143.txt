MISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES. REMARKS ON DIGESTION. In the stomach is produced a liquid secretion called the gastric juice. This does not act upon starch or fat of any kind. The only thing it dissolves is the albuminous matter. Now, when this albuminous blatter is not saturated with fat, the gastric juice acts upon it readily; but as in the case of pastry, dough- nuts, fried meats, etc., where the whole mass is satu- rated with a fatty substance, it takes a long time before the gastric juice can get at the albuminous matter to act upon it: hence the distress by the overworking of the stomach ; and if this kind of food is partaken of frequently the stomach force will be weakened and refuse to do its work. This will disarrange every other member of the digestive organs, and, in a short time, you have a first-class dyspeptic. All food, therefore, should be as light, porous, and free from fat as possible. When fat is used, it should be in such a manner that it will separate readily from the other substances on entering the stomach. Alcohol retards digestion, and renders it incomplete, by coagulating the gastric juice. Food, when taken into the stomach either very hot or very cold, does not digest readily. Food taken when the body or mind is very tired does not digest

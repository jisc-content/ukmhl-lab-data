68 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT AND COOHER V are cooked pour off the water; mash them very light and smooth; then strain the hop water through a fine sieve on the potatoes; stir well, and add the mixture of flour, salt, and sugar ; mix all very thoroughly, and strain the mixture through a colander into a stone jar. When it is blood-warm add the yeast; cover tight, and set it to rise where it will be warm. It will rise in five hours. When risen, it will have a thick white froth on top. Now put into a stone jug or into bot- tles ; cork tight, and set on the cellar bottom or in the ice-chest, or, if you have neither, in the coolest place you have. Remember that great heat, like pouring boiling water on it, will kill the plant in the yeast, and also that freezing will do the same thing. The bot- tles or jug in which the yeast is kept must be washed out first with cold water, and then with soap and water ; and after that boiling water must be poured in, and let stand in it for at least half an hour. Yeast often becomes sour from the jug not being properly cleaned before being filled. The cork, too, must have the same care. In hot weather, the yeast should be made once a week. Plan to make enough for the bread, and to have enough to rise the new yeast. In very warm countries the dried yeast is the most used, and it is very convenient for rising liquid yeast in country places where the liquid yeast is not good. It is made by stirring into the fresh yeast Indian meal enough to make it so thick that it can be rolled out into sheets. It is then cut into little squares, placed on boards, and dried in the sun. It takes about three days to dry it.

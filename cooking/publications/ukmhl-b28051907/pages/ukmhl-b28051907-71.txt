THE BEE AD WE EAT. 53 used instead of water, and generally a little butter or lard is added to the dough to make the bread more tender. Bread with these ingredients must of course be more nutritious than that made with water ; but there is no bread that has the delicious sweet taste of the wheat, and that will keep as long, as yeast bread made with water. As the bread depends so much upon the yeast, great care must be taken that it is quite sweet and fresh. The compressed yeast made by Gaff, Fleischmann & Co., when fresh, will always make good bread. This firm have done a vast amount of good in this country by the introduction of their yeast and the examples they give us of what good bread is. If all our bakeries could copy' their bread, there would be a great change in the comfort and healthfulness to bread-buyers. When the dough is mixed, the water softens the gluten, and causes all the particles of flour to be cemented together. The yeast causes fermentation, changing the sugar of the flour and the sugar added to the flour into carbonic acid and alcohol: it also changes part of the starch into sugar. Carbonic acid gas being very light, it seeks to escape and mix with the air, but here it can- not do so because of the gluten. HOW BREAD CHANGES IN THE BAKING. The bread in baking loses about one sixth of its weight, but the loaf grows larger while baking, because the heat expands the carbonic acid, turns the water into steam and the alcohol into vapor. These escape through the pores of the bread, so that after baking and cooling neither carbonic acid nor alcohol is left in

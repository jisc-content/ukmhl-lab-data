99 SALADS. BOILED SALAD DRESSING. Three eggs, one table-spoonful of oil, one table- spoonful of sugar, one table-spoonful of mustard, scant, one table-spoonful of salt, one teacup of milk, one teacup of vinegar. Put oil, salt, mustard, and sugar into a bowl, stir until perfectly smooth, then add the eggs, beat well; now add vinegar, then milk; now place the bowl in a basin of boiling water, and stir until it thickens like soft custard. The time of cooking depends upon the thickness of the bowl. If it is a common white bowl and the water is boiling when it is placed in it and kept boiling all the time, it will take from eight to ten minutes, but if the bowl is very thick it will take from twelve to fifteen minutes. This will keep two weeks if bottled tight and kept in a cool place. VEGETABLE SALAD. Six potatoes, one half of a small turnip, one half of a carrot, one small beet. Cut potatoes into small slices, the beet a little finer, and the turnip and carrot very fine; chop (with a sharp knife) a spoonful of green parsley. Mix all thoroughly, sprinkle with a scant teaspoonful of salt, unless the vegetables were salted in cooking, and then add the whole French dressing or half a cup of the boiled dressing. Keep very cool until it is served. with a coarse grater, using a good deal of pressure. Two strokes will give about two drops of juice, which will be about enough for the above rule.

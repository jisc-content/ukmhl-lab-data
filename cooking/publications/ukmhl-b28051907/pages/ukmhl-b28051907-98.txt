8o HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT AND COOKERY. Put Graham in the mixing bowl. Put flour, sugar, salt, soda, and cream of tartar in the sieve; mix ail thoroughly; then pass through sieve into the Graham ; mix all well with the hands. Beat the eggs very light in another bowl; add the milk to them ; now pour this on the dry ingredients, and beat up well. Have the muffin pans well greased, and put a large table-spoon- ful of the batter into each cup ; bake twenty minutes in a quick oven. This will make twenty-four. Rye and Indian are made in the same manner. BREAD PUDDING. Materials. â€” One pint of stale bread, one quart of sweet milk, one teaspoon of salt, three table-spoons of sugar, two eggs. Soak bread and milk together for two hours; then mash all up fine with the back of the spoon ; beat eggs, sugar, and salt together, and add to the bread and milk; turn into the pudding dish, and bake in a slow oven for forty-five minutes. Run a knife or the handle of a spoon down the centre of the pudding, and if it does not look milky it is done. Serve with cream sauce. CREAM SAUCE. One egg, half a cup of powdered sugar, three table- spoonfuls of milk, half a teaspoonful of vanilla or lemon extract. Beat the white of the egg to a stiff froth; then beat in the sugar, then the yolk of the egg and the flavor- ing, and last, the milk. Serve immediately, as it spoils by standing.

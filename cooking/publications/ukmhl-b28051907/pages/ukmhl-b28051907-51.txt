33 CLASSIFICATION OF FOOD. 5. Albuminous matters are the only ones that pu- trefy. All substances containing albuminous matter will, when exposed to the air and moisture, become putrefied, and, if it is warm, much more rapidly than in a cold atmosphere. 6. Animal substances do not putrefy at a very high or a very low temperature, that is, if they are kept at the freezing point or boiling. When we say anything is at a low temperature we mean very cold, and when at a high temperature, it is very hot. So when meat or fish are to be kept for some days we either put them on ice, in a chest, or cook them. 7. If there is no moisture, putrefaction will not take place; for this reason meats and fish are often dried in the air and sun, and they will keep for years if kept in a cool, dry place. MEAT. 1. We will first consider meat, as it contains the most albuminous matter. If we take a piece of lean meat and strip it up very fine, and then wash it in a number of clean waters, rubbing the meat at the same time, we shall wash away all the soluble part, and there will remain only white threads. These threads are the fibres of the flesh, and the substance of which these threads are composed is named fibrine. It is an albuminous article of food. Fibrine also exists in the blood of animals. Heat, when as great as that of boiling water, hardens and shrinks fibrine, but if the heat is less than boiling and is continued a long time, it softens it. 3

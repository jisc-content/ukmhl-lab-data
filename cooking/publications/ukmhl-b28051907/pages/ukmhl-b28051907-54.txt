36 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT AND COOKERY. very large proportion of milk consists of water; the cream is largely fat. When milk becomes sour, the solid part separates from the whey, and is called curd. The curd is the albuminous part of the milk, while the cream is the carbonaceous part. The whey left after the curd is taken from the milk contains salt and other mineral matter necessary for digestion, and the earthy matter of which the teeth and bones are formed. EGGS. 1. Eggs, like milk, contain all the material neces- sary for the growth of the body. They are composed of two distinct substances, — the yolk and the white. The white consists of water, albumen, and mineral in- gredients. The yolk contains nearly a third of its weight in oil, a large quantity of albumen, a very large part of sulphur, and other mineral matters. The sulphur gives the yolk its yellow color, and it is this which causes the eggs to tarnish silver. Eggs are not easily digested by every person, but are very nu- tritious food for those who can eat them. 2. The most healthful modes of cooking eggs are boiling, poaching, and in omelets. The common mode of putting the eggs into boiling water and let- ting them boil rapidly for three or more minutes is not the best, as the heat hardens the albumen near the shell; and in this way, while the white of the egg becomes very hard, the yolk has not begun to cook. 3. The better way is to pour boiling water on the eggs, cover them closely, and let them stand where they will keep hot, but not boil, for ten minutes. Then they will be cooked through evenly, — the white and yolk alike.

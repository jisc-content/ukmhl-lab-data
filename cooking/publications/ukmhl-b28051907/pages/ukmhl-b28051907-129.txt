SAUCES. I I I STEWED PRUNES. Wash the prunes in warm water and rub them well between the hands. Put them in a kettle that you can cover tight, with two quarts of water to one of prunes. Stew them gently two hours. These will not keep more than two days in warm weather, but cooked in this way they do not require any sugar, and are very nice. CODDLED APPLES. Pare and core with an apple corer, cook the same as for apple sauce ; but allow one pint of sugar to one quart of water. CRANBERRY SAUCE. Pick and wash the cranberries, and put in the pre- serving kettle with half a pint of water to one quart of berries; now put the sugar on top of the berries, allowing a pint of sugar to a quart of berries. Set on the fire and stew about half an hour. Stir often to prevent burning. They will not need straining, and will preserve their rich color cooked in this way. Never cook cranberries before putting in the sugar. Less sugar may be used if you do not wish them very rich.

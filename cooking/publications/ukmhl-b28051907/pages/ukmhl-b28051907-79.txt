CHAPTER XII. TEA, COFFEE, CHOCOLATE, ETC. TEA. There are three varieties of the tea-plant; both black and green tea can be prepared from them all. Green tea is made from leaves which are dried quickly. Black tea is made from leaves which have first been allowed to stand twelve hours or more before roasting. The leaves wilt and grow moist in that time, and that is what gives the dark and peculiar appearance to this tea. In making tea the pot should be earthen, rinsed with boiling water, and left to stand for a few mo- ments on the stove to dry; then put in the tea-leaves, and let it stand a few minutes longer, and pour on the boiling water, leaving the tea-pot standing where it will be at the boiling point, but not boil, for from three to five minutes. For moderate strength use one tea- spoonful of tea to half a pint of water. If the water is soft it should be used as soon as it boils, for boiling causes all the gases which flavor the water to escape. But if the water is hard it is best to boil it from twenty to thirty minutes. The gases escape from hard water also, but boiling causes the mineral matter, which hardens the water, to settle on the bottom of the kettle, and the water becomes softer.

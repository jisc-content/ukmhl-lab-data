124 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT AND COOKERY. BURNS. Rub a little oil or butter on the burned part, and cover with soda. This is for slight burns, which many are always getting in the kitchen. If the air is kept from burns and cuts they will heal rapidly; for this reason burns are often covered with glue. UNFAILING CURE FOR CONSTIPATION. Three teacupfuls of coarse, clean wheat-bran, three of sifted flour, one heaping teaspoonful of cream of tartar, one half of soda, one of salt, seven of sweet butter. Mix with cold milk and roll into thin biscuit, and bake thoroughly in a moderately hot oven. They should be from one fourth to one third of an inch thick, and be cut with a small biscuit cutter. Great care must be taken that they do not burn, and at the same time that they get thoroughly baked. They will keep a long time if kept in a tight tin box; they should be eaten at each meal. â€” From Mr. Leo- nard Scott, after twenty years' experience. CURE NO. 2. A little while before retiring, mix a table-spoonful of flaxseed in cold water enough to make it pour readily, and on going to bed drink this. It is not nauseating at all, and will act on the bowels without deranging them as drugs always do. Drinking a glass of cold water at night and in the morning helps many persons. Eating fruit is also good. ,

34 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT AND COOKERY. 2. Tough pieces of meat are made very tender by stewing a long time, but they must never boil. 3. When the meat has been thoroughly washed to get the fibrine, the albumen is dissolved in the water. This is a very important part of the meat. It dis- solves in cold water, but hardens in hot water. If we put a piece of fresh meat in a pan of boiling water, and another piece in one of cold water, and let them cook the same length of time, we shall find that the water in which the meat was put cold is much richer with the juices of the meat than that which was hot when the meat was put in, and that the meat is poorer in flavor and juices than the piece placed in hot water. 4. We see why this is. The hot water coagulates the albumen which is on the surface of the meat; this fills up every little pore, and the juices cannot flow out. But the cold water dissolves the albumen, and draws it all out of the meat. Now if we wish to keep the juices in a boiled piece of meat we must first plunge it into boiling water, and let it boil rapidly for fifteen minutes, to harden the albumen on the outside ; then we must set it back where the heat will not be so great, and let it just simmer until done, because we have found that if we boil it the fibres will grow hard and shrivel up. If we wish to make soups, and get all the juices into the broth, we put the meat in cold water and let it heat slowly. We must remember this in broiling and roasting also, â€” always to have a quick fire for broiling, and when the meat is first put before the fire, or in the oven for roasting, because we first wish to harden the albumen, so that the juices shall not flow out of the meat while cooking.

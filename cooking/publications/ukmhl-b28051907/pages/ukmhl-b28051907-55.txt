Eggs are used for custards, puddings, pies, and cakes. They make these dishes lighter and more nu- tritious. When eggs are beaten very rapidly, they quickly break up into cells filled with air. The white of the egg will retain more air than the yolk, and for this reason it is very useful in making cake, or any other kinds of food where lightness is desirable.

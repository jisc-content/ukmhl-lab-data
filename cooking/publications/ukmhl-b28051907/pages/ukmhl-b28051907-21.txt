3 THE AIR WE BREATHE. and nitrogen, is without color, but it has a slight odor and a sour taste. By mixing two parts cream of tar- tar and one of soda, and wetting them, you can obtain carbonic acid. When soda is added to vinegar, sour milk, lemon juice, or any liquid acid, carbonic acid is produced. 10. When bread is risen by yeast, carbonic acid is produced. 11. It is carbonic acid which gives soda water its peculiar taste, and also causes it to foam. 12. Carbonic acid is a poison to animals if they breathe in much of it, but it is the food of plant life, just the same as oxygen is the food of animal life, and vegetation could no more live without it than we could without the oxygen. This is one of the reasons why people are so much healthier in the country than they are in the city. The leaves of plants which are constantly in the sunlight and are their lungs, breathe in carbonic acid and breathe out oxygen. Thus, we see, vegetation is in great part fed with a gas which is poisonous to animal life. We are breathing in oxygen and breathing out carbonic acid all the time. 13. Watery Vapor. â€” By watery vapor is meant the steam, whether visible or not, which rises from the surface of water when exposed to the air. 14. If it were not for this vapor, vegetation would dry up, and animal life would soon perish also. 15. Besides the vapor which comes from water, there is the animal vapor which we throw out from our lungs and the pores of the skin. This is very im- pure, and causes much disease. 16. Now that we know what the great bulk of the

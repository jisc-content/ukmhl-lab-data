Cover, and simmer ten minutes longer. Serve. BEEF OLIVES. One and one half pounds beef, cut very thin. Trim off the edges and the fat; now cut into strips three inches wide and four long; season well with salt and pepper; chop the trimmings and the fat very fine ; add to it three table-spoonfuls of powdered cracker, one teaspoonful of sage and savory mixed, one fourth of a teaspoonful of pepper, two teaspoonfuls of salt. Mix all very thoroughly, and spread on the strips of beef; then roll them up, and tie with twine. When all are done roll in flour. Have a quarter of a pound of pork fried brown ; take the pork out of the pan and put the olives in ; fry brown, then put them in a small saucepan that can be covered tight. Now into the fat remaining in the pan put one table-spoon- ful of flour, and stir until perfectly smooth and brown ; then pour in gradually nearly a pint and a half of boiling water. Stir for two or three minutes, season to taste with pepper and salt, pour over the olives, cover the saucepan, and simmer two hours. Take up and cut the strings with a sharp knife ; place them in a row on the dish, and pour the gravy over them.

Cover over, let it boil up once, skim, and set back where it will just bubble for two and a half hours \ then add the potatoes cut into slices, and one table-spoonful of flour, which mix smooth with half a cup of cold water, pouring about one third of the water on the flour at first, and when perfectly smooth adding the remainder.

25 HOUSE WORK. 7. When using a lamp to light a room, be sure the wick is turned up high enough to burn freely; if not, the room will soon be poisoned with the gas from it. 8. In case of sickness, where there must be a light kept, if you are without a night lamp, place the com- mon lamp in another room or hall, rather than turn the wick too low. 9. To have a bright fire, or a clear blaze from your lamp, it must be remembered that plenty of fresh air is necessary ; the lamp must therefore be kept clean, and the stove free from cinders and ashes.

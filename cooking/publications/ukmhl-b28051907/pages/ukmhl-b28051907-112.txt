SIXTH LESSON. Materials. â€” Two cups of molasses, one cup of In- dian meal, three table-spoonfuls of butter, two quarts of milk, three and a half cups of sugar, one and three fourths quarts of flour, one teaspoonful of ginger, two and a half teaspoonfuls of soda, three teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar, salt, seasoning. SOFT MOLASSES GINGERBREAD. One cup of molasses, one teaspoonful of saleratus, one of ginger, one table-spoonful of butter or lard, a pinch of salt, if you use lard. Stir this together, and then pour on one half a cup of boiling water, and stir in one pint of flour. Bake about one inch deep in a sheet. This is very nice if pains are taken to have the water boiling, and to beat it well when the flour is added. SPONGE-CAKE. Three eggs, one and a half cups of sugar, two of flour, one half of cold water, one teaspoonful of cream of tartar, one half of saleratus. Beat the sugar and eggs together, and add the water when they are light, then the flour, in which mix the saleratus and cream of tartar. Flavor with lemon, and bake in a quick oven twenty minutes. This will make two sheets of cake.

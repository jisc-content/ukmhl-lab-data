SICK-ROOM COOKERY. 123 A GOOD DRINK FOR THE LUNGS. Wash clean a few pieces of Irish moss ; put it in a pitcher, and pour over it two cups of boiling water. Set where it will keep at the boiling point, but not boil, for two hours. Strain, and squeeze into it the juice of one lemon. Sweeten to taste. If the patient cannot take lemon, flavor with wine, vanilla, or nut- meg. ANOTHER DRINK. Beat lightly one egg and one table-spoonful of sugar. Stir into this one cup of new milk, half a wineglass of wine, and a little nutmeg. This is nice without the wine. ANOTHER DRINK. Upon one teaspoonful of slippery-elm pour one cup of boiling water, strain, and season as Irish moss. LEMONADE. The juice of one lemon and one table-spoonful of sugar. Pour on this one cup of boiling water, and set away to cool. CURE FOR HOARSENESS. Bake a lemon or sour orange for twenty minutes in a moderate oven, then open it at one end and dig out the inside, which sweeten with sugar or molasses, and eat. This will cure hoarseness and remove press- ure from the lungs.

CHAPTER VII. 5. Baking fish carefully renders it one of the most FISH. 1. Fish is a very healthy and digestible food, but not nearly so nutritious as meat. White fish are much more easily digested than dark, having so much less oil. Fish is very nitrogenous, for which reason a good deal of starchy food should be eaten with it. Potatoes are particularly suitable on this account to be eaten with fish. It is now thought that fish is a better brain food than meat, because it contains so much phosphates. 2. Oysters, clams, and mussels are made indigest- ible by much cooking. They are all improved by being kept in salted water and meal for a day or two. 3. Lobsters and crabs are not easily digested. Cay- enne pepper should always be used in seasoning them, as that helps digestion. 4. Fish must always be thoroughly cooked, and if boiled it should be plunged into boiling water, well salted; then the kettle set back where it will simmer gently until done. Much of the nutritious part of the fish is lost in boiling. If the water is salted, it not only seasons the fish but hardens the water, and thus less of the nutritious qualities are lost.

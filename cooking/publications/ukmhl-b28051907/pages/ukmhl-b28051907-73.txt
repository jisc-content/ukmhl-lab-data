THE BREAD WE EAT. 55 BAKING POWDERS. Soda and cream of tartar and baking powders are used to make unfermented bread. Baking powders are a composition of an acid and an alkali. The acid takes the place of cream of tartar, and the alkali of soda; in fact, it is nearly always bicarbonate of soda. Baking powders, when pure, are the most convenient and safest mode of using chemicals where the cook is without a perfect knowledge of the relations be- tween soda and cream of tartar; because, to be per- fectly harmless, they must each neutralize the. other. It takes three fourths of cream of tartar to neutralize one fourth soda, if both articles are pure. It is a great mistake to mix the cream of tartar with the flour and then dissolve the soda with water, because you then must use a little more soda than would be neces- sary if you mixed the dry flour, soda, and cream of tartar together. Bread made with cold water is usually in the form of gems. The water must be very cold, the oven very hot, and the gem-pans hot. The water and salt are added to the Graham or wheat flour, and the batter is beaten very rapidly and thoroughly. This is to mix air with the batter. The mixture is then dropped by the spoonful into the pans, and they are immediately put into the oven and baked. In another chapter we shall have more exact rules for bread making.

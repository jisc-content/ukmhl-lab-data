Rice is sometimes used in the form of flour in bread and cake making, and sometimes the whole rice is first boiled and then added to flour or meal in making bread. But the most common mode is to use it as a vegetable, or in puddings. Rice contains a great deal of starch, a small quan- tity of fibrine, no fat, a very little mineral and other matter.

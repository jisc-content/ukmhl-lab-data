CHAPTER VIL SOUPS. The old-fashioned idea that uncooked meat must form the basis of all soups is an exploded one. Many delicious vegetable soups may be made without any meat, and the bones, scraps and ragged ends of yesterday’s roast should always be saved for the soup pot, as they make quite as good soup, if properly combined with vegetables and seasoning, as the raw ‘‘soup- meat” which used to be considered necessary. So, we see that' soups may be quite inexpen- sive, and, being nourishing and easily ab- sorbed, make a valuable addition to a dinner. Soup should, however, be served in small por- tions, lest the stomach be overloaded with it and filled with gases; and as everything we eat should be masticated to some extent, soup stocks, croutons or toast, should be served with it.

A good brand of yeast is put up in small dry cakes enclosed in round cans, and can be bought in most any grocery store, and can be used wherever yeast is recommended. We thoroughly realize that we cannot con- vert the public to the strictest hygienic meth- ods, and there are several recipes for dishes that we do not personally recommend and would not eat ourselves. Those, however, who are in the habit of using such dishes and must be regularly supplied with them will find the method of preparation here advised superior to the ordinary methods. For instance you will find recipes for pre- paring pork, lamb, and veal. Pork should never be eaten at any time under any circum- stances. Lamb, veal and all immature meats are preferably avoided.

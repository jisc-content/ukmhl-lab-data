THE PPIYSICAL CULTURE COOK BOOK. 69 77. Rice Croquettes.—Two cups cold boiled rice, one well-beaten egg, one teaspoonful but- ter, salt to taste. Work the butter, egg and salt into the rice, make into croquettes with the floured hands, and fry in oil. 78. Macaroni with Cheese.—The genuine Italian macaroni is the nicest. Boil one-half pound (or half a package of the French maca- roni) in plenty of salted boiling water for one hour. Drain, and put half of it in a buttered baking dish, season with salt, grate cheese over it, add the other half of the macaroni, then more cheese and some bits of butter on top. Pour over it enough drawn butter sauce to fill the dish—about one cup, and bake three- quarters of an hour. 79. Macaroni and Tomato Sauce.—Boil as above, and season. Serve with tomato sauce. 80. Macaroni a la Creme.—Boil the macaroni twenty minutes; drain and add a cup of milk, a little salt, and stew fifteen minutes. Pour over a rich drawn butter sauce, and serve with grated cheese.

CHAPTER IX. MEAT. The value of meat as a food is a much dis- puted question, which every one must decide for himself. Too much meat is certainly not good; but' if it is to be used at all, it is essential that it be cooked properly. In order to retain the juices and flavor of meat, the albumen on the outside must be co- agulated by heat. In roasting, have the oven hot when the meat is put in, and finish cooking at a more moderate heat. In boiling, put the meat at once into boiling water for fifteen min- utes, and then set back to simmer slowly. In stewing, have the stewpan hot, put in the meat' and let it coat over before adding water. It is a good plan to save all the suet and fat from beef or veal for drippings, as this is a much more wholesome shortening than lard.

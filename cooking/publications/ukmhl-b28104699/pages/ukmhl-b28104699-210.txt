Put into cans and seal. Keep in a cool, dark place. Take care to have the cans well sterilized and rubbers new, and the tomatoes will keep well. Preserves are made the same as canned fruit in the main, allowing more sugar to the pound. Either one-half pound sugar to a pound of fruit, or pound for pound. The latter, however, makes exceedingly rich preserves, or marmalade, and these should be used sparing- ly, as the excess of sugar in them is apt to upset the stomach and liver. Canned Strawberries.—Take one pound of picked, washed strawberries (dark ones are best), put six tablespoonfuls of water in a saucepan; when it boils put the berries in and immediately put one-quarter pound of pure granulated sugar on the top of the berries. Let them boil eight minutes, put them in a pint jar, close well, and be sure to turn or to invert the jar every two minutes until the berries do not rise to the top of the jar. This changes the po- sition of the berries and allows them to absorb the liquid, which perserves th^ir taste, size and color,

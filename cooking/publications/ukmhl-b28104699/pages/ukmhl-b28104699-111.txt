THE PHYSICAL CULTURE COOK BOOK. 107 minutes and garnish with watercress. Serve with bread sauce and gravy. 21. Roast Venison.—Take a leg of well-kept venison, wipe thoroughly, rub a little salt over it, dredge with flour. Place it in dripping pan with ragged piece you have cut off, and a little water. Put small bits of butter here and there over meat, set in oven and baste frequently until done. Serve with currant jelly. 22. Roast Rabbits.—Skin and clean with great care, and wash a pair of fat rabbits (or hares), stuff with a force-meat of crumbs seasoned with butter, onion, thyme, pepper and salt. Sew up with fine thread, bind the legs to the body in a kneeling posture, and place in dripping pan. Pour over them one cupful boiling water, and invert another pan over them to keep them in. Baste with butter twice, with their own gravy twice, and twice again with butter. Just before you take them up dredge with flour and give a final baste with butter. Dish when threads have been cut and drawn out. Thicken and season the gravy.

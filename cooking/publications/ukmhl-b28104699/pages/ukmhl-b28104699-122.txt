ii8 the physical culture cook book. 7. Cheese Omelet.—Proceed as for plain omelet, only add one tablespoonful grated cheese. 8. Apple Omelet.—Stew apples as for apple sauce. Beat well with one tablespoonful but- ter, sugar to sweeten and a little cinnamon. When perfectly cold add five eggs, beaten well. Bake until brown. Eat warm, for tea, with whole-wheat bread. Grated raw apples are preferable to stewed. 9. Baked Eggs.—Thicken one scant pint milk with one and a half tablespoonful butter blended with one and a half tablespoonfuls flour and add a few drops onion juice; cut ten hard-boiled eggs in halves and arrange in a baking dish in layers, grating cheese lightly over each layer and seasoning with salt. Pour over the sauce, cover slightly with bread crumbs and brown in the oven. 10. Devilled or Stuffed Eggs.—Boil five eggs hard and put in cold water a moment to cool; cut in halves and remove the yolks; mix the yolks with one tablespoonful olive oil; salt, to taste, and a little vinegar. Fill the whites with the mixture and serve on lettuce leaves; finely chopped ham or tongue may be added if desired.

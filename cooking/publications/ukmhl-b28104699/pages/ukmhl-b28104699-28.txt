While the nature of some few dishes requires that they cook quickly, many foods are improved in nutritive value and in flavor by long, slow cooking, i.e., at a low temperature. Rapid boiling renders many things indigest- ible, unpalatable and unfit for the stomach; whereas, if cooked properly they would be quite wholesome.

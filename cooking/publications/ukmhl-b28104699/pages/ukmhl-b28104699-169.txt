THE PHYSICAL CULTURE COOK BOOK. 165 Make meringue of whites of eggs and three tablespoonfuls sugar, spread over pudding, and brown. Serve cold with cream. CUSTARDS, BLANC-MANGES, JELLIES, ETC. 47. Baked Custard.—Beat five eggs, five ta- blespoonfuls sugar, one quart milk, one-half t'easpoonful vanilla, and bake in a moderate oven until firm. If desired, pour the custard into cups, set in a pan of water and bake twenty minutes. 48. “Floating Island.”—One quart milk, five eggs, pinch of salt, four tablespoonfuls gran- ulated sugar, one-half teaspoonful vanilla. Put the milk in a double boiler to heat. Beat the yolks of the eggs and add the sugar. When the milk is scalding hot, stir it slowly into the eggs and sugar. (This prevents curdling, which is hard to avoid if the eggs are poured into the milk.) Pour back into the double boiler, and stir until it thickens. Then add vanilla and set aside to cool. Just before serving, beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth with two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, and drop on the custard in little “islands.” The addition of a little ring of cur- rant jelly to the top of each “island” is an im- provement' in both the appearance and taste of the pudding.

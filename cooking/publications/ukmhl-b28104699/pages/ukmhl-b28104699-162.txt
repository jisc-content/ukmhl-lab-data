158 THE PHYSICAL CULTURE COOK BOOK. 24. Raisin or Berry Puff.—Mix thoroughly (by several siftings) one pint of flour, one-half level teaspoonful of salt and two teaspoonfuls of baking powder; stir in one scant half pint of milk and one cupful of seeded raisins or berries. (It is easier to put the raisins in the flour before adding milk.) Steam for fifty minutes in cups. Serve with foamy sauce. 25. Huckleberry Pudding (Good).—Make a batter of one-half pint sweet milk, one pint flour, three pints berries, two teaspoonfuls bak- ing powder, two eggs, a little salt. Boil four hours and serve with hard sauce. 26. Fruit Pudding.—Mix one pint of flour into a rather thin batter, with rich cream; add salt to taste, add one gill of melted butter. Beat six eggs separately, very light; stir these in thoroughly and then add one quart of very nice, ripe berries. Pour into a well-buttered pan, and bake. Eat with hard sauce. 27. Strawberry Shortcake.—Make a rich bis- cuit dough (see Biscuits), and bake in dripping or round pan fifteen minutes. When done, split open, butter, spread each half with ber- ries, and sprinkle with sugar. Peach, orange, apple or rhubarb may be used instead of berries.

l8o THE PHYSICAL CULTURE COOK BOOK. PIES. Pies are fortunately less used for desserts than formerly. Although it is possible to make a comparatively harmless crust by avoid- ing much animal fat and taking care in mix- ing, etc., pies as a rule are rather to be avoided. Use, if possible, cream or a good vegetable oil for shortening. Make the filling for pies as simple as possible. Apple, or other fruit pies are best. Mince pie, containing as it often does meat, fruit, raisins, suet, etc., is rather a whole meal than an appropriate finish to a hearty dinner. The recipe for a simple mince pie is given, but is not recommended as a very whole- some dessert. I. Cream Crust (No. i).â€”A simple and di- gestible crust is made as follows: Mix and sift one and a half teacupfuls of white flour with one and a half teacupfuls of Graham or whole-wheat' flour. Moisten with one scant teacupful sweet cream, making a stitfi dough. Roll not quite so thin as for white crust. For a fruit pie, brush over the bottom crust with white of egg to keep the juice from soaking in.

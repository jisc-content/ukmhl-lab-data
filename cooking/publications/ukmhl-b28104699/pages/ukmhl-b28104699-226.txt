2 22 the physical CULTURE COOK BOOK. 21. Stewed Prunes.—Buy box prunes, as they are of better quality than the open sort. Soak for an hour in cold water, put in a porce- lain-lined saucepan and add a little sugar. Let them stew an hour or more slowly, or until they are soft. These are very good in small- pox, measles, scarlet fever, and the like, not only as food, but as medicine also. 22. Graham Bread for Invalids.—One pint Graham flour, one pint flour, one teaspoonful of sugar, one of salt, two of baking powder. Sift all well together, rejecting coarse bran left in sieve. Add one and one-half pints milk. Mix quickly into smooth, soft dough. Bake in two small greased tins twenty-five minutes. Pro- tect with paper ten minutes. 23. Junket.—Sweeten to taste one quart fresh milk, stir in one tablespoonful liquid ren- net, and pour into glass dish. Set near the stove where it will get warm, and as soon as it begins to thicken, set on ice. Serve with pre- serves and cream.

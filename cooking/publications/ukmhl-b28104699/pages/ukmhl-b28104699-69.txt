THE PHYSICAL CULTURE COOK BOOK. 65 crumbs, one beaten egg, seasoning to taste, and the juice of half a lemon. Melt one table- spoonful and a half of butter, add one table- spoonful and a half of flour, and pour on grad- ually one-third cupful of sweet milk. Let cook until smooth and thick, and add to the lentil mixture. Set aside to cool. Then form into small cutlets, dip in beaten egg, then in pow- dered cracker crumbs and fry to a golden brown. Drain, and serve with tomato sauce. Peas may be used for this dish. 63. Canned Peas.—Open the can and pour the contents into a cullender. Drain off the juice, and set the cullender in fresh cold water. Drain, and put the peas in a saucepan, with a little boiling water, to heat thoroughly. Sea- son with butter, and salt. 64.

THE PHYSICAL CULTURE COOK BOOK. 211 through a yard square of cheesecloth and measure juice. Allow one pound sugar to one pint juice Put the juice into kettle and boil twenty minutes. While the juice is boil- ing set the sugar in a cool oven to dry, about ten minutes. Put sugar into juice; let come to a boil, and out into glasses. Grape Jelly.—Wash grapes in a kettle and cook until done. Strain through a sieve, but do not press through. Boil juice five minutes. Add sugar, allowing pint for pound, and boil three minutes more. Put into glasses. Quince Jelly.—Take the cores and parings of the quinces, put them in enough cold water to cover them, and boil them until they are soft. Squeeze them, and add the juice to the water, and any syrup which may be left from the quince preserve and strain it. To each pint of juice allow a pound of sugar. Spread the sugar in pans, and put it in the oven to heat; it must be watched and stirred to pre- vent burning. Let the juice boil for five min- utes, then pour in the hot sugar, stirring until it is entirely dissolved, and skimming any scum that may rise; there will be very little. Let it come to a boil, then take from the fire and put in jars or glasses. The jelly will be clear, of a good color, and keep well. All

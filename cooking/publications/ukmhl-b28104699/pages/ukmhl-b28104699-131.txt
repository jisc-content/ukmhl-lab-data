CHAPTER XIII. SALADS AND SANDWICHES. Salads should receive more attention than they ordinarily do. They are very wholesome, particularly the simpler ones of lettuce, cress, green vegetables, etc. Especially in hot weather, when the appetite craves light and refreshing food, salads should be used instead of the richer and heavier dishes and sweet pud- dings, etc. Always make sure the vegetables for salads are fresh; wash them carefully and put into cold water until ready to use them. Never put salt or oil on lettuce until just as it is served. In making dressings, do not season too highly, nor use much vinegar, as the flavor of the salad is lost by drenching it in condi- ments.

THE PHYSICAL CULTURE COOK BOOK, 71 In making soup, always put cold water on the ingredients and simmer long and very slowly, to draw out the juices. It is better, too, to make it the day before it is needed, or a least to prepare the stock; let it cool, and take all the grease or fat from the top. Much depends on the seasoning of soup. Onions, carrots, tomatoes, some herbs are nearly always good. Celery is useful, and it is a good plan to save all the tops of the celery used, dry them on the plate warmer or in the oven, and keep in a glass jar, ready for use. 1. Soup Stock (i).—^Cover the bones and ragged ends of a roast of beef, veal or lamb with cold water, and simmer very slowly four or five hours. Then add one onion, a little celery, one carrot scraped and cut into pieces, salt, and cook two hours longer. Let cool, skim off the fat, and keep in a cold place. 2. Soup Stock (2).—Or take two pounds beef and soup bone and put into two and a half quarts cold water, and proceed as above. 3. Vegetable Stock.—Put two onions, two carrots, a little celery, one potato into two quarts of water, and cook slowly three hours.

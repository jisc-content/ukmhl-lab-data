It is far better to avoid pork, though if you must have it the best methods and prepara- tion are as follows: 26. Roast Pork.—Make a plain stuffing and roast twenty minutes to the pound, basting often. Serve with apple sauce. 27. Baked Tenderloin of Pork.—Split four or five large tenderloins and make a stuffing of bread crumbs moistened with one table- spoonful melted butter and seasoned with salt, and a very little thyme, about one- quarter teaspoonful. Put one-half the tender- loins in a baking pan, spread stuffing on each and cover each one with another tenderloin; put in a hot oven, with some bits of suet in the pan; after twenty minutes add a little water. Roast three-quarters of an hour, bast- ing frequently. Thicken the gravy and serve with apple sauce. 28. Boiled Ham.—Soak over night, wash well and boil sowly in plenty of cold water four or five hours, according to size. Leave in the water until cold, then remove skin.

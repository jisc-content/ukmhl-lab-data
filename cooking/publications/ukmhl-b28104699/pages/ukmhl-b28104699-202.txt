198 THE PHYSICAL CULTURE COOK BOOK. 33. Cookies.—Two cups sugar, one cup but- ter, three-fourths cup sweet milk, two eggs, five cups flour, two teaspoonfuls baking pow- der. Roll thin and bake quickly. 34. Soft Cookies.—One heaping cup butter, one and one-half cups sugar, two eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately, three tablespoon- fuls sour milk, one small teaspoonful soda (dissolved) and as little flour as will make them stiflf enough to roll. Sprinkle with sugar and grated nutmeg before cutting, pass over roller, cut and bake a light brown. 35. Fruit Cookies.—Two cupfuls of sugar and one cupful of butter creamed; add yolks of two eggs, and beat hard for five minutes. Add two tablespoonfuls of sour milk, one table- spoonful of cinnamon, one level teaspoonful of cloves, one half teaspoonful of nutmeg and one teaspoonful of soda. When mixed put in two cupfuls of chopped raisins rolled in flour, the beaten whites of the eggs, and enough flour to make a dough stiff enough to roll. The rule for flour in all cookies is as much, or rather as little, as will make a dough that can be rolled out and handled. 36. Grandmother’s Ginger Snaps (No. i)

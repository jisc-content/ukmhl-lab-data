If it cannot possibly be broiled, heat a pan very hot, put in the steak (without any suet or grease) and cook quickly, turning often. Proceed as for a broiled steak. 4. Delmonico Steak.—Have a thick steak cut from the top sirloin or round; heat a pot, put in some suet, then the meat and coat on both sides; then add salt to taste, one onion and one carrot’ chopped fine, and cook slowly three hours, turning often and stirring the vegetables from the bottom to prevent burn- ing; cook, if possible, without water, though if it threatens to burn, a little hot water must be added; when done, take out' the meat, add water and thicken the gravy and pour it and the vegetables over the meat, removing, of course, any bits of suet.

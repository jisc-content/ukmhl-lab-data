THE PHYSICAL CULTURE COOK BOOK. 185 four eggs whipped stiff with half a cup of powdered sugar. Just before putting it in stir lightly into it a cupful of the berries. Set the pie plate containing the meringue in the oven long enough to brown delicately, and eat when perfectly cold. 18. Pumpkin Pie.—Cut a pumpkin in pieces without peeling. Scrape off the inner shreds that hold the seeds. Boil with a pint of water in a porcelain-lined kettle, for five or six hours. To four cups of pumpkin add four cups of milk, one even teaspoonful of salt, one tea- spoonful cinnamon, one teaspoonful of ginger, three eggs well beaten, and one cup of sugar. Beat the custard well and taste it' to see if it is sweet enough. Put this mixture into deep pie plates lined with pastry, and bake for three-quarters of an hour. 19. Custard Pie.—Two eggs, one pint milk, a pinch salt, one-quarter cup sugar. Bake in under crust only in slow oven forty-five min- utes, or until custard is set. 20. Cocoanut Pie.—Same as above, with one-half a grated cocoanut added. The milk must be heated to boiling point and poured over the cocoanut.

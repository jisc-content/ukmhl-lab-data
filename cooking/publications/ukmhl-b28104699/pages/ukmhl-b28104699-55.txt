THE PHYSICAL CULTURE COOK BOOK. SI 6. Scalloped Potatoes.—Butter a baking dish, pare potatoes and slice thin, put in dish a layer of potatoes, and sprinkle with salt; then another layer of potatoes, etc., until dish is nearly full. Then fill with milk. Put bits of butter on top and bake in a quick oven 45 to 50 minutes. 7. Sacked Potatoes.—Select for baking po- tatoes as near of a size as possible. Cut off each end. When baked, scoop out the inside with a spoon, being careful not to break the skins. Add to the potato, butter, salt, and suf- ficient hot milk to make quite soft. Beat till very light and smooth. Fill the skins with this and place on end in a buttered pan on the oven grate till browned on top. The potatoes will puff up considerably if sufficiently beaten. 8. Potatoes Roasted with Beef.—Pare the potatoes and place in the pan with the meat, basting when you do the beef. They Avill be nicely browned and mealy when the meat is done. It is better to place the potatoes on a grating so as not to become saturated with the fat in the bottom of the pan. 9. Potato Croquettes.—Season cold mashed potatoes with salt and pepper and beat to a cream with one t'ablespoonful melted butter

124 THE PHYSICAL CULTURE COOK BOOK. CEREALS. Cereals should be served often for break- fast, and there are so many delicious and wholesome varieties nowadays that there is no excuse for serving the same thing day after day. It is well to have several different grains in the pantry, and to alternate them. The}'’ will keep well if transferred from the original packages to glass jars, which should be labeled for convenience. The directions which are supplied with the different cereals are generally best not fol- lowed. They seldom recommend long enough cooking. The usual fifteen minutes of the re- ceipt must always be lengthened to half an hour, while an hour’s steaming is better still. Do not serve oat-meal in summer, as it is too heating. Cereal served with stewed fruits, dates, etc., make a pleasant change from the beaten track, and are usually relished by children. 27.

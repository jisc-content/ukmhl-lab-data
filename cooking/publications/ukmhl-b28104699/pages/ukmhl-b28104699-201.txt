THE PHYSICAL CULTURE COOK BOOK. 197 31. Ice Cream Cake.—One-half cup butter, one and one-half cups sugar, two cups flour, one-half cup water, whites of five eggs, two level teaspoonfuls baking powder, one-half spoonful vanilla. Beat butter to cream, add sugar and then vanilla; now add milk, the whites of eggs beaten to a stiff froth, finally flour and baking powder. Stir well, bake in shallow pans, well buttered. Bake twenty minutes. Filling.—Put two cups granulated sugar in a stew pan with one-half cup boiling water. Boil gently ten minutes without stirring. Beat whites of two eggs stiff, and pour syrup in, in a slow stream, beating with a Dover beater all the time. Continue two minutes after it is all in. Two persons can do this best. 32. Nut Layer Cake.—One cup sugar, one cup milk, two cups flour, two even teaspoon- fuls baking powder, butter the size of an egg, two eggs, setting the white of one aside for frosting. Mix well. Take out one-third, with which grate enough chocolate to make it dark; flavor with vanilla. Bake in three tins, one of dark dough, two of white. Filling.—Whip one-half pint cream, add one cup powdered sugar and one cup walnuts chopped fine. Figs or dates are nice with the cream instead of nuts.

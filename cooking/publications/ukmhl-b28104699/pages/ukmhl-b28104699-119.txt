THE PHYSICAL CULTURE COOK BOOK. I15 first meal of the day. Far too often, in Amer- ica especially, breakfast is made an elaborate, hearty meal, clogging and overworking the system. It should consist, instead, of light and easily digested foods, such as fruit', cereals, eggs, whole wheat breads, etc., with little or no meat. However, variety we must have, and the menu for breakfast should be studied as carefully as for any other meal in the day. In winter, it may be slightly heavier than in summer, when fruits, cereals and bread, with perhaps a suitable beverage, would be enough. EGOS. I. Boiled Eggs.—The proper way to cook eggs, especially for invalids or persons of weak digestion, is to keep them in water at 160° to 170° F., rather than at 212°, or boiling, since the white, or albumen, of this egg is rendered much less soluble by this high tem- perature. A simple way of cooking them properly is to let the water boil, then set it back off the stove and drop in the eggs, leav- ing them for four to six minutes. Serve with fruit, toast and chocolate and you will have a perfect breakfast. One can also put the eggs in a vessel and pour the hot water on them.

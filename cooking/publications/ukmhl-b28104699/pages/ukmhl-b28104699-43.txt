39 THE PHYSICAL CULTURE COOK BOOK. 29. Corn Muffins (No. i) (Good).—Two cups Indian meal, oine cup flour, two cups milk, one tablespoonful sugar, two tablespoonfuls melted butter, two teaspoonfuls baking pow- der, three eggs, a pinch salt, beaten separately. Mix meal, milk, yolks of the eggs, sugar, but- ter, add the flour mixed with the baking pow- der, lastly the whites of the eggs. Beat well and bake in hot-greased pans in a hot oven. This makes twelve muffins. 30. Corn Muffins (No. 2) (Good).—Two cups corn-meal, one and one-half cups flour, two and one-half cups sour milk, two eggs beaten separately, one teaspoonful shortening, one teaspoonful salt, one-half cup molasses, one-half teaspoonful baking soda, one tea- spoonful baking powder. Beat well and quickly, put in hot gem pans, and bake one- half to three-quarters of an hour. This quan- tity makes twelve muffins. The soda must be put into the sour milk, of course. Some cooks leave out the baking powder and use more soda, but I like the other way better. These muffins will be found nicer than those made with sweet milk. Buttermilk also may be used. 31. Grandmas Johnny Cake (Delicious).— Pour one quart boiling water over one quart

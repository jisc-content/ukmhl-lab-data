COOKING-STOVES 51 from the old-fashioned open coal range. They were the prototypes of the clock-work bottle-jacks. The next part with which I wish to deal is that of cooking apparatus, stoves or ranges that are heated by means of coal. The success of cooking has a great deal to do with the kind of cooking apparatus used. That success depends largely on the following points:â€” (a) Perfect construction. (b) Perfect draughts and flues. (c) Perfect working. Success depends, further, upon the management of the fire, dampers and flues used, and the skill of the cook as a stoker. Coal cooking-stoves and ranges are constructed of malleable iron, steel, cast iron, and wrought iron. Cast-iron stoves are the cheapest made, but they often crack soon after being used, and are not suitable for hard wear. Such cheap stoves cannot be recommended with confidence, because they usually waste fuel, frequently smoke, and are constantly out of order ; whilst well-constructed stoves from reliable makers, which are air-tight, made from malleable iron, wrought iron, and steel, not only give more evenly and easily regulated heat, but are better in many other respects. Good stoves should not allow gases and fumes to escape from the fire-box into the oven; they should be so constructed as not to allow cinders and soot to get into the oven, and should protect the fire-box and.oven from undue draughts, which make the heat uneven and unreliable both in the oven and on top of the stoves.

This practice as a means of cookery is largely adopted in hotels, clubs, schools, hospitals, prisons, barracks, workhouses, and other large institutions. It is also frequently applied in ordinary household cookery for particular articles of food requiring a very slow process of cooking. The extent of this depends greatly upon the appliances at hand. An ordinary kitchen steamer, fixed to the top of a large saucepan, with a close-fitting lid, is generally all that is required in this direction for simple household cookery on a small scale. If, however, steaming is required on a large scale, one or more large steaming apparatuses are needful to carry out this special process. The articles of food which are to be steamed are prepared in There is probably not an article in the batterie de cuisine more important for gradual, i.e. slow, cooking than a modern steamer. The experienced and economically-minded cook treasures this utensil most highly.

This is done by providing each with its own steam pipe, which is run along the side from top to bottom ; the steam, therefore, does not travel from one to the other.

ADVERTISEMENTS. 714 vcm Oram. DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING. Put a teaspoonful of Van Houten’s Cocoa into the cup, withdraw the spoon, pour on the boiling water, then stir and add the sugar to taste. To make larger quantities, put a teaspoonful for each cup required into a dry jug' which has been previously thoroughly warmed, pour on boiling water, then stir and serve into cups, adding sugar to taste. Most Cocoas require boiling in milk; but with Van Houten’s Cocoa this is not necessary. All that is required is to see that the water is boiling when poured on the Cocoa, as otherwise a perfect cup of Cocoa cannot be made. Adhere to these directions, and the result will be all that can be desired. EASY TO MAKE. EASY TO DIGEST. NUTRITIOUS, DELICIOUS. BEST & GOES FARTHEST.

THE NEW CENTURY COOKERY BOOK 50 The Egyptians and other ancient races used the still interesting and historical kail pot for cooking their food. A similar metal pot was also used for baking bread and pies. It was closed up and buried bodily in burning peat or hot ashes. In the ordinary way the £ kail pot ’ consisted of a large caldron of brass or other metal. The tripod and the caldron are the earliest cooking apparatus mentioned. The former consisted of three rods of iron or hard wood, which were fastened together at the top with an iron hook, serving at the same time to hold the handle of the kettle or caldron. In con- nection with these a kind of frying-pan was also used, which, according to tradition, served for cooking certain delicate cakes and fish. In the days when there were no cooking ranges, and consequently no boilers, caldrons were used for heating water, and also for boiling fine articles of linen or muslin, such as the kerchiefs of the mistress and the babies’ caps and robes. In royal households these caldrons were sometimes of gold or silver, and pompously adorned the great carved dressers of the day, flanked by tall chased silver candlesticks. Frying-pans were gradually evolved from small caldrons or marmites, and the long handles were at first called tails. Boasting before a radiant heat has been known for many centuries. Boasting spits were in general use in England during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Spits were then, as now, used for supporting joints and birds before the fire. These spits were at first turned by hand ; but for a long time after in large kitchens dogs, known as ‘ turnspits,’ were specially trained to do the duty of turning the spit. The breed of these useful dogs has long since become extinct. The smoke-jacks, which are still found in the kitchens of some old mansions, were next introduced. These were turned by means of the smoke A BROCHE SPIT, TURNED BY A ‘ TURNSPIT DOG 9

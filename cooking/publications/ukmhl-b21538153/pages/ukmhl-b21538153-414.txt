Raised Game Pie.—1^ lb. flour, H gill milk, 6 oz. butter, the yolk of an egg, pepper, salt, cayenne, ana nutmeg, 1 lb. veal, 1 lb. fresh pork, game of all kinds—pigeons, pheasant, grouse, chicken, larks, quails--a little of each; £ lb. ham, liver farce, or foie gras, 1 tablespoonful chopped mushrooms, 1 tablespoonful chopped truffles, 1 teaspoonful chopped parsley and pistachios, \ pint good stock, chopped aspic. Make a paste of the flour, mixing the butter and milk into it hot, add the yolk of egg, a little salt; mix and knead well. Line a raised pie-tin with this paste about a quarter of an inch thick. Mince the veal and pork together ; season with salt, pepper, cayenne, and nut- meg ; place this mince all round the mould inside the paste ; fill in the centre with fillets of pigeon, pheasant, grouse, chicken, strips of ham, and the larks and quails stuffed with liver farce; sprinkle over the chopped mushrooms, truffles, pistachios, and parsley a little pepper and salt; cover over with some of the mince; wet the paste round and lay on the top cover, close it well round the edge, trim it, and work up the trimmings of paste to make an ornament for the top. Tie a band of buttered paper round the mould about three inches above the top, and bake in a steady oven for three hours. When the pie is nearly cold move the top ornament of paste, and pour in about half a pint of good stock—not too liquid, or it will soak through the paste—replace the ornament, and when quite cold dish up the pie, garnished with chopped aspic.

A lign Hies in Aspic (Eels in Savoury Jelly).â€”1 eel about 2 lb. in weight, gill vinegar, % lemon, 1 small bunch herbs (bouquet garni), 2 slices of onion, 1 hard-boiled egg, 1 pint aspic jelly, 1 raw egg, a few picked shrimps. Clean the eel, remove the head, take out the bones, sprinkle the inside of the fish with salt, pepper and chopped parsley, and tie up in a muslin bag or thin cloth. Place it in a stewpan with the vinegar, a slice of lemon, herbs, and onion slices, add enough water to cover, and cook till tender. The bones and head should be put in with the fish whilst cooking. It will take from half to three quarters of an hour to boil, according to the thickness of the eel. Take out the fish, let it cool, and remove the cloth. Cut the eel into convenient slices, and put on one side. Reduce the liquor in which the fish was boiled, strain it, and add to it the aspic, whisk lightly the white and shell of an egg, stir this into the aspic &c., let it come to the boil (stirring all the time), allow the stewpan to stand for ten minutes on the side of the stove, then strain through a jelly-bag or cloth. Mask the inside of a plain mould completely with the prepared jelly, decorate the bottom and sides neatly with slices of hard-boiled eggs and shrimps. When hot put in the slices of eel, with a layer of jelly between the layers of fish and eggs. Fill up the mould with some more jelly. Allow the contents of the mould to set. When quite firm turn out on to a cold dish, garnish to taste, and send to table. In filling the mould great care must be taken to allow each layer of fish and jelly to set before a second layer is put in. Aspic of lobster, prawn, or fillets of soles is prepared in exactly the same manner. '

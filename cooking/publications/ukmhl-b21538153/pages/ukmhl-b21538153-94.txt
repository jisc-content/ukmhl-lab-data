90 THE NEW CENTURY COOKERY BOOK be classified under the last heading, cosmopolitan or mixed soups. The number of these preparations is both large and varied, the Bouillabaise, Bortsch, Okra, Faubonne, Fermiere, Gumbo, Gnocquis, and other foreign soups, also the national soups, such as hotch-potch, Scotch broth, cock-a-leekie, &c., are included in this list. Sick-room Soups.—There are also a number of soup prepara- tions such as beef tea, frog broth, beef-juice, chicken and veal tea, oat and barley broth, which come under the heading of soups. These apply specially to sick-room cookery, and invalid diet. Service of Soups. —Two or more soups are served for large dinners or elaborate banquets, in which case clear soup is served first. The tendencies of modern dinner-parties being to shorten the service, only one soup is served, unless the dinner is for a large number, when occasionally the choice of two soups is given, viz. a clear and a thick soup. A light clear soup, nicely flavoured and prettily garnished, is far more appreciated, or more often selected, than thick soup when two soups are given ; though thick soups are also very popular, and should not on any account be discarded. In selecting the soups for a dinner every care should be taken so that the composition is not repeated in any other dish served for the same dinner.

It consists of flour fried in butter to a desired colour or blend. -There-are three kinds—the white, the blond or fawn, and the brown. The white roux is made with, say, five ounces of butter and four ounces of flour. Melt the butter, sift the flour and stir into the butter. Cook slowly on the side of the stove for about ten minutes, without allowing it to take colour. Blond roux is made in' the same way, but is stirred over a slow fire until it becomes of a fawn or blond colour. White and blond roux are used for veloutee and Allemande sauces, the former for Bechamel and other white sauces. For a brown roux, leave it on the fire, or put in a moderately heated oven, until it attains a light brown or chestnut colour. Roux should at all times be allowed to cool a few minutes before the moistening is added. It need not be used immediately, for it will keep some time if put in a covered jar and kept in a dry place. The proportion of moisture used is one quart of liquid to four ounces of flour. 10. A Mirepoix.—A mirepoix is the foundation for flavouring sauces, braised meats, and a number of thick soups.

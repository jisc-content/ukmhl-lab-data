Fat for Buttering Moulds, &c.—Chop rather finely a pound of kidney suet, freed from skin, put it into a saucepan with about a gill of cold water and cook over a slow fire till quite clarified ; stir occasionally to prevent burning. Strain, and add one pound of fresh butter to the clarified fat. Stir over the fire till the substance has become quite clear. Fat thus prepared will be found far more satisfactory and more serviceable than melted butter, which is generally used for ^he purpose of greasing or buttering moulds. 19. To Fnmould.—Have a basin of lukewarm water (about 115° to 120° Fahr.), dip in the mould quickly for a second or two; remove it quickly, hold securely, give it a brisk shake, and turn on to a cold dish. Remove the mould as soon as the contents become detached.

THE MANAGEMENT AND CARE OF STOVES by the addition of a bottom plate, and as no flue is required, no opening is left at the top of the oven. The electric wires are imbedded in an insulating enamel to the surface to be heated, and the heat is produced solely by the passage of electricity. Switches are used to control the current, which can be sent through any part of the oven wherever heat is required. Thus the top, the bottom, sides or back of the oven may be heated independently of each other, or the whole may be turned on at once. To heat up the oven in the first instance, it is usual to turn on full power for, say, 15 minutes, and when cooking temperature is reached, the whole of the switches may be turned off, and cooking carried on for some considerable time without any electricity whatever. If, however, the temperature is required to be A KITCHEN FITTED DP WITH ELECTRIC COOKING-STOVES, MANUFACTURED MESSRS. CROMPTON AND CO., CHELMSFORD kept constant, the turning on of one heating surface, such as the bottom plate, will be all that is necessary. There is no combustion whatever, and therefore no products of combustion inside the oven. It is found that, on account of the even temperature, cooking may be carried on in any part of the oven with equal facility, and burning does not take place. Electrically heated grills are also constructed, while stewpans and frying-pans are provided with double bottoms, between which the conducting wires are placed. By merely connect- ing these utensils with the electric current, they can be heated ; and they can be placed in almost any place, quite independently of any stoves.

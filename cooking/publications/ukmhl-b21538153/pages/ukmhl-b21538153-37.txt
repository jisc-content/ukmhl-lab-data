MARKETING 33 When pork is salted and cured, it is called bacon. The head of pork, called pig’s cheek, is one of the cheapest parts ; it is sometimes roasted, but is mostly salted and boiled. Collared head and brawn are made from pig’s cheek. GUIDE FOE OEDEEING BACON a. Fore hock (fore end), weight about 9 lb. b. Thick streaky (prime piece), weight about 6 1b. c. Thin streaky, weight about 4 lb. d. Flank, weight about 3 lb. e. Cushion (gammon), weight about 9 lb. p. Corner of gammon, weight about 4 lb. g. Loin, weight about 8 lb. h. Back and ribs (prime cut), weight about 9 lb. i. Collar (prime part and end) weight about 7 lb. Bacon.—Like pork, good bacon should have a thin rind ; the fat must be firm and of a good colour. The best bacon, if mild cured, is of a pale colour, and the meat adheres firmly to the bones. There should be no so-called yellow streaks in it. To ascertain the good quality of a ham or gammon of bacon, insert a. steel skewer or a knife ; if it comes out clean, and no disagreeable smell is detected, it is a sign of good quality; but if some particles of meat cling to the skewer or knife when withdrawn, and the smell is unpleasant, it is certain that the curing is at fault, or the article is of inferior quality. A short and thick ham is always accepted as the best. POULTEY OE GAME Fresh Poultry is known by the following signs : the feet are soft or moist, the eyes are clear, and there is no bluish or greenish tint round the veins. Fowls, when young, should have smooth legs and combs ; when old the reverse will be observed. Surrey fowls and Surrey chickens are acknowledged to be the best. The cock bird is young when it has a smooth leg and short spurs ; hens when young have smooth legs ; the breast bone should be soft and pliable. Black-legged fowls are best used for roasting, whilst white-legged fowls are best for boiling. D

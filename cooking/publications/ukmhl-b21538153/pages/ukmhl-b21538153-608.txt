THE NEW CENTURY COOKERY BOOK 604 Wash the butter in iced water, knead it in a wet cloth, and shape into a flat square. Roll out the paste into a square about twice the size of the butter; the sides of the paste should be rolled somewhat thinner than the centre. Put the butter in the centre of the paste, fold in the four sides, so as to completely envelop the butter. Roll out very gently and in one direction only, and fold in three; this is called the first turn. Keep the paste in a cool place and repeat rolling and folding it as before three or four times, allowing the paste to cool for at least ten minutes between the turns. The paste is then ready for use. 1945.

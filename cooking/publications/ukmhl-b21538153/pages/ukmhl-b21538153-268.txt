2C4 THE NEW CENTURY COOKERY BOOK CHAPTER XIX ENTREES GEAUDES DE VIANDES {HOT MEAT DISHES) For cold service see Chapter XXII The meaning or application of the term ‘ entree ’ has undergone con- siderable changes and modification during the last ten years, not only in this country, but alike on the continents of Europe and America. The correct meaning of the word is often confused with that of ‘ entremet'—no doubt this is because the difference of these two names is not clearly understood by many. Again one will find a remove, releve, or even a hors d’ceuvre (side dish) served under the heading of ‘ entree.’ This I also attribute to the same cause, the want of better knowledge. There are certain laws, culinary and gastronomic rules, most of which are as yet unwritten, and I may say, unexplained, but nevertheless well understood by first-rate chefs and gourmands, which govern the culinary operations, the preparation, style of get-up (dressing), and the mode of serving those dishes known as ‘ entrees.’ It is not too much to say that on the entree or entrees of a well balanced dinner hangs the whole ordering of the entire arrange- ment. It is a matter of the greatest importance, which has been thought out with the greatest care, not only by clever chefs, but by gourmets and epicures alike, whereby the most refined artistic tastes are blended with the utmost.effect. However this may be, there still exists a number of cooks—simple and uneducated cooks—who bestow but little thought on this important branch of the profession, and forget that in preparing an entree, like almost everything else in cookery, it is quite as necessary, if not more so, to please the eye as to charm the palate, and this negligence frequently causes a dish which in other respects is well cooked to be viewed with disfavour: it lacks in proper dressing and its appropriate garnish, which more often than not forms the characteristic of entrees, whereby its merits are ignored. The lady of the house or the housekeeper, who generally study every detail of a menu before it is passed, should make it a special point that the entrees as well as the rest of a dinner are correctly prepared and suitably garnished, and where the cook is given (as he or she should have) a free hand as far as the culinary preparations are concerned, he or she should see that an entree is sent to table as perfect and as correct in garnish or decoration as it can possibly be. If this is done there can be but little doubt as to its

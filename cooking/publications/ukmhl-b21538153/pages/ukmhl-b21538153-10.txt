6 THE NEW CENTURY COOKERY BOOK to compile a bill of fare correctly, and enable them to supersede the French names (often ridiculously spelt) by intelligible English ones, where such a course is preferred. The vocabulary of terms used in Cookery contains over three thousand words and phrases used hi the art. These are translated and explained, and details of the origin and history of the more interesting are also given. With a view to rendering this work as complete as possible, a series of some two hundred Specimen Menus has been inserted in English, French, and other languages. These include examples of fixed price luncheons, dinners, &c., such as are served in London Clubs, Hotels, and Restaurants. A few classical Menus which will interest students of history, have also been added to this collection. A list of quotations from the works of standard authors useful in the compilation of menus for special occasions brings this section to a close. In brief, the object of this book is to present to the reader an Oracle of Gastronomy, a culinary guide for every-day reference ; a vocabulary of English and foreign terms used in cookery, as wrell as a collection of epigrams and quotations bearing on the art; and a few historical sketches relating to it. I therefore trust that it will prove a help to advocates of the School of French Cookery, a gastronomic treat to the gourmet, a valuable book of reference for hotel proprietors, managers, and chefs, as well as for' ladies who manage their own establishments.

ON COOKING TEMPERATURES 59 Failure in the kitchen can often be traced to the want of knowledge of the culinary temperatures needed. ‘ Cooking Thermometers ’ have been found useful; for with their help beginners are better able to estimate the varying and correct temperatures needed for each process.

For fish the fat should be from 360 to 375 degrees, according to the kind and size fish to be fried. For meat, from 370 to 380 degrees. For fritters &c., 340 to 375 degrees.

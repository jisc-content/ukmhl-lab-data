THE NEW CENTURY COOKERY BOOK 122 purposes ; if required for other purposes, 2 ounces of gelatine will be found sufficient for the desired consistency. 39. Socle of Rice for Cold Entrees, &c.—Wash some Carolina rice in several waters, put in a well-tinned stewpan, with about three times its quantity of cold water, heat up slowly and bring to the boil, then cook at the side of the stove or in the oven gradu- ally until the rice is done ; the liquid should by this time be almost absorbed in the rice. Pound it in a mortar while warm, until it has the appearance of a smooth paste. Add a little salt to flavour, and press into a wetted mould. Set the mould in the ice for 2 to 3 hours. To unmould it immerse the mould in hot water, turn out and carve the side with a sharp knife to give it a more artistic appearance. Dress and use as foundation of cold dishes as required. 40. Spun Sugar.—Weigh half a pound of best cane sugar and put it in a clean copper sugar-boiler (pan), add a gill of water and allow it to dissolve. Bring it to the boil, remove the scum and con- tinue to boil till it registers 280 degrees on Senn’s Saccharometer: this is called the small crack or hard feather. Now take a fork or spoon and throw it lightly on an oiled rolling-pin or oiled handle of a large wooden spoon. Move the fork or spoon to and fro ; the sugar will then form the desired threads.

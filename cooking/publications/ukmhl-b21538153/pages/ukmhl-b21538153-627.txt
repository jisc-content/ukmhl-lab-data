PATISSERIE, ETC. 623 (copper) with enough syrup to cover ; add a vanilla-pod, and simmer very gently till the chestnuts are tender. Put them in a basin and allow them to stand covered till the following day. Reboil them in the syrup the next day. Take them up and drain on a sieve. Meanwhile boil a syrup—one pound of sugar to one gill of water— to the ‘ crack,’ stick a wooden skewer into each chestnut and glace them in the syrup as soon as it is sufficiently cooked, i.e. when on lifting the skimmer out of the syrup and blowing through it the sugar forms a quantity of bubbles at the back of the skimmer; work it with a spoon against the sides of the pan till it is nearly cold, and dip the chestnuts into this separately, with a fork; place them on trays and let them dry. 2029. Pain perdu.—i stale tin-loaf, 1 quart milk, 1 pod of vanilla, 2 eggs, i teaspoonful ground cinnamon, caster sugar, frying- lard or clarified butter.

Beat up two whites and one yolk of eggs, add a pinch of salt, immerse the pieces of bread and fry in hot butter or lard to a light colour, drain on a paper or cloth, sprinkle with caster sugar in which the ground cinnamon has been amalgamated.

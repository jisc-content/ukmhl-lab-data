26 TEE NEW CENTURY COOKERY BOOK 14. Brisket, generally salted and boiled. It is not suitable for either roasting or baking. 15. Neck, or sticking piece (including part of the head), used for soups, stews, and for mincing. 17. The Clod, suitable for stewing, or for soup and stock. 18. The Head, including cheek, for stewing and boiling. The latter is often used for salads. 19. The Hough or Shin (leg), generally used for soup and stock. The fleshy end is sometimes used for stews. Mutton, when in prime condition, is richer in fat than beef. It is of short fibre; but it is less digestible than beef. The meat of a sheep should not be eaten till it is at least three years old. The best English Southdown mutton is obtained from sheep six years old. The flesh of mutton should be rather firmer than that of beef, and of a deep red colour. The fat should be white and firm. Mutton fat contains a large percentage of stearic acid ; it is on this account much firmer than beef fat, and also less digestible. For the same reason fat mutton eaten by persons of feeble digestion often disagrees, and should, therefore, be avoided. Mutton ought to hang for some time to ripen before it is cooked ; but the flesh of lamb can be cooked almost immediately after it is killed. Both mutton and beef should be hung as long as possible without becoming tainted. The flesh of an old animal when pinched remains wrinkled.

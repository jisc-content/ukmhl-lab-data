82 THE NEW CENTURY COOKERY BOOK CHAPTER IX STOCKS AND SOUPS' It is an acknowledged fact that stock forms the essential basis for all meat soups, consommes, most thick soups, sauces, and gravies, and as such it is recognised as being the foundation or, as Francatelli terms it, ‘ the very soul of good cookery ’; this is not altogether an exaggeration, for stock is also largely used for many other culinary prepara- tions. Stock is the liquid, or broth, into which the juices of meat, vegetables, &c., have been ex- tracted by means of low and gentle simmering. Thus the chief object in making stock must be that of drawing the goodness out of the materials employed into the liquid con- tained in the stock-pot. There is a wide range of stocks,2 from the simple homely bone stock to the double stock used for consommes, but the most useful is what cooks term the ‘ general stock,’ which will serve not only for soups and sauces, but also for a vast number of other culinary preparations for which water is often used merely because there is no stock at hand. Every household kitchen wherein it is desired to attain some degree of perfection, as well as of econoiny, should keep a constant supply of good stock. Unfortunately many ignorant or over-careful cooks, as well as housewives, look upon the stock-pot as a sort of culinary rubbish bin, where everything which cannot be made use of finds its way. On the Constituent Parts of Stock.—The nutritive and flavour- ing qualities of a properly prepared stock of first quality are: albumen, gelatine, osmazome, fat, and alkaline salts. 1 For individual recipes see Chapter XIV. 2 There are four kinds of stock principally used in cooking : - 1. Meat stock. 2. Game stock. 3. Fish stock i These are called maigre, because no meat is used in 4. Vegetable stock ) their preparation.

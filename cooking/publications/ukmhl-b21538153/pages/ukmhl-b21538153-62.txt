58 THE NEW CENTURY COOKERY BOOK CHAPTER VI ON COOKING TEMPERATURES The chief factor in cooking is heat, the laws of which are even now not completely under- stood in the scientific world. It is a most difficult study, and the average cook may be pardoned if showing ignorance on the subject; nevertheless, a certain amount of theoretical knowledge is necessary to all who wish to advance in their profession and show a uniform excellence in their work. We know that the action of heat on foods is partly chemical and partly mechanical, and is manifested in a great variety of ways. This should teach us that mere happy-go- lucky methods will not be sufficient. Study and the observance of well-established rules (modified according to circumstances) are necessary.

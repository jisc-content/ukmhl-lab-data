CULINARY REQUISITES 67 possible, but can be modified or enlarged upon according to circum- stances. The list is not in excess for a small kitchen well equipped for two- persons ; but it is insufficient to provide cooking for ten or twelve persons. It will not be out of place to mention here that copper utensils in use should be frequently examined, so that they may be retinned immediately when needed. It is of the greatest importance to health that every copper or iron cooking-vessel be kept in good condition. Besides attending to the tinning, all utensils must be kept scrupulously cleanâ€”they cannot, in fact, be kept too clean. They must be washed and scoured with fine sand, and well rinsed in water each time they are used. All copper and tin ware should be kept bright and polished. This should be the pride of every cook. In conclusion it will be necessary to remind the reader that it is false economy to purchase cheap cooking-utensils, for the best will be found the cheapest in the end.

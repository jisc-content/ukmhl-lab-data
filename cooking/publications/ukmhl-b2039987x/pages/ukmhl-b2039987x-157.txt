153 Make the pastry first as follows :—Rub the butter thoroughly into the flour, add the salt and yolk of egg, and make into a firm paste with the cold water. Roll out the paste thmly, and line some small patty pans with it; lay in each patty pan a greased paper, and fill up with rice ; bake them in a moderately hot oven ; when done, remove the rice and paper, and brush over the edges of each little case w^ith egg, and return them to the oven to glaze. Pound together the veal and ham, the butter (melted), and the white sauce, season the mixture rather highly, and pass all through a sieve. When the cases are cold, pile up the meat mixture to a pyramid shape, smoothing it over with a knife. Stick a small sprig of parsley in each casolette, ornament with cochineal butter, using a paper forcer, and garnish the base of each casolette with chopped aspic. Patties of Cold Meat. Flaky pastry. Cold meat, minced, well seasoned, and moistened with gravy or stock. Line some patty pans with pastry, put in the meat, and cover with a lid of pastry. Decorate the edges, and make a hole in the top. Bake. Chicken Salad. Some cold chicken. Some celery or lettuce. Mayonnaise sauce. For Garnish :— Capers. Anchovies. Hard-boiled eggs. Beetroot. Cut the meat into dice, and mix with it half its bulk of celery, cut into small strips or dice ; pour over a little oil and vinegar, season it, and let it stand until just before serving.

Luncheon and Supper Dishes. — ■ » ■ — For everyday luncheons the remains of former din- ners are usually served, and these should be dished up in as tempting a manner as possible. If a joint is still presentable, it should be sent in gar- nished with fresh parsley, but if very little is left upon it, it is better to cut off the meat in as neat slices as possible, and to arrange these round a centre of salad, or to garnish them with a few slices of tomato, or with sprigs of parsley. A clever cook will be able to make a nice-looking luncheon out of what would, at first sight, appear very unpromising materials. A few dishes are here given, but others will be found under the headings of Breakfast Dishes, Cold Meat Cookery, and Simple Entrees. Jellies and creams, suitable for luncheons or for sup- pers, will be found in another part of the book. Game Pie. Hare i. Pheasant or fowl i. Strong' well-flavoured stock i pint.

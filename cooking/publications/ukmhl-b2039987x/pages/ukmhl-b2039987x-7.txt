PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION. E have much pleasure in issuing" a second edition of Home Cookery. Several recipes have been added, and others have been revised with the object of increasing the usefulness of the book. We do not pretend to offer a complete Guide to Cookery, but a collection of methods, hints, and recipes, the result of many years' experience. The days are happily past in which ignorance of household matters was commonly held a mark of good breeding-, and no woman can now be considered to be thoroughly educated who does not know something* about the management of a home. The foundation of home- comfort may be said to lie in the kitchen ; and the state of the kitchen in the majority of households depends upon the personal supervision and influence of the mistress. Many of the following recipes have been drawn up by Miss Morton, the well-known Head Teacher of the North Midland School of Cookery, while for others we are indebted to the kindness of Mrs. A. B, Marshall (of Marshall's School of Cookery, London), and to other sources.

49 Fried Parsley is often served with fried fish. It must be thoroughly dry, and the fat for frying it must be made much hotter after the fish has been taken out. When the parsley is plunged into the hot fat there will be a violent hissing-, rather alarming to a beginner. The parsley must only be fried for one minute, until quite crisp, but not burned. Fried Soles. Medium sized soles are the best for frying, very large ones are better served au grathi (p. 53), or boiled. The dark skin on the back is removed and the fins are cut off, but if the sole is to be fried whole the head is retained. Soles are fried either whole or in fillets. Fillets make a nicer looking dish, but the flavour is better if the fish is fried whole. In frying follow the general directions for frying fish. In filleting a sharp-pointed knife is used. A slit should first be cut across the fish, just above the tail, the skin must be loosened by the fingers and then dragged ofi", care being taken not to tear the flesh. The skin should be removed just after the fish is washed, while it is still quite wet, otherwise it will be very difficult to get it off. Skin the sole on both sides. Make a slit down the backbone of the fish, keep the point of the knife close to the bone and so remove the flesh. Each sole will make four fillets ; if the sole is very large the fillets-may be cut across again. The fillets, before being egged and bread-crumbed, are usually rolled up, or tied in knots. The latter method is preferable as there then is no difficulty about skewers or string*, but the knots must be carefully and neatly made. Filleted soles may be stuffed before they are rolled up. For this use either ordinary veal forcemeat, well seasoned and flavoured with lemon peel, or shrimps or lobster chopped finely and mixed with a little anchovy sauce, cayenne, and cream to moisten. D

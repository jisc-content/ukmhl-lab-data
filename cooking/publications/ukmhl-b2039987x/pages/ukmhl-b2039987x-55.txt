51 Fried Smelts. These are very delicate fish and must be fried quickly in very hot fat. They are egged and bread-crumbed, and are cooked without being opened. Lemon and cayenne are handed with them, and no sauce is needed, as smelts have a very delicate flavour. Fried Haddocks. Fresh haddock is very good if filleted and fried. Suitable sauces areâ€” Shrimp. Anchovy. Maitre d'Hotel. Salmon Steaks. These may be covered with a buttered paper and sauted in butter, or they may be egged and crumbed and fried. They should be served with sliced cucumber or with Tartare sauce. Cod Steaks May be cooked in the oven, or be egg-ed, bread- crumbed, and fried. If they are baked they should be cooked in the same dish in which they are to be served. The dish must be well buttered before the fish is placed in it, and small pieces of butter must be put on the steaks, which should also be sprinkled with salt and cayenne. The dish should be carefully covered, so that the fish may not be dry. An excellent sauce may be made from the juice, etc., that drains from the fish ; this should be poured off just before the fish is done ; it should be thickened, and chopped parsley and a few drops of lemon juice added to it, or it may be flavoured with anchovy. Shrimp, Anchovy, or Maitre d'Hotel sauces may be served with fried cod steaks. Stewed Cod Steaks. Cod steaks 2 one inch thick. Butter Lemon rind ...

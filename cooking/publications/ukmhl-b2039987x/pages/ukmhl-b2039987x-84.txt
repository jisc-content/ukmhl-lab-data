8o Viande a rEnclos. Take one pound of steak and one pound of fresh lean pork, pass it through a mincing- machine four times, then mix with it three ounces of butter (melted), three ounces of anchovies (boned and chopped), a small onion (chopped finely), a pinch of cloves, three eggs (well beaten), seasoning to taste. Form into a roll, using a little flour. Cook in the oven, basting often with milk and two ounces of butter. Time, about one hour in a moderate oven. When possible, cream and milk should be used for basting; the butter can then be omitted. Serve hot or cold. If used hot, a good brown ' gravy should be served over it, adding the milk, etc., from the tin. If cold, glaze the roll, and garnish with aspic. A few truffles or mushrooms may be mixed with the roll if liked. Roast Venison. The best end of the neck of venison, boned and rolled, makes an excellent dish. Venison must be hung for a long time, or it will not be very different from mutton. It should be covered with a thick paste made of flour and water, well basted, and roasted till about half an hour before it is served, when the paste should be removed to allow the meat to brown. Venison is very close-grained, and requires to be roasted rather slowly, and an allowance must be made for the paste that covers it. Allow at least the same time as for mutton. Kidney beans should be served with venison ; also port wine sauce (p. 171), for which stock made from the venison bones should be used. Rice for Curry. Take Patna rice, wash it well, throw it into fast boiling water with salt, let it boil fast with the lid off for about twelve minutes. Strain through a wire sieve, and let the tap run over it for a minute. Dry gradually and well before the fire, stir often with a fork to separate the grains. Use half a pound of rice to one pound of curried meat.

84 Roast Fowl. The best way of roasting is before the fire in a hastener, but the commonest way is really baking in the oven. In either case the fowl must be well basted with butter or good dripping—bacon fat is the best. The time required will be three-quarters of an hour to an hour according to size. A small quantity of brown gravy should be poured into the dish, and the fowl may be garnished either with rolls of bacon or with water- cress. Rolls of bacon are prepared as follows :—The bacon is cut into thin strips, the rind is removed, then they are rolled up tightly and placed upon a skewer, and are cooked in a very few minutes either in front of the fire or in the oven. Bread sauce and brown gravy should be handed in a sauce-tureen, and are in this country the almost invari- able accompaniment of roast fowl. Boiled Fowl. Great care must be taken to keep the fowl as white as possible. To ensure this it should be wrapped in a buttered paper, which must be firmly tied on, and sometimes the breast is rubbed with lemon. The fowl must be put into boiling white stock, or water, and should then be simmered for from three- quarters of an hour to an hour and a half according to size and age. Boiled fowls may be served with a variety of sauces ; the most usual are Bechamel (p. 172), Egg (p. 164), Celery (p. 171), Oyster (p. 161), Mushroom (p. 171), and Parsley (p. 165). The liquor in which fowls have been boiled may be used for such soups as White Soup, Jenny Lind, Celery, Tapioca, Cream, and others of which weak white stock may be the foundation. Boiled tongue, ham, sausages, or rolls of bacon are generally served with boiled fowls. The usual garnishes are the yolk of an egg rubbed through a sieve, slices of lemon, or smalf pieces of beet- root or tomato, or parsley.

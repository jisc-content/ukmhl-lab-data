Poultry, Game, &c. Choosing Fowls. When fowls are young, the end of the breast-bone is formed of gristle or cartilage, and bends easily. When fowls are old, the end of the breast-bone is hard and firm. Pin-feathers shew that the bird is young, whereas spurs on the legs (if long* and hard) indicate age. In young fowls the legs should be smooth and the claws should break easily if turned back. In old fowls the flesh has a purplish tinge, and the skin hard and horny. Game-fowls, and those with dark-coloured legs, are better for roasting than for boiling. White fowls, such as Dorkings, are more suitable for boiling. Capons should be plump and fat, and much larger than ordinary fowls. Drawing- Fowls. Pluck off the feathers and remove all the stumps. Cut a slit in the back of the neck near the body. Loosen the skin all round the neck, and then cut off the neck close to the body, leaving two or three inches of skin to cover the opening. Remove the crop (which is the food-bag of thin skin found in front of the neck), and, with the fingers, loosen the ligaments, etc., found inside the body. Place the fowl on its back. Cut a small opening at the vent, just above the tail. Put two fingers inside, loosen the internal organs, then take hold of the gizzard, which is found under the breast-bone, and remove it and the rest of the inside.

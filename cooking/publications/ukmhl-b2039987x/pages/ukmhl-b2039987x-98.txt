94 Asparagus. Wash, scrape, tie in bundles, and cut of equal length, put into boiling- salted water, and boil (uncovered) till tender, fifteen or twenty minutes. Be careful not to overcook asparagus. Serve on toast, previously dipped in the water in which the asparagus has boiled. Melt about two ounces of butter, and serve separately in a sauce-tureen. Globe Artichokes. Trim off the stalks, thoroughly wash them ; put them into boiling water with salt in it, and cook from one to two hours according to size. Keep the lid of the sauce- pan off. When done the leaves will come out easily. Serve with oiled butter. French Beans. String the beans and shred finely, or, if very young, cook whole.

Put them into a saucepan of cold water (without salt), bring to the boil gently, and cook slowly, with the lid on, till tender but not broken, about two or three hours.

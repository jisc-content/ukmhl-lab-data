Jam, Jelly, &c. In making Jam the following rules should be observed: The fruit must be gathered dry. The fruit must be slowly boiled before adding the sugar, and quickly boiled afterwards. Jam must be carefully stirred with a wooden spoon, and not allowed to burn. It must be put into dry pots, and kept in a dry place. Raspberry or Strawberry Jam. To each pound of fruit allow one pound of white sugar. Put the fruit into a bright pan, let it boil ten minutes. Before the fruit is put on the fire, put the sugar in a tin or old dish, and let it get quite hot in the oven, but do not let it burn or brown. When it is hot add gradually to the fruit; stir well, let it boil ten minutes. Put it into pots. When cold cover with thin paper soaked in vinegar, and tie or twist it down. Plum, Currant, and Gooseberry Jam. These jams are made in the same manner as raspberry and strawberry, but need longer boiling before the sugar is added, about half an hour. Gooseberry jam does not require so much sugar; three-quarters of a pound to one pound of gooseberries is quite sufficient.

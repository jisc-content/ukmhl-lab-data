Melt the butter in the pan ; when it bubbles pour in the mixture, stir well until it sets. Let it brown very slightly. Tilt the pan, and let the omelet slide on to a hot dish, and as it slips off turn one side on to the other, so that it is the shape of a half-moon. In an omelet made according to the above method, the outside is more cooked than the middle, and many persons prefer this ; but there are others who like an omelet that is more thoroughly set, when it may be finished in the following manner :— After the omelet is set, it is scraped to one side of the pan in a half-moon shape, the pan is then tilted, and the omelet is turned over to the opposite side, and is slightly browned. The following are variations of the Plain Omelet:— Sweet Omelet. Add a teaspoonful of castor sugar to the egg mixture, and before serving sift sugar over it. Sweet omelet with preserve is made in the same manner. A spoonful of strawberry or other preserve is warmed and put upon the half of the omelet before it is turned over. A little vanilla or other suitable flavouring may be added to the egg mixture. Savoury Omelet. Chopped parsley i teaspoonful. Chopped shallot or onion J saltspoonful. Pepper and salt to taste. These are beaten into the egg mixture before it is cooked. A small portion of chopped thyme and mar- joram may also be added if liked.

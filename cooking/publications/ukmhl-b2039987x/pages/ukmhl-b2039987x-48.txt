44 Neither herrings nor mackerel can be had in per- fection inland. Fish should be thoroughly cleaned, and the internal organs carefully removed, also all the blood and silver skin ; but fish must not be washed more than is abso- lutely necessary, nor must it ever be left soaking in water. Smelts are cooked without being opened, and the liver, which is considered a delicacy, is left in red mullet. The fins must be cut off, and the tail trimmed. BOILING Fish. This method, although a very usual one, is not to be recommended, as much of the nourishment and flavour of the fish is lost. The fish most commonly boiled are cod, haddock, salmon, turbot, brill and mackerel. Of these, cod (fresh), salmon and haddock should be put into hoiliiig water. Turbot, brill and mackerel should be put into cold water, as their skin is more tender than that of the fish that is put into boiling water. All salt fish should be put into cold water. METHOD OF BOILING FiSH, 1. Allow sufficient water to cover ; add two table- spoonfuls of salt and two tablespoonfuls of vinegar to each gallon of water. 2. Skim well. 3. Keep the lid on the fish-kettle and cook gently ; when the flesh leaves the bone it is cooked sufficiently. No certain time can be given for boiling fish, but the following facts may be some guide. The fish that are put into boiling water should generally simmer six minutes to every pound, and six minutes over. Fish up to about three pounds weight, when put into cold water and brought gradually to boiling point, will be sufficiently cooked by the time they boil. If larger, they must cook longer in proportion. All fish must be served as hot as possible, and must be w^ell drained.

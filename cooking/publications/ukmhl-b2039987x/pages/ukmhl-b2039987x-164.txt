Sauces. A careless or incapable cook never makes good sauces. They are the part of cookery which requires the greatest care and accuracy. All sauces containing flour must be well boiled and well stirred. If they are not well boiled they will not thicken properly, and will taste of raw flour. If they are not well stirred they will be lumpy. Sauces of this kind should not be made a long time before they are wanted, and allowed to stand; if this is done they will be lumpy.

It is, however, the foundation of many sauces, and, as such, should receive more care and attention than generally falls to its lot. The ingredients are usually :â€” Flour f oz. Butter I oz. Water J pint. Salt a pinch. The above quantities are merely average. When a richer sauce is required more butter is used ; also it must be remembered that the thickening properties of flour difl'er greatly, and sometimes a larger quantity may be necessary.

m Simple Entrees, None of the entrees given here are extravagant, nor will they be found difficult to prepare. Many of these can be used as luncheon dishes, or they may sometimes form the main part of a dinner, when, as is often the case, a joint is not required. Petites Soufflees de Merlan. (By kind permission of lA-RS. A. B. Marshall.) Put one and a half ounces of butter in a stewpan with one and a half ounces of fine flour, half a teaspoonful of essence of anchovy, a pinch of salt, a dust of cayenne, and two raw yolks of eg'gs ; mix with one and a half gills of cold milk, and stir altogether over the fire until the mixture boils ; remove from the fire, mix into it a dessertspoonful of cream or milk, and four and a half ounces of pounded or very finely chopped whiting (raw): then mix in carefully three whites of eggs whipped stiffly. Have some little paper cases oiled on the outside and dried in the screen, and partly fill these with the soufflee mixture. Sprinkle on top of each a few browned bread crumbs, put a tiny piece of butter on top of this to keep the soufflees from getting dry, and bake them in a moderate oven about fifteen minutes. This mixture can also be baked in a large case or pie-dish, and is excellent when steamed. The entire quantity baked in one case will require about half an hour to cook. Serve as an entrde or in the fish course, or for a second course dish in place of game or poultry.

96 Stewed Onions. Onions, after being blanched as in the previous recipe, may be stewed in brown stock, about three-quarters of a pint. This should afterwards be thickened with jflour and butter, coloured with a little browning, seasoned, and poured round the onions. Messrs. Sutton & Sons, in their excellent little book on preparing vegetables for the table, recommend that onions, after being slightly trimmed, should be put into a pot with a lump of butter, and keep on the hot plate, or half over the fire, for about a couple of hours. Parsnips. Cook in the same manner as carrots, but in a small quantity of water. Send to table covered with white sauce. Parsnips may be mashed in the same manner as turnips. Green Peas. Shell the peas, put them into boiling salted water, adding one or two teaspoonfuls of sugar and a sprig of mint. Boil uncovered for ten to twenty minutes accord- ing to age. Serve with a piece of butter in the dish. Potatoes. Old potatoes should be chosen of as nearly the same size as possible, or the small ones will be cooked before the large ones. They must be well scrubbed, and may be boiled in their skins, or peeled very thinly. After they are peeled they must be put into cold water, but they should not be allowed to remain soaking in this for more than ten minutes. Have ready a saucepan of boiling water in which there are two tablespoonfuls of salt to one gallon of water. Put in the potatoes, put on the lid, boil gently till nearly done (about fifteen minutes, but the time varies according to the kind of potato). Drain off the water, shake the pot, so as to shake the potatoes into floury balls, let them stand on the stove

86 should be added :—one larg'e onion or two small ones, half a head of celery, a bunch of herbs, also six pepper- corns. Cover the pan closely, and stew very gently for one hour, then add a small teacupful of rice ; stew very gently and closely covered till the fowl and rice are quite tender. More stock may be added if required, but when the dish is ready the rice should have absorbed almost the whole of the stock ; there must not be more stock left than is sufficient to serve on the dish with the rice and fowl. When the fowl is quite done remove the vegetables, and serve it on a dish surrounded by the rice, which must have been previously seasoned with pepper and salt. Old fowls may also be stewed in the preceding- manner (omitting the rice), and may then be served with mushroom or celery sauce. As these sauces are strongly flavoured, they will counteract the tasteless- ness of the fowl. Fried Chicken. This dish is popular in America, and the following recipe was furnished by an American lady. Cut a freshly killed young chicken into joints, wash and dry them carefully, and roll them in flour, in which a little pepper and salt have been mixed. Heat an equal quantity of dripping and butter (about one ounce of each) in a pan, fry the chicken in this, and when it is done, keep it hot, while the sauce is made in the following* manner :— Flour I dessertspoonful. Milk I pint. Pepper and salt to season. Cream (if obtainable) ... 2 tablespoonfuls. Dredge the flour into the pan from which the chicken has been taken, pour in the milk, stir well till it has boiled for two or three minutes, add the cream and season. Arrange the chicken in the centre of a dish, and strain the sauce round it.

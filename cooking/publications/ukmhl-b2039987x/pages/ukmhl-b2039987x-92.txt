88 done put in the sage leaves. Drain, chop, mix with the bread crumbs and season, and put inside the duck. After the duck is stuffed truss it. Twist the legs at the knee joint and cross them over the lower portion of the back. Pass the tail through the vent. Push the legs and wing joints close to the sides, pass the trussing needle and string through the lower portion of the wing, upper part of the leg, through the body, and out at the opposite side, where the other leg and wing must be fastened in the same manner. Turn the duck on its breast, pass the needle through the skin of the neck, which must have been left long enough to cover the opening of the body, fasten the string securely in the place where the trussing was begun. Press the knee joints close to the body, and secure them in the same manner as in trussing fowls for roasting. Roast for three-quarters of an hour to one hour. Baste well. Serve with apple sauce (p. i66) and brown gravy (p. 170), using a sprig of sage instead of the bunch of herbs to flavour the gravy. Roast Goose. This is prepared, stuffed, and cooked in the same manner as duck. The leg's must be cut off at the first joint. The time required will vary according to size. A goose weighing ten pounds in weight will take at least one and a half hours. Serve apple sauce and brown gravy with it. Wild Ducks Are trussed in the same manner with the exception of the feet, which are turned back on each side of the breast, close to the upper part of the legs. Wild ducks are not stuffed, and are served with brown gravy, or port wine sauce. Cut lemons and cayenne are handed with them. They should not be over roasted, twenty minutes or a little longer will be sufficient. To Truss and Roast a Hare. Skin and draw the hare, wipe the inside with a damp cloth, but do not wash it. Cut off the feet at the first joint, and cut across the sinews under the knee joints.

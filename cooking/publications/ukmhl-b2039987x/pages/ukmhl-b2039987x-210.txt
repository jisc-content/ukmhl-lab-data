2o6 Well wash the calves' feet; cut them into pieces and put them into a saucepan, cover with cold water and let them come to the boil, then strain away the water and wash them again. This is done to blanch them. Put the feet again into a clean saucepan, add two quarts of cold water, and let them come to the boil. Skim very care- fully. Add the vegetables, cut into large pieces, the herbs and spices, and simmer all very gently for about five hours ; strain, and let the stock get quite cold. Remove every particle of fat (or the jelly will not be clear) ; wipe over the surface with a hot cloth so that no fat remains ; then clear the stock in the following manner :â€” Lemon (peel and juice) ... i. Tarragon vinegar \ gill. Common ,, \ gill. Chili ,, I tablespoonfuL Whites and shells of 2 eggs. Whisk all these ingredients over the fire when the stock is melted, until it is just at boiling point; then remove the whisk, and let it boil up and simmer five or ten minutes. Draw off the fire and allow it to settle. Strain it through a hot cloth. If meat be used instead of calves' feet, it must be cut into small pieces, and all skin and fat removed. If the stock be not sufficiently stiff", a little gelatine may be used when clearing it. When Aspic is wanted solely for garnish, meat need not be used. The vegetables may be simmered in a quart of water for half an hour to flavour it; then strain, add the vinegars, &c. ; add also two and a half ounces leaf gelatine, and clear in the usual way. Jelly for gar- nish requires to be much stiffer than for ordinary use.

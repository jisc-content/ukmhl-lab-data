Ill Boiled Batter Pudding. Flour 6 oz. Milk I pint. Eg-g-s 3. Salt a pinch. Put the flour and salt into a basin, make a hole in the middle of the flour, break in the eggs, stir in the flour, add the milk gradually. Beat well with a wooden spoon, and let it stand some time before it is cooked. Butter a basin well, pour in the batter, cover with a well floured scalded cloth. Boil one and a half hours. Serve with butter and sugar, treacle, or jam. This pudding may be varied by the addition of apples, rhubarb, gooseberries, or other fruits, which are placed in the basin first, the batter is then poured over ; or a tablespoonful of jam may be placed at the bottom of the basin. Baked Batter, or Yorkshire Pudding-. Flour \ lb. Milk I pint. Eggs 2. Salt a pinch. This is made in the same manner as boiled batter, but is baked in a buttered pie-dish for rather more than half an hour in a quick oven. It is turned out before serving*. Pancakes. The above mixture may also be used for pancakes, but the addition of another egg is desirable. Use about half an ounce of lard for frying each pan- cake. The batter must be put into a jug, and when the lard is quite hot, and a slight blue smoke rises from it, the batter must be poured into the frying pan. Pour in only just enough to cover the bottom of the pan. When the under side is brown, turn or toss the pancake and fry on the other side. Roll up and serve very hot with lemon and sugar.

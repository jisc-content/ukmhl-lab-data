117 and drop in the egg and lemon juice ; mix slowly (using the fingers) into a firm elastic paste with cold water. Work the paste on the board till it is quite smooth and pliable, then roll it out thinly ; place the butter on one- half of the paste, fold the other half over, and press the edges together with the thumb ; set it in a cool place for about a quarter of an hour, roll out to three times its present size, fold exactly in three, turn the open edges towards you, roll again, fold in three, and set aside for another quarter-of-an-hour. Repeat this until the paste has been rolled seven times since adding the butter. The seventh time the paste must be rolled out to the required thickness, and is ready for use. When the weather is cold it can be made without resting between the turns. In cold weather when the butter is very hard, it should be worked with the hands until more pliable, and should be of the same consistency as the paste. Flaky Pastry. Fine flour i lb.

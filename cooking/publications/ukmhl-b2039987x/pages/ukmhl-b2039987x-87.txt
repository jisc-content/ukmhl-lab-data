Thread a trussing needle with string-, and pass it through the wing where the first and second joints unite, then through the upper part of the thigh, straight though the body and out on the other side, catching the thig-h joint and wing in the same manner as at the commencement. Turn the fowl on its breast, fasten the skin of the neck to the backbone, pull the string tightly over it, and fasten it off where it began.

Pluck, draw, and singe the fowl as for roasting. Cut off the legs at the knee joint.

Pass the needle through the skin over the legs, catch in the end of the breast-bone, bring out the needle through the other side, then pass it through the back and fasten off securely.

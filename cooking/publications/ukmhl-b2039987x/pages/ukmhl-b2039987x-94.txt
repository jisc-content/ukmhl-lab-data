90 Roast Rabbit Is trussed and stuffed like hare, but only requires about three-quarters of an hour or an hour to roast, unless it is very large. Bacon should be served with it and brown gravy. It should be well basted. Boiled Rabbit Is trussed in the same manner, except the head, which should be turned round and fastened at the side. The rabbit should be put into boiling water, with salt and a few slices of vegetables and gently boiled for about forty to fifty minutes, or longer if very large. Serve with onion or liver sauce poured over. Bacon should be served with it. Stewed Rabbit, Cut the rabbit into joints, flour them, and fry them in two to three ounces of butter or good dripping a nice brown, with two onions (sliced), add a bunch of herbs (and a few slices of carrot and turnip if liked). Cover with warm stock or water (about one pint). Simmer gently until tender, from one and a half to two hours. Remove the rabbit, thicken the gravy with flour, add a little catsup. Dish the rabbit in a pile, strain over the gravy. Garnish with little rolls of bacon (cooked in the oven on a skewer). The rabbit may also be stewed without frying, and some pickled pork cut into strips cooked with it. Fat bacon can also be used ; it may be cut into dice, fried, then removed, and the rabbit fried in the fat from the bacon and afterwards stewed. Tomatoes (sliced) are also an improvement. Savoury dumplings, made like suet dumplings with the addition of a little chopped onion, herbs (thyme and marjoram), parsley, pepper and salt, are sometimes much liked when cooked with stewed rabbit.

Baking powder must be added dry; it must be carefully rubbed through the hands to avoid lumps. 2. Carbonate of soda must be dissolved in a little lukewarm or sour milk. 3. Currants should be washed, picked over, and well dried. 4. Raisins must be stoned. 5. Sultanas must have the stalks picked off, and all little pieces of grit should be taken out. 6. Candied peel must be sliced thinly. 7. In most cases the whites and yolks of the eggs should be beaten separately. 8. Cakes should be baked as soon as they are mixed. The tins must be thoroughly greased, except for very rich cakes. 9. The oven must be hot enough to make the cake rise, but not hot enough to bake the outside before the inside has risen thoroughly.

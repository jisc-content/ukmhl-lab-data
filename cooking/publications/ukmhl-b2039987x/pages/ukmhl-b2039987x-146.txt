142 Croquettes of Macaroni Cheese. The remains of macaroni cheese. White sauce ... enough to moisten. Grated Parmesan to taste. Egg I. Pepper and salt to taste. Take the cold remains of macaroni cheese, chop small. Mix enough white sauce with the chopped macaroni to moisten it, add grated Parmesan and seasoning to taste, mix in the egg, let it get cold. Make into balls, egg and breadcrumb, and fry. Serve piled high in a dish, with a little grated Parmesan scattered over. Cheese Fingers. Grated cheese 2 oz. Pepper, salt, and cayenne to taste. Puff pastry 1 lb. Roll out half the paste thinly, strew over it nearly all the cheese mixed with the seasoning. Then roll out the remainder of the paste, put it on the cheese, cut into small fingers. Bake in a quick oven ; a few minutes before it is done scatter the remainder of the cheese over the fingers. Serve very hot. Cheese Straws. Flour 3 oz. Butter 2 oz. Cheese (grated) Parmesan is best 2 oz. Cayenne. Salt. Yolk of egg I (to mix it). Rub the butter into the flour carefully as for ''short paste," add the cheese and seasoning. Mix into a firm paste with yolks of egg (milk takes away the shortness). Roll out the pastry, cut into strips about four inches long and a quarter of an inch wide ; also cut out some rounds and remove the inside. Bake in a slow oven until crisp. Place the strips through the rings and serve. If cooked in too hot an oven the flavour of the cheese is entirely spoilt.

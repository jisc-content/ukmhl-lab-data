Pies and Tarts. ^ The main differences between meat pies and fruit tarts are— 1. The crust of a meat pie should be thick, and the crust of a fruit tart should be thin. 2. A hole should be made in the centre of the crust of a meat pie, to let the gases escape, but no hole should be made in the crust of a fruit tart, or the crust will sink into the fruit. In trimming the cover of a pie or tart, the knife must always be held slanting outwards, so as to cut the crust a little larger than the dish. The crust will always shrink a little. Fish Pie. Cod or haddock are suitable for this dish. The fish must be free from skin and bone, well seasoned with cayenne pepper and salt, and placed in a well buttered pie-dish. Over it should be placed a sauce made in the following manner :— Stew the bones and trimmings of the fish in one pint of water till reduced to half a pint. Work three-quarters of an ounce of flour into one ounce of butter, pour on the fish stock, put it into a saucepan and stir over the fire till thickened. Season well. Pour this, or part of it, over the fish, put on a rich crust made of puff paste, or of good flaky paste. The K

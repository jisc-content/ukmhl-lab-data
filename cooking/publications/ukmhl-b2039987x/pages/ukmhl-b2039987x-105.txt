Puddings.-^ In cooking puddings it is well to bear in mind the following rules :â€” Puddings that contain whites of eggs beaten to a stiff froth, and which are therefore more or less of the nature of soufflees, should be baked in a moderate oven and served immediately they are taken out of it. If such puddings are steamed, the basin or tin in which they are cooked should be well buttered, but must on no account be filled, as room must be left for the pudding to rise. They must also be served directly they are turned out. Whites of Eggs^ when wanted for a soufflee, meringue, or to make a pudding light, must be beaten with a knife on a plate in a cold place. The addition of a pinch of salt makes them froth up better. They should be beaten till they are stiff and white, and can be cut with a knife. Great care must be taken that no yolk is mixed with the whites. In baking* Custard Puddings^ or other puddings of that nature, it is well to place the dish in a tin of water in the oven ; this will prevent the curdling of the eggs. The oven must not be too hot. In steaming these puddings the water must simmer, not boil, or the eggs will curdle. Puddings which contain suet must be well and con- tinuously boiled. The pudding basin must be buttered, and quite filled with the pudding mixture ; the pudding cloths should be scalded and floured ; the pudding should be then placed in a pan of boiling water, with enough water to cover the pudding entirely. If the water wastes, more boiling water must be added. The pudding must be kept boiling.

Omelets and Soufflees. There may be almost endless variety in Omelets and Soufflees, but in all cases the following* rules should be observed :— OMELETS. The eggs and butter must be fresh. The omelet pan should be kept very clean and used for omelets only, and must not be too large. The mixture must be put into the pan as soon as the butter bubbles, and before it browns. It must not be allowed to become too brown, nor to stick to the pan. The omelet must be served the moment it is ready. SOUFFLEES. The whites and yolks of the eggs must be beaten separately. The whites must be beaten to a firm froth, w^hich will cut with a knife. To do this the whites must be most carefully separated from the yolks—a small portion of yolk left in will prevent the whites becoming stiff. The whites must be put on to a large plate, a pinch of salt should be added, and they should be beaten up with a clean knife in a cool place. Soufflees are not to be beaten after the whites are added. They must be baked in a steady rather hot oven, the door of which is to be kept shut. If steamed, the water must only simmer. They must be served directly they are cooked.

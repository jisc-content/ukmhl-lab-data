Cold Meat Cookery. In re-cooking meat we must remember that, though it may sometimes need long cooking, it never wants quick cooking ; therefore in making hashes and minces the meat must never boil. Rissoles. Cold meat (finely chopped) ^ lb. , Onion ,, J a small one. Parsley ,, | tablespoonful. Catsup J Jellied stock ^ pint. Butter f oz. Flour J oz. Seasoning. Egg. Bread crumbs. Rissoles are generally very badly made; they are often very hard and uninviting. If properly made they are crisp outside and soft inside, and are excellent if properly flavoured. Melt the butter in a small saucepan, then put in the onion and fry till tender ; stir in the flour and stock, boil 7vell, stirring all the time. Then remove from the fire.

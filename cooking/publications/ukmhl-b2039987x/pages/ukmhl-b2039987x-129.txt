-^-CoLD Sweets.-^ All dishes in which gelatine is used should be made the day before they are wanted. If this is impossible, they should be placed on ice or in cold water to make them set. Less gelatine is required in winter than in summer. We recommend Marshall's gelatine ; it will be found very economical, easy to use, and free from the taste of glue which is sometimes found in common gelatine. The quantities given in the recipes are for medium temperature. CREAMS. In making creams great care should be used in adding the melted gelatine at the right heat; if it is too hot, the cream (if whipped as it usually is) will go down" ; if the gelatine is too cold it will set in hard lumps. The mould in which the cream is placed should be filled with cold water before it is used. In making creams, etc., that require eggs, great care must be used not to let the eggs curdle. The eggs must be constantly stirred while on the fire, and also after the pan is taken off the fire.

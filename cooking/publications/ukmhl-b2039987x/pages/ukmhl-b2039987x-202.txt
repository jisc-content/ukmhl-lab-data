When a day or two old, the cake can be cut into fancy shapes. A little whipped cream, sweetened and flavoured with vanilla, may be inserted in each little shape, and then iced over with Chocolate Icing (p. 200). The cake mixture can also be baked in small tins ; they may be iced with chocolate, and cocoanut sprinkled over. Cream the butter and sugar, add the flour and eggs gradually. Beat well, stir in the nuts (chopped), cherries (cut in halves), brandy, and baking powder. Bake in well buttered fancy moulds, in a moderate oven, for fifteen minutes. Petits Choux aux Abricots. (By kind permission of Mrs. A. B. Marshall.) For the choux paste put half a pint of water into a stewpan with a quarter of a pound of butter and two ounces of castor sugar ; when it boils mix into the pan five ounces of fine flour, stir quickly and mix well, and let the pan stand on the stove ten minutes for the con- tents to cook. Let the mixture cool, and then mix in by degrees three whole eggs and a little vanilla essence. Work the paste well with the egg*, and put it in a forcing bag with a plain tin pipe, and press it out to about the size of a large walnut on to baking tins ; glaze over with egg, and bake for about twenty minutes to half an hour. When cool split in halves, and place in the half of an apricot; close the paste up again and Brazil Cakes. Flour Castor sugar ... Butter Brazil nuts Cherries Eggs... ^ ... ...

^ Fish. It is of the utmost importance that fish should be perfectly fresh. There is more difference between stale fish and fresh fish than between what is stale and fresh in any other kinds of food. Some fish, of course, bears keeping better than others, and red mullet are considered by some people to be improved by being kept for a day or two ; but such fish as herrings, mackerel, smelts, soles and trout cannot be too fresh. There are three ways of telling whether fish is fresh : 1. The eyes should be bright. Distrust all fish from which the eyes have been removed. 2. The gills should be red. Sometimes when the fish is stale the gills are rubbed with blood to make them look fresh. 3. The flesh should be firm, not flabby. The firmness can be partially restored by running cold water over the fish. As deception may be used to make the gills and flesh appear fresh when the fish is stale, it is safest to judge by the eyes, as no one can restore their brightness when once it has been lost. Smelts (or Sparlings) have, when quite fresh, a faint smell that slightly resembles cucumber. Herrings and mackerel, when first caught, have the most beautiful iridescent colouring, and the flesh of perfectly fresh herrings is creamy.

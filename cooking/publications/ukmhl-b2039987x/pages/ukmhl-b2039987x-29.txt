25 Cold Boiled Chicken. Truss and boil a chicken according to directions (p. 83). When it is cold divide it into nice pieces, leaving out the back. Have ready some hot white or bechamel sauce (p. 172), in which a few leaves of Marshall's gelatine have been melted. Coat each piece of chicken thickly with this. When the sauce has set, arrange the pieces of chicken round a small dressed salad, garnish with rolls of ham, slices of lemon, and small pieces of hard- boiled egg. Picnic Rolls (Cold). Cut slices of French roll, remove the crust, and hollow out the rounds (which must not be too large) so as to leave only a thin wall of bread on the outside and bottom; fill with minced chicken, veal, lobster, or salmon, mixed with mayonnaise or bechamel sauce and nicely seasoned. Dish round a dressed salad, and gar- nish with aspic if convenient. Jersey Tomatoes. Tomatoes 4 or 5. Piquant sauce. Salad. Cold roast beef (cut into dice), or chicken.

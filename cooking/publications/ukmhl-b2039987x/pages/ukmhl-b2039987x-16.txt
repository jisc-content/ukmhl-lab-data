12 For the Paste. Flour lbs. Lard 18 oz. Water ... | of a pint. Salt 2 Place the flour in a large basin before the fire. Boil the lard and salt in the water for five minutes. Let it then stand for five minutes off the fire. Add it gradually to the flour, kneading all the time. Knead the paste well in a warm place. Let it stand with a cloth over it before the fire for three-quarters of an hour. Knead again, and it w^ill be ready for use. This paste must be kept warm, or it will be impossible to mould it, but if it be too warm it will not retain its shape. The quantity of paste here given will be sufficient for three moderate sized pies, and five pounds of pork, free from skin and bone, should be allowed to fill them. The bones of the pork must be broken up and put into a pint of cold water with one onion and six pepper corns, this should simmer for four or five hours, so that the gravy, when cold, may be a firm jelly. Before using, this gravy must be strained from the bones and rather highly seasoned with pepper and salt. This may be done the day before the pies are made. The meat (which should be chiefly lean but with some fat) must be cut into dice and seasoned. Five pounds of pork will require one and a half ounces of salt, three- quarters of an ounce of white pepper, and half a salt- spoonful of cayenne. The seasoning should be well mixed, and then scattered over the meat, and be well stirred into it. When the paste is ready for use, three-quarters of a pound may be weighed off to make the lids of the pies. The remainder should be divided into three parts. The paste must not be allowed to become cold. A portion of paste is then taken and moulded with the hands till it is somewhat the shape of a very shallow basin with thick bottom and sides. Now it is ready to be put on the mould. The mould is a solid round block of wood, made for the purpose. Two and sometimes three moulds of different

24 Ox-Cheek Mould. Ox cheek, stewed and cold. Hard-boiled eggs 2 or 3. Chopped parsley. Ham or tongue. Prepare an ox cheek in the following manner :—Care- fully remove all the small splintered bones, wash thoroughly, and let it soak for several hours in salt and water. Wash again, and put it into a large boiling pot, cover with cold water, bring it to the boil, then add :— Large carrots (cut in quarters) 2. Turnips (cut in quarters) 2. Onions 3. Celery ^ head. Parsley, thyme, marjoram a good bunch. . Peppercorns i teaspoonful. Salt 2 teaspoonfuls. Let it simmer very gently till the flesh will leave the bones ; this will be at least four or five hours. Remove the bones and let the cheek become cold, then cut it into slices and stamp out some rounds. Ornament a buttered mould with hard-boiled egg, chopped parsley, and a little ham or tongue (if convenient), also with the rounds already stamped out. Fill in with pieces of the cheek. Take some of the liquor in which the cheek has been stewed, let it boil, add to it a few leaves of Marshall's gelatine, season it highly. Pour this into the mould and fill it up well. Cover the mould, set it in a tin of water, and bake it in a moderate oven for an hour or a little longer. Remove from the oven, fill up the mould with more of the liquor. Turn out when cold, and garnish with parsley. Ox cheek, if prepared as already directed, makes an excellent hot dish. It should be boned and allowed to get cold as if a mould were to be made, and should be w^armed up in a good brown gravy, and garnished with carrotS^ and turnips (boiled separately). The liquor in which the cheek has been stewed makes very good soup, and may be treated in the same way as mock turtle soup.

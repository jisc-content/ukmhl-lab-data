203 Red Currant Jelly. Take red currants, and some white ones (as they improve the colour of the jelly), bake in an earthenware jar till all the juice is extracted, strain, and to each pint of juice add one pound of lump sugar. Stir till it boils, then, when it boils, put in half a cup of cold water. Boil for about twenty minutes, not more, and take off the scum as it rises. Try the jelly from time to time by running' a little on a cold plate to see whether it will set. As soon as it is quite clear and will set, put it into small moulds. If jelly is over-boiled it becomes like treacle, and will never set. Gooseberry Jelly. Gooseberries (gathered when just beginning to turn colour) I gallon. Water 2 quarts. Lump sugar. Boil the gooseberries in the water to a pulp. Strain through a jelly bag. To every pint of juice put one pound of sugar. Boil till it will set and is quite clear. This is a good substitute for red currant jelly. Marmalade. Seville oranges 12. Lemons 2. Slice the fruit finely, and to every pound add three pints of cold water. Let it stand three days. Boil up and simmer till the strips are quite tender. Weigh again, and to each pound of pulp add one pound of white sugar. Boil again for about one hour. Try a little on a plate, and if it sets the marmalade has boiled long enough.

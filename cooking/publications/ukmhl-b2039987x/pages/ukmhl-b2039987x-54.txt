50 Soles may be garnished with slices of lemon, or fried parsley (p. 49). The following sauces are suitable :— Maitre d'Hotel, made from stock from the trimmings of the fish. Shrimp. Anchovy. Plaice May be filleted, fried and served like sole. It cannot of course be compared to sole, its chief merit being cheapness. The male plaice is considered to have the best flavour. Fried Mackerel. Mackerel may be filleted, egged, bread-crumbed and fried. Parsley and butter, Maitre d'Hotel, and Fennel are suitable sauces. Grilled Mackerel. Mix together a tablespoonful of salad oil, small shallot (chopped), a teaspoonful of parsley (chopped), cayenne, and a little salt. Score the mackerel. Let it remain in this seasoning for an hour. Then grill about twelve minutes. Dish up, and serve with Hollandaise sauce (p. 164). The fish can be baked, if preferred. It must then be sprinkled with brown crumbs, and cooked with a buttered paper over. Fried Whiting. Whitings are skinned, the tails put through the eyes. When fried the following sauces may be served with them :— Shrimp. Anchovy. Maitre d'Hotel. Whitebait. Whitebait must be fried in extremely hot fat (four hundred degrees). Wash them and drain them on a sieve some time before they are fried, so that they may be quite dry. Put them into a frying basket with some flour, and shake them well before putting them into the fat. They will be cooked almost immediately. Heap them on a napkin and serve with them lemon, brown bread and butter, and cayenne.

II galantine (page 23), or a veal and ham pie (page 147), or mixed with chicken or veal, as the addition of ham is almost always an improvement to dishes made from white meat. Tongue. A tongue should be in pickle for about three weeks. If the time during which it is in pickle is too short, the tong'ue will not be cured in the middle, and if it is kept in pickle too long it will be hard and too salt. (For recipes for curing hams and tongues see page 204.) When the tongue is taken out of pickle it should be well washed, and put into a pan of cold water. It must be brought to the boil and simmered for several hours, till the tip of the tongue is rather ragged. It must then be taken out of the water, the skin must be removed, and the tongue skewered into the shape of a highly arched foot, and fastened securely on to a board with strong skewers or a large fork. This must be done while the tongue is quite hot, so that as it cools it may stiffen into its proper shape. Before it is sent to table the root must be trimmed, and a paper frill sewn on, not fastened with pins. A tongue may be glazed in the same manner as a ham. Remains of tongue may be used in the same way as remains of ham, or in Tongue Toast. Dry well the tip of a tongue. Grate it. Mix it with one ounce of butter, and cayenne to taste. Spread on buttered toast. Pork Pie. This is pre-eminently a Leicestershire dish, and, for some unknown reason, is rarely found so good in other counties. The following' recipe is an excellent one, but the making of pork pies requires practice,, and complete success must not be expected when they are made for the. first time by an inexperienced person. Care should be taken to procure the right kind of flour. It must not be too finely ground, and the gluten thus crushed out of it. If too fine flour be used the paste cannot be properly moulded into shape.

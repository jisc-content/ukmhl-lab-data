72 oyster. Close them securely to keep in the oysters. Roll in egg and bread crumbs. Fry in hot fat. Dish in a pile. Garnish with fried parsley. Instead of veal or chicken, mutton or beef may be used. If the oysters be too large, they can be cut in half. Mexican Rice. Cook a quarter of a pound of rice in three-quarters of a pint of white stock until it becomes quite teiider and thick, adding more stock if necessary. Stir in one ounce of butter. Season. Press the rice in^to a hot wet border mould. Turn out at once on to a hot dish. Fill in the centre with a well-flavoured mince. Garnish with hard-boiled egg, cut into quarters lengthways, and chopped parsley. Pour round tomato sauce. For the mince we require six ounces of cold meat, one gill of good brown stock, half an ounce of butter, half an ounce of flour. Make a sauce of the stock, flour and butter, season, add a little catsup or Harvey's sauce and the cold meat, re-heat, and use. Mushroom Pasty, Line a tin plate with pastry. Place over half a pound of mushrooms that have been peeled, sliced, and cooked tender in two ounces of butter, mixing* with them about two tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, and sufficient white sauce or cream to moisten them. Season to taste. Add two hard-boiled eggs, sliced. Cover with a lid of pastry. Score the top ornament, and brush over with egg. Bake about twenty minutes in quick oven.

46 Haddock. This fish rather resembles cod, but the flavour is rather more delicate and the flesh is less firm. It is also much smaller, and is therefore cooked whole, the tail being fastened through the eyes. Haddock may be had almost all the year round, but is best in the winter. It may be cooked in a great variety of ways :—Stuff'ed and baked (p. 52), filleted and fried, or (if very small) skinned and fried like whiting (p. 50). Haddock should be put into boiling water, but as it is not such a thick or firm fish as cod, it will be cooked in a comparatively shorter time. The following sauces may be eaten with boiled haddock:—Oyster (p. 161). Shrimp (p. 162). Anchovy (p. 163). Maitre d'Hotel (p. 165). TURBOT AND BRILL. These fish are much alike in general appearance, but turbot has bristles on the dark side, which are not found in brill. Turbot is the superior and more ex- pensive fish, but the method of cooking both turbot and brill is the same. Turbot is almost always boiled. A slit should be cut along the backbone on the black side, in order to keep the skin on the white side from cracking. It should then be rubbed over with lemon before it is put into the kettle ; this keeps the colour and gives firmness to the flesh. The fins should be trimmed but not cut closely, as they are the most delicate part of the fish. A turbot-kettle should be used, and great care should be exercised, as the fish must on no account become ragged or broken. The black side must be placed underneath in the water, and must also be next the dish, the white part being always at the top. In boiling, place in cold water as directed (p. 44). The following sauces are suitable :—Lobster (p. 161). Hollandaise (p. 164). Shrimp, for brill (p. 162).

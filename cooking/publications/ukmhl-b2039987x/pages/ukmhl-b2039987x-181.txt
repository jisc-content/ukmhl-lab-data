Bread, Rolls, and Cakes. BREAD. In making- bread, the flour, basin and water must all be warm but not hot. The dough must stand to rise in a warm place. It must be well kneaded till the dough does not stick to the hands, and will leave the sides and bottom of the basin quite clean. The time to rise must be at least that given in the recipe, and may be longer. The oven should be hot at first, then moderate. Bread must be thoroughly baked. To ascertain whether it is done, try with a skewer, and then turn the loaf out of its tin and see whether the crust is brown and crisp, and gives a sharp sound when tapped. Trying with a skewer is the usual manner of finding out whether bread or cakes are sufficiently baked ; the skewer should come out bright and clean without any dough sticking to it. In making a larger quantity of bread than the amount here given, a double quantity of yeast will not be required, as less yeast in proportion is needed to work a larger quantity of flour. The dough should, however, be allowed to rise for a longer time. The exact quantity of water cannot be given, as best flour takes up a larger quantity than inferior flour. Enough water must be used to make the dough quite elastic, but not enough to make it too soft. M

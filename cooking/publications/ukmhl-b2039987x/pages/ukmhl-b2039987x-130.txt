126 JELLIES. The pan in which the jelly is made must be bright and scrupulously clean. The whites and shells of the eggs must be beaten together, and the jelly whisked while coming to the boil, but not afterwards, or it will not be clear. Jelly must be cool before it is moulded, and should be placed in copper or tin moulds, which should have stood in cold water before they are used, and which must not have been dried. Jellies should be plunged for a moment in hot water before they are turned out; the top of the jelly must be wiped before turning out. The jelly bag must be scalded before use, and must be put away quite clean and dry. A linen cloth may be used instead of a jelly bag, but this must also be quite hot, or the jelly will set while running through. Lemon Jelly, Rind of lemons 4 (peeled thinly). Lemon juice \ pint. Sherry \ pint. Lump sugar | lb., or to taste. Water \\ pints. Gelatine (Marshall's) ... \\oz. Whites and shells of 2 eg'gs. Put the water with the lemon rind and juice, sugar and gelatine into a large brig'ht saucepan. Let it cook slowly until the gelatine is dissolved. Add the whites and shells of the eggs beaten together. Bring all slowly to boiling point, and while it is heating whisk and stir it, but do not whisk or stir after it boils. Let it boil up well for at least five minutes. Set it aside to settle for a few minutes, then strain it through a hot jelly bag once or twice till quite clear. The wine must be added after the jelly has been strained. When cool put the jelly into a mould.

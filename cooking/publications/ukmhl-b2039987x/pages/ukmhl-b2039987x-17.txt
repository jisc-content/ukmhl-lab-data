13 sizes are necessary ; the smallest is the one first used. The paste must be worked carefully with the hands up the sides of the mould, taking care that the paste at the bottom is not so thin that it will not support the weight of the meat, nor so thick that it will be uneatable. When the paste has been worked up on the smallest mould, the mould must be carefully removed, and replaced by a larger one, and the paste worked till the pie is of the right size. It must then stand in a cold place till the paste is quite stiff, when the meat can be put in. The meat must be well pressed down and must form a compact mass ; two tablespoonfuls of the gravy made from the bones is poured (warmed) on the top. A quarter of a pound of paste is rolled out to form the lid ; this must be wetted and securely fastened on, the edges of the lid of the pie must be firmly pressed together and neatly trimmed and ornamented according to taste. A hole must be made in the centre of the lid. The pies should be made the day before they are baked. A piece of paper should be pinned round each, and they should be baked for at least two hours and a half in a moderate oven. It is, however, better to send them to a baker's oven, the heat of which is more uniform than that of the oven by the kitchen fire. After the pies are baked and are still hot it is a good plan to pour in a little of the gravy, which should be made hot before adding. Veal and Ham Pie may be made in the same manner, but with rather less salt in the seasoning. Proportion :—Four ounces of cooked ham to one pound of veal. Beefsteak and Oyster Pie. The crust is made in the same manner as for pork pie. The filling is in the following proportion :— I lb. best steak to i6 oysters, r I teaspoonful salt 1 Mixed Seasoning \ \ teaspoonful pepper \ .

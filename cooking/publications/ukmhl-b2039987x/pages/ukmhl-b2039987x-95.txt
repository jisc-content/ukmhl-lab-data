91 Pheasants. Pheasants should always be hung- for some days before cooking, to acquire the right flavour. In very cold weather two or three weeks is not too long if liked **high." In damp, muggy weather four or five days is long enough. In old pheasants the spurs are long and sharp, in young ones the reverse. The under beak of most young h'vc&s bends easily. To Roast a Pheasant. Pluck, draw, singe, and truss in the same manner as for a roast fowl. Tie over the breast a slice of fat bacon and cook before a quick fire, basting almost incessantly with butter to prevent it getting dry, other- wise it would be spoilt. When nearly done remove the bacon, dredge with flour, and baste well to give it a frothy appearance. Time thirty minutes. Serve with good brown gravy made from game bones, browned crumbs, and bread sauce. The pheasant may be garnished with watercress if liked ; it may also be larded and braised. Guinea Fowls May be dressed and cooked in exactly the same way as pheasants, and are very useful as a substitute for game in the late spring. Partridges and Grouse. Choose in the same manner as pheasants. They are also dressed, cooked, and served in the same way. They may be dished on buttered toast. Time for partridges, about twenty minutes; grouse about ten minutes longer. Blackcock and Ptarmigan are cooked in the same manner as grouse. Browned Bread Crumbs for Game. Put some freshly made white bread crumbs into a shallow tin or fryingpan with a little butter and cayenne, and stir over a gentle heat until nicely browned. Care

^- Vegetables. General Rules. All veg-etables should, if possible, be boiled whole, as if cut they lose much of their flavour. Salt, in the proportion of two tablespoonfuls to every gallon, should be put into the water in which fresh vege- tables are boiled. No salt should be put into the water in which dried vegetables are cooked. All fresh vegetables, except some kinds of potatoes, should be put into boiling water ; all dried vegetables into cold water. All green vegetables must be boiled fast with the lid off the saucepan. The water (previously salted) must boil fast when the vegetables are put in ; the lid may be put on in order that they may boil up quickly, but must be taken off directly the water boils. Take great care not to overcook vegetables. They must be as fresh as possible ; they must be thoroughly but quickly washed, and not allowed to lose their fresh- ness and flavour by long soaking in water. Jerusalem Artichokes.

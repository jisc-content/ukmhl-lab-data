47 Mackerel. Mackerel is m season in spring and early summer. Later on in the year it is often very unwholesome, especially the parts that are near the head. Mackerel may be boiled whole, or stuffed and baked, or filleted and fried, or it is an excellent breakfast dish if split open, sprinkled with cayenne and salt, and cooked with plenty of butter before the fire. Mackerel when to be boiled should be placed in cold water, as directed (p. 44). The following sauces are suitable :—Gooseberry (p. 163). Maitre d'Hotel (p. 165). Parsley and butter (p. 165). Fennel (p. 165). Whiting. This fish when boiled is particularly suitable for invahds, as it is very light and digestible. It should be put into cold milk, and gently simmered till done. The milk should then be thickened, and served over the fish, as a sauce. A small piece of lemon rind boiled with the fish improves the flavour of the sauce, or a dessert- spoonful of chopped parsley, or a little anchovy sauce may be added, and a few drops of lemon juice. Soles, When very large, may be boiled in the same manner as whiting. Boiled soles, whether large or small, make a nice variety in invalid diet. Steamed Fish. special fish-steamers can be bought, but in case one is not at hand, small pieces of fish may be steamed in an ordinary steamer with a plate underneath it, or in the following manner :—Have ready a pan of boiling water, cover it with a plate ; on this place the fish, and cover it with the saucepan lid. Fried Fish. All fish for frying must be carefully prepared, and well cleaned and dried. They must be egg and bread- crumbed, or dipped in batter.

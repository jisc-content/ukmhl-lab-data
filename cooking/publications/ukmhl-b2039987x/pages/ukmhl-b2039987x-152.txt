148 Pigeon Pie. 4. ij lbs. I oz. Pigeons Beefsteak Butter Hard-boiled eggs Salt 2 teaspoonfuls. Pepper i teaspoonful. Stock. Pastry. Roll the steak as for beefsteak pie. Draw the pigeons and quarter them. Boil the eggs for twelve minutes, then put them into cold water, shell them and slice them. Put the layers of meat in a dish, then pieces of pigeon, placing in each a small piece of butter; then put in slices of egg, and so on till the dish is fullâ€” pigeons being at the top. Nearly fill the dish with stock. Put on the crust as for beefsteak pie. Brush over with egg. Scald the feet of the pigeons in boiling water, then skin them ; put them in the centre of the crust about half an hour before pie is done. Bake in the same manner as beefsteak pie. Fruit Tart. The dish in which a tart is made should not be too shallow, and the fruit should be well heaped up, as it will sink. A small cup should be placed in the centre ; this collects the juice, instead of allowing it to boil out. A small quantity of sugar should be put into the tart, but not too much; also a little cold water. The quantity of water depends upon the juiciness of the fruit, as rhubarb and very juicy fruit only need one or two teaspoonfuls of water. Cover edge of pie-dish with a layer of crust, then cover entirely with a thin crust. Do not make a hole in it. The time of baking depends upon the size of the tart, the kind of fruit, and the heat of the oven. It should be first put into a hot part of the oven, then when the crust is risen and is a nice colour, it should be removed to a more moderate part to finish baking.

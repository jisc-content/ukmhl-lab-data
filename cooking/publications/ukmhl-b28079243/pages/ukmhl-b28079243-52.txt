30 PASTRYCOOK AND CONFECTIONER'S GUIDE. 60.—Method of Creaming Cakes. Pat your sugar first into a creaming basin or tin, and your butter on the top of the sugar; put it in a warm place for a short time to get heated, but be sure and do not melt or heat it too much, or it will run to oil. Have your eggs all broken ready in a pot, and your flour and fruit (if any) mixed in the flour; then start and cream the butter and sugar together. When you think it is ready (which you may know by its light- ness and its rising in the pan) add your eggs; if a pound mixture, add 3 eggs at a time. When the eggs are all taken in, mix in your flour, &c., and put the mixture in your rings and hoops. Some prefer to add a little of the flour when creaming to keep it from curdling. 61.—Madeira Cakes. Take if lbs. of butter, 2 lbs. of sugar, 24 eggs, 2 lbs. of flour, and 1 lb. of patent flour (this will make eight cakes at is. each). Proceed as directed for creaming, putting two thin slices of peel on each cake. 62. Another Way.—The following is the latest mode of making these cakes :—Take 1 lb. of butter, lbs. of sugar, and 6 eggs; mix with 1 lb. of patent flour, 1 lb. of Hungarian flour, and half a pint of milk; brush the white of an egg with sugar syrup over the tops with a soft brush, and put two pieces of citron peel on each ; bake in a moderate oven. 63.—Cocoa-nut Cake. This is made the same as Madeira?, with \ lb. of ground cocoa-nut added to the mixture, and the tops well strewn with cocoa-nut.

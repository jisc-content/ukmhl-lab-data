Take some puff paste and roll it out thin; cut it in a round, the size of a large basin, and cover it over with apple marma- lade and currants and a fresh grated lemon; double it up like a triangle; cut figures on the top to please your fancy, ice it very well, and bake in a good oven. Scotch Cakes. I hope my readers will not think it out of place to give the mode of making Scotch Girdle Scones and Scotch Oat Cake, two of the most essential articles of food on the well-to-do working man’s table in Scotland. The Scotch housewife prides herself on her “ guid ” scones or “ guid ” oat cake, as well she may, for they only need to be better known to be more appreciated. In the first place, a “ girdle ” must be procured—a round flat iron pan to cover the fire, with a bool or handle and a small ring on the top with a swivel, so that it can be turned about on the fire after being hooked on to an iron hook in the centre of the fireplace.

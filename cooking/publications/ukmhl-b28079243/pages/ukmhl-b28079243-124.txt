98 PASTRYCOOK AND CONFECTIONER'S GUIDE. 290.—To roast Hare. Let it be extremely well washed and soaked for an hour or two in water, and put a large relishing stuffing into the belly. For stuffing use the liver, a little sweet herbs, pepper, salt, nut- meg, a little onion, crumbs of bread, and an egg to bind it; then sew up and run the spit straight through the mouth, and skewer the legs, so that it may lie upon them when on the dish. Serve with a fine froth and rich gravy, and a sauce-boat of melted currant jelly. 291.—Broiled and Hashed Hare. The flavour of broiled hare is very fine. The legs must be seasoned first, and rubbed with cold butter, and served very hot. The other parts, warmed with gravy and a little stuffing, may be served separately. 292. —Stewed Rabbits. The rabbits must be well washed, and after lying some time in water, should have a cupful of vinegar poured over them, and allowed to lie all night to take off the oily taste; then brown a little dripping, put in the rabbits, either whole or cut in pieces, nicely dusted with flour, and stew till tender. A young rabbit will do in an hour and a half, but an old one will take a great deal longer. 293. —Roasted Rabbits. The rabbits should be prepared with stuffing and gravy, like a hare, or they may be done without stuffing; serve with sauce of the liver and parsley chopped in melted butter, with pepper and salt.

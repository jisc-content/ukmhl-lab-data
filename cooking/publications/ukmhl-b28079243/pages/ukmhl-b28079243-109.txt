83 JOINTS AND DISHES OF BEEF. 237.—Beef Steaks. These should be cut pretty thick, and done on a clear fire, the gridiron being made hot before the steaks go on. They should be constantly turned to prevent the juice running out. They will do in ten minutes if the fire be good. A little shalot should be minced and laid on the dish, and then the steaks laid above it, with a sprinkling of salt between each steak to bring out the juice. 238.—To stew a Round. Put on the round without any water, to give it a brown; then add as much water as will prevent it burning, with carrots, turnips, and a few onions. 239.—To stew Beef in Slices. Cut any lean piece of beef in slices, beat it well, and sprinkle it with pepper and salt, then roll it up, and if you wish it to look particularly well rub it over with the yolk of an egg; dust it with flour and brown it nicely in a little dripping; add as much water as will nearly cover it, well thickened with flour, and brown it altogether for a minute, then stew very slowly for two or three hours. This makes a very nice dish. 240.—Minced Meat or Collops. Any piece of lean beef, if well minced, makes good collops, and about lbs. make a good side dish. They should be well beat in the frying-pan with a beater before they heat, other- wise they will run in knots; they should be thickened with a little flour and water. A little fish sauce or catsup is an im- provement. A quarter of an hour or twenty minutes will do them, but if done slowly, longer will not spoil them.

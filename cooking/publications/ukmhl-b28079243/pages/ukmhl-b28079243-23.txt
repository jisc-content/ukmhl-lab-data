Another Way.—The following is the method used in Aus- tralia for preserving eggs. The vessels in which the eggs are to be placed are glass jars with patent stoppers, vulcanised india rubber joints making them perfectly air-tight. As soon as the eggs have been collected, the jars are placed in hot water for some time and left until the air in them has become thoroughly warm and rarefied. The jars having been heated, the eggs are wrapped in paper to prevent them knocking together, and placed in the jars, their pointed ends uppermost. The jars are immediately closed up, and then, and not until then, are removed from the hot water. It is said that if this process is skilfully carried out the eggs will be as fit for the breakfast table many months after they were put in the jars as on the day they were laid. The great secret of success in carry- ing out this method is, no doubt, to thoroughly heat the air in the jars. The eggs will stand a better chance of keeping if the paper in which they are packed is previously baked and used warm. Patent stoppered jars are not absolutely necessary, any stopper answering which effectually excludes the air. Butter-Making. In regard to butter-making, by whatever process or utensil butter is made, the cream should always be at a temperature of about 6o° Fahr. Consequently, it requires a cool place in hot weather, and occasionally artificial heat in cold weather. There are charms which are said to be serviceable in “making the butter to come.” One which was once in common use in the North was to chant the following strain:— “ Peter standing at the gate, Waiting for a butter cake, % Churn, butter, churn ! ”

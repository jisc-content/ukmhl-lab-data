Let it stand for half an hour, and work off into horse- shoes, circles, twists, &c. Prove, and bake in a good oven. 8.—American Condums. (For Breakfast.) Use the same dough as for plain breakfast rolls; mould them up the shape of an egg, but the dough must be if anything a little tighter; when moulded take your pin and press it in the middle of the roll; have a tin or board with a cloth laid on it well dusted with flour, lay your condums on the cloth, and let a small piece of the cloth be between each condum to keep them from sticking. Prove, and bake on the oven bottom. 9.—-French Rolls. Use the same dough as for the above, but moulded a little longer, as for condums. Bake in French roll pans.

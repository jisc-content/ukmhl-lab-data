Take 3 lbs. of butter and 3 lbs. of flour; the butter must be tough ; if salt, wash it in two waters the night before it is used; take half of it and rub it in the flour; make it into a paste with pure water of the same stiffness as the butter; roll it on a marble slab about half an inch thick, spot it with small pieces of butter, and dust it with flour; then double it up and roll it out again; spot it as before, and roll it out again; spot it the third time ; then double it up again, roll it out again twice, and cut it into shreds about two inches broad, when it will be fit for use. 145.—Another Way.—You may make common puff paste this way proper for large pies by using only 1 lb. of butter to 2 lbs. of flour.

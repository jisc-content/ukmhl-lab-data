94 PASTRYCOOK AND CONFECTIONER'S GUIDE. a very small one, or a chicken, twenty minutes. A capon will take from half an hour to thirty-five minutes; a goose, an hour; wild cluck, a quarter of an hour; pheasants, twenty minutes; small stuffed turkey, an hour and a quarter; turkey poult, twenty minutes; grouse, a quarter of an hour; quails, ten minutes; and partridges, from twenty to twenty-five minutes. A hare will take nearly an hour. Geese require a brisk fire and quick turning; hares and rabbits must be well attended to, and the extremities brought to the quick part of the fire to be equally done with the backs. 274.—To boil a Turkey. First cut a slit in the back of the neck ; fill it with crumbs of bread, mixed with a bit of butter, the yolk of an egg, spice, and a very little milk to moisten it; then sew up the skin, turn the head over the left wing, skewer it, and flour the cloth to boil it in. Have ready a little melted butter for sauce; take a little of the gravy the bird was boiled in, mix with it a few oysters, and pour the sauce over the turkey before serving. 275.—To roast a Turkey or Fowl. Prepare the same as in the foregoing recipe, and baste the bird well with butter; boil the heart, liver, &c., in a little water for gravy, and pour a little of the dripping over the feet before serving. A Fowl is roasted in the same manner as a turkey. 276.—To boil Fowls. Pick them nicely, singe, wash, and truss them; flour them, and put them into boiling water. A young chicken will take twenty minutes, and larger fowls—according to size—from that time to thirty-five minutes. Serve with parsley and butter and oyster or liver sauce.

ICE CREAM IN MOULDS. 61 159.â€”To put Ice Cream into Moulds, Fruit Shapes, etc. Rub your moulds very bright, and fix on top and bottom with writing paper; take off the top and fill the mould with the frozen ice cream already prepared. It must be forced in very tight, that no holes may appear when turned out; then lay on the writing paper, fix on the top, and immediately cover it well over with salted ice. Go on in the same way until the wThole is put into moulds; then lay them on one side upon ice, in a tub with two bottoms, cover them well over with salted ice, which must be pressed tightly down, and in one hour the ice cream will be hard enough to turn out; bpt should it be wanted sooner a little saltpetre beat small and mixed with the salt will be of great advantage. If the ice cream is to be put in shapes to represent ripe fruit proceed as follows : Suppose it is apricot moulds you wish to use, when they are ready open them and colour the inside a pale yellow ; with a small brush which has been dipped in lake finely ground, colour the sides of the mould in part; then take a small bit of whisk, dip it in the lake, and spot the mould a little with it, after which fill both sides very full and put them together; wrap the shape in strong brown paper, to keep the salt from penetrating the opening of the mould, then immerse it well in salted ice. For peach, pear, pineapple, &c., the mould must be appro- priately coloured in the same manner. When you wish to turn out your shapes, you must have everything in readiness to receive them, and never turn them out before the ice of each is wanted. Take each mould and wash it well in plenty of cold water, then rub it dry with a towel; take a strong knife, and- force off the top ; rub the top very clean, then take away the paper, and place the top on;

MOCHA CORN FLOUR CAKE. Ingredients. 4 Eggs. J lb. Castor Sugar. J lb. Brown and Poison’s Corn Flour. 1 teaspoonful Baking Powder. Grease a round shallow cake tin with clarified butter. Separate the whites from the yolks of the four eggs, add the castor sugar to the yolks, and beat them well together for ten minutes. Mix the baking powder with the flour, and stir in gradually to the sugar and yolks. Add a pinch of salt or castor sugar to the whites of the eggs, and whip to a stiff froth, then stir in lightly to the mixture, pour into cake tin, and bake in a quick oven for twenty-five minutes. When done, turn it out on to a wire sieve, or rear it up so as to allow the steam to escape, to prevent it from getting heavy. When thoroughly cold, ice, and decorate as follows :— Ingredients for Icing. 1 lb. Icing Sugar. \ lb. Fresh Butter. 1 tablespobnful of Essence of Coftee. If the icing sugar is lumpy, pound it in a mortar, then rub it through a wire sieve. Put the butter into a basin, and work it with a wooden spoon for a few minutes. Add to it, a little at a time, the icing sugar, and beat to a smooth cream ; then stir in gradually the coffee essence. When the cake is ready to ice, cut the top of it quite even, and coat it round the sides with the icing mixture with a palette knife, occasionally dipping the knife in hot water, so as to make the surface smooth ; then ice the top of the cake in the same manner. Put the remainder of the icing into a forcing bag, with a rose forcer, and decorate according to taste. This is a very delicious cake to serve with coffee, much used in Paris.

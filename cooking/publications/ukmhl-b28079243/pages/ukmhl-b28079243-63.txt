SCOTCH CAKES. 39 96.—Girdle Scones. Take 4 lbs. of flour, 1 oz. of cream of tartar, 1 oz. of car- bonate of soda, i oz. of tartaric acid, f oz. of salt, and mix all these ingredients together; put them all into a basin, make a hole in the centre, and pour in as much churned milk as will make them into a nice working dough; mould up in pieces about 1 lb. in weight, pin them out not too thick, and cut them into four; or roll out a sheet and cut with a small round cutter; bake on the girdle, turning them when half done on the other side. Care must be taken not to have the fire too hot, or they will burn before they are half baked. 97.—Girdle Cakes or Scones. These are sometimes called in Scotland “ English Muffins.” Take 8 lbs. of soda flour, 1 -lb. of lard, 1 oz. of salt, 1 lb. of sugar, 6 eggs, and make into dough with buttermilk; weigh off at 8 ozs. the pair, mould round, pin out the size of a small breakfast plate, and bake on the hot plate; when they are about half done, turn them on the other side to finish baking. 98.—Scotch Oat Cake. Put about 2 or 3 lbs. of oatmeal in a basin with salt sufficient to your taste; pour as much warm water in as will make the meal into a nice working dough; then mould each piece round; pin out thin, rub the surface of the cake well with your hand, and cut into four; sharpness must be used in working these off, as-the warm water has a tendency to make the dough tight or stiff; after they are baked on the girdle place them before the fire to thoroughly dry. Some persons use a little lard and a pinch of soda, but the above recipe is the original way to make Scotch Oatmeal Cakes.

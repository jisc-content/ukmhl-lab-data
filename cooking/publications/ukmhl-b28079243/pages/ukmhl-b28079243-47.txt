RUSKS, BISCUITS. 46.—Cinnamon Rusks. 25 Take 12 ozs. of butter, i£ lbs. of sugar, 8 yolks of eggs, and a little ground cinnamon. Mix all the ingredients together; then add as much flour as will make a stiff paste, and roll into rings about the size of a dollar or crown and bake in a slow oven. 47. —Cream Biscuits. Mix i quart of cream and 3 lbs. of Hungarian flour into a fine stiff paste, and roll into biscuits any size you please; they must be docked on both sides and baked in a good oven. 48. —Butter Biscuits. Take 9 ozs. of butter, 3 lbs. of Hungarian flour, and 1 pint of water. Melt the butter in the water, and mix up the flour into a stiff paste; roll it out, and cut into any size you please; dock on both sides, and bake in a good oven. 49. —Naples Biscuits. Take 8 eggs, 1 lb. of sugar, 1 gill of water, and 1 lb. 2 ozs. of flour. Put the sugar with the water into a small pan and let the sugar dissolve and then boil; then whisk the eggs and pour in the sugar in a gentle stream; keep whisking until the mix- ture is very light, which you may know by its rising. When it is perfectly cold scatter in the flour and mix it until smooth, but stir it as little as possible ; then put it into the frame, which should be well filled. A Naples biscuit frame is about 8 ins. long, 3 ins. broad, and 1 in. deep, and has upright partitions, which must be papered nicely before filling. Bake in a good oven, but not too hot; throw a dust of sugar over the biscuits as they are going into the oven.

50 PASTRYCOOK AND CONFECTIONER'S GUIDE. 129. —Bread and Butter Pudding. Cut slices of bread according to the size of your dish, spread each slice with butter, and sprinkle them with raw sugar; boil ii pints of milk, add to it 3 eggs well beaten, stirring it well all the time ; pour it over the bread in the dish, cover up, and send to the oven. 130. —Apple or Currant Fritters. Take a small teacupful of batter, as for pancakes, and pour it into the frying-pan; have ready a few apples, pared, cored, and cut in slices, and throw them into the frying-pan at equal distances; then take about half a cupful more of the batter, and throw’ it over them; then cut them in pieces with an apple in each section, turn them, and serve hot. Currant Fritters may be made the same way, only the cur- rants should be mixed with the batter before frying. 131.—Oatmeal Pudding. Take good oatmeal, as much as will nearly fill a tin pudding- dish ; add about four large spoonfuls of well-minced suet, plenty of pepper and salt, or to your taste, and set it under the meat when roasting so as to catch some of the dripping; put it pretty near the fire. 132.—Rice Pudding. Mash £ lb. of rice, and boil it till it is very soft; drain it, put it in the pie-dish with any kind of fruit you may fancy, and put 1 oz. of butter over it in small pieces; then pour your custard over and bake. 133.—Vermicelli or Macaroni Pudding. Vermicelli or macaroni, which has been previously boiled, may be done the same way as rice, as in the last recipe.

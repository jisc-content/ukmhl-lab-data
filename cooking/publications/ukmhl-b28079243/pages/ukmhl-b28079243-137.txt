The miller who has read and digested this work will have laid the founda- tion, so to speak, of a successful career; he will have acquired a number of general principles which he can proceed to apply. In this handsome volume we at last have the accepted text-book of modern milling in good, sound English, which has little, if any, trace of the German idiom.”—The Miller. “Piofessor Kick treats the subject so thoroughly both on its theoretical and practical sides that his work is well suited to be a text-book of technical education anywhere.”—Scotsman. “ The appearance of this celebrated work in English is’very opportune, and British millers will, we are sure, not be slow in availing themselves of its pages That the fund of information in the work should now be available for every English miller is a boon indeed.”—Millers' Gazette. “ It should be in the hands of all directly interested in the question of milling or flour.”—Manchester Guardian.

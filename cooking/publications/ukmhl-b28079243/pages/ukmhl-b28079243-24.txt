4 PASTRYCOOK AND CONFECTIONER’S GUIDE. Possibly these words, set to a lively-going tune, might get a speedier action out of the arms of the churner, and thus bring the butter sooner. There is another north-country milkmaid’s charm, now nearly forgotten, which may interest some. If a milch cow was cross when being milked, and had the fault of kicking over the milkpail occasionally, it was said that she could be made quite docile by a few soft pats on the flank, the milkmaid repeating the while this singular charm— “ Approche, Madame ! Approche, Madame! ” Sugar. Mr. F. Barker Cooke, in a lecture on “Sugar” before the City of London College Science Society, said that the Greeks and Romans knew of the existence of sugar (as evidenced by their writings), although they used honey for sweetening pur- poses ; and after tracing the history of sugar from their time to the present, Mr. Cooke gave a detailed account of the extrac- tion of sugar from the cane, beetroot, date-palm, maple-tree, milk, malt, and starch. He then explained that sugar was really a generic term for very many different substances, which are divided into the three groups of saccharoids, glucoses, and saccharoses, each having its characteristic properties. He pointed out that twenty varieties of cane sugar are known, varying from white crystals from the Mauritius to a very black sugar from Manilla. Beet sugars also are produced of all shades. Adulteration. A few words may be added here on a subject of the greatest importance—Adulteration. While science is daily at work analysing and detecting the existence of foreign bodies in our food, it is still more.actively, though not quite so creditably, engaged in devising means by which fraud can be successfully carried out.

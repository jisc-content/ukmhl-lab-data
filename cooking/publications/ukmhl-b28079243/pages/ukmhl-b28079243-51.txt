V. PLAIN AND FANCY CAKES. Cake-making Machinery. Cake-creaming machines, sponge-beating machines, and peel- cutting machines are all held by some persons to be necessary adjuncts to the modern confectionerâ€™s appliances; but these machines are mostly used in large factories, and as this book is written with the intention rather of helping those in a much smaller way of business, I think it unnecessary to go into the respective merits of each of them. Where, however, an em- ployer can afford the outlay for purchasing such machines, and can find employment for them, he will find them of great use in a modern bakery. Instructions for Baking Cakes. A few remarks and instructions as to the baking of cakes may be made here. Queen cakes must be baked in a mode- rate oven, and will take about twenty minutes. A i-lb. cake will take about three-quarters of an hour; a 2-lb. cake, ij hours; a 4-lb. cake, 2 hours; a 6-lb. cake, 4 hours; a 12-lb. cake, 6 hours; a 20-lb. cake, 7 hours. To know when the small cakes are baked enough, give them a gentle touch with your finger; if the part rises up to its place they are baked enough. The large cakes must be tried by a bit of dry whisk being put into the middle of the cake; if it come out clammy and sticky the cake is not baked enough ; if it come out dry the baking is finished. Large cakes should be covered with strong paper, after they are risen, to prevent them from burning.

54 PASTRYCOOK AND CONFECTIONER'S GUIDE. 146.—Another Way.—Take 2% lbs. of butter and 3^- lbs. of flour; mix the flour with water of the same stiffness as the butter, then roll out the paste, spot it with the butter thiee times, rolling it out and dusting it with flour as before; cut it in shreds for use. This paste is worse for lying, and should be baked as soon as possible. 147.—A Pyramid in Puff Paste. Take some best puff paste and roll it about a quarter of an inch thick; cut the first layer the size of the bottom of your dish, either the shape of the dish, or a diamond, or any other shape you please; cut about 10 or 12 more layers, reducing each half an inch in diameter all round ; give each a slit in the middle to make them rise regularly, ice the points, and bake them in a good oven. When cold place the largest on the dish with raspberry jam, the next with apricot marmalade, and so on to the smallest; then fix a sprig of myrtle on the top and spin some sugar round it, which will make it both firm and beautiful. 148.—To make a Handsome Tartlet. Take a large oval dish and sheet it with the best puff paste; cut it round the sides to make leaves, and fill it three-parts full with good preserved fruit; ornament on the fruit any device you please, such as a large star in cut paste, a sprig of flowers, or a tree; then bake it with great care, and serve it up the second course either with or without a spun sugar crocanth. 149.—Crisp Tart Paste. Take 1 lb. of butter and 2 lbs. of flour; rub the butter and flour very finely together, then mix it with water into paste the stiffness of the butter. This is a choice paste for tarts made of fresh fruit.

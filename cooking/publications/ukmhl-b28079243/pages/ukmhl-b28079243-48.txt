26 PASTRYCOOK AND CONFECTIONER'S GUIDE. 50.—Macaroons. Take i lb. of Valentia almonds, i lb. 8 ozs. of sugar, about 7 whites of eggs. Blanch and beat the almonds, with the white of an egg, in a marble mortar; when beat very fine add the sugar and two or three more whites; beat them well to- gether, then take out the pestle and add two more whites, and work all well with a spatter until the whole of the whites are incorporated.

If they are of a proper stiffness lay all out and bake as before. If they are good they will come off the pap&r as soon as cold ; if not, the paper must be laid on a damp table for a short time, which will have the desired effect. If you

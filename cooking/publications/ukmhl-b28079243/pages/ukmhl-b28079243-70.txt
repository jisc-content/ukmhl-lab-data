VI. PIES, PUDDINGS, AND CUSTARDS. 115.—A Creamed Apple Pie. Make a very nice apple pie with the best puff paste; and bake it in a slow oven with great care; then cut and bake a large star nearly the size of the inside. As soon as the pie is baked enough, cut the lid off and let it stand till cold ; make the apples up neatly, and if not very well filled add more apples previously baked; then pour on the apple a rich custard and place on the custard the star before named. 116.—To Ice Tarts. Whisk up one or two whites of eggs and wash over the top of the tarts with a soft brush ; cover the wet part with sifted sugar; damp the sugar with water from the brush until dis- solved, and then put the tarts immediately into a moderate oven. When near enough, ice them again as before. 117.—Apple Pie. Pare whatever quantity of apples you wish, and cut them in small pieces ; fill the dish, putting in sugar between the layers, also a little marmalade or orange-peel, and about half-a-dozen cloves; it is the better for as much water as will melt the sugar; then cover with a light crust. Some persons wash the top over and then dust with castor sugar.

MEAT PIES AND PATTIES. 9i 267.—Pigeon Pie. Soak your pigeons well in cold water, till the water is free from blood; pepper and salt them well before closing them ; lay a beef-steak at the bottom of the dish, and, between every two, half the yolk of an egg, hard boiled; add a little water thickened with flour, then cover with a good paste, and in the centre stick three feet, nicely cleaned, to show what kind of a pie it is. 268.—Paste for Small Raised Pies. Take 12 ozs. of butter, 2 lbs. of flour, and a gill of water, and mix same way as for baked custards. 269.—Paste for Goose Pie. Take 4 lbs. of butter, 1 lb. of beef suet, and 10 lbs. of flour; melt the butter and suet in 1 quart of water, mix it into the flour, which should make stiff paste; if it be not sufficient to do that, add a little boiled water; it must be worked smooth and raised warm; let it stand all night, then fill and finish it. If made into one pie this quantity will be sufficient for a goose and a turkey boned, and a tongue cut in slices. It should be baked in a solid oven. 270.—Oyster Patties. Provide as many oysters as you want; take off the beards, cut them into small pieces, and put them in a saucepan with a little nutmeg, white pepper, and salt to your taste ; simmer the whole a few minutes with a little of the oyster liquor and a bit of butter ; then sheet the pans with tart paste, put in each of them a piece of bread and cover with the best puff* paste; cut them neatly round the edges, run a sharp-pointed knife round between the rim and the top, and wash them over with yolk of egg and a little water ; bake them in a moderate oven,

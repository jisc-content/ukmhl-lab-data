X. JOINTS AND MEAT DISHES. 236.—Joints of Beef. The best roasting pieces are sirloin, spare-rib, and the head of a huck bone. A large sirloin will take 2£ hours to roast. Have a clear, brisk fire, baste the meat well with dripping when it first goes to the fire, but keep it at a distance at first, for if it once gets hardened on the outside it will never roast properly afterwards, but will be red at the bone even though it look burnt on the outside. All meat should be sprinkled with a little salt while roasting, and garnished with a little scraped horse-radish, and the gravy —made with boiling water—should be poured over any brown bone or corner, but not over all the meat. A spare-rib will take 3 hours to roast, and the head of the huck bone about 2rjr hours. 1 he nicest boiling pieces are a round and a rump, which are good either fresh or salted, and may be sent to the table sur- rounded either with turnips and carrots or greens. A breast or runner of beef is very nice when salted, either with or without saltpetre. It will take for a round or breast about 2 ozs. of saltpetre, which should be mixed with the salt, and sparingly put on at first for a night or two ; then put on all the rest of the salt, and rub and turn the meat every other day for a fortnight, when it will be fit for use. Any of the other pieces make excellent broth; the rump and spare-rib do best for steaks.

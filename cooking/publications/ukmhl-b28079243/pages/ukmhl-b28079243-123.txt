POULTRY AND GAME. 97 285.—Grouse. Roast them like fowls, but in dressing the head should be twisted under the wing. They must not be overdone. Serve with a rich gravy in the dish and bread sauce. 286.—To roast Wild Fowl. The flavour is best preserved without stuffing, but pepper, salt, and a piece of butter may be put into each before roasting. Wild fowl require much less dressing than tame. Put an onion, salt, and hot water into the dripping-pan, and baste them for the first ten minutes with this, then take away the pan and baste with a little butter. They should be served of a fine colour, and well frothed up, and a rich brown gravy should be sent in the dish. When the breast is first cut, a squeeze of a lemon is a great improvement to the flavour, to take off the fishy taste which wild fowl sometimes have. 287.—Wild Ducks. Before roasting they should be well washed with salt and water, to take off the fishy taste, and with the same object a lemon may be squeezed over the breast when cut on the table. 288.—Woodcocks, Snipes, and Quails. Roast them without drawing, and serve them on toast, butter may be eaten with them, as gravy takes off the flavour. The thigh and the back are esteemed the best. 289.—Guinea and Pea Fowls. These will be found to eat much like pheasants, and may be dressed in the same way. H

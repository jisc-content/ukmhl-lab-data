VII. ICE CREAMS AND WATER ICES. 155.—Building an Ice-House. An ice-house should if possible be built on the side of a hill, and shaded with trees. If the soil is sand or gravel, it will require no drain. Let the wall be perpendicular and at least be two feet thick; on the bottom build five or seven pillars—according to the size of the house—two feet high; one in the centre, the others round the sides at a proper distance from each other near the wall. Make a basin at the bottom for water; upon these pillars lay beams of wood, and from them make a trellis. The door of the house should face the north; the passage should be five or six feet long, and be made in a zig-zag direction, to prevent a sudden gust of air; in it fix three or four doors of well-seasoned wood not likely to shrink and at least two inches thick. The house must be of a high pitch on the outside and covered well with clay. If not well shaded with trees, fix over the brick and clay a false roof, at least one foot from the brickwork, which roof must be well thatched. This is very essential, to prevent the sun from shedding its beams on the roof of the house; or should you thatch it close to the brickwork, the warmth of the thatch will do more harm than the rays of the sun, for which reason it is necessary to have a space for free air. Let a trench be made from each side of the door with a proper descent to

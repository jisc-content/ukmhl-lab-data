20 PASTRYCOOK AND CONFECTIONER’S GUIDE. 29.—Switchback Buns. Take any quantity of tea-cake dough, allowing i egg to each pound of dough, and a few drops of essence of lemon; mix well together and let it prove; then weigh off at 6 ozs. the pair; mould up, round, and dip them in egg, then in No. 2 crystallized sugar; place them on tins, prove them, and bake in a moderate oven. This bun answers well for children’s tea meetings, excur- sions, &c. 30. —Swiss Buns. Put 4 lbs. of flour in a basin, make a bay, and set a ferment with, say, 1 gill of water and \ gill of milk warmed to between 8o° and 90° Fahr.; add also 4 ozs. of yeast and 4 ozs. of sugar, stirring in a little flour to form a ferment. When the ferment is ready, mix in 10 eggs, 12 ozs. of butter, another 8 ozs. of sugar, and a pinch of salt; add sufficient water to take up all the flour, mix well, and beat all together into a nice bun dough; let it lie until nicely proved, and then weigh off at 4 ozs. the pair; mould up the shape of a long roll batched on tins, but not too close; prove them, and when baked have some water icing ready—made with icing sugar and water— spread this on the top with a palette knife, and when dry they are ready for the shop. 31. —Lumley Buns. These are made the same way as Swiss buns, only they are moulded round and dipped in egg, then dipped in castor sugar, and placed on tins. Put a little piece of candied lemon on each, prove them, and dust them again with sugar before going into the oven

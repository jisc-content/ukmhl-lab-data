JELLIES. 73 of great use. When you intend to introduce fruit fix your moulds in salt, then fill them half full of jelly; let it stand until set, and then place on it a large strawberry just plucked, with the leaf and stalk on it; fill up the mould with jelly. You may also introduce in other moulds cherries or peaches or other fruit; but this can only be done when fruit is in season. When it is not, wafer paper painted as such or in landscape, and laid upon the dish with the shape of jelly turned upon it, has a very good effect. 213.—A Corner Dish or Fish Pond.

Take green sugar and run it round on the surface of the jelly half an inch wide next to the glass; you may also run orange-coloured sugar about a quarter of an inch wide in the middle of the green to represent a “walk on the green.” Shells made of gum paste, called dragees, may also be introduced.

This is made with 6 liqueur glasses of maraschino with a quart of clarified calf’s-foot jelly. Fruit cut into quarters may be added. 215.—Gold or Silver Jelly —or both mixed—is made with eau-de-vie de Dantzic by mixing the gold and silver leaves with a little jelly and

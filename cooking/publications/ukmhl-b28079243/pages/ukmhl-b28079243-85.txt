59 ICE HOUSES, THE FREEZING TUB. so well filled at the first part of the winter, there will be space to fill up in a few weeks’ time. Tight doors will keep ice in great perfection without salt, whereas salt is certain to waste it. It certainly makes ice freeze a little at first, but as soon as its power is exhausted the ice begins to waste. When your house is well filled shut the door, and clay up all the crevices. Do the same to the next door; fill this passage with bundles of straw, and clay up the door as before. When you open the house shut yourself in the first passage, take out the straw from the second passage, and put it in the first passage, which will protect the ice from the air. You may then open the ice door and take out the ice you want. The doors must be clayed up with the same care as before, by which precaution you preserve your ice from all danger. If you fill a newly-built house, a board fixed next the wall may be of service, but remember to use no straw. For small quantities an ice-house is not advisable, as good fresh ice can be bought at any time in any town of reasonable size. 157.—The Freezing Tub. The tub should be made oblong or oval, the sides to be as upright as possible. It may be made to hold two or three freezing pots in length, leaving a sufficient space for the ice. It must have a false bottom, with some holes in it. In the side of the tub, near the bottom, make a hole for a peg, by which means you may draw off the water, a precaution highly nece ssary when freezing to prevent the water from ever getting into the freezing pot. Freezing tubs or freezing machines of various shapes, and embodying the latest improvements, can be had of the manu- facturers of bakers’ and confectioners’ utensils.

MUFFINS AND CRUMPETS. IS brown turn them gently on the other side and bake a nice delicate brown. 17. Another way.—Some persons now make muffins after the same formula as for tea cakes, namely, moulding one in each hand pinned out the size required, then proving and baking. I have tried that way more than once, but I cannot get the muffins to appear anything like what my experience teaches me a muffin should be. Practice and judgment are required to make one proficient in muffin-making. There has recently been introduced to the trade a hot plate heated with gas, which will go a long way in helping the muffin- maker. It is both cleaner and handier, and you can bake with it to a more certain degree of heat. 18— Crumpets. Crumpets are generally made by muffin-makers, the most modern formula being the following :—Take 4 lbs. of good English flour, 2 ozs. of good yeast, and 2 ozs. of salt. The flour and salt may be sifted together. Take 1 quart of milk, and quarts of water, at about ioo° Fahr.; dissolve your yeast in the water, then mix in your flour and salt; make all into a thin liquid paste, giving it a thoroughly good mixing; let it stand for one hour, when you may again give it a tho- roughly good beat; let it stand for another hour, when it will be ready to bake off. In the meantime thoroughly clean your stove or hot plate before it gets hot, and give it a rub over with a greasy cloth; then have your rings of the size required (they should be half an inch in depth); slightly grease them, and see that they are greased for each round of the hot plate ; have a cup in one hand and a saucer in the other to prevent the batter dropping; pour half a cup of the batter into the rings and spread them with a palette knife to a level surface,

FRUIT PIES, MINCE PIES. 47 118.—Gooseberry Pie. Fill your dish with gooseberries, having first picked them; put on a good quantity of sugar and a very little water, and cover with a light crust. If preferred, wash it and dust with sugar. 119.—Currant Pie. First strip the currants from the stalks; then fill the dish with them, and put in a good deal of sugar, and cover with a good crust. 120.—Rhubarb Pie. Cut the rhubarb stalks into pieces an inch long, having previously either skinned the stalks or simply washed them ; fill the dish with them, putting in plenty of sugar, and cover with a nice crust. 121, —Mincemeat. Take i lb. beef suet, i lb. Naples biscuits, i lb. of apples and citron, i lb. raw sugar, i lb. of candied lemon and orange, 3 lbs. clean currants, a pint of raisin wine, and a gill of brandy. The suet must be picked and shred very fine, and the apples, sweetmeats, and biscuits must also be shred fine; mix all the ingredients together and put them into a jar; tie them over, and your mincemeat will keep good for twelve months. 122. —Mince Pie. Take a dozen of apples, and pare and mince them, along with equal parts of suet, raisins, and currants—well cleaned and picked—with some orange peel, ground ginger, and raw sugar; mix well, filling the dish with it, and pouring in a little currant or ginger wine to moisten. Cover with a good paste. It should have paste under as well as above the mincemeat, and the covering should be cut in small slits to show what the pie is composed of.

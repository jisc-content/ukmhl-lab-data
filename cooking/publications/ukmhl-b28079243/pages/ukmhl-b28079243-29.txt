II. PLAIN AND FANCY BREAD. 1.—Household Bread. Put i stone of flour in a basin and make a hole in the centre of the flour. Have previously dissolved in a large cup of warm water 2 ozs. of German yeast; pour the yeast into the hole in the flour; stir a little flour in; let it stand for about two hours in a warm place; then add 3 ozs. of salt and sufficient milk or water to make it into a nice mellow dough ; let it stand for one hour, then put it into tins and let it prove; then bake it off. Let the oven be a good sound heat. 2.—Diet or Whole Meal Bread. Take 8 lbs. of granulated wheat meal, 4 ozs. of cream of tartar, 2 ozs. of soda, 4 ozs. of castor sugar, 2 ozs. of salt. Sift all the ingredients well together, along with the wheat meal; make a good large bay in the centre of the flour; put as much churned milk in as you think will take in all the flour, and make into a nice working dough. Weigh off at 2 lbs., 1 lb., or whatever size loaves are required. They are generally baked in oval tins turned upside down on the loaves, and should be baked in a sound oven. 3.—Rye Bread. Put 8 lbs. of household flour in a basin; make it into a weak dough, so as you can stir it nicely with a spoon; give it 4 ozs.

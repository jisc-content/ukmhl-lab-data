AMERICAN FANCY BREADS. 13 American Fancy Breads. Our Transatlantic cousins have a great variety of bread, which appears every morning on the breakfast-table. In this country ninety-nine housewives out of a hundred are content with the same accustomed “ staff of life ” day after day, and month after month, sometimes varying the monotony with a few breakfast rolls. In addition to the Condums, for which a recipe is given above, we append three examples of the forms of American fancy bread in common use. 13.—Indian Bread. Take half a pint each of buttermilk and sweet milk, adding- one half teaspoonful of carbonate of soda to the former; beat up two fresh eggs—whites and yolks together—pour the milk into the eggs, stirring gently at the same time; then sprinkle in nine tablespoonfuls of sifted Indian corn meal, and mix tho- roughly; put a piece of lard the size of an egg in the pan in which you are going to bake your bread, and when it is melted pour in your batter, having previously added a teaspoonful of salt. Bake in a moderate oven until crisp and light. 14.—Graham Bread. This is very delicious and simple to make. To make a loaf take two cups of white bread sponge, adding two tablespoonfuls of brown sugar and sufficient flour to make a stiff batter; let it rise, then add more flour, enough to knead it up with. Put it in the pan to rise still more, and then bake a pale colour. 15.—Travellers’ Bread. This favourite article with the Yankees is made by mixing with 1 lb. of flour about % lb. of currants, dates, figs, and raisins, all of them except the currants being chopped fine.

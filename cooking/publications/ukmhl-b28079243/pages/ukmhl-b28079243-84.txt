58 PASTRYCOOK AND CONFECTIONER'S GUIDE. throw off the water at the back part of the house; this will keep the walls dry on the outside. If the soil is clay, it will be necessary to make a drain from the basin at the bottom ; this, however, is a nice point, unless there is a common sewer or rivulet near for the drain to empty itself into. If not, the difficulty is great. To guard against the danger prepare an air-tight drain with a proper descent; at the ends of which dig a well for the drain to empty itself into, let there be a tight plug fixed at the end of the drain which must be taken out occasionally ; over the well fix a strong door and frame, which must be locked and the key entrusted to one servant only, whose business it must be to pay proper attention to the well, and dispose of the water from time to time. Procure your ice clear and free from grass: cover the trellis at the bottom with thorns or old gooseberry bushes, and not on any account with straw, for as soon as straw gets wet it heats and wastes the ice. Beat the ice small at the door of the house, and let one or two men keep beating it down as it is thrown in. If there is snow upon the ground, put in three or four loads at different times, which will fill up all crevices, and be of great use in levelling; fill up the house in this way, but put no straw round the sides of the house, nor on the top; and do not put any salt in the ice. Ice well beat down, in a house with a good drain and free circulation of air, may be preserved from all danger, but if the precautions I have in- dicated be neglected loss and waste will be inevitable. Eighteen feet in depth from the crown to the trellis, and twelve feet in diameter, are about the usual dimensions of an ice-house. 156.â€”Filling the Ice-House. When you can obtain plenty of ice two or three inches thick, do not neglect the opportunity, for if the house is ever

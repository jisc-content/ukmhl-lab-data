24 PASTRYCOOK AND CONFECTIONER*S GUIDE. duck whites if you can procure them—whisk them with a dry whisk until so stiff that an egg will lie on the surface; then mix in with the spatter fine ^ugar until a proper stiffness is attained, which you may know by laying one out oval with a knife and spoon. If the composition retains the mark of the knife, it is ready to bake; if not, more sugar must be added. Lay out oval on dry paper and bake on a piece of wood two inches thick. This is to prevent the meringues having any bottom; they must have a pretty bloom upon them when baked. With a knife carefully take out the inside of one and fill it with any kind of preserved fruit, then take another and do the same and put the two together, and so on until all are baked. If good they will have the appearance of small eggs. Meringue Mixture for Piping is made by taking the whites of 8 fresh eggs and whisking them to a very strong froth; then adding i lb. of castor sugar and a little essence of vanilla to flavour. 44.—Imperials. Cream 6 ozs. of butter, 6 ozs. of sugar, and add four eggs, one at a time; when ready, add 4 ozs. of flour and 2 ozs. of almonds, and a few drops of essence of lemon. This will make seventeen or eighteen in small tins about three inches high. Take a little red currant jelly, melt it in a pan over the fire, and when it is a little cool put it on a plate and roll your cakes round in it; then roll them on granulated sugar. These look very nice when properly got up. 45.—Fine Rusks. Take a sponge or diet bread cake, cut it in fine thin slices, and brown it on each side. This is a very good rusk, and much in use.

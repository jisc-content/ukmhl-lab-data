78 PASTRYCOOK AND CONFECTIONER'S GUIDE. melon; then leaves, on which fix flowers of different sorts, which, if you cannot model yourself, you may procure of any working confectioner. 225.—A Sponge Cake to represent a Ripe Melon. Make a large basinful of very light icing (for instructions for making the same see page 80); then divide the icing into three basins; colour one a pale yellow-green, the next a darker green, and the third darker than the second; then lay the melon cake with the top downwards, and ice the then top with the palest green icing, putting a tinge or two of the other colours; then set it in a warm stove to dry, after which turn it and ice the top neatly with the pale green, then in parts with the second colour, and after that with the third. Care must be taken that the icing is not too thin. Let it stand in a warm stove for half an hour, after which put it in a moderate oven for five minutes, which will make it sprout a little; when cold, place a very short gum-paste stalk at one end of the same colour. 226.—To Ornament a Sponge Cake as a Pyramid. Provide a mould in the shape of a pyramid and bake a sponge cake neatly in it; or you may procure single heights, which may be much easier—that is, provide a tin rim the size of the bottom of the dish, and two or three inches deep; then procure five or six rims the same depth and the same shape, but each one an inch less, which will bring it to a very small oval. When baked, cut each one off by the tin and fix them together with a little icing; ornament each height with a handsome border, and place birds in different attitudes on the pyramid. This will make a really superb dish if ornamented with taste.

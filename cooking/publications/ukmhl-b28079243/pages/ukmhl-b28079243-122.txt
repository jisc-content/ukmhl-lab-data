96 PASTRYCOOK AND CONFECTIONER'S GUIDE. 280.—Giblets. Giblets make a very nice dish. Set them on with water thickened with flour, and a little pepper and salt, and let them stew slowly for some hours. 281.—To stew Pigeons. Take care that they are quite fresh, carefully cropped, drawn, and washed, and then soak them half an hour in water; take off the head and neck, but leave the skin to cover the place. Put a bit of butter in the breast of each, truss them like a fowl for boiling, season them with pepper and salt, and shut them close, turning the breast downwards in the stew-pan ; thicken the gravy made of the necks and pinions with flour, and let them stew slowly for about an hour or more. Turn the breast up when sent to the table. 282.—To roast Pigeons. These should be stuffed with parsley, either cut or whole, and seasoned within. Serve with parsley and butter. Peas or asparagus should be sent to table with them. 283.—Directions for dressing Game. Game should not be thrown away because it is apparently spoilt, for after being well washed and seasoned, and either stewed with a rich gravy or roasted, it will be found very delicate. 284.—Pheasants and Partridges. They are roasted like any other fowl, but without stuffing; a slice of toasted bread should be placed under each when half roasted, to catch the dripping, and sent to table on dish under them ; though some persons prefer them without the bread, bur with a little gravy in which bread has been boiled.

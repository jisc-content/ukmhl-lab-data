Take 4 lbs. of good flour, sift along with it 2 ozs. cream of Some persons add about six eggs to this quantity, and glaze with egg on top before proving. 22. —London Buns. Take 6 lbs. of flour, i lb. sugar, i lb. butter, and rather more than a pint of milk; rub the sugar fine into the flour, then put into a pan, and dissolve 3 ozs. of German yeast amongst the milk, which must be warm: mix all together; set in a warm place to rise, and when ready have your butter melted with a little more milk; add 6 eggs, mix all together, set in a warm place for half an hour, and mould the paste into small round buns. Let them prove on sheet tins, and when sufficiently proved bake in a hot oven ; after they are baked wash them over the top with milk and egg. 23. —Chelsea Buns. Take part of the dough of the above buns, roll it out and spot it over with good butter, as you would puff paste; double it up and give it a gentle roll and cut it in diamonds about 4 in. long. They must be proved a little, but not so much as Lon- don buns; or you can roll the paste into a square and cut in long strips. Wash with egg and dust sugar and currants on top; take one of the ends of the strips, form it into a round bun, and place all together (after making or rolling them round) on a square-edged tin; prove, and bake in a sound oven. 24—Bath Buns. These can be mixed the same as London buns, and baked in frames or tart tins; set them to prove when half risen, wash them over with white of egg, dust them over with sifted sugar before putting them in the oven, first damping them with a wet brush. 25.—German Buns.

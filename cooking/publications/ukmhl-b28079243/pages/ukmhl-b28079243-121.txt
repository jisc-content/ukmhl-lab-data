95 POULTRY AND GAME. If for dinner, ham, tongue, or bacon is usually served with fowls. Chickens, either roasted or boiled, should have no stuffing. The heads of chickens should be retained, but with fowls the heads are taken off. 277. —To roast Ducks. Cut off the legs and half of the wings ; stuff them with sage, and a bit of butter, pepper, and salt; skewer them nicely with small wire skewers (with which all poultry should be done). Boil the tip of the wings, gizzard, and liver for gravy*; baste them with butter, dust them with flour, like other poultry, and roast of a nice light brown. Some cooks retain the legs, and after toasting and scraping off the outer skin, turn them up the back. 278. —To stew a Duck. Put it in a stew-pan with a little gravy and a few leaves of sage cut small, and some pepper and salt. Simmer a quarter of an hour, add a little water thickened with flour, skim the liquor well, then cover up close, and let the bird simmer an hour. 279.—To roast a Goose. After it has been carefully picked, the plugs of the feathers pulled out, and the hairs carefully singed, let it be well washed and dried, and a seasoning of pepper and salt put in. Cut the wings like a duck, take off the legs, fasten the goose tight at the neck and rump, and tfien roast. Put it at first at a distance from the fire, and by degrees draw it nearer; baste it well, and be careful to serve it before the breast fall, or it will look ill if it come flat to the table. Let a good gravy be sent in the dish. Apple-sauce should also be sent to the table with it, or if a green goose gooseberry-sauce is better.

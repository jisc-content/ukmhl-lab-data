DUMPLINGS, WHIPPED CREAM, TRIFLE. 51 134.—Lemon Dumplings. Chop the rind of one lemon fine, and add the juice to it; chop up i lb. of suet, mix with i lb. of bread crumbs, 1 egg, and enough milk or water to make a stiff paste; add the lemon, sweeten to taste, and divide your paste into five equal parts; boil in separate cloths for three-quarters of an hour. Then serve with butter and sugar, or some prefer a little honey. 135.—Simple Suet Dumpling. Take 1 lb. of flour, \ lb. of chopped suet, a teaspoonful of salt, and a quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper; moisten with water until you have a stiff paste, and use when required. Dumpling paste so made may be rolled in small balls, and used in savoury pies, hash, or stews. 136. —To Whip Cream. Take the whites of 8 eggs, 1 quart of cream, and % pint of sherry; mix and sweeten them to your taste with lump sugar, first rubbing a lemon with it to procure the essence; whip it with a pure clean whisk in a flat earthen pan, and as the froth rises take it off on to a hair sieve. Let it stand as long as you can before you put it in your baskets or trifles. 137. —To make a Trifle. Provide a handsome glass and build in it a pyramid consist- ing of macaroni, ratafias, French savoys, fruit, and sponge biscuits; pour on every part a small quantity of sherry, and keep doing so till the whole is properly steeped. (Great care must be taken not to break any part). Then lay your whipped cream upon the biscuits in as romantic a manner as possible— the more it is like a rock and the higher it is the better—on the top place a sprig of myrtle, and round the sides ornament it with coloured sugar, green citron, and angelica.

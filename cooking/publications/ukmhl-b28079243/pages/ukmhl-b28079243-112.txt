86 PASTRYCOOK AND CONFECTIONER'S GUIDE. 250.—To dress a Calf’s Head. Take a calf;s head, scald the hair oft* and scrape it very clean; let it soak in cold water for some hours, then parboil it for half an hour, and keep the liquor it was boiled in ; cut the head in small pieces from the bone, take out the eye and all the meat you can get with it; keep the tongue whole, rub it with the yolk of an egg, dust it with flour, and brown it all round in butter; then add the meat, and make it as brown as you can without burning; add mixed spice with a squeeze of lemon, then add for gravy as much as you will of the liquor the head was boiled in, thickened with flour. It will take at least three hours to stew, and you cannot stew it very slow; when dished put the tongue in the middle and the hash round it; a little soy, or catsup, or fish sauce may be added, if agreeable. 251.—Joints of Pork. A leg, loin, and back ribs are the best roasting pieces. The skin should be cut in stripes an inch apart, but not deeper than the skin, and when half roasted take off every alternate stripe to admit the heat; gravy as for any other roast. A boiled leg of pork is the better for being salted for eight or ten days, and should be skinned before coming to the table; allow a quarter of an hour for every pound and half an hour over; the liquor in which it is boiled does very well for peas- soup; the leg should have peas-pudding sent to the table with it. 252.—Pork Steaks. Cut them from the loin or neck, and of middling thickness; pepper and broil them, turning them often, and when nearly done sprinkle them with salt, and serve the moment they are taken off the fire.

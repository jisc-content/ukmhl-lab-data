PREFACE. VI perspective and the laws of harmony in form and colour. I have seen other sugar-work that was simply hideous—a mon- strous and sad outrage on all true notions of art. And it is not only the preparation of his wares that calls for thoughtful study and careful attention to detail on the part of the tradesman who desires to excel and prosper. The dressing of the shop window, and the arrangement of the shop counter, are obviously things of very great importance if a good trade is to be done. The way in which confectionery and pastry should be handled when customers are served is also worthy of notice. However good the articles offered may be, and however artistic may be the devices employed in their preparation for pleasing the eye of the buyer, much of the otherwise good effect will be marred if the persons who serve are deficient in care and attention to what may be termed “ the delicacy of the situa- tion.” I would therefore caution the confectioner’s assistant to avoid, if possible, touching confectionery with the fingers, and would strongly advise the use of the scoop, the tongs, and the confectioner’s fork, which are generally to be seen in a well-ordered establishment. NOTE TO SECOND EDITION. The usefulness and acceptability of this work have been abundantly proved by the success of the first edition. Oppor- tunity has now been taken to make a few corrections which were found to be necessary, December, 1891.

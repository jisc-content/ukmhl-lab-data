ICING, ALMOND ICING, PIPING CAICES. 81 up till very light, which you may know by its rising to double the quantity : this is a certain criterion of lightness. If you want icing for cakes, you must test the stiffness by taking up a little with a spoon and dropping it on a tin plate : if it keeps its shape it is of a proper consistency to lay on cakes, but if it runs it must be made stiffer. Icing can be made without the gum-dragon, but I think its addition is a decided improvement. 234.—Almond Icing for Bride Cakes. Take i lb. of Valentia almonds and 2 lbs. of icing sugar, with 4 whites and 2 yolks of eggs; blanch and beat the almonds fine with white of egg, then add the sugar and remainder of the whites, and beat them well together until you make them into a softish paste. As soon as the cake is baked, take it out and take off the hoop and paper carefully from the sides; then put the almond icing carefully on the top of the cake, and make it as smooth as you can ; put the cake back into the oven and let it remain until the almond paste is firm enough and the colour of a macaroon; let it stand two or three hours and then ice it. 235.—Piping Cakes. Paper cones are used for piping cakes, but the handiest way is with a water-tight bag and screw with a set of tubes, which can be had of any manufacturer of bakers’ or confectioners’ utensils, or from the author of this work.

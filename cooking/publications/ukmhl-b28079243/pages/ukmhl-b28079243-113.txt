PORK,; LAMB. 87 253.—To roast a Sucking Pig. If you can get it when just killed this is of great advantage; let it be scalded—which the dealers usually do—then put some sage, crumbs of bread, salt and pepper into the belly and sew it up; lay it to a brisk fire, and when it is thoroughly dry rub it over with butter in every part; when ready cut off the head ; then—without withdrawing the spit—cut it down the back and belly, and lay it in the dish; garnish each side with the half of a head, split up; for gravy take a little of the dripping, with water that has had a bit of bread boiled in it. If very small it may be sent to the table whole with a lemon in the mouth. 254.—Lamb. A hind quarter of lamb will take about an hour and a quarter, a fore quarter not quite so long. Many people prefer the fore quarter cold. Gravy as for beef or mutton ; and when sent to the table cold, garnish with parsley. 255.—Lamb Cutlets with Spinach. Cut the steaks from the loin, and fry them. The spinach is to be stewed and put into the dish first, and then the Cutlets round it. 256.—Lamb’s Head. Soak a lamb’s head for a night in water, boil till tender, take the liver and lights and mince them pretty small, then give them a fry in a very little butter, adding a little of the gravy they were boiled in thickened with flour. Put the head in the middle of the dish and the mince round it, seasoned with salt, spice, and a little vinegar. The lights should be first parboiled with the head, but not the liver. A sheep’s head and pluck can be done the same way.

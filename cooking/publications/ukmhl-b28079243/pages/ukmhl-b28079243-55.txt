CAKES, IMPROVING STALE CAKES. 33 73.—Inside Mixture for Pound Cheese Cakes. Take 3 ozs. of butter, 3 ozs. of sugar, 3 eggs, 5 ozs. of patent flour, and proceed as directed for creaming (p. 30). 74.—Genoa Cake. (ij-. per lb.) Take 1 lb. of butter, 1 lb. of sugar, 1 lb. of eggs, lbs. of flour, 2\ lbs. of washed and picked currants, and lbs. of orange peel; proceed as for creaming; stick blanched almonds rather thickly over the top, and bake in a small edged tin in a moderate oven. 75.—Bordeaux Cake. Take some pound cake mixture without the fruit, and spread it on sheets about eight inches in diameter and a quarter of an inch thick; bake it a nice brown, and when cold trim each piece smooth and place one on the other with jam between; then pipe or ornament to your fancy. 76.—Improving Stale Cakes. Cakes which are stale may be made to appear and eat like fresh ones if treated as follows:—Take what quantity of cakes you want to operate on, and dip them one by one quickly in clean water, or take a damp cloth and wet them all over; then place them on sheet-tins and cover over with an edged sheet- tin so as to keep in all the moisture you can. Now place them in the oven, and let the heat well penetrate through them. If required, you can glaze them over as if fresh. Stale cakes thus treated—of course I am referring to fer- mented cakes—cannot be distinguished from fresh ones except by a practised baker. 77.—Queen Cakes (best). 10 ozs. butter, 10 ozs. of sugar, 10 ozs. of flour, 6 eggs, 8 ozs.

4S PASTRYCOOK AND CONFECTIONER'S GUIDE. 123.—Apricot Tart. Roll out a piece of puff paste about a quarter of an inch tfiick, then cut out a piece the size of a pudding plate; lay this on a clean sheet tin, wet the edge of this with the paste brush and an egg \ then place round it a border, one inch wide; ornament the border to make it look stylish; prick over the paste to prevent it blistering; sugar over with castor sugar, and bake a nice golden brown colour in a moderate oven. (See that it is properly baked : if not, it will fall when taken from the oven, and prove a failure at the dinner-table.) Then take one dozen apricots—not too ripe—cut them in halves, break the stones, and blanch the kernels, by placing them in boiling water for a few minutes. Place in a clean stew-pan half a pint of cold water, 12 ozs. of castor sugar, and the juice of 1 lemon, and let this come to a simmer to dissolve the sugar; then place in the apricots, and let them simmer very slowly for about five minutes, placing the kernels in also for the flavour; take them out very carefully on to a dish; reduce the liquor by boiling to a thick syrup, and then add a wineglassful of sherry. Place the apricots nicely round the tart, filling it all over inside the border, pour the syrup over, place a kernel in between every other apricot, then a crystallised cherry, and ornament the border with a little red currant jelly. This is very suitable for large hotels, as it is served cold and can be made at leisure. 124.—Apple Dumpling. Take 2 lbs. of flour and % lb. of butter; rub the butter into the flour quite fine, mix with cold water, then roll out the paste; have apples pared and cut in pieces, and lay them in the middle of the paste; add as much sugar as will sweeten them, and a spoonful of water; wet the paste well round the edges with cold water, and gather it nicely in the centre.

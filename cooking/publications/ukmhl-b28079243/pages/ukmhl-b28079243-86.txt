60 PASTRYCOOK AND CONFECTIONER'S GUIDE. 158.—To Freeze Ices. If only one sort of ice, set the freezing pot in a small upright pail with two bottoms, &c. If two or three sorts, set your pots at a proper distance in the long pail; fill up the space with ice well beaten, mix with it three or four handfuls of salt, and press both ice and salt well down ; then take a clean cloth and make the tops of the pots clear of ice and salt; take off the tops and put into each the creams or waters previously mixed for them, taking care that the pots are not more than half full; then replace the top to each pot, draw the tub a little to one side, and turn each pot as quickly as possible. If you have two pots, turn one with each hand; if three, let one stand alter- nately. When you have turned the pots ten minutes, take off the tops and scrape the frozen cream down from each with an ice spoon; if the cream appears hard and “flinty” you may conclude it is not mixed rich enough; if on the other hand it does not freeze, it is over rich, and in either case it must be rectified. If right, proceed as before directed, and every ten minutes scrape down. When the cream in the pots appears nearly frozen, keep off the covers and work well with the ice spoon, making the pots turn round in the ice; this will make the cream both smooth and light. As soon as it appears pretty stiff, put on the tops and cover the pots well up with more ice and salt, until you have prepared your moulds to receive it. It may be necessary to remark here that you must have an ice spoon for each pot, or if using one spoon only, you must be careful'to wash it every time, to prevent a mixture of tastes. Another caution which you must always keep in mind when preparing ices, is that if the mixture is too poor it will freeze so hard and “ flinty ” that it cannot be used; and, on the other hand, if too rich it will not freeze at alb

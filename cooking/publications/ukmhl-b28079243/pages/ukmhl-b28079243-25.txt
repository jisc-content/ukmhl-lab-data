INTRODUCTION. 5 Mr. Richard Bannister showed, in his lectures at the Society of Arts, how a legitimate endeavour on the part of chemists to produce artificial butter from animal fat led to the production of butterine and oleomargarine. The compounds as first made were really in all their chemical constituents the exact counter- parts of butter made from cream in the churn, but they soon got into the hands of the adulterants, and became a curious mixture.

This fraud gives the flour a fine appearance, rendering it whiter, and enables the dealer to pass off inferior qualities at the price of a superior article. The consumer, of course, is liable to the miseries of lead-poisoning, but this is a trifling matter to the fraudulent manufacturer. If our own Government were to give their attention in a serious and forcible way to the adulterated commodities which are allowed to be consumed by the nation, it would go a long way to make a healthier, and happier, and a more contented people. Yeast. Yeast is an item of great importance to the pastrycook. Yeast of the German and French kind is now made in England and Scotland, and I am myself using at the present time yeast of English make. One could not desire better, and it can be

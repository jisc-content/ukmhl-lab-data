ALMOND FILBERTS, ROCK ALMONDS. 27 wish to colour ratafias use lake finely ground. Lay out with a knife and wood spoon. 53. Another way.—Beat your almonds fine as before di- rected ; whisk up stiff such number of whites of eggs as you expect will be wanted; add the sugar, and beat all well with the spatter until the mixture appears quite light, which you may know by its rising in the pan; then add the almond in a mortar and mix the whole together; if too stiff add more white. This is a very excellent way if you have time. 54.—Almond Filberts. Take 1 lb. of Valentia almonds, 1 lb. of scorched sugar, and about 2 yolks of eggs. Blanch and beat the almonds very fine with yolk of egg, mix in the sugar and yolks, and beat them into a smooth paste with the pestle; roll the paste out thin and cut it out with a proper cutter in lengths, then cut it so as to leave three points on each side, place a small almond on the middle point and one opposite (being previously made wet with yolk of egg and water); roll them up and put two across each other and one on the top, which will form a filbert; work up all your paste in this way, place the filbert on a clean iron plate or tin dusted with flour; bake in a slow oven. A proper cutter for filberts must be made of tin in a zigzag shape, with nine points on each side; when the paste is cut by it, it will make three nuts. 55.—Rock Almonds (White). Blanch and cut the long way any quantity of almonds you please ; make some icing pretty stiff, put the almonds into it, and let them take up all the icing; you may also add citron, lemon, and orange cut small; lay out on wafer paper in small heaps, and bake in a very slow oven.

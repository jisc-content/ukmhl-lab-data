There is no doubt that this book is one of the most useful of its kind published, and will be a very popular compendium.”—Engineer. “ A mass of information, set down in simple language, and in such a form that it can be easily referred to at any time. The matter is uniformly good and well chosen, and is greatly elucidattd by the illustrations.

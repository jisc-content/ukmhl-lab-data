BISCUITS, MERINGUES. 23 eggs, dipped on crushed sugar the size of peas; bake in a moderate oven. 40.—Rose Biscuits. Split some small blanched almonds; model a few biscuits of the Lilly paste about the size of a marble; then stick six of the almonds into the modelled paste, and drop a little icing in the centre of the biscuits; let them stand one hour in a warm place, and then bake in a slow oven. When baked touch each almond with a small brush dipped in lake. 41.—Syringe Biscuits. Take 1 lb. of Venetia almonds, 2 lbs. of scorched sugar, and about 6 whites of eggs; blanch and beat the almonds very fine with white of eggs, and then rub in the sugar with two or three whites as may be required to make a fine smooth paste; put it through the jumball mould and make several different shapes, such as Prince of Wales’s feathers, fleur de lis, or a small ring with icing in the middle, and a dried cherry in the icing. This will make a neat biscuit; bake on dry paper in a slow oven. 42.—Orange or Lemon Biscuits. Take 1 lb. of Yalentia almonds, 2 lbs. of sugar, 7 or 8 whites of eggs, and the rind of 1 Seville and 2 China oranges grated; blanch and beat the almonds very fine with white of egg, add the sugar and whites, and make a paste of the same stiffness as ratafias; put in the grated orange-peel, and beat well with the spatter; then lay out on dry paper the size of ratafias, and bake in a slow oven. Lemon biscuits are made in the same way, substituting grated lemon rind for orange. 43.—Meringues or Meringles. Take any quantity you please of whites of eggs—half of them

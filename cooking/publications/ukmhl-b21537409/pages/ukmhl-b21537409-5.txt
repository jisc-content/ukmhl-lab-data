A Point to Remember. The words “ Liebig’s Extract ” carry with them no guarantee of purity—anything can be sold under that name in the British Empire. Only by specifying “ Lemco ” can absolute purity be ensured. The cattle used for “ Lemco ” are the progeny of fine British pedigree stock, and such pre- cautions are taken that any deviation from its uniform purity and goodness is impossible. Think of the economy and convenience of Lemco; what a splendid scope and variety it provides in the kitchen ! Thousands of cooks have made their reputations on it.

72 Goose. Oie, f. The goose is an aquatic bird which has long been domesticated in nearly all parts of the world. The geese that saved the Roman Capitol by cackling at the critical moment had a worthy successor in the goose that made a Bishop, if we may believe the legend which tells how, when St. Martin was hiding in his desire not to be made Bishop of Tours, one of these birds found and betrayed him. Gooseberry. Groseille, f. The fruit of a prickly shrub indi- genous to Great Britain. The word is taken from the Scotch “ Grosart.” Gooseberry Fool. A half-frozen fruit pulp, served as sweet. The name is a corruption of “ gooseberry foul ” (foule), meaning milled or pressed gooseberries. This dish is very popular, but its name is often puzzling, and may be regarded as an example of the degeneration of a foreign kitchen term, a corruption which has destroyed the descriptive meaning. Originally the qualifying adj ective was written foule because the stewed gooseberries were crushed and pressed before being mixed with the cream. Gorgonzola. An Italian cheese. (See Cheese.)

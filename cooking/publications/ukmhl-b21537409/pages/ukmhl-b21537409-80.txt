76 Haggis. A kind of liver sausage (Scotch dish), derived from “ Hag,” to chop ; or “ Hachis,” to mince. The modern haggis consists of the liver, lights, and heart of a sheep finely chopped, mixed with oatmeal, and suet, and seasoning. This is inserted in a sheep’s paunch, and boiled for several hours. Robert Burns greatly esteemed this dish, which was, it is said, a favourite dish of the Romans. Hake. A kind of sea-fish allied to the cod. Halaszle. A Hungarian fish stew. Halibut.

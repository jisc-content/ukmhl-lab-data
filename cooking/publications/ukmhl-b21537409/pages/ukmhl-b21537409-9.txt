PREFACE. A few years ago I compiled a Culinary Encyclopaedia for the benefit of Cookery Students. This little book has been found most useful, but it has been out of print for some time, and being assured that there is a great need for a reference book of this kind, I have made a more serious attempt by compiling the present volume, which I hope will serve a practical purpose to Hotel and Restaurant keepers. Stewards, Chefs, Students of Cookery, House- keepers, and others interested in food and cookery matters. The primary object of this book is to show the reader at a glance the meaning of words applied to food, drink, and cooking, with brief descriptive matter which is deemed advisable to furnish in concise form. As its title explains, this book is intended to serve as a dictionary of foods, culinary technical terms, food and cookery auxiliaries, condiments and beverages, which include many foreign names and terms which are in every-day use in connection with menus and recipes, all of which have been translated. In short, every subject connected with the table, cuisine, and gastronomy, has been judiciously treated, and so-called technicalities have been rendered intelligible. Although this small volume is not perfect, nor can it be claimed to be a complete treatise of the multifarious food vocabulary, it is as far as my knowledge goes the most complete work of its kind, and I trust that by its help most of, if not all, the difficult questions will be answered, and that it will form a useful manual of reference.

Smoked or dried haddock —merluche fume, f. The haddock is a fish measuring ten to twelve inches in length, and seldom weighing more than two or three pounds. It is distinguished by a dark spot on either side of the body, just beyond the gills. There is a super- stition connected with these spots, suggesting that they are marks left by the thumb and forefinger of St. Peter when taking tribute money out of the mouth of a fish of this species. The haddock is found chiefly on the north-east coast; and in winter, migrating in large numbers from these latitudes, it arrives on the coast of Yorkshire.

Ox-tail soup is said to have been discovered as follows: During the Reign of Terror in Paris, in 1793, many of the nobility were reduced to starvation and beggary. The abbatoirs sent their hides fresh to the tanneries without removing the tails, and in cleaning them the tails were thrown away. One of these noble beggars asked for a tail, which was willingly given him; he took it to his lodgings and made—what is now famous—the first dish of ox-tail soup. He told others of his good luck, and they annoyed the tanners so much that a price was put on ox-tails. Oyster. Huitre, f.

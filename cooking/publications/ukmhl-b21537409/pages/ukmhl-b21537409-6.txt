' \ When buying CornFlour, Remember this. Brown & Poison’s “Patent” Corn Flour is the product of 50 years of expert manu- facturing, and marks the standard in point of flavour, purity, and concentrated strength. This Corn Flour goes so much farther and serves you so much better than others that, even although it is a trifle higher in cost, it is often cheapest in the end. Remember Brown & Poison’s “ Patent” and refuse substitutes. A Plain Statement. Very light cakes and pastry, pie-crusts, and suet puddings are made by adding one part of “Paisley Flour” (Trade Mark) to eight parts of the household flour. Test its Accuracy. It costs you so little to try. Get from your Grocer a id., 3^d., or 7d. packet of “Paisley Flour.” The id. packet contains enough for a pound of flour.

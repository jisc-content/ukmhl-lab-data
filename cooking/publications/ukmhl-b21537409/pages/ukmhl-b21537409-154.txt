150 White Stew. Blanquette, f. Whiting. Merlans, f. Seasonable March to August. This fish is very delicate, and easily digested. It seldom exceeds a pound and a half in weight, or ten or twelve inches in length. In the winter it swarms in large shoals within three miles of the shore for the purpose of depositing its spawn. In the winter time this fish is sometimes sold under the peculiar name of “ buckhorn,” which is simply the ordinary whiting caught in Cornwall, salted and dried. Widgeon. Sarcelle, f. Seasonable October to February. The widgeon belongs to the same family as the wild duck. It is a native of the northern regions of Europe and Asia. Early in March they begin their Polar migration. Wiener Schnitzel, g. A favourite Viennese dish of veal cutlets, garnished with fried yolks of eggs, anchovy fillets, etc., often served with sauerkraut. Wild Boar. Sanglier, f. The flesh of the wild boar is finer than that of the pig. It is found in the forests and marsh lands of the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. The wild boar seeks its food at night, feeding on roots which it digs up with its snout. Where truffles abound, its flesh obtains a peculiarly delicate flavour. Wild Duck. Canard sauvage, f. This bird is also called the mallard, and is highly esteemed for the table. It is distinguished from the tame duck by the colour of its feet being red, while those of the tame duck are yellow. Wild Goose. The flesh of the wild goose has a more gamey flavour than that of the domesticated bird. Woodcock. Coq du bruyere, f. Seasonable October to Decem- ber. This bird is celebrated for the exquisite flavour of its flesh. It should be cooked without being drawn, the trail being considered by epicures a great delicacy. When the spring change of plumage commences, the bird loses its delicacy. The woodcock is a native of the northern latitudes of Europe and Asia. Wood Pigeon. These birds should be hung for a few days. They may be cooked as ordinary pigeons.

TEMPTING DISHES. 41 Norfolk Dumplings. Purchase a few muffins from the baker, boil them for twenty minutes in water, and serve with sweet sauce. Orange Fool. Take 'six oranges, and extract the juice, and mix it with one and a half pints of milk (or one pint of cream), two eggs beaten till light, sugar to taste, and about a teaspoonful of cornflour mixed till smooth. Stir this all over a slow fire till as thick as good custard. Another way is to mix the juice of six or eight oranges, and the strained fruit, with two tablespoonfuls of condensed milk, and serve cold. Orange Meringue Pudding. Pour half a pint of milk over a couple of ounces of bread-crumbs, and let them soak till cold. Beat up the yolks of two eggs till light; add two ounces of pounded sugar, and the grated rind of four oranges. Cut away all the white pith and press the pulp of the oranges through a wire sieve. Add the orange-pulp and bread to the sugar, break it up in pieces, and stir in half an ounce of fresh butter. Beat up the whites of the eggs to a stiff snow, mix lightly half the whites into the mix- ture, pour into a buttered pudding-dish, pile the remainder roughly on the top, dredge on some finely powdered sugar, and bake the pudding in a slow oven for three-quarters of an hour, when it should be of a pale golden colour. When the pudding is half baked, lay a sheet of paper on the top to prevent scorching.

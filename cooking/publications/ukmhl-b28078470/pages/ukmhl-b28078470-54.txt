TEMPTING DISHES. 42 Orange Pudding. Take the rind of three oranges and the juice of six, a cup of powdered sugar, and four eggs, one large tablespoonful of cornflour, and a pint of milk. Mix the cornflour with the milk. Stir it in a milk saucepan, add the thin rind of the oranges. When the milk begins to thicken, add the yolks of the eggs very carefully one at a time, then add a little salt and the juice of the oranges. Cook the pudding in a moderate oven till firm in the centre—it takes about forty minutes—remove the rind before the pudding is put into the oven. Whip the whites of the eggs up with a little orange- juice and two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, cover the pudding, and let it cook in a moderate oven, with the door open a little. Serve the pudding cold. Pear Croquettes. Peel, core, and chop fine or grate six large ripe pears. Mix two ounces of fresh butter, melted, with them, and sugar to taste ; beat up three eggs until light, add to the fruit, and mix in as large a quantity of fine bread-crumbs as will make the mixture stiff. From this mixture mould the cro- quettes into egg-shaped form with two tablespoons, drop these into boiling water, and let them merely simmer till they are done—about twenty minutes —drain them, roll each in pounded sugar, lay them on a hot napkin, and place a very little ground cin- namon on the top of each croquette. Serve up very hot with or without sweet sauce.

PREFACE. vii self use the corrugated iron saucepans ; they wear out so constantly, and the generality of cooks knock them about so that they soon become unusable, and they can never be relined, and are therefore unwhole- some. Upon all matters of cookery I shall be very pleased to give advice, and to explain any of the recipes in any of my books which may present difficulties to the cook, on receipt of a stamped directed envelope ; and if I can help the fine art of cookery, which cookery has become, by so doing I shall indeed have achieved a success. HARRIET A. DE SALIS. Hampton Lea, Sutton, July 1890.

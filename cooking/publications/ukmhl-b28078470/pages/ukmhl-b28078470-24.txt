Put the mixture into small well- buttered cups or moulds, bake in a moderate oven for twenty minutes, then turn out and garnish with sprigs of fresh parsley and serve with or without horseradish sauce. Boned Leg of Mutton. After removing the bone from the mutton make some parsley forcemeat with bread-crumbs, a little lean bacon, two shalots, and fill up the hole where the bone was taken from, cut away any extra fat, and sew it up. Bind it and tie up compactly and roast with great care. Remove the binding and serve with good thick brown gravy. Calf’s Brains and Black Butter. Soak the brains in vinegar and water and put in a little piece of thyme. Fry some round pieces of bread for about twenty minutes. Place some of the brains, after draining them, on each piece of fried bread, make a little hole in each piece of brain and place a piece of red tongue in each. Pour black butter over and serve. The black butter is made by taking one ounce of butter and melting it in a frying- pan till it turns a rich brown colour, then add half a teaspoonful of chopped capers, half a teaspoonful of Harvey sauce, and the same quantity of mushroom catsup and a little pepper. This can be used thickened if preferred. Calf’s Head Fritters. Cut some slices from a calf’s head (cold) and mask with tomato sauce, dip them into batter and fry a nice golden colour. Serve crisped parsley as a garnish.

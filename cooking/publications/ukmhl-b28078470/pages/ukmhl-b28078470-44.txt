TEMPTING DISHES. 32 of mustard to a paste and gradually adding vinegar enough to make half a cupful. When mixed add two tablespoonfuls of olive oil and beat the whole very thoroughly.

Take three ounces of flour, two eggs, a little over a gill of milk, two ounces of beef dripping, quarter of an ounce of Cowanâ€™s baking-powder; mix the flour, eggs, milk, and baking-powder to- gether ; add a pinch of salt; put the dripping into a baking-tin, and place it in the oven to get hot; then pour in the batter and cook either in front of the fire under meat which is being roasted, or else in a quick oven. In the oven it takes from fifteen to twenty minutes to cook, but much longer if put under the meat.

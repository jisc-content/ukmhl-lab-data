PUDDINGS AND PASTRY 24 fine with half a pound of apples pared and cored. Mix well together; add two or three drops of essence of lemon, and four ounces of powdered sugar. Line some patty-pans with puff-paste, dust a little on the top, and bake. Diplomatique Pudding. Take a plain round pudding-mould, and pour in half a pint of calfâ€™s-foot jelly, and keep turning the mould round and round, to coat it with jelly, and then stand it on ice a few moments, decorate it then with preserved cherries, chopped pistachio- nuts and angelica, sticking them on with a little jelly. When this is done, cut up two or three apricots, two or three slices of pineapple, and about two dozen glace cherries ; take some sponge- cakes, cut them in two longways, spread a little preserve on each, and cut each into four pieces. Have ready a rich custard, highly flavoured with noyeau, then put into the mould a little of the chopped fruit, and then the cut-up sponge-cakes ; add a few ratafias, and pour about a wine-glassful of the custard over. When this is set, proceed with the fruit, and so on till the mould is full. It should be made standing in or on ice. Serve the following sauce : boil a pot of currant jelly in an equal quantity of water, very slowly, place a few cherries in it, and put this on the ice to freeze. Dolly Varden Pudding. Cover the mould with different coloured jelly, and light jelly on the top, and set it to get cold.

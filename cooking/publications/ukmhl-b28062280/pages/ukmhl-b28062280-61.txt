49 A LA MODE. Raspberry Custard. Take half a pint of ripe raspberries, pass them through a sieve, mix it into a pint of milk in which a dessert-spoonful of corn flour free from lumps has been stirred, beat a large egg, thoroughly mix it with the other ingredients, and set the whole in a stew-pan to boil; it must be constantly stirred. Ratafia Pudding. Make a rich custard in the usual way, flavoured with a tablespoonful of brandy. Have a pudding- mould buttered, and decorate it thickly with pre- served cherries, and candied peel, and citron ; fill it with ratafias and a crumbled sponge-cake, and cherries, and peel, alternately in layers. Pour the custard over, and then steam the mould for three- quarters of an hour. Ravensworth Pudding. Bake three large apples and pulp them ; add one pint of cream, two handfuls of bread-crumbs, half a pound of pounded loaf-sugar, the grated rind of two lemons, the yolks of four eggs, and the beaten whites of six ; beat all together, but putting the whites of egg last. Butter a pudding-mould, shake in a few bread-crumbs, and roll them round, so that they may adhere to the sides, and then shake out all that remain loose ; now pour in the mixture and bake an hour and a half. Serve with arrow- root sauce with rum in it. E

PREFACE. In bringing out, according to the request of many of my readers, ‘ Puddings and Pastry,’ with a com- panion volume, ‘Cakes and Confections,’ I finish my a la mode series of Cookery Books. These two latter, like my former books, have been carefully selected from old family recipes and demonstration lessons, and the kind assistance of gastronomic writers. Some are very old recipes, but I trust they will be none the less acceptable and palatable on that account. One or two are original. HARRIET A. DE SALIS. Hampton Lea, Sutton : 1889.

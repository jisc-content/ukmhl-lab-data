58 PUDDINGS AND PAStRY Tipsy Puddings. Beat up for ten minutes four eggs, freed from the speck, and four ounces of castor sugar, into which gradually mix four ounces of Vienna flour. Warm some college-pudding moulds, and roll liquefied butter round them, so that they are equally buttered, and pour off any superfluous butter, and then quickly powder in some castor sugar and turn them round to get a coating of sugar all over, and shake out any superfluity of it. Fill the moulds with the egg mixture and bake from twenty to twenty-five minutes in a slow oven. When cooked turn out the puddings, and melt three tablespoonfuls of loaf- sugar in half a tumbler of old rum. Put the puddings on the dish and pour the rum mixture over, and strew chopped pistachio-kernels over the top, and a preserved cherry on the top of each, and serve cold. Tomato Tart. Take a pound of tomatoes, skin and cut them into slices and lay them in a tart-dish, and sift over them some powdered ginger and salt; then make a tomato puree of tomatoes, the juice of a lemon, some sugar to taste, and one well-beaten egg; mix all together, then add in a couple of table- spoonfuls of cream and pour over the stewed tomatoes, and put on the crust and bake. Turret Puddings. Take two eggs, add their weight in flour, also in butter and sugar ; melt the butter, add flour and sugar, beat up the eggs, pour in and beat thoroughly;

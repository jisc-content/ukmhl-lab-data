PUDDINGS AND PASTRY 56 Strawberry Tartlets. Line some tartlet-tins with puff-paste. Pinch the edge of the paste a little higher than the tin and place a dummy of baked paste and flour in the centre of each tartlet; bake them, remove the dummies, and sift a little castor sugar over, and salamander them. Have ready sufficient straw- berries, with the stalks removed, in a basin, and pour on them some boiling syrup made by boiling half a pound of lump sugar in a gill of water; directly the syrup has been poured over the strawberries cover them with paper, which must be turned over the edge of the basin to keep in the heat and steam. Let them remain thus for an hour, then strain the syrup off and boil it up, and thicken with a little arrowroot mixed with a very little cold water, and which must be stirred in when the syrup is boiling ; add a few drops of cochineal ; when thick enough pour the syrup over the strawberries, let them stand a little, and then fill the tartlet-cases well up. Cherries, gooseberries, apricots, etc., can all be used for these tartlets. Sutton Pudding-.

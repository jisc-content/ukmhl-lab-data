Next roll the crust out square and of sufficient size to enclose the butter, flatten this a little in the centre, and fold the crust well over, and roll it out thin as lightly as possible ; this is one turn ; then fold it in three and give it another turn, and set it aside to cool for a few minutes ; give it two more turns in the same way, rolling it each time very lightly, but of equal thickness, and to its full length; let it again be put aside to get cold, and after it has been twice rolled and folded in three, give it half a turn by folding it once only, and it will be ready for baking. Flaky Crust. Put one pound of flour in a basin, and mix into it a teaspoonful of baking powder ; whip the whites of two eggs to a stiff froth, and add them to the flour with a gill of water, and work it into a stiff paste ; flour the board, put the paste on it, and roll it out to a very thin sheet. Divide half a pound of butter into three portions ; take one part and spread it all over the paste with a knife, sprinkle a little flour over and fold the paste in three; roll it out and spread another portion of the butter over it; fold the paste again, and add the remaining portion of the butter ; fold the paste again and roll it out to the thickness required ; it should be baked in a quick oven for about fifteen minutes. Light Crust. Make a soft paste with one pound of flour, water, and a pinch of salt; leave for half an hour.

Strawberry Meringue Pudding. Line a dish with puff-paste; at the bottom of the dish spread a layer of strawberry jam; pour in a custard made with two ounces of butter stirred over a fire till quite smooth, adding gradually half a pint of milk and one ounce of sugar ; when it is thick (it must not boil) turn it into a basin, and when nearly cold add the yolks of two eggs; put this on the jam and bake one hour ; whip the whites of the eggs quite stiff with a tablespoonful of castor sugar, and put on the top ten minutes before sending to table.

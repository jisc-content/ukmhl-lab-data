PUDDINGS AND PASTRY 12 round the bottom of a dish, lay in a roll of the bread and butter, and strew over a handful of currants and a few raisins ; add some little bits of butter, and do so till your dish is full, then boil one pint of cream, and thicken it when cold with the yolks of three large eggs, a little grated nut- meg, a pinch of salt, two ounces of sugar, and a few drops of orange-flower water, which pour in fresh as the pudding is going to the oven. Bread Cheesecakes. Slice a penny loaf as thin as possible, pour on it half a pint of boiling cream, and let it stand for two hours ; take four eggs, a quarter of a pound of butter, and half a nutmeg, grated ; beat these in- gredients all well together, and mix them into the cream and bread with a quarter of a pound of currants, well washed and dried, add a small spoonful of brandy, and bake them in patty-pans. Bread Fritters. Take half a pound of Vienna bread, crumble it small, and let it steep in a pint of boiling milk for a quarter of an hour. Then beat it up with a fork till quite smooth ; add two whole eggs well beaten up, half a wine-glassful of brandy, half an ounce of butter, and a little sugar and salt. This must be thoroughly well mixed and beaten up. Butter an enamel frying-pan, pour the mix- ture in, and allow it to fry gently. When one side is done toss it over and fry the other. Arrange them in layers, cut them into four, and serve; send castor sugar and lemon to table with them.

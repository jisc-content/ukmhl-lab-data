A LA MODE. 5 hot basin ready, and pour the souffle into it, and put the basin in a stewpan of boiling water till the egg is set and firm. Make a custard with the three yolks, flavour it with cinnamon, and pour round the Dudding and serve. Apple and Tapioca Pudding. Line the edges of a pie-dish with paste; then put in a layer of peeled, cored, and sliced apples with a little sugar and a few cloves ; then a layer of tapioca which has been in soak for some hours ; then place another layer of apples, and then a layer of tapioca till the dish is full; cover with paste and bake in rather a quick oven. Apple Tartlets with Cream. Pare, core, and finely chop two large sharp apples ; add to them two ounces of Savoy biscuits rubbed through a fine sieve; add a grate of nut- meg, a gill of cream, and sugar to taste; then add the yolks of five eggs and two whites well beaten. Put this mixture into patty-pans lined with puff- paste, sift white sugar over them, and bake. Apricot Fritters. Take a tin of the Climax tinned apricots. Drain away the syrup ; then cover the apricots with finely powdered sugar, and dip them into batter and fry in very hot fat. Arrange them on a dish and sprinkle sugar over them. Pine-apple fritters should be made the same way.

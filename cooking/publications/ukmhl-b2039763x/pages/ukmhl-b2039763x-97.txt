91 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. SOUR KROUT 167. Six heads of cabbage. Half a gill of salt. Wash the cabbages nicely, line the tub with the outer leaves, and sprinkle over a little of the salt. Cut the cabbages very fine, and put in a la} er of cabbage and a sprinkle of salt until the whole is in. Each layer of cabbage must be well pounded down with a heavy pestle. Cover the top with cabbage leaves and a little more salt. Spread over the whole a clean cloth, and then a board to fit closely, with a weight to press the cabbage down. As soon as fermentation ceases, take off the board and cloth, wash them well, and replace them. The sour krout will now be fit for use. BOILED SOUR KROUT. 168. One quart of sour krout.

260 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. POACHED SGGJ-S. 51S. Have a broad shallow vessel of boiling water. Break your eggs in a plate, and be care- ful not to break the yelks. Take the water from the fire, slide the eggs carefully into it one at a time, and then put them over the fire again. Whilst they are boiling thro\v the water over the yelks with a spoon, and as soon as the whites are thick take them out with an egg slice. Trim them neatly and send them to the table hot. PLAIN OMELETTE. 519. Beat four eggs very light. Have ready a pan of hot butter, pour the beaten eggs into it, and fry it till it is of a fine brown on the under side, then lap one half over the other, and serve it hot. Just before you lap it, sprinkle a little salt and pepper over the top. Chopped parsley or onion may be mixed with the egg before it is fried. HAM OMELETTE. 520. Whisk four eggs very light, and add to it as much grated ham as will flavor it. Fry it in hot butter till it is brown on the lower side. Sprin- kle salt and pepper over it, and fold one half over the other. The salt should not be put in the egg, as it thins it. Garnish the dish with green parsley.

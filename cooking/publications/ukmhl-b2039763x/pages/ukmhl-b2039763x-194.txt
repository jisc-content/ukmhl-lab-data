188 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. Two tea spoonsful of grated nutmeg, A wine-glass of brandy. Beat the butter and sugar till ligbt and creamy; whisk the eggs till they are thick. Stir the eggs into the butter and sugar, by degrees, alternately with the flour. Add gradually the spice and liquor. Beat the whole very hard for fifteen mi- nutes. Line your pan with paper well buttered ; pour in the mixture and bake it in a moderate oven for about three hours. When the edges appear to leave the sides of the pan the cake is nearly done. This cake is very good, but the spice gives it a dark color. Leave out the spice if you would have your cake a handsome color. COCOA-NUT POUND CAKE. 367. One pound of butter. One pound of flour.

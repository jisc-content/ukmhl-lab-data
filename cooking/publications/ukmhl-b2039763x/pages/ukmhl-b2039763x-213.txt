One pound of dried currants, Tw^o table spoonsful of cinnamon, A pint of sponge. As much flour as will form a dough. Make a sponge the evening before you wish to bake the cake, of a tea cupful and a half of milk, and as much flour stirred into it as will form a thick batter, with a little salt, and one gill of good yeast. In the morning this sponge should be light. Then beat the butter and sugar together, add the cinna- mon, currants and sponge, with flour enough to form a dough. Butter a pan, and when it is light, bake it in an oven about as hot as for bread.

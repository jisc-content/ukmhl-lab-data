THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 238 staml alone, and add gradually half a tea spoonful of white sugar; pile the white on the top of the milk and serve as before. SUGARED ORANGE. 457. Select the lightest colored oranges for this purpose, as they are more acid than the dark. Peel off the rind and slice them, latitudinally or cross- wise, about the eighth of an inch in thickness. Strew over them some powdered white sugar, in the proportion of a tea spoonful of sugar to each slice. Let them stand fifteen minutes. They are very palatable in fevers, as they serve to cleanse the mouth and keep it cool. SUGARED LEMONS, No. 1. 458. These may be prepared in the same man- ner as the sugared oranges (see above,) only they should have a tea spoonful and a half of sugar to each slice; as they are more firm than oranges, they require to stand longer to become perfectly impregnated with the sugar. They are better to stand about an hour before they are to be eaten. The w^hite skin should be carefully peeled off, as it imparts an unpleasant bitter flavor when permitted to remain long in the sugar. These are very grateful to the sick and feverish.

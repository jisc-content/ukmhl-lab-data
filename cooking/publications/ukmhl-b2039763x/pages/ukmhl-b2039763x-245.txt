THE NATIONAL COOK SOOK. §39 SUGARED LEMONS, No. 2. 459. Select fine large lemons. Peel off the Outer skin and as much as possible of the white skin. Cut them in slices latitudinally or round the lemon, about the eight of an inch thick. Sprinkle them with white powdered sugar, a tea spoonful of sugar to each slice. Let them stand three hours, then strain off as much of the juice as possible from the lemons, put it in a sauce-pan over a slow fire, and as soon as the juice begins to simmer throw in the slices of lemon. Let them cook five minutes, take them out and pour the syrup over them. Should the lemons not prove sufficiently juicy to melt the sugar entirely, a little water may be added* MULLED WINE. 460. Half a pint of wine, Half a pint of water, One egg. Sugar and nutmeg to the taste* Mix the wine and w^ater together—^let it boil. Beat the eggs in a pan, pour them into the wine, then quickly pour the whole from one vessel into another five or six times. MULLED CIDER, 461. One pint of cider.

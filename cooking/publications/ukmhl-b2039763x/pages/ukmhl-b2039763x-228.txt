222 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK, CALF'S FOOT JELLY. 421, To one set of feet pour three quarts of water. Let it boil till reduced to one half, then strain the liquor through a jelly bag and stand it away to get cold. When it is cold scrape off the cake of fat, and in order to cleanse the jelly from all the grease wipe the surface with a damp spunge, also the sides of the vessel which contains it. Cut up the jelly and put it in your preserving kettle, but be careful not to take the sediment which settles at the bottom. To each pint of this jelly add half a pound of the very best white sugar, and a quarter of an ounce of Russian isinglass dissolved in warm water^ one tea cupful of Madeira wine, and the juice and rind of two lemons. When the sugar is dissolved set the kettle over the fire and boil it for twenty minutes. Then pour it into your jelly bag and let it drip but do not squeeze the bag. As soon as it has all dripped through turn the bag, scrape it well but do not wash it, and strain your jelly again. Repeat this till it is perfectly clear. Pour it in the moulds while it is warm and let them stand open till the jelly is cold. When you wish to turn it out of the moulds wring a napkin out of hot water and wrap it round the moulds for a minute or two, then turn the moulds upside down, and the jelly will turn out.

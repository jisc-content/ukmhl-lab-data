THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 225 STRAWBERRY JELLY. 426. Stem the strawberries, put them in a pan, and with a w^ooden spoon or potato masher rub them fine. Put a sieve over a pan, and inside of the sieve spread a piece of thin muslin; strain the juice through this, and to a pint add one pound of sugar, with a quarter of an ounce of isinglass dis- solved in water to every five pounds of sugar. When the sugar is dissolved set the kettle over the fire and boil it till it is to a jelly. Pour it into glasses while it is warm, and paste them when cold. CURRANT JELLY. 427. Mash your fruit with a wooden spoon, and squeeze the juice through your jelly bag. To every pint of juice allow a pound of w^hite sugar. When the sugar is dissolved, add a piece of isin- glass dissolved in w^arm water to clarify the jelly. A quarter of an ounce of isinglass to five pints of juice will be sufficient. Boil and skim it till a jelly is formed ; then take it off the fire and put it in glasses while warm. The next day put brandy paper over them and paste them. Black currant jelly is made in the same w^ay, only it requires but three-quarters of a pound of sugar to a pint of juice.

201 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. One drop of essence of lemon. As much powdered sugar as will thicken the eggs. Whisk the whites to a dry frothy then add the powdered sugar, a tea spoonful at a time, till the egg is as thick as very thick batter. Wet a sheet of white paper, place it on a tin, and drop the egg and sugar on it in lumps about the shape and size of a walnut. Set them in a cool oven, and as soon as the sur- face is hardened take them out; with a broad bladed knife, take them off the paper, place the flat parts of two together, put them on a sieve in a very cool oven to dry.

T^HE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 289 One large table spoonful of brandy, One table spoonful of rose water. Beat the butter and sugar to a cream, whisk the eggs well, and stir the whole together, add gradu- ally the liquor, spices and flour. Beat the mixture for several minutes, butter some small round tin pans, fill them about three parts full and bake them. Queen cakes are very nice with a few dried cur- rants in them. To the above quantity one pound and a half of dried currants would be sufficient. THE END. 2ยง

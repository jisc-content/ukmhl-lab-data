264 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK* TO PREPARE S-AL-^RATUS. 528. Put the salseratus in a vesselj add enough cold water to dissolve it, then pour off the liquid into a bottle and cork it. Be careful to pour it off gently as a great deal of sediment settles at the bottom of the vessel in which it is dissolved* Carbonate of ammonia is much nicer than salse* ratus ; it is prepared'in the same manner; be care- ful to keep the bottle corked, and keep it in a cool place. It may be used in all the receipts where salsera- tus is directed ; but only half the quantity is neces- saryâ€”thus: if one table spoonful of the salseratus is required, half a table spoonful of ammonia will be sufficient.

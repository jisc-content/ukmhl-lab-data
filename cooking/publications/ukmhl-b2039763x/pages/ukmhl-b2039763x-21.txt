THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. SOUPS. All soups are better to be made with fresh un- cooked meat, as that which has been cooked once has lost much of its flavor and nearly all its juices. It is therefore better economy to hash or spice your cold meatj and buy fresh for soup. Soup should not boil very hard, as that has a tendency to toughen the meat. Fat meat is not so proper nor healthy for soup as the leaner parts of the finest meat. The fat does not impart much flavor, and is not palatable. Soup may be kept till the next day; before it is heated over again, skim ofl* the cake of fat which congeals on the top. It is often preferred one day old to the day it is cooked. BEEP SOUP. 1.

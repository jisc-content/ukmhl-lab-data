70 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. Wash the livers, first cut out the gall; with a sharp knife open the gizzards by cutting an in- cision round them, but not so deep as to cut the inner skin ; then with your fingers tear them open. Pour boiling water on the feet and skin them ; cut off the toes, and crack the leg in half, wash all these- and stew them in very little water, w^ith pepper and salt. When the ducks are done, add the liquor the giblets were boiled in to the gravy, which has dropped from them, and thicken it with a little butter rolled in flour. Serve the liver on the dish with the ducks. HOABT DUCK, No. 2. 118. Prepare the ducks as directed above, and for the filling, mince two onions finely, add some pepper, salt, and a table spoonful of powdered sage, with an ounce of butter and some beaten egg. Rub the inside of the ducks with pepper and salt, put in the dressing, truss them, and put them on the spit. For the gravy, proceed as directed above. ROAST GOOSE. 119.

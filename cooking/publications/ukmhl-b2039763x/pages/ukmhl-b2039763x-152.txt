THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. H6 pudding will be lighter without. Rinse your pud- ding bag, flour it on the inside, pour in the batter, tie it very closely, leaving room for it to swell. Boil it two hours. BOILED PUDDING, Ko. 2, 291. Eight eggs, One quart of milk, One pint of flour, Salt just to taste. Beat the eggs very light, the yelks and whites separate—the yelks should be as thick as batter— add to them the flour and milk alternately, and very gradually, beating it hard all the time ; then stir in the w^hites, but do not beat it after they are in. The whites should be very dry. Wet your pudding bag, wring it dry, flour the inside, and pour in the pudding. It requires one hour to boil, and is very delicate, being very little thicker than a custard. Serve it with any kind of sweet sauce. This makes a light wholesome pudding. INDIAN BOILED PUDDING. 292.

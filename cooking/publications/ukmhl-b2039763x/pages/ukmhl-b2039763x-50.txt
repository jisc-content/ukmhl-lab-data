THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 44 pot with a tea spoonful of salt to every quart of water, and let it boil till the top of each piece be- gins to look clear—it requires a great deal of boil- ing and must be exceedingly soft. When, cold cut it in pieces, season and fry it in egg and bread crumbs like oysters. Or, it may be fried without the egg and crumbs, and the gravy thickened with a little flour, and flavored with catsup or vinegar. Serve it hot. ROAST VEAL, 61. Season a breast of veal with pepper and salt; skewer the sweet-bread firmly in its place, flour the meat and roast it slowly before a moderate fire for about four hours—it should be of a fine brown but not dry ; baste it with butter. When done put the gravy in a stew-pan, add a piece of butter rolled in browned flour, and if there should not be quite enough gravy add a little more water, with pepper and salt to the taste. The gravy should be brown. PLAII^ VEAL PIE. 62. Take the best end of a neck of veal, cut it in pieces, season it with pepper and salt, and stew it in just enough w^ater to cover it. When it is nearly done make a rich gravy with some butter rolled in flour, added to the water it was stew^ed in.

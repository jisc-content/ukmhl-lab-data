When the yelks are thick stir in a pint of milk, and as much flour as wuU make a batter, but not a thick one. Then stir in the whites which must be whisked very dry ; do not beat the batter after the white is in ; lastly stir in a tea spoonful of dissolved carbonate of ammo- nia. Take out the meat, skim all the fat off the gravy, pour in the batter and replace the meat; put all into the oven again, and cook it till the pudding is done. You should make batter enough to cover your dripping pan about half an inch deep. When the meat is dished, cut the pudding in squares, and place it round the dish, the brown side up.

Put the meat in a stew-pan and season it w^ell with pepper and salt, then add your tomatoes and an ounce of butter rolled in flour. Cover it closely, and let it simmer till the beef is tender. It does not require any water as the tomatoes are suf- ficiently juicy. If the gravy should not be thick enough, add a little flour mixed with cold water.

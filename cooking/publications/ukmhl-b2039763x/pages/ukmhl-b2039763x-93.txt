Take up a por- tion of the egg-plant about the size of an oyster, with a spoon, dip it into the egg, then into the crumbs, and fry them in hot lard of a light brown on both sides. EGG-PLANT, No. 5. {French mode.) 156. Cut an egg-plant in half, but do not cut off the rind. Then with a sharp knife score it very deeply, both lengthwise and crosswise, but be care- ful not to break the skin in so doing. Place each half in a pan with the scored side up, season it with pepper and salt, and over this pour som.e sweet oil or melted butter, if preferred. Set it in an oven and cook it slowly till the plant is perfect- ly soft. The top should be brown.

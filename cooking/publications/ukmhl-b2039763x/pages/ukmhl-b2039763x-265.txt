If you wish to keep your minced meat for several weeks, chop the meat and add the currants, raisins, sugar and spice, but leave out the apples, lemon, wine and cider; mix the other ingredients and merely moisten it with brandy ; pack the mix- ture tightly in a stone jar and cover it close. When you wish to make it into pies, take out some of the meat, chop your apples, and mix with it in the proportions given above. Moisten with cider, and add wine and brandy to your taste. SANDWICHES. 516. These are generally made of cold boiled ham or tongue. Slice your ham or tongue as thin as possible. Then butter your bread on the loaf, and with a very sharp knife cut it in very thin slices. Roll in each slice of bread a slice of the ham or tongue. A cold fried oyster is very nice in each sandwich. WINE SANGAREE. 517. Mix equal portions of wine and water, sweeten it to your taste, and grate nutmeg over the top. Ale or porter sangaree is made in the same manner.

THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 167 One egg, Milk enough to make a dotigh. Rub the butter through the flour, beat the egg and stir in, then add the yeast, milk, and a little salt. Knead the dough, when it is light mould it out into large biscuits, and bake them on tins. PARSlSriP CAKE, 333. Boil your parsnips till perfectly soft; pass them through a colander. To one tea cupful of mashed parsnip add one quart of warm milk, with a quarter of a pound of butter dissolved in it, a lit- tle salt, and one gill of yeast, with flour enough to make a thick batter. Set it away to rise, which will require several hours. When light stir in as much flour as will make a dough, knead it well and let it rise again. Make it out in cakes about a quarter or half an inch thick, butter your tins or pans, put them on and set them to rise. As soon as they are light bake them in a very hot oven. When done wash over the tops with a little water^ and send them to the table hot. These biscuits do not taste of the parsnips. MARYLAND BISCUITS, 334. One pound of flour. One ounce of butter.

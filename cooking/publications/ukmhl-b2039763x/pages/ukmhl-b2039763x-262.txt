256 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. BLACKBERRY- CORDIAL. 50S. Gather the ripest fruit, mash it in a pan with a large wooden spoon, strain out all the juice, and allow a quarter of a pound of sugar to a pint of the juice. Mix the juice and sugar together, and boil and skim it; then strain it again, and when cool to each pint of juice add a tea cupful of brandy. Bottle it and it will be fit for use. This is highly esteemed by some in cases of dysentery. RASPBERRY BRANDY. 509. Pick the fruit when dry, put it into a glass jar, and place the jar in a kettle of cold w^ater.

When cold mix with it an equal quantity of brandy. Bottle it tightly. CURRANT SHRUB. 510. Mix a pound of sugar w^ith every pint of currant-juice. When the sugar is dissolved boil it a few minutes and skim it. When almost cold add a gill of brandy to every quart of syrup. Bottle it, cork it well, and keep it in a cool place.

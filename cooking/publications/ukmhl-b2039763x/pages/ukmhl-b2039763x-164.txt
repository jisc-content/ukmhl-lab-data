158 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK* slice of the apple, which must be cut very thin—* fry them in hot lard of a light brown on both sides. ORANGE FRITTERS. 312. These are made as the above, only a slice of orange is to be substituted for the apple. GERMAN PUFFS. 313. One pint of milk. Three eggs. One pound of flour. One dessert spoonful of dissolved salaeratuSj A tea spoonful of butter. A salt spoon of salt. Beat the yelks and whites of the eggs separately. The yelks must be as thick as batter, and the whites perfectly dry. Add to the yelks half the milk and half the flour, stir it well until the batter is smooth, then add the remainder of the flour and milk. Warm the butter and stir in and beat the batter thus made till it is light and full of bubbles. Stir in the salaeratus, and lastly the whites—but do not beat it after the whites have been added, as that will make it tough. Butter tea cups, or an earthen mould, pour in the batter, and bake it in a moderate oven.

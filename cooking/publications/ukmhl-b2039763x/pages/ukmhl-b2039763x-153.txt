THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 147 Salt just to taste, Indian meal sufficient to form a batter. Stand the batter near the fire where it will dis- solve without getting hot. Stir as much Indian meal in the milk as will form a thick batter, then add the salt and melted butter. Separate the yelks and whites of the eggs; beat the yelks very thick and light, and add to the batter; whisk the whites till they are very dry, stir them gently into the mixture. Have your currants washed, picked and dried, flour them and stir in at the last. Dip your pudding bag in water, wring it out, turn it wrong side out, flour it well, turn it again, pour in the mixture and tie it closely with a strong string, taking care to leave room at the top of the bag for the pudding to swell. Have ready a pot of boiling water, put the pud- ding in, and have a kettle of boiling water to fill it up as it boils away. Keep the pudding boiling all the time, as it would be heavy if it should cease. Let it boil three hours. When done im- merse the bag for an instant into a pan of cold wa- ter, untie the string, turn back the bag and place your pudding on a dish. Serve it immediately. To be eaten with any kind of sweet sauce. INDIAN BAKED PUDDING. 293. One pint of Indian meal,

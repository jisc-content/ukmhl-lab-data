105 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. TOMATO MUSTARD. 207. Cut a peck of tomatoes in small pieces, boil them till tender. Rub them through a sieve to extract the pulp, which put on and boil until nearly dry. Then add one table spoonful of cayenne pepper, one table spoonful of black pepper, one tea spoonful of cloves, two table spoonsful of mus- tard seed, and two table spoonsful of salt. Boil the whole a few moments, and when cold bottle it and cork it tightly. If this should not be quite salt enough, a little more may be added before it is boiled the last time. Put a table spoonful of sweet oil on the top of each bottle before it is corked, to exclude the air. EGG SAUCE. 208. Boil half a pint of milk, and stir into it as much flour mixed with cold water as will thicken it. Then take it off the fire, and beat in gradually three ounces of butter; add a little salt.

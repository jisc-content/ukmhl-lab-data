Cut off the head, open and wash it clean, and fill it with a dressing made of bread crumbs, some onions finely chopped, pepper, salt, a little powdered mace, and as much butter as will cause the crumbs to adhere together ; sew the rabbit up after the dressing is in, put It on a spit before the fire, and baste it with butter, whilst it is roasting. Or it may be put in a pan with a little water, and baked. Make a gravy of a gill of water, an ounce of butter, an onion finely chopped, pepper, salt and mace to the taste. Wine may be added, if preferred. BAKED RABBIT PIE, 101. Cut a rabbit in pieces, wash it, and season it with salt and pepper. Nearly cover it with cold water, and stew it till it is tender, then add three ounces of butter rolled in flour. If it should not be seasoned sufiTiciently, add more pepper, as rab- bits require more seasoning than many other kinds of meat. 6

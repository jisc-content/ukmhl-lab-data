THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 77 One tea spoonful of salt. Six large heads of celery. Boil the fowls in water which has been salted, and stand them aw^ay to cool. Take off the skin, cut the meat in small pieces about a quarter of an inch square, then cut the white part of the celery in very small pieces, put it in a colander, place the colander in a pan of cold w^ater in order to keep the celery crisp. Boil the eggs till the yelks are hard, which will take tw^enty minutes; mash the yelks with the oil until they are smooth, then add the vinegar, mus- tard, pepper and salt. About fifteen minutes before the chicken salad is to be sent to the table, drain the celery, mix it thoroughly with the chicken, and then pour the dressing over it. Stir it well. Cold veal or turkey is very good dressed in t his way. This receipt may be relied on as being particu- larly nice. No, 2 is not quite so rich. CHICKEH SALAD, No. 2. 131.

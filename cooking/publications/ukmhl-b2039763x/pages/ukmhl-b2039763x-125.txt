119 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. MUSHROOM CATSUP. 235. Procure fresh mushrooms, pick them care- fully, wipe them clean, and put a layer in the bot- tom of a pan, sprinkle over some salt, then another layer of mushrooms and more salt until all are in; cover the pan and let them stand two days, mash them well and strain them through a hair sieve. To each quart of the pulp add one ounce and a half of whole black pepper, half an ounce of whole allspice, and a few blades of mace. Boil it till re- duced to two-thirds the original quantity. When done pour it in a pan and stand it away till the next day, then pass it through a hair sieve and bot- tle it for use. Put it in small bottles, on the top of each pour a table spoonful of sweet oil to exclude the air. Cork them closely and rosin the corks. WALNUT CATSUP. 236. When your pickled walnuts are soft, mash them through the vinegar which covers them, strain it and boil it to a proper thickness. Bottle it, put a table spoonful of sweet oil on the top of each bot- tle, and cork them tightly; seal the corks and it will keep for several years. This catsup is excellent. PICKLED NASTURTIUMS. 237.

72 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK* ROAST CHICKENS. 121. Clean your chickens, wash them and wipe them dry ; season them inside with pepper and salt, make a dressing of bread crumbs, some minced onion, pepper, salt, and as much butter as will hold the crumbs together. Fill your chickens with this dressing, skewer them well and season them on the outside with salt and pepper; put them on the spit, dredge a little flour over, and baste them with but- ter w4iilst they are roasting. Boil the gizzards and livers in very little water, take out the liver, chop it up fine, and add it to the water it was boiled in, with a little salt; stir into this all the gravy which dripped from the chickens, and thicken it with some butter rolled in flour. Partridges are roasted in the same way. CHICKEN PIE. 122. Cut your chickens in pieces, wash them, and put them in a stew-pan with salt and pepper, and water enough to nearly cover them. To each one, rub one ounce of butter in flour, and add it to the gravy when the chickens are done; let it boil a few minutes. Make a rich paste, line the sides of your pie dish, put in the chickens and half the gravy, cover the pie with the paste ; leave an open- ing in the centre, and ornament the top with paste cut in flowers, or bars twisted and laid across the centre. When the crust is done take out the pie.

THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 118 Half a pint of salt, One ounce of cloves. Two ounces of whole allspice, Two ounces of ground cayenne pepper, A dessert spoonful of ground black pepper. Two heads of garlic skinned and separated. Mix the whole together and boil three hours; bottle without straining it. On the top of each bottle pour a table spoonful of sweet oil, cork them closely and seal them. The sweet oil by excluding the air tends to preserve the catsup. TOMATO CATSUP, No. 2. 234. Slice the tomatoes, put a layer in a deep vessel, and sprinkle over some salt; then another layer of tomatoes and salt till all are in. Stand them in the sun for two or three days, w^hen they are soft pass them through a sieve, and put the pulp, thus drained out, over the fire to boil. Add cayenne pepper, whole black pepper, mace, cloves, allspice, and a little race ginger if you like ; let it boil till it is thick, add a clove of garlic ; by tasting it you can judge if it is seasoned to your taste. When cold, bottle it off; put a table spoonful of sweet oil on the top of each bottle, and seal the corks.

192 THE NATIONAL COOK BOOI^* One wine-glass of rose-water. One ounce of bitter almonds. Beat the eggs, the yelks and whites separate^ when the yelks are very light add the sugar and the ahnonds, which must have been blanched and pounded with the rose-water. Beat the whole well. Whisk the whites to a dry froth, and stir in one-half the white with one-half the flour till it is thoroughly mixed, then add the other half of the white and flour. Do not beat it after the white is in, as that will make it tough and heavy. SPONGE CAKB, No. 1. 373. Three-quarters of a pound of flour, Twelve eggs. One pound of sugar, A table spoonful of rose-water* Beat the yelks and sugar together until they are very light. Whisk the whites till they are per- fectly dry, add the rose-water, then the whites and flour alternately, but do not beat it after the whites are in. Butter your pans, or if you wish to bake it in one large cake, grease a mould, pour in the mixture, and bake it. The small cakes should have sugar sifted over them before they are set in the oven, and the oven should be hot.

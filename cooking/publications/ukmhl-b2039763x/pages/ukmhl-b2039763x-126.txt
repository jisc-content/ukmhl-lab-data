Take one peck of ripe tomatoes, prick them with a large needle, and lay them in strong salt and water eight days. Then take them out of the brine and lay them in vinegar and water for twenty-four hours. Scald a dozen small onions in vinegar and stand the whole away to get cold. Drain the tomatoes and add them to the cold onions and vinegar, with two wine-glasses of mus- tard-seed and an ounce of cloves. PASTRY. The flour for pastry should be of the whitest and finest quality. It should be mixed with a broad knife, as the moisture and warmth of the hand makes it heavy. The butter should be of the best quality, as if it is a little rancid it will taste. To make puff paste it should have all the salt washed out of it. Iron, or block tin plates are the best for baking pastry. Always use cold water (in summer iced water) to mix pastry, and if it cannot be baked immediate- ly, set it away in a cool place.

Choose the white cling-stones, known by the name of the " Heath peach.Insert the knife at the stem and cut them longitudinally through to the stone. Wring out the stones by placing one hand on each half of the peach and suddenly giv(^ each a turn in opposite directions; the fruit w^ill break in half, leaving the stone attached to one side. With a pointed knife it may easily be ex- tracted. After the peaches have all been prepared in this m^anner pare and w^eigh them. Then weigh a pound of sugar for each pound of fruit. Put the sugar into a preserving kettle, and allow a gill of water to each pound of sugar. Let the sugar stand until it is perfectly dissolved before it is put on the fire; to ten pounds of sugar add the half of the white of an egg, w-ell beaten, or a piece of Russian isinglass, about an inch square, dissolved in two table spoonsful of w^ater. Set the kettle over the fire, and as soon as the syrup begins to boil skim it. When the scum has ceased to rise, take the syrup off the fire, pour it into a pan, and w^ash the kettle in order to prevent the scum which adheres to the sides from boiling into the fruit. Nov/ pour the syrup back into the kettle, add the fruit to it, and place it over a brisk fire, let the fruit boil fast 20

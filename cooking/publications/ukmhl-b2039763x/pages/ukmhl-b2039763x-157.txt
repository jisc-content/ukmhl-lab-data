THE NATIONAL COOK BOOK. 151 in a preserving pan, add to it one pound of pulve- rizer! white sugar, half an ounce of bitter almonds pounded in a mortar with a little rose-water; put the almonds in the mortar one at a time, so as to pound them very finely, they should be like cream when done; strain them and add them to the jelly w^ith a table spoonful of rose-water. Place the preserving pan in a vessel of boilifig w^ater, let it stand till it gets very hot, but do not let it boil. Strain it through the jelly bag several times, and w^hen perfectly clear pour it in moulds; w^et them inside first to prevent the jelly from adhering to them, and stand them in a cold place. When you strain the jelly do not squeeze the bag, as by that means you force the sediment through it; and by no means w^ash it, as it is impossible to wring it per- fectly dry, and consequently the jelly will be thin- ned ; scrape it on the inside as clean as you can each time.

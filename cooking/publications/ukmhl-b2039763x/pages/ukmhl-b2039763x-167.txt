Set it over the fire, and as it begins to simmer stir in very gradually two tea spoonsful of flour to a quart of fruit. It should be stirred all the time it is boiling. Serve it either warm or cold, with cream. Raspberries may be cooked in the same way. RICE DUMPLINGS. 320. Put your rice in a stew-pan, and pour on each cup of rice one gill of milk; stand it near the fire where it will keep hot but not boil. As soon as it has absorbed all the milk, pare your apples, take out the cores, and put the rice around them instead of paste. Boil them until the apple is soft. They should be tied in dumpling cloths. GLAZED CURRANTS. 321. Select large ripe bunches of currants, wash them by dipping them in a bowl of cold wa- ter, and drain them dry ; have ready the whites of two eggs, give them three or four beats, dip the bunches in the egg, place them on a sieve so as not to touch each other, sift powdered sugar over them and place them in a warm place to dry. The whites of the eggs should only be broken, but not beaten till dry, or they will not adhere to the fruit.

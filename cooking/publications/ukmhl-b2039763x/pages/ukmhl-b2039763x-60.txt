ROAST PIG. 86. Prepare the pig by cutting off the feet, scraping and cleansing the head and ears, cutting out the tongue and eyes, and cleaning the throat. Wash it perfectly clean and w^ipe it dry. Make a dressing of bread crumbs, some onions finely chop- ped, with salt, pepper, and sweet marjoram to the taste, also butter enough to make the crumbs ad- here together. Any spice may be added, and the grating of a lemon, but many prefer the dressing without spice. Rub the pig thoroughly inside with salt, cayenne pepper, and powdered sage, then fill it with the dressing and sew it up. Rub the outside with salt, cayenne pepper and sage, put it on the spit and place it before a clear, but not too hot a fire. Have a piece of clean sponge tied on a stick, dip it in melted butter, and as the skin dries moisten it. A common sized pig takes from three to four hours to roast. An excellent filling may be made of po- tatoes boiled and mashed instead of the bread. If potatoes are used the dressing will require more butter. Roast pig is always served with haslet sauce.

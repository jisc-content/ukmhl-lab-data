( 147 ) POTTING MEATS AND FISH. All meats may be potted in the same manner. Cook the meat until quite tender, and then scrape it finely and rub it through a wire sieve. Pound it in a inortar with about four ounces of clarified butter to every pound of meat, and season it well to taste. Put it into jars and pour clarified butter over. Keep it in a cool place. Some meats may be potted together, such as chicken and ham, chicken and tongue, veal and ham, &c. Any bones may be made into stock in the usual way. This stock should afterwards be reduced to a half glaze which may bo used in the place of butter. The quantity of butter and glaze must be determined according to the meat used. Dry potted meat is not agreeable, but on the other hand it must not be too moist. Sometimes a little spice is used, but it is safer to leave it out, as many people object to it. If not for immediate use, use butter only —no half glaze—or the fat of ham, if ham is being potted. Anchovies must be washed, filleted, and dried, well pounded in a mortar with a little claiified butter, and rubbed through a sieve. Season nicely with pepper, and pack closely in pots and cover with clarified butter. Bloaters, cooked dried haddocks, and any fish suitable for potting, are all prepared in the same manner.

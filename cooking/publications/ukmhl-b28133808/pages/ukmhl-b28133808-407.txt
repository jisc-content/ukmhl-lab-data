( 391 ) Â» r SOUFFLES, OMELETS, AND FRITTERS. The best cooks will sometimes fail in making souffles, as their manufacture requires the greatest care and * attention. It is also necessary to be able to judge to a nicety the time they will take to cook, because to be eaten in perfection, they should be served directly they are ready. In making a souffle, be very careful to take the exact measures of the different ingredients; a little too much flour, or rather too little milk, may make a great difference in the lightness of it. The flour should be the best Vienna. Another point to be attended to is to whip up the whites of the eggs as stiffly as possible, and to mix them with the other ingredients very lightly. Bear in mind that the object in beating the whites of eggs is to introduce air into the souffle; and it is the expan- sion of the air when the souffle is cooking which makes it light. If the whites are mixed heavily with the other ingredients, the air which has been whipped into them is beaten out again, and consequently they fail to make the souffle light. When the souffle is firm in the middle, it is sufficiently cooked and should be served with the greatest expedition, as it will begin to sink rapidly. An omelet souffle, left in the oven two or three minutes over time, will be quite spoilt, and become tough and leathery. To prepare a souffle, tin, well butter it. Fold a sheet of kitchen paper into three, and brush it well over with melted butter. Fasten it round the top of the tin, tying securely with string. When the souffle is steamed, place a piece of buttered paper over the top of it to prevent the condensed steam from falling into tho pudding and spoiling it. Neither souffle tins nor omelet pans should be allowed to get damp ; if so, they will stick. To prevent this, season 2 c 2

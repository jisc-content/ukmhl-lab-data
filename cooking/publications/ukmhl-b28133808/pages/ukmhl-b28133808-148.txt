Breast of mutton. Veal forcemeat. Ingredients. A beaten egg. Method.—Bone the mutton. Brush it with egg, and cover it with the forcemeat, and roll it up. Secure it firmly with broad tape. Cook it very gently in water or stock (the latter, if possible), until tender. Then press it until cold. Garnish with parsley. Cow-heel. Thoroughly wash the heel, and scald it with boiling water, scrape off all the hairs, and remove all the fat from between the claws. Put it into cold water, and bring it to the boil. Throw the water away and well wash the heel. Cut it into four pieces. Put them into a saucepan with an onion and a few sprigs of parsley, a little pepper and salt, and cover it with cold water. Simmer for four hours or more, until tender. Place it on a hot dish and serve with piquant, tomato, or parsley sauce. If the latter, use the liquor from the heel for making it. If no vegetables are used in cooking the heel, the stock may be clarified for a jelly. Sheep’s Head plainly Boiled. Ingredients. 1 sheep’s head. G sago leaves. 2 ozs. of butter or dripping.

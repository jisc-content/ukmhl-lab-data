182 A COMPLETE COOKEIiY GUIDE. FISH. How to Choose Fish. FiiESH fish may bo known by the brightness of the eyes and gills, and the firmness of the flesh; there should be little or no smell, and that not disagreeable. When the flesh is flabby and the odour offensive, tho fish is not fit for food. Tho best cod are round and plump, with firm white flesh. The sound and the glutinous parts about the head are much esteemed. Mackerel must be eaten perfectly fresh, as it spoils very rapidly. Eed mullets are ^better for being kept a short time. Choose them short, very red, and with firm flesh and bright eyes. The grey mullet should be cooked when quite fresh. When plaice is in good condition, the body is thick and firm, and the eyes bright. Salmon to be in perfection should be cooked as soon as possible after it is caught: when this is done, there is a white creamy substance between tho flakes which is highly esteemed; this molts when tho fish is kept longer. Skate is better if kept a day or two, and it must always be skinned before using. Crimping should be done directly the fish is dead; when crimped it does not keep well. Smelts should be quite fresh. They should be silvery in appearance, and smell like freshly cut cucumber. Soles are best fresh, but will keep a day or two in cold weather.

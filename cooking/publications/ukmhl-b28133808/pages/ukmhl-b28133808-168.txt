A COMPLETE COOKERY GUIDE. 148 Strain the stock and boil it rapidly to a glaze; put the veal on a hot dish and pour the glaze over. Serve with a puree of spinach, sorrel or endive.

Some sausage-meat. 2 veal kidneys. 6 truffles. Some strong second stock. Method.â€”Bone the veal, cut the kidneys and truffles into dice ; mix them with the sausage-meat. Lay the force- meat on the veal, fold the veal round it and secure it in shape with a broad tape. Itoll it in a napkin, again fastening it securely with tape, and boil gently in stock from three to four hours. Then remove it from the stewpan, take off the cloth and roll it in a clean one, fastening it in securely. Put a dish with a weight on it to press it. When cold remove the napkin, trim the meat neatly and glaze it. Garnish and decorate like galantine of fowl or turkey. Breast of Veal as a Galantine.

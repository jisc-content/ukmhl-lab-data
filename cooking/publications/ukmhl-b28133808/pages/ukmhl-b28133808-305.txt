289 BREAD AND CAKES. Where the Dough should be placed to Rise. This should be in a warm, not hot place. It may go in the front of the oven or boiler, but not directly in front of a hot fire.

Have the oven quite ready for the bread, so that there is no delay when the dough is in condition for baking. Time for Baking. From one to two hours, according to the size of the loaves.

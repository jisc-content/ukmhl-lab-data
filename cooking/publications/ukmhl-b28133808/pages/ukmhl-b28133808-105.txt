SOUPS. 85 five hours; then strain the broth through a napkin ; skim off all the fat, and thicken with a roux, to the con- sistence of thin Espagnole sauce; set the soup on the stove corner to clarify, and skim it till quite clear. Take about— 4 ozs. of green basil. 2 ozs. of marjoram. 2 ozs. of lemon thyme. Put these herbs in a stewpan, with 1 h pint of con- somme, and simmer for one hour; then press them through a tammy cloth and add the puree to the soup. The turtle meat being cold, cut it in pieces about l^incli square and put it in the soup to simmer for half an hour; taste for seasoning, and add some salt or pepper if necessary; skim the soup carefully, and put it in basins, in quantites sufficient for twelve persons. Blanch the green fat; drain, and divide it equally in each basin. When wanted warm up the soup; add some chicken quenelles, two glasses of Madeira, a little lemon juice, and cayenne pepper, according to taste. Observations.—It is seldom that the requirements of even a large household enable a cook to dress a whole turtle, unless on some very special occasions, therefore, in ordinary cases, some consomme should be prepared as directed above, and two or more quarts of turtle meat should be procured from a wholesale turtle dealer, where it can always be had in perfection ; thus avoiding un- necessary expense, and producing as satisfactory a result. Dressed turtle can only be kept a limited time. Purees of Game. See Purees.—When used for soup they should bo sufficiently diluted with stock made from Game. 1 handful of parsley. 1 small sprig of thyme. 0

BREAD AND CAKES. 291 Steamed Bread. Bread can be steamed successfully according to direc- tions given for steaming puddings; that is, water should be only half-way up the tin. For this purpose the water must boil. Tl c tins in this case must bo greased instead of floured to prevent tho dough sticking. A firm crust is formed all over the loaf, and, if preferred brown, it can be put into a sharp oven for a few minutes when cooked. Steamed bread is lighter than baked bread. Note.—For all bread it is essential that the yeast be good; otherwise the bread will not be light. Brewer’s yeast is not so close as German yeast. As a general rule two tablespoon fills of fresh yeast are equal to one ounce of German, but no hard and fast rule can Le laid down. Vienna Bread.

195 fish. Garnish with fried parsley. Any suitable sauce may be handed with them, oyster, lobster, shrimp, Hollandaise, maitre-dâ€™hotel, &c. If preferred, tho whiting may be dipped in beaten egg, and then in flour instead of crumbs, before frying. Whitings with Genoese Sauce. Skin some small whitings, and fasten the tails in the jaws with small wooden skewers. Lay them on a buttered saute-pan or baking-tin, and cover with buttered paper. Cook in a moderately heated oven for twenty minutes, or longer; then dish them up. Pour a little Genoese sauce over, and serve tho re- mainder in a tureen. Sturgeon. This is a fish rarely in the market. It may be dressed and served in every way suitable for salmon. Before cooking, the skin must be removed, as tho oil in it is apt to give an unpleasant flavour to the fish. Boiled Skate. Remove any skin, and boil or steam the skate according to the Directions for Boiling and Steaming Fish. Serve with anchovy, shrimp, piquant, browned butter, or any suitable sauce. Crimping Skate. Skin tho skate, and cut the fish in strips about an inch wide and the length of tho fish; roll them up and tie them with thread. Tho crimping should be done as soon as possible after the fish is dead. The practice of crimping the living skate is barbarous. Crimped skate may be boiled, steamed, baked, or fried, and served with any sauce suitable for fish. Fried Smelts. Smelts are generally fried. Wash well and dry them.

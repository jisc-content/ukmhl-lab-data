IV PREFACE. are affected by heat, so as to promote digestibility and nourishment. The skilful cook has to guard against producing tough- ness of one kind of food by excess of heat, or by not applying heat in the proper way, and', on the other hand, she has to secure tenderness and digestibility of some foods (without loss of flavour) by sufficient heat. Speaking generally, all foods containing starch, that is, all farinaceous foods, and nearly all vegetables, must be brought to the boiling point. On the other hand, lean flesh meat containing albumen—that is, the same constituent as white of egg—becomes tough at the boil- ing point if that heat is prolonged more than a few minutes. The intense heat to which fat can be raised—more than double that of boiling water—has also to be understood in order to prevent the injudicious use of the frying- pan, and, I may add, to ensure the proper use of the frying basket. It needs intelligence in comprehending these principles, and practice in applying them, to cook a steak, or an omelet, or a pudding, or to make soup of the simplest kind. But on all these points Miss Harrison’s book is a safe guide, and I heartily wish her success, both in the useful- ness of tho book, and in her important duties in connection with general education.

A COMPLETE COOKERY GUIDE. X culture which is more and more needed to make them, in the highest sense of the word, the companions of their husbands and brothers. But I maintain there is room for both. The lives of really distinguished women, with but few exceptions, testify to the fact that true culture and a due regard for domestic duties invariably go hand in hand. In all educational matters the German women are still, I think, in advance of the English; and yet every German woman, of whatever class, is thoroughly instructed in all branches of household management. If it is not possible to do this at home, she goes to a training college, such as I have mentioned, for quite a year. The late Canon Kingsley, in his “ Lectures on Health and Education ”—lectures which every woman would do well to read and act on—says that “ in Germany you may see young ladies living in what we British would con- sider something like poverty ; cooking, waiting at table, and performing many a household office which here would be considered menial, and yet finding time for the cultivation of the intellect in a way which is unfortunately rare in Great Britain.” But may it not be, as already suggested, that, the so- wonsidered menial duties, so far from being a hindrance to intellectual culture, play au important part in the development of the intellect; and is it not against the spirit of Christianity to call any honest labour menial in the sense of its being mean and servile? St. Paul considered it a matter for honest pride that he had worked with his hands and not been chargeable to any one. “ The honest, earnest man must stand and work ; The woman also—otherwise she drops At once below the dignity of man, Accepting serfdom. Free men freely work— Whoever fears God, fears to sit at ease.”

8 A COMPLETE COOKLUY GUILE. THE DRAWING UP OF A MENU, AND THE ORDER OF A DINNER. Ix drawing up a menu it is necessary to give careful attention to one or two points. The dishes chosen should he in season and contrast pleasantly; there should be an agreeable variety of meats, vegetables, Ac., and the methods of cooking them should differ as much as possible to heighten the contrasts.

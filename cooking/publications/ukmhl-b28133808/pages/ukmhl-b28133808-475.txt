In preserving fruit in this manner, judicious selection of the fruit, well cooking, and well corking, are tho three points to be carefully attended to. Fruit corks are cut the reverse way of the grain and are sold at 4s. Gel. to 6s. Gd. a gross. They should be made pliable by squeezing before they are u-ed. Cork squeezers can bo got at Farrow and Jackson’s, Great Tower Street. The corks must fit very tight. If the bottoms of the-corks aro rubbed with salad oil they will drive in much easier. If a corking-machine is not available, and it scarcely will be in a private house, it is well to resin the coiks round before putting tho bottles away. Resin is little or no protection against leakage if the cork is faulty. It is possible now to get fruits preserved in such perfection, that it is far better for those who live in towns to buy tho fruit already preserved than to buy it for preserving. Notes.—For small quantities of fruit a deep meat-kettle may bo used instead of a copper. I fit is not possible to carry out these directions with regard to tho threo hours’ slow heating, bring the water to the boil very gradually and then gently simmer for about ten minutes. Black currants and plums will require fifteen minutes. Apricots and pi aches twenty minutes. These rules cannot always be strictly followed, as the length of time will, to somo extent, depend on the ripe- ness of tho fruit.

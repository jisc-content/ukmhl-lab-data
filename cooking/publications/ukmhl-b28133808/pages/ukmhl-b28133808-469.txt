Put the fruit in a preserving-pan on the hot-plate, not directly over the fire; sprinkle a little sugar over it. As the fruit juices, keep adding the sugar. When it is all dissolved, put the pan over the fire and bring to the boil. Let it boil for about twenty minutes, keeping it stirred and skimmed. Try a little and sec if it will set; if not, continue the boiling. Stir strawberries carefully. Baspberries mash down. Pour the jam when cool enough into jars, and fasten it down at once.

( 351 ) JELLIES. To Clear Jellies. Take a large saucepan, and see that it is perfectly clean. Put into it all the ingredients for the jelly, and the whites and shells of the eggs. The use of the whites of the eggs is to clear the jelly; the shells form a filter through which to strain it. Whisk all together over a quick fire until the jelly begins to simmer; then immediately leave off stirring and let it well boil up. Tlio heat of the boiling jelly hardens the egg, which rises to the surface in the form of a thick scum, bringing all impurities with it. If the stirring were continued during the boiling it would prevent the scum rising properly, and the jelly would not clear. When the jelly has well boiled up, remove it from the firo and let it stand for a few minutes till a crust is formed. A jelly bag may be used, or a chair turned upside down with a cloth tied firmly to its four legs. Any cloth, which is clean and not too closely woven, will answer the purpose. Put a basin under the cloth, and pour somo boiling water through it. This is to make it hot. Change the basin for a clean dry one, and pour the whole contents of the saucepan on to the cloth. The first runnings of the jelly will be cloudy, because the filter which the eggs make will not have settled in the cloth. As soon as the jelly runs slowly, and looks clear, put a clean basin under the cloth and put the first runnings through it again, very gently, that they may not disturb the filter of egg and crushed shells. Strain the jelly in a warm place, out of any draught. Two eggs are usually sufficient to clarify a quart of jelly, but if the eggs are small it is wise to take a third. When the weather is so hot that it is necessary to use moro gelatino, more eggs will be required, for if there is not sufficient white of egg the jelly will not clear. The jelly should bo allowed to get nearly cold before it is put into the moulds.

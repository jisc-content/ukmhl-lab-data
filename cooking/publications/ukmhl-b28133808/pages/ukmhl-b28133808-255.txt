PUDDINGS. 230 To Steam a Pudding. When a pudding is steamed it must bo placed in a well- greased mould or basin, and covered with buttered paper. If a steamer is not available for the purpose, put the pudding into a stewpan with just sufficient water to come half-way up tho mould, and keep the water at simmering point until the pudding is cooked. A custard pudding, or any pudding containing custard, must be very carefully steamed, as extreme heat would curdle the eggs and make the custard watery. To Bake a Pudding. Milk puddings require a moderate oven, otherwise both the eggs and milk in them will curdle, the milk also will scorch. Any pudding of the nature of a Souffle will require a quick heat to throw it up. A batter pudding must also be baked in a hot oven, or it will not be light. Custard puddings and all those containing custard must be very slowly cooked. The best way of cooking either large or small custards is to put them in a Yorkshire pudding tin which contains sufficient hot water to come half-way up the dish or moulds. If they are placed thus in a slow oven, they will cook without curdling. The Preparation of the Ingredients for Puddings. Suet should be chopped finely, raisins stoned and cut in halves. Currants should be washed in lukewarm water, and then rubbed thoroughly in a cloth to dry them and rub off the stalks. Drop a few at a time on a plate to discover by the sound if there are any stones amongst them. Sultanas should be rubbed in flour and the stalks picked off. Candied peel should be cut in thin slices, Moist sugar is best for sweetening purposes, as less is required; but castor should be used for all light puddings.

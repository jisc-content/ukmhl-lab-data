SAVOURY MEAT DISHES SUITABLE FOR REMOVES. 147 Put them, with tho ear (using another if possible) and the tongue, into the stock, with the suet, celery, lemon juice, herbs, shalots, and a little pepper and salt, and cook gently until tender; this will probably take two and a half hours or longer. Keep the pot well skimmed. Meantime, prepare the sauce. Cleanse the brains and remove the skin, tie them in muslin and cook them for about ten minutes. Drain the cooked head and put it into a stewpan with the sauce, the olives turned and the mushrooms, which should be cooked. Remove the skin from the tongue and cut it into scallops, then add these to the sauce. Place a fried-broad croustard on a dish, and placo the pieces of head closely round it, then pour over tho sauce, etc. ; put the brains in the centre, and the ears, fringed, at each end. Put the cray-fish, cockscombs, and some truffles on three silver skewers and stick them in the croustard. Garnish round the dish prettily with the braised sweet- bread cut in slices, the yolks of eggs and the gherkins cut into balls, and the truffles. For directions for preparing the truffles, cockscombs, olives, &c., see Garnishes. Fricandeau of Veal. Ingredients. 3 lbs. of the fleshy end of the fillet of veal.

A COMPLETE COOKERY GUIDE. 000, Rook Pie. 8 young roots. 1 lb. beaf steak. Some stock or water. Ingredients. A little butter. Flaky or other crust. Pepper and salt. Method.—Skin the rooks without plucking thorn. Cut away tlio spine and tho flesh on either side of it, as this would give a bitter taste to the pie. It is best to use the breasts only. Cut the steak into neat pieces and season them and the rooks with pepper and salt. Edge a pie-dish with pastry, and lay the steak and breasts of the birds in it. Put little pieces of butter about the meat, and pour in about half a pint of stock or water. Cover with pastry, decorate with paste leaves, and make a hole for the gases to escape. This pie will take about two hours and a half to cook. It is really better to stew the rooks before putting them in the pie. Glaze when nearly ready by brushing over with beaten egg- Pigeon Pie. Ingredients. 4 pigeons. 1 lb. of rump steak. Yolks of 6 hard-boiled eggs. Pepper and salt. Some puff or other paste. Some good stock. Method.—Prepare the pie-dish, and roll out the paste as for beef-steak pie. Draw the pigeons and cut them in halves. Cut the steak into thin strips the way of the grain. Season the steak and pigeon nicely, and put them into tho pie-dish with tho hard-boiled yolks. Pour in tho stock. Cover with tho paste, and finish like a beef-steak pie. Wash and clean the legs of two pigeons and stick them in the hole in the top of the pie. Bake for about an hour and half.

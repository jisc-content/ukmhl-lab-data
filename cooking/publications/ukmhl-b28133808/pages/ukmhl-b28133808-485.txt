469 MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS. How to Render down Fat. Cut the fat into small dice. Put it into a large iron saucepan and cover with water. Boil for one hour with the lid on the saucepan, that the steam may whiten the fat. Then remove the lid and boil steadily until all the water has evaporated. Stir the fat every now and again to prevent it sticking to the bottom of the saucepan and burning. Great care must be taken not to get the fat over-heated during the rendering down. When it is ready it will look clear. Let it cool and then strain, pressing the pieces of fat well to squeeze out the liquid fat. Any fat, cooked or uncooked, may be rendered down. This fat may be used for plain cakes and pastry as well as for French Frying. Boiled Flour. Put the flour in a cloth and tie it up like a pudding, and boil for five hours. Then grate it down and use one ounce to one pint of milk. Baked Flour. Sprinkle flour over a baking-tin, and bake it until it is a light brown colour, taking care it does not burn. Use it like boiled flour. To Clarify Dripping. Melt the dripping and pour it into cold water. When cold, scrape off the sediment which will be found at the bottom. Or the dripping may be boiled with the water and poured into a basin. A Bouquet Garni. This consists of a sprig of parsley, thyme, marjoram, and a bay leaf tied together with string. 2 H

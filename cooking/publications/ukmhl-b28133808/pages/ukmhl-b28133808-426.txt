A COMPLETE COOKERY GUIDE. 410 ICES. GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING ICES. The making of ices has of late years become a com- paratively easy operation, as there are a number of improved machines in which they can he prepared in a very short time, and many of these can be purchased at a very low price. With somo of them a freezing mixture is used, with others ice and salt. Ice cannot, alone, produce a sufficient degree of cold for the purpose, but must have half its weight of rough salt mixed with it. If too much sugar is used in making the ices, they will not freeze to the right consistency; too little, on the other hand, will make them hard and rough, like snow. Sorbets are half-frozen water ices, generally lemon water flavoured with rum or spirit. These are served before the roasts. When ices are moulded as puddings, they should he only half frozen when they are put into their moulds: if frozen too dry, they will not take the shape. After putting them in moulds, well butter the joints (unless a cave is used), and pack in ice and salt until required. Any nice cream ices may be made into puddings. A mixture of fresh or preserved fruits may, if liked, be added to them before they are moulded. The moulds may bo decorated with fruits, and the pudding prettily coloured. Water ices set in fancy shapes and placed round the jmdding mako a pretty finish. Turn the ice pudding out liko a jelly or cream, the only difference being that it is dipped into cold, not hot, water. Place it on a silver or fancy dish with a pretty dessert paper under it.

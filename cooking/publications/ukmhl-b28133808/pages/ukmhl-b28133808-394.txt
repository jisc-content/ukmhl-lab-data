A COMPLETE COOKERY GUIDE. 378 RECHAUFFES OF COOKED MEAT. In re-cooking cold meat care should be taken that it is only allowed to simmer, and not boil. Boiling hardens the albumen and fibrine, and conse juently toughens the pieces of meat. The bones from cooked meat can be put into the stock- pot, or be used to make gravy, according to the directions given in the recipe for hashed meat. Scraps of meat too small for hashes and curries, and the scrapings of the bones may be used for minces and rissoles. Care should be taken that tho stock or gravy used in made dishes should be savoury, well-seasoned and nicely thickened, but not too thick. Hash. Ingredients. Slices of cold meat. Nice stock or gravy. Flour, in the proportion of ^ oz. of flour to every ^ pint of stock. Pepper and salt to taste. 1 teaspoonful of mushroom cat- sup, or Harvey’s, or tomato sauce to every i pint of stuck. Some sippets of fried or toasted bread. Method.—Put the stock on to boil. When nearly boiling thicken it with the flour, cooking that thoroughly. Add tho sauce, and season nicely. Lay in the pieces of meat and simmer for half an hour. The gravy must not boil when tho meat is in. llalf-an- hour’s simmering, when possible, greatly improves tho flavour of the meat.

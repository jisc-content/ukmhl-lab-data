A COMPLETE COOKERY GUIDE. .'MG for boning fowls; mince the veal and pork ; season with pepper and salt. Fill the fowl with the stuffing, placing in the yolks and truffles. Shape the fowl nicely and fasten it securely in a cloth. Boil it according to directions given for boiling meat. When cooked, remove the cloth and fasten it in a clean one. Put it under pressure (not too much) until cold. Bemove the oloth; glaze it (see Glaze), and garnish with aspic jelly. If there is no aspic for the purpose, garnish it tastefully with salad plants. Prepare like galantine of fowl. It will require three times as much veal and pork for filling it. A tongue is often placed in the centre. A large turkey is difficult to bone like a fowl. It is easier to cut the turkey down the back and remove the ilesh sideways from the bones. Method.â€”Bemove the flesh from the body and claws of the lobster, and cut it in pieces.

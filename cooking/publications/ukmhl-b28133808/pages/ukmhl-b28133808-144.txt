124 A COMPLETE COOKERY GUIDE. SAVOURY AND ECONOMICAL DISHES OF MEAT. Beef Steak Broiled. The steak should be cut from well-hung beef. ltump is the best part for the purpose. It should not be less than three quarters of an inch in thickness. Broil it according to the directions given for broiling meat. It will probably take about ten minutes to cook. Serve at once, very hot, with, if liked, maitre-dâ€™hotel butter, or mushroom, piquant, oyster or horse-radish sauce. Beef Steak Fried. Put a very little butter or dripping or some of the fat skimmings of the stock-pot into a frying-pan, and make it quite hot, put in the steak and fry it for one minute on either side. Then moderate the heat, either by lowering the gas if a gas-stove be used, or removing the pan further from the lire. Cook it gently, turning occasionally for about fifteen minutes. The flavour of fried steak is not so fine as that of broiled. It may be served with any of the sauces recommended for broiled sleak. Fried or sauteed potatoes are an excellent accompani- ment to broiled or fried steaks, so are also tomatoes cut in slices, and cooked in the oven. A steak which is to be broiled or fried, must be tender to be satisfactory. On this poiut'it is wise to take the advice of a reliable butcher.

Then turn its edges towards you and roll it out again; fold evenly in three, and roll and fold again in the same manner} each roll and fold is called a turn. Cool the paste for another quarter of an hoxir. Then give it two more turns. Let it cool again ; and at the seventh roll it will probably be ready for use. It is, however, wise to bake a small piece of the paste beforo using the whole quantity. If the maker has a very light hand, it sometimes happens that eight or even nine turns may be necessary to roll the butter sufficiently in the flour. Patty-Cases. Roll the puff paste, when ready, to rather more than a quarter of an inch in thickness. Take a fluted cutter about the size of the top of a tumbler, and cut the paste into rounds with it. Mark the middle of these rounds with a cutter about three sizes smaller. Roll out the remainder of the paste to half the thickness of the cases. Stamp out some rounds for covers with a fluted cutter two sizes smaller than that used for the cases. Put the cases and covers on a baking-tin, and bake in a quick oven for ten or fifteen minutes. When cooked, lift the lid and scrape out the soft inside carefully. VoI-au-Vent. Follow the directions given for cutting patty-cases, using vol-au-vent cutters.

After cutting the case mark the oentro with a small cutter that will come within three quarters of an inch of the edge of the paste all the way round and, press this half through The case will take about half an hour to bake, and must not be removed from the oven until the sidos are quite set, or it will fall and lose its lightness. r 2

A COMPLETE COOKERY GUIDE. 292 Method.â€”Put the flour in a pan. Add the baking- powder and mix with the water. Make it into small loaves quickly, and bake in a quick oven for about half an hour. This bread must be kneaded as little as possible. The Preparation of Materials for Cakes. The flour for cakes should be dried and sifted. The currants must bo washed and dried before they are used, and dropped a lew at a time on a plate, to discover if tbe:e are any stones amongst them. Sultanas should be rubbed in flour and the stalks picked off. Candied peel should be shredded. When the whites of eggs are beaten separately from the jolks, remove the germ and beat them to the strongest possible froth. To cream butter, beat it in a basin with a wooden spoon or the hand, until it is of the consistency of cream ; add the sugar, and beat both together until quite light, from ten to fifteen minutes. If this is not done, heavy streaks will appear in the cakes. When baking-powder, soda, &c., are used, put them in just before mixing the cake and bake at once, otherwise the effervescence passes off and the powder is valueless. Be careful not to mix cakes in which the fat is rubbed into the flour too wet. This is a common mistake and makes them heavy. In follow ing any of the recipes given in this bock, do not grease the tins unless specially directed to do so, but line them with paper, following the directions for doing so exactly. Grease makes the crust of the cake liable to burn, but it is sometimes necessary. Cakes should bo put in the hottest part of the oven first, to throw them up and make them light. When this is done, place them in a more moderately heated part, and let them cook slowly. An inexperienced cook may test a cake, to see if it is cooked, by running a skewer into the centre. If it is cooked, the skewer will come out quite clean.

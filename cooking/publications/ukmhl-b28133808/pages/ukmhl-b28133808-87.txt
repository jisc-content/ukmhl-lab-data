67 sours. stock, as it is rich in gelatine, fish, or tho hones and trimmings of fish, being used for tho purpose. First Stock for Clear Soup. Ingredients. 4 lbs. of shin of beef, or 2 lbs. of shin of beef and 2 lbs. of knuckle of veal. 5 pints of cold water. 2 carrots. 2 turnips. 1 onion. i head of celery. The white part of a leek. 1 dozen peppercorns. 1 sprig of parsley, thyme, and marjoram. A bay leaf. Pepper and salt. Method.—Cut the meat into small pieces. Break up the bone and remove the marrow. Put bones and meat into the stock-pot with tho cold water. Let them soak for half an hour. Then put the pot on the fire, with a little salt, and gently simmer the contents for half an hour. Next put in the vegetables sliced, and tho herbs tied together, and peppercorns. Simmer for four and a half hours. Strain into a clean pan, and set aside to get cold. Note.—First stock must simmer only, not boil. (See preceding remarks.) Abroad, a fowl is generally used in addition in making tliis stock. White Stock. This may be made according to the directions given in the preceding recipe, using white meat instead of beef; knuckle of veal is considered the stock meat for white soup. Knuckle of veal and a rabbit or fowl make excellent stock. A very fair economical white stock may bo made by using bonos only in making the stock, and no meat; use a ham-bone, if possible, with the others, as this gives a nice flavour. Second Stock. For this, use any scraps of cooked or uncooked moat, with any bones. Allow one quart of water to every pound of meat and bones, and use vegetables in tho same pro- portion as directed for first stock.

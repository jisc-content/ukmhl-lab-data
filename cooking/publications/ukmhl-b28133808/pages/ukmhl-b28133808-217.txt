pish. 197 When the fat is hot enough, throw a small handful of the bait into the flour. Take hold of the cloth at each end and shake it rapidly, until the bait is well floured. Empty the bait without the least delay into a frying- basket. Shake that vigorously to let the loose flour drop out, and plunge into the hot fat. Fry until quite crisp. Then drain and serve at once, with thin brown bread and butter, and lemons cut in quarters lengthwise. If a large quantity is to be served, after they have all been fried, put them in the basket again, make the fat very hot and plunge in again for a few seconds. It is better, however, to send them to table in relays as soon as fried. Note.—Success in frying the whitebait dopends on quick flouring and very hot fat. If the flouring is made a lengthy process, the moisture of the bait makes a paste with the flour, and causes the bait to stick together, a common fault. If the fat is not very hot, the bait will not be crisp. Properly fried whitebait is perfectly crisp, and each fish distinct and separate. Although the bait must be crisp, care should be taken that it is not over-fried and dried up. Devilled Whitebait. Fry the Whitebait; well pepper it with white pepper, or slightly with red, and plunge again into the hot fat. Broiled Herrings. Scale and gut the fish without opening, and score them on either side : rub them over with salad oil and a little pepper and salt, broil over a very clear fire. Cook the roes in the oven and serve with them. Serve with a little maitre-d’hotel butter on them. Broiled Herrings (Another Method). Remove the heads and tails, split them down the back, and remove the bones; egg and bread-crumb them, and broil them. o

A COMPLETE COOKERY GUIDE. 16 THE KITCHEN. It is most desirable to have a largo and airy kitchen, with its arrangements as convenient as possible. This is the more important when elaborate dishes are expected to be prepared in it. There should be a proper supply of cooking utensils. It often happens that people who are very particular about tho furnishing of their other rooms, are very neglectful of their kitchens. It is not reasonable to expect very delicate cookery to be performed with tho few and common utensils found in many middle-class kitchens. Now that all kitchen appliances are so inex- pensive there is no reason why this should be so. If the kitchen is boarded, it is wise to have it covered with linoleum, as this saves a great deal of trouble in cleaning, and is in every way better than boards. If the cook has no kitchen-maid, and much cooking is expected of her, do not buy a quantity of utensils that require keeping bright, as these involve a great deal of labour, and are likely under such circumstances to be neglected. In furnishing a kitchen points like these require to be taken into consideration. Every kitchen should havo two or three strong tables, convenient cupboards, and a dresser. When buying cooking utensils do not omit to get a proper supply of common plates, basins and cups for cooking purposes. A cook is often much worried from the want of these things, and it leads generally to damages to breakfast and dinner services, which are very likely under such circumstances to be used for culinary purposes. A mistress has a right to expect that the kitchen and all utensils should be kept in clean and orderly condition ; but it is her duty to see that by wise arrangements she makes this possible without over- working those in her employ. On no account allow a kitchen to be overrun with mice and beetles, this is most disgusting, especially as they are sure to get on to food. 1 am afraid keeping a cat is the only way to get rid

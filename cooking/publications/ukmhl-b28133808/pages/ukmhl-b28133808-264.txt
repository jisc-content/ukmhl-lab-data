A COMPLETE COOKERY GUIDE. 218 Steamed Semolina Pudding. Ingredients. 3 ozs. of semolina. 1 pint of milk. 2 eggs. 2 ozs. of moist sugar. A little flavouring essence. Method.—Boil the semolina in the milk with the sugay until quite soft. Then add the flavouring essence and the yolks of the two eggs. Beat the whites up stiffly and mix them in lightly. Pour the mixture into a greased pudding-mould, and steam for one hour. Serve with a sweet sauce jam or stowed fruit. Method.—Put the flour into a basin, add to it a pinch of salt. Make a well in the middle, and put the two eggs into it; mix them smoothly with the flour, and add the milk very gradually. Melt the lard or dripping. Well season a small frying-pan, about the size of a cheese- plate. Put into it a teaspoonful of the melted fat, and let it run well over the pan. Then pour in enough batter to cover the pan thinly, and fry it brown, shaking the pan occasionally to keep it from burning. Then toss it on to the other side, and when that is fried turn it on to kitchen paper. Sprinkle with sugar and lemon juice and roll it up. Keep it hot while the remainder of the batter is fried in the same way. If the maker cannot toss the pancakes well, they may be turned with a broad-bladed knife. If they are fried in a large pan, more fat must be used. Pancakes. Ingredients. 1 lb. of flour. 2 eggs. 14)int of milk. Some lard or dripping for frying.

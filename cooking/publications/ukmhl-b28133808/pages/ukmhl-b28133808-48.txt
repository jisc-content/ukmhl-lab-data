28 A COMPLETE COOKERY GUIDE. RULES FOR BOILING, ROASTING, BAKING, STEWING, FRYING, BROILING, AND BRAISING. Rules for Boiling Meat. Put all meat, with the exception of tough sinewy pieces, and salted meats, into boiling water. Let the water well boil up after the meat is in it, then skim it, and lower the heat of the water to simmering point, and continue to cook it at this lower heat until the joint is tender. The general rule given as regards the length of time to bo allowed for cooking is a quarter of an hour to the pound, but this rule cannot always be followed, because the size and shape of the joint must bo taken into consideration as well as its weight; also whether it has much bone or whether it is solid meat throughout. Meat that has been well hung will cook in a shorter time than meat which has been freshly killed. It is, therefore, impossible to lay down hard and fast rules; experience is the best guide. Salt meat should be put into lukewarm water, to draw out some of the salt, and then be simmered until cooked. Twenty minutes to a pound should always bo allowed in cooking salt meat, as salt hardens the fibre of iho meat; and it therefore requires longer cooking to make it tender. Veal and pork are also allowed twenty minutes to the pound. When boiling meat, remove all the scum from the surface of the water—if this is not done it will settle on the joint and discolour it. The reasons for these rules are these—there is a substance in meat resembling white of egg, called albumen : by plunging the moat into boiling water, the albumen on the outsido is hardened and a casing formed, which serves to keep in, so far as it is possible to do so, the flavour and juices of the joint; the heat of the water

270 A COMPLETE COOKERY GUIDE. Dip them in frying batter and fry them in hot fat (see French Frying). Pour over them a little butter just melted, with which a little mustard and vinegar have been mixed, with a little salt and poppor. For other dishes suitable for breakfast, see gules, herrings, bloaters, dried haddock, kedgree, fish oakos, soused mackerel, rissolos, Cornish pasties, meat patties, &c. SICK-ROOM COOKERY. The Preparation of Dishes for Invalids. Beef-tea should never be boiled, but only simmered. Boiling hardens the albumen and fibrine, anil makes the tea less digestible. The safest way of cooking it is to put beef and water into a double saucepan, or beef extractor; or, failing either of these, into a jar, which should be covered closely, and put to stand in a saucepan of boiling water for three hours. Cooked in this way the tea cannot boil. Carefully follow the directions given for making this tea. The soaking of the meat in cold water is most important, as the albumen and other nutritious properties are thus drawn out. Pump, beef, or buttock steak make a far more nutritious tea than shin of beef, which contains a great deal of gelatine. Gruel is a most valuable preparation, very nutritious, and, when well cooked, very digestible. It must be made from the best oatmeal. Oatmeal should always be kept in a perfectly dry place. If allowed to become damp it gets a bitter taste. Arrowroot is not nutritious, it is almost a pure form of starch, and, therefore, heat-giving and force-producing only. It is, however, easily digested, and mixed with milk is very palatable; but the milk gives the dish its dietetic value. Barley water is a very nourishing drink, and a very pleasant one if nicely made. Pice water is considered of value in cases of diarrhoea.

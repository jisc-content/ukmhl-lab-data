212 A COMPLETE COOKEHY GUIDE. Trout. This is a very delicious fish, and may be broiled, steamed, baked, grilled or fried. When the fish is preferred simply dressed, it is better to bake it (see Baked Fish), as boiled trout is rather insipid. Genoese, Ilollandaise, caper, melted butter, mushroom, piquant, and may other sauces may be served with it. Broiled Trout. Thoroughly cleanse and dry the trout and split them down the back; season with a little salt, pepper, cayenne, lemon juice, and rub them over with a little salad oil. Broil over a very clear fire from five to ten minutes or more, according to the size of the fish. Serve browned butter, or any suitable sauce with it. Fried Trout. Split the fish in half and remove the bones; egg and bread-crumb, and fry in hot fat (see French Frying). Servo any sauce suitable for fried fish with it. Garnish with fried parsley. Perch and Bass. This fish may be cooked in any way suitable for trout, eels, carp, &c. Bartle, Roach, and Dace. These may be cooked in any way suitable to carp or tench, but they are much better fried. Pike and Jack. These are the same fish at different ages, the jack being a pike of not more than three pounds in weight. They may bo cooked in any way (see Directions for Cooking Fish), and served with piquant, caper, or any suitable sauce. Pike is very good stuffed and baked like cod. Grey Gurnet. See preceding Directions for pike and jack.

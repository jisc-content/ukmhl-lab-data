136 A COMPLETE COOKERY GUIDE. Stewed Giblets. Ingredients. 1 or 2 sets of giblets. 1 or 2 onions. 1 sprig of parsley, thyme, marjoram. 1 bay leaf. 1 blade of mace. Some stock. Flour. Method.— First prepare the giblets. Feathers can easily ho removed if the giblets are scalded. To remove clots of blood wash them in salt and water and rub with salt. Take the gall bladder from the liver without breaking it. Scald and skin the feet and the gizzard, open the gizzard and empty it. Then thoroughly wash the giblets in two or three waters. Cut the liver and gizzard in .two pieces, and chop the legs and pinions in two. Chop the beak from the head, and divide the head from the neck. Put the giblets in a stewpan with the stock and the vegetables, cut in small pieces. Simmer from one and a half to two hours, until quite tender, then thicken the gravy with the flour. Put the giblets on a hot dish and strain the gravy over. Garnish with fried or toasted sippets of bread. Note.—It is well to stew the gizzard for an hour previously to the cooking of the giblets as it takes a very long time to get really tender, When this cannot be done, it should not be served with the giblets. Lamb’s Fry. Wash the fry thoroughly and simmer, all but the liver, in stock or water for a quarter of an hour, then dry and slice it. Flour and fry in butter or dripping until cooked and brown. Put the fry on a hot dish, pour a little stock or water (stock is best) into the frying-pan. Stir and boil well, and then strain over the fry. Garnish with fried parsley.

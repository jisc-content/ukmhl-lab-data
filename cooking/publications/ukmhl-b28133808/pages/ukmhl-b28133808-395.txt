MSCHAUFFfiS OF COOKED MEAT, ETC. 379 Serve garnished with the sippets of fried or toasted bread. Oysters, tomatoes, or mushrooms, improve the flavour of' a hash. Two or three slices of pickled walnuts may be served in a hash of beef or mutton. In hashing hare, venison, or any game, a little port wine should be added to the gravy. If no stock or gravy is available, make some with the bones from the meat. Put them on with sufficient water to make the required quantity of gravy, a sliced onion, some pieces of carrot and turnip, a small bunch of herbs,— parsley, thyme, and marjoram,—and if at hand, some tomatoes and mushrooms; add pepper and salt, and boil gently from two to four hours. Then strain and remove the fat before thickening. Colour if necessary with a little gravy-colouring or burnt sugar, taking care not to use too much. Curry of Cold Meat. Scraps of cold meat. Some curry sauce. Ingredients. Boiled rice. Method.—Cut some cold meat into neat pieces, and simmer it for half an hour in sufficient curry-sauce (see Sauces) to moisten it. Serve with nicely-cooked rice. This may be placed as a wall round the curry, but it is better to have it handed in a separate dish. Cottage Pie. Ingredients. Slices of cold meat. Butler or dripping. Ruled potatoes. Pepper and salt. Stock or gravy. Method.—Season the meat with pepper and salt, and lay it in a pie-dish. Pour in a little gravy or stock.

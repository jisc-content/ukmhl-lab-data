154 â€¢ A COMPLETE COOKERY GUIDE. vegetables will bo preserved at tho expenso of their ilavour. All vegetables must bo boiled, not simmered, and they must bo cooked with the lid off the saucepan; if the steam is kept in, it will discolour them. Peas must be gently boiled; rapid boiling would break their skins. Young and old peas must not bo boiled together, or tho young ones will boil to a mash before the old ones aro cooked. Large and small peas must not be cooked together for tho same reason. While the vegetables are cooking remove all scum from the surface of the water. Tho length of time green vegetables will take to cook will depend entirely on their age and size. Young vegetables may take from ten to twenty minutes, older ones from twenty to thirty-five minutes. Loot xregetables take longer to cook than green ones. Carrots, turnips, and parsnips, should be cooked with the meat with which they are served, as their flavour is thereby improved. Yegetables should be taken up directly they are cooked, as they spoil if left in the water. Rules for Steaming Vegetables. Vegetables will take rather longer to steam than boil. They should bo prepared as for boiling, put into the steamer and sprinkled with salt. Tho water under the steamer must be kept boiling; if there is not a good force of steam, the vegetables will get sodden. Baked Vegetables. Tomatoes and mushrooms cook very well in the oven. Potatoes aro excellent cooked in this way. Vegetable marrows and beetroots have a finer flavour if baked, but require gentle cooking. To Boil Potatoes. If boiled in their skins, scrab them perfectly clean, and put them into a saucepan with sufficient boiling water to cover them; add a little salt, and boil them gently for half an hour or more until very nearly tender, but not quite. Then pour the water away.

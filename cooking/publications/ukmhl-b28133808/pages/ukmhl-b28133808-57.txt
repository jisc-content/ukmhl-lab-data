( 37 ) THE CHOICE OF MEAT, AND COOKING OF JOINTS. Beef. In England beef is divided thus:â€”The fore quarter is cut into fore-rib, which consists of 5 ribs; middle rib (4 ribs); chuck rib (3 ribs); the shoulder (or leg-of-mutton piece) ; the brisket (belly part of the ribs) ; the clod (fore shoulder-blade); neck, shin, and cheok. The hind quarter is divided (upper part) into sirloin, rump and aitcli bone,' the lower part is divided into buttock or round, mouse buttock, veiny piece, thick and thin flank (belly part) and leg. To Choose Beef. The flesh of ox beef is the best, and should be a fino red and loosely grained, the fat inclining to yellow and the suet firm. Heifer beef is closer in grain, not quite so bright in colour, the fat whiter and the bones smaller. The choicest and best fed beef will be delicately veined with fat. Avoid buying meat that is coarse in grain and dark in hue. This will probably be bull beef, Avhich will be found rank in flavour and tough. Avoid also beef in which the fat has a hard, skinny appearance and a line of gristly texture running through the meat of the ribs. These are signs of age. Very lean beef should also lie avoided, as it will be found hard and stringy. D

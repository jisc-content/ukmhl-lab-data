107 VEGETABLES. Rice for a Curry. Well wash some Patna rice. Throw it into plenty of boiling water with salt in it, and boil quickly until nearly, but not quite, cooked. This will take from seven to ten minutes. Strain the rice on a sieve and pour hot water over it, rinsing it thoroughly. Then finish cooking it either by putting it in the sauce- pan again and placing it by the side of the fire, or by putting the sieve in a very moderate oven. Success depends on thorough washing (and this is best done with warm water) to get rid of the rice flour, which makes it stick. Secondly, on cooking quickly in boiling water. Thirdly, on taking it up at the right moment, on thoroughly rinsing it and on the drying being perfect. liice for a curry should be dry (but not dried up), and each grain distinct and separate. There should be a slight firmness—not hardness—about it The rice will take longer to finish in a saucepan. A little butter should bo run round the saucepan to prevent it sticking. If finished in the oven, put the sieve to stand on a plate, and lightly move the rice occasionally with a fork. If wanted quickly, dry it in front of the fire. Rice for Children. Well wash some rice, and put it into a saucepan and pour in some hot water, about a quart of water to five ounces of rice. Let the rice cook gently until soft and the water absorbed. More water may possibly bo required. llice cooked thus may be used as a vegetable with meat for children, or with sugar, jam, or treacle. Cooked as for a curry, thero is great waste of its nutritious properties. n 2

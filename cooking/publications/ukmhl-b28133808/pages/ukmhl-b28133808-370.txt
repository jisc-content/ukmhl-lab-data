Drop on each piece of fruit a few drops of je’lv. When the fruit adheres to the layer of jelly in the mould, pour in gently sufficient cool sweet jelly to cover it. W hen that is firm, place in more fruit and proceed to set it in the same manner. Coutinue in this way until the mould is full. When quite set turn on to a glass or silver dish. (See Directions for Turning Jellies and Creams out of Moulds.) Note.—For setting fruit, &c., in jelly, be careful the jelly used is quite cool, but not at all set. It is well to put the mould on ice or to stand in cold water, that the jelly may set quickly. Eemember that the fruit, &c., that is put into a jelly will bo reversed in position when the jelly is turned out, and arrange it accordingly. Macedoine of Fruit in a Border Mould.

68 A COMPLETE COOKERY GUIDE. Boil the meat and bones gently for one hour, then put in the vegetables and boil for four hours and a half longer. Then strain. Bones may be put on again, with fresh stock material, if broken up, as they may be boiled a long time before the gelatine is thoroughly extracted. When cold, second stock should be a strong jelly. A fuller flavoured stock may be made by frying the vegetables in a little dripping before they are added to the meat. White Stock from Bones Uncooked. Ingredients. 4 lbs. of uncooked bones, with a ham-bone, if possible, amongst them. 5 pints of water. 2 carrots. 2 turnips. 1 large onion. Half a head of celery. 1 sprig of parsley. Thyme, marjoram, and a bay leaf. 1 blade of mace. Method.â€”Break up the bones, and put them with the vegetables, sliced, into a stock-pot with the water; boil gently for five hours, adding pepper and salt to taste. Then strain into a pan.

THE STUDY OF COOKERY. “ For good and well-chosen sauces are the most wholesome preparations of meats, and conduce both to health and to long life.” “The preparation of meats and bread and drinks, that they may be rightly handled, and in order to this intention, is of exceedingly great moment; howsomever it may seem a mechanical thing ami savouring of the kitchen and buttery ; yet it is of more consequence than those fables of gold and precious stones and the like.”—The History of Life and Death.—Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam. “ There is a best way of doing everything, if it be but to boil an egg.—Emerson. No one can expect to become proficient in the art, or to understand the science, of cookery who is not prepared to devote considerable time to the practice and study of it. Unfortunately, English people are slow' in realizing this fact; and until they do so, no particular improvement is probable or even possible in the cookery of this country. For cookery, rightly understood, cannot be acquired by the learning of a few' miscellaneous dishes, together with some slight study of the theory. The ability to prepare a few dishes fairly w'ell from recipes does not make a woman a cook in the proper sense of the word. Educated people do not think that the slight knowledge of drawing necessary for the sketching of a few flow-ers (just re- cognizable as such), on a picture-frame, milking-stool, or tambourine, will entitle a woman to be considered an artist; or that the smattering of music with w'hich she shuffles off her hearers’ sodls “ through hurricanes of notes to a noisy Tophet,” gives her claim to rank as a musiciun. A smattering of cookery can be productive of no better results than a smattering of drawing or music. Indeed, it cannot be too strongly insisted on, that no proper or adequate knowledge of cookery can be obtained without as rffid nod honest work as that necessary for any other art

Ingredients. 1 dozen sponge fingers. 1 oz. of glacd cliervies. i oz. of amber gelatine melted in a little milk, or less than i oz. of the opaque. 1 pint of double cream. 2 dessertspoonfuls of castor sugar. A few drops of essence of vanilla or other flavouring. Method.â€”First put the gelatine to soak in a little milk. Then cut the cherries in halves and place them in a circle round the bottom of a plain round mould, with the cut side uppermost. Divide the sponge fingers lengthwise, without breaking them, and trim each ono at the side, top and bottom neatly. Then line the tin with them, placing them on the top of the cherries, with the brown side next the tin; they should be put close together, and the last should serve as a wedge to keep the others in place. Beat up the cream stiffly with the sugar. Add the vanilla flavouring and the melted gelatine. This must bo neither too hot nor too cold. Stir it thoroughly but quickly into the cream, and pour at once into the prepared tin. When set, dip the bottom of the tin into hot water for a second, and turn it carefully on to a glass dish.

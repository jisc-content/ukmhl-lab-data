( 65 ) STOCKS AND SOUPS. Few peoplo succeed in making good soups, for the reason that very few understand the making of 8tool:, the foundation of soups. To make a good soup it is essential the stock he well flavoured. The stock-pot is said to be a great preventive of waste, and it certainly is when properly used, but not when, as is too often the case, materials are thrown into it with as little consideration as they are thrown into the hog-tub. The result of such random cookery is generally to produce a poor, stale- tasting broth, quite unworthy the name of stock. To make stock well there are one or two points to be kept in mind; the first is that when raw meat is used the object to be first attained is the extraction of its juices; when bones or cooked meat, the extraction of the gelatine ; also it is well to remember that when vegetables have parted with their flavour they are worse than useless if left in the Btock, as they impoverish it by absorbing the meat flavours. When making a stock from fresh meat cut the meat up very small and soak it in the water, which must be cold ; add to it a little salt. Cold water loosens the juices of the meat, and salt assists its action. Then put the stock-pot on the fire and simmer for half an hour; add the vegetables and simmer for four hours and a half longer. Full directions for making stock in this way will be found under the heading, First Stock for clear soup. In making that stock no skimming is necessary. The scum which rises to the top is only (provided the stock- pot and vegetables are all, as they should be, perfectly clean) albumen from the meat; this rises before simmer- ing point and brings with it other soluble matters, and the removal of this from the stock impoverishes it. Neither is it necessary to let the steam escape while the stock is in preparation; an escapo of steam means an

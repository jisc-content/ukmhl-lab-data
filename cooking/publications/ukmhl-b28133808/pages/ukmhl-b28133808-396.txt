A COMPLETE COOlvliRY GUIDE. 3S0 .Shape as much like a pie-cnist as possible, smoothing it with a knife dipped in hot water. Bake for about half an hour. If liked, the pie may bo brushed with beaten egg, which will give it the appearance of a pastry-crust. Beef with Piquant Sauce. Ingredients. Slices of underdone beef. | Some piquant sauce (see Sauces). Method.—Make the beef hot in enough sauce to moisten nicely. Serve and garnish like a hash. Tomato-sauce may bo substituted for piquant if preferred. Mince of Cold Meat. Ingredients. Scraps of cold meat (pieces that are too small for hashing may be used for this purpose). Some nice gravy. Well-cooked rice, or boiled and mashed potatoes. Pepper and salt. Method.—Pass the meat through a mincing-machine or cut it into small dice with a knife (the flavour is far better when the machine is not used). Mix with sufficient gravy to moisten the meat, and season with pepper and salt. Stir over the fire until hot, but do not let it boil. Serve either with sippets of fried or toasted bread, or bordered with boiled rice, macaroni, or mashed potatoes. When veal or chicken is used, add a few drops of lemon juice to the gravy, and hand quarters of lemon with it, cut lengthways. With these minces use a little cooked ham ; also, if liked, hard-boiled eggs. Bechamel sauce may bo substituted for gravy. Mince is sometimes served with nicely-poachcd eggs placed on it.

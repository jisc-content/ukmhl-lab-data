A COMPLETE COOKERY GUIDE. 110 flour and fry slightly, put in tho tomatoes, sliced, and cook all together for a few minutes. Then empty the contents of the frying-pan on to a hair siove, and rub the tomatoos through. Put tho sauce into a stowpan, add the vinegar and seasoning, and make the sauce boil. If the sauce is too thin, reduce it by boiling. It may be enriched with the addition of a little glaze. Mayonnaise Sauce. Ingredients. 2 raw yolks of eggs, perfectly freed from the germs. i piut of best salad oil. 2 tablespoonfuls of tarragon, French, or plain vinegar. Pepper and salt. Method.—Put the yolks into a basin with a little salt, and stir them quickly with a whisk, or wooden spoon, dropping the oil on them drop by drop, until the sauce is as thick as butter in the warm weatlior, then add tho vinegar and remainder of seasoning. Note.—Success in making this sanco will depend on adding the oil very gradually to tho yolks. It should also be made in a very cool place to prevent the sauce curdling. If this does occur, put a yolk in another basin and pour the curdled sauce slowly on it. This will bring it smooth again. When the sauce is made it is well to mix a tablespoonful of warm water with it; this will effectually prevent it curdling. This sauce, when properly mado, should be of the con- sistency of very thick cream. When it is intended for coating cold entrees, &c., mix with it, before using, half a gill of liquid, but quite cold, aspic jelly. Note.—Some people mix oil and vinegar together in making this sauco, using a tcaspoonful of vinegar to every seven of oil; but I think tho plan mentioned in this recipe is the best. Tartare Sauce. Make like mayonnaise, adding to every half-pint one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, one tablespoonful of chopped capers and gherkins, and a teaspoonful ol mixed mustard.

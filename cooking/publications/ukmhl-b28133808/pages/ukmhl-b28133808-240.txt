220 A COMPLETE COOKERY GUIDE. lard and makes lighter paste. A little butter rolled in after it is made, as in flaky crust, makes this paste extremely light. Beef-Steak Pie. Ingredients. 2 lbs. of nice beef steak. $ lb. of bullock’s kidney. 1 lb. of flaky or rough puff paste. 1 tablespoonful of flour. 4 pint of water. Pepper and salt. Method.—Eoll the paste to a quarter of an inch in thickness. Invert the pie-dish, and cut the paste to the sizo and shape of the under side of it. Eoll out the remainder, cut a band one inch wide. Wet the edge of the pie-dish and place this round it. Cut the beef into thin strips, dip them in flour, and season with pepper and salt. Eoll each of the strips round a tiny piece of fat. Put them in the pie-dish alternately with pieces of kidney. Eaise them in the middle of the dish in a dome form, and pour in the water. Wet the edges of the paste lining the the dish, and lay the cover over. Press the edges lightly together, and trim round with a knife. Make a hole in the middle of the paste to let the gases from the meat escape. Brush the crust with beaten egg, and decorate with leaves cut from the trimmings. Bake for about two hours. The pie should be put into a quick oven until the pastry is cooked; the heat must then be moderated to cook the meat thoroughly without drying up the pastry. If possible finish cooking the moat on the top of the oven. Some people prefer stewing the meat before using it in the pie. If this is dono, it must be allowed to get cold before the pie is made. It is an improvement to the pio to put layers of ■ oysters, bearded, alternately with the rolls of beef; or larks may be put in, boned and stuffed with imitation foie gras.

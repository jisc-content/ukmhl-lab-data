( 357 ) CREAMS. To Make Creams. To make a good cream, it is essential that the cream should be double, that is, a thick cream that will whip up to a stiff froth. Beat it well with a wire whisk until it will stand on the end of it without dropping. This must be done in a cool place, especially in summer time. Cream is liable to curdle, and turn to butter, if beaten in too warm a temperature. The gelatine must be added last of all. It should be stirred in thoroughly but quichly ; it must not be too hot or too cold, but just lukewarm. If too hot it destroys the lightness of the cream and does not mix with it, but will run to the bottom of the mould, where it will lie like a layer of glue; if too cold it begins to set immediately and cannot be thoroughly mixed with the cream. Pour the cream into a mould as soon as the gelatine is mixed with it, as it begins to set directly. To turn a cream out of its mould take a basin of hot water, as hot as the hand can bear, draw the mould quickly through it, letting the water quite cover it for a second. Quickly wipe off all moisture. Shake the tin gently to bo sure the contents are free. Lay the dish on the open side of the mould, quickly reverse it, and draw the mould carefully away.

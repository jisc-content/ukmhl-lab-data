A COMPLETE COOKERY GUIDE. 452 PRESERVING. Fruit for preserving should be sound and fresh; it should bo gathered in dry weather, on the morning of a sunny day, but not so early that it has the dew on - it. If gathered in damp weather, the jam will Ret mouldy. The fruit should bo made into jam as soon as possiblo after picking it. The best sugar is cheapest in the end, as there is less scum from it. It must be broken small, but not crashed, or the syrup will not be clear. In making the jam, stir it carefully the whole time, skimming thoroughly. Do not leave it, or it may catch. 'When a little poured on a plate will set, it is ready. Be careful not to over-cook it. If too little sugar is used in making jam, it will not keep; if too much, it will candy. Stir always with a wooden spoon or spatula, metal is apt to spoil the colour. Be careful that the pan is raised a little from the fire and not directly over it; the sugar causes preserves to catch very quickly. The length of time jam will take in making will depend on the method employed, the kind of fruit, and whether it is quickly or sloioly boiled. As a matter of fact, it is impossible to lay down any hard-and-fast rule; experience is the bast guide. A certain quantity of the water in the fruit must bo forced off, and this will be more quickly accomplished by boiling quickly than by slow cooking, but the heat required for the quick boiling will make the danger of the jam burning greater. In the following directions the time mentioned is intended as a guide only, as not only will the time vary

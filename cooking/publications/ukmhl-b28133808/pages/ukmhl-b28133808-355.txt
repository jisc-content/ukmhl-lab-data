( 339 ) COLD ENTREES, SUPPER DISHES, AND SALADS. In the preparation of Salads the thorough cleaning of the plants used must first he carefully attended to. It is dis- gusting to find worms and small insects left on the leaves through carelessness in preparation. Wash the salad well, pulling the leaves apart. If necessary, let it lie in water a short time to crisp it. Then either put it in a draught where it will dry quickly, or shake it in a cloth, care being taken that the leaves are not bruised. The leaves of salads should never be minced, as doing so spoils the flavour. Either pull them to pieces or cut them in fairly large pieces with a sharp knife. Salad should never be left soaking in the water f«>r any length of time. If necessary to keep it from one day to another, take it from the water, shake it, and lay it on a dish, cover it closely with another, and put in a cold place. In this way it will keep perfectly fresh. M^daillons de Volaille.—Medallions of Chicken. Ingredient.

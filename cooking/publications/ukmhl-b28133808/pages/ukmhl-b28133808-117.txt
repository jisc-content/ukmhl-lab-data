( 9? ) SAUCES. Be careful in making any sauce with flour in it to well cook the flour, otherwise it will have a raw pasty taste, which is anything hut agreeable. The consistency of a sauce should depend on the purpose for which it is in- tended. Such as oyster and lobster are served fairly thick ; a sauce for coating quenelles or fillets, etc., just thick enough to cover without disguising them. Proportions are given for each sauce in the following recipes; but, as different flours vary as to the quantity of moisture they will absorb, sometimes a little more liquid may be found necessary, or sometimes a little less than the quantity stated. Exact weights and measures should however be taken in the first instance; the “ rule of thumb ” is ever a cause of failure. The high-class sauces are simmered for some time after they are made, and the butter in them is skimmed off as it rises to the surface. They are then rubbed or wrung through a tammy cloth, to make them very smooth and creamy. The washing of the tammy cloths should bo very perfect, other- wise they will be liable to give an unpleasant taste to the sauco. The seasoning of the sauces must be carefully attended to.

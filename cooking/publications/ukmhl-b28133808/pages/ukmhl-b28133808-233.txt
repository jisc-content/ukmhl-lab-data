( 213 ) PASTRY. To be successful in making the ordinary kinds of pastry it is necessary that the following rules should bo carefully attended to. Make the pastry in a cool place, not in a hot kitchen. The board or slab, rolling-pin, and hands should be as cold as possible. Handle it very lightly. The colder pastry is kept during making the lighter it will be, because it will contain more air. Cold air occupies much less space than hot. The colder the air the greater consequently will be its expansion when put into a hot oven. The paste must be handled and rolled lightly. Heavy rolling and handling expels the air. Puff paste is a kind of fine sandwich. There should be a certain number of layers of dough and layers of butter. Take every care, therefore, to prevent the butter breaking through the dough. Be specially careful to follow the directions given for making this pastry. Its manufacture requires patience, because if it is not pro- perly cooled between the turns the friction of rolling will melt the butter and cause it to smear into the dough. In making short crust rub the butter or fat lightly into the flour with the tips of the fingers, and do not use more water than possible in mixing it. This is a common mistake and deprives the paste of its shortness. Short paste is the best for children and people of weak diges- tion ; the flour in it being more thoroughly incorporated with the fat gets better cooked. It is also more capable of mastication than flaky crusts, which are liable to be swallowed in flakes. However well the pastry may be made, success will not be attained unless the oven is rightly heated; the very lightest crusts will be totally spoiled in the baking if this important point is not carefully attended to. If the oven is not very hot the fat will melt and run out of the X'

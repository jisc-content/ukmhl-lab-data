BREAKFAST DISHES AND BEVERAGES. 2(37 Cafe N oir. This is very strong, served without milk. Sugar is handed with it.* Burnt Coffee. This is strong coffee sweetened with sugar.

Method.—Put the coffee into a large muslin bag, tie it securely. Put it into a saucepan or kettle of cold water, heat gradually, and boil for ten minutes. Strain well before using. This will make strong coffee, which can be diluted with boiling water as required. Tea. The water for tea should be, if pos-ible, freshly boiling. Water that has boiled for any length of time gets flat and insipid from loss of its gases. It is essential that it shall be actually boiling at the timo it is poured on tho tea. For people of weak digestion the tea should not be infused longer than fivo minutes, after that timo the tannin is extracted in sufficient quantity to have an injurious effect on the nervous system. When tea has to be kept hot for any length of time, the leaves should bo removed from it. If left on them, it not only becomes unwholesome, but nauseous and bitter in taste. It is a good plan to infuse the tea in one pot and then pour it into another heated one, which should then bo covered with a cosy; or the tea may be put in a muslin bag large enough for tho leaves to have plenty of room to swoll; ibis can be easily removed, and the tea can then be kept hot without any deterioration of its quality. * These preparations of coffee are served after dinner—not for breakfast.

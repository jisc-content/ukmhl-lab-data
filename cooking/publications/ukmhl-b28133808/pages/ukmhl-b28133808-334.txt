Some well-cooked green peas or other suitable vegetables. A border of mashed potatoes. Egg and bread-crumbs. Method.—Cook and press the feet as in preceding recipe. When cold, cut into pear or cutlet shapes, spread the one side over with quenelle meat, with truffle mixed in it; heap it a little in the centre and smooth it with a knife dipped in hot water. Cover each with a piece of pig’s caul, put the cutlets on a greased saute-pan, and put in a moderate oven until the quenelle meat is cooked, then egg and hiead-crumb twice, and fry in hot fat (see French Frying). Dish on a border of mashed potatoes, pour tomato sauce over, and put the vegetables in the centre of the dish. A more economical entree may be made by substituting sausage for quenelle meat. Cotelettes de Veau.—Veal Cutlets. 2 lbs. of veal cutlet. Egg and bread-crumbs. 3 a/.', of clarified butter. Ingredients. Some mashed potatoes or well- cooked spinach. Some slices of bacon. Method.—Cut the cutlet into slices, and then beat with a wet cutlet-bat, to break the fibre of the meat. Trim into nice oval-shaped cutlets, brush with egg and cover them with crumbs, flattening this on with the lat or knife. Fry them in the butter. Dish in a circle, the one overlapping the other, on a border of mashed potatoes or spinach, and put nicely cooked little rolls of bacon in the centre of the dish. To cook the bacon, roll thin slices of streaky bacon, run a skewer through them, and either toast or bako them. Tomato, piquant, or any other suitable sauce may bo poured round the base of the dish or handed in a boat.

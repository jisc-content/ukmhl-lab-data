Ingredients. 6 oes. of flour. 8 ozs. of castor sugar. 6 ozs. of butter. 7 eggs. Method.—Melt the butter in a stewpan, and brush over a saute-pan or shallow cake-tin with it. Line the pan with paper, and brush that also with the melted butter. Break the eggs into a basin. Add to them the sugar, and beat with a whisk for about twenty minutes until they rise. The basin containing them may be placed on a sauce- pan of hot water, but care must be taken that the heat is not too great, as that would cook the eggs. When the eggs are sufficiently beaten, stir in the flour and butter very lightly. If beaten in, the pastry will not be light. Pour tho mixture into a pan and bake for about an hour.

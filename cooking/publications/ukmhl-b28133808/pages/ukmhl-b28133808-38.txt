Buy groceries in large quantities, as they are less expensive. But preserved fruits and jams in the coolest part of the room. Keep tea in a lead-lined chest. Onions and any vegetables of that sort should he stored in a separate place; onions are made into ropes, which are suspended from the ceiling. Herbs should he dried and fastened separately in paper hags. Oranges and lemons should each be wrapped in tissue paper; it is not wise to buy them in large quantities. Buy coffee in small quantities, as it quickly loses it aroma. Apples should bo wiped and laid on the floor, but not touching; it is better to store them in an outhouse, as they have an un- pleasantly strong smell. Eggs should be kept by placing them upright, small end down, in sawdust, or on wooden shelves with holes in them made specially for this purpose; biscuits in tightly-fitting tin boxes, or they get soft; currants, sugar, and almost all groceries in canisters labelled with their names.

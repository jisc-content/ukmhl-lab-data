( 11 ) HINTS ON TABLE DECORATIONS. In these days of rapidly-changing fashions in table decorations it is scarcely possible to give any definite directions on the subject, and indeed a little education “ in those laws of beauty, which are as eternal as any other of Nature’s laws,” is what people chiefly require. A few hints on the subject may, however, be useful. Make the floral decorations as light-looking as possible. 'Whole plants, however pretty and graceful, are to be avoided, as they give a heavy look to the table. Small vases, high or low, filled lightly with a few flowers and ferns, always look well, whatever may be the prevailing fashion. It is best to keep to one or two colours, and to have everything elso as nearly to correspond as possible. The table linen should bo of the best quality, .and faultlessly “ got up,” and the silver and glass should be as bright as possible. The appearance of the table does not depend on its floral decorations only; the silver, glass, and dessert-dishes have much to do with making or marring the offcct. The fashion which, although not now so universal as it was, still very generally prevails, of putting the dessert on the table before the commence- ment of dinner, is not to be recommended, especially when much of the fruit is fresh, as it is by no means so cool and refreshing after being kept sotno time in a heated room. There is no sonso in running counter to prevailing fashions so long as they are good ones, but too slavish an adherence to fashion in every instance, whether sensible or not, is an indication of want of individuality and common sense.

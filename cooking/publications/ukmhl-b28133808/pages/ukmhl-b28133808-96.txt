76 A COMPLETE! COOKERY GUIDE. Boil the stock in another saucepan, and, when boiling, pour it on to the vegetables. Simmer gently until the vegetables are quite tender. Beat the yolks of the eggs with the cream, and when the stock has cooled a little, strain them through a hair- sieve into it. Put the stewpan by the fire, and stir until the eggs thicken, taking care that the stock does not boil, as that would curdle them. Add pepper and salt to taste, and the soup is ready. The crust of a French roll should be served in the soup; it should be baked in the oven, and then cut into fancy shapes. Potage de Likvre.—Hare Soup. 1 hare. 1 lb. of gravy beef. 1 carrot. 1 turnip. 1 onion. 1 bay leaf. Ingredients. 1 sprig of parsley, thyme, and marjoram. 1 dozen peppercorns. 1 blade of mace and 6 cloves. 2 or 3 ozs. of butter or dripping. 7 pints of water. Method.—Cut the hare into joints, and tho meat into pieces, and fry them in a stewpan in tho butter or dripping. Afterwards fry tho vegetables in the same fat. Then pour in the water, add the mace and pepporcoms, and simmer gently from four to five hours. Strain tho stock and let it get cold. Kemove the fat perfectly, and put it into a clean stew- pan on the fire. When it boils stir in a thickening of flour, using one ounce of flour to every pint of soup. Cook the flour well, and add a little colouring if necessary. Season to taste, and just before serving pour in two glasses of port wine. Some forcemeat balls should be served in the soup. Make them with veal forcemeat, mixed with the liver of the hare finely chopped, and bake thorn in tho oven or fry them.

THE LARDER. 17 of the former. For tho beetles Penny’s magic paste is worthy of its name. After a lengthy crusade against beetles, in which I tried traps, powders, &c., without appearing to diminish their numbers, I tried the paste, and in four days the house was free from them, and there were, happily, no funeral rites to be pei formed as after the use of traps and powders. It is possible that any phosphorus paste may have the same effect, but I cannot tay; I have twice used the magic paste with perfect success. When it is used keep dogs and cats away. It is true they won’t eat the paste, but they are quite likely to eat poisoned beetles. Note.—In furnishing a kitchen do not forgot a clock. THE LARDER. The larder should be cool and dry, and be kept scrupulously clean. It should be provided with shelves, covers for meat, butler coolers, and a pan for bread. The contents should be inspected each day by the mistress of the house, unless she keeps some responsible person to do this for her. Neglect of this duty often leads to great and culpable waste, especially if the cook is not experienced. 'The condition of meat and poultry should be carefully examined. In hot weather this is especially necessary. Stock too is apt to turn sour very quickly when the weather is sultry if not reboiled. Tainted meat, sour soup, and butter like oil, are sure in hot weather to be the indications, amongst others, of a neglected larder. Most people like bread kept in a pan, it keeps it moist, but, unfortunately, softens the crust. In large houses there are usually several larders, and they are necessary, as game and uncooked meat should not be kept with other foods.

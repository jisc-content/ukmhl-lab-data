1S6 A COMPLETE COOKERY GUIDE. Small cod, salmon, &c., if boiled whole should be trussed in the form of the letter S. Steamed Fish. For this method of cooking a fish-steamer will be required, unless the fish is small, where an ordinary steamer or saucepan may be used. Keep the water under the steamer boiling briskly all the time the fish is cooking, otherwise thero will not bo sufficient force of steam, and the fish will be sodden. Steamed fish is said to lose less in weight and flavour than boiled fish. It takes, however, longer to cook. Baked Fish. The oven must be kept at a very moderate heat, that the fish may not be dried up. Small fish, fillets, cutlets, &c., may be cooked with great advantage in the oven, if covered with buttered paper, which will keep them moist, and prevent any baked flavour. The fish must be placed in a slightly buttered saute-pan or baking-tin. Fried Fish. Small fish, such as whiting, smelts, dm., are generally fried whole. Larger fish, such as salmon, and cod, &c., are fried in the form of cutlets or fillets. Fish to be fried must be covered with eggs and crumbs, batter, or flour. A stewpan or fish-frier, half full of fat, and not a frying-pan, should be used for the purpose (see French Frying). The bread-crumbs for frying should bo made by rubbing stale bread through a wire sieve. The egg should be well beaten, otherwise it will not adhere to the fish. Woll dry the fish in a cloth before preparing it for frying. Turbot. Cook it according to tho Directions given for Boiling,

A COMPLETE COOKERY GUIDE. 210 To Turn a Pudding out of its Mould or Cloth. First lift it from the saucepan by taking it firmly on a fork. Reverse the saucepan-lid and let the pudding rest on it, holding them both obliquely that the water may run away. Then lift it on to a plate, untie the cloth and cut the string. Remove the cloth carefully, then take the basin in the hands, holding a cloth round it to prevent it burning them. Shake it gently to ascertain that the pudding is quite free from the mould, then reverse it on a dish, and remove the mould carefully. In turning out a pudding, guard against impatience or haste. Turning it out too quickly, without being sure that it is free from the mould, will sometimes cause it to break and have an unsightly appearance. When the pudding is in a cloth, untie the strings and draw the cloth a little from the sides of the pudding, then reverse it on a hot dish, and draw the cloth carefully away. In turning baked puddings out of the tins, cut them first into neat squares, and then slip a knife under them, to be quite sure they are free from the tin before re- moving them. Yeast Dumplings.

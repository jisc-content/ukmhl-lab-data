SAVOURY MEAT DISHES SUITABLE FOR REMOVES. 143 Method.—Remove all the bone, and lay the forcemeat on the inside of the cheek and roll it up, secure it firmly •with string. Cut the vegetables in pieces and lay them in the bottom of a braising-pan, and put the meat on them. Pour in enough stock to come half way up the meat, cover it with buttered paper and braise (see Directions for Braising) for three or four hours until the meat is tender. The meat should be constantly basted while cooking. Put it on a hot dish inside the oven to keep it hot. Strain the stock into a stewpan, and boil it rapidly down to a glaze. Remove the string, and put, if necessary, silver skewers in the place. Tour the glaze over, and garnish with vegetables. The vegetables used may be carrots and turnips, cut into fancy shapes, cooked and glazed; small mushrooms sauteed in butter, or spinach. Braised Saddle of Lamb. 1 saddle of lamb. Some veal forcemeat. Ingredients. Some strong second stock. Method.—Bono the saddle very carefully. Stuff and cook it according to directions given for braising loin of veal (see Galantine of Veal). Press it in the same manner. For serving make it hot in stock, taking care it does not boil. When dished, pour glaze over it, and garnish with truffles, mushrooms, cockscombs, or carrots and turnips, cut in fancy shapes and glazed (see Garnishes), or it may be served with baked tomatoes. Half glaze should bo handed in a boat. If served cold, it may bo decoratod with aspic and garnished with salad plants.

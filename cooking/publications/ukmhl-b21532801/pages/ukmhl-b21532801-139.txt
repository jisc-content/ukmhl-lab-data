Hogs are kept to a larger size ; the chine (or back- bone) is cut down on each side, the whole length, and is a prime part either boiled or roasted. The sides of the hog are made into bacon, and the inside is cut out with a very little meat to the bone. On each side there is a large spare-rib; which is usually divided into two, one sweet-bone and a blade-bone. The bacon is the whole outside, and contains a fore- leg, and a ham ; which last is the hind-leg, but if left with the bacon is called a gammon. There are also griskins. Ilog's lard is the inner fat of the bacon-hog. Pickled pork is made of the flesh of the hog, as well as bacon.

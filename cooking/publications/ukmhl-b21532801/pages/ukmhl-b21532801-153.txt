MUTTON’. 75 Rub the salts well in, and turn it every day fora month- Drain, and smoke it a few days; or dry without by ranging in the kitchen, not near the fire. The manner of curing Wiltshire Bacon. Sprinkle each flitch with salt, and let the blood drain off for twenty-four horn’s : then mix a pound and a half >f coarse sugar, the same quantity of bay-salt, not quite '0 much as half a pound of saltpetre, and a pound of ■ommon salt ; and rub this well on the bacon, turning t every day for a month: then hang it to dry, and after- .vards smoke it ten days. This quantity of salts is suffi- •ient for the whole hog. MUTTON. Observations on keeping and dressing Mutton. Take away the pipe that runs along the bone of the inside of a chine of mutton; and if to be kept a great time, rub the part close round the tail with salt, after first cutting out the kernel. The kernel in the fat on the thick part of the leg should he taken out by the butcher, for it taints first there. The chine and rib bones should be wiped every- day ; and the bloody part of the neck be cut off, to preserve it. The brisket changes first in the breast; and if it i3 to be kept, it is best to rub it with a little salt, should the weather be hot. Every kernel should be taken out of all sorts of meat as soon as brought in : then wipe dry. For roasting, it should hang as long as it will keep, the hind-quarter especially, but not so long as to taint; for whatever fashion may authorize, putrid juices ought not to be taken into the stomach. Mutton for boiling will not look of a good colour if it has hung long. Great care should be taken to preserve by paper the Gt of what is roasted.

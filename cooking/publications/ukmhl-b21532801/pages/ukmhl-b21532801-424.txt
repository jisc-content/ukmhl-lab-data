Omlet. Macaroni. Oysters in Scallops, stewed or pickled. Having thus named the sort of things used for the two courses, the reader will think of many others. For removes of Soup and Fish, one or two joints of Meat or Fowl are served; and for one small course, the articles suited to the second must make a part. Where Vege- tables and Fowls, &c. are twice dressed, they add to the appearance of the table the first time; three sweet things may form the second appearance without greater expense. The Bills of Fare which have been given from page 233 to 345, may be modified at discretion. In some houses, one dish at a time is sent up with the vegetables or sauces proper to it, and this in succession hot and hot. In others, a course of Soups and Fish; then Meats and boiled Fowls, Turkey, &c. Made

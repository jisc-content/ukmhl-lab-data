DOMESTIC COOKERY. 266 ounces of currants, washed and dried, and some pi- mento finely powdered. Put three spoonfuls of yeast into a Winchester pint of new milk warmed, and mix into a light dough with the above. Make it into twelve cakes, and bake on a floured tin half an hour. Little Plum Calces, to keep long. Dry one pound of flour, and mix with six ounces of finely pounded sugar ; beat six ounces of butter to a cream, and add to three eggs, well beaten, half a pound of currants washed, and nicely dried, and the flour and sugar ; beat all for some time, then dredge flour on tin plates, and drop the batter on them the size of a walnut. If properl}' mixed, it will be a stiff paste. Bake in a brisk oven. A good Pound Cake. Beat a pound of butter to a cream, and mix with it the whites and yolks of eight eggs beaten apart. Have ready warm by the fire, a pound of flour, and the same of sifted sugar, mix them and a few cloves, a little nut- meg and cinnamon in fine powder together ; then by de- grees work the dry ingredients into the butter and eggs. When well beaten, add a glass of wine and some cara- ways. It must be beaten a full hour. Butter a pan, and bake it a full hour in a quick oven. The above proportions, leaving out four ounces of the butter, and the same of sugar, make a less luscious cake, and to most tastes a more pleasant one. A cheap Seed Cake. Mix a quarter of a peck of flour with half a pound of sugar, a quarter of an ounce of allspice, and a little ginger ; melt three quarters of a pound of butter, with half a pint of milk ; when just warm, put to it a quarter ef a pint of yeast, and work up to a good dough. Let it stand before the fire a few minutes before it goes to the oven ; add seeds, or currants, and bake an hour and a half.

DOMESTIC COOKERl'. 2’20 stew-pan, with a bit of butter, a good slice of barn, and an onion. Stew it over a very gentle fire till tender ; have ready a mould lined with very thin slices of bacon; mix the yolks of two or three eggs with the rice, and then line the bacon with it about half an inch thick; put into it a ragout of chicken, rabbit, veal, or of any thing else.

In the latter case, each half egg has but one ingredient. Curled butter and parsley may be put as garnish between. Macaroni as usually served.

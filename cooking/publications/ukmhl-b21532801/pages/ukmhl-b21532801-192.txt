114 DOMESTIC COOKERY. rots, six turnips, six potatoes, six large onions, a bunch of sweet herbs, and two heads of celery. Simmer them without the meat, till the vegetables are done enough to pulp with the peas through a sieve : and the soup Wi11 then be about the thickness of cream. Season it with pepper, salt mace, allspice, a clove or two, and a little Cayenne, all in fine powder. If the peas are bad, t le Boup may not be thick enough; then boil in it a slice of roll, and put it through the colander; or add a little nce- fiour, mixing it by degrees. For the Ragout, cut the nicest part of the head, the kernels, and part of the fat of the root of the tongue, into small thick pieces. Rub these with some of the above seasoning, as you put them into a quart of the li- quor, kept out for that purpose before the vegetables were added; flour well, and simmer them till nicely tender. Then put a little mushroom and walnut-ket- chup, a little soy, a glass of port wine, and a tea-spoon- ful of made mustard; and boil all up together before served. If for company, small eggs and forcemeat- balls. This way furnishes an excellent soup and a ragout at a small expense, and they are not common. The other part will warm for the family. Soup a-la-sap. Boil half a pound of grated potatoes, a pound of beef sliced thin, a pint of grey peas, an onion, and three ounces of rice, in six pints of water to five; strain it through a colander; then pulp the peas to it, and turn it into a sauce-pan again with two heads of celery sliced. Stew it tender, and add pepper and salt; and when you serve add also fried bread. Portable Soup. Boil one or two knuckles of veal, one or two shins of beef, and three pounds of beef, in as much water only as will cover them. Take the marrow out of the bones.

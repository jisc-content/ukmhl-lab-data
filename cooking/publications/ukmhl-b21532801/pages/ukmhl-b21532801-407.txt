DIRECTIONS TO SERVANTS. 32? mark. It is therefore better to rub it quick, and repeat if not quite removed. Floor-cloths Should he chosen that are painted on a fine cloth, that is well covered with the colour, and the flowers ou which do not rise much above the ground, as they wear out first. The durability of the cloth will depend much on these two particulars, but more especially on the time it has been painted, and the goodness of the colours. If they have not been allowed sufficient space for becoming thoroughly hardened, a very little use will injure them; and as they are very expensive articles, care in preserv- ing them is necessary. It answers to keep them some time before they are used, either hung up in a dry barn where they will have air, or laid down in a spare room. When taken up for the winter, they should be rolled round a carpet roller, and observe not to crack the paint by turning the edges in too suddenly. Old carpets answer extremely well, painted and sea- soned some months before laid down. If for passages, the width must be directed when they are sent to the manufactory, as they are cut before painting. To dean Floor-cloths. Sweep, then wipe them with a flannel; and when all dust and spots are removed, rub with a waxed flannel, and then with a dry plain one ; but use little wax, and rub only enough with the latter to give a little smooth- ness, or it may endanger falling. Washing now and then with milk after the above sweeping, and dry-rubbing them, give as beautiful a look, and they are less slippery. To dust Carpets and Floors. Sprinkle tea-leaves on them, then sweep carefully. The former should not be swept frequently with a whisk brush, as it wears them fast; only once a week, and the other times with the leaves and a hair brush.

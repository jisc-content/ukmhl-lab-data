VEAL. 57 inch thick, and two or three inches long: brown some butter, flour, and sliced onion, and throw in the slices with some good gravy, truffles, and morels: give it one boil, skim it well, and set it in a moderate heat to sim- mer till very tender. Season with pepper, salt, and Cayenne, at first; and ten minutes before serving, throwin some shred parsley, and a very small bit of taragon and knotted marjoram cut as fine as possible ; just before you serve, add the squeeze of a lemon. Forcemeat-balls, and bits of bacon rolled round. Another way.â€”Boil the head almost enough, and take the meat of the best side nearly off the bone with a sharp knife; lay this into a small dish, wash it over with the yolk of two eggs, and cover it with crumbs, a few herbs nicely shred, a little pepper and salt, and a grate of nut- meg, all mixed together first.

Add some mushrooms either fresh or pickled, a few truffles and morels, and two spoonfuls of ketchup; then beat up half the brains, and put this to the rest with a bit of butter and flour. Simmer the whole. Beat the other part of the brains with shred lemon- peel, a little nutmeg and mace, some parsley shred, ahd an egg. Then fry it in little cakes of a beautiful yel- low-brown. Dip some oysters into the yolk of an egg, and do the same ; and also some relishing forcemeat-

A leg of pork, or of lamb, takes the full allowance of twenty minutes, above a quarter of an hour to a pound. In roasting, beef of ten pounds will take above two hours and a half; twenty pounds will take three hours and three quarters. A neck of mutton will take an hour and a half, if kept at a proper distance. A chine of pork, two hours. The meat should be put at a good distance from the fire, and brought gradually nearer when the inner part becomes hot, which will prevent its being scorched while yet raw. Meat should be much basted; and when nearly done, floured to make it look frothed. Yeal and mutton should have a little paper put over the fat to preserve it. If not fat enough to allow' for basting, a little good dripping answers as well as butter. The cook should be careful not to ran the spit through the best parts; and should observe that it be well cleaned before and at the time of serving, or a black stain appears on the meat.

In roasting meat it is a very good way to put a little salt and water into the dripping-pan, and baste for a little while with this, before using its own fat or drip- ping.

310 DOMESTIC COOKERY, pearl-barley; shift it twice, then put to it three pints of water, an ounce of sweet almonds beaten fine, and a bit of lemon-peel; boil till you have a smooth liquor, then put in a little syrup of lemons and capillaire.

Strain it on a bit of lemon-peel, which remove in an hour, as it gives a bitter taste if left long. A most pleasant Drink. Put a tea-cupful of cranberries into a cup of water, and mash them.

Don’t warm it after the egg is put in. Take it the first and last thing. Toast and Wutcr. Toast slowly a thin piece of bread till extremely brown and hard, but not the least black ; then plunge it into a jug of cold water, and cover it over an hour before used. This is of particular use in weak bowels. It should be of a fine brown colour before drinking it. Barley Water.

For a large one, beat and sift eight ounces of fine su- gar, put into a mortar with four spoonfuls of rose-water, and the whites of two eggs beaten and strained, whisk it well, and when the cake is almost cold, dip a feather in the iceing, and cover the cake well; set it in the oven to harden, but donâ€™t let it stay to discolour. Put the cake into a dry place. To ice a very large Cake. Beat the whites of twenty fresh eggs; then by de- grees beat a pound of double-refined sugar sifted through a lawn-sieve; mix these well in a deep earthen pan ; add orange-flower water, and a piece of fresh lemon- peel ; of the former enough to flavour, and no more. Whisk it for three hours till the mixture is thick and white ; then with a thin broad bit of board spread it all over the top and sides, and set it in a cool oven, and an hour will harden it. A common Cake. Mix three quarters of a pound of flour with half a pound of butter, four ounces of sugar, four eggs, half an ounce of caraways, and a glass of raisin-wine.

Add either a pound of currants, or some cara- ways, and beat well. An excellent Cake. Rub two pounds of dry fine flour, with one of butter

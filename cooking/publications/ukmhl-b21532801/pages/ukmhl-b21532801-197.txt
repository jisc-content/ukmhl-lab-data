Cullis, or brown Gravy. Lay over the bottom of a stew-pan as much lean veal as will cover it an inch thick; then cover the veal with thiu slices of undressed gammon, two or three onions, two or three bay-leaves, some sweet herbs, two blades of mace, and three cloves. Cover the stew-pan, and set it over a slow fire; but when the juices come out, let the fire be a little quicker. When the meat is of a fine brown, fill the pan with good beef-broth, boil and skim it, then simmer an hour: add a little water mixed with as much flour as will make it properly thick : boil it half an hour, and strain it. This will keep a week. Bechamel, or ivhite Sauce.

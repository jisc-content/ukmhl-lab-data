To dress Mutton Rumps and Kidney. Stew six rumps in some good mutton-gravy half an hour; then take them up, and let them stand to cool. Mear the gravy from the fat; and put into it four oun- ces of boiled rice, an onion stuck with cloves, and a blade of mace; boil them till the rice is thick. Wash the rumps with yolks of eggs well beaten; and strew over them crumbs of bread, a little pepper and salt, chopped parsley and thyme, and grated lemon-peel.â€™ lny m butter of a fine brown. While the rumps are stewing, lard the kidneys, and put them to roast in a Dutch oven. When the mmps are fried, the grease must be drained before they are put on the dish, and the pan being cleared likewise from the fat, warm the rice in it. Lay the latter on the dish; the rumps put round on the rice, the narrow ends towards the middle, and the kidneys between. Garnish with hard eggs cut in half, the white being left on; or with different coloured pickles. An excellent Hotch-potch. Stew peas, lettuce, and onions, in a very little water with a beef or ham-bone.

THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. 7 For details respecting Culinary Processes, Utensils, Sauces, ifcc., referred to, see under their special heads. Alcohol—continued. rice, or from palm wine, &c. “ Spirits of wine ” is diluted Alcohol (Alcohol is never found in an absolutely undiluted state), and may be either “rectified” or “proof.” Proof Spirit contains in 100 parts about 57 of Alcohol and 47 of water, the 4 per cent, over disappearing by the con- densation that follows the admixture of spirit with water. Rectified Spirit is usually sold at from 54 to 64 over-proof, reckoning “ proof ” as 100; so that 100 pints of rectified spirit, at 64 over-proof, would contain as much Alcohol as 164 pints of proof spirit. The terms “over-proof” (o.p.) and “under-proof” (u.p.) are thus shown to be calculated upon the consideration that proof spirit is, as nearly as possible, equal parts of pure (or absolute) Alcohol and water, and fixes the standard at 100. Gin is generally retailed at about 20 under proof, which indicates that 100 pints of gin at 20 u.p. would contain as much absolute alcohol as 80 pints of proof spirit. Brandy sold at 5 o.p. would show that 100 measures of that spirit would contain as much absolute Alcohol as 105 of proof spirit. The following is a list of the average percentages of Alcohol found in some of the better-known spirits, wines, malt liquors, &c.: the exact amount varies somewhat according to age and conditions of manufacture, and the “reduction” the spirit may have suffered at the hands of the retailer. In some cases this is regulated by Act of Parliament. Spirits. In a Hundred Parts. Scotch Whisky about 5 41 Irish Whisky „ 54 Rum 534 Brandy „ 534 Gin 514 Wines.

ALDERMAN’S PUDDING.—See Puddings. ALE.—This old-fashioned English beverage is occa- sionally used in cookery (see Rarebits) as a vehicle for boiling some fish, such as eels, or for giving a body to thin soups and sauces. It has been also employed as a substitute for sherry or other wine in preparing jellies and other nourishing foods for invalids. See Beer. Ale Flip. —An old and favourite drink for cold weather, prepared by heating good Ale, with sugar and spice to taste. For every quart beat up the yolks of two eggs, and the white of one— some put the two entire eggs in—and after mixing with a little cold Ale, stir in quickly, and froth up by dexterously pouring from one jug to another from a height. Ale Posset.—A trusted remedy for colds. Boil lightly 4 pint of new milk, and stir in the beaten yolk of an egg and a piece of butter as large as a filbert; sweeten to sweetness with powdered sugar. Mix this with an equal quantity of warmed Ale, and boil until a scum rises, when it is ready. Pour over a well- toasted slice of bread from which the crusts have been removed, and serve steaming in a basin, with the toast. Mulled Ale.—Ale is mulled by boiling with a small piece of butter, ginger, cloves, and sugar to taste. Eggs well beaten and whipped in may be added, and the whole served hot. ALEATICO.—A light, sweet wine of Tuscany. See Italian Wines. ALECOST.—See Costmary. ALEXANDRA PUDDING.—See Puddings.

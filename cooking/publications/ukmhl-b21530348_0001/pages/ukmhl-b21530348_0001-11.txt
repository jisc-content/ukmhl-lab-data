PREFACE. OOKERY may now be considered one of the Fine Arts. Its practice can be traced back to primitive man, who first impaled slices of flesh on sharpened sticks, and toasted them over the smouldering embers of a wood fire. Baking coarse-ground meal cakes in holes dug in the ground, and heated by the ashes of a fire, may be regarded as the origin of the oven ; but boiling, which was born of civilisation, followed later on. These crude processes were virtually the same as those practised in the present day—and as they were in the days of the luxurious Romans, when Lucullus ordered pearls to be dissolved in soup, and a dish was estimated by its cost rather than its culinary quality. Nightingales’ brains, and peacocks’-tongues patty, “ o’erlayed with beaten gold,” were considered dishes fit to set before a king, even by such famous gourmets as Apicius, Epicurus, and others ; but just as these culinary giants were in advance of the primeval toaster, so are our modern professional chefs de cuisine in advance of the Roman cooks. Modern cookery ranks high amongst the Fine Arts, and its high priests and votaries have brought it into this elevated position by the investment of much artistic skill and scientific intelligence in its development. In France and some other Continental countries it is regarded as one of the greatest of arts, and cooks have been invested with the cordon rouge and cordon bleu—orders of a very high degree in the old French Courts ; but it is to be feared that the honour has lost something of its original value and dignity by its frequent illegitimate application. The Grand Prix d’honneur de Paris is awarded to cooks of exceptional ability, and gold, silver, and bronze medals, and diplomas of special merit to those who excel ; but in England we are apparently too indolent or indifferent to bestow special acknowledgment upon our native professional cooks, some of whom have proved themselves to be gifted with excellent talent. Indications of a new era are, however, not wanting, as shown in the establishment of Schools of Cookery, and the popularity of Cookery Exhibitions, which leads us to believe that the time is not far distant when good cookery at home will be regarded as the first of all

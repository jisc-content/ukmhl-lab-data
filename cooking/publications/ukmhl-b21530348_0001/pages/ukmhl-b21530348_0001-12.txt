IV PREFACE. accomplishments. Cookery is a superior art, for it has the power to gratify three special senses at once—namely, sight, smell, and taste; and, in a minor degree, the sense of feeling, by comfort provided at the board. Add to these the gratification of the ear by music, or pleasing and congenial conversation, and the measure of man’s enjoyment should be full. Cookery Books innumerable have been written or compiled by individuals professing some special qualification ; but experience shows that the culinary art is made up of so many different branches that it would be impossible for any one cook, however expert, to be master of them all. With this view before us, we have invoked the aid of a staff of professional British and foreign cooks, confectioners, and others, and must record our great regret that we could not extend the number indefinitely amongst the numerous skilled culinary professors of our acquaintance, whose great charm is the readiness with which they impart, for the benefit of others, the knowledge which their lives have been spent in acquiring. In this case, at any rate, we trust it will be found that too many cooks have not spoiled the broth. The arrangement we have adopted as most convenient is that of an alphabetical Encyclopaedia, the receipts being classified according to the chief material used, where such a distinction would be understood from the name ; and although the highest branches of the art have been carefully treated and simplified, the bulk of the work is ruled by general domestic utility and economy. In this way we have been enabled to supply elementary instruction for the enlightenment of beginners, as well as a valuable book of ready reference for the use of the most experienced cooks and confectioners. May they, one and all, appreciate the labour we have undertaken. Remember the words of Desaugiers : Un cuisinier, quand je dine, Me semble un etre divin. A cook, when I dine, Seems to me a being divine.

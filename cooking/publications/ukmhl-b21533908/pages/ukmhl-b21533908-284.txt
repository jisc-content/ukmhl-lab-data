SAUCES AND GRAVIES. Fried Bread Sippets: (No. 319.) Cut a slice rather more than a quarter of an inch thick, divide it with a sharp kitchen knife into pieces two inches square ; shape these into triangles, or crosses : put a tablespoonful of clean dripping into an iron fryingpan; when it is melted, put in the sippets, and fry them a light brown ; take them up with a fish-slice, and drain them on a hair sieve, that they may not be greasy. Obs. — These are a pretty garnish, and very relishing accompaniment, and will be an improve- ment to the flavour of the finest made dishes : they may also be sent up with peas and other soups; but when intended for soups, they should be cut in bits from half to three quarters of an inch square. Fried Bread Crumbs. (No. 320.) Rub a pint of crumbs of bread (that has been baked three days) through a wire sieve, or fine cullender; or you may rub them in a cloth till they are as^smail and fine as if they had been grated; put them into a stewpan with half an ounce of butter, place it over a moderate fire, and stir them about with a wooden spoon till they are the colour of a guinea; pour them into a sieve, and let them stand ten minutes to drain. Obs. —These crumbs are sent up with roasted sweetbreads, or larks, pheasants, partridges, w ood- cocks, and grouse, or moor game, especially if they have been kept long enough.

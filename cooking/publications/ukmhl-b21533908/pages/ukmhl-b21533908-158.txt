FISH, just begins to rise from the surface, (if tbe fat is not extremely hot, it is impossible to fry fish of a good colour, or to make them firm and crisp. The best way to ascertain the heat of the fat, is to try it with a bit of bread as big as a nut, if it is quite hot enough, the bread will be brown imme- diately,) put in the fish, it will be crisp and brown on the side next the fire, in about four or five minutes ; to turn it, stick a two pronged fork near the head, and support the tail with a fish- « slice, and fry the other side ; one sole is enough to put in at a time, except the pan is very large, and you have plenty of fat. When your fish are fried, lay them on whited brown paper, on a hair sieve, placed slanting, and near enough the fire to keep them warm, till the fat is thoroughly drained from them ; this will take five or ten minutes. When soles are fried, they will keep very good in a dry place for four days, and eat as well as when fresh dressed, if you warm them in a Dutch oven, or in good gravy, Ohs.—There are several general rules in this re- ceipt which apply to all fried fish: we have been very particular and minute in our directions ; for, although a fried sole is a very frequent and favourite dish, it is very seldom brought to table in perfection Batter will occasionally supply the place of egg; and biscuit, powder of bread crumbs : the latter is sold at Russell’s excellent biscuit shop, nearly opposite Villiers Street in the Strand *. * The very indifferent manner in which the operation of frying fish is usually performed, we suppose produced the following Jew d’ esprit, which appeared a few months since

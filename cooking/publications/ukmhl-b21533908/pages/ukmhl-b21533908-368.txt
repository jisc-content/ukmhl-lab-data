MADE DISHES. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. Under this general head we range our receipts for hashes, stews, fricasees, and ra- | gouts * : of these there are a great multitude,, - affording the ingenious cook an inexhaustible > store of very rich and pleasing variety : we have , very few general observations to make, after what ( we have already said in the chapter of gravies, , sauces, soups, &c., which apply to the pre^ j sent chapter, as they form the principal part of { the accompaniment of most of these dishes. We ( have given receipts for the most easy and simple j way to make hashes, &c.; for only those who are well skilled in culinary arts know how good things may be dressed up in this way, so as to be a * Gravy for ragouts, &c., should be thickened till it is 11 of the consistence of good rich cream. When you have a large t dinner to dress, always keep ready mixed some fine sifted ii flour and water well rubbed together till quite smooth and \ about as thick a# batter. i

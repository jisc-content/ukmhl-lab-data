SAUCES AND GRAVIES. this Haifa teaspoonful of basket salt, a little pep- per, and as much oil as there is of the other liquor ; shred some parsley very fine, wash and bone a couple of anchovies ; mix these together, and put them into the liquor ; then cut very small two tea- spoonsful of capers, put them in, stir all well to- gether, and send it to table. Obs. — We want a cold sauce of this kind, and this is an exceeding good one for many things— with cold fowl, turkey, or lamb—these are dry and insipid with salt alone, and our English cookery does not afford any method of eating them other- wise, without heating them up, by which they lose a great deal of their sweetness. This sauce is not too sharp, for the oil softens the vinegar; and it is very finely relished with a mixed fla- vour by the other ingredients. Italian Ramolade, Hot. (No. 3(K).) Chop parsley very fine, an equal quantity of capers, shred a couple of anchovies, peel and shave very thin two shallots, and a clove of gar- lick ; all these (being cut and prepared separately) must be mixed together : set on a stewpan with a quarter pint of gravy, add to it two tablespoonsful of oil, a spoonful of mustard, and the juice of a large lemon ; when all this is hot together, put in the ingredients, with some pepper, and a very lit- tle salt, and some leaves of sweet herbs, picked from the stalks, and minced fine; stir all well to- gether, and five minutes over a good fire will do it.

PICKLES. (No. 462.) Commencing this list with walnuts, I must take this opportunity of impressing the necessity of being strictly particular in watching the time, for of all the variety of articles required in this depart- ment, to furnish the well regulated store-room, nothing is so precarious,â€”for frequently after the first wTeek that walnuts come in season they be- come hard and shelled, particularly if the season is a very hot one, therefore let the prudent house- keeper consider it indispensably necessary they should be purchased as soon as they first appear at market; should they cost a trifle more, that is nothing compared to the disappointment of find- ing six months hence, when you go to your pickle jar expecting a fine relish for your chops, &c., to find nuts incased in a shell, that defies both teeth and steel: I therefore recommend looking for them from the twelfth of July ; that being, 1 may say, the earliest possible time. Nasturtiums are to be had by the middle of July. Onions, the various kinds for pickling, are to be had by the middle of July, and for a month after. Gherkins are to be had by the middle of July, and for a month after.

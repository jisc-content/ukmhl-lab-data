FISH of salt are put into the water it is to be boiled in ; which strong brine makes the fish crimp and savoury; the thick parts of the fish are cut, or scored, to admit the salt water. The salt must be put into cold water ; but before the fish is put in, the water must boil strongly. A large turbot will be well boiled in half an hour. (From Mr. Twiss j the traveller.) Turbot to Fry. (No. 142.) 1 Clean a small turbot well, and dry it in a cloth, beat an egg on a plate ten minutes, wash the fish 1 all over with the egg, then cover it with fine bread i crumbs, that have been rubbed through a hair I sieve : have some clean lard, or dripping in an iron fryingpan, over a hot fire; when it has done talking, and is quite still, put the fish in; in about four minutes turn it, and fry it on the other side ; w hen done, lay it on a hair sieve, to drain the fat from it. Lobster or shrimp sauce. ( t A Brill (No. 143.) I s Is dressed the same way as a turbot. Soles to Boil. (No. 144.) j ! ' Wash and clean your soles well, put them into a fish-kettle, with a handful of salt, and as much 1^ cold spring water as will cover them; put them on a | 4 quick fire, and when they boil, set them on the side of the fire to boil gently ten minutes ; that | ^ will be long enough, unless they be very large. |

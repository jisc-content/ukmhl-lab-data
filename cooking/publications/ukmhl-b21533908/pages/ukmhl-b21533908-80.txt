BOTLING. Make a good and clear fire ; set on a clean pot, â– with plenty of pure and clear water, the more the better; and the slower it boils the whiter and plumper the fowl will be. You may rub a lemon over the breast of your fowl, and put it in. When there rises any scum, the common method of some who are more nice than wise, is to wrap them up in a cloth, to prevent the scum attaching to them ; which if it does, by your neglecting to skim your pot, there is no getting it off afterwards, and the poulterer is blamed for the fault of the cook. However, if there be water enough, and it is attentively scummed, the fowl will both look and eat much better this way than when it lias been tied up in the cleanest cloth ; and both the colour and flavour of your poultry will be preser- ved in the most charming and delicate perfection. Rabbits. (No. 17.) Truss your rabbits short, put them into plenty of water, and boil them half an hour; if large ones, three quarters; smother them with onioir sauce, and send up liver sauce in a boat. Tripe. (No. 18.) Cut the tripe into pieces about two inches broad and four long; put it into a stewpan of clean boiling water^ and let it boil half an hour; then have another clean stewpan with an equal quantity of milk and water ; when this boils, take the tripe out of the water, and put it into the milk and water.

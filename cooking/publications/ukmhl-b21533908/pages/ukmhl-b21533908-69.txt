BOILING. In whatever way the flesh of animals is cooked, a considerable diminution takes place in its weight; but less by boiling than any of the other ways of dressing; and, independent of the smaller loss of weight by boiling, it is the most eco- nomical cookery, as it affords the opportunity of converting a considerable quantity of wafer into a nourishing and wholesome soup, which .receives the nutritive matter and juices of the meat, that, in roasting, broiling, or baking, are evaporated and lost. We have given the results of some experiments, made on purpose to show the comparative loss of weight by the various culinary processes. Beef by boiling lost 26| per cent. Ditto by baking 30 per ditto. Ditto by roasting 32 per ditto. Mutton by boiling lost* •••22 per ditto. Ditto by roasting 32 per ditto. Thus the diminution by cookery amounts to from one-fifth to one-third of the weight. « 3

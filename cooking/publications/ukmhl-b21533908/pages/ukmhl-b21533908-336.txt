SAUCES, GRAVIES, &C. ESSENCE OF ANCHOVY. (No. 433.) The goodness of this preparation depends almost entirely on having fine mellow fish, that have been in pickle long enough (i. e. about twelve months) to dissolve easily, yet are not at all rusty. It has been said that some shops have a trick of putting anchovy liquor on pickled sprats : you will easily discover this by washing one of them, and tasting the flesh of it, which in the finest anchovies is mellow, red, and high flavoured, and the bone moist and oily. Put into a marble mortar a pound of anchovies, beat them to a pulp, and put them into a sauce- pan with a quart and half a pint of water, let them simmer very gently by the side of a slow fire for an hour and a half, frequently stirring them together. (Thisis the proper way to perfectly dissolve the fish, and completely incorporate it with the water, so that it may continue suspended, and not separate. To prevent the separation of essence of anchovy, various other expedients have been tried, such as the addition of mucilage, flour, oatmeal, or gum ; but where any of these things are added, it does not keep half so well as it does without them.) Skim it well, and add to it an ounce of salt, and a drachm of Cayenne pepper; let it simmer together ten minutes longer, and strain it If this is properly made, a tablespoonful will be about equal to an anchovy.

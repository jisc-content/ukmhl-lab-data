MADE DISHES, &C. L Peristaltic Persuaders. (No. 568.) To humour that desire for the marvellous which is so universal in medical matters, the contrivers of aperient pills have too often selected the most drastic purgatives, which operating con- siderably in a dose of a few grains, excite much admiration in the patient, and great faith in their powers, in proportion as a small dose produces great effects, not considering how extremely irri- tating such materials must be, and consequently how injurious to a stomach already in a state of debility, and perhaps deranged by yesterday’s excess *. The inventor of the “ Peristaltic Persuaders ” gave them that name from the peculiar mildness of their operation : one or two of these pills merely give a gentle hint to that grand organ, the stomach, and the other principal viscera, helping them to do their work a little faster, and remove what is offensive into the bowels, accelerating the process of digestion, and almost imperceptibly augmenting the alvine exoneration : if a more speedy and copious evacuation is desired, take three, or four, or five, according to circumstances. %'* These pills are prepared from a prescription of Dr. Kitcji- iner’s, and sold bp G.

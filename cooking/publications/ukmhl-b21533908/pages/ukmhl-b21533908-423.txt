MADE DISHES, &C. One ounce of oatmeal is sufficient to make two quarts of water gruel. Put the oatmeal into three quarts of soft cold water, and set it over the tire. It must be con- stantly stirred till it boils; then let it boil till a third part of the water is boiled aw ay; then pour it through a linen cloth into a bowl a little larger than sufficient to contain it. In this bowl leave it to cool; when it will be found separated into two parts, one of them a mealy cloud or sediment, and the other a very thin and clear liquor. The lat- ter is to be carefully decanted, or poured off for use. To render this more agreeable by the addition of sugar, acids, or aromatics, or to impregnate it with medicinal substances, I leave to the judg- ment of the nurse or physician. See Cullen’s Mat. Med. vol. i. p. 288. edit. 2 vols. 4to. Edinburgh, 1789, Water Cfruel immediately. (No. 572.) Mix well together, by degrees, two tablespoons- ful of oatmeal, and a teaspoonful of salt, with a quart of cold water: set it on the fire, and let it boil gently for fifteen or twenty minutes, occa- sionally stirring it to prevent the oatmeal burning at the bottom of the stewpan: skim it and strain it. Obs. — An ounce of fresh butter, a tablespoon- ful of brandy, and a teaspoonful of powdered sugar may be added. In the “ Way to save Wealth,” London, 1697, in the 8th page are directions how to live for two- pence a day : the author’s observation on water gruel is, that it makes “ a noble and exhilarating meal.”

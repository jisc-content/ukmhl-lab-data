BROTHS, GRAVIES, AND SOUPS. Beef Broth. (No. 185.) * Wash a shin of beef very clean, crack the bone in two or three places, add thereto any trimmings you have of meat, game, or poultry, and put them into two gallons of cold water, in an open pot, on a quick fire ; watch it, and the moment it begins to simmer, skim it carefully, or you will lose the beauty of your broth, which must be perfectly clear and limpid; on this depends the goodness of the soups, sauces, and gravies, of â– which it is the basis: then add a quart of cold water, to make more scum rise, and skim it again, and when the scum has quite done rising, put in one moderate-sized carrot, a head of celery, two turnips, two onions, in one of which stick three cloves, and a teaspoonful of salt: cover it close, and set it by the side of the fire, and let it boil very gently for four or five.hours, according to the weight of your meat : when it is reduced to about six quarts, strain it through a silk or tammis sieve : skimt it carefully, and set it in the coldest place you have. The quicker it cools the better. * In culinary technicals, is first stock. t If the grease is left on the top, it keeps the broth from cooling, and it often turns sour.

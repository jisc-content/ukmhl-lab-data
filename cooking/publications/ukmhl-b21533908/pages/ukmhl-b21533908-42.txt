ADVICE TO COOKS. a fault, that there is the more merit attached in being O ready at the appointed hour*. This is certainly some- times a rather difficult task to perform; and in the best regulated families you can only be sure of your time by thus properly arranging your business f. Remember to have your kitchen chimney swept once a month ; many good dinners have been spoiled by the soot falling. punishment that a blundering ill-bred Booby can receive, who comes half an hour a fter the time he zcas bidden, to find the soup removed, and the fish cold. * Those who desire regularity in the service of their table, should have a DIAL, of not less than twelve inches diameter, placed over the kitchen fire-place, carefully regulated, to keep time exactly with the clock in the hall or dining parlour; with a frame on one side, containing a taste table, or the pecu- liarities of the masters palate, and the particular rules and orders of his kitchen; and on the other side, of the rewards given to those who attend to them, and for long service. -f With all our love of punctuality, we must not forget that the first consideration must still be, that the dinner “ be well done when ’tis done.” If any accident occurs, which is likely to prevent your sending the soup, &c. to table at the mo- ment it is expected, send up a message to your employers, stating the circumstance, and bespeak their patience for as many minutes as you think you shall want to be ready. This is certainly better than either keeping the company waiting without any apology, or dishing your dinner before it is done enough, and so disgusting the stomachs of the guests at the first appearance of it.

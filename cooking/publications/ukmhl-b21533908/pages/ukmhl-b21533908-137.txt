VEGETABLES. E 2 Potatoes. (No. 102.) Although this most useful vegetable is dressed every day, in almost, every family, it is very sel- dom well prepared ; and for one plate of potatoes that comes to table as it should, ten are spoiled. Be careful in your choice of potatoes ; no vege- table varies so much in quality. The reddish kind are better than the white, but the yellowish looking ones are generally the best. Choose them of a moderate size, free from all blemishes, and fresh, and buy them in the mould; they should not be wetted till they are cleaned to boil. Peel and wash them, fill the saucepan half full of potatoes of equal size*, and put to them as much cold water as will cover them about an inch : most boiled things are spoiled by having loo little water, but potatoes are commonly spoiled by too much : they must merely be covered, and a little allowed for waste in boiling, so that they may be covered at last. Set them on a moderate fire till they boil, then take them off, and set them by the side of the fire ' to boil gently (the slower the better) till they are soft enough to admit a fork, (there is no depend- ence on the usual test of their cracking or break- ing, which, if they are boiled fast, some potatoes will do when they are not half done, and the in- side is quite hard,) then pour the water from them, uncover the saucepan, and set it by the side * the small ones will be done to pieces before the large Â«ne:s are boiled enough.

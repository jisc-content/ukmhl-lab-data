Set a pan of cold water upon the table, and a stewpan with plenty of water in it on the fire; sprinkle a handful of salt into it, and while it is heating prepare your asparagus. Scrape all the stalks till they are perfectly clean, throw them into the pan of cold water as you scrape them ; when they are all done, tie them up in little bun- dles, with bass if you can get it, or tape; string cuts them to pieces : cut off the stalks at the bot- tom that they may be all of a length, leaving just enough to serve as a handle for the green part; put them on when the water boils ; when they are tender at the stalk, which will be in about ten minutes, they are done enough. Great care must be taken to watch the exact time of their becom- ing tender, and take them up just at that instant, and they will have their true flavour and colour, but a minute or two more boiling destroys both. While the asparagus are boiling, toast a round of a quartern loaf about half an inch thick, brown it delicately on both sides, dip it lightly in the liquor of the asparagus, and lay it in the middle of a dish ; melt some butter, then lay in the aspa- ragus upon the toast all round the dish, with the ends of the stalks outwards. Pour no butter over them, but send it up in a boat. To the common melted butter, you may add a little pepper and salt, a (easpoonful of vinegar, and the yolk of a couple of eggs, beat up, and carefully mixed to keep them from curdling.

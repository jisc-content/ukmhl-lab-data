BOILING. which was dressed to eat with the calf’s head when hot, will do,) a bundle of sweet herbs, a large onion, and a blade of bruised mace : put these into a saucepan with the quart of liquor you have saved, and let it stew for an hour and a half; then put half an ounce of butter into another stewpan : when it is melted, add a table spoonful of flour to it, stir it well together, and by degrees add to it tlie gravy you have made with the bones and trimmings, straining it through a hair sieve: season it with a glass of white wine, and a table-spoonful of ketchup ; give it a boil up, 'skim it, and then put in the calf’s head and bacon to warm, (it must not boil after,) and it is ready. N.B. You may garnish the edges of the dish with slices of bacon toasted in a Dutch oven, and slices of lemon. Pickled Pork (No. II.) Requires more time than any meat. When you cook a leg, which, when well dressed, is a favourite dish with almost every body, take care it does not boil fast; if it does, the knuckle will break to pieces before the thick part of the meat is warm through : a leg of seven pounds will take nearly three hours. If not done enough, nothing is more disagree- able: if boiled too long, it loses not only its flavour, but its substance becomes soft like a jelly. It can never appear at table without a good pease pudding, and, if you please, turnips and greens, &c. and remember not to forget your mustard pot.

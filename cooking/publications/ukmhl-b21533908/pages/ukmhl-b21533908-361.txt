SAUCES, GRAVIES, &C. pared vegetable acids, as well as that particularly denominated citric acid, are occasionally em- ployed ; but, perhaps, after all, the juices of limes, lemons, and Seville oranges, expressed from the fresh fruits, when attainable, make the sort of sherbet which seems most congenial with the nature of good British punch.

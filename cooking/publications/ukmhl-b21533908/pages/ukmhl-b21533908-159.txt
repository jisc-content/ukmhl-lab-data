FISH. Soles to Stew. (No. 146.) These are done the same as eels, Wiggy’s way, in good gravy. See No. 164. Fillets of Soles Fried. (No. 147.) Take the fillets of a pair of good soles, trim them neatly, and wipe them on a dry cloth ; beat the yolk and white of an egg together on a plate for five minutes, dip the fillets into the egg, and then into fine stale bread crumbs, that have been rubbed through a hair sieve. Have some clean lard hot in an iron fryingpan; put in the fillets and frjr them of a fine brown colour ; lay them on a hair sieve as you do them, and keep them hot before the fire till the following sauce is ready. Make half a pint of good melted butter, squeeze in the juice of a lemon, lay the fillets of soles round the dish, and pour the sauce into the middle. Fillets of Soles, JVhite. (No. 148.) Take off the fillets, trim them, and cut them in two ; butter a clean earthen dish or pan, lay the fillets in it, and butter a paper cut to the size of the dish, and lay it close to the fillers, set it in a cool oven, or over a very slow fire, for about fif- teen or twenty minutes; take them up, and dry in that ably conducted daily register, “ The Morning Chro- nicle.” u The King^s Bench Reports have cook’d up an odd dish, An action for damages, Fry versus Fish.

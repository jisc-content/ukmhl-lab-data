BOILING. Tongue. (No. 15.) A Tongue is so hard, whether prepared by drying or pickling, that it requires much more time, &c. than a ham : nothing, of its weight, lakes so long to dress it properly. A tongue that has been salted and dried, should be put to soak 24 hours before it is wanted, in a large quantity of water ; a green tongue fresh from the pickle requires soaking only a few' hours ; they take nearly the same timedressing. Let your tongue be put into plenty of cold water, and give it from three and a half to four hours very slow simmering, according to its size : about half an hour before it is done, take it up, peel it, and put it into the pot again to finish it; scum the pot frequently while it is doing, and it will come out tender and clean. It is a general rule with some cooks to try if the tongue will peel, and then allow it half an hour after that. h â€¢ *. >, . Fowls. (No. 16.) Under this title we include all the kinds of tame fowls, from the turkey to the chicken : they are all boiled exactly in the same manner, and accord- ing to the same rules, only allowing time, accord- ing to the size. For stuffings, &c. see No. 374 and 377. Turkies, and large fowls, should always have the strings or sinews of the thighs drawn out. Fowls for boiling should be chosen as white as possible: those which have even black-legs had better be roasted.

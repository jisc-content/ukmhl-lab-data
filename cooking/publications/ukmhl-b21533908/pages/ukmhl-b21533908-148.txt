VEGETABLES. stand before you, and as the beans are cleaned and stringed, throw them in : when all are done, put them on the fire, in boiling water, with some salt in itwhen they have boiled fifteen or twenty minutes, take one out and taste it; as soon as they are tender*, throw them into a cullender, drain them, and lay them on a plate, in a little heap, highest in the middle. To send up the beans whole is much the best method, when they are thus young, and their delicate flavour and colour are much better preserved. When a little more grown, they must be cut across in two, after stringing; and for common tables, they are to be split first, and cut across after- wards; but those who are nice, never have them at such a growth as to require splitting. When they are very large, they look very pretty cut into lozenges ; in this case they are not split. Green Peas. (No. 134.) Young green peas well dressed, are one of the most delicious delicacies of the vegetable kingdom. They must be young, or no art can boil them ten- der ; it is equally indispensable that they be fresh gathered, and cooked as soon as they are shelled, for, by being exposed to the air, they soon lose both tlieir colour and sweetness, and if you wish to feast upon peas in perfection, you must have them gathered the same day they are dressed, and * If you wish to have them very green, when they are done throw them instantly into cold water; when you wish to send them to table, warm them again in a tureen of boiling water.

('No. 5 19-) See Ohs. to boil calf’s head, Mo. 10. * * Calf's Head Hashed, or Ragout. (No. 520.) Wash a calf’s head that has been skinneJ, and boil the half you intend to hash for fifteen minutes ; the other half an hour, or, if it is large, give it fifteen or twenty minutes longer: when quite tender, take out all the brains you can : beat up an egg on a plate, and put this all over it with a paste brush, and strew over it thyme and pars- ley in fine powder, then bread crumbs, and put it in the Dutch oven to brown. Cut the other half head into slices, and put it into a stewpan with a quart of gravy, No. 329, and let it simmer for three qu rters of an hour : take up the meat with a slice, and strain the gravy into a clean stewpan with forcemeat-balls, No. 376, 380, egg-balls, and a wineglass of white wine ; put in the meat, and let it warm up together, and skim off the fat. Beat up the brains in a basin with a spoonful of flour, two eggs, lemon peel, thyme, parsley, and a few leaves of sage; chop all fine, and mix weil together with pepper, salt, and a scrape of nut- meg : fry them in little cakes, of a very light brown ; dish up your hash, with the half head you browned in tlie middle, and garnish with crisp curled rashers of bacon, and the brain cakes. *** Truffle s and morels are frequently added lo this. o 3

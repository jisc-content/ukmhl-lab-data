PREFACE, poultry*, starved tough mutton, stringy beef, or stale fish, (at a little less than the price of prime and proper food:) 1 I * COURT OF REQUESTS, Tuesday, Not. 5,1816. HOWARD V. PHILLIPS. This was a case of some importance to the public. The defendant, a walking poulterer, was, summoned by the plain- tiff, a widow lady residing near the Asylum, to shew cause why he did not pay back to her four shillings, which he had ob- tained from her under false representations. The plaintiff stated, that the defendant called at her house on Wednesday , last, and inquired if she wanted a fine fowl, as he had some he could recommend. She desired he would select her one she might depend upon as being young and good. He accord- ingly picked out one which he said he could recommend as being a young one, and she took it upon his recommendation, and paid him four shillings. At dinner, however, to her great dismay, on attempting to carve this delicate young chicken, she discovered that so great an attachment had the bones and joints formed to each other from long acquaintance, that they successfully resisted all her attempts to separate them, and she was obliged to give over the attempt- A favourite pug- dog was then allowed to commence his operations upon the breast, but so thick was the skin, and so solid the flesh, that he, after much labour, found himself foiled, as his mistress had been before him. On the following day the plaintiff applied to the defendant, sending back the fragments of the young chicken, and desiring to have her money back again; but the defendant positively refused either to receive back his property, or to refund the money he had received; upon which refusal, the plaintiff summoned him. i Is aii k V an of k k 'li to Ctl pt U lk k OGGI k< *Tl

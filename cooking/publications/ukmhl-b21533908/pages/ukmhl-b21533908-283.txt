Let it be well picked and washed, put it into a cloth, and swing it backwards and forwards till it is perfectly dry; put it into a pan of hot fat, fry it quick, and have a slice ready to take it out the moment it is crisp, (if you let it stay too long, it will look black,) put it on a sieve or coarse cloth before the fire to drain. <s Crisp Parsley. (No. 318.) Tick and wash a handful of young parsley, and shake it in a dry cloth to drain the water from it; spread it on a sheet of clean paper, and lay it in the Dutch oven before the fire, and lay some very little bits of butter on it; turn it frequently until it is quite crisp.

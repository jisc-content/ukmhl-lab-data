BROILING. cloth, season it with a little white pepper and salt, and lay it on a gridiron over a very clear slow fire, with the inside of the fowl towards the fire ; turn it in about ten minutes, and it will take about ten minutes more to broil it till it is a fine brown. Lay it on a hot dish, with mushroom sauce thrown over it, or melted butter flavoured with mushroom catsup or cavice: garnish with the liver and the gizzard, slit and notched, and sea- soned with pepper and salt, and broiled nicely brown, and some slices of lemon. For sauce, see No. 355. Pigeons. (No. 98.) Clean them welt, split them down the backs, and pepper and salt them; broil them over a clear slow fire ; turn them often, and put a little butter on them : when they are done, pour over them, either stewed or pickled mushrooms, and melted butter. Garnish with fried sippets; or, when the pigeons are trussed as for boiling, flat them with a cleaver, taking care not to break the skin, or the backs, or breasts ; season them with pepper and salt, dip them in melted butter, and dredge them well with grated bread, then lay them on the gridiron, and turn them frequently : if your fire is not very clear, lay them on a sheet of paper well buttered, to keep them from getting smoked. Same sauce as in the preceding receipt.

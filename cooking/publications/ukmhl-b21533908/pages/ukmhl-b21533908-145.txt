VEGETABLES. Sea Kail (No. 124.) Is tied up in bundles, and dressed exactly in the same way as asparagus. Cauliflower. (No. 125.) Choose those that are close and white, trim off the outside leaves, cut the stalk off flat at the bot- tom, let them lie in salt and water an hour before you boil them, put them into boiling water with a handful of salt in it, and let it boil slowly till done, which a small one will be in fifteen, a very large one in twenty minutes, and take them up care- fully with a slice. Brocoli. (No. 126.) The great art in dressing brocoli is, that it be not overboiled, and yet boiled enough. Set a pan of clean cold water on the table, and a saucepan on the fire with plenty of water, and a handful of salt in it: the brocoli is prepared by stripping off all the side shoots, leaving the top : peel off the skin of the stalk with a knife, cut it oft' at the bottom, and put them into the pan of cold water : when the water in the stewpan boils, and all the brocoli is ready, put it in, let it boil briskly till the stalks feel tender, and take it up with a slice, that you may not break it; let it drain, and serve up: if some of the heads of brocoli are much bigger than the others, put them on to boil first, so that they may get all done together. Obs.â€”It makes a nice supper dish served upon a toast, like asparagus.

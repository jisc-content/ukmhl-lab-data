BROTHS, GRAVIES, AND SOUPS. happen sometimes to the most careful cook, I ad- vise her, by all means, immediately to acquaint her employers, who will thank her for so candidly mentioning the accident; and only censure her if she conceals it. Make it a rule without an excep- tion, never to use any sieves or tammy cloths, spoons or ladles, till they are well cleaned, and thoroughly dried, nor any stewpans &c., without first washing them out with boiling water, and rubbing them well with a dry cloth and a little bran, to clean them from every kind of grease and sand, &c. that may have been left in them, or any bad smell they may have got since they were last used: never neglect this. Though we do not j suppose our cook such a naughty slut, as to think of putting by her broth pots, &c., till she has thoroughly cleaned * them ; wash them immedi- * Stewpans and soup-pots with round bottoms, such as? c saucepans are made with, will wear twice as long, and are { 1 cleaned with half the trouble, as those whose sides are sol- ! dered to the bottom; for the sand and grease, &c. will get ]â€¢ i into the joined part, and it is a difficulty, almost amounting to an impossibility, to dislodge the dirt completely. Take care also, that the lids fit as close as possible, that the broth, soup, &c., that you are making, may not waste by to evaporation. They are good for nothing, unless they fit right enough to keep the steam in, and the smoke out.

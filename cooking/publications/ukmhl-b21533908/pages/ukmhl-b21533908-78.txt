33 OILING. minutes; it must not be there too long, or it -will dry it too much and spoil it. Two pounds will require an hour, three pounds an hour and a half; the hock or gammon being very thick, will take full a quarter of an hour to a pound more. Ham, (No. 14.) Though of the bacon kind, has been so altered and hardened in the particular way of curing, â€¢it requires a very different manner of dressing. Jt is generally not half soaked, as salt as brine, and hard as flint: if it is very dry, it must be soaked from 12 to 24 hours: scrape it clean, trim it neatly, and put it into lukewarm water, which will help to mellow it very much. Give it plenty of water; a copper is the best thing to boil it in ; put it in while the water is cold, and manage the fire so that it may be three or four hours before it boils : to prevent this, put in a little cold water occasionally, but do not put in so much at a time as to prevent its simmering ; keep scumming it carefully all the time : then stir up your fire, and make the water boil slowly, and a middling sized ham will be finished in an hour and a half; a large one in two hours, or a very little more ; and it will be very clean, and eat very tender. Pull off the skin carefully, so as to preserve it as whole as possible, as it will form an excellent covering to keep the ham moist : when you have removed the skin, rub some bread raspings through a hair sieve, or srratc a crust of bread over it.

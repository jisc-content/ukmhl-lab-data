TABLE OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES. To reduce our culinary operations to as exact a certainty as the nature of the processes would admit of, we have, wherever it was needful, given the quantities of each article.—The weights, avoirdupoise. —The measure. The liquid graduated measure of the apothecaries, as it appeared more accurate and con- venient than any other, the pint being divided into sixteen ounces, the ounce into eight drachms: a mid- dling size teaspoon will contain about a drachm; four such teaspoons are equal to a middling size, large, or tablespoon, or half an ounce; four tablespoons, to a common-sized wineglass. The specific gravities of the various substances being so extremely different, we cannot offer any auxiliary standards* for the weights, which we earnestly recommend the cook to employ, if she wishes to gain credit for accuracy and uniformity in her business: these she will find it necessary to have as small as the quarter of a drachm avoirdupoise, which is equal to nearly seven grains troy weight, * A large tablespoonful of flour weighs about half an ounce.

I am well aware of the extreme difficulty of the task I have undertaken, in attempting to teach those who are entirely unacquainted with the subject, and to convey my ideas correctly by mere receipts to those who have had no opportunity of seeing the work performed ; and in my anxiety to be readily understood, I have, perhaps, been under the necessity of occasionally repeating the same directions in different parts of the book : however, I chose rather to be censured for repetition, than for omission or obscurity. putation of his table. All great cooks submit to the operation without a murmur; to prevent which, it should be made the first condition in hiring them. Those who refuse, prove they were not born to become masters of their art; and their indifference to fame will rank them, as they deserve, among those stupid slaves, who pass their lives in as much obscurity as their own stewpans. To the preceding observations from the “ Almanack des Gourmands” we may add, that the Mouthician will have a still better chance of success, if he can prevail on his master to observe the same regime which he orders for his cook. ! aflo in* To!

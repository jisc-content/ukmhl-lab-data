WADE DISHES. Hat 'rico Mutton or Lamb. (No. 489-) Cut the best end ofa neck of mutton into chops, one rib to eacli ; trim off part of the fat, and the lower end of the chine bone ; lay them in an iron fryi ngpan over a verij smartJire, and fry them tor a couple of minutes : if your fire is not sharp, the chops will be done before they are coloured : the intention of frying them is merely to.give them a browning. Take them out of the frying pan and lay them in a clean stewpan, (lined with thin slices ot bacon,) just big enough to hold them without lay- ing them one on another; put a tablespoonful of oat- meal and one of flour to the gravy the chops were fried in, with a pint and a half of boiling water : when it has boiled up for two minutes, pour it into the stewpan to the chops, w ith a large onion, half a carrot, and a couple of turnips, all cut into pieces, with half a teaspoonful of salt, and a quarter ofa teaspoonful of ground black pepper ; cover them close down, and let them simmer very gently on a slow fire till the chops are thoroughly tendei* i this may take an hour and a half, or two hours : be very careful they are not stewed too much, so take one ot the chops up with your fish slice and try it: when done, take them out and lay them round a dish big enough to hold them without laying them over each other, and leave a space in the middle to receive the carrots, turnips, &c. ldave ready boiled two dozen round young onions, *“•' • , 4 .. i». . > ,.. % •. . - . *' * Tf they are stewed too much they -are spoiled, and- no more fit to eat than meat that lias been boiled down for gravy.

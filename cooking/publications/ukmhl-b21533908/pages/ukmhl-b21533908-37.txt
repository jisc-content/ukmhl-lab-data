PREFACE. b 5 required : it will be to little purpose to provide good provisions, without proper utensils * to prepare them in ; therefore, after a few words of Advice to Cooks f, I begin my book with a catalogue of such articles of kitchen furniture as are indispensably necessary, in a moderate-sized family of five or six people, who occa- sionally entertain half a dozen friends. * u A surgeon may as well attempt to open a vein with an oyster knife, as a cook pretend to dress a dinner without pro- per tools to do it.”—Preface to Verall’s Cookery, 8vo.

London, 177G.

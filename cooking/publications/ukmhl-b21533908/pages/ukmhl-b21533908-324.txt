SAUCES, GRAVIES, &C. Eshallot Vinegar (No. 401.) Is made in the same manner, and the cook should never be without it; it costs scarcely any thing, and will save her an immense deal of trou- ble in flavouring all soups and sauces that she wishes to give a taste of onion. Eshallot /Vine. (No. 402.) Infuse an ounce and a half of eshallots, minced fine, in a pint of port wine for ten days. Obs. â€” This is rather the most expensive, but * infinitely the most elegant preparation of eshallot9 and gives the onion flavour to soups and sauces more agreeably than any other way: it also does not at all leave an unpleasant taste in the mouth and to the breath, which all the other prepara- tions of garlick, onion, &c. do. Camp Vinegar. (No. 403.) Cayenne pepper, a quarter of an ounce. Cochineal, half a drachm. Soy, two tablespoonsful. Walnut catsup, ditto. Two anchovies chopped. A small clove of garlick minced fine. Steep all for a month in a pint of best vinegar, frequently shaking the bottle : strain through ai tammis, and keep it in small bottles corked asweUj as possible. ! (ft at *i k Hr, 5<jl!

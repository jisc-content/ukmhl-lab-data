SAUCES AND GRAVIES. Melted Butter Appears to be so simple and easy to prepare, it is certainly very surprising it is not uniformly well done, and is a matter of general astonishment, that what is done so often in every kitchen, should so seldom be done right. it is spoiled nine times out often, more from idleness than from ignorance, and rather because the cook wont do it, than because she canâ€™t do it. As it is the foundation of almost all our sauces *, 1 have tried every way of making it, and hope, at last, I have written two receipts, which if the reader carefully observes, she will constantly succeed in giving satisfaction. In the quantities of the various sauces I have ordered, I have had in view the providing for a moderate family of half a dozen people. I recommend the cook never to pour the sauce over the meat, or even put it into the dish ; for, however well made, some of the company may have an antipathy to it: moreover, if it is sent up separate in a boat, it will keep hot longer, and what is left of it may be put by for another time, or used for another pur- pose. Lastly, it is to be observed, that in ordering the proportions of meat, butter, wine, spice, &c. in the following receipts, the proper quantity is set down, and that a less quantity will not do ; and in some instances, those who are fond of the extreme of piquance perhaps will require an addition, if we have erred, it has been on the right side, from an anxious wish to combine elegance with * As gravy is those of the French kitchen.

Mock Essence of Anchovies. (No. 432.) Boil a quart of stale ale for a quarter of an hour, let it stand till it is cold ; take five Dutch pickled herrings with their liquor, (take off the heads and roes,) mince them fine, put them into the beer, with a stick of horseradish scraped fine ; let it boil twenty minutes ; strain it; hold a clean fryingpan, over the fire that it may be quite dry, put a quarter of a pound of flour in it ; keep stirring it with a wooden spoon, till it is the colour of essence of anchovies ; put the liquor to it, and stir it together till it boils; let it boil a quarter of an hour ; when cold, bottle it; if not of sufficient colour, put a little bole armeniac to it.

FRYING. v/cll as either, except for cutlets and collops* Butter often burns before you are aware of it, and what you fry will get a dark dirty appearance. If you use oil, it must be the best olive or salad oil; the inferior eating oil is often bad tasted and stale. Drippings, if clean and fresh, are very good to fry with ; if they are not clean, they may be easily clarified by the means directed for that purpose in receipt, No. 83. To know when the fat is of a proper heat, ac- cording to what you are going to fry, is the great secret in frying. To fry fish, parsley, potatoes, or any thing that contains much water, your jive must he very sharp and clear, and the fat extremely hot *, which you may be pretty sure it is when it has done hissing and is still. We cannot in- sist too strongly on this point: if the fat is not very hot, you cannot fry fish either to a good colour, orfrm and crisp. Bread, eggs, and little things must be put into * To be quite certain, the best way is to throw a little bit of parsley or bread into the pan ; if it fries crisp, the fat is ready; if it burns the bread and is too hot, cut a turnip in slices and put in it; this takes off the heat of the fat and the burnt taste sooner than any thing. \

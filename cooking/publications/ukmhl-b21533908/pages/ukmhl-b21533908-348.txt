SAUCES, GRAVIES, &C. in making gravy, and those I served a great deal of expense.” See the preface to Raffald’s Cook- cry, London, 8vo. 1806. We suppose Mrs. R’s. praise of these two sauces to be well deserved, as they have been copied into almost every cookery book that has gone to press since. Hash Sauce. (No. 451.) Mushroom catsup, three ounces. Eshallot wine, half an ounce. Walnut pickle, one ounce. Browning, one ounce. Mix. If you wish it to keep for a great length of time, add half an ounce of soup-herb spirit to it. Obs. — This is not only a most convenient relish for hashes, but being composed of proper proportions of the ingredients usually employed to flayour and make sauce for hashes, it will save much time apd trouble, and is thus easily made. Take a piepe of butter about as big as a walnut, put it into a stewpan, and set it on the fire ; when it looks brown, put to it a tablespoonful of flour; stir it thoroughly together, aud add to it twelve berries of black pepper, and the same of allspice, a teaspoonful of soup-herb powder, and a teaspoon- ful of salt, and three tablespoonsful of hash sauce ; put to it a pint of boiling water, and let it boil gently over a slow fire for a quarter of an hour, then strain it through a sieve, and it is ready to re- ceive the meat that is to be warmed in it. Piquante Vinegar, or Sauce for Salads or Cold Meats. (No. 452.) Horseradish scraped fine, two ounces.

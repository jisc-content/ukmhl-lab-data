broths, gravies, and soups. breast from the fins, always keeping the edge of your knife on the side of the breast, otherwise it may happen you may break the gall, which is very large, and if broken, your turtle is spoiled. Cut your breast into four pieces, next take away the guts, beginning by the liver, and cut away the gall, to be out of danger at once. The guts are to be thrown away : 1 have seen some cooks have them cleaned and cut in pieces, and put into the soup, but generally they are left on the gentle- men's plates : a basin of turtle is considered a treat, consequently it should be so dressed that none be left on the plate or basin. When your turtle is emptied, throw the heart, liver, kidneys, and lights, into water, cut away the fins to the root, I mean as near to the back shell as possible, next cut the fins in the second joint, that the white meat may be separated from the green: scrape the fat that sticks against the back shell, or calliopasb, take it like as if you was skimming any thing, and put it aside. Cut the calliopash into four pieces. Set a large turbot pan on the fire, and when it boils dip a fin into it for a minute, then take it out and peel it very clean ; when that is done, take another, and so on till all are done ; then the head, next the shell and breast, piece by piece. Be careful to have the peel and shell entirely cleaned off, then put In the same pan some clean water, with the breast and back, Itlie four fin?, and the head ; let it boil till the bones will leave the meat; put with it a large faggot of turtle herbs as big as your two fists, four bay leaves, and some thyme. If you mean to make two dishes of the fins, you must take them away when they have been boiled one hour. . j

Relishing Rashers of Bacon. (No. 527-) If you have any cold bacon in the larder, you may make a very nice dish of it by cutting it into slices rather more than a quarter of an inch thick ; grate some crust of bread, and powder them well with it on both sides ; lay the rashers in a cheese-toaster: they will be browned on one side in about three minutes; then turn them and do the other. Obs—These are a delicious accompaniment to poached or fried eggs: the bacon, from hav- ing been boiled * first, eats extremely tender and mellow. They are a very excellent garnish round veal cutlets, or calf’s head hash, or green pease, or beans. * To boil bacon, see No. t3.

MADE DISHES. Knuckle of Veal Stewed with Rice. (No. 523.) As boiled knuckle of veal cold is not a very favourite relish with the generality, cut off some steaks from it, which you may dress as in the foregoing receipt, and leave the knuckle no larger than will be eaten the day it is dressed. Break the shank bone, wash it clean, and put it in a large stewpan with two quarts of water, one onion, two blades of mace, and a teaspoonful of salt: set it on a quick fire ; when it boils, take off all the scum : wash and pick a pound of rice, and put it into the stewpan with the meat, and let it stew very gently for two hours : put the meat, &c. in a deep dish, and the rice round it. Send up bacon with it, parsnips, or greens, and finely minced parsley and butter. Mr. Gay’s Receipt to Stew a Knuckle of Veal. (No. 524.)

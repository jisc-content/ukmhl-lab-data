ROASTING. A Leg, (No. 50.) Of eight pounds, will require two hours and a half: score the skin across in narrow stripes, about half an inch apart; stuff the knuckle with a little sase and onion minced fine ; rub a little sweet oil on the skin with a paste brush, or a goose feather j this makes the crackling crisp and brown much better than basting it with dripping; and it will be a better colour than all the art and dili- gence of cookery can make it any other way. This way of dressing, also, always prevents the skin from blistering. Leg of Pork roasted without the Skin, or Mock Goose. (No. 5L) Parboil it for half an hour, take off the skin, and then put it down to roast, and baste it with butter, and make a savoury powder of dried and powdered sage, ground black pepper, salt, nut- meg, and bread crumbs ; sprinkle it with this from time to time, as it roasts ; put half a pint of made gravy into the dish. % The Grishin (No. 52.) Of seven or eight pounds may be dressed in the above manner : it will take an hour and a half roasting. Bacon, Sparerib, (No. 53.)

BOILING. Boil (by themselves) some Spanish, or the whitest common onions you can get; when they are tender, drain them in a hair sieve, and put them to the tripe in a tureen or soup-dish : take oft'the fat if any floats on the surface; but tripe dressed in this way is seldom greasy. Obs. â€” Rashers of bacon are a very good companiraent to boiled tripe.

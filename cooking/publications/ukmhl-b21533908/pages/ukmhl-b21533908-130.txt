BROILING. must always keep away so much of the heat as their breadth covers : it is absolutely necessary they should be thoroughly hot before the thing to be cooked be laid on them. The bars of gridirons should be made concave, terminating in a trough to catch the gravy; and also keep the fat from dropping into the tire and making a smoke, which will spoil your broil. The upright gridirons are the best, as they can be used at any tire without fear of smoke, and all the gravy is preserved.

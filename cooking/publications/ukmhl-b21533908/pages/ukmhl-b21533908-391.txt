MADE DISHES. Hash Beef and Roast Beef Bones Broiled. (No. 506.) To hash beef, see Receipt lo hash mutton. The best part to hash is the fillet or inside o f the sirloin, and the good housewife will always endea- vour to preserve this entire for this purpose. Roast beef bones furnish a very relishing lun- cheon, prepared in the following manner. Divide the bones, leaving good picking of meat on each ; score them in squares, pour some melted butter on them, and pepper and salt; put them in a dish, and set them in a Dutch oven, and give ihem a brown on the gridiron. Ox-Cheek Stewed. (No. 507.) If convenient, prepare this the day before it is to be eaten ; cleanse it, and put it to soak all night in salt and water; next day wipe it clean, and put it into a stewpan with two quarts of water and a pint of table-beer that is neither bitter nor stale ; skim it well when it is coming to a boil, and let it simmer for two hours: slice a couple of onions, fry them brown in a little butter and flour, and put them into the soup, with two whole onions with a clove in each, three turnips quartered, a couple of carrots sliced, a bay leaf, a head of celery, and a bundle of sweet herbs, pepper and salt; let it stew till perfectly tender, take out the cheek, divide it into handsome pieces; skim and strain the gravy, and add to it a tablespoonful of basil or elder vinegar, the like quantity of mush- room or walnut catsup, and the same of browning. Serve up in a soup or ragout dish. Obs. — This is a very economical, nourishing, and savoury meal. ■

SAUCES AND GRAVIES. slices, and about an ounce of bacon, or bam, or fresh butter ; lay them at the bottom of a two quart stewpan, with one blade of mace tied up in a nosegay of a small sprig of sweet marjoram, the same of winter savory or lemon-thy me and parsley, a rollof lemon-peel, two cloves stuck into a middling sized onion, a dozen berries of allspice, and half a dozen of black pepper; put to this three table- spoonsful of water, cover it, and set it on a slow fire till the liquor is all boiled away, and the meat has got very well browned, but take care it is not at all burnt: the time this will take depends so much on the state of the fire, the best way to make sure of your sauce is, when it has been boil- ing a few minutes, take off the cover and watch it; when the meat has got a nice brown, pour in a quart of boiling water; when it boils, catch the scum, and put in a crust of bread toasted very brown, and let it stew very gently for an hour and a half: take a spoonful of thickening, made as per receipt, No. 257, stir it into it by degrees, and let it simmer gently for a quarter of an hour longer, strain it through a fine hair sieve, or tammis cloth, put in a tablespoonful of mushroom catsup, a saltspoonful of salt, and half a one of pepper. This will be a rich, high brown sauce for fish, fowl, or ragout. Obs. â€” If you wish to make it still more relish- ing, especially if it is to be eaten with game, or wild water-fowl; you may add a tablespoonful of port wine, the juice of half a lemon, and a roll of the rind cut thin, and if you think it not strong enough, use double the quantity of meat and bacon.

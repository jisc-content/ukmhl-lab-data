broths, gravies, and soups: Mock Turtle, tfs made by M. Birch, one of Apiciuss Assistants in this fVork. (No. 246.) Take two pounds of gravy-beef, with a small knuckle of veal, about Slbs; chop the bone, and cut the beef in thin slices; put it into a gallon stewpan, with half a pint of water, a slice of lean ham or ba- con, one turnip, one carrot, three onions, with four cloves stuck in one, a teaspoonful of black pepper, the same of allspice, a bundle of sweet herbs ; put it over a slow fire till it is of a light brown, but be very careful it does not burn; then put to it two quarts of boiling water, let it simmer for two hours, then strain it off, and put two quarts more; simmer it for three hours longer, strain it off, and set it by till next day : boil half a calf’s head with the skin on, three quarters of an hour; when cold, cut the meat off in small square pieces. To thicken your soup, put an ounce of butter into a stewpan ; as soon as it is melted, mix two tablespoonsful of flour with it, stirring it over the fire a few minutes ; then mix the gravy with it by degrees : as soon as it boils, mix three tablespoonsful of oatmeal with cold water, and put to the soup ; let it boil for ten minutes, strain it, and put it into the stew- pan again with the meat, and a roll of lemon-peel; simmer it for an hour and a half, or two hours, till quite tender, and finish your soup with sea- soning it with wine, catsup, lemon-juice, &c. Obs. — The above is most excellent, and was eaten with unanimous and perfect approbation, by the “ Com- mittee of Taste/' (vide Preface,) who ordered it to be printed, as well as the following receipt, which is rather more economical.

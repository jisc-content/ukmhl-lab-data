FRYING. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. Frying is often a convenient mode of cookery, as it may be performed on a fire which will not do for broiling; and by the introduction of the pan between the meat and the fire, things get more equally dressed. Be very particular, in frying, never to use any oil, butter, lard, or drippings, but what is quite clean, fresh, and free from salt. Any thing dirty spoils the look, any thing bad tasted or stale spoils the flavour, and salt prevents its taking a brown- ing. Fine olive oil is by far the most delicate medium for frying; but to have the best oil is very expensive, and bad oil spoils every thing that is dressed with it. For general purposes, and especially for fish, or bread, clean fresh lard* is the best thing to fry with : it is not so expen- sive as oil or clarified butter, and does almost as * If drained through a hair sieve, it will do a second time as well as it does the first.

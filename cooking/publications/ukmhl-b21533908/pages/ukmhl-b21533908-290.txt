SAUCES AND GRAVIES. Ragout Sauce, or strong Beef Gravy with Mushrooms. (No. 330.) Choose a dozen very large flaps, the biggest full opened mushrooms that you can get, cut out the stalks, peel off the skin, and scrape away the gills, then strew over them a little pepper and salt. Cut three pounds of steaks, half an inch thick, from a good part of the beef, where there is little fat; the leg of mutton, or neck piece, is very pro- per for this purpose. Beat the steaks well, and season them moderately with a little salt. Cover the bottom of a gallon stewpan with a couple of slices of fat bacon; upon these lay four or five of the mushrooms, then lay in some of the beef steaks, upon these the rest of the mushrooms, and the rest of the beef steaks over them. Cut to pieces two onions and four carrots, half a dozen cloves, four blades of mace, a dozen and a half berries of black pepper, and a dozen of allspice, as much grated nutmeg as will lay on a sixpence, and a faggot of thyme, knotted marjoram, winter sa- vory, and parsley, whose stems when tied up will be as big as two fingers: cover the stewpan, and set it over a gentle fire, and watch how the gravy comes ; when there is a good deal, set it on a better fire, and let it boil away till the meat is nearly dry, and it begins to stick to the pan ; then uncover it, stir all about, and put the vegetables and herbs undermost, that they may get brown, but take eaie they are not burned: then pour in three pints of boiling w ater, and put it on a slow fire to simmer gently for an hour and a halt.

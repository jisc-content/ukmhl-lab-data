PREFACE. to those graud masters and mistresses of the alimentar art, who are commonly called « profess cooks, vvliose greatest praise is in contriving dishes, not to alia the appetite, but to excite it, to gratify those wh live upon sauces instead of food, and who see the sui rise with no other hope than that they shall fill thei bellies before it sets. I have written for those w- inake nourishment the chief end of eating % and do no * Although pleasing the palate be the main end in mos;‘ books of cookery, it is my aim to blend the toothsomt with the wholesome; for, after all, however the hale Gourmauc xuay at first differ from me in opinion, the latter is the chie: concern ; since if he be even so entirely devoted to the pleasure of eating, as to think of no other, still the care of his health becomes part of that; if he is sick, he cannot relish hh{ food. “ The term gourmand, or epicure, has been strangely per- verted ; it has been conceived synonimous with a gluttony like that of the great eater of Kent; or a fastidious appetitfe only to be excited by fantastic dainties, as the brains of pea- cocks or parrots, the tongues of tlirushes and nightingales, or the teats of a lactiferous sow. In the liberal acceptation of the term epicure, and as I use it, it means only the person who relishes his food cooked according to scientific principles, so prepared that the palate is delighted, rendered of easy so» lution in the stomach, and ultimately contributing to health; exciting him, as an animal, to the vigorous enjoyment of those recreations and duties, physical and intellectual, which con- stitute the happiness and dignity of his nature.” In this ety- jeste Betti pure' hits one Ian W lllfi inlit our W i ai to1 Dr, ctr tali Jiif Api he

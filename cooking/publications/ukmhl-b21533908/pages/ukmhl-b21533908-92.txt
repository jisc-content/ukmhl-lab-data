ROASTING. Sirloin of BEEF. (No. 19.) The noble sirloin of about fifteen pounds will require to be before the fire about four hours : take care to spit it straight, that it may not be heavier on one side than the other ; put a little clean dripping into the drippingpan, tie a sheet of paper over it to preserve the fat*, and baste it well as soon as it is put down, and baste it-every quarter of an hour all the time it is roasting till the last half hour; then take off the paper, stir the fire and make it clear: to brown and froth it, sprinkle a little salt over it, baste it with butter, and dredge it with flour; let it go a few minutes longer till the froth rises, take it up, put it on the dish, &c. To make gravy for it, put a teaspoon- ful of salt into half a pint of boiling water, and pour it over the underside of the meat, and through the hole the spit comes out of. Garnish with horseradish scraped as fine as possible with a very sharp knife. A Yorkshire pudding is an excellent accompaniment. (No. 595.) Obs. â€” The inside of the sirloin must never be cut hot, but reserved entire for the hash. (See some hints to housekeepers on this subject in the Receipt to Hash Beef.) No. 506. * If there is more fit than you think will be eaten with the meat, cut it off, it will make an excellent pudding; or clarify it, and use it for frying.

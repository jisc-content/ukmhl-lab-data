BROTHS, GRAVIES, AND SOUPS. Beef Cullis, or rich and thickened Gram/, (No. 189.) Take a tablespoonful of tlie thickening, No. 257, of sauces, end put it into a basin, with a ladleful of the gravy; stir it quick ; then add the rest by degrees, till it is all well mixed, then pour it back into the stewpan, where the meat, &c. is; see the sauce is of a proper thickness, and leave it by the side of the fire to simmer for half an hour, that the thickening may thoroughly incor- porate with the gravy, the stewpan being only half covered, stirring it every now and then ; a sort of scum will gather on the top, which it is best not to take off till you are ready to strain it through a tammis *. Take care it is neither too pale nor too dark a colour ; if it is not thick enough, put it into a clean stewpan; and if you wish it stronger, let it stew longer, till it is re- duced to the desired thickness : if it is too thick, you can easily thin it with a spoonful or two of warm broth, or water. When your sauce is done, stir it in the basin you put it into once or twice, while it is cooling. Family Soup. (No. 190.) Put on eight or ten pounds of brisket of beef in a * A tammis is a worsted cloth, sold at the oil shops, made on purpose for straining sauces; the best way of using it is for two people to twist it contrary ways : this is a much bet- ter way of straining sauce than through a sieve, and refines it much more completely.

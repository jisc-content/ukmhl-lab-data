BROTHS, GRAVIES, AND SOUPS. Port wine, and a pottle of mushrooms ; when your sauce boils, put your four tins in ; after having taken away all the small bones that are seen breaking through the skin, put with it a fag- got of a few sprigs of parsley, a bit of thyme, one bay leaf, and four cloves, and let it simmer one hour: ten minutes before you dish, put five dozen of button onions that you have ready peeled : when you dish, put in each dish a hind fin and a fore one, and look if it is salt enough. If you have no hrozon sauce, pul in a stezcpan a quarter of a pound of butter ; when it is melted, put to it two wooden spoonsful of flour, stir it on the fire till it gets a hazel colour, pour a bottle of Port zcine in it, a ladleful of broth, This receipt is from the same source as the pre- j ceding one, and is an excellent and highly finish- I ed soup. Have a calf’s head scalded with the skin on, cut ij it in two, take out the brain, and wash your head j well; when well cleaned, tie it up in a cloth, and fi let it boil four hours, then take it out, and let it j • cool till you want it. Have a pound of lean ham j, cut in slices, range them to the bottom of a stock- I { pot, or braising kettle ; cut two knuckles of veal | into pieces, put them over your ham, put a j,1 ladlcful of broth or water in your stock-pot, and r set it over a brisk fire ; when the meat begins to I stick to the bottom, cover your meat with water; j when it has been skimmed well, put two carrots, || two onions, three bay leaves, four cloves, three j blades of mace, a large faggot of turtle herbs, and I and, when it boils, do as before inentioned, and scum it well.

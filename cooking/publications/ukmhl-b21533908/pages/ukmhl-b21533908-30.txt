PREFACE. I have here done my utmost candidly to comniuni* cate, in as clear and intelligible a manner as I am able, heartiest, the glare of a vivid scorching fire, and the smoke so baneful to the eyes and the complexion: these are conti- nual and inevitable dangers, and a cook must live in the midst of them, as a soldier in a field of battle, surrounded by bullets, and bombs, and Congreve’s rockets; with this only difference, that for the first, every day is a fighting day, that his warfare is almost always without glory, and his most praiseworthy achievements pass not only without re- ward, but frequently without even thanks ; for the name of the most consummate cook is, alas! seldom heard by the guests who frequent his master’s table; who, while they are eagerly devouring his turtle, and drinking his wine, care very little who dressed the one, or sent the other. The master who wishes to enjoy the rare luxury of a table regularly well served in the best style, must treat his cook as his friend, and watch over his health * with the tenderest care, and especially be sure his taste does not suffer from his stomach being deranged by bilious attacks, &c. t The most experienced artists cannot be sure of their work without tasting ; they must be incessantly tasting; and the spoon of a good cook is continually passing from the stewpans to his tongue; for nothing but frequent tasting his sauces, ragouts, &c., can discover to him what progress they I . * The greatest care should be taken by the man of fashion, that his cook’s health be preserved : one hundredth part of the attention usually bestowed on his dog, or his horse, will suffice to regulate his animal system.—A.

BOILING. Take care that the covers of your boiling* pots fit close, not only to prevent unnecessary eva- poration of the water, but that the smoke of the fire may not insinuate itself under the edge of the lid, and give the meat a bad taste. Never let your meat or poultry remain in the water after it is done enough, as that makes it sodden, and it loses its flavour. Beef and mutton a little underdone is not a great fault — by some people it is preferred — but lamb, pork, and veal, are uneatable if not tho- roughly boiled. A trivet set on the bottom of your boiling pots, raising the contents about four inches from the bottom, w ill be found a great improvement, and always prevent that side of the meat which comes next the bottom from being done too much. If you have not a trivet, use four skewers, or a plate. Take care of the liquor you have boiled your meat in ; for in these times no good housewife has any pretensions to rational economy w ho boils a joint without making some sort of soup. If the liquor be too salt, only use half the quantity, and the rest water, &c. The best way is to wash salted meat well with cold water before you put it into the boiler.

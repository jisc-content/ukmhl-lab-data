PREFACE. merits of digestion are in a delicate and impaired state, and commonly pleads with more perfect truth (for those materials they stand most in need of,) than any dietetic rules that can be contrived. To affirm that such a thing is wholesome, or un- wholesome, without considering the subject in all the circumstances which it bears relation to, is, with sub- mission, talking nonsense *. No regimen of life can be laid down that will suit every body ; no food is so delicious that it pleases all palates; and nothing can be more correct than the old adage, “ one man’s meat is another man’s poison.” It would be as difficult for a Laplander to convince our good citizens that train oil is a more elegant relish * Celsus spoke very sensibly when he said, 11 that a healthy . man under his own government, ought not to tie himself up by strict rules, nor to abstain from any sort of food; that he ought sometimes to fast, and sometimes to feast.’’ When ap- plied to eating, nothing is more true than that “ Bonarum rerum, consuetudo pessima eat.” The author of this work wishes he had leisure to devote more time to the subject. An ingenious chemist, and an intelligent cook, might form a very complete work, by taking for their text Dr. George Pearson’s admirably arranged catalogues of food, drink, and seasoning; the most comprehensive and learned abstract of this subject we have ever seen. This epitome was printed for his Lectures on Therapeutics, &c. which the author attended in 1801.

FISH. F 4 salt, take off the scum, if any rises, have the fish well washed, put it in, and let it boil half an hour. Salmon Broiled. (No. 163.) Clean the salmon well, and cut it into slices three inches thick, dry it thoroughly in a clean cloth, and rub it all over with sweet oil, or thick melted butter, and sprinkle a little salt over it ; put your gridiron over a clear fire, at some dis- tance; when it is hot, wipe it clean, and then rub it with sweet oil or lard ; lay the salmon on, and when it is done on one side, turn it gently and broil the other side. Anchovy sauce. Eels Stezved TViggys way. (No. 164.) Take two pounds of fine silver* eels ; the best size arc those that are not much less than a three- shilling-piece in circumference, quite fresh, full of life, and as brisk as an eel; such as have been kept out of water fill they can scarce stir, are good for nothing. Gut them, and rub them with salt till the slime is cleaned from them, wash them in three different waters, and divide them into pieces about four inches long: you may season them with salt, and beaten mace or nutmeg, and then egg and bread crumb them ; dredge them with a little flour, and fry them in drippings till they are brown; lay them to dry on a hair sieve. * The yellow eels are apt to taste muddy; the whiteness of the belly of the fish, is not the only mark to know the best; the right colour ol the back is a coppery hue, very bright; the olive coloured are inferior; and those tending to a green are worse.

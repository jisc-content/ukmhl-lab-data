BROTHS, GRAVJES, ANI> SOUPS. Pease Soup. (No. 218.) To one quart of split peas (whole peas are often difficult to burst,) put one gallon of soft water, and a pound of bacon, (not very fat,) or roast beef bones, or four anchovies, or instead of the gallon of water, a gallon of the liquor in which meat has been boiled, tasting it first, to make sure it is not too salt. Wash two heads of celery, cut it, and put it in, with two large onions peeled, a sprig of savory, and sweet marjoram ; set it on the trivet, and let it boil gently over a slow fire, stirring it every quarter of an hour (to keep the peas from sticking to the bottom,) till the peas are tender, which will be in about three hours;. then work it through a coarse hair sieve, and then through a fine one with the back of a wooden spoon ; put it into a clean stewpan, with half a teaspoonful of ground black pepper *, let it boil again for ten minutes, and if any fat arises, skim it off. You may put in a head of celery cut into pieces an inch long, or a score of young button onions. Cut a slice of bread, that has been baked two or three days, into dice about half an inch square ; put a tablespoonful of clean drippings into an iron fryingpan, and when it is melted, put in the bread, and fry it a light brown colour; take it up with a fish slice, and lay it on a sheet of paper to drain the grease; be careful this is done nicely: send these up in one side . . . , Â« * Some put in dried mint rubbed to a fine powder; but as every body does not like mint, it is best to send it up on a plate.

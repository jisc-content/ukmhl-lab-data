PREFACE. This carelessness in the cook is the more surprising; as the confectioner is regularly attentive, in the descrip, lion of his preparations, to give the exact quantities, though his business, compared to cookery, is as unim- portant as the ornamental is inferior to the useful: yet the maker of blanchmange, custards, and trifles, and the endless and useless collection of pretty play-things for the palate, is scrupulously exact, even to a grain, in his ingredients, whilst the cooks affect to be most unin- telligibly indefinite, although they are intrusted with the administration of our food, upon the proper preparation of which all our powers of both body and mind depend ; the energy being invariably in the ratio of the perform- ance of the restorative process. Unless the stomach be in good humour, every part of the machinery of life will vibrate with languor. We may compare the human frame to a watch, of which the heart is the main spring, the stomach the re- gulator, and what we put into it the key by which the machine is set agoing; according to the quantity, quality, and proper digestion of what we eat and drink, will be the pace of the pulse, and the action of the system in general: and when a due proportion is preserved between the quantum of exercise and that of excitement, all goes well: when disordered, the same expedients are employed for its readjustment as are used by the watch maker; the machine requires to be carefully cleaned, and then judiciously oiled.

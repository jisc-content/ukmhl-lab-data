BROILING. Beef Steaks*. (No. 94.) Those 'who are nice about steaks never attempt to have them except in weather that permits the meat to be hung till it is tender. The best steaks are those cut from the middle of the rump, that has been killed at least four days, when they can be cut about six inches long, four inches wide, and half an inch thick, let them be beaten with a chopper, or rolling pin, to make them tender; take care to have a very clear brisk fire, and throw a little salt on it, to take off the sulphur, make the gridiron hot, and set it slanting, to pre- vent the fat from dropping into the fire, and making a smoke. For want of these little atten- tions, this very common dish, which every body is supposed capable of dressing, seldom comes to table in perfection. Put a tablespoonful of catsup and a little minced shalot into a dish before the fire, while you broil the steak; turn it often, to keep the gravy in : it will be done in ten minutes ; rub a bit of butter over it, and send it up garnished with horseradish. No. 356. * The season for these is from the 29th of Sept, to the 25th of March.

SAUCES, GRAVIES, &C. pewter dish, and let them dry grad a ally by thtf fire till all the juice is dried into the peels; then put them into a stone jar, with half an ounce of mace, quarter of an ounce of cloves beat fine, half an ounce of nutmeg cut in thin slices, two ounces of garliek peeled, quarter of a pound of mustard-seed bruised a little, and tied in a muslin bag; pour a quart of boiling white wine vinegar upon them, close the pitcher or jar well up, and let it stand five or six days by the fire: shake it well every day, then tie it up as close as possible, and let it stand for three months. When you bottle it, put the pickle and lemon into a hair sieve, press them well, to get out the liquor; let it stand till next day; then pour off the fine and bottle it; let the rest stand three or four days and it will settle; pour off the fine again, and let it again settle till you have poured off all you can get fine. It may be put into any white sauce, and will not hurt the colour; is very good for fish sauce and made dishes, especially of veal; a tea- spoonful is enough for white, and two for brown sauce for a fowl : it is a most useful pickle, and gives a pleasant flavour : be sure you put it in before you thicken the sauce, or put any cream in, lest the sharpness make it curdle. Obs u I have given no directions for cullis, as I have found by experience that lemon-pickle arid browning answer both for beauty and taste, (at a trifling expense,) better than the most ex- travagant cullisses. Had I known the use and value of these two receipts when I first took upon me the part and duty of a housekeeper, they would have saved me a great deal of trouble

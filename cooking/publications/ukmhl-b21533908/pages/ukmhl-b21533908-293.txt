SAUCES AND GRAVIES. ries of black, and the same of Jamaica pepper, a sprig of lemon-thyme and sweet marjoram, or sa- vory, and two leaves of basil, or half a bay leaf; (<he bones of any kind of roast meat broken to pieces, and stewed with it, are a great improve- ment ; as will also be the cuttings or trimmings of any joint you may have in the house ;) boil slowly till your gravy is reduced nearly half; then strain it into a clean stewpan, bruise the liver well, and rub it through a sieve with a wooden spoon, thicken it with a little bit of butter rolled in flour, and add a teaspoonful of browning, and a tablespoonful of red wine, and the same of any kind of catsup you think proper. Obs. â€” If you have no cuttings or trimmings of meat, an anchovy will sometimes be a good sub- stitute. Mock Gravy Sauce. (No. 335.) Half a pint of water, and half as much good small beer, or two tablespoonsful of ale that is neither bitter nor stale, and a bundle of sweet herbs ; slice an onion, a small piece of thin lemon- peel, two cloves, a blade of mace, six berries of allspice, and the same of black pepper bruised, and a tablespoonful of mushroom catsup, and the same quantity of port wine. Put a bit of butter about as big as a walnut into a saucepan ; when it is melted, put in a sliced onion, shake in a little flour, stir it well with a wooden spoon till the froth sinks, and it has caught a little brown ; then by degrees stir in the above ingredients, and let it stew for half an hour, and strain it well, and when cold take off the fat.

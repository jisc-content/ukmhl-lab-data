PREFACE. If you have a well-ventilated larder, in a shady, drv situation, you will ensure much credit to yourself by ordering in your meat and poultry such a time before you want it as will render it tender, which the finest meat cannot be, unless hung a proper lime; (see obser- vations on roasting ;) longer or shorter, according to the season and nature of the meat, &c., but always till it has made some advance towards putrefaction ! The ten- dency to that takes place the moment that life is extin- guished. The allowing this process to proceed to a cer- tain degree, renders the meat more easy of solution in tiie stomach, without diminishing the nutritious quality of it. Before you go to market* look over your larder, and it will save you much time and trouble to make out a list of the several articles you want, because when once your kitchen business is begun, you must never leave off till it is finished : if you have forgotten any article indispensable for the day’s dinner, request your employers to send one of the servants for it: the cook must never quit her post till her work is complete. It is not expected that the most expert artist can per- form his work in a perfect manner, without a sufficient number of proper instruments : you cannot have neat work without nice tools; nor can your victuals be well dressed without an apparatus appropriate to the work * Especially on a Saturday. No well-regulated family must suffer the disorderly caterer to be jumping in and out to the chandler’s shop on a Sunday morning.

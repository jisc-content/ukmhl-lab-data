BROTHS, GRAVIES, AND SOUPS. Obs. — This is the universal foundation for all sorts o i soups and sauces, brown or white. I have ordered it to stew no longer than the meat is thoroughly done to eat, and you obtain excellent broth, without depriving the meat of its nutritious succulence : to boil it to rags, as is the common practice, will not enrich your broths, but only make them thick and grouty, and destroy the meat, which when thus gently stewed for only four or five hours, will afford a relishing and wholesome meal for half a dozen people. If it is not to be eaten till cold, cut the meat from the bones, and put it into a mould, and as it grows cold it will take a shape, and will make a very nice dish for luncheon or supper. Beef Gravy. (No. 186.) Cover the bottom of a stewpan, that is well tinned and quite clean, with half a pound ofharn or lean bacon cut into slices, a shin of beef, or six pounds of the sticking-piece cut into half pound pieces, with a carrot, an onion with two cloves stuck in it, and a head of celery ; put a pint of broth or water to it, cover it close, and set it over a moderate fire till the water is reduced to as little as will just save the ingredients from burn- ing ; then put in four quarts of boiling water*; when it boils up, skim it carefully, and wipe oft’ with a clean cloth what sticks round the edge * A great deal of care is to be taken to watch the time of putting in the water, for if it is poured in too soon, the gravy will not have its true flavour and colour, and if let alone till the meat sticks too much to the pan, it will get a burnt taste.

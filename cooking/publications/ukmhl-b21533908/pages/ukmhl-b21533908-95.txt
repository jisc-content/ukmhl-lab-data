ROASTING. A Chine, (No. 2,5.) (i. e. tlic two loins) or A Saddle, (No. 26) (i.e. the two necks,) of ten or eleven pounds, two hours and a half: tie a sheet of paper over them : basic the strings you tie it on with directly, or they will bum; and let the meat be well basted. A Shoulder, (No. 27) Of seven pounds, an hour and a half: put the spit in close to the shank bone, and run it along the blade bone; take care to froth it nicely. A Loin# (No. 28.) Of mutton an hour and a half. The most elegant way of carving this, is to cut it lengthwise, as you do a saddle. A Neck, (No. 29.) An hour and a half. It must be carefully jointed, or it is very bad to carve. ; ,* Common cooks very seldom brown the ends of neck and ' joins: to have this done nicely, and in perfection, let the fire be a few inches longer at each end than the joint that is roasting, l and occasionally place the spit slanting, so that each end mav i get sufficient fire : but nothing does this in such perfection l as the concave reflectors before mentioned. This is much better than taking up the meat and putting it down before the fire to do the ends ; as, by the latter method, you cannot send it i to table frothed. c 5

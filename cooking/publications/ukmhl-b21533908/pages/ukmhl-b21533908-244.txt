BROTHS, GRAVIES, AND SOUPS. Put in a small stewpan, the liver, lights, heart, and kidneys, and the fat you have put aside ; take some of the liquor that the other part has been boiled in ; cover your stewpan close, and let it boil gently for three hours.

Put all these pieces on a ' dish in your larder till your broth is ready. To make your broth, put on a large stock-pot, and line the bottom of it with a pound and a half of lean ham, cut into slices. Cut into pieces a leg of veal of sixteen or twenty pounds weight, except a pound of the fillet that you save for the force- meat, put the rest upon the ham, with all the white meat of the turtle, and a couple of old fowls; put it on a smart fire, with two ladiesful of broth or consomme; let it reduce to a glaze ; when it begins to stick to the bottom, pour the liqnor into the pot where the other part of the turtle has been boiled, add to it a little more sweet herbs, twenty-four grains of allspice, six blades of mace, two large onions, four carrots, half an ounce of whole pepper, and some salt, let it simmer for four hours, and then strain the broth through a cloth sieve. Put the green part of the turtle that has been cut in pieces, and nicely cleaned, with two bottles of Madeira in the same ; when it has boiled a few minutes with your turtle, add to it the broth, then put in a stewpan half a pound of butter, when it is melted, add to it four wooden spoonsful of flour, stir it on the fire till the flour is a fine brown

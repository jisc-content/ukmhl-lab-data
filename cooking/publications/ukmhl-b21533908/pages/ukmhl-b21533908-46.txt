TABLE OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES. Glass measures, divided into tea and table spoons, and containing from an ounce to half a pint, may be bad at Hancock’s Glass Warehouse, Charing Cross; and at Prick’s, near Exeter Change, Strand; where may also be had double-headed pepper and spice boxes, with caps over the gratings. The superiority of these, by preserving the contents from the action of the air, must be sufficiently obvious to every one : the fine flavour of Cayenne pepper is soon lost, from the bottles it is usually kept in not being well stopped.

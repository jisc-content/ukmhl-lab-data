MADE DISHES. Veal Cutlets Broiled. (No. 521.) Divide the best end of a neck of veal into cut- lets, one rib to each; make a few fine bread crumbs, mince a little parsley and a very little shallot as small as possible; put it into a clean stewpan with two ounces of butter; fry it for a minute, then put it on a plate to cool: when cold, mix the yolks of two eggs with it, and season it with pepper and salt; dip the cutlets into this mixture, and then into the bread; lay them on a gridiron over a clear slow fire ; they will take a quarter of an hour: send up with them a few slices of bacon fried, or done in the Dutch oven. Knuckle of Veal, to ragout. (No. 522.) Cut a knuckle of veal into slices about half an inch thick; pepper, salt, and flour them; fry them a light brown ; put the trimmings into a stewpan, with the bone broke in several places ; an onion sliced ; a head of celery; a bunch of sweet herbs, and three blades of bruised mace : pour in warm water enough to cover it about an inch ; cover your pot close, and let it stew very o'ently for a couple of hours : thicken it with flour and butter; put in a spoonful of catsup, a glass of wine, and juice of half a lemon; give it a boil up, and strain into a clean stewpan; put in the meat and make it hot, and serve up.

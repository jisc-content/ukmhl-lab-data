PREFACE. with tiiese they toddle home in triumph, cackling all the way, like a goose that has got ankle deep into good luck. Mrs. Howard’s servant corroborated her statement, and added, that defendant, as he was quitting the house, desired her to boil the fowl double the time her mistress told her, because it was a large one. It was accordingly boiled more than double the usual time. The defendant*did not attempt to deny that the fowl was an old one, but said, he was himself deceived by the person of whom he purchased it, and the plaintiff having seen it be- fore she paid for it, could not complain of any imposition being practised upon her. The Court, however, decided that the defendant should re- fund the four shillings, and pay all the costs. It was plain, that when he sold the fowl he was aware of the imposition he was practising. lie had given evidence of this himself, by de- siring the servant to boil it longer than the usual time. At the same time, however, that the Court thus gave judgment against the defendant, they cuuld not avoid censuring, to a certain extent, the plaintiff, and all those who encouraged persons of the defendant’s description, by dealing with them. Little doubt could exist in the mind of any one, that most of the fowls thus hawked about the streets were stolen, at least by those who sold them to the hawkers; and whilst the thieves could find so ready a market for their plunder, there was little chance that the robbing of fowl-houses would be put an end to. The defendant being informed, that unless the debt and costs were immediately paid, an execution would forthwith issue against him, paid the sum demanded, and departed. b 4

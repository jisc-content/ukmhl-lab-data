ROASTING. Roast Pig. (No. 56.) A roasting pig is considered to be in primest order for the spit when about three weeks old; should be fat, and newly killed. It is not like other meats, good as long as they are sweet. The I pig loses part of its goodness every hour after it is I killed. To be in perfection, it should be killed in the morning to eat at dinner; and it requires very nice and careful roasting ; the ends must have much more fire than the middle. For this pur- pose is contrived an iron to hang before the middle part, called a pig-iron. When the cook has not this, she must keep the fire fiercest at the two ends. Take the crumb of a stale twopenny loaf, i. e. about four ounces, rub it through a cullen- Ider; mince fine a handful of sage, about two ounces and a half, and a large onion, about an ounce and a half*; mix these together with some pepper and salt, and a bit of butter as big as an egg; fill the belly of the pig with this, and sew it up ; lay it to the fire, and take h df a pound of fresh butter and keep basting it till it is quite done, and do not leave it a moment, for it requires the most vigilant attendance. Roast it at a clear brisk fire, at some distance, that the crackling may get nicely crisped and browned without being blistered or burnt : it will be enough in about an hour and a half. Before you take it off the spit, cutoff the head, and part that and the body down the middle; chop the * Boil the sage and onion in a little water (before they are cut); it softens and takes off the rawness of their flavour. 1

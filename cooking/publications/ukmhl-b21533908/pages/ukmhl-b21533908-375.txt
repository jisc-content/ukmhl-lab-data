MADE DISHES. better; and those combinations which excite the circulation at the least expense of nervous and mus- cular irritation, and afford the greatest portion of nourishment, must be most friendly to the stomach, when it demands restorative diet. Jf strong spices and savoury herbs awaken the appetite, they in an increased ratio accelerate the action of the bowels, and prematurely hurry the food through the alimentary canal, too rapidly to allow the absorbents to do their work properly. We advise those whose stomachs stand in need of such artificial stimulants, if they value either in- tensive or extensive life, rather to abstain from dishes requiring a vigorous stomach, than resort to such pernicious means of forcing the action of a feeble one : moreover, by the too frequent use of piquante sauces, &c., the papillary nerves of tlit; palate become so blunted, that in a little time they lose all sensibility and relish for plain nourishing being, for whose benefit they are established. It is very natu- ral that the nrouth, which first receives the aliment, and of course becomes the taster, as it were, in respect of the gullet and stomach, should be endued with a discerning property beyond them ; as it is the part of a good clerk of the kitchen to distinguish himself by an elegant choice of provisions, to prevent his incurring the disp'e.isure of his employers.â€™' Vide the ingenious Le Cas*s Essay on the Senses.

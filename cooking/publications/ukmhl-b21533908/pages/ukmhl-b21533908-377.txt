MADE DISHES. Hash Mutton. (No. 484.) Cut the meat you intend to hash into large handsome slices, about a quarter of an inch thick* (not more,) lay them on a plate* ready ; make your sauce as receipt, No. 360; put in the meat, and let it simmer gently about twenty minutes ; do not let it boil, as that will make your meat grow tough and hard*. To warm up Hashes, (No. 485.) Stews, ragouts, soups, &c. If you have any left, put it into a deep hash dish, or tureen : when you want it, set this in a stcwpan of boiling water; let it stand till the contents are quite hot; it will eat as well as when first made. * All hashes and meats dressed a second time, should only simmer till just warm through : it is supposed they have been done very nearly, if not quite enough, already: though you will, of course, select those parts of the joint that have been least done. In making a hash, from a leg of 'â–  muttony do not destroy the marrow-bone to help the gravy of your hash, to which it will make no perceptible addition ; but saw it in two, twist writing paper round the ends, and send it up on a. plate as a side dish, garnished with sprigs of parsley : if it is a roast leg, preserve the end bone, and send it up between the marrow bones. This is a very pretty luncheon or supper dish.

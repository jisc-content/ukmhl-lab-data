ALAMODE BEEF, or ENGLISH TURTLE. (No. 502.) In the hundred and fifteen volumes on cookei MADE DISHES. we digested before we began to compose ibis work,! we could not find one receipt that approached any I thing like to an accurate description of the way ini which this excellent dish is actually dressed! in the best alamode beef shops; from whence.I; of course, it was impossible to obtain any in-r formation : however, after all, the whole of t'hcr secret seems to be the thickening the gravy (oil beef that has been very slowly stewed) with breath raspings, and flavouring it with bay leaves. I Take about six pounds of the clod of beef," o I the sticking piece; cut it into pieces of two or th ree pounds each; put two ounces of beef drip r pings into a large deep stewpan ; as soon as it iJJJ quite hot, flour your meat, put it into the stewp pan, turn it often till it is a light brown, their cover it with boiling water, and put a quart over I skim it when it boils, and then put in a largl Onion, and half a pint of bread raspings, and lei' it stew very slowly for three hours, then jutr1 crack twelve berries of black pepper, same cr allspice, and four cloves, put them into linen bag, with half a dozen bay leaves, and bunch of sweet herbs, and let them stew an honj ( longer : if you find the meat sufficiently tenderly lake it up with a slice, cut it into quarter ot foe, pound pieces, and put it into a lureeu, and poi:fea, the soup to it. *m* To the above many cooks add an ounce of champignons | but as these arc almost always so decayed, and sometimes i s deleterious quality, they arc better left out.

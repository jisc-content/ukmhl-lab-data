MADE DISHES. A little respect to the suggestions of instinct, every invalid will find of infinite advantage : those who are poor in health, must live as they can : certainly the less stimuli any of us use, the sensation peculiar to the mouth, and distinct from that of hunger or thirst. But, if we trace its origin, we shall be convinced that this organ, which in the mouth makes us sen- sible of the fitness and delicacy of meats and drinks, is the self same principle, that in the mouth, gullet, and stomach, is craving for food, and incites us to a longing after it. These three parts, properly speaking, are but one continued organ, and have but one and the same object. If the mouth cre- ates in us an aversion to any particular food, does not the gullet recoil at the approach of it ? and does not the sto- mach immediately discharge its disagreeable contents? Hunger, thirst, and taste, are therefore three effects of the same or<â€™an. Hunger and thirst are the motions of the organ desirous of its object. The taste is the motion of the organ, in the enjoyment of this object. This unity of the organ, in regard of hunger, thirst, and taste, is the cause of these three effects being almost always in the same propor- tion in the same persons. The more violent the appetite for food is, the greater is the enjoyment in eating; and the more the taste is gratified, the more easily the organs defray the expense of this gratification, by digestion. This rule is gene- ral, in regard of all the sensations and all the passions. Genuine desire constitutes the proportion of the pleasure,, and of the power without this mutual consent, founded on the sympathy of these organs, our sensations would destroy that

They were now all at their prayers under the Oak of Reformation . . . under which Ket and his party exercised their justice, and the Vicar of St. Martin s, Norwich, their ‘ chaplain’, was reading the Litany. Dr. Parker, judging this a very fair opportunity, ascended the oak, and there preached a sermon to them of prudence, sobriety and moderation. . . . All heard him with much attention and goodwill, the Doctor being a most charming preacher, till one of the wicked . . sort of them said ‘ How long shall we bear this hireling teacher, who being hired by the gentlemen, is come hither with a tongue that is sold for money, and tied up for a reward. But for all his prating let us bridle their intolerable power, and bring them under our law.’

xi INTRODUCTION. when an old friend, Sir John Clark, begged, on his wife’s death, that I would see her valuable collection of recipes through the press, and, for old sake’s sake, I could not hut attempt it. So eventually The Cookery Book of Lady Clark of Tillypronie was published, enlivened here and there with her own witty notes, such as probably never appeared in a Cookery book before; for she had not written for the public, and had her own characteristic and amusing way of doing all she did. Who but she would have noted of a specially excellent Oyster Sauce to accompany beefsteak, that the quantity given was sufficient for two couples, or for three bachelors ? Finally, to A Proper newe Booke of Cokerye I was introduced two years ago in Cambridge by the Librarian of Corpus Christi College, who, knowing my interest in the subject, told me of this most delightful black-letter book of the XYIth Century, which has lived so long in the College Library; and at the Librarian’s request on my behalf, I received the kind per- mission of the Master and Fellows to edit it, with such explanatory notes as the ancient wording made necessary. I found, however, that in a reprint of the book something more was required besides the Notes and Glossary, something to bring to mind the different social surroundings of those days from ours, and something also to recall the first owner of the book, his re- markable character and his history, especially as regards its domestic and personal side, as friend, as host, as husband and father, and head of a great household—as a man in fact—a great and typical Englishman.

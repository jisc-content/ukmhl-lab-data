One of these, named Batman, in four years collected six thousand seven hundred books on divinity, astronomy, history, physic, arts, and sciences. In those days “ many of our choicest MSS. were conveyed out of the land beyond sea,” which Parker often lamented. Would that any of these could now be traced! Bale, another great antiquary, says “a great number of those that purchased these monasteries reserved the books of those libraries some to scour their candlesticks, some to rub their boots, some they sold to the grocers and soap sellers, and some they sent over sea to the bookbinders”; and this, alas! “not in small numbers, but at times whole shipsfull, to the wondering of foreign nations. And he said he knew a merchant that bought two noble libraries for foity shillings, and used them for ten years, and yet he had store enough for as many more years to come ” ! Bale upbraids “ our nation with the dishonour of it, wishing heartily the Pope’s laws and the Schoolmen had undergone this fate, rather than our ancient authors both of history and divinity.” He protests that “to put our ancient chronicles, our noble histories, our learned commentaries and homilies upon the Scriptures to so homely an office of subjection and utter contempt, we have both greatly dishonoured our nation and also showed ourselves very wicked to posterity.”

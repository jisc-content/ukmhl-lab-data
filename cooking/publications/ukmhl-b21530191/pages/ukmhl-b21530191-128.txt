cxxii INTRODUCTION. good Archbishop now showed to his own college o Corpus Chnsti, as also his peculiar regard and benevolence to two other colleges in the same University, on account of their having some relation to one another and to his native City of Norwich.” For there was an old agreement made m 1353 between the Master and Fellows of Corpus Chnsti College and of Trinity Hall “ as most friendly brethren ... to assist each other in their causes and businesses,” and they had then agreed, as a sign of unity, that “ they of both colleges should wear the same kind of hood, of shape and cut.” The Arch- bishop revived “ this old amicable instrument,” but enlarged it to include -Gonville and Caius College as well and to each “gave certain silver plate to be kept and reserved within the said three colleges for ever.” The attractive list of it must fill all collectors of plate with envy! for it includes among many other things : “ One great basin with the ewer of silver, whole gilt, with the arms of the Archbishop; one great standing cup with the cover, double gilt; one great salt with the cover; two drinking pots pounced, whole gilt, with one cover; thirteen spoons gilt, with knops of Christ and his twelve Apostles; for the use of the Master and twelve Fellows for the time being.” It was now also that he made provision for a fire in the common hall at his College in the winter season, and for the increase of the College Commons on some particular days, such as the days when the Masters of Caius and of Trinity Hall came to inspect the Library at Corpus; and it was now also that he founded many of the scholarships of which mention has been made. #GonviIle Hall, the original College, was a Norfolk foundation and this specially interested Parker in it.

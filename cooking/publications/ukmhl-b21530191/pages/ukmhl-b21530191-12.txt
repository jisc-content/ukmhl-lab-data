VI My sincere thanks are due to Sir Frederic Kenyon for much invaluable help at the British Museum; also to the undermentioned gentle- men for kind permission to quote from books and articles, reference to which has greatly lightened my task. Where space allowed, I have added initials or names of hooks or authors quoted; but I trust I shall be forgiven if, by inadver- tence, anything important is given without due acknowledgment.

My special thanks are due to Mr. John Hodgkin, F.L.S., whose valuable notes on antique culinary terms and the derivations of words are embodied in the Glossary with his initials, and whose kind help in unravelling difficulties I gratefully acknowledge. Above all I must cordially thank the Librarian of Corpus Christi College, for his unfailing assistance and encouragement throughout my work. C. F. FRERE. August, 1913.

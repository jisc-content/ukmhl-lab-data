Sen: IV. A good relished apple that lasts two years Apple Moyse. Halliwell says, from one authority who spells it “ apple mose,” that it was made of apples after they had been pressed for cider, seasoned with spices. The recipe in this book is for a land of apple compote. [There are many variants of the word apple moyse; appul mose, Sloane MS. 1201; appul mus, Sloane MS. 1108; apple mose, or muse, Harl: MS. 279. In the reprint of the Noble Boke of Cookery it is incorrectly described as Appilnose—a misprint probably (the word really is Appilmose in the heading of the recipe), while the text gives it as Appill- moisse, and the Index AppUmosse. This latter is probably the most correct form of all— the mosse being the same word as the Fr: mousse, e.g. mousse de jambon. It is not the same word as Appul moy, or moyle, for which recipes exist.—J.

lxx INTRODUCTION. “ Upon this a tumult was made, and the Preacher was threatened. One was for bringing him down, as he said, with arrows and javelins. And presently there was heard a clattering of weapons under him, so that he looked for present death. Yet those that were next him under the tree were quiet, and none of them made the least stir or murmur against him, but rather defended him. Then Conyers, to divert the mischief, fell to singing the Te Deum, whereat the rabble was composed into some quiet, which gave opportunity to the Preacher to convey himself away.” Next day, however, at St. Clement’s Church we find that he “ again spake against these wicked hurly burlies ”—before returning to Cambridge. The year 1544 was marked with good fortune for Corpus Christi College, of which Parker was a Fellow, for he was then, on the recommendation of King Henry VIII, appointed Master, and “to this College he was ever after an extraordinary friend and benefactor.” The following year he was made Rector of Landbeach, near Cambridge. As soon as he became master of his old College Parker devoted great care to the setting in order of the neglected library, whence some of the precious chained books had been borrowed and not returned, and the contents were in great disorder. His unceasing care of the library only ended at his death. As at Stoke College so at Corpus Christi one of Parker’s first works was to set the accounts in order, and “the account books are still in existence which, written by his own hand, are living attestations of his accuracy,” says Dean Hook.

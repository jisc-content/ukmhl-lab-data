Proper Terms : An attempt at a rational explanation of the meanings of the Collection of Phrases in The Boole of St. Albans, 1486, entitled “ Companys of Beestys and Fowlys,” and similar Lists by John Hodgkin, F.L.S., F.I.C., F.C.S. Member of the Folk Lore Society. [Supplement to the Transactions of the Philological Society, 1907-10. B.M.; R. Ac. 9930/3.] I record this valuable and exhaustive paper among those of interest regarding A Proper newe Booke of Cokerye, because of the great variety of spellings recorded in it of the names of many of the various “Beestys and Fowlys” which appear in the foregoing pages, and the descriptive character of the ancient wordings regarding them. In Civannys, for instance, one does not immediately recognise swans, though in a Exaltacyon of larkys one seems to see and hear the lark mounting as he sings; and what can be more expressive than a Gagelynge of Gesse ?

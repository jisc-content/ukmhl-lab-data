Many of the world’s benefactors are unknown by name, so perhaps we may ask for a tiny niche in the Temple of Fame for the man or woman who compiled this little kitchen guide. As to date, we get at that approximately from the fact that the tracts bound up with it range from 1548 to 1572; and this copy must probably have been earlier than either of the editions of the same hook (dated respectively 1575 and 1576) which are in the British Museum; for Archbishop Parker, to whom the Cambridge copy belonged, died in 1575.

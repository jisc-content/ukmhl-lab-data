Clymmeth hye; to dim (said of apeacock), is, Halliwell says, to call or challenge, and peacocks certainly utter their cry constantly before rain. [ I have looked up this in Palsgrave and feel quite sure in my own mind that Halliwell is mistaken. Palsgrave mentions the word as having been used by Lydgate in the sense of to claym, i.e. claim (probably pronounced like the word climb); and Halliwell evidently derives his definition from the fact that Palsgrave mentions the word as meaning, to claim a thing; or, to challenge anyone else’s right to it. I believe it to mean that when the peacock climbeth high (i.e. in the trees) that is a token of rain.—J. H.] (See also under Peacock.

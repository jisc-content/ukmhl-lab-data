XXXIX INTRODUCTION. the wall behind is decorated with a design of stars, probably a kind of fresco, gold stars perhaps on a blue ground. Each guest has a knife (but no spoon nor fork), a platter and a piece of bread, and there are various things on the table, which may be salt cellars, and several cups and flagons, but there is not one cup for each person. The Brass shows the moment when the “ hotte peacockes ” are brought in on gold dishes by the fair ladies, one at each end of the scene, escorted by musicians playing on the crwth (Welsh harp), lute, trumpets, &c. The birds have their crests on but no “ fedurs,” so perhaps they were gilded; two long skewers (?) which are shown sticking in the birds, may have been intended to hold by, to facilitate carving—in the absence of forks, which were not yet used, A kneeling page is offering a dish to one guest, while another page is springing over the table, one leg already thrown across it, a perilous position one would think in which to receive so large a dish! For cooking the peacock, here is a recipe of 1381, and no doubt the same methods prevailed till Elizabeth’s time : “ At a feste Rialle pecokkes schalle be dighte on this manere take and flee of tho Skynne withe tho fedurs tayle and tho nekke and tho hed ther on then take tho Skyn withe al tho fedurs and lay hit on a table abrode and strawe ther on grounden commyn then take tho pecok and roste hym and *endore hym withe Rawe zolkes of # “Endore,” to make of a bright golden colour by brushing over with raw yolks of eggs.—(J.H.) Halliwell gives the same meaning, but adds that the word did not mean gilded, “ as explained in the Glossary of Syr Gawayne.”

XVII INTRODUCTION. hawking cry (the modern version of which is “ Hoohahn ”) raised by falconers when the quarry is sighted and before slipping at the quarry; “hafoc” being the Anglo-Saxon word for hawk. The second point of interest is on the authority of Stow’s Survey of London, 1598; he says: “It was in the reign of Henry VIII. that the royal hawks were removed from the ‘ Mews ’ at Charing Cross (Mews being the place where hawks are set down to moult)—where they had been kept many reigns, and the places were con- verted into stables. The name, however, . . . . remained to the building, although, after the hawks were withdrawn, it became inapplicable. But what is more curious still, in later times, when the people of London began to build stables at the backs of their houses, they christened these places ‘ Mews,’ after the old stables at Charing Cross.” Curiously enough, as these words are going to press I come across an article in the Pall Mall Gazette, headed:— “ PASSING of the old-time stables,” which (condensed) says : “ Since the advent of motor vehicles, and the rapid disappearing of the horse from our streets, the mews of London are fast being converted to other purposes than that of stabling horses. “ The name mews comes through the French of encouragement to a hawk when loosed upon its prey, that the word was the Anglo-Saxon form, of which the Scandinavian was hawk.” The New English Dictionary tells us that to give an army the order “havoc! ” was the signal for the seizure of spoil; and that an old military order of 1386 (Richard II’s time) says : “ Que nul soit so hardy de crier havok sur peine davoir la teste coupe.” B

It is more likely that they had recourse to these decorations in cooking the sober -plumaged peahen. The honour of serving it was reserved for the ladies most distinguished for birth, rank, or beauty; one of them, followed by the others, and attended by music, carried in the peacock on a gold or silver dish, and set it before the master of the house, or the guest most distinguished for his courtesy and valour; or, after a tournament, before the victorious knight, who took an oath of valour and enterprise on its head* and who had to display his skill in carving the “ favourite bird.” The Romance of Launcelot, we are told, represents King Arthur performing this office to the satisfaction of 500 guests; how many peacocks he had thus to dispose of, I cannot say. Holinshed is the authority as to the pea- cock having been the favourite dish of Pope Julius III., and he gives the following amusing, if not edifying, anecdote to prove it:—“ At another time he (the Pope) sitting at dinner, pointing to a peacocke upon his table which he had * Mrs. Markham mentions that at a banquet given by Philip the Good, preparatory to going on a crusade to the Holy Land, a roasted pheasant was brought in, and carried round to each person present. The Duke first vowed by the pheasant to combat with the infidels till death ; and after him all at table made similar vows. Sometimes, she says, a live peacock took the place of the pheasant.” [Both Mrs. Markham and Warner are mistaken; it was always a live, not a roasted bird; see Gibbons’ Beeline and Fall, Smith’s Ed:, vol: VIII., p. 183, and Swainson’s Folk Lore of Brit: Birds p. 171, &c. ; Polk Lore Soc : 1885.—J.H.]

Some friends be not secret. Blaze they will, to win credit. Now or never we must set out a good countenance. And surely, so I comfort such faithful as come lamentably dejected to me.” “Now,” says Strype, “the great labour was to open the Queen’s eyes, and to make her apprehend her danger from the Papists,” who “had secret fautors (aiders) within the palace walls, and were slyly encouraged by some persons who outwardly pretended otherwise. And they were very confident, and well stored with armour . . . and some would not spare to utter their rejoices and to say that of long time they looked for such slaughter at home.” The Archbishop was in special apprehension for the Queen’s safety, as she was in a Progress and Burghley with her.

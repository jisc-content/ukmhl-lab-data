INTRODUCTION. lxxvii of Edward Vlth, out of the ancient writers of our nation and the Saxon Chronologies, and some of the allegations are set down in the Saxon tongue.” This question of the marriage of Priests intimately affected Parker himself. The Statute of Six Articles promulgated by Henry VIII had included one for- bidding priests to marry, but this Statute was at once repealed when Edward VI came to the throne, and King Edward’s decree was approved in the Lower House of Convocation. It was almost imme- diately after this approval by Convocation that Parker married Margaret Harlestone. But King Edward’s laws were themselves repealed by Queen Mary, and “the Edwardine Statute sanctioning clerical marriage,” says Ken- nedy, “had not been revived when Elizabeth suc- ceeded her on the throne,* owing no doubt to Elizabeth’s well-known objections, and this injunc- tion continued in working order at least till the middle of the reign.” Queen Elizabeth had personally a rooted dislike to the marriage of the clergy, as well as to that of her courtiers, which latter seems always to have offended her. In this matter of clerical mar- riage she was singularly perverse, and on one occasion when the Archbishop went to see her, she “ took occasion to speak in that bitterness # According to Sir Simon Degge, King Edward’s laws “lay repealed all Queen Elizabeth’s days till the first of King James, and then the latter Acts of King Edward were revived and made perpetual ’ ’; one result of the repealed laws being that when Margaret Parker died, her brother was considered her heir, though he very honourably passed on her property, chiefly that given her by her husband, to her children. This matter of the repealed laws no doubt accounts for, though it does not justify, Queen Elizabeth’s historical remark to the Archbishop’s wife, when the latter was her hostess.

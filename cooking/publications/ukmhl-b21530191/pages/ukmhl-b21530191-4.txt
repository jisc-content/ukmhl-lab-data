BY THE SAME AUTHOR. The Cookery Book of Lady Clark of Tillypronie ; Edited by Catherine Frances Frere. London. Constable. 6/- net. “ This volume is as unlike the conventional, complicated, and to the general reader extremely dull, modern cookery book, as a peacock’s finest tail feather is unlike a barn-door fowl’s. . . . We should say that almost any housewife, whether she requires what is called high-class cookery or simple fare, could profit a great deal by the study of this extremely delightful book.”—Westminster Gazette. “ After giving a number of very useful and very good recipes for cakes, confectionery and curries, the collection pro- ceeds to sections containing fish, game, jams, jellies, meat paste and pastry, poultry, sauces, puddings and sweet dishes. ... It is one of the most interesting and generally useful cookery books which we have had occasion to review for a very long time.”—The British Baker. “A distinctly original cookery book which ought to be in the hands of every housewife.”—Sheffield Daily Telegraph, '• A book which all beginners should study, a goal of excellence towards which they should direct their ambitions.” The Ladies Field. “ The Cookery Book of Lady Clark of Tillypronie will probably take its place as a standard work.”—Daily Telegraph. “ The recipes are undoubtedly of immense value and in- terest to all who have anything to do with culinary matters.”— Glasgow Herald.

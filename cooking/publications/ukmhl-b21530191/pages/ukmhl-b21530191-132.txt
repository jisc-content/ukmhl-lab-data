INTRODUCTION. CXXV1 and many others “looked upon Mary the Queen of Scots to he the chief cause of this audacity of the Papists ”; and the fact that Queen Elizabeth with her “princely heart” was “void of all fear of any harm from Papists,” was a “great anxiety to the wise men about her.” The Vidam of Chartres, John de Ferriers, one of the chief French Protestant nobles, a man of learning, wrote to Burghley regarding the massacre, at which time the Duke of Guise had followed him to his house to murder him; he hid, and having procured the King’s safeguard (granted as they supposed he would go to his house and they could catch him there), he “deceived the deceiver,” for he “got safe on ship board and so came to England” where he wrote to Burghley (7th September) as soon as he arrived. This French nobleman feared the Queen would not sufficiently resent the massacre “ nor deal with the French King in that openess and plainess that so false and base an act deserved to he treated by all neighbour princes.” “He could not doubt, he told Burghley, “that the very remem- brance of it created an horror in her, but he feared that by speaking more mildly concerning it she might add courage to those boasters, as observing how the neighbour princes dared not so much as once to mutter.” He added that “those butcherly men . . . would not grow more gentle by a few light words, but ... be more and more insolent . . . and the judgment that the world had of them was not to be discovered to them by bare words, but that there was need of action; that they might see there were not mere words, but minds prepared to do something.”

9925. 80. U.L.C.; L.N. 2. 30. BIBLIOGRAPHY. I give below the titles of works consulted by me at the British Museum, the University Library at Cambridge, and elsewhere, when editing this book, or such as are referred to in it; not only for their individual interest, but because, for lack of space, it was only possible to note them in the text with initials, or by their author’s names. I have added, where possible, the Catalogue references (as used 1912-13) of those in the Biitish Museum and in the University Library at Cam- bridge—marked respectively B.M. and U.L.C. with a view to save future students as much as possible of the trouble of hunting through Catalogues, which absorbs so much of a reader’s time.

INTRODUCTION. clxiv bishop Parker, taking our leave of him as one of the best deservers, in this our island, of religion, learning, antiquity, of his country and of the Church of England, triumphant at last over the malice of • all his ill willers.” To Englishmen of the XXth Century it is cheering to realise that storms, which must have then seemed as threatening as any we have encountered, were weathered nearly 400 years ago by honest and courageous men in both Church and State. They, standing on the strong rock of Scripture against overwhelming odds, were not to be terrified by the craftiness nor the power of their assailants, and came out triumphant. But before we close this chapter and turn to the study of the homely Cookery book itself, we would, with Strype, lay a wreath on the graves of its first owners, Matthew Parker and Margaret Parker, his wife, thanking God for the example of their lives—the fortitude of a fearless English- man, the devoted home life of his wife. As for ourselves, let us take courage from their experience of the past to face in their spirit whatever of good or ill may be in store for our native Country, and look forward undismayed.

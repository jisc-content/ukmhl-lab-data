He had supported the rebel Earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland in a revolt in the North “ by letters, emissaries, and sinews of war”; and early in 1570 he proceeded to excommunicate the Queen, an act, as Kennedy reminds us, which at once altered the situation from a religious question into one of loyalty or disloyalty to the throne. The Parliament of England immediately responded by passing severe measures, and declared it to he high treason to bring into the kingdom, or to publish, any printed bulls or absolutions. “ It was Elizabeth or the Pope.

The spelling of the same word even varies several times on the same page; spelling was not yet crystallised, and the recipes quite give the impression of having been written down by a practical cook, who did not stop to verify spelling from any dictionary, and who depended on memory for measurements and proportions; for the quantities of each ingredient are rarely stated with the detail and exactness a modern cook would demand.

Of these the 1575 edition was “ imprinted at London

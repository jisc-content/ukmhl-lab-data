The Family Receipt Book, or Universal Repository of useful knowledge and experience in all the various Branches of Domestic Economy. Published by Oddy and Co., London. The nameless editor says he was first inspired by an heir- loom recipe book, and, helped by “ friendly coadjutors,” collected every book or manuscript he could, and recorded “the recent Communications of intelligent Travellers,” until “ this Collection of Useful Receipts, whatever may be its wants or imperfections, is,” he modestly asserts, “ without a parallel in any part of the World.” It certainly is most comprehensive, for it includes not only cookery and household recipes, but such things as “The Duchess of Marlborough’s Admirable Water for the Thickening of the Hair,” and “ Negro Caesar’s Famous Cure for Poison and for the Bite of a Rattle Snake, by the Discovery of which he obtained his Freedom and a Hundred Pounds a year for Life.” B.M.; 7953. 1. 20. (? 1820). The Forme op Cury. A Roll of ancient English Cookery compiled about 1390, by the master-cooks of King Richard II. Presented

li INTRODUCTION. seem always to be of minced meat or fish (beef, mutton, veal, eel or oysters are men- tioned) mixed with spices, yolks of eggs, raisins, ginger, mace, dates, &c., and first parboiled, then baked in pastry—as one recipe expresses it: “ and so put them in coffins”—a sort of fresh mincemeat, but with other meat than suet. Another recipe for them I find in The Good Huswives Handmaid: “Take a little veale and slice it and parboile it, then take it up and presse it in a faire cloth and mince it very fine, take corans and dates and cut them very small, take some marie or suet and the yolkes of three or foure egges and pepper, salt and mace fine beaten, and the crums of bread fine grated, the mingle all these together and put in suet enough and they will be good pies.” (Faire, clean; marie, marrow; toile, see Gloss:) For “Baken Lamprey,” mentioned in the second course of “ Service for Fyshe Dayes,” John Russell, in The Babee’s Booh, gives in rhyme a recipe to serve Lampreys which had been first baked in a pastry “ coffin ” : “ Open the pastey lid, ther in to have a sight, Take then white bred thyn y-kut and lizt, Lay hit in a chargere dische or plater ryght, With a spone then take owt the gentille galantyne,” (which was laid on the slices of bread)— “ Then take powdur of synamome and temper hit with red wyne, The same wold plese a pore man y suppose welle and fyne; Mynse ye the gobyns as thyn as a grote, Than lay them vppon youre galantyne stondynge on a chaffire hoote ; ” {i.e. which is standing on a hot chafing dish)

clxi INTRODUCTION. tru.G quality of an English Archbishop, was as remarkable as its master, for it consisted of “little less than one hundred persons,” besides the servants left at Lambeth; and “ he had within his walls,” as we know, many experienced artisans and artists, including good engravers, besides his permanent staff and officials, many chaplains and learned men, “foreigners as well as others,” whom he entertained, “so that his housekeeping must needs he great and splendid, in that he had such a large family to provide for.” The number of the Archbishop’s household was added to, from time to time, by some of the deprived clergy who had been prisoners in the Tower, and whom the Queen committed to his care. Such were Thirleby, formerly Bishop of Ely, who lived at Bekesbourne and Lambeth alto- gether some seven years; and Boxall, who had been Dean of Windsor; and “ each of them one man allowed.” Parker seems always to have treated them as honoured guests, “in all courteous and gentle manner.” A very friendly letter exists, written by the Archbishop to Thirleby, who had apologised for coming as “an unbidden guest”; in it Parker assures him of welcome, and describes the best route to take from London. Boxall, after some time, removed to Bromley, and wrote on leaving to thank the Archbishop “for my very good entertainment, which so long time without desert your Grace exhibited to me . . . which I do acknowledge, and most heartily wish I were able by any means to declare myself mindful of it.” Such were two of the men whom Strype says the Romanists represented as “ miser- able prisoners.”

They were added in far larger quantities than we could tolerate; cinnamon and saffron especially were mixed with the most unlikely ingredients, the latter chiefly for colouring. It may not be generally known that Saffron Walden takes its name from the cultivation of saffron, as Linton does from the growing of flax. Such a mixture as

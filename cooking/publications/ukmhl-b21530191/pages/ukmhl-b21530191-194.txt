NOTES. 22 Overboj/led, to boil so cts to overflow the pot. Sodden, i.e, boiled. A Custarde the Coffyn, meaning the coffin or crust for a “custarde” (see p. 6). Coffin is the mould of paste for a pie (Sir K. Digbig). Coffyn, the raised crust of pie (Halliwell). Coffyns, pies with or without lids; a quill was often inserted in these wherewith to blow up the top crust. (Noble Booke of Cookryj “The Good Huswives Handmaid for Cookerie in her kitchen (1588j gives the following recipe: “To make paste and to raise coffins ”—which sounds gruesome—“ Take fine flour and lay it on a boord and take a certaine” (lquantity' understoodJ “of yolkes of egges as” (i.e. in proportion to ivhat) “your quantitie of flower is, then take a certain of Butter and water and boile them together but you must take heed ye put not too many yolkes of e99es> for if you doe it will make it dry and not pleasant in eating, and ye must take heed ye put not in too much Butter, for if you doe, it ivill make it so fine and so short that you cannot raise (it): and this paste is good to raise all manner of coffins; likewise if ye bake veneson, bake it in the paste above named.” “ Long Coffins ” were pies without lids (Warner). “Put into the Coffin butter,” d-c. This means, I think, in materials used for crust. “ Fayre,” clean.

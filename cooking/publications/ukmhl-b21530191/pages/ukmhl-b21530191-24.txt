INTRODUCTION. XV111 muer from Latin mutare, to change, a term originally applied to the moulting of a hawk or falcon, and later to the caging of the birds while they muted or changed their feathers. Hence the term ‘to mew up.’ “Ralph de Manners, the King’s falconer, had the custody of the King’s mews at Charinge, in Edward III.’s reign; as also Sir Simon de Burley in that of Richard II. Henry VIII. is said to have kept his horses there, and the old structure was afterwards enlarged and converted into stabling by Edward VI. and Mary. “At the Royal Mews at Charing Cross, the Royal hawks were kept from 1377 to 1537, when the building became the Royal stables. When the present Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace were built the original mews were turned into barracks and finally disappeared in the early forties of the last century to make room for street improvements.” Some modern methods of acquiring game do not compare favourably with hawking. Here is an extract from an actual advertisement lately received from abroad:— “I herwith take pleasure to inform you that the Catching of Partridges will begin next week so that I am able to supply you at present with best fresh-caught Hungarian Partridges. “I have contracts with the Estates of Count Z , Count E , Count M , Count P , &c., whose game is known as the strongest of Hungary & Bohemia. “I am sending thausands of Partridges every season to America and the fact that only 5 to 7% dy during the 2 week’s journey is proof for the good quality of my birds.

GLOSSARY-INDEX. ill cxi Utterly, entirely, thoroughly Trypes (to stewe) in claret Turbutte, turbot, for fyshe clayes (see also Brette) Turnsole blue, a rich violet or purple colour obtained from Archil (or Orchil), a lichen, used for dyeing. The name was given to keep its true source a secret. (Cent: Diet:) Turnsole, for colouring jellye, &c. Some say turnsole is turmeric (yellow); others, that it is croton tinctorum (red), while the index to Babee’s Book says the turnsole used was not the flower of heliotropium but a drug. [The Turnesole meant in the Recipe is the heliotrope. The plant was called Heliotropium tricoccum, or Turnesole, and used to grow plentifully in many parts of Holland. “ This plant, which we call Turnesole, the Greeks call Heliotropion, the Sun Flower, because its flower always turns to the sun. It bears Berries, always three set together, not much unlike the Palma Christi, whence it is called by Pliny, Heliotropium Tricoccum, the Turnsole with three Berries; which when they are at their full maturity, have within them, between the outward skin and the Kernel or Seed, a certain Juice or Moisture, which being rubb’d upon Paper or Cloth, at first appears of a fresh and lively Green Colour, but presently changes into a kind of bluish purple, and the same Cloth, afterwards wet in water or White Wine, and wrung forth, will strike the said Water or Wine a red or Claret Wine Colour; and these are the Rags or Cloth which are the true Turnsole, and ought to be sold in the Druggists’ Shops, wherewith People Colour Gellies, Conserves, Tinctures, &c: as they please, as also to Colour all Sorts of Spirits and the like, that have of themselves no colour.”—Pomet’s Hist: of Drugs, 1748, p. 26.—J.

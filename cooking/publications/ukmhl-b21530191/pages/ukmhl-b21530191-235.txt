GLOSSARY-INDEX. 63 PAGE I should like to note Professor Harnack’s words, as quoted in The Bible in the World, Jan : 1913, from the translation (recently published) of his book, Bible Beading in the Early Church. He says: “‘According to the present teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, Holy Scripture is the property of the Church as a body, and she—i.e. in the last instance, the Pope— is bound ... to determine how and in what measure Holy Scripture is to be made accessible to the individual Christian . this claim of the Roman Catholic Church is an innovation. Neither in the first three centuries nor in the fourth was the Bible in any sense subordinate to the Church ; . . . we cannot discover any authoritative episcopal ordinance restricting laymen in their reading of the Bible. . . . The Bible belongs to the individual in the same sense as it belongs to the Church. . . . Protestantism has thus the testimony of the Early Church on its side in not allowing the Church to dictate the relations between the individual and Holy Scripture.’ Thus,” adds the Editor, “Dr. Harnack emphatically endorses the view that the Reformation, in placing the Bible in the hands of every Christian layman, only returned to the simple confidence of the primitive Church ” Biefe, to stew bones and gristells of - Bilney, burnt at the stake lxvi 53 lxiv Biographer (Archbishop Parker’s), John Strype - hi, clxiii, &c.

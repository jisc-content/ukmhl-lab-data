GLOSSARY-INDEX. 70 Damask Water, the most delicate rosewater made from Damask (Damascus) roses. Damaske, or sweet water, was also the name of a water made from all sorts of odoriferous herbs. Damask roses were prized for their delicious scent, and The Good Houswives Treamrie (1588) has a delightful recipe headed “ How to make very swete cakes either of Damaske or of red roses ’' which would be worth trying; the “cakes” were kept to scent linen in drawers and cupboards. It is as follows : “ Take your Roses very faire coloured and somewhat close ” (P not opened out too much); “if you will make your cakes large, take a pecke of Roses to every Cake, or half a pecke, and put two cakes to- gether, bottom to bottom, and put into every cake besides two handfull of sweet Margerum rootes and all, for at that time of yere cut Margerum is not sweet, cut of the rootes of sweet Margerum, and two good handful of lavender and an ounce of the best Damaske powder you can get, a quarter of a pound of orris and one ounce of Cloves, let not the cloves or the orris be beaten much; when you do searce (sieve or sift) your orris see it be not worm eaten and smell wet. All this powder will serve for but foure cakes; straw into your still some Roses firste in the bottom, then Margerum, Lavender, and some (Damask) powder and then Roses againe and a little powder, then Lavender and Margerum, more powder than you did before, then put a few Roses in the top somewhat thin(ly). Whe they be half stilled take them fourthe and laye them betwixt two papers and laye not one Cake against another before they be colde; then saue (save) them in papers and cut the papers bigger than ye Cakes and sewe them round, as soon as you can put them into an oven no hotter than if it were after Pyes or Cakes, and let them stay no longer the a day or a night; then take them out and when they be cold lay them betwixt your clothes, and if they be not drye then set them in (? to the oven) again a week or a fortnight (? later), and after they be through drye prick the papers on both sides unto the brim everywhere thicke(ly). These cakes will continue (good) three or foure yeare” - Damsons (tarte of) - PAGE 36, 43 39

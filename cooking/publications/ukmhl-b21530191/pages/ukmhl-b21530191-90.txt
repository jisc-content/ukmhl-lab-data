INTRODUCTION. lxxxiv called in different degrees to guide the destinies of a people through circumstances of almost unique difficulty.” Six months were allowed Matthew Parker after his nomination, to prepare for his new high office, and he was consecrated Archbishop in “Lambhith Chapel,” 17 Dec., 1559. Very full particulars exist of every detail of this ceremony of his consecra- tion, and Strype devotes minute care to giving the fullest description of it; this being “one of the great and primary acts of the Reformation, in the constituting of an orthodox and able Metropolitan, since it was the ground on which stood the validity of the rest of the consecrations and ordinations of the succeeding Bishops and clergy of this Church; and likewise since this very matter hath been, with so much ridicule, malice, and falsehood, repre- sented by divers later Popish writers; as though the consecration of this Archbishop and other his fellow Bishops, were performed at a tavern.” But there was “Not one word in those days,” says Strype, “of a Nag’s Head Ordination.”* Every * Dean Hook, in his Lives of the Archbishops of Canterbury, gives a very full description of Archbishop Parker’s Consecration, entirely refuting the Nag’s Head legend, which was, he says, first promulgated in Antwerp by an exiled Romanist priest; he also quotes at length the complete refutation of it written to the Birmingham Catholic Magazine in 1834, by Dr. Lingard, a Roman Catholic. Dean Hook also mentions that to Archbishop Parker’s kinsman, the Earl of Nottingham, himself a Romanist, and present at the Consecration, we are indebted for many interesting particulars of the ceremonial. Kennedy, in his Life of Archbishop Parker, reminds us that Dom Birt, the Roman Catholic historian, equally rejects the “ludicrous Story’’ and seriatim confutes all other objections which have been brought forward to the validity of Archbishop Parker’s Consecration, and which have been shifted, as is usual in such matters, as each objection was met and negatived.

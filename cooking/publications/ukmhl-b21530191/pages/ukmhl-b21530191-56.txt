INTRODUCTION. ] “The third evening in the river—A dragon” (a compliment probably to the Tudor emblem) “ as big as an ox, which will fly twice or thrice as high as the tower of St. Paul’s, and at that height will burn away, and suddenly will issue from its whole body dogs, cats and birds, which will scatter fire on all sides. There will be many other things in these fireworks impossible to describe in writing.” Mr. Killigrew in his letter also explains that all these glories “ will ask two months work,” and “the charges will draw to £50, which sum he desires not to have in his own hands but that he may receive it by £4 or £5 at a time.” With regard to wines, the very names are different to what modern cellars produce—with the exception of “Claret wyne,” or “Clarry”; but even this, as it was made with honey and aromatic spices, was not like modern Claret; and we no longer lay in Rumney, Osey, nor Malmesey, nor do we mix the favourite Tudor drink of Ipocras. We shall notice that our little Cookery Book gives the names of many dishes for which it records no recipe. I have traced recipes for some of these in other early books, and they will be found in the Notes: others are also worth mentioning, such as the following for “Chuettes or pyes.” In our book they are said to be “of fyne mutton,” but in The Nolle Boke of Cookery is a recipe for “Chewettes of beef”: “ To make chewettes of beef, tak beef and cutt it small and do thereto pouder of giunger, clowes and other pouders, grapes, vergius, saffron and salt, and toile them well togedure put chekins chopped in coffins and yolkes of eggs brok smale and hak them and serve them.” Chewetts

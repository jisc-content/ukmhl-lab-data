NOTES. 54 Sparowes were much eaten. “ The Good Hus- wives Handmaid ” gives a very “ tasty dish ” of stewed sparrows: “ Take of your mutton broth the best and put it in a pipkin and put to it a little whole mace, whole pepper, claret wine, marigold leaves, Barberies, Rosewater, vergious, sugar and marrow, or else sweet butterFirst parboil the birds in plain water, then you “ boyle them in the same broth and lay them upon soppes.” The late Sir Henry Peek once described a “ game pie ” which he had had, and bade us guess the ingredients. As he kept emus and many foreign creatures in his beautiful park at Wimbledon, we suggested some of these, but no guess was right. He then explained that his gardener had shot six or eight predatory sparrows with one charge of small shot, and these were the “game." In the pie each bird was placed on bacon and each bit of bacon on an oyster—the result, he said, was excellent! I offer the suggestion and both recipes to Sparroiv Clubs. Wardens, large baking pears much used in pies; Winter pears (Sir K. Digby). Romney, a wine. (See Gloss:) Wyll be kepte, i.e. will keep. Barke, i.e. skin of the fruit.

INTRODUCTION. xxiii The amount of dishes prepared in old days for feasts was stupendous. At the “ Stallacion of Archbishop Neville in 1467, a hundred years before our little book, “Muttons 1,000” were consumed together with “ Pygges 2,000,” and other things in proportion, including “ Porposes and Seales 12. It means, no doubt, that the town, or perhaps the county, was fed for a week. An even greater hospitality was exercised in the East in earlier days when King Solomon, at the Dedication of the Temple, sacrificed “two and twenty thousand oxen and 120,000 sheep.” We are told “at that time Solomon held a feast and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt . . . seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.” Nowadays faddists complain of such “ slaughter ” of animals. But, after all, your feast must be in proportion to your company — though the mind reels at the vast scale of the catering required if you entertain “all Israel” for fourteen days. Even a faddist, if he be also a book collector, may comfort himself with the reflection that the benefit to the world in general of “1,000 Muttons” or “2,000 Pygges” does not end in the cooking-pot; for where would old books have been without skins that they could be written on, and hides to bind them in ? We do not, it is true, think of sheep, pigs and calves as a literary race, but they are well represented in most libraries, and their sacrifices in the cause of litera- ture have been immense — for which, how- ever, they must be content to be their own monument.

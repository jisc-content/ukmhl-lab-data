The eggs should not be overbeaten, sparingly seasoned. The garnish is added either in the beaten eggs as for Aux fines lierbes, or folded in the omelette previous to turning it out on the dish, or else placed in the centre of the ready omelette by an incision cut on top a few inches lengthwise, as occasion requires. In some cases a little cream is added to the beaten eggs.

PART X. SALADES VARlEES. Salad making of modern times is a special art of the kind and requires a careful attention and delicacy of taste. The variety of dressed or made salads is enormous; they are often served as a separate course, and some of the varieties are sometimes served as hors d’ceuvres either in small glass dishes or raviers. Adeline—Cooked salsify, tomatoes and cucumbers, and mayonnaise. Allemande — Salted cucumbers, potatoes, apples, onions, hard eggs, beetroot, and smoked or salted herrings. Alsacienne.—Consists of large dice of cooked new potatoes, pickles, and coarsely shredded lettuce round, decorated with sliced cooked Frankfort sausages, French salad dressing over. Americaine I.—Sliced potatoes, tomatoes, celery, spring onions, and green peppers, highly seasoned. Americaine II.—Dice of potatoes, beetroot, tongue, and anchovies, mustard and cress round. Andalouse — Quarters of tomatoes, red peppers (pimento), rice, chopped onions, and flavour of garlic.

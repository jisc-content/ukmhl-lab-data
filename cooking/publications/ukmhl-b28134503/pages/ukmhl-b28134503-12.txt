X Principles of Cookery. Venturing a remark on the two main constituents of entrees and sauces—good wine and good butter— it is often assumed that, for cooking purposes, wine of an inferior quality may be used; and one cannot protest too strongly against this mistaken idea— the wine used should be of good aroma and body, without which successful cooking is impossible. The same remarks apply to good butter; with bad butter it is impossible to make anything good.

The greatest and cleverest chef in the world cannot produce palatable food without the best of provisions and materials.

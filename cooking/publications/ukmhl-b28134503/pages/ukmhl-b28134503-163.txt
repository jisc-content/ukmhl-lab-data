For cooking large fish, three courtbouillon or fish stock are used: (1) The ordinary, consisting of water and vinegar; (2) Water and white wine in equal quantity ; (3) Water and red wine or claret in equal quantity. In each case the stock is seasoned and flavoured with sliced onion and carrot, herbs and spices, and simmered before cooking the fish in it. When the fish is intended for cold it should be allowed to remain in the stock till cold. In cooking small fish or fillets, supreme, etc., the term sauteed is used, poached, or au four ; the first meaning that the fish is floured and sauteed, or fried, in a little butter and oil, meuniere style, and turned over to complete the cook- ing. The term poached is more general in use, the fish is placed in a fireproof fish-dish with sliced onion, parsley, white wine or fish stock, pats of butter and seasoned, covered with buttered paper, and slowly cooked in the oven with occasional basting; for the term au four (or baked) the fish is placed on a well- buttered dish, covered with greased paper, and cooked slowly as the case requires, and basted.

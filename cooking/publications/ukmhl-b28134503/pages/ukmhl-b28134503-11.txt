IX Principles of Cookery. same principles apply to sauteed fillets, tournedos, noisettes, etc. A fork should never be used in turning steaks, chops, etc., which pierces the coating and allows the juice to escape. In preparing fish for frying it should be perfectly cleaned, seasoned, floured and egged and bread- crumbed ; or, as in some cases, floured only, or, again, dipped in batter (pate a frire), as occasion requires. In all cases placed in very hot fat, or dripping, or oil, or clarified butter, to entirely cover the fish, carefully drained and served. For grilling fish it is first seasoned as above, floured, dipped in or moistened with oiled butter or oil, and placed on the not too hot grill. Dressed fish, either filleted or otherwise, is either poches (poached), or aufour (baked), or sauteed, or meuniere style. Large fish for boiling are preferably placed in cold water, stock, or court-bouillon ; there are, however, some cooks who prefer cooking salmon when whole by placing it in boiling liquid. One of the most complicated branches of cookery is entree-making and made-up dishes, with its endless variety, and it is still on the increase. Thus the standard principle of such is often altered or disregarded, as occasion may arise. Full details of hundreds of high-class modern and light entrees are dealt with under their headings.

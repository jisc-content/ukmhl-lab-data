70 The New Practical Cookery Guide. cooked in the game stock, the game used having been previously partly roasted or braised. The whole, when done, is pounded, reheated, and strained ; wine should be added, sherry or marsala, claret or port. For fish soups or purees the old process of thicken- ing (panade), which is French bread broken in pieces and simmered in milk to a smooth paste, is now often substituted by a roux or fish veloute. In either case a proportionate quantity of the fillet of fish should be reserved in the raw state first, pounded with a little cream, and added to the soup a few minutes before the final straining, finished with cream lastly. Creams.â€”Creams differ from the veloute by the V fact that stock is substituted for milk, or partly so, according to the constituents of the soup prepared, and thickened bv the addition of bechamel sauce, finished with cream. A great number of auxiliaries, soups, or potages, are made by the combination of the different elements mentioned, and with careful blending of two or more purees, or creams, etc., an endless variety of delicious soups are obtained. In all cases the point is to follow the technical nature of each element used, and to combine them accordingly with care and clehcacy of taste. Herewith are over four hundred varieties of selected thick soups. The garnish is described on a standard scale, and should be added sparingly, as thick soups require less than consomme ; croutons (sippets), in most cases, are served separate.

The most familiar way of carving a partridge is to carry the knife sharply along the top of the breast of the bird and cut quite through, thus dividing it into two equal parts. An- other plan is to cut it into three pieces by serving a. small wing and leg on either side from the bodv, and the breast as the third portion. It is also carved by thrusting back the body from the legs entirely, and then cutting through the breast in the direction of the line A to B (Fig. 24).

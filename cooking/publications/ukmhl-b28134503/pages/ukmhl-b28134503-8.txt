VI Preface. To the hotel managers, restaurants, club stewards, caterers, etc., it will enable them at a glance to comply with everyday orders and requirements of modern times. To the chef, as an aide memoire and register, it renders the art of menu-making most easy; in the kitchen as well as in the dining-room it will be found a practical and reliable guide. Paper-bag cookery, not being considered of any practical use for large and important establishments, has been omitted.

204 The New Practical Cookery Guide. SAUCES. Fond Brun (Brown Stock). The making of sauces to perfection is the greatest art in cookery. It requires a thorough knowledge of all elements used, a practical and trained expe- rience, and great delicacy of the palate. Good stock should be prepared with care, of which there are several methods bv eminent chefs, as follows: 1. Place in a convenient size stewpan about 81b. of beef, 81b. of leg of veal, and one old hen, all cut in large squares (the breast of the fowl reserved for other use), two quarts of general stock as indicated in Part II., and boil on a brisk fire to reduce to glaze, stirring occasionally to allow the meat to get thoroughly browned. Great care must be taken not to let it burn. At this stage a sufficient quantity of general stock is added to completely cover the meat. Garnish with carrots, onions, and a bouquet. Allow to simmer about three hours, and strain. 2. Cover the bottom of a braising-pan with large squares of raw beef, veal, and ham, and a piece of clarified butter, sliced carrots, onions, thyme, bay- leaves, nutmeg, and fresh-ground pepper. Fry till golden brown over a sharp fire, stirring constantly, and then add sufficient general stock to entirely cover the meat. Carefully remove the fat as it rises to the surface. Allow about four hoursâ€™ simmering, and strain. 3. Place in a stewpan about 31b. of leg of veal and 21b. of raw ham, cut in large squares, two old part- ridges, two large carrots, two large onions, and 4oz.

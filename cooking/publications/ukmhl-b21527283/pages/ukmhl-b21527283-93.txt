17 FISH. EELS. S^itchcock Eels. Take one or two large eels, leave the skin on, cut them into pieces of three inches long, open them oii the belly side, and clean them nicely: wipe them dry, and then wet them with beaten egg, and strew over on both sides chopped parsley, pepper, salt, a very little sage, and a bit of mace pounded fine and mixed with the seasoning. Hub the gridiron with a bit of suet, and broil the fish of a fine colour. Serve with anchovy and butter for sauce. Fried Eels, If small, they should be curled round and fried, being first dipped into egg and crumbs of bread. Boiled Eels. The small ones are best; do them in a small quan- tity of water, with a good deal of parsley, which should be served up with them in the liquor. Serve chopped parsley and butter for sauce. Eel hroth, very nourishing for the sick. Do as above ; but stew two hours, and add an onion and pepper-corns; salt to taste. Collared Eel. Bone a large eel, but donâ€™t skin it: mix pepper, salt, mace, allspice, and a clove or two, in the finest powder, and rub over the whole inside; roll it tight, and bind it with a coarse tape. BoH in salt and water till enough, then add vinegar, and when cold keep the collar in pickle. Serve it either whole or in slices. Chopped sage, parsley, and a little thyme; knotte(^ marjoram, and savomy, mixed with the spices, greatly improve the taste. To stew Lamprey as at Worcester. After cleaning the fish carefully, remove the cartilage which runs down the back, and season with a small quantity of cloves, mace, nutmeg, pepper, and allspice;

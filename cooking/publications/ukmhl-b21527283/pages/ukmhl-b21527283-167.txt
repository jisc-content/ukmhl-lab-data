91' GAME, ETC. with salt. Have ready a large saucepan of boiling water, and plunge them into it one by one ; drawing them up and down by the legs, that the water may pass through them. Let them stay five or six minutes in ; then hang them up in a cold place. When drained, pepper and salt the insides well. Before roasting, wash them well. The most delicate birds, (even grouse), may be pre- served thus. Those that live by suction cannot be done this way, as they are never di-awn: and perhaps the heat might make them worse, as the water could not pass through them; but they bear being high. Lumps of charcoal put about birds and meat will preserve them from taint, and restore what is spoUing. l^heasants and Partridges. Boast them as timkey; and serve with a fine gravy (into which put a very small bit of garlick), and bread- sauce. When cold, they may be made into excellent patties, but their flavour should not be overpowered by lemon. For the manner of trussing a pheasant or partridge, see plate IX. To Pot Partridge. Clean them nicely; and season with mace, allspice, white pepper, and salt, in fine powder. Bub every part well; then lay the breast downwards in a pan, and pack the birds as close as you possibly can. Put a good deal of butter on them; then cover the pan with a coarse flour paste and a paper over, tie it close, and bake. AVhen cold put the birds into pots, and cover them witli butter. A very cheap way of Potting Birds. Prepare them as directed in the last receipt; and when baked and grown cold, cut them into proper pieces for helping, pack them close into a large potting- pot, and (if possible) leave no space to receive the butter. Cover them witlrbutter, and one third part less will be wanted than when the birds are done whole. The butter that has covered potted things will serve for basting, or for paste for meat pies.

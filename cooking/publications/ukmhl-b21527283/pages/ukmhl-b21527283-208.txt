DOMESTIC COOKERV, 132 Squab pie. Cut apples as for other pies, and lay them in rows with mutton-chops: shred onion, and sprinldc it among them, and also some sugar. Lamb pie. Make it of the loin, neck, or breast; the breast of house-lamb is one of the most delicate things that can be eaten. It should he very lightly seasoned with pep- per and salt; the bone taken out, but not the gristles; and a small quantity of jeUy-gravy be put in hot; but the pie should not be cut till cola. Put two spoon- fuls of water before baking. Grass lamb makes an excellent pie, and may either be honed or not, but not to bone it is perhaps the best. Season with only pepper and salt; put two spoonfuls of water before baking, and as much gravy when it comes from the oven. Hote.—Meat pies being fat, it is best to let out the gravy on one side, and put it in again by a funnel, at the centre, and a little may be added. Chicken pie. Cut up two young fowls; season with white pepper, salt, a little mace, and nutmeg, aU in the finest powder; likewise a little Cayenne. Put the chicken, slices of ham, or fresh gammon of bacon, forcemeat-balls, and hard eggs, by turns in layers. If it is to be baked in a dish, put a little water; but none if in a raised crust. By the time it returns from the oven, have ready a gravy of knuckle of veal, or a bit of the scrag with some shank bones of mutton, seasoned with herbs, onions, mace, and white pepper. If it is to be eaten hot, you may add truffles, morels, mushrooms, &c., but not if to be eaten cold. If it is made in a dish, put as much gravy as will fill it; but in raised crust the gravy must be nicely strained, and then put in cold as jeUy. To make the jeUy clear, you may give it a boil with the whites of two eggs, after taking away the meat, and then run it through a fine lawn sieve.

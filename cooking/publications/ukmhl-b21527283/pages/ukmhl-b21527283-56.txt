1 DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING. tho bird is not old. When the four quarters are thus removed, take off the merrythought froma, and the neck-bones; these lastby putting in the knife at e, and pressing it under the long broad part of the line 0,1; then lift it up, and break it off from the part that sticks to tho breast. The next thing is, to divide the breast from the carcase, by cut- ting through the tender ribs, close to the breast right down to the tail. Then lay the back upwards, put your knife into tho bone half way from the neck to the rump, and on raising the lower end it will sepa- rate readily. Turn the rump from you, and very neatly take off the two sidesmen, and the whole wiU be done. As each partis taken off it should be turned neatly on the dish, and care should be taken that what is left goes properly from table. The breast and wings ara looked upon as the best parts, but the legs are most juicy in young fowls. After all, more advantage will be gained by observing those who carv# well, and a little practice, than by any written directions whatever. Partridge.—The partridge is here represented as just taken from the spit; but, before it is served up the skewers must be mthdrawm. It is cut up in the same manner as a fowl. The wings must be taken off in the lines a, b, and the merrythought in the line c, d. The prime parts of a partridge are the wings, breast, and merrythought, but the bird being small, the two ktter are not often divided. The wing is considered the best, and the tip of it reckoned the most delicate mor- sel of the whole. PigeoM.—Cnt them in half, either from top to bottom or across. The lower part is generally thought the best; but the fairest way is to cut from tho neck to a, (See Plate No. 5) rather than from e to 6, by a, which is the most fashionable. The figure presents the back of the pigeon ; and the direction of the knife is in the line c, b, by a, if done the last way.

A pan and cover, or tu- reen, will preserve them long and moist.—Or, if to be crisp, laying them before the fire will make them so. Busks. Beat seven eggs well, and mix with half a pint of new milk, in which have been melted four ounces of butter; add to it a quarter of a pint of yeast, and three ounces of sugar, and put them, by degrees, into as much flour as will make a very light paste, rather like a batter, and let it rise before the fire half an hour; then add some more flour, to make it a little stiller, but not stift'. Work it well, and divide it into small loaves, or cakes, about five or six inches wide, and flatten them. When baked and cold, slice them the thickness of rusks, and put them in the oven to brown a little. Note. The cakes when first baked, eat deliciously buttered for tea; or, with caraways, to eat cold. To make Yeast. Thicken two quarts of water with fine flour, about three spoonfuls, boil half an hour, sweeten with near half a pound of brown sugar; when near cold, put into it four spoonfuls of fresh yeast in a jug, shake it well together, and let it stand one day to ferment near the fire, without being covered. There will be a thin liquor on the top, which must be poured off; shake the re- mainder and cork it up for use. Take always four spoonfuls of the old to ferment the next quantity, keep- ing it always in succession. A half-peck loaf will require about a gill. Another way.—BoU one pound of potatoes to a mash; w^hen half cold, add a cupfd of yeast, and mix it well. It win be ready for use in two or three hours, and keeps well. Use double the quantity of this to what you do of beer-yeast. To take off the bitter of yeast, put bran into a sieve and pour it through, having first mixed a little warm water with it.

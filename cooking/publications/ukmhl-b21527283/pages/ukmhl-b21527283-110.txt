Clear oU the fat, and add to the gravy half a pint of port wine, a glass of vinegar, and alarge spoonful of ketchup; simmer half an hour, and serve in a deep dish. Half a pint of table-beer may be added. The herbs to be used should be burnet, tarragon, parsley, thyme, basil, savoury, mar- joram, pennyroyal, knotted maijoram, and some chives if you can get them, but observe to proportion tho quantities to the pungency of the several sorts; let there be a good handful altogether.

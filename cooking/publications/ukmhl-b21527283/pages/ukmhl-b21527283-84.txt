8 DOMESTIC COOKERY. all is cold, pack tke fish in something deep, and let there be enough of pickle to plentifully cover. Pre- serve it from the air. The liquor must be drained from the fish, and occasionally boded and skimmed. Salmon collared. Split such a part of the fish as may be sufficient to make a handsome roU, wash and wipe it, and having mixed salt, white pepper, pounded mace, and Jamaica pepper, in quantity to season it very high, rub it inside and out well. Then roll it tight and bandage it, put as much water and one-third vinegar as will cover it, with bay-leaves, salt, and both sorts of peper. Cover close, and simmer till done enough. Drain and boil quick the liquor, and put on when cold. Serve with fennel. It is an elegant dish, and extremely good. COD. Some people bod the cod whole; but a large head and shoulders contain aU the fish that is proper to help, the thinner parts being overdone and tastless, before the thick are ready. But the whole fish may be pur- chased at times more reasonably; and the lower half, if sprinkled and hung up, will be in high perfection in one or two days. Or it may be made salter, and served with egg sauce, potatoes, and parsnips. Cod when small is usuaUy very cheap. If boded quite fresh it is watery ; but eats exceUently if salted and hung up for a day to give it firmness, then stuffed, and broded, or boiled. Cod's Head and Shoulders WiU eat much finer by having a little salt rubbed down the bone, and along the thick part, even if to be eaten the same day. Tie it up, and put it on the fire in cold water which wdl completely cover it: throw a handful of salt into it. Grreat care must be taken to serve it without the smaUest speck of black or scum. G-arnish with a large quantity of double parsley, lemon, horse-radish, and the mdt, roe, and liver, and fried smelts if approved.

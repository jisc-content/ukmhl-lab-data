The following pages will contain cookery for the sick ; it being of more consequence to support those whose had appetite will not allow them to take the necessary nourisWent, than to stimulate thatof personsin health. It may not be unnecessary to advise that a choice be made of the things most likely to agree with the patient; that a change be provided ; that some one at least be always ready ; that not too much of those be made at once which are not likely to keep, as invalids require variety; and that they should succeed each other in different forms and flavours. A clear Broth that unll Tccej) long. Put the mouse round of beef, a knuckle bone of veal, and a few shanks of mutton, into a deep pan, and cover close with a dish or coarse crust; bake till the beef is done enough for eating, with only as much water as will cover. When cold, cover it close in a cool place. When to be used, give what flavour may be approved. A quick made Broth. Take a bone or two of a neck or loin of mutton, take off the fat and skin, set it on the fire in a small tin sauce- pan that has a cover, with three quarters of a pint of water, the meat being first beaten, and cut in thin bits; put a bit of thyme and parsley, and, if approved, a slice of onion. Let it boil very quick, skim it nicely; take olf the cover, if likely to be too weak; else cover it. Half an hour is sufficient for the whole process. A very supporting Iroth against any kind of weakness. Boil two pounds of loin of mutton, with a very large handful of chervil, in two quarts of water to one. Take olf part of the fat. Any other herb or roots may be added. Take half a pint three or four times a day.

DIEECTIO^TS POR CAETINQ. 000 The carving-knifo for a lady should bo light, and of a middling size and fine edge. Strength is less required than address, in the manner of using it; and, to facilitate this, the cook should give orders to the butcher to divide the joints of the bones of all carcase-joints of mut- ton, lamb, and veal, (such as neck, breast, and loin ;) which may then be easily cut into thin slices attached to the adjoining bones. If the whole of the meat belonging to each bone should be too thick a small slice may be taken off between every two bones. The more fleshy joints (as fillet of veal, leg or saddle of mutton and beef,) are to be helped in thin slices, neatly cut and smooth; observing to let the knife pass down to the bone in the mutton and beef joints. The dish should not be too far off the carver, as it gives an awk- ward appearance, and makes the task more difficult. Attention is to be paid to help every one to a part of such articles as are considered the best. In helping fish, take care not to break the flakes, which in cod and very fresh salmon are large, and contribute much to the beauty of its appearance. A fish-knife, not being sharp, divides it best on this account. Help a part of the roe, milt, or liver, to each person. Tlie heads of carp, parts of those of cod and salmon, sounds of cod and fins of tarbot, are likewise esteemed niceties, and are to be attended to accordingly. In cutting up any wild-fowl, duck, goose, or turkey, for a largo party, if you cut the slices down from pinion to pinion, without making wings, there will be more prime pieces.

10 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Currie of Cod Should be made of sliced cod, that has either been crimped or sprinkled a day, to make it firm. Fry it of a fine brown with onion; and stew it with a good white gravy, a little currie-powder, a bit of butter and flour, three or four spoonfuls of rich cream, salt, and Cayenne, if the powder be not hot enough. To dress salt Cod. Soak and clean the piece you mean to dress, then lay it aU night in water, with a glass of vinegar. Boil it enough, then break it into flakes on the dish ; pour over it parsnips boiled, beaten in a mortar, and then boiled up wdth cream and a large piece of butter rubbed with a little flour. It may be served as above with egg- sauce instead of the parsnips, and the root sent up whole; or the fish may be boiled and sent up without flaking, and sauces as above. STURGEON.

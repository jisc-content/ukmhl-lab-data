199 BWEET DISHES take a little jelly, and mis with a tea-cupful of water, in which a bit of beet-root has been boiled, and run it through the bag when all the rest is run out; and this is to garnish the other jelly, being cooled on a plate, but this is matter of choice. This jelly has a very fine high colour and flavour. Orange Jelly. Grate the rind of two Seville and two China oranges, and two lemons; squeeze the juice of three of each, and strain, and add the juice of a quarter of a pound of lump sugar, and a quarter of a pint of water, and boil till it almost candies. Have ready a quart of isinglass jelly made with two ounces; put to it the syrup, and boil it once up ; strain off the jeUy, and let it stand to settle as above, before it is put into the mould. Hartshorn Jelly. Simmer eight ounces of hartshorn-shavings with two quarts of water to one; strain it, and boil it with the rinds of four China oranges and two lemons pared thin; when cold, add the juice of both, half a pound of sugar, and the whites of six eggs beaten to a froth; let the jeUy have three or four bods without stirring, and strain it through a jelly-bag. Cranberry Jelly. Make a very strong isinglass-jelly. When cold, mix it with a double quantity of cranberry juice pressed as directed in page 231, sweeten and boil it up; then strain it into a shape. The sugar must be good loaf,or the jelly will not be clear. Cranberry and Rice Jelly. Bod and press the fruit, strain the juice, and by de- grees mix into it as much ground rice as will, when boiled, thicken to a jelly; boil it gently, stirring it, and sweet- en to your taste. Put it in a bason or form, and serve to eat as afore-directed jeUy with milk or cream. Apple Jelly to serve at table. Prepare twenty golden pippins ; bod them in a pint and a half of water from the spring, tdl quite tender;

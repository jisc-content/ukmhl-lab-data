Cracked wheat (wheaten grits) is thought to “jelly” better—and this is one of its delightful characteristics—by being started in cold water. Rice cooked in the same way, is less inclined to be sticky; the flavor too, is better preserved. As a rule, the grains are preferred warm, or lukewann; though cracked wheat, cooked to a jeUy, is very good cold.

When the water boils mix in the gTain, and stir frequently the first ten or fifteen minutes, or it will settle to the bot- tom, and scorch. As the mush begins to thicken, set Avhere it wifi, boil or simmer slowly, and let it cook in all, an hour and a quarter. Stir lightly from the bottom, noAV and then, to prevent sticking ; but the less the granules are broken in the operation, the better. Have the mush thin enough to pour, but not too readily. When cooked in a steamer, less water is needed, as there is not so much evaporation; about four pints water to one of meal would sufiice, but more time is required ; two hours’ steaming would not be too long.

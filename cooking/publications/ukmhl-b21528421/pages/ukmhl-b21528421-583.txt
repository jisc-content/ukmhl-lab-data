PART III.] PRACTICAL HINTS. 5G5 “ Young fowls (cliiclcens) have a tender skin, smooth legs and comb, and the best have yellow legs. In old fowls the legs ai'e rough and hard.” “ In prairie chickens, when fresh, the eyes are full and round, not sunken; and if young, the breast-bone is soft, and 3ields to pressure. The latter test also apjrhes to all fowls, and game birds.” “ When fresh, the ej’es of fish are full and bright, and the giUs a fine cleiu- red; the body stiff, and the smell not unpleasant. Mackerel must be latel}’^ caught, or it is very indifferent fish; and the flavor and excellence of salmon, depend entirely on its freshness.” “AU fish which have been jracked in ice, should be cooked immediateh^ after re- moval, as the\' soon grow soft, and lose their flavor.” “ If frozen when brought from the market, thaw in ice-cold water.” The Cellar. A dwelling house should never be without a cellar; and the latter should extend under every fool of the former. A house built without this convenience is not only incomiilete in itself, but it is usually damp and unhealthy; with it, tlie dwelling may be healthy or otherwise, according to the con- dition in which the cellar is kept. In the first place, every room below the ground floor, should be thorougldy dry; and in order to have it so, the house itself must be properly finished; the eaves must be supplied with gutters and down pipes, through which the water from the roof can either be carried into a cistern, or else conducted awaj' from the dwelling by means of sewer pipes, or other drainage. If in spite of these precautionary measures water finds access to the cellar, it must be carefully drained away, or (what is better) kept out. Sometimes a beating rain forces itself against the outer wall of the building, and the water after reaching and saturating the gi’ound trickles through crevices in the basement, and covers the cellar floor.

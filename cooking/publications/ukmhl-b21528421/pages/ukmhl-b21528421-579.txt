5G1 PRACTICAL HINTS. PART 111.] city, you must keep your wits about you, and look out for the little tricks of these market people; for example, if you are buying small fruits, do not let them serve you from the real* of a stale heaj), because, forsooth, there haj^pens to be a layer of fresh berries on top. Nor must you be coaxed into buying a thing, simply because the mai*ket-man (or woman) says it is so and so. Leai’n to judge for yourself, as to the quality of the article; and if you have any doubts in regard to its excellence, do not piu'chase. If you are not an cxjiert at this business, the hints given below on the se- lection of fruits, vegetables and meats, may perhaps be of service. String Beans.—See that the little stems are green and ten- der; if these are dry and shriveled, the beans are stale. Young Peas.—Look at the stems; they should be green and unshriveled. The pods ai’e not an infallible guide ; these often look fresh for days after the stems are shrunken. Beets.—Examine the tops; both leaves and stems should he perfectly fresh; and the roots if newly dug, rviU be firm to the touch. Cabbage.—First look at the stalk, and see whether it is entirely sound ; if it is at all discolored, the cabbage is not the best. The leaves should be fresh and crisp, and free from decay; the outer ones a healthy gi’een, with no 3'el- low', sickly hue about them. • Cauliflower.—When this vegetable is fresh, the flowers are milk-white; if tinged with yellow, it is stale; if brown, it is very stale. Asparagus.—Asparagus to be good, must be cut (or snap- ped off below the ground) as often as every day, or every other day, at the fai'thest; otherwise the stalks wnll be tough. If newly gathered, these should be crisp and tender. New Potatoes.—Potatoes recently dug, are firm to tlio touch; if unripe, they will become Avilted in a few days, and wiU be clammy or sticky when cooked. 24*

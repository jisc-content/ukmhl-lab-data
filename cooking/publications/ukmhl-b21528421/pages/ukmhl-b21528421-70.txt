52 [PAET'L HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. the stuffed sausages—every paid is in demand. PicMed pigs’ feet are considered a rare delicac}'; and hogs’ brains make another “ dainty dish.” But it is left for the very bon-ton of society to sit down to what is called beef a-la-mode; which is simply a beef roast plugged full of fat j)ork, along with innumerable spices, etc. Nor is it enough that we devour the several paids of the animal, even to his liver and kidneys; we strip the intestines of their fat, melt it down, and use it in the form of lard. This latter is the very quintessence of the swine; it is the diseased product of all his filthy feeding; and it is tJm arti- cle that forms a staple in almost every American family. It shOldens the biscuits, the plain cakes, and the pastries; and it even finds its way into the loaf bread! It oils the bake- pans, it fries the drop-cakes, the doughnuts, the Saratoga potatoes, and all the other “ fried things,” or nearly all. In short, there is neither breakfast, dinner nor supper without it, in some form or other. Do the people wonder that they are afflicted with scrofula; and that it crops out, full-fledged, in a single generation ? Oh for a Moses among the Gentiles, to forbid them, by legal enactment, the use of this vile thing, swine’s flesh! The late R. T. Trail, 1\I.D., in discussing the quality of animal foods in his Hydropathic Encyclopedia, says: “Of the hog, whose filthj’- carcass is converted into a mass of disease by the ordinary fattening process, I need only ex- press my abhorrence. Although swine’s flesh and gi’ease, under the names of poi'Jc and lard, ai’e stajile and favorite articles of food throughout Christendom, common observa- tion has long since traced the prevalence of scrofula, erysij)- elas, and a variety of glandular and eniptive diseases resulting from impure blood, to their general employment. If there are any animals which should be exterminated from the earth, mad dogs and fatted hogs are among them.”

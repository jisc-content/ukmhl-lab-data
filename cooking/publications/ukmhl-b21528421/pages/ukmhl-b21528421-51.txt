33 PART 1.] THE PEttlTS. the whole wheat, the following table, if even pi-oximately coiTect, ought to be of especial interest. It was submitted by a j\Ir. Johnson, some years ago in Blachvood’s Magazine: In 1,000 lbs. IVhoie IV/ieat, F'ine Flour. Muscular matter .... loGlbs. 130 lbs.

They cool and refresh us in the heat of summer; they supply organic fluids to the system, replacing those that are lost in perspii’ation from day to day ; and they keep the vital machinery in good working order. If no other proof were furnished of the natural requirements of the human system for fniits, a very broad hint is given in the fact that they are capable of being grown in nearly every quarter of the habitable globe ; throughout the temperate zones, as well as the tropics, we find them in great abundance. Another evidence in the same direction, is the fact that in the course of the season the different varieties of fruits follow each other in close succession, so tliat one is hardly gone till another is ready. And, as if to supply any defect that may arise from negligence on om* part, or from climatic causes, one quarter of the globe supplements an- other to such a degree, that any local failure in the fruit crop is largely made up by an over-abundant yield in some neighboring locality. So that if apples fail us in the IVIiddle States, they are directly shipped from the North ; or if the supply from that quarter is short, there are peaches 2*

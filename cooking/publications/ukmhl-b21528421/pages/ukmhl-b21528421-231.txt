213 PART II. J FRUITS AND FRUIT JUICES. R.\spberries and Cueeants.=|= Wash the currants in a colander, drain them well, and strip carefully from the stems ; all that are bruised and dis- colored should be thrown out. Then look over the rasp- ben'ies, and see that there ai*e no stems or leaves among them; the fruit should not be overripe. xVdd to four quaiis of black raspberries one of red cui’rants (more cur- rants and less berries ai-e better), and allow five pints of cold water to the five quaids of mixed fruit. Put all into a porcelain kettle, heat slowly, and skim as soon as it boils ; then stir in half a cujd of sugar, and skim again ; cook over a slow fire five minutes. If red raspberries are used (and they are excellent), take two quarts of water and two-thirds of a cup of sugai’, to five quails of mixed fruit. Raspberry and Currant Juice.=|= Prepare the berries and currants as in the preceding rec- ipe, and when they begin to boil stew slowly three to five minutes ; then strain through a coarse cloth. Return to the kettle, add the sugar, and heat gradually till the liquid boils ; skim if there is need. If not wanted for immediate use, put it into glass cans boiling hot, and set in a dark place. This juice makes a good sauce for grains, mushes, plain puddings, etc. Gooseberries. =|= Goosebemes, like other fruits, are best ripe, or nearly so; if stewed when beginning to turn red, they are excellent. Remove the stems and blossoms, and wash thoroughly ; put them into a fruit-kettle, and allow two quarts of cold water for every six quarts of hemes. Heat slowly to boiling, and skim ; then add two cups of sugar, cook five minutes, and either put the fruit into cans or set it off to cool. If the ben'ies are sufficiently ripe, the juice will be a delicate pink

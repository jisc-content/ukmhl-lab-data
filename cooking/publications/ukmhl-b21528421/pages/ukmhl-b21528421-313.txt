As soon as done cover with a meringue made by beating together the two whites, and the rest of the lemon and sugar, heat till it changes color, and take the pies from the oven. Eat cold. Sweet Potato PiE.^t^ 3 cups sweet milk. 1 cup “ potato. 1 “ sugai'. 2 eggs, yolks and whites separate. Juice of half a lemon. Boil the sweet potatoes, good sound ones, in a little water till tender. Eemove the skins, and trim off any de- fective spots on the surface or ends ; in wet seasons, there is often a dark layer just beneath the skin. Grate the po- tato or mash fine, till you have a cupful; mix this well with the milk, leaving no lumps ; or you may put the milk and potato through a colander. Then beat the yolks, lemon and sugar together, and stir in the milk and potato ; add the well-whipped whites, and mix thoroughly. Line two pie- pans with a very firm cream paste, set them in the oven, and fill wdth the potato batter ; bake rather slowly until the center is thickened, and almost firm. Then remove the pies from the oven, slip from the tins to plates, and set in a cool place. Serve cold the day you make them.

Unless these deficiencies are made up by some other foods, the exclusive use of fine flour bread ^\ill leave the nerves and bones poorly nourished, producing in some systems nervousness, d^'sjDepsia, and all the physical iUs taat foUow these diseases, together with impatience, fretfuiness, and irratibilitv.

ADDENDUM. 588 let US have them ; and the way to find them, is to look for them. A young medical student with whom the writer is ac- quainted, found himself in dyspeptic conditions, and in rather poor health generally. He tried the raw grains and fruits, together with nuts, and immediately began to im- prove; at the end of a few months the dyspej)sia was ah gone, and his general health much better; and at the end of two years, he considered himself as “made over.” How much of this improvement w^as due to the new diet (he gave it credit for a good deal), and how much to the hints he got out of Dr. Oswald’s Physical Education, which he was then reading, it might be difficult to determine; but it is probable that he obtained good from both. Judging from the history of neaiiy all reforms, whether real, or so called, it may be reasonable to suppose that in this, as in the others, its advocates will, in the heat of en- thusiasm, make some mistakes; though perhaps this is unavoidable. In the absence of a knowledge of the right way, one has to experiment, and then profit afterward by the mistakes committed. Already, questions, such as the following, are asked: 1. Suppose we eat uncooked grains ; can we manage them xohole, even if our teeth are sound ? And if so, would it not consume a great deal of time ? 2.

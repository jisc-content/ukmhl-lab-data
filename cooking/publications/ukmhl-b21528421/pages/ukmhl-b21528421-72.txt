[part L HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. 54 nourisliment of the infant; and as soon as the calf is able to take more solid food, the maternal supphes, where nature is not j>erverted, are diied up. But the unnatiu’al practice of milking cows has distended the milk glands, and thus converted them, in a lai-ge measm’e, into dej)m'ating organs; and the milk supply is not only increased, but prolonged beyond the period that nature intended. Add to this the improper foods, as swill-feeding, the confined air, and other unhealthful conditions with which tlie animal is suiTOund- ed, paidicularly in large cities, and we have not only a pro- lific source of disease, but an explanation, in part at least, of the enoi’mous death-rate among young children; this, it wfil be noticed, is always largest in cities, where the milk used is poorer in quahty than country milk. But retmaiing to the direct question, suppose we have the best of milk, from perfectly healthy cow's, what is the real objection to its use? To tliis question there are two answers ; the first is founded on experience, and may be stated as follows : It is the almost universal testimony of persons of sedentary habits, dark complexions and “ bilious temperaments,” that milk, even of good quality, does not agree with them ; and where there is torpor of the liver, or other dyspeptic conditions, it usually causes distress. The reason of this will directly appear. As already stated (and herein is the second answer), milk is designed by nature for the young of all mammals ; it contains a small per cent, of solid substances, but enough for the needs of the infant; and these substances are just the elements, and in the right proportions, to make those soft, fatty tissues wdiich the little creature needs for the protection of its small bones and dehcate organs. As the child or young animal gi’ows, and the teeth develop, other and more solid materials should take the place of the milk ; this chan ;'o must, of course, be gradual. Many mothers elo their babes harm, and in fact make them sick, by giving them solid food before they are

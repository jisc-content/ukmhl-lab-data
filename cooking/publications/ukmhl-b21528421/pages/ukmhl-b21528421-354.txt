HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD, [part hi. 336 12 eai's of corn well filled, or tln-ee pints pulp. Time—an hour and a half, slow oven. Select perfect ears, well filled, hut young and tender ; the “ evergreen ” is hest j if field com is used, the white or yellow “flint” is excellent. Split the grains half theii’ depth by drawing a sharp knife down the rows of corn, be- ginning at the larger end of the ear. Then with a dull knife scrape out the pulp; this is done by scraping from the large to the small end of the cob ; if you draw the knife in the other direction, it teai’S out the grains, hulls and aU. Beat the yolks and whites separately, the latter to a stiff froth ; stii’ these with the corn, and beat hard ; then add the milk, a little at a tune, beating as you add it. When aU is in, pour the batter into a well-oiled pudding-dish, and place in a di’ipping-pan of boiling water. Have a slow oven, and bake covered, an hour and a half ; stir once from the bottom, ten minutes after the dish is set in the oven. The pudding should be an inch and a half to two inches thick ; you must not hurry the baking ; it should be mod- erately browned on top, when done. Serve warm from the dish ; it is good enough eaten without butter, or other dressing. Green Corn Pudding. i[ji 1 quart sweet milk. 1 “ grated corn. 2 eggs, yolks and whites separate.

CAKE-M.VKING. 281 PAET III.] Apple Cake.^}: Make the same as Graham cream cake, using only half a cup of sugiU' to the other measurements, and bake i-ia two cakes, each an inch in thickness. In the mean time, stew some apples in as little water as will cook them; and when the cakes are done and cooled a little, spread the hot apple between. Serve when neaiiy cold, with cream, or fruit, juice. Strawberries, or ripe peaches thinly sliced, may be used instead of stewed apples; the berries should be very riiie, and chopped a httle before spreading. Huckleberry Cake. 1 cup sour cream. 2 cups sifted Graham flour. 1 cup sugar. 2 eggs, yolks and whites separate. IJ teaspoonfuls soda, dissolved in boiling water. 1^ pints huckleberries, fresh and ripe. Dredge the berries with a poriion of the flour; then beat the yolks and sugar together, add the sour cream and stir in the flouiâ€™, forming a smooth batter. Whip in the whites cut to a stiff froth, add the dissolved soda, and beat thor- oughly. Lastly, stir the beiTies in carefully, breaking them as little as possible; pour into an oiled cake-pan, not too deep, and bake in a very moderate oven till a broom-straw comes out clean; then add five minutes to the baking, and remove from the oven. In ten minutes more take the cake out of the pan, and set it right side up on a sieve to cool. If jneferred, use sweet cream, and less soda by half a teaspoonful.

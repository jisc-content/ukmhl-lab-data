STEAMED GRAINS. The table below gives the proportions of grain and water by measurement, and the time required for cooking in a closed steamer. (A closed steamer is one that admits the steam through Jlues in the side or elsewhere, and not throng!i holes in the bottom.) Some like these grains cooked quite dry, and others prefer them very moist; if the proportions here given do not suit the taste, it will be an easy matter to correct them, after a single tnal.

58G ADDENDUM. rather an imponderable fluid, which is related to the vital and electiical forces of the human system. The organic vital force has not incorrectly been called, the interrogation point of physiology; and the physiologists and chemists of the old school, thought to maintain this force by supplying albuminoids to the system. The fact, however, is the reverse. The albuminoids demand rather a great expense of vitality for their solution and digestion. We know now, with great ceiiainty, and by practical experience, that the human system is maintained and strengthened by the con- sumption of fresh air, fresh water, and ripe fruits and gi’ains; but these essential means of sustenance are reduced from the rank of vital to merely nutritive substances, by any treatment that through heat or otherwise, destroys their natural vitality. Our ph^’siologists have not hitherto under- stood this difference between the vital and the merely nu- tritive properties of food, and hence, as we have already pointed out, have regarded foods merely as chemical sub- stances. They have discovered and laid dovm, with wonder- ful exactness, the chemical elements of the Ihing body, and hence of the food requisite, according to their views, to its maintenance; but we hope to show in the following pages that their methods, and consequently their dietetic conclu- sions, have been one-sided, and essentially erroneous. So long as the electrical vitality of food is overlooked, and the bearings of anthropology upon the question ignored, a scien- tific system of diet must remain impossible. “ The value of foods consists not in their nutritive prop- erties alone, but in their proper proportion of fluids ; in the necessary bulk, by which digestion is rendered possible; in the natural stimulation of their juices and acids; in the aroma by which the appetite is aroused and its regular recuiTence promoted; in their chemically neutral character, which prevents their generating acids or forming injurious compounds in the stomach; in their freedom from those

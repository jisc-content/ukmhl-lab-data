Buy the kind of baking- jiowder that is least adulterated, if you know which that is. The “ Price ” is said by chemists to be nearly or quite free from foreign ingredients—aside from starch, which, to say the least, is not poisonous. In hygienic cake—if any cake can be so designated—mix as follows : Beat the yolks and sugar together, add a httle of the cream, and stii’ in flom’ to thicken ; then more cream, then more flour*. When all is used, stir in the whipped whites and beat well; then the dissolved soda, and beat very thoroughly, till the batter is light and smooth ; then pour it into the cake-pan, and bake immediately. Never let the Iratter stand after it is mixed ; and never move the cake while it is baking, if it can be avoided ; test toward the last with a broom-straw, to see if the dough adheres to it; when done, the straw should come out clean from the thickest portion. In making cake, and in cooling after it is baked, the Buckeye Cookery says: “Do not s/ir, but beat thoroughlj*, bringing the batter up from the bottom of the dish at every stroke ; in this way the air* is driven into the cells of the batter, instead of out of them ; but the cells wiU be finer if beaten more slowly at the last, remembering that the motion should always be upward.” “The oven should be rather hot for small cakes, and moderate for larger ones. Most kinds of loaf cake may be ttiken from the tins in about fifteen minutes after they come from the oven; but they should not be turned over on the tojr to cool.” A good way is to turn a common wire sieve upside down, and when the cake is taken out of the pan, place it right side up on the sieve till it is thorouglily cold. If not to be eaten till the next day, wrap it in a clean thick towel or napkin, put it into a tin box or stone jar, and cover closely.

Tomatoes are sometimes broiled, by holding the slices between the wires of an oyster-broiler until the surface is shghtly browned. Or you may lay them into a skillet, well oiled, and smoking hot; when one side is seiu*ed, turn and brown the other. Stuffed Tomatoes. Scald the tomatoes (not too long), and remove the skins; then slice off tlie blossom ends, and take out the inside; chop this tine, and add grated bread-crumbs, ^moistened with milk or cream; some use butter, or cold beef gravy. Or you may omit the milk or cream, and add to the crumbs and tomato, half or two-thirds the quantity of finely hashed beef or mutton ; moisten the meat with a spoonful of cold gravy, if you have it. Fill the hollow tomatoes with this dressing, and replace the top slices; then arrange in an earthen or granitized ii-on pan, pack the dressing that re- mains between them, and bake, covered, forty to fifty minutes. Another way is to fill tlie tomatoes with a force-meat made of crumbs, tomatoes, and gi’ated green corn, in about e<[ual quantities; stir in a little cream, butter or dripping before filling, and bake as before. Still another method, is to take chopped cabbage instead, of corn, and a chopped onion (parboiled) if you like it. Mix with the tomato, and moisten with cold gravy or sweet cream; then fill and bake.

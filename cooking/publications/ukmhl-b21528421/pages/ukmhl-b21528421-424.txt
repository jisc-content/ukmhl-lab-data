HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. 406 [part Hi. must of course be washed off, even tLougli Ave detract from the exquisite beauty of the fruit, by destroying in a meas- ure that indescribable coA^ering, the “bloom,” Avdiich no artist can ever hope to paint. The best thing to do Avith them, when the bunches come heated, and laden with dust, is to droji them into cold water—ice-water, if you have it—and let them stand ten to fifteen minutes, before serving. Then lay the bunches loosely, on a wide but shaUoAv glass dish; or, arrange them with other fruit, as pears or peaches, by filling a dish with the latter, and laying the grapes on top. They are fine, eaten the first thing at the breakfast table, particularly on a warm morning. Fresh Figs. Fresh figs and fresh dates, are said to be very good, eaten either Avithout a dressing, or Avith milk or cream; but since Ave rarely see them in this climate, there is little opportunitj^ to know much about them, either as to quahty, flavor, or modes of serving. Frosted Fruit. Take fine bunches of currants, and dip them, one at a time, into the beaten white of an egg, moistening the en- tire surface of the fruit. Then roll each bunch in poAvdered sugar, and lay them a little apart, on an inA^erted sieve, on which has been placed a clean white paper. Put them into an oven, slightly warm, or on top of the stoA^e, to dry. Cherries on their stems, and in clusters if you can get them, are beautiful, jirepared in the same Avay. Or you may take plums, grapes or apricots, dip each into the egg, and lay a little apart on the paper; then sift the sugar OA^er them, and dry as before. Fruits frosted in this manner, are used for garnishing cakes, and other dessert dishes; or they may be tastefully arranged in a dish by themselves, or with other fruit.

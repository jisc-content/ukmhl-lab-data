PART III.] 515 MEAT PIES, ETC. aiul moisten the meat with the liquor; do not make it too wet. Peel and boil five or six potatoes, drain, add a little milk, and mash till there are no lumps; then stir in more milk, forming a batter that wiU just drop from the spoon. Put the hash into a bake-pan, spread it in an even layer, and al)Out an inch in depth; then poui’ on the potato batter, smooth it down with a knife, and bake from thii-ty to forty minutes in a moderate oven. Send to the table as soon as done. Beef may be used instead of mutton.

Or if there is no steak, you may simply dilute the gi’avy you have with a little warm water, and take this to moisten the pie. When the hash is prepared, peel some potatoes and drop into boiling water, scarcely more than will cook them; tliere should be fuUy as much potato as meat. Boil steadily, and the very instant a fork will go through the largest, drain off all the water, return the pot to the fire, add a trifle of good milk (cream is better), and mash till there ai’e no lumps. Do all this very quickly, for the potato must be steaming hot, and rather dry. Now cover the bottom of a bake-pan with a layer of the hash (it should take half of it), put in

The rice is steamed, rather than boiled, until it is nearly done ; then the cover of the pot is taken off, the surplus steam and moisture are allowed to escape, and the rice turns out a mass of snow-w'hite kernels, each separate from the other, and as much superior to the soggy mass we usually get in the United States, as a fine mealy potato is to the water-soaked ariicle.

I am sure tliat, if cooked as it is here, the consumption of this wholesome and delicious cereal would largely increase in America.” AIUSHES. Sometimes young children, and indeed those of a “ larger gi’owth,” are too much inclined to the use of soft, sloppy foods, as mushes, soups, etc. After the teeth are developed, these should not be eaten as often as every meal, nor to the exclusion of drier foods, but loith them. The haixl Graham roU is the best bread to eat Avith mushes. On the preparation of these, the late R. T. Trail, M.D., has the following excellent paragraph : “ Mushes of all kinds should be stiiTed as little as possi- ble Avhile cooking, after the material sets, or stops sinking to the bottom. Much stirring breaks ui? the paidicles and frees the starchy matter, rendering the food pasty, and de- stroying the light, spongy, delicate appearance it should present on the table ; too lauch stirring also makes it more liable to adhere to the bottom of the vessel. The water should boU when the meal or gi’ain is stixTed in, be kept boiling, and the mush stiiTed frequently for a few minutes, Avhen it will cease sinking ; then cover closely, and cook sloAAdy for an hour or moi’e. Mushes should not be too thick, nor so thin as to spread much on the plate when dished. The tendency of fruit Avheu cooked in mushes, is to settle and adhere to the kettle ; hence, in adding fruit, the better Avay, as a general rule, is to cook it separately, and mix just before dishing. The fruit for this purpose should ahvays be cooked slowly, and in as little water as possible.” The best di’essing for mushes, because the most healthful, is fruit or fruit juice ; though they can be eaten without a dressing.

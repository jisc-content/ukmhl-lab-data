vm PREFACE. has endeavored, even at the expense of brevity, to avoid falling into a like error. The recipes claim to be sufficiently exj)licit, and as far as is possible, accurate. Some of them are wholly original, others are not; many valuable hints have been derived from books already published on hygienic cooking. In preparing Part II. the following works have been consulted freely, and in some instances quoted verba- tim ; viz.: The Hygeian Home Cook-Book, by the late R. T. Trail, M.D.; the Health Eeformei''s Cook-Book, Battle Creek, Mich.; and How to Prepare Food, by Mrs. Lucretia E. Jackson, DansviUe, N. Y. For the benefit of those who are beginning to trjâ€™^ hygienic cookery, but whose families and friends are not thoroughly converted to the system, Part III. has been written, with directions for preparing foods, not strictly in the hygienic way, but in such a manner as to render them relatively plain and healthful. An urgent caU having been made for a work of this kind, the suggestion has been acted upon to bind it and the hygienic cook-book in the same volume. In the preparation of Part HI. the author is greatly in- debted to several writers, among whom are Catharine Beecher, Marion Harland, Emma P. Ewing, and the author or compiler of the Buckeye Cookery.

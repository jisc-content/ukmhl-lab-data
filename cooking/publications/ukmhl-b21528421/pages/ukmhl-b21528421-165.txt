STE.V:WED GRAINS. 147 PART II.] Rolled or Crusued Barley. Allow one part grain and three parts water, hot or cold ; then steam the same as the last, only hardly so long ; three hours would be sufficient. On finishing, some stir in a spoonful or two of cream. PnvRL Whkvt.=|= Put into a closed steamer one cup of pearl wheat and four cups of hot or cold water, and cook three hours.

If you have not a steamer, cook in a farina-kettle, allow- ing room to swell ; or in a covered tin bucket set in a pot of boiling water. If cooked in either of these, it will re- quire four or five hours to make the grain tender ; less, if it has been soaked.

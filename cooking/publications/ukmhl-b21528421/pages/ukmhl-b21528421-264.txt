24G HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLl). [PART II. IVIay Cherries.—Wash the cheiTies in a colander, drain well, and stew, rejecting any that are decayed or wormy. If you want the fruit for temporary use, you may let^ve in the seeds ; then, to five quarts of stemmed cherries allow three pints of cold water, and two-thirds of a cup of sugar. If the fruit is very juicy take less water by about one-third. Or if intended for winter use, remove the seeds, and take three pints of water to five quarts of seeded cherries ; bring slowly to a boil, and skim if necessary. Add one full cup of sugar, and as soon as the mass is tliorouglily heated seal in glass cans. Too much cooking destroys the flavor of the cheiTies.

Stew very slowly fifteen to twenty minutes, skimming well ; then add one cup of sugar, cook a moment longer, and put into glass cans. When you open, strain through a colander to remove the skins. You may strain before sealing, if you like ; but in this case use an earthen colander, or a coarse cloth ; the hot juice will corrode tin. If the berries are very ripe, allow a little more water, and less sugai'. Strawberries.—How best to Can. Strawberries are thought to be more difficult to keep when canned than almost any other fruit; and it has puz- zled many to understand just why they should give so

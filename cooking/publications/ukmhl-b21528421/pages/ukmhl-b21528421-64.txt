[part I. HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. 46 Dials, particularly if it be not well cooked, are more or less exposed to the tapeworm malady.* Animals that are to l>e eaten should bo fed on the cleanest of food, and should have plenty of pui-e water to drink; they should never be kept in confined places, or with filthy surroundings. In fact, they need at least a ten-acre field to nm in, and get plenty of exercise and fresh air, as well as fresh grass. “ But how can they have this,” you ask, “ when the country becomes densely populated aU through ? It A^^ll take more room for the animals, than the people have for themselves and their childi’en.” Very true; and wdien this is the case, the people will then be obliged to live upon fruits and grains, and the products of the garden, w'hich Avill be infinitely better for them. Meat is an expensive diet, every way you take it; but the ex23ense in actual dol- lars and cents, is the least part of it. Used three times a day, as it is by very many of our jieojfie, it is anything but health-producing; and the doctors’ bills often exceed those at the meat market—to say nothing of the time lost, the suffering endm'ed, and the actual impairment of the general health. It is the duty of the butcher, as well as of those who jiur- chase the meat, to see that no animal is killed in an angered condition, as the lilood is actually jioisoned by the mental excitement thus jiroduced. Neither should it be overheated by rimning ; this sends the blood to the capillaries ; and the flesh which is filled Avith it is not only much darker from the superabundance of Annous blood, but the meat is ren- dered putrescent by it. Butchers have sometimes been obliged to throw away a whole beef, from its having been killed after severe racing ; the flesh being not only unfit to eat, but commencing to putrefy very soon after life was extinct. *8ec lecture on “Worms,” by F.

PART 11. j PASTRIES. 1G7 and sauce. Wliat is known in the markets as tlie English inorello, which has shoid stems, thick llesh, and a small seed, is very good. It is red, not black. Huckleberry Cobbler. Line a bake-dish with a good cream paste rolled twice as thick as for common pie-crust, and fill it nearly full witli hucklebeiT*ies; the dish should be about two inches in depth. Sin-inkle lightly with sugar, and cover with a crust a quaiier of an inch thick ; when you have pressed together and finished the edges, prick weU with a fork, cut a cross- slit in the center, and bake in rather a quick oven from forty to fifty minutes, or till the bottom crust is done. Then slip the pie on a platter, and cool before you serve it. You may use Ikiht cream paste for “ cobbler ” pies ; but the ordinary kind is preferable, particularly when there is an under crust; it is not so apt to burst in baking, and it is sweeter. Apple Dumplings. =jj= Pare sound taid apples of medium size, and not over- ripe ; cut in halves, take out the cores, and then wash quickly in cold water to remove the knife-rust. Make a light cream paste, as per recipe already given ; it must l)e pretty stiff ; pinch off bits of the dough, and roll to the thickness of a quarter of an inch, in a long or ovixl shape, and just lai'ge enough to cover two halves of the apj)les fitted together. Wet the margin of the crust by dipping the fin- ger in cold water, so that the dough will adhere ; then jfiace the fruit within it, bring up the edges, and pinch firmly together. No water is needed, if the apples are juicy and recently waslied. Put the dumidings into a bread-pan, slightly oiled, and space them well apart, so they will not touch each other ; prick on top with a fork, and bake in a moderate oven neai’ly an houi-, or till the apple is done j

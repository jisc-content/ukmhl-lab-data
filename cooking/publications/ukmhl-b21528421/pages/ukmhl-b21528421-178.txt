[part II. HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. 160 Cherry Pie-=|H Take tart cherries, wash them, pick over carefully, and seed. Then hne the pie-pans with a stiff cream jiaste, roUing the crust pretty thin ; over the bottom of each sprinkle a little flour, and also the sugar, if any is needed, mixing them together with a brush of the hand ; the flour and sugar in the bottom of the pan, prevent the juices from soaking into the crust. Then put in the fruit, lay on the top crusts thinly roUed, pinch the edges firmly together, and prick well with a fork ; it is also safe to cut a good cross-slit in the center of each, for the escape of steam. Bake in a quick oven, and take out as soon as the crusts are thoroughly done ; it wiU requii’e from twenty to twenty-five minutes. Let the pies get entirely cold before serving. Berry PiE.=jj= Blackberries, raspberries, strawbemes, hucklebeiTies, or any of the ordinary “berries,” may be used. Select fruit not too ripe, look it over carefully, and make the same as cherry pie. Very little sugar wiU be needed, say half a tablespoonful to a pie, or even less. The crust, it wiU be remembered, is to be mixed stiff, put together without kneading, and roUed rather thin. If the fruit is quite juicy, as blackberries or strawberries, dust a little flour over the bottom crust, sprinkle on the sugar, brushing them weU to- gether, and then put in the fruit. Bake in rather a brisk oven from twenty to thirty minutes, or till the crusts are done. If blackberry or raspberry pie is overdone, the fruit will taste bitter. Serve cold. If gooseben’ies are used, take them when they are just heginninrj to ripen, and aUow at least a good tablespoonful of sugar to a pie. Canned fruits, as chemes, raspberries, blackbemes, goose- berries, etc., make excellent pies. If canned for this pur- pose they should be cooked as httle as possible, and put up

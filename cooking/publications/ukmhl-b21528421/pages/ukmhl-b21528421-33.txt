The food question is one of the most important, not to (Say the most difficult, that the physiologist has to handle ; and with aU the experience of bygone ages, we have not as yet been able to fuUy unravel the mysteries of this many- sided problem. What products to select and the best methods of growing them, how to prepare the food and how often to piu*take of it, what quantity is necessary to supply the waste of the tissues, what variety is needed, and what combinations produce the best digestion—all these, and more, remain to be studied in the light of known facts and of physiological scifence. As regards the nature or quality of foods, it ipust be con- ceded that that food is best which moat nearly supplies the natural imste of the tissues. And those articles which con- tain the largest amount of the materials necessary to build up the body, these being in the required proportions, would rank higher in value than other articles which are poor in tliis respect. Natiu'e, has given us a bountiful sujiply of food products, some rich in quantity and variety of nutritive elements, and some containing an abundance of certain food princijiles, with rather a meager supply of others ; while there are many that yield only a limited amount of nutrient matter. Thus, the lavish profusion that is furnished to our hand gives room for the exercise of judgment in selecting foods, as well as skill in preparing them. The results of chemical analysis, as given by Liebig,

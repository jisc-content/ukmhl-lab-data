Just before lifting from the fire, put in (if they require it) enough boiling water to make them pretty juicy. If new, steam-dried, and cut in quarters or eighths, the following rule is a good one : Over two quarts of aj^ples, trimmed and washed, pour three quarts of boding water ; cook pretty fast twenty minutes ; then add one quart of water, boihng hot, and cook ten to fifteen minutes longer.

When the apples are of poor quality, a handful of raisins stewed with them is sometimes an imj)rovement.

If unpeeled, wash them through two or throe waters, and rub well with the fingers to remove the down. Start in boiling water, and stew rather fast till tender; if steam-dried, they will usually cook in about twenty-five minutes.

Have them just soft, when done; too much cooking or too much fluid, gives the fruit a washed-out taste. The juice, of which there must

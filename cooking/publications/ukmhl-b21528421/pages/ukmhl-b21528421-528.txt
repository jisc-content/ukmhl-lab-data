[PABT m. 510 HEAIiTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. Mutton oe L.\mb Pie.^^ Good mutton or lamb makes an excellent pie. If you have a piece with ribs, cut the latter in short lengths, say an inch and a half, and then sepai’ate Ihem by cutting be- tween. If there is much fat remove a portion of it, then cover with boiling water, and slice in an onion, if you like; stew slowly, till the meat is neaily tender. Peel half a dozen small potatoes, quarter them, or cut in pretty thick pieces, and boil eight minutes in very little Avater. While they are cooking mix a light cream paste, as per recipe ah’eady given. When the meat has boiled enough take it out, remove any large bones, but leave in the ribs; and if some portions are in big j^ieces, cut them into inch bits, or a Httle larger. Cover the bottom of a granitized iron pan or other bake- dish with half of it, and then put in half the potatoes, scat- tering them well over the meat; add the rest of the mutton or lamb, and the remainder of the potatoes; put in also a few small bits of paste, if you like it. Stir into the liquor left in the pot, a little white flour wet with milk or water, and heat to a boil; then pour it over the pie. Should there not be enough of the gravy to more than half cover it, add a little boiling water. Lay on the crust, rolled about half an inch thick, cut a cross-slit in the middle, and bake in an even oven thirty to forty minutes. Serve in the dish. Mutton or lamb mixed with chicken, squiiTel, rabbit, or wild foAvl, makes a very good pie; these you may stew in a separate pot, if they take a longer or shorter time to cook than the other meat. Meat Pie with Potato Crust. Make hke either of the two last, and cover with a crust made as directed in the second paragraph, under the head of “Cream and Potato Paste.” This paste is good, but not equal to light cream paste.

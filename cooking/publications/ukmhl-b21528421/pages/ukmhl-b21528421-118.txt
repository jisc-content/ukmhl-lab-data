PART II. THE HYGIENIC DIETARY. To those who are acquainted with the principles of hygiene as expounded by their great originator, the late R. T. Trail, M.D., it is needless to say, that a strictly hygienic dietary is one in which the grains, fruits and vegetables, are all pre- pared without the slightest addition of seasonings or condi- ments, even sugar and milk being excluded. But so far removed from this plan are the usual methods of cooking, and so great the prejudice against this innovation, that it is next to impossible to convince people that foods prepared in this plain, simple manner, could be either healthful or pal- atable. It is the object of this work, or rather this pari of it, to place before the reader a collection of recipes, which, with little or no alteration, would be fully up to the standard of Dr. Trail himself. On the other hand, a very moderate amount of the plainer condiments—which any cook can add to suit herself—makes these (otherwise) hygienic dishes acceptable, even to perverted palates; wliile as respects health, food prepared in the ordinary way, can not begin to compare with this diet. It replaces the waste tissues of the body, it develops muscular strength, and it satisfies the nor- mal appetite ; it does not impair the digestive organs, neither does it clog the tissues, nor weai’ out the vital machinery. It sustains, it noui’ishea.

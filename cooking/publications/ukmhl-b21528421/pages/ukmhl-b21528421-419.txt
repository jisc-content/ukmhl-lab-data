And whatever you do, keep the sugar off it, for two good reasons; in the first jfiace it a\t11 start the juices, discolor the fruit, and destroy the fine peach flavor; and instead of “ fi*esh peaches and cream,” you will have a bowl of brown, sloppy material, as unsightly as it is insipid.

Plums of good flavor, if they are clean, ripe, and free from woiTus, are ready to be seiwed.

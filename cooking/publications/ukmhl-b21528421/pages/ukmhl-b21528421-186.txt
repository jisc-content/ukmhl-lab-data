HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. [PAET II. 1C8 tm’H once or twice—if tliey do not stick to the dish—to brown tlie sides more thorougldy. Take out a few minutes before seiwing. If sauce is requii’ed, use stewed or canned rasiiberries ; or you may make a dressing by stewing tail apples (not too ripe) a long time, until the sauce is smooth ; you can flavor the latter by stimng into it a little thick raspbeiTy juice, if you like. These dumplings are very good warmed over the next day, the cnist being more crisp and tender than at first. Baked dumphngs are drier than steamed, and the steamed ones better than boiled. Berry Dumplings.=|= Make a light ci'eam paste, as in the last recipe, mixing it very stiff ; then pinch off bits the size wanted, and roll each into a round piece, fully a quarter of an inch thick. Moisten the rim with a little cold -water, and put in the berries; bring the two edges together, making a long oval-shaped dumpling, and pinch well to secure the fruit. Space in the pan, so they will not touch each other, and bake from thirty to foi-ty minutes, or till the crust is done ; if they brown too fast on top, lay a paper over them. The small fruits re- quire a moderate oven ; if baked too much, the benies taste bitter. A good plan is to set the pan or dish containing the dumplings inside a dripping-pan with a trifle of boiling water in it, and bake till the paste is' done; the moisture from the water prevents the crust (and the berries beneath it) from cooking too fast. It would require about an horn’, if cooked in this way. Berry dumplings are good steamed, provided they cook fad, and without touching each other; it is best to -\\Tap each in a napkin before putting it into the steamer. They should be seri’ed as soon as done, with fruit or fruit juice— or if this is not relished, try cream and sugar.

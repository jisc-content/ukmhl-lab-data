Then, there were the “ brick ovens,” which are still used by the bakers ; they held fifteen or twenty pies and several loaves of bread, idl at the same time. Next to the “ bake- kettles,” these ovens baked the best pies and the sweetest bread that hungry mortal ever ate. But every housewife can not have a brick oven ; and so we are loaiting for some “ ingenious Yankee ” to invent a baking apparatus that shall give us bread equal to the best. Some attempts have been made in this direction ; but as yet, the article invented has been too expensive and too clumsy to be of much value. We need something that we can look into and see how the baking is progi’essing, if necessary; besides, one does not like to lift two or three bulky things, pull them apart, close again, set back in the oven, and then get burned into the bargain. The following are some of the utensils, large and small, that are convenient to have in the kitchen ; several of them are named and described in the Buckeye Cookery: Apple-Parer.—A small machine for paring apples ; costs less than a dollar, and rarely gets out of order.

Gra\w-Strainer.—Made of gauze wire, and can be used for other fluids than gi*avy. Tea-Strainer.—A small cup with a finely-perforated bot- tom ; useful to strain gruels and other Hquids. Wire Basket.—A basket of tinned wire, which may bo

HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. [part I 38 The Vegetables. Vegetables, while they must rank second as compared with fruits, have a greater value, dietetically considered, than is generally accorded to them. In the first place, they give bulk to our food, which is a matter of more importance than is commonly supposed ; and in the next place, they furnish a large amount of organic Jluids, which are digested and assimilated by the system. It is a mistaken idea which some persons have, that those foods are necessarily best which contain a large amount of nutrition in small bulk. They seem to forget that food, to be properly digested and appropriated by the organism, must contain something more than the mere nutritive particles ; there must be certain indigestible materials supplied to the intestinal canal, else the bowels, having httle to do, would lose them natural tone, and shrivel up, as it were, from mere inac- tivity. This is what actually happens, to a certain degree, when persons live too exclusively on white crackers, or fine flour bread, and other highly concentrated forms of food. G. Schlickeysen, a German writer, in treating of this subject, says : “ The value of the various articles of food consists not, as is generally supposed, in their chemical con- stituents, but in a variety of other conditions, which we shall here mention. In the first place, the food must con- tain the necessary amount of water to maintain the excre- tory processes through the breath, perspiration, and other- wise. Fruits contain an abundant supply of water, so that when they are eaten freely the drinking of water is almost entirely unnecessary ; and the vegetarians are really justifi- able when they say, ‘We drink fruit’; and they might also add, ‘AVe eat water.’” Horses, it is well knoA\TQ, can not live exclusively on grains ; they need straw as well—and even wood-shavings have been ^successfully substituted when straw could not be

PART III.] ME.VT PIES, ETC. 509 and remove the scum as it rises. You may slice in an onion, if you hke its flavor. Boil gently, keeping the pot closely covered, and when nearly tender hft from the Are, and take the meat out. Peel a few potatoes, say five or six, and either quaider them or cut into rather thick pieces; do not slice, as it makes them less meaty. Boil these in very little water till they are half done; then drain well, and keep covered in their own hot steam, till you are ready to use them. While these are cooking make a light cream paste, and line the sides of a bake-dish. Some cover the bottom also with paste, but it is better left bareâ€”and the sides the same, if you want all the crust very Hght and tender. When the meat is half cold puU out the bones, cut the larger pieces in two if there is need, and put a layer of it in the pan; ar- range the jiieces in a regular way, so that the pie will cut well. Add next, a hght layer of the parboiled potatoes; then more meat, then more potatoes; two thin layers of each will be enough. A few tiny bits of paste pinched off, may likewise be added. Thicken the liquor in which the meat stewed, by stining in a little white flour wet to a smooth paste with milk or water, and heating aU to a boil. Pour this gravy into the pie, Avhich should be about two-thirds covered with it; if there i? not enough, add boiling water. Then put on the top crust rolled to the thickness of half an inch, secure the edges, and prick well with a fork; cut a good cross-slit in the center, and set the pie in the oven. Bake from thirty to forty minutes, or till the cnist is done; cover, if it browms too fast. When taken out, cool ten min- utes, and serve in the bake-dish; this may be a granitized iron pan, tw'o and a half i?iches deep. Instead of all beef, you may use paid mutton or lamb; or chicken or squirrel, if preferred.

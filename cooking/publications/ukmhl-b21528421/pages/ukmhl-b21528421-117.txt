PART I.] HINTS ON COOKING. 99 slice, if they are whole ; if mashed, see that a second cinish- iu" leaves no lumps, and stir them up lightly with a fork. AMien the skillet is hot turn in the potatoes, and heat quickly till they are nicely browned on the bottom, but not scorched. Then with a knife turn them over, brown again, and dish for the table. Ten minutes will suffice for the browning ; and in ten minutes more, they should be eaten. To toast bread perfectly, cut it in even slices about half an inch thick, and brown, not too rapidly, over a bed of hve coals ; the bread should be stale to begin with. Turn it over before the slice warps too badly ; that is, if you are holding it on the end of a fork ; then toast the other side, and turn again if necessary. When done, the entire surface should be crisp, and an even chestnut brown. If the crust scorches a little, scrape off its buimt edges with a knife. To warm over mushes or grains, never add a particle of water, not even boiling ; tui’ii into a stew-pan, set where it wiU heat quickly, cover, and stir two or three times till the mu.sh is thoroughly hot. To warm bits of stale bread, dip the slices quickly into cold water, and lay them in a hot oven ten minutes, or till the surface is crisp, and the bread well heated through ; it will be as good as new—better, to most persons’ liking. Cold biscuits, split in two, dipped quickly into cold water, and tlien heated in the same way, are excellent.

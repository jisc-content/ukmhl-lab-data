HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. 566 [PAIIT III, prevent the possibility of an accident of this kind, a good plan is to shovel away the eaiiih that lies next to and out- side the cellar wall, forming a deep trench; then fill the latter with clay, packing or stamping it in, until it is per- fectly soHd. Continue this embankment, either with the clay itself, or clay and other earth mixed, till there is suffi- cient slope to caiTy the water some distance from the house; too far for it to soak into the ground adjacent to the wall below. Should a subterranean stream of water find access to the cellar, either by forcing its way through the walls, or up through the floor, it must be conducted away as rap- idly as it flows in, by means of thorough di*ainage. In making a cellar, be sure you have the walls and floor proof against rats; the walls should be built of stone, laid in lime or cement; and in very cold climates an inner wall of brick, with an air space between the two, is sometimes made. The floor should consist of a good layer of small stones—usually broken limestone—over which is poured a hard cement, the latter finished perfectly smooth. Let the compartments be so constructed as to admit of thorough venlilalion, and a reasonable amount of light; the number and dimensions of these wiU of course depend upon the size of the house. A dwelling with ten rooms may have in its basement a laundry, a furnace room, a cold air chamber (in connection with the fmmace), a fruit room (for canned goods), a cold room for vegetables and raw fruits, a dark apartment for potatoes, and a main thoroughfare; the dark room may be at the far end of the latter. In the finiit room there should be closets, each A\dth its tier of shelves, and a lock and key to its door; these closets should be ac- cessible to the light when the doors are open, but entirely daik when these are shut. The cellar like the living-rooms, ought if possible to have .a good supply of air, light and sunfihine, the morning sun being preferable; and all its comjrartments should be easy

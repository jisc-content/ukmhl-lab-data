HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. -158 [part III. if you have a liot one, and baste a few times until the steak is nicely browned ; thicken the gravy with a little browned flour, and i^our it over before serving. Or if the “hot oven ” is out of the question, you may simply stew the meat till done, thicken the gravy at the last, and pour it over. Roast Beet. The sirloin and rib pieces are the best for a roast; have the butcher remove most of the bone, and roll up the meat in the form of a “round,” fastening it well together with skewers. Begin by putting a clean skillet or jian on the stove, heat it till hot, and place the roast in it; when the under side is well seared and moderately browned, turn and brown the other in the same way ; two or three minutes will suffice. Then lay it in a dripping-pan without water, place in the oven, and heat rapidl}' tiU a cnist is fonned over the meat, which will imprison its juices ; now lower the temperature, and keep at a steady, moderate heat till it is thoroughly tender ; this you will ascertain by using the fork. No basting will be needed, and very little turning if the oven is an even one, and properly managed ; if the top heats too fast, cover it. It will require tAventy minutes to the pound, more or less, according to the quality of the meat and the way in which it is to be seiwed ; whether pretty rare, or well done. When finished, lift the roast from the pan, and remove t'le skewers by grasping the large end of each with a pair of pincers, giving it a sudden twist, and then pulling it out. If graA^y is wanted, pour off the fat from the drip- ping, and drain the red juices into the gravy-boat; or if too strong, dilute by pouring into the pan a little boiling Avater, after removing the gi-ease. Some thicken Avith a trifle of broAvned flour, and boil up a moment. Many prefer roast beef sliced cold, rather than served warm.

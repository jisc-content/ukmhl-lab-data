92 [PABT I. HEALTH IN THE HODSEHOLD. Two Me.\.ls or Three. The question is frequently asked, Avhether it is better to take two meals or three during the day. This would dejiend very much upon the habits of the individual, and somewhat upon the healthful conditions of the stomach. Some per- sons can digest three meals perfectly, while others find it hard to manage two comfortably. If the thii’d meal, light in quantity and simple in quality, and taken at an eai’ly hour, causes distress, then it would be well to try leaving it off. Sometimes a longer I'est wiU enable the stomach to do better work. Persons of sedentary habits combined with indoor life, usually find two meals sufficient, provided these can be arranged at iiroper hours. When two meals are taken, the breakfast should be served about eight o’clock, and the dinner at two ; this gives six hours between, and the after- noon not so long as to cause hunger. It wiU be found, however, that a great deal depends upon previous dietetic habits. Most persons who have been long accustomed to cither two or three meals, prefer not to make a change : the old way is more satisfactory. In ordinary cases, it probably makes very little difference whether tAvo meals or three are taken, provided no discom- foid is experienced ; usually Avdiere the digestion is fair, and the habits of the individual active, three are preferred. The third or last meal should be much lighter in quantity than the others, very simple in quality, and taken not later than six o’clock. This leaves three hours till bed- time, putting the latter at about nine o’clock, or half-past nine ; long enough for all the food to pass out of the stomach, and leave that organ in a restful state, ready for the night’s repose. If the digestive organs are not strong enough to accomplish this much easily, then it is plain that the third meal should be left off.

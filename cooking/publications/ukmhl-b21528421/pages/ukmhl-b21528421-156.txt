Stir in soda to sweeten, first dissolving it in a little boiling water, and using a level teaspoonful to a pint of sour milk ; then beat thoroughly; jiour immediately into an oiled bread-pan, smooth the top with a spoon, and bake in a quick oven twenty minutes. The cake must be scarcely more than half an inch thick, and must have a good crust, top and bottom. Success in making it, depends ujion the proper amount of scalding, the thorough beating, quick handling, and hot oven.

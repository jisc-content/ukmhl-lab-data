It is said that the difficulty hither- to experienced in preserving them, is due to not cooking long enough to expel the air; that beans, peas, corn, etc., to keep well, should be cooked till ready for the table, before they are put into cans.

Then prejiare an equal quantity of corn; with a sharp knife shave off the tip ends of the grains, and throw them away; then slice thin, cutting off nearly all the corn, and scraping out at the last, leaving the coarser part of the hull on the cob. Put it into a separate kettle and cook twenty minutes, or until done. Then turn the corn and tomatoes together, heat till they are boiling hot, and dip into glass cans; seal securely with wax; and if any little air-bubbles form in it, puncture them, and fill Avith more wax. When quite cold, wrap each can in brown paper, and set in a cool, dark closet. mSCELLANY. Storing for Winter Use.

37 THE FRUITS. PART I.] meaL I do not mean as the dessert of flesh-eaters, after they have eaten already enough of other food ; but I mean as a portion of the regular meal of vegetable-eaters, taken Avith tlieir bread, instead of flesh and butter ; for their break- fast and their dinner, but more sparingly at their third meal or supper, especiiiUy if this meal be taken late in the day. The tiaith is, that all cooked food, even under the best regulations, impairs in some degree the power of the stomach to digest uncooked substances ; and therefore, so long as we are accustomed to cooked food of any kind, we must be somewhat more careful in regard to the times when we eat fniit and other substances in their natural state. The digestive organs always in health partake of the general vigor and freshness of the body, and always share with it also in its weariness and exhaustion. Hence, as a general rule, so long as we are accustomed to cooked food, the stomach vill always digest fruit and other sub- stances in their natural state better in the early than in the latter paid of the day. Moreover, it is a truth of considerable impoidance, that fruit and other substances in the natural state arc digested with more ease and comfort when taken alone, at a regular meal-time, than when taken with any kind of cooked food, except good bread. While, therefore, human beings, and especially in civilized life, wholly disregard these physiological principles, and cat fruit with anything and everything else, and at aU hours of the day and night, they ought not to be surprised, and still less should they complain, if they suffer from their erro- neous habits. But nothing is more certain than that if human beings will in a reasonable degree conform to the physiological laws of their nature, they may cat almost every variety of esculent fruits which the vegetable king- don, produces, with entire safety and comfort.‚Äù

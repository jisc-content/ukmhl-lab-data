If after a 811014 time the benies rise to the top—and they frequently do—take each can in your hands and shake it gently, moving it back and forward tin all the fruit sinks to the bottom, or low enough to be en- tirely covered by the juice ; the benies will not rise a second time. I always pursue this plan, and my strawberries never spoil.” Tomatoes.—How to Can. Tomatoes are said by some to be hard to keep. Tliat the fault is in the management and not in the tomatoes, is shown from the fact that some persons have no trouble with them. The whole difficulty is caused by the retention of air-hubbles ; these, if present, can be detected by turning the jar upside down after sealing, when the bubbles will rise through the contents up to the sm'face. If you will care- fully expel these intruders before screwing on the covers, the tomatoes will keep perfectly. To do this, proceed as follows ; If the tomatoes are pretty rqie they will be quite soft when cooked, and the confined bubbles of air will be aU through them. As soon as they come to a boil, push down the top ones, so that all may be thoroughly scalded ; then fill the can, pass a silver spoon through the hot mass, moving it in such a way as to let the bubbles escape to the top ; these can frequently be seen through the glass, dovm the sides of the jar. Wlien jmu feel sure that they are all let out, pour in a little more juice if it is needed (the can should be filled almost to its brim), then wipe off the moist- ure, put on the dry rubber, and screw down the cover. After the jars have partly cooled, give the covers a second twist, then turn each one upside down, and see if any bub- bles ascend ; if so, it must be opened, the tomatoes heated again to boiling, and the can refilled in the same careful manner. A better way, however, if you can get the tomatoes, is

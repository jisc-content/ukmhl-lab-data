Staid the rice in the cold water, and cook foidy to fifty minutes, or until tender ; stir once or twice the first five minutes, lest it stick to the bottom of the vessel. Or you may cook on top of the stove in a covered tin basin or kettle, shaking it from time to time ; this is better than stirring, which breaks the grains, and makes the rice sticky. When about done dieat the milk almost to boiling, and stir it in gently, breaking the grains as little as possible. Cook a few minutes longer, and then put the rice into moulds or cups, and set it away to cool. Serve the next day—or it may be prejiared in the morning for supper—with a dress- ing of rich fruit (as stewed or canned plums), fruit sauce, or cream and sugar. Fresh dates, stirred in five minutes before the rice is taken from the fire, make a good addition; and they look well in the moulded mass.

The following is the recipe in full : Hard Graham Rolls. =|= If the Graham flour is of red wheat or coarsely ground, it must be sifted.* Before you begin to mix, have the oven heating, and the bread pans clean ; they need not be oiled. Take for mixing, the coldest water you can get—ice-water, if you have it; wet the flour with this, using a little at a time ; that is, pour in slowly and stir fast, so as to moisten the mass gradually, allowing no little puddles to form, to make the dough wet and sticky. It may take say two-thirds of a pint of water to mix a quaii; of flour ; though the quantity will vary according to grade of flour used ; the coarser it is ground, the more wetting will be needed. OoTitimie to mix until rather a soft dough is formed ; about as soft as you can well handle. If you get the dough too stiff, the bread wijl be dry and harsh ; if too soft, it Avil! be Avet and clammv. «/ Mix in a smooth boAvl of common yelloAV earthenware, if you have it; also do the kneading in it, as the dough Avill not stick to its side's.

93 PART I. ] DIETETIC RULES. Dietetic Eules. Eat slowly, masticating your food thoroughly before swallowing it. The first jirocess of digestion—called insali- vation—takes place in the mouth. Never eat when you ai'c mentally excited, or physically exhausted ; if you ai’e very tired, lie down and rest half an hour before going to the table. Neglect of this rule has caused many a fit of indigestion. Do not take vigorous exercise, either jihysical or mental, immediately after eating. Light exercise, as clearing up the table, washing dishes, or walking about the house or garden, facilitates digestion ; but heroic exertion, as run- ning, pulling, lifting, washing or wringing clothes, etc., retards it. A bath should never be taken directly after eating, and particidarly after a very hearty meal. A good rule is not to bathe for half an hour before, and for two hours after eating. Take youi’ food regularly, at stated intervals—not at any hour of the day ; and do not form the habit of eating be- tween meals. If anything is taken outside of the regular meal-time, ripe juicj" fruits, as apples or oranges, will usually occasion less disturbance than more heariy or substantial food. Let at least the gi’eater pari of each meal consist of plain food ; and do not continue to eat after the actual wants of the system are satisfied. Tlie supjier should be the lightest meal, both in quantity and quality ; and it ought to be taken at least three hours before retiring for the night. Do not wash do^vn the food with a fluid ; eat without drinking ; this will insure more thorough mastication and insalivation ; it will also help to preserve tlie teeth.

After what has already been said in regard to stimulants and stimulating drinks, it is hm'dly necessary to add, that the whole family of alcoholic beverages, even to the “ lighter drinks,” can find no favor with hygienists. They are all detrimental. Beer, for example, contains by volume, 5 to 8 per cent, of alcohol, sometimes a little more than this, and sometimes a little less. “ Adopting mean numbers, a pint (20 ounces) of beer will contain about an oimce of alcohol (Parkes.)” * Wine usually has 18 to 22 per cent. ; sometimes as high as 30 per cent. The habitual use of beer inclines to a plethoric habit, and the formation of loose, flabby tissue, with veiy little’ muscle. Moreover, the supposed good effect of aU stimulating di'iuks, comes from the rally- ing of the system to get rid of the alcohol, which is a iioison, an anti-vital or life-destroying substance. After the excite- ment or stimulation is over, there is a corresponding de- pression of the system, showing that vital force has been expended in the effort made to expel the offending thing. The stronger the beverage taken, or in other words, the larger per cent, of alcohol in it, the more marked Avill be the effects. It is sometimes asked, whether new cider is injurious as a beverage ; to which it must be replied, that the adjective “ new ” is rather indefinite. Right from the press, the juice is almost as bland and unstimulating out of the apple, as in it; but in a few houi-s there is a “ smack ” to it, and a foam, that tell of something stronger. Many a poor fellow has again been led into the downward path, simply by a drink of cider. The safe way, is to take the juice and the flesh of the fruit together. Any drink that contains even a small per cent, of alcohol, injures the blood ; it affects the red corpuscles, causiiig them to j>art with a portion o.f theii- water.

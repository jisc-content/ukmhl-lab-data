HASHES AND TOASTS. 531 PART III.J save the pieces of the meat itself. XTnfortunately, these mixed dishes are too often any thing hut creditable to the cook; they are neither clean, palatable, nor wholesome; and they are not in the least attractive. There is no good rea- son, however, why they should not be both clean and j>alat- able, and as wholesome as other meat dishes—in which case there would be less need to disguise their defects by the addition of pungent condiments. In making hashes, note carefuUy the following: 1. Put no meat into the hash that you would not willingly chew and swallow before it is minced; in other words, throw out all the hard, gristly, skinny bits; leave no big lumps of solid fat, and no stiingy, unsightly pieces. Make the hash either of good lean meat, or meat that is streaked more or less ■Ruth thin layei*s of well-made fat. 2. Slice every part yery thin; the lean meat always across the grain or fiber, and the fat pieces shave exceedingly thin, and chop fine. 3. Chop all well together, making the hash as fine as mince-meat; leave no large bits or “chunks” to contend with. 4. Have the stew-pan thoi’oughly clean, and your chop- ping-bowl the same. 5. If you i:)ut in meat juice saved from a roast, see that it is sweet; tjike the fat from the top, and all the sediment from the bottom of it; or if the meat is very lean, you may save just a little of the fat—or add a lump of fresh butter. 6. If cold potatoes are used, see that not a single one or juece of one goes in, that you would object to eating before it becomes part of the dish in hand. 7. In adding raw potatoes slice and chop them, and cook five to seven minutes in very little, water before turnmg them in with the meat. 8. Should bread be put in, trim off any burnt or half raw portions, if such there be, in or aroiind the loaf; grate it

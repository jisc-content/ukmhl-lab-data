Indeed, there is not a fruit that can fully take their place; though good grapes or peaches serve finely for a time. Let the breakfast, then, be a dish of raw apples or other ripe fruit: hard Graham roUs, to which may be added, loaf, com, or other bread; oat meal or other mush; baked or boiled potatoes, if they are liked; and any one of the fol-^ lowing fruits : baked apples, cranberry sauce, ajDples and quince, or other stewed fruit, dried or green; or you may substitute some kind of canned fruit; one variety is enough, particularly if there is raw fruit on the table, in addition. Occasionally, on cold mornings, you may if liked, stir n pound of fresh dates into the Graham or oat meal mush, five minutes before taking it from the fire. If compromise dishes are indulged in occasionally, select from the following : buckwheat cakes—these are good and wholesome, served with stewed or canned fruit—rice or com griddle-cakes, cream fniit gems, corn cakes, bachelor’s Johnny cake, Graham and com mufi&ns, milk toast., soft boiled eggs, eggs and toast, hash toast, stewed potatoes, com mush and milk, oat meal mush and milk, loaf bread (paid Graham) and fresh butter.

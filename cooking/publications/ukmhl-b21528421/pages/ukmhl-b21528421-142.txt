HE.VLTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. 121 [part II. reference. Thougli the best of rules may fail, without that rare counterpail, known as good management. 1. See that the yeast is good, and the flour the same. 2. If you like moist bread, scald a cup or part of a cup of flour, and cool to blood heat; then add warm water, the yeast, and just enough flour to form a batter that will drop (not jDour) from the sj^oon. 3. If bread rather dry and flaky is preferred, omit the scalding, and make the sponge a little thinner ; thin enough to pour from the spoon, but not too easily. 1. You may use for the S23onge, either Graham or white flour, sifted ; most persons jirefer the white, jierhaps from the fact that ordinary Graham is inferior in quality, and the sjjonge made of it ajiter to sour. Mix with water not warmer than blood heat, add the yeast, and beat till you have a smooth batter ; you may allow of good hoj) yeast, about half a cup to a quart of water. 5. Set the sjDonge in a warm jilace to rise, and do not let it get too light; in summer, you can leave it on the kitchen table. In winter, it is better to set it on the tank of hot water at the back of the stove—or if you have a range, 2Dlace on the shelf above it. G. Mix the bread as soon as the s2>onge is ready ; many a batch has been s2Doiled, through neglect of this rule. When the batter begins to send u2) little bubbles, the fermentation has commenced ; and by the time the whole mass looks light, and rather foamy, 2n’Oceed to mix. 7. In cold weather Avarm the flour a little, before you make the bread ; and if ordinary Graham is used, sift it; best Akron is fine enough Avithout. 8. Use for wetting, sim23ly the S23onge—no water. And for moist bread (Avhich has the stiffer S230nge, Avith scalded flour in it), mix very soft; entirely too soft for kneading. Simply work the mass well with the hands (in the tray), till it is thorouglily mixed ; then scrape the dough from your

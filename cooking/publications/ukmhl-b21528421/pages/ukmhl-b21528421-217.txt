Fruit of every de- scription should be handled with gi*eat care, as any bruise leads to rapid decay. That intended for cooking, ought not to be oveiripe; but if it is so already, it should be used as soon as possible, cooking rather quickly and not too long. Unripe fruits, on the contrary, are gi-eatly improved by cooking slowly, and for a longer time; this changes their starchy matter to saccharine, and makes them more palatable by practically rqjeniny them. Care should be taken in cooking fruit not to break up its organic structure, more than is actually unavoidable; it looks better to be whole, and it is better; the juices are cleai’er, and the flavors more fully retained. The same is true of canned fruits; the nearer whole they are, the better. Dried fruits, having been in reahty once cooked alread}% should pass through the next heating process pretty rapidly. Take, for examine, dried apples, or dried peaches; if dropped into boiling water and cooked rather quickly, care being taken to remove them from the Are the moment they are soft, they wiU be brighter in color and much finer in flavor, than if allowed to simmer slowly, and fall into a dark, shapeless mass; the juice should be mild, but rich in taste, and of a light amber color.

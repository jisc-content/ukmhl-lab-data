In the language of the physiologist, they represent the “j)hysio- logical detritis of the animtd organism.” Every drop of venous blood is laden with it; so much so, that if an animal is not well bled when it is killed, the meat is actually poi- soned by it. It is the presence of these waste products in meat, that renders it so cpiickly putrescent after life is extinct—unless some antiseptic is employed, which shall so change the natm-e of the meat itself as to render it no longer the same, even in nutiitive vtduo. It is the presence of these that causes the chyle formed from a diet of meat, and taken from the living vessels, to putrefy in a few hours ; while that which is elaborated from grains and other vegetable products, wiU keep for weeks with no material change. It is due to the presence of these that the perspiration, and indeed all the excretions of meat-eaters, are more offensive than those of persons living upon fruits and grains, and other ju’oducts of the soil. And just here we have an ex- planation of the fact that the flesh of most carnivorous animals is so disgustingly filthy and putrescent, that it is utterly unfit for human food. Their bodies are filled with this waste matter, working its way a second time out of the domain of animal life, and this time laden with stiU another portion of “physiological detritis.” Persons who live upon animal foods have need to pay specitil attention to bathing, change of underwear, and other habits of cleanliness, else their very presence wiU reveal the character of the materials out of which their tissues arc made. This is particularly true in the case of individuals whose sedentary habits prevent them from throwing off the waste matters fast enough to keep the body in a pui'e, whole- some condition. But there are reasons of a moral nature why meat is not the proper food for man. The habit of mui’dering animals

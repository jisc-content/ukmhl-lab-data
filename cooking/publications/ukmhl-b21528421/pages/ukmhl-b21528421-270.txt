252 HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. [PABT H. To Keep Turnips.—When huried deep in the earth, they will keep solid till March or April. To Keep Lemons. — Cover with cold water, changing it every week. This makes them more juicy. Herbs for Flavoring.—Gather on a dry day, just before, or while they ai-e in blossom ; tie in bundles, blossoms downward. AVhen perfectly dry pick off the leaves, pound, sift them fine, and cork up tight in bottles. Keeping Cabbages.—AVhen the weather becomes frosty, cut them off near the head, and cai'ry with the leaves on, to a diy cellar; then break off the outer ones, pack the cab- bages into a tight cask or box, stems upward, and when nearly full cover with the loose leaves; secui’e the box with a lid, against rats. A better way on the farm, is to dig a shallow trench, long enough to hold the cabbages, placing them Uvo deep. Put them in, heads downward, and cover with clean earth tiU the stalks (which must be upright) are half or two-thirds hidden. The cabbages should be buried as soon as pulled, and they ought to keep nicely tOl spring. To Keep Apples. — Apples are usually kept on open shelves, easily accessible, so that the decaying ones may be removed. They are sometimes packed in layers of dry sand, care being taken not to let them touch each othei’. AVhen they begin to decay pick out those that are specked, and stew; then put into self-sealing fruit cans, and use later in the season. Or you may pack in saAvdust, or any grain, as oats, barley, etc., so that they will not touch each other; or if the fniit is fine, wrap each ajDple in paper, and pack in boxes. To Keep Grapes.—Suspend from the ceiling by three cords, a strong barrel hoop, from which grape stems are hung by means of wire hooks attached to the sviall end, the other being sealed with hot wax; let each stem be free from contact with its neighbors. The imperfect grapes must be removed, and the room must be free from frost;

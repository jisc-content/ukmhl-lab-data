HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD, [part III. 562 To:matoes.—Tomatoes that are fresh and not overripe, are pretty firm to the touch; if soft, they are either too ripe, or too long- off the vines. In hot weather they get stale in a short time. Cucumbers.—Fresh cucumbers are hai-mless to a healthy stomach; see that they ai’e fu'm to the touch, and gi'een and while in color—not green and yellow.

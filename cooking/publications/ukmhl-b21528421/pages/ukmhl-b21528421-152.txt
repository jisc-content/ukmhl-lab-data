13 i: HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. [PART II. Ill lualviug bread from “risings” al\va3’’S set the sponge very early in the morning, in order to finish the baking in good season. Batter Loaf Bread. IVIake the ordinary sponge with tejiid water, yeast and floiu*, using half Graham and half white ; set this in a warm place. As soon as risen add sifted Graham flour, mixing with a spoon till a thick batter is formed ; too thick to drop from the spoon. Beat till there are no lumps, then pour into small bread-jians, well oiled, smooth the toj) with a knife, and set to rise ; when sufficiently light, bake in rather a hot oven about fift}' minutes. Another.—Make the same as before, using the Lockport flour both for sponge and mixing ; the bread is very sweet and fight, but pretty moist. Rye Bread. IMake the same as Leavened Graham Bread, using white flour for the sponge, and either rye flour or sifted rye meal for mixing. Or a better way, as the bread is not so apt to be sticky, is to mix Avith half rye meal, and the rest sifted Graham flour. Knead lightly, and not too long. A very sweet rye bread is made as follows : Make the sponge with tepid water and rye flour, and set it in a wann place to rise ; as soon as fight mix with rye meal or flour, to form rather a soft dough. Knead as little as possilfle, and mould into small loaves. Set these where they will keep warm, and AAdien fight enough bake in a moderate OA'en one hour. This is rye bread from “ rismgs”; the flour must be fresh. A handful of good Graham mixed with it, is an im- provement. Cut the day after the bread is baked. Rye Flour Brkad. 1 pint wann water. 3 cups rye flour—or enough for a smooth batter, cuj) good Imp yeast.

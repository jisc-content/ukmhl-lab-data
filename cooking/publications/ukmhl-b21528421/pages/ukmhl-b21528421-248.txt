Some of the raxo fmits, also, as rijie grapes, strawberries, peaches, etc., are very ac- ceptable to the sick.

Oat Meal Gruel. =|= Over three tablespoonfuls of fresh oat meal pour half a cup of cold water, and stir it well; add a pint and a half of boiling water, and stir thoroughly. Strain through a tea- strainer, or a coarse cloth; if neither is at hand, let the mixture stand two or three minutes; then drain off all the fluid portion, leaving the coai’ser part of the meal in the Oottom of the vessel. Set that which is drained off, over the fire, and stir till it boils; cook ten minutes, and skim. Oat Meal Gruel. Into one quart of boiling water, stir a tablespoonful of oat meid ; boil thirty minutes, and strain through a tea- strainer, or a thin (rloth.

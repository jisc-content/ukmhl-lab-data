Then form into rolls three to four inches long, and barely three- quaiders of an inch thick ; leave no dry Hour stic-king to tliem. Miike them out rapidly, and place a little apart in t'le pan ; then prick Avell with a fork, and jmt them in the oven ; it must be hot enough to brown nicely, but not to scorch. Bake about thirty minutes. "When done, the rolls should not yield to pressure between the thumb and finger ; and wlien taken from the oven, spread them out on a table to cool. They may be eaten for breakfast a little warm ; or you can lay them away cold, for dinner or sujDper. Stems. =1= jMould the same as hard rolls, except that you make the stems a little longer, and only about half the thickness; they will bake in from twenty to twenty-five minutes, ac- cording to the heat of the oven. They are very sweet and crisp when warm, but not as good as the rolls, after they are a few hours old. You may warm them over the same as hard rolls, breaking each into small bits before wetting. Stems and rolls can be made of rye meal, though they are not as good as the wheaten. Cold-Water Loaf Bread. The dough for this bread is mixed the same as for the hard rolls, already described. After fifteen minutesâ€™ good kneading, mould into small loaves, three to three and a half inches thick, and about five inches in length ; prick deejily with a fork, and place in a hot oven. The heat should be as even as possible, to avoid blistering or scorching. It will take from an hour to an hour and a quarter to bake the loaves thoroughly. This bread must not be cut tiU cold.

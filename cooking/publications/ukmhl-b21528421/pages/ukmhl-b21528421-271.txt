The simplest way to keep grapes is to place them in drawers holding about twenty-five pounds each, piling these one above another; or the drawers may be fitted into racks. The graj)es must be matui’e and per- fect. They do not freeze as readily as apples. Packing Veget.vbles. — For present use, they should be laid away carefully in a bin with a close lid (hung on hinges), so that the liglit may be excluded. To keep for a longer time, the best plan is to imll them on a dry day, cut off the tops, and trim and pack in clean baiTels or boxes; place in layers, with fine, clean moss between, such as is found in abundance in the woods. The moss keejis them clean and sufficiently moist, preventing shriveling of the roots on the one hand, and absorbing any excess of dampness on the other. "When moss can not be conveniently obtained, sand is a good substitute, but is more difficult to handle, and the vegetables do not come out of it so clean and fresh. The varieties which come to maturity late in the season are easiest to keep, and retain their flavor longest. Pure Water. Water, either for cooking or drinking, should be soft and pure. Carbonate of lime, and other inorganic substances often held in solution in it, are prohfic causes of chronic affections of the kidneys, and also of acute and chronic diseases in the alimentary canal. If pure water can not be had from wells, running springs, or larger sources, rain water can be caught in cisterns, and rendered pure liy means of a good charcoal filter. That known as “ The Kedzie ater Filter” (now manufactured by J. A. Ranney, Rochester, N. Y.), has given good satisfaction, and is comparatively in- expensive. River water usually contains not only a considerable per cent, of vegetable and animal matters, but more or less

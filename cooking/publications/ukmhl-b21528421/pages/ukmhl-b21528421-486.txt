To cook it, cover with hot or boiling water, skim if there is need, and boil very slowly till a fork will go through the thickest portion easily. This "wiLl require two houi’s or longer, according to size. Add more water, if it boils down too low; the tongue should be pretty well covered, while it is cooking. When done take it out, remove the skin, and set away in a cool place. Shce thin. Cold tongue is much liked for sand- wiches; these latter ai*e best made with good home-made Graham loaf. Beef’s Tongue with Tomatoes. Boh the tongue as in the last recipe. While it is cooking peel some ripe tomatoes, and shce very thin into a porcelain kettle; before you heat them stir in either a httle rolled cracker, or some fine dry bread-crumbs; just enough to thicken the tomatoes when done, to the consistency of or- dinary cream. Set where they will cook rather slowiy, until perfectly smooth; stir often; if the sauce gets too hot it wiU be spoiled. A few minutes before finishing, you may stir in a spoonful of cold meat gravy if you have it, or a small lump of fresh butter; ond when done, set where it will keej) hot. As soon as the tongue is thoroughly tender take it out, skin it, lay it on a hot platter, and pour the to- mato over. Slice as you seiwe it. A piece of beef rib, not too fat, and stewed slowly till done, is good served in the same w^ay. If you have neither the crackers nor the bread-crumbs, you may thicken the tomatoes with a little browmed flour, wet mth milk; or a cup of green corn is excellent; put this in twentv minutes before finishing.

136 HEALTH IN THE HOHSEHOLT). [PAKT H. Bake in a quick oven. You can take water for the sponge, if desired ; but the bread will require longer kneading. Or a plain rusk may be made in this way : Before mixing, add to the above sponge a little sugar finely rolled, and a beaten egg ; then proceed as before, not forgetting to knead well. Stale BeE/Vd. Cut the loaf in thick slices, dip these quickly into cold water, and lay in a hot oven ten to fifteen minutes ; long enough to heat through thoroughly. The outside should be crisp, but not scorched, and the inside light and dry. Bread warmed over in this way, is very good. Dry Toast. Take bread that is two or three days old, but not mouldy ; cut it in rather thin shces, and toast evenly before or over the coals. Do not hurry the process. Toast that is merely scorched on its surfaces, and underdone between them, is not fit for the table ; both sides should be an even bro^vn, the bread dry and crisp, but tender enough to be easily broken. If rather fresh, lay the slices on the oven grate a few moments, and dry slightly before toasting ; or, you may dry each surface, holding the shoe on the fork before the coals, and luâ€™own afterward. A very delicate toast is made as follows : Cut the slices nearly half an inch thick, from bread that is two or three days old. Toast with a fork very evenly, and not too slowly ; when one side begins to tinge turn the other, to keep the slice from warping. Graduate the heat and rej^eat the turnings, in such a way that each surface shall be an even brown, with a very thin layer of soft bread between. Good home-made Graham loaf, toasted in this way, is excellent. The moment they are ready, serve the shces sei^arately on a plate, as they are apt to sweat and become clammy, if i^iled one upon another.

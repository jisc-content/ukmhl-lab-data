Always save a jiint to staid with next time ; if you are starting for the first time, either make the self-working yeast (next recijie but one), and start with that, or else with bakers’ yeast, or good hop yeast, which is the same thing. Never use brewers’ yeast, as it gives the bread a strong, bitter taste ; and bread raised with it is apt to sour. Hop Yeast. 4 tablespoonfuls gi-ated potato. 2 “ white flour. 4 “ sugar. 2 “ salt. 1 tablespoonful ginger. Mix the above ingredients with cold water, to form a stiff paste. Then put a double handful of hops into two quarts of boiling water, boil ten minutes, cool to lukewarm, and strain out the hops ; poui- this water over the paste, stir till tlie whole is well mixed, and boil three minutes ; when the fluid is cooled to lukewarm, stir in a pint of good yeast, and l)eat well. Let it stand in a warm room till it ferments ; then pour into a stone or glass jar, tie a clean cloth over it, and set it in the cellar or other cool place. If you have no suitable place to keep it, make it into cakes, as follows : Stir in fine corn meal, until a stiff dough is formed ; then roll to about a quarter of an inch in thick- ness, and cut into small cakes. Set these in a very moderate oven, or in the sunshine, and when fully dry and cold, tie them in a paper sack to preserve their strength, and hang in a dry place ; they will keep several weeks, in cool weather.

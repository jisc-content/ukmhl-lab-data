571 PRACTICAL HINTS. P.VET III.] thus, sweet potatoes (because of their sweetness) go Avell with tomatoes, their uatunxl opposites; while roast meat or baked beans, call for sour oranges, or spinach with lemon juice.—But for further hints on this subject, the reader is referred to the chapter on Food Combinations. Among the A’arious articles of food given, it will be seen that there is at least one that is expected to appear regularly, at both breakfast aud dinner; viz., the hard Graham roll. It may be eaten warm for breakfast, and cold for dinner; and should there chance to be a few rolls left over, they will not come amiss at supper. The ripe fruits spoken of below, may be apples, peaches, peiu’s, plums, gi’ai^es, chenies, currants or berries. Apples are best eaten at bre;xkfast, and at the beginning oi the meal; grapes and cherries also do their best service eaten in the same way. In warm weather, the acid fruits are usually preferred; but when the weather is cool or cold, and the appetite keen, sweet or dried fruits are in some respects more satisfactory; some of the latter, however (as peaches or prunes), are too hearty for supper. Potatoes may or may not appear at the breakfast table; some parsons are better without them at this meal. Mushes and gi-ains are as a rule more easily digested at breakfast or dinner, than at supper; they may be served with or Avithout a di’essing of fruit. Breakfast.—(Spring or Summer.) Sunday. Kipe fruits, as apples, peaches or grapes. Hard Graham rolls; Graham loaf bread, or dry toast. Corn meal, or farina mush. Baked potatoes, peeled or unjjeeled. Stewed sweet cuiTants, or canned pears. Compromise.—Soft boiled eggs.

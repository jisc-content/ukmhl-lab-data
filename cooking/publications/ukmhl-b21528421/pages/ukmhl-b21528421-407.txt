PART III.J 880 OTHER DISHES. Apple Cream. Select fine apples, fair and smooth, and rather taid; wash well, trim out the blossom ends, and either bake or stew in a little water, till cpiite soft. Remove the skins, cores and seeds, mash till smooth or rub through a haii’ sieve, and sweeten while hot; when cold, stir into a pint of the sauce half a cup of good cream; beat till light, and serve. Apple Ice. Take apples of a good rich flavor (as the Spitzenberg, or bellflower), grate them fine, sweeten to taste, and freeze. T’he ice is said to be delicious. Pears, peaches, or rpiinces, may be j:>repared in the same way; or you may mix apple and quince together, and then sweeten and freeze. These frozen mixtures can not be rec- ommended as particulai-ly good for weak stomachs. Apple Snow. 6 tart apples—pippins or bellflowers. 2 cups sweet milk. I cup white sugar. 3 eggs, yolks and wdiites separate. jMake a boiled custard of the yolks, millq and half the sugar, and cook till it thickens; when cold, pour into a glass dish. Beat the whites and the rest of the sugar to a stiff fi’oth; then peel the apples, gi*ate fine, and stir them imme- diately into it, to prevent their changing color; beat till very light, and heap the “ snow ” upon the custard. Serve as soon as possible, after making. Apple Float. 1 pint tart apple sauce. 1 “ sweet milk. ^ cup white sugar. 3 eggs, yolks and whites separate.

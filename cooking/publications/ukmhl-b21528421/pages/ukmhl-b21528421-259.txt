241 PART n.J CANNING FRUITS, ETC. Now set the jar to one side, and proceed to fill anotlier; if you have an assistant, let her adjust the rubber and cover while you fill the next. After the jiU's are cool enough to handle, screw the tops again; and when fuUy cold, give them another twist. Indeed, the best plan is to let them stand at least twenty-four hom-s, and tighten from time to time. Last of aU, -wipe them clean Avith a damp cloth, and set away in a dark closet; or if you have no dark place, wrap each can in brown paper, to exclude the light; the cooler the place the better, provided the fruit does not freeze. Examine it carefully, every few days for the first two or three w'eeks, and occasionally afterward, to see if it is keeping well. If mould appears, the can should be oj^ened and the fruit used, cai’e being taken to remove the mouldy portion. A plan that is said to be perfect (and it is easier, certain- ly, than the one just given), is the following : Wring a loose crash towel out of warm or tepid Avater, leaving it pretty wet; fold it seA’eral thicknesses, and either lay it in the bottom of an empty basin, or on the corner of the table, close to the fruit-kettle. Place the jar on the folded toAvel, adjust the funnel to its mouth, and then put into the can a long silver spoon which has just been dipped into tepid water ; proceed to fill AAuth the fruit, pouring it in slowly at first. When the jar is full wipe off the moisture, adjust the rubber, and then put on the cover as before. Some fill without the spoon, relying simply on the wet towel; but it is sfl/cr to use the former, as it is a good medium for con- ducting and diffusing the heat. An iron spoon would do just as well, if it did not discolor the fimit; some use a Avire or knitting-needle. A very good plan when one has the proper appliances, is to fill the cans Avith fruit, adding Avater to make it eulh- ciently juicy ; then heat Avith steam to thoroughly expel the air, and seal.

HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. 3G6 [part III. Raspberry and Curilvnt Cream. 4^ 1 pint sweet cream. 1 cup currants, stripped from tlie stem. 3 cups raspberries, red or black. § cup sugar. 2 eggs—whites of. Mix the raspberries and currants together, and make the same as the last; let the cream, eggs, and juice, all be as cold as possible ; and use a whip-chui-n, if you have one. Bhvckberry and Other Creaais. Blackben-y cream is made like raspberry ; and huckle- berry cream the same. Cherries, if carefuUy picked over and seeded, may also be used, the very acid varieties re- quiring more sugar—say three-fouiihs of a cup to a pint of seeded fruit. Lemon Cream. 1 pint sweet cream. 1 cup sugar. Juice of one lemon. 2 eggs—whites of. Put the cream, lemon and eggs into the ice-chest till they are very cold ; then beat the whites, add them to the cream, and whip well together. When about half done whipping, beat in the lemon juice (sweetened with the sugar), a little at a time, for fear of curdling the milk ; and when done, serve immediately. In this and other prepared creams, condensed milk diluted with two or three times as much water, is often used instead of ordinary cream. Orange Cream. Select oranges of fine flavor, and not too ripe ; then make the same as lemon cream, using less sugar by about one- third. Take two oranges to a pint of cream.

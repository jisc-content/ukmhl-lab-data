Take one cup of warm potato, finely mashed, and soften it with a cup of tepid w'ater ; then stir in Graham flour un- sifted, until a gem-batter is formed. Beat weU, di-o^i into hot gem-pans, and bake in a good even oven, thirty to forty minutes. HvGiEjac Rusk Crumbs. Take bits of unleavened wheaten bread, and dry them thoroughly in an oven hot enough to brown slightly, but not to scorch. Then break them in a moidar, and grind in a coffee or hand-mill. Or you may take stale Graham loaf, grate it, brown in the oven, and when brittle roU fine. Tliis is “hygienic nisk crumbs.” Serve with fruit juice (some use milk), allowing it to soak a few minutes before it is eaten. Parched wheat may be ground and eaten in the same way. Corn Preparations. It is sometimes asked whether bread made from corn meal is wholesome, and whether the yellow or white meal is best. Com bread is rather hearty in warm weather ; in winter, and moderately cool weather, it may be used even by patients, two or three times a week or oftener, without detxlment. As to quality of meal, tlie corn best fitted for bread is the genuine “flint the “ dent ” corn is so soft in structure, that any bread made from it is apt to be gluey and heavy. This is particularly tnie of steamed breads. The real “ golden,” which is made of flint corn of a deep yellow color, and is common in Eastern cities, is veiy sweet and good. But by far the best meal in our Western markets, both for bread and mush, is that made from the “ white flint ” com. A poorer quality, common in the West, is of a pale yellow color ; and a still poorer, wliich is a bluish white, is not fit for bread.

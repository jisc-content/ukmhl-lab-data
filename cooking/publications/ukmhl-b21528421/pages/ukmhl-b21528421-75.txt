ScLlickeysen, in speaking of the use of butter, eggs and cheese, remarks : “ These cause an excess of fat in the system, and an offensive, slimy condition of the mucous secretions in the mouth and nose, quite ajiparent to those who, contrary to theii* usutil habit, eat of them. Their effects are often aj^parent also in eruptions upon the skin, especially upon the face.” Eggs are pretty generally conceded to be a “ bilious diet ”; and if eaten freely at each meal for a few weeks, the whites of the eyes usujilly show the presence of bile.

In other words, the saccharine substances con- 3*

The preceding chapter has told how to make “ perfect bread”; the present one gives some of the best methods of making imperfect bread. The question is sometimes asked, “ "Which is worse for the stomach, yeast or soda ? ” Perhaps it is enough to know that l)oth are bad. The yeast—which is said to consist of vegetable infusoria—is the product of a rotting process, leading step by step to actual putrefaction ; and as such, it destroys certain proximate principles in the grains in which it is used. In the early stages of fermentation the sac- charine matter is decomposed, and carbonic acid and alcohol are given off ; as it proceeds, the starchy substances are destroyed, and acetous acid or vinegar is formed. Another step in the downward grade destroys the gluten, and brings the later stages of putrefaction or decay. So that yeast bread, however weU made, is deprived of a part of its nutrient material; and poorly made, it is intolerable, even to the taste. Soda, on the other hand, is an inorganic substance, and is used with an acid, forming a third substance, also inorganic, and therefore indigestible ; this remains in the bread, and renders it unwholesome. Bi-carbonate of soda, the salt generally employed in bread-making, is commonly used in connection with tartaric acid—or “ cream of tartar,” Avhich is a bi-tartrate of potassium. In the reaction that follows,

PART I.] THK VEGETABLES. 41 There ai'e “ families,” it is true, the member-s of which show their kinship by a similaiity of flavor and texture ; but out- side of these the differences or individualities are strongly mai’ked. For example, what is more imlike in apiJcarance and taste than a cabbage and a sweet potato, or a beet and a butter bean ? Some of these vegetables are of less value as foods than others, theii’ dietetic impoidance seeming to consist more in the individual constituent that is added to the general food product, than to the merit that belongs to them separately considered. To illustrate : common lettuce does not seem to possess any extraordinary dietetic propeities ; but after a long winter, when everybody has tired of bread, beans and potatoes, to say nothing of “ beef, mutton and ham,” a fresh bunch of tender lettuce with a dressing of lemon juice, is to most persons really inviting. So is a dish of young peas, cauliflower or sjiinach. Something green is wanted after the old sameness of dry dishes, and it would be a great misfortune if, for even one season, the gardens shoidd fail us. Vegetables and fruits are so unlike in their individual flavors and characteristics, that they should not, as a rule, be eaten together, or at the same meal. A good plan is to confine the vegetables to the noon-day rep.ast, letting the morning and evening meal be made of fruits and cereals variously prepared. Ordinarily, these latter are quite suffi- cient for breakfast, though a dish of baked potatoes would not be a bad accompaniment. The potato is so unobtrusive in its nature, that it rarely creates disturbance eaten with any other food. Like the grains, it “goes well” with either fruits or vegetables, and it is about the only vegetable of which as much can be said. Not that well people, Avho scarcely know they have a stomach, might not manage a meal very well with miscellaneous combinations, but feeble stomachs must either discriminate, or suffer. For a fuller

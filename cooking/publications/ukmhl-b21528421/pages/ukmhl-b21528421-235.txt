For grapes, plums, blackberries, etc., take a ivooden pad- dle to stir or push down the frait Avhen it threatens to boil over ; iron spoons discolor it, and should not be used. Grape Juice. =|= Simple gi'ape juice, strange to say, is a thing of compar- atively recent manufacture. In St. Louis, where for many years grapes have been grown in great abundance, this ex- cellent beverage was unheard of until about the yeaiâ€™ 1872, when it was prepared by the hygienists. AMien the grapes are at their best for eating, they are just right for juice.

Add no sugar. The less the fruit (or juice) is cooked, the brighter the color and the better the flavor ; like all small or tender fruits, it is injured by long or rapid boiling ; the color be- comes dark, and the fine fresh flavor is gone. After you have done straining and squeezing, put aU the li(|uid l)ack into the kettle, let it come slowly to a boil, and then remove from the fire or seal in cans.

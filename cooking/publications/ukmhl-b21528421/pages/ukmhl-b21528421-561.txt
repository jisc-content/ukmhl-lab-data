Omelet. Beat separately the yolks and whites of three eggs, the former just till they are smooth, and the latter to a stiff froth. Stii‘ into the yolks half a cup of milk—new, if you have it; some add a sprinkle of chopped parsley"; then stir in the beaten whites; oil a frying-pan, heat till it is hot, and pour in the omelet.

The moment the omelet is done enough, slip the knife under one side, turn adroitly, folding one half of it over the other, and slide to a hot plate.

Then stir in the whites, beating well, and bake on two small griddles, well oiled and hot. As soon as sufficiently cooked fold each omelet on itself, and (if necessary) set in the oven a moment at the last; if not quite done, they will fall. Some omit the flour; and the moment the omelet is done enough fold it twice, forming a sort of roll; in serving, cut across it. Asparagus Omelet.

Stir all together, and turn the omelet into a pan, Avell oiled and hot; shake, as it forms or thickens at the bottom, and loosen w'ith a knife or cakc-turner, if it adheres. Fold

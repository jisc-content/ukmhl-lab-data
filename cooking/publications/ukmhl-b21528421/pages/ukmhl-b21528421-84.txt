HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. [part L 66 and serous secretions are rajDidly increased in tlie gastric cavity, to protect the mucous membrane from its acrid and iiTitating qualities ; much distress is experienced by the individual, and nausea and vomiting generally succeed, as an instinctive means of expelling the offending cause from the vital domain ; and in all cases, considerable por- tions of it are driven tlirough the pyloric orifice in the intestines, where great irritation is also produced by it, and it is soon expelled from the bowels, with large quantities of serum secreted from the blood to dilute and flood away the ii’i’itating substance, and thus protect the living parts on which it acts, and the vital interests of the system generally, from its pernicious effects. hen salt is taken into the stomach in small quantities with food, the residt is somewhat different. If the stomach is perfectly healthy in aU its properties and powers, however small tlie quan- tity of salt, it is immediately detected by the undepraved sensibilities of the organ, and a vital reaction takes place corresponding in energy and extensiveness ^vith the quan- tity and strength of the offending substances, and by the nmcous and serous secretions which are promptly pro- duced, the parts are protected, and the salt is so diluted as to be rendered no longer very dangerous to the delicate vital properties of the tissues on which it may act. It is therefore not expelled from the alimentary cavity by vomit- ing nor jiurging, but is taken up in a state of solution by the absorbents of the stomach, and mingled with the blood of the portal veins ; not in any case nor degi’ee, however, to supply the wants of the vital economy, l)ut to l)p expelled from the vital domain throitgh the kidneys, lungs, skin and other depurating organs of the system, as a foi'eign substance. By the long and habitual use of this substance, however, the organic sensibihties of the stomach, and of all the other parts of the system, become so much impaired by its qualities, that they no longer make

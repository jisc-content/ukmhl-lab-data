177 VEGETABLES. PART II.] Sweet Potatoes.=|= In buying, see that they are not covered over with little sprouts; these are caused by heavy rains, which have start- ed the potatoes to “growing”; in this condition they are injured in flavor, and inclined to be w'atery. Sweet potatoes are best either boiled or steamed, and then browned in the oven. Fii’st, wash and trim them, chpping off black or straggling ends; should any be partly decayed, throw them out. If you boil, use as httle water (boding) as will cook them; this makes them drier and sweeter; then cook rapidly, until a fork will go through them rather easily. When done, strip off the skins; if be- neath these, and about the ends of the potatoes, you find a dark substance deposited (due to wet weather), remove that also, as it is very indigestible. Place in a hot oven, and brown thoroughly about twenty minutes; or if rather wet, they may remain in half an hour. If you steam before finishing in the oven, cook till the potatoes are tender, and then peel and brown as before. The chief error to guard against in cooking this vegetable, is in boiling or steaming it too much, making it watery; or in taking it out before it is faii’ly done, which renders it harsh and unpalatable. Browned Sweet Potatoes. =|= Take sweet potatoes left from the previous meal, and if they have not been peeled remove the skins; then mash fine, spread on a pie-pan, and brown in a brisk oven from fifteen to twenty minutes; they are quite as good as fresh. Another way is to slice instead of mashing, and then browm; or you may lay them in the oven whole, after re- moving the skins. 8*

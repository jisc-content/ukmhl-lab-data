In making loaf bread, the floiu* should in cold weather be slightly warmed before mixing, and the dough set to rise in a wooden tray or thick earthen crock—never in a tin vessel, as the dough is apt to chiU from draughts of cold air. Bread to be good and wholesome must be thoroughly baked, having the crust nicely browned, but not scorched ; and it is better baked in pans that have closely fitting rovers; these confine the escaping vapors about it, and by preventing evaporation make the bread much sweeter. Mix all pastries lightly and quickly, gathering the mass together without kneading ; have the materials as cold as possible, and either bake as soon as mixed, or lay the paste into a refrigerator. Never make pies or cakes till the oven is ready for them ; roU your pie-crust pretty thin, staid with a brisk oven, hot enough to brown without blistering or scorching, and moderate the heat as the baking proceeds. Be sure the bottom crust is well done before taking the pies from the oven. This for cream pastry. Pies made of apjiles that are under-ripe and their crust shortened witli butter (which, however fresh and sweet, is always less wdiolesome than cream), are improved by bfvkiug an hour and a half in a very slow oven.

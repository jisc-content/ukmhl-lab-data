POOD, INTELLECT AND MORALS, 81 fART I.] “ But,” says one, “ why speak of these things in a cook- book ? The temperance hall is the place to discourse upon the evils of alcohol.” To this query there ai’e two answers ; in the first place, it is a lamentable fact, that King Alcohol does not confine himself to the highways in society. He appears in private circles, takes a seat at the domestic hearth, and makes himself welcome at table. His fingers have “ touched ” the delicate puddings, the rich jDastries, or other fine desserts ; he comes with the wines, the pale sheiTies, and brandies, that are used in preparing these dishes.

But this is not the whole of the matter ; when King Alcohol comes to our firesides, and sits down at oui’ tables, he is met by a multitude of his own “blood relations”; some near of kin, some more distant. And the peculiarity of this numerous household is, that if you enteiiain a single one of them, that individual never stops till he brings all the others with him.

Then are introduced the spicy pickles, pungent sauces, and other condiments that set the blood on fire, and inflame the passions. Verilv, the wives and mothers of tliis country, arc them-

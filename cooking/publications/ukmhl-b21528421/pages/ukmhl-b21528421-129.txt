PART II.] Ill UNLE.WENED BREAD. These crisps will keep for days in a dry place ; and if heated over in the oven, they will he as brittle and tender as when first baked. Scotch Oat Cakes. In Scotland, the oat meal cake is made and baked as fol- lows : Take oat meal, not too fine, and wet it with water that is nearly or quite boiling. Mix well together, making the dough as smooth as possible, and roll out as in the jire- ceding recipe ; but instead of using the cake-cutter, make one large round cake, and cut it into quarters. Place these on a griddle (the griddle in Scotland is supplied with a bail), and hang it over the fire ; when nicely browned on the under side, lift from the griddle, and toast the ujqier side to an even brown, before the coals. These ai*e essen- tially the same as the oat meal crisps. Oat Meal Bannocks. Pour boiling water over fine oat meal, scalding it thor- oughly, and stir with a spoon to form a batter considerably thicker than for Graham gems ; so thick that it will scarcely tlrop from the spoon. Tlien oil a bake-pan, set it on the stove till hot, and jiour the batter into it to the depth of about half an inch. Separate the cake into four quarters with a knife, set the pan in an oven moderately hot, and bake from twenty to thirty minutes, Avithout scorching. ]\Iusii Rolls.=|= Take any cold mush made of corn meal, Graham or rye flour, oat meal, samp, or farina, and knead into it enough Graham flour to form rather a soft dough ; just stiff enough to handle with plenty of flour. If too much or too little flour is worked in, the bread Avill not be good. Make into rolls three to four inches long, and nearly an inch thick ;

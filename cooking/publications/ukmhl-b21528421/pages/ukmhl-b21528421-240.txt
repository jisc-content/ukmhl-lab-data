Ilasjilierries and currants are best stewed together; and a few dried black- berries stewed with dried apples, are said to be good. Prunes and Plums.4= Take one measure of tart dried plums, and three or fom’ of jirunes; then look them over carefully, wash well, and stew together till done; they will cook in liidf an horn’. The sauce made from this combination is rather tart, but very agreeable to the taste. Allow thi-ee pints water to a quart of mixed fruit; no sugar is needed. Sweet Curr.ants.=|= Inspect very closely, as there are often small flinty stones packed in with the fruit; break uji the lumps that stick to- gether, and throw out wdiat is imperfect. Put the currants into a basin of water, wash with the hands, rubbing well, and lift them out into another vessel; this wdll allow an}’- sediment or stones to sink to the bottom. Then turn them into a colander, and ivaali thoroughly, till clean; put them into a fruit-kettle, add a moderate quantity of boiling water (too much in the staid weakens the flavor), and stew gently, thirty-five minutes. If not juicy enough, put in more bod- ing water, just before finishing. A good rule is the follow- ing: To a quart of currants, picked over and w’ashed, add to start with, tw^o quarts of boiling water, and cook moder- ately twenty minutes; then add one pint more (boiling), and stew fifteen minutes longer. You may try them once or rtvice, toward the last; and the moment they are tender, remove from the fire; too much cooking spoils them. Let them stand till perfectly cold before sending to the table. If well managed the juice Avill be clear, but rich in color and fine in flavor. This is an excellent sauce for mushes, and particularly good for corn mush.

428 HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. [part III. Turnips. These vary so much in size, age and variety, that it is hard to give a rule as to time of cooking. The common white kind cooks in less than half the time that is ie(^uiied for Swedish, or ruta-baga turnips; the latter need all of two hours* boiling ox* steaming. ^\hite tuinij)s, if veiy young, will sometimes cook in thii'ty minutes; but if old, an hour OX’ longex’ is genex’ally necessax’y. A safe way, howevex, is to start them ixx good season, and test with a fox’k toward the last; they are better cooled to lukewarm, before serving. Wash and peel them, rejecting all that are pithy, or coarse and stx'ingy; a single bitter one will sometimes spoil the whole mess. Cut them into slices of half an inch; then place in the bottom of the pot an old saucer, invexded, or a small pie-pan, put ixx the turnips, and cover with boil- ing water; have about enough to cook thexn, leaving vexy little to drain off. Boil rapidly, and watch that the pot does not go dxy; if this happens, you will lose the sweetness of the turnips; and if cooked too long, they will turn red and taste strong. You may cook in a closed steamer, if you like; in which case, steam rapidly till tender. As soon as a fox'k will pierce the slices easily, set up the steamex’, turn them into a por- celain kettle or other flat-bottomed vessel, and drain in all the liquox'. Place over the fire, and when the water is about all evaporated mash with a potato-mashex*, stir in a few spoon- fuls of cream, and dish for the table. The Swedish turnip must not be cooked too dxy; it is better left pretty moist, before you stir in the cream. Boiled Carrots. There is a little carrot called the “ Early Horn,'*’ that matures in July, and boils tender in an hour. Winter car- rots gx’ow larger, and take longer to cook; they are used

483 POULTRV. PART III.J Stewed Chicken. Cut the chicken into joints, drop into a pot, and cover with boiling water; or if the fowl is old, with cold water. Heat slowdy to a boil, and skim; then stew gently from one to two hours, or until tender. Twenty minutes before fin- ishing, add a few new potatoes with the skins slii)ped off; or old ones peeled and not too lai’ge, will do. Should more water be needed, add it boiling hot. If dumplings are liked make a light cream paste, pinch off in smjill bits, and di'op these in when the potatoes begin to bod; cover closely, and cook fifteen to twenty minutes, or tiU the dumplings are done. Then dish the chicken, potatoes and dumplings into a hot tureen, fit on its Hd, and set where it will keep w'ann; thicken the gravy in the pot with a little cream and flour, let it boil up a moment, and pour it over the stew. Instead of potatoes and dumplings, you may add half a cup of rice, cooking it foidy to fifty minutes; no other thickening wfill be needed. Chickens Stewed Whole. Prepare and stuff two chickens as for roasting, and sew them uji cai’efuUy; you can tie the necks with clean wrap- ping-thread, after filling the crops. Put them into a pot, add nearly or rpiite a pint of boiling water (more, if the chickens are not young), cover with a closely-fitting lid, and bring very slowly to a boil. Skim, cover again, and sim- mer, still slowly, for an hour and a half, or till thoroughly tender. Little if any fiUing uii should be needed, promded you stew slowly; and very little gravy must be left in the pot, when the fowls are taken out. Thicken what there is with a trifle of browmed flour, let it just boil, and pour it over the chickens. If prefeiTed, you may stew without stuffing.

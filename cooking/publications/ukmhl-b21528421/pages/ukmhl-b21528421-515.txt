Now fill up with the gravy, and lay on a toj:> cnist rolled half an inch thick; prick well with a fork, cut a lai’ge cross-slit in the middle, and bake in a moderate oven about forty minutes ; cover, if there is danger of scorching. If preferred, you can have a top cinist only, and not bake quite so long. FISH. Fish is not more wholesome or nutritious than other meats; indeed, good beef or mutton is to be preferred to either “ fish or fowl.” Fowls, as already stated, are not as clean-feeding as cattle and sheep; and the fishes, if not car- nivorous in their habits, are at least pis(yivo7'ous, since they eat each other. Their food is relatively of a low grade, and their organization the same; hence*>their strong odor, and the coarse and unnutritious quality of their flesh. There is a great difference in the kinds, however, some (in the troji- ics) being actually poisonous—owing, no doid^t, to the nature of the food they subsist upon. After a meal of fisli, or of cei-tain Avild fowls, there is often experienced Ihii'st or feverishness, due of course, to the “ nonusable ” substances contained in the aliment, and which the system is in haste to get rid of. On the other hand, cattle and sheep, and in- deed all domestic animals, are more liable to be affected by disease, than are any of the wild animals, the birds of the air, or the inhabitants of the great waters, including the “vasty deep.” It follows, therefore, that those who live upon a flesh diet, will have to choose between evils. Fish not absolutely fresh, makes very indifferent eating; in selecting, see that the flesh is firm and hard, the fins stiff, and the scales bright; the gills should be a clear red, and the eyes not sunken, but full and prominent.

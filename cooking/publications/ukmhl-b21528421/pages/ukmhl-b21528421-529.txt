PART m.J 611 MEAT PIES, ETC. Cold Me^vt Pie. Ta]ie cold beef, mutton or lamb, or some of each, left from a previous roast or stew; stiiptlie meat off the bones, rejecting any haaxl, gristly, or imperfect iiieces, and also the superfluous fat. Where the fat and lean are well mixed cut them together, in slices about a quarter of an inch thick. The other portions you may cut into inch or half-inch lengihs, making a sort of coaiâ€™se hash; the pieces of solid fat should, if used, be minced very fine, and only as much of the best taken as is needed; then add some cold potato, not sKced, but cut in small bits. Having stripped the bones crack them, and put them into a stew-pan with the other poorer parts, not including the fat; if there is a remnant of cold steak left over, chop it fine, and add with any of its gravy to the contents of the pan. If the flavor of onion is liked, slice it in with the rest; then pour in cold water to nearly cover, and heat slowly to a boil. Skim if there is need, simmer an hour, and strain out the liquor, adding to it any cold gravy left from a previous roast or stew; thicken with a little browned flour wet with milk or water, stir well, heat to a boil, and set off to cool. In the mean time mix a light cream paste, or a j)otalo paste thnt you can roll out; the recipes for these have already been given. Then fill a bake-pan, one that is wide and shallow, with the meat and potato; the dish should not be more than two inches deep; pour over the made gravy, of which there should be enough to cover half or tAVO-thirds of the pie, roll a crust half an inch thick, lay it on, and pinch down closely at the edge. Prick well AA'ith a fork, cut a cross-slit in the middle, and bake in a good oven thirty minutes, or till the crust is done. Another Avay, requiring less woi'k, is to cut the meat in larger pieces, say tAVo inches long, and the Avidth of your finger; then mix Avith the potato, and proceed as before. A

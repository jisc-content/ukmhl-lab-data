Another way, is to substitute thin cream or new milk for the hsh-liquor; after mixing with the butter and flour, heat just to a boil, but no more. Still another sauce is made by stining into the hquor the butter and flour rubbed to- gether, and then adding half a cup of milk in which you have boiled a shallot, and a head of celery chopped fine; these must be strained out before the milk is added.

The best way to bake it, is as follows : Fold it together, lay it in a drijiping-pan, add a cup of boiling water, and place in a verj^ moderate oven; it must cook slowly, espec- ially in the start.

For a fish weighing three or four pounds, bake slowly and steadily, all of two hours; a smaller one will require about an hour and a half. Should the oven chance to get too hot, cover with another pan, and re- duce the heat as soon as possible. White fish should be an

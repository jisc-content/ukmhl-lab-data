PART n.J 2:n POODS FOR THE SICE. Rice Gruel. Look over and wash two tablespoonfuls of rice, and put it into a quart of cold water; set Avhere it will cook moder- ately, and stir or shake at intervals to keep it from sticking. After it begins to boil, cook half an hour; then squeeze through a coarse cloth, or strain through a fine colandei*, mashing the rice with a spoon to press out the fluid. If wanted on short notice, start the rice in boiling .water, and cook till soft ; or soak it beforehand, and boil in the water used for soaking, it will cook in twenty minutes. Rice Musii.=j(= Cook the same as for rice gruel (except the straining), and serve without seasoning. Dry Toast. =1= Take cold-water loaf bread, or leavened Graham bread, two or three days old, and slice it thin; toast slowly to an even In'oicn, leaving the bread free from moisture, and with no burnt edges. It should be eaten dry. Potato Soup.=|= Wash and pare two or three potatoes of medium size; they must be of good quality, and not the least bit sun- burnt; quarter, or cut in thick pieces, but do not slice them. Drop into a pot containing one quart of boiling Avater, cover, and cook fast thirty to forty minutes, stin'ing fre- quently to break up the lumps. If in that time the water has thickened sufficiently, strain through a fine colander, and serve warm. But if after boiling the soup should be too thin, skim out the lumps, mash fine, and return to the kettle; boil a few minutes longer, and then strain. If Avanted on short notice, slice the potatoes as thin as possible, and boil rapidly twenty minutes, with occasional stirring. Then strain, and seiwe.

(259) PART ITT. THE COMPROMISE. In the Compromise many dishes will he found, as pud- dings, custards, meats, etc., that are not so much as hinted at in the Hygienic Dietary, from the fact that they do not belong there. On the other hand, most of those dishes that have already been described, must, in the very nature of things, reappear in this, the “worldly” department. For example, there are some foi^ty kinds of bread in Part II., more than half of which are made without yeast or soda. But since these are not sufficient for the jropular demand, it has been thought necessary to introduce here still other varieties of the “staff of life,” as steamed breads, corn cakes, Graham and conr muffins, Graham cream cakes, plairr r-usks, etc., etc. The steamed breads, though not the most wholesome, ar-e, irr the way of a change, greatly liked by some persons, particularly those who incline to rather sofl lu’cad. In the following recipes, if best Akron flour (made of white wheat) is used, no sifting will be needed.

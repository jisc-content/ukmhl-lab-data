[part II. 242 HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. Sealing with Wax. Fruit can be kept perfectly in glass jars, sealed with wax; the latter is usually made by melting rosin with a little bees-wax, and a very little beef tallow. The following aie said to be good proportions : One pound rosin, two ounces bees-wax, and one and a half ounces tallow, melted to- gether. When the cans are ready to fill, melt the wax, but do not heat it very hot; dip in the fruit, wipe the moistui'e from the top of each jar, and put on the cover ; then slip a wire (bent for the purpose) over the top to keep the cover in place, and pour in enough wax to fill the groove even full. If bottles are used, or jars with small mouths, put in well- fitting corks softened by dipping into hot water ; force them do^vn securel}', and cover well with wax ; if air-bub- bles form in it puncture them, and fill the cavities with more wax. You will need to inspect the tops closely, until the wax is neai’ly or quite cold. Special Directions. Under the head of “Fruits and Fruit Juices,” the reader wiU find details for preparing fruits of all kinds, either for stewing or canning. There is also a table given, showing the relative propoidions, by measurement, of sugar (where any is used), cold water, and fruit—the latter as prepared for the kettle. By a “ cup ” is meant half a pint. The pro- portions given may not suit all tastes, nor aU latitudes, as fruits vary with the climate, both in juiciness and sweet- ness. However, the inles here given will serve at least as a guide ; and it will be an easy matter to adjust the quanti- ties after one or two trials. Bemember always to heat or stew the fruit slowly. For convenient reference--serviceable to those who al- ready understand the details of putting up fmit—the fol’ lowing bare outline is given :

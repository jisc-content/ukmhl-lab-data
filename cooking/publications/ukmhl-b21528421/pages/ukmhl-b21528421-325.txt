SELECTION OP PUDDINGS. t-UlT III.] 307 can, w ith care, be turned out on a plate, and cut in pieces as you serve it. It is best eaten warm (not hot), and is good enough without sauce—though the little woman who used to make this pudding “to perfection,” passed it to her guests with genuine maple molasses. Sweet cream or milk may be used for mixing, instead of sour ; in this case add two teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar, sifting it through the flour. If preferred, use only two eggs. Rhubarb Ch.arlotte.4^: 3 pints cut rhubarb. 3 cups fine bread-crumbs, stale. I- cup cold water. 3 tablespoonfuls sugar. Time—40 to 50 minutes. Wash, trim and peel the stalks of rhubarb, taking care that there are no worms hidden away in the body of them. Sjilit each stalk once or twice, and cut into very short bits. Prej^are the bread-crumbs from good home-made Graham loaf, rather stale ; then fill a pudding-dish with alternate layers of the crumbs and choj)ped rhubarb, beginning with the latter, and ending with the former. Make each layer of rhubarb twice as thick as the crumbs, and sprinkle the sugar over as you put it in. When the dish is full pour the water over the whole, and set it, covered, in the oven, inside a shallow pan of boiling water, and bake slowly half an hour ; then uncover, and brown quickly. Serve nearly or quite cold, with or without a dressing ; it is very good with mock cream, or lemon sauce. Gooseben'ies, just beginning to ripen, may be used in- stead of rhubarb. Sweet-Apple Pudding.—(Excellent. 3 quails new milk. 1 quart sweet apples, finely chopped.

Steamed Indian Pudding.—(Excellent.):^ 3 cups sour milk—or buttennilk. 2 “ coarse corn meal—“ flint,” if you can get it. 1 cup Graham flour, unsifted. 1 “ currants—or seedless raisins. 1 “ finely powdered beef suet. 2 tablespoonfuls piun molasses—or pure sjTup. IJ teaspoonfuls soda, dissolved in boiling water. Time—two hours and a half. Dredge the sweet fruit with a httle of the flour; if cur- rants ai’e used, pick them carefully over, and then wash and dry before dredging. Stir together the meal, flour, suet, milk and molasses (you may take maple or sorghum), and beat well; then add the dissolved soda, and beat very thor- oughly. Stir in lastly the fruit, mixing it evenly tlu’ough the batter, and pour all into a round pan, well oiled ; you must not fill it quite full. Set this in a steamer, cover with an inverted pie-pan, and steam two hours and a half. Serve warm with fniit sauce, tart fniit, or lemon sauce; the latter makes an excellent dressiug. This, and all steamed Indian puddings, may be wanned over, and served at the next meal, or the next day; dip the remnant quickly into cold water, lay it in a pie-pan with another turned over it, and then place in the oven long enough to get thoroughly hot, all through. It will be quite as good as at first.

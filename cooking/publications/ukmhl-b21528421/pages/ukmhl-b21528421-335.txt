SELECTION OF PUDDINGS. r.VRT III.] 317 a qu;irter of an inch thick, and cover with the fruit, leaving a little margin at the edge ; sprinkle lightly with sugar, if the fruit is taid. Then begin at one end and roll up tightly, leaving the fruit inside ; pinch the edges firmly together. Wrap a clean dry napkin around the roll, allowing jilenty of room to swell, put it into a tin basin, and cover closely ; then place in a steamer over a pot of boiling water, and steam two hours without uncovering. If you have to use a steamer with holes in the bottom, jxit two small sticks or bits of wood in it, and set the basin on top of these, leaving room for the steam to enter beneath ; keep the water at a fast boil. "When done remove the cloth, and send directly to the table. Cut across the roll, in slices half to three- quarters of an inch thick, and serve with mock cream, fruit sauce, or cream and sugar. This pudding may be boiled, but steaming is better. If you boil, wring the pudding-bag out of hot water, flour it well inside, and put in the roll, leaving ample room to swell ; the space allowed after the bag is tied, should be equal to at least one-third the size of the roll. If the bag is too wide for it, baste to the required size but not too snugly, as the pudding will swell sidewise as well as length- wise. Drop it into a pot of boiling water, and boil without stopping, for an hour and a half ; turn frequently, and keep the pot well filled up, adding water boiling hot. "Wlien done plunge quickly into cold water, take it out, and then remove the bag ; lay the pudding on a hot plate, and send immediately to the table. These fruit rolls are diier and more wholesome baked, than boiled or steamed; but they require a little care in the oven, else the top will brown too much before the dough is done inside. In mixing the batter, sour cream may be used, and the cream of tartar omitted.

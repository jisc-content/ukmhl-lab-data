Continue this process, turning as fast as they cook, till the mass is sufficiently done; then lift to a hot dish, and serve immediately. Scrambled Eggs. Pom* into a deep earthen pie-pan half a (y,ip of thin cream, and let it come almost to a boil. Then break in the eggs, being careful not to disturb the yolks; when they begin to whiten, separate with a knife by cutting between them, and then scrape uj3 from the bottom as they cook. Have the heat moderate, else the eggs will cook too fast, and take from the fire before they are quite done, still turning from the bottom as you lift the pan. They should be in large flakes of white and yellow, delicately blended, and yet sep- arate. Omelet.

The following is said to be an excellent recijie: Break three eggs into a bowl, and beat gently till you can dip up a spoonful; then stir in half a cup of miffi or cream. Put into a frying-pan a little fat from sweet drip- j)ing, or a bit of fresh butter; heat till the oil commences to sputter or hiss, and then pour in the omelet. When it be- gins to bubble and rise in flakes, lift with a fork by dipping the latter in here and there, and raising the mass from be- low. Persevere in this lifting process, by which the cooked portions are brought to the surface, and the raw egg is let down to the bottom. In three to five minutes the whole will be sufficiently done, and the under surface firm enough

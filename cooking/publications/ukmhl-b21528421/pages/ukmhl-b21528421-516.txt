health in the household. [part 111. m Boiled Fish. A^Hiatever the method of cooking, buy only fresh fish, and have them properly dressed. After removing the scales, rinse well in very cold water; and if there is any dark co- agulated blood on the inside, lying along the back-bone, scrape it cai-efuUy out with a knife, and linse again thor- oughly. To boil—or simmer, for the water must not even bubble —wrap the fish in a coarse net, through which you can easily test with a fork, to see if it is done. Or a nicer way perhaps, as both the form and flavor ai’e better preserved, is to sew around it a single thickness of coai’se linen cloth of rather loose textui’e. Cook in a fish-kettle, if you have one; this is an oblong vessel with a perforated tin plate suspended in it, upon which the fish is laid; the jilate has a handle at each end for lifting it out. If you have none, use a pot or pan with a bottom wide enough not to crowd. Barely cover with water that is just ready to boil, and set where it vdll keep hot, but will not bubble; remove any scum that rises. Continue the cooking tiU done, allowing, say ten to fifteen minutes to the pound, according to thickness, kind of fish, etc.; Avhen wrapped in a cloth, a lit- tle longer time would be required. Keep the lid on till finished. If the flavor is liked, slice and boil two or three onions in a separate pot, cooking till they are about done; then drain off the water, and turn them into the fish-kettle; some add a little parsley also. Use the fork from time to time, and as soon as the fish is tender remove from the fire, lift out, and drain; too much cooking will spoil it; and too little is equally detrimental to the flavor. Serve with lemon juice, if it is liked. Or a plain sauce may be made, as follows : Rub together a tablespoonful of fresh butter, and the same of Avhite flour; then stir into this mixture the liquor (a cupful) drained from the fish; it

HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD, 130 [part II. in pretty warm weather it is better to set the sponge later, and mix the last thing before bed-time. Next morning you will find the bread increased in vol- ume, and also considerably stiffer in texture ; so much so that you can readily lift it from the tray to the moulding- board. Give it ton minutes’ thorough kneading—a little longer for a larger bafch — using very little flour ; then mould into four or five loaves, put in separate pans, cover, and set to rise. When light enough, bake ; a few moments’ delay will spoil the bread. The oven must be moderate in the stai’t, tiUowing the loaves to swell a little before they commence to brown ; if baked too fast at first, the}' will be doughy in the middle. Continue with an even heat, slack- ening it toward the last, so as not to scorch in finishing ; the bread should be done in from forty to fifty minutes, though larger loaves (which are never quite as good) re- quire an hour. Have the crust an even brown, and not too thick. When taken from the pans, stand the loaves endwise till cold ; then wrap in clean cloths, and put away. In very warm weather, the bread is in danger of souring if it stands over night; to avoid this, set the sponge in the morning, and get through with the intermediate processes in time to bake the same day. Leavened Graham Bread. The following recipe is from a lady who is an excellent bread-maker : Over two tablespoonfuls of white flour jiour a pint of boiling water ; then pour in cold water until it is lukewarm. Stir in white flour to form a batter that pour (not drop) from the spoon, put in half a cup of good yeast, and beat well. Set this to rise over night, and in the morning stir in another pint of white flour, beating very thoroughly ; let it stand in a warm place till it begins to send up bubbles.

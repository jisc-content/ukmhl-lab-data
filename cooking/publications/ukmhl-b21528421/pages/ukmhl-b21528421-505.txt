It is better, however, to omit the bottom crust altogether, as it would be apt to scorch. The chicken-pie projier, that fed the preacher at Quarterly Meeting times, was somewhat different; it was made as fol- lows : Good, deeji pie-pans were lined with ordinary pie- crust, made pretty shoit; the jiieces of parboiled chicken (young “ spring chicken ”) were laid in, care lieing taken to place them so that in cutting, tlie knife would miss the bones.

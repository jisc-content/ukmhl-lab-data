Raisins, sweet currants, dates, or other fruits, may be stiiTed into the mixt- ure before baking (or steaming), if desired. This, as weU as the bread described in the preceding recipe, is excellent baked in a baker’s oven, and left in sevei'al hours after it is done. It is very good sliced and toasted, when it is one or two days old. Huckleberey Beead. Mix together tlu'ee cups of rather coarse corn meal, and one and a half cups of middhngs (rye flour will do), and wet with sweet milk, making a batter that will pour readily. Into this mixture sth' one full quart of huckleberries ; and if you have the old-fashioned brick oven, such as bakers use, pour the batter into an earthen crock, well oiled, and set it in the oven with the other bread ; do this in the even- ing, and leave it in aU night; or if you bake in the morn- ing, let it remain in the oven several hours. This bread is very good steamed ; let the batter stand in a warm place two hours, then stir the fruit in lightly, and steam two hours and a half ; brown ten minutes in the oven, at the end. Rye and Indian Gems. Mix two parts lye meal, and one part corn meal; then wet with cold water, forming a batter that will barely di’op from the spoon. Beat very thoroughl^^ until the mixture is creamy, and drop into hot gem-pans of cast-iron, slightl}^ oiled. Fill the pans nearly full (unless they are very deep), and bake in rather a hot oven, thirty to forty minutes. A very fair gem is made of all rye meal, unsifted ; moderate the heat of the oven in finishing, and do not have the gems too thick.

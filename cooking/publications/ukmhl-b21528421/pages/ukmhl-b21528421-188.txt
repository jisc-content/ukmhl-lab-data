Another rule, not merely for vegetables, but for grains and fruits as well, is never to lill iqi with Avater that is not boiling hot. Most vegetables are excellent steamed ; steamers are now made Avith seAeral chambers, so that tliree or more kinds of foods can be cooked at once, without the slightest admixtiu’e of flavors. In the absence of a steamer, most vegetables should be cooked in vessels that are porcelain-hned, or made of gi-ani- tized iron. Beans, beets, peas and jiotatoes, may be boiled in iron pots ; these should ahvays be Avashed and thoroughly dried immediately after using, and then set aAvay in a dry place to prevent misting. Vegetables, as a rule, should be seiwed at dinner ; and (by invalids certainly) they should never be eaten at the same meal Avith fruits. Those that have been several days in the market, as .string beans, peas, beets, etc., are tougher, and require lon- ger to cook than if fresh from the field or garden. On ac- count of the huckster system which prevails in some cities, most vegetables do not reach the markets until some time after they are gathered ; then they are too stale to be eaten Avith safety, much less Avith a good relish. In cooking vegetables, the following general rules aauU be of sendee ; and by a careful observance of them, there aauU be less need of seasoning, to cover up the insipid taste—or rather, lack of taste—that comes from wasting the fine flavors that belong to them. 1. If possible, have aU your vegetables fresh ; when stale they lose their natural sweetness, as well as their nutritive qualities. Peas and corn especially, should be cooked the day they are gathered ; certainly never later than the fol- lowing morning. 2. Boil in soft, pm-e water, if you have it; should the water be muddy, either filter it, or boil and settle before using.

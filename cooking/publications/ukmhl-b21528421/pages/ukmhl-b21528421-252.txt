PRESERVING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. Fruits and vegetables may be preserved hygienicaUy by drying, by refrigeration, and by canning; and recently, -a process which may be called evaporation, has been applied to fruit juice in the making of jelly. Drying Fruits. In the drjdng of fruits, much of theii’ fine flavor escapes by evaporation; and that method is of coui’se the best, which, while it most facilitates the dr^'ing process, is least wasteful of their natural juices. What is known as “Bos- well’s Heater and Drier,” is constructed with this idea in view; and the fruit dried in it is said to be ahnost as fine in flavor as when gathered from the tree. The “ Alden ” jiroc- ess is also recommended; it certainly does its work rapidly, and the apples look well. But it has been questioned whether their flavor is iierfectly preserved ; whether in slicing them so exceedingly thin, a large per cent, of it may not be lost by evaporation, and the fruit rendered insipid. On the other hand, that dried wholly in the sunshine is cured so slowly, and is so much exposed to currents of air, that it loses by long-continued evaporation, much of its nutritive value. A good plan Avith soft, juicy fruit, is to set it into a hot oven, and heat through before imtting it in the sunshine. This starts the juice, and a film forms on the surface of it, which holds in solution the nutrient particles until they are absorbed in the more solid meshes of the fruit. Peaches dried in this Avay are very rich, and fine- flavored. Small fruits, as berries, cherries, etc., are good dried in the following Avay: Put them on old plates or earthen pie-

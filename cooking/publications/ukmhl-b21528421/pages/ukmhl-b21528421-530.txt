HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. [part III. 512 pie made with the cold remnants of a roast, is not of course equal to one with fresh meat; but then, it is not expected to be. Meat Pie with Batter Crust. Make like the preceding, except to cut the meat finer, and have it not so moist. Add a little less water to the bones, when you make the gravy; or if there is some cold gravy left over, you may dilute this with warm or hot v/ater, and use it for the pie; no thickening will be needed. Cut the meat across the grain or fiber, in slices not moi’o than half an inch thick; you may break or cut these if they are large, but do not chop them. Mix in bits of cold potato, about half as much as there is meat; and if onion is liked, you may slice and parboil one or two, and put them in. Some add small bits of butter, rolled in flour; but if you have part fat meat, there is no need. AVhen all is ready put the meat and potato into a shallow pan, making the pie an inch, or an inch and a half thick, before the crust is laid on. Pour in the gravy, and then cover with a cream batter paste, or a cream and potato paste (batter), made as per recipe already given; spread it evenly with a knife, and bake in a quick oven forty to fift}' minutes, or till done. Serve immediately, as the crust will become heavy if it stands long. If preferred, you can leave out the cold potato, slice the meat thin, and hash it v^ery fine; then fill the pan to the depth of an inch, and moisten as before. Cover with either of the batter pastes, and bake. Beef or Mutton Scallop. Take what is left of a cold roast or stew of beef or mutton—cold lamb is better—reject any hard or gristl}'^ por- tions, and if there is too much fat leave out the poorest of it. Cut the meat across the grain in thin slices, and chop it fine; if there are any lumps of fat, mince them very fine

178 HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. [part II. Dried S'sv'eet Potatoes. First steam or boil the potatoes, then peel, cut in slices, and dry. To cook them, soak the diaed pieces over night in a closed vessel, having as little water as will cover them; then heat in the same water, mashing and stirring them un- til it is all evaporated. They should be as dry as possible when done. Baked Svtset Potatoes. Sweet potatoes if smooth, and free from blemishes, may be simply washed, and baked in a hot oven; wdien they are rather wet, this is a good way, as it makes them drier than if boiled. A better method perhaps, is to put them into a shallow pan, add a trifle of boiling water, and let them steam a little, before they bake. Tomatoes, etc. Tomatoes, melons, squashes and pumpkins, dietetically considered, must be classed among vegetables, from the simple fact that thej' are more easily digested with these than with fruits. Green corn also—which is an immature grain—does, if anj'thing, better with vegetables, though it can be eaten with either. The tomato is one of the best and most wholesome of the garden products; the Trophy and Livingston are flne varieties. Sliced Tomatoes.=|= Wash good fresh tomatoes, not too ripe, and peel without scalding; then slice very thin, and send to the table. If preferred cold, let them stand in ice-water half an houi', before peeling; or you may set them in the refrigerator after they are sliced. They are good enough without seasoning.

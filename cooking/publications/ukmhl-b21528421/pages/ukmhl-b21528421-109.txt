FOOD COJIDINATIONS, ETC. 1)1 I'AUT 1. 1 prepai-e a siJo-dish of soniethiiig rather nutritious, and then atld a dish of warm coru bread, as au accompauimeiit, par- ticularly if it be a cold day. 14. If you have for dinner a thin vegetable soup, follow with something more substantial, as baked beans, baked jjotatoes (sweet or Irish), or corn bread ; but if you have beau or sidit-pea soup, let the other vegetables bo of a kind less heaidy. 15. On a very cold day, have a warm dinner of good nutritious articles ; select mainly solid foods with gi’ains, rather than thin soups and watery vegetables. 16. On a warm day make the breakfast largely of fruits, with a moderate sui)2)ly of cere;ds. The dinner may be of young vegetables (or fruits), a dish of gi-ains if you like, and a little bread. Eat lu/hllij, and you will suffer less from heat —paiiicularly if no seasonings are taken. For supper, a glass of cold grape juice and a slice of loaf bread, is line in hot weather. 17. In very cold weather, take the chiU off jouv stewed fruit, fruit pies or other dishes, before seiwing them. Pas- tries if used, are best at the midday meal—and so are puddings. 18. If there arc invalids at the table, they should eat nothing that is venj cold ; food not much below Idood heat is best, p;irticularly in cold weather ; and the dining-room should be comfortably warm. 19. Never have too great a variety at a single meal; have few dishes, well prepared, and make the changes from one meal to another ; this will please better on the whole, and it will not too rapidly exhaust your hinited supplies. 20. If one meal happens to fall a little below the average in either quality or variety, see that the next is fuUy up to the mark.

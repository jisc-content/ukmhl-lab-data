The cattle that ai'e shipped into New York for the mm’ket, have many of them come hundreds of miles in ill-ventilated cars, often in hot weather, and ai‘e stowed into them almost as closely as they ctxn stand; here they ai’e sur- rounded with a stifling, filthy atmosjihere, and frequently they have not a drop of water on the whole journey.

Fat people, as well as fat animals, have smixU, weak muscles—a fact well understood by tlie medical student. The presence of ceidain parasites in animal foods, is another strong objection to their use.

PAHT III.] 405 BEEF, MUTTON AND LAMB. cold remove the grease for oiling your bake-j)ans, and save the gravy in the bottom t-o put into a hash or stew, another day. The above method of cooking meats, is liked by many better than roasting ; they are less greasy done in this way, and the flavor is milder. But one thing you must observe, and that is—to stew sloioly. Cold Sliced Beef or Mutton. Cook the same as the last, and slice the following day, by cutting the meat smoothly across the gi-ain or fiber. Or if you serve it wai-m, cut no more than will be eaten ; then take any considerable portion that is left over, press it well together, and either wrap a cloth closely around it, or pack snugly into a dish, and set it away, covered, in a cold place. The next day you can shce it for dmner ; and many prefer it to the warm meat. A dish of turnips, with wann corn bread and baked potatoes, is a good accompani- ment. A Brown Stew. MTiat is known as a “ brown stew,” is about the same as “ Stewed Beef or Mutton,” in the last recipe but one, except that it requires rather longer cooking, and the meat is always browmed at the end. T.‘Ue poorer parts of beef or mutton will answer ; and a piece weighing six or eight pounds, would take from three to four hours’ stewing. Some like an onion or carrot sliced in,yifter the meat is half cooked; alw^ays staid it in boiling water, cover closely, and stew slowly till done. If necessary, add now and then a little water, boiling hot; it must ah be out of the pot at the last; then brown the meat in its own hot gravy. You may skim off the grease from the latter, and thicken with a little browned flour ; then serve it and me meat with plain vegetables, as mashed potato, and steAvod turnips ca cab- 20*

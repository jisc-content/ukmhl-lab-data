If the nu- tritive substances that are found in hair are wanting, is it not reasonable that the middle-aged, and even our young people, should have bald heads ? If our tables do not su2i- ply the elements which go to make up om* bodies, and therefore to form the blood corjmscles out of which the various tissues are made, then indeed we must be content to have faded cheeks, flabby muscles, sunken eyes, weak backs, toothless gums, and bare scaljis. Nor is it at aU strange that what we have left is little more than a “ bundle of nerves,” since we have lavislfly parted with all besides. We deserve our fate, if we do not mend our ways.

First among these gifts are the golden grains ; they contain in great abun- dance and weU-suited jirojioi-tions, those substances in organic combination that are required to build uji the body, as its tissues are spent from day to day. Nature furnishes us in the organic kingdom, not “ proxi- mate princiifles ” as such ; not fibrin, albumen, or casein ; not starch, sugar, or fat; not chlorides, carbonates, or phos- phates ; these latter, if obtained from the food jiroduets, come only through destructive analysis. Out of her own ample storehouse she gives us those wonderful products of the soil suited for human food. Nor must we fail to note the fact, that it is these, untouched by the hand of the chemist, that are received and aiipropriated by animal organisms. Trees may grow and thrive upon inorganic foods in the aqueous or gaseous form—but animals never. The human animal, in common with the others, would very soon staiwe to death on these substances. Neither wflU the proximate principles of food, support animal Hfe ; not even

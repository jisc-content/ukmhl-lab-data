HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. [PAKT II. 108 Cocoa-Nut Bread. Some weak stomachs can not tolerate this bread, the grated cocoa-nut being rather difficult to digest. The usual way of making it, is as follows : to one quart of Graham flour allow half a teacupful of grated cocoa-nut ; prepare the nut by peeling off the brown or outer portion, then grate the remainder as fine as possible, stir it well through the floui’, and mix as for hard rolls, kneading thoroughly. Save and add the cocoa-nut milk, if it is perfectly sweet; mould into rolls or biscuits, or any desii’ed form, prick well, and bake till fully done, in a hot even oven. A safer way for invalids, is to soak the grated nut in a pint of cold water for an hour, or longer ; then put the mixture into a farina-kettle, warm to blood heat, and set it back on the stove where it will keep warm for two hom-s. Then bring almost to a boil, removing the kettle from the fire just before the cocoa-nut water begins to bubble. Let it stand till quite cold, strain out the nut and use the water for mixing ; add the milk if it is sweet. If you make by this method, grate the Avhole of the cocoa-nut, and add enough water to cover it before soaking and heating ; when you have strained out the nut and added its milk, use as much flour as the fluid will wet to the proper consistency. Hot-Water Rolls. These are the soft rolls so common in Water-Cures years ago, and still largely in use. They are SAveet, and tolerably wholesome, especially if the dough is mixed rather stiff, and the bread very thoroughly baked. To make them, pour boiling water into a quantity of unsifted or rather coarse Graham flour, stirring constantly Avith a strong iron spoon until two-thirds of it is scalded ; then finish Avith cool or cold water, stirring with the spoon, and forming a dough stiff enough to handle Avith the hands ; if too stiff, the bread

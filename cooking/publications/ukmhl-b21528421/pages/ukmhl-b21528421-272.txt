On the contrary, they render the liver and skin torpid, causing biliousness, and not unfrequently headaches ; they also imtate the mu- cous surfaces of the alimentary canal, causing the laxness in question, which of tens ends in chronic diarrhea.

Brass and copper vessels are wholly unfit for culinary purposes. The por- celain-lined kettle, well made, is excellent; but care must be taken not to let it get dry or stand too near the fire, lest the enamel crack off. The granitized iron ware is good and tolerably durable (though rather thin), but more ex- pensive. There have of late years been patented a number of tin steamers, each furnished with a set of chambers for cooking several vegetables at the same time. They are said to cook perfectly, without the slightest admixture of flavors. Some of these are coming into general use, and will receive fur- ther notice. Loaf bread, pies, and many other articles ai*e better cooked in an atmosphere that is confined as weU as heated ; with an ordinary stove, much of the nutritive value of foods is lost through evaporation. In the olden times, our mothers baked bread and pies in a skillet—^loaves, in a “ Dutch oven ” or bake-kettle—which was placed on a bed

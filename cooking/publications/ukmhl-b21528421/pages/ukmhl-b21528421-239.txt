221 FRUITS AND FRUIT JUICES. PART II.] be plenty, should be of a clear amber color, mild in flavor, but good and rich; it is an excellent dressing for mushes. Peeled dried peaches require more juice -when finished than the unpeeled ; so do dried apricots; one measure of fruit to two of water is about right. In cooking the apricots, simmer slowly nearly two hours, or until quite soft. Prunes. =1= See that there are no wormy or imjierfect ones; then wash the prunes through two waters vei'y thoroughly, rub- l)ing them weU with the fingers. If this is not done care- fully, the juice will be dark and muddy-looking; it should be clear in color, not dai'ker than the juice of fine dried peaches. It is often the slovenly j^ueparing that makes (hâ€™ied fruit so unsightly, and so little relished. Stew the same as peaches, allowing three pints of boiling water to a quart of prunes; they wiU cook in twenty-five to thirty minutes. This fruit is greatly improved in flavor by adding a handful of tart dried plums, before stewing; some use instead, a sliced lemon, first removing the rind and seeds; it should be put in when the pinnes are about done. Dried Plums.=|= Dried plums of some varieties, are very good; they are cooked the same as prunes. If quite tart, a little sugar may be added before taking them from the fire. The very tart varieties are excellent mixed with prunes, allowing one part plums to three or four parts prunes. Dried Cherries. These are prepared and cooked the same as plums, ex- cejit that they stew in shorter time; start in boiling water, and take from the fire as soon as done, or they wiU be in- sipid. They usually cook in ten or fifteen minutes.

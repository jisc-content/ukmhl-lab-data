PEPPER AND OTHER CONDIMENTS. PAHT I.] 71 Pepper and other Condiments. Pepper is not, like salt, a mineiTxl substance : it is a vege- table poison. Plies AviU not touch it, neither will they eat salt. Black pepper, if taken on an empty stomach in the moderate quantity of a teasjioonfiil, will either be promptly ejected, or it will cause great disturbance in the stomach and bow'els, and also in the heaid’s action after it enters the circulation. It is in no sense a food, but in every sense a stimulant, which is but another name for a substance non- usable by the vital organs, and therefore to be thrown out of the vital domain. Red or black pepjier is a prolific cause, as are all stimulants, of enlargement of the blood- vessels, and ultimately of disease of the heaid. Its imme- diate effect upon the tongue, throat, stomach and bowels is to create increased action, not only of tlie capillaries, caus- ing temporary congestion and even inflammation of the mucous surfaces, but also of the organs which secrete the digestive fluids. Its uliimate effect is to weaken and deaden these organs, b}' repeated stimulation to abnormal action ; it also impairs or destroys the nerves of taste in the mouth, together with the gastric or other neiwes which aid in the process of digestion. AVhen these are weakened by stimu- lants, the functions themselves are necessarily impaired ; and confirmed dyspepsia, with its attendant train of bad symptoms, brings up the rear. It is needless to say, that ginger, spices, nutmeg, cinna- mon, and all that class of condiments, however much they may vary in cpiality, are stimulating to a greater or less de- gree, and must be put into the list of “ things forbidden,” in the hygienic dietary. The habit, every year increasing, of using spices and condiments in almost every article of food, and in such large quantities, can not be too severely condemned. The end must be hopeless indigestion, with prostration of the nerves whidi supply the digestive organs,

Keep the cream in the ice-chest (or in ice-water) till the in- stant 3'ou want to use it. Mix the Graham and white flour well together, and wet with the cream; pour the latter in slowly and stir rapidly, either vfith a spoon or the tips of the fingers; allow no little jmddles of cream to form in the flour, but mix as fast and as lightly as possible, getting all nicely together as if by magic.

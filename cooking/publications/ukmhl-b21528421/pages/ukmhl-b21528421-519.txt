RlSfl. 501 PART III.] Brook trout are sometimes baked, in this way: First dress them nicely, and if you can take the trouble, remove the bones carefully with the fingers. Then arrange the fish in a bake-pan, scattering bread-crumbs between the layers ; moisten the crumbs with half a cup of meat gravy, or you may drop in little bits of fresh butter. llTien the pan is full, add, say a cup of boiling water, cover closely, and set it in the oven. Bake with a moderate heat, from an hour and a half to two hours ; baste if there is need, and cover the top if it browns too fast. If the pan is in danger of going dry, add pail of a cup of water, boiling hot. When done, there should be a very little moisture in the bottom of the dish. Salt Fish. Fish, as already stated, must be considered inferior to beef or mutton—and all meats less wholesome than fruits and grains. What then can we say of salt fish ? If it was poor before salting, it is worse afterward ; the muscular fibers are hardened and toughened with the antiseptic, and to get rid of the latter, much of the nutrient properties con- tained must necessarily be lost in soaking and boiling. Briefly stated, salt fish is “mighty poor eating.” But if the country people wdll live on it, instead of raising and eating an abundance of choice fruits, vegetables and grains, the next best thing, of course, is to teach them (if they do not know ah’eady) how to cook the article in the least objection- able way. Mackerel.—( Salt.) Salt mackerel requires a long time to soak; twenty-four hours would scarcely more than suffice to freshen it. If it has to be done in shorter time, start the fish to soak in tepid W'ater, and change three or four times. When sufficiently fresh you may drop it into ice-water, and let it stand an hour to harden a little. Then broil, bake or boil, as suits you best.

296 [PAET III. HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. Pumpkin Pie. 4^ 1 quart sweet milk. It} piuts stewed pumpkin. 2 even tablespoonfuls sugar. 3 eggs, yolks and whites separate. In preparing the pumpkin, wliicb should be lipe and of good quahty, peel, slice and cut, removing the seeds ; then stew tm tender, but not long enough to change its color. Let it get thoroughly soft before you stii* it; and staii; in so little water that it will not be too wet when done ; you can, if necessary, add a trifle of boihng water as it stews. After stirring, cook very little ; much cooking destroys the fine fresh flavor of the pumpkin, which is its greatest excellence. The best for pies or sauce, is one that is known est as the “ Yankee ” pumpkin ; it is largely cultivated in New Eng- land, and is the color of a very ripe orange. When stewed add a portion of the milk, and rub through a colander or mash fine, to remove the lumps ; if it is sweet and ripe, no sugar will be needed. If only of ordinary quality, add the sugar to the yolks, and boat well together ; stir these into the pumpkin, add the whites whipped to a stiff froth, and beat thoroughly. Then stir in the\est of the milk, and dip into pie-pans lined with a stiff cream paste ; make this of equal parts Graham and white flour, sifted. Have a moderate oven, heating well at the bottom, and bake till the pies are barely firm in the center ; then take them out, slip from the tins to plates, and set in a cool place. Serve warm or cold ; they are best, eaten an hour after baking.

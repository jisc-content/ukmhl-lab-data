It is also well known that the gi-eatest philosophers, and the most profound scholars, both in ancient and modern times, have been men of temperate and abstemious habits. In the light of history, therefore, there is but one conclu- sion to be drawn in the matter ; viz,, that in order to make the best use of om* minds, or to develop them to their greatest capacity, the food we eat must be proper in quality and moderate in quantity. Indeed, how could it be other- wise, when we consider that the brain, which is the organ of the mind, is constantly supplied Avith blood for its special groAAdh and nourishment, and that this blood is made out of the things eaten ? If, therefore, the quality of the food is bad, or if any substance deleteiâ€™ious to the vital organism is taken Avith it, the brain AviU immediately suffer ; and when this organ is not in its normal condition, how can we expect it to do good work? In other words, bad food, or too much of it, makes bad blood ; bad blood causes a disordered brain ; and a disordered brain can not do first-class think- ing. The ill effects of stimulants in food, are manifold ; they send an increased quantity of blood to the base of the brain, causing congestion of the cerebellum. This congestion creates excitement or preternatiural action of the animal propensities, inducing in the individual a desire to fight, commit murder, and do all sorts of immoral or unlaAvful things. But the evil does not stop here ; the habitual tak- ing of stimulating substances, even in limited quantity, causes an increased gronih of those organs that are located in the base of the brain ; and this, with the greater activity that necessarily follows, leads to intense passional emotions, and excesses of every description. So that murder, theft, and all manner of evil doings, are the legitimate results of the introduction into a community of stimulating foods and drinks.

Pick, wash and seed the raisins, a full pint for an ordi- nary loaf ; put them in a small, covered vessel, and set the latter into a larger one containing boiling water ; cover this also, and place over the fire. Let the raisins steam half or three-quarters of an hour ; the water that adheres from washing, is sufficient to steam them. INIix and knead the bread, as in either of the preceding recijies ; when ready to mould work the raisins in evenly, and set it to rise in single loaf tins. Bake an hour, or till well done, and eat the next day. Bread from “Risings.” Leavened bread is often made without hops, as follows : Into one pint of water at scarcely more than blood heat, stir white flour to form rather a stiff batter, and beat well ; our mothers added a little salt, but there is no need of it. Make this sponge early in the morning, and set it where it will keep at an even temperature, about blood heat; it wiU take five or six hours for it to rise. Beat several times the first three hours—not afterward ; and wlien the sponge is ready, mix 'immrdiateh/; “ delay is dangerous,” particularly in making bread from “ risings.” Sift into your tray throe quarts of Graham flour—or part Graham—make a well in it, pour in the sponge, and add warm Avater (not hot) to form rather a soft dough. Knead but little and very lightly, and mould into loaves not too large. Set these to rtse in a warm place, and when light enough, bake in a moderate oven about an hour ; if made chiefly of -white flour, a little less time will suffice. This bread requires promptness at every step, or it will not be good ; if either the sponge or the dough stands after it is risen, the bread loses its sweetness.

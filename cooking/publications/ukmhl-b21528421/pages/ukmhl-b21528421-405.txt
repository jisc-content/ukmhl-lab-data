OTHER DISHES. PART III.] 387 pieces when cooked. Wash quickly, to remove knife-rust, put into earthen pie-pans placing them not too closely to- gether, and add a little cold Avater. Set in an even oven, and hake Avithout scorching till thoroughly tender ; they may require turning, once or tAvice ; though they look better not to be disturbed till done. If they broAvn too fast on top, cover Avith an old plate, or a pie-pan of granitized iron ; and if necessary, add a trilie of hot Avater once or tAvice, Avhile they are bilking ; it may be well to iiour in a little, boiling hot, just before you tixke them from the oven ; there should be considerable juice Avhen the apples are done.

This dessert, properly prepared, is both attractive and palatable ; the apples, smooth and unbroken, should be of a light buff color, with the tliick amber juice at the base.

When done put the apples in a dish, and drain the juice over them. Stewed Apples. Pare and core good i-ich apples, not too npe, and SAveet enough not to break in steAAung ; Avash quickly, and lay Avhole in a porcelain kettle, adding enough cold Av'ater to about one-third cover them ; then place over a slow fire. Cover with a plate, if you have not a granitized iron lid ; tin ones, unless bright and neAV, darken the fruit by the steam that collects on them. Stew gently, or rather siin- mer, one hour, or till the apples are not only tender, but

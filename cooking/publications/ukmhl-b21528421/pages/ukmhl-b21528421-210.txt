[part II. l'J2 HKi^LTII IN THE HOUSEHOLD. Corn and Toiviatoes.=|= Peel and slice the tomatoes, and cook slowly half an hour. Then prepai-e the corn as follows, having it young and ten^ der : A\uth a thin, sharp knife shave off the tip ends of the grains, and thi'ow them away. Then slice the rest very thin, until most of the corn (say three-fourths of it) is re- moved from the cob, and with a dull knife scrapie out the remainder. Put it in with the cooked tomatoes, and stew rather slowly half an hour, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking ; then dish. Another way is to take equal quantities of sliced tomatoes and corn cut from the cob, and stew them together thiidy to forty minutes ; the heat must be moderate. SUCC0TASH.=|= Boil white beans—Limas are best—until they are soft, but not broken ; have water enough when done to make them rather juicy. Select good sweet corn, young and tender, cut it from the cob, not too closely, and scrape out what re- mains with a dull knife. Add the corn to the beans (two paids of the former to one of the latter), and stew over a moderate fire twenty to thirty minutes. Stir occasionally^ and see that the mixture does not scorch. Another way to prepare this dish, is to boil string beans (the wax beans arc best for this purpose) until they are nearly tender ; it will take about an hour and a half. Then add the cut corn, and cook half an hour. In making succotash, dried beans can be used, but those fresh from the garden are better ; and in the absence of fresh green corn, canned corn ^may be substituted. Cook this very httle, say ten minutes, after adding it to the beans

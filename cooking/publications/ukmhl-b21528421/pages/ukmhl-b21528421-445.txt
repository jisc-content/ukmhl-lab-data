Baked Be.vns.4]= Stew the little soup bean, white kidney, or white marrow- fat, as in the last recipe but one. Cook rapidly two hours, or until the beans ai'e not only soft, but beginning to fall to pieces; have plenty of juice in them. If you want them extra good, stir in half a cup of milk or cream, then pour into a deep dish, smooth the top with a knife, and bake in a slow oven two to three hoiu's, or until the beans are a rich red color throughout. If a nearer approach to “ pork and beans ” is desirable, omit the milk, or cream, and put in a bit of fresh beef rib, rather lean, and previously stewed in a little water till ten- der; place the meat in the dish, poiu’ the stewed beans ai’ound and over it, and bake as before. A Httle fresh beef CTavv, stirred in before baking, is not a bad substitute for the meat. Parsxips.4]: Wash and scrape the parsnips, and if large, split in halves or quarters; cover them with boiling water, and stew mod- erately three-quarters of an hour, or till thorouglily tender; if they are old, it may take an hour, or longer. There should be nearly a cup of liquor in the pot, at the end. Put them into a liake-pan, pour all the liquor over, and place in the oven to brown. Bake twenty to thirty minutes, basting frequently; the liquor should all be evaporated when done. No seasoning is required. Another way, much liked, is this : After cutting in halves or quarters, remove the hard or stringy portion in the center of the parsnip; then boil till quite tender, having the water all evaporated at the last. Mash till perfectly smooth, stir in a little cream or fresh butter, and heat a moment; then dish. They are excellent.

HK^LTn IN THE HOUSEHOLD. [PAKT III. 432 Summer Squashes. Summer squaslies are of numerous varieties, and the time of cooking varies accordingly. One of the best but not the most common, is known as the “Summer Crook-Neck”; it is a long slim squash, mostly “ neck,” and often very crooked; it is orange-colored, and rough or waidy on the surface. Fresh from the garden, these little squashes stew tender in half an hour, or less time. When very young they need no peeling, or removing of seeds. Wash, cut in thick slices, and start in not too much boiling water; cover, cook rapidly, and have them almost di'y when done. Finish with cream or butter. The little scalloped squash, so common in the markets, should be well peeled; and if not very young, the seeds must be taken out. Then slice it, and lay in a closed steamer—not one with holes in the bottom; or you may put it in a porcelain kettle, with just enough boiling water to cook it; if young and tender, forty minutes is about the time required. The squash should be pretty dry at the last; if too much water remains lift the lid, and let it nearly aU evaporate. When done remove from the fire, mash fine, and add a little cream, or a lump of fresh butter. Set the kettle back on the stove, heat a moment, stirring once or twice, and then lift to the tureen; do not send to the table too hot. Properly managed, this dish is excellent; indiffer- ently done, it is almost woidhless. Winter Squashes. Winter squashes rijien in the fall, but may be kept in a cool dry place, nearly or quite till spring. They ai'e of various colors, shapes, sizes, and qualities; some have hai’d shells, and some soft. One of the finest varieties raised, is the Buttman; it is something like the Hubbard, only much milder and finer in flavor; it keeps well all winter. The

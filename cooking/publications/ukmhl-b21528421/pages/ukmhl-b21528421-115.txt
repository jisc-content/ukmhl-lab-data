97 HINTS ON COOKING. P.\BT 1.] can enter beneath it. Now put on the lid of the steamer, the latter being closely fitted over a pot of boiling water and cook constantly, keeping the water at a fast boil. Do not uncover till the bread is done ; then lift the lid, take out the pan, and set it in a hot oven to brown ten or fifteen minutes. Steamed puddings, mixed in a batter, are managed in the same way, except the browning at the end. When corn meal is used in mixing either steamed breads or puddings, take golden or white fiint meal, if you can get it; and fiU the measiu'e not quite so full as when meal from the dent corn is taken. In making puddings or steamed breads, never heat the pan before oiling, as this will make the batter stick to it; a little olive oil, or beef chipping, may be used instead of butter. In baking batter puddings, or any that may adhere to the sides of the dish, a good plan is to place the latter in the oven within a shallow vessel (as a dripping-pan), containing a little boiling water.

In the absence of this utensil, heat in a tin bucket set inside a pot of boiling water ; or a thick stone or eazdlien crock will answer, if the fire is not too hot.

If soda is put into bread, cake or puddings, use it spar- ingly. A “ teaspoonful ” of soda, is simply the spoon filled until it is level; and the same for cream of taidar. But if

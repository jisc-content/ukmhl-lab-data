Cucumbers to be fit for eating, must be very young, and fresh from the vines ; the snnxUer ones are generally the best. If bought in the mai-kets, select those that are green and white in color, with no tinge of yeUow, and see that they are firm to the touch ; the others are stale. After peeling, lay in very cold water half an houi’, to make them crisp ; then slice as thin as possible, and pour lemon juice over them ; it may be diluted slightly with water, if too acid for the taste. Seiwed in this way, fresh cucumbers are quite harmless to healthy stomachs. Boiled Chestnuts. Look them over, one at a time, to see if all are sound ; then drop into boiling water, and cook till done. Fresh chestnuts will boil sufficiently in fifteen or twenty minutes ; if older, they may need a little longer time. Let them remain in the hot water till wanted ; then remove the shoUs with a sharp knife.

Put them into a pan, and place over a charcoal or other fire ; shake or stii’ them to |)revent scorching, and remove as soon as done.

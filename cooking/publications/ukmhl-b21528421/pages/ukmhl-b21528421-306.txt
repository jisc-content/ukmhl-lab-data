[PAET III, HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. 288 Make a Lattc'r of the cream, eggs and ilour, add the dis- solved soda, and beat well; then pour it into a small pan, well oiled, and bake in a moderate oven till done ; test with a broom-straw, the same as ordinary cake. Serve fifteen minutes after it comes from the oven. PIES, Etc. Cream Paste. Talve equal parts of Graham and wEite flour, sifted, and stir the two together ; then wet with cold sweet cream ; the colder the cream and flour, the crisper the paste. Mix as lightly and quickly as possible, forming a stiff dough ; do not knead, but gather up the fragments of jiaste, and begin to roll out immediately; or set it in the ice-chest tih wanted. This recipe is so often called for, that it is given here ac well as in Part II., to which the reader is referred for details. Pie-Crust Glaze. In making pumpkin or custaiâ€™d pies, or any that are very juicy, as cherry or currant, the crust is apt to become satu- rated with the soft mixture, unless they are eaten as soon as done. To prevent this, a good plan is said to be to roll out the crust and wet it with the beaten white of an egg, before adding the filling; the egg hardens in baking, and prevents the moisture from soaking into the crust. A better way lor fruit pies requiring sugar, particularly if they are juicy, is to line the pie-pans, and sprinkle first with a little flour, and then with the sugar, brushing the two together with the hand; during the baking the flour and melted sugar adhere together, and keep the juice from coming in contact with the paste.

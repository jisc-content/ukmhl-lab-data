BEEF, MITTTOX AND IAMB. PART m.J 453 BEEF, imJTTON AND LiUIB. Broiled Beef-Steak. 4^ In selecting a beef-stealc, the preference is usually given to the poiier-houso or sMoin steaks. The “ round ” or Hank is tougher, and may retpiire pounding, or hacking; if so, take a dull carving-knife, too blunt to cut, and hack the meat closely from end to end, first one side and then the other. Or if you have a steak-mallet, or hea\'y hammer, 3 0U may pound it hard, breaking and separating the tough libers. AVhen ready, lay tlie steak on a clean gridii’on—a steel one with slender bars is best—and place it over (not on) a bed of live coals, free from smoke. Or a better plan is said to be, to have the gridii’on fitted under the grate; this pre- vents the dripping of grease on the coals, with the unpleas- ant odor and smoke. Turn, every two or three minutes, not allowing the juices to drop, or to collect on the upper surface of the meat. A steak of usual thickness, say half to three-quarters of an inch, should cook in ten to twelve minutes. If properly done it will be free from burnt edges, or the flavor of coal smoke, or burnt drippings. "Wlien sufficiently cooked lift it to a hot platter, cover with another, and send to the table. In the absence of the necessary apparatus for broiling, try the following exceUont substitute: Set a clean skillet on the stove, heat it hot, and lay in the steak, jiressing it smoothly down; no water, grease or Inittcr, but simply the steak. Cover two or three minutes, or until tlie meat is well seared (not scorched) on one side; it will stick fast at first, but when lightly browned it can be loosened with a knife. Then turn it over, press it down smooth, and brown the other side in the same way; keep the skillet or broiling-pan hot, but do not scorch. Turn frequently, not allowing the juices to escajie, and cover closely between turnings. About

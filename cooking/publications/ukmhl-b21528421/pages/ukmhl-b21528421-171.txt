Repeat the stimng occasionidly, to prevent sticking, and cook from an hour and a half to two hours; do not mirke too stiff. Stewed sweet cm’rants or other sweet fruits, as dried or canned pears, make a good dressing. When mush is left over, cut it in slices the next morning, dip these into corn meal, and lay on a hot griddle, slightly oiled; when evenly bro^\■ned, turn and brown the other side.

Stir as Httle as pos- sible; and before dishing, set the pot from the fire a few minutes; it will be less likely to stick to the vessel. Serve lukewarm, with fruit or fruit juice.

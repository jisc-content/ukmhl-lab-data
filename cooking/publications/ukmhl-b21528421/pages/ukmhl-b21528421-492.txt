Fowls of every description, should be drawn, immediately after they are killed; if this is not done, the contents of the intestinal canal will be absorbed into the flesh, and ^vill of course poison it. It has been truly said, that “ there is no direr disgrace to our noidhern markets, than the practice of sending whole dead fowls to them.” As soon as drawn, they should be thoroughly rinsed with cold water, and wiped per- fectly dry with a clean cloth; then a piece of fresh charcoal should be placed in the cavity of each, and they should be shipped to market without delay.

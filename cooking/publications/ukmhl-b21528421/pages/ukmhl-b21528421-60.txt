The flesh of healthy animals, as beef or mutton, is neither the best nor the worst of foods. In actual nutritive value, so far as either quahty or quantity of nutrient material is concerned, the grains will always stand at the head of the food products. In respect to variety, we have but to add to these the various fruits and vegetables, each in its season and in its highest state of cultui’e, and we have, as many believe, ah, and the best, that is needed for the sustenance of our bodies.

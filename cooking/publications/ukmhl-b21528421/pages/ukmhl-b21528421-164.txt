[hart II. 14G HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. Grains cooked in tins kettle (or in a covered tin bucket set in a pot of boiling water), require a longer time by about one-tbird, than if done in a closed steamer ; hominy and pearl barley, for instance, would need all of five hours. The time can be shortened, however, by soaking (covered) over night, and cooking in the same icaier; if soaked, they will steam in a farina-kettle in about the same time as that given in the table. But the flavor is rather better if the soaking is dispensed with. These grains are sometimes cooked in a stone or earthen crock, or even in an iron j)ot, on the back of the stove ; the fire must be slow, or they ■will scorch. Cracked Wheat. =|= Cracked or crushed wheat Avas originally what the name imifiies, viz., the grain crushed, or cracked partly open. But now that each kernel is first dressed or cleaned (pearled), and then cut into two or more pieces, some other name, as “ Avheaten grits,” seems more appropriate ; and this is Avhat the jDreparation is called, in Eastern cities. To cook it, put it into a steamer and add cold water, taking four and a half parts water to one of grain; cover, and cook without stir- ring, three hours. In the absence of a steamer, or a double boiler, j)ut the wheat and water into a tin bucket, fit on its lid, and set it in a kettle of boiling water, also covered. Care must be taken to allow the gi’ain room to swell. In summer you may pour it into a mould or oval dish, and seiwe cold. Easpberries, or other small fruits, stewed, make a good dressing. Rolled Wheat. This is cooked the same as cracked -wheat, the propor- tions being one of grain to four and a half of cold wLater ; or, if liked dry, one to four ; time, three hours. Serve the same as cracked wheat.

PUDDING SAUCES, CREAMS, ETC. 367 PAKT III.] Pine-Apple Cream, 1 pint sweet cream. 1 ripe pine-apple. § cup sugar. 2 eggs—whites of. Peel the pine-apple, cut it in very thin slices, and sprinkle the sugai’ between them. Set these, covered, in a cool place ; after two or three hom’s, chop the fruit up in the syrup with a silver knife, and strain through a coai’se cloth. Put the juice in the ice-chest, together with the cream and eggs ; when all are very cold, beat the juice gradually into the cream, keeping the latter in a vessel of ice-water ; then stir in the whites of the eggs, well whipped, and beat all to a good froth.

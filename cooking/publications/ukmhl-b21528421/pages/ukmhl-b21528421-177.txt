PASTRIES. 159 PART II.] be quite stiff. Roll pretty thin, line the pie-pans, .and fill with the apples, taking care that the slices are well placed ; add a little water, if the fruit is not sufficiently juicy. Roll out the upper crusts, also thin, and lay them on ; pinch the edges securely together, prick deeply with a fork, and bake in a quick oven, twenty-five to tliii'ty minutes. The apples should be well done, and the crusts delicately browmed, top and bottom. As soon as cooled to lukewarm, the pies arc ready to serve ; or they may be eaten several hours after they iire baked. If kept till the next day, a good plan, pai’ticularly in winter, is to set them in the oven long enough to heat thi’ough before sending to the table ; take out a few minutes before seiwing, if you like them nearly cold. Green Apple PiE.=jf= Select very tart apjfies, full-grown, but not nearly ripe ; pare them, and slice in pretty thick pieces. Mix the paste the same as the last, roll it a little thicker, and put in plenty of apples, adding as little water as will cook them. Bake in a good oven thirty to forty minutes, or till the apples are thoroughly soft; the crusts must be well browned. When done, split open the pie with a knife, lay the two crusts on separate plates, and cover each with the fruit. Sprinkle lightly with brown maple sugar, and eat warm. In the early summer when apples are scarce, this pie is decidedly appetizing. Peach Pie.=|= Pare and slice the fruit, then make and bake the same as apple pie, last recipe but one ; no sugar will be needed, un- less the peaches are intensely sour. If tliis fruit is out of season, canned peaches may be used. Peach and aU fniit pies are best seiwed cold, or very nearly so ; or they may be eaten the day after they are baked.

LEA\'ENED AND OTHER BREAD. 131 PART n.] Then take enough sifted Graham Hour to mix with the sponge, and form a dough not very stiff ; knead till it looks and feels smooth and silky, and set it to rise. When light enough knead very little, form into loaves, and put them into the pans. As soon as they have xisen sufficiently (if too light tlie bread will not be sweet), set in a moderate oven, and bake till done ; they will recpiire fully an hour, if the loaves are of ordinary ^size. When taken out do not set them flat on the table, but place endwise, leaning against something until cold. Cut the day after baking. Graham Bre-vd with Potato Sponge. Peel foiuâ€™ or five potatoes, drop into a quart of boiling water, and cook till soft; then hft them out, mash tiU free from lumps, and add the water (hot) in which they boiled, mixing well together.

HEiULTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. [PAET II. 162 ends, and trim off the surplus paste with a knife. Bake in a, quick oven till the crust is done and nicely browned on the bottom. Serve cold the same day. Plum Pie. Damsons are the best plums for pies ; gather them ripe enough not to be “pucke^y ” when cooked ; they should be about right for good sauce. Line a deep dish witli a firm cream paste, making the crust a quaider of an inch thick ; tlien fill with the jilums, carefully picked over and washed, and sprinkle in the sugar ; it wiU take about half a cup to a quart of plums. Lay on a good top crust, and bake in a quick oven forty to fifty minutes, or until the crusts are done and well browned. Prick with a fork before baking, and also cut a cross-slit in the center. Rhubarb Pie.=-|= Select rhubarb that is young and tender ; wash well, and trim off the fragments of leaves, taking care that no worms are left imbedded in the stalks. Peel these, split each once or twice, making the slices very thin, and cut into inch lengths. Prejiare a stiff cream jiaste, roll it in a thin sheet, and lay the under crust; sprinkle in a Httle flour and a heaping tablespoonful of sugar, brushing the two w’eU to- gether, over the bottom of the pan ; then put in the rhu- barb, carefully placed, and not more than two or three slices in depth. Now roll a thin top crust, cover the pie, and jHHch the edges firmly together ; finish neatly, prick well with a fork, and cut a good cross-slit in the middle. Bake in a quick oven twenty-five to thirty minutes, or till the crusts are evenly broAvned, top and bottom. Serve cold. Rhubarb pie, well made, is very delicate in flavor ; indif- ferently done, it is one of the poorest.

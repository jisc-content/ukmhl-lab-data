A good rule for these, is three pints of water to six quarts of picked fruit; boil and skim, add one cup of sugar, and cook very slowly till soft ; say from thi-ee to five minutes after the boiling commences. If wanted for canning, the gages must be gathered before they ai’e quite ripe, as they faU to pieces badly. Stiuvwbekkies. =1= Strawberries, in ripe perfection, are not expected to see the fire ; but so transient are they, that we have sometimes to cook in order to keep them. Besides, it is very conven- ient to can them for temporary or future use, and open as they ai'e wanted ; berries that are ripe and sweet, but thor- ouglily firm and sound, are best. If fresh from the beds and free from sand or earth, do not wa.sh them, as it injures the flavor. But if wasliing is necessary, do it quickly, in a colander ; then drain well, remove the caps, throw out any refuse berries, and put those that are not perfect by them- selves, for separate attention. Allow for every five quarts of prepared fruit one quart of cold water, and two-thirds of a cup of sugar—though if fully ripe, little if any sugar is needed. Put the water into a porcelain kettle, and add the berries ; do not crowd it, as the fruit foams very much. Place over a slow fire, and when it comes to a boil, skim ; then add the sugar, and skim again ; stii- down the fruit with a wooden paddle, and cook slowly five to ten minutes ; a little longer, if intended for canning. Fruit Juices. In aU the frait juices, do not sweeten until after the strain- ing is done ; otherwise, a part of the sugar will be wasted. If the fruit is very acid, it is best to strain through a cloth —or an earthen colander—as tin discolors the liquid ; if through a cloth, use coarse linen or cotton, or old flannel;

407 VEGETABLES. PAUT III.] VEGETABLES. Full directions have already been "iven in Part II., for cooking vegetables in the hygienic way; if seasonings are wanted, as salt, sugar, etc., the cook will have no trouble in adding them to suit the taste; though in a sanitary point of view, the foods would be better without these condiments. All then that is needed in Part III., on cooking vege- tal)les, is to give in general terms the best methods of boil- ing, baking, stewing, etc., along with the little “ finishing ” with either milk or cream, that makes the hygienic dishes more acceptable to the ordinary palate. As elsewhere stated, the flavors natural to these products should neither be soaked out, nor burnt out; nor should the vegetables be half cooked, nor yet “cooked to death”; but each should have its own intrinsic goodness cai’efully preserved, and individualized. What is known as modern cookeiy, might very properly be styled, “The ai*t of spoiling foods”; their essence is wasted in preparing and cooking them, after which a feeble atonement is attempted, by adding pungent and stimulating condiments, the effect of which is to cover up the otherwise obvious “ flatness,” and to tickle and de- ceive the palate. It will be observed, that about the only dressing named in the following recipes for vegetables, is a litlh cream—to which it may be objected, that this aiiicle is not always to be had; and rarely in almndance. The objection is not weU taken, as the lawyers say; in the first place, it is only “a little” that is wanted; and in the next place, the disuse of butter—were it general—would afford aU the cream that is required; for the latter is necessarily consumed in making the former. However, if the people mud have butter, and can not afford to jirovide the cream, then they will simply have to substitute the one for the other, in the recij^es here given; that is, for “cream,” read, “fresh but- ter,” using it sparingly.

It is a bad plan to rise from the table, rush out into a freezing atmosphere, and take a long cold ride ; the body becomes chiUed and digestion is apt to be interfered with. A few minutes’ brisk walking in the morning, filling the lungs with fresh air, at every breath, is an excellent tonic before breakfast. Try it—you that are not too feeble to leave the room. As a rule, fruits and vegetables are best served at sepa- rate meals; vegetables, if eaten, should be taken at dinner —near the middle of the day. Raw ripe fruits, as apples, berries or cherries, are fine for breakfast, and best at the beginning of the meal. Avoid the frequent use of soft, sloppy foods ; and also of soft bread ; give the teeth something to do, if you would have them grow strong, and keep clean. Do not take very hot or very cold foods or drinks ; these crack the enamel of the teeth, and destroy them ; they also weaken the sahvary glands, enfeeble the stomach, and im- pair digestion.

To secure a good SAveet breath, the digestion must bo perfect and the teeth clean. Use the brush after eating, not before. Some persons brush their teeth the first thing in tho moiming and the last thing at night; this leaves them un- brushed between breakfast and dinner, and between dinner and supper—or in other words, only clean at night.

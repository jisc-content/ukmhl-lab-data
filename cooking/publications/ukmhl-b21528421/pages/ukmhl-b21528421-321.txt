Those who really desire to Hve hygienically—and there- fore healthfully—wiU find it to their advantage to select in the main from Part II., leaving Part III. for only occasional reference. Many of the puddings described in the following recipes, are made chiefly of fruits and cereals, and contain an little as possible of that very unhygienic combination, “milk, eggs and sugar,” which is so bad for the hver. vVnd the dressings, when any are used, are most of them as j)lain as the puddings themselves ; they contain no brandies, sher- ries, or other wines ; no sjiices, no butter, and not a large amount of sugar.

And many of the puddings that are to be eaten “ lukewarm,” may be served cold, if desired. When bread-crumbs are used in the making, have them dry, and rather stale ; and part at least, of good home-made Graham loaf, unsweetened. If sweet fruits, as currants or raisins, are among the ingredients required, look them over carefully, wash in a colander tiU they are free from sediment, and then dry thoroughly before dredging with flour. Use no spices or pungent flavorings, and of course no wines or brandies, either in the puddings or sauces. Butter, too, had lietter be omitted from both ; when it is cooked or heated, it is particularly indigestible. If eggs enter into the com- bination, see that they are fresh ; and sejiarate the yolks and whites carefuUy before beating. In oiling the dishes have them cold, to prevent sticking ; take for this purpose the fat from clean dripping, or a little pure olive oil. If the ordinary Graham flour is used, you may have to put it through a coarse sieve. Endeavor to "et pure sodtii

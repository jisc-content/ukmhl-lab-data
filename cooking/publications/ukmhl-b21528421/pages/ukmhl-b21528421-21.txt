3 INTRODUCTORY. nearly supply tlie waste of the various tissues. There are, no doubt, many varieties in the vegetable kingdom which can be and sometimes are used for foods, but which rank low in nutritive value, and are otherwise inferior in quality ; these, if eaten, are recommended only as occasional dishes. If we follow scientific analysis, we must place first in the rank of nutritious foods, the various preparations of wheat; then tlie other grains, some of which are better adapted to our wants than others. Fruits, as a class of foods, are ranked higher than vegetables by hygienists, and some fruits higher than others ; while among the vegetables proper, there are certain kinds that are better suited for human food than others. The flesh of animals, as will hereafter be shown, does not begin to compare with the whole grains—or even mth some vegetables—in the quantity of nutritive matter contained ; so that if used, it must fall below the latter in respect to nutrition. Besides, it cairies with it a certain amount of substance that can not be utilized by the vital organs ; whence it follows that these organs must do extra work in expelling this substance from the vital domain. All animals, however healthy, are everj"- moment of their lives throwing off a large per cent, of worn-out or effete matter; many times larger than that which is expelled from the surfaces of fruits or vegetables. This matter is in every tissue, and in every drop of blood or other fluid in the tissues; nor does the act of killing the animal improve the condition of things. On the contrary, the moment that life is extinct decomposition begins, and the waste is much more rapid ; hence the use of antiseptics, as salt, soda, saltpetre, etc., to arrest decay. Animal foods therefore are exceedingly unstable, not to say impure, in their best estate ; whence their character as iriftammatory food. All animal products, as butter, eggs, cheese, etc., partake of this character, in a greater or less

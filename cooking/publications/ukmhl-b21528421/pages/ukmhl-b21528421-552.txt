UELa'l'U THE HOUSEHOLD. m [part III. no bread is used, take as muck potato as there is meat; some like twice as much, provided there is plenty ot cold gravy to moisten ; in the absence of this, you may have to use a bit of fresh butter. Cut the meat in thin sHces, always across the gr’ain, and chop fine; put the gravy into a stew-jian, add a little boil- ing water, and slice in one or two onions, if liked ; cover closely, and cook ten minutes. Then add the meat, cover again, and let it get well heated through ; then the potato, stirring weU together, and laying on the lid. Continue the cooking ten to fifteen minutes, or long enough to make all very hot, and to blend the flavors thoroughly; stir often. A good breakfast dish is made as follows : Make a fine hash of beefs tongue (some use corned beef), and cold po- tato, using the liquor in which the tongue was boiled, to moisten; then cook as before. You can have more potato than meat, if you like ; and a little onion sliced and par- boiled, may be added if desired. Baked Hash.4|: Take cold beef, mutton or lamb, or some of each, slice it very thin across the grain, and chop fine ; moisten A^th a little cold gravy or meat juice, from sweet dripping; and if you like an onion, slice it as thin as possible, and parboil ten minutes before putting it in. Prepare some stale bread- crumbs fiom good home-made Graham loaf, if you have it; there should be about as much bread as meat. Stir all to- gether; and if the gravy added does not make the mixture wet enough—it should be rather moist—add a very little boiling water, and stir well. Put the hash into an iron bread-pan, smooth the top nicely, and bake in a hot oven fifteen or twenty minutes; it should be slightly browned or cmsted, top and bottom.

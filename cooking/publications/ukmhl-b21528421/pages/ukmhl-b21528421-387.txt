PAKT III.] :iGO CUSTARDS, BLANC-MANGES, ETC. 1. Make them only in cool or cold weather, and not too often. 2. Use as few eggs as are necessary, and as little sugar as the palate will tolerate. This latter (the palate), it must be remembered, is susceptible of education or training, either in right or wi'ong directions. 3. Have milk that is free from imler, and otherwise of good quality ; without good milk you can not have good custard. 4. See that the eggs are absolutely fresh; the worst of dishes is a custard made with stale eggs. 5. Have the eggs colJ, separate the yolks and whites with the greatest care, and beat by themselves—the whites to a stiff froth. G.

Or if preferred, leave out the Avhitcs till the custard is cold, and either stir them through it, or pile the froth on top. 10.

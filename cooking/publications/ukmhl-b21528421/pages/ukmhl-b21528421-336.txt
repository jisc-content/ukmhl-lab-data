318 [part III. HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. Baked Fruit RoLL.4i: Make the same as the last, rolling the dough in one Avide sheet; when the fruit is secured inside, lay the roll in an eai’then or granitized iron pan, slightly oiled. Place this in a dripping-pan containing a little boiling water, and bake in a steady oven ; turn another pan over the top, if it browns too fast. At the end of half an hour remove the dish from the pan of Avater, and bake, covered, three-quar- ters of an hour longer ; this wiU. broAATi the bottom as Avell as the top ; * and the half hour’s baking in the steam of the boiling Avater, will make the crust softer, and less liable to crack open and let out the fruit juice.

If you bake, manage the same as in the last recipe, except that you make two roUs instead of one ; lay them a little apart in the pud- ding-dish, and bake the first half horn' in a pan containing boiling water ; then bake, coA'^ered, three-quarters of an hour in the dry oven. If the pudding is to be steamed, roU a clean napkin around it, leaAnng plenty of room to swell; put it into a coA’ered tin basin, and place in a steamer over a pot of

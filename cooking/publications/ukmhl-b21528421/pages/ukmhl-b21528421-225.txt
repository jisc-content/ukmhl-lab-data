PART II.] FRUITS AND FRUIT JUICES. 207 Stewed Sweet Ai^ples.4= Select sweet ajiples, all perfect, and a little underripe ; pare them nicely, trimming out the blossom ends, but leav- ing in the stems. Wash, to remove knife-rust, and put them into a fruit-kettle, adding enough cold water to about half cover them. Set the kettle over a moderate lire, let it come to a boil, and skim; cook slowly for at least an hour, removing the lid, if tin. Do not stir or break the apples. When done take from the fire, and set awa}^ till perfectly cold; then lift cai’efully into the fruit-dish, and seiwe whole, with their own luscious juices. Stewed Apples.—( Unpared.) Pick out smooth apples with clear skins; bright, rosy ones are best, ’\^dpe them well and cut in halves, removing the stems and blossom ends, and taking out the cores, or any imperfect spots. After washing, put them into a fruit- kettle (by a fruit-kettle is meant either the porcelain-lined, or one of granitized iron ware—never brass, copper or tin), about half cover with cold water, put on the lid, and stew slowly without stuTing, till the apples are soft. Then take from the fire, uncover, and set away in a cool place; when cold, lift cai’efuUy into a dish, keeping the fruit as whole as possible. SrnvMED Apples. Prepare as for baking, leaving the skins on, and steam two or three hours, or until soft.

HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. [PABT II. 112 then bake in a hot oven thirty to forty minutes. This bread is best eaten warm, or not quite cold. Instead of the above mushes, cold rice or cracked wheat can be used. If corn mush is taken, white flour kneaded in makes a very sweet roU ; but the dough must be mixed almost as soft as it can be handled, and then baked in a very hot oven. Wheaten Gems. If hard rolls are the best of all the breads, gems are among the poorest, owing to their soft and rather moist texture ; there is a great difference, however, in the way they are made. Stir into cold water (ice-water is best), enough coarse Graham flour, unsifted, to make a tolerably stiff batterâ€”not thin enough to settle smooth when lifted in the spoon. If the batter is too thin or too thick, the bread wiU not be light. For ordinary Graham, unsifted, two parts water and three of flour, are about the right proportions. Beat vigorously, and dip into hot gem-pans of cast-iron ; if clean, they need no oiling. Set them on top of the stove until well heated, and fiU them not quite even full ; bake in a very hot oven, thii-ty to forty minutes. Or if you like more crust, fiU only half or two-thirds full, and bake hardly so long. If properly made and thoroughly weU done, the gems will be very light, spongy, and comparatively diy. Fruit Gems. ]\Iake a batter as above of unsifted Graham flour, rather coarse, and stir in sweet currants ; then bake as before. The currants should be carefully picked over, and well washed in a colander before using. Instead of these, raisins steamed, or partially stewed in a very little water, and mixed with the batter, are good ; the seedless raisins may be used without steaming.

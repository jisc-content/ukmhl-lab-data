MEAT STEWS, ETC. 525 PART IIT. J bot platter, draiu the gravy into a bowl, and skim off most of the grease. Turn the tomato and gravy together, heat and stir till the two are well incorporated, and pour the sauce over the meat. Mutton may be served in the same way ; and so may beef’s tongue. The sauce may be made of canned toma- toes rubbed thi’ough a colander, and cooked a shorter time. IMutton and Tomato Stew.

Set the kettle where it will simmer slowly one hour, or till the meat is almost tender; then pour in a few spoonfuls of boiling water, or (if you use canned tomatoes) half a cup of hot tomato juice. Turn the meat once or twice, and cook from twenty to thirty minutes longer ; then lay it on a platter, thicken the gravy with a little browned flour, or some bits of butter rolled in flour, boil up a moment, and pour it over.

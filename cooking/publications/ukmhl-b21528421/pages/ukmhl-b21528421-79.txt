SALT. G1 PART I.J than we would relish salt or pepper in strawbeiTies, stewed plums, or apple sauce. In other words, habit enables us to relish what we would otherwise bai’ely tolerate. S.ALT. The fact that chloride of sodium, or common salt, is ordinarily found in the secretions and excretions of the hiunan body, and also in the blood, has given rise to the behef that it is a nccessirry constituent in human food. And some physiologists have gone so fai' as to make the state- ment that it must he eaten, or the general health will suffer. Admitting, for the sake of the argument, that salt is one of the proximate principles legitimately obtained from the tissues of the human body, and that it is therefore indis- pensable in the vital economy, the question arises, why we should eat it, any more than that we should eat chloride of potassium, or carbonate of lime, or phosphate of magnesia. They, too, are found in the bones, and are obtainable from them; then why not eat these ? The reply is, that there is no need; that the grains and other food products of the eaidh contain aU the elements necessary to make these several constituents. This is very true; and it is equally true that the products named contain the other proximate principles —aU of them—that are found in the human body in its normal condition. In dealing with this, the physiological argument, we may as well recognize the fact that the chloride of sodium found in the perspiration or other excretions, and also in the saliva, milk, tears, and other secreted fluids, as well as in the blood, is largely if not wholly due to the presence of the salt taken with the food; and the fact iliat it is found in these fluids is no proof whatever that it belongs there. We can easily put into the stomach, whiskey, sulphur, Iodine, strychnine, almost any thing, and afterward find these sub- stances in the blood, and in most or all of the secretions or

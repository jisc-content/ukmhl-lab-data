Boiled custards, ju'oiierly made, are certainly more wholesome, and in flavor they are far more delicate. The baked ones, however, are greatly improved by heating the milk almost to a boil before the eggs are added, by usmg these and the sugar in moder- ation, and by extremely slow cooking in the oven. See that the milk is free from admixture with water, and other- wise of gocxl quality ; if not new, a httle cream added would be an improvement. To one quart of good rich milk, allow from three to four tablespoonfuls of sugar, and three large, or four small eggs. Heat the milk not quite to boiling, and hft from the fire ; beat the yolks moderately, whip in the sugar till light, and add to these the hot milk, a little at a time, stirring con- stantly. Then stir in the whipped whites, pour into stone- ware cups, place these inside a chripiiing-pan with boiling water in it, and bake in a very slow oven. As soon as the custard sets, it is done ; indeed, there is only one correct way in this process, and that is to bake slowly, and not a moment too long ; if cooked till it separates, the custard is spoiled. Serve nearly or quite cold, from the cuj)s.

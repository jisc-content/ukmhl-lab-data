HE.VLTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. 74 [part r. is not iu a condition to be j^roperly acted on by the intes- tinal juices. The consequences are, first, that the digestive function in this pai*t of the alimentary canal is overtaxed ; in other words, the chyme can not be made into chyle with- out an extra drain upon the digestive supplies in that quarter. Second, that the chyle formation is not as finely elaborated and vitalized as it would have been had the mouth and stomach digestion been complete. Third, that the chyle is too cnide in quality to be fully absorbed by the lacteals, and carried into the blood. Now, if the mastication of the food has been imperfect, the formation of chyme interfered with, and the chyle not of the best quality, what shall we say of the residual matters in the large intestine ? If the elaborated material has fallen below the normal standard, the residue will most assuredly be in anything but the proper condition. If there were crude qualities in the chjane and chyle, there is crudeness intensified here ; the half-digested foods which could not undergo absorption in the small intestine are earned along the alimentary canal, and there is not a sufficient quantity of intestinal juices to moisten the mass properly. Instead of the normal condition of plastic matter, there is “ chaff and water,” so to speak, the latter being absorbed in the intestinal canal. Then comes iiTitation of the mucous sur- faces, engendering heat (feverishness), and aU those dis- agreeable symptoms which betray the presence of undigested matter. In other words, we have constipation, which is one of the forms of indigestion. A result somewhat similar follows, when too much food bas been eaten ; instead of being vitalized and appro- priated, it rots or decomposes in the alimentary canal, and gases are given off. But by far the greatest detriment of all is in the bad blood that follows imperfect digestion. If the chyle is not properly elaborated, every tissue in the body must

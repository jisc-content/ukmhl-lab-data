PASTRIES. PART II.] 1(55 Peach Cobbler.=|= Select good peaches, fresh from the orchard, and not over- ripe ; they should he barely mellow ; chngstones are best. A\'ash them, and rub with a coarse cloth to remove the down. If large, pare them, C!U‘e being taken to make the parings as thin as possible ; the best of the fruit lies imme- diately under the skin. If the peaches are small, but rea- sonably fair and smooth, you need not peel; simply wash well, and remove the blemished jiortions. AVlien ready, put tiiem into a deep pan of granitized ii’on, or in a wide and rather deep basin of stone or eai’then Avare, adding cold Avater till it rises jiretty Avell up the sides of the dish. Cover Avith a stiff cream jiaste, mixed as for other j^ies, and roUed about a quarter of an inch thick ; prick weU Avith a fork, cut a good cross-sht in the center, and place in a moderate oven ; bake from an hour and a lialf to tAvo hours, according to the size of the pie. Eeduce the heat as the baking pro- ceeds, and invert a jian over the top if it broAAOis too fast. When done and nearly cold, lift off the crust, and turn half the fruit into a deep earthen boAA’l; then lay back part of the cnist, and pour over it the rest of the peaches ; cover AAuth the crust that remains, placing it right side up, and set the pie aAvay in a cool place for several hours, or OA'^er night, before servung. If the bake-pan is not pretty deep, you had better stew some peaches prepared as for the, pie, and pour over as you break it up ; this will make plenty of juice. Stew the sauce sIoavIv, in not too much water, and cool before adding it. If preferred, leaA^e the pie unbroken, set it aAvay till cold, and serve in the dish, cutting the cnist in regular ^lieces. If freestone peaches are used, peel them, cut in halves, take out the pits, and be careful to remove any bitter poriions about the latter. YelloAv ]ieaches of good rich flavor, clings or freestones, are excellent.

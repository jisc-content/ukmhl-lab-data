PART II.] PRESERVING I'RUITS AND VEGETABLES. 235 pans, sprinkle a little siij^ar over, and set in the oven till fairly heated through; then hiiish ar’ound the stove, or on shelves above it. As the drying proceeds, stir occasionally, and let the juices that have escaped be reabsorbed. If there is a hot sun, the fruit after it is heated in the oven, may be sot outside to dx*y under fine wire screens, which will keep flies and other insects from it. All fruit that is dried in the ojien air, should be thorouglily heated before it is packed away; this will prevent it from getting wonny. \pples that are tart enough to cook to pieces and make a smooth sauce, may be stewed in as little water as possible, then spread on plates, and dried in an oven or dry-house. AVhen soaked, make into pies, or use for sauce. Peaches and other pulpy fruits, can be dried in the same way. None but the liest rpiality of fruit should be reserved for drying, and it should not be overripe. Drying Vegetables. Some vegetables arc veiw good gathered while green, and dried for winter use; among these are garden peas, Lima lieans, and other shell beans. They must be gathered and dried before they begin to ripen—or when they are just right for the table. Peas especially, if too ripe, lose their sweetness and fine flavor. Green corn is excellent drted as follows: Take ears that are young and tender, either the evergreen, or the white (or yellow) flint; boil ten minutes, or until the milk sets; then split the grains with a sharp knife, and scrape out the corn, leaving the hulls on the cob. Spreiid it on plates, and dry, either in an oven or dry-house, or in the hot sun; stir well from time to time. Be sure it does not sour in the process; when dried in the sun, a good plan is to set the corn, already scraped out, into a prettx' hot oven, and scald or “ cook ” it before finishing out of doors. To prevent its getting wormy, heat thoroughly before putting it away; this

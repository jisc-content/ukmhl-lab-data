271 GRIDDLE-CAKES, PART III.] A mixture of half Graham and half lye (meal or flour), wet with sweet milk to the consistency of gem-batter, and baked, makes very good cakes. GRIDDLE-C A T\ blS Griddle-cakes ai'e not expected to form any considerable pai*t of the hygienic dietary. If indulged in at aU, it should only be occasionally, and then without the ordinary accom- paniments of butter and molasses, or syrup. If they can not be relished without condiments, or with the addition of plam fruits, stewed or canned, then they had better be dis- pensed with, altogether. Eaten in this simple manner, as an occasional breakfast dish on a cold morning, and with a good keen aj)petite to aid the digestion, they may now and then make their appearance without causing a bad head- ache, or a dull pain in the stomach. The best of all the grains for batter cakes, is buckwheat. To be first-class, it must be free from gxit, or other impur- ity or adulteration. Most of the buckwheat flour in our markets is largely mixed with poor white flour, “ shorts,” etc., and nearly all of it is too finely ground. Cakes made of good buckwdieat flour shordd brown nicel}’^, and they should be light and sweet. The following is a plain but good recipe for making them. Buckwheat Cakes. II pints (nearly) buckwheat flour. 1 quart warm water. I cup good hop yeast. 1 tablespoonful Graham flour, or fine corn meal— or you may take “ conneU.” Have the water no warmer than blood heat; pour half or two-thirds of it into a large earthen pitcher, and stir the floiu' in, a handful at a time; beat till there are no lumps.

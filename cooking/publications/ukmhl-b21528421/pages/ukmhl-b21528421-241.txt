FRUITS AND FRUIT JUICES. 223 PART II. J Raisins. Pick from the stems, tin-owing out imperfect raisins; then •wash, and stew in a moderate cpiantity of water, allowing, say, two and a half jiints cold water to every pint of picked fruit. Stew from forty to fifty minutes, or till tender, and let there be plenty of juice when done. If this sauce is too sweet, peel and slice in a lemon after taldng it from the fire. In the absence of lemons, a handful of dried red cui-rants may be cooked with the raisins. OlUVNGES. Oranges if perfect, ai*c a wholesome and finely flavored fruit; but as a rule, they are not easily digested with other fruits. They ai'e therefore best eaten by themselves; that is, between meals—or they may be sei-ved as a dessert, pro^ vided no other fruits fonn a part of the repast. Lemons. Lemons are so extremely acid, that, dieteticaUy speaking, they take the place of a condiment rather than a food. Like oranges, they form a better combination Avith vege- tables than Avith fruits; and they make a fine dressing, either for vegetables or meats. Lemon juice diluted Avith Avater, is often taken on an empty stomach for disordered liver. Bananas. Bananas (for weak stomachs at least) are best not eaten Avith other fmits. In fact, dieteticaUy considered, they be- long, like melons and tomatoes, Avith vegetables rather than Avith fruits. They are best eaten at the beginning of the meal, as they are rather hearty.

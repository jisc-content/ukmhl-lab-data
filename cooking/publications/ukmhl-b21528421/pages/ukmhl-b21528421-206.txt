If bought in the city market, it will take an hour and a half or two hours ; and the wax beans need half an hour longer; the water should be about all evajiorated, at the last. New potatoes, diâ€™opped in half an hour before finishing, improve their flavor ; and a little sweet cream thickened with a trifle of flour, and stirred in just before you hft them from the fire, is considered a further improvement.

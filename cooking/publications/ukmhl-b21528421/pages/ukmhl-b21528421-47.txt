i’AKT I.] ^YUE.VTEN VS. WHITE FLOUR. 29 three-fourths, '\^^eat has 8.2 pai-ts jihosphoric acid ; flour has 2.1 parts phosphoric acid—an impoverishment of about three-fourths. Wheat has O.G lime and O.G soda ; flour has 0.1 lime and 0.1 soda—an impoveiishment of five-sixths each. AVheat has 1.5 suliiluu'; floui’ has no sulphm\ AVheat has sulphuric acid 0.5 ; flour has no sulphui’ic acid. Wheat has silica 0.3 ; flour has no silica. “2. Flour is mostly starch—68.7 per cent. Its formula, chemical composition, is C 10, H 12, O 12—tliree elements ; cai’bon, hydrogen, oxygen. The human body contains at least twelve elements besides those of starch. How, then, c.an flour be nutritious with about three elements, when it should contain fifteen elements, in order to properly nomish and sustain the human body ? “ 3. Flour has less gluten than wheat. Gluten is the al- buminoid principle corresponding to the albumen, fibrin, and gelatine in the human body. “4, Dogs fed by Magendie (uhfeKirhe & Paget’s ‘Physi- ology ’) on flour bread, died in forty days ; other dogs, fed on bread from whole-wdieat meal or flour, flourished and throve. The three-fourths impoverishment of the mineral ingredients proved fatal to the first. AVliy should not man- kind suffer in some manner from living on impoverished food ? “5. The history of the Koman Empire in the time of Julius Cicsar shows that wheat, as an article of food, com- bined wdth fresh outdoor-air life, is capable of producing and sustaining the highest type of physical manhood the world ever saw. The empire was built up and maintained by soldiers whose main article of food -was wheat. “ 6. There is every probability that the present prevalence of late erupting and easily-decaying teeth is due for one cause to the use of flour as food. In eight hundred and eighty of the school children in Woburn, Lexington, and Bedford, Massachusetts, in 1874, under twelve years of ago,

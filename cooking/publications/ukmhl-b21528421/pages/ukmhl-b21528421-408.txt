iiEAT/m i:r the nouSEHOLD. [part III. 390 Prepare the sauce by stewing the apples in vei'y liitlo Avater; they should be rich in flavor, fine in texture, auvl rather tart; a few slices of quince stewed with them is an improvement, for those who like the flavor of that fi*uit.

Jellies, jams and SAorips, as ordinarily made, are in no sense hygienic, owing to the amount of sugar they contain. There is a process of converting fruit juices into jellies by evaporation, which, if successfully applied, would make them both wholesome and delicious. But as yet, the aid is so little understood, that generally speaking it is of no prac- tical value. No doubt the time ?c?7/ come, when the juices of fruits can be preserved in this form Avithout impairing

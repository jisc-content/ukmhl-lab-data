213 CANNING FRUITS, ETC. PART II. J Apples.—Take for canning, apples that have a fine suh- acicl flavor ; then quarter and core, or cut into eighths, add cold water enough to make them sufficiently juicy, and cook slowly till soft; the pieces should not he broken. Prepare sweet apples and quinces in the same way, except that you stai-t the quinces half cooking them before the apples are added. Can in glass. Pe.\ches.—Select fine fruit, not too ripe ; it should be firm to the touch. Pai’e thin, remoA'e the pits provided the peaches are not clingstones, and allow about one quaii; of cold water (less for very juicy fridt) to six quaids of peaches, prepared and cut; bring slowly to a boil and can. Kosy “clings” canned with the stones in, make the best sauce. Pears.—The Bartlett or other tart variety is best for can- ning ; remove the paring with a very thin knife, cut in halves, and take out the cores. Then add about one quart cold Avater to seven quarts of cut fruit, bring sloAvly to a boil, and set bacR where the kettle will simmer gently, nearly or quite an hour ; then diji into cans. Keep tho pieces as whole as possible. Plums.—For damsons, alloAv five pints cold Avater to five quai*ts of fruit; cook sloAvly, and when they come to a boil, skim; then add two cups of sugar, cook slowly about ten minutes, and put into glass cans. Green or blue gages require less water and sugar than the damsons, and scarcely any cooking ; three pints Avater and one cup of sugar for six qiiaids of fruit, would lie enough. The plums must be rather hard ; if beginning to soften, they aauII fall to pieces. Grapes.—Take about one-third as much cold Avater as there are grapes picked from the stems—or tAvo quarts water to six quarts fiTiit; bring slowly to a boil, skim, and cook or simmer five to eight minutes ; then can. Gr-vpe Juice.—Add one-third as much cold AV'ater as you

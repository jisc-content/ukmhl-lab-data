HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. 424 [part hi. after an lioui’’s time, to see if they are done ; too much cooking is as bad as too little. By all means do not let the pot go dry; if you do, the beans will be worthless. If water is needed, have it boiling hot; and add so sj)aringly that when done, there shall be scarcely more than a sj)Ooaiful left in the bottom.

When the water is nearly all out, add, say a third of a cuj;) of cream thickened with a little flour ; let this barely come to the bod, and then dish into the tureen.

Finish with cream or butter, the same as the last, and seiwe warm, not hot. Shelled Beans.

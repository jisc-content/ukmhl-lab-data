521 MEAT STEWS, ETC. PART m.J and dose from the air. Sluiko before usinj^, to j)i’eveut lumping. Good gravy is made by stirring into meat liquor enough browned flour to thicken moderately, and then bringing it to a boil; there must be no lumps. If a cream gravy is Avantcd, stir the flour into half a (uip (more or less) of cream, then add it to the meat liquor, and boil iqi a rno- jiient. Or you may make a gravy from bones (as heretofore described), or from lean meat, raw or cooked; or, take the drippings (fresh, or a day old) of a roast, remove the grease, and strain the gravy in the bottom if there is any sediment; if too strong, dilute with warm Avater before using it. If you make from cooked meat, or bones left from a roast or stew, add cold water, simmer slowly till the juices are all given out, then cool the licpior, strain and thicken. If from raAV meat (the trimmings of a steak Avill do), loound it, cut into small bits, and heat in a stew-pan over a very moderate fire. Cover closely, and stir often to keep the meat from sticking; it must not scorch. In fifteen or twenty minutes, or when it is fairly browned, add boiling water (a pint of the latter to a pound of meat), and let it simmer slowly two or three hours. AMien done, cool, settle, and strain. Breakfast Stew. A steAV—as good for dinner as breakfast^—that can be prepared on short notice, after you “ get home from meet- ing,” or from down toAvn shopping, is made as follows: Buy your meat the day before; two or three pounds of beef or mutton, either good sirloin (removing the suj)erfluous fat), or the poorer parts, as you can afford ; cut it in small 1)its, about an inch in length. Then put a little dripping into a pot, slice in an onion and carrot, and a turnip if you have it, and heat tiU the vegetables change color. Now put in the meat, add a pint of boiling Awater, cover closely, and stew A'ery slowly two hours, or till the meat is tender,

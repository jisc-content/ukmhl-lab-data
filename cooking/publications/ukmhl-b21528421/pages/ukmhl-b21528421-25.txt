7 INTnODUCTORY. Tlie question is frequently asked, wliethor the hygienic diet is to be recommended from an economic stand-point. So far as the table itself is concerned, the one way of living is probably about as expensive as the other ; in other words, the money that is usuiilly spent for tea, coffee, sugar, butter, meat, condiments, etc., is laid out for choice grains, ripe, di’ied or canned fruits, and the best of vegetables. But if there is a saving of time and money in the enjo^unent of uninternipted good health, then indeed, there is economy in hygienic living. A lady who has tried both ways, and who was formerly a patient and boarder in our house, gives her testimony as follows : “ My husband and I have been married twelve years; and it is only since leaving your house, two years ago, that we have ever been able to save a cent. Doctors, medicines, and what we then supposed to be the ‘ best of living,’ viz., meat three times a day, and beef-tea between meals for strength (?), ate up the small salary. Last year we bought a lovely little home, and on a salary of fifteen hundred dollars, we saved five hundred to pay on the place. And the diet—why, we never lived so well; good bread of Akr'on Graham flour, fr’esh vegetables, and the best of fruits and grains. We kept a horse, and hired a man to work the garden. We feel that we have only just begun to live. In health I am better ; more like my real self ; more sunshine, contentment, and happiness—aU owing to a good, pure diet, fresh air and exercise.” To those who may desire to understand more fully the Reasons why hygienists depart somewhat from the ordi- nary methods of preparing foods, the chapters in Part I. may be of interest. And should the reader find in these more or less repetition of what has been stated elsewhere in the work, the simple fact that it has all been written piecemeal may in part account for it. The items have been jotted down from time to time, as the writer could note

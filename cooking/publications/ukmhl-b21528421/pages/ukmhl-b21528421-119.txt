UNLEAVENED BREAD. PART II.] 101 UNLEAVENED BREAD. To prepare the “ staff of life ” as it should he, four things are necessary. First, we must have good grains ; second, these must be cleaned, and properly ground into flour or meal; third, the flour or meal must be rightly mixed into dough or batter ; and lastly, the dough or batter must be well baked. The whole or unhulled wheat, as elsewhere stated, is said 1 o contain no less than fifteen elementary principles, all of which are necessary to build up the structures of the bod3^ Beneath the outer or Avoody portion of the grain, lies an abundance of glutinous matter ; here also are found most of the carbonates, phosphates, and other mineral substances that enter so largely into the formation of the teeth, bones, cartilages, etc. Beneath these again, is a substance that is composed chiefly of starch, the elementary principles of the latter being carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. It is this part of the Avheat that is used in making the white flour of com- merce, paidicularly the superfine. So far, then, as the num- ber of chemical elements is concerned, Graham flour stands to starch—and iiroximately to white flour—^in the propor- tion of fifteen to tln-ee, or five to one. Now, when Ave con- sider that bakers’ bread (and that is Avhat the masses live upon in cities) is made of this impoverished Avhite flour ; that it is raised by fermentation, AA'hich still further impairs its nutrient qualities ; that it is to a large extent imjireg- nated with alum, and is often half sour before baking—Ave can safely say that this is about the slenderest “ staff ” that ever a living creature sought to lean upon. Graham (or unbolted) flour is too often manufactured from small, shrunken gi-ains of spring wheat, or other poor material. This is Avhy there is ordinarily such a large per cent, of bran in it; too much entirely for eitlier good health or good eating. An excellent article for Graham

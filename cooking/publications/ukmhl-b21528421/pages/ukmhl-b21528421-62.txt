HEALTH Ils^ THE HOUSEHOLD. 41 [part I. is of itself degrading; eveu beef-loving England will not, it is said, allow a butcher to serve on a jiuy, pai-ticularly if the case to be tried is one involving hiunan life. One of the foulest mimlers that ever disgi*aced a peacefid commu- nity, was committed some years ago in Oliio, by a man (supposed by his neighbors to be a peaceable citizen) who had spent the day in killing hogs; he j)ursued liis victim, a young woman, to the village chm’ch-3'ard, and there stabbed her with the very knife with which he had cut the throats of the swine. As to the actual necessity for a meat diet, it is not true, as some suppose, that vigorous health can not be maintained without it. On the contrary, “four-tenths of the human race,” according to Virey, subsist exclusively on a vegetable diet, and as many as seven-tenths are practically vegeta- rians.* Then, there is an argniment outside of physiology—one tliat sooner or later mU have to be considered—why the llesh of animals should not form a pait of the diet of human beings. At the present rate of increase of the human fami- ly, the surface of the earth will, in a few centuries, be far too densely populated to admit of the raising of animals to be used as food. For it has been shown that it would require more than foiiy times as much land to feed a man on meat, as it would to feed him on grains.f It follows, therefore, that when land is scarce, as it mU be when the earth is many times more thickly populated than at present, the acres will have to be utilized in the way that is most profitable; not in the raising of hogs, cattle and sheep, but in the cultivation of grains, and other products of the soil.

The parents, when I cut off the supply, did not suffer percejiti- bly, and in a short time unlearned the habit. Neither the old ones nor their progeny will touch it now,” “ A hungi’y cow will eat what is called ‘ salted hay,’ whereon tlie brine of the sea has crystallized ; but invariably the same cow wiU turn from it to good, weU-cured meadow kay,” “The whole of the bii'ds avoid salt. It is fatal to chickens and tame birds, as every housewife knows,” Chicken-cholera, this writer thinks, is caused in part by the salted food given the fowls from the table, wild birds not being subject to disorders of this kind. He fuidher adds, “I believe it is well ascertained that wdien hogs get a moderate amount of brine, or pickled salt meat, it is impossible to save them.” Mr. Colburn is firmly of the belief that the use of salt is a prohfic cause of impaired digestion, owing to the unnatui’al flow of saliva and other digestive fluids which it stimulates. He also thinks that by causing indigestion, it to some extent injures the teeth. All hygienists who have totally abstained from the use of salt, even for a few months, lose their relish for it, and after a time it becomes positively distasteful. And to illus- trate the force of habit—even in leaving it off—it is a matter of common observation that unsalted foods which only come to the table occasionally, are less relished than those that are eaten daily. Another exj^erience, which every one has to find out for himself, is this ; salt when taken by any one not accustomed to its use, invariably creates thirst; and where there has been chronic inflammation in any part of the aliinentai'y canal, and it has disappeared, owing to strict hygienic living, salt food, used even for a slioii time, gener- ally causes its reappeai’ance.

395 JELLIES, JAMS AND SYRUPS. PART III.] For all small fruits, as berries and ciu-raiits, a lady who has had iiiueh experience in jelly-making, recommends the following method: Crush the fruit, put it into a stone jar, set this in a vessel of boiling water, and heat over a slow lire till you can express the juice; after squeezing out the latter, add by measure an equal (piautity of water, and boil twenty minutes. Then put in a pound of sugai* (dried in the oven) for every pint of the mixed fluid, heat till the sugar is melted, and put into glasses.

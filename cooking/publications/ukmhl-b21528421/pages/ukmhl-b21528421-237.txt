If the berries are very ripe, more water and less sugar will be needed; say two-thii’ds of a cup of sugai’ and three and a half pints of water, to two quarts of sound fruit. Cranbemes may be canned for winter use, the same as other small fruits. Or, they may be kept under water in a cool place ; they are said to keep in this way nearly or quite aU winter. The water .should be changed occasionally, and the vessel containing it should stand in a clean, cool place, well ventilated.

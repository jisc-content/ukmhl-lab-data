HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. 148 [part II. ket arc as follows : Coarse liominy, in wliicli tlie kei'nels are cut through once or twice ; fine hominy, which has them cut into several pieces ; and samp, which is finer still. Coarse Hominy. =|= Staid in hot or cold water, and cook in a closed steamer four hours ; allow four quaids of water to one of grain. In the absence of a steamer, cook in a farina-kettle an hour longer ; or you may boil in a pot over a slow fire, stiiring frequently to jireveut sticking. This grain may be soaked over night, and cooked in the same water ; it wiU then take less time by about an hour, but the flavor is hardly as good. The only admissible dressing, if any is required, would lie a spoonful of cream, stiiTed in a few minutes before finishing. Fine Hominy, or Corn Grits.=|= Fine liominy is prepared the same as coarse, except that the corn is cut into smaller pieces. It is cooked like the coarse grits, only in less water ; you may take one cup of grits to three and a half cups water, hot or cold. Steam four hours, though thi-ee and a half AviU do. If any “ fin- ishing” is wanted, a spoonful or two of cream stirred in five minutes before dishing, is the best. Samp.=|= Samp (called hominy by some) is made from white flint corn. It differs from the “ gidts ” described in the last two recipes, in being cut very much finer ; it requires more water to cook it than hominy (or corn grits), but less time. Take one jiai-t samp and foui’ and a half jiaids water, hot or cold, and steam two hours and a half. A little cream or new milk stirred in at the last, is considered by most persons a “delightful finishing.” Fruit and fruit juices, as rasji- beiTies, blackberries or cherries, make a good dressing ; though some prefer the grain by itself. Serve warm.

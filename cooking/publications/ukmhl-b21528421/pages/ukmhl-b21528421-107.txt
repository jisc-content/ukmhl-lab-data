X>AKT I.] 80 FOOD COiMDINAllONS, ETC. 5. A good rule, when suppers are eaten, is to make the sometimes say, they quarrel with each other. For while it may be true that thoroughly sound stomachs can digest almost anything, and feel no unpleasant sensations from iill sorts of heterogeneous combinations, it is not true that in- valids, or persons of feeble digestion, can do likewise. After more than twenty yeai*s’ experience and careful ob- sciwation, the AVTiter is fully convinced that in order to get the l'>est possible results from nutrient materials, we must not ignore those kindred ties among food products which make an agreeable combination ; nor must we be oblivious to those opposite qualities in them, which by fine contrast please equiilly well. Take, for examjfie, sweet potatoes and tomatoes ; these make a good combination, and very ac- ceptable to most persons, the one being sweet, the other acid ; the one higlily nutritious, and the other decidedly j'^iicy. To those who have not made this subject a study, the following hints may be of practical use ; though in many things it is next to impossible to lay down definite rules : 1. Finits and vegetables should not, as a rule, be eaten together; that is, at the same meal; if they are so eaten, persons with feeble digestive organs will usually suffer. 2. If vegetables are eaten, the noonday meal is the best time to take them, two or three varieties being quite suffi- cient. Tomatoes do weU with vegetables, grains or meats; but they should not, as a rule, be eaten with fruits. 3. The Iifish potato seems to be an exception among vegetables ; it is so unaggi’essive in its nature that it seldom quaiTels with anything. It may therefore be eaten (by most persons) with either fruits or vegetables ; and it always does well with grains. 4. Fimits and cereals are particularly suited to the morn- ing and evening meals ; and very little other food is re- quired.

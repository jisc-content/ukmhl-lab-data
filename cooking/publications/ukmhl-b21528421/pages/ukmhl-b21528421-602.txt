Hot food also causes excess in eating, so that it is rather by a sense of fullness and opjjression than by a natural satisfaction of the appetite, that one is prompted to cease eating. An e\idence of the weakening of the stomach by hot food, is seen when one eats an apple immediately after the usual hot meal. Fruit thus taken lies like a stone upon the stomach, the en- feebled nerves being injuriousl}'^ affected by its presence; whereas, in their normal condition, they are stimulated to a most agreeable activity by it. “From the abuse of the organs of digestion, result a host of diseases. A life-long weakness of the gastric nerves, with cramjDS and inflammation of the stomach, are its com- mon fruits. To this cause also is attributable the almost universal prevalence of colds, which are the direct result of unnatural temperatui'e conditions of the body. The blood artificially heated causes an excessive perspiration, since it produces an increased, but injmious activity of the skin; and upon the least change of temperature, the perspiration is condensed upon the body, and causes colds and stiffness, and this all the more certainly when the blood is impure, and the tissues overloaded. From the same prolific cause, result also the uneasiness and languor experienced after eating hot food. But the evil effect can not be overcome by the usual after-dinner nap. This can not replace the ele- ments lost from our food, nor give the enlivening impulse experienced after partaking of ripe fruits in their natural state. “ It is indeed argued, that our northern climate requires that food should be eaten hot, as one means of maintaininer the bodily temperature; but if this be true of man, it must apply with equal force to all animals; and since man alone seems to require hot food, the argument loses its force.

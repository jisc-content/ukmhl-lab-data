When done, drain off and save the juice, and mash the apples very fine, leaving no lumps ; then stir- into them a part of the juice drained off, of which there should be enough to make the fruit rather moist. Line the pie- pans with a cream paste mixed cpiite stiff, and rolled pretty thin ; add the mashed fruit, spreading it less than half an inch thick, and put on the top crusts, also thin. Press the edges well together, trim off closely with a knife, and finish as neatly as possible. Prick deeply with a fork, and bake in a quick oven twenty minutes, or just till the cnists are done, and slightly browned. Seiwe cold ; grape juice is a good accompaniment. Apple Cobbler.=|= Pare good rich apples, moderately tai*t, and not too ripe ; core and quarter, or cut into eighths, and put them into a dish that is two or three inches deep, and made of stone- ware or granitized iiâ€™on. Add a little water, unless the fruit is very juicy, and cover with the ordinary cream paste, roll- ing it about twice the usual thickness ; prick well with a fork. Then bake in an even oven about an hour and a (piarter, moderating the heat toward the last, and taking care not to scorch the crust; you may lay a paper over the top, if it browns too fast. The long, slow cooking gives the fruit a fine, rich taste. Tliis pie m.akes a very good break- fast dish ; it is served in the bake-pan. You may make it in the afternoon for the following morning, or early in the morning for the noonday meal. Another way, very good, is to bake in a quick oven forty to fifty minutes, and serve as soon as cold. Or you may fill the pan with the sliced apples, adding no water, and if the fruit is a mild acid, no sugar ; then cover with either a light cream paste, or a cream batter paste ; if the latter is used, bake an hour, and serve warm.

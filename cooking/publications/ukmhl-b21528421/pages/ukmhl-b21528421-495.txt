477 POULTRY. PAIIT III.J Cold Sliced Turkey. If there is a consicTerahle portion of the turkey left over from the roast of the previous day, a good iilan is to cut the dai’k and white meat into thin slices, and serve for din- nei’, with warm mashed potato and other plain vegetables. The cranberry sauce, if there is any left, will be a good ac- comiDaniment. Turkey Pie.iJ^ Instead of cold sliced turkey, as in the last, a may be maile—which many prefer, even to the fresh roast. Take all the meat, white mid dark, from the bones, rejecting any tough skin or gi-istle (these put along with the bones), and cut it in inch bits, slicing the hm’d muscles that surround the “ drum-sticks.” Set this by for the pie. Then crack the bones to pieces, put them and the inferior bits into a pot, and cover with cold water ; fit on the lid, and stew veiy slowly three-quarters of an horn-; the pot should sim- mer, rather than boil. When the strength is all extracted strain out the liquor, adding any gravy left over, and thick- en it a trifle with wliite flom’ wet smooth with milk or water ; return to the fire, let it boil up a moment, and set it off. Then peel some potatoes, and cut them in pieces scarcely an inch thick ; or if small, into quarters ; you may have half or two-thirds the quantity there is of meat. Put these into a stew-pan, add a cuiiful of boiling water, and parboil seven to ten minutes; then drain joerfectly diy, cover closely, and set where they will keep hot. If cut a little smaller, you may omit the parboiling ; they will cook in the pie by the time a thick crust is done. Now fill a bake-dish nearly full, with the meat and potato mixed ; if there are a few crumbs of cold dressing, you may put them in ; then pour over the made gravy, filling the dish half or two-thirds full ; if there is not quite enough, add a little boiling water.

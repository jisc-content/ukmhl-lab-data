PART II.] PRESERVING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. 237 should he better understood. The following extract, cliiiped from a daily pajier and talcen from the New York Journal of Commerce, is evidently a mere fragment of an aidicle on this subject: “ As the juice ran fresh from the apples, before it could begin to ferment, it was conducted in a pipe to a lai'ge open evaporating-pan over a rude brick fiumace. The cider flowed steadily in a stream into one end of the pan, which was some ten or twelve feet long, meandering through the compartments; it boded as it progressed, and foamed up at the fui'ther end, where it was drawn off and poui’ed into clean new wooden tubs and jiRils (made on the spot), and became a cleiu*, solid claret-colored jelly, without addition of sugar or anything else. It is a method of utdizing cider, reducing it to a form which well repays long transpoidation to niiU’ket; and it adds to the city table a luxiuy fully equal to expensive jellies, at a very low price. The jeUy is sold at the factory for about a doUar a gallon in the package. This is a simple!’, cheaper, and more remunerative, as well as more useful product of apples, than cider brandy; and I marvel now at the orchards loaded with fruit, which I saw two years ago, and this year in New Hampshire, rotting ungathered because it would not pay to pick them. They told me at this cider-mill, that they were paying eight to twelve cents a bushel for apples delivered at the mill. The most accessible railway station is eighteen miles distant, at Shelburne Falls, in Massachusetts. I recommend apple jelly, made without sugar or gelatine, as a capital addition to good mutton.” A process similar to this, if not identicfd with it, is that ah’eady described in the making of an article called “ Po- marius,” under the head of Fruits and Fruit Juices. By this process it would seem that making fruit jellies without the addition of sugar, is not only possible, but (in the near future certainly) practicable.

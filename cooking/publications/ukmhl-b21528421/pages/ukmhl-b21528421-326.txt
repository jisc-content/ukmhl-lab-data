HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. 308 [part III. I cup sugar. 1 pint (nearly) coarse corn meal. Single handful white flour. Time—three to four hom’s, slow oven. Pare, core and slice the sweet apples, and chop them fine, having a full quart in all. Then put into a stone or eaiihen crock, or a farina-kettle, two quarts of the milk ; if new milk can not be had, add a cuji of cream to the skimmed. Set it on the stove, and bring just to a boil; if heated in a crock, see that the indk does not scorch in the least. Then stu’ in the corn meal, and beat very thoroughly to remove lumps.

Bake slowly, stirring several times the first hour ; the pudding should cook from three to four hours in aU, and be moderately browned on top when done.

And when sweet apples are not to be had, those of a mild but rich sub-acid flavor, can be substituted. Tliis has been called, “The sweet-apple puddmg of the olden times.” And one who remembers, says of it : “ More than fifty years ago, when the woods covered the hiUs and valleys of Otsego County, N.

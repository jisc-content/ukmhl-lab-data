I “ cream-tartar, good measm*e. Before mixing, see that the oven is in order ; it must have a good steady heat, but very moderate. Place the above ingredients ah on the table, together with the cake-jian ; oil the latter well, having it cold or barely warm. Now sift tlie cream of taidar thi’ough the flour very thoroughly, and boat the egg and sugar together—or if more than one cake is wanted, double the above jiroportions, and carefully sepa- rate the yolks and whites. Beat the yolks with the sugar, reserving the whites to be whipped by themselves ; let the beating be done by an assistant, if there is one at hand. Add to the yolks and sugar a part of the cream, and stir in enough of the flour to thicken ; then more cream, then more flour ; if the latter is coarsely ground, a little less will bo needed ; the batter must not be very stiff. Wlicn this is mhced stir in the well-whipjied whites and the dissolved soda, and beat thorouglily ; then pour into the cake-pan (or pans), and place immediately in the oven. Bake rather slowly at first, allowing the cake to rise to its full height before the top is hardened ; and if possible do not move it till done. Finish with an even lirowTi, top and bottom, but not the slightest approach to scorching ; if tlie top browns a little too fast, cover with a paper ; if the bottom is in danger, lift oarefvlly, and slide a bread-pan, bottom upward, under it. Wlien nearly done, pass a liroom-straw through the thickest portion ; if it comes out clean add three minutes to the bakincr. and remove from the o—“^hiould the cake

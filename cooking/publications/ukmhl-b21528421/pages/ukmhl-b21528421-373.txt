Bre.ad and Fruit Dessert. Fill a pudding-dish with alternate layers of thinly sliced bread and stewed fruit, as raspberries or blackberries ; the fruit should be boiling hot. If the bread is shghtly toasted, it is an improvement; home-made Graham loaf is best. Before juitting in the fruit, drain off most of the juice into a separate bowl; then place the layers of bread in the dish, spreading each with the fruit, and when all is in pour the hot juice over. Cover with a plate, and set in a cool place till time to serve ; in cold weather, it is best to wai’m the dessert tlirough in the oven, before sending to tlie table. It may be eaten with or without a dressing of mock cream, stewed fruit, or cream and sugar. This is a convenient dish in hot weather, for dinner or lunch, as it requires little or no cooking in preparing it.

Make no more than two or three pints of jell}" at a time, as large quantities require longer boiling. As a general rule, allow e(pial measures of juice and sugar. Boil the juice rapitUy, ten minutes from the first moment it bubbles; skim, add the sugar, and boil ten minutes longer. Or, spread the sugai’ in a large dripping-jian set in the oven, and stii* often to prevent burning; boil the juice just twenty min- utes, add the hot sugar, boil up once, and iioui* into jelly- glasses. “To test the jelly, drop a little in a glass of very cold water, and if it immediately falls to the bottom it is done ; or drop into a saucer and set on ice, or in a cool place; if it does not spread, but remains rounded, it is finished. Some strain through the bag into the glasses, but this involves waste ; and if the skimming is carefully done, it is not nec- essary. If the jelly is not very firm, let it stand in the sun, covered with bits of window glass, or pieces of mosquito netting, for a few days. Never attempt to make jellies in damp or cloudy weather, if firmness and clearness are de- sired. Currants :ind berries should be made up as soon as picked ; never let them stand over night. When readv to put away, cover with jiieces of tissue or wilting paper cut to fit, and pressed closely upon the jelly ; then put on the lid, or cover ivith thick paper, brushed over on the inside with the white of an egg, and turned down on the outside of the glass.” Equally to the iioiut are the suggestions given below", from Marion Harland : Currant, Blackberry, Strawberry, etc. “ Put the fruit into a stone jar, set this in a kettle of tepid water, and put it upon the fire. Let it boil, closely covered, until the fruit is broken to pieces ; strain, pressing

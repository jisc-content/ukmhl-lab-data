PART II.] 123 LEAVENED AND OTHER BREAD. Self-'\Yorking Yeast. In makin," yeast it is often difficult to get a good article to start with ; in such cases a self-working yeast would be of advantage. The following recipe is from “Common Sense in the Household,” which is good authority: 8 potatoes. 2 ounces hops. 4 quarts cold water. 1 lb. floiu’. i lb. white sugar. 1 tablespoonful salt. “ Tie the hops in a coarse muslin bag, and bod one hour in four quarts of water. Let it cool to lukewarm before removing the bag. Wet the flour with the tejiid liquor—a little at a time—making a smooth paste. Put in the sugar and salt, and beat up the batter three minutes before add- ing the rest of the tea. Set it away for two days in an open bowl covered Avith a thin cloth, in a closet which is mod- erately and eA’enly Avarm. “ On the third day, peel, boil and mash the potatoes, and when entirel}" free from lumps and specks, stir in gradually the thickened hop-liquor. Let it stand tAvelve hours longer in the bowl, stirring often, and keeping it in the Avarm kitchen. Then bottle, or put aAvay in corked jars, Avhich must be perfectly SAveet, and freshly scalded. This will keep a month, in a cool cellai’. It is more troublesome to m:ike than other kinds of yeast, but it needs no other ‘ rising ’ to excite fermentation, and remains good longer than that made in the usual Avay.” Leavened Graham Bread.—( General Directions.)

HEALTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. m [part II. Dried Peach Soup. Look over, trim, and wash carefully a handful or two of good peaches ; then put them in a porcelain kettle, add enough boiling water to make them quite juicy, and stew moderately till tender. Remove from the fire as soon as done. If there is not sufficient juice at the last, or if what there is looks dark and tastes strong, add a little boiliug water. If the soup is not wanted immediatel}', set the fruit away till cold. When ready to make, take a cup one-third full of cooked peaches, and fill it A^'ith the juice; put this into a small fruit-kettle or tin basin, and set it on the stove. Then add nearly as much boiling water as there is juice; make a little thickening by mixing a teaspoonfid of flour with two tablespoonfuls of cold milk or water, and stir it in. After the soup begins to boil, cook five minutes ; then cool to about blood heat, and serve. FOODS FOR INFANTS. The best food for a babe is its mother’s milk, provided she is in good health. When the mother can not nurse her child, the best substitute is a health}’^ wet-nurse. If the lat- ter is not to be obtained, take the milk of one cow, in healthy condition and properly fed; avoid that of any ani- mal fed on slops or SAvills, as it is not only injurious to the child, but actually poisonous. For the new-born babe, get if possible the milk of a/ms7t cow; and at all times let the age of the calf correspond very nearly to that of the child. The milk should be given as it comes from the cow (the newer, the better), undiluted with water, and Avithout sweetening; if cold, it must be warmed to blood heat. When coAv’s milk can not be had, goat’s will answer, pro- vided the animal is well fed, and healthy. If the infant takes the bottle, always have two on hand, so that one can be cleansed and SAveetened, while the other is filled. The

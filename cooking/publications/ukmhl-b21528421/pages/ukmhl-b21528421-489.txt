The liaundi, nock and shoulder, are usually roasted the same as beef, except that most people think it necessary to disguise the naturid llavor of the meat by numerous season- ings or condiments, not to say wines. The thought suggests itself, whether it would not be better to dispense Avith this meat altogether, if it requires so many injurious or stimu- lating substances to make it palatable.

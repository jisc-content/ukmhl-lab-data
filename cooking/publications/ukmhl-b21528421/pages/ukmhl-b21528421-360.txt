Wring the pudding-bag out of hot water, flour it well inside, and pour in the batter; then tie securely, leaving plenty of room to swell, di’op into a pot of boiling water, and boil constantly an hour and a half. Add more water—always boiling hot—as it is needed; timi over now and then, and keep the pot closely covered be- tween times. When done, plunge the bag into a basin of cold water, and remove instantly; then turn the pudding out on a plate, and send directly to the table. Serve with cream, fruit, or fruit juice. This pudding may be steamed by pouring the batter into a basin well oiled, and j^lacing it, covered, inside a steamer, over a pot of boiling water ; steam two hours without un- covering. Do not fill too full, as the pudding must have room to swell. Corn Custard Pudding. 1 quart sweet milk. 1.1 cups fine corn meal. ^ cup sifted Graham flour. ^ “ sugar.

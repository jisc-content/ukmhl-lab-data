537 HASHES AND TOASTS. PAUT III.] Hash and Macaroni. Break the mac.aroiii into inch lengths, put it into a sauce- pan, and bai'ely cover with boihng water; stew twenty min- utes. In the mean time hash the meat, and peel and chop some tomatoes; there should be nearly as much tomato as meat, though less will do. Mdien the macaroni is done drain it, saving the water in which it boiled; then till an earthen dish with layers of tomato, meat and niacai’oni, add- ing them in the order named; moisten the meat with part of a cup of cold gravy, if you have it. Or if there aie bones, staid, them in a little cold water, and simmer, coveied, half an hour; then strain the liquor, and moisten with this. When all are in, pour over the whole the water saved from the macaroni (of which there may be half a cup), and if there is too much moistiu’e, sprinkle over a light layer of very fine bread-crumbs, di*y and stale, or some rolled crack- ers. Cover, and bake in a moderate oven, forty to fifty minutes. Hash with Onions. Cut the meat in short lengths; or you may shce it, not verv thin, and chop moderately. Put into a stew-pan part of a cup of cold gravy, or the meat juice saved fiom a roast; and if the hashed meat is rather lean, add to the contents of tlie pan a little fresh butter, or dripping. Heat till hot, and slice in several onions; let these cook till they change color, and then add nearly a cup of boihng water, or enough to make the hash pretty moist. Now put in the meat, and stir all well together; you may add also, if you have them, a few bits of cold potato. Cover, and heat ten minutes, or till the hash is very hot, stin’ing several times; then turn into the tureen. This is a convenient dish foi wash-days, as it needs little preparation. 23*

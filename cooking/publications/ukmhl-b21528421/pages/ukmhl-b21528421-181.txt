PA<5TEIES. 1G3 PART II.] Dried Peach Pie. Take clean dried peaches, trim off any burnt edges, wash cai’efully, and stew till soft; di’ain off and save the juice. Then mash till there ai'e no lumps, either with a potato-masher or with the hand, which is better ; add enough of the juice to make the pies sufficiently moist, mixing it well with the fruit. In the meantime, iirepare a good cream paste, and roU the crusts rather thin ; having lined the pie-pans, spread the fruit sparingly, lay on the top crusts, and press the edges liimly together ; after which, trim with a knife, and finish the rims neatly. Prick well, and bake in a quick oven twenty minutes, or till the crusts are done, but not a moment longer ; if overdone, the fruit will be bitter. “ Turnovers ” are made as follows : RoU the crust pretty thin, and just the size of the ifie-pan ; after placing it on the latter, spread the fniit not too thick, on one half of the ciTist, and turn the other half over it; then pinch the edges together. Finish very neatl}", prick deeply with a fork, and bake as before. Tuniovers, weU made, and with good dried peaches, are not to be despised ; they are convenient for traveling lunches, and are better relished than plain bread. Dried Apple Pie. Dried apple pies have come into very bad repute, owing to the “ depravity ” of theii' makers, rather than of the pies themselves ; these would bo better thought of, if made as tliey ought to be. In the first place, never put into a pie fiTiit that you would not eat out of it; in other words, take good apples, or none. Look them over very carefuUy, trimming off any burnt edges or defective spots ; then wash ([uickly but thorouglily in cold water, rubbing weU with the hands, and lifting the apples out of it to leave any sediment behind ; wash in two waters, if necessary. Then drop into boiling water (enough to cook them), and stew rather fast

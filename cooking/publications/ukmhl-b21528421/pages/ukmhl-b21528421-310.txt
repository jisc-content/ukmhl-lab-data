' ^ cup sugar. 3 eggs, yolks and whites separate. 1 cocoa-nut, pared and grated. 1 tablespoonful corn-starch. The fiber of the cocoa-nut is apt to give trouble to weak stomachs; for this reason, it is best to dispense with all but its juices. Stir the grated nut into the milk, pour the latter into a farina-kettle, and bring it slowly to a boil, stirring once or twice; then mix in the corn-starch wet in a little cold milk, and cook one minute; remove from the fire, and when cool enough strain through a coarse cloth or fine colander. Beat the yolks, then the sugar with them, and sthâ€™ them into the strained milk; add also the cocoa-nut milk if it is perfectly sweet, and the whites whipped to a good froth; stir well together, and bake in two pie-pans lined with a very stiff cream paste. Have a moderate oven, and bake only till the custard is set; then slip from the pans to plates, as soon as the pies come from the oven. Serve cold, the day they are baked.

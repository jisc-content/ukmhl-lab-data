PART IT.] REA\’ENED AND OTHER BREAD. m BrE-VD from “Risixgs.” The folio-wing recipe for bread from “risings,” comes well recommended : Scald one cup of fresh coim meal and thin it with cold water, making the mixture about blood heat. Stir into this one cup of white Hour, or enough to make a batter that will run from the spoon ; beat thoroughly. Then set it in an earthen crock, containing water that can be comfortably 1 )orne with the hand ; not hot enough to scald the sponge. Keep it in a warm place three hoiu’S, or xmtil ivater rises on top ; then stir in more white flour, enough to stiffen the batter to tlie first consistency. Let it remain in the crock of wann water until risen to a light sponge, though not too light. After it is fairly up, put into the mixing-bowl four or five pints of sifted Graham flour, pour in the risings, and w’ork into a very soft dough, without kneading. Handle only enough to mix all well together ; then make into rather small loaves, and set in a warm place to rise ; when light enough, bake in a good even oven, nearty or quite an hour. If prefeiTed, use part white flour for mixing. Another recipe, from a good bread-maker, is as follows : Scald two tablespoonfuls of com meal, let it cool a little, and then pour in a pint of water scarcely warmer than new milk. Thicken wdth white flour till tlie mixture is stiff enough to drop (not pour) from the spoon ; set this sponge in a crock of wami water, kept steadily at blood heat; stir now and then, tiU it begins to send up bulxbles ; and when it has risen, say txvo inches, mix the bread. To do this, scald a portion of the flour (Graham), and let it cool to lukewarm ; then mix with the sponge, forming a jiretty soft dough, and knead lightly and quickly till smootli ; tlie dough must not get chilled. Mould at once into loaves, set in a warm place to rise, and as soon as they are light enough, bake.

For several reasons, custards, like cakes, jellies, presences and pickles, can not be considered as any paid of a strictly bygienic dietary. In the first jilace they consist essentially of milk, eggs and sugar, mixed together, and either baked or boiled. The tendency of these articles, particularly when they are cooked together, is to congest the liver and lead to biliousness; and the more eggs and sugar the custard contains, the more unwholesome it is.

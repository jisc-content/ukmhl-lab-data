WILD BIRDS AND OTHER GAME:. 491 PART III.] Roasted. Stuff tlie birds with a dressing of bread-crumbs, the same as chicken; lay them closely together in an h’on pan, add a cup of hot w'ater and a lumji of fresh butter, or a spoonfid of fresh dripping if you have it. Baste frequently, and cover toward the last if there is need; have rather a slow oven, and cook the smaller birds 1014}' to sixty minutes, or until tender. The larger ones, as prairie-fowls, mU take from one to two hours, according to age. 'When done lift them out, add a little thickening made of browned flour and w^ater—cream is better—and let the gravy come to a boil. Serve wuth mashed potato, stewed turnips, or other plain vegetables; and have for dessert, fresh oranges, or cranberry or other tart sauce. Stcived. Clean, and stuff or not, as it is convenient; if stuffed, sew up tight to keep in the dressing. Put the birds into a pot, add a cupful of boiling water, and stew slowly; tuim once or twice, as they cook. Or if preferred, you may cut them into joints or quaiders, put in water as before, and stew very slowly till tender ; keep the jiot closely covered. There should be just enough liq’iorleft for gravy; when done take out the birds, thicken with a httle browned flour wet with milk or water, heat the gravy to a boil, and poirr it over. Broiled. After cleaning, split the pigeons down the back, rinsing well, and drying with a clean cloth. Then flatten each with a steak-pounder, and broil on a gridiron over a bed of clean coals; it will take fifteen or twenty minutes to cook them. A good way, since it saves the trouble of broiling over a hot fire, is to flatten as before, lay them smoothly on the bottom of a dripping-pan, and then place in a hot oven. Tliey will be done in about the same time, and require no attention pxcept to see that they do not burn.

VEGETABLES. PAKT II.] 185 stalks into a porcelain kettle, staii; in boiling water, and stew till tender. If fresh from the garden, twenty-five to thiidy minutes ought to suffice ; but much of it that we buy requires from forty to fifty mhiutes. Boil in enough water to about cover ; if yoimg, it is good enough without season- ing. Some hygienists think this vegetable is not very whole- some ; they claun that it, like onions, is so lai'gely thrown off through the excretory organs as to tax them abnormally. Most of the asparagus sold in our city markets, is too old before it is cut; instead of gathering it every day or two, the custom seems to be to cut the stalks only once or twice a week, and a good distance below the surface of the ground ; this gives five or six inches of hard, woody fiber, and one inch of inferior tops. Those who understand raising asparagus, say it should be cut mth a knife as often at least as every other morning, and hardy below the surface of the ground ; and some recommend snapping or breaking it off. This would remove the tender part only ; but if left too long, all the stalk toughens, except the very tip end. MTien quite young, green and tender, it is sometimes boiled as greens, and seiwed with lemon juice. Asparagus Toast. =|- Cook the aspaiâ€™agus as in the last recipe ; before it is quite done, slice some good Graham bread, rather stale, and toast it evenly. MTien ready, dip the slices quickly into boihng water, and arrange them on a platter ; then lift out the asparagus and lay it on the toast. Thicken the water in which it boiled with a little cream and flour, heat almost to boiling, and pour it over. Or, if preferred, you may omit the thickening, lay the as^iaragus on the toast, and moisten with the liquor left in the pot.

189 PART U.] VEGETABLES. Boiled Dried Beans. =|= Look the beans over carefully, throwing out the faulty ones, and wash in two waters, rubbing them well between the fingers ; then stiud in boiling water, and cook till soft. Allow from two to tlu-ee hours, or longer, according to age and variety ; they should not be cooked to pieces. If more water is needed, add it boiling hot; only a little shoidd re- main when they are done. Never soak beans ; it makes the skins slip off Avhole, and they ai’e very indigestible. White beans, unless they are quite old, should not be pcU’boiled ; the speckled cranberry and other colored beans, which ai’e rather strong in flavor, are best parboiled fifteen or twenty minutes—not longer. Then pour the water off, and add more, boiling hot; cook till perfectly tender, but not tiU they are broken ; allow water enough to make them a Httle moist, when done. No seasoning is needed. Baked BnANS.=f= Prepare as in the preceding recipe, then boil till very soft and half broken to pieces; for most dried beans, it wiU requii’e all of three hours. Let them be quite juicy when taken from the fire ; then timi into a deep dish, cover, and bake rather slowly two to three hours, or until they are of a rich brown color. Do not scorch them in finishing. Baked Beans. Prepare as before, and boil till quite tender, but not till the beans are broken ; the water should be nearly all evap- orated. Then mash fine with a potato masher, put into a shallow pan, and smooth off the top with a knife. Set them into a hot oven and bake half an hour, or until nicely browned. Cold beans are good, mashed and baked in the same way.

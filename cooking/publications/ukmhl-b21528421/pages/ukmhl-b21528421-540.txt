HF.AT.TH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. [PAKT III. 522 Then lift from the fire, poiu' all into an earthen or granit' ized iron basin, and set in a cool place. Next morning, or whenever you want it, add to the meat, if you like, a little chojiped jiarsley, or other sweet herb, put the whole into a pot or stew-pan, and simmer covered, half an hour; no water should be added. Then stii' in a spoonful of browned floui’ wet with tepid water, let it boil uj) once, and dish into the tureen. Serve with baked or mashed potato, and warm corn bread. If you have cold biscuits, split them open, and half toast in the oven—or you may brown some slices of stale loaf bread—put these into a dish, and poim the stew over; if the latter is too thick stii’ in half a cup of cream, and heat just to boiling before you set it oflf. Mutton Stew. Take tlmee or four pounds of mutton or lamb, trim off most of the fat, and cut into inch or two-inch bits; a rib piece is good, the bones being choiiped in short lengths; or the neck or breast will do. Start the meat in boiling water, enough to nearly cover, remove the scum as it rises, and stew very slowly, keeping the lid on. Add a sliced onion, and cook an hour and a half, or till about tender; if you like jiarsley, thyme, or other sweet herb, put it in finely chopped ; and if any filling up has to be done, add a little boiling water. Then drop in some small bits of light cream paste, cover closely, and cook fifteen minutes; take out the meat and dumplings, put them into a hot tureen, fit on its lid, and set in a warm place. Thicken the gravy in the pot with a spoonful or two of browned flour, wet with half a cup of cold milk or cream; boil up a moment, pour it over the dumplings and meat, and send the dish to the table. Another way is to leave out the dumplings and flour, add a pint of green corn cut from the cob, and cook twenty minutes.

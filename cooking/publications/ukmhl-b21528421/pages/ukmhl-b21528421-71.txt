MILK. P.^T l] 53 Milk. Many persons who discard meat, do not hesitate to pai*' take freely of milk, eggs, sugar, butter, etc., and to use pastries, cakes and puddings, that are little else than a com- bination of these, with the addition, it may be, of spices and other seasonings. Now, a plain diet of Graham bread with beef or mutton, roasted or boiled, and a fair allowance of fruits and vegetables, would be much more wholesome than the above articles, or the dishes that are manufactured out of them. As to milk, it is the natm'al diet for the young. But foi- gi'own persons, and especially for those who live in cities, or who incline to sedentary habits, it is not the best, or one of the best aidicles of diet. Before arguing the question, however, let us make a note of the fact that milk is one of those secretions that is readily affected, not only by the food the animal eats, but by the conditions, physical or mental, of the creature itself. If the health of the cow deviates from the normal standard, the character of the milk is im- mediately changed; if she is mentally disturbed, as by anger or fright, the mammaiy glands will secrete, not a whole- some, but a poisonous fluid. A mother not unfrequently kills her child, or throws it into spasms, by nursing it after she has been badly frightened, or after a violent fit of anger; and many a child has been “ salivated, purged and narcotized, by mercury, drastic purgatives and opiates, respectively administered to the mother.” * But the question is asked, “ Suppose the animal is kept in the best possible condition, every way; would milk be objected to as an article of diet? ” Most assuredly not—for young calves. Nature has provided the very food that is needed, for all her babes. The milk of the cow, like that of other mammals, including the human, is intended for the * Pavy’s “Food and Dietetics.”

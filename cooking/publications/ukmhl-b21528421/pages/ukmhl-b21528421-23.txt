Some dietetic reformers, in their eagerness to gratify a pervei-ted palate, have fallen into the habit of mixing various foods together, indiscriminate!}", in the preparation of a single dish. Such admixture, if confined to one class of products, for instance the grains, would not be amiss ; but the plan of putting together in the same dish, fruits and vegetables (say cabbage, beans, beets, squashes, etc., with raw or cooked finits), is a practice that can not be too strongly condemned. Sound stomachs might be able to manage these conglomerations, but weak or diseased ones would certainly be the worse for it; and it is a question whether even the best digestion, under such treatment, woiild not finally be impaired. This brings us to the subject of the dietetic classification of foods. It also suggests a reason for some sHght depart- ure in this book from the ordinary grouping of food products. For example, under the head of “ Vegetables,” only such products are named as seem to be dietetically allied to each other ; no attention being paid to scientific technicalities. In like manner, tomatoes and melons are classed with vegetables, because they are intended to be eaten "SNuth them. And it might be added, that meats, if eaten, are thought to digest better taken with vegetables, rather than with fruits. There is no doubt that very oily sub- stances eaten mth fniits, make rather a bad mixtui’e ; and it ought to be thorouglily well known that the large amount of sugar ordinarily cooked in the latter, renders them diffi- cult to digest, and often causes pain in the stomach, or cholera morbus, particidarly if they are eaten with vegetables. The trouble is not with the fruits, but with the sugar, and the bad combinations that are made. The subject of food combinations—whether cabbage and raw ajjples will digest weU together, or strawberries and

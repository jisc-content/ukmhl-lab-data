PART III.] HASHES AND TOASTS. 535 proportions. The follo^ving, however, is one of the best coiubiuatious that you can make ; though some like less crumbs, and some none at aU: Have one part hashed meat, one part stale bread-crumbs, and one of raw chopped potato. Put into a pot the liquor, strained from the bones; or (if you have it), the gravy left from a roast, first removing the gi-ease from the top, and the sediment from the bottom; a thii-d of a cup of it ought to be sufficient for a quaii; of the meat. Dilute the gravy in the pot with enough boiling water to make the meat pretty moist; but before putting in the latter, slice in an onion if you like its flavor, lay on the lid, and cook ten min- utes; then add the meat, cover closely, and heat again, stir- ring once or twice.

"Wlien the potatoes are done enough (they should be about half cooked), turn them in Avith the meat, and stir well together; let these get steaming hot before you add the bread. Then cover again and heat thoroughly, stiiTing several times; cook from ten to fifteen minutes, or till the several ingredients are well blended together ; then dish into a tureen, cover, and send to the table. The hash should be rather dry when done; seiwe with baked or mashed potato. Hash aatth Cold Potatoes.

If the cold ones have been boiled in their “jackets” remove the skins, trim off any imperfect spots or ends, and throw out the wet ones; if you do not do this you AviU spoil the hash. You can make it of meat and potato, leaAung out the bread; but if you have a bit of stale loaf, put it in. When

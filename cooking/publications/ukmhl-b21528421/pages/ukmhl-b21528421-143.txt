Now sprinkle lightly with floiu*, cover with several folds of old table-linen, and set in a warm place to rise ; it may take severiil hours, or over night. When risen, the dough will have stiffened somewhat; then knead ten to fifteen minutes (according to quantity), working in very little flom-. 9. But for bread that is rather dry and flaky, mix the dough (with a sponge that will just pour) considerably stiffer ; stiff enough to leave the sides of the tray ; then lift to the bread-boai’d, and knead vigorously about fifteen minutes. When Avorked nnough, the dough becomes elastic ; if you give it a poke with the finger, or with your closed fist, it avlU rise or spring up when the pressure is removed. Then return it to the tray—over the bottom of Avhich you have sprinkled a little flour—cover, and set to rise. 10. Always mix in a warm room, so as not to chfll the bread ; in very cold weather, you may protect it from draughts of air by covering with several folds of thick flannel, kept for the purjiose. 11. When the weather is cool or cold, make the sponge in the afternoon or evening, and mix the bread before bed- time. Next morning knead, and form into loaves, then set to rise, and bake. 12. In very warm weather, make the sponge in the morn- ing ; this enables you to mix, set to rise, mould, and finally bake, all in the daj'time ; whereas, the dough would almost certainly sour, if it had to stand over night. 13. Do not let the bread get too light, in either the first or second rising ; when it has doubled in volume, it is just about ready for moulding or baking. 14. Allow sufficient time for the fermentation ; do not hasten or force it, by keeping either the sponge or bread too warm ; neither must you let it chill before fermentation begins. 15. Mould into small loaves, having a pan for each ; this

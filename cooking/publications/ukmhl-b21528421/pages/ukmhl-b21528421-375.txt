PART III.] 357 PLAIN DESSERTtJ. Rice and Apple Pudding. Take cold boiled rice, weU moulded, and cut it in slices bidf an inch thick; put into a pudding-dish a layer of the rice, and one of equal thickness of grated or stewed apples. Rejjeat these until the dish is fidl, ending with a thin layer of the apples; then set the dish into another containing boiling water, and bake covered, in a moderate oven, one hour. Serve warm with cream and sugar, stewed fruit, or fruit sauce. The layers may be made with rice and raspber- ries, seeded cherries, or other small fruits, which if taid, may be hghtly sprinkled with sugar. Frumenty. This haiwest dish, sometimes called “ furmity,” is made by taking the whole wheat newly cut, and rubbed or threshed out, and boiling it in water till soft. The recipe, which is an “ old country ” one, taken from a British jour- nal on Dietetics, is as follows : “ To cook it (the wheat) put it on in cold water, let it come to a boil, and then stew gently till every grain bm-sts open like a little mealy po- tato.” It will require several hours’ steaming or boihng; and the wheat should be as new and tender as possible. The best plan is to start it in plenty of cold water—say one paid wheat and four or five parts water—and cook in a farina- kettle; this saves the trouble of stimng, and prevents stick- ing. "WTien done, you can stir in a little cream or milk, if you like, and simmer five minutes; some add sugar and a beaten egg, along with the milk,—^though that is a depart- ure from the original method. This dish is said by those who have eaten it, to be delicious. Farina Musii.^j: To a quart of boiling water allow half a cup of farina ; add it verj" slowly, and stir well to prevent lumping. Cook

Fresh eggs, particularly while ones, have a thin rough shell which an experienced eye will know at sight. As they get stale the shell thickens, and becomes smooth and shin- ing. To tell whether an egg is spoiled, hold it up between your eye and a lighted candle; if not good, it will look clouded; the outline of the yolk will not be distinct, and the white not cleai’—or the whole mass will be opaque. Boiled Eggs. It is difficult to time eggs, if more than two or three are boiled at once; when there are a dozen or more, they cool the water, so that you will have to count from the moment it begins again to bubble. Very much too depends upon the size of the eggs, and also the thickness of the shells; the clear white ones (fresh), are thinner than the buff- colored. Have a good kettle of boiling water over a hot fire, and drop the eggs in with a spoon to prevent breaking them. If they cool the water till it stops boiling, count from the time it be- gins again; and if wanted soft, cook two minutes and a half— or two minutes, if the eggs are small. But if they boil from the time they reach the water, allow two minutes and a half for the small, and three for the larger ones; this should coagulate the whites, and leave the yolks soft. If liked neither hard nor soft, but the yolks a little firm, allow three minutes to three and a half, according to the size of the eggs. If you Avish them hard, cook ten to fifteen minutes, or even longer; some say half an hour; the longer the time, the drier and more mealy the yolks.

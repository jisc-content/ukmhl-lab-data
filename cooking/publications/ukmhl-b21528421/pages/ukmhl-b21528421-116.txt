HE.VLTH IN THE HOUSEHOLD. [P.VRT I. 98 baking-iDOwcler is employed, the spoon must be heaped some- what, owing to the fact that nearly all baking-powders are one-third starch. The proper proportion of pure soda and cream of tartar, is said to be about six ounces of the former to sixteen of the latter. When eggs are used, as in making custards or puddings, beat the yolks and whites sei^arately ; if you sweeten first, whip the yolks a little (to avoid lumping), then beat with the sugar, and stir the whites in last. Eggs to l^eat well, should be fresh, and moderately cold ; and experienced cooks say they should never be beaten in a tin vessel, but in stone or earthen ware. The rule for custards, is to cook uery slowl}-; and if baked, to take from the oven as soon as they ai'e well thickened— before they begin to separate, or become watery. Soups must boil or simmer doidy till done ; and most kinds need three or four hours’ cooking. When necessary, remove fragments of meat, bones or vegetables, by straining through a colander at the last; return to the pot and heat again, before seiwing. Meat, if roasted, should be placed in a hot oven till the surface is seai’ed, and then hake sloivly till done. If stewed, pour boiling water over it till half covered, skim if neces- sary, boil rapidly five or ten minutes, and then sleio gently, till a fork will go through the thickest portion of it easily. 1’lie water should all be evaporated when done ; and if finished as a pot roast, heat the oil or gravy in the bottom till the under surface of the meat is nicely browned ; then turn it over, and brown the other. If cold meat is to be warmed over (as in a hash), do not heat too long ; you can cook a good hash in fifteen or twenty minutes, after the meat, bread and potatoes are j^re- pared. Cold potatoes are best warmed over as follows : oil the skillet slightly, just enough to keep them from sticking;

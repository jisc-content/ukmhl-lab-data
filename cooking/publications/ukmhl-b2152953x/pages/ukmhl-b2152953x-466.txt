XXXIV. THE GUESTS. The Jews and tha Egyptians washed the feet of the persons whom they received into their houses, and offered them larger portions as a mark of greater honour.1 These homely and hospitable usages have disap- peared with the simplicity of the primitive ages. The Greeks required their guests to arrive neither too soon nor too late. It was a rule of politeness from which nothing could exempt them,2 and which we ourselves observe at this day. In the Homeric ages each one received his share of meat and wine,* and the man who at that epoch piqued himself on his knowledge of the science of life, never failed to offer his neighbour a part of his dinner. So Ulysses gives Demodochus one-half of the “chine of beef" with which he is served.4 It is true that the King of Ithaca was regarded as a perfect model of complaisance and delicacy. Another custom (adopted it is said only in the modern taverns and dining-rooms) was that of warming the remains of a preceding banquet for other guests.5 It must have constituted very poor fare, for the Greeks were remarkable for a formidable appetite, and their repasts were prolonged indefinitely. The banquet of Menelaus, noticed by Athenteus, is a proof of it. They eat at first without speaking, and after prodigies of mastication they began to discourse. Then, having washed their hands, face, and beard, a fresh attack was commenced, more formidable than the first; and when tho ardour and energy of the assailants seemed to be exhausted, they hardly took time to breathe etc they fell on the viands with renewed avidity. Nothing resisted them; the dishes were cleared ; only a few bones remained to certify their achievement.® A saddening, unsatisfactory trophy for future guests.

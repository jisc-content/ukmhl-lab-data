PLANTS USED IN SEASONING. uo PENNYROYAL. The ancients entwined their wine cups with pennyroyal,33 and made crowns of it, which were placed on their heads during their repasts, by the aid of which they hoped to escape the troublesome consequences of too copious libations.34 On leaving the table, a small quantity of this plant was taken, to facilitate digestion.35 Pennyroyal occupied, also, an important place in high gastronomio combinations. RUE. The territory of Myra, a city of Lycia, produced excellent rue.36 Mithridates looked upon this vegetable as a powerful counter-poison ;37 and the inhabitants of Heraclea, suspicious—and with reason—of the villany of their tyrant, Clearcbus, never stirred from their dwellings with- out having previously eaten plentifully of rue.38 This plant cured also the ear-ache ;33 and to all these advantages, it joined that of being wel- comed with honour on all festive occasions 40 MINT. There was formerly—no matter where or when—a beautiful young girl, who was changed into this plant through the jealous vengeance of Proserpine.41 Thus transformed, she excited the appetite of the guests, and awakened their slumbering gaiety.42 Mint prevented milk from curdling, even when rennet was put into it.43 SPANISH CAMOMILE. The Homans sometimes mixed with their drink the burning root of the Spanish camomile ;44 and we are astonished at meeting with the name of this formidable plant among the ingredients of some of their dishes.

VI. GRAINS: SEEDS. One of the most important was Mustard seed. Pythagoras maintains (and no one has contradicted his assertion) that this seed occupied the first rank amongst alimentary substances which exercise a prompt influence on the brain.1 Indeed the ancients attributed to it the same qualities that we do at the present day. Mustard, according to their opinion, excites the appetite, gives piquancy to meat, strengthens the stomach, and facilitates digestion. It is better suited, say they, to bilious constitutions than to lymphatic persons; and they recommended its use in summer, rather than in winter.2 The good Pliny, always disposed to adopt, without much exami- nation, any stories, provided they were but slightly exaggerated, was convinced, and affirms, with his accustomed good humour, that this plant is a sovereign remedy against the bite of the most venomous serpents: it is only necessary to apply it to the wound. And again if taken inwardly, there is nothing to fear from the poisonous effects of certain mushrooms.2 The doctors of the 19th century arc, apparen y, little inclined to adopt the method recommended by the woithy naturalist. f Mustard seed is only mentioned ih the Bib e as a erm parison ; its alimentary qualities are nowhere indicated. The Romans, and other nations after them, fermented tins " new sweet wine. It is from this, perhaps, we must seek for the origin o the word mustard, ardent (burning win.) i tronomic writers give it another derivation, not generally adopted.

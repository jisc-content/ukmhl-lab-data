50 VEGETABLES. invited these worthy personages to dinner, and, with the assistance of his friend, gave them a magnificent banquet, in which vegetables occupied a most conspicuous place.8 Sixteen Greek authors have devoted their vigils to profound re- searches concerning the qualities of these useful plants; their works have not been transmitted to us, but their names are to be found inscribed in the gastronomic treasure which Atlienseus—that grammarian, philosopher, and epicurean—has bequeathed to the meditations of posterity.9 But it is principally with the Romans that this interesting branch of the magiric art flourished. They have told us that this great family of herbs took the name of vegetables (legumina), because they were chosen and picked by the hand;10 and their most celebrated horticul- turists have prided themselves on the preparation of the ground to which they were confided, on the attention which they claimed, and on the Hygeian virtues which experience attributed to them.

Perhaps a rapid sketch of what the great poet says on this subject, may not be misplaced here. “ Si mon vaisseau long-temps egar6 loin du bord, Ne se hatait enfin de regagner le port, Peut-etre je peindrais les Ciens cheris de Flore ; Le Narcisse en mes vers s’empresserait d eclore, Les roses m’ouvriraient leurs calices brillants, Le tortueux concombre arrondirait ses flancs ; Du persil toujours vert, des pfiles chicories Ma muse abreuverait les tiges alterees, Je courberais le lierre et l’acantbe en berceau, Et du mvrthe ainoureux j’ombragerais les eaux.”12 One more fact will serve to show to what extent the Romans carried their enthusiastic affection for leguminous plants: we know that illus- trious families did not disdain to borrow their names from them. The appellations, Fabius, Cicero, and Lentulus, thus enhanced the humble

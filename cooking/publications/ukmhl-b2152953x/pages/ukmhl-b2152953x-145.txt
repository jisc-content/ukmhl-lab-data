STONE FRUIT. 105 PLUM TREE. Plum trees were known in Africa from time immemorial; and Theophrastus speaks of the great number of these trees which were to be found at Thebes, Memphis, and especially at Damascus.71 Athe- nteus, also, praises the excellent plums of this last-named city ;72 and we know that time has not lessened their ancient reputation. Asia and Egypt sent a great quantity to Europe; and, in order that they might keep better during this long voyage, a part of them were dried, and the rest were preserved—that is to say, the best—in honey and sweet wine.73 These were the only kind known in Rome in the time of Cato (150 years b.c.), but the Romans, then novices in the art of good living, would have but ill-appreciated the delicate and perfumed pulp of Damascus plums, at the moment when, hardly plucked from the tree, their fresh and velvet-like bloom delights the eye and tempts the palate of epicures. Two centuries later the science of good living made incredible progress. A magiric atmosphere enveloped the capital of the universe with its delicious fragrance, and the joyous free livers of Italy cultivated in their gardens plums of the most beautiful purple and gold,74 far superior to the much-extolled fruit from Damascus and Mem- phis. The fields everywhere offered such luxuriance of plum trees that Pliny, the opposition man, or juste milieu of that time, complained of their number,75 and grieved at what he fancied a useless and expensive profusion of them. The ancient Counts of Anjou transplanted the plums of Damascus into their province; and the good King Rene of Sicily, Duke of Anjou and Count of Provence, introduced them into southern Europe.70 The plums of Monsieur are thus named because Monsieur, the bro- ther of Louis XIV., was very fond of them.77 The plums of Reine Claude owe their name to the first consort of Francis I., daughter of Louis XII.78 The plums of Miralelle were brought from Provence into Lorraine by King Rene.79 H

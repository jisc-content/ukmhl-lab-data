XXVI. BEVERAGES, OF WHICH WATER IS THE FOUNDATION. I Water is certainly the most ancient beverage, the most simple, natural, and the most common, which nature has given to mankind. But it is necessary to be really thirsty in order to drink water, and as soon as this craving is satisfied it becomes insipid and nauseous. What is then to he done ? Cyrus would have said : “ Drink no more so would a teetotaler of the present day. In the first ages of the world, the human race, hound by no oath of temperance, succeeded, by sheer application of their ingenuity, in finding something better, or perhaps worse, ac- cording to the ideas of certain moralists, whose wise teaching, however, commands respect. Certain it is that water, continuing to be regarded 4 with peculiar favour, was called to play a principal part in various com- binations by which it lost its insipidity and inoffensive properties, and acquired the wonderful power of provoking a sort of madness, known by the name of drunkenness. Those beverages which mail imbibes when he is no longer thirsty, which cloud his weak mind, and render him ill when in good health, are called fermented liquors. Beer is one of the most ancient. If wTe are to believe Diodorus of Sicily, Bacchus himself invented it.1 However,' it is certain that the absolute injunction not to drink wine, caused the inhabitants of Egypt to have recourse to a factitious beverage obtained from barley,2 often mentioned in history under the name of zythum and cur mi? and whose invention has been often attributed to Osiris—which means, that its precise origin is entirely unknown.

48 GRAINS: SEEDS. readers of logogriphs, were in raptures at finding the following : “ The Latin name of Lupinus has been given to this grain because the lupin wears out and destroys the land nearly as the wolf destroys and devours the flocks ; whereupon they exclaimed, with pride, ‘ Lupin us a lupo!' ”u At the period when the gods did not exact much, but were con- tented with humble offerings, mem placed on the altars loaves made of Linseed meal; a treat the immortals gratefully accepted, though certainly it would not much tempt us15 of the present day. The Asiatics afterwards thought of pounding the linseed, frying it, and mixing it with honey; these cakes seemed to them too good for their divinities, so they ate them themselves.10 In the time of Pliny, the Lombards and Piedmontese ate this miserable bread of the gods, and even found in it a most agreeable flavour :17 these nations have since improved their taste. Shall we mention Hempseed, the Cannahis of the ancients, which was served fried for dessert ? 18 That hemp should be spun and made into ropes, well and good ; but to regale one’s-self with it after dinner, when the stomach is overloaded with food, and hardly moved from its lethargic quietude by the appearance of the most provoking viands that art can invent—what depravity ! What strange perversion of the most simple elements of gastronomy! The Arabs, that wandering nation, who are not yet acquainted with the roasting-spit, nor the voluptuousness of a delicious repast, foimeily intoxicated themselves with a beverage extracted from linseed;19 we, who are in possession of generous wine, let us deplore such excesses, and not imitate them.

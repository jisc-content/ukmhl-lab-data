272 SEASONINGS. modify the garum before he sent it to table, by the help of various in- gredients, such as pepper, vinegar, Falernian wine,30 water, and oil,37 according to the use to which it was destined, or the degree of strength it was expedient it should possess. Hence that variety of seasonings with garum,—sweet,38 sharp, mixed with water, wine, vinegar, and many other substances which changed or corrected the acid flavour pf the primitive condiment,39 though without in the least depriving it of the qualities which fermentation had communicated to it. It results from the different citations of which this chapter is com- posed, that recipes for the making of garum are to be obtained more easily than people seem to think at the present time. Everyone may not he of the same opinion with regard to the kind of fish generally used by the ancients to obtain this liquid, although all difficulties would he removed by admitting—which certainly is nothing but right—that they chose at one time mackerel or tunny fish; at others, gudgeons and small sardines; sometimes even the red mullet, in spite of its rarity and price. But it is evident that garum was prepared by either dissolving and liquefying these fish in their brine, either whole, their intestines, or their liver, and that, to effect this, it was only necessary to expose to the sun the vessel containing them ; or that they simply put small fish into a dish, with vinegar and parsley, placed it on a charcoal fire, and stirred it for some time, when it was wanted for immediate use. It must have been remarked in reading this work, that Apicius very frequently employs garum; he places it in - every sauce, but never makes use of this seasoning unmixed, never does he serve it by itself as a special dish. This celebrated gastronomist has bequeathed us the recipe for a digestive garum. It is as follows:— Mix with some honey, half an ounce of pepper, three scruples of eschalots, six scruples of cardamum, one scruple of spikenard, and six scruples of mint; add vinegar to this mixture, and then pour in some garum.40 The Hypotrimma, or stomachic condiment, of the same master, merits also our attention:—Mix carefully some pepper, benzoin, mint, pine-nuts, dried raisins, and dates, with fresh (not salt) cheese, vinegar, oil, honey, and wine, reduced by boiling to one half; add garum to this mixture.41 The Moretaria appears to he a variety of the Hypotrimma; it is a mixture of mint, rue, coriander, fennel, the whole fresh, with benzoin, pepper, honey, and vinegar; to this, garum is added.42

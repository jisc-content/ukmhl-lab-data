The inhabitants of Burgundy pretended that the wine of Champagne owed its vogue entirely to the influence of Colbert and Louvois, the then ministers, one of whom was a native of Champagne, and the other in possession of immense vineyards.

Long before the time of these two statesmen, said they, the French got tipsy on Champagne wine ; ergo, they valued that exhibiting liquor. This argument was irrefragable.

There was, however, a means of avoiding these baccha- nalian encounters. It was, to choose a champion who, as in judicial combats, accepted the challenges for his candidate, to whom the victory or defeat was attributed, as if he himself had drank.109 In the middle ages, and in the l Gth century, intoxication was severely punished in France.

MILK, BUTTER, CHEESE, AND EGGS. 170 A patient, cured by the use of this wholesome and restorative food, thought of expressing his gratitude by the following stanza: “ Par sa bonte, par sa substance D’une &nesse le lait m’a rendu la sant6 ; Et je dois plus en cette circonstance, Aux anes qu’a la faculte.” Macedoine Germanique of Milk.—Pound dry almonds, and put them into a stewpan with the following ingredients :—the most delicate parts of mallows only, and white-beet, some leeks, parsley, and other leguminous herbs, previously cooked, a fowl boiled and minced small, the brains of poultry or sucking pigs, also boiled, and lastly, some hard eggs cut in two. Put all these together, as mentioned before ; some little time after that, add sausage meat, fowls’ livers, fresh cod fish, and oysters—the whole reduced into pulp—some fresh cheese, pine nuts, and Avhole pepper. Whilst this is boiling on a very slow fire, prepare the following seasoning: pound some pepper, alisander, parsley seeds, and silphium; stew separately with gravy; mix raw eggs with a great quantity of milk ; add it to the preceding seasoning ; pour it over the contents of the stewpan, then pepper, and serve.20 BUTTER. A learned writer51 has maintained that the ancient inhabitants of the east did not know of butter, and that by this word must be under- stood, when it occurs in the holy writings, sour milk or cream. What- ever may be the respect due to the grave authority of Beckmann, we beg leave to adhere to the opinion of various translators of the Bible, and believe with them that the Jews knew how to prepare butter. Indepen- dently of the signification of chemacJc, to which a profound philosopher gives the same sense,22 and which appears very naturally to offer this acceptation, we could still fortify our opinion by the passage where Job. recalling with sorrow the happy days of his youth, says, that he used to wash his “ feet in butter.”23 We agree that these words are under- stood in a figurative sense, and that the man of God wished to show by it that he was the- possessor of a great number of flocks.

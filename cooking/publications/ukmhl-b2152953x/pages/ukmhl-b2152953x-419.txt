REPASTS. 345 Greeks of yore, they contented themselves at first with simple aliments, and few in number; subsequently, three courses, sometimes seven,70 or even many more, ajipeared to them to be hardly sufficient to satisfy the ardent voracity of their eyes, and glut stomachs which odious precautions assimilated to the buckets of Danaus’s daughters. These suppers, the details of which always appear to us as bearing the impress of exaggeration, notwithstanding the authority of the writers who furnish them, were insufficient for certain prodigies of extravagance and furious gluttony, who were served at midnight with a sort of “ wake” (icomissatio),n at which some of them gave proof of renewed greed and vigour. Yitellius was renowned for this kind of nocturnal debauchery ;7J others shone in the second rank, but no one equalled that monarch- cook, who made the empire a market, and his shameful reign an un- ceasing banquet. Sensual enjoyments, and every variety of barbarity that follows in their train, were carried to the highest pitch. There was something vast and monstrous, of which nothing can give us an idea, in the eclipse of mind, and the depravity of their hearts. All that force of intelligence and will which, under the influence of Christian spiritualism, has re- vealed itself in modern times by so many chivalric inspirations, so many moral institutions, so many scientific discoveries, so many industrial works, then ingulfed in the senses, was taxed solely for their gratifi- cation. Ihe sensual organization of man had acquired a development apparently as vast as that of intelligence, because intelligence had be- come the handmaid of the senses: hence those colossal proportions in the tastes, the banquets, the pleasures of the ancients, when compared with ours, which make us regard them as an extinct race of giants, if we consider them in a sensual point of view; and as a race of pygmies, if we measure them by that power of ideas—that metaphysical and moial elevation to which we have attained, and which would make a I child of our days the catechist of all the philosophers of antiquity.73 Down to the time of the conquest of the north of Europe by the Romans, the food was very simple. Chopped herbs boiled in cauldrons, served in wooden bowls on the hide of an ox, spread on the ground, in the midst of the forest; balls composed of different kinds or flour, and some strips of meat grilled on the embers—such was the food of our forefathers.74

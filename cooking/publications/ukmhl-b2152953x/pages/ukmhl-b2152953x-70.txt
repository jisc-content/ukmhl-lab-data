32 MANIPULATION OF FLOUR. signifying all, that we must seek the etymology of this nutritious substance, which accompanies all other aliments, takes their place if needful, and agrees equally with all mankind.20 This, one would think, is conclusive; but the learned, the philologist, and every Procrustes of literature, protests against a halt with so fair a field before him. It is from the word pascere,21 proudly exclaims another interpreter, that the substantive, bread, is derived.22 This word has been rather disfigured on its way: think of the length of time it has been travelling down to us. Ceres taught the Greeks how to cultivate corn ; they learned from Megalarte and Megalomaze how to knead flour and bake it in ovens.23 The gratitude of the Boeotians erected statues and altars to their memories, and shortly after, Greece could boast of having obtained the most skilful bakers in the world. The bread of Athens and Megara had a well deserved reputation: its whiteness dazzled the eye, and its taste was exquisite.24 This voluptuous and fickle nation very soon began to tire of so intelligent and simple a manipulation, and must needs mix with the paste a host of ingredients which greatly altered its flavour : and seventy-two different sorts of bread25 took birth from the scientific association of milk, oil, honey, cheese, and wine Avith the best flour.20 All these varieties were called by the generic name of artos, bread; to which was added an epithet which prevented the mistaking of one kind for another. The bread-market at Athens was very amusing; women (for the fair sex busied themselves with this trade) waited, seated, by the side of their baskets until Mercury should send them customers, and woe to those who came late, or whose evil genius led them to find fault with either the quality, quantity, or price of the goods. Have you ever heard the ladies of Billingsgate playing off their pleasant jokes on a timid countryman, or a foreigner, whose accent had betrayed him ? It is a running fire of puns and crude picturesque expressions which nothing can resist; our Greek market-women would have been more than a match for them—can we bestow upon them greater praise ?27 Some of them sold azumos, a delicate sort of biscuit, but rather tasteless, prepared without leaven ;28 others—irresistible syrens—invited children to taste of the relishing artolaganos, in which a renowned baker had the talent of introducing wine, pepper, oil, and milk.29

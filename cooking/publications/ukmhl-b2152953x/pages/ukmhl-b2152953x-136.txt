96 FRUITS. The Romans sometimes breakfasted on a small quantity of dried fruits ;14 but the third course of their coma, or principal repast, offered an incredible profusion of the productions of their own orchards, and of those of three parts of the world.15 Rich patricians, after they had exhausted all the immense resources of an incredible luxury—in their garments, habitations, and banquets— contrived to plant fruit trees on the summit of high towers, and on the house tops ;16 thus suspending forests over their heads,17 as well as vast reservoirs, to keep alive the most exquisite fish.18 At Rome they had an expensive, but, as they thought, effective pro- cess of preparing pears, apples, plums, figs, cherries, &c., &c., and which was as follows:— The fruit was chosen with great care, and put, with the stalks attached, into honey, leaving to each one sufficient space to prevent their touching each other.19 Our housewives of the 19th century may, perhaps, be curious to try this Roman experiment, if the quantity of honey which it requires does not frighten them.

VARIETY OF REPASTS. 355 more gay or more peaceful than the people, when they are well fed. 7 This remark is much more profound than it at first appears. At Athens, special officers visited the markets, and only permitted each citizen to purchase and keep in his own house the quantity of pro- visions necessary for one year.8 The ediles of Rome performed nearly similar functions.9 The pre- fect of the town was invested with the power of making regulations for the markets,10 and the prefect of provisions had the inspection of the sale of bread meat, wine, fish, and all other kinds of aliment required either for the table of the rich or poor plebeian.11 During a long time, in Greece and Italy, the only charm of repasts was, that they furnished an opportunity for the exercise of those duties of kind hospitality, which Apollodorus has described in the following ingenuous style : “ As soon as a friend,” says he, “ steps on the threshold of his host, the porter receives him with a smiling face ; the dog of the house comes immediately to caress him, amicably wagging his tail; then some one runs and presents him a seat without being told.”12 This last trait is charming. But afterwards, they thought much more of honouring the god of good cheer than Jupiter Hospes, and joyous Comus became every- where the fashionable divinity. One of the ancients describes him in the following manner: “ He is seen at the door of an apartment com- municating with the banqueting hall; his smiling face is fresh, plump, and ruddy; his head is crowned with roses, and he sleeps standing; his left hand rests on a thyrsus, but sleep makes him loose his hold; he staggers, and the torch will soon fall from his grasp.” 13 The Greeks were fervent in their worship of this god, at an epoch when Rome still prided herself on her transcendant sobriety. Conon gave a banquet to all the Athenians after the battle of Cnidos, about four centuries before the Christian era; and his celebrated contempo- rary, the handsome Alcibiades, conqueror in the Olympic games, magni- ficently regaled the numerous spectators who had just applauded his triumph.14 The pagan temples themselves often rung with the sound of the music, the chaunts, and the dances which always accompanied the religious banquets. These feasts in honour of the immortals must have been rather unedifying to the truly faithful, for gaiety generally degenerated into extreme licentiousness.15

SEASONINGS. 277 grains of pepper but a little longer; that they were only to be found in India, in a wood consecrated to the gods; and that they served in the fabrication of perfumes.80 The conquest of India by the Portuguese rendered them common throughout Europe. Cloves contain a considerable quantity of essential aromatic oil, thick, brown, and very heavy, to which it owes its aromatic properties and sharp burning savour. Cloves are employed as a seasoning or as medicine. PEPPER. The two great cities of antiquity knew how to appreciate pepper, and employed it largely in their culinary labours. They distinguished two kinds : one round, the other long and thin.81 Dioscorides and Pliny describe the shrub, on which are to be seen pods filled with seeds of pepper, resembling millet, according to the first of these writers, and like small beans, according to the other.83 Our readers no doubt remember the importance which Apicius ascribes to pepper, in the learned recipes of that skilful Archimagirus. VERJUICE. Verjuice, the use of which is very ancient, was used more in phar- maceutical preparations than in the seasoning of food.83 Galen attributes to it refreshing qualities, and advises it in certain cases.84 Verjuice is a kind of grape, very acid, and which never gets perfectly ripe. The sue of verjuice is used in medicine and culinary preparation as an astringent. The juice is not proper to make wine, but a very agreeable syrup is obtained from it.

132 ANIMAL FOOD. No one could make “ sausages of anything but pork.” No one could sell “ black puddings, for it is a perilous viand.”09 The French word charcutier (pork butcher) is derived from caro coda, chair cuite (cooked meat). The numerous regulations concerning the butchers in France during the J4th century rendered it difficult to carry on the trade: — Prohibition to buy cattle except in the markets. Prohibition to buy pigs fed by barbers or oil dealers. Prohibition to kill cattle not a fortnight old. Prohibition to kill cattle on the eve of fast days. Prohibition to sell stale meat. Prohibition to keep meat more thau two days in winter, or more than one day and a-half in summer. Prohibition to sell meat by lamp light or candle light. The regulations respecting the cleanliness of the slaughter houses and the shambles were very long and very severe.70 A butcher in Paris kept but one single kind of meat, in the 14th century. Pork was sold only at Sainte-Genevieve, mutton at Saint-Marceau, veal at Saint-Germain, and beef at the mai'ket of the Chatelet.71 Philip Augustus gave statutes to the butchers of Paris in the year ] 182. He enjoined them to observe the Sabbath, and permitted them to work on the other days, with the exception of the great festivals.7' The regulations imposed upon them in the L7th century are to the effect, that they shall not keep the fat from one week to another ; that they shall not mix the different kinds of suet; and, lastly, that they shall not have more than three shops, and shall not allow the blood to run in the streets.73

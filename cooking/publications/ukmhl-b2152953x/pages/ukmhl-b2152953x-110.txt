KITCHEN GARDEN. 70 ARTICHOKE. A young and unfortunate beauty had the ill-luck to displease a vindictive and irascible god, who instantly metamorphosed her into an artichoke.89 This poor girl’s name was Cinara. Although she had become a bitter plant she preserved this sweet name, which the moderns have strangely modified. Our readers, who eat artichokes with so much indifference, will, perhaps, sometimes lament this poor victim of a blind resentment. This plant was well known to the ancients ; the hilly regions of Greece, Asia, and Egypt were covered with it;90 but the inhabitants made no use of it as an aliment, and it remained uncultivated.91 It would be rather difficult to trace the precise period when it was first introduced into Italy. All we know is, that it grew there more than half a century before the Christian era, in the time of Dioscorides, who mentioned it.92 It appears, nevertheless, that hardly any one troubled himself about artichokes, or their esculent qualities, up to that time; but the wealthy, about a century after, began to appreciate them, and Pliny, in one of his jesting whims, reproaches the rich with having deprived the lower classes and asses of a, food which nature seemed to have destined for them.93 This vegetable was then very dear,94 for it did not succeed, and was subsequently given up. It was so far forgotten that in the year 1473 it appeared as a novelty at Venice ;95 and towards the year 1405 it was brought from Naples to Florence, whence it passed into France in the sixteenth century.90 Galen97 looked upon the artichoke as a bad food.98 Columella sung its praise in his verses; he recommended it to the disciples of Bacchus, and forbid the use of it to those who were anxious to preserve a sweet and pure voice 99 This plant, whatever may be in other respects its estimable qualities, does not please every one equally well; its bittorness and unpleasant odour keep it at a distance from numerous palates—perhaps because too many allow themselves to be prejudiced by deceitful appearances. Here are two very ingenious methods by means of which a trial might

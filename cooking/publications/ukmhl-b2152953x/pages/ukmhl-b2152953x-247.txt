FEATHERED GAME. 201 curious volume, as it is thought, how comes it he has forgotten a dish so justly celebrated, in this magiric catalogue, in which no detail, how- ever minute, seems to escape him ? It would appear that this contested paternity rightfully belongs to the first Apicius, unless some of the learned contest it on the ground that the style of the work nowise agrees with the latinity of his century.05 May one of the learned societies of Europe some day take up this arduous question, and restore the ancient masterpiece to its admirable author.

Greece would have raised statues to him ; the Roman emperor Vitellius would have shared the Empire with him. In N

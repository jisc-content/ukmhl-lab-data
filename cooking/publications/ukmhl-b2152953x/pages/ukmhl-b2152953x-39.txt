13 AGRICULTURE. it was nothing but a long piece of wood without joint, and {jent in such manner that one end went into the ground, whilst the other served to yoke the oxen ;22 for it was always these animals which drew the plough, although Homer seems to give the preference to mules.23 The Greeks, clever imitators of the Egyptians, pretended that Ceres taught them the art of sowing, reaping, and grinding corn; they made her goddess of harvest, and applied themselves to the labour of agriculture witli that rare and persevering ability which always cha- racterised these people, and consequently was often the cause of many things being attributed to them which they only borrowed from other nations.24 The Romans, future rulers of the world, understood from the first that the earth claimed their nursing care; and Romulus instituted an order of priesthood for no other object than the advancement of this useful art. It was composed of the twelve sons of his nurse, all invested with a sacerdotal character, who were commanded to offer to Heaven vows and sacrifices in order to obtain an abundant harvest. They were called Arvales brothers;25 one of them dying, the king took his place, and continued to fulfil his duty for the rest of his life.26 In the palmy days of the republic, the conquerors of the universe passed from the army or the senate to their fields;27 Seranus wras sowing when called to command the Roman troops, and Quintus Cincinnatus was ploughing when a deputation came and informed him that he was appointed dictator. Everything in the conduct of the Romans gives evidence of their great veneration for agriculture. They called the rich, loctypleles, that is, persons who were possessors of a farm or country seat {locus); their first money was stamped with a sheep or an ox, the symbol of abun- dance: they called it pecunia, from pecus (flock). The public treasure was designated pascua, because the Roman domain consisted, at the beginning, only of pasturage. After the taking of Carthage, the books of the libraries were distri- buted to the allied princes of the republic, but the senate reserved the twenty-eight books of Mago on agriculture.28 We shall briefly point out the principal processes of this art in use among the Greeks and Romans, or at least those which appear to us most deserving ol interest. Like us, the ancients divided the land in furrows, whose legal length (if we may so term it) was one hundred and

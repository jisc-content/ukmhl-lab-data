AGRICULTURE. 18 “ September. Here we find the lord, attended by his huntsmen, pursuing and chasing the wild boars in the woods and forests. “ October. And here he is amusing himself with the exercise of that old and noble pastime, hawking. “ November. This month returns us again to the labourers, who are here heating and preparing their utensils. “ December. In this last month we find them thrashing out the grain, while some winnow or rather sift it, to free it from the chaff, and others carry it out in large baskets to the granaries. In the meantime, the steward keeps an account of the quantity, by means of an indented or notched stick.”54 Agriculture was always protected with paternal solicitude by a prince, whose name will ever remind us of the sanguinary day of Saint Bartholomew. Here is a textual passage from the edict issued by Charles IX., the 18th October, 1571. “We have commanded and ordained, and do hereby command and ordain, that no man engaged in the cultivation of land, by himself, his servants, and his family, with intent to raise grain and fruit necessary for the sustenance of men and beasts, shall be liable to’the process of exe- cution lor debt, nor on any account whatsoever, neither in his own person, nor his bed, horses, mares, mules, asses, oxen, cows, pigs, goats, sheep, poultry, ploughs, carts, waggons, harrows, barrows, nor any other species or kind of cattle or goods serving in the said tillage and occupa- tion. * * * The said husbandmen being under our protection and safeguard, seeing that we have so placed them and do place them by these presents.”55

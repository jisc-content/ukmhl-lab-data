Under the reign of Nero, Rome had nine principal aqueducts16 constructed, the pipes of which were of bricks, baked tiles, stone, lead, or wood.17 According to the calculation of Vigenerus,18 500,000 hogsheads of water were conveyed into Rome every twenty-four hours, by 10,350 small channels, the internal circumference of which was one inch. The water was received in large closed basins, above which were raised splendid monuments. These basins—or chateaux cl eau castella Aquarum—supplied other subterraneous conduits connected with the various quarters of the town,19 which conveyed water to small reservoirs— fontes—furnished with taps, for the exclusive use of certain streets.*0 The water which was not drinkable ran out by means of large pipes into extensive inclosures, where it served to water cattle. At these places the people washed their linen, and here, too, they had a ready resource in case of fire.21 Augustus created water commissaries, who took care that all water coming into Rome by the aqueducts was fairly distributed in every public place, and to those of the inhabitants who had obtained the privilege of having it enter their bouses.22 But the “ingenious thirst”23 of the conquerors of the world could not content itself with a delicious water which nature furnished fine of expense. Was it not too much for human eudurance, that not only the air and the sun could not be offered to the highest bidder,21 but that the same spring was to quench the thirst of obscure plebeians on equal terms with the rich patrician ? Intemperance and luxury very soon contrived to find excellent means of remedying a state of things so intolerable The custom of preserving snow in cellars, to obtain cool beverages, is very old. Aristotle pointed out the method of boiling water, and putting the vessel afterwards in snow, in order to obtain ice. Rome had recourse to this expedient, which was afterwards replaced with advantage, under Nero, by con- structing ice houses for the use of opulent epicureans.25 This even was not enough for voluptuous Romans, slaves to their strange caprices; their beverages did not appear to them as yet suffi- ciently cool,20 and the summit of the Alps was put under contribution to furnish ice for the fashionable tables of the imperial city.27

ANIMALS. 138 (great amateurs of pork)43 sent them at a low price, with an enormous quantity of pickled pork, andouillettes, and sausages.44 This last preparation, very celebrated in Lucania,45 served as a means of livelihood to a great number of Homan women, who also employed themselves in making excellent black puddings, in imitation of those eaten in Greece.46 Bacon was then of great utility, as in the present day, though oil superseded it in the concoction of a host of dishes. Bacon for a long time served almost as the exclusive food of the Romans,47 before then- unruly luxury had given it up to the soldiers and proletarians.48 It was also found in all public houses,40 where the populace habitually gorged themselves with pork, vegetables,''0 and hot water.''1 The ancients salted the pig, in order to preserve it; but Apicius taught them a very simple process for the use of epicures, which advantageously replaced common brine.

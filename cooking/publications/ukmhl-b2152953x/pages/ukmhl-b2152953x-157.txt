XIV. SHELL FEU IT. ALMOND TREE. This tree, whose fruit was called at one time “Greek Nut,” and, at another, “ Thasian Nut,”1 is a native of Paphlagonia, according to Her- mippus.2 The nations of the east thought much of almonds, and Jacob found them worthy of appearing among the presents he designed for Joseph.3 The almond tree of Naxos supplied the markets of Athens.4 The Romans, in their turn, sought them, and believed, like the physician spoken of by Plutarch, that it was only necessary to eat five or six almonds to acquire the ability of drinking astonishingly.5 Besides, this fruit had not always so mean a destination: the dis- ciples of Apicius made of it one of the most delicate of dishes. Here it is. as taught to them by their master :— Take almonds that have been pounded in a mortar, and mix them with honey, pepper, garum, milk, eggs, and a little oil; submit the whole to the action of a slow fire.6 The ancients were acquainted with the oil of almonds,7 of which they made nearly the same use as we do ourselves; but they possessed, in addition, an infallible means of augmenting the fertility of the almond tree. It was very simple :—A hole was made in the tree, a stone was introduced into it,8 and, thanks to the virtue of this new manure, the branches soon bent under the weight of almonds. The good almonds come from Barbary and the south of France.

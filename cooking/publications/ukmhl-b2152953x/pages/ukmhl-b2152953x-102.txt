At the expiration of that time the cauliflowers are placed in an oven half-warm, and are kept there till the stalks are dry; they are then wrapped in paper to preserve them from damp. To keep the headed cabbages, divide them in six or eight pieces, according to size, throw them for an instant in boiling water, then withdraw and plunge them in vinegar, which from time to time must be changed, especially at the beginning, taking care to add always a little salt.”—Dutour. BEET. Columella pretends that this plant owes its name {beta) to its re- semblance to the letter B.25 We shall leave to the professional etymologist the trouble of examining whether Columella made a mistake or not. The Greeks had two distinct sorts of beet—the black and the pale; they preferred the latter,20 especially when it came from Ascrea in Boeotia.27 They called this species Sicilian beet; and the physician Diphilus—who joined to his knowledge of botany that sort of gastro- phagic intuition, that culinary mens divinior, whose inspiration never leads astray—placed it far above the cabbage, notwithstanding the es- timable qualities of this latter vegetable.28 He recommended it to be eaten boiled, with mustard, and considers this food as a very excellent vermifuge.29 The beet has not found favour with Martial, who, always caustic and severe, calls it an insipid dish.30 This injurious, and perhaps unjust, epithet would doubtless have exercised a fatal influence upon the des- tiny of this most inoffensive of vegetables, if an opponent of greater weight had not entered the lists against the atrabilarious poet. We read in Apicius: “ Boil, over a slow fire, some very tender white beet; add leeks, which have been taken from their native soil some days previous; wdien all this is cooked put it into a saucepan with pepper, gravy, and raisin wine; take care that the ebullition be regulai, and serve.

PIP FRUIT. 107 an aliment, and next, as a counter-poison :12 gourmandise made the mind docile, and none doubted its marvellous virtues. This fruit, so much extolled, was preserved by placing it with its branches and leaves in a vessel, afterwards filled with honey or sweet wine, which was reduced to half the quantity by ebullition.13 PEAR TREE. Many countries have disputed the honour of having given birth to the pear tree. According to some it wras a native of Mount Ida, so re- nowned for its refreshing fountains; others said Alexandria; and in the opinion of some writers it came from different parts of Greece. Let us add to this enumeration Palestine, where this tree grew at a very remote period.14 It results from these different allegations that the ancients were acquainted with the pear tree; that they cultivated and were fond of pears, 'which is not at all surprising, as they are an excellent fruit. Theophrastus was very fond of them; he speaks of them very often,15 and always with praise. The same thing may be affirmed of Pliny,16 and more particularly of Galen, whose medical authority was formerly of so much weight. The learned physician of Pergamo is pleased to recognise in the pear strengthening qualities which benefit the stomach, and an astringent virtue which the apple does not possess in the same degree.17 Like us, the Greeks and Romans distinguished several kinds of this fruit, whose names indicated their taste and forms. It is not certain whether they possessed the Bon Chretien, which honours our tables in winter, either raw or cooked. This name reminds us of its origin, which we will relate. Louis XI., King of France, had sent for Saint Francois de Paule from the lower part of Calabria, in the hopes of recovering his health through his intercession. The saint brought with him the seeds of this pear, and as he was called at court Le Bon Chretien, this fruit received the name of him to whom France owed its introduction.18 H 2

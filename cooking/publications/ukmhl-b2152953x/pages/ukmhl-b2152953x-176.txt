ANIMALS. 134 The inhabitants of Cyprus abstained from it, in order to offer it to Venus.1 The Cretans loaded it with acorns and all the comforts of life, because Jupiter was first suckled by a sow in their island.2 The Egyptian priests never allowed a ham to grace their feasts ; they fled at the sight of pigs, unclean beings, whose presence alone defiled them,3 although respected by the whole nation on account of the services they rendered in turning up the earth, and covering the seeds thrown upon it.4 The law of Moses forbad the JevTs to eat this quadruped, or to touch it after its death,5 and more than once they exposed themselves to the most frightful torments rather than be defiled by this proscribed viand.6 Tradition, again, strengthened their religious dread, by interdicting the faithful from even pronouncing the name of this animal, from looking at it, or selling it to foreign nations.7 The fear of the frightful malady to which the pig was subject in Palestine was, perhaps, the cause of this prohibition.

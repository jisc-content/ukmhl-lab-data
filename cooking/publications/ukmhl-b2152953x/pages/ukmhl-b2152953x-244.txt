FEATHERED GAME. 200 THE STARLING. Drusus and Britannicus, sons of the Emperor Claudius, had a starling which spoke admirably the Greek and Latin. Alone he studied his lessons, and afterwards recited them to the astonished princes.61 Science protected the learned bird from the fate reserved by the Greeks and Romans for the rest of its family, less distinguished by their erudition than by their culinary qualities. Starlings, roasted in the kitchens, honourably associated with partridges, blackbirds, and thrushes,62 and the disciples of Galen recommended them to their patients, who willingly submitted to so nourishing and light a food.63 THE FLAMINGO. A profound study of the art of good cheer caused the Romans to discover that the thick tongue of the phenicopter, or flamingo, presents towards its root a rather considerable adipose appendage. They tasted this lump of fat, and Rome was enriched with another dish. It has been asserted that the glory of inventing this refinement in gluttony is due to Apicius. Italy possessed three gastrophiles of this name : the first flourished a short time before the dictatorship of Julius Caesar; the second, Marcus Gabius, held a school of sensuality at Rome, under the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius; the third, Cselius, was con- temporary with Trajan, and poisoned himself for fear of dying of hunger. We possess, under the name of this last, a Latin work in ten hooks, from which we have borrowed largely, as the reader may have already re- marked. It would be difficult to decide to which of the three Apicn it belongs. The author speaks of the flamingo, but does not mention its tongue : the treatise, then, is not the work of M. Gabius, who would doubtless have indicated the preparation of a dish of which Pliny assures us he was so fond.64 As to Caelius, if he were the compiler of this

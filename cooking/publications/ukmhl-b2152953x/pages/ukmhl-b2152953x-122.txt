82 KITCHEN GARDEN. The ancients, great lovers of the marvellous, believed that this despised vegetable possessed a sovereign virtue against the greater number of diseases,191 and that it was easy to deprive it of its penetrating odour by sowing and gathering it when the moon was below the horizon.18* The Greek and Roman cooks used it but very seldom, and it was only employed as a second or third-rate ingredient in some preparations of Apicius which we shall hereafter mention. “ Garlic is called the physic of the peasantry, especially in warm countries, where it is eaten before going to work, in order to guarantee them from the pernicious effects of foul air. It would be too long were we to relate all that has been written in favour of this vegetable; let it suffice to say that it is employed in numerous pharmaceutical prepara- tions, and among others in vinegar, celebrated by the name of aromatic vinegar.”—Bose. ESCHALOTS. Alexander the Great found the eschalot in Phoenicia, and introduced it into Greece. Its Latin name, Ascalonica, indicates the place of its origin, Ascalon, a city of Idumea.193 Its affinity with garlic set the ancients against its culinary qualities, and this useful plant, too much neglected, only obtained credit in modern times. PARSLEY. Hercules, the conqueror of the Nemsean lion, crowned himself with parsley ; a rather modest adornment for so great a hero, when others, for exploits much less worthy, were decked with laurels. A similar crown became, subsequently, the prize of the Nemoean194 and Isthmian Games.198

27 GRINDING OF CORN. gence, had recourse to this hard occupation, in order to earn a living. Plautus was obliged to work at it, and we know that he wrote some of his comedies during the short moments of leisure allowed him by his master the miller.30 An important modification was subsequently made in the mechanism of mills: we mean hydraulic mills, whose introduction into Italy is of uncertain date, although Pomponius Sabinus asserts (hut without proof), that this discovery took place in the reign of Julius Caesar. They were known in Eome at the time of the Emperor Augustus, and Vitruvius mentions them.31 More than sixty years afterwards, Pliny speaks of them as rare and extraordinary machines.32 Some writers have thought that hy dr aula, or hydromilce,' watermills, were invented by Vitruvius, and that this celebrated architect made experiments with them, which were forgotten or neglected after his death.33 Curious readers, who are not afraid of the venerable dust with which time has covered many useful though despised books, will consult with benefit the learned treatise of Goetzius on the mills of the ancients, printed in the year 1730.34 Strabo, who flourished under the Emperor Augustus, tells us a watermill was to be seen near the town of Cabire and the palace of Mithridates.35 Nevertheless, this useful invention, which we could not now dispense with, made so little progress during four centuries that princes thought it a duty to protect, by several laws, those establishments, still rare, but which people began to appreciate. Honorius and Arcadius decreed, in 398, that any person who turned the water from mills for Ins own profit, should be punished by a fine of five pounds weight in gold; and that any magistrate encouraging such an act should pay a like sum.36 The Emperor Zeno37 maintained this law, and rendered it still more stringent by adding, that the edifices or land into which the water had been turned should be confiscated.38 It is to be regretted that the precise origin of the millerâ€™s profession cannot be traced; but, alas! in almost all the arts which tend to preserve life, we discover the same uncertainty: we are ignorant of the period of their discovery, and it frequently happens that but few traces of their development remain. On the contrary, the dates of battles, or scourges which have decimated the human race, are certain enough : the stain of blood leaves an impression which can never be effaced. c 2

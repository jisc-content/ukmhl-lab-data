Nicomachus mentions them: “My father,” says he, “ had left me a poor little estate; in a few months I made it as round as an egg; then, breaking the shell, I made but one gulp of it.” 79 At Home, this aliment was prepared in twenty different manners; they pickled it,80 cooked it in water, on hot ashes, on charcoal, and in the fryingpan.

ANIMALS. 151 The Greeks, that people so charming by their seductive folly, their love of the arts, their poetic civilization, and the intelligent spirit of research presiding over their dishes—the Greeks (we grieve to say it) ate dogs, and even dared to think them good: the grave Hippocrates himself—the most wise, the least gluttonous, and therefore the most impartial of their physicians—was convinced that this quadruped fur- nished a wholesome and, at the same time, a light food. As to the Romans, they also liked it,160 and no doubt prepared it in the same manner as the hare, which they thought it resembled in taste.157 However, it is but right to add, that this dish, which we will not even hear mentioned, was never favourably received by the fashionable portion of Roman society, and that the legislators of ancient gastro- phagy even repulsed it with disdain. There is every reason to believe that the people regaled themselves with a roast or boiled dog, especially once a year, at the period when they celebrated the deliverance of the Capitol from the siege of the Gauls. It is known that, at this solemnity, a goose, laid on a soft cushion, was carried in triumph, followed by an unhappy dog nailed to a cross,158 whose loud cries greatly amused the populace. In this manner they commemorated the signal service rendered by one animal, and the fatal negligence of the other. The Gauls scaled the Capitol while the dogs slept, and Rome had been lost if the deafening cries of the geese had not given an alarm to the garrison, who, it must be allowed, should have kept better watch. The quadrupeds last mentioned are the only domestic animals of the land used as food by the ancients. The chase afforded them several others, which we shall mention, after having just glanced at the poultry —one of the most interesting divisions in natural history for the serious and reflective apjtreciator of gastronomic productions.

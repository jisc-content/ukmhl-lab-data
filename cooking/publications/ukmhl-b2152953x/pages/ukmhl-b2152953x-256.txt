XXI. FISH. Perhaps it has not been sufficiently remarked that the science of ichthyopliagy is generally developed in a direct ratio with the civilization of a people. Man began at first by satisfying the imperious necessities of his stomach ; he then eat to live, and ah was good to him. Experience by degrees gave rise to eclectismâ€”choice. It was then discoveied that a coarse and solid food might be replaced by a delicate and savoury alimentation; joyous appetite, and sensuality, its effeminate companion, took the place of hunger, and this happy couple gave birth to the more amiable of fairies, who, under the name of Gastronomy, was soon to govern the world and prescribe to it imperishable laws. It is asserted that the art of preparing fish was one of the first boons of this powerful sovereign, and that, instructed by her, Thetis rendered iclithyophagist the god of light and the fine arts. The Jews, an agricultural people, living far from the borders of the sea, attached but very little importance to fishing and the researches necessarily attendant on it; so much so, that we hardly perceive any trace among them of this kind of food, which Moses did not entirely interdict, since that wise legislator was satisfied with prohibiting fishes without scales or fins.2 What an immense wealth remained unexplored ! Let us pity them for not having known how to profit by it, notwith- standing the good will of the Phoenicians, inhabitants of the coast, who brought them the produce of their maritime excursions. Let us say it: the Hebrews were tolerably bad cooks. They pos- sessed most admirable laws, a fertile country, courage and many virtues, but their sobriety never would allow them to understand the art of good living. In that, they are to be pitied.

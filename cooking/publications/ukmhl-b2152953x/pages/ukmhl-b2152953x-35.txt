11 AGRICULTURE. away to prophesy while at work with one of his fathers ploughs.8 We could multiply these incidents without end, to prove what extraordinary interest the Jews took in agricultural occupations. Moses regarded agriculture as the first of all arts, and he enjoined the Hebrews to apply themselves to it in preference to any other: it was to the free and pure air of the fields, to the strengthening, healthy, and laborious country life, that he called their first attention. The sages of Greece and Rome held the same opinion: in those republics the tradesman was but an obscure individual, while the tiller of the soil was considered as a distinguished citizen. The urban tribes yielded precedence to the rustics, and this latter class supplied the nation with its generals and its magistrates.9 Our present ideas on this point have materially changed with the times, and our modern Cincinnati very sel- dom return to the field to terminate the furrow they have commenced. The Israelites did not possess this excessive delicacy : they preserved the taste for agriculture with which their great legislator, Moses, had inspired them, and which the distribution of land naturally tended to strengthen. No one, in fact, was allowed to possess enough ground to tempt him to neglect the smallest portion; nor had any one the right to dispossess the Hebrew of his father’s field,—even he himself was for- bidden to alienate for ever land from his family.10- This wise disposi- tion did not escape the notice of an ancient heathen author," and va- rious states of Greece adopted the same plan; amongst others, the Lo- crians, Athenians, and Spartans, who did not allow their fathers’ inhe- ritance to be sold.12 The plan which we have adopted for our guidance in this work hardly justifies us in casting more than a glance at the Mosaic legisla- tion ; we shall, therefore, pass over all those prescriptions, all those memorable prohibitions, which the reader must have so often admired in the Books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy, and content ourselves with observing that Moses knew how to find in agriculture an infallible means of developing the industry of his people, and that, by imposing the necessity of giving rest to the land every seventh year,13 he obliged them, by the generality of this repose, to have stores in reserve; and con- sequently to employ every means of preserving portions of the grain, fruit, wines, and oil which they had gathered in the course of the six years preceding.

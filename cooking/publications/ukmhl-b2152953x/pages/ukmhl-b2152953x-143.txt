103 STONE FRUIT. Greece,58 where they were gladly received as in all other nations, on account of their form, taste, and qualities. This happy gastrologic event was accomplished 300 years before the Christian era, whereas the intro- duction of cherry trees by Lucullus took place 228 years later. The capital of the world knew not, at first, how to appreciate this present as it deserved : the cherry tree was propagated so slowly in Italy, that more than a century after its introduction it was far from being generally cultivated.60 The Romans distinguished three principal species of cherries : the Apronian, of a bright red, with a firm and delicate pulp ; the Lutatian, very black and sweet; the Castilian, round and stubby, and much esteemed.00 This fruit embellished the third course in Rome, and the second at [Athens. “ The fruit of the cherry tree is eaten raw, cooked, preserved with sugar, and in brandy ; it is also preserved dry, or made into ratafia.

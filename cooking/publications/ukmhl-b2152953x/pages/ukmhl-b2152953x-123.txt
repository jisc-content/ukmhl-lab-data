83 KITCHEN GARDEN. Anacreon, that amiable and frivolous poet, who consecrated all his moments to pleasure, celebrates parsley as the emblem of joy and festivity ;ia0 and Horace, a philosophic sensualist of the same stamp, commanded his banquetting hall to be ornamented with roses and parsley.197 Perhaps it was thought that the strong, penetrating odour of parsley possessed the property of exciting the brain to agreeable imaginations ; if so, it explains the fact of its being worn by guests, placed round their heads. Fable has made it the food of Juno's coursers.198 In battle, the warriors of Homer fed their chargers with it;199 and Melancholy, taking it for the symbol of mourning, admitted it at the dismal repasts of obsequies.200 Let us seek to discover in this plant qualities less poetic and less brilliant, but, assuredly, more real and positive. In the first place:— Wash some parsley with the roots adhering; dry it well in the sun; boil it in water, and leave it awhile on one side; then put into a sauce- pan some garlic and leeks, which must boil together a long time, and very slowly, until reduced to two-thirds—that done, pound some pepper, mix it with gravy and a little honey, strain the water in which the parsley was boiled, and pour it over the parsley and the whole of the other ingredients. Put the stewpan once more on the fire, and serve.201 The following recipe is much less complicated and more expe- ditious:— Boil the parsley in water, with nitre ; press out all the water; cut it very fine; then mix, with care, some pepper, alisander, marjoram and onions; add some wine, gravy, and oil; stew the whole, with the j^arsley, in an earthen pot or stewpan.202 If the illustrious pupil of Chiron, the warlike Achilles, had known the culinary properties of parsley as well as he knew its medicinal virtues, he no doubt would have been less prodigal with it for his horses;203 and the conquerors of Troy would have comforted themselves, during the tediousness of a long siege, by cooking this aromatic plant, and enjoying a new dish. Parsley, according to some writers, was of Egyptian origin; but it is not known who brought it into Sardinia, where it was found by the Carthaginians, who afterwards made it known to the inhabitants of Marseilles.

FISH. 2Â«7 DRAGON WEAVER. The dragon weaver traversed unseen the long and brilliant gastro- nomic period of the Romans. Greece rendered it more justice;193 but its too modest qualities were not able to preserve it from forgetfulness and indifference. LOLIGO. At Rome the loligo, a species of cuttle-fish, was sometimes served with pepper and rue, mixed with garum, honey, sweet wine boiled, and a few drops of oil.191 SOLE. This fish, which the Greeks caught on the coast,195 was much sought after on account of the delicacy of its nourishing and light flesh.196 The flounder, the brill, the diamond and Dutch plaice, which, together with the sole, were known under the general name of passeres, enjoyed an equal esteem, and had attributed to them the same qualities. ANGEL-FISH. In Holland there are angel fish of enormous size;197 and Aldro- vandus relates that some have been seen which weighed as much as 160 lbs.198 In the time of this naturalist the common people did not eat them very willingly. FILE-FISII. The flesh of this species of the bulistes is only good when fried, ac- cording to Marcgrave. Columella thinks much of it,199 and Pliny ranks it among the saxcitdes, the most esteemed by connoisseurs.900

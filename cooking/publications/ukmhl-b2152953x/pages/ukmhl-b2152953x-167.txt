ANIMAL FOOD. 127 REARING OF CATTLE. All ancient legislators have bestowed the most serious attention to the rearing and preservation of cattle. The Mosaic law, in this respect, enters into details which reveal the most profound wisdom, a delicate and minute research which cannot be too much admired. More attentive to propagate useful animals than to flatter the sen- suality of nations, this law forbids their being mutilated ;27 it requires the Hebrews to treat with generosity the companions of their labour ;28 that they shall interest themselves in the preservation of their brother’s, and even of their enemies’ oxen ;29 that different species of unequal strength shall not be yoked together to the plough ;30 and, in order that the cattle may not suffer from an excess of hard and constant labour, Moses assures to them at least one day of rest in a week.31 It is well known with what care the patriarchs surrounded their flocks; for them they wandered from region to region, and only stopped where pasture was abundant.32 In imitation of those fathers of nations, the princes of the East, and the Grecian chiefs, wrere at firsbshepherds ;33 and were, perhaps, indebted to the innocent occupations of the fields for the sweet and sacred title of pastors of man.31 The founder of Rome did not forget the flocks and herds, in those famous laws which were to assure the prosperity of his rising city ;35 one of them allowed the possessor of an estate to take up the acorns which might fall into his field from his neighbour’s property,36 and to divide them among the cattle he is rearing.

Adrian, among others, did not encourage thieves. This prince ordered that whoever earned away cattle grazing in meadows should be con-

At the end of forty days the summit of the root is cut transversely; then a small bundle ol herbs is laid over, so as not to touch it. A whitish liquor exudes from the cut, and every other day it is gathered ;• the cut is renewed until the root is quite exhausted. The result of this crop is laid on leaves, and dried in the sun”—Bose. SUMACH. The Homans made use of the seed to flavour several kinds of dishes.49 GINGER. This root was known at Home under the Emperors, and many per- sons have confounded ginger with pepper, although they in no way resemble each other. Pliny refutes this error, and represents it as a native of Arabia.50 It was used with other condiments.0' “ The Indians grate this root in their broth or ragout; they make a paste which they believe is good against the scurvy. The inhabi- tants of Madagascar eat it green, in salad, cut in small pieces, and mixed with other herbs, which they season wTith salt, oil, and vinegar. In other places ginger is taken infused as a drink; it fortifies the chest, and awakens the appetite. It is preserved in sugar after it has been stripped of its bark, and soaked in vinegar. Delicious preserves are made of it with much perfume, and which keep a very long time.”— Dutour.

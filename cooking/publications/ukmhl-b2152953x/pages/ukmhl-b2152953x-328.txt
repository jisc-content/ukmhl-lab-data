270 SEASONINGS. continual contradictions of commentators, that if garum is no longer manufactured in the present day, it is not on account of the impossi- bility we find in discovering the recipe of the Greeks and Latins, hut solely because this rather strange brine has not the same charm for us that it had for them. Let us, however, scan the authorities. The Greeks called the shrimp garos, the Romans garus: it may hence be supposed that garum had originally for basis the flesh of shrimps, if Pliny had not taken the trouble to inform us of the fact.10 It was afterwards composed of other fish, but it always retained the name which recalled its origin.20 In like manner the signification of certain words is now applied to things quite different from the original type : chicory, or succory, is received under the mask of coffee : a certain pottage boldly usurps the honours due exclusively to turtle soup. Nothing more easy than to multiply these examples of catachreses: there are few figures which have become so common. Well, then, they macerated the intestines of fish in water, saturated with salt, until putrefaction began to show itself; they then added parsley and vinegar.21 A thick garum was also frequently obtained, by allowing the entrails and other parts, generally thrown away, to liquefy in salt.22 In the time of Pliny, mackerel23 was preferred, of which they employed either the gills and intestines, or only the blood, directly the fish left the water,24 and while yet living. They thus obtained a precious liquid, and which the care necessary for its production rendered so dear, that eight pints of it cost no less than from fifteen to twenty pounds. This expensive garum was especially esteemed when it came from Spain : it was then called “ garum of the allies garum sociorum because it was received from a nation allied with the Romans; or, again, perhaps in allusion to the “ band of gluttons, of Rome, a sort of liatei nity of free-livers, who made great use of it.27 The blood and entrails of the tunny fish, mixed with salt in a vase, produced also a most elaborate garum. A hole was made in the vessel at the expiration of two months, and the rich seasoning flowed from it.28 This brine became exquisite, and obtained an exorbitant price when made from the liver of anchovies macerated in vinegar, pepper, salt, parsley, garlic, white wine, and sweet herbs.20 But Apicius attained at the first step the apogee of refinement of the most sensual gluttony, by inventing garum made from the liver of red mullet.30 What we have

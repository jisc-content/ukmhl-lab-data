It had considerably swelled in the cooking; I could hardly recognise the shape, hut it appeared so good, exhaled so inviting an odour, that I hastened to taste it. It was a dish for a king. Although I had often heard the bear’s foot praised, I could not conceive how so heavy, so material an animal as the elephant, could furnish a dish so fine and delicate. * * * And I devoured, without bread, my elephant s foot, while my Hottentots, seated around me, regaled themselves with other parts, which they found, equally delicious.”117 The Romans never evinced fondness for the flesh of the elephant. This animal, with its gigantic proportions and rare intelligence, was found to he so amusing to the nation of kings, when dancing on the tight rope,118 or in the terrible combats of the Circus, that they haidly thought of roasting it, or making it into fricassees. We cannot, how- ever, affirm that the gastronomic eccentricity of some Roman epicure did not dream of a monstrous feast, in which he may have offered to his guests an elephant a la Troyenne on a silver dish, made purposely foi the occasion.

WINE. .‘338 By five ordinances, in the years 802, 803, 8JO, 81*2, and 813, Charlemagne declares habitual drinkers unworthy of being heard before courts of justice in their own cause, or as witness for another.170 Francis I. decreed, by an edict, in the month of August, 1530, that whosoever should be found intoxicated was to he imprisoned on bread and water for the first offence; the second time, flogging in the prison was added ; the third time, he was publicly flogged ; and if the offender was incorrigible, his ears were cut off, he was deemed infamous, and banished the kingdom.171 Now every one is free to quench his thirst, and drink more if he chooses. “ The Crafte to make Ypocras.—Take a quarte of red wine, an ounce of synamon, /me halfe an once (ounce) of gvnger, a quarter of an unnce (ounce) of greynes and long pepper, and halfe a pound of suger, aud brose all this (not too small), and then put them in a bage of wullen clothe, made therefore (for that purpose), with the wire, and it liange over a vessel tyll the wine be run thorowe (through).”172—Quoted by Strutt. The English were extremely partial to a drink they called Clarey, or Clarre. According to Arnold 173 it was compounded in the following manner:— “For eighteen gallons of good wyne, take halfe a pounde of ginger, quarter of a pound of long peper, an ounce of safron, a quarter of an ounce of coliaundyr, two ounces of calomole dromatycus, and the third part as much honey that is clarifyed as of youre wyne, streyne them through a cloth, and do it into a clene vessell.” John, in the first year of his reign, made a law that a tun of Rochelle wine should not be sold for more than twenty shillings, a tun of wine from Anjou for twenty-three shillings, and a tun of French wine foi twenty-five shillings, except some that might be of the very best sort, which was allowed to be raised to twenty-six shillings and fourpence, but not for more, in any case. By retail, a gallon of Rochelle wine was to be sold for fourpence, and a gallon of white wine for sixpence, and no dearer.174

ANIMALS. 140 was made of them in Athens.137 Certain connoisseurs, whose authority had weight, preferred, however, those produced in the Island of Moelos.1'8 A great many also came from Sicily: they were in less repute, and sold at a low price.139 At Rome, the kid of Italy was much thought of; the most delicate were fattened at Tivoli,140 and in different localities of the Roman Campagna.141 Kid a la Trans-Tiberienne.—'The kid is to be cooked slowly, with a little milk, four ounces of honey, an ounce of pepper, a little salt and benzoin. After some time, add eight dates crushed in a mortar, a little gravy, garum, a small quantity of excellent wine ; the whole is thickened with fine flour.142 Roast Kid ci la Janiculum— Empty and carefully clean a kid ; rub it well with oil and pepper; sprinkle with salt and a large quantity of coriander seed; place it in the oven, and bake slowly.113 Kid a la Tarpeienne — Empty the kid ; stuff it, and sew it up ; then entirely cover it with a thick mixture of pepper, rue, winter savory, onions, a small quantity of thyme, and some garum; then place it in an oven, or on a dish, covered with oil. When the kid is cooked, you surround it with a sauce of winter savory, onions, rue, dates, mixed with wine, oil, and cooked wine; sprinkle with pepper, and serve.144 Kid a la Tivoli.—Bake the kid; then pound some pepper, rue, onions, winter savory, and Damascus plums (without their stones), a little benzoin, which you must dilute in wine, garum, and oil; throw this sauce on the kid as you withdraw it from the oven, and, at the moment of serving, cover it with boiling wine.145 Kid a la Melissienne.—Draw the kid at the neck, and clean the intestines; then pound some pepper, alisander, benzoin root, two hay leaves, and a little Spanish camomile; add two or three brains; mix them well together; then add some garum and a little salt; afterwards, a small quantity of milk and honey. Fill the intestines with this stuffing, and place them round the kid, which you then put into a large : basin on the fire. When half-cooked, you must add a mixture of garum, oil, and wine. Then bruise some pepper and alisander seed, which moisten with the gravy of the kid, and a little cooked wine; pour it into the basin, and the moment before serving thicken with fine flour.146

351 REPASTS. The necessity for this measure is demonstrated by the fact, of which we read in the chronicles of Stow,98 that, “at the marriage of Lionel, Duke of Clarence, the third sou of Edward III., with Violentis, the daughter of Galeasius IT., Duke of Milan, there was a rich feast, in which above thirty courses were served at the table, and the fragments that remained were more than sufficient to have served a thousand people.” The same chronicler also informs us that King Richard II. held the Christmas feasts in the great hall of Westminster in 1899, “ and such numbers came, that every day there were slain twenty-six or twenty-eight oxen and three hundred sheep, besides fowls without number.”99 Richard Nevil, Earl of Warwick, kept so good a table, that his guests often eat six fat oxen for their breakfast.100 “ In number of dishes and change of meate,” says Holinshed,101 “ the nobilitie of Englande do most exceede, sith there is no daye in maner that passeth over their heades, wherein they have not onely beefe, mutton, veale, lambe, kidde, pork, conie, capon, pigge, or so many of these as the season yieldeth, but also some portion of the redde or fallow deere, beside great varietie of fishe and wilde fowle, and thereto sundrie other delicates, wherein the sweet hand of the portingale is not wanting ” So early as the 16th century the inhabitants of the City of London were remarkable for the astonishing profusion of their repasts, if we are to believe the poet Massinger— “ Men may talk of country Christmas, and court gluttony, Their thirty pounds for buttered eggs, their pies of carps’ tongues, Their pheasants drenched with ambergrise; the carcases Of three fat wethers bruised for gravy, to Make sauce for a single peacock:—yet their feasts Were fasts, compared with the City’s.”102 The description of one dish will enable us to judge of the others— “ Three sucking pigs, served up in a dish, Took from the sow as soon as she had farrowed, A fortnight fed with dates and muskadine,* That stood my master in twenty marks a piece ; Besides the puddings in their bellies, made Of I know not what.’’103 * A sort of wine, much esteemed.

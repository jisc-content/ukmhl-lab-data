ANIMALS. 150 THE ASS. The ass was an impure animal, according to the law of Moses, whose flesh was forbidden because it did not ruminate.147 However, at the siege of Samaria, the Jews were compelled to eat it for want of other food. The famine was such, that the head of an ass was sold for eighty pieces of silver.148 The Roman peasants thought the flesh of the young ass had a very agreeable taste,149 and regaled themselves with it at their rustic festivals. The celebrated Mecaenas one day tasted of this dish at the house of one of his free slaves; he spoke of it with much praise, caused it to be served on his own table, and even succeeded in introducing it on those of the great and rich, who gave up the onager, or wild ass, which they had hitherto preferred, to humour this illustrious favourite. But this new gastronomic conquest had only a short vogue; and was forgotten after the death of Mecsenas.150 Galen tells us that the cooks of Alex- andria thought much of the ass,151 whose flesh, he says, much resembles that of the stag.152 Still, this great physician disapproves of the use of this food, which he considers unsuited to mankind.1'13 It is asserted, even at the present day, that the flesh of the young ass is a pretty good dish ; we have heard, but we hardly can repeat it, that much is consumed in the guinguettes round Paris, where the artless customers are far from thinking that anything else but veal can be served to them. The modern restaurateurs of the Barrieres of Paris, have, perhaps, read the biography of Mecsenas, and endeavour to render popular the dish so honoured by the celebrated favourite. Who can blame them ? THE DOG. We must beg pardon of the reader for informing him that the dog presented a very relishing dish to many nations advanced in culinary science. To them, one of these animals, young, plump, and delicately prepared, appeared excellent food.1-'4

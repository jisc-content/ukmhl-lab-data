AGRICULTURE. 10 No. 2 a. Represents a plough, composed aecording to the 1 Georgian ol ng> . fields, the emperor with all his court paid a visit to his country residence near Pekin, and then marked out several furrows with his plough. In 171)3, the National Convention of France instituted also a similar fete; and the president of the local administration of his county was to mark out a furrow. In 1848 a grand republican procession took place through Paris, to the Champ de Mars, wherein agriculture played a prominent part. The first treatise on agriculture was printed in 1538; and its im- portance has been so much felt from that period, that there are now in France more than one hundred and twenty societies of agriculture, who distribute prizes to encourage discoveries for the improvement of this science. We have, in our days, the Royal Agricultural Society of England, which also awards prizes ;* and through such institutions all information can be obtained on the successive progresses made in that indispensable art, which may be said to have arrived to such a degree of perfection, that future generations may find some difficulty in improving upon it. One great evidence of which is, the immense number of samples ol agricultural produce, machines, and implements ol husbandry, which great and the glorious Exhibition of 1851 has ushered to the world. Previous to the arrival of the Romans, the ancient Britons paid but ^ little attention to agriculture. Their intestine discords left them scarcely any leisure to cultivate their fields, or apply themselves to the improve- ment of an art which flourishes only in peaceful times. They reared a great number of cattle ; but their, chief corn was barley, of which they made their favourite drink. They put the grain in the ear into barns, and beat it out as they wanted it. Those inhabitants of the island who were the least civilized subsisted solely on milk and the flesh ol animals, * A grand banquet was held by the Royal Agricultural Society, at Exeter, on July 20th, 1850, for description of which see end of volume.

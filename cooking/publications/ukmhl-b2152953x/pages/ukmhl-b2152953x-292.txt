246 risn. SCALLOP. The effeminate inhabitants of Tarentum, the abode of luxury, de- lighted in good living, and boasted of possessing the finest scallops of Campania, and of the whole empire.251 The infallible authority of this voluptuous city in matters of taste gave a surprising vogue to this fish. Rome, and all the population of Italy, believed it was forced to eat the scallops of Tarentum prepared with oysters, and at other times with mussels. It now remains to be mentioned that some kinds of testacea appealed worthy of the reputation they acquired among the ancients. TORTOISE. The Greeks and Latins speak with admiration of the enormous size of certain tortoises in their time, the whole species of which were com- prised under the generic word tesiudo.252 The Indian Sea produced some so large, that the shell of one only amply served to roof a comfortable and elegant cottage.253 The inhabitants of the shores of the Red Sea never troubled themselves with building sloops; large shells of tortoises spared them the trouble, by supplying them with charming little barks, which lightly floated on the water.254 And, lastly, in the Ganges, tortoise shells were found, capable of containing no less than 20 amphora, or about 500 pints. The inhabitants of the Peloponnesus did the tortoise the signa honour of representing its image on their money.250 The blood cured diseases of the eye,257 and the flesh-in great request-was though excellent eating. It was cut into pieces of a middling size, and place m a saucepan with pepper, rue, and scallions, crushed in the same mortar; over this was poured honey, garum, raisin wine common wine and a small quantity of good oil. At the moment of ebullition, whole was thickened with flour.2-8

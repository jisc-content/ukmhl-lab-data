37 MANIPULATION OF FLOUR. use as bread. Its name, its form, and flavour indicated the various ranks of society to which it belonged.511 There was the senator’s bread, that of the knights, of the citizens, of the people, and that of the peasants.60 Let us go together under the vast galleries supported by those magnificent arcades.61 The ediies have preceded us; they are visiting the shops;63 it is the Forum Pistrinum, or bread-market.

121 SHELL FRUIT. Galen doubted whether pistachio nuts were good for the stomach.35 Avicenna proved the contrary ;30 and several centuries before the Arabian physician, Roman epicures had courageously demonstrated that this fruit never does harm in whatever form it may be presented, whether raw or roasted, alone or accompanied with garum and salt. CHESNUT TREE. According to some writers the chesnut tree owes its name to the city of Castana, in Thessaly, where they maintained it originated. On the contrary, it comes from Sardis, in Lydia, if we are to believe the physician, Diphilus, who calls chesnuts, acorns of Sardis, and says they are nourishing, but indigestible.37 Amaryllis was fond of this fruit ;38 but Amaryllis was only a shep- herdess, and her beauty did not prevent her from having rather rustic tastes. The Roman ladies abandoned the chesnut to that low class of citizens whose palates, incapable of improvement, remain always stationary in the midst of the incessant progress of cookery; sad example of invincible frugality, which the most excitmgfumets fail to arouse. Nevertheless, there was a soft and tender species of chesnut, Ccista- nece molles,39 which were allowed on some of the tables of the higher class of citizens, and recommended themselves by their delicate pulp to the attention of the guests ;40 perhaps oil of chesnuts was obtained from this particular kind.41 To render the chesnuts more agreeable and wholesome they must be pealed of their skins, which is very tough ; put into boiling water, it penetrates and softens the bitter pellicle (the tan) covering them, and facilitates its removal from the floury substance. When the chesnuts can be easily stripped of this pellicle by the pressure of the fingers, take the jar from the fire; shake them well on all sides. The tan will soon detach itself from their surface, and be altogether removed; then take them out, and after they have been shaken in a sieve made purposely, they are washed in cold water, to take away, with what remains of the tan, the bitter water they may have preserved; they are then cooked without water, in a well-covered vessel, and upon a moderate fire. i

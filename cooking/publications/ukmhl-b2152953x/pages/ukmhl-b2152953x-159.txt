SHELL FRUIT. 110 After the wedding feast the bridegroom strewed in the nuptial chamber, at night, several baskets of walnuts, which children hastened to pick up.16 This was, they said, a kind of offering to Jupiter, and thus he was entreated to grant his supreme patronage to the husband, and to adorn the wife with the virtues of Juno.17 The god could not have failed to smile at this part of the request of blind mortals, and it is asserted that, at times, he condescended not to grant it. Others have given a different interpretation. According to them, the walnut, being covered with a double envelope when fresh, became a presage of abundance and prosperity.18 It would be too tedious to relate all the singular opinions to which this ceremony gave rise. The most reasonable appears to be that adopted by certain commentators:—Walnuts, say they, served as play- things for children, and, by throwing them on the ground the day of his wedding, the bridegroom made it understood that he and his com- panion renounced the frivolities of youth, henceforth to devote them- selves to the serious exigencies of a family.19 This fruit was considered astringent,20 stomachic, and proper to facilitate digestion.21 It was made into preserve, and eaten in small quantity, mixed with figs. In this manner paralysis of the tongue was avoided—an effect to which it was believed those who partook of them to excess were exposed.22 Green walnuts were much esteemed; they were served at dessert,23 notwithstanding the opinion of Heraclides, of Tarentum, who looked upon them as a stimulant to the appetite, and advised a trial of them at the beginning of a repast.24 When Pompey had made himself master of the palace of Mithri- dates, he had search made everywhere for the recipe of the famous antidote against poison used by that king. At length it was found ; it was very simple: however, we offer it to the curious :— Pound, with care, two walnuts, two dried figs, twenty leaves of rue, and a grain of salt.25 Swallow this mixture — precipitate it by the assistance of a little wine, and you have nothing to fear from the most active poison for the space of twenty-four hours.

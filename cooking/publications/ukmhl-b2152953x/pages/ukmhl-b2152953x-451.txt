369 THE TABLE. first rank,13 and the prodigious skill of the workmen gave them a value superior to gold and silver.14 The most beautiful of these tables were spotted or veined to imitate the tiger’s or panther’s skin; but they acquired an exorbitant claim upon the admiration of connoisseurs when they bore the marvellous design of a peacock’s tail. This fantastic play of nature commanded a boundless price.13 An artist of unrivalled talent, Carvilius Pollio, was the first, according to Pliny,16 who enriched these magnificent woods with buhl-work of ivory and shell in the acme of perfection.17 Under the reign of Nero, the Romans dyed this shell, and thought to increase its primitive value by giving it tbe tints and accidental shades of the cedar, the maple, and the lemon tree.18 These splendid pieces of furniture were at first square;19 then round ;20 then in the form of a half-circle or half-moon, and this horse- shoe-shaped table they called a sigma, from the name of that Greek letter, which resembled our C.21 The guests whom any person wished to honour most were placed at the extremities of this hemicycle,22 overlaid with magnificent covers, which replaced the skins of beasts, formerly used for their adornment; and, in addition, they were spread with tissues of fine linen and rich stuffs elaborately worked.23 The tables were changed at each course.24 The Greeks cleaned them with sponge; the Latins used a sort of thick, plushed, linen cloth.26 The opulent citizens possessed a great number of tables; some were of ivory, others of maple wood, cedar of Mount Atlas,28 or lemon.29* Cicero had one of this latter kind of wood which cost him 200,000 ses- terces about £1,480.30 They rested on one, two, or three feet,31 and were called monopedes, bipedes, and tripedes. The Romans often changed tables only twice during the repast. Fish and flesh appeared on the first, and the fruit was served on the second. The same custom was common to the Greeks and the oriental nations. The Hebrews had also two tables in their solemn feasts and sacrificial banquets; on one was served the flesh of the victim, and on the other they placed the cup of benediction, which passed round from one to another, and was called “ the cup of praise.33 The luxury of Rome seemed to revive after she had become extinct. * This lemon-tree wood was a species more precious and more beautiful than that which we now possess.

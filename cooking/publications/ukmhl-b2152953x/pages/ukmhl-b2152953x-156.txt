PIP FRUIT. 11(5 beneath its modest foliage, but whose presence the scented air reveals- Transported to the tables of the Luculli, by the side of its more brilliant and more beautiful sister, a flattering murmur often bore testimony to its merit, and nature triumphed in the midst of ingenious guests, soliciting of art what they repudiated in nature.

Then, however, it hastened to repair lost time, and a single night was sufficient to see it display its beautiful flowers, which the next morning brightly opened at the rising of Aurora.72 The voluptuous Romans, reposing late on their soft couches the day after the fatigues of a banquet worthy of Yitellius, did not trouble themselves much about this interesting phenomenon, which occurred, if Pliny does not mistake, in the gardens of their villas. But they knew that mulberries agree with the stomach, that they afford hardly any nourishment, and easily digest:73 therefore, no sooner had they opened their heavy eyelids than an Egyptian boyâ€”attentive living bell at a sign disappeared, and quickly returned, bearing a small crystal vase, filled with mulberry juice and wine reduced by boiling.

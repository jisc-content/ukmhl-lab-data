XXXI. THE DINING-ROOM. The ccenaculum (dining-room), properly so called, was the place in the upper part of the house where they eat.1 It was reached by a staircase,* and thither persons repaired during the summer, particularly in the country. The Homan villas terminated by a platform, on which the Eomans often collected at meal-time; the air was not so hot, and the panorama of the neighbouring country-seats' was presented without obstruction, to the gaze of the guests.3 The dining-room was commonly decorated with fasces of arms and trophies,4 which served as a momento of the warlike virtues of the ancestors of the master of the house. Enchanting frescoes stood out marvellously from the obscure shading of the wall, round which were twined fresh garlands of flowers; and a mosaic floor—master-piece of art and patience—harmonised with the fascinating landscape of the ceiling, the site of which varied with every course.5 The Emperor Nero, who carried this taste for the beautiful rather too far, devised a sort of vault, in the most elegant style, and entirely composed of movable leaves of ivory, which exhaled sweet DESCRIPTION OF PLATENo. XXV. No, 1. Large vase, or cralerc: a vessel which was placed in the banqueting-room, and also on the empty spaco left on the tables. In it was put wine and water, which was taken out with a simpulum, a kind of small cup, fixed to a very long handle, bent at the extremity as a hook, to (ill the cups of the guests. When the cratirc* were not fixed on tripods (engytheca, or angothcca), which supported them, they only differed from the cups by their size. Some were of such dimensions that Herodotus speaks of two craleres, one containing 300 amphortc, and the other 600 ; these vases commonly ex- ceeded ten-fold the size of the cups, to which they were very similar in shape and handles. No. 2. A glass vase, with two handles, for iced water. No. 3. Glass bottle, with its cup, placed on the table for each guest. X 2

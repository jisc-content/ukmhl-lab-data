The poor con- tented themselves with cakes baked under the ashes.47 . Something remains to be said of windmills. We will say but little on the subject: this aerial mechanism—which the knight-errant, Don Quixote, of imperishable memory, thought it necessary to fight with sword and lance—was unknown before the Christian era in any nation whose writers have transmitted to us the least traces of their civi- lisation ; but nothing proves that windmills were unknown to others. This opinion seems to be well-founded, from a passage of the chronicler Winceslaus, who relates, in his ‘‘History of Bohemia,” that the first water- mill raised in that country was in the year of Christ 718, and that no other was in use before {anted) but mills built on the summit of mountains, which were put in motion by the wind.48 It appears, then, that there is some untruth in the assertion, that this sort of mill was introduced into Europe, about the year 1040, by the first Crusaders, on then' return from the East.49 At all events this question is no doubt very deserving the laborious search of the learned; it has but a secon- dary interest for the gastrophilist. It matters little to him whether he owes the grinding of his corn to the breath of a zephyr or to the slimy source of a river ; all he requires is good flour, because it enters into a great number of culinary preparations—and, first of all, bread is made from it.

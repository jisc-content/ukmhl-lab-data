DRINKING CUPS. 317 what is supposed, be true, that this miserable man was drunk every day, without fail, for three months together !5 Shall we mention Tiberius— surnamed by the army, Biberius (Tippler)—who, after he became Em- peror, passed the days and nights drinking with Flaccus and Piso, at the very time they were working at the reformation of the Romans ?° This pagan Solomon, having to choose from among several very distinguished candidates who offered themselves for the quaestorship, preferred the least known, because he had drunk a whole pitcher of wine, which the prince himself had condescended to fill.7 Intoxication, with the Greeks, was noted as belonging to low com- pany, if we are to judge by certain personages whom /Eschylus and Sophocles did not fear to bring on the stage, and who struck each other with vases—a thing which the modern theatre has judiciously banished.** Homer is more reserved ; for Achilles, after copious libations, only threw a neat’s foot at Ulysses’ head,9 which probably was not of much consequence. The fact is, that the ancients did not at all profess the same prin- ciples that we do respecting intemperance. Hippocrates himself, advised men to seek mirth now and then in wine ;10 Seneca recommends us to drown cares and fatigue in it ;n and Musseus decorates with crowns of flowers the foreheads of the sages who, sitting by the side of Plato at all new banquets, should find in continual drunkenness the sweetest reward for their virtues.12 A singular bliss, which only reason in de- lirium could have imagined. We have spoken of the delicious beverage which was so costly a seduction to choice epicureans, who took merit to themselves for not resisting it; for this reason, it was necessary to invent vessels worthy of containing it; and art, encouraged by luxury, produced those magnifi- cent vases of which ostentatious antiquity has only left us a faint idea. The cups of the Homeric times were all of equal capacity ; one of them was offered to each guest, but several were offerejl to persons of high distinction.13 The Greeks thought much of their cups; for them they were sacred relics from father to son, and were only used on certain solemnities. Ihus CEdipus delivers the most frightful imprecation against his son Polynices, who had presented, at a common repast, the cup of his an- cestors.14 ThatofNesto r was so large that a young man could hardly |can7 it; as to him, he lifted it up withofit the slightest difficulty.15

BEVERAGES. 305 only an instant in five pints of water. This liquor was left to get very old.37 Juice of quinces and honey, boiled in water, produced hydromelon, a delicious drink, which our century might envy the delicate drinkers of Athens and Rome,38 especially when roses had been added to this nectar, which changed it into hydrorosatum.M The apomeli was nothing more than water iu which honeycomb had been boiled.40 Omphacomeli, an ingenious mixture of honey and ver- juice, quenched thirst during the summer, and produced that agreeable gaiety which is to drunkenness what doziness is to sleep.41 A mixture of honey and juice of myrtle seed, of course diluted with water, composed myrtites, the aromatic flavour of which flattered the palate, and rendered the breath more sweet42 Sometimes pomegranates were substituted for the myrtle, and it was then called rhoites, and pos- sessed an agreeable and pungent flavour.43 Wine made of dates enjoyed a general esteem in the east. The Romans, who knew also how to appreciate it, prepared it by throwing into water some common, though very ripe, dates; and when they had well soaked, they were put under a press.44 The same means were employed to procure fig wine; but often the sediment of grapes was used instead of water, to prevent its being too sweet.45 “ Artificial wines” were also procured by the aid of several other kinds of fruits, such as sorbs, medlars, and mulberries.40 Fermentation dispelled the sweet and insipid flavour which generally distinguishes these fruits ; and, at the commencement of a repast, the guests swallowed with delight large cups of these beverages.47 It was also the custom to serve very cold water, in which certain plants had been infused, and which was freshened by being surrounded with snow after it had been boiled for some time. The invention of this iced water is attributed to the Emperor Nero, who made great use of it; and who appears to have bitterly regretted it when, dethroned and flying from his assassins, he was constrained through excessive thirst to drink muddy water from a ditch. The unfortunate Caesar then, for the first time, thought of the strange vicissitudes of fortune, and casting a sor- rowful glance at the disgusting fluid he held in his hand, “ Alas!” he exclaimed, with a sigh, “is this the iced water that Nero drank ?”48

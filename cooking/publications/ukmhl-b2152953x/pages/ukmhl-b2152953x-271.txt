22a FISH. the fish—since there was none large enough ready-made—and also that a stove should be constructed vast enough to allow the dish to be placed oommodiously upon it.98 The emperor, the city, and the court applauded the profound wisdom of this decision ; and “ le turbot fat mis a la sauce piquante. Aristotle does not mention this fish ; but his compatriots esteemed highly the turbots of Attica.100 O J TUNNY. The Greeks greatly praised the tunny fish of Pachynum.101 Persons who prided themselves on their knowledge in the art of good living, eat only the belly part,102 and never touched the remainder. The Synopians formerly gained immense sums by the tunny fishery along their shores,103 the effigy of which, perhaps in gratitude, they stamped on their money. This fish came from Palus Meotides, and passed thence to Trebizond and Pharnacia, whence it followed the coast of Sinopus, and, at length, reached Byzantium, where they took nearly all those which escaped the fisheries of the two first-named stations.104 The Romans offered tunny fish in sacrifice to Neptune, in order that that god might deign to prevent the xiphias fish from tearing their nets, * and forbid the too officious dolphins to assist in their escape.105 They sold it at a very good price during the autumn and winter; but it fetched less in summer because it was thought to be unwholesome during that season.106 The jole and belly were thought the most delicate parts.107 They were either fried or boiled, with pepper, alisander, cummin, onion, mint, sage, and dates, to which was added a mixture of honey, vinegar, oil, and mustard.108 Archestratus, who, on account of his gastronomic voyages, was looked upon as a high authority, asserts that Sicily and the neighbourhood of Constantinople furnished excellent tunny fish; but that the best were those from Samos.109 These latter were much renowned among the Greeks, who carefully prepared the entrails, and feasted on this dish. Athenseus relates, on this subject, a witticism of the poet Dorio, a keen and caustic spirit of the period of Aristotle and Philip of Macedon. Being

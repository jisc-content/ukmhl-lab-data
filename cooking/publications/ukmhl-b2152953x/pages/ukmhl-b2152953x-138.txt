STONE FRUIT. 98 Tims the most important culture among the Jews was that of the olive tree. There were large plantations of it in all the provinces: Galilea, Samaria, and Judea, were full of them.17 It must not, however, be thought the Hebrews used olives only to make oil; they knew how to preserve them in brine, to be eaten at table, and for sale to strangers. Pliny particularly extols those of Decapolis, a province of the Holy Land : “ They are very small," he says, “ not larger than capers; but are much esteemed.”18 Among the Greeks, the oil of Samos was considered to be the purest and finest:19 next to it they gave preference to that of Caria or of Thurium.10 As regards olives, the Colymbades, or floating kinds were more esteemed than any other, on account of their size and taste ;21 they had an exquisite flavour imparted to them by being placed with different herbs in pots of oil :22 the Halmade olives were preserved in brine.*3 The cultivation of the olive tree was carried to a great extent in Greece; a host of poets sang in honour of this tree,21 which produced so sweet a fruit; and Theophrastus speaks of it very frequently in his celebrated treatise on plants.2'1 The Romans were not acquainted with it until later; and even in the year 249 b.c., they possessed so few olive trees that a pound of oil sold for twelve As, or three shillings; less than two centuries after (74 b.c.), ten pounds of it only cost one As; but Italy had so far increased its plantations at the end of a few years (52 b. c.) that it was able to furnish olive trees to the neighbouring countries.26 Its olives and oil were thought excellent; however, those of Grenada and Andalusia were preferred to them, even in the time of Pliny,27 on account of then" sweet- ness and delicate flavour. That illustrious naturalist has transmitted to us particulars of the highest interest on the cultivation of the olhe tree, and the various preparations which its fruit requires, or rather, to which it is necessarily subjected for the luxury of the table. Those who are curious on this subject may also consult Cato (the first among the Romans who has written on this tree),29 Varro,30 and Columella, concerning the art of raising the plants, of gathering the olives, of extracting the oil, and of preserving the olives themselves. This lattei operation was performed as follows:— They took twenty-five pounds of olives, six pounds of quick-lime, broken very small and dissolved in water, to which twelve pounds of oak

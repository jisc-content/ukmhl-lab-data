For some dishes thick slices are required, thin for stews, dice for curry, and the smallest scraps can be minced for scallops, rissoles, potted meats, and other made- dishes. The style of cooking must depend on the kind and quantity of meat to be used. All firm, white fat, that is not otherwise required, may be finely chopped, and used as suet in plain puddings, forcemeats, and rissoles. The coarser parts of fat and dripping should be cut small, nearly covered with cold water, and boiled till the fat is extracted from the skin which surrounds each globule; the clear liquid must then be pressed out, and strained into a vessel, and kept for frying purposes. This is called clarified or frying fat. The bones, skin, gristle, and coarse trimmings of the meat should be chopped and cut small, covered with cold water, flavoured with onion, carrot, celery, &c., with spice and salt, and gently simmered for some hours; game and chicken bones re- quire less time than the heavier bones of beef and mutton.

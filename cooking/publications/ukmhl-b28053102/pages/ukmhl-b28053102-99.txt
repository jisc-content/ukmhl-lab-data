The bones should be removed while hot, and the meat put on a dish so that it may be properly dressed when cold. It may be served cold with a sharp, savoury sauce, or with ravigote sauce. To Warm.—Immediately before serving warm the meat in a little hot stock, and serve the sauce separately. Parsley and butter, oyster, piquante, tomato, or Dutch sauce are excellent with calf’s feet. 2. Calf’s Feet Fritters in Sauce. Ingredients.—Calf’s feet (from making jelly), batter, frying-fat, tomato sauce. Method.—When making calf’s foot jelly, while the calf’s feet are still firm drain them from the stock, split open, remove the bones, and press the meat between two plates. When cold, cut into neat pieces, dip in batter, fry a pale brown; drain them well, and arrange them on a hot dish with tomato sauce or puree poured round. Serve hot.

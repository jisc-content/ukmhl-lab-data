The following recipes will be useful for serving with hot or cold meat, poultry, game, vegetables, or grills. For hashes, the sauce should be well boiled, and allowed to get almost cold, before the meat is put into it. After this it must slowly be made very hot, but must not boil’ or the meat will be hardened beyond repair. Ordinary sauces, prepared on the quick system, should be allowed to boil ten minutes from the time the liquid is added. When a sauce is cooked less than ten minutes the flour will not have had time to develop its flavour properly. It sometimes happens that by some error a sauce is cooked so long that it becomes oily. In this case a little cold stock, cold milk, or water should be added; and if the sauce is stirred until it begins to boil, it will again become perfectly smooth. It must not on any account be allowed to cook any longer, but should be removed from the fire the moment it boils. Chaudfroid sauces are used for coating cooked cold meat, fish, game, and poultry. Several excellent recipes for these are given hereafter, which cannot fail to be useful for pretty luncheon, summer entrees, or supper parties.

Carolina rice, 4 oz. butter, stock, minced meat. Method.—Melt the butter in a stewpan, then add the well- washed rice, a little salt, and enough well-flavoured jellied stock to cover the rice; cook slow, and stir frequently till tender, adding more stock if required. Then whisk till smooth and creamy, and spread on a clean dish. When cool, butter a plain mould and line it with the rice to one-inch depth; leave till firm, fill up with a highly-flavoured mince moistened with stock or milk, cover with buttered paper, steam for one hour.

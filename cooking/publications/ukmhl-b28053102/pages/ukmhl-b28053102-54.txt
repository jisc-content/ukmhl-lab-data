Tomatoes in Aspic. Ingredients.—Ripe tomatoes, anchovies, mayonnaise sauce, aspic jelly, garnish. Method.—Select very small round tomatoes, skin them, and carefully take out the centres. Wash, skin, fillet, and chop two or three anchovies finely, and mix with a gill of thick mayonnaise sauce. Fill the cavities in each tomato with this, lay on it a sprig of chervil, and cover each tomato two or three times with aspic jelly so as to be quite coated. Pour the jelly over with a spoon, and let it be quite cool. Arrange a very fine wreath of cress or parsley round the edge of a dish, place the tomatoes in the centre, and serve.

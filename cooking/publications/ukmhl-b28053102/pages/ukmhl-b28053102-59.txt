Ingredients.—Remains of roast or boiled fowls with their stuffing, sausage meat or a little lean ham, 1 onion (chopped), 1 gill milk, bread crumbs, fresh eggs, seasoning. Method.—Stew the bones in a little water for an hour to make stock; strain, add the milk, and thicken with butter and flour in the usual way; boil up and season. Butter a pie dish, sprinkle with bread crumbs and the crumbled stuffing, moisten the minced chicken with the sauce, strew very fine bread crumbs over, and place the eggs, broken as for poaching, carefully over the surface. Sprinkle with pepper, salt, bread crumbs, and dis- solved butter, and bake at once in a quick oven till the eggs begin to bubble and smoke; the whites should be set and the yolks soft.

When a ham is getting low in cut, with a little management not a bit need be wasted; not even the bone, which will be a valuable addition to the stock-pot, or which will make an ex- cellent foundation of stock for vegetable soups, such as pea soup, haricot bean, or mixed vegetable purees. If the ham is fat, some slices of it may be lightly fried as rashers, and will be quite as good as those made of uncooked bacon to use with boiled fowls, poached eggs, liver and bacon, or with mushrooms or tomatoes. The next part that cannot be cut into slices may be used for the seasoning of galantines of veal or chicken, for mixing with minced beef for sausages, or if cut in thin shreds, for veal and ham pie, veal mould, or for the foundation of mulligatawny soup. The dry ham, when grated and served for breakfast, will be found a most appetising relish to bread or toast and butter, and the moister parts of the lean are perfect treasures to a cook in pro- ducing savoury dishes. The ham for these is generally required to be finely chopped, and to prevent shreds it should be cut across the grain in slices. All skin and dark parts should be removed previous to chopping. For this reason a knife chops ham better than a mincing machine, which is apt to tear and mash it instead of chopping it finely. 2. Minced Ham.

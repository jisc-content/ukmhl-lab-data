60 SALADS, SANDWICHES, &c. of a i^iut of good espagnole and a spoonful or two of sherry. Butter some small water biscuits thickly, dust them generously with pepi^er, black and red, and broil them, then pile a spoonful of the mixture on each, dust with coralline i^ei^per and freshly grated Parmesan cheese, and serve very hot. Anchois en Surprise.—Cut a round off ten or twelve tiny dinner rolls (the halfpenny size), and scoop out all the crumb. Meanwhile mix together three finely chopped, hard-boiled eggs, the well-washed and boned fillets of ten or twelve anchovies, a teaspoonful each of minced tarragon, chives, and chervil, three good spoonfuls of salad oil, and a liberal seasoning of coralline pepper. When this is all well mixed, fill the rolls with it, replace the pieces cut off, pressing them well home, and serve. If you have aspic handy, fasten on these tops with a little liquid aspic, brushing them well over with the same, and dust thickly with minced parsley and coralline pepper. Sardines d la Maitre d’hotel.—First cleanse the fish thus : Lift them out singly on to a dish, tip the dish lightly, and pour over the sardines enough hot water to rinse them well, letting this drain off the dish at the bottom; then wipe the sardines dry, removing the skin as you wipe them. (All tinned fish is improved by this treatment.) Lay the fish on fingers of hot buttered toast, and leave them in the oven till hot. Meanwhile stir into a gill of good white sauce a dessertspoonful each of minced parsley and chives (or shallot), and let it all boil up, then add a spoonful of lemon juice or of chilli vinegar

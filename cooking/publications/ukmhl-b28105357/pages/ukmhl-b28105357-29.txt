FANCY SALADS. 17 Salade Suedoise.—For this toss together pickled herring freed from skin and bone, and trimmed into fillets, cold roast or stewed beef, cold boiled potatoes, and sour apples, all chopped roughly, with capers and sliced French gherkins; seasoning it with a plain oil and vinegar dressing, and garnishing it with stoned olives, filleted anchovies, and shreds of red chiUies. Another variation of this consists of a macedoine of vegetables mixed with cold potato sliced, sliced beetroot, and cold sausage, garnished as above, and served with a ravigote sauce—i.e., a mayonnaise to which you have added a little extra tarragon vinegar, a spoonful of cream, together with some chopped parsley, cress, and tarragon, with a drop or two of vegetable green colouring, to bring it all to a pale apple green. Be careful not to overdo this colouring. Salade Flamande.—For this you trim some good bloaters, removing all bone and skin; slice down some sour apples, beetroot, cold cooked potatoes, Brussels sprouts, cardoons, or seakale (according to what you have), and some cauliflower, and toss in an oil or vinegar salad dressing, and serve garnished with the filleted bloaters. Some persons use sliced Hamburg beef instead of, or together with, the bloaters. Watercress and Apple Salad (French).—Well wash, pick over, and dry some nice fresh watercress and mix it with rather more than half its bulk of good, sharp, and very thinly sliced apples; toss in a French salad dressing, or in mayonnaise, as you please, and serve with either hot or cold roast beef. c

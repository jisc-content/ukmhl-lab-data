SANDWICHES. 35 George Sandwich.—Stamp out rounds of brown or white bread and butter, and sj)read these with white mayonnaise (i.e., mayonnaise made with egg white, lemon juice, and cream, instead of oil, vinegar, and egg yolk), and cover this with shredded chicken and ham or tongue, dusting this again with minced olives, then cover with the rest of the bread, and finish off as usual. Greville Sandwich.—Stamp out the bread and butter as in the j)receding recipe, and spread these rounds with pounded or minced game mixed with capers and tiny fillets of anchovy; press them together, and then mask half with broWn and half with white chaufroix and serve when set, garnished with watercress. This decoration can manifestly be applied to all small sandwiches, as can also the practice of brushing the upper side with just liquid aspic and dusting it with lobster coral, coralline pepper, minced parsley, olives, &c., setting these with a drop or two more of aspic jelly. Lobster Sandwich.—Prepare some red or lobster butter by crushing the shell and feelers of a cooked lobster with an ounce or two of butter, till you get it all to a fine paste, adding gradually the coral if at hand, with a good seasoning of salt and coralline pepper, and gradually 2oz. more of butter. Then stir this over a slow fire till it reddens and clears, when you rub it through a fine hair sieve into iced water, on the surface of which it hardens. Now skim it off, melt it again in a warm basin, and work into it four more ounces of fresh butter, and leave it in a cold larder till firm and well coloured. This D 2

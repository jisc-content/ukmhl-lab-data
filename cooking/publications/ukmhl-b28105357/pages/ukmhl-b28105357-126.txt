114 SALADS. SANDWICHES, &c. is to be avoided, but it comes in very usefully iu the present instance. Another very good colouring (which would answer admirably for the brown sauce given above) is made by toasting a slice of bread till it is as dark a brown as you can get it without actually letting it burn. It is then put into either cold or hot water, and allowed to steep until the, water is sufficiently coloured. This browning is also often used to colour soups, either of meat, fish, or vegetable stock. Of course, these sauces are simply for decorative purposes; where the croutons are small, and, though used for garnish, are actually to be eaten, the best sauces must, of course be used. Anyway, whatever sauce you use, do not colour them artificially. Next to croutons comes jelly. Now, of this there are two kinds—meat jelly and aspic jelly. This latter has been so fully dealt with in No. IV. of the “ Queen ” Cookery Books (on “ Entrees ”) that no more need be said here. But remember, that though the ordinary aspic, made without stock, will answer admirably for socles or stands, if it is to be eaten care must be bestowed on its flavour as well as on its clearness. Again, aspic, by reason , of its necessary acidity, is not always suitable, and in many cases dishes are actually spoilt by this tart- ness. In this case it is better to prepare the jelly thus : Put into a pan a quart of any bght stock to taste, according to the colour you wish your jelly to be {Consomme Maggi dissolved in water according to its accompanying directions makes a most praise- worthy foundation for savoury jeHy), a good bunch.

6 SALADS, SANDWICHES, etc. with slices of ham or tongue and foie gras, but these belong to a version more correctly known as salade d VItalienne, in which chicken, ham, or tongue, crayfish,, and last, but not least, mayonnaise play important parts, but the method of making is precisely the same. Salade de Homard en Aspic.—Shce down the body of a good lobster neatly; have ready some stiff aspic jelly made with delicately clarified fish stock for choice, and pour this into a border mould in a quarter inch layer; when this is stiff, but not quite hard, lay in the pieces of lobster in a circle, with alternate slices of cucumber and leaves of tarrao’on, then pour in enough aspic to fill up the mould, and put it away to set. Break up one or more nicely washed and dried lettuce, and mix it with the trimmings of the lobster (reserving the claws), cut up fine ; then when the mould is set turn it out, pile up the lettuce, &c., well mixed with good mayonnaise, in the centre, and garnish with the reserved pieces of lobster, sliced cucumber, plovers’ eggs, or hard- boiled hens’ eggs (choose small ones) quartered, sliced tomato, &c., according to what you have handy. This can manifestly be varied to taste, and is especially good made of cold fish, and shrimj^s, or prawns. Bemember in making mayonnaise for fish salads that, though hardly correct, a teaspoonful of Burgess’s essence of anchovy is a great addition to each half pint of mayonnaise, as it brings out the full flavour of the fish, though it should never be sii£S.cient to be actually detected as a sejsarate flavour.

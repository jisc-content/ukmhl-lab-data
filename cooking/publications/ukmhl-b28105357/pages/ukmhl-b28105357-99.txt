SAYOURIES. 87 old-fasliioned clieese-toasters with an outer dish containing boiling water is needed, though the modern chafing dish will also answer. Slice down some good rich cheese pretty thinly, and lay it in the hot-water dish, with (if at all dry) some morsels of butter; add two or three spoonfuls of porter or good ale (according to the quantity of cheese), some freshly ground black pepper, with sufficient made mustard to flavour it well, and stir it till it is all thoroughly melted. Send to table at once in the hot-water dish (in old days this dish was always made in the dining-room) with crisp hot toast. This dish varies according to taste ; some people dip the thick buttered toast into the beer, melting the cheese with a spoonful or two of cream or new milk, and pouring it when ready on to the toast; others again omit the ale altogether, being content with milk and a dash of celery salt, browning the surface with a salamander, and serving it on rather soft, freshly made buttered toast. Of course this can be cooked quite as well in a saucepan, but requires watching, as if the least overcooked it is leathery, If cooked thus, and poured on to lightly buttered toast, seasoned with coralline or Nepal pepper, and the surface browned, it is often called “ Welsh Rabbit (or Rarebit”), whilst if, when made in this wav, a drop or two of vinegar and a minced pickled o-herkin are added at the last, it is known as “ Irish Rarebit.” Many people again add the yolk of one or more eggs to the mixture and call the dish “ Golden Buck,” The real toasted cheese, however, should be slices of cheese really toasted in front of the fire

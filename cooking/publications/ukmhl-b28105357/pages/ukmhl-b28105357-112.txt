100 SALADS, SANDWICHES, &c. quite hot (but do not actually cook it again), then pour it on to hot buttered toast and serve. The secret in making this toast is to vary the flavourings nicely, using minced parsley, chives, lemon juice, etc. German Toast.—Mince finely the remains of any nice fricassee, or ragout, with a little parsley, chives, or shallot, pepper and salt. Mix this with one or more egg yolks, add the gravy belonging to the dish, and stir it all over the fire till thick, then turn it out and leave till cold. Now pile it up on buttered toast, and either brush it over with egg and strew it with crumbs, or cover it with the white of the egg used (whipped to a stiff froth, and seasoned with minced parsley and coralhne pepper), and set it in the oven till quite hot and nicely coloured. A few drops of lemon juice should be squeezed over it at the last. Any remains of a casserole are excellent served thus, but should be highly seasoned, Curmj Toast.—Well wash, bone, and pound 4oz, of anchovies with a little curry powder or paste, mustard, butter, and a few drops of vinegar ; spread this on hot buttered toast, place in the oven till hot, and seiwe at once. Any highly flavoured meat is good rechauffe thus. Bombay Toast.—Melt a square inch of butter and stir into it two eggs, a quarter of a teaspoonful of cayenne, and a few drops of essence of anchovy; spread this on buttered toast and serve very hot. Any strongly flavoured sauce to taste may be used instead of the anchovy. Marrow Toast.—Break two good marrow bones

96 SALADS, SANDWICHES, &c. Now mix together 2oz. of fine flour, 3oz. of grated Parmesan cheese, 2|oz, of butter, a good pinch each of coralline pepper and salt, the yolks of four raw eggs, and rather more than half a j^int of cold milk ; stir this all over the fii’e till on the point of boiling (if it does boil the eggs will curdle), then Kft it off, let it cool, when you stir in lightly a gill of stiffly whipped cream and two tablespoonfuls of minced prawns, shrimps, or lobster, and fill the cornets with the mixture. Place a curled-up prawn or shrimj) in the mouth of the cornet, and serve. The cornets may be left plain, or lightly brushed over with just liquid aspic, and dusted with coralline pepper and minced parsley. If you j>repare a mousseline sauce by adding a gill of richly coloured tomato mayon- naise to a gill of stiffly whipped and seasoned cream, and the same of whipped asj)ic, incorporating into this a tablespoonful of small dice of Gruym*e cheese, and the same of dice of cucumber, and fill the cornets with this, you have Cornets ^ la Maximilian, the contents of which should always be iced. Cheese Savoury.—Mix well together over a clear fire a dessertspoonful of mustard, a wineglassful of vinegar (that from walnut pickle is nicest), a dessertspoonful of essence of anchovy, a small j)iece of butter, and black, white, and red pepper to taste. When this is well mixed and hot, stir in 4oz. of finely broken-up cheese, and directly this is melted pour the mixture on to very hot toast, and serve at once. If care is not taken about adding the cheese only at the last, and serving it directly it is melted, this toast will be utterly spoilt and indigestible.

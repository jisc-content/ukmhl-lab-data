46 SALADS, SANDWICHES, &c. can be filled with any of the preceding, or with miniature salads of capers, sliced cucumber, tomato, :anchovy fillets, flaked, smoked, or fresh fish, shrimps, &c,, mixed with oil and vinegar or mayonnaise to taste. A pretty variant of the popular salade ■d'anchois can be made by filleting some anchovies, arranging two fillets crosswise in each case, putting little heaps of minced egg, white and yolk, parsley, .and coralline pepper in between, seasoning it all with oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Or soak two salted herrings with roes, in milk and water as above, then fillet them, and rub the roes through a sieve; now peel, core, and mince a sour apple, mixing this mince with the sieved roe. Have ready some buttered slices of bread, spread them with the mince, cover half of these with the fillets of fish, freed from all skin, &c., and cover with the rest of the prepared slices. Press well together and trim neatly. Or, fill any of these cases with minced gherkin, whole capers, minced tarragon, and either prawns or shrimps, or, if liked, lobster. Mix this all with a spoonful or so of mayonnaise, pile it up, and .serve garnished with chopped aspic. This can be varied to taste.

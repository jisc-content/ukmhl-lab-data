Mayonnaise de Saumon a la JocJcey Club.—Take any remains of cold salmon and flake it neatly free from bones, skin, &c. Line a border mould with aspic, then fill it with the flaked salmon, some capers, anchovy fillets, and white mayonnaise, and leave till set. Turn out, place a crown of plovers’ eggs round the top of the border mould, fixing them with chopped aspic by means of a bag and pipe, and fill up the centre with cooked asparagus points, new potatoes, and truffles sliced and seasoned with oil, vinegar, salt, and white pepper. A very nice and certainly more economical version of this is made by filling the centre with cold cooked new potatoes tossed in oil and vinegar, and sprinkled with minced parsley and chives, garnishing the top of the mould with tomato cups, prepared thus : Choose small round tomatoes, cut a round off each, and scoop out the pulp and seeds with a spoon, keeping the skin as whole and well shaped as you can, and leave the latter on ice till wanted. Now mix the pulp and the juice thus obtained with shred salmon (lobster, crab, shrimps, or anything handy of the kind), seasoning it lightly with coralline pepper, salt, and aspic jelly, allowing a spoonful of aspic for each tomato.

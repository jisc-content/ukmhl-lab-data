SAVOURIES. 57 and. pepjDer to taste. Have ready some square biscuits made with Bombay duck pastry, or devil pastry, as preferred, and spread these thickly with the mixture, smoothing them with a warm, wet knife ; then lay on each a small round of hard-boiled egg white, and place on this a turned olive farced with whipped cream seasoned with coralline pepper. Anchois en Canots a la Mayonnaise.—Line some little boat moulds with either puff:, cheese, or anchovy pastry, as you please; prick, and bake till crisp. Mince together five or six anchovies (washed and boned), one hard-boiled egg, three or four stoned olives, a small teaspoonful of capers, add enough good mayonnaise (tartare, verte, tomato, Ac.) sauce to mix it, pile up pretty high in the canots, and serve. Anchois a la Moderne.—Wash, split, and bone some good anchovies, and roll up each half, brushing each over with strong aspic to set it. Spread, some squares of fried bread or anchovy biscuits with watercress butter, place an anchovy fillet on each, curling round this a prawn split in half lengthways, and seasoned with oil and vinegar, with a tiny rose of anchovy cream, whipped cream, or creamed butter -flavoured with anchovy and coralline jDepper, on top of the rolled fillets. It must be remembered that these recipes are really means of using up scraps. For instance, for eight of these you need only four anchovies, four j^rawns, any scrap of asj)ic jelly, &c. It is on utilising these sorts of scraps, individually useless, that the success and economy of savouries depends.

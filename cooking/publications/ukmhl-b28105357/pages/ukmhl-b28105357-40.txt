SALADS, SANDWICHES, &c. 28 Sandwich).—Pound together 4oz. minced cooked chicken, 2oz. ham or tongue (freed from skin, &c.), loz. creamed butter, two tablespoonfuls of veloute sauce, and four to six tablespoonfuls of freshly- made white breadcrumbs. Dust a pastry board with breadcrumbs, lay on it a little heap of the mince, and pat it out with a palette knife dipped in hot water into oblongs 2|in, long by If in. wide. Trim the edges carefully, slip the knife under, and roll it carefully as you lift. If too moist to roll, add more crumbs ; if too dry, it will break, and must be moistened with a little more sauce. Success depends entirely on the consistency. Serve with mustard and cress. These sandwiches can be made in a variety of ways ; for instance, use game instead of chicken, with ham, espagnole or game sauce, and brown breadcrumbs; or white fish with bechamel and minced parsley, flavouring the bechamel with a drop - \ or two of essence of anchovy ; or lobster, prawns, or salmon, with cardinale or aurore sauce, using in both cases white breadcrumbs ; or, lastly, green or maitre d’hotel butter rubbed up with one hard-boiled egg yolk for every 3oz. or 4oz. of the butter, and either white or brown crumbs. Alexandra Sandwich.—Mince finely two parts chicken or game to one part tongue or ham, and one part minced cooked mushrooms or truffles. (With game, especially the brown-fleshed varieties, mush- rooms are always an improvement.) Melt loz. of glaze and a leaf or two of best gelatine in some good brown sauce, and stir into it over the fire the prepared mince, stirring it steadily till quite hot.

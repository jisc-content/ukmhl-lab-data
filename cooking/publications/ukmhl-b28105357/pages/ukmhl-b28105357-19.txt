7 FANCT SALADS. The same remark applies to the mayonnaise sauce for one of the nicest American salads, chicken and salsify salad, as the anchovy brings out strongly the oyster flavour' of the salsify, which for this salad should be cooked and allowed to get cold before use. If for this you use scorzanera, or black salsify—the one most used in America—be sure you impress on your cook the necessity of not peeling it before it is cooked, as, if peeled first, it “ sweats,” just as beetroot does, and loses most of its moisture and flavour. All salads, American ones especially, should always stand on ice or in some very cold place till wanted, and when dished the salad basin or dish should be placed in an outer dish full of cracked or broken up ice. Special dishes are made for this purpose. Scallops again, when in season, offer a welcome variety from, prawns or lobster, and make a particularly good and unconventional salad. Steep the fish for an hour in salted water, then rinse in plenty of cold water and simmer them gently for twenty-five minutes. When cooked plunge the scallops into cold water, drain well, and shce them. Have ready crisped and shred a nice head of celery, arrange this in a dish, put the scallops on top, then cover it' all with white mayonnaise, and serve garnished w^th sliced tomato, cucumber, and tiny celery tufts.

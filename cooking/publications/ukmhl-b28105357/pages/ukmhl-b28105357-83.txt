71 SAVOURIES. Savoury Herring Roes.—Take six good soft (fresh) herring roes, well wash them, and lay them in a pan with loz. of butter and a little salt and pepper, and cook them for six or eight minutes under a buttered paper; then a,rrange on fingers of buttered toast or finger croiitons, season with a drop or two of lemon juice, coralline pepper, and a drop of essence of anchovy, and set in the oven till quite hot. Tinned herring roes may be used in the same way, but naturally do not require the first cooking. Laitances au Gratin.—Cook some soft roes as above, have ready some little paper cases j)reviously oiled and dried, put a layer of d’Uxelle mixture in each, then a herring roe, either straight or curled, put a spoonful of rich espagnole (or tomato) sauce into each case, dust with bread-crumbs, and set in the oven till nicely browned. A plainer method of doing this is to lay a cooked roe in each case, season with pepper and salt, grated bread, and minced parsley, with a morsel of butter on each, and bake till the crumbs are browned; then serve with a tiny pat of maitre d’hotel butter on each. This is known as laitances gratines a la maitre d’hotel. Laitances en Papillotes.— Oil some heart-shaped pieces of paper, lay a little d’Uxelle mixture on each, with a spoonful of rather thick tomato sauce, and on this a well washed but uncooked roe, fold the paper, pinching the edges well together, and bake or broil till the paper puffs out. Laitances d la Liable.—Season some well-washed roes with salt, lemon juice, cayenne, and if liked a di’op or two of Tabasco, and cook till nearly crisp in

GARNISHES, &c. 121 Tabasco, fill up the bottle with fresh tarragon vinegar, and cork tightly. This, like anchovy vinegar, is excellent, not only for salads, but for savouries, and especially for broiled fish, steak, &c. Of Mustards, again, there are a great variety, and a pleasant change may be made by mixing the mustard smoothly with any spiced or flavoured vinegar to taste; or again, boil about half a tea- spoonful each of salt, freshly ground black pepper, mace, cloves, and a dash of cayenne, with a small ■clove of garlic, in half a pint of good vinegar till this is strongly flavoured ; mix 4oz. or 5oz. of mustard to a stiff paste with some cold tarragon vinegar, then strain into it gradually the boiling-hot spiced vinegar, stirring it as you do so with a small red-hot poker, or kitchen skewer. This mustard, if stored in wide-mouthed bottles, and tightly corked, will keep for years. Salt also needs attention. Perhaps the nicest in many ways is the well-known Cerebos salt, as it never cakes, but a very nice salt for home con- simiption can be produced by sifting together a teaspoonful of best cornflour, or of creme de riz, and a teacupful of finely powdered salt. This must be kept in a dry sjjot. Croutes and Croutons.—Of these there are various kinds. The large kind used as a socle, or support, has already been described, but the small croutes or croutons used for garnish or savouries should be prepared thus : Slice down some stale bread about one-third to half an inch thick, remove all crust, and cut or stamp out these slices into triangles, hearts.

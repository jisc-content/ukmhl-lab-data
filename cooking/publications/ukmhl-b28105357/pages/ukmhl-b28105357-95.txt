83 SAVOURIES. layer of this at the bottom of a papered souffle mould, put aside an equal quantity of the whipped aspic, and mix the rest with the prepared crab, fill up the mould with this, and finally pile the rest of the aspic on the top and set it all on ice or in the charged ice cave till thoroughly frozen. These may give some idea of the variety of savouries that may be prepared from fish, though naturally the list is more than imperfect. It is well to remember that home-potted fish (or, indeed, many other things) adds immensely to the number of savouries that may be prepared at little, if any, cost. Eor instance, pick the flesh free from skin and bones from two broiled fresh herrings, and pound it till smooth with a quarter part of its bulk of fresh butter and a seasoning of pepper (black and red), a very little salt, and an atom of mace. When perfectly smooth press it into pots, and if a little clarified butter is run over it, it will keep for some time. Any fish, especially kippers, bloaters, Finnon had- dock, smoked or fresh salmon, or cod’s roe, lobster, Ac., may be prepared thus. Shrimps make par- ticularly good paste, as do also canned lobster or salmon, especially if a little anchovy paste or a well- washed and boned fillet or so of anchovy be pounded with every ;|lb. of fish. It is difficult to give exact quantities, as the mixture depends largely on personal taste. Bloater Grilled.—Split the fish and grill it over a clear fire, cooking the skin side first, and then the inside, for five to eight minutes, and serve dry or with a tiny pat of butter on it. G 2

SALADS, SANDWICHES, &c. 110 pretty thick. When cold this is used as before, but cover each layer with either tomato puree, good sauce, or strong beef gravy, as you please, instead of cheese, etc. Or again, the porridge can be prepared as in the first recipe, then season the layers with grated cheese, minced parsley, coralline pepj)er, and thick cream, and bake as before. A less delicate, but quite as nutritious, dish can be prepared with Indian cornmeal in exactly the same way, and is the famous polenta of Southern Italy, served in so many ways. The above will give some idea of the enormous variety of savouries which an inteJligent and willing cook can evolve (all of which, I may observe, have been prepared by, nominally, the plainest of plain cooks, who had no idea of the society names of the dishes she sent up, or she would have struck at once!) ; but naturally, in a book of this size, it is impossible to do more than give samples, for one might fill several books with nothing but savouries, and yet leave a large aftermath for subsequent collectors.

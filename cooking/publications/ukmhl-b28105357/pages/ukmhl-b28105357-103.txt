Some cooks twist every sixth stick or so into a ring,, and when baked pass four or five of the straight sticks through it, serving one of these little faggots for each guest. Cheese Balls (Meringues au Parmesan).—Whisk the whites of two eggs to a froth, then stir in lightly 2oz. of grated Parmesan cheese (mind it is rather dry), with salt and cayenne to taste. Shape this mixture into balls the size of a marble, and drop them into a panful of boiling fat. Fry for about five minutes till crisp and of a golden colour, then drain and serve dusted with grated cheese and cayenne.

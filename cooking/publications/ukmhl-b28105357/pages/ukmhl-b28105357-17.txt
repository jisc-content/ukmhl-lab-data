5 FANCY SALADS. and is consequently most useful for picnics. Still, it wants somewhat of the delicacy of an absolutely freshly made mayonnaise. Salade tl la Russe.—This is made with a macedoine of cold cooked vegetables cut into neat pieces, or into olive or marble shapes, and the greater the variety the better. Asparagus points, green peas, cauli- flowers broken up small, sliced beetroot, turned (i.e., cut into balls) carrots and turnips, haricot or flageolet beans, all come in (in winter bottled or canned vegetables answer capitally if care be taken to choose a good brand). When these are all cold, drain them well, and toss them in the oil and vinegar dressing given above, with (for a teacupful of each of the vegetables mentioned) about two tablespoonfuls of French capers, the same of French gherkins cut into dice, and the same of washed, boned, and filleted anchovies, together with eighteen or twenty stoned olives (some cooks omit the ancho- vies, using the olives sold ready stuffed with anchovy in their stead); and lastly a couple of spoonfuls of minced tarragon and chervil, and a dessertspoonful of very finely minced chives or shallot. When these are all well mixed in, turn it into the salad bowl and then garnish it with quartered ha.d-boiled eggs (or plovers’ eggs if in season), little heaps of caviar, timny (pickled), lobster, and small fillets of cold fish, &c. This is one version of this popular dish, but many exist, and there are very few ingredients that cannot, and do not, find their way into Eussian salad. Many cooks use fillets of cold chicken or game for this.

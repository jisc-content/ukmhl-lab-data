FANCY SALADS. 13 Needless to say that any cold fish can be used uj) in these ways, only varying the garnishes. Macedoine de Grahe en Mayonnaise.—Line a plain timballe or Charlotte mould with aspic, then fill it to the depth of an inch or so with either some of the contents of a bottle or tin of vegetable macedoine, or else cold cooked vegetables of all kinds (carrots, turnij), cucumber, French beans, &c.), season with pepj>er, salt, oil, and vinegar, pouring sufiicient aspic over it to set it well. Now fill up the mould to within one and a half inches of the edge with a crab puree made thus: Pick the flesh from a freshly cooked crab, and put the meat into a basin, mixing it with about a gill and a haK of tartare sauce, a gill of stifiiy whipped cream, and about two gills of just liquid aspic jelly ; stir it all well together, and use just as it is setting, covering this again with a layer of the vegetables as before, and running a layer of aspic jelly over it to set it. Prepare a nice lettuce salad, using a French salad dressing and a good sprinkle of mixed herbs (parsley, chives, tarragon, chervil, &c.), then turn out the mould of crab, and serve garnished with seasoned lettuce, plovers’ eggs (if in season), little heaps of caviare, &c., all round. Needless to say, this is equally good if any other fish, to say nothing of poultry or game, is substituted for the crab. These will give some idea of the use of fish in salads, but, indeed, strange as it may sound, chicken or game can in almost every case replace the fish.

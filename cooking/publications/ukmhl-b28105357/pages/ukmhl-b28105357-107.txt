SAYOURIES. 95 Croutes d la Gloucester.—Cut some rounds of Hovis bread and of cbeese to match, and pile on each en pyramide some Gloucester sauce made thus : Beat up four eggs till light, then add a gill each of cream and chilli vinegar, a little French mustard, salt, cayenne, and 2oz. of fresh butter; stir this in the bain-marie till quite thick, but mind it does not boil, then, off the fire, add a few drops of lemon juice and some finely minced tarragon and set it on ice till wanted. Canapes de Tomates au Parmesan.—Have ready some round fried croutons; dip some rich-coloured tomatoes for a minute in boiling water, skin and slice them, and lay a slice of tomato on each, put a cube of Gruyere seasoned with oil and vinegar on this, and then, by means of a pipe and bag, mask the whole with egg white meringue strongly flavoured with grated Parmesan, and coralline pepper, and serve; or set it in a slack oven for a minute or two to crisp and colour very faintly. Cheese Crab.—Pound 2oz. of cheese with a dessertspoonful of anchovy sauce, the same of made mustard, and also of anchovy or chilli vinegar, a pinch of red pepper, a little salt, the yolks of two eggs, and a tablespoonful of butter. Pour this mixture on to hot buttered toast and bake for seven or eight minutes till nicely browned. Or it may be thoroughly mixed in a basin (without cooking) and served cold on squares of Hovis bread, as you please. ^ Cornets a la Milanaise.—Have ready as many cornets made with cheese pastry as you require.

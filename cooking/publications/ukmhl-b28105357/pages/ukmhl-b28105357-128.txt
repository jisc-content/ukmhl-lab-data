SALADS, SANDWICHES, Ac. 116 yellow, but for some purposes a 'white mayownaise may be needed, in which case use the white of the egg instead of the yolk, cream instead of oil,, and strained lemon juice instead of vinegar. ~Red- mayo'nnaise may be prepared in two ways: To some good rich mayonnaise add enough pounded and sieved lobster coral to bring it all to a rich red tint, adding a little coralline pepper and some more mustard. (This sauce should be made in the boat it is to be served in, and must be kept as cool as possible.) Or, rub four large ripe and well- coloured tomatoes through a fine sieve, and incor- porate this pur^e with an equal amount of rich mayonnaise and a spoonful (the size of this depends on taste)^ of tarragon vinegar. If fresh tomatoes cannot be had, use the French Gonse'tâ€™ve de tomates, or the American canned tomato pulp, but in this case you may need a drop or two of liquid carmine to bring up the colour. Green mayonnaise is produced thus : Blanch a few spravs of chervil, parsley, and tarragon, then drain well and pound; incorporate this puree with half a pint of mayonnaise, to which you have added a few drops of spinach or other vegetable green colour- ing, and use. Mayonnaise aspic, a very useful garnish, is made by mixing a gill of any of the above forms of mayonnaise with half a pint of just liquid aspic, and using it as it is on the point of setting. For instance, a delicious salad may be made from the remains of a cold roast duck in this way. Prepare a pint of mayonnaise aspic, cut the remains of the duck into neat fillets and

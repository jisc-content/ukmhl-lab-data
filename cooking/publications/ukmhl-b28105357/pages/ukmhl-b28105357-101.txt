SAYOURIES. 89 Have ready a boiled cauliflower (one left over from the previous night will do nicely), and cover it with haK the oiled butter; now strew it thickly with grated cheese and fresh bread-crumbs, moisten with some of the oiled butter; then another layer of the cheese and bread-crumbs, pour the rest of the oiled butter over it, and brown with a red hot salamander or shovel, and serve very hot. If preferred, use white sauce instead of the oiled butter. Pounded Cheese.—Break up any good cheese, even if dry and hard (this is a capital way of using up dry scraps of cheese), and pound it with either fresh butter or oil, using 3oz. or 4oz. of either of these to the lib. of cheese, according to the dryness of the latter; seasoning it to taste with pepper, black or red, rnade mustard, or curry powder (a teaspoonful of either of the two latter to the 11b. of cheese), cayenne, or ketchup, &c., as you please. Now press it into little pots, when it will keep for some days in a cool place ; or for some weeks if clarified butter is run over the top. This is excellent for sandwiches, or it may be shaped into little balls (some minced pickle being worked into it if liked), left on ice for two or three hours, then served with hot, biscuit- crisp toast. Baked Cheese Sandwiches.—Cut slices from some rich cheese, about one-third of an inch thick, and place these between slices of brown bread and butter, seasoning them as you do so with freshly gromid pepper and a drop or two of tarragon vinegar ; set these sandwiches in the oven and serve at once, directly the bread is toasted.

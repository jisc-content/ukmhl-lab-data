SALADS, SANDWICHES, &c. 128 creamy, and in this state it is used to cover the moulda. First put a little of the fat on a baking sheet, and stand the wooden mould on this to keep it firm, then apply the fat thickly and evenly, smoothing it with a palette knife dipped in hot water, and finishing it off with a flat or round ruler (the latter for choice), dipped in hot water, to get the surface perfectly level and smooth. This block, if left to harden in a cold plac-e, will have all the appearance and hardness of marble. To remove it from the baking sheet, stand the latter over a pan of boiling water just to soften the fat under the socle, which may then be lifted off. If the second mould is placed on the first, cover it in exactly the same way, affixing it to the under socle, as you fastened the latter to the baking sheet, with a little semi-melted fat. Of course, these wooden blocks can be cut into any shape you please, and the fat covering may be chiselled and modelled into all sorts of shapes, but for ordinary purposes the above are infinitely the best; the advantage of these stands is that, once made, they last a good long time if stored in a cold, dry place, in tins, and only need a rub over with a moist cloth to keep them in condition. Some cooks, however, prefer a mixture of lloz. of best white lard and 7oz. white wax, as being more* durable than the previously given mixture.

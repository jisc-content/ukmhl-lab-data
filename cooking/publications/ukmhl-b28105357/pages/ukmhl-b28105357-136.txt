124 SALADS, SANDWICHES, &c. moderate oven till crisp and dry, but mind they do not discolour. If to be used for cornets, use one whole egg instead of the half, and less water. Cheese, for Cornets.—Rub up together 4oz. -of fine flour, 2oz. of butter, a little salt and coralline pepper ; when thoroughly mixed, work in one whole ■egg, joz. of grated Parmesan cheese, and just enough milk to get it to a smooth stiff paste. Roll it out thinly, prick it with a fork, or a pricker, stamp it out in rounds (or in squares if to use with Pompadour moulds), three to four inches across .and one-eighth of an inch thick, and use them to line some well-buttered cornet moulds, slipping another buttered mould into the first one as soon .as it is lined (to keep the paste in place), and bake in a moderate oven for twenty-five to thirty minutes till crisp, then slip them off the tins, and use when cold. Batter Dariols.—Have ready some clean boiling fat, and plunge the dariol fryer with thi*ee moulds into this till it is quite hot; then mask the sides and bottoms quickly with frying batter, carefully trimming off the superfluous batter round the top •edge with your finger or a knife, and fry at once in the boiling fat till of a nice golden colour; then lift off the cases (when done they should slip off •quite easily), return them at once to the fat for a minute to crisp the insides, and, after draining them well, either fill them with whatever ragout, &c., you wish to use, or else store them in an air-tight box till wanted, as they will keep well for two or three •days, and are convenient to have ready.

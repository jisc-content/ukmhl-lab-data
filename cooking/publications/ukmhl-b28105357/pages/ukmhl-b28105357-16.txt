SALADS, SANDWICHES, &c. 4 must be prepared beforehand, arrange your dish, put the green stuff neatly on a plate on ice, or in a cold place, and the dressing ready mixed in a wide- mouthed, closely covered jar (for if the air gets to mayonnaise it makes it rank); the salad can then be quickly mixed at the last, and neatly dished, and will look and eat crisp and fresh. Fish can be made into a salad in jjrecisely the same way, only varying the ingredients according to the fish or the season, but always sprinkle it at the last with minced herbs, or fourniture as the French call it. For chicken use well washed and dried lettuce broken up (never cut lettuces!), j>eeled and sliced tomato, cucumber, artichoke bottoms, &c. For these the dressing given above is much to be recom- mended, and a good sprinkling of minced ham or tongue should not be omitted. As mayonnaise is a sauce that does not stand well (though a good spoonful of absolutely boiling water to the half jDint, stirred in carefully at the last, will prevent its thickening unduly), the following recijte for ‘‘ cooked mayonnaise,” for which I am indebted to M. C. H. Senn, may be useful: For this stir together in a basin a tablespoonful each of sugar, oil, and salt, and a full dessertspoonful of mustard, till j^erfectly smooth; then work in the well-beaten yolks of three eggs, next a gill of vinegar, and lastly half a pint of milk or single cream, and stir these all over the fire in the bain-marie till of the consistency of custard, but without letting it boil. It is ready when the mixture will coat the spoon thickly and smoothly. This, if tightly bottled, will keep for several days.

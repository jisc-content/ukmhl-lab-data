DO NOT BUY BAKING POWDER LOOSE OR IN BULK.—(What is meant by loose is weighed out in any quantity asked for.) All examinations made hy Boards of Health, Govern- ment Chemists, and others, prove loose powders are, almost without exception, made from alum, and at a cost of about one tenth of what a pure Cream Tartar powder, like the “ Royai. ” Baking Powder, can he made for. The argument that the consumer will save, in the purchase of such poisonous stuff, the cost of can, label, etc., is used simply to enable the seller to make a larger profit in selling an alum hulk, or loose, powder at the expense of the unsuspecting consumer, than can be made by selling the absolutely pure “ Royal ” brand. Remember this, and insist on getting the “ Royal ” in cans. Do not buy alum baking powders under any circumstances.

In every sort of provisions, the best of the kind goes farthest; cutting out most advantageously, and affording most nourishment. Round of beef, fillet of veal, and leg of mutton, bear a higher price ; but having more solid meat, deserve the preference.

R^imps and aitch bones of beef are often bruised by the blows the drovers give, and that part always taints: avoid purchasing such. The shank bones of mutton should be saved, and after soaking and bruising may be added to give richness to gravies and soups, and they are particularly nourishing for the sick. Calves' tongues, salted, make a more useful dish than when dressed with the brains, which may be served without. 2*

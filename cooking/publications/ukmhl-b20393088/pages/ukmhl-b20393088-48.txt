POETICAL COOK-BOOK. 44 ROASTED CALF'S LIVER. Pray a slice of your liver. Goldsmith. Wash and wipe it, then cut a long hole in it, and stuff it with crumbs of bread, chopped, an anchovy, a good deal of fat bacon, onion, salt, pepper, a bit of butter, and an egg; stew the liver up, lard it, wrap it in a veal caul, and roast it. Serve with good brown gravy and currant jelly. SCOTCH COLLOPS. A cook has mighty things professed ; Then send us but two dishes nicely dressed,â€” One called Scotch Collops, King. Cut veal in thin bits, about three inches over and rather round, beat with a rolling-pin; grate a little nutmeg over them; dip in the yolk of an egg, and fry them in a little butter of a fine brown; have ready, warm, to pour upon them, half a pint of gravy, a little bit of butter rubbed into a little flour, to which put the yolk of an egg, two large spoonfuls of cream, and a little salt. Do not boil the sauce, but stir until of a fine thickness to serve with the collops.

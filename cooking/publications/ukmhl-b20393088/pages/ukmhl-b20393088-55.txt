51 MEATS. CAPON. In good roast beef my landlord sticks his knife, The capon fat delights his dainty wife. Gay. Take a quart of white wine, season the capon with salt, cloves, and whole pepper, a few shallots, and then put the capon in an earthen pan; you must take care it has not room to shake ; it must be covered close, and done over a slow charcoal fire. CHICKEN CROQUETTES. Gargilius, sleek, voluptuous lord, A hundred dainties smoke upon his board â€¢, Earth, air, and ocean ransack'd for the feast, In masquerade of foreign olios dress'd. Warton. Reduce two spoonfuls of veloute or sauce tournee, and add to the yolks of four eggs; put to this the white meat of a chicken, minced very small, and well mixed with the sauce; take it out, and roll it into balls, about the size of a walnut; roll them in breadcrumbs, giving them an elongated form ; then beat them in some well-beaten egg; bread them again, and fry them of a light brown.

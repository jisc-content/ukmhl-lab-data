70 POETICAL COOK-BOOK. CRANBERRY SAUCE. Our fathers most admired their sauces siveet, And often asked for sugar with their meat. King. Wash a quart of ripe cranberries, and put them into a pan with just about a teacup of water; stew them slowly and stir them frequently, particularly after they begin to burst. They require a great deal of stewing, and should be like marmalade when done. When they are broken and the juice comes out, stir in a pound of .white sugar. When they are thoroughly done, put them into a deep dish, and set them away to get cold. You may strain the pulp through a cullender or sieve into a mould, and when it is a firm shape send it to table. Cranberry sauce is eaten with roast fowl, tur- key, &c. CAPER SAUCE. Along these shores Neglected trade with difficulty toils, Collecting slender stores ; the sun-dried grape, Or capers from the rock, that prompt the taste Of luxury. Dyer. To make a quarter of a pint, take a tablespoon- ful of capers and two teaspoonfuls of vinegar.

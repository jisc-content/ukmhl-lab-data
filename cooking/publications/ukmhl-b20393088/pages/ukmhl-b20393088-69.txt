65 SAUCES. MUSHROOM KETCHUP. If you please, ni taste your tempting toasted cheese, Broiled ham, and nice mushroomed ketcJiiip. If you love good ketchup, gentle reader, make it yourself, after the following directions, and you will have a delicious relish for made dishes, ragouts, soup, sauces, or hashes.

A couple quarts of double ketchup, made accord- ing to the following receipt, will save you some score pounds of meat, besides a vast deal of time and trouble, as it will furnish, in a few minutes, as good sauce as can be made for either fish, flesh, or fowl. I believe the following^is the best way for preparing and extracting the essence of mushrooms.

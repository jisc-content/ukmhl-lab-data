TO THE READER. Though cooks are often men of pregnant wit. Through niceness of their subject few have writ. Tis a sage question, if the art of cooks Is lodg'd by nature or attained by books ? That man will never frame a noble treat. Whose whole dependence lies in some receipt. Then by pure nature everything is spoiPd,â€” She knows no more than stew'd, bak'd, roast, and boiPd. When art and nature join, the effect will be. Some nice ragout, or charming fricasee. What earth and waters breed, or air inspires, Man for his palate fits by torturing fires. But, though my edge be not too nicely set. Yet I another's appetite may whet; May teach him when to buy, when season's pass'd. What's stale, what choice, what plentiful, what waste.

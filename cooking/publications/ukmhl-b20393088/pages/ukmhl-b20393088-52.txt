POETICAL COOK-BOOK. STEWED DUCK AND PEAS. I give thee all my kitchen lore, Though poor the offering be; I'll tell thee how 'tis cooked, before You come to dine with me. The duck is truss'd from head to heels. Then stew'd with butter well, And streaky bacon, Avhich reveals A most delicious smell. When duck and bacon, in a mass, You in a stewpan lay, A spoon around the vessel pass. And gently stir away; A tablespoonful of flour bring, A quart of water plain, Then in it tAventy onions fling, And gently stir again. A bunch of parsley, and a leaf Of ever verdant bay, Two cloves,â€”I make my language brief, Then add your jDeas you may; And let it simmer till it sings In a delicious strain ; Then take your duck, nor let the strings For trussing it remain.

POETICAL COOK-BOOK. XX The difFerent taste of people requires more or less of the flavor of spices, garlic, butter, &c., which can never be directed by general rules, and if the cook has not a good taste, and attention to that of her employers, not all the ingredients with which nature or art can furnish her will give an exquisite relish to her dishes. The proper articles should be at hand, and she must proportion them until the true zest be obtained. March, 1864.

POETICAL COOK-BOOK. 102 Such is thy name, significant and clear,â€” A name, a sound, to every Yankee dear; But most to me, whose heart and palate chaste Preserve my pure, hereditary taste. Barlow. YORKSHIRE PUDDING. The strong table groans Beneath the smoking sirloin, stretch'd immense From side to side 5 in which with desperate knife They deep incisions make, and talk the while Of England's glory, ne'er to be defaced While hence they borrow vigor; or amain Into the pudding plunged at intervals, If stomach keen can intervals allow, Relating all the glories of the chase. Thomson.. This pudding is especially an excellent accom- paniment to a sirloin of beef. Six tablespoonfuls of flour, three eggs, a teaspoonful of salt, and a pint of milk, make a middling stiff batter; beat it up well; take care it is not lumpy. Put a dish under the meat; let the drippings drop into it, till it is quite hot and well greased; then pour in the batter. When the upper surface is browned and set, turn it, that both sides may be brown alike. A pudding an inch thick will take two hours. Serve it under the roast beef, that the juice of the beef may enter it. It is very fine.

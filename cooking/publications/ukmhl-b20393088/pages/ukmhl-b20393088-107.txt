103 DESSERTS. SUET PUDDING. Sir Balaam now, he lives like other folks; He takes his chirping, and cracks his jokes. Live like yourself, was soon my lady's word; And lo! suet pudding was seen upon the board. Pope. Suet, a quarter of a pound; flour, three table- spoonfuls ; eggs two, and a little grated ginger; milk, half a pint. Mince the suet as fine as pos- sible; roll it with the rolling-pin, so as to mix it well with the flour; beat up the eggs, mix them with the milk, and then mix them all together; wet your cloth well in boiling water, and boil it an hour and a quarter. Mrs. Glasse has it: " When you have made your water boil, then put your pud- ding into your pot." OATMEAL PUDDING. Of oats decorticated take two pounds, And of new milk enough the same to drown ; Of raisins of the sun, stoned, ounces eight; Of currants, cleanly picked, an equal weight; Of suet, finely sliced, an ounce at least; And six eggs, newly taken from the nest: Season this mixture well with salt and spice; 'Twill make a pudding far exceeding rice; And you may safely feed on it like farmers, For the recipe is learned Dr, Harmer's.

DEDICATION. " What's under this cover ? For cookery's a secret."â€”Moore. When I wrote the following pages, some years back at Oak Lodge, as a pastime, I did not think it would be of service to my fellow-creatures, for our suffering sol- diers, the sick, wounded, and needy, who have so nobly fought our country's cause, to maintain the flag of our great Republic, and to prove among Nations that a Free Republic is not a myth. With these few words I dedi- cate this book to the Sanitary Fair to be held in Philadelphia, June, 1864. March, 1864. 1*

112 MISCELLANEOUS. YEAST. Not with the leaven, as of old, Of sin and malice fed. But with unfeigned sincerity. One dozen of potatoes, two cupfuls of hops ; put them together in a bag, and pbice them in a pot with two quarts of water; let it boil till the pota- toes are done; a cupful of salt, a ladle of flour ; then pour the boiling water over it, then let it stand till lukewarm; add a cupful of old yeast, cover it up, and put near the fire till it foments. BREAD. His diet was of wheaten bread, COWPER. Mixt with the rustic throng, see ruddy maids, Some taught with dextrous hand to twirl the wheel, Some expert To raise from leavened wheat the kneaded loaf. DoDSLEY.

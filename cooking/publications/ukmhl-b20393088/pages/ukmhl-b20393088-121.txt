117 CAKES. BUCKWHEAT CAKES. Do, dear James, mix up the cakes: Just one quart of meal it takes; Pour the water on the pot, Be careful it is not too hot; Sift the meal well through your hand. Thicken well—don't let it stand; Stir it quick,—clash, clatter, clatter! 0 what light, delicious batter! Now listen to the next command: On the dresser let it stand Just three quarters of an hour, To feel the gently rising power Of powders, melted into yeast. To lighten well this precious feast. See, now it rises to the brim! Quick, take the ladle, dip it in; So let it rest, until the fire The griddle heats as you desire. Be careful that the coals are glowing, No smoke around its white curls throwi Apply the suet, softly, lightly; The griddle's black face shines more brightly.

50 POETICAL COOK-BOOK. BOILED TURKEY. But man, cursed man, on turkeys preys, And Christmas shortens all our days. Sometimes with oysters we combine. Sometimes assist the savory chine. From the low peasant to the lord, The turkey smoi^es on every board. Gay. Make a stuffing of bread, salt, pepper, nutmeg, lemon-peel, a few oysters, a bit of butter, some suet, and an egg; put this into the crop, fasten up the skin, and boil the turkey in a floured cloth to make it very white. Have ready some oyster sauce made rich with butter, a little cream, and a spoonful of soy, and serve over the turkey. / DEVILLED TURKEY. And something's here with name uncivil, For our cook christens it "J. Devil,^ "-4 Devil, in any shape, sweet maid, A parson fears not," Syntax said; " I'll make him minced meat; 'tis my trade." Take cold roast turkey legs, score them well, season them with salt and plenty of cayenne pep- per and mustard, then broil them. Serve them hot.

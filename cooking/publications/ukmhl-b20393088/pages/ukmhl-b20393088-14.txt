He'd say, "Mend this and t'other line and this." If after trial it were still amiss. He'd bid you give it a new turn of face. Or set some dish more curious in its place. If you persist, he would not strive to move A passion so delightful as self-love. Cooks garnish out some tables, some they fill. Or in a prudent mixture show their skill. Clog not your constant meals; for dishes few Increase the appetite when choice and new. E'en they who will extravagance profess. Have still an inward hatred for excess. Meat forced too much, untouch'd at table lies; Few care for carving trifles in disguise. Or that fantastic dish some call surprise. When pleasures to the eye and palate meet. That cook has render'd his great work complete;

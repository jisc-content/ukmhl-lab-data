1st SYLLABUB. Mountown ! the Muses' most delicious theme, 0, may thy codlins ever swim in cream ! The rasp and strawberries in Bordeaux drown, To add a redder tincture to their own! Thy white wine, sugar, milk, together club, To make that gentle viandâ€”syllabub! King. Not all thy plate, how formed soe'er it be. Can please my palate like a bowl of thee. Barlow. In a large china bowl put a pint of port and a pint of sherry, or other white wine; sugar to taste. Milk the bowl full; in twenty minutes cover it pretty high with clouted cream; grate over it nut- meg ; put pounded cinnamon and nonpareil com- fits. It is very good without the nonpareil comfits.

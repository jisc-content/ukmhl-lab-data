We may live without poetry, music, and art; We may live without conscience and live without heart j We may live without friends j we may live without books 5 But civilized man cannot live without cooks. He may live without books—what is knowledge but grieving He may live without hope—what is hope but deceiving ? He may live without love—what is passion but pining ? But where is the man who can live without dining f Owen Meredith's " Lucile.'

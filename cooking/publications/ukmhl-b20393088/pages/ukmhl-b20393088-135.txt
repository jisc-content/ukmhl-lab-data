CAKES. 131 macaroons on sheets of white paper, either round or oval, as you please; lay them at least an inch .apart, because they spread in baking, and, if put nearer, would touch. The whole of your paste being used, place the sheets of paper on tins in a moderate oven for three quarters of an hour. This kind of cake requires great care.

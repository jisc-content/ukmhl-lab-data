CAKES. 123 HONEY-CAKE. In vain the circled loaves attempt to lie Concealed in flaskets from my curious eye 5 In vain the cheeses, offspring of the pail, Or honeyed cakes, which gods themselves regale. Parnell. One pound and a half of dried sifted flour, three quarters of a pound of honej, half a pound of finely- powdered loaf sugar, a quarter of a pound of citron, and half an ounce of orange-peel cut small, of pow- dered ginger and cinnamon, three quarters of an ounce. Melt the sugar with the honey, and mix in the other ingredients ; roll out the paste, and cut it into small cakes of any form. NAPLES BISCUITS.

Put three quarters of a pound of fine flour to a pound of powdered sugar ; sift both together three times ; then add six eggs beaten well, and a spoon- ful of rose-water; when the oven is nearly hot, bake them.

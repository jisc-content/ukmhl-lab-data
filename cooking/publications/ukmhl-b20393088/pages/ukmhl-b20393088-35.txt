FISH. 31 OYSTERS. The man had sure a palate cover'd o'er With brass or steel, that on the rocky shore First broke the oozy oystefs pearly coat, And risk'd the living morsel down his throat. Gay. Common people are indifferent about the man- ner of opening oysters, and the time of eating them, after they are opened. Nothing, however, is more important in the enlightened eyes of the experienced oyster-eater. Those who wish to en- joy this delicious restorative in its utmost perfec- tion must eat it the moment it is opened, with its own gravy in the under shell. If not eaten while absolutely alive, its flavor and spirit are lost. FRIED OYSTERS. You shapeless nothing, in a dish! You, that are but almost a fish! COWPER. The largest and finest oysters should be chosen for frying.

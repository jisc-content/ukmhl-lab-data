These are used as the basis of a large number of effervescing drinks, cups, etc. They are consumed alone or with wines or spirits. The process of manufacture is not difficult; they are made by forcing a certain quantity of carbonic acid into water, which, under pressure, dissolves a quantity of this gas, but gives off’ the greater part again as soon as the pressure is removed, or, in other words, as soon as the stopper is taken out of the bottle. Soda and potash waters usually contain ten to fifteen grains of bicarbonate of soda or potash, in addition to the car- bonic acid. Seltzer water should contain chlorides of sodium, calcium, and magnesium, with phosphate and sulphate of sodium. Lemonade and other fruit beve- rages are made by the addition of a certain quantity of fruit essence or syrup to aerated water. There are also a number of natural mineral or aerated waters which are obtained from springs containing certain salts in addition to carbonic acid gases. Among these may be mentioned Apollinaris, Johannis, Salutaris, Seltzers, Rossbach, and Vichy waters. Africaine (a T). African style. Africains,Name of a kind of French dessert biscuits.

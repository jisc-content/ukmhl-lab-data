PREFACE. rpiHE technical terms used in cookery have originated in the language of the different countries in which the art was practised. The words now in use are chiefly French. In science most of the technical words are of Greek origin. Italian words formerly more common in cookery have been entirely superseded by French, and if French words were Anglicised there would still be a difficulty in finding words equally expressive. It would be an advantage when possible in menus to use English words as well as French, but in recipes this is scarcely possible because no other words have the same meaning and value ; and as cookery for two centuries has been more carefully cultivated by the French we have a large number of French words which are often a stumbling-block to cooks, but when these words are explained they are no longer a difficulty but a valuable assistance, and it is the object of the following pages to provide persons with a dictionary of words used in cookery. The French language is now the language of diplomacy and cookery. J. C. Buckmastek.

INTEODUGTION. rjlHE object of this little book is intended to show the reader at a glance the meaning of certain words and expressions used in cookery and gastronomy. It gives in a concise form such information which would otherwise cost much time and labour to obtain. It is a dictionary of culinary technical terms, the names of most food stuffs, food and cookery auxiliaries, condiments and beverages. The names of many new delicacies and foods will be found duly registered, whilst all the foreign terms used in menus and recipes are translated or explained. In short, every subject referring to the table or cuisine has been judiciously treated, and the so-called technicalities have been rendered intelligible. The work is by no means complete, and I do not wish it to be regarded as such ; though I trust by means of it many a difficult question will be answered, and that it will be found a helpful and convenient manual of reference by professional cooks, cookery teachers, managers of hotels, clubs, restaurants, and of households.

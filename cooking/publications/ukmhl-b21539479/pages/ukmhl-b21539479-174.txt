CHAPTER VIII SAUCES, FORCEMEATS, AND FLAVOURING BUTTERS SAUCES. A SAUCE is a liquid seasoning which always contains some kind of a liaison. It differs from a gravy in that a gravy is transparent, and osmazome forms its characteristic flavour. The art of sauce-making consists in preparing liquids from the various ingredients employed, and cleverly blending the various flavours. Sauces may be divided into two kinds, viz. : a. Plain sauces, or those which are quickly prepared. b. Rich sauces, or those which require much preparation. Sauces are thickened by means of a liaison, which is a thickening or binding. Liaisons may be of several kinds: 1. Roux, which may be white, fawn or brown. 2. Egg liaisons, consisting of yolks of eggs and cream. 3. Butter and cream. 4. Farinaceous products, as flour, cornflour, etc. Sauces should be cooked for some time, so as to extract the flavour of the different ingredients. Overcooking, however, renders a sauce oily, but if a teaspoonful of cold water is added its original consistency will be restored. When adding hot liquid to a sauce use a whisk, and so avoid the formation of lumps.

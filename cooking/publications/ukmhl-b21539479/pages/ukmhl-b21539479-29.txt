CHAPTER I STOCKS AND SOUPS STOCKS. Stock forms the basis of most soups and many sauces. It is the liquid in which hones, meat, or vegetables have been boiled. It should not be strongly flavoured, as it would render it unsuitable for the more delicate sauces and soups. It should be clear, and of a pale colour. Stock made from meat must be simmered very gently; boiling would harden the meat, and prevent the complete extraction of the juices. But in making stock from bones, boil quickly, as the goodness to be extracted will consist chiefly of gelatine, and this can be more thoroughly extracted by a high temperature. The lid of the stockpot should fit well to prevent unnecessary loss of steam. This stock will set to a firm jelly when cold. It will have less flavour than that made with meat, but will be more suitable for making glaze and for braising. There are several kinds of stock, viz.: 1. First stock, or clear stock. 2. Good economical stock. 3. Second stock. 4. Game stock. 5. Fish stock. 6. Vegetable stock. The first or clear stock is cleared with meat, or meat and white of egg, and is used for all consommes. 1

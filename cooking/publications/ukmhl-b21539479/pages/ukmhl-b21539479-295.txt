Beef-tea is so valuable in cases of illness that it deserves special attention. It must be regarded as a stimulant rather than a food. The goodness extracted will consist chiefly of albumen and other soluble extractives. The meat must be finely divided by scraping and shredding, and then soaked in cold water that the albumen may be drawn out, and afterwards cooked very lightly, remembering how easily this constituent of meat is rendered hard and indigestible when submitted to a high temperature. Shin of beef makes very savoury beef-tea, but it contains more sinew and gristle and less of the albumen and red juices than rump or buttock steak. A small quantity cooked with the steak will be found an improvement. If the beef-tea is required to set in a jelly, it is best to stew the shin of beef separately and mix it after- wards, as the high temperature required to extract the gelatine hardens and renders indigestible the albumen. Rules for Beef-tea. 1. Choose fresh lean juicy steak. 2. Remove all fat and scrape or shred the meat finely. 3. Allow 1 pint of water to a pound of meat. 4. Put the meat into a basin with the water and salt to soak for twenty minutes before cooking. 5. Cook in a double saucepan or stew-jar placed in water. G. Do not boil.

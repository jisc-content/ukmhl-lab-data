MEAT 47 Notes and Rules on Grilling. Grilling is a very convenient way of cooking, it is so quickly done. It is very wholesome and savoury. It is only suitable for small pieces of meat or fish. Only the tender parts of meat should be used, and they must not be too thin. Oily fish are better than white fish for grilling. Double grid- irons are very convenient, especially for fish, which is often difficult to turn without breaking. Avoid sticking a fork or skewer into the meat when turning, as this allows the juices to escape. It is best to use two spoons, or a knife and spoon, or small tongs, for turning when you are using a single gridiron. The time for cooking depends on the thickness of the meat. A well-grilled chop or steak should be tender and juicy. Tildes for Grilling. 1. Have a good clear fire, free from smoke. 2. Trim off a little of the fat, sprinkle the meat with pepper, and brush over the lean with butter. White fish should be well brushed with butter and sprinkled with pepper. Oily fish, such as herrings, do not require butter. 3. Before beginning to cook, let the gridiron get hot; then rub the bars with a piece of suet to prevent the meat from sticking. 4. If there is any choice, put the cut surface towards the fire firstâ€”e.g., kidneys. 5. Turn the meat continually. 6. Send to the table as soon as cooked. Notes and Rules on Roasting. Roasting is nicest when done in front of the fire; it is a very savoury way of cooking meat. Only the best joints are. suitable, and they should be well hung; the fibres will then be more tender.

MEAT 5» The juices of meat contain a large amount of albumen. Albumen is soluble in cold water, but coagulates in hot water. It is possible to extract the juices from meat without cooking by mincing the meat finely and soaking it in cold water for one or two hours. Rules for Stews. 1. Use warm liquid. 2.

Choose the best end of the neck, do not have it chopped, but have the chine-bone sawn off, so that the cutlets can be easily divided; and if the bones measure more than 4£ inches, saw a piece off the other side to make them the right length. It is best to get very small mutton, as there will be less fat. Divide the cutlets evenly, trim off most of the fat, and scrape an inch of the meat from the end of each cutlet bone. Frills can be put on just before serving if liked. If nicely trimmed, they will make a dainty entree. They can be fried, braised, or sauted, and served with various sauces and vegetables. For a cold entree, after cooking they may be set in aspic jelly, then cut out and served with a salad and chopped jelly, or braised and coated with chaudfroid sauce or tomato sauce in which a little aspic jelly or gelatine has been mixed to enable it to set. The whole of the ncclc of small mutton or lamb will be found an economical and useful joint from which to get a variety of dishes. E.g., the best end is suitable for cutlets or roasting; the middle for boiling, stewing, or haricot mutton; while the scrag end can be used for an Irish stew or Scotch broth.

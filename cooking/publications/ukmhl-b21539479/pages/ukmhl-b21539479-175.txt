A mirepoix is a flavouring consisting of ham or bacon, vegetables, thyme, and bay-leaves. If required for a brown sauce, it is browned. A bouquet garni consists of a few sprigs of parsley, sprig of thyme and marjoram, a bay-leaf, two cloves, a spring onion, and a strip of lemon-rind. Flavouring butters take their name from their characteristic ingredient, as horseradish butter, coral butter, etc. They are much used for sauces, and will keep for some time if put into a small jar and covered over. Plain sauces are nearly all made from the same foundation, a simple white sauce. This sauce, with the addition of essence of anchovy, a few shrimps, a hard-boiled egg, or sugar, at once becomes anchovy, shrimp, egg or sweet sauce. The sauce should be gently reheated after these additions till the added matter is warmed through. If cream is used it should be added at the very last, just before serving. Thus, when the art of making the foundation is thoroughly understood a variety of sauces can be easily made. 10â€”2

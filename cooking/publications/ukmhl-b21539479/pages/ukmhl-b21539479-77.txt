It is a most perfect way of cooking, as there is no danger of hardening the meat by too high a temperature. A proper steaming apparatus consists of two vessels, one of which fits into the top of the other and is perforated at the bottom. The under one is for the water, the upper one for the meat, which is cooked by the steam passing up through the holes. It is quite possible to carry out this mode of cooking by using an ordinary saucepan, and supporting the joint on jam- jars to prevent it from coming in contact with the water. The lid must be fixed on tightly to prevent loss of steam. In braising, the meal 'is resting on a bed of vegetables which is covered with stock. This is more savoury than simply steaming, as the meat imbibes the flavour of the vegetables. It is a favourite way of cooking boned and stuffed joints and birds. In a proper braising-pan the lid is indented for the purpose of holding live charcoal, so that the meat is partly roasted while steaming. Much the same result is attained by browning the meat in the oven after it is taken out of the saucepan, and basting with its own liquor. Rules for Steaming and Braising. 1. Choose lean joints. 2.

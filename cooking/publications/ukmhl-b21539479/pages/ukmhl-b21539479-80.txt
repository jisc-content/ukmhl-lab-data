KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK 52 The sirloin of beef (a small piece), with the undercut or fillet, may be used as follows : The undercut or fillet removed, and either braised or cut into fillets and made into an entree, as directed in ‘ Fillets of Beef.’ The rest of the joint may be roasted as it is, or boned and rolled, and some good soup made with the bones; or the thin end of the meat may be cut off and stewed (if not too fat), or pickled and boiled for a cold luncheon dish. The ribs or chine of beef is a cheaper joint, and though it has not such a fine flavour as sirloin, it is suitable for many dishes. A joint of three or four pounds may be used as follows : Cut off a thick slice, spread with veal stuffing, and roast; serve with brown sauce. Another portion of it may be used for a pie or pudding, using a little kidney with it, while the rest can be either stewed, jugged, or used for beef olives, or minced and made into a dish of ‘ Fillets of Beef with Kidney Beans.’ Boiled Beef (served Cold). 10 lb. rump of beef (pickled). 1 carrot. 1 turnip. 1 onion. 1 bunch of herbs. 2 allspice. 2 cloves. 20 peppercorns. 1J oz. gelatine. Glaze. (Enough for 20 people.) Well wash the beef, tie in a cloth, put into a saucepan with enough hot water to cover, bring to boiling-point, skim, and simmer gently for one hour. Pour off the water and cover with fresh boiling water. Add the vegetables, herbs, and spice. Simmer gently for about three hours longer. Lift out into a large pan, pour over the liquor, cover and leave till cold, then put on a dish, remove the cloth, and glaze. Strain 1 quart of the liquor, put it into the saucepan with the gelatine, add a teaspoonful of tarragon vinegar, stir over the fire till dissolved, pour into a basin and leave till set. Serve the beef on a dish, garnished with the chopped jelly.

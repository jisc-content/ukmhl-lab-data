INTRODUCTION xxii passing up the chimney, also the saucepans get very dirty and frequently the contents smoky â€¢ whereas in a perfectly con- structed closed range, where the firebox has a movable bottom, by which it can be raised or lowered as required, only a small amount of fire is necessary to keep all the saucepans on the hot-plate boiling. Then, again, the heat of the oven in the open ranges is very uneven. In the closed ranges the flues are so arranged that the heat can be directed over the top and down the side of the oven as required for roasting, or down the side and along the bottom as required for baking. A closed range is no detriment to roasting in front of the fire, as when the firebox is at its lowest there is as great a surface of heat as in an open range. In choosing a range, it is best to have one with iron flues; there is less chance of their getting out of order through the expansion and contraction caused by the heat. There is no danger of defective setting, which is often the case when one is dependent upon brick flues. Gas stoves are very convenient, especially in the summer, when heat is only required for cooking. The oven only requires from five to ten minutes to heat. Gas stoves are cleaner and save time, as no stoking is required. If properly fixed and ventilated, there is little or no smell. They can be rented from 2s. 6d. per quarter. Thermometers can be fitted to the ovens of either. They cost about 12s. 6d., and are a guide in regulating the heat of the oven. Although a good cooking range is a great comfort, it is possible for an experienced cook to turn out very successful dishes frem a poor apparatus.

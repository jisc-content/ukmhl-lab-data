KING EDWARD'S COOKERY ROOK 4S For small joints, or birds, a Dutch oven may be used, placing it on a trivet which has been hung on the bars. The meat must be kept well basted and turned, and the thickest part of the joint should be hung downwards, as the greatest heat comes from the bottom of the fire. For large joints a jack must be used. This saves turning, for when the jack is wound up the meat is kept revolving. A meat-screen is of great service in retaining and reflecting the heat. In these days it is more usual to roast meat in the oven. Great care must be taken that the oven is perfectly clean and well ventilated. A double meat-tin should be used, so that water can be placed in the under tin. This will prevent the dripping from browning, and giving a disagreeable flavour to the meat. A well-roasted joint should be brown and crisp on the outside, while the inside should be tender and retain all its juices. Hides for Roasting. 1. Choose the best joints, tender, fat, and well hung. 2. Have a bright, clear fire. 3. Weigh the meat, and allow for beef and mutton a quarter of an hour to the pound, and a quarter of an hour over; for veal and lamb twenty minutes to the pound, and twenty minutes over; for pork twenty-five minutes to the pound, and twenty-five minutes over. Boned and stuffed meats require a longer time to cook than plain joints. 4. See that the meat is well jointed. 5. Wipe the meat with a damp cloth, and fasten into shape with string. Never use skewers. 6. Hang the thickest part of the joint downwards, the greatest heat being at the bottom of the fire. 7. If meat has been frozen, bring it into the kitchen several hours before cooking, as it should be thawed slowly. 8. Put meat near to the fire at first to close the pores and keep in the juice; then cook more slowly till tender.

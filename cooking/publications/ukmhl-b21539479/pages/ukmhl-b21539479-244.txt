Notes and Rules for Stewing Fruit. 1. For apples, plums, apricots, green gooseberries, etc., make a syrup of sugar and water. Allow for each pound of fruit ^ lb. of sugar and 2 gills of water. Boil the sugar and water together for ten minutes, prepare the fruit, put it into the syrup, and cook till tender. 2. For very juicy fruit, such as raspberries, currants, rhubarb, etc., about half the quantity of water should be used in making the syrup. 3. Dried fruit, such as prunes, pippins, French plums, pears, api'icots, apples, or apple-rings, should be washed, and then soaked overnight in enough water to cover them. Then stew in the water in which they have been soaked till tender, adding the sugar (2 or 3 oz. to the pound) and suitable flavour- ings. " 4. For hard stewing pears allow f pint of water and 3 oz. of sugar to each pound; being so hard, they require long stewing and the water evaporates. Compote of Apples.

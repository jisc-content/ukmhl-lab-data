228 KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK Rules for Cake-making. 1. The oven must be quite clean. 2. Heat must be uniform. 3. The temperature of the oven should be highest when tho cake is put in; the time of baking depends upon the thickness of the cake, rich mixtures taking longer than plain ones. The heat should be reduced a little after the cake is well risen. To keep a steady heat feed the fire often, putting on little fuel at one time. 4. Cakes should not be moved while baking until quite set, especially very light mixtures; it often shakes them down and makes them close and heavy. 5. The oven door must not be opened very wide when look- ing at the cakes ; the door must not be slammed, as it causes a current of cold air. 6. When baked the centre will feel firm ; another test is to pierce the cake with a trussing-needle or skewer : it should come out quite clean. 7. Put on a sieve to cool after taking out of the tins. Preparation of Cakes. 1. For rich cakes line the tins with well-buttered paper. 2. For plain cakes the tins must be well buttered. 3. Currants must be well washed and dried, then rubbed on a sieve or in a cloth, with a little flour, to remove the stalks. 4. Sultanas must not be washed, only rubbed with a little flour on a sieve or in a cloth to remove stalks. 5. Raisins should be stoned and cut in half. 6. Candied peel should be cut up finely. 7. Eggs should be broken separately, in case of bad ones. 8. Lemon-rind should be grated or chopped very finely, taking care that no white is used.

161 OMELETS AND SOUFFLES Buies. 1. Do not wash the pan, but clean it with salt. 2. Mix the eggs well with a fork, but do not beat them, except when the yolk and whites are separated, as for sweet omelets, when it is necessary to beat both yolks and whites thoroughly. 3. Let the butter get hot before pouring in the mixture. 4. Stir until the mixture begins to set, then fold. 5. Serve a savoury omelet on a hot dish, with or without sauce, as preferred. Serve a sweet omelet on a dish paper. 6. Serve all omelets directly they are made. Notes on Souffles. A souffle is a light, spongy pudding, consisting of a foundation sauce made of butter, flour, and milk or stock, lightened with the whipped whites of eggs. It can be either baked or steamed, and may be savoury or sweet. Care must be taken not to use too much flour, or it will be too firm. Biscuit flour is generally used, being more starchy, but a small quantity of cornflour added to ordinary flour will answer the same purpose. It must be cooked slowly and steadily, as it is apt to fall when cooked quickly. It should be served directly it is firm enough to turn out, as beyond this point it shrinks and becomes tough and leathery. Buies. 1. Well butter the tin, and use clarified butter. 2. Tie a band of stiff paper round the top of the tin to come about 4 inches above. When baking souffles in small cases, butter them, and tie a band of stiff paper round to come about 1 inch above the case. 3. Cook the sauce or panada thoroughly. 4. Beat well after adding each yolk of egg. 5. Whisk the whites stiffly and mix them in at the last. 6. If the souffle is to be steamed, cover it with a piece of buttered paper. 11

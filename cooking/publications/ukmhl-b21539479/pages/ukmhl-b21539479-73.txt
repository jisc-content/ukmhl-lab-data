45 MEAT Rules for boiling Salt Meat. 1. Salted or pickled meat should be washed before cooking. 2. Allow twenty minutes to the pound, and twenty minutes over for any weight up to 8 or 9 lbs. For larger pieces quarter of an hour to the pound will be found sufficient. 3. Put into warm water. 4. Bring to boiling-point and skim well. 5. Boil for five minutes—this is to harden the outside and keep in the goodness; then add a little cold water and draw the saucepan to the side of the fire, and cook very gently until done. This is to prevent the albumen and fibrin from hardening. 6. After skimming add the vegetables, which are served with the meat. 7. If to be served cold, take out the meat when cooked, put into a pan, and pour over the liquor, leave till nearly cold, then lift on to a dish, and when quite cold glaze. 8. If the liquor is wanted for stock, change the water after the meat has cooked one hour. This prevents the stock from being too salt. In this case the vegetables should not be added till the water has been changed. Notes and Rules on Frying. Frying is cooking in hot fat. There are two ways of frying, called ‘ shallow frying ’ and ‘ deep frying.’ In shallow frying you use a frying-pan and very little fat. This method is suitable for sausages, pancakes, and meats. In deep frying you use a stewpan, and for small things a wire basket will be found a great convenience for lifting them in and out of the fat. Sufficient fat must be used to well cover whatever you are frying. This method is used for croquettes, fish, fritters, etc., and these things must be dished quickly and lightly, or they soon lose their crispness. The inside should be soft and lightly cooked, and the outside a golden brown colour. Oil, lard, or clarified fat may be used,

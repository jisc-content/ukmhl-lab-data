Boil the feet for two hours, cut them through, and dry in a cloth. Dip in flour, then in the batter, fry in a frying-pan, and serve with the sauce made with the above ingredients.

Make a slit in the thick part of the joint and stuff with sage stuffing. Sew up securely, hang the meat on a jack, putting the thickest end downwards, put in front of a good clear fire, and baste frequently. Allow twenty-five minutes to the pound, and twenty minutes over. When cooked put the meat on to a hot dish, pour off the dripping from tin, sprinkle the tin with pepper and salt, add the stock boiling, stir over the fire for a few minutes, add the brown sauce. When boiling pour a little round the meat, and put the rest into a tureen. Serve with apple sauce and green vege- tables. N.B.—In roasting a leg of pork, see that it is well scored before cooking.

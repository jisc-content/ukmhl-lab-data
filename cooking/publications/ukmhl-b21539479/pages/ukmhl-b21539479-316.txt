KING EDWARDâ€™S COOKERY BOOK 288 Oranges Preserved Whole. 6 large Seville oranges. Syrup made with 1J lb. sugar to 3 pints water. Kasp off the thin rind of the oranges, cut a small hole in the stalk end, and with the small end of a teaspoon take out the juice, pulp, and pips. Cover them with cold spring water, and let them remain four days, changing the water once ; then tie each orange up in a piece of muslin and boil them in plenty of water until they are tender enough for a straw to go through. Have ready a thin syrup made of 1-|- lb. of sugar and 3 pints of water, put in the oranges, and boil them two hours. Take them out of the pan carefully and put them aside. The next day add another lb. of sugar to the syrup and a little more water, let it simmer awhile, then put in the oranges and boil until quite clear and the syrup like fine honey. Marmalade may be made of the raspings and pulp. Pershore or Green Egg Plum Jam. 1 lb. green plums. 1 lb. sugar. 1 teacupful water. When cooking take out as many stones as possible, crack and put back kernels. Make in the usual way. Quince Jam. Quinces. 3 gills water to every pound of fruit. 1 lb. sugar to every pound of pulp. Wash the fruit, slice it up, putting it into water as prepared. Drain and put it into a preserving-pan with the above propor- tion of water, let it boil well until tender and reduced to a pulp. Kub through a hair sieve and allow 1 lb. of sugar to each pound of pulp. Stir over the fire until boiling, and boil for three-quarters of an hour until a little will set on a plate. Put into dry jars, tie down, and label.

298 KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK Poissons may be either plainly boiled or dressed fish. When two fish are served, the plain comes before the dressed. Dressed fish should be served in small pieces. Entries are served either before or after the releves. They consist of dressed or made dishes, usually composed of many ingredients. Entrees should always be served daintily. If two are served, one should be brown and the other white. The light entree comes first, the heavy one later. One may be cold and the other hot. Relevis.—This course, as a rule, consists of solid joints roasted, boiled, or braised. The garnish gives the charac- teristic name to each dish, and a vegetable is usually served with the remove. Sorbets or liquid ices are served after the remove. Pidti, consists of game or poultry. Sometimes when joints are served the remove is omitted. A salad is always served with the roti, and usually fried potatoes. Entremets.—This course usually consists of three things: (1) Dressed vegetables, which follow the roast, and often goes under the name of ‘Legume,’ and is served as a separate course. (2) Sweet entremets, which may be served either hot or cold. If two are served, one should be hot, the other cold. (3) Savouries, which precede the dessert, and are usually served hot. Cheese is often served. Care should be taken in compiling a menu to choose dishes which are in season, and to alternate the methods of cooking (<e.g., two fried dishes should not succeed one another), and the character of the dishes (e.g., a rich soup should be followed by a plain fish course). Oysters should never appear on the menu during the months of May, June, July, and August. The dishes should be varied as much as possible both in colour and taste. Well-known dishes should not have new names given to them.

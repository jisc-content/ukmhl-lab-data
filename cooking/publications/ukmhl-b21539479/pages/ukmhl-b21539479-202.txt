If skim milk is used a little butter should be added to supply the loss of cream. 3. Be careful to use very clean saucepans, moulds, pic-dishes, etc., and see that the oven is quite clean, as milk quickly absorbs any flavour. 4. Always add a little salt. 5. Essences used as flavourings, such as vanilla or almonds, should, where possible, be added after the pudding is cooked. 6. For baked puddings, to every pint of milk allow 2 oz. rice, sago, tapioca, macaroni, semolina, etc. For a mould or shape allow 3 oz. if serving cold, and 4 oz. when hot.

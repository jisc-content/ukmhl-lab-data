Points to be Remembered in making Salads. 1. Use the best oilâ€”Provence is one of the best. 2. Be very sparing with vinegar. The white wine is the best to use, and tarragon and chili vinegars are good for flavouring. 3. Green vegetables to be torn up, when possible, not cut. 4. Lettuces and cress to be well washed in salt and water, and dried thoroughly.

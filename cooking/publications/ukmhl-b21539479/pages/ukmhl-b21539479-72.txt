44 KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK see the difference between the tenderness of it when cooked at the different temperatures. Note.—Poultry-should be put into hot, not boiling, water, the fibres, being more delicate than in meat, are easily hardened. The rules for boiling salted or pickled meat and fish will be found under their respective headings. Rules for boiling Fresh Meat. 1. Wipe the meat with a damp cloth. If a neck or loin, see that it is well jointed. 2. Weigh it, and allow for beef and mutton a quarter of an hour to the pound, and a quarter of an hour over; for veal and lamb twenty minutes to the pound, and twenty minutes over; for pork twenty-five minutes to the pound, and twenty- five minutes over. For thin joints, such as neck of mutton, breast of veal, etc., this rule will not apply, as the thick- ness does not increase proportionally with the weight. Allow from two to two and a half hours for any weight over a pound. 3. Put the meat into boiling water with a teaspoonful of salt to every quart. 4. Bring to boiling-point and skim well. 5. Boil for five minutes — this is to harden the outside and keep in the goodness; then add a little cold water, and draw the saucepan to the side of the fire; simmer very gently till done. This is to prevent the albumen or fibrin from hardening. 6. When possible, cook meat in stock. It improves the flavour and enriches the stock. Keep the lid on the sauce- pan. 7. After skimming add vegetables, which are served with the meat. 8. Coat the meat 'with sauce before serving, and garnish with the vegetables.

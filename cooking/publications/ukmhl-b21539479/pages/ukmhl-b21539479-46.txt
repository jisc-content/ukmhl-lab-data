is KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK let it come well lip, and then simmer for ten minutes by the side of the fire, with the lid partly on. Strain through a hot teacloth. Aspic Jelly (2). 1 calf’s foot. 2 pennyworth of giblets. 2 quarts water. 1 teaspoonful salt. 12 peppercorns. 1 clove. 1 carrot. 1 turnip. 1 shallot. 3 sticks of celery. Bunch of herbs. Rind and juice of 1 lemon. £ gill malt vinegar. \ gill tarragon vinegar. 1 tablespoonful chilli vinegar. 1 gill sherry. J oz. gelatine. Whites and shells of 3 eggs. Blanch the calf’s foot, and cut in pieces. Clean the giblets. Put these, with the calf’s foot, into a saucepan, with the water and salt. Bring to boiling-point, skim well, add the vege- tables, peppercorns, herbs, and clove. Boil gently for five hours, skimming frequently. Strain through a hair sieve. When cold, remove all fat, put the stock into a saucepan, and if it is not a stiff jelly add the gelatine. Put in the lemon- juice, vinegars, the sherry, the whites of eggs slightly beaten, and the shells broken up. Clear (as in No. 1). Clarified Fat. Cut the fat into small pieces, and put them into a saucepan with enough water to cover. Boil rapidly with the lid on for five or ten minutes to soften and whiten the fat. Remove the lid, and continue the boiling until all the water has evaporated, when the liquid will be clear instead of milky in appearance. Stir occasionally to prevent the pieces of fat from adhering to the bottom of the saucepan, which causes a good deal of spluttering. Gradually the pieces will render down, leaving little pieces of shrivelled skin and clear oil or fat. Allow this to cool for a few minutes, then strain into a tin. This fat when cold should be nearly as white as lard, and free from a meaty flavour. It will be found most useful for frying purposes, also for pastry and plain cakes. It is an excellent way of using up superfluous fat or suet.

Stewing is cooking very slowly in a small quantity of liquid. By this method the toughest meats may be rendered tender and digestible, and also very savoury. The secret is long, slow cooking. The process is sometimes confused with boiling, but it is almost the reverse. In boiling we aim at softening the meat while retaining all its juices, and the hot water acts merely as a medium for conveying the heat. In stewing the juices are more or less extracted, and form with the water the liquid in which the meat is softened, and the gravy with which it is served. The meat, being partly cooked in its own juices, is more savoury. In boiling we plunge the meat into boiling water to close up the pores and keep in the juices. In stewing we use cold or warm liquid, in order to draw out some of the juices before sealing up the pores. In many cases the meat is lightly fried before stewing; this prevents the loss of so much of the red juice when put into the warm water, it also makes the stew more savoury and a better colour. In some cases the separation of the juices is the sole object, as in beef-tea, soups and stocks. The meat is finely cut up, in order to expose more of its surface to the water. It is then put into cold water, and brought very slowly to boiling-point, and stewed until all the juices are extracted ; in this case the meat is of no value.

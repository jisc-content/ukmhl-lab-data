CHAPTER XYII AFTERNOON TEAS For afternoon tea there are many dainty cakes and sand- wiches which may be served with a choice of tea and coffee, and so prevent monotony. The tea should only be allowed to infuse for three minutes; it should be made with quite boiling water to insure the full flavour being extracted. Water that has boiled twice will quite spoil it. The cream should be fresh from the dairy; the preserved cream sold in jars is too thick, and imparts a disagreeable flavour to the tea. Coffee is often served as well for those who may not care for tea. Thin brown and white bread and butter is cut; if liked it may be rolled. Sandwiches of preserve may be cut into rounds or fancy shapes. White tin bread one day old is the best for cutting thinly, as fresh bread is liable to crumble ; but brown bread is nicer new. Milk and rasped rolls are better new; these are a change sometimes from the ordinary loaf. As some people do not care for sweet cake, savoury sand- wiches will prove a welcome addition to the tea-table. Sandwiches should be cut into small triangles or squares, dished lightly on a clâ€™oylcy, and garnished with cress. Sardine and cress sandwiches should be made with brown bread and butter; shrimp sandwiches are nicest made from milk or rasped rolls; watercress and cucumber and tomato

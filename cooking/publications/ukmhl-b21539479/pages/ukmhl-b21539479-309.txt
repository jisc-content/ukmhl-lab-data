CHAPTER XV PRESERVES AND PICKLES Notes and Rules on Preserving. For preserve to keep well, it is necessary that a large propor- tion of the water in the fruit should be evaporated. Therefore it is better to cook it quickly; also, the jam will be a bad colour if long in making. The fruit should be picked in dry weather, or the jam is likely to become mouldy. Crushed loaf is the best sugar to use. The quantity depends somewhat upon the fruit, and varies from f lb. to 1 lb. for each pound of fruit. A copper preserving-pan is not so liable to burn as an enamelled pan, but it must be kept quite bright. Rules. 1. Preserve the fruit as soon as possible after gathering. 2. Have a clear fire or gas-stove. 3. Allow room in the preserving-pan for the jam to boil well. 4. Keep the jam at a gentle heat until the sugar has dis- solved. 5. Use a wooden spoon for stirring. 6. Allow the jam to boil quickly, taking care that it does not burn, as sugar burns easily. 7. Stir frequently and skim well.

PREFACE VI art in the young housewife has been not seldom the cause of a good deal of misery in the home. As regards the special points of the book, I have sought in my arrangement, as far as possible, to educate readers to think for themselves by giving them principles and rules by which to work. With this object in view, I have given the founda- tions in most cases separately, and in cakes the principal methods of mixing also. If these are thoroughly learnt, all cake-making will be much simplified. This applies also in the case of soups and sauces. I think the appendices will be found useful, and also the chapter on afternoon teas, especially now that this form of entertainment is such a favourite one. Although written in the first instance for my pupils here, I have every reason for hoping that this book will find its way, not only into many other secondary schools where cookery is taught, but into domestic circles, where a simple and practical manual is always welcome.

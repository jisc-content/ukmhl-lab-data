148 KING EDWARD’S COOKERY BOOK Flavouring butters are added to sauces by whisking in a little at a time after the sauce is made. This restores to the sauce the flavour of butter that it would lose during long cooking. If added too quickly the sauce will become oily- looking, and whilst the butter is being added the saucepan should be lifted from the fire. Sauces may be strained through a fine strainer, or by means of a tammy cloth. Tammy cloth costs about 2s. per yard, and one cloth will last for a considerable time. A sauce that has been tammied is of a much smoother con- sistency ; it is also a less wasteful method. To reduce a sauce, allow it to boil quickly with the lid off the saucepan. Foundation or White Sauce. 2 oz. butter. I 1 pint milk. 2 oz. flour. | Pinch of salt.

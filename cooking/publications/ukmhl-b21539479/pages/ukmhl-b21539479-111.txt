CHAPTER IY COLD MEAT COOKERY In this section will be found many excellent ways of using up cold meat and producing very savoury dishes. As warmed-up meat has less flavour than freshly-cooked meat, good gravy or stock should be used, and special care taken in seasoning. There is often some jellied gravy under the dripping, which is the essence of meat, and may be used to advantage. Trimmings of game, poultry, pickled beef, ham and tongue will also assist. Herbs, essence of ai cho /y, and mace may be used in small quantities. Uncooked flavourings, such as onion, tomato, and mush- rooms, must be cooked before mixing with the meat. The most important point to remember is that the meat is already cooked, and only needs rewarming. Underdone meat is preferable for cold meat cookery. For Scotch eggs, rissoles, croquettes and minces the meat is passed through a mincing-machine or chopped very finely, and then mixed with a sauce made of butter, flour and stock, or good gravy. This sauce must be well cooked before adding it to the meat. Rissoles and croquettes should be moist and creamy inside, to effect which it is necessary to add enough sauce to make the mixture to the right consistency while hot, then to allow it to cool, when it will become firm enough to shape. On reheating the sauce is liquefied, producing the creaminess we desire. 6-2

84 KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK For a hash the meat should he added to the sauce an hour or more before serving, in order that it may become well flavoured and softened, taking care it does not boil. It is safer to use a double saucepan or bain-marie, or stew-jar placed in boiling water. Poached eggs are a nice garnish for minces, especially those made of veal. Boi'ders of rice and macaroni may also be used. Rules for warming up Cooked Meat 1. Trim away any gristle and most of the fat. 2. Use good gravy or stock. 3. Season well. 4. Cook raw vegetables, such as onion, mushroom, etc., in a little butter before adding them to the meat. 5. Only reheat the meat; do not cook it again. 6. For a hash, mince, or curry use a double saucepan or bain-marie after the meat is added, and let it remain in the sauce for an hour or so before serving. 7. For croquettes, etc., put the meat mixture on to a plate, make it into a flat cake, and leave until cold, then divide into equal portions and shape. 8. When vermicelli is used for coating, crush it finely. 9. For a mince, chop the meat in preference to passing it through a mincing-machine. To egg and crumb, see ‘Rules on Frying,’ also ‘How to fry Parsley.’ Foundation Sauce for Cold Meat Cookery. Flavouring of onion, shallot, mushroom, etc. Butter. Flour. Stock or good gravy.

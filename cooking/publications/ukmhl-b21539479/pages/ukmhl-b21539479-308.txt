White Wine Whey. \ pint milk. 1 wineglassful slierry. 1 teaspoonful sugar. Put the milk on the fire. When boiling add the sherry, stir, strain, and add sugar. It should bo taken very hot. Oatmeal Porridge. \ lb. coarse Scotch oatmeal. 1 quart boiling water. Salt. Have the salted water quite boiling in the saucepan, sprinkle in the oatmeal, stirring well with a wooden spoon. Cook for about ten minutes, stirring all the time; then put on the lid of the saucepan, cook gently for three hours or longer. Stir from time to time, turn into a basin, and it is ready to warm up the next morning. Serve with hot or cold milk or cream. N.B.â€”A double enamelled saucepan is convenient for making porridge, as the inside only can be used at first to boil up the water and to cook the oatmeal until it has thickened. It can then be put inside the other, with water underneath, and cooked for three hours, and there is no danger of the porridge burning.

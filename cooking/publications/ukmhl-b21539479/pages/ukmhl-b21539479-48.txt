20 KING EDWARD’S COOKERY BOOK Fish is highly nitrogenous, and a good brain food. It con- tains a much higher percentage of water than butcher’s meat, and is therefore not such a highly concentrated food. Notes and Rules for baking Fisn. This is one of the nicest ways of cooking fish, as none of the flavour is lost and it is neither rich nor watery. The fish may be first seasoned, coated with egg and crumbs, and baked to resemble fried fish. Or placed on a well-buttered tin, seasoned and covered closely with buttered paper, and baked to resemble steamed or boiled fish. A more delicate way is to place the fish between two buttered plates. Rules.—1. Crumbs to be freshly made, and browned in the oven before using. 2. Well wash and dry the fish. 3. Do not overcook. It can be tested by piercing with a skewer. Rules for boiling Fish. 1. Well clean the fish and weigh it. 2. Have only just enough hot water to cover it. 3. Allow 2 oz. salt and 2 tablespoonfuls vinegar to every gallon of water. 4. Skim well. 5. Cook very gently until tender. 6. Allow six minutes to the pound for cod, haddock, hake, etc., and ten minutes for very large cod, salmon, turbot or halibut. Small fish, such as whiting, from six to ten minutes. 7. Put all fish, except salmon, into hot water, as boiling would crack the skin, and cold would draw the goodness out. Salmon must be put into boiling water to preserve its colour. 8. Drain well and place on a hot dish on a d’oyley with a strainer underneath; garnish with parsley and lemon, and serve with a suitable sauce. Steaming is a better way of cooking fish; it loses less of its flavour and nourishment.

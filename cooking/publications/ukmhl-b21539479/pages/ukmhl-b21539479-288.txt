CHAPTER XIII ICINGS Rules for Icing. 1. Pass the icing-sugar through a hair-sieve, taking care that the sieve and spoon are perfectly clean. 2. Strain lemon-juice before using. 3. For butter icing use the best fresh butter. J 4. If butter icing becomes too soft in mixing, leave it to cool before using. 5. Take care not to let any cake-crumbs, etc., fall into the icing; they stop up the forcers, causing loss of time and un- necessary trouble. 6. Keep the icing covered over after it is made, with a wet cloth to prevent the surface from getting dry. 7. Mix glace icing smoothly before warming, and do not let it get very hot, as it loses its shiny appearance. 8. Before using test the consistency by lifting it up on the back of a wooden spoon. More sugar or liquid may be added as required. 9. Icing that is left over should be put into a jar and covered closely for future use. 10. Wash and dry the icing-bags and forcers directly they are done with. 11. For a rich cake that requires keeping for some weeks before it is cut, it is best to give it one coating of icing as soon as it is baked and cold, to keep in the richness, and not to finish icing and decorating until a day or so before it is wanted, in order that it may be as white as jrassible.

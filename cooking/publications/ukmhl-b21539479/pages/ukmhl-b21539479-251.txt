In 'flaky the flour is mixed into a paste, and the butter spread all over. It is then folded up many times, thus form- ing when baked a number of layers or flakes. In rough puff the butter is cut into large pieces, and mixed with the flour. In puff the flour is mixed into a smooth paste, and after being rolled out the butter is placed in the centre and wrapped up, and then rolled out with the paste, forming large flakes of fat.

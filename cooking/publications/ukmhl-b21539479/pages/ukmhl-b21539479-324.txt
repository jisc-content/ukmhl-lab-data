296 KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK sandwiches are most acceptable in the summer, being cool and refreshing. The yolk of a hard-boiled egg pounded with a little butter and anchovy or bloater paste is a very good mixture for sand- wiches. If sandwiches are cut some time before they are wanted, a damp cloth placed over them will keep them per- fectly fresh. Small scones, potato cakes, pikelets, tea cakes, etc., buttered and served hot are suitable for the cold weather. There is such a variety of cakes and biscuits that, with a little care and forethought, the tea-table may be made very attractive. Fingers of rich cake, crisp biscuits, small iced cakes, shapes of almond paste, little cakes, all give a light and attractive appearance. They may be mixed or served separately, and only a few of each kind should be used. Itccipes for these will be found elsewhere. In summer iced tea is sometimes served. This is prepared by making a quantity of tea several hours before it is wanted. After the tea has infused for three minutes it should be poured off, a little lemon-juice added, and allowed to get perfectly cold. Serve with ice and thin slices of lemon. See Beverages.

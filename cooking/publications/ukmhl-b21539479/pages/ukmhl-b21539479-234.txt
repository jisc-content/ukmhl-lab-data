KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK 206 Notes and Pules on Creams. There are three types of creams : 1. Whole creams—those made entirely of cream. 2. Fru#t creams, consisting of cream and a puree of fruit. 3. Custard creams, made of custard and cream. In each case the cream is whipped first. There is no diffi- culty in doing this in the winter, providing the cream is thick, but in hot summer weather it is apt to become buttery. It should be whipped in a cold place, and not too quickly. Use only enough gelatine to insure the cream turning out. Whole creams will set with less gelatine than fruit or custard creams. They should not be turned out of the moulds until they are wanted. Put them in a very cold place—on ice if possible. They are easier to turn out if the moulds are masked with clear jelly. This can be set with some suitable decoration, such as gold-leaf, fruit, or nuts. To mask a mould, stand it on icc, pour in enough jelly to cover the bottom; when set pour in a little more, and turn the mould slowly round and round on the icc until the sides are coated. Arrange the decoration tastefully, and set it with more jelly. Tinned copper moulds will be found best for moulding jellies and creams. They are easier to unmould than china ones. Rules. 1. Use double cream (i.e., cream that has stood on the milk for twenty-four hours), unless separated by machinery. 2. Mask the mould with clear jelly, and set it with some suitable decoration. If gold or silver leaf is used it must be mixed with a little jelly. 3. Whisk the cream in a cold place until it clings to the whisk. 4. For fruit creams rub the fruit through a hair sieve with the sugar. Some fruit requires stewing first. 5. Use very little gelatine—about 1, oz. to a pint in the summer, and less in the winter.

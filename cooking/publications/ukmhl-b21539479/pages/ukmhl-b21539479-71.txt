CHAPTER III MEAT Notes and Rules on boiling Meat. Boiling is one of the easiest ways of cooking, and the secret of success is in allowing plenty of time and cooking very slowly. Meat should be fresh. Very fat joints are unsuitable for boiling. The best joints are generally reserved for roasting, while the more gelatinous and sinewy parts are used for boiling. The moist heat softens, and to a great extent dissolves, the gelatine, which dry heat would render hard and indigestible. Our object is to soften the fibres while retaining all the juices. When meat is put into boiling water, the sudden change to a paler colour shows that the albumen on the sur- face has coagulated. In this way the outside of the meat is hardened, thus preventing the escape of the red juices. If cooked at 212째 F. (boiling-point) the whole of the albumen in the meat would become hard and leathery, rendering the meat very tough. This is why it is necessary to cook at a lower temperature after the meat is once hardened on the out- side. Five minutes is long enough to accomplish this hardening process. After that it should be kept at a temperature of 180째 to 200째 F., which is known as simmering-point. In simmering, the water should barely move at one side of the saucepan, and not gently bubble all over, as this would register 212째, as in more violent bubbling. There is no better way of showing the reason for this than to take an egg and

KING EDWARDâ€™S COOKERY BOOK 110 {Enough for 4 persons.) Pigeon Pie. 4 pigeons, 1 lb. beefsteak. Bay-leaf. Thyme. Shallot (chopped). Pepper and salt. 2 oz. butter. 1 tablespoonful flour. 4 yolks of hard-boiled eggs. Puff pastry (see p. 225). Good gravy or stock (made with poultry trimmings or giblets). (Sufficient for 8 persons.) Prepare, singe, and draw the pigeons. Cut them in half, or, if large, into quarters. Cut the steak into small pieces. Season with the chopped bay-leaf, thyme and shallot, salt and pepper. Fry lightly in the butter, sprinkle over the flour. Put all into a pie-dish, cut the yolks of eggs in halves and put on the top. Pour in enough good gravy to half fill the dish, cover with puff pastry. Bake about two hours. If the pie is to be eaten cold, after taking it out of the oven fill up the dish with some good stock or gravy in which some gelatine has been dissolved. These birds may be drawn or not, as preferred. Truss into shape, spread with butter, and place a vine-leaf on the breast of each, and over the leaf a piece of bacon. Fasten with a skewer. Boast before a quick fire for about twenty minutes, basting well with butter. Remove the bacon and vine-leaves, brush over with good meat glaze. Serve on hot buttered toast, garnished with watercress. Serve with fried bread- crumbs and gravy. Roast Quails. 4 quails. Butter. Bacon. Glaze. Buttered toast. Watercress. Fried breadcrumbs.

46 KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK and this method of frying is not as extravagant as it appears, for the same fat can he used again and again if care be taken not to let it burn. Success depends largely upon the temperature being right. If there is any water in the fat, it will begin to bubble directly it reaches 212°. After a time the bubbling ceases, and as the fat reaches a higher temperature a faint blue smoke wiil be seen rising from it. Soon after this the fat begins to smoke a little, and is ready for use. If left on the fire without using it will burn. If in doubt as to the temperature, test by’ throwing in a small piece of white bread. If it browns quickly the fat is ready. It is dangerous to leave the fat on an open fire unless there are bars for the pan to rest upon. Rules for Frying. 1. Have everything as dry as possible, and coated with flour, batter, or egg and crumbs. 2. Have the fat smoking hot—about 3-85° F. 3. Drain everything on paper after frying to absorb the fat. 4. After using deep fat, allow it to cool before straining for future use, or the great heat will melt the strainer. 5. Keep the fat used for frying fish for that only. To Egg and Crumb.—Beat up the egg in a soup plate, put the breadcrumbs on a piece of paper. Use a small brush for the egg, and be careful to brush well all over, or the crumbs will not stick. Lift out of the egg with a knife into the middle of the crumbs, and move the paper from side to side until the fish or meat is coated. When the egging and crumbing arc finished, wipe the knife, and use it to press the crumbs on firmly to prevent any loose ones from falling into the fat. To fry Parsley.—Choose fresh parsley, wash it, and put in on a sieve to dry ; then put it in a frying-basket. Allow the fat to cool after frjdng the meat, fish, etc., then put in the parsley, and fry until crisp. Do not let it get brown. Drain on paper.

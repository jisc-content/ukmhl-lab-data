109 POULTRY AND GAME the legs, chopping off the claws ; truss for roasting, tic a piece of fat bacon over the breast, and cook for about one hour, basting frequently with the butter; remove the bacon and untruss. The pheasants should be placed on the crohtons or buttered toast, and garnished with watercress. Serve with bread sauce, red currant jelly, fried crumbs, and good gravy made from the giblets of the pheasants, and some stock made from poultry or game trimmings. For Fried Breadcrumbs.—Make some white breadcrumbs, put some butter into an enamelled stewpan; when melted put in the crumbs, and stir over the fire until they begin to brown. Put them on tissue or blotting paper in the oven for a few minutes. Serve on a d’oyley. Braised Pigeons. 2 pigeons. Flour. Butter. \ lb. raw bacon. 1 carrot. 1 turnip. 1 stick of celery. \ small onion. 1 bunch of herbs. 1 pint stock. [Enough for 4 persons.) Draw and truss the pigeons, dip in flour and fry in butter. Cut the bacon in dice. Scrape the carrots and peel the turnips, and cut out some fancy shapes from each with a vegetable-cutter. Put the trimmings into a stewpan with the celery, onion and herbs, pour in the stock. Bring to boiling- point, put in the pigeons, cover them with buttered paper, put on lid of stewpan, and cook gently for three-quarters of an hour if large pigeons, half an hour for small ones. Lift them out on to a tin, brush over with glaze, put the bacon on the tin, and put it into the oven for ten minutes. Strain the stock, and let it boil very rapidly with the lid off, until reduced to about 1|- gills; keep it well skimmed. Boil the fancy vegetables in a little salt and water for fifteen minutes. Put the pigeons on to a hot dish, remove string, strain over the sauce, garnish with little heaps of bacon and vegetables.

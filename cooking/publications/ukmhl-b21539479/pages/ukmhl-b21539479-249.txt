CHAPTER XI BREAD AND PASTRY Rules for Bread-making. 1. For a good home-made loaf use household flour; it is more nourishing and makes a moister loaf. 2. For milk rolls and fancy bread use pastry flour; it is lighter. 3. Use good, fresh German yeast; it should be pale in colour, breaking cleanly, and not sticky. 4. Use tepid water for mixing. To get this take one-third of boiling water to two-thirds of cold. 5. Use a warm pan, and keep the dough at an even temperature. 6. Knead well. 7. Let the dough rise well before making it into loaves. 8. Have a very hot oven at first, allowing it to cool down gradually. 9. Time the bread, allowing one hour for a half-quartern loaf, and from one and a quarter to one and a half hours for a quartern. 10. For tin bread the dough should be left to rise for ten minutes after it is put into the tins before baking. 11. Bread should be turned upside down when it comes out of the oven.

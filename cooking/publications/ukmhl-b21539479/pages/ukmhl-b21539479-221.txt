PUDDINGS AND SWEETS 193 N.B.â€”A quicker way of forming apple dumplings : Instead of rolling out the pastry divide it into as many pieces as you have apples, and work an apple into each. Bakewell Tart. Rougli puff pastry (see p. 225), J quantities in recipe. 2 tablespoonfuls jam. 1 egg, its weight in Butter. Sugar, and Flour. Pinch of salt. 4 teaspoonful baking-powder. Glace icing (J quantities in recipe). Line a tin plate 9 inches in diameter with the puff pastry, work up the edges, spread the middle with jam. Cream the butter and sugar well together, add the egg and a little of the flour in which the baking-powder and salt have been mixed, beat well, add the rest of flour. Spread this mixture over the jam. Bake for about half an hour in a good oven, then pour the glace icing over the top. Blackberry Tart. 4 oz. flour.

Fill with the black- berries, whip the cream, add one tcaspoonful of castor-sugar, and pile on the tart when cold. 13

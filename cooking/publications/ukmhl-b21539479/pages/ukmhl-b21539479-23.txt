INTRODUCTION SCULLERY WORK Too great care cannot be taken of the utensils we use for cooking; they must be kept scrupulously clean and bright, or they will be liable to cause disease. All utensils must be carefully washed in hot water to which a little soda has been added; the soda by softening the water removes grease more effectually. No soda must be used, however, when scrubbing boards and tables or anything wooden, as the soda discolours wood; this is only allowable when the wood is very greasy : a little must then be added. Copper Saucepans, Moulds, etc.—These must be washed in soda water, and the inside cleaned with soap and silver- sand. Clean the outside with a few drops of vinegar mixed with salt and a little sand; this makes the copper a good colour. Einse quickly and clean all over with soap and sand to prevent it from tarnishing. Einse again and dry with a hot swab wrung out very tightly, then polish with a leather and whiting, using a brush for the crevices. Tins, Steel Stewpans, Patty-pans, Baking-sheets, etc.—Wash these in soda water, cleaning them inside and out with soap and sand. Einse thoroughly, dry with a swab, and polish with a leather and whiting. Skewers and Trussing-needles.—Wash these in soda water and polish with emery-paper. Iron Saucepans.—Clean the inside with soap and sand, and wipe the outside with a swab.

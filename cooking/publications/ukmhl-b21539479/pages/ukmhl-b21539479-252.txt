Use the finest flour, passing it through a sieve with the salt and baking-powder if used. 2. Keep everything as cold as possible. 3. For short crust the butter must be rubbed in with the tips of the fingers until it looks like breadcrumbs. 4. Use water sparingly, especially for short crust. 5. Mix with a knife. 6. Use very little flour in rolling, merely dusting the paste and board with a brush. 7. For glazing tarts use one white of egg and two teaspoon- fuls of water. Beat them up together slightly, brush over the pastry, and sift with castor-sugar. 8. Have a very hot oven for puff pastry, and a cooler one for short crust. 9. Do not take it out of the oven until quite cooked; it should then feel firm. 10. While the pastry is baking avoid opening the oven door wide, or shutting it quickly. Cold air or a sudden draught makes the pastry sink. 11. Pastry should always be left to cool in a warm, dry place. 12. Keep it in a dry and well-ventilated place. Mix the flour, salt, and cornflour together. Put the butter and water into a saucepan; when boiling stir in the flour. Cook well until it leaves the sides of the saucepan. Take off the fire, and beat in the eggs one at a time. Season or flavour as required. Rules for Pastry. Choux Pastry. \ lb. flour.

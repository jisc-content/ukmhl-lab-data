CHAPTER XII CAKES ? / Notes on Cake-making. The two most important points in cake-making are the mixing and the baking. The four chief ways of mixing are as follows : 1. Rub the fat into the flour, then add all the dry ingre- dients, then pour all the liquid in at once, only stirring just long enough to mix all together. This method is generally used for plain cakes. 2. Cream the butter and the sugar together, then beat in the eggs one at a time with a little of the flour, and stir in all the dry ingredients. This method is used for rich cakes. 3. Beat the sugar and eggs together until light and stiff, then mix in the flour lightly. This method is used for sponge and other light cakes. 4. Warm the sugar, butter, and treacle together, add this mixture to the dry ingredients, with the rest of the liquid, as in gingerbread. In cakes where the lightness depends chiefly on the baking- powder (as in No. 1) care must be taken, that they are put into the oven as soon as possible after the liquid is added. In cakes where the butter and sugar are creamed together, the baking-powder may be omitted if the mixture is well beaten by hand for twenty minutes or more 15â€”2

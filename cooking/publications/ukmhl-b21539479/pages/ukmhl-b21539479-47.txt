CHAPTER II FISH Choose fish which is in season; it is more wholesome, and has a finer flavour. Choose very fresh fish, as it soon deteriorates and becomes unwholesome. When fresh the flesh is firm and a good colour, the eyes bright, and gills red. The skin of haddock, whiting and smelts is silvery, and shiny when fresh. The red spots on plaice are bright and distinct, but gradually fade as the fish becomes stale. Plenty of scales are a good sign. The smell is one of the best tests. Fish must be carefully and thoroughly cleaned before cooking. The blood near the backbone must all be removed, and the yellow part near the head ; it has a bitter flavour. The black skin from the inside of cod, haddock, and other fish can be removed by rubbing with salt. It must not be left in water to soak, as it destroys the flavour and makes the fish sodden. The fins and tails should be trimmed off, except the fins of turbot, which are considered a delicacy. White fish is the lightest and most digestible for invalids, especially whiting, soles, and plaice; in these the fibre is very tender. Oily fish, such as salmon, herrings, and mackerel, contain more nourishment, but are more difficult to digest. 2â€”2

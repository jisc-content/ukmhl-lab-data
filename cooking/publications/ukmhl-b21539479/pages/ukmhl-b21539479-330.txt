CHAPTER XIX NOTES ON CHEESE Cheese is served after the sweet entremets. It is not easy of digestion, but a small quantity taken at the end of a meal aids digestion. Cheese is the curd of milk dried. The milk is slightly heated, then the curd is separated from the whey by the addition of an acid. The curd is then dried and pressed, a process that usually takes several months. Skimmed milk cheeses are very hard, and arc the most indigestible. Cheese made from new milk, with or without the addition of cream, is much softer, being usually known as ‘ fat ’ cheese. Stilton is the finest of English cheeses, but varies very much in quality, sufficient care not being taken whilst it is ripening. Gorgonzola and Wensleydale most resemble Stilton. Gor- gonzola has a strong and peculiar odour, Wensleydale is little known, only 200 of the cheeses being made annually in a little village of that name in Yorkshire. Sage cheese is made by mixing chopped sage with the curd before being dried. It is not often seen except in the country. Cheddar is one of the best-known cheeses. It is a mild cheese, and one of the least expensive. American cheeses are a little cheaper, and have a stronger flavour than English. Parmesan is a skimmed-milk cheese. It is very hard, and is much used grated in culinary preparations.

73 MEAT Steamed Leg of Mutton. Leg of mutton (8 lb.). 2 carrots. 2 turnips. 1 onion. 1 stick of celery, 1 pint caper sauco (see p. 148). Parsley. (Sufficient for 14 persons.) Wipe the meat with a damp cloth, cut off the shank-bone; prepare the vegetables, cut the carrot and turnip in quarters. If using a steamer, put the mutton in the upper vessel with the vegetables, and fill the under vessel with boiling water, and keep it boiling until the meat is done. The lid of steamer must be kept tightly on. Cook the meat for two and a half hours (see rules on steaming). When cooked lift out on to a hot dish, coat with sauce, garnish with the carrots and turnips and little pieces of parsley. Serve with the rest of the sauce in a tureen. N.B.—If you have no steamer, rest the leg on four jam- jars of an equal height (right side up), pour in enough boil- ing water to come three parts up the jars, put in the vege- tables, cover closely. If the lid is not a good fitting one put a folded cloth round the top of saucepan before putting on lid. Let the water boil all the time, adding more if necessary. Care must be taken that the saucepan does not boil dry.

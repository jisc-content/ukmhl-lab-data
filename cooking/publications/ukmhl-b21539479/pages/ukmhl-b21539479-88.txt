6o KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK Calf’s Head Pie. \ calf’s head. 12 peppercorns. 1 teaspoonful salt. 3 hard-boiled eggs. 1 lb. cooked ham. 6 sheets of gelatine. ^ lb. short crust. 1 pint aspic jelly. 1 carrot. 1 turnip. ^ onion. Prepare the head and cook for three hours, as in last recipes. When tender remove the bones and put them back into the saucepan, and leave them to stew for one or two hours. Skin the tongue, cut it in slices, also the head. Butter a deep pic-dish and decorate with the egg and some of the lean of the ham, cutting it into diamonds or fancy shapes; cut the rest of the ham into neat pieces. Now arrange the meat, remainder of ham and eggs in the dish in layers, until the dish is quite full. Pour in enough of the liquor to fill three-quarters of the dish, first dissolving in it the gelatine. Cover the dish with the crust, and bake for about one hour. When nearly cold fill up with stock. When cold and set take off the crust carefully, put it on to a dish top side up, turn the contents of the pie on to the crust, taking care not to break it. If the meat adheres too firmly to the dish, dip it into hot water, as you would a jelly. Garnish with the aspic jelly, chopped up. Serve with lemon salad. N.B.—The aspic jelly may be made from the remainder of the liquor that the head has been boiled in. Pepper. Soak the head all night, clean well, take out the brains, put them in salt and water. Tic the head in a cloth and cook in Calf’s Head (Stuffed). 1 calf's bead. 3 oz. suet (chopped). 4 lb. breadcrumbs. 1 tablespoonful chopped parsley. 1 lemon-rind (grated). 1 teaspoonful chopped herbs.

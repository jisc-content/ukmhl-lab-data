KING EDWARD'S COOKERY BOOK 9S 'When the breast feathers come out easily it is a sign that the bird is ready for plucking. For pheasants, another test is when the blood drops from the beak. Pheasants hang longer than partridges. Both require to be well cooked. Game, as a rule, should be slightly underdone. Wild duck is always served either with an orange or lemon salad, or with some accompaniment having orange or lemon as the characteristic flavour. A salad is usually served with game. Cranberry sauce or cranberry jelly is frequently served. The four usual adjuncts for game are : a good brown gravy, bread sauce, fried crumbs, potato chips, watercress being used as a garnish. Woodcock are never drawn, for the trail is considered a delicacy by gourmets. To tell when Birds are Young. Grouse, partridges, snipe, quails, and ortolans, when young have short round spurs. Old grouse and partridges have yello-w legs and dark bills. They are not good for roasting, but may be used for salmis, etc. AVoodcock when old have pointed spurs, and the feet hard and thick ; when young their spurs are blunt. AVhen the bills look soft and unsightly, and the throat muddy, it is always a sign that the birds have been killed long. In venison, when young, the fat is clear and bright. If hares have sharp claws, cars damp, and the cleft in the lip narrow, it is a sign that they are young. Notes on Poultry Drawing and Trussing.

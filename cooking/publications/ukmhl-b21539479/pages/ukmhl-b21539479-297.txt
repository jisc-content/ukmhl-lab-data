INVALID COOKERY 269 N.B.—This is more savoury, but not so suitable for some invalids. Raw Beef-tea. 4 oz. lean juicy steak. 1 gill water. Pinch, of salt. Scrape the meat, soak for two hours with a pinch of salt, strain, and put in a coloured glass. Beef Quenelles. 3 oz. lean juicy beef. 1 yolk of egg. 1 tablespoonful breadcrumbs. 1 tablespoonful beef-tea stock. Pepper and salt. Stock. Rounds of toast. (.Enough for 3 quenelles.) Scrape the meat down finely, keeping back all fat and skin, add to it the egg, breadcrumbs, beef-tea, pepper and salt, mix well; form into egg shapes with two dessertspoons, place them on a buttered frying-pan, not too close together, place the frying-pan on the stove, and pour some hot stock in very gently at one side, until the quenelles are about half covered; cover with a piece of buttered paper, and let them poach very slowly for ten minutes; lift out on to a clean cloth to drain. Serve on rounds of toast, with or without gravy. A little beef-tea may be poured round. N.B.—Chicken quenelles can be made in the same way by using chicken instead of beef. Black-Currant Tea. 1 large tablespoonful black-currant jam. 4 teaspoonful lemon-juice. £ pint boiling water. Put the jam into a jug, add the lemon-juice, pour over the boiling water, cover for a few minutes, strain.

CHAPTER IX OMELETS AND SOUFFLES Notes on Omelets. Omelets are composed chiefly of eggs, and may be either savoury or sweet. When cooked they should be of a pale- brown colour on the outside, and of a soft creamy consistency inside. The pan used for omelets should be of tinned iron or copper, and be kept for omelets only. The preparation of the pan is of the greatest importance It should not be washed, but cleaned by putting in a handful of salt, and placing the pan over the fire for a few minutes, until the salt begins to burn, then throwing it away and rubbing the pan with soft paper until it is bright. For savoury omelets a shallot cut in half and rubbed over the pan will give a delicious flavour. Directly the mixture is poured into the pan it should be stirred until it begins to set, when great care must be taken that it is folded and served before the eggs become overcooked. A few seconds too long will render the omelet tough and leathery. Savoury omelets are often served with a sauce. They are never served on a dish paper. Souffle omelets (sweet) may be. Omelets require practice, as it is only by observation and dexterity that one can become proficient in the making of them.

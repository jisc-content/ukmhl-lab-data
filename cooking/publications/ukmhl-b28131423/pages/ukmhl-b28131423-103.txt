Wine, Wort, &c., &c. i AL'COHOLS. In chemistry, a terra applied to several compounds by recent writers, from the analogy existing between their composi- tion, formulae, and chemical properties, and those of ordinary alcohol. They form a series presenting an unmistakable symmetry, the amount of oxygen continuing the same in each, whilst that of the hydrogen and carbon changes by well-marked gradations, as shewn below:— Methyl-alcohol {wood-spirit) . ^2 Ethyl-alcohol (ori/maryc/eoAo/) C4 Hg O2 Amyl-alcohol {fusel-oil) . . C^q Hj2 Og Capryl-alcohol Cjs Hjg Og Cetyl-alcohol . . • • • • C32 H34 ^2 &c., &c. j These alcohols are the hydrated oxides of their 1 respective radicals; and they yield pecidiar and analogous acids when submitted to the action of oxidising agents, which, with those named above, are respectively—formic acid, acetic acid, valeric acid, caprylic acid, cetylic acid, &c. See Alcohol, Aldehyde, &c. Alcohols. In commerce, pure spirits of a greater strength than about 58 0. p. (sp. gr. ’8335), or containing more than about 85g by WEIGHT, or 90§ by volume, of pure alcohol, are commonly so called. Alcohols.

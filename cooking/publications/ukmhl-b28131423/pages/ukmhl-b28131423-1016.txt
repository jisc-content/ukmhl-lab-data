It “ may almost be regarded as specific in psorophthalmia, in the purulent oph- thalmia of infants producing ectropium (ever- sion of the eyelids), and in ulcerations of the tarsi (edges of the eyelids).” (A. T. Thomson.) As a dressing to old ulcers, more especially those of a syphilitic character, it is superior to all the other ointments containing merciiry; I in sore legs, assisted by the internal use of the \pill of soap with opium (PIL. SAPONIS CUM opio), it often acts like a charm when all other modes of treatment have failed. For most of these purposes it should be diluted with from twice to seven times its w-eight of some simple fatty matter. One of the principal reasons why this ointment is in less general use than its merits deserve, is the very inferior quality of that vended in the shops under the name, arising from almost every druggist preparing some mess of his own, instead of adhering to the College formula?. Obs. Ointment of nitrate of mercury, faith- fully prepared according to the instructions in the Pharmacopoeia, possesses a rich golden-yel- low colour, and a buttery consistence, and keeps well. Unfortunately, clumsy and care-, less operators, wdio regard the Pharmacopoeia

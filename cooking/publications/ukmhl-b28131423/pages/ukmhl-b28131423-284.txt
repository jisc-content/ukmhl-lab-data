Qual, uses, 8fc. Its employment and value as food, and in the manufacture of malt, are well-known. It forms good wholesome bread, well adapted for persons who live luxuriously; but which, for the abstemious and the delicate, is inferior to that made of wheat, as it is rather less nutritious, and less easy of digestion, and commonly proves laxative to those unaccus- tomed to its use. Barley-flour and b.-meal are also more perishable than wheat-fiour; being very apt to acquire a hot nauseous taste, which even the heat of the oven does not remove. In a medical point of view, barley is regarded as the mildest and least irritating of the cereals. It has always been in high estima- tion as a demulcent and emollient. The decoc- tion (bar'ley-water), made with pearl barley, is a common and useful drink in inflamma- tory diseases, particularly in those of the chest I and urinary organs. Among the Ancients, decoctions of barley (icpiOr]) were the principal ^ aliments and melicines employed in acute ' diseases. See Gramine^, Food, Nutrition, &c. (also below). Cau'stic Barley.

That of commerce is usually made by steaming spring-barley, to soften the skin, then drying it, and grinding it in a mill with the stones set wide apart, so as to round and polish the grains, and to separate the whole of the husk except that left in the furrow of the seed. Scotch Pearl-barley and French barley, resemble the last, but are smaller, being generally made from winter-barley or bigg. Faro de Orzo is another variety made from sprat-barley. See Barley {above).

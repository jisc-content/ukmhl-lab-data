1220 SOLUTION. HYDRATE OE POTASSA, LlQHOB OP POTASSA,: Potash water, Caustic p. w. ; Liquor po- tass.® (Ph. L.), Aqua potass^e (Ph. E.), Potass.® caustics liquor (Ph. B.), Aqua KALI puRif, Lixivium SAPoxARiuMf, Aqua KALI CAUSTICUMf, LiXIVIUM CAUSTICUMf, L. Prep. 1. (Ph. L.) Lime (recently burnt), 8 oz.; boiling distilled ivaier, 1 gall.; sprinkle a little of the water on the lime in an earthen vessel, and, when it is slaked and fallen to powder, add of carbonate ofpotassa, 15 oz,, dis- solved in the remainder of the water; bung down, and shake frequently, until the mixture is cold, then allow the whole to settle, and decant the clear supernatant portion into per- fectly clean and well-stoppered green-glass bottles, Sp, gr. 1*063. It contains 6 7§ of pure potassa. 2. (Ph. E.) Carbonate of potassa (dry), 4 oz. j quicklime, 2 oz.; water, 45 fl, oz.; boiling briskly for a few minutes after each addition of the milk of lime; to yield at least 35 fl. oz., by decantation, after 24 hours’ repose in a deep, narrow, glass vessel. Sp. gr. 1*072. 3. (Ph. D.) Pure carbonate of potassa, 1 lb.; distilled water, 1 gall.; dissolve, heat the solu- tion to the boUing-point in a clean iron vessel, gradually add to it of fresh quicklime, 10 oz., previously slaked with water, 7 fl. oz., and continue the ebullition for 10 minutes, v/ith constant stirring; next allow it to cool out of contact with the air, and, when perfectly clear, decant it by means of a syphon, and bottle it as before. Sp. gr. 1*068. 4. (Wohler.) Nitrate of potassa, 1 part, is mixed, in alternate layers, with clippings of sheet copper, 2 or 3 jiarts, and then heated to moderate redness for about ^ an hour in a copper or iron crucible; when cold, the potassa is washed out with distilled water, and the solution, after repose in a closed vessel, de- canted as before. Not a trace of copper can be detected in the liquid. The clippings may be again used if mixed with a little fresh me- tallic copper. 5. {Wholesale.) From carbonate of potash (kali), 1 lb., and quicklime, ^ lb., to each gall, of water. 6. (Brandish’s alkaline solution; Li- quor POTASS^ Brandishii.) From American pear lashes, 6 lb.; quicklime and wood-ashes (from the ash), of each, 2 lb.; boiling water, 6 gall. {old, meas.); to each gall, of the clear product is added 12 or 15 drops of oil of juniper. This ‘solution’ is much asked for in trade. Or- dinary liquor of potassa is generally sold for it. 7. (Henry’s pure potassa water.) Sp, gr. 1*100. Two measures possess the same saturating powers as one of his carbonate op potassa water. Used in testing. Pur. “Nothing, or scarcely anything, is thrown down from this solution on the addi- tion of lime water; and when it has been first saturated by nitric acid, no precipitate falls on the addition of carbonate of soda, chloride of barium, or nitrate of silver. What is thrown down by bichloride of platinum is yellowis ’ (Ph. L.) Assay. 1. See Alkalimetry. 2.

Liquor of potassa is antacid, (• retie, resolvent, and lithontriptic. Dose. • to 30 or 40 drops, in any bland diluent (, acidulous); in heartburn, gout, calculi, indi • tions, scrofula, lepra, psoriasis, &c. Obs. Quicklime fails to abstract the ( • bonic acid from the alkaline carbonate? i solutions much stronger than those above - ferred to. Weaker solutions may, howe , be easily concentrated by evaporation in * i vessels. See Hydrate op Potassa, and be . Solution of Potas'sa (Effervescing).

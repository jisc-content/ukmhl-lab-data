The constantly ; [ recurring necessity in business and chemical :• 1 manipulations of determining the value of I mixtures, and of producing articles and pre- ; parations of different strengths or prices to , those already in stock, has rendered a ready I! means of making such calculations an indis- ^ pensable qualification in almost every depart- 1 ment of trade and industrial art. As we address ourselves to the intelligent operative 1 and busy tradesman, as well as to those more ( blessed by education and leisure, we feel we ‘ are bestowing a boon on many of our readers, in giving a short, but sufficient, outline of this useful branch of commercial arithmetic, which is most intimately connected with the objects of the present work. 1. To determine the price of a mixture from the value and quantity of each ingredient of which it is composed.—Rule. Divide the i ‘ gross value’ by the ‘ gross saleable’ or ^useful I quantity;’ the quotient is the value or cost per gallon, pound, &c., as the case may be.— Exampile. Required the value per gallon of a hogshead of wine containing— 5. d. 30 gallons 0 10 6 . . 20 „ „ 12 6 . . 13 „ „ 14 6 . . 63 [ Cost per gallon . . . I 2. To determine the proportions of sub- stances or articles of different values or strengths which must be taken to prepare a mixture of any other value or strength.—Rule. Arrange i the ‘prices’ br ‘strengths of the ingredients’ in a column, and link them together in pairs ; each of those ABOVE the required price being always connected with another BELOW it. Then set the difference between the required price and these numbers, alternately against those they are linked to ; when they will indicate the quan- tities to be taken, as in the following examples: —a. Required the proportions of tea at 3s., 4s., Gs., and 7s., that must be taken to produce a I mixture at 5s. the pound. Here— f3—I . . . . 1,0V lib. @ 3s. kJ 4 —I . . . . 2, ,, 2 „ „ 4s. 6~l. ! . . . . 2, „ 2 „ „ 6s. L7' . . . . 1, ,, 1 ,, ,, 7s. i b. (When the number of the ingredients or prices is odd.) Required the proportions of teas at 3s., 5s., and 6s. the pound, to sell at 4s. Here the odd number must be taken a I second time :— £ s. d. . 15 15 0 . 12 10 0 .986 ) 37 13 6 . 0 11 m p—j— . . . 1 + 2, or 3 lb. 0 3s. 4^ 5—1 I . . . . 1, „ 1 „ „ 5s. L6 ' . . . . 1, „ 1 „ „ 6». c. (When the number of the ingredients is not merely odd, but the prices are unequally distributed either above or below the required price.) A dealer having wines of the same name at 7s., 9s., 11s., 12s., and 14s. per gallon, wishes to produce a mixture of them worth 10s. per gallon :— 10 r 7--, 9-1-, I 11-'. .I 12 l.l 14 ' 1+4, or 5 gall. @ 7s. . 2, „ 2 „ „ 9s. . 3, „ 3 „ „lls. . 1, „ 1 „ „12s. . 3, „ 3 „ „14s. It will be seen that by varying the manner of linking the numbers, different answers may often be obtained to the same question. It also often happens that the dealer or operator desires to use a given quantity of one particular article, or to produce a certain quantity only of the mixture instead of those indicated by the above calculations. In these instances he has simply to apply the common rule of ‘ peac- tice" or the ‘ eule oe theee,’ as the parti- cular case may demand. In the above manner the proportions of the constituents of a compound may be determined from their specific gravity, when no change of volume has arisen from their admixture; but when this is the case, as in alloys, alcoholic mixtures, &c., it is either quite inapplicable or the results obtained are mere approximations to the truth. It may, however, be conveniently employed for calculations connected with the ‘ mixing’ and * reduction’ of spirits and other liquids, by substituting their per-centage value in ‘ proof gallons’ or other corresponding de- nomination, for the prices in the above ex- amples ; water, when introduced be reckoned, =0. Thus :—A spirit merchant having two puncheons of rum of the strengths of 17 and 21 o. p., wishes to know what proportions of each and of water he must take to form a spirit 10 u. p. The proof values of 100 gallons of these spirits are respectively equal to 121, 117, 90, and 0 (water) Therefore— r 0—I—I 27+31, or 58 g. water. 90^ 117—' . . 90, „ 90 „ rum @ 117 o. p. L121 ' . 90, „ 90 ;, rum „ 121 „ Suppose the dealer required to use different proportions of the spirits referred to, instead of equal measures, he has only to take such aliquot parts of the quantities thus found re- ferring to the smaller proportion; or such multiples of those referring to the larger one, as he wishes them to bear to each in the new mixture. Numerous other applications of this rule will occur to the ingenious reader. Questions in ‘alligation,’ as the depart- ment of arithmetic above referred to is called.

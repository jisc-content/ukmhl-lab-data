(Capt. Kater); the Englisli foot is taken at 62° Fahr. The true Icnqth of the metre, reduced to the latter temperature, is 39*370091 English inches; a number which varies from that in the table only at the fourth decimal figure. It will be perceived that the principle of nomenclature adopted in applying the names, was to prefix the Greek numerals to the decimal multiples, and the Latin numerals to the decimal subdivisions.

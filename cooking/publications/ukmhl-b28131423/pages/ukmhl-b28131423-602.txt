A very elegant jireparation. ^ fl. dr. added to 7 fl. dr. of water, forms 1 fl. oz. of a solution of equal strength to decoction of sarsaparilla of the Ph. L. Every fl. oz. represents the active principles of 2 oz. (= 2 oz. 85 gr., avoir.) of sarsaparilla root. In other words, it is twice as strong as the root, and IG times as strong as the decoction. 2. Alcoholic extract of sarsaparilla, 7 oz.; sherry, ^ pint; rectified spirit, 4 pint; dissolve, and filter. Strength as the last. 3. (Beral.)

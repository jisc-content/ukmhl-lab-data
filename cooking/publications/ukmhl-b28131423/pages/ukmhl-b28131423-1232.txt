These fluids are used for preserving ANATOMICAL PEEPAEATIONS, OBJECTS OP NA- TEEAL HISTOET, &c.,by immersing them there- in, in close vessels; or,, for temporary purposes, applying them by means of a brush or pieces of rag. The presence of corrosive sublimate is apt to render animal substances very hard. See PUTEEPACTION. Antisep'tic Solution. See above. Arsenical Solution. Syn.

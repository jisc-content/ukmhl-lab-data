These, with few excep- tions, are made of very pure, fusible, highly transparent, and dense glass, usually termed ‘ PASTE ^ or ‘ STEASS,’ which is generally formed of oxide of lead, potassa, and silica, with small [ quantities of other ingredients to increase the brilliancy and clearness. The characteristic tints are imparted by the addition of metallic oxides. The beauty of artificial stones and gems depends, chiefly, upon the tint of the real stones being exactly imitated, and upon proper care and skill being exercised in the cutting, polishing, and mounting them. All the coloured glasses, and enamels, may be I worked up into artificial gems. Sec Enamels, ! Pastes, &c. 1 GENE'VA. See Gin and Hollands. i j GENTIAN. Syn. Gentiana (Pli. L. E. & j I D.), L.

TINCTURE. 1277 , even in doses of a few fluid drachms, acts more powerfully on thelivi ig system than the prin- ciples it holds iivsolution; and, when continued for some time, produces the same deleterious effects as the habitual use of ardent spirits. When the action of a substance is the reverse of stimulant, it cannot with propriety be exhi- bited in this form, unless the dose be so small that the operation of the spirit cannot be taken I into account, as with the narcotic tinctures. \ Hence, this class of remedies are in less fre- quent use than formerly. The following list embraces all ihe formulae of the TINCTUE.S: of the three Pharmacopoeias, with a few others likely to be useful to the reader. These will furnish examples for the preparation of others in less general use, care being had to proportion the ingredients with due reference to the proper or usual dose of i tinctures of that class. j Tincture of Ac'etate of I'ron.

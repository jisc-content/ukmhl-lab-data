It has the same saturating power as is CAEBONATE OF SODA WATEE. Used in 3sting. Obs. The strength of a solution of caustic ida may be determined from its density, and, lore correctly, by its saturating power. See lkalimetet, and the following Table.

Ucarbonate of soda, 1 dr.; distilled water, pint; dissolve, and force carbonic acid gas ito the solution, under pressure. Used as an ntacid and grateful stimulant, often proving ently laxative. The soda watee of the shops jmnot be substituted for this preparation, as, ji opposition to its name, it is usually made ithout soda. Sol'dering Solution. Prep. Dissolve zinc in ydrochloric acid nearly to saturation, add -5th part of powdered sal ammoniac, and sim- ler for 5 minutes. Used to make solder flow isily and take well; applied with a feather, ee SOLDEEING. Specific Solution (Frank’s). Syn. Specific 3LDTION OF COPAIBA ; LiQUOE COPAIB.E ILKAlina, L. Prep. Take of balsam of co- paiba, 2 parts; liquor of potassa (Ph. L.), 3 parts; water, 7 parts; boil the mixture for 2 or 3 minutes, put it into a separator, and allow it to stand for 5 or 6 days ; then draw it olF from the bottom, avoiding the upper stratum of oil, and to the clear liquid add of siveet spirit of nitre (perfectly free from acid), 1 part; should it turn foul or milky, a very little liquor of potassa will usually brighten it; if not, place it in a clean separator, and let it stand, closely covered, for a few days, and then draw it off from the bottom as before, when it will he perfectly transparent, without filtering. Some persons add the sweet spirit of nitre whilst the solution is still warm, mix it in as rapidly as possible, and immediately cork or fasten up the vessel. This is a good way when the article is wanted in a hurry, but is ob- jectionable from the loss of spirit thereby occa- sioned, and the danger, without care, of burst- ing the separator. Obs. A receipt for this article, upon the authority of Battley, has been going the round of the pharmaceutical works for many years. It is as follows:—“ Take 12 oz. of balsam of copaiba, and 6 oz. of calcined magnesia; rub together, add a pint of proof spirit, filter, and then add ^ oz. of sweet spirits of nitre.’^ (‘ Gray’s Supplement.’) The product of this formula, utterly unlike ‘ Feank’s Specific Solution,’ is a colourless tincture, scarcely flavoured with copaiba, and holding very little of the active matter of the balsam in solution, owing to the compound formed with the mag- nesia being insoluble in spirit. Such is the affinity of this earth for copaiba (copaibic acid), that it will even take it from caustic potassa. See Copaiba, and its preparations. Solution of Subac’etate of Lead. Syn.

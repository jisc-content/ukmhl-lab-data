The alum-stone of Mont d’Or contains, according to Cordier, l*4g of oxide of iron. The presence of lime in alum-ore is most prejudicial, owing to its affinity for sulphuric acid being greater than that of either alumina or iron. Ores containing it in any quantity are, therefore, unfitted for the manufacture of alum. Magnesia is also prejudicial; hut in this case, the sulphate of magnesia left in the mother-liquors is not wholly valueless, as it may he crystallised and sold as ‘ Epsom-salt,’ —a thing which is actually done in some English alum-works. The potash-salt employed by the alum- makers is either the sulphate or the chloride— chiefly the latter ; its sources being the waste liquor of soap-works, saltpetre refineries, and glass-houses. Wood-ashes, though rich in potash, do not answer well unless freed by llxiviation from the large amount of carbonate of lime which is always present in them. The ammonia-salt used in making alum is generally the crude sulphate prepared from the waste ammoniacal liquor of gas-works, or that from the manufacture of sal-ammoniac by the destructive distillation of animal matter. Both these liquors may he used without previous conversion into sulphate of ammonia whenever there is an excess of sul- phuric acid in the aluminous solution. Soda-salts are seldom, if ever, used as pre- cipitants in the manufacture of alum, on account of the easy solubility of the resulting SODA-ALLM—a property which unfits them for this purpose.

This is an alum in which the ‘ sulphate of potassa ’ is replaced by an equivalent of a like salt of ammonia. It is prepared by adding crude sulphate of ammonia to solution of sulphate of alumina ; or gas-liquor, putrid urine, 8fc., to the acid-sulphate. The per-centage composition of ammonia- alum is— Ammonia 3*75 Alumina 11*34 Sulphuric acid .... 35*29 Water 49*62 100* Much of the common alum, especially that prepared on the Continent, contains both potash and ammonia; and recently, enormous works for its manufacture have been established in England. As an astringent, and as a source of alumina in dyeing, it resembles potash-alum {i.e. ordinary alum). It may, however, he readily distinguished from the latter by the fumes of ammonia which are evolved when it

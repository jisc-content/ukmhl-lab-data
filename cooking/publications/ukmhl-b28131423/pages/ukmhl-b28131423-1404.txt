See page 1265. Tartaric Acid—Acidum Taetaeicum. Boil acid tartrate of potash, 45 oz., with distilled water,2 gall., adding, gradually,chalk, 12| oz., continually stirring; when the effer- vescence has ceased, add chloride of calcium, 13^ oz., dissolved in distilled water, 2 pints; after subsidence, pour off the liquid and wash the tartrate of lime with distilled water till it is rendered tasteless; now pour on sulphuric acid, 13 fl. oz., previously diluted with distilled water, 3 pints; boil for ^ hour, with repeated stirring; filter through calico, and gently evaporate the filtrate till it is of the sp. gr. of 1*21; when cool, separate the crystals of sul- phate of lime, and again evaporate the clear liquor till a film forms. Purify the crystals which form, if necessary, by solution and re- crystallization. Test Solutions for Quantitative Analysis. These are placed together in the Appendix (B. II).

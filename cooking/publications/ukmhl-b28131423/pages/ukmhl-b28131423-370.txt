This process is called ‘setting the sponge;’ and according to the proportion the water in it bears to the whole quantity that is to be used, it receives the name of ‘ whole’ ‘ half’ or ' quarter sponge’ Here, the sponge heaves and swells, and ulti- mately the surfece bursts and subsides, and if not checked, swells again and again in a similar manner, and would continue to do so, until the whole of the ‘ saccharine matter^ was destroyed, and the dough had become sour. The baker is careful, however, to stop it before it has communicated a sourness to the mass. After the first, or at the furthest, after the second or third ‘ dropping of the sponge,’ he adds the remaining quantity of f our, water, and salt, necessary to form the ‘batch,’ and then kneads the whole until it becomes suffi- ciently tough and elastic to bear the pressiire of the hand without adhering to it. The ‘ dough’ is now left to itself for a few hours, during which the fermentation still goes on. The inflated mass is then again kneaded, cut into pieces, weighed, and shaped into loaves. In an hour, or two, these unbaked loaves swell up to nearly double their former size, and are then placed in the oven, and baked. During this operation they continue for a time to increase in size, in consequence of the dilation of the pent-up gas by the heat. At length the fer- mentation is checked, and the dough becomes too solid to admit of Arrther alteration. Such are the principles and practice of the art of baking. The operations are precisely the same on both the small and the large scale, and therefore need not be separately described. Adult. The adulteration of both flour and bread is carried to a fearful extent, more espe- cially in London. The bakers’ fiour is very often made of the worst kinds of damaged foreign wheat; and other cereal grains, and particularly beans, are mixed with them in grinding them into flour. In this capital no fewer than six distinct kinds of wheaten flour are brought into the market—fine fiour, seconds, middlings, fine middlings, coarse middlings, and twenty-penny fiour. Among the principal substances which have been proved to have been used to adulterate wheat-flour and bread are the following:— **Alum. * Ammonia (Sesqui- carbonate). *‘*Beans. *Bone dust. *Chalk. Clay. Copper (Sulphate). Lime (Sulphate from the soda water makers). ^Magnesia (Carbon- ate). * Plaster of Paris. *Potash (Carbonate and bicarbon- ate). **Potatoes. **Rice. **Soda (Carbonate and sesquicarbon- ate). ^Starch (Potato). **Water (in excess). Zinc (Sulphate). Of these substances, those marked thus (*) are very frequently used; and those marked thus (**), almost universally so. According to Mr. Accum, the smallest quan- tity of alum that can be employed with effect to produce white, light, and porous bread, from the inferior kinds of flour commonly used by the bakers, is from 3 to 4 oz. to a sack of flour weighing 280 lb. But Dr. P. Markham states, that the ordinary bread of the London baker is made of one sack or 5 bushels of fiour ; 8 oz. of alum ; 4 lb. of salt ; ^ gal. of yeast; and about 3 gal. of water}- Our own analysis extending to many hundred samples of London bread, as well as those of other chemists, shew that even this large quantity of alum is often very much exceeded by the bakers. Alkaline substances, as the carbonates of am- monia, soda, and potash, are often employed to reahse the important consideration of pro- ducing light and porous bread from spoiled, or, as it is technically called, sour fiour. The first salt becomes temporarily converted into a gaseous state during the operation of baking, causing the dough to swell up in minute bub- bles, wbicb thus render it light and porous; tbe salt itself being at the same time, for the most part, volatilised. Alum is added, not only with a like intention, but also to enable the dough to ‘ carry ’ more water. There are several instances of convictions on record of millers and bakers having used gypsum, chalk, and pipeclay, in the manufacture of their goods. A gentleman, lately writing from the north of England, says, that he found in one sample of flour, which he recently examined, upwards of 16g of gypsum; and in another, 12g of the same earth. A few years since it was discovered that some of the bakers in France and Belgium added blue vitriol to their dough to make it take ‘ more water,’ in the same way as the English baker uses alum. 1 oz. of this sul- phate was dissolved in a quart of water, and a wine-glassful of this solution added to the water necessary to make about 50 Mb.-loaves. This enormous crime was soon detected, and deservedly caused the ruin of its heartless perpetrators. Exam. The principal adulterants above re- ferred to are fortunately easy of detection.

With GLASS ALCOHOLOMETEBS. That of Tralles, and most others of a like description, (as made in England,) give the per-centage strength, by ‘tolijme,* with tolerable accu- racy, at the standard temperature of 60° Fahr. Gay-Lussac’s alcoometee, which closely re- sembles that of Tralles, is adjusted for the temperature of 59° Fahr. (15° Cent.). All of these, to give at once accurate results, must, of course, be employed at the * normal tem- perature’ of the instrument. As, however, in practice, the experiment cannot be conve- niently performed at any ‘ fixed ’ temperature, but only at that of the atmosphere, it is obvious that certain corrections are constantly required in order to obtain results of any value. Perfect accuracy requires that Tables for every variation of the thermometer, founded on actual experiments, should accompany each instrument? as, without them, tedious and difficult calculations are necessary, which, in the ‘ hurry ’ of the cellar and laboratory, or by, persons inexpert^ at figures, are not easily performed. A series of such Tables were prepared by Gay-Lussac, and, with his instrument, are those which are almost 'exclu- sively used in France^^ For rough purposes, in the absence of Tables, or nicer calculations, it may be useful to know, that, for commercial spirits, at ordinary temperatures,, a variation of— By Volume, 5° Fahr. is equal to (about) 1*00^ of Alcohol; or (about) 1‘794-g- of Proof spirit; 1° „ „ „ 0-20^- 5° Cent. ,, „ 1*80^ 1° » „ „ 0-36^- Thus, by making the proper audition to the apparent strength per cent., -when the observed temperature is below the normal temperature of the instrument, or a corre- sponding SUBTEACTION, when it is above it, the actual strength of the sample may be de- ^ termiued (nearly). When, however, more 0-359^ 3*229^ 0-646^ 1 This valualile Table, with the exception of about 40 lines by Mr. Gutteridge, which appeared in a former edition of this v. ork, is reproduced froni Dr. Ure’s'Dic^. of Arts ~Manuf., and Mines' 4th Ed., vol. ii, p. 704-5. 2 These Tables, adapted to English use, are inserted at p. 77-87. They furnish, ‘ at a glance,’ Ml the information that can possibly be wanted in the laboratory, the spirit- cellar, or the distillery, in connection mth the detei’mina- tiou of strength and value of sphit, by volume.

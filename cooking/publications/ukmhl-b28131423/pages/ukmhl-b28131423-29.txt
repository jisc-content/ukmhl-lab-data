ACETIC ACID. 13 vessel, are perfectly pure hydeated acetic ACID. Obs. The above is an excellent process for obtaining a chemically pure acid. The excess of sulphuric acid left from the process may be recovered by distillation; or the -whole re- siduum may be employed in a second distilla- tion with fresh acetate. Although a retort is recommended by Liebig for the distillation, and is usually adopted, on the small scale, for the purpose, a : flask closed by a cork perforated by two tubes, I as exhibited in the engr., will be found more convenient and safe; as the product is thus less likely to be contaminated by the ‘ spirting ’ of the ingredients over the brim of the vessel. {C.) A Liebig’s Condenser Tube. (The other reference letters are self-explanatory.) The heat of a diffused gas-flame, may also be often advantageously substituted for a sand- bath. 5. (Ph. U.S.) Take of sulphuric acid, 6 oz.; acetate of soda (dried by a gentle heat), 12 oz.; red oxide of lead, 1 dr.; mix the acid and acetate in a glass retort, and distil in a sand- bath, until the residuum becomes dry; add to the product the oxide of lead, agitate, and re-distil with a moderate heat to dryness. The sp. gr. of product is‘‘l*063 tol‘068;” generally, about 1‘065. It then contains about 57^ of pure hydrated acetic acid. 6. (Ph. Hann. 1831.) Acetate of soda (as last), 12 oz.; strong sulphuric acid, 9 oz.; peroxide of manganese, 2 oz.; mix, and distil as before ; rectify the product with peroxide of manganese, and dried acetate of soda, of each 1 oz. Said to be superior to the last. 7. (Aciddm aceticum, Ph. L. 1836; A. a. foe'tius, Ph. L. 1824.) Frep. (Ph. L. 1836.) Take of acetate of soda, 2 lb.; sidphuric acid, ^9 oz.; distilled water, 9 fl. oz.; mix, and pro- ceed as before. Obs. The above proportions are nearly equal to one equivalent of each of the ingredients; and the product is 165‘5 parts of liquid acid of the sp. gr. 1-048, containing 30-8^ of real acetic acid, or 361 % (nearly) of glacial acid, for every equiv., or 137 parts of crystallised acetate of soda employed, being within 1^ | of the estimated product. 100 gr. of it saturate exactly 87 gr. of crystallised carbonate of soda It thus consists of very nearly 1 equiv. of real acetic ac?t?„and 13 equiv. of water. It crystallises at 28° Pahr., and even at 45° if a crystal of acid be dropped into it; melts again under 60°; crystallises beautifully under a pressure of 1100 atmospheres. (Phil. Trans. 1826.) 15 parts of this acid added to 85 parts of distilled water is equal in strength to the distilled vinegar of the London Pharmacopoeia; or (say), 1 part of acid to nearly 6 parts of water. It is not strong enough to dissoh-e resin, nor even camphor or essential oils, in any quantity. 8. (Acidum a., Acidum e ligno proepara'tum, purifica'tum, Ph. L. 1851.^) In the present Pharmacopoeia this acid is placed in the ma- teria medica; the same being ordered as in that of 1836. Unfortunately the "pure pyroligneous’ or acetic acid of commerce, has usually only the sp. gr. 1-044; and this acid is commonly substituted for one of the strength ordered by the London college. See above; also ^purityf &c. (below). 9. (Ph. Bor. 1847.) Take of crude sulphate, I “Acid prepared from wood by fire, purified.” That is, ‘pure pyroligneous acid,’ or tbe ordinary ‘ acetic acid’ of commerce.

1238 STEARIC ACID. to society.” To lessen, as much as possible, this loss, various improvements have been made, which, “ for the most part, have con- sisted in lengthening the flues, and exposing a larger surface of the boiler to the action of the heated air passing from the furnace to the chimney.” “ Remembering that air is an ex- tremely bad conductor of heat, and that water about to be converted into steam is also a bad conductor, it is evident that time must form an important element in the perfect trans- mission of heat from one of these to the other j and hence, wflth a great velocity of current existing in the flues, very little heat would pass from air, however high its temperature, to water contained in a boiler, and so circum- stanced in respect to its all but gaseous con- dition.” The results of the experiments on fuel made at the Museum of Practical' Geology by Sir H. de la Beche and Dr. Lyon Playfair, go clearly to show that, “ to open the damper of a steam-boiler furnace is pretty generally to diminish the effective power of the fuel.” “ Great waste of coal now arises from this simple circumstance; and much of the heat of the fire, which ought to go to the boiler, is lost by its (too) hasty transmission up the chimney. If, however, there be thus far room for improvement in the direction just indi- cated, still wider is'the vacant space, caused by imperfect combustion, or, in technical phrase, ‘bad stoking,^ merely because the stoker, to economize his labour, and to avoid trouble, throws on to the bars of his furnace a thick layer of fuel, by which loss is caused in two or three directions.” These are, prin- cipally, imperfect combustion, and the volatili- zation of fuel, as smoke, &c., from an insuffi- cient supply of air, and from a mass of mere red-hot coke or cinder, two or three inches thick, lying between the boiler and the hot- test part of the furnace; which last, accord- ing to Dr. Kennedy, is about one inch above the fire-bars. Besides which, “ in passing over this red-hot coke, the carbonic acid would be converted into carbonic oxide, and thus not only remove a quantity of carbon equal to its own, without yielding any additional heat, but actually with the production of cold, of, in other words, the absorption of heat.” (‘ Diet. Arts, Manuf., and Mines/) This points to the evident policy of using a smoke-consuming furnace, as noticed elsewhere. Another matter worthy of remark, is the constant waste of heat, and, consequently, of fuel, in laboratories and manufactories in which steam is employed, owing to the exposed con- dition of the pipes, boilers, and pans. All of these should be well ‘ clothed’ or covered by some non-conducting medium, to prevent loss of heat by radiation, and by contact with the atmosphere. Not only does economy dictate such a course, but the health and comfort of the workpeople demand that the atmosphere in which they labour should be as little heated and poisoned as possible.

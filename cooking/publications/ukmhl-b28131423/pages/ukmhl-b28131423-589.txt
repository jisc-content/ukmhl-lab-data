According to Prof. Mosander, the substance usually called yttria is a mixture of the oxides of three metals—yttrium, erbium, and terbium, which difter in the character of their salts, and in some other important par- ticulars. The first is a powerful base; the others, very weak ones. The latter are sepa- rated with extreme difficulty, and possess no practical importance. | EREMACAU'SIS. Slow burning; decay. This expression was applied by Liebig to the peculiar decomposition which moist or- ganic matter undergoes, when freely exposed to the air, by the oxygen of which it is gradually burned or destroyed, without any sensible elevation of temperature.

E. & !>.), L. “The seed of Secale cereale (Linn.), or common rye, diseased by a parasitic fungus.^’—Ph. L. Ergot of rye deteriorates greatly by age, being subject to the attacks of a description of acarus resembling the cheese mite, but' much smaller, which destroys the whole of. the internal portion of the grain, leaving nothing but the shell, and a considerable quantity of excrementitious matter. To pre- vent this, the ergot should be well dried, and then placed in bottles or tin canisters, and closely preserved from the air. The addition of a few cloves, or drops of the oil of cloves, or strong acetic acid, or a little camphor, or camphorated spirit of wine, will preserve this substance for years in close vessels. M. Martin proposes to steep the dry ergot in strong mu- cilage, and then to dry it on a sheet of white iron. This operation he repeats once or oftener, and finally preserves the prepared and thoroughly dried ergot in a well-corked glass flask. (‘ Jour, de Chimie Med.’) The wholesale druggists generally keep it in well- covered tin canisters or tin boxes. Ergot of rye is much used to restrain uterine «. 11G-, Mulder. h.

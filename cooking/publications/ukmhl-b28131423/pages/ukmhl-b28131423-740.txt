Fresh-slaked lime, 5 dr.; water, 1^ oz.; mix, strain through gauze, and pour the milk into a four-ounce bottle. Next dissolve sugar of lead, 5 dr., in water, 3 fl. oz.; add to this solution, dry slaked lime, 1 dr., stir well together, wash the precipitate with a little soft water, drain off the water, then add it to the milk of lime in the bottle, and shake the whole well together, and again before use. Applied as No. 1; but it acts much more quickly. 7. (Delcroix.) From acetate of lead, 2 oz.; prepared chalk, 3 oz.; quicklime, 4 oz.; each in an impalpable powder. Used as No. 1. 8. (Eau d’Aerique—Hopekirk.)—a. Ni- trate of silver (cryst.), 1^ dr.; distilled water, 2 fl. oz.; dissolve, and pour the solution into the bottles labelled ‘ No. 1.’—b. Liquor of ])otassa, ^ diY.', hydrosulphuret of ammonia, 7 dr.; water, 1 fl. oz.; mix, and pour the liquid into the bottles labelled ‘Solution No. 2.’ For use, the hair is moistened by means of a small-toothed comb or a tooth-brush, with the solution No. 1, either alone or diluted with a little water; care being taken to avoid touch- ing the skin, if possible. After the lapse of 8 or 10 minutes the solution No. 2, diluted with at least 5 times its measure of water, is applied in the same manner, and any spots on the skin removed by rubbing them with the corner of a napkin wetted with the liquid. The skin is then sponged clean with a little Avarm water, and wiped dry, and the hair is arranged with the comb as usual. It is better to avoid rubbing it or washing it for a few hours. Sometimes the process is reversed, and the liquid No. 2 applied first. In this Avay the stains on the skin are more readily removed, but the dye is less permanent than when the other plan is adopted. 9. (Eau d’Egypte.) Resembles No. 4 {above). 10. (Essence of Tyre.)

It is found that j ater, or any other volatile liquid, thrown on I metallic plate heated to dull redness, is not j?solved into vapour, but, assuming a some- , hat globular form, remains intact, until the jjmperature becomes sufficiently lowered to jllow of contact between the liquid and the [eated surface. It is then immediately volati- ized. M. Boutigny, who fully investigated lis subject, has also shown that the same jaing happens when a solid body containing rater is substituted for the liquid in the jbove and similar experiments. Thus, the \nger or hand, under certain restrictions, may e thrust, with perfect impunity, into a stream f molten metal, and ice may be produced by hrowing water into a red-hot crucible. This list experiment, as performed by MM. Bou- gny and Prevostaye, is essentially as follows : -A thick platinum crucible, of the capacity ■ 1 fl. oz., is heated to redness over a powerful nrit lamp, and some liquid anhydrous sul- hwous acid (a very volatile substance) poured ito it by means of a pipette ; the acid assumes spheroidal form, and does not evaporate; few drops of water are now introduced into lie sulphurous acid in the same way; the di- ;ted and slightly cooled acid instantly flashes F in vapour, and, robbing the water of its liloric, leaves the latter in a frozen state; !id, if the operator seizes the right moment, solid lump of ice may be thrown out of the d-hot crucible. i SPICE-, A general name for vegetable sub- ances possessing aromatic and pungent pro- jrties, and employed for seasoning or flavour- g food.

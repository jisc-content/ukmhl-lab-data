The pure plastic principle of clay, in which it exists as a hydrated sili- cate. Under the form o^felspar and its asso- ciated minerals, and in the various modifications of clay thence derived, it is one of the most abundant productions of nature. In its cruder forms it supplies us with the materials for manufacturing bricks, tile, pipes, earthenware, and porcelain; whilst in its pure and crystal- lised state it constitutes the ruby and the sapphire, two of the hardest and most valuable of the gems. Emery, used for polishing glass and metals, is a coarser variety of the same class of minerals. Prep. Alumina is precipitated as an ‘hy- drate’ from solutions of its salts on the addition of an alkali or alkaline carbonate; and this precipitate, after being thoroughly washed and dried, on ignition loses its water and becomes ‘ anhydrous.’ The following are the best formulae for the purpose:— 1. Alum is dissolved in about 20 times its weight of distilled water, and the solution is dropped slowly into pure liquor of ammonia, •until the latter is nearly but not entirely saturated, when the whole is set aside for M1I2 O3, 3S0g -f ICO, SO3 -P 24 Aq. some time. The clear supernatant liquid is then decanted, and the precipitate (gelat'i- Nous alumina) is carefully and thoroughly washed three or four times with tepid distilled water; after which it is collected on a filter, again well-washed with water, and, lastly, pressed and dried between bibulous paper, either * without heat, or at a temperature not higher than 120'^ Fahr. The product is pure alumina combined with water (hy'deate of alumina; alu'miNxE hy'deas, L.), from which it can , only be freed by exposure to a white heat in ! a covered crucible. The residuum, after ig- i nition, is pure anhy'deous alumina, or ses- ‘ quiox'ide of alumin'iuji. 2. (Berzelius.) Dissolve alum in 6 times its weight of boiling water, add a solution of car- bonate of potassa, \n slight excess, agitate for ' a few minutes, and filter, wash, &c., as before. 3. (Liebig.) Precipitate a solution of alum with a solution of chloride of barium; filter, evaporate the filtrate to dryness, and ignite the residuum. 4. (Gay-Lussac.) Expose perfectly pure am- monia-alum to a white heat. 5. Add carbonate of potassa, in slight excess, to a solution of alum ; well wash the precipi- tate with distilled water, redissolve it in hydro- chloric acid, and precipitate with solution of ammonia ; the last precipitate must be washed and otherwise treated as in No. 1. 6. {Medicinal.) A. solution of alum added to a solution of carbonate of ammonia, avoiding excess; and the resulting precipitate, after being washed and pressed, is dried at a heat of from 120 to 180° Fahr. Prop., 8fc. A soft white powder; in the hydrated state, freely soluble in the acids

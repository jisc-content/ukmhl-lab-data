1334 WEIGHT. The standard in avoirdupois weight is the same as in troy weight. The old avoirdupois drachm is now never used, except in weighing silk ; whenever a drachm is mentioned in com- merce, the l-8th of the avoird. oz. is intended, which, together with other divisions, is adopted in the Ph. D. In the new British Ph. the avoird. oz. and lb., with the ordinary grain, are the only denominations of weight adopted. The stone of butcher^s meat is 8 lb., and of other com- modities 14 Zi., in London. Avoird. 1 lb. = 1*21577 lb., or 1 lb. 2 oz. 4 dr. 40 gr. Troy. 1 oz. = *9114583 oz., or 7 dr. 17*5 gr. 1 lb. distilled water (therm. 62°, barom. 30 in.) = 27*72740 cubic inches. 1 oz. „ „ =: 1*73296 1 dr. „ „ = *21662 tit Avoiedupois weight is distinguished in this work by the abbreviations referring to it being printed in italics. 2.

The carat used in weighing diamonds is 3| grains (nearly). Troy weight is employed in weighing gold, jewelry, &c., and, under a somewhat modified form, in prescribing and dis- pensing medicines.

L., E., and U. S. But in the last Ph. D. and the new Brit. Ph. it has been superseded by avoirdupois weight, as noticed above. tit The same abbreviations being commonly used to rej)resent both the avoirdupois and the troy or apothecaries’ pound, it is necessary to observe, that the former is indicated when this sign is preceded by Arabic figures ; and the latter, when it is followed by Roman numerals. It was also formerly used along with Roman numerals, to represent the wine pint. In this work the abbreviations representing teot weight are printed in Roman chaeactees. Troy.

ACETIMETRY. 24 in one of the following Tables, when the cor- responding per-centage content of acetic acid is at once seen. This method famishes reliable results only with pure, or nearly pure solutions which do not contain much above 50^ of glacial acid, or which have a sp. gr. not higher than 1‘062. It is also more to be depended on for weak solutions than strong ones. By carefully di- luting a strong acid with an equal weight, or twice or thrice its weight of water, and allow- ing the mixture to again acquire its normal temperature, the sp. gr. may be taken as a guide in all cases in which great accuracy is not required. When such dilution is made it only becomes necessary to multiply the indi- cation furnished in the Tables by 2, 3, or 4, as the case may be. As, however, authorities are not agreed as to the precise sp. gr. of the monohydrate or glacial acid, and of its solu- tions, extreme accuracy must not be expected by this method.

Before applying the above processes, account should be taken of any mineral acid which may be present in the sample, such being not unfrequently added to vinegar to impart artificial strength ; and in those depending on the sp. gr., gum, gluten, &c., must also be allowed for. The methods depending on the saturating power of the acid will be found appropriate to acetic acid of all strengths, when unadulterated with the mine- ral acids. The revenue system is well adapted to commercial vinegars and all crude samples of acetic acid, within the limit of its scale (40^ of dry acid), whether they be adulterated with oil of vitriol or not; as if the latter be present, it will be precipitated, as sulphate of lime, by the hydrate of lime employed in the process. The method based on the sp. gr. is also very convenient, and is sufficiently accu- rate for distilled vinegars and for pure acids of moderate strength. It is found that the decimal fraction of the sp. gr. of pure or nearly pure vinegar, is doubled by its conversion into acetate of lime. Thus, 1*0085 in vinegar becomes 1*0170 when converted into a solution of acetate of lime. In malt vinegar, however, 0*005 may be de- ducted from the sp. gr. for mucilage and gluten. The quantity oiforeign matter present in vinegar may therefore be approximatively ascertained, by deducting the decimal of the sp. gr. of the solution of acetate of lime from double that of the decimal part of the sp. gr.

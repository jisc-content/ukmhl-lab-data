Car- inate of soda (in crystals), 1 lb.; water, 1 I art; dissolve, and pass through the solution je chlorine evolved from a mixture of com- |>n salt, 4 oz.; binoxide of manganese, 3 oz.; \lphnric acid, 2| fl. oz. (4 oz.—Ph. L. 1836); jtuted with water, 3 fl. oz.; placed in a retort, at being applied to promote the action, and jc gas being purified by passing through jrt. oz. of water before it enters the alkaline jiution. i2. (Ph. D.) Chlorinated lime, ^ lb., and der, 3 pints, arc triturated together in a marble mortar, after which the mixture is transferred to a stoppered bottle, agitated fre- quently during three hours, and then filtered through calico; in the mean time carbonate of soda (cryst.), 7 oz., is dissolved in water, 1 pint; the two solutions are next mixed, and, after agitation for about 10 minutes, the whole is filtered as before. The filtrate is to be pre- served in a well-stopped bottle. Obs. This solution is used as an antiseptic, disinfectant, and bleaching liquid. Dose. 20 to 30 drops, in any bland fluid, in scarlet fever, sore throat, &c.; it is also made into a lotion, gargle, injection, and eye-water. Meat in a nearly putrid state, unfit for food, is im- mediately restored by washing or immersion in this liquid. Solution of Chlo"rine. Syn. Chlorine WATER; SOLUTIO CHLORINII, LiQUOR CHLO- RiNii (Ph.

On binoxide of man- ganese (in powder), 2 dr., placed in a retort, pour hydrochloric acid, 1 fl. oz., and pass the chlorine into distilled water, ^ pint, until it ceases to be evolved. 2. (Ph. E.) Muriate of soda (common salt), 60 gr.; red oxide of lead, 350 gr.; triturate them together, and put them into 8 fl. oz. of distilled water, contained in a stoppered bottle; then add of sulphuric acid, 2 fl. dr.; and having replaced the stopper, agitate the whole, occasionally, until the oxide of lead turns white; lastly, after subsidence, pour off the clear liquid into another stoppered bottle. 3. (Ph. D.) Introduce into a gas bottle peroxide of manganese (in fine powder), ^ oz. ; add of hydrochloric acid. 3 fl. oz., (diluted with) water, 2 fl. oz.; apply a gentle heat, and cause the evolved gas to pass through water, 2 fl. oz., and then into a 3-pint bottle containing dis- tilled water, 20 fl. oz., and whose mouth is loosely plugged with tow; when the air has been entirely displaced by the chlorine, cork the bottle loosely, and shake it until the chlorine is absorbed; it should now be trans- ferred to a pint stoppered bottle, and preserved in a dark and cool place. Prop., ^c. Irritant and acrid, but, when largely diluted, stimulant and antiseptic. Dose, f to 2 fl. dr., in ^ pint of water, sw'eet- ened with a little sugar, in divided doses, during the day; in scarlatina, malignant sore throat, &c. On the large scale, liquid chlo- rine may be procured by passing the gas ob- tained by any of the methods named under Chlorine, into water, until it will absorb no more.

Repeating the last example this will be— 33 : 69 : : 35 : 73-18g or nearly 73^ per cent. The same applies to all the alkaline bases and their carbonates. Test-acid for potassa, soda, and am- monia :— This is dilute sulphuric acid having a sp. gr. of about 1-071; 100 alkalimeter-divisions (1000 water-grains measure) exactly saturate 100 gr. of pure potassa, or 113 gr. of anhydrous car- bonate of soda. The number of measures con- sumed, read off by mere inspection from the scale of the alkalimeter, gives the exact per centage of alkali in the sample examined, for POTASH; and by taking §rds of the number, or more correctly, by multiplying it by -66, that for SODA also. By employing *362 as the multiplier, it gives the like result for ammonia. By making up this acid to about the sp. gr. 1-074, or so as to weigh instead of measure 1000 grains, every 10 grains consumed repre- sent 1 gr., or Ig, of PURE POTASSA, and, with ordinary care, gives results perfectly accurate, to less than the ^gth of a gr. per cent., when 50 or 100 gr. are tested.

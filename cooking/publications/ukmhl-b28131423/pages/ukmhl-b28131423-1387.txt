1371 APPENDIX, ^ Hemlock Fruit—Conii FRtrcTTTS. The ripe fruit, dried/’ A new officinal drug. Hips—Rosa Canina. “The ripe fruit of indigenous plants, deprived of the hairy seeds (achenes).” (See page 729.) Honey — Mel. British and imported. “ Boiled with water for 5 minutes, and allowed to cool, it does not become blue with the solu- tion of iodine.” (See pa^e 730.) Borax Hoxey (Mel Boracis). Finely powdered lor ax, 6t gr.; clarified honey, 1 oz.; mix. (See joflye 731.) Clarified Honey (Mel depuratfm). As in the Ph. D. {Seepage 731.) Hog’s Fat. Named in Appendix as an article employed in pharmacj". Hop—Lupulus. See page 732. Horseradish Root—Armoracia. See page 733. Hydrochloric Acid. 1. (Aciditm Hydro- chloricum:; A. Muriaticlm perdm, Ph. E. & D.) From chloride of sodium, dried, 3 lb.; sulphuric acid, 44 fl. oz.; water, 36 fl. oz., dis- tilled, by the aid of heat, in a flask holding at least one gallon. The gas is passed into dis- tilled water, 50 fl. oz., kept cool, and the pro- cess continued until the product measures 68 fl. oz. Sp. gr. 1T7, same as the pure acid of Ph. D. (See page 736.) 2. (Dilute; Acidum Hydrochloricum di- lutum). From hydrochloric acid (1), 3 fl. oz., and distilled water, 8 fl. oz. Sp. gr. 1*05. 3. (Commercial.) Named in Appendix as an article employed in the preparation of medicines. Hydrocyanic Acid (Dilute)—Acidem Hy- DROCYANicuM DILIJTI7M. Described in Mat. Med. as “ Hydrocyanic Acid, HCoN, dissolved in water, and constituting 2 per cent, of the solution.” The process given for preparing it is essentially the same as that of the Ph. L. (see 2, a, page 739); but, to prevent mistakes, Ave give it in detail:—Dissolve ferrocyanide of potassium, oz., in distilled water, 10 fl. oz., then add sulphuric acid, 7 fl. dr., previously diluted with distilled water, 4 fl. oz., and cooled. Put them into a retort, and adapt this to a receiver containing distilled water, 8 fl. oz., wdiich must be oarefully kept cold. Distil Avith a gentle heat, by the aid of a sand bath, until the fluid in the receiver measures 17 fl. oz. Add to this, distilled water, 3 fl. oz., or as much as may be sufficient to bring the acid to the required strength of 2g. The test of strength is as folloAvs:—“ Half a fluid ounce of the acid, Avhen treated Avith an ex- cess of solution of soda, requires the addition of 80*66 measures of the ‘ volumetric solution of nitrate of silver’ before a permanent pre- cipitate begins to form, Avhich corresponds to 2 per cent, of anhydrous acid.” [In the Ph. D. formula (2, c,page 738), the quantity of ferrocyanide of potassium is incor- rectly given as 1 oz. instead of 2 oz.'] Hyoscyamus—Hyoscyamus. “The leaAms and branches of the indigenous biennial plant, dried; collected Avhen about tAvo thirds of the flowers are expanded.” See Henbane {page 728). Iceland Moss—Cetraria. “The entire lichen—Cetraria islandica. {^ee page 751.) Indian Hemp—Cannabis Indica. . “ The flowering tops of the fern ...e plant from Avhich the resin has not been removed, dried; cul- tivated in India.” (See joaye 728.) Indigo. Named in Appendix as an article employed in analysis. (See page 755.) Infusions. These are ordered to be made in a covered vessel, in most cases with boiling dis- tilled AA^ater (infusions of chiretta and cus- paria, with hot distilled water—120° Fahr. ; and those of calumbo, gentian, and quassia, with cold). The quantity of water generally ordered is 10 fl. oz. (in the case of gentian it is 8 fl. oz., and in that of kousso 4 fl. oz.). With tAvo exceptions, all the infusions are ordered to be strained (that of kousso is ordered to be made without straining, and that of yelloAV cinchona to be filtered through paper). The time required for infusion or maceration varies AAuth the nature of the drug. (See below— and compare with formulae on pages 759-773.) Infusion of Bearberry (Infusum TJvaj Ursi).

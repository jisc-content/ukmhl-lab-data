77 ALCOHOLOMETRY, volumes, and values of spirituous liquors j and to prevent the errors and irregularities which so frequently occur when these calculations, or corrections, are neglected. It shews at once, I by ‘ mere inspection, ’ the peb-centage volume j of absolute alcohol in any liquid, at 59° Fahr., I from the observed per-centage of the alcoholo- i meter at any of the temperatures given oppo- site it, in the left hand vertical column. The I number (in smaller type) set immediately below I this per-centage, and forming the second num- I her of each triplet, denotes the volume which I 1000 measures of such a liquor at the observed temperature, would have when measured at the NOBMAL TEMPEBATUBE of 59° Fahr.; Or, vice versa. By multiplying this number by the real strength under which it stands, the true BiCHNESS of the sample in alcohol at the I observed temperature at which the trial was made, is at once found. Even this short and easy calculation is here rendered unnecessary, for the results obtained by it form the third nuin- her of each triplet, which, for sake of distinc- tion, are not merely printed in small type, hut are also enclosed in parentheses. Thus, the observed or apparent strength being 54g at 68° Fahr., the beal steength at 59° Fahr., would be 52‘2g:—1000 measures of such a liquor, re-measured at 59° would only occupy 996 meas.: and — at 68°, the observed tempera- ture, its BEAL STEENGTH is, therefore, only 52g. This Table, though specially intended for the ALCOoMETBE of M. Gay-Lussac, is appli- cable to per-centage results, by volume, obtained by any other instrument, or in any other manner; and hence, may be applied even to sweetened spirits, tinctures, 2n\di fermented liquors,— Table IX.—Exhibiting the ‘ beal steengths’ and * equivalent volumes’ of Spirits, at 15° Cent.

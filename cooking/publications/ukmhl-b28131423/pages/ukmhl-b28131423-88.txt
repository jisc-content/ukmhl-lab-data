72 ALCOHOLOMETRY. generally, for an entire business day, without further adjustment. The liitle boiler is next Idled with the liquor to he examined, and the lamp again lighted. The temperature as shewn by the scale of the instrument at the com- mencement of full ebullition being ascertained, may be sought in one of the following Tables, against which the alcoholic content of the liquor will be found (nearly).— Table VII.—Exhibiting the boiling points of Mixtures of Alcohol and, Water of the given strengths.

This method does not answer well with spirituous solutions or mixtures of a strength above ‘ proof/ owing to the variations of their boiling point being so slight as not to be easily observed with accuracy; but with liquors under ‘ proof,^ and particularly with wines, beer, and other fermented liquors, due care being observed, it gives results closely approximating to those obtained by ‘ distillation/ and suffi- ciently accurate for all ordinary purposes. In testing strong alcoholic solutions it is, there- fore, proper to dilute them with twice their bulk of water; and commercial spirits, with an equal bulk of water; the results obtained being doubled or tripled, as the case may be. J It may be remarked, that the numbers given in this column do not exactly correspond with those given by Dr. Ure, in Table I, p. 65. For a full development of this system of alcoholometry, see Ebellioscope, in which the most improved instrument yet made for its application, is ‘ figured^ and explained. The first three methods, next following, have been proposed as not liable to some of the objec- tions which have been raised against that just explained:— d. From the EXPANSION of the liquid when heated:—Silbermann’s dilatatometer. —The expansion of alcohol between 0° and 212° Fahr. is triple that of water; and between 77° and 122° Fahr., it is much greater. Between —14° and-4-98° Fahr., the rate of expansion is about the •00047th part in volume for every degree of Fahrenheit’s scale. The measurement of this expansion has been proposed as a new and ready method of alco- holometry, adapted to nearly all spirituous and fermented liquors. Silbermann’s in- strument, which is based on it, (see engr.,) simply consists of a flat brass or ivory plate I {A), on which are fixed a ‘mercurial ther- mometer’ (D) graduated from 22° to 50° Cent. (=77° to 122° Fahr.); and the dilatatometer (B), which is a glass pipette open at both ends. A ‘ valve’ of cork, or vulcanised Indian rubber, closes the tapering end (c); this valve is attached to a ‘movable rod’ [c) which is fastened to the supporting-plate, and connected with a ‘spring’ (/) and a ‘handle’ {g) bearing a four-threaded screw, by which the lower orifice of the pipette can be opened or closed at will. In use, the pipette is filled with

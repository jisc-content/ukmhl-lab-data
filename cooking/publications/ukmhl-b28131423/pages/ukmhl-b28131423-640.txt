Dose. \ gr. to 1 gr., gradually in- creased j in chronic rheumatism, obstinate skin diseases, &c. Extract of Pomegran'ate. Syn. Exteactum GEAXATi, L. Prep. 1. (Soubeiran, & P. Cod.) From the root-bark of pomegranate, as extract OF BOX. In tape-worm. Dose. 10 to 20 gr.; followed by a purgative. I 2. (E. G. coETicis FEUCTus, L.) From the i decoction of the fruit-rind. As the last. j Extract of Pop'pies. Syn. Exteactum pa- j PAVEEIS (Ph. L. & E.), E. p. ALBI, L. Prep. 1. (Ph. L.) Bruised poppy-heads (without the ’ seeds, 15 oz.; boiling distilled water, 1 gall.; j macerate 24 hours, boil to one half, strain, and complete the evaporation. 2. (Ph. E.) As the last, with “ capsules not quite ripe.” Obs. The medical action of extract of pop- pies, for the most part, resembles that of j opium; hut it is considerably weaker, and is i generally regarded as less prone to produce ! headache and delirium. Dose. 2 to 12 gr. It is usually prepared by the large manufacturers, by exhausting the capsules, by coction with water; hence the inferior quality of the ex- tract of the shops, which contains a consider- able quantity of inert matter. The principal consumption of this extract is among the brewers, brewers’ druggists, and wine-merchants. For this purpose it is evapo- rated until it becomes hard on cooling, when it is formed into half-pound rolls, and covered with paper, like lead-plaster. One of these rolls added to a hogshead of ale, stout, or sherry, materially increases the ‘ headiness ’ or apparent strength of these beverages. Extract of Pota'to. Syn. Exteactum So- XAXI tubeeosi, L. Prep. (Dr. J. Latham.) From the stem and leaves of the potato plant, as EXTRACT OF ACONITE—Ph. L. Narcotic. Dose. 2 to 10 gr. Extract of Pur'ging Flax. Syn.

Bitter and sto- machic. Dose. 5 to 10 gr., or more. Obs. This extract is almost universally pre- pared by coction, and is principally consumed by the brewers, who employ it as a substitute for hops, in large quantities. The bark is fre- quently substituted for the wood, but is con- siderably less bitter. The Ph. Baden has an extract prepared with spirit of *944. Extract of Quince Seeds. Syn. Exteactum CTDONiiE, E. c. SEMINUM. Prep. From the decoction. Sucked as a lozenge, in hoarseness, &c. . ' Extract of Rhat'any. Syn. Exteactum EHATANI^ ; E. KEAMEELE (Ph. E.), L. Prep. 1. (Ph. E. Baden and U. S.) From dried rhatany root {Krameria triandria), as extract OF bistort—P. Cod. 2. (Ph. Bor.) By two successive macerations in boiling water of 24 hours each, and evapo- rating at a temperature not exceeding 165° Fahr. Obs. Extract of rhatany is astringent and tonic. Dose. 10 to 20 gr. A large quantity of this extract, of very inferior quality, is im- ported from Brazil, and other parts of South America. It is kept in two states, hard and soft; the former resembles kino, and is often sold for it; the latter is chiefly consumed by the manufacturers and ‘improvers' of port wine. Extract of Rhu'barb. Syn. Exteactum EHEi (Ph. L. E. & D.), L. Prep. 1. (Ph. L.) Rhubarb (in powder), 15 oz.; proof spirit, 1 pint; distilled water, 7 pints; macerate 4 days, strain, and set it aside, that the faeces may sub- side; next decant the clear portion, strain, and evaporate to a proper consistence. 2. (Ph. L.) As extract of cinchona—Ph. L. (nearly). “ The extract is obtained of finer quality by evaporation in a vacuum with a gentle heat.” The Baden formula is similar. Obs. This extract is usually prepared by decoction from inferior and damaged rhubarb, picked out from the chests on purpose; hence the inferior quality of the extract of the shops. When made of good Turkey, or even East India rhubarb, it is a very valuable prepara- tion. Dose. As a stomachic, 5 to 10 gr.; as a purgative, 10 gr. to ^ dr. It is seldom exhi- bited alone. Product. 50§. 3. (Fluid; Liquor of rhubarb. Essence OF E.; Liquor ehei, Exteactum ehei FLUIDUM, L.)—fl. (W. Procter.)

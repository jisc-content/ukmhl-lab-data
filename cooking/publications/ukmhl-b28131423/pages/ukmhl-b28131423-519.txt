The plan recommended by the Edinburgh College, of filtering the decoction when cold, is absurd. According to Soubeiran, 140 gr. of the deposit thus removed contained 86 gr. soluble in alcohol, and rich in the cin- chona alkaloids. This liquid should, therefore, be well shaken before pouring it out for use, instead of being filtered. The addition of a few drops of either sulphuric or hydrochloric acid to the water greatly increases its solvent power, and also, consequently, the medicinal value of this preparation. (See below.)

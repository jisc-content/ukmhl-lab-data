CHLOROMETRY. 436 contained 10 gr. of chlorine—the constant quantity of that substance required to per- oxide the test-solution of sulphate of iron. Thus:—If 80 measures of the liquor in the chlo- roraeter have been consumed, this quantity will represent 40 gr. of chloride of lime, and 10 gr. of chlorine. By dividing 1000 by this number, the per-centage of chlorine will be obtained. In the present instance this would be— 1000 = 25g. 40 Obs. The above method admits of much greater accuracy, if the chloride of lime, dis- solved in tepid water, is placed in a ‘ Schuster’s alkalimeter,’^ previously weighed, and the so- lution made up to exactly 1000 gr. when cold. The quantity consumed may here be ascertained with great exactness. Every grain of the solution will now be only equal to 5’g of a grain of the chloride examined. The quan- tity of the solution consumed is determined by very accurately weighing the alkalimeter both before and after the operation. The loss represents the quantity that has been used. A modification of this plan has been sug- gested by Mr. Crum. He proposes to make the solution of the sulphate of iron in a stop- pered bottle, and to add the chloride in the state of powder from a weighed parcel. 2. (Crum’s Process.) Equal weights of water and hydrochloric acid are mixed together, and cast-iron borings digested in the diluted acid until saturation is complete; a large excess of iron being purposely employed, and the liquid kept at the heat of boiling water for some time. One measure of the solution, marking 40° on Twaddell’s scale (sp. gr. 1’200), is then mixed with an equal quantity of acetic acid (sp. gr. 1-048). This forms the test- liquid. When mixed with 6 or 8 parts of water, it is quite colourless, but chloride of lime occasions the production of peracetate of iron, which gives it a red colour. The above proof-solution is next poured into 12 two-oz. vials, of exactly equal diameters, to the amount of ^th of their capacity; these are filled up with bleaching liquid of various strengths; the first at of a degree of Twaddell, the second y^gths, and so on up to ||ths of 1°. They are then well corked up, and, after agitation, arranged side by side on a tray, furnished with holes to receive them. (See engr.) To ascertain the strength of an unknown sample of bleaching liquor, the proof-solution of iron is put into a phial, exactly similar to the 12 previously used, and in precisely the same proportion (gth). The phial is then filled up with the bleaching liquor, well shaken, and placed beside that one of the 12 already prepared which it most resembles in colour. The number on 1 See engraving, page 23. that phial expresses the strength of the sample under examination, in twelfths of a degree of Twaddell’s hydrometer.^ i it 1 1 IJ 1 1 11 II 1A 3:^ ■J; Table exhibiting the quantity of Bleaching Liquid,atQ° onTwaddell’sscale (sp.gr. 1-030), required to be added to a weaker liquor, to raise it to the given strengths.

The preceding method is admirably suited for weak solutions, such as are employed for bleaching textile fabrics, and is well adapted (from its simplicity) to the purposes of prac- tical men. Indeed, it is quite astonishing to see with what ease and accuracy it is applied by unlettered operatives. This gives it great practical value. It has been for some time in extensive use in the bleaching houses of Scot- land. According to Mr. Crum, the range of strength within which cotton is “ safe,” is very limited. A solution at 1° of Twaddell’s scale (sp. gr. 4-005), is not “ more than safe,” while one at ^° is scarcely sufficiently strong for the first * This instrument is so graduated that the real sp. gr. can be deduced from the degree of the hydrometer bjr mul- tiplying the latter by 5 and adding 1000; the sum is the sp. gr., water being 1000. Thus 10° Twaddell indicates a | sp. gr. of 1050, or 105.

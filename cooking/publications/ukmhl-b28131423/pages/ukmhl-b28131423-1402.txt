Stramonium Seeds — Steamonii Semina. “ The ripe seeds.” Strychnia — Steychnia. The following process is ordered for the preparation of this alkaloid:—Soften and grind nux vomica, 1 lb., as ordered in Ph. E. (see page 1243) ; digest with rectified spirit, 2 pints, and distilled water, 1 pint, at a gentle heat, for 12 hours; strain through linen, expressing strongly; repeat the process twice. Distil off the spirit from the mixed fluid, evaporate the watery residue to 16 fl. oz., and, when cold, filter. Precipitate with acetate of lead, 180 gr. (or q. s.), dissolved in distilled water ; filter; wash the precipitate with cold distilled water, 10 fl. oz., adding the washings to the filtrate; eva- porate the clear fluid to 8 fl. oz., and, when cold, add, with stirring, solution of ammonia in slight excess. After 12 hours’ repose, at the ordinary temperature, collect the precipitate on ft filter; wash it at once with a little cbld distilled water, dry it on a vapour bath, and boil it with successive portions of rectified spirit, till the fluid is scarcely bitter. Distil off most of the spirit, evaporate the residue to I fl. oz., and set it aside to cool. Cautiously pour off the yellowish mother-liquor (which contains brucia) from the white crust of strychnia, and wash this on a paper filter with rectified spirit diluted with | its bulk of distilled water, until the washings cease to strike a red colour with nitric acid; finally, dissolve it by boiling in rectified spirit, 1 fl. oz., and set it aside to crystallize. More crystals may be got by evaporating the mother-liquor. Suet (Prepared) — Sevum pe^paeatum. From the sheep. {Seepage 1245.) Sugar of Milk—Sacchaeum Lactis. In Mat. Med. No process. (See 1247.)

Sub- limed sulphur, 5 oz.; slaked lime, 3 oz. ; mix, then heat in distilled water, 1 pint, stirring diligently with a wooden spatula, boil for 15 minutes, and filter. Boil the residue again in ^ pint, and filter. Dilute the united fil- trates with distilled water, 2 pints, and add, in successive portions (until effervescence ceases, and the mixture becomes acid), hydrochloric acid, 8 fl. oz. (or q. s.), previously mixed with distilled water, 1 pint. After repose, decant off the supernatant liquid, and purify the pre- cipitate by affusion with cold distilled water and subsidence, until the water ceases to have an acid reaction and to precipitate with oxa- late of ammonia. Collect on a calico filter, wash at once with distilled water, and dry at a temperature under 120°. Sulphuretted Hydrogen. The ordinary pro- cess for generating this gas, by the reaction between dilute027 of vitriol'Au^sulphuretof iron, is described in the Appendix. (See page 745.) Sulphuric Acid. 1. (Acidum Sulphuei- CUM.) This is prepared from the sulphuric acid of commerce (described in Appendix— sp. gr. 1*84 to 1-85) by the following process :— To sulphuric acid of commerce, 12 fl. oz., add sulphate of ammonia (in powder),oz.; put the mixture into a plain retort with a few slips of platinum-foil, cover the upper part of the body of the retort with a sheet-iron hood, and distil over yL of the acid into a flask. Remove flask, and reject its contents; and, having applied a fresh flask, continue the dis- tillation till only 1 fl. oz. remains behind in the retort. This purified product is described in Mat. Med. as “ monohydrated sulphuric acid,” and has assigned to it the sp. gr. 1*846. (See page 1252.) 2. (Dilute ; A. S. dilutum.) Mix, gradu- ally, 3 fl. oz. of the above with 35 of distilled water.

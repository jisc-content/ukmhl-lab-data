568 EQUIVALENTS. the relative weights of all the gaseous and most of the gasitiahle elements expressed by Gerbardt’s numbers yield equal volumes of gas or vapour.1 Compounds expressed by the new numbers exhibit a similar constancy of relation between equivalent and specific gravity (vapour-density). See Atouiic Theory (of Gerbardt), and tbe table below. Volumetrical Equivalents. Syn. Atomic VOLUMES, Equivalent v.. Molecular v., Specieic V. Tbe volumetrical equivalent of a body is the space occupied by a quantity of it proportional to its equivalent weight, and is, therefore, expressed by the quotient of the equivalent weight divided by tbe specific gravity. According to Gerbardt’s system, equal volumes of the ditferent elementary gases are supposed to contain, for the most part, equal numbers of atoms of their respective elements, so that the atomic weight (equivalent) of each body in the gaseous state is the weight of a volume of the gas equal to that of a quantity of hydrogen whose weight is taken as unity; in other words, the equivalent weights of the simjple gases are expressed by the same numbers as tbeir specific gravities referred to hydrogen as unity. Tills relation is sometimes expressed by saying tliat an equivalent of each elementary gas occupies one volume. According to tbe same system, tbe atoms or molecules (equiva- lents) of compound bodies, in a gaseous state, i occupy for the most part twice the volume of i an atom of hydrogen or other simple gas; in other words, the number of ‘ compound atoms’ or molecules contained in a given space is half ■ tbe number of ‘ simple atoms’ which would be ' contained in tbe same space. Tbe mode of i stating these laws must, of course, be modified j according to the system of equivalents chosen. I On that which has hitherto been most gene- rally adopted (hydrogen = 1, oxygen = 8, sulphur = 16, &c.), some of the elementai’y gases are supposed to have atomic volumes equal to that of hydrogen, while others have atomic volumes only half as great. Tbe former are generally called ‘ two-volume gases,’ and the latter ‘ one-volume gases,’ the volume of oxygen being taken as the unit. The volumetrical equivalents of liquids and solids do not exhibit the simplicity of relation which exists between tbe volumetrical equivalents of gases and vapours. Those of certain analogous bodies are, however, very nearly equal to each other. In the following Table the chemical equiva- j lents, atomic weights, or proportional numbers, \ of all the known elements are given, as well as those of the more important compounds, ac- cording to the two systems of notation now adopted by chemists. Tbe older or ‘ Dualistic System’ is that commonly employed by manu- facturers and pharmaceutists:— TABLE OF CHEMICAL EQUIVALENTS OR ATOMIC WEIGHTS, compiled from the recent works of Miller, Odling, Watts, Gerbardt, &c.

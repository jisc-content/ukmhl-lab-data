75 ALCOHOLOMETRY. I 11 u. p.) or under-proof, it means that 100 gal. <j of such spirit contains 11 gal. of water, and I 89 gal. of ‘ proof spirit.^ By deducting the II per-centage under-proof from 100, we not only ! obtain the number of proof gal. contained in j 100 gal. of such spirit, but, as in the last case, ij a factor which multiplied by any number of igal., and divided by 100, gives the exact num- ber of ‘ proof gallons’ contained in any quan- tity of the given strength. Thus:—An ullage ; brandy-piece containing 45 gal. of spirit at I' 10 u. p., would have the pro<f value of— , Per cent. u. p. of sample 10, \ subtracted from 100 . . .

It therefore contains l75i § of ‘ proof spirit,* whilst proof I’ spirit (sp. gr. *920) contains 57g of ‘ absolute alcohol ;* both being by measure or volume. Thus— meas. of ale. X l75i f equiv. meas. loo L Pf' And— meas. ofpf. spt. X 57 f equiv. meas. 100 I. of abs. ale. ^ From which we derive the ‘ constant multi- pliers’ 1-7525 (or roughly If), and *57, appli- cable to any number of volumes or gallons. For— meas. of ale. x 17525 = \ meas. ^ (of pf. spt. and— meas.of„/.«^f.X-57={ To ascertain what quantity of a spirit at any ‘ given strength’ is equiv. to or contains 100 lb. of absolute alcohol, we have only to divide the ‘ constant number ’ 2207*7 by the proof-value per cent, of such spirit. ^ Thus—for a spirit 12 u. p.—this would be 100 — 12 = 88g of proof spirit; and— 1- = 25-1 gal. (nearly). 88 That is, 25^'g gal. of such spirit would contain 100 lb. of absolute alcohol. * This number is obtained thus:— inn :^^ = 12-6(neai-ly), and— 12-6 X 176-25 = 2207-7. By removing the decimal point one place to the EIGHT, we have the equiv. measure of 1000 lb. By removing it one, two, or three places to the LETT, we have it respectively for 10 lb., 1 lb., and yL lb.; from which the equiv. for all other weights may he easily obtained. By reversing the above operation, the mea^ sure of alcohol corresponding to any given weight of spirit, at any strength, may also be easily found. The WEIGHT of 1 gal. of absolute alcohol being 7*938 lb.; that of 1 gal. of proof spirit, 9*2/6.; and that of the ‘alcohol’ in 1 gal. of proof spirit, 4*53 lb.; the weight of any number of gallons or volumes of either, and their equivalents, may he easily found. Thus:— gallons of ale. x 7'9Z8~ tbs. weight of ale. „ pf. sp. X 9‘2=/6s. w. of pf. spt. and— gallons o(&lo.

Their plan is to reject the third decimal figure when ‘ less’ than 5 *, hut to carry 1 to the next figure on the left hand, when it ‘exceeds’ 5. TMs, 5*432 is set down as only 5*43; but 5*437 is written 5*44. In the deli- cate chemical processes of the laboratory, even greater accuracy is observed. Formerly, spirit was said to be 1 to 8,1 to 4, &c., over-proof; by which it was meant that 1 gal. of water added to 3 or 4 gal. of such spirit would reduce it to ‘ proof.’ On the other hand 1 in 5, or 1 in 8, under-proof, meant that the 5 or 8 gal., as the case might he, con- tained 1 gal. of water, and the eemaindee re- presented the quantity of ‘ proof spirit.’ This method of calculation has now long given way to the ‘ centigrade system, ’ which not only admits of greater accuracy, hut is quite as simple. It should he adopted by every spirit- dealer in England, from being that which isem- ployedby the Revenue officers, whose ‘surveys' it is absolutely necessary that the trader should understand, in order that his own estimation of his stock and his business calculations should correspond with theirs. The STOCKS of ‘dealees’ (those not per- mitted to sell less than 2 gal.) are always taken (estimated) at the proof-strength; but the spirits sold by eetailees are only tested on being admitted into ‘stock,’ and then after- wards taken according to their gross quantity (ullage or gauge). The officers can, however, try the strength of any sample they choose, at any time, even in the stock of a retailer ; when, if it he found to vary from the strength at which it was ‘permitted' into stock more than 3§ (unless due notice of such reduction has been given), or if it be otherwise of an

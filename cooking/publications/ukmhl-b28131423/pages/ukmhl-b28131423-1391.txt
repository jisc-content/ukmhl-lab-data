1375 APPENDIX. Logwood—HiEMATOXYLTJM. “The heart- wood, sliced.^’ (See yage 855.) Lozenges. Six kinds of lozenges are now officinal, three being newly introduced. Bismuth Lozenges (Teochisci Bismuthi). Add white bismuth, 1440 gr., carbonate of magnesia, 4 oz., precipitated carbonate of lime, 6 oz,, refined sugar, 30 oz., and gum arabic, 1 oz., to distilled water, 6 fl. oz. j boil to the proper consistence, then remove from the fire, and add oil of cinnamon, | fl. dr., mixing thoroughly. Divide into 720 square lozenges, and diy, with moderate heat. Each lozenge contains 2 gr. of white bismuth. New. Catechu Lozenges (Teochisci Catechu). To pale catechu, 2 oz.; refined sugar, 1 lb.; and gum arabic, 1 oz.; add tincture of cap- sicum, fl. oz., with sufficient distilled water to make a proper mass. Divide and dry, as above. New. Moephia Lozenges (Teochisci Moephi.®). Prepared by the Ph. E. process {page 866), slightly modifled as follows :—Dissolve hydro- chlorate of morphia, 20 gr., in boiling distilled water, ^ fl. oz.; add this solution to tincture of Tolu, ^ fl. oz., previously mixed with mu- cilage of gum arabic, 2 fl. oz. (or q. s.); then add gum arabic, 1 oz., and refined sugar, 24 oz., previously well mixed, so as to form a proper mass. Divide into 720, and dry, above. Each lozenge contains g’g gr. of the hydrochlorate. Moephia and Ipecacuan Lozenges (Teo- chisci Moephije et Ipecacuanha). As ‘ MOEPHIA LOZENGES,’ adding ipecacuanha, 60 gr., to the gum and sugar previous to mixing. Each lozenge contains Jg gr. of hydrochlorate of morphia and -/g gr. of ipecacuan. Opium Lozenges (Teochisci Opii). Add extract of opium, 72 gr., softened with a little boiling distilled water, and tincture of Tolu, ^ fl. oz., to extract of liquorice, 6 oz., heated in a water bath. When reduced to a proper con- sistence, remove the mixture to a slab, and work in a mixture of refined sugar, 16 oz., and gum arabic, 2 oz. Divide and dr^% as above. Each lozenge contains ^ gr. of extract of opium. Tannin Lozenges (Teochisci Acidi Tan- NlCl). From tannic acid, 360 gr.; tincture of Tolu, ^ fl. oz.j refined sugar, 25 oz.; gum arabic, 1 oz.; mucilage of gum arabic, 2 fl. oz.; boiling distilled water, 1 fl. oz. Dissolve the tannic acid in the water, and then proceed as for ‘ MOEPHIA LOZENGES.’ Each lozenge con- tains \ gr. of tannic acid. New. Magnesia. Two forms of this earth are in- cluded, viz.— 1. (Magnesia.) This is what has hitherto been known as ‘ heavy magnesia,’ and is pre- pared by calcining, in an earthen crucible, at a low red heat, carbonate of magnesia (heavy), until a little taken from centre of mass ceases to efiervesce with sulphuric acid. 2. (Light Magnesia; Magnesia letis.) From light carbonate of magnesia, by same process. (See page 871.) Caebonate of Magnesia.—1. (Magnesia Caebonas.) This corresponds with what has hitherto been known as the ‘ heavy carbonate ’ (Magnesia Carbonas ponderosum, Ph. D.), and is prepared by the process 5, b, given on page 872, except that 1 pint of distilled water is used to dissolve each salt, and the precipitate is or- dered to be washed “until the washings cease to give a precipitate wuth chloride of barium.” 2. (Light; Magnesia Caebonas levis.) Dissolve sulphate of magnesia, 10 oz., and car- bonate of soda, 12 oz., each in \ gall, of distilled water; mix; boil for 15 minutes in a por- celain dish; transfer precipitate to a calico filter, and w^ash as before. Sulphate of Magnesia (Magnesia Sul- phas). In Mat. Med. No process. (See page 874.) Manganese. The ‘ black oxide ’ is named in Appendix as an article employed in the pre- paration of medicines. (See page 881.) Manna—Manna. See 883. Marble. Noticed in Appendix — “ hard, white, crystalline carbonate of lime.” Mastich—Mastiche. See page 887. Maticc—Matica. The dried leaves from Peru. (See page 889.) Mercury—Htdeaegteum. The metal in a pure form is ordered. It is prepared from the MEECUET OF COMMEECE (named in Appendix), by distilling ofi* lb. from 3 lb., heated in a glass retort or iron bottle; boiling the dis- tilled metal for 5 minutes in hydrochloric acid, 3 fl. dr., diluted with distilled water, 9 fl. dr.; then washing with repeated afiusions of dis- tilled water; and drying, first by filtering paper, and finally on a water b^ath. (See page 896.) Ammoniated Meecuey (Hydeaegyeum Ammoniatum ; H. Ammonio-chloeidum, Ph. L. & D. ; H. PEACIPITATUM ALBUM, Ph. E.). From corrosive sublimate, 3 oz.; solution of ammonia, 4 fl. oz.; distilled water, 3 pints. Proceed as in the Ph. L. process {Prep. 1, page 898). Meecuey and Chalk (Hydeaegyeum CUM Ceeta). Prepared by Ph. D. formula {Prep. 2, page 908). Chloeides of Meecuey. See Calomel and CoEEOSiTE Sublimate. Iodide of Meecuey. 1. (Green; Hy- DEAEGYEI loDiDUM YiEiDE.) Hub iodine, 278 gr., and mercury, 1 oz., in a porcelain mortar, occasionally moistening wdth a few drops of rectified spirit, until the globules are no longer visible; dry in a dark room, on filter- ing paper, by simple exposure to the air, and preserve in an opaque bottle. See Subiodide {page 902). 2. (Red; Hydeaegyei Iodidum eubeum.) Dissolve corrosive sublimate, 4 oz., in boiling distilled water, 3 pints ; dissolve iodide of po- tassium, 5 oz., in boiling distilled water, 1 pint; mix; when cold, collect precipitate; w^ash it twice with cold distilled w’ater, and dry it at a temperature not exceeding 212°. See Peot- lODiDE {page 902).

In this ingenious method of alkalimetry it is absolutely necessary, that the whole of the alkali in the specimen tested should be in the state of neutral carbonate. If a sample of POTASH contains any caustic alkali{2L&i\\Q pot- ashes and pearlash of commerce generally do), ’ For i\\e equivalent weights on wliich this Table is based, see Table 1, p. 96. In commercial assays, the fractions in the last column may be disregarded, and the nearest wliole number taken, without any appreciable error in the result. In the sixth column the weights should be taken, if pos- sible, correctly to a J of a gr. ■, in i\\e fifth column, to an | gr.; and in fourth, to jtj gr. In chemical analysis requiring great accuracy, the weights in the third column should be taken true to the 5tjtU of a grain. Fresenius and Will direct \t, previously to being tested, tobe triturated with its own weigh t of pure quartzose sand, and about one-third of its weight of carbonate of ammonia; and the resulting mixture, placed in a small iron capsule, or a porce- lain crucible, to be moistened with water, and exposed to a gentle heat until it becomes quite dry, and all the ammonia is expelled. If the sample contains any bicarbonate or sesqui- carbonate, it must be heated to dull redness : before being placed in the apparatus and tested. In the case of crude soda, (particularly soffa-fls^,) the proportion of carbonate of ammo- nia should be equal to at least one half the quantity operated on.^ With both alkalies, if the sample contains sulphurets, sulphites, or 2 If the sample contains a very Inrge proportiou of caustic soda, the quantity of carhonatq jof (mnwnia should be about twodhirds the weight,

I BRICKS—BRIOCHE PASTE. 365 [ vinous, higli-fiavoured, invigorating old beers vended in our early days by the common pub- licans and tavern-keepers, of whom the larger majority were their own brewers. Under the ‘ new system' of ‘ chemical brewing,' as worked by those huge monopolists, the ‘ great brewers,' the only object appears to be to obtain the f largest quantity possible of ‘saccharine’ out * ' of the quarter of malt, and to convert this i into the largest possible quantity of beer, with little regard to flavour or quality, but an ex- f cessive one for their own profits. In due 1 course this liquor is forced on their helpless j tenants, the publicans, who, in their turn, 1 ‘reduce’ and ‘ doctor’ the liquor, until, by the : j time it reaches the consumer, its insipidity I I and low strength would have led even a brewer’s drayman of the last century to cast it ^ into the kennel. 1 j The best times for brewing are the spring ; and autumn; as at those periods of the year , the temperature of the air is such as to permit of the easy cooling of worts sufiiciently low, i without having recourse to artificial refrigera- I tion, or to the use of machinery for the pur- 1 pose. Old ale cannot be conveniently brewed , in summer. I Beers are classed by the brewers into— Small beers—made from worts not ex- ceeding the sp. gr. 1’025, or 18 lb. per barrel. Middlings—made from worts of the sp. gr. 1-025 to 1-040, and averaging about 25 lb. per barrel. Strong beers—made from worts of the sp. gr. 1040 to 1-080, extending from about 35 lb. per barrel upwards. I The densities of the worts employed for I different kinds of beer vary considerably, as Uwill be seen by the following table :— Table of the densities of Beers. Description. Pounds per Barrel.

The cleansing and pre- servation of brewing utensils, beer casks, Sfc., has frequently engaged the attention of prac- tical men and brewer’s chemists. To preserve them ‘ sweet' they should always be tho- roughly cleaned before setting them aside. Contact with soap, or any greasy material, should be carefully avoided. A scrubbing- brush and scalding-hot water are generally sufficient to clean them. Great care should be taken to remove every particle of yeast or ‘ fur ’ on the sides and bottom; and after being well-drained, they should be stowed away in some clean and cold situation, pro- perly exposed to the fresh air. Should they become tainted or mouldy, a strong lye of pearl- ash, common salt, or quicklime, may be spread over them, scalding hot, with a broom or scrubbing brush. Washing them with oil of vitriol diluted with about 7 or 8 times its bulk of water, is another excellent and very effec- tive method. Fresh-burnt charcoal has also been employed for the same purpose. In each case the vessels must be subsequently tho- roughly washed out with clean water, as be- fore. Steam, assisted by the action of a chain, has been successfully applied to clean casks in several breweries. Mr. Cobbett remarks—“I am now in a farm-house where the same brewing utensils have been used for forty years; and the owner tells me, that they may last for forty years longer.’^ See Casks, Vats, &c. BRICKS. Brick-making scarcely comes within the province of this work. In con- nection with hygiene, however, w^e may call the reader’s attention to the superior advan- tages of both hollow and waterproof bricks ; the first, for ventilation and lightness; the last, for preserving the dryness and integrity of our homes under all the vicissitudes of climate, season, and weather, either on damp soils or dry ones. Workman’s “ Patent Water- proof Bricks” received a strong commendatory notice from the Commissioners of the “ Great International Exhibition” of 1851. BRINE (for Meat). Prep. 1. A nearly saturated solution of common salt, 1 lb. ; and saltpetre, 1 oz.; in soft water. 2. To the last, add of sugar or treacle, ^ lb. Bay-salt is recommended when the meat is to be kept for a very long period. See Pick- ling, &c. Red-Cabbage Brine. Red-cabbage leaves steeped in a strong solution of common salt.

EBLANINE—EBULLITION. 538 water; Eat7 de pontaixe, eait de souece, spring water; Eae de puits, well or pump water; Ead de eiyieee, river water; Ead DISTILLEE, distilled water; Eap de eose, rose water; Ead de yie, trandy; Eau de Cologne, Cologne water; Ead d’Hongeie, Hungary water; Ead benite, holy water; Eau foete, aquafortis; Eau de sayon, soap- suds; Eau de senteue, scented water, &c. Eaux, in pei'fumery, are solutions of the fragrant essential oils in spirit, as eau de Co- logne, eau de bouquet, &c.; or they are distilled waters, largely charged with the odorous prin- ,ciples of plants, as eau de rose, eau de fleurs d'oranges, &c. Eaux, of the liqueuriste, are aromatized spirits or cordials. Eau Medicinales are either simple watery solutions (hydeoles, hydeolatuees, solu- tions PAE l’eau), or distilled water (eaux distillees) ; or they are vinous or alcoholic tinctures or solutions of essential oils, aro- matics, or more active drugs.

The yellowish-red, crystal- lizahle, solid substance, which is left behind in the retort, when wood, spirit is rectified from quicklime. It is insoluble in water, and sublimes without fusion at 273° Fahr. EB'ONY. The wood of the Diospyrus Melan- oxylon, an East Indian tree, of the natural order Ebenacece. Two other species of the same genus, namely, Diospyrus Ebenus and D. Ebenaster, yield respectively Maueitius EBONY and the bastaed ebony of Ceylon. Pale-coloured woods are stained in imitation of ebony (factitious ebony), by washing them with or steeping them in a strong de- coction of logwood or of galls, and, when dry, washing them over with a solution of sulphate or acetate of iron. They are then rinsed in clean water, and the process is repeated, if required. The wood is lastly polished or varnished. EBRI'ETY. See Intoxication. EBULLI"TION. The state of boiling, or the agitation of a liquid arising from its rapid conversion into vapour by heat. Ebullition occurs in dilferent liquids at very different temperatures, such temperatures being called their boiling-points. Under the same cir- cumstances the boiling-points are constant, and by observing them the chemist is often able to distinguish liquids which much re- semble each other. The boiling-point of the same liquid may, however, vary, considerably under different circumstances. The causes which induce variation are increased or dimin- ished atmospheric pressure, the greater or less depth of the liquid, and the character of the containing vessel. Thus, boiling water is colder by some degrees when the barometer is low, in bad weather, or at the top of a hill, than when the barometer is higher, in fine weather, or at the bottom of a valley or mine. There is a very simple and beautiful experi- ment, illustrative of the effect of diminished pressure in lowering the boiling-point of a liquid. A little water is made to boil for a few minutes in a flask or retort placed over a lamp, until the air has been expelled, and the steam issues freely from the neck. A tightly fitting cork is then inserted, and the lamp at the same moment withdrawn. When the ebullition ceases, it may be renewed at plea- sure for a considerable time by the affusion of cold water, which, by condensing the vapour within, occasions a partial vaccuum. Liquids in general boil from 60° to 140° lower than their ordinary boiling-points when heated in vacuo. The following table furnishes very exact information respecting the effect of increasing pressure upon the boiling-point of water ;— Table I.—Boiling-points of Water at different Pressures. By Mr. C. Geeyille Williams. Boiling-point ° Fahr. Barometer Inches. i Boiling-point j ° Fahr.

It is i also found that fluids boil at a lower tempe- p rature and more quietly in vessels with rough t and spicular surfaces, than in those with i smooth or polished ones. The boiling-point *1 of water, as marked on the scale of the ther- i mometer, is 212° Fahr., but in glass vessels, under common circumstances, it varies from i 212‘54° to 215-6°; whilst in perfectly pure i and smooth glass vessels water may be heated i to 221° Fahr. without boiling. That the elevation of the boiling-point in this case is due to the nature of the surface, may be at once demonstrated by throwing into water, ‘ about to boil in a glass matrass, a little iron filings or coarsely powdered glass, when ebul- lition will commence with almost explosive * violence, at the same time that the temperature of the fluid will sink about 2° Fahr. The boiling-point of water contained in ordinary vessels may be raised considerably ' above 212° Fahr., by the addition of saline

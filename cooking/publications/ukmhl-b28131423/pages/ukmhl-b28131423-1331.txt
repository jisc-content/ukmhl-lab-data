1315 VINEGAR. —7. If a small sample gently evaporated to dryness leaves more than Ig of residuum, and this has a sweet taste, it is undecomposed suGAE.—The presence of aceid substances, as capsicum, chillies, grains of paradise, mus- tard seed, pellitory of Spain, pepper, &c., may be detected by neutralizing the acidity of the vinegar with carbonate of soda, when the acrid taste of the adulterant will be readily perceived. Aromatic Vinegar. Syn. Acetum aeoma- TICUM, L. Prep. 1. Glacial acetic acid, 1 lb.,- oil of cloves, 1| dr.; oil of rosemary, 1 dr.; oils of bergamot, cinnamon, pimento, and lavender, of each, ^ dr.; neroli, 20 drops; camphor, 2^ oz. ; rectified spirit, 2 fl.oz.; mix. Very fine. 2. (Henry’s.) From glacial acetic acid, strongly scented with the oils of cloves, laven- der, rosemary, and Calamus aromaticus, to which the usual quantity of camphor is added. This is the formula adopted at Apothecaries' Hall. 3. {Extemporaneous.) From acetate of potash (dry), 1 dr.; oil of vitriol, 20 drops; oils of lemon and cloves, of each, 3 drops. Obs. Aromatic vinegar is used as a pungent and refreshing perfume, in faintness, &c. For this purpose it is generally dropped on a small piece of sponge placed in a stoppered bottle or a vinaigrette. It is highly corrosive, and should therefore be kept from contact with the skin and clothes. (See page 20.) Camp Vinegar. Prep. Take of sliced garlic, 8 oz.; Cayenne pepper, soy, and walnut ketchup, of each, 4 oz.; 36 chopped anchovies ; vinegar, 1 gall.; powdered cochineal, oz.; macerate for a month, strain, and bottle. Cam'phorated Vinegar. See page 20. Vinegar of Canthar'ides. Syn. Blisteeing VINEGAE; ACETUM CANTHAEIDIS (Ph. L. E. & D.), L. Prep. 1. (Ph. L.) Cantharides, in powder, 2 oz.; acetic acid, 1 pint; macerate, with agitation, for 8 days, then press, and strain. 2. (Ph. E.) Cantharides, 3 oz.; euphorbium, i oz.; acetic acid, 5 fl. oz.; pyroligneous acid, 15 fl. oz.; macerate a week. 3. (Ph. D.) Spanishfiies,^ oz.; strong acetic acid, 4 fl. oz.; commercial acetic acid (sp. gr. 1'044),16 fl. oz.; macerate, as before,Tor 14 days. Uses, 8fc. As a counter-irritant, and to raise blisters. For the last purpose it is applied on a piece of lint, evaporation being prevented with a piece of oiled skin or thin oheet gutta percha. The last is the best, and, indeed, the only effective form; the others being too weak. “ If the acetic acid be strong, a blister will be as rapidly raised without the cantharides as with them.” (Dr. A. T. Thomson.) Cur'rie Vinegar. Prep. From currie pow- der, ^ lb. / vinegar, 1 gall.; infuse for a week. Used as a flavouring. Other like vinegars may be made in the same way. Vinegar of CoTchicum.

It contains about 4*6g of real acetic acid. If a pewter worm is used, a portion of lead is dissolved, and the product becomes cloudy and poisonous.

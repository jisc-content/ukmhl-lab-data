In selecting a guano, the fol- lowing points (Anderson) ought to he attended to by the farmer:— “ 1st. The guano should he light coloured and dry, cohering very slightly when squeezed together, and not gritty. “ 2nd. It should not have too powerful an ammoniacal smell, and should contain lumps which, when broken, appear of a paler colour than the powder. “ 3rd. A bushel should not weigh more than f 1 from 56 to 60 pounds. ■; “ These characters are, however, imitated I with great skill, so that they cannot he im- i plicitly relied upon, and they are applicable to t Peruvian guano only.’^^ ' Pur., adult. Guano, owing to its high price, V is very commonly adulterated, or is in an ad- vanced stage of decomposition when sold. Much of what is vended under the name is altogether a factitious article. These artificial mixtures are made to look so like genuine guano, that the mere practical man, who goes only by their appearance, is very often deceived [ by them, and, owing to the failure of his crops I in consequence, is led to distrust the efiicacy I of guano as a manure. A sample of pretended I guano examined by Johnston was found to I contain, in the state in which it was sold, (more than half its weight of gypsum, the rest being peat or coal ashes, with a little common salt, crude sulphate of ammonia, and either dried urine or the refuse of the glue manufac- I ^ Tlie above particulars are from an elaborate paper by I Dr. II. M. Noau, in the “ Chemist and Druggist” vol. ii. tories, to give it a smell. “ I could not satisfy myself that it contained a particle of real guano.” ^ Vessels w'hich sail hence for the guano stations, are now very commonly bal- lasted with rough gypsum or plaster of Paris. This substance is mixed with the guano as it is loaded, and enables the importers to deliver from the vessel a “ nice-looking, light-coloured article.^' Purchasers of guano are very de- sirous of having it delivered from the vessel, as they believe they thus obtain it pure. The favourite material for the adulteration of guano, at the present moment, is a variety of umber, which is brought from Anglesea in large quantities. The rate of admixture is said to be about 15 cwt. of umber to about 5 cwtrof Peruvian guano, from which an excel- lent-looking article is manufactured, which is sold under the name of ‘ African guano* Pure guano has a pale-brown colour, a more or less ofiensive odour, and the average sp. gr. of 1*63 to 1'64. If the sp. gr. exceeds 1‘75, it is either damaged or adulterated; and if it is less than 1’62, it contains an undue quantity of moisture. The best is neutral to test-paper, and sometimes has even an acid reaction; but that of commerce has generally an alka- line reaction, owing to the presence of free ammonia, and, in consequence, turns turmeric paper brown, and gives white fumes when a glass rod dipped in hydrochloric acid is held over it. Triturated with quicklime or caustic potassa, good guano evolves a powerful odour of ammonia; digested in water, fully one half of it is dissolved; dried by the heat of boiling water, it does ' not lose more than from 7 to 9g in weight; and burned upon a red-hot shovel, it leaves a white ash, not a red or dark- coloured one.

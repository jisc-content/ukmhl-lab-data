EXTRACT. 618 grees, on its being carefully triturated with liquor of potassa.” (Ph. E.) “ The extracts of hemlock may become feeble, if not inert, in one of two ways,—either by the heat being con- tinued after the concentration has been carried to a certain extent, or by long keeping. On the one hand, I have always observed that from the point at which the extract attains the consistence of thin syrup, ammonia begins to be given off in abundance, together Avith a modified odour of conine; and, on the other hand, I have found extracts, which were un- questionably well prepared at first, entirely destitute of conine in a few years.^’ (Christison.) “The most active extract is that which is procured by moderate pressure from the leaves only.” (Brande.) “ The extract of the Ph. D., being freed from the inert albumen and chlo- rophyll, contains most of the active principle, and is nearly soluble in water.” (Royle.) On the large scale, the whole of the green portion of the plant is pressed for juice. 1 cwt. of hemlock yields from 3 to 5 lb. of extract. Dose. 2 gr., gradually increased to 5 gr., or more, until some obvious efiect is produced; as an anodyne, alterative, and resolvent in various obstinate disorders, as glandular and visceral enlargements, foul and painful ulcers, scrofula, cancer, neuralgia, rheumatism, trou- blesome coughs, &c. 4.

The plant from which this extract is prepared is called ‘ Indian hemp " in the United States of America, a practice which should be avoided, as this name is now almost exclusively appropriated to Cannabis Indica, a variety of the common hemp {Cannabis sativa, var. Indica) growing in India. See Exteact OP Indian Hemp. Extract of Hen'bane. Syn. Exteact op hyoscyamhs; Exteactum hyoscyami (Ph. L. E. & D.), Shccus spissaths hyoscyami, L. Prep. 1. (Ph. L.)

Product (by the ordinary method) :—1 lb. of the fresh leaves yielded fully 8 dr. of extract (Geiger); 1 cwt. yielded 4 to 5 lb. (Brande); 1 cwt. of the re- cent plant yielded, by an ordinary screw press, 59| lb. oi juice, and this, evaporated in a water bath, gave 5 lb. 9 oz. of extract (Squire); Ij cwt. of the green herb yielded 11 lb. of extract (Gray).

The druggists usually employ hops 2 or more years old, called by the dealers ‘yearlings* ‘olds* or ‘ old olds* because these may be purchased at § to i the price of those of the last season’s growth. The first of the above are estimated to have only f the strength of new hops; the second about i; and the last little or none, at least in a medical point of view. 3.

' Obs. The Dublin College omitted the co- chineal and raisins in their Ph. of 1826, but I have restored them in their new one. The order of the London College to stone the I raisins is seldom adopted in practice; by I which the tincture is rendered unfit to be em- ployed in dispensing prescriptions containing quinine or other alkaloids. When pharraa- I ceutists are too lazy to follow the instructions in their Pharmacopoeia, they had better use I sultana raisins, which have no stones. Dose. I to 4 fl. dr.; as a cordial and stomachic, but chiefly as an adjunct, for its colour and fla- vour. Tincture of Cascaril'la. Syn. Tinctura CASCARILL.E (Ph. L. E. & D.), L. Prep. (Ph. L.)

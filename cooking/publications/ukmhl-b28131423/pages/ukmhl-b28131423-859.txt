(Liniment satonneau—P. Cod.) TinC’ ture of soap (P. Cod.) and rectified spirit ('863 or 41 o. p.), of each, 8 parts; olive oil, 1 part. Obs. This article, prepared according to the directions of the Pharmacopoeia, from “ soap made of olive oil and soda” (Castile soap), is apt to gelatinize in cold weather, and to deposit crystals of elaidate and stearate of lime. This may be avoided, when expense is not an objection, by first well drying the soap, employing a spirit of at least 85g, and keeping the preparation in well-closed bottles. A cheaper and better plan is to substitute the ‘ SOET soap’of the Ph. L. (“soap made with olive oil and potassa”) for the Castile soap or- dered by the College. The soft soap of com- merce imparts to the liniment an unpleasant smell. The following formula, one of those commonly adopted by the wholesale druggists, produces a very good article, though much weaker than that of the Pharmacopoeia. 5. (Wholesale.)

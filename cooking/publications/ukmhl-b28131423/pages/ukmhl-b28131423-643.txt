The extract of the shops is usually I prepared by exhausting the root by coction I with water. The products of the first two I of the above formulae, when recent, have a I faint and agreeable odour, and a sweet bitter . taste; those of No. 3, 4, and 5, smell strongly of the recent root, have a pale and lively 1 brownish-yellow colour, and a bitter acidulous i taste, without any trace of sweetness; that of the last one is devoid of odour, and possesses a coflfee-brown colour, and a sweetish, burnt taste, not much unlike a solution of burnt sugar. The medicinal virtue of this extract is greatest when the aroma and bitter taste of the recent root is well developed; and when sweet, its efficacy as a remedy is impaired. (Squire.) Taraxacum root should be gathered during the winter months, when the quantity of the product is looked at; as then a given weight of the juice yields more extract; but in summer and autumn it possesses' more bitter- ness and aroma. 4 lb. of juice from roots gathered in November and December yielded 1 lb. of extract, while it took from 6 to 9 lb. of juice from the root, gathered in spring or summer, to yield a like quantity. (Squire.) The herb yields by the evaporation of its ex- pressed juice, about 5g of extract. According to Mr. Jacob Bell, the average yield of 1 cwt. of root is about 7A lb. (‘ Pharm. Journ.,^ x, 446.) Good extract of taraxacum should be wholly soluble in water. Dose. 10 gr. to dr.; as a resolvent, aperient, and tonic, in liver and stomach complaints, &c. Extract of Tea. Syn.

69 ALCOHOLOMETRY. former must therefore be deducted from the ‘latter/ and the difference (4) put as the numerator of the fraction, having for its de- nominator the number (13) found in the column of ‘ differences ’ against 9596. The fraction so found, added to the per-centage strength opposite ’9609 in the first column, gives 33/g as the true per-centage of alcohol in the given sample. The per-centage by weight may be found from this table by multiplying the number of volumes per cent, by *7939 (the sp. gr. of pure alcohol as given in the Table), and dividing the product by the sp. gr. of the sample. The quotient is the number of pounds of alcohol in 100 lb. of the given spirit (very nearly). Thus :—Spirit of '9609 contains 33 volumes of alcohol per cent. Therefore— Sp. gr. alcohol .... *7939 Volumes per cent, in 1 sample ... ./ Sp. gr. of sample *9609 | 26-1987 Weight per cent. . . . 27*265 (nearly). j To make the results strictly agree with the Tables, allowance must be made for the in- crease of the sp. gr. from condensation, and the contraction or expansion of the instru- ment. 2.

The per-centage by weight may be converted into per-centage by volume, by multiplying the former by the sp. gr. of the sample, and dividing the product by the sp. gr. of pure alcohol, as given in the Table. It is, indeed. merely the reverse of the operation described under Table II. Thus:— Sp. gr. of sample . . . *9578 Per-centage by weight. . 30 Sp. gr. of alcohol '7939 —28*7340 Per-centage by volume . 36*2 (nearly).

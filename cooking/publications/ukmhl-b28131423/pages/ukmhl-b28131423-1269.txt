1253 SULPHURIC ETHER—SULPHUROUS ACID. chemical compound of 40 parts anhydrous acid i (1 equivalent), and 9 parts water (1 equiv.), and is therefore styled monohydrated stjl- : pnuRic ACID (normal sulphuric acid— Odliug). Marignac, however, asserts that the ! distilled acid always contains an excess of ' water, and that the true monohydrate can I only he obtained by submitting fuming sul- \ phuric acif/(‘N0RDHAUSEN s.A.')to congelation. According to this chemist, the true monohy- I drate readily freezes in cold weather, and ! remains solid up to 51° Fahr. Two other I definite hydrates of sulphuric acid are generally recognised by chemists, viz.—Bihydrated SULPHURIC ACID (‘ OLACIAL S. A."), having a sp.gr. of 1-78; freezing at about 40° Fahr. ! (47°, Miller); and boiling at about 435° (Ap- john; 401° to 410°, Odling): Terhydrated ' SULPHURIC ACID, having a sp. gr. of 1*632, ; and the boiling-point 348° Fahr.

To rectified j spirit^ 3 parts, add, very gradually, sulphuric I acid, 1 part. It is generally coloured fey letting it stand over a little cochineal. Re- frigerant, and, externally, escharotic. Dose. ! ^ fl. dr. to water, 1 pint; as a cooling drink in j fevers, &c. I Anhy'drous Sulphuric Acid. Syn. Sulphuric ANHYDRIDE, DrY SULPHURIC ACID j ACIDUM SULPHURICUM SINE AQUA, L. Prep. 1. By ! heating Nordhausen acid to about 100° Fahr. j in a glass retort connected with a well-cooled I receiver. 2. By distilling anhydrous bisulphate of soda, ' which has previously been raised to a low red I heat in an earthen retort, to which a receiver j is fitted without the aid of corks. 3. (Barreswill.) 2 parts of the strongest oil of vitriol are gradually added to 3 parts of anhydrous phosphoric acid, contained in a I retort surrounded by a freezing mixture ; when I the compound has assumed a brown colour, the retort is removed from the bath, and con- nected with [a. receiver which is set there in i its place; a gentle heat is now applied to it, j when white vapours pass over into the receiver, 1 and condense there under the form of beautiful I silky crystals. The product equals in weight j tliat of the phosphorus originally employed. I “ If a few drops of water be added, a dangerous , explosion ensues.’^ I Prop. White, silky, asbestos-like crystals; I deliquescing rapidly, and fuming in the air; 1 put into water, it hisses like a red-hot iron; it , melts at 77°, and rapidly volatilizes at 86° 1 Fahr.; it does not redden dry litmus paper; , sp, gr. 1*97 at 78° Fahr. Aromatic Sulphuric Acid. Syn. Elixir of VITRIOL, Acid e. of v. ; Acidum sulphu- , RICUM AROMATICUM (Ph. E. & D.), L. Prep. 1. (Ph. E. & D.) Oil of vitriol, 3^ fl. oz.; ! rectified spirit, 1^ pint; mix, add of powdered .cinnamon, 1^ oz.; powdered ginger, 1 oz.; digest for 6 days (7 days—Ph. D.), and filter. Sp. gr. *974—Ph. D. 2. {Wholesale.) From compound tincture of cinnamon, 1 gall.; oil of vitriol, 1 lb.; mix, and in a week filter. Dose. 10 to 30 drops, in the same cases as the dilute acid. Dilute' Sulphuric Acid. Syn. Spirit of VITRIOL; Acidum sulphuricum dilutum (Ph. L. E. & D.), L. Prep. 1. (Ph. L.) Take of sulphuric acid, 15 fl. dr., and dilute it gradually with distilled water, q. s. to make the whole exactly measure a pint. Sp. gr. 1*103. '*' 1 fl. oz. of this acid is exactly satu- rated by 216 gr. of crystallized carbonate of soda.” 2. (Ph. E.) Sulphuric acid, 1 fl. oz.; water, 13 fl. oz. Sp. gr. 1*090. 3. (Ph. D.) Pure sulphuric acid, 1 fl. oz.; distilled water, 13 oz. Sp. gr. 1*084. 4. (Henry’s.) Sp. gr. 1*135. Has the same saturating power as his hydrochloric and nitric acids. Used for assays. Prop., 4*c. Antiseptic, tonic, and refrigerant. Dose. 10 to 30 drops, largely diluted with water, several times daily; in low typhoid fevers, passive hminorrhages, profuse perspi- ration, in various skin diseases to relieve the itching, in dyspepsia, &e. It is also used externally. Nordhausen Sulphuric Acid. Syn. Fuming- SULPHURIC acid ; ACIDUM SULPHURICUM FUMANS, L. Prep. By distilling calcined protosulphate of iron (‘green vitriol’) in an earthen retort. The product is a brown oily liquid, which fumes in the air, is intensely corrosive, and has a sp. gr. about 1*900. When heated to about 100° Fahr., the anhydrous acid is given off, and ordinary oil of vitriol is left. According to Marignac, crystals of the true monohydrate are formed in this acid when it is submitted to a low temperature. Nordhausen acid is so called from the place of its manufacture in Saxony. It may be re- garded as a DIHYDRATE Containing 2 equiva- lents of anhydrous acid to 1 equiv. of water. It is chiefly used for dissolving indigo. SULPHURIC E'THER. See page 591. SUL'PHUROUS ACID. Syn. Acidum sul- PHUROSUM, L. This acid is freely evolved in the gaseous form when sulphur is burnt in air or dry oxygen, and when the metals are di- gested in hot sulphuric acid; and, mixed with carbonic acid, when charcoal, chips of wood, cork, and sawdust, are treated in the same way. Prep. 1. By the action of sulphuric acid on clippings of copper or mercury at a gentle heat. Pure. 2. (Berthier.) By heating, in a glass retort, a mixture of black oxide of manganese, 100 parts, and sulphur, 12 or 14 parts. Pure. The gas evolved should be collected over mercury, or received into water. 3. (Redwood.) Pounded charcoal, ^ oz.; oil of vitriol, 4s oz.', mix in a retort, apply the heat of a spirit lamp, and conduct the

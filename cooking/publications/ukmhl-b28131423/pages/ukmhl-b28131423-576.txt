Demulcent. Ad libitum. ENAM'EL. A species of vitreoUs varnish, coloured --with metallic oxides, applied in a thin stratum to brightly polished metallic surfaces (copper or gold), on which it is fused by the flame of a lamp urged by the blowpipe, or by the heat of a small furnace. The basis of all enamels/is a highly trans- r parent and fusible glass, called ‘ frit,’ ‘ flux,' t or ‘ PASTE,’ which readily receives a colour on i| the addition of metallic oxides. It may be f made by one or other of the following for- i mulaj:— .. . ; Prep. 1. Read lead, 16 parts; calcined i borax, 3 parts; powdered fimt glass, 12 parts; powdered flints, 4 parts; fuse in a Hessian crucible for 12 hours, then pour it out into \ water, and reduce it to a powder in a biscuit- ware mortar. 2. Tin, 3 parts; lead, 10 parts; mix, calcine in an iron pot at a dull cherry-red heat, and scrape off the oxide as it forms, observing to obtain it quite free from undecomposed metal; then reduce it to fine powder by grinding and / elutriation. In this state it is known among ||* enamellers as ‘ flux’ or ‘ calcine.’ 4 parts of this ‘ calcine ’ are next mixed with an equal weight of pure sand or powdered flints, and 1 part of sea salt, or other alkaline matter; the mixture is then partially fused in a Hes- sian crucible, by which it undergoes semi- vitrification. 3. (Chaptal.) Lead and tin, equal parts; calcine as above, and take of the mixed oxides or ‘ calcine ’ and ground flints, of each, 1 part; pure carbonate of potash, 2 parts ; and pro- ceed as before. 4. (Wynn.) Flint glass, 3 oz.; red lead, 1 oz.; as last. 5. (Wynn.) Red lead,\^ parts; borax (aoi calcined), 11 parts; flint glass, 16 parts; as last. 6. (Wynn.) Powdered flints, 10 parts; nitre and white arsenic, of each, 1 part; as last. Obs. The precise qualities of the products of the above processes depend greatly upon the duration and degree of heat employed. ' By increasing the quantity of sand, glass, or flux, the enamel is rendered more fusible, and i

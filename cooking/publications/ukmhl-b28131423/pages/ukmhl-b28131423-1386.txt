1370 APPENDIX. 1 lb., in distilled water, pint, for 24 hours, then pack in a percolator, and add to it more water (6| pints, or q. s.), until it is exhausted, or until 12 pints are collected. Evaporate the liquor to a proper consistence in the usual manner. (See page 624.) Extract or Rhubarb (Extractum Rhei). Macerate sliced or bruised rhubarb, 1 lb., in distilled water, 5 pints, and rectified spirit, 10 fl. oz.; decant, press, and set by, that the un- dissolved matter may subside; pour off the clear, filter the remainder, mix the two liquors, and evaporate at a temperature not exceeding 160°. (See ^^a^e 624.) Liquid Extract of Sarsaparilla (Ex- tractum Sars^ liquidum). Macerate Ja- maica sarsaparilla (not split), 1 lb., in distilled water (at 160°), 7 pints, for 6 hoims, and decant the liquor. Digest the residue in 7 pints more for the same time; express, and filter the mixed liquors, and evaporate them by a water bath to 7 fl. oz., or until the sp. gr. is 1‘13. When cold, add rectified spirit, 1 fl. oz., which ought to reduce the sp. gr. to about 1*095. (See page 625.) Extract of Stramonium (Extractum Stramonii). a tincture made from coarsely powdered stramonium seeds and proof spirit, by percolation, is submitted to distillation; the residue, from which the spirit has been driven off, is then evaporated to a proper con- sistence. (See joaye 626.) Extract of Taraxacum (Extractum Taraxaci). From fresh dandelion roots, as extract of colchicum {above), maintaining the temperature of 212°, in the first part of the process, for 10 minutes. (See page 627.) Liquid Extract of Yellow Cinchona (Extractum Cinchon^e flav^ liquidum). Macerate the coarsely powdered bark, 1 lb., in distilled water, 2 pints, for 24 hours, stirring frequently; then percolate with more water until 12 pints have been collected, or a suffi- cient quantity to exhaust the bark. Evapo- rate, at a temperature not exceeding 160°, to a pint; then filter through paper, and again evaporate to 3 fl. oz, or until the sp. gr. is 1*200. Wlien cold, add, gradually, rectified spirit, 1 fl. oz., stirring constantly. The sp. gr. should be about 1*100. This corresponds with ‘ Infusum Cinchonse spissatum,’ Ph. L. (See page 850.) Fennel—Fceniculum. Sweet fennel root from Malta. (See page 634.) Fern Root—Filix. Described in Mat. Med. as “the rhizome” of Aspidium Felix mas, dried; collected in summer. (See page 635.) Fig—Ficus. “The dried fruit;” from Smyrna. (See page 637.) Flour. Placed in Appendix as an article used in the preparation of medicines. Fousel Oil. Also in Appendix. “ Sp. gr. *818; boiling-point, 270°.” (See page 676.) Frankincense (Common)—Thus America- NUM. From Pinus Taida and P. palustris. “ The concrete turpentine.” (See page 665.) Galbanum—Galbanum. “ A gum-resin, derived from an unascertained umbelliferous plant; imported from India and the Levant.” Gallic Acid—Acidum gallicum. This is ordered to be prepared by the Ph. D. form (5, a, page 678). The paste is kept for 6 weeks at a temperature of between 60° and 70°, dis- tilled water being added from time to time, to supply that lost by evaporation. To obtain the first crop of crystals, this paste is boiled for 20 minutes with 45 fl. oz. of distilled water; the liquor strained through calico, and cooled, and the crystalline deposit drained on a filter, and pressed strongly between folds of filtering paper. The remaining portion of the process is well described on page 678. Galls—Galla. “ Of a bluish-green colour on the surface, yellowish-white within, with a small central cavity.” {Seepage 679.) Gamboge—Cambogia. “ Imported from Siam.” (See page 679.)

Ginger—Zingiber. “ Irregular-lobed de- corticated pieces, 3 or 4 inches long, subcoin- pressed, yellowish-white, but not chalky on the surface, with a short mealy fructure, hot taste, and agreeable odour.” (See page 692.) Glycerine—Gltcerinum. Introduced for the first time in the Pharmacopoeia. Its sp. gr. is fixed at 1*26, which is higher than is required for medical purposes, and above that of the best glycerine of commerce. (See page 702.) Gold (Fine). Named in Appendix as an article employed in analysis. Guaiac Resin—Guaiaci Resina; Guaiacum (Ph. L.). Described as “ the resin obtained from the stem, hy natural exudation, by in- cisions, or by heat.” The potato test of Ph. E. is given. (See page 714.)

Hemidesmus—Hemidesmus. “The root” of Hemidesmus indicus, “ dried; imported from India.” Its characters are given as “yellowish- brown; cylindrical, tortuous, furrowed, and with annular cracks, having a fragrant odour and a very agreeable flavour.” This drug has been introduced from the Ph. D. It is diu- retic and alterative. Hemlock—Conium. “ The fresh leaves and branches of wild British plants” of Conium maculatum, “gathered when the fruit begins to form, and the leaves dried in the sun, or at a temperature not exceeding 120°.” (See page 728.)

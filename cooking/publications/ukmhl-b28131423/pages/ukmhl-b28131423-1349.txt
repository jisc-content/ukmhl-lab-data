WEIGHT. 1333 I for sealing official documents kept in tin boxes; (j also as a cement. 6. (Bottle wax.)—a. {Black.) From black i resin, 6^ lb.; bees’ wax, ^ lb.; finely powdered ivory black, 1^ lb.; melted together.—b. {Red.) ij As the last, hut substitute Venetian red or red I, lead for ivory-black. [ Obs. All the above forms for * fine? wax ij produce ‘superfine* by employing the best ji qualities of the ingredient^; and ‘extra super- I fine,’ or ‘scented* by adding Ig of balsam of Peru or liquid storAx to the ingredients when I considerably cooled. The ‘variegated* and j ‘fancy coloured kinds* are commonly scented with a little essence of musk or ambergris, or any of the more fragyant essential oils. The addition of a little camptior, or spirit of wink, f makes sealing-wax burn easier. Sealing-wax ■ containing resin, or too much turpentine, runs into thin drops at the flame of a candle. White Wax. Syn. Bleached wax ; Ceea I ALBA (Ph. L. E. & D.), tr. Prep. Prom pure bees* wax, by exposing it in thin flakes to. the action of the sun, wind, and rain, frequently J changing the surface thus exposed, by remelt- ing it, and reducing it again to thin flakes, j Used in making candles, and in white oint- ments, pommades, &c., for the sake of its colour. Block white wax (ceea alba in MASSis) is the above when cast into blocks; the best foreign is always in this form. Viegin WAX (cake white wax ; CEEA ALBA IN OFEIS) should be the last made into round flat cakes; but this is seldom the case, the mixture sold under the name generally, containing from I l-3rd to l-2nd its weight of spermaceti. The j ‘white wax^ supplied by certain wholesale ‘ druggists to their customers is often totally unfit for the purposes to which it is applied. Spermaceti is constantly added to the white wax of commerce, to improve its colour. Mr. I B. S. Proctor states that wholesale houses of the highest reputation supply an article, as i white cake wax, which is in many cases half ' spermaceti, and in some as much as two thirds ‘ spermaceti to one of wax.^ WEIGHT. The quantity of a body deter- mined by means of a balance, and expressed in terms having reference to some known stand- ard; the measure of the force of gravity, from which the relative quantity of a body is inferred. The relation between the weight and volume of a body, compared to a given standard taken as unity, constitutes its spe- cific GEAVITY. For the purpose of weighing, a balance or lever is required, which, when accurately sus- pended in a state of equilibrium, will be affected, in precisely an equal manner, by like weights applied to its extremities. Hence, the construction of such an instrument is not more difficult than its application is important in chemical and philosophical research. Oertling, the most celebrated maker of the chemical balance, constructs this important instrument in seven different varieties, more or less ela- borate. The largest of these, with a 16-inch beam, will carry 2 lb. in each pan, and yet turn with Tggth of a grain. A balance with arms of unequal length or weight will weigh as accu- rately as another of tlie same workmanship with equal arms, provided the substance weighed be removed and standard weights placed in the same scale until the equilibrium be again restored, when the weights so em- ployed, being exactly in tbe same condition as the substance previously occupying the scale, will, of course, indicate its proper weight. A knowledge of this fact is useful, as it enables any one to weigh correctly with unequal scales, or with any suspended lever. Small weights may be made of thin leaf brass, or, preferably, of platinum foil. Quantities below the 100th of a gr. may be either esti- mated by the position of;the index, or shown by actually counting rings of wire, tbe va- lue of which has been previously determined. The readiest way to subdivide small weights consists in weighing a certain quantity of very fine wire, and afterwards cutting it into such parts, by measure, as are desired; or the wire may be wrapped close round two pins, and then cut asunder with a knife. By this means it will be divided into a great number of equal lengths, or small rings.^ The following Tables represent the values and relative proportions of the principal weights employed in Commerce and the Arts:— I.

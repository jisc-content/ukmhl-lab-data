160 AMMONIURET—AMULET. f 4-t The sp. gr. of any sample of liquid am- monia, expressed in ‘three integers/ deducted from ‘998, and the ‘ remainder' divided by 4, gives’a number which represents theper-centage strength, nearly. (Ure.) This Rule may he sometimes conveniently employed for rough calculations, in the absence of Tables.

AMMONI'URET* ( -nl'-u-ret; -mone'-u-J; -mon'-, as marked by a recent med. lexico- grapher, is unusual). Syn. Ammon/aret* ; Ammoniure'tem, L. ; Ammoniure, Fr. In chemistry, a compound formed by the solution of a substance in ammonia; a term formerly more particularly applied to supposed com- pounds of ammonia and metallic oxides. These are now ascertained to be either double salts of ammonia and the metals {ex., ‘ ammonio- sulphate of copper ’), or salts in which a me- tallic oxide plays the part of an acid {ex., ‘ aurate of ammonia ’). AM'MON Y*. The Anglicised form of the word ammonia. Although easily uttered, it is not in general use. (Webster.) AM'NIC ACIDf. See Allantoine. AMNIoriC ACIDf. See Allantoine. AMONTILLADO. [Sp.] See Sherry and Wine. AMORPH'OUS (-morf-iis). Syn. Amorph'us, L.; Amorphe, Informe, Difforme, Fr.; Amorphisch, Misgebildet, Missgestaltet, Ger. Shapeless. In chemistry and mineralogy, applied to substances devoid of regular form ; as a lump of chalk, the majority of pre- cipitates, &c. The corresponding substantives are amorph'ism, amorph'oesness* {amor- phis'mus, L.; amorphisme, Fr.). AMPHIBIA (-Hb'.y’a). [L. pi.; prim. Gr.] Syn. Amphib'ians (-yanz), Amphib'ials (.y’alz). Animals that possess the faculty of living both in water and on land. In modern zoology, it is restricted to those animals which possess both gills and lungs; as the batrach'ia or frog tribe. The term is also often applied, colloquially, to otters, seals, walruses, croco- diles, &c., none of wLich can breathe under water, although, from the languid nature of their circulation, they are able to remain a long time in it. AMPHIBIOUS (y’us). Syn. AmphibTfs, L.; Amphibie, Fr.; Beydlebig, Ger. In botany and zoology, having the faculty of growing or living both on land and in water. See Amphibia. ] AM'PHID (-fid). In chemistry, consisting f of acid and base ; not haloid. It is also some- times used substantively. i AM'PHITYPE (-fe-). See Photography. AMPUTA'TION. [Eng., Fr.] Syn. Ampu- ta'tio, L. An excision or cutting off. In surgery, the removal of a limb or part of a limb, or other dependent or projecting por-; tion of the body, by manual operation and instruments. The application of the term is. usually confined to operations on the limbs or extremities; the removal of a breast, lip, jaw, joint, morbid growths, &c., being more i generally called ‘ excision.’ See Excision : (Surgical), Fracture, Hjsmorrhage, Limbs, ■ Surgery, &c. AM'ULET (-U-). Syn. Amule'tum, L.;;! Amulette, Periamme, &c., Fr.; Umhangsel, ' Obhut, Wacht, Zaubermittel, &c., Ger. : Something wmrn about the person under the belief of its protecting the wearer against real or imaginary evil, as witchcraft or disease; or that it endows him with some special gift, as i courage, perseverance, strength, eloquence, &c. ! The ignorant and credulous of all nations, and all ages, have been fond of charms or' amulets. The Egyptians and Persians had si a great variety, which are said to have con- ji sisted of small cylinders variously ornamented j: with figures and hieroglyphics. Among the i1 Greeks and Romans they were much used in,' exciting or conquering the power of love. ■ These consisted of a variety of gems, metals, J and plants, small figures of deities, heroes, or fl animals, the bulla, and not unfrequently of* words, characters, or letters, arranged in a* certain order. They were appended to thejB neck or body, and were commonly attached to ■ children to defend them from the evil eye.jH Among the Christians of the early ages,lH amulets were made of wood represented to|H

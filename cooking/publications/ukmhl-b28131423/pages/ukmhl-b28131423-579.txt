563 ENEMA. 1 ministration of a purgative by the mouth, as i well as in cases requiring a direct medication I of the lower bowels, as in dysentery, colic, &c. 1 As a mere laxative, an injection of tepid water, \ milk-and-water, or water gruel, will generally be found sufficient. By the addition of 1 or 2 table-spoonfuls of common salt, Epsom salts, \salad oil, or molasses, to this laxative enema, it will form an excellent purgative one, which will, in most cases, induce a full discharge. In all cases, the patient should be directed to retain the in jection for as long a time as possible, and !not to attempt to empty his bowels immediately 'after the reception of the medicine. “ In irri- gation of the Madder, rectum, or uterus, an \anodyne injection or enema often affords much {relief. In diseases of the lower howels, clysters | are also of almost indispensable utility, as also ' in the dislodgment of ascarides seated in the rectum; nor are they less beneficial in those cases of sudden sinking of the powers of life ,where deglutition is impossible, and yet a ^prompt stimulating impression is requisite to save the patient; under such circumstances, clysters of some of the diffusible stimuli have proved of the greatest benefit.'^ The injection of large quantities of liquid natter into the bowels, as well as the constant ise of clysters (even of warm water only), is I leemed by the highest medical authorities to 36 injurious, and, occasionally, dangerous. The practice should not, therefore, be allowed to ?row into a habit. The bowels continually iccustomed to a stimulant cease to act without )ne. The same remarks apply to aperients paken by the mouth. !

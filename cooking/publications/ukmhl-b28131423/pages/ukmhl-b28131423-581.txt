The art of producing de- signs or figures on metal, wood, &c., by incision or corrosion, usually for the purpose of b^eing subsequently printed on paper, calico, or other materials. The mechanical operations of the engraver do not come within the province of this work. Several of the materials which he employs in his trade will, however, be found noticed under their respective heads. There is this important difierencebetweenen- gravingon metal ])lates and wood-engraving: in theformer all the lines and dots that are toprint black are hollowed out with a graving-tool, or ‘ bitten in’ by acid ; in the latter all the parts that are to appear white in the impression are cut away, and the lines which produce the imprint are left on the face of the block. Casts of wood-btocks, or ‘stereos,’ are often used instead of the original blocks when a great number of impressions are required. To pro- duce them stucco moulds are prepared, and from these the casts in type metal are taken. The casts are usually • about ^ in. thick, and have to be screwed upon wooden blocks to bring them to the height of the types which are printed with them. As soon as one cast is worn out another inay bo taken, and the ori- ginal block is thus jiresorvcd in the state in which it left the engraver’s hands. For the reproduction of engraved metallic plates the electeotype peocess is commonly employed. Woodcuts are also copied, thongli less frequently, by this process. The mode by which the postage-stamp plates are mul- tiplied is as follows :—210 ‘ queen’s heads’ or stamps (a pound’s worth) are engraved on

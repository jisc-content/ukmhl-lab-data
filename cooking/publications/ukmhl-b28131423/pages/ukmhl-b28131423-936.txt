As the above mixture contains very little spirit, and from its great consumption, being made in large quantities at a time, it frequently spoils before the whole is sold, especially in hot weather. To avoid this, If dr. of cloves and 3 dr. of mustard seed, both bruised, may be added to every gall, of the strained liquor at the same time with the salts, spirit, and colouring, after which it must be shaken up repeatedly for a few days, and then allowed to repose for a few days more, when it will become quite clear. It may be filtered through a flannel bag, but there is much loss and delay, owing to the consistence of the liquid. It is purgative in doses of 1 to If fl. oz.

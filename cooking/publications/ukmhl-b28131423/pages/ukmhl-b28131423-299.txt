Ac'id bathJ (as'-), Niteo-mueiat'ic bN. a. b.* ; BAL'NEUil NITEO - HYDE0CHL0"EICTJM, B. AC'IDI (as'-), B. A. NITEO-nYDEOCHLO"EICI, B. A. niteo-mueiat'ici*, &c., L. :—1. Water slightly acidulated with the acid so that its sourness to the taste is about that of common vinegar. According to Ainslie, 1 oz. of acid is sufficient for 1 gal. of water? Other for- mula in use are— 2. ' (Cutan. Hosp.) Nitric acid, lb.; hydro- chloric acid, 1 lb.; for a bath of 60 to 70 gal. 3. (Soubeiran.) Nitro-hydrochloric acid, 4 to 16 fl. oz.; according to the case. 4. (Dr. Scott.)

In its. weaker forms, in skin- diseases depending on disordered liver; in others, chie% in liver-complaints, and to re- lieve the pain on the passing of gall-stones. It must be contained in an enamelled or wooden vessel, and may be used as a hip, knee, or foot- bath ; a knee-bath being the one generally adopted in England. Dr. Scott, of Bombay, who first brought this bath into notice, once plunged the Duke of Wellington up to his chin in one, in India, and thus cured him of a severe hepatic aflection. In its stronger form it causes tingling and pricking of the skin, and a peculiar taste in the mouth, and affects the gums and salivary glands, often producing plentiful ptyalism, without which, indeed, its advocates regard its action as incomplete. Time of application, 15 to 20 minutes daily, for a fortnight or three weeks ; and after- wards, every second or third day.^ Oak' Bark Bath. Syn. Bal'neum quee'cuS, B. qttee'ci, L.

Immersion in the sea, or in recent sea-water (temperate, tepid, warm, or hot). Owing to the saline matter which it contains, it possesses stimulant, alterative, and resolvent properties, superadded to those of pure water at the corresponding temperature. When taken, in summer, on our coasts, the ‘ reaction ’ and ‘ glow ’ follow more speedily and certainly than after a common water- bath ; and it may be taken with greater safety, and for a longer period. It often proves very serviceable in diseases accompanied with de- bility, in phthisis, scrofula, glandular enlarge- ments, &c. A warm or hot sea-water bath is one of the most restorative imaginable; oft^n removing the effects of fatigue and exposure— exhaustion, stiff* joints, cramxis, rheumatism, &c.—like a charm.

Common salt, 8 lb.; sul- phate of magnesia, 2 lb.; chloride of calcium, 1 lb.; water, 50 to 60 gal. 3. Salt, a handful; water, pailful; flour of mustard, 1 oz. For a ‘ foot-bath.’^ Sec Watees.

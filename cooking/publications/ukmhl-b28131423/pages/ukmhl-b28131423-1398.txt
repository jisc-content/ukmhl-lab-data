There is only one officinal salt of quinia, besides the citrate of iron and quinia noticed among the iron preparations; this is now called— Stjbphate op Quinia (Quinij: Sulphas j Q. Disulphas, Ph. L.). The process for i preparing it is new :—Moisten coarsely pow- 5 dered yellow cinchona bark, 1 lb., with dilute sulphuric acid, and allow it to macerate, with occasional stirring, for 24 hours; then place it in a percolator, and treat with hydro- chloric acid, 3 fl. oz., diluted with distilled water, 10 pints, until the droppings are nearly destitute of hitter taste. Now pour into the liquid solution of soda, 4 pints, agitate, and, jj after subsidence, decant the supernatant fluid; *• collect the precipitate on a filter, and wash with ’ cold distilled water until the washings lose colour. Place precipitate in distilled water, 1 pint, heat gradually on a steam hath, and add dilute sulphuric acid until very nearly the whole of the precipitate is dissolved. Filter, while hot, through paper, washing the filter with boiling distilled water ; concentrate till a film forms, and set aside to crystallize. Dry the crystals on filtering paper, without heat.

5G1 I ENAMEL. I the opacity and whiteness is increased by the I addition of oxide of tin. The use of borax > should be avoided, or it should be used spar- ingly, as it is apt to make the enamel etHoresce 1 and lose colour. ; Black Enamel. P.rep. 1. Calcined iron i (protoxide), 12 parts; oxide of cobalt, 1 part; j mix, add an equal weight of white flux, and I fuse, as before. 2. (Clouet.) Pure clay, 3 parts; protoxide of iron, 1 part. A fine black. 3. Peroxide of manganese, 3 parts; zajfre, 1 part; mix, and add it, as required, to white j flux. Blue Enamel. Prep. 1. White ^frit ’ or ‘flux’ coloured with oxide of cobalt. j 2. Sand, red lead, and nitre, of each, 10 I parts; flint glass or ground flints, 20 parts; i oxide of cobalt, 1 part, more or less; depend- ing on the des’.red depth of colour. Brown Enamel. Prep. 1. Manganese, 5 'parts; red lead, 16 parts; flint powder, 8 ; parts; as before. 2. (Wynn.) Manganese, 9 parts; red lead, 34 parts ; flint powder, 16 parts. 3. Red lead and calcined iron, of each, 1 part; antimony, litharge, and sand, of each, 2 parts. To be added in any required pro- portion to ivhite ‘frit,’ according to the colour desired. A little oxide of cobalt or zajfre is I frequently added to alter the shade, j Green Enamel. Prep. 1. ‘ Ftux’ or ‘frit,’ 2 lb.; black oxide of copper, 1 oz. ; as before. j 2. As the last, but adding red oxide of iron, j 5 dr. Less decisive. j 3. Coj)per dust and litharge, of each, 2 oz. ; I nitre, 1 oz. ; sand, 4 oz.; ‘flux ’ or ‘frit,’ q.s. 4. From transparent ‘frit,’ any quantity; oxide of chromium, q. s. to colour. Colour j superb ; it will stand a great heat; in common j hands, however, it frequently turns on the 1 dead-leaf tinge. 5. Transparent ‘flux’ 5 oz. ; black oxide of I copper, 20 to 40 gr.; oxide of chromium, 2 gr. i llesembles the emerald. j 6. From blue and yellow enamel mixed in the I required proportions. I Ol'ive Enamel. Prep. Blue enamel, 2 parts ; 1 black and yellow enamel, of each, 1 part. See 1 Bkown Enamel. j Or'ange Enamel. Prep. 1. Red lead, 12 1 parts; red sulphate of iron and oxide of anti- \ rnony, of each, 1 part; flint powder, 3 parts; I calcine togetlier, powder, and melt with ‘flux,’ ' 50 parts. j 2. (Wynn.) Red lead, 12 parts; oxide of I antimony, 4 parts; flint powder, 3 parts; red 1 sulphate of iron, 1 part; calcine, then add I ‘flux’ 5 parts, to every 2 parts of this mix- ! ture. j Pur'ple Enamel. Prep. 1. ‘ Flux ’ or ‘frit’ I coloured with oxide of gold, purple precipitate I of cassias, or peroxide of manganese. I 2. Sulplair, nitre, green vitriol, antimony, and oxide of tin, of each, 1 lb.; red lead, 60 lb.; mix, fuse, cool, powder, and add rose copper (red oxide), 19 oz.; zajfre, 1 oz.; crocus martis, \\ oz. ; borax, 3 oz. ; and of a compound formed of gold, silver, and mercury, 1 lb.; fuse, stirring the melted mass with a co])per rod all the time, then place it in cru- cibles, and submit them to the action of a reverberatory furnace for 24 hours. This is said to be the purple enamel used in the mosaic pictures in St. Peter’s at Rome. Eed Enamel. Prep. 1. ‘ Paste ’ or ‘flux’ coloured with the red oxide or protoxide of copper. Should the colour pass into the green or brown, from the partial peroxidation of the copper, from the heat being raised too high, the red colour may be restored by the addition of any cai’bonaceous matter, as tallow, or charcoal. 2. By tinging the glass or ‘flux ’ with the oxide or salts of gold, or with the jmrple pre- cipitate of cassms. These substances produce shades of red, inclining to crimson or purple of the most exquisite hue. The enamel often comes from the fire quite colourless, and after- wards receives its rich hue at the lamp. 3. (Wynn.) Sulphate of iron (calcined dark), 1 part; a mixture of 6 parts of ‘flux ’ (No. 5), and 1 of colcothar, 3 parts. Dark red. 4. (Wynn.) Red sulphate of iron, 2 parts; ‘flux’ (No. 1), 6 parts; white lead, 3 parts. Light red. Eose-coroured Enamel. Prep. Purple enamel (or its elements), 3 parts; ‘flux’ 90 parts; mix, and add silver leaf or oxide of silver, 1 part, or less. Transpa'Tent Enamel. The ‘frit’ or ‘flux’ described above. Vi'olet Enamel. Prep. 1. Purple enamel, 2 parts; red enamel (No. 2), 3 parts; ‘frit,’ 6 parts. 2. Saline or alkaline ‘frit’ or ‘flux,’ any quantity; peroxide of manganese, q. s. to colour. As the tint depends on the metal being at the maximum of oxidation, contact with oily or carbonaceous substances should be particularly avoided. White Enamel. Prep. 1. ‘ Calcine’ (from 2 parts of tin and 1 part of lead), 1 part; fine crystal glass or ‘frit,’ 2 parts; manganese, a few grains; powder, mix, melt, and pour the fused mass into clean water; again powder, and fuse, and repeat the whole process 3 or 4 times, avoiding contamination with smoke, dirt, or oxide of iron. A fine dead white. 2. Washed diaphoretic antimony, 1 part; flue glass (free from lead), 3 parts; mix, and proceed as before. Very fine. 3. Lead, 30 parts; tin, 33 parts; calcine as before, then fuse 50 parts of this ‘calcine’ with an equal weight oi' flints, in powder, and 100 parts of salt of tartar. A fine dead white enamel. Obs. For white enamel, the articles must be perfectly free from foreign admixture, as this would impart a colour. When well managed, 36

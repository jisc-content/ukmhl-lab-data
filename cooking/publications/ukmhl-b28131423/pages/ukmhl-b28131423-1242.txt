Spirituous liquors, like all other fluids at common temperatures, expand when they are heated, and diminish in volume when they are cooled. It is found that 1000 gall, of proof spirit, measured at the temperature of 50° Fahr., will, if re-measured at 59°, be found to have increased in bulk to fully 1004^ gall, j whilst 1000 gall, of the same spirit, measured at 77° Fahr., will be only equal to 991^ gall, at 59°. These changes are still more marked at higher strengths, and at extreme temperatures, and, from not being recognizable by the hydro- meter, often lead to serious losses in trade, and to serious fluctuations in ‘ stock,’ which, to those unaware of the action of temperature, are perfectly unaccountable. A gallon of proof spirit only weighs 9^ lb. at 60° Fahr. At a higher temperature it will weigh less—at . lower one, more; but as this weight const! tutes the standard gallon at the temperature the proof is calculated for, it is manifest thai any variations from it must result in loss eithei to the buyer or seller. Hence the equity o buying and selling liquors by weight, insteac* of by measure. The stock-keeper in everjl wholesale house, as well as every excise officer" should be aware of this fact, and on'takinj, stock ’ should as regularly enter the temperature of his cellars in his stock-book as he does th<l ‘ dip ’ or ‘ wet inches.’ See Alcohol, Alco^ HOLOMETEY, SPECIETC Geavity, Spieits (Me- dicinal), Spieits (Perfumed), &c. i Amyl'ic Spirit.

A little of this paste or powder, triturated with a sufficient portion of water, and strained through a piece of calico, forms emulsion of almonds. “ This confection will keep longer sound, if the almonds, first decor- ticated (blanched), dried, and rubbed into the finest powder, he mixed with the acacia and sugar, separately powdered, and the mixed in- gredients he kept in a well-stoppered bottle.” (Ph, L.) The same effect may he arrived at by simply well-drying the blanched almonds before mixing them with the gum and sugar. The addition of even a small quantity of water or syrup causes the confection “ to be- come soon mouldy, or rancid, or both.” (Brande.) Confection of Al'um. Syn. Confectio alu'minis, L. Pi'cp. 1.

Very laright coloured. Obs. In the wholesale trade this article is kept under two forms—one, in powder, as ordered by the College, and commonly called for distinction sake pulvTs confectio'nis aeomatTc.e ; the other, mixed up ready for use. In preparing the latter, it is a common plan to make a strong infusion or decoction of the saffron, and to use it to mix up the other ingredients, adding the aromatics last. (See 4, b.) When the price of precipitated chalk is an objection to its use, prepared chalk may be used instead. There is much anxiety evinced by the wholesale driiggists to prepare this confection of a rich colour, without an undue expenditure of saffron, which is generally economised on account of its costliness. This confection is cordial, stimulant, antacad, and carminative.

Dr. Paris, some years since, declared that they consisted of Barbadoes aloes, jalap, and oil of aniseed. “ A cai’eful examination of the pro- prietary article, with other facts that have come to our knowledge, leads us to believe that the first of the following formulae is the one now employed in the preparation of the * Geana Angelica,’ or ‘ Andeeson’s Teue Scot’s Pills,’ of the present day.” (Cooley.) Prep. 1. From Barbadoes aloes, 7 lb. ; jalap (in fine powder), 2t lb.; treacle, ^ lb.; soap, 6 oz.; melted together by the heat of a water bath, and, when partly cold, aromatized by stirring in of oil of aniseed, 1 oz. The mass is divided into about 3^-gr. pills, of which 26 or 27 are placed in each Is. l^d. box. A mild and useful aperient. Dose. 5 to 15 gr., or more. 2. (Original formula.) Socotrine aloes, 1 oz.; best myrrh, oz.; saffron, 1 dr.; sepa- rately pounded very fine; mix them, in an earthen pipkin, with a spoonful each of water and sweet oil, by the heat of a slow fire, and form the mass into “ common-sized pills.” From a copy of the original document in the Chapel of the Rolls. 3.

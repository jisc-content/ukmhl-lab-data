ALCOHOLOMETRY. 71 tallied by any of the usual methods, and the result divided by three, when the per-centage of alcohol in the ‘ original liquor’ is at once obtained. If, from want of attention, more than 100 parts should be distilled over, the number which expresses the relation of the volume of the distilled product to the original bulk of the liquor tested, must be employed as the divisor. Thus : if 106 parts of liquor have distilled over (instead of 100) containing 33g of alcohol, the 300 must be divided by 106, which gives 2*83, and the 33g by this 2-83, which gives ll*66g, the true proportion of alcohol in the original liquor. The strength at ‘ proof’ may be calculated from this in th^e usual way. In adopting this method we find that, to insure accurate results, the acidity (if any) of the liquor, must be neutralised with carbonate of soda, prior to distillation. We also always add 8g or 10§ of common salt to the liquor in the retort or still; which, by raising the boiling point, causes the whole of the spirit to pass over into the receiver before the distillate has reached the required measure. This applies more particularly to weak liquors. With those of greater strength (as the stronger wines), our plan is to draw over 150 parts, when we divide the result by 2, instead of 3. To liquors stronger than 25g by ‘volume’ of alcohol, or above 52 to 54g under proof, we add about an equal volume of water to the liquor in the stiU, and draw over a quantity equal to that of the sample tested; when the alcoholic strength of the distillate gives, with- out calculation, the true strength sought. To -liquors stronger than 48g to 50§ (14 to 12 u. p.), we add thrice their of water, do not stop the process until the volume of the distillate is double that of the sample tested; when the per-centage obtained must also be doubled. In each case a proportionate quan« tity of salt is employed. b. From the tempeeatuee of the vapoue, as originally proposed by Groning.—The bulb of a thermometer is thrust through a cork, or a piece of vulcanized India-rubber, into the head of the still, or other vessel employed; and the temperature of the vapour in which it is inrmersed being noted, is sought in the fol- lowing Table:— Table VI.—Shewing the Alcoholic Content,by ‘volume’, of Boiling Spirits, and of their Vapour, from the Temperature of the ‘ latter^ as observed by a thermometer.

This method may be applied on either the large or the small scale; and is admirably adapted to the purposes of the distiller and rectifier, as it furnishes a ready means of ap- proximately determining the strength of the spirit passing over at every part of the process of distillation, as well as that of the wash left in the still. It is much to be regretted that we are not in possession of a more extensive and comprehensive Table. c. From the boiling point, as originally proposed by M. I’Abbe Brossard-Vidal.—This method is founded on the fact that the boiling points of mixtures of alcohol and water, unlike water alone, are scarcely disturbed by the ad- dition of saline, saccharine, or extractive mat- ter, within certain limits. It hence offers a ready means of determining the proportion of alcohol present in spirits, wines, fermented liquors, ^c., with sufficient accuracy for all ordinary purposes. In applying it, a simple thermometer,with a large bulb and avery narrow bore, and a movable scale graduated from about 180° to 212°Fahr., is usually employed. Before using the instrument as an alcoholometer, it is set, with its bulb immersed, in a small metallic boiler (brass or copper) containing distilled or pure soft water, which is then raised to the boiling point, by the heat of a spirit-lamp, and the 212° of the scale accM- adjusted on alevel with the surface of the mercury, should it vary from that point.^ It is then ready for several hours’ operations, and, 1 This adjustment is necessary on account of variations of atmospheric pressure causing coiTesponding variatiou0 ‘ of tlie boiling points of liquids.

The whole operation (with these ex- ceptions) may be performed in two to five minutes, and furnishes very reliable approxi- mative results, as we have personally proved by its actual employment several thousand times. In most cases the decolouring part of the process may be omitted. The alcohol thus separated has usually a sp. gr. varying from *8061 to *8118, and contains 3-^ or 4^ of water; biit which, for all ordinary purposes, may be regarded as pure alcohol. When greater accuracy is necessary, our plan is first to test an alcohol of the standard ‘ proof- strength,^ or (what is better) one of 50^ by volume, and then to deduce from the ratio which the observed strength of this standard alcohol bears to its known strength, that also of the sample, or samples, under trial, by the common ‘ Rule of Three.’ In this way any cor- rections as to temperature, &c., may be avoided. 4. Alcoholometry of minute quantities of liquid. When only a few drops, or a quantity too small for the application of the preceding methods, can be obtained, an organic analysis may be had recourse to, and the quantity of absolute alcohol calculated from that of the re- sulting carbonic acid and water; care being previously taken to free the sample from other volatile bodies, if it contains any of them. Gen. Commentary. The duties on spihits, in England, are charged on the number of proof gallons they contain, which is ascertained by first ‘ gau^ing^ or ‘uUaginf the liquor, and then ‘ trying its strength’ by Sykes’s hydro- meter, in the way already described; when the per-centage content of ‘ proof spirit’ thus found multiplied by the ‘ gauge’ or ‘ ullage’ gallons, gives the net amount of proof spirit in the quantity surveyed. The ‘ PEOOE steength’ is an arbitrary stand- ard, adopted for the purpose of facilitating cal- culations, for which it is well suited; althougli pure alcohol would, for this purpose, be more simple and convenient. As defined by Act of Parliament,! proof spirif’ is such, “ as shall, at the temperature of 51° of Fahrenheit’s ther- mometer, weigh exactly twelve-thirteenth parts of an equal measure of distilled water.’* Its sp. gr., at that temperature, is stated to be *923; and at 60° Fahr., *920. It is usually said that it contains in 100 parts, by weight, 49g of absolute alcohol, and 51g of water ; and by VOLUME, about 56g of alcohol, and 44g of water; but the last is evidently erroneous, owing to no allowance being made for the variation of volume resulting from condensation. From the more recent researches of Drinkwater and Fownes, it appears that the true composition of PKOOE SPIEIT is— By WEIGHT. By VOLUME. Sp. Gr. at 60° Balir. Bulk before admixture.

The STANDAED ALCOHOL of the Revenue authorities, and that on which Mr. Gilpin’s (Revenue) Tables are founded, is a spirit of the sp. gr. *825 at 60° Fahr.; which is said to contain, by weight, 89g of pure alcohol of *796, and 118 of water; and 92*68 of alcohol, by volume, which corresponds to about 62| g o.p. According to Mr. Fownes, however, spirit of *825 contains 89ggof anhydrous alcohol (*7938), by weight; whilst one of 89g has the higher sp. gr. of *8254. It is of great importance to the spirit-dealer to be able to estimate correctly the number of ‘ proof gallons’ in any quantity of his commo- dities, or in the whole or any portion of his stock ; as disagreeable errors frequently result from ignorance on this point. Calculations of this kind are extremely simple and straight- forward. Thus, when we find, by the hydro- meter, that a given sample of spirit is lOg over- proof, or ^ 0. p.’ as it is technically called, it means, that 100 gallons of such spirit contain exactly as much alcohol as 110 gal. of ' proof spirit.’ In over-proof spirit, the per-centage 0. p. always represents the quantity of water which the given spirit requires to reduce it to proof. By adding this per-centage over-proof to 100, we obtain a number, which multiplied by any number of gal., and divided by 100, gives the exact number of ‘proof gallons’ which is contained in any quantity of the spirit referred to. Thus :—A puncheon of rum gauged at 91 gal., and shewn by the hydrometer to be 21g 0. p., contains— Per cent. o. p. of sample 21, \ added to 100 .... | ^^J* No. of galls, of the spirit . . 91 100) 11011 No. of gall, of proof spirit 110*11 In like manner when a spirit is said to be 1 50 Geo.

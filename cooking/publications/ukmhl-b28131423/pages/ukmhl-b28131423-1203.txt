A table-spoonful of sherry, marsala, lemon juice, or vinegar, is sometimes added; but the selection must depend on the dishes the sauce is intended for. Used either by itself, or as a basis for other sauces. Beaten up with any of the ‘bottled sauces,’ an excellent compound sauce of the added ingredient is immediately obtained. SAUER KRAUT. [Ger.] Prep. Clean white cabbages, cut them into small pieces, and stratify them in a cask along with culinary salt and a few juniper berries and caraway seeds, observing to pack them down as hard as possible, without crushing them, and to cover them with a lid pressed down with a heavy weight. The cask should be placed in a cold situation as soon as a sour smell is perceived. Used by the Germans and other northern nations of Europe like our ‘ pickled cabbage,’ but more extensively. SAU'SAGES. From the fat and lean of pork (pork sausages), or of beef (beep sau- sages), chopped small, flavoured with spice, and put into gut skins, or pressed into pots or halls (sausage meat). Crum of bread is also added. Their quality is proportionate to that of the ingredients, and to the care and cleanliness employed in preparing them. SAV'ELOYS. Pork sausages made in such a way that they keep good for a considerable time. Prep. (Mrs. Rundell.) Take of young pork, free from bone and skin, 3 lb.; salt it with 1 oz. of saltpetre, and ^ lb. of common salt, for 2 days; then chop it fine, add, 3 tea- spoonfuls of pepper, 1 doz. sage leaves, chopped fine, and 1 lb. of grated bread; mix well, fill the skins, and steam them or bake them half an hour in a slack oven. They are said to be good either hot or cold. SAV'INE. Syn. Savin ; Folia sabinjs, Sabina (Ph. L. E. & D.), L. “ The recent and dried tops of Juniperus Sabina, Linn.,” or

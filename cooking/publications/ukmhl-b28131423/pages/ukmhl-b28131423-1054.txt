1038 PASTES. I5 gr. 'See Beetl, of which this is merely a variety. Aventurine. 1.- Prom strass, 500 gr.; scales of iron, 100 gr.; protoxide of copper, 50 gr.; fuse until the protoxide of copper is reduced to the reguline form, then allow the mass to cool very slowly, so that the minute crystals of metal may be equally diffused through it. Has a rich golden iridescence. 2. As the last, hut substituting oxide of chromium for the protoxide of copper. Ap- pears brown, filled with countless gold spangles; or, when mixed with more paste, of a greenish gray, filled with green spangles. Beryl. (Douault-Wieland.) Strass, 3456 gr.; glass of antimony, 24 gr.; oxide of cobalt, 1^ gr. See Aqua Maeina. Carbuncle. See Gaenet. Chrysolite.

From strass, 7000 gr.; glass of antimony, 3500 gr.; calcined peroxide of iron, 875 gr.; binoxide of manganese, 75 gr. 2. (White.) From strass, 7200 gr.; cal- cined bones, 250 gr.; washed yellow ochre, 65 gr. Diamond. 1. From roch crystal (purest), 1600 gr.; borax, 560 gr.; carbonate of lead (pure), 3200 gr.; oxide of manganese, ^ to 1 gr.; powder each separately, mix them to- gether, fuse the mixture in a clean crucible, pour the melted mass into water, separate any reduced lead, and again powder and remelt the mass. 2. Pure silica, 150 gr.; litharge, 250 gr.; borax and nitre, of each, 50 gr.; arsenious acid, 21 gr. 3. (Douault-Wieland.)—a. 'FvovixrocJccrystal, 4056 gr.; minium, 6300 gr.; potash, 2154 gr.; borax, 276 gr.; arsenic, 12 gr. b. From rocJc crystal, 3600 gr.; ceruse of Clichy (pure cyrbonate of lead), 8508 gr.; potash, 1260 gr.; borax, 360 gr. 4. (Fontanier.) Pure silica, 8 oz.; salt of tartar, 24 oz.; mix, bake, cool, treat the fused mixture with dilute nitric acid until efferves- cence ceases, and afterwards with water as long as the ‘ washings affect litmus paper ; next dry the powder, add to it of pure carbonate of lead, 12 oz., and to every 12 oz. of the mixture add of borax, 1 oz.; triturate in a porcelain mor- tar, melt in a clean crucible, and pour the fused mass into cold water ; dry, powder, and repeat the process a second and a third time in a clean crucible, observing to separate any revived lead. To the third frit add of nitre, 5 dr., and again melt. The product is per- fectly limpid and extremely brilliant. 5. (Lan9on.) Litharge,100 pure silica, 75 gr.; white tartar or potash, 10 gr. 6. (Loysel.) Pure silica, 100 parts; red oxide of lead (minium), 150 parts; calcined potash, 30 to 35 parts; calcined borax, 10 parts; arsenious acid, 1 part. This produces a paste which has great brilliancy and tractive and dispersive powers, and also similar specific gravity to the oriental d mond. It fuses at a moderate heat, and quires the greatest brilliancy when remelti' and kept for 2 or 3 days in a fused state, order to expel the superabundant alkali, a perfect the refining. (‘ Polytech.

Crystal ‘ culleF may be added at will to the above. This glass was originally pre- pared from powdered flints, a fact to which it owes its common name. Optical glass. 1. (Crown glass.)

This is Guinand’s * dense optical glass/ b. Materials used :— 1. Purest quartz, 42g; red lead (finest), 42g; purified potash, 14| g; purified nitre, l^g. These are the proportions used for the last. 2. (Korner.) Finest quartz (reduced to powder, treated with hydrochloric acid, washed, and dried), 47^g; red lead, 38igj cream of tartar, 14^ g. The above are used by opticians in the construction of achromatic object- glasses. Plate glass.. Sp. gr., 2-488 to 2*600.— a. By analysis:— 1. (Dumas.) Silica, 75*9g; soda, I7*5gj lime, 3-8g; alumina, 2-8g. French mirror- glass. 2. (Mitscherlich.) Silica, 60g; potassa, 25g : /me,12-5g; (loss, 2*.5g?). Finest Bohemian plate. b. Materials used :— 1. Finest siliceous sand, 45g; dried carbonate of soda, 25g; lime, 5g; nitre (purified), 2g; plate-glass cullet, 23gj peroxide of manganese and cobalt azure, a very little. Ordinary Eng- lish plate. 2. Whitish quartz sand, 60g j purified car- bonate of soda (dried), 20g; lime (slaked by exposure to the air), 9g; plate-glass cullet, llg (or more). Sometimes as much cullet as sand is used; but in all cases Ig to 1^ g of its weight in carbonate of soda is added with it, besides that ordered in the formula, to compensate for loss of alkali by remelting. Used at the cele- brated plate-glass works at Saint-Gobain, France. The product possesses an amount of excellence which British manufacturers have yet failed to equal. Table glass, Bohemian cetstal.

Said to be the formula used at Neuwelt for the glass a., 1. {above'). Qual., ^c. These are denoted by its hard- ness, transparency, homogeneity, strength, and power of resisting the action of water, air, light, and the stronger acids and alkalies. The power of glass to resist the action of menstrua is readily tried by exposing it to boil- ing oil of vitriol, and hot but dilute solution of caustic potassa. Neither of these tests should cause the glass to lose its transparency or to become dim. Swallowed glass. Glass and enamel, both in fragments and in powder, have occasion- ally been swallowed, with different results. These bodies are insoluble in the fluids of the body, and, consequently, any injurious action they may exert upon the system whilst they are retained in it must entirely depend upon mechanical attrition or irritation. As treat- ment, we must administer an emetic, and assist its action by thick ^mucilaginous liquids, and afterwards have recourse to antiphlogistics, if necessary. Anal.—a. A portion of the sample for ex- amination is heated to dull redness, and then suddenly thrown, whilst still hot, into a vessel of cold water. It is next dried, and reduced to fine powder in an agate or hardened-steel mortar. b. 100 gr. of the prepared powder is tho- roughly mixed with 200 gr. of pure potassa, and the whole is exposed to heat in a silver or platinum crucible or capsule until perfect fusion takes place; when cold, the crucible and its contents are boiled in about half a pint of dis- tilled water; nitric acid is added to the re-

WINE. 1339 pretty, and may be varied by substituting oxalic acid, red or yellow prussiate of potash, or any other salt (not efflorescent), for the sul- phate of magnesia. Sulphate of copper gives a very beautiful crystallization of a blue colour. 2. Evenly cover the surface of the glass with a layer of thin gum water, and sprinkle any of the saline crystals before noticed over it whilst wet. The gum water may be tinged of any colour to vary the effect. A BLINDED APPEAEANCE, more or less resem- bling ground glass, may be given as follows:— 1. By evenly dabbing the surface with a piece of soft glazier’s putty. 2. A coating of stained rice jelly, laid on with a painter’s brush {sash tool), and after- wards dahhed with a duster brush, applied endways. 3. Tissue paper, either white or coloured, applied by means of clear gum water or some pale varnish. The pattern may be lined with a pencil, and, when the whole is somewhat dry, but not hard, the lines may be cut through, and the pattern stripped off with the flat point of a knife. 4. The surface of the glass being coated with mucilage, or any pale varnish, as before, coarsely powdered glass or quartz, reduced to a uniform state of grain by^a sieve, may be sprinkled over it; when dry, the loose portion should be removed with a soft brush. WINE. Syn. ViNDM, L.; ViN, Fr. The fermented juice of the grape. The general characters and quality of wine are principally influenced hy climate, soil, and aspect, the nature and maturity of the grape, and the method of conducting the fermentation. The sp. gr. of the ‘must’ varies from 1‘063 to 1’285, from which the proportion of saccharine matter and the ultimate alcoholic richness of the wine resulting from its fermentation may be inferred. That of Ehenish grapes seldom exceeds 1*095 to 1*100. Want of space com- pels us to confine our remarks chiefly to the properties, uses, and management of grape juice after it has passed through the stage of fermentation, or, in reality, become wine. Officinal Wine. The only wine ordered by the British Colleges is sherry (white wine ; viNiJM Xeeichm—Ph. L.; vinum albttm— Ph. E.; VINHM Hisbanicum—Ph. D.); but several other wines are employed in medicine, as tonics, stimulants, antispasmodics, and re- storatives, according to the circumstances of the case or the taste of the patient. In phar- macy, the less expensive Cape or maesala, or even eaisin wine, is usually substituted for sherry in the preparation of the medicated wines of the Pharmacopoeias.

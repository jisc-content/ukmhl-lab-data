ZIRCONIUM. 1362 jected, by spoonfuls, into a red-bot crucible, care being taken that each portion is fused before another is added; after fusion, with an increased heat, for an hour and a half, the whole is allowed to cool; the calcined mass is next powdered, and boiled in water; the insoluble portion is then dissolved in hydro- chloric acid, and the solution heated, that the silex may fall#down; after which the ziE- CONIA is precipitated with caustic alkali ,* or, the ZIECONIA may be precipitated with car- bonate of soda, and the carbonic acid expelled by heat. Prop., ^0. Zirconia has neither taste nor odour, is insoluble in water, and forms salts with the acids. It is distinguished from all the other earths, except thoeina, by being precipitated when any of its neutral salts are boiled with a saturated solution of sulphate of potassa. It is distinguished from alumina 1 and GLUCINA by its salts being precipitated ] by all the pure alkalies, and by being insoluble when they are added in excess. The pre- cipitated hydrate and carbonate are readily soluble in acids. ZIRCONIUM. The metallic, base of zir- conia. It was discovered by Berzelius, in 1824. Prep. By heating in a glass tube, with a spirit lamp, a mixture of potassium and the double fluoride of zirconium and potassium, carefully dried; the product is washed with water, and digested for some time in dilute hydrochloric acid. Prop., S^c. A black powder; it acquires a feeble metallic lustre under the burnisher, and takes fire when heated in the air. It has not Veen thoroughly examined.

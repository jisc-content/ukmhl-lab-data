A standard liquor of this strength may be most conveniently prepared by cautious dilution of a stronger solution, until a hydrostatic bead, corresponding to the sp. gr., floats indifferently in the middle of the new solution, at 60° Fahr. By keeping two hydrostatic beads in the solution—the one made barely to float, and the other barely to sink—we shall always be able to detect any change of strength or temperature which it may suffer; since the “ loss of a single hundredth part of a grain of ammonia per cent., or the difference of a single degree of heat, will cause the beads to” vary their positions. To reserve its integrity it must be kept in a well-stoppered ottle. (See below.) a These substances, as well as ‘ test-solutions’ containing them, must be perfectly free from ciu-bonic acid, and must be carefully preserved to prevent the absorption of carbonic acid from the atmosphere. Mohr states that a dilute solu- tion of either of them is best preserved in a flask or bottle well closed with a cork fitted with a small bulb tube (re- sembling a chloride of calcium tube), filled with a finely triturated mixture of sulphate of soda caustic lime, and bearing a very thin open tube in the exit aperture. Fresenius, and most other foreign chemists, prefer ‘ test- solutions’ of pure soda. With test-solutions containing caustic alkalies, exact neutralisation of an acid is not only more easily effected, but more readily perceived, par- ticularly when either solution is tinted with litmus. 3 Prepared by gradually heating the pure crystallised carbonate to redness. From being tiniform in composition, and easily procured or prepared, they are much employed; preference being usually given to the soda-salt. ^ The crystals must be free from attached water, but not the least effloresced. 5 The salt must be perfectly pure for this purpose. See process II, a. 6 The same remarks apply to this salt. All the above, excepting (3), are used ordy in solution; but (3) is used in solution, and in powder when only a rough assay is required. See Acetimetky. 7 Sometimes used in lieu of hydrate of lime in testing vinegars. 8 Often a convenient substance, vidien extreme accuracy is not required, if used in the manner noticed under Acetimetky. It is applicable to all acids of which the lime salts are soluble in water. 9 Used in testing vinegar by the Revenue system; also in Peligot’s process, hereafter described. 10 See II, a. (below.) * ^ When dry carbonate of soda or potassa is used in place of the bicarbonate of soda, when this.last is not obtainable, in II, a, the per-ccntage result must", of course, be doubled. 12, 13 Ure and Liebig, regarding tartaric acid as bibasic, double these numbers; but then the weight of base should be also doubled. The numbers in the text correspond to those given in the last edition of ‘ Fresenius.’

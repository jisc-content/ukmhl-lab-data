Sarsaparilla, 3^ lb.; distilled water, 3 gal.; boil to 12 pints, pour off the liquor, and strain whilst hot; again boil the 'sarsaparilla in water, 2 gal., to one half, and {strain; evaporate the mixed liquors to 18 a. oz.; and when cold, add of rectified spirit, 2 fi. oz. Each fi. oz. represents 2^ oz. of the root (nearly). b. (Ph.E.) Sarsaparilla,lWi.‘, boiling water, 4 pints; digest 2 hours, then bruise the root, boil it for 2 hours, filter, and express the liquid; repeat the coction with water, 2 pints, as before; evaporate the mixed liquors to the consistence of a thin syrup, and, when cold enough, add of rectified spirit, q. s. to make up 16 fi. oz.

SARSAPARiLLiE COMP., L.) There is no form for this preparation in the Phar- macopoeias, but it is nevertheless in immense demand, from its great convenience in dis- pensing. The following formulae are em- ployed by one of the wholesale houses that does largest in this preparation:— a. Guaiacum shavings (from which the small has been sifced), 30 lb., Italian juice, 24 tb., rnezereon root, 6 tb. are boiled with water, q. s., for 1 hour ; the decoction is then drawn off, and the boiling repeated with fresh water a second and a third time; the mixed decoc- tions are allowed to deposit for 6 or 8 hours, or longer, and the clear portion decanted and strained through flannel; the liquid is now reduced to the consistence of treacle, when extract of sarsapurilta, 9 lb., is added, and the evaporation conducted at a considerably lower temperature until near its completion, when the source of heat is removed, and the remain- ing evaporation conducted at the expense of that retained by the metal of the “ pan;” when nearly cold, and just before removing the extract to the ‘pots' or ‘jars,' essential oil of sassafras, 2 dr., dissolved in rectified spirit, 1 quart, is added, and quickly but completely stirred in. The product is a very showy article, if well managed, and weighs about 45 lb., the precise quantity depending on the quality of the juice employed. It is labelled ‘ Ext. SARZiE Comp.' b.

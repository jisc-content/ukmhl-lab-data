ACIDIMETRY, 35 will also be obtained. From the preceding Table, it will be seen that 44 gr, of dry car- bonic acid gas are equal to the respective quantities of the different acids mentioned therein; which fact enables us, by the simple ‘rule of three,’ to convert results obtained by the last calculation into strengths per cent. Instead of the above calculation, we may multiply the weights of the respective acids required to expel 1 gr. of carbonic acid (as ex- hibited in the following table) by the number of gr. of dry carbonic acid evolved during the above operation. The product represents the per-centage strength, when 100 gr. of the acid have been examined. When only 50, 25, 20, or 10 gr. have been tested, this product must, of course, be doubled, quadrupled, &c., as the case may be. Table II. Multipliers.

In i this case, the loss of weight in grains, from I the operation, multiplied by 10, at once indi- 1 cates the exact per-centage strength sought. I The proper weight of any acid to be taken to 1 give per-centage results, is found by simply I dividing ten times the equiv. of that acid, by t twice the equiv. of carbonic acid (44) ; or what I is the same thing 5 times the former by the I single equiv. of the latter.

A convenient modification of the ; ^receding method of acidimetry consists in using the common apparatus figured in the margin, and em- S^, ploying fused chloride of calcium to dry the evolved carbonic acid gas, instead of concentrated sulphuric acid. The mode of conduct- ing the process and obtain- ing the results is precisely the same as in that last explained, and need not therefore be repeated. In this case, however, suction must be applied to the small tube {g), instead of {d) in the preceding engraving. {a.) Wide-moutlied flask, containing tlie sample for ex- amination, hermetically stopped by the cork {e), and sup- porting the tubes {h) and (c). {b.) Bulbous tube, containing fragments of fused chlo- ride of calcium, terminating in a capillary tube (g). (c.) Bent tube, reaching nearly to the bottom of the flask {a). (d.) Small tube containing bicarbonate of soda. (e.) Cork fitting bottle (a), and the tribes (b) and (c), hermetically. (/.) Silken thread, suspending the small tube (d). Obs. These methods, though apparently com- plicated, are not difficult to perform, when once well understood. The application of heat after the completion of the operation is indispensable, as if it were neglected, from 0*3 to 0*4 of a gr. of carbonic acid would be retained in the liquid. The bicarbonate of soda must \)C,pure, and perfectly free from any neutral carbonate or sesqnicarbonate of soda. To ensure this, the bicarbonate of commerce is reduced to a uniform powder, put into a glass jar, and covered with its own weight of cold distilled or rain water, and allowed to stand for twenty-four hours, with frequent stirring. It is then placed upon a funnel, the tube of which is stopped with loose cotton, so as to allow the lye to drain off. It is next washed several times with small quantities of cold distilled or rain water, and after being dried, by pressure between some sheets of blotting- paper, without the aid of heat, is kept for use in a well-closed glass bottle. Before use, it may be tested to ascertain its purity. If pure, it neither reddens turmeric papei', nor gives a brick-red precipitate with a solution of bichloride of mercury. Pure bicarbonate of potassa may be used instead of bicarbonate of soda; but in either case it is always,proper to

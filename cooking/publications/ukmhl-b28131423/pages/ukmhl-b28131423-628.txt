Extracts under this name are prepared from ‘ American centaury ^ {Sabbatia angularis), and ‘ common centaury ’ {Eryihrwa Centaurium). Prep. 1. By evaporating tlie decoction, or the infusion made with hot water. The dose and properties resemble those of ex- tract of gentian. 2. (Alcoholic; E. c. alcoholicum, L.)

From tincture of cevadilla seeds, made with recti- fied spirit. Employed by Dr. Turnbull as a remedy in painful rheumatie and neuralgic affections, and, generally, as a substitute for VEEATEiA. Dose. Jg to ^ gr. It is extremely poisonous. Extract of Cham'omile. Syn. Exteactum ANTHEMiDis (Ph. E.), E. A. NOBiLis, L. Prep. By evaporating the decoction of the flowers to the proper consistence. Obs. This extract contains only the bitter portion of the chamomile, the aromatic vola- tile oil being dissipated during the evaporation. It is usually prepared from old flowers that have lost their smell and colour, and are thus rendered unsaleable. The extract of chamo- mile that smells slrongly of the flowers, fre- quently vended by the druggists, is prepared by adding 1 dr. of the essential oil of chamo- mile to every pound of extract, when nearly cold, and just before removing it from the evaporating pan. This addition, unlike many which are made in the laboratory, vastly in- creases the medicinal virtues of this article. The mass of extract of chamomile met with in the shops is nothing but extract of gen- tian scented with a little oil of chamomile. 1 cwt. of chamomiles yields about 48 lb. of ex- tract. Extract of chamomile is bitter, tonic, and stomachic. Dose. 10 to 20 gr., made into a pill, either alone or combined with a little rhubarb and ginger. See Pills, &c. Extract of Chenopo"dium. Syn. Exteact i OF STINKING GOOSE-FOOT; ExTEACTUM CHE- NOPODII, L. Prep. 1. From the stinking orache or goose-foot {Chenopodium olidurn), as EXTEACT OF ACONITE—Pll. L. 2. (Mr. Houlton.)

Exteact of BAEK. Three simple extracts, prepared re- spectively from YELLOW, PALE, and eed cin- chona, ai-e given in Ph. L.:—Prep. 1. (From CALISAYA or yellow BAEK; ExteACT OF CINCHONA, E. of yellow C., E. OF HEAET- LEAVED C.; ExtEACTUM CINCHONA, L.)— a. (Ph. L.) Yellow cinchona (coarsely bruised), 3 lb.; distilled water (temperate), 4 pints; macerate for 24 hours (constantly stirring), and strain through linen; what remains, again macerate in water, 1 quart, for 24 hours, and strain; evaporate the mixed liquids to a proper consistence. b. (Ph. L. 1836.) From the decoction. c. (Ph. E.) See No. 6. Obs. The aqueous extracts of cinchona bark possess little medicinal virtue, owing to the insolubility of the alkaloids {quinine, cincho- nine, &c.) in water, and also from the rapid oxidation of their extractive matter, when ex- posed in solution to the joint action of heat and atmospheric oxygen. Dose. 5 gr. to ^ dr., in mixtures, faintly acidulated with sulphuric acid. Cinchona bark yields from 24g to 30[j of aqueous extract. 2. (From pale baek :—Exteact of pale CINCHONA, E. OF PALE BAEK, E. OF LANCE- , LEAVED B.; ExTEACTUM CINCHONA PALLID.E, ' L.)—a. (Ph. L.) From Jar-t, as EXTEACT P OF CINCHONA—Ph. L. {above). b. (Ph. L. 1836.) From the decoction. Obs. This forms the EXTEACT OF BAEK of the shops. The red and yellow cinchona barks are scarcely ever used for making extracts. Their richness in quinine leads to their almost exclusive employment for the manufacture of that alkaloid, by which their value is greatly enhanced. As far as our knowledge extends, no other extract of bark, than this, is either employed or asked for. 3. (From eed baek Exteact of eed cin- chona, E. OF EED BAEK, E. OF OBLONG- LEAVED B.; Exteactum cinchon.e EumuE, L.)—a. (Ph. L.) From red baric, as exteact OF CINCHONA—Ph. L. {above). b. (Ph. L. 1836.) From the decoction. Obs. These extracts are ordered to be kept in two states, the one (soft exteact of cin- chona ; exteactum cinchonje molle) for making pills, &c.; the other (haed extract OF CINCHONA; EXTEACTUM CINCIIONiE DUKUH) for powdering. The dose, &c., of all the above are the same.

191 ANTIMONY. the processes 6, 7. a, 7. by 7. c, and 7. (above), arises chiefly from their containing a larger quantity of the true ^golden sulphuret’ or ‘ pentasulphuret ’ than those prepared accord- * ing to the directions of the British Colleges. ; [They contain more sulphur, and are, indeed, ■ jdistinct, though similar preparations. In this case the ‘colleges’ order one preparation; whilst I the ‘ trade’ substitutes another. On the Con- Itinent, the place of the oxysulphuret of anti- mony is supplied by ‘kermes mineral.’ See SULPHUEETS OF ANTIMONY (below), KeEMES Mineeal, &c. 1 Panace'a of Antimony. Syn.

The product is of a fine : golden colour. It was once highly esteemed as a remedy, and is the active ingredient in Lockyer’s Pills. Potas"sio-cit'rate of Antimony. Syn.

The double-salt which crystallises from a boiling saturated solution of teroxide of antimony and cream of tartar, as the liquid cools. Hist. The use of antimony, in combination with cream of tartar, may be traced to the puce celebrated powder invented by Dudley, jKarl of Warwick, about the beginning of the |l7th century; and by which the most Avon- llerful cures are said to have been performed [ii Italy. The publication of the particulars jn a small treatise by Dr. Cornachinus (a.d. ( il620), drew the attention of chemists to the \ lubject. Among the results was the discovery )f tartar-emetic, of which a public notice, by -j ladrian de Mynsicht, appeared a short time f fterwai'ds (a.d. 1631). For a long period ^ his preparation was used with great caution, 1 nd regarded with suspicion; but it has 4 Tadually increased in popularity and so won its Avay into the general esteem of the medical profession, that it appears likely, ere long, to supersede all the other antimonials. Prep. 1. (Ph. L. 1851.) Bisulphate of anti- mony (Ph.L.^), 9 oz.; bitartrate of potassa, 10 oz.; distilled water, 5 pints; mix,boil for half an hour, filter the solution while hot, and set it aside that crystals may form, which are to be collected, drained, and dried. By evapo- rating the mother-liquor more crystals may be obtained. 2. (Ph. E. 1841.) Oxide of antimony (Ph. E.), 3 oz.; bitartrate of potassa, oz.; water, 27 fl. oz.; mix, boil for an hour, filter, and crystallise, as before. The crystals obtained from the mother-liquor, being less pure, are to be re-dissolved and re-crystallised. 3. (Ph. D. 1850.) Oxide of antimony (Ph. D.), 5 oz.; bitartrate of potassa, in fine ijow'- der, 6 oz.; distilled water, 1 quart; make a paste with a little of the water, and, after 24 hours, add the rest of the water (boiling); boil for 15 or 20 minutes in a glass or porce- lain vessel, stirring frequently, filter the solu- tion through calico, and set aside the clear liquor; after 12 hours decant the liquor from the crystals, boil it down to -§rd, and set it aside to crystallise, as before. The crystals are to be dried on bibulous paper, without heat, and preserved in a bottle. 4. (Ph. L. 1836.) Sesquisulphuret of anti- mony (in powder), and nitrate of potash, of each 2 lb.; mix well, add of hydrochloric acid, 4 fl. oz.; spread the mixture on an iron plate, and ignite it; cool, rub the residuum to pow- der, wash it well with boiling water, and boil it for \ an hour with bitartrate of potash, 14 oz., dissolved in water, 1 gall.; strain while hot, and crystallise, as before. 5. (Ph. D. 1826.) Hitromuriatic oxide of antimony (oxychloride), 4 parts; cream of tartar, 5 parts; water, 34 parts; as before. 6. COMMEECIAL :—From disulphate of anti- mony (Ph. L.), 51 parts (or its equiv., if im- pure, or in any other form); crystallised bitartrate of potassa (in pow'der), 63 parts; water, 560 parts; as before. 7. In POWDEE:—Tartar-emetic, 1 part; boiling water, 5 parts; dissolve, add of alcohol, 10 parts (or rectified spirit, 12 parts); and collect and dry the precipitate. An impal- pable powder, invaluable for ointments, &c. The loss of ‘ tartar-emetic ’ does not exceed £- to 1^; and the ‘alcohol’ may be recovered uninsured by distillation." Prop.

The ingredients entering into th composition of all the above ointments mm be reduced to the state of impalpable po\^ der before mixing them; and the incorpc ration should be made by long trituration i a wedgwood-ware mortar, or, preferably, fc those that contain substances that are ver gritty, by levigation on a porphyry slab, wit a muUer. The most serious consequence; even blindness, have resulted from the neglec of these precautions. They should all be en. ployed in exceedingly small quantities at time, and they should be very carefully applie by means of a camel-hair pencil or a feather and, in general, not until acute inflammatio has subsided. The stronger ones, in ino^ cases, require dilution with an equal weigl to twice their weight of lard or simple oiifl ment, and should only be used of their fu strength under proper medical advice.

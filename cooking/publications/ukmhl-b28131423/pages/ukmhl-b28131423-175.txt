159 AMMONIMETRY Prop., ^c. A deliquescent saline mass, very soluble in water. It is seldom used out of the chemical laboratory. Sul'phuret or Sulphide of Ammonium. See Htdeosulphate of Ammonia. AMMONIM'ETRY. Spn. Ammoniom'etry ; Ammonime'tkia, &c., L. j Ammonimeteie, &c., Fr. In commercial chemistry, the art or operation of finding the ‘ strength^ or alkaline value of liquid ammonia, or its carbonates. The per-centage richness of solutions of am- monia, or of its carbonates, may be determined. with the greatest accuracy, by the methods of ALKALIMETRY, already described; but for all the ordinary purposes of commerce, and of the laboratory, the strength of pure solutions of of ammonia may be inferred, with sufficient correctness, from their density; and to this the term is usually restricted. The sp. gr. of the sample being found either by the hydrometer^ or ^ sp. gr. bottle* in the usual manner, its per-centage strength may be seen by inspection of one of the following Tables:— fi Table I.—Exhibiting the relations between the specieic gravity of Liquid Ammonia and the I per-centage strength, for every variation of '00125 Sp.

The specific gravity of mixtures of pure Mliquor of ammonia and pure water is precisely I!the ‘ mean ’ of the ‘ specific gravities^ of their i||constituents. (Davy; Dalton; Christison.) ■ In all solutions of ammonia, a quantity of an- - hydrous ammonia, weighing 212^ gr., displaces 5 exactly 300 gr. of water, and reduces the sp. , gr. of the liquid to the extent of *00125. (Griffin.) The strongest solution of ammonia t which it is possible to prepare at 62° Fahr., ! has the sp. gr. *87500, and contains 34*694g of ► pure ammonia, by weight, or 21,251 gr. per gallon. (Griffin.) Table I. (above), is founded on these data." 1 An hydrometer specially icetghted and gradvated for this purpose, is called an ammonim'kter, ammonioh'- ETER, or ammo"nia-me»ti:e (AMMOXIMIETRUM, AM3IO- NIOM'ETRCM, &C., L.)- 2 Mr. Griffins, in his 'System of Ammonhnetry,' calls every 212^ gr. of anhydrous ammonia a test-atom ; and every 7 water-gr. measure, a septem. Thus, a gallon of water (= 10 lb.) contains 10,000 septems. Tlie degrees of his ammonta-meter range froml tolOO, and indicate the numhcr of test-atoms of avmoma in one gal, of tlie liquid.

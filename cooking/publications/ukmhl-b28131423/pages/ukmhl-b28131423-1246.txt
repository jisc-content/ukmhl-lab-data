1230 SPIRITS (MEDICINAL). Cordial and fragrant. See Spieits (Per- fumed), Tincture, &c. Spirit of Ni'tric Ether. Syn. Spirit op NITROUS ETHER, SWEET SPIRIT OP NITRE, Nitrous ethereal spirit. Nitre drops ; Spiritus ^theris nitrici (Ph. L. & E.), Spieitus ^thereus nitrosus (Ph. D.), L, Prep. 1. (Ph. L.) Take of rectified spirit, 1 quart; nitric acid, fl. oz.; add the acid, by degrees, to the spirit; then mix them, and let 28 11. oz. distil over. An earthenware still and condensing worm should be employed, Sp. gr. *834. 2. (Ph. E.) Pure hyponitrous ether (Ph. E.), 1 part; rectified spirit, 4 parts ; (both by volume;) mix. Sp. gr. *847. 3. (Ph. D.) Nitrous or hyponitrous ether (which has been washed with half of its volume of liquor of ammonia), 4 fi. oz.; rectified spirit, 42 11. oz.; mix, and preserve the compound “ in small, strong, and accurately stopped bottles.^^ 4. (Dr. Geisler.) Alcohol of *840, 24 oz., are mixed with sulphuric acid, 4 oz., and the compound is left to stand for 8 days, when it is poured into a retort containing of dried nitre, 4^ oz.; 20 oz. of the liquid are next dis- tilled over at a gentle heat, and the product is then rectified over magnesia. Copper retorts and a tinned cooling apparatus may be em- ployed in this process without any disadvan- tage. The preparation is also pretty constant in its amount of ether. Pur., fyc. Pure spirit of nitric ether boils at about 160° Fahr., scarcely reddens litmus jiaper, and “ gives off* no bubbles of carbonic acid gas on the addition of carbonate of soda.” (Ph. L.) “ When agitated with twice its volume of concentrated solution of chloride of calcium, 12g of ether slowly separates.” (Ph. E.) Dose. ^ to 3 11. dr., as a febrifuge, a dia- phoretic, diuretic, antispasmodic, &c.; in va- rious affections. Obs. The mass of the sweet spirits of nitre of the shops is of very inferior quality, and is scarcely, if ever, made directly from spirit that has paid the duty. One, and a very large portion, is obtained from Scotland; another, from the manufacturers of fulminating mer- cury; and a third, and in fact the principal part, from certain persons in the neighbour- hood of the metropolis who employ contraband spirit for its preparation, as this article is not under the excise. Recently mythylated spirit has been employed for the purpose. Svveet spirits of nitre, sp. gr, *850, is now commonly and publicly sold, in quantity, at a price which is only about 2-3rds that of the spirit in it, if the latter had paid duty. The spirit obtained from the manufacturers of ful- minating mercury frequently contains no in- considerable quantity of hydrocyanic acid. The mere admixture of nitric or hyponitrous ether with alcohol does not afford an officinal STIR. iETHEE. NITE., as this always contains aldehyde, which, according to Prof. Liebig, is an essential constituent of the officinal con pound. Spirit of Nut'meg. Syn. Spiritus mi RISTIC^ (Ph. L. & E.), S.

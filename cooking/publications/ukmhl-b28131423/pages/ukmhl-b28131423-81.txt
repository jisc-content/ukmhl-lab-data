65 ALCOHOLOMETRY. Obs. In an instrument requiring so much care and skill in its manufacture, the purchaser should be careful to procure a perfect one. This can only he ensured by purchasing of the authorised makers (Bate, &c.). Avery slight blow, friction from continual wiping with a rough cloth, and other apparently trivial causes, tend to injure so delicate an instrument. The shape of the weights occasionally vary; some being intended to be attached to the hydro- meter at the bottom of the spindle, and others to rest on its top. The first plan is, perhaps, the best, as it tends to make the instrument fioat with greater steadiness in the liquor; but at the same time, it renders its adjustment by the maker a matter of greater difficulty. In employing this instrument in surveys, the Revenue officers are instructed to take the nearest degi*ee above the surface of the mer- cury, when it stands between any two degrees of the thermometer; and the division on the scale of the hydrometer next below the surface of the liquid, when it cuts the stem between any two lines; thereby giving in favour of the customer, or the party whose stock is sur- veyed, any advantage the difference would occasion. By means of following Table, the degrees over or under proof, of the Revenue System, may be converted into ‘ real specific gravities,’ by mere inspection; and from these the cor- responding ‘ per-centage richness ’ in alcohol of any sample may be found, either by weight or VOLUME, by reference to the Tables II and IV, hereafter given :— Table I.—Exhibiting the relations between the Indications of SgJces’s Hydrometer, or Excise Strengths, and the real Specific Geaa^ities, at 60° Fahr.

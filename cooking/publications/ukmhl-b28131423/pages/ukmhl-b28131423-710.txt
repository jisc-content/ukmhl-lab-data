694 GLASS. from air-bubbles, when it is allowed to cool until it assumes the peculiar tenacious condition proper for working. The operation of fusion is conducted in large crucibles of refractory fire-clay, which, in the case of ‘ lead-glass,’ are covered with a dome, at the top, and have an opening at the side by which the materials are introduced, and the melted glass withdrawn. The manufacture of glass is only conducted on the large scale, and the precise character and proportions of the ingredients used by the glass-maker, must necessarily greatly depend upon the nature of the raw materials furnished by his locality, or otherwise at his command. The attention of the manufacturer should be directed to the use of his materials in such proportions as will furnish, in the melting-pot, the proper quantities of the essential ingre- dients, as determined from the known compo- sition of the best commercial samples. The purity of the raw materials and the accuracy of his proportions and quantities are proved or disproved by the excellence of the product; and the cause of error (if any) may be at once determined by carefully ascertaining the quality of the ingredients employed, and the composition of the defective glass. Prep. The following formulae exhibit the composition of the leading commercial glasses, as shown by chemical analysis, together with the proportions of the raw materials used in their production. Bottle glass. Sp. gr., 2*700 to 2*735.— a. Composition by analysis:— 1. Silica, 53*55gj lime, 29*22g; mixed al- kali, 5*48g; alumina, 6*01§ j oxide of iron, 5*74g. Dark green. 2. Silica, 52§; baryta, 21*6§; soda, 26*lg; oxides of iron and manganese, *3g. Pale green; very superior. b. Raw materials used :— 1. Yellow sand, 20g; kelp, 8§j lixiviated wood-ashes, 30§; fresh wood-ashes, 8§; pale clay, 162; < culleV (broken glass), 18g. This is the common mixture for coarse bottles, in Belgium, France, and Germany. 2. To the last add of black oxide of manga- nese, to 3§. Has a rich yellowish colour; used for Rhenish-wine bottles. 3. Pale sand,^l%’, lixiviated wood-ashes, 33gj pearl-ashes (dried), 8^; common salt, 7^ §; white arsenic, ig; charcoal, s. Very pale green. 4. Siliceous sand (pale), 68^ g; potash (or its equiv.), 4g; lime, 23^ g; heavy spar, 2^g; per- oxide of manganese, g. This forms the cele- brated ‘ flask-glass’ of St. Etienne. Broad glass, Spread window glass. Sp. gr., 2*642.— a. By analysis:— Silica, 69*70g; lime, 13*3Qg; soda, 15*25g; oxide of iron (and loss), l*75g. b. Materials used :— 1. White sand, 50g; dried sulphate of soda, 22g ; charcoal (in powder), 9g; ‘ cullet/ 41g; peroxide of manganese, a little. Pale. 2. White sand, 60g; potashes (good), 24g; common salt, lOg; nitre, 5g; white arsenic, Ig j peroxide of manganese, a little (y’g to ^’2 g) J ‘ cmZ/c/,’at will (10 to 30g). Very pale. This is the ‘ spread’ or ‘ sheet window-glass’ in common use. Chemical glass. Sp. gr. 2*390 to 2*396.— a. By analysis :— 1. 72 80g ; 16*80g; fo’me (with a trace of alumina), 9*68g; magnesia, *40g; traces of oxide of manganese and iron (and loss), *32g. This is the difficultly fusible * Bohe- mian tube-glass,’ so valuable in chemical mani- pulations. 2. Silica, 69*3g; 15*8g; soda, 3g;'/me, 7*6gj alumina, l*2g; magnesia, 2gj oxide of iron, *5g j oxide of manganese (and loss), *6g. English chemical glass (without lead). More fusible than the last. b. Materials used :— 1. Quartz (hyalin, in powder), 60g; calcined purified pearlash, 30g; fresh-burnt lime (very pure), 9g; nitre (dried), | g; arsenious acid or peroxide of manganese, ^g. Said to be the pro- portions used in the production of a, 1 {above). 2. (M. Peligot.) Qviartz, 71^ g; carbonate of potassa (or its equiv., dry), 20g; quicklime, 8^g; {manganese, a little). Said to be the for- mula for the hardest and least fusible * Bohe- mian tube-glass.’ It is very intractable and infusible, except at a very high temperature j but the addition of an exceedingly small quan- tity of boracic acid, borax, or arsenious acid, causes it to flow into a glass possessing great brilliancy and hardness, and capable of being wrought at the highest heat of the ordinary furnace. Crown glass. White window-glass. Sp. gr. 2*486 to 2*488.— a. By analysis:— 1. Silica, 62*8g; potassa, 22*lg ,• lime, 12*5g; alumina (with traces of oxide of iron and manganese), 2*6g. Crown-glass of Bohemia, according to Dumas. Very beautiful. 2. Silica, 72*5g; soda, I7*75g; lime, 9*75g. English crown-glass; excellent quality, but not so white as the last. b. Materials used :— 1. Finest white siliceous sand, 64g; purified potashes (dry), 23g; lime, 12g; white arsenic, I g; oxide of manganese, i g. Said to be used in Bohemia. 2. (Schweigger.) Pure sand, 57g ,* dry sul- phate of soda, 28^ g; quicklime, 11^^; pow- dered charcoal, 3 or 4g. Corresponds to a, 2, above (nearly). 3. Pure sand, 40g; sodd ash, 24g; lime, 5g; white ‘ cullet,’ 31g. Rather superior to the last. Crystal, Crystal glass. The ‘ crystal glass’ of England is ‘flint glass’ of superior quality; that of Bohemia is noticed under Table glass. Flint glass. Crystal. Sp. gr., 3*000 to 3*620.— a. By analysis:— 1. (Berthier.) iSz7«ca, 59*19g; oxide of lead.

Extract of Liq'norice. Syn. Extractum GLYCYRRHiz^ (Ph. L. E. & D.), L. Prep. 1. (Soft e. of l. Extractum glycyrrhizje MOLLE, L.)—a. (Ph. L.) From fresh liquorice root, as extract of hops—Ph. L. b. (Ph. E.) From the fresh root, cut into slices, dried, and powdered, as extract of gentian—Ph. E. The form of the Ph. Baden is very similar. c. (Ph. D.) As ordered for simple extracts (extracta simpliciora—Ph. D.). d. (U. S. Disp.) Crude liquorice (Spanish juice), q. s., is dissolved in water, and the so- lution filtered and evaporated. To produce a good article (extractum glycyrrhizai: puri- ficatum) in this way, the solution should be allowed some hours for defecation, and should not be decanted and strained until quite cold. Obs. Soft extract of liquorice is often em- ployed as a pill-basis, and the hard extract (Spanish juice, &c.) is used as a lozenge to allay tickling cough. The principal portion of the latter is, however, consumed by the porter brewers and brewers’ druggists. The product of the last formula, evaporated until it is quite solid when cold, and made into small pipes, sticks, or rolls, forms the best refined liquo- rice or REFINED JUICE of the shops. 2. (Hard e. of l., Spanish juice, S. liquo- rice, Glycyrrhizin, Black sugar; Ex- tractum GLYCYRRHIZ^ SIMPLEX, E. G. DURUM, Succus G., S. G. SPISSATUS, L.) This is'seldom prepared by the English druggists, being prin- ? See general instructions, page 606. cipally imported in the dry state, from Spain and Italy. That from Solazzi (Solazzi juice) is the most esteemed. A great deal of the foreign extract is mixed with fecula, or the pulp of plums, hence its inferior quality. It also frequently contains copper, derived from the boilers in which it is prepared. The e.r- tract prepared from the fresh root is usually preferred to the best foreign, as the latter has a less sweet and agreeable taste. Refined JUICE is prepared by dissolving the foreign juice in water, filtering and evaporating. See Liquorice, and above. Extract of Lobelia. Syn.

I The dose of the first is 10 to 20 gr., dissolved I in wine, or any cordial water; as an astrin- j gent, after each motion in diarrhoea; the ' | second is often employed as a lozenge in the same disease, and is an inexpensive and agree- able remedy for simple relaxation of the bowels.

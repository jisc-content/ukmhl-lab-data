ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FOURTH EDITION. The early sheets of this edition, extending from p. 1 to 376 inclusive, were not merely revised, hut, for the most part, entirely rewritten by Mr. Cooley, with the introduction of much new matter, and many improvements, tending to increase the general usefulness and value of the work as a book of refer- ence. At this point the ill health of Mr. Cooley, followed by a frightful accident from which he has only recently recovered, precluded his proceeding further with this edition ; and after the sheets referred to had been printed, Mr. Brough was requested by the publishers to take charge of the work. This fact will account for certain unimportant discrepancies which may be detected by the reader on referring from articles under A and B to those coming under the other letters of the alphabet. The editor of the remaining portion of the work has endeavoured to carry out, as far as possible, the intentions of his predecessor, but he has failed to divine the aim of some of the early references. Important additions and corrections have been made in this edition in con- sequence of the progress of practical chemistry and technology during the last eight years. Many of the articles are quite new, and all have been thoroughly revised. The publication of the new British Pharmacopoeia having been delayed until the greater portion of the Cyclopaedia had passed through the press, it has been found necessary to notice its preparations and compounds in an Appendix.

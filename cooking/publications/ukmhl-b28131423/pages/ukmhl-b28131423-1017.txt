1001 OINTMENT. |,s a foolish book, which it is quite unnecessary |o look into, often fail in their attempts to produce an article of good quality. The diffi- ';ulty is immediately surmounted by employing \}ure ingredients, in the proportions ordered, find mixing them at the proper temperature. Il'he acid should be of the full strength, or, }f somewhat weaker than that directed, an i-quivalent quantity should be employed. A llight excess of acid is not injurious, rather he contrary; but a deficiency of acid, in all bases, more or less damages the quality of the product. If, on stirring the mercurial solu- tion with the melted lard and oil, the mixture 'loes not froth up, the heat should be increased li little, as, unless a violent frothing and reac~ ion take place, the ointment will not turn out )f good quality, and will rapidly harden and 'ose its colour. The most favourable tempe- rature for the union of the ingredients is from .85® to 200® Fahr., and in no case should it ‘xceed 212°; wliilst below 180° Fahr., the •cactions are feeble and imperfect. Stoneware or glass vessels must alone he smployed in the preparation of this ointment, ind the stirrers or spatulas should be either if glass or white deal. The best plan is to :eep the whole exclusively for the purpose, nd when out of iise to preserve them from lust and dirt. (See below.) Ointment of Ni'trate of Mercury (Milder). I njn.

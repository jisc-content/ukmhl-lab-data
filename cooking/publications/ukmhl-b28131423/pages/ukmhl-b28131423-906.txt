890 MEASLES—MEASURE. which are best adapted to the purposes of liealthj namely, the morning meal, the mid- day meal, and the evening meal.’^ That these are the proper periods for meals, is evident from the fact of their maintaining their place amid the changes which fashion is constantly introducing.” “ If we look at these periods in another point of view, we shall find an interval of 4 hours left between them for the act of digestion and siibsequent rest of the stomach. Digestion will claim between two and three i hours of the interval; the remaining hour is all that the stomach gets of rest, enough, per- haps, but not too much, nor to be justly iii- fi’inged.” (Eras. Wilson.) MEA'SLES. Syn. Rubeola, Moebilli, L. This very common disease is characterised by feverishness, chilliness, shivering, head-pains, swelling and infiammation of the eyes, de- fluxion of sharp tears, with painful sensibility to light, oppressive cough, difficulty of breath- ing, and sometimes vomiting or diarrhoea. These are followed about the fourth day by a crimson rash upon the skin, in irregular cres- cents or circles, and by small red points or spots, which are perceptible to the touch, and which, after 4 or 5 days, go off with desqua- mation of the cuticle. The fever, cough, &c., often continue for some time ; and unless there Imve been some considerable evacuations, either by perspiration or vomiting, they frequently return with increased violence, and occasion great distress and danger. Treat. When there are no urgent local symptoms, mild aperients, antimonial diapho- retics, and diluents, should be had recourse to ; but when the inflammatory symptoms are emergent, and the lungs are weak, especially in plethoric habits, blood may be taken. The cough may be relieved by expectorants, demul- cents, and small doses of opium ; and the diar-^ rhoea by the administration of the compound powder of chalk and opium; the looseness of the bowels, however, had better not be inter- fered with, unless it be extreme. Measles are most prevalent in the middle of winter, and though common to individuals of all ages, are most frequent amongst children. The plethoric, and those of a scrofulous habit, or one which has a syphilitic taint, suffer most from them. Like the smallpox, the measles are conta- gious, and seldom attack the same person more than once during life. See Rash. MEASURE. Syn. Mensuea, L.

Bichloride of mercury, in fine powder, 1 to 3 dr.; hot water, 1 pint; agitate together until solution is complete, before adding them to the bath, the ‘ water * of which (contained in an enamelled or wooden vessel) must be soft (rain) and pure. At the ‘ Cutan. Hosp.’ hydrochloric acid ( = -|^rd the weight of the chloride), is commonly added; and at the ‘ Fr. hospitals,’ an equal, or rather more than an equal w^eiglit, of sal-ammoniac. These additions facilitate the solution of the chloride, and retard its decomposition by any slight impurity in the water forming the bath. Uses, In syphilitic aftections, either with or without skin disease; in chronic rheumatism, swelled joints, and chronic skin diseases generally, where the use of mercury is indicated, and the remedy is rejected by the stomach ; especially in these affections in women and children (for the last, proportion- ately reduced in strength and quantity). Also used in itch, and to destroy’^ pediculi on the body .2 Met'al Bath. See Bath (in Chemistry), Fusible Metal, Ac. Mud Bath. Syn. Bal'xeum lu'teuh, B. lu'ti, L. Mud-bathing (illuta'tion) was common among the ancients. The ^ slime ’ of rivers, and the ‘ mud ’ on the sea-shore, were especially prized for this purpose. The Tartars and Egyptians still employ baths of this description in hypochondriasis, scrofula, and scurvy. At Franzenbad, in Germany, an acidulous species of black bog-earth found there, is beaten up with warm water to a semi-liquid consistence, and used as a bath. This is said to render the skin satin-like and soft; and to be useful in debility, and in para- I lytic affections of a gouty origin. In France, hot dung (duxg-bath) is occasionally used in rheumatism ; and in Poland, in syphilis. The husk of grapes and the refuse of olives, after undergoing a partial fermentation, have been successfully employed in France against acute rheumatism.'* Muriat'ic Bath^.

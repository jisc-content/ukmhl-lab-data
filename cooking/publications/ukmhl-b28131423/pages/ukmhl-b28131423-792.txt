Ink is made of various substances and colours; but at present we shall confine our attention to the ‘tanno-gallic’ compounds, to which the term, when standing alone, is almost exclu- sively applied.

When time is an object, the whole of the ingredients may be at once put into a bottle, and the latter agitated daily until the ink is made; and boiling water instead of cold water may be employed. Product. 1 quart of excellent ink, writing pale at first, but soon turning intensely black. 2.

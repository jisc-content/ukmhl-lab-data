The standard unit in the above table is the litre, or the cube of the ,'g of a metre. The French centiare contains 1 square metre,—the are, 100 do,,—the hectare, 10,000 do. The old Paris pint is equal to 1*678 English imperial pint. fit The capacity of solids and aeriform fluids is taken in cubic inches, or feet, in England. In France, the stere, or metre cuhe, equal to 35*31658 English cubic feet, is the standard unit. Table VI.

The four is mixed up with a rich fluid extract of meat, and the dough is cut into pieces and baked in the usual manner. 2. Wheaten flour (or preferably the whole meal), 3 parts; fresh lean heef or other flesh (minced and pulped), 2 parts ; thoroughly in- corporate the two by hand-kneading or ma- chinery, and bake the pieces in a moderately heated oven. Both the above are very nu- tritious; the last, more especially so. 1 oz. makes a pint of good soup. MEAT EXTRACTS. Some preparations of this nature have been already noticed under the heads Essence and Exteact ; the follow- ing are additional and highly valuable for- mulae :— Prep. 1. (Dr. Breslau.) Young ox flesh (free from fat) is minced small, and well beaten in a marble mortar, first alone, and afterwards with a little cold or lukewarm water; the whole is then submitted to the action of a press, and the solid residuum is treated in the same manner, with a little more cold water; the juice (reddish in colour) is now heated to coagulate the albumen, strained, and finally evaporated in a water bath to the consistence of an extract. As ordinary flesh contains only Ig of kreatine, while that of the heart, according to Dr. Gregory, contains from 1*37§ to 1*41§, this is the part employed by Dr. Breslau. The product possesses an agreeable odour and taste; and is easily solu- ble in water. 2. (Falkland.) Fresh lean beef (or other flesh), recently killed, is minced very fine, and digested, with agitation, in cold water, 1 pint, to which hydrochloric acid, 6 drops, and com- mon salt, 1 dr., have been added; after about an hour, the whole is thrown upon a fine hair sieve, and the liquid portion allowed to drain off* without pressure, the first portions that pass through being returned until the fluid, at first turbid, becomes quite clear and trans-

RECHAUFFES, MINCES, ETC. 67 turn the mixture into ready buttered cups ; put these into a dish of hot water, and bake for 30 minutes in a quick oven. Turn out and serve with a curry sauce. Vegetable Marrow and Mince (Hot). Cut off the ends of a good marrow, and scoop out the inside ; fill this with any nice mince ; skewer on the ends again, and bake or steam gently till the marrow is soft. Send to table with a rich sauce over and round it. Cucumber answers admirably used in the same way. Fricandelles (Hot). Chop up some cold, cooked meat very finely, adding a little ham or tongue if white meat is used ; mix with this some crumb of bread (steeped in gravy, or milk for white meat), pepper and salt, a thin strip or so of lemon peel, 1 or 2 finely minced chives, and some parsley ; pound this all with a little beef suet, and moisten it with a little stock and mushroom catsup. Let it stand for 2 hours, then shape into flat cakes, fry carefully, and serve with a good gravy. The remains of game are excellent if treated in this way.

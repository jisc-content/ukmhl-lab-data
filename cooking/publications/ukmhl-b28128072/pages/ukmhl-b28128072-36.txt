ENTREES MADE EASY 32 1 oz. of fine sifted flour, letting it cook for 4 or 5 minutes till perfectly blended, stirring all the time ; when thoroughly mixed, begin to add the stock (or milk or water according to the in- gredients of the souffle) gradually, stirring well to prevent lumps forming, and drawing it off the fire each time the liquid is added, only returning it when all the lumps have been stirred out of it. Then let it boil for 5 minutes. When this is made, mix in whatever meat, fish, etc., you intend using (off the fire), then add the yolks of the 3 eggs, beating each one well in before adding the next ; just at the last stir in the stiffly whipped whites of the eggs. A souffle can be either steamed or baked in a moderate oven ; in the former case it must be covered with a buttered paper. The souffle tin must always be well greased, and only half filled, as the mixture rises enormously in cooking ; to prevent its running over a band of white paper must be fastened tightly round the tin, standing up about 2 inches above the upper edge. If you have an oven indicator the proper heat at which to put in a souffle is 360Â°. Of course the temperature falls a little when the door is opened, but it soon rises again.

CASSEROLES, STEWS, ETC. cover with clear brown gravy or stock, and cook gently for half an hour or more. Lift them out, add a teaspoonful of Lemco to the gravy, and sauce to flavour it, and pour this over the olives. They can also be eaten cold, in which case a little brown glaze must be added to the gravy, and before this quite sets, coat each of the olives rather thickly with this, and garnish prettily with sliced beetroot or any salad to taste. Underdone beef can be used up, but in this case of course the olives are only reheated, and not cooked again. 5i

ENTREES MADE EASY 68 Cassolettes MeringuGes (Hot). Fry some croustades a delicate golden colour, and brush the tops with a little warm butter, and then dip them into minced parsley, and coralline pepper. Meanwhile, cut up the remains of any cold cooked meat or game into very small pieces, and heat these in any good, rather thick sauce, white or brown, according to the meat you use ; fill up the cases with this, and pile up on each stiffly whipped white of egg, sprinkling this with a little parsley, grated cheese, pepper and salt ; then put them into the oven just long enough to stiffen the egg, but not to colour it. Stuffed Tomatoes (Hot). Choose the tomatoes as much of a size as possible, remove the core, and a little of the inner portion. Have ready some minced chicken or rabbit, or meat of any sort, seasoned with salt and coralline pepper, and moistened with a little sauce. Place the tomatoes on a well- greased baking tin, sprinkle with fried bread- crumbs, and bake until they are cooked. Serve with brown gravy.

RECHAUFFES, HASHES, ETC. 53 to that fearful thing called, out of politeness, a “ hash,” which in one sense it certainly is. With rechauffes of all kinds carefully remove all skin, gristle, and browned parts, and most of the fat, using these trimmings and all bones and some vegetables to make the stock. Never allow your cook on any consideration to boil or stew meat again which has already been once cooked. Strictly speaking, salmis of game or duck should be made with specially cooked birds, but in practice excellent results are obtained by using up the remains of birds in the way described for hash, only using the particular Salmi Sauce to heat it in. Then again there is the fricassee of poultry, in which case the bird, or remains of a bird, is cut into neat joints, and served usually with a white sauce. Once-cooked meat can also be used for a curry, provided the sauce is made first, and is rich, and the meat is allowed to soak in it. Then again, there are various ways of serving meat which do not strictly come under the head of hashes, but which will be treated of in this chapter.

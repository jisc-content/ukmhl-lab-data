64 CHAPTER VI RECHAUFFES (con.), MINCES, RISSOLES, ETC. With minces of all kinds it is a sine qua non that the mincer must be scrupulously clean, and the knife, not only clean, but sharp enough to ensure the meat being really minced, and not simply mangled. Granted this, mince can be served in various and dainty forms, either plain or as rissoles, croquettes, etc. ; 2 or 3 different kinds of meat minced together are excellent, but remember, as with hashes, all skin, gristle, and superfluous fat must be re- moved, and care must be taken to serve it prettily. Again, with rissoles, croquettes and kromeskis, they must be fried a delicate brown, and served with a little parsley. Croustades, too, must be fried a delicate golden brown, and drained well before using.

SOUFFLES, MOUSSES, AND CREAMS 35 Quenelles (Hot). These are easier to make than souffles or creams. Pound together 4 oz. of panade, £ lb. raw pulped meat (weighed after sieving), 1 oz. fresh butter, 1 whole raw egg, and 1 tablespoon- ful of thick cream or white sauce, working these three in at the last, until it is all of the con- sistency of pate de foie gras. Season with pepper, salt, a very little lemon juice, and if liked some coralline pepper. Have ready either 1 large or several small well-buttered moulds, which may be plain or decorated according to taste, rather overfill these moulds with the mixture, and round into a dome shape with a hot wet knife. To make the mixture settle properly, strike the mould 2 or 3 times on the edge of the table whilst filling. They are generally poached as follows :—Place the moulds on a greased paper in rather a shallow pan, and pour enough boiling water round them just to cover them, draw the pan to the side of the fire, and keep the water simmering steadily for 15 to 20 minutes^ taking care the water does not boil again, as this will spoil the quenelles. If you have no quenelle moulds, shape the mixture with 2 spoons dipped

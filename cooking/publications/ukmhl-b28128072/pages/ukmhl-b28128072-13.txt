GENERAL INTRODUCTION 9 with stewed cutlets, a very favourite dish, simply garnish it with the vegetables with which it has been cooked, cutting these up into neat pieces, and just tossing them in a little butter and sugar, to glaze them. When croutons of bread are required, take care that they are all cut the same size, and fried a delicate brown, when they may be either used plain, or spread with some savoury butter, such as anchovy butter, etc. ; or the remains of the green butter in last nightâ€™s savoury may be used up in this way. Rissoles and croquettes are things which should never be very large, and should be care- fully shaped, well drained, and served with fried parsley. Mutton cutlets too should be neatly arranged in a circle round a mound of mashed potatoes, or vegetables, the bones having been scraped quite clean and cut to the same length. Fillets of beef can either be served on a wall of mashed potato or vegetables, or on croutons. Rechauffes, again, are a very important factor in entrees, especially the more homely ones, such as hashes, etc. And a rechauffe certainly does not mean that the meat is cooked again, but simply carefully reheated in the proper gravy or sauce.

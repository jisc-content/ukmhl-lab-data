ENTREES MADE EASY 34 ency of the cream sold in jars, or this latter may be used instead. The eggs are added to the meat without any previous beating, and before the sauce is added. The sauce is made in the pro- portions of 2 oz. each of butter and fine sifted flour to 2 gills of whatever liquid is used. For this, too, the mould must be well buttered, and only three-quarters filled, as the cream rises, though not to the same extent as a souffle, and must rest on, and be covered with greased paper. In cooking souffles, etc., if they are baked, great care must be taken not to open the oven door too soon, or on any account to slam it. If they are steamed, place the tin in which the souffle or mousse, etc., is, on a double folded piece of paper in a pan, and pour boiling water to three-quarters of the way up the tin, cover the souffle with a buttered paper, and then put on the lid, only taking it off once, about 10 minutes later, to see if it is slowly rising. These dishes made in the above proportions take about 30 minutes to bake or steam. They are cooked if the centre feels firm to the touch. All this class of dishes are spoiled by waiting, and should be served directly they are turned out.

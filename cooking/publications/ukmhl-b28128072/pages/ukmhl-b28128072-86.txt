Paper a souffle dish, and lay in a layer of aspic whipped to a stiff froth, then some of the meat, and so on till the dish is quite full up to the top of the paper ; leave it on ice till set, then remove the paper, and serve. Any cold meat or fish may be used up in this way, only varying the sauce to suit the meat used ; for instance, with game use Espagnole stiffened with a little gelatine.

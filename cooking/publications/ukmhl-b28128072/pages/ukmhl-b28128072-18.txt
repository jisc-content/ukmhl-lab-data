ENTREES MADE EASY 14 till wanted. If in the making the sauce curdles, beat up another egg yolk, and beat the curdled sauce to this by degrees. Mayonnaise Aspic (Cold). This is very good if the mayonnaise has to be made some time before it is actually to be used. Add 3 or 4 tablespoonsful of mayonnaise to \ pint liquid aspic. If to be used as a garnish, more aspic must be added. Aspic Jelly (Cold). For every quart of hot water allow 2Â£ oz. of best leaf gelatine, flavour this with 2 bay leaves, salt, white pepper, and lemon juice to taste ; add to it 1 teacupful of good vinegar, 1 sliced onion, 20 peppercorns, the whites and shells of 2 eggs whipped and broken up ; bring this slowly to the boil, stirring it a little at first ; then run through a jelly bag, previously well rinsed in boiling water. If it is wanted very clear, run it through the bag twice. If only wanted as a garnish, from to 2 oz. of gelatine will be ample.

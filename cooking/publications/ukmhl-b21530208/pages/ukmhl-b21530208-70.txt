This is composed of plain, unsweetened rusks, broken up and mixed with egg, onion, spices, and milk. Do not make too stiff a stuffing. Fill the cabbage with it, put back the top, tie it up in some of the large outer leaves and boil for 2 or hours.

After putting in the stuffing tie on the lid with cotton and finish boiling. The stuffing is made of broken-up rusks, finely-chopped onion, and milk.

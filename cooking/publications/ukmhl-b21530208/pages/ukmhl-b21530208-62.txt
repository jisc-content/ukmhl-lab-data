50 WHAT TO EAT AND WHY For 6 persons. 5 Mash boiled potatoes through a wire sieve and, whilst they are still hot, mix with them palmine, milk, pepper, and salt. When the whole has cooled, take with a spoon part of the mixture, shape this into small fritters, and roll in white bread crumbs, then in a batter, with or without egg, and again in bread crumbs. Fry them in palmine in a frying pan and serve with parsley sauce (No. 201). The quantity of milk depends on the quality of the potatoes, and care must be taken not to make the mixture too soft. 84.* POTATO FRITTERS. II. 14 oz. Potatoes ..... 1 f oz.

Mash and mix with chopped onions, nutmeg, and the yolks of the eggs, and mix the whole with the whites of the eggs, beaten to a snow. Shape as for ordinary fritters, and fry them in palmine in a frying pan. Serve with Butter Sauce (No. 204) and plenty of potatoes.

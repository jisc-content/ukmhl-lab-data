WI-IAT TO EAT AND WHY 102 We have used this bread extensively in the laboratory. We buy whole wheat and grind it by hand power in a large coffee-mill to a very coarse meal—so coarse that large pieces of the grain come through. The bread, therefore, requires careful mastication, which is probably conducive to the preservation of the teeth. 246. WHOLEMEAL BREAD. 2 lbs. Wholemeal Flour .... 12 oz. (12 large tablespoonfuls) Flour i oz. (2 large teaspoonfuls) Sugar i oz. (2 large teaspoonfuls) Salt § oz. Yeast ...... x quart (4 glasses) Water. d. 4 1* After mixing the yeast with sugar, pour the water and salt over it and stir in the wholemeal flour. When the whole of the liquid is absorbed, sprinkle some flour over the dough and let it rise. When it has sufficiently risen knead in enough flour to make a firm dough, shape it in two loaves or else in a long, flat tin, and put again to rise. As soon as this is done mark the loaves on the top with a knife and bake in an oven, not very hot, for x:| hours. Should the loaves be baked on a tray instead of in a tin, the dough must be stiffer. 247. WHITE BREAD. s. d. 4 lbs. Flour ..... 0 71 2 oz.

18 WHAT TO EAT AND WHY Many will deny the possibility of making a good nourishing meal out of such menus, which are carried to the most extreme limits of economy. For my part 1 say that it can be done. To my knowledge, a town dweller who does no hard manual work requires to derive from his food 2,590 calories daily. Let us divide those into 500 calories at breakfast, and 1,000 each at dinner and supper. Taking our mid-day meal from the above dishes, we have the following result :— Albumen. 1 pint of Green Kale or Cabbage Soup' . 2-0 14 oz. Potatoes . . 8-o 7 oz. Bread . . . 4-4 I4'4 Fat. Carbo- hydrate. Calories. Price. 12-5 20-5 208 id. i-8 8o-o 361 Id. go-o 445 id. I4B 190-5 1014 i Id. Thus we have 1,014 calories for about i±d., each -»-d. worth gives us 145 calories. Supposing we can have at dinner and supper the calories for the same price, we should then spend j ust 3fd. a day. Those figures are so clearly shown that we could easily add margarine to our bread, and consequently we would not require quite as much bread in order to procure our 1,000 calories. Buying 2 oz. best margarine at 6d. a lb. we have the following result :— • Albumen 1 pint Cabbage Soup 2-0 14 oz. Potatoes 8*o 5 oz. Bread . II-2 2 oz. Margarine — 2 I *2 Carbo- Fat. hydrate. Calories. Price. 12-5 20-5 208 id. 8o-o 361 1 '4 70-0 364 id. I3'9 — 129 id. 27-8 i7°’5 1062 24 d. We obtain thus over 1,000 calories for i\d., or 100 calories for \d., and 2,500 for about 6\d. I do not wish it to be understood that I recommend the general adoption of so extremely economical a diet. As I said before, I want to prove that it is possible to live on less than 6d. a day, and that one need not starve on this amount; and should no meat be consumed, either at the mid-day or evening meal, most scientific people will think that % health must suffer through lack of albumen. I have, however, made numerous experiments, which go to prove the contrary, although this greatly-discussed question has not yet been definitely settled. Let us then be careful and allow a man to enjoy for his breakfast and supper a pint of skimmed milk. Thus, over 1 oz. of albumen and 200 calories are saved on the other food ; the price of his meals would be increased by only \d. Let us imagine a man who wants to live on the old principle but who only has 2d. for his dinner. We must suppose that he will only have one" dish, and that this will chiefly consist of meat. On this he will spend 1 \d., for which he will buy 24 oz. of lean meat, which he will fry in \ oz. of margarine and eat with 34 oz. of potatoes. Thus we have :— Carbo- i\ oz. lean Meat Albumen. 7'° Fat. 7 hydrate. Calories. 35 Price. i^rf. 4 oz. Margarine 3'5 — 3- Id. 3! oz. Potatoes . 2-o — 200 90 id- q-o 4-2 20'0 J57 id.

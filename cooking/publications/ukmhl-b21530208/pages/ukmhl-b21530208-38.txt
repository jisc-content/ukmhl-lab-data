WHAT TO EAT AND WHY 26 The milk is brought to the boil, then, after having washed the rice first in cold then in boiling water, stir it into the milk and continue stirring until the mixture boils again. Let it boil for about 5 minutes before placing it in the cooking-box, where it is to remain for at least 2 hours ; then take it out, add salt and bring it again to the boil, stirring all the time. Should the mixture be too thin, boil it a little longer. Before serving, add sugar, butter, cinnamon, and pure milk or fruit juice. If no cooking-box is used, 2|- quarts of milk must be used.

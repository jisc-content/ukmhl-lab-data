Stew them, taking care to make a thick compote ; boil also some rice flour, and, when all is cold, add the yolks with sugar, and afterwards the well- beaten whites. Butter a pie dish, put the stewed apples at the bottom, and cover with the batter. Bake in a slow oven for about 1 hour and serve with castor sugar. Damsons can take the place of apples. 168.

Stewed Damsons .... d. 3 ■i 4 i* o For 6 persons. 9| Cook the flour in the palmine and thin with boiling milk. As soon as this is cooled mix with it the yolks, salt, sugar, and lastly the whites, beaten to a froth; make three omelets out of this and put them on a hot dish. Before serving,-put the three layers on the top of one another, with stewed damsons or jam between each and sprinkle with sugar. Such omelets require experience in order to get them light enough without their collapsing before being brought to table. To avoid this it is a good tiling to put the omelets into a hot oven after they are done. 169. PRUNE OMELET. II. 31 oz. (3 large tablespoonfuls) Flour. 31 oz. Margarine . ... 1 pint (2 glasses) Skimmed Milk 4 Eggs i|- oz. (i| large tablespoonfuls) Sugar J oz. Palmine ..... 12 oz. Stewed Prunes .... d. 1 o li II O For 6 persons. 9 J This recipe is easier than the preceding one, as only two omelets are required ; if possible, they should be made at the same time in two different pans, so as to be able to dish as soon as they are ready, in order 'to keep them from collapsing. If you have only one pan, keep the first omelet in the warm oven until the other is ready.

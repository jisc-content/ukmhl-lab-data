Windsor House, Kingsway, London, W.C. Helpful Health Handbooks. PROTEIN & NUTRITION An Investigation. By Dr. M. HINDHEDE, Director of the Hindhede Laboratory for Nutrition Research established by the Danish Government. NET 7/6 Postage 6d. From their own figures and experiments Dr. Hindhede claims to disprove the deductions of many of the leading dietetic authorities, and to show that the value of Protein as a food has been much overrated, and that man as well as animals can live on half the amount prescribed as necessary and accepted by scientific authority. Apart from the published results of experiments which will appeal chiefly to doctors, the book will be found of great interest and value to the lay reader, and will enable him to decide as to the diet best suited to his individual needs. HOW LUIGI CORNARO REGAINED HIS HEALTH AND LIVED 100 YEARS This fascinating book has been famous for over 350 years for its sane common sense, and is to-day as fresh and as valuable a guide to the full enjoyment of a healthy life as when it was written. The present edition, newly published, contains a biographical introduction and an address by Dr. E. Van Someren, on Luigi Cornaro’s method. The “ Discourses on the Sober Life,” as the book was originally called, are as delightful as they are full of practical dietetic wisdom, and will appeal forcibly to every health seeker and physical culturist. 1 /= net.

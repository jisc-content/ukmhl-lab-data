Rinse in several changes of cold water, and let it remain in cold water for a couple of hours before putting it on to boil in boiling salt water. Skim the broth. When the head is soft enough for the meat to come away from the bone, take it out. Remove the meat in as large pieces as possible and place it in a flat dish to cool. When cold, cut it into square pieces. Make the forcemeat of small bits of the head and mix with mashed potatoes and onions and put into boiling salt water in small balls. Make the little mock fish balls in the same way as Potato Fritters, II. (No. 84). Make the sauce like a Brown Piquant Sauce (No. 215) and put into it the calf’s head, meat balls and fish balls, to warm, but »of to boil. Serve the mock turtle with squares made of 8 oz. of flour, kneaded with water and vinegar into an elastic dough, which must not stick to the board or hands, and then covered with 8 oz. of margarine. Roll out the dough as described in Vienna Twists (No. 255), cut it into squares and bake in a very hot oven.

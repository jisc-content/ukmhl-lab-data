74 WHAT TO EAT AND WHY For 6 persons. F. EGG DISHES. Such dishes, I must confess, are expensive ; yet they are not quite so dear as one might think, for one cannot eat a very large amount of rich egg dishes. But one thing must not be forgotten, i.e., buy your eggs in spring when they are cheap, and keep them for the time when they are dear. Preserving eggs is easy. How to Preserve Eggs in Lime Water.-—Procure new-laid eggs and put them in a large zinc pail with fresh slaked lime. For this procure a cake of lime for id. or 2d. Let water drip over it until the lime dissolves ; an hour or two of dripping will turn the cake of lime into a powder. Divide this between two or three basins, according to your requirements, and pour cold water enough to make a thin mixture. Put the eggs in this. The lime will sink to the bottom, yet the bacilli will be kept off so long as the eggs remain covered by the lime water above. If you have made sure to have really new-laid eggs, they can be kept for a whole year perfectly fresh, and can be used for all purposes, save for soft boiling. I could give many more egg recipes, but in my opinion it is not good to eat too many eggs ; neither is it necessary. Everybody knows how to boil eggs. It is not expensive to enjoy an egg for supper at the time they are cheap ; but of course one must eat one egg to four slices of bread and butter, and not four eggs to one slice of bread and butter. HARD BOILED EGGS, POACHED EGGS, SCRAMBLED EGGS, ETC. are prepared as usual. Hard boiled eggs had better be chopped line and spread on bread and butter. For these dishes, as for soft boiled eggs, the quantity of bread and butter is an important consideration. 162. SOFT BOILED EGGS. 163. EGG CAKE WITH WHITE BREAD. d. 8 oz. White Bread . iioz.

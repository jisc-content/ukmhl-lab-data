11.3 DIET IN URIC ACID DISORDERS merits regarding the acidity of the urine and its solvent capacity. After the adoption of the prescribed diet, a urine which formerly had a tendency to precipitate uric acid will in a few days completely change its appear- ance and character. The red precipitate will disappear. The effect may be accelerated by partaking freely of water gruel, weak tea, etc. I should be glad if some of the sufferers from gout who may try the diet I have indicated would send me, for the sake of the cause, a note of the result in a few months’ or years’ time, at 28, Frederiksberg Allé, Copenhagen (Denmark). 1 1 W.Ji, 1

WHAT TO EAT AND WHY “ On nous apprend a vivre, quand la vie est passes. Cent escholiers ont pris la vérole avant que d'estre arrive d leur lecon d’Aristote de la temperance.” Montaigne (1580). PART I THE THEORY OF NUTRITION I. WHAT IS AND WHICH INTENTION HAS MY SYSTEM OF NUTRITION. Were I asked the aim of my teaching, I should reply in a few words :— A.

IQ the rational i-iindhede menus For this money this man has only from one-thirtl to one-fourth of the calories he requires. In other words, he will not be halt fed, and with regard to his requirement of protein he has not consumed nearly as much as in either of the previous two cases ; he gets only 29 calories for \d If he wished his meat to yield him 1,044 calories he would have to‘eat about three and a-half times more, and his meal would cost him 9d. If we add the price of the other two meals he could easily spend is. 6d. a day. He will certainly swear that he cannot live on 5.W. to 6d. a day. If he has no more to spare for food he must starve. All other dishes given in the above list cost about the same pi ice. II. CHEAP MENUS OF TWO DISHES. Sunday.—Barley Gruel with Currants (12) or Rice Soup (20), Potato Fritters, III. (85) with Mock Mayonnaise Sauce (205) or Caper Sauce (203) and Potatoes. Monday.—Green Cabbage Soup (45) with Potatoes and Bread, Butter- milk with Pancakes (114) with Compote (40,41,42) or rolled with Castor Sugar. Tuesday.—Barley Soup (15) or Sago Soup (16) Lentil Fritters (89) with steamed White Cabbage or Potatoes and Parsley Sauce, I. (201) or Potato Fritters, I. (83) and Parsley Sauce, II. (202). Wednesday.—Browned White Cabbage Soup (48) with Potato and Bread, Batter Pudding (122) or Princess Pudding (121).

Friday.—Potato soup with Onions (53), Rice Pancakes (117) or Apple Pancakes (116.) Saturday.-—Bread Soup (25), Potato Ring, I. (98) with stewed Carrots (69 and 70). The price of such fare per 1,000 calories will not be higher than the preceding one. Thus, it is easy to understand that the price of raw food being very much the same, it is immaterial whether you have only one or two dishes. The only point to be observed is that when one has two dishes, one is apt to eat more than is necessary. Particular care must be taken not to eat too much of fritters and puddings because they are most concentrated and rich in calories. THE RATIONAL HINDHEDE MENUS. III. MENUS FOR FOUR WEEKS IN WINTER.

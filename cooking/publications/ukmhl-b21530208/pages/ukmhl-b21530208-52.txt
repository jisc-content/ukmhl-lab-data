WHAT TO EAT AND WHY 40 lHor this soup the stalks of inferior cauliflower can be used. Soak the cauliflower for i hour in cold water, with salt or vinegar, in order to get rid of any insects. Then put the cauliflower to boil, and, when soft, cut the best of it into small pieces—these are kept to place on the top of the soup before serving. Strain the broth, mash the stalks, fry the flour a pale colour in the butter, and add it to the broth. Then add salt, a little sugar and pepper, and boil once more. The yolk of an egg can be stirred into the soup, and it is served with croutons (fried bread) and the pieces of the cauliflower. 50.** GREEN PEA SOUP. i lb. Green Peas ..... 5 oz.

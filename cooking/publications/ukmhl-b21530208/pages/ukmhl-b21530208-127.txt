PART IV TABLE Explanation of the Table.—This table is composed of six columns. The first three give the chemical composition of the various products : i : Albumen ; 2 : Fat; 3 : Carbohydrates. The figures are calculated for gross weight. Those for net weight—after deducting bone, sinew, potato-peel, etc.—will be higher. The figures are partly taken from American analyses, partly from my own. For alcoholic drink, the alcohol is given in the same column as fat, but, as usual, I omit to give the calories contained in spirit, as their value is very questionable. In column No. 4 the calories are given for 1 lb. of raw product. In column 5 I have given the price per lb., but such prices vary according to places and seasons. They are, however, average prices, and may serve as a basis of comparison. The last column is calculated from columns 4 and 5, and shows how many calories can be had for xd. I beg housekeepers to study these figures, for, if they will keep them in view, it will be easy for them to manage on a small amount, and this is what we aim at. 1. Barley . . . . 2. Buckwheat . 3.

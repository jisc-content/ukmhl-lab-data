DOMESTIC COOKERY. 32 e.ose. Those who use a good deal of salt meat, will find it answer well to boil up the pickle, skim it, and when cold, pour it over meat that has been sprinkled and drained. To salt Beef red, which is extremely good to eat fresh from the Pickle, or to hang to dry. Choose a piece of beef with as little bone as you can (the flank is most proper), sprinkle it and let it drain a day ; then rub it with common salt, saltpetre, and bay-salt, but only a small proportion of the saltpetre, and you may add a few grains of cochineal, all in fine powder. Rub the pickle every day into the meat for a week, then only turn it. It will be excellent in eight days. In sixteen drain it from the pickle ; and let it be smoked at the oven-mouth when heated with wood, or send it to the bake-house. A few days will smoke it. A little of the coarsest sugar may be added to the salt. It eats well boiled tender with greens oi carrots. If to be grated as Dutch, then cut a lean bit, boil it till extremely tender, and while hot put it under a press. When cold fold it in a sheet of paper, and it will keep in a dry place two or three months, ready for serving on bread and butter. The Dutch way to salt Beef. Take a lean piece of beef; rub it well with treacle or brown sugar, and let it be turned often. In three days wipe it, and salt it with common salt and salt- petre beaten fine: rub these well in, and turn it every day for a fortnight. Roll it tight in a coarse cloth, and press it under a large weight; hang it to dry in a wood-smoke, but turn it upside down every day. Boil it in pump-water, and press it: it w ill grate or cut into shivers, like Dutch beef. Beef a-la-mode. Choose a piece of thick flank of a fine heifer or ox. Cut into long slices some fat bacon, but quite free from yellow ; let each bit be near an inch thick : dip them into vinegar, and then into a seasoning ready prepared

BEEF. 31 For Venison Pasly look under the head Pastry ; as likewise an excellent imitation. BEEF. To keep Beef. The butcher should take out the kernels in the neck- pieces where the shoulder-clod is taken off, two from each round of beef, and one in the middle, which is called the popeâ€™s-eye ; the other from the flap : there is also one in the thick flank, in the middle of the fat. If these are not taken out, especially in the summer, salt will be of no use for keeping the meat sweet. There is another kernel between the rump and the edgebone. As the butchers seldom attend to this matter, the cook should take out the kernels; and then rub the salt well into such beef as is for boiling, and slightly sprinkle that which is for roasting. The flesh of cattle that are killed when not perfectly cleared of food, soon spoils. They should fast twenty- four hours in winter, and double that time in summer, before being killed.

Salt it very thoroughly just before you put it into the pot, take a coarse cloth, flour it well, put the meat in, and fold it up close. Put it into a pot of boiling water, and boil it as long as you would any other salt beef of the same size, and it will be as salt *is if done four or five days. Great attention is requisite in salting meat; and in flie country, where large quantities are cured, this is of particular importance. Beef and pork should be well sprinkled, and a few hours afterwards hung to drain, before it is rubbed with salt; which method, by cleansing the meat from the blood, serves to keep it from tasting strong. It should be turned every clay; and if wanted soon, should be rubbed as often. A salting-tub or lead may be used, and a cover to fit

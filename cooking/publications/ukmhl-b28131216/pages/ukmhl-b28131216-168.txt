DOMESTIC COOKERY. 104- in winter, carrots, turnips, celery, and onions in both Cut small, and stew with two pounds of neck of mut- ton, or a fowl, and a pound of pickled pork, in three quarts of water, till quite tender. On first boiling, skim. Half an hour before serving, add a lobster, or crab, cleared from the shells. Sea- son with salt and Cayenne. A small quantity of rice should be put in with the meat. Some people choose very small suet dumplings boiled with it. Should any fat rise, skim nicely, and put half a cup of water with little flour. Pepper-pot may be made of various things, and is understood to be a due proportion of fish, flesh, fowl, vegetables, and pulse. Turnip Soup. Take off a knuckle of veal all the meat that can be made into cutlets, &c. and set the remainder on to stew with an onion, a bunch of herbs, a blade of mace, and five pints of w7ater; cover it close; and let it do on a slow fire, four or five hours. Strain and set it by til! next day ; then take the fat and sediment from it, and simmer it with turnips cut into small dice till tender, seasoning it with salt and pepper. Before serving, rub down half a spoonful of flour with half a pint of good cream, and the size of a walnut of butter. Let a small roll simmer in the soup till wet through, and serve this with it. It should be as thick as middling cream. O/d Peas Soup. Save the water of boiled pork or beef; and if too sail, put as much fresh water to it; or use fresh water entirely with roast-beef bones, a ham or gammon-bone, or an anchovy or two. Simmer these with some good whole or split peas ; the smaller the quantity of water at first, the better. Simmer till the peas will pulp through a cullender; then set the pulp, and more of the liquor that boiled the peas, with two carrots, a turnip, a leek, and a stick of celery cut into bits, to stew till all is quite ten- der. The last requires less time; an hour will do for it.

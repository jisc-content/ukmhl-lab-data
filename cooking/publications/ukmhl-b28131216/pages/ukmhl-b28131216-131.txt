7i MUTTON. Observations on keeping and dressing Mutton. Take away the pipe that runs along the bone of the inside of a chine of mutton; and if to be kept a great time, rub the part close round the tail with salt, after first cutting out the kernel. The kernel in the fat on the thick part of the leg should be taken out by the butcher, for it taints first there. The chine and rib-bones should be wiped every day; and the bloody part of the neck be cut off, to pre- serve it. The brisket changes first in the breast; and if it is to be kept, it is best to rub it with a little salt, should the weather be hot. Every kernel should be taken out of all sorts of meat as soon as brought in ; then Avipe dry. For roasting, it should hang as long as it Avill keep, the hind-quarter especially, but not so long as to taint; for, whatever fashion may authorize, putrid juices ought not to be taken into the stomach. Mutton for boiling will not look of a good colour ii it has hung long. Great care should be taken to preserve by paper the fat of what is roasted. Leg q/ Mutton. If roasted, serve with onion or currant-jelly sauce ; if boiled, with caper-sauce and vegetables. Neck of Mutton Is particularly useful, as so many dishes may be made of it; but it is not advantageous for the family. The bones should be cut short, which the butchers will not do unless particularly desired. The best end of the neck may' be boiled, and served with turnips; or roasted, or dressed in steaks, in pies,, or harrico. The scrags may be stewed in broth ; or Avith a small quantity of Avater, some small onions, a few pepper- corns and a little rice, and served together.

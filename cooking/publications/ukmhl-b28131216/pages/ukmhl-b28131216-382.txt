DOMESTIC COOKERY. 318 To preserve Furs and Woollen from Moths. Let the former be occasionally combed while in use, and the latter be brushed and shaken. When not wanted, dry them first, let them be cool, then mix among them bitter apples from the apothecary’s, in small muslin bags, sewing them in several folds of linen, carefully turned in at the edges, and keep from damp.

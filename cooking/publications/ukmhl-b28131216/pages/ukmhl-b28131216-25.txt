(v) Perhaps there are few incidents in which the respecta- bility of a man is more immediately felt, than the style of dinner to which he accidentally may bring home a visitor. Every one is to live as he can afford, and the meal of the tradesman ought not to emulate the entertainments of the higher classes ; but, if two or three dishes are well served, with the usual sauces, the table-linen clean, the small side- board neatly laid, and all that is necessary be at hand, the expectation of the husband and friend will be gratified, be- cause no irregularity of domestic arrangement will disturb the social intercourse. The same observation holds good on a larger scale. In all situations of life, the entertainment should be no less suited to the station, than to the fortune of the entertainer an 1 to the number and rank of those invited. The manner of carving is now not only a very necessary branch of information, to enable a lady to do the honours of her table, but makes a considerable difference in the con- sumption of a family; and though in large parties she is so much assisted as to render this knowledge apparently of less consequence, yet she must at times feel the deficiency; and should not fail to acquaint herself with an attainment, the advantage of which is evident every day. Indeed, as fashions are so fleeting, it is more than proba- ble, that before the end of this century, great attention to guests may be again the mode, as it was in the commence- ment of the last. Some people haggle meat so much, as not to be able to help half-a-dozen persons decently from a large tongue, or a sirloin of beef; and the dish goes away with the appearance of having been gnawed by dogs. If the daughters of the family were to take the head of the table under the direction of their mother, they would fulfil its duties with grace, in the same easy manner as an early practice in other domestic affairs gradually fits them for their own future houses. Habit alone can make good carvers; but some principal directions are hereafter given, with a reference to the annexed plates.

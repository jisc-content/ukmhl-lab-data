157 PUDDINGS, &TC. four ounces each, two large spoonfuls of flour, a great deal of grated lemon-peel, a bit of sugar, and a little pimento in fine powder. Mix with two eggs and a lit- tle milk into five dumplings, and fry of a fine yellow brown. Made with flour instead of bread, but with half the quantity, they are excellent. Serye with sweet sauce. Suet Dumplings. Make as pudding (page 151), and drop into boiling water, or into the boiling of beef: or you may boil them in a cloth. Apple, Currant, or Damson Dumplings, or Pudding. Make as above, and line a basin writh the paste toler- ably thin ; fill with the fruit, and cover it; tie a cloth over tight, and boil till the fruit shall be done enough. Yeast, or Suffolk Dumplings. Make a very light dough with yeast, as for bread, but with milk instead of water, and put salt. Let it raise an hour before the fire. Twenty minutes before you are to serve, have ready a large stew-pan of boiling water; make the dough into balls, the size of a middling apple ; throw them in, and boil twenty minutes. If you doubt when done enough, stick a clean fork into one, and if it come out clear, it is done. The way to eat them is to tear them apart on the top with two forks, for they become heavy by their own steam. Eat immediately with meat, or sugar and butter, or salt. A Charlotte. Cut as many very thin slices of white bread as will cover the bottom and line the sides of a baking dish, but first rub it thick with butter. Put apples, in thin slices, into the dish, in layers, till full, strewing sugar between, and bits of butter. In the meantime, soak as many thin slices of bread as will cover the whole.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 14fi Puddings in Haste. Shred suet, and put with grated 'oread, a few cur- rants, the yolks of four eggs and the whites of two, some grated lemon-peel, and ginger. Mix, and make into little balls about the size and shape of an egg, with a little flour. Have ready a skillet of boiling water, and throw them in. Twenty minutes will boil then.; ’ but they will rise to the top when done. Pudding-sauce. New College Puddings. Grate the crumb of a twopenny loaf, shred suet eight ounces, and mix with eight ounces of currants, one of citron mixed fine, one of orange, a handful of sugar, half a nutmeg, three eggs beaten, yolk and white separately. Mix, and make into the size and shape of a goose-egg. Put half a pound of butter into a frying-pan; and, when melted and quite hot, stew them gently in it over a stove; turn them two or three times till of a fine light brown. Mix a glass of brandy with the batter. . Serve with pudding-sauce. Boiled Bread Pudding. Grate white bread; pour boiling milk over it, and cover close. When soaked an hour or two, beat it fine, and mix with it two or three eggs well beaten. Put it into a bason that will just hold it; tie a • floured cloth over it, and put it into boiling water. Send it up with melted butter poured over. It may be eaten with salt or sugar. Prunes, or French plums, make a fine pudding in- stead of raisons, either with suet or bread pudding.

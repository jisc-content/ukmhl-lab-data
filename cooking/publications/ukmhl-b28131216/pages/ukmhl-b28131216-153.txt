POULTRY. 89 bones, and any other poultry trimmings, into a stew- pan, and the chickens on them. Put to them a few onions, a faggot of herbs, three blades of mace, a pint of stock, and a glass or two of sherry. Cover the chickens with slices of bacon, and then white paper ; cover the whole close, and put them on a slow stove for two hours. Then take them up, strain the braise, and skim off the fat carefully : set it on to boil very quick to a glaze, and do the chickens over with it with a brush. Serve with a brown fricassee of mushrooms. Before glazing, put the chicken into an oven for a few minutes, to give a little colour. Ducks roasted. Serve with a fine gravy : and stuff one with sage and onion, a dessert-spoonful of crumbs, a bit of but- ter, and pepper and salt; let the other be unseasoned. To boil Ducks. Choose a fine fat duck; salt it two days, then boil it slowly in a cloth. Serve it with onion-sauce, but melt the butter with milk instead of water. To stew Ducks. Half-roast a duck; put it into a stew-pan with a pint of beef-gravy, a few leaves of sage and mint cut small, pepper and salt, and a small bit of onion shred as fine as possible. Simmer a quarter of an hour, and skim clean : then add near a quart of green peas. Cover close, and simmer near half an hour longer. Put in a piece of butter and a little flour, and give it one boil: then serve in one dish. To hash Ducks. Cut a cold duck into joints ; and warm it, without boiling, in gravy, and a glass of port wine. To roast Goose. After it is picked, the plugs of the feathers pulled out, and the hairs carefully singed, let it be well

GRAVIES. 113 To dress gravy that trill keep a Week. Cut lean beef thin, put it into a frying-pan without any butter, and set it on a fire covered, but take care it does not burn; let it stay till all the gravy that comes out of the meat is dried up into it again ; put as much water as will cover the meat, and let that stew away. Then put to the meat a small quantity of water, herbs, onions, spice, and a bit of lean ham ; simmer till it is rich, and keep it in a cool place. Do not take off the fat till going to be used. Clear Gravy. Slice beef thin ; broil a part of it over a very clear quick fire, just enough to give colour to the gravy, but not to dress it: put that and the raw into a very nicely tinned stew-pan, with two onions, a clove or two, whole black peppers, berries of allspice, and a bunch of sweet herbs: cover it with hot water, give it one boil, and skim it well two or three times ; then cover it, and simmer till quite strong. Cullis, or brown Gravy. Lay over the bottom of a stew-pan as much lean veal as will cover it an inch thick ; then cover the veal with thin slices of undressed gammon, two or three onions, two or three bay-leaves, some sweet herbs, two blades of mace, and three cloves. Cover the stew-pan, and set it over a slow fire; but when the juices come out, let the fire be a little quicker. When the meat is of a fine brown, nil the pan with good beef-broth, boil and skim it, then simmer an hour: and add a little water, mixed with as much flour as will make it properly think: boil it half an hour, and strain it. This will keep a week. Bechamel, or while Sauce. Cut lean veal into small slices, and the same quantity of lean bacon or ham ; put them into a stew-pan with a good piece of butter, an onion, a blade of mace, a few mushroom-buttons, a bit of thyme, and a bay-leaf; fry the whole over a very slow fire, but do not brown it; M

45 VEA IV To keep Veal. The first part that turns bad of a leg of veal, is where the udder is skewered back. The skewer should be taken out, and both that and the part under it wiped every day, by which means it will keep good three or four days in hot weather. Take care to cut out the pipe that runs along the chine of a loin of veal, as you do of beef, to hinder it from tainting. The skirt of a breast of veal is likewise to be taken oft ; and the inside of the breast wiped and scraped, and sprinkled with a little salt. Leg of Veal. Let the fillet be cut large or small as best suits the number of your company. Take out the bone, fill the space with a fine stuffing, and let it be skewered quite round; and send the lavge side uppermost. When half- roasted, not before, put a paper over the fat; and take care to allow a sufficient time, and put it a good dis- tance from the fire, as the meat is solid: serve with melted butter poured over it.—You may pot some of it. Knuckle of Veal. As few people are fond of boiled veal, it may be well to leave the knuckle small, and take off’ some cutlets or collops before it be dressed ; but as the knuckle will keep longer than the fillet, it is best not to cut off the slices till wanted. Break the bones, to make it take ]ess room ; wash it well; and put it into a sauce-pan with three onions, a blade of mace or two, and a few pepper-corns ; cover it with water, and simmer till quite ready. In the mean time some macaroni should be boiled with it if approved, or rice, or a little rice- fiour, to give it a small degree of thickness; but do not put too much. Before it is served, add half a pint of milk and cream, and let it come up either with or without the meat.

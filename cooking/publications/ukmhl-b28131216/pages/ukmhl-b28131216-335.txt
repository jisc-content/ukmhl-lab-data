WIKES, Sec. 271 it Take care of the pressed fruit, for the uses of â– which refer to the preceding receipt. Sack Mead. To every gallon of water put four pounds of honey, and boil it three quarters of an hour, taking care to ekim it. To every gallon add an ounce of hops ; then boil it half an hour, and let it stand till next day : put it into your cask, and to thirteen gallons of the liquor add a quart of brandy. Let it be lightly stopped till the fermentation is over, and then stop it very close. If you make a large cask, keep it a year in cask. Cowslip Mead. Put thirty pounds of honey into fifteen gallons of water, and boil till one gallon is wasted ; skim it, take it off the fire, and have ready a dozen and a half of lemons quartered; pour a gallon of the liquor boil- ing hot upon them ; put the remainder of the liquor into a tub, with seven pecks of cowslip-pips ; let them remain there all night, and then put the liquor and the lemons to eight spoonfuls of new yeast, and a handful of sweet-briar : stir all well together, and let it work three or four days. Strain it, and put into the cask : let it stand six months, and then bottle it for keeping. Imperial. Put two ounces of cream of tartar, and the juice and paring of two lemons, into a stone-jar ; pour on them seven quarts of boiling water, stir and cover close. When cold, sweeten with loaf-sugar, and straining it, bottle and cork it tight. This is a very pleasant liquor, and very wholesome; but from the latter con- sideration was at one time drank in such quantities, as to become injurious. Add, in bottling, half a pint of rum to the whole quantity. Ratafia. Blanch two ounces of peach and apricot kernels.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 138 Green-Goose Pie. Bone two young green geese, of a good size; but first take away every plug, and singe them nicely. Wash them clean ; and season them high with salt, pepper, mace, and allspice. Put one inside the other; and press them as close as you can, drawing the legs in- wards. Put a good deal of butter over them, and bake them either with or without crust; if the latter, a cover to the dish must fit close to keep in the steam. It will keep long. Duck Pie. Bone a full-grown young duck and a fowl; wash them, and season with pepper and salt, and a small proportion of mace and allspice, in the finest powder. Put the fowl within the duck, and in the former a calf’s tongue pickled red, boiled very tender and peeled. Press the whole close ; the skins of the legs should be drawn inwards, that the body of the fowls may be quite smooth. If approved, the space be- tween the sides of the crust may be filled with a fine forcemeat, made according to the second receipt given for making forcemeat in page 128. Bake it in a slow oven, either in a raised crust, or pie-dish with a thick crust, ornamented. The large pies in Staffordshire are made as above : but with a goose outwards, then a turkey, a duck next, then a fowl; and either tongue, small birds, or force- meat, in the middle. Giblet Pie. After very nicely cleaning goose or duck giblets, stew them with a small quantity of water, onion, black pepper, and a bunch of sweet herbs, till nearly done. Let them grow cold; and if not enough to fill the dish, lay a beef, veal, or two or three mutton steaks, at bot- tom. Put the liquor of the stew to bake with the above ; and when the pie is baked, pour into it a large tea-cupful of cream.—Sliced potatoes added to it, eat extremely well.

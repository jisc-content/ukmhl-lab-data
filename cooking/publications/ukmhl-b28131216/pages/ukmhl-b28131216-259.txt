195 SWEET DISHES. Souffle of Rice and Apple. Blanch Carolina rice, strain it, and set it to boil in milk, with lemon-peel and a bit of cinnamon. Let it boil till the rice is dry; then cool it, and raise a rim three inches high round the dish; having egged it where it is put to make it stick. Then egg the rice all over. Fill the dish half way up with a marmalade of apples ; have ready the whites of four eggs beaten to a fine froth, and put them over the marmalade ; then sift fine sugar over it, and set it in the oven, which should be warm enough to give it a beautiful colour. Snow Balls. Swell rice in milk, and strain it off, and having pared and cored apples, put the rice round them, tying each up in a cloth. Put a bit of lemon-peel, a clove, or cinnamon in each, and boil them well. Lent Potatoes Beat three or four ounces of almonds, and three or four bitter, when blanched, putting some orange-flower water to prevent oiling; add eight ounces of butter, four eggs well beaten and strained, half a glass ofrasin wine, and sugar to your taste. Beat all well till quite smooth, and grate in three Savoy biscuits. Make balls of the above with a little flour, the size of a chesnut; throw them into a stew-pan of boiling lard, and boil them of a beautiful yellow brown. Drain them on a sieve. Serve sweet sauce in a boat to eat with them. A Tansey. Beat seven eggs, yolks and whites separately ; add a pint of cream, the same of spinach-juice, and a little tansey-juice gained by pounding in a stone mortar, a quarter of a pound of Naples biscuits, sugar to taste, a glass of white wine, and some nutmeg. Set all in a sauce-pan, just to thicken, over the fire ; then put it into a d:sh, lined with paste, to turn out, and bake it. Puits dâ€™Amour. Cut a fine rich puff-paste rolled thin, with tin shapes

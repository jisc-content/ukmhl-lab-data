174 DOMESTIC COOKERY. three lemons shred fine, and the juice of one and a half, with one Savoy biscuit, some blanched almonds pounded, and three spoonfuls of brandy ; mix well : put in paste made as follows : eight ounces of flour, six ounces of butter, two thirds of which mix with the flour first, then wet it with six spoonfuls of water, and roll the remainder in. Another way.—Boil two fine large lemons, or three small ones, and after squeezing, pound them well to- gether in a mortar, with four ounces of loaf-sugar, the 3'olks of six eggs, and eight ounces of fresh butter. Fill the pattypans half full. Orange cheesecakes are done the same way, only you must boil the peel in two or three waters to take out the bitterness, or make them of orange marmalade well beaten in a mortar. Orange Cheesecakes. When you have blanched half a pound of almonds, beat them very fine, with orange-flower water, and half a pound of fine sugar beaten and sifted, a pound of butter that has been melted carefully w'ithout oil- ing, and which must be nearly cold before you use it; then beat the yolks of ten, and whites of four eggs; pound two candied oranges, and a fresh one with the bitterness boiled out, in a mortar till as tender as mar- malade, without any lumps ; and beat the whole to- gether and put into pattypans. Potaloe Cheesecakes. Boil six ounces of potatoes, and four ounces of jemon-peel; beat the latter in a marble mortar with four ounces of sugar ; then add the potatoes, beaten, and four ounces of butter melted in a little cream. When well mixed, let it stand to grow cold. Put crust in pattypans, and rather more then half fill them. Bake in a quick oven half an hour, sifting some double refined sugar on them when going to the oven.—This quantity will make a dozen.

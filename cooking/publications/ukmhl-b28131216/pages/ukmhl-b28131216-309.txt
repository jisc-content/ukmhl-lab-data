CAKES. 245 Whether black or white plum-cakes, they require less butter and eggs for having yeast, and eat equally light and rich. If the leaven be only of flour, milk, â€™water, and yeast, it becomes more tough, and is less easily divided, than if the butter be first put with those ingredients, and the dough afterwards set to rise by the fire. The heat of the oven is of great importance foi cakes, especially those that are large. If not pretty quick, the batter will not rise. Should you fear its catching, by being too quick, put some paper ever the cake to prevent its being burnt. If not long enough lighted to have a body of heat, or it is become slack, the cake will be heavy. To know when it is soaked, take a broad bladed knife that is very bright, and plunge into the very centre; draw it instantly out, and if the least stickiness adheres, put the cake imme- diately in, and shut up the oven. If the heat was sufficient to raise, but not to soak, I have with great success had fresh fuel quickly put in, and kept the cakes hot until the oven was fit to finish the soaking, and they turned out extremely well. But those who are employed ought to be particularly careful that no mistake occur from negligence when large cakes are to be baked. Iceingfor Cakes. For a large one, beat and sift eight ounces of fine sugar ; put into a mortar with four spoonfuls of rose- water, and the whites of two eggs, beaten and strain- ed ; whisk it well, and when the cake is almost cold, dip a feather in the iceing, and cover the cake well ; set it in the oven to harden, but do not let it stay to discolour. Put the cake into a dry place. To Ice a very large Cake. Beat the whites of twenty fresh eggs ; then, Dy de- grees, beat a pound of double-refined sugar sifted through a lawn sieve; mix these well in a deep earthen

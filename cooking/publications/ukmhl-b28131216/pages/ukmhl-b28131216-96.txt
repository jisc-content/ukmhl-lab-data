DOMESTIC COOKERY. 36 coarsest sugar, an ounce of cloves, a nutmeg, half an ounce of allspice, and three handfuls of common salt, all in the finest powder. The beef should hang two or three days: then rub the above well into it, and turn and rub it every day for two or three weeks. The bone must be taken out at first. When to be dressed, dip it into cold w'ater, to take off the loose spice, bind it up tight with tape, and pnt it into a pan with a tea-cupful of water at the bottom, cover the top of the meat with shred suet, and the pan with a brown crust and paper, and bake it five or six hours. When cold, take off the paste and tape. The gravy is very fine ; and a little of it adds greatly to the flavour of any hash, soup, &c. Both the gravy and the beef will keep some time. The meat should be cut with a very sharp knife, and quite smooth, to prevent waste. An excellent Mode of dressing Beef. Hang three ribs three or four days; take out the bones from the whole length, sprinkle it with salt, roll the meat tight, and roast it. Nothing can look nicer. The above done with spices, &c. and baked as hun- terâ€™s beef, is excellent. To collar Beef Choose the thin end of the flank of fine mellow beef, but not too fat; lay it in a dish with salt and saltpetre, turn and rub it every day for a week, and keep it cool. Take out every bone and gristle, remove the skin of the inside part, and cover it thick with the following sea- soning cut small: a large handful of parsley, the same of sage, some thyme, marjoram, and pennyroyal, pep- per, salt and allspice. Boll the meat up as tight as pos- sible and bind it, then boil it gently for seven or eight hours. A cloth must be put round before the tfipe. Put the beef under a good weight while hot, without un. doing it: the shape will then be oval. Part of a breast of veal rolled in with the beef, looks and eats very well.

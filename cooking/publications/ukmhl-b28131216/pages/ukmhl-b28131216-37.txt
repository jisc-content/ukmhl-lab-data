The proper articles should be at hand, and she must proportion them until the true zest be obtained, and a variety of flavour be given to the different dishes served at the same time. Those who require maigre dishes will find abundance in this little work ; and where they are not strictly so, by suet or bacon being directed in stuffings, the cook must use but- ter instead; and where meat gravies (or stock, as they are called), are ordered, those made of fish must be adopted.

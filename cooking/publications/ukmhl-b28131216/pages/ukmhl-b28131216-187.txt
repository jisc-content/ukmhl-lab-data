SAUCES. 123 onions, a faggot of herbs (namely, savoury, thyme, basil, and knotted marjoram), and a little parsley and sliced horse-radish: on these pour half a pint of the best sherry, and a pint and a half of very strong gravy. Simmer all gently for twenty minutes, then strain it through a sieve, and bottle it for use : the way of using it is, to boil some of it in the butter while melting. An excellent substitute for Caper Sauce. Boil slowly some parsley, to let it become a bad co- lour, cut, but do not chop itjine; put it to melted butter, with a tea-spoonful of salt, and a dessert-spoonful of vinegar. Boil up and serve. Oyster Sauco Save the liquor in opening the oysters ; and boil it with the beards, a bit of mace, and lemon-peel. In the mean time throw the oysters into cold water, and drain it off. Strain the liquor, and put it into a sauce- pan with them, and as much butter, mixed with a little milk, as will make sauce enough ; but first rub a little flour with it. Set them over the fire, and stir all the time: and when the butter has boiled once or twice, take them off, and keep the sauce-pan near the fire, but not on it; for if done too much, the oysters will be hard. Squeeze a little lemon-juice, and serve. If for company, a little cream is a great improve- ment. Observe, the oysters will thin the sauce, so put butter accordingly. Lobster Sauce. Pound the spawn, and two anchovies ; pour on them : two spoonfuls of gravy : strain all into some butter melted, as will be hereafter directed : then put in the | meat of the lobster, give it all one boil, and add a squeeze of lemon. Another way.â€”Leave out the anchovies and gravy ; and do it as above, either witli or without a little salt and ketchup, as you like. Many prefer the flavour of the lobster and salt only.

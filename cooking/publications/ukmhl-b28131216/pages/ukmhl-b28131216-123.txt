Choose a fine young head, clean it well and put bread and sage as for pig ; sew it up tight, and on a string or hanging jack roast it as a pig, and serve with the same sauce. To prepare Pig’s Cheek for boiling. Cut oflf the snout, and clean the head ; divide it, take out the eyes and the brains ; sprinkle the head with salt, and let it drain twenty-four hours. Salt it with common salt and saltpetre : let it lie eight or ten davs if it be dressed without stewing with peas, but less if to be dressed with peas ; and it must be washed first, and then simmered till all is tender. To collar Pig’s Head. Scour the head and ears nicely ; take off the hair and snout, and take out the eyes and the brain ; lay it into water one night; then drain, salt it extremely well with common salt and saltpetre, and let it lie five days. Boil it enough to take out the bones ; then lay it on a dresser, turning the thick end of one side of the head towards the thin end of the other to make the roll of equal size ; sprinkle it well with salt and white pepper, and roll it with the ears ; and, if you approve, put the pig’s feet round the outside when boned, or the thin parts of two cow-heels. Put it in a cloth, bind with a broad tape, and boil till quite tender ; then put a good weight up- on it, and do not take off the covering till cold. If you choose it to be more like brawn salt it longer, and let the proportion of saltpetre be greater, and put in also some pieces of lean pork ; and then cover it with cow-heel, to look like the horn. This may be kept either in or out of pickle of salt and water boiled with vinegar; and is a very conve- nient thing to have in the house.—If likely to spoil, slice and fry it, either with or without batter.

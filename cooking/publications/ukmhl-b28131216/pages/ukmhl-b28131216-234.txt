DOMESTIC COOKERY. 1 70 time ; turn as they brown. Serve them immediately, with sweet sauce. To prepare Venison for Pasty. Take the bones out, then season and beat the meat, lay it into a stone jar in large pieces, pour upon it some plain drawn-beef gravy, but not a strong one ; lay the bones on the top, then set the jar in a water- bath, that is, a saucepan of -water over the fire, simmer three or four hoursâ€”then leave it in a cold place till next day. Remove the cake of fat, lay the meat in handsome pieces on the dish; if not sufficiently sea- seasoned, add more pepper, salt, or pimento, as neces- sary. Put some of the gravy, and keep the remainder for the time of serving. If the venison be thus pre- pared, it will not require so much time to bake, or such a very thick crust as is usual, and by which the under part is seldom done through. Venison Pasty. A shoulder boned makes a good pasty, but it must be beaten and seasoned, and the want of fat supplied by that of a fine well hung loin of mutton, steeped twenty-four hours in equal parts of rape, vinegar, and port. The shoulder being sinewy, it will be of ad- vantage to rub it well with sugar for two or three days, and when to be used, wipe it perfectly clean from it, and the wine. A mistake used to prevail, that venison could not be baked too much; but, as above directed, three or four hours in a slow oven will be quite sufficient to make it tender, and the flavour will be preserved. Either in a shoulder or side, the meat must be cut in pieces, and laid with fat between, that it may be pro- portioned to each person without breaking up the pasty to find it. Lay some pepper and salt at the bottom of the dish, and some butter ; then the meat nicely packed, that it may be sufficiently done, but not lie hollow to harden at the edges.

108 DOMESTIC COOKERY. jar into which you put these, with bladder and paper, and set it in a kettle of water. Simmer till the hare is stewed to pieces ; strain off the liquor and give it one boil, with an anchovy cut into pieces ; and add a spoon- ful of soy, a little Cayenne, and salt. A few fine force- meat-balls, fried of a good brown, should be served in the tureen. Ox-Rump Soup. Two or three rumps of beef will make it stronger than a much larger quantity of meat without these; and form a very nourishing soup. Make it like gravy soup, and give it what flavour or thickening you like. Hessian Soup and Ragout. Clean the root ofa neat’s tongue very nicely, and half an ox’s head, with salt and water, and soak them after- wards in water only. Then stew them in five or six quarts of water, till quite tender. Let the soup stand to be cold ; take off the fat, which will make good past for hot meat-pies, or will do to baste. Put to the soup a pint of split peas, or a quart of whole ones, twelve car- rots, six turnips, six potatoes, six large onions, a bunch of sweet herbs, and two heads of celery. Simmer them without the meat till the vegetables are done enough to pulp with the peas through a sieve, and the soup will then be about the thickness of cream. Season it with pepper, salt, mace, allspice, a clove or two, and a little Cayenne, all in fine powder. If the peas are bad the soup may not be thick enough; then boil in it a slice of roll and put it through the cullender, or add a little rice-flour, mixing it by degrees. For the Ragout cut the nicest part of the head, the kernels, and part of the fat of the root of the tongue into small thick pieces. Rub these with some of the above seasoning as you put them into a quart ot the liquor, kept out for that purpose before the vegetables were added, flour well, and simmer them nicely till ten- der. Then put a little mushroom and walnut-ketchup.

If long hung, put the ham into water a night; and let It lie either in a hole dug in the earth, or on damp stones sprinkled with water, two or three days, to mellow; covering it with a heavy tub, to keep vermin from it. Wash well, and put it into a boiler with plenty of water; let it simmer four, five, or six hours, according to the size. When done enough, if before the time of serving, cover it with a clean cloth doubled, and keep the dish hot over boiling water. Take off the skin, and strew raspings over the ham. Garnish with carrot. Preserve the skin as whole as possible, to keep over the ham when cold, which will prevent its drying. Excellent Bacon. Divide the hog, and take the chine out: it is common to remove the spare ribs, but the bacon will be pre- served better from being rusty if they are left in. Salt the bacon six days, then drain it from the first pickle: mix as much salt as you judge proper with eight ounces of bay-salt, three ounces of salt-petre, and a pound o. coarse sugar, to each hog, but first cut off the hams. Rub the salts well in, and turn it every day for a month. Drain, and smoke it a few days ; or dry with- out, by hanging in the kitchen, not near the fire. The maimer of curing Wiltshire Bacon. Sprinkle each flitch with salt, and let the blood drain off for twenty-four hours: then mix a pound and a half of coarse sugar, the same quantity of bay-salt, not quite so much as half a pound of saltpetre, and a pound of common salt; and rub this well on the bacon, turning it every day for a month: then hang it to dry, and afterwards smoke it ten days. This quan- tity of salts is sufficient for the whole hog.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 190 Melon Mangoes. There is a particular sort for this purpose which the gardeners all know. Cut a small square piece from one side, and through that takeout the seeds, and mix with them mustard-seeds and shred garlick; stuff the melon as full as the space will allow, and replace the square small piece. Bind it up with a new pack-thread. Boil a good quantity of vinegar, to allow for wasting, wâ€™itfi pepper, salt, ginger, and pour boiling hot over the mangoes four successive days; the last, put flour of mustard, and scraped horse-radish, into thevinegar just as it boils up. Stop close. Observe that there is plenty of vinegar. All pickles are spoiled if not well covered. Mangoes should be done soon after they are gathered. Large cucumbers, called Green Turley, prepared as mangoes, are excellent, and come sooner into eating. Mark, the greater number of times boiling vinegar is poured over either sort, the sooner it will be ready. Picldccl Lemons. They should be small, and with thick rinds; rub them with a piece of flannel; then slit them half down in four quarters, but not through to the pulp: fill the slits with salt hard pressed in, set them upright in a pan for four or five days, until the salt melts, turn them thrice a day in their own liquid, until tender, make enough pickle to cover them, of rape vinegar, the brine of the lemons, Jamaica pepper, and ginger ; boil and skim it; when cold, put it to the lemons, with two ounces of mustard-seed, and two cloves of garlick to six lemons. When the lemons are used the pickle will be useful in fish or other sauces. Olives Are of three kinds, Italian, Spanish, and French, of different sizes and flavour; each sort should be firm, though some are most fleshy. Preserve them from the air.

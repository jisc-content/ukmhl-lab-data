DOMESTIC COOKERV. 256 coriander seeds, one ounce of caraways, and one ounce of beaten ginger, in as much flour as will make a soft’ paste; lay it in cakes on tin plates, and bake it in a quick oven. Keep it dry in a covered earthen vessel, and it will be good for some months. Note.—If cakes or biscuits be kept in paper, or a drawer, the taste will be disagreeable. A pan and I cover, or tureen, will preserve them long and moist.— Or, if to be crisp, laying them before the fire will. make them so. Rusks. Beat seven eggs well, and mix with half a pint of new milk, in which have been melted four ounces of butter ; add to it a quarter of a pint of yeast, and three ounces of sugar, and put them, by degrees, into as much flour as will make a very light paste, rather like batter, and let it rise before the fire half an hour; then add some more flour to make it a little stiffer, but not stiff. Work it well, and divide it into small loaves, or cakes, about five or six inches wide, and flatten them. When baked and cold, slice them the thick- ness of rusks, and put them in the oven to brown a little. Note.—The cakes, when first baked, eat deliciously buttered for tea ; or, with caraways, to eat cold. To make Yeast. Thicken two quarts of water with fine flbur, about three spoonfuls ; boil half an hour, sweeten with near half a pound of brown sugar; when near cold, put into it four spoonfuls of freA yeast in a jug, shake it well together, and let it stand one day to ferment near the fire, without being covered. There will be a thin liquor on the top, which must be poured off; shake the remainder, and cork it up for use. Take always four spoonfuls of the old to ferment the next quantity, keeping it always in succession. A half-peck loaf will require about a gill.

124 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Shrimp Sauce. If the shrimps are not picked at home, pour a little water over them to wash them : put them to butter melted thick and smooth, give them one boil, and add the juice of a lemon. Anchovy Sauce. Chop two anchovies without washing, put them to some flour and butter, and a little drop of water ; stir it over the fire till it boils once or twice. When the anchovies are good, they will be dissolved ; and the colour will be better than by the usual way. To meli Butter, which is rarely well done, though a very essential article. Mix in the proportion of a tea-spoonful of flour to .four ounces of the best butter, on a trencher. Put it into a small sauce-pan, and two or three table-spoon- fuls of hot water, boil quick a minute, shaking it all the time. Milk used instead of water, requires rather Jess butter, and looks whiter. Vingaret, for cold Fowl, or Meal. Chop mint, parsley, and shalot, and mix with salt, oil, and vinegar. Serve in a boat. Shalot Vinegar. Split six or eight shalots; put them into a quart bottle, and fill it up with vinegar, stop it, ami in 3- month it will be fit for use. Camp Vinegar. Slice a large head of garlick; and put it into a wide- mouthed bottle, with half an ounce ot Cayenne, two tea-spoonfuls of real soy, two of walnut-ketchup, tour anchovies chopped, a pint of vinegar, and enough co- chineal to give it the colour of lavender-drops, Let it stand six weeks : then strain of quite clear, and keep in small bottles sealed up.

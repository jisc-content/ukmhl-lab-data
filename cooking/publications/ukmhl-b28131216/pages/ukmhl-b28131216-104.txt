DOMESTIC COOIOiRY. 44 quarts of water and cover the pan close with brown paper, or a dish that will fit close. Let it stand eight or ten hours in a slow oven ; or simmer it by the side of the fire, or on a hot hearth. When done tender, put the meat into a clean pan, and let it get cold. Take the cake of fat off, and warm the head in pieces in the soup. Put what vegetables you choose. Marrow-boves. Cover the top with floured cloth; boil them and serve with dry toast. Tripe May be served in a tureen, stewed with milk and onion till tender. Melted butter for sauce. Or fry it in small bits dipped in butter. Or stew the thin part, cut into bits, in gravy; thicken with flour and butter, and add a little ketchup. Or fricassee it with white sauce. Soused Tripe. Boil the tripe, but not quite tender ; then put it into salt and water, which must be changed every day till it is all used. When you dress the tripe, dip it into a batter of flour and eggs, and fry it of a good brown. Ox-feet or Cow-heels, May be dressed in various ways, and are very nutri- tious in all. Boil them ; and serve in a napkin, with melted but- ter, mustard, and a large spoonful of vinegar. Or boil them very tender, and serve them as a brown fricassee ; the liquor will do to make jelly sweet or re- lishing, and likewise give richness to soups or gravies. Or cut them into four parts, dip them into an egg, and then flour and fry them ; and fry onions (if you like them) to serve round. Sauce as above. Or bake them as for mock-turtle. Bubble and Squecuc. Boil, chop, and fry with a little butter, pepper and salt, some cabbage, and lay on it slices of underdone beef, lightly fried.

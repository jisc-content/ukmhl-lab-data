DOMESTIC COOKERY. 29 2 should be kept very clean, and the bottom of the dove- cote be strewed with sand, once a month at least. Tares, beans and peas, are their proper food. They should have plenty of fresh water in their house. Starlings and other birds are apt to come among them, >nd suck the eggs. Vermin likewise are their great .-nemies, and destroy them. If the breed should be too small, put a few tame pigeons of the common kind, and of their own colour, among them. Observe not to have too large a proportion of cock-birds; for they are quarrelsome, and will soon thin the dove- cote. Pigeons are fond of salt, and it keeps them healthy. Lay a large heap of clay near the house; and let the salt-brine that may be done with in the family be poured upon it. Bay-salt and cummin-seeds mixed, is an universal remedy for the diseases of pigeons. The backs and breasts are sometimes scabby; in which case, take a quarter of a pound of bay-salt, and as much common salt; a pound of fennel-seed, a pound of dill-seed, as much cummin-seed, and an ounce of assafcetida; mix all with a little wheaten flour, and some fine worked clay; when all are well beaten together, put it into two earthen pots, and bake them in the oven. When cold, put them on the table in the dove-cote; the pigeor.s will eat it, and thus be cured. Rabbits. The wild ones have the finest flavour, unless great care is taken to keep the tame delicately clean. The tame one brings forth every month, and must be al- lowed to go with the buck as soon as she has kindled. The sweetest hay, oats, beans, sow-thistle, parsley, carrot-tops, cabbage-leaves, and bran, fresh and fresh, should be given to them. If not very well attended, their stench will destroy themselves, and be very un- wholesome to all who live near them; but attention will prevent this inconvenience.

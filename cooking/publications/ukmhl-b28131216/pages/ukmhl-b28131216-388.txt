The sides of stairs or passages on which are carpets, or floor cloth, should be washed with sponge instead of linen or flannel, and the edges will not be soiled.

Make a strong lye of pearl-ashes and soft water ; and add as much unslacked lime as it. will take up ; stir it together, and let it settle a few minutes; bottle it, and stop close; have ready some water to lower it as used, and scour the part with it.

Boil a pound of pipe-makersâ€™ clay, with a quart or water, a quart of small beer, and put in a bit of stone- blue. Wash with tnis mixture and, when dry, rub the stones with flannel and a brush.

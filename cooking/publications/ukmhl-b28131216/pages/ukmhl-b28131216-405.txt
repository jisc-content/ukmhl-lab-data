GENERAL REMARKS ON DINNERS. 341 they add to the appearance of the table the first time; three sweet things may form the second appearance without greater expense. The Bills of Fare which have been given from page 327 to 339, may be modified at discretion. In some houses, one dish at a time is sent up with the vegetables or sauces proper to it, and this in suc- cession hot and hot. In others, a course of Soups and Fish ; then Meats and boiled Fowls, Turkey, &c. Made Dishes and Game follow; and, lastly, Sweet Dishes ; but these are not the common modes. It is worthy observation here, that common cooks do not think of sending up such articles as are in the house, unless ordered; though by so doing, the addi- tion of a collared or pickled thing, some Fritters, fried Patties, or quick-made Dumplings, would be useful when there happened to be accidental visitors : and at all times it is right to better the appearance of the table rather than let things spoil below, by which the expense of a family is more increased than can be easily imagined. Vegetables are put on the side-table at large dinners, as likewise sauces, and servants bring them round : but some inconveniences attend this plan ; and when there are not many to wait, delay is occasioned ; besides that, by awkwardness, the clothes of the company may be spoiled. If the table is of a due size, the articles alluded to will not fill it too much. SUPPERS. Hot suppers are not much in use where people dine very late. When required, the top and bottom, or either, may be Game. Fowls. Rabbit. Boiled Fish, such as Soles, Mackerel. Oysters stewed or scalloped. French Beans. Cauliflower, or Jeru- salem Artichokes, in white Sauce. Broccoli with Eggs. Stewed Spinach and ditto. Sweetbreads. Small Birds. Mushrooms. Potatoes. Scallop, &c. Cutlets. Roast Onions. Salmagundy. Buttered Eggs.

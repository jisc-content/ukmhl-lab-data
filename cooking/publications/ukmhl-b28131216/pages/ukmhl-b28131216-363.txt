Another.—Boil up half a pint of fine gruel, with a bit of butter the size of a large nutmeg, a large spoon- ful of brandy, the same of white wine, one of capil- laire, a bit of lemon-peel and nutmeg. Another.—Into a pint of fine gruel, not thick, put, when it is boiling hot, the yolk of an egg beaten with sugar, and mixed with a large spoonful of cold water, a glass of wine, and nutmeg.

209 WINES, &C White Elder Wine, very much like Frontinac. Boil eighteen pounds of white powder sugar, with six gallons of water, and two whites of eggs well beaten ; then skim it, and put in a quarter ot a peck of elder-flowers from the tree that bears white ber- ries ; do not keep them on the fire. When near cold, stir it, and put in six spoonfuls of lemon-juice, four or five of yeast, and beat well into the liquor ; stir it every day : put six pounds of the best raisins, stoned, into the cask, and tun the wine. Stop it close, and bottle in six months. When well kept, this wine will pass for Frontinac. Clary Wine. Boil fifteen gallons of water, with forty-five pounds of sugar, skim it; when cold put a little to a quarter of a pint of yeast, and so by degrees add a little more. In an hour, pour the small quantity to the large, pour the liquor on clary-flowers, picked in the dry ; the quantity for the above is twelve quarts. Those who gather from their own garden may not have sufficient to put in at once, and may add as they can get them, keeping account of each quart. When it ceases to hiss, and the flowers are all in, stop it up for four months. Rack it off, empty the barrel of the dregs, and, adding a gallon of the best brandy, stop it up, and let it stand six or eight weeks, then bottle it. Excellent Raisin Wine. To every gallon of spring water, put eight pounds of fresh Smyrnas in a large tub ; stir it thoroughly every day for a month ; then press the raisins in a horse-hair bag as dry as possible ; put the liquor into a cask â€¢ and, when it has done hissing, pour in a bot- tle of the best brandy : stop it close for twelve months ; then rack it off, but without the dregs ; filter them through a bag of flannel of three or four folds : add the clear to the quantity, and pour one or two quarts o: brandy, according to the size of the vessel.

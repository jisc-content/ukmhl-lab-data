DOMESTIC COOKERY 262 PART X. HOMS BSEWERY, WINES, ETC, To brew very fine Welch Ale. Pour forty-two gallons of water hot, but not quite boiling, on eight bushels of malt, cover and let it stand three hours. In the mean time infuse four pounds of hops in a little hot water, and put the water and hops into the tub, and run the wort upon them, and boil them together three hours. Strain off the hops, and keep for the small beer. Let the wort stand in a high tub till cool enough to receive the yeast, of which put two quarts of ale, or if you cannot get it, of small- beer yeast. Mix it thoroughly and often. When the wort has done working the second or third day, the yeast will sink rather than rise in the middle, remove it then, and tun the ale as it works out; pour a quart in at a time, and gently, to prevent the fermentation from continuing too long, which weakens the liquor. Put a bit of paper over the bung-hole two or three days before stopping up. Strong Beer or Ale. Twelve bushels of malt to the hogshead for beer, (or fourteen if you wish it of a very good body)^ eifht for ale; for either pour the whole quantity of water hot, but not boiling, on at once, and let it in- fuse three hours close covered ; mash it in the first half hour and let it stand the remainder of the time. Run it on the hops previously infused in water ; for strong beer three quarters of a pound to a bushel ; if for ale, half a pound. Boil them with the wort two hours from the time it begins to boil. Cool a pailful â€” add two quarts of yeast to, which will prepare it for putting to the rest when ready next day; but if possible put together the same night. Tun as usual

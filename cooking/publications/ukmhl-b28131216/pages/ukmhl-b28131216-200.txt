136 DOMESTIC COOKERY. • The cold pie will keep many days. Slices make a pretty side-dish. Instead of isinglass, use a calf’s foot, or a cow-heel, if the jelly is not likely to be stiff enough. The pickled tongues of former calves’-heads may be put in, to vary the colour, instead of, or besides ham. Excellent Porlc Pies, to eat cold. Raise common boiled crust into either a round or oval form, as you choose ; have ready the trimming and small bits of pork cut oft' when a hog is killed; and if these are not enough, take the meat off a sweet bone. Beat it well with a rolling-pin; season with pepper and salt, and keep the fat and lean sepa- rate. Put in layers quite close up to the top : lay on the lid : cut the edge smooth round, and pinch it; bake in a slow soaking oven, as the meat is very solid. Directions for raising the crust will be given here- after. The pork may be put into a common dish, with a very plain crust; and be quite as good. Ob- serve to put no bone or water into pork pie ; the out- side of the pieces will be hard, unless they are cut small and pressed close. Mutton Pie. Cut steaks from a loin or neck of mutton that has hung; beat them, and remove some of the fat. Season with salt, pepper, and a little onion; put a little w’ater t the bottom of the dish, and a little paste at the edge; fien cover with a moderately thick paste. Or raise small pies, and breaking each bone in two to shorten it, season, and cover it over, pinching the edge. When they come out, pour into each a spoonful of gravy made of a bit of mutton. Squab Pie. Cut apples as for other pies, and lay them in rows with mutton chops : shred onion, and sprinkle it among them and also some sugar.

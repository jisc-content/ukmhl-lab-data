FISH. *> o <rood, but in ponds they have usually a scrong rank flavour. Except the middle of summer, they are always in season. Lobsters.—If they have not been long taken, the claw's will have a strong motion when you put your fin- ger on the eyes and press them. The heaviest are the best, and it is perferable to boil them at home. When you buy them ready boiled, try whether their tails art stiff, and pull up with a spring ; otherwise that part will be flabby. The cock lobster is known by the narrow back part of his tail, and the two uppermost fins within it are stiff' and hard ; but those of the hen are soft, and the tail broader. The male, though generally smaller has the highest flavour, the flesh is firmer, and the co- lour when boiled is a deeper red. Crabs.—The heaviest are best, and those of a mid- dling size are sweetest. If light they are watery : when in perfection the joints of the legs are stiff and the body has a very agreeable smell. The eyes look dead and loose when stale. Prawns and Shrimps.—When fresh they have a sweet flavour, are firm and stiff, and the colour is bright.—Shrimps are of the prawn kind, and may be judged by the same rules. Oysters.—There are several kinds ; the Pyfleet, Col- chester, and Milford, are much the best. The native Milton are fine, being white and fat; but others may be made to possess both these qualities in some degree by proper feeding. When alive and strong the shell closes on the knife. They should be eaten as soon as opened, the flavour becoming poor otherwise. The rock oyster is largest, but usually has a coarse flavour if eaten raw. Flounders.—They should be thick, firm, and have their eyes bright. They very soon become flabby and bad. They are both sea and river fish. The Thames produces the best. They are in season from January' to March, and from July to September. Sprats.—Choose by the same rules as Herrings,

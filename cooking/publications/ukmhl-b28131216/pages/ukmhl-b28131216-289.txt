225 SWEETMEATS. Orange Chips. Cut oranges in halves, squeeze the juice throughja Bieve; soak the peel in water; next day boil it in the same till tender, drain them, and slice the peels, put them to the juice, weigh as much sugar, and put alto- gether into a broad earthen dish, and place over the fire at a moderate distance, often stirring till the chips candy; then set them in a cool room to dry. They will not be so under three weeks. Orange Biscuits, or little Cakes. Boil whole Seville oranges in two or three waters, till most of the bitterness is gone; cut them, and take out the pulp and juice ; then beat the outside very fine in a mortar, and put to it an equal weight of double-refined sugar beaten and sifted. When ex- tremely well mixed to a paste, spread it thin on china dishes, and set them in the sun, or before the fire; when half dry, cut it into what form you please, turn the other side up, and dry that. Keep them in a box, with layers of paper. They are for desserts; and are also useful as a sto- machic, to carry in the pocket on journeys, or for gen- tlemen when shooting, and for gouty stomachs.

PASTRY. 17-3 Almond Cheesecakes. Blanch and pound four ounces of Sweet aunond.-;, and a few bitter, with a spoonful of water; then add four ounces of sugar pounded, a spoonful ot cream, and the whites of two eggs well beaten; mix all as quick as possible ; put into very small pattypans, and bake in a pretty warm oven under twenty minutes. Another way.—Blanch and pound four ounces of al- monds, with a little orange-flower, or rose-water; then stir in the yolks of six and whites of three eggs, well beaten, five ounces of butter warmed, the peel of a lemon grated, and a little of the juice; sweeten with fine Lisbon sugar. When well mixed, bake in a deli- cate paste, in small pans. Another way.—Press the whey from as much curd as will make two dozen small ones ; then put it on the back of a sieve, and with half an ounce of butter rub it through with the back of a spoon ; put to it six yolks, and three whites of eggs, and a few bitter al- monds pounded with as n\uch sugar as will make the curd properly sweet : mix with it the rind of a lemon grated, and a glass of brandy. Put a puff-paste into the pans, and ten minutes will bake them. Dough Nuts. Rub a quarter of a pound of butter into a pound of flour, then add six ounces of sugar, three eggs, about a dessert spoonful of yeast, and sufficient milk to make it into a stiff paste. Let it stand to rise, then roil it out, and cut it into shapes, with a paste cutter, and bod them in lard, till they are of a nice brown colour. A Tippling Cake. 1 ut a sponge cake into a deep china or glass dish, pom round it some white wine (raisin is very suitable), and a wine glass of brandy. Let the cakes soak up the wine, and then strew sifted sugar over it, and pour in the dish a rich thick custard, according to t our fancy.

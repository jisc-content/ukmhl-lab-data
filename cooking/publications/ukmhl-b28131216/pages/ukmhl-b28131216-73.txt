FISH. 19 Broiled Herrings. Flour them first, and do of a good colour; plain butter for sauce. Polled Herrings Are very good done like Mackerel, see page 13. To dress Bed Herrings. Chose those that are large and moist, cut them open, and pour some boiling small beer over them to soak half an hour; drain them dry, and make them just hot through before the fire, then rub some cold butter over them and serve. Egg sauce, or buttered eggs and mashed potatoes should be sent up with them. Baked Herrings and Sprats. Wash and drain without wiping them ; season with allspice in fine powder, salt, and a few whole cloves; lay them in a pan with plenty of black pepper, an onion, and a few bay-leaves. Add half vinegar and half small beer, enough to cover them. Put paper over the pan, and bake in a slow oven. If you like, throw saltpetre over them the night before, to make them look red. Gut, but do not open them. Sprats When cleaned, should be fastened in rows by a skewer run through the heads, and then broiled and served hot and hot. LOBSTERS AND SHRIMPS. To Pol Lobsters. Half boil them, pick out the meat, cut it into small bits, season with mace, white pepper, nutmeg and salt, press close into a pot and cover with butter, bake half an hour ; put the spawn in. When cold, take the lob, ster out, and put it into the pots with a little of the but- ter. Beat the other butter in a mortar with some of the 'spawn : then mix that coloured butter with as much as will be sufficient to cover the pots and strain it. Cay- enne may be added, if approved.

To keep meat hot. — It is best to take it up when -.lone, though the company may not be come ; set the dish over a pan of boiling water, put a deep cover over it so as not to touch the meat, and then throw a cloth over that. This way will not dry up the gravy VENISON. To keep Venison. Keep the venison dry, wash it with milk and v ater very clean, and dry it with clean cloths till not the least damp remains; then dust pounded ginger over every part, which is a very good preventive against the fly. By thus managing and watching, it will hang a fort- night. When to be used, wash it with a little lukewarm water, and dry it. Pepper is likewise good to keep it. To dress Venison. A haunch of buck will take three hours and a half or three quarters roasting; doe, only three hours and a quar- ter. Venison should be rather under than over done. Spread a sheet of white paper with butter and put it over the fat, first sprinkling it with a little salt; then lay a coarse paste on strong paper and cover the haunch, tie it with fine packthread, and set it at a distance from the fire, which must be a good one. Baste it often ; ten minutes before serving take off the paste, draw the meat nearer the fire, and baste it with butter and a good deal of flour to make it froth up well. Gravy for it should be put into a boat, and not into the dish (unless the venison has none), and made thus:— Cut off the fat from two or three pounds of a loin of old mutton, and set it in steaks on a gridiron for a few mi- nutes, just to brown one side; put them into a sauce-pan with a quart of water, cover close for an hour and, sim- mer it gently; then uncover it, and stew till the gravy is reduced to a pint. Season with only salt. Currant-jelly sauce must be served in a boat.

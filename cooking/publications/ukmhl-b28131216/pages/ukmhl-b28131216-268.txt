Put at the top small strips of orange-paring cut thin, or preserved chips. Raspberry Cream. Mash the fruit gently, and let them drain: then sprinkle a little sugar over, and that will produce more juice ; then put the juice to some cream, and sweeten it; after which, if you choose to lower it with some milk, it will not curdle; which it would, if put to the milk before the cream; but it is best made of rasp- berry-jelly, instead of jam, when the fresh fruit can- not be obtained. Another way.â€”Boil one ounce of isinglass-shavings in three pints of cream and new milk mixed, for fifteen minutes, or until the former be melted, and strain it through a hair-sieve into a basin ; when cool put about half a pint of raspberry-juice, or syrup, to the milk ana cream : stir it till well incorporated ; sweeten and add a glass of brandy; whisk it about till three parts cold; then put it into a mould till quite cold. In summer use the fresh juice ; in winter, syrup of raspberries. Spinach Cream. Beat the yolks of eight eggs with a wooden spoon or a whisk; sweeten them a good deal; and put to them a stick of cinnamon, a pint of rich cream, three quarters of a pint of new milk ; stir it well; then add a quarter of a pint of spinach-juice ; set it over a gentle stove, and stir it one way constantly till it is as thick as a hasty pudding. Put into a custard dish some Naples biscuits, or preserved orange, in long slices, and pour the mixture over them. It is to be eaten cold ; and is a dish either for supper, or for a second course.

172 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Cheap and Excellent Custards. Boil three pints of new milk, with a bit of lemon- peel, a bit of cinnamon, two or three bay-leaves, and sweeten it. Meanwhile rub down smooth a large spoonful of rice-flour into a cup of cold milk, and mix with it two yolks of eggs well beaten. Take a basin of the boiling milk, and mix with the cold, and then pour that to the boiling; stirring it one way till it begins to thicken, and is just going to boil up â€¢ then pour it into a pan, and stir it some time ; add a large spoonful of peach-water, two tea-spoonfuls of brandy, or a little ratafia. Marbles boiled in custard or any thing likely to burn, will, by shaking them in the sauce-pan, prevent it from catching. Rich Custards. Boil a pint of milk with lemon-peel and cinnamon ; mix a pint of cream, and the yolks of five eggs well beaten ; when the milk tastes of the seasoning, sweeten it enough for the whole ; pour it into the cream, stir- ring it well; then give the custard a simmer till of a proper thickness. Do not let it boil; stir the whole time one way; season as above. If to be extremely rich, put no milk, but a quart of cream to the eggs. Baked Custard. Boil one pint of cream and half a pint of milk, with mace, cinnamon, and lemon-peel, a little of each. When cold, mix the yolks of three eggs; sweeten and make your cups or paste nearly full. Bake them ten minutes. Lemon Custards. Beat the yolks of eight eggs till they are as white as milk; then put to them a pint of boiling water, the rinds of two lemons grated, and the juice sweetened to your taste. Stir it on the fire till thick enough ; then add a large glass of rich wine, and half a glass of brandy ; give the whole one scald, and put it in cups, to be eaten cold.

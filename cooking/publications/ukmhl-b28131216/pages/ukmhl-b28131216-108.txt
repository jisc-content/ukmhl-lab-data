DOMESTIC COOKERY. 48 Chimp of Veal d-la-daube. Cut off the chump end of the loin ; take out the edge-bone ; stuff the hollow with good forcemeat, tie it up tight, and lay it in a stew-pan with the bone you took out, a little faggot of herbs, an anchovy, two blades of mace, a few white peppers, and a pint of good veal-broth.

Stew a few small mushrooms in their own liquor and a bit of butter, a quarter of an hour ; mince them very small, and add them (with their liquor) to mince veal, with also a little pepper and salt, some cream, and a

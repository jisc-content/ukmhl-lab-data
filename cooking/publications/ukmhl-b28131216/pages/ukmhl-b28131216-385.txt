DIRECTIONS T-O SERVANTS. To clean Looking-glasses. Remove the fly-stains, and other soil, by a damp raj:: then polish with woollen cloth and powder bine. To preserve Gilding, and clean it. It is not possible to prevent flies from staining the gilding without covering it; before which, blow off the light dust, and pass a feather or clean brush over it; then, with strips of paper cover the frames of your glasses, and do not remove it till the flies are gone. Linen takes off the gilding, and deadens its bright- ness ; it should therefore never be used for wiping it. Some means should be used to destroy the flies, as they injure furniture of every kind, and the paper likewise. Bottles hung about with sugar and vinegar, or beer, will attract them; or flv-water put into little shells placed about the room, but out of the reach of children. To clean Paint. Never use a cloth, but take off the dust with a lit- tle long-haired brush, after blowing off the loose part with the bellows. With care, paint will look well for a length of time. When soiled, dip a sponge or a bit of flannel into soda and water, wash it off quickly, and dry immediately, or the strength of the soda will eat off the colour. When wainscot requires scouring, it should be done from the top downwards, and the soda be prevented from running on the unclean part as much as possible, or marks will be made which will appear after the whole is finished. One person should dry with old â– inen as fast as the other has scoured off' the dirt and washed the soda off. To clean Paper Hangings. First blow off the dust with the bellows. Divide a white loal of eight days old into eight parts. Take the crust into your hand, and, beginning at the top of the paper, wipe it downwards in the lightest manner E il

LAMB. 79 tejed papers, either with crumbs anti herbs, or with- out, are a genteel dish, and eat well. Sauce for them, called Sauce Robart, will be found in the list of Sauces. House-Lamb Steaks, white. Stew them in milk and water till very tender, with a bit of lemon-peel, a little salt, some pepper, and mace. Have ready some veal-gravy, and put the steaks into it; mix some mushroom powder, a cup of cream, and the least bit of flour; shake the steaks in this liquor, stir it, and let it get quite hot. Just before you take it up, put in a few white mushrooms. This is a good substitute when poultry is very dear. House Lamb Steaks, brown. Season them with pepper, salt, nutmeg, grated le- mon-peel, and chopped parsley ; but dip them first into egg : fry them quick. Thicken some good gravy with a bit of flour and butter; and add to it a spoonful of port wine, and some oysters : boil it up, and then put in the steaks warm: let them heat up, and serve. You may add palates, balls, or eggs, if you like. Lamb Cutlets with Spinach. Cut the steaks from the loin, and fry them : the spinach is to be stewed and put into the dish first, and then the cutlets round it. Lamb’s Head and Hinge. f his part is best from a house-lamb; but any, if soaked in cold water, will be white. Boil the head separately till very tender. Have ready the liver and lights three parts boiled and cut small; stew them in a little of the water in which they were boiled, season and thicken with flour and butter, and serve the mince round the head. Lamb’s Fry. Serve it fried of a beautiful colour, and with a good deal of dried or fried parsley over it.

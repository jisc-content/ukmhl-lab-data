(xin file these checks, to be examined when the weekly bill shall be delivered. Much trouble and irregularity are saved When there is company, if servants are required to prepare the table and sideboard in similar order daily. All things likely to be wanted should be in readiness; sugars of different qualities kept broken, currants washed, picked, and perfectly dry, spices pounded, and kept in very small bottles close corked ; not more than will be used in four or five weeks should be pounded at a time. Much less is necesary than when boiled whole in gravies, &c. Where noonings or suppers are served, (and in every house some preparation is necessary for accidental visitors) care should be taken to have such things in readiness as are proper for either, and a list of several will be subjoined, a change of which may be agreeable, and if duly managed will be attended with little expense and much convenience. A ticket should be exchanged by the cook for every loaf of bread, which when returned will shew the number to be paid for; as tallies may be altered, unless one is kept by each party. Those who are served with brewer’s beer : or any other articles not paid for weekly, or on delivery, should keep a book for entering the dates; which will not only serve to prevent overcharges, but will shew the whole year’s con- sumption at one view. An inventory cf furniture, linen, and China should be kept, and the things examined by it twice a year, or oftener, if there be a change of servants; into each of whose care the articles irsed by him or her, should be entrusted, with a list, as is done with plate. Tickets of parchment, with the family name, numbered, and specifying what bed it belongs to should be sewed on each feather-bed, bolster, pillow, and blanket. Knives, forks, and house-cloths, are often deficient: these accidents might be obviated, if an article at the head of every list required the former should be produced whole or broken.

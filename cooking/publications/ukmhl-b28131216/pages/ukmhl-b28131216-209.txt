PUDDINGS. 145 spoonfuls of yeast; add one pound of currants, and a quarter of a pound of sugar beaten and sifted. This is a very good pudding hot ; and equally sa as a cake when cold. If for the latter, caraways may be used instead of currants. An hour will bake it in a quick oven. A Dutch Rice Pudding. Soak four ounces of rice in warm water half an hour; drain the latter from it, and throw it into a stewpan, with half a pint of milk, half a stick of cin- namon, and simmer till tender. When cold, add four whole eggs well beaten, two ounces of butter melted in a tea-cupful of fresh cream ; and put three ounces of sugar, a quarter of a nutmeg, and a good piece of lemon-peel. Put a light puli-paste into a mould or dish, or grated tops and bottoms, and bake in a quick oven. Light or German Puddings or Puffs. Melt three ounces ol butter in a pint of cream ; let it stand till nearly cold; then mix two ounces of fine flour, and two ounces of sugar, four yolks and two whites of eggs, and a little rose or orange-flour water. Bake in little cups, buttered, half an hour. They should be served the moment they are done, and only when going to be eaten, or they will not be light. Turn out of the cups, and serve with white wine and sugar. Little Bread Puddi ngs. Steep the crumb of a penny loaf grated, in about a pint of warm milk ; when soaked, beat six eggs, whites and yolks, and mix with the bread, and two ounces of butter warmed, sugar, orange-flower-water, a spoon- ful ot brandy, a little nutmeg, and a tea-cupful of cream. Beat all well, and bake in tea-cups buttered. If currants are chosen, a quarter of a pound is suffi- cient ; if not, they are good without; or you may put orange or lemon candy. Serve with pudding-sauce. 0

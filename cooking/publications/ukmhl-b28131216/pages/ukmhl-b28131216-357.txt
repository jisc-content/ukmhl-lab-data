SICK COOKERY. 293 PART XII. CO GILES,'L4' FOR THE SICK., AIM'D FOR THE POOR. SICK COOKERY. General Rcinarks. The following pages will contain cookery for the sick; it being of more consequence to support those whose bad appetite will not allow' them to take the necessai'y nourishment, than to stimulate that of per- sons in health, It may not be unnecessary to advise that a choice be made of the things most likely to agree with the patient; that a change be provided ; that some one at least be alwâ€™ays ready; that not too much of those be made at once, which are not likely to keep, as invalids require variety; and that they should succeed each other in different forms and flavours. A clear Broth that mill keep long. Put the mouse round of beef, a knuckle bone of veal, and a few shanks of mutton, into a deep pan, and cover close with a dish or coarse crust: bake till the beef is done enough for eating, with only as much Vater as will cover. When cold, cover it close in a cool place. When to be used, give what flavour may be approved. A qtiick made Broth. Take a bone or two of a neck or loin of mutton, lake off the fat and skin, set it on the fire in a small tin saucepan that has a cover, with three quarters of a pint of w'ater, the meat being first beaten, and cut in thin bits; put a bit of thyme and parsley, and, if ap- proved, a slice of onion. Let it boil very quick, skim it nicely ; take off the cover, if 1 ikely to be too wreak; else cover it. Half an hour is sufHejent for the whole process.

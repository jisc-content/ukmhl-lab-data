i!2 DOMESTIC COOKERY. lobster, and add this to it, with a quart of good beef, gravy ; add also the tails of the crawfish or the prawns, and some flour and butter; and season as may be liked, if not high enough. Oyster Soup. Take two quarts of fish-stock, as directed in page 110; beat the yolks of ten hard eggs, and the hard part of two quarts of oysters, in a mortar, and add this to the stock. Simmer it all for half an hour; then strain it off, and put it and the oysters (cleared of the beards, and nicely washed) into the soup. Simmer five minutes: have ready the yolks of six raw eggs â€¢well beaten, and add them to the soup. Stir it all well one way on the side of the fire till it is thick and smooth, but do not let it boil. Serve altogether. Oyster Mouth Soup. Make a rich mutton broth, tvith two large onions three blades of mace, and some black pepper. When strained, pour it on a hundred and fifty oysters, with- out the beards, and a bit of butter rolled in flour. Simmer gently a quarter of an hour, and serve. GRAVIES. General Directions respecting Gravies. Gravy may be made quite as good of the skirts o. beef, and the kidney, as of any other meat, prepared in the same way. An ox kidney, or milt, makes good gravy, cut all to pieces, and prepared as other meat; and so will the shank end of mutton that has been dressed, if much be not wanted. The shank-bones of mutton are a great improve< rnent to the richness of gravy; but first soak them well, and scour them clean. Tarragon gives the flavour of French cookery, and in high gravies is a great improvement; but it should be added only a short time before serving.

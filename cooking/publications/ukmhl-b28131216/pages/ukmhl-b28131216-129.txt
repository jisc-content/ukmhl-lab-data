PORK. 69 phalia. Sew hams in hessings (that is, coarse wrap- pers), if to be smoked where there is a strong fire. A method of giving a still higher favour.â€”Sprinkle the ham with salt, after it has hung two or three days; let it drain; make a pickle of a quart of strong beer half a pound of treacle, an ounce of coriander seeds, two ounces of juniper-berries, an ounce of pepper, the same quantity of allspice, an ounce of saltpetre, half an ounce of sal-prunel, a handful of common salt, and a head of shalot, all pounded or cut fine. Boil these all together a few minutes, and pour them over the ham : this quantity is for one of ten pounds. Rub and turn it every day, for a fortnight; then sew it up in a thin linen bag, and smoke it three weeks. Take care to drain it from the pickle, and rub it in bran, before drying. To make a Pickle that mill keep fur years, for Hams, Tongues, or Beef, if boiled and skimmed between each parcel of them .To two gallons of spring-water put two pounds of coarse sugar, two pounds of bay and two pounds and a half of common salt, and half a pound of saltpetre, in a deep earthen glazed pan that will hold four gallons, and with a cover that will fit close. Keep the beef or hams as long as they will bear, before you put them into the pickle; and sprinkle them with coarse sugar in a pan, from which they must drain. Rub the hams, &c. well with the pickle, and pack them in close; put- ting as much as the pan will hold, so that the pickle may cover them. The pickle is not to be boiled at first. A small ham may lie fourteen days, a large one three weeks; a tongue twelve days, and beef in propor- tion to its size. They will eat well out of the pickle without drying. When they are to be dried, let each piece be drained over the pan ; and when it will drop no longer, take a clean sponge and dry it thoroughly. Six or eight hours will smoke them, and there should be only a little sawdust and wet straw burnt to do this; i

They will not be fit to eat for some months, but are then finely flavoured, and by many preferred to capers. To make Mustard. Mix the best Durham flour of mustard with boiling water till of a proper thickness, rubbing it perfectly smooth ; add a little salt, and keep it in a small jar close covered, and put only as much into the glass as will be used soon, which should be wiped daily round the edges. Another may, for immediate use. Mix the mustard with new milk by degrees, to be quite smooth, and add a little raw cream. It is much softer this way, is not bitter, and will keep well. Tiie patent mustard is by many preferred, and it is perhaps as cheap, being always ready ; and if the pots are returned, three-pence is allowed for each. A tea-spoonful of sugar to half a pint of mustard is a great improvement, and softens it. Kitchen Pepper. Mix in the finest powder one ounce of ginger; of cinnamon, black pepper, nutmeg, and Jamaica pepper, half an ounce each ; ten cloves, and six ounces of salt.

It must be dried before pounded, and should be done in quanti- ties that may be wanted in three or four months. Nutmeg need not be done, but the others should oe. kept in separate bottles with a little label on each.

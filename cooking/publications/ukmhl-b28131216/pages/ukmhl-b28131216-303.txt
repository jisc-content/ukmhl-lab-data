Place the codlins then in a stone jar with a smallish mouth, and pour on them the water that scalded them. Cover the pot with bladder wetted, and tied very close, and then over it coarse paper tied again. It is best to keep them in small jars, such as will be used at once when opened. To keep Gooseberries. Before they become too large, let them be ga- thered ; and take care not to cut them in taking off the stalks and buds. Fill wide-mouthed bottles; put the corks loosely in, and set the bottles up to the neck in a boiler of water When the fruit looks scalded, take them out; and when perfectly cold, cork close and rosin the top. Dig a trench in a part of the gar- den less used, sufficiently deep for all the bottles to stand, and let the earth be thrown over to cover them a foot and a half. When a frost comes on, a little fresh litter from the stable will prevent the ground from hardening so that the fruit cannot be dug up. Or, scald as above ; when cold, fill the bottles with cold water, cork them, and keep them in a damp or dry place ; they will not be spoiled. Another may. â€” In the size and preparations as above ; when done, have boiling water ready, either in a boiler or large kettle ; and put into it as much roach-alum as will, when dissolved, harden the water which you will taste by a little roughness ; if there be too much it will spoil the fruit. Put as many goose- berries into a large sieve as will lie at the bottom without covering one another. Hold the sieve in the water till the fruit begins to look scalded on the out- side ; then turn them gently out of the sieve on a cloth on the dresser, cover them with another cloth, and put some more to be scalded, and so on till all be

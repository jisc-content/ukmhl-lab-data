Lettuces, white mustard leaves, or spinach, may be added to the parsley, and scalded before put in. Turnip Pie. Season mutton-chops with salt and pepper, reserving the end of the neck-bones to lay over the turnips, which must be cut into small dice, and put on the steaks. Put two or three good spoonfuls of milk in. You may add sliced onions. Cover with a crust. Potatoe Pie. Skin some potatoes, and cut them into slices; sea- son them ; and also some mutton, beef, pork, or veal. Put layers of them and of the meat. An Herb Pie.

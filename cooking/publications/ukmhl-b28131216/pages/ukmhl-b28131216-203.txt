SAVOURY TIES. 131) Pigeon Pie.

Season the hare after it is cut up ; and bake it, with eggs and forcemeat, in a raised crust or dish. When it is to be served, cut off the lid, and cover it with jelly-gravy, as in page 115. A French Pic. Lay a puff-paste round on the ledge of the dish, and put in either veal in slices, rabbits, or chickens jointed, with forcemeat-balls, sweetbreads cut in pieces, artichoke-bottoms, and a few truffles.

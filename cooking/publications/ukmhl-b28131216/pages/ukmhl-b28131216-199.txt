SAVOUltV PIES 135 squeeze it dry ; cut it a little, and lay it at the bottom of the dish ; then put the meat, and so on, in layers. Fill the dish with new milk, but not so high as to touch the crust. Cover it; and when baked, pour out a little of the milk, and put in half a pint of good scalded cream.â€”Chicken may be cut up skinned, and made in the same way. Veal-Olive Pie. Make the olives as directed in page 52; put them round and round in the dish, making the middle highest. Fill it up almost with water, and cover it. Add gravy, cream, and flour. Calfs-Head Pie. Stew a knuckle of veal till fit for eating, with two onions, a few isinglass shavings, a bunch of herbs, a blade of mace, and a few pepper-corns, in three pints of water. Keep the broth for the pie. Take off a bit of the meat for the balls, and let the other be eaten, but simmer the bones in the broth till it is very good. Half-boil the head, and cut it in square bits; put a layer of ham at the bottom; then some head, first fat then lean, with balls and hard eggs cut in half, and so on till the dish be full: but be particularly careful not to place the pieces close, or the pie will be too solid, and there will be no space for the jelly. The meat must be first pretty well seasoned with pepper and salt, and a scrape or two of nutmeg. Put a little water and a little gravy into the dish, and cover it with a tolerable thick crust; bake it in a slow oven, and, when done, pour into it as much gravy as it can possibly hold, and do not cut it tiil perfectly cold; in doing which, observe to use a very sharp knife, and first cut out a large bit, going down to the bottom of the dish ; and when done thus, thinner slices can be cut; the different colours, and the clear jelly, have a beautiful marbled appearance. A small pie may be made to eat hot, which with high seasoning, oysters, mushrooms, truffles, morels. Sic. has a very good appearance.

6iderations of the strictest economy! There ought to be a material difference in the degree of care which a person of a large and independent estate bestows on money con- cerns, and that of a person in confined circumstances : yet both may very commendably employ some portion of their time and thoughts on this subject. The custom of the times tends in some measure to abolish the distinctions of ( rank; and the education given to young people, is nearly 1 the same in all: but though the leisure of the higher may be well devoted to elegant accomplishments, the pursuits of those in a middle line, if less ornamental, would better se- cure their own happiness and that of others connected with them. We sometimes bring up children in a manner cal- culated rather to fit them for the station we wish, than that which it is likely they will actually possess: and it is in all cases worth the while of parents to consider whether the expectation or hope of raising their offspring above their own situation be well-founded. The cultivation of the understanding and disposition however, is not here alluded to ; for a judicious improve- ment of both, united to firm and early-taught religious prin- ciples, would enable the happy possessor of these advan- tages to act well on all occasions : nor would young ladies find domestic knowledge a burthen, or inconsistent with higher attainments, if the rudiments of it were inculcated, at a tender age, when activity is so pleasing. If employ- ment be tiresome to a healthy child, the fault must be traced to habits which, from many causes, are not at pre- sent favourable to the future conduct of women. It fre- quently happens, that before impressions of duty are made on the mind, ornamental education commences ; and it ever after takes the lead : thus, what should be only the em- bellishment, becomes the main business of life. There is no opportunity of attaining a knowledge of family manage- ment at school; and during vacation, all subjects that might interfere with amusement are avoided.

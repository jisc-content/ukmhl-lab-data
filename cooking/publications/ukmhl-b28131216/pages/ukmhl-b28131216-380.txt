Blue.—To four pounds of blue vitrol, and a pound of the best whiting, put a gallon of water, in an iron or brass pot. Let it boil an hour, stirring it all the time. Then pour it into an earthem pan ; and set it by for a day or two, till the colour is settled. Pour off the water, and mix the colour with whitewasher’s size. Wash the walls three or four times, according as is necessary. Yellow.—Dissolve in soft water, over the fire, equal quantities separately of umber, bright oker, and blue black. Then put it into as much whitewash as you think sufficient for the work, some of each, and stir it all together. If either cast predominates, add more of the others till you have the proper tint. The most beautiful whitewash is made by mixing the lime and size with skim milk, instead of water. Roman Cement, or Mortar for outside Plastering, or Brick-work. This will resist all weather; and may be used to great advantage to line reservoirs, as no water can penetrate it.

One hod of this mortar will go a great way, as it is to be laid on in a thin smooth coat, without the least space being left uncovered. The ■wall or lath-work should be covered first with hair and lime-mortar, and well dried. This was used by the ancients, and is now adopted among us. The Suffolk cheese does better than any other of this country.

Take an ounce of each of the following articles, namely, storax, gum-benjamin, odoriferous cypress-powder, or of Florence ; half an ounce of cin- namon, two drams of cloves, and two drams of nutmeg, all finely powdered ; mix them with the marrow above prepared ; then put all the ingredients into a pewter pot that holds three pints; make a paste of white of egg and flour, and lay it upon a piece of rag. Over that must be another piece of linen to cover the top of the pot very ciose, that none of the steam may evapo- rate. Put the pot into a large copper pot, with water, observing to keep it steady, that it may not reach to the covering of the pot that holds the marrow. As the water shrinks, add more, boiling hot; for it must boil four hours without ceasing a moment. Strain the ointment through a linen cloth into small pots, and, when cold, cover them. Do not touch it with any thing but silver. It will keep many years. A fine pomatum may be made by putting half a pound of fresh marrow, prepared as above, and two ounces of hog’s-lard, on the ingredients; and then observing the same process as before. Pot Pourri.

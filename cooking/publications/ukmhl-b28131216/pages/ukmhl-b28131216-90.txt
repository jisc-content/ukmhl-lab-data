DOMESTIC COOKERY 30 Formerly pap-sauce was eaten with venison ; which, as some still like it, it may be necessary to direct. Grate white bread and boil it with port wine, water, and a large stick of cinnamon; and when quite smooth take out the cinnamon and add sugar. Claret may be used for it. Make the jelly-sauce thus. Beat some currant-jelly and a spoonful or two of port wine, and set it over the fire till melted. Where jelly runs short put more wine, and a few lumps of sugar, to the jelly, and melt as above. Serve with French beans. Haunch, Neck, and Shoulder of Venison. Boast with paste as directed above, and the same sauce. To stew a Shoulder of Venison. Let the meat hang till you think fit to dress it; then take out the bone, beat the meat with a rolling-pin, lay some slices of mutton-fat, that have lain a few hours in a little port wine, sprinkle a little pepper and all- spice over it in fine powder, roll it up tight, and tie it. Set it in a stewpan that will only just hold it, with some mutton or beef gravy not strong, half a pint of port wine ; and some pepper and allspice. Simmer it close-covered, as slow as you can, for three or four hours. When quite tender, take off the tape, set the meat in a dish, strain the gravy over it, and serve with currant-jelly sauce.â€”This is the best way to dress this joint, unless it is very fat, and then it should be roasted. The bone should be stewed with it. Breast of Venison. Do it as the shoulder, or make it into a small pasty. Hashed Venison Should be warmed with its own gravy, or some with- out seasoning, as before; and only warmed through, not boiled. If there is no fat left, cut some slices of mutton-fat, set it on the fire with a little port wine and sugar, simmer till dry, then put to the hash, and it will eat as well as the fat of the venison.

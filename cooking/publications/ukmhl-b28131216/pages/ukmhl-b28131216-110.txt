DOMESTIC COOKERY. 50 Cutlets another way. Prepare as above, and fry them ; lay them into a dish, and keep them hot; dredge a little flour, and put a bit ot butter into the pan; brown it, then pour a little boiling water into it, and boil quick : season with pepper, salt, and ketchup, and pour over them. Other ways.—Prepare as before, and dress the cut- lets in a Dutch-oven ; pour over them melted-butter and mushrooms. Or, pepper, salt, and broil them, especially neck- steaks. They are excellent with herbs. Veal Collops. Cut long thin collops ; beat them well; and iay on them a bit of thin bacon of the same size, and spread forcemeat on that, seasoned high, and also a little garlick and Cayenne. Roll them up tight, about the size of two fingers, but not more than two or three inches long ; put a very small skewer to fasten each firmly ; rub egg over ; fry them of a fine brown, and pour a rich brown gravy over. To dress Collops quick. Cut them as thin as paper with a very sharp knife, and in small bits. Throw the skin, and any odd bits of the veal, into a little water, with a dust of pepper and salt ; set them on the fire while you beat the collops; and dip them into a seasoning of herbs, bread, pepper, salt, and a scrape of nutmeg, but first wet them in egg. Then put some butter into a frying-pan, and give the collops a very quick fry; for as they are so thin, two minutes will do them on both sides: put them into a hot dish before the fire; then strain and thicken the gravy, give it a boil in the frying-pan, and pour it over the collops, A little ketchup is an improvement. Another way.—Fry them in butter, only seasoned with salt and pepper ; simmer them in gravy, either white or brown, writh bits of bacon served with them. If white, add lemon-peel and mace, and some cream.

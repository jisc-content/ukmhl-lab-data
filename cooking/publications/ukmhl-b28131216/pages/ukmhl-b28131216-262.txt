Cream, milk, or a whip of cream, sugar, wine, and lemon, to be put in the dish, or into a glass bowl, to serve with the curd. Another Way.—To four quarts of new milk warmed, put from a pint to a quart of buttermilk strained, ac- cording to its sourness ; keep the pan covered until the curd be of firmness to cut three or four times across with a saucer ; as the whey leaves it, put it into a shape, and fill up until it be solid enough to take the lorm. Serve with cream plain, or mixed with sugar, wine, and lemon. A Curd Star. Set a quart of new milk upon the fire with two or three blades of mace; and, when ready to boil, put to it the yolks and whites of nine eggs well beaten, and as much salt as will lie upon a small knife’s point. Let it boil till the whey is clear; then drain it in a thin cloth, or hair sieve; season it with sugar, or a little cinnamon, rose-water, orange-flower water, or white wine, to your taste ; and put it into a star form, or any other. Let it stand some hours before you turn it into a dish ; then put round it thick cream or custard. Blanc-mangc or Blamange. Boil two ounces of isinglass in three halfpints of water half an hour ; strain it to a pint and a half of cream ; sweeten it, and add some peach-water, or a few bitter almonds; let it boil once up, and put it into what forms you please. If not to be very stiff, a little less isinglass frill do. Observe to let the blamange settle before you lurn it into the forms, or the blacks will remain at the bottom of them, and be on the top of the blamange when taken out of the moulds. Jaunemange. Pour a pint of boiling water over three ounces or isinglass, and when it is dissolved, add a pint of white wine, the juice of three oranges, and two lemons.

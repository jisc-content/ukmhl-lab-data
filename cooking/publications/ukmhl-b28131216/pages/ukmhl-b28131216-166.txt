10- DOMESTIC COOKERY. An excellent white Soup.

Boil it a few minutes; add to it a pint of soup, and strain and pulp it through a coarse sieve ; this thickening is then fit for putting to the rest, which should boil for half an hour afterwards.

Scald and clean three or four sets of goose or duck giblets; set them to stew, with a pound or two of gravy-beef, scrag of mutton, or the bone of a knuckle of veal; an ox-tail, or some shanks of mutton; with

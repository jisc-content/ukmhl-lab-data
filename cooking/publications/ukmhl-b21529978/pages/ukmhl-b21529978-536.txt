PRAYER. \ The following extracts, being a few quotations from the works of good men, are here noted down as a guide to prayer. Without it we are nothing, with it we are mighty. It is a glorious state to be in harmony with God; and by prayer, we assuredly learn His will, and act according to His teaching:— When is the time for prayer?— With the first beams that light the morning sky, Ere for the toils of day thou dost prepare. Lift up thy thoughts on high : Commend thy loved ones to His watchful care :— Morn is the time for prayer ! And in the noontide hour. If worn by toil, or by sad cares opprest, Then unto God thy spirit’s sorrow pour. And He will give you rest Thy voice shall reach Him through the fields of air: • Noon is the time for prayer! When the bright sun hath set— Whilst yet eve’s glowing colours deck the skies,— When with the loved, at home, again thou’st met, Then let thy praise arise For those who in thy joys and sorrows share ; Eve is the time for prayer! And when the stars come forth— ■Wlien to the trusting heart sweet hopes are given, And the deep stillness of the hour gives birth To pure bright dreams of heaven,— Kneel to thy God—ask strength, life’s ills to bear Night is the time for prayer!

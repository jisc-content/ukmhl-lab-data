449 THINGS A LADY WOULD LIKE TO KNOW. a dressing of plenty of oil, little vinegar, salt to taste, no mustard or pepper. This salad is nice garnished with hard-boiled eggs cut into quarters, picked shrimps or prawns, anchovy fillets in oil cut into strips, and capers or gherkins cut into slices. Whiter Salad.—Nearly fill the salad-bowl with rounds of beetroot, slices of celery, rampion roots with their plume of blanched leaves, and boiled potatoes. Place a dish on the salad-bowl; turn the la tter topsy-turvy, and put into it a hard yolk of egg for every two persons; crush them in oil till they form a paste. To this paste add chervil, crushed tunny (which may be bought preserved in bottles), pounded anchovies, some of Maille’s mustard, a large spoonful of soy, gherkins cut in slices, and the whites of the hard eggs chopped in pieces, and moisten the whole with some of the very best vinegar. Then re >tore the salad to the bowl, stirring it thoroughly. When well stirred, let fall on it a pinch of powdered Hungarian capsicum, or the smallest quantity of cayenne. Winter Salad.—From the end of September to March.—En iive, boiled beetroot, mustard and cress, celery, and 3 or 4 hard-boiled eggs form the chief ingredients of a winter salad; and if the colours are nicely contrasted, and it is tastefully garnished, it may be converted into a very pretty dish. The celery must be most carefully washed, anc all worm-eaten pieces cut away, and shred into thin pieces; the mus tard and cress and endive well cleansed and placed high in the centre of the dish or salad-bowl, garnished with the eggs and beetroot, each cut in slices; then pour some salad-dressing into the dish, but not over the salad. The sauce may be prepared beforehand, but the salad losec its freshness and pretty appearance if made long before it is wanted.

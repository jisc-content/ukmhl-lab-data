Then put in a little milk, work it well with a spoon, set it in the oven again, and keep working it from time to time until it is sufficiently soft.

Bake it till the rice has a light-brown or fawn colour in the surface. ‘ / live for those who love me, For those who know me true; For the Heaven that smiles above me. And awaits my spirit too.

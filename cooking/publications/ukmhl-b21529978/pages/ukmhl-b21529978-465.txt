457 SUMMER BEVERAGES, LIQUEURS, Etc. ‘ If thou wilt observe The rule ^NOT TOO much, by temperance taught In what thou eat'st and drink’st, seeking from them Due nourishment, not gluUonotis delight. Till many years over thy head return : So mayst thou live, till like ripe fruit thou drop Into thy mothers lap ; or be with ease Gather'd, not harshly pluck'd, in death mature.'—Milton'. Punch h la Ford.—To make punch on a large scale, select 3 dozen of lemons, the coats of which are smooth, and whose rinds are not too thin. These should be peeled with a sharp knife into a large earthen vessel, taking care that none of the rind be detached but that portion in which the cells are placed containing the essential oil. When the first part of the process is completed, add 2 lbs. of lump sugar, and stir the peel and sugar together with an oar-shaped piece of wood for nearly half an hour; by this means a greater quantity of the essential oil will be extracted. Boiling water may be next poured into the vessel, and the whole well stirred until the sugar is completely dissolved. The lemons should then be cut and squeezed, the juice strained from the kernels, and these be next placed in a separate jug, and boiling water poured upon them, for the pips will be found to be enveloped in a thick mucilage, full of flavour; half the lemon-juice must now be thrown in, and as soon as the kernels are free from their transparent coating, their liquor should be strained and added. The sherbet may now be tasted; more acid or sugar applied as required, and care taken not to render the lemonade too watery. The sherbet is now fit for measurement, and to every 3 quarts a pint of cognac brandy and a pint of old Jamaica rum should be allotted, the spirit being well stirred as poured in ; bottling immediately to follow, and, when completed, the brewage to be kept in a cool cellar, or tank, till required. Punch thus made is much improved by time and a cool atmosphere.

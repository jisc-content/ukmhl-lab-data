Roast Ducklings and Apple Sauce.—Stuff one with sage and onion, a dessert-spoonful of crumbs, a bit of butter, and pepper and salt; and for the gravy, mix equal parts of onion, parsley, and mushrooms chopped fine; boil them in butter, add ^ pint of brown sauce, 2 table-spoonfuls of vinegar; season with salt. Pour round—not over—the ducks. 2. Boiled Brisket of Beef—A piece of brisket or thin flank of beef, weighing 8 lbs., will take four hours’ boiling. To know if it be boiled s enough, you may insert a fork through the meat a little way; and 'if it feel soft, then it is done. Pease-pudding is good with boiled beef. Brisket of beef, if to be eaten cold, should be laid on a board ^ and a heavy weight should be set on it, to press out all the loose fat: it then cuts smooth and solid. 4. Potato Dunipluigs. Having peeled the potatoes you require, grate them into water, and leave the pulp there for two hours; drain off the water, and mix with the potato half its weight in flour. Season to taste, with pepper, salt, chopped onion, and sweet herbs. Roll into dump- lings size of large apples, toss into a pan of boiling water, and boil till they rise to the top, when they will be sufficiently done. APRIL 14.

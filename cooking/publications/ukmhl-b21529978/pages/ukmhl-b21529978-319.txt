DESSEJiT F02^ OCTOBER. 4. QUINCE PASTE. Put your quinces whole into water, and simmer them slowly until they are tender; pare, core, mash, and pass them through a sieve. Place the pulp in a preserving-pan over the fire, and add to it an equal weight of fine loaf sugar; boil it until it is thickened, and spread it upon sugared plates or papers. Dry it slowly in a slack oven, and keep for use between paper. 5. BISCUITS AUX AVELLINES. Blanch half a pound of filberts and i oz. of bitter almonds; pound them in a mortar, using a little white of egg with them to prevent them from oiling. Beat the yolks of 3 eggs, half a pound of sifted loaf sugar, and the rasped rind of half a lemon. Whisk the whites of 6 eggs to a snow, add to them the yolks, etc., and very gradually sift in i oz. of dried flour. Put the mixture into paper cases, and bake until they are of a nice colour. The slower the oven is, the lighter and better these will be. 6. POMMES A Lâ€™ALLEMANDE. Pare and core i lb. of pippins ; put with them 6 oz. of powdered sugar, a good glass of Rhine wine (white), and the strained juice of two good sweet oranges. Simmer this by the side of the fire until it is pretty thick, then mix it with 4 oz. of apricot or pine-apple jam, and 4 oz. of blanched sweet almonds, cut in half or pounded to a paste, as preferred. Give it a boil up, put it into a greased mould, and when quite set turn it into a dessert-dish, and garnish it with candied orange chips.

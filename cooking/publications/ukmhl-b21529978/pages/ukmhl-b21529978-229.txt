Stone your apricots; pulp them through a sieve; put to them an equal weight of clarified sugar; and to each pound of this composition add half a dozen blanched apricot kernels infused for two hours in the juice of a lemon and a little water. Work well together, put it into the ice-pot, and freeze it gradually. 2. COMPOTE DE PRUNES. Take of any kind of ripe plums sufficient to make a good-sized dish. If you purpose to have them stoned, remove the stone as carefully as you can from the stem end of the fruit. Should the plums be of a large kind, they should be first scalded, and afterwards immersed in cold water. Small fruit may at once be placed in an earthen pipkin, with a syrup made with their weight of loaf sugar, a wine-glassful of white brandy, and enough water to float them in. Do them as slowly as possible, and as soon as they are tender place them in your com- pote dish, and pour over them the syrup when cooled. 3. COMPOTE DE MELON. Cut a good sized melon into rather thick slices; take away the rind and the seeds; divide each slice into square pieces, then round them so as to resemble large apricots. Prepare a strong syrup of sugar and water; throw m your melon ; withdraw it from the fire; cover it down close, and let it remain some time to infuse; then let it come quickly

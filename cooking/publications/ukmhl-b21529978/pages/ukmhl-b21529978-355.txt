Tench. 2. Roast Leg of Mutton. 4- Boiled Orange Pudding. 5. Vegetables. 3. Woodcocks and Snipes. I. Tench.—Prepare and pickle the fish. Set it on the fire, in a mixture, just enough to cover it, of half good veal broth and half red wine, cold, with a few peppercorns, the rind of half a lemon, and a sprig of parsley and sweet marjoram. When the boiling point is* reached let it simmer slowly, taking care the fish do not break. When done, transfer it to an oval dish; garnish it round with alternate bits of toasted bread and slices of lemon. Remove the bouquet and lemon- peel from the gravy. Thicken it with a bit of butter worked in flour; season to taste with salt, or with a tea-spoonful of anchovy sauce, and the juice of half a lemon. Boil up, and pour over the fish. 3. Woodcocks and Snipes.—These birds should be roasted by the aid of a jack or bird-spit, the thighs closely secured to the body by an iron skewer. Let them be well basted, and have a bright fire; place toast under them to receive the trails. Twenty minutes’ roasting is sufficient for woodcocks, a quarter of an hour for snipes. Serve with lemon-juice and soluble cayenne. 4. Boiled Orange Puddmg.—'Bta.t the grated rind of 2 Seville oranges in a mortar to paste; put ^ lb. of Naples biscuits into i pint of cream; mix this with the orange paste; add sugar to taste, and 5 well-beaten eggs; mix all together with a pinch of salt; tie in a floured pudding- cloth, and put in a pan of boiling water : an hour will boil it Serve with sweet sauce.

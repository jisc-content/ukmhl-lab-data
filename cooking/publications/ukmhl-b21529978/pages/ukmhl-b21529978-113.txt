105 BILL OF FARE FOR MAR OIL fat; thicken it with a tea-spoonful of flour, a bit of butter the size of a walnut, and add the juice of a lemon; boil this up, and, when the pie is sufficiently baked, strain it through a fine sieve, make a hole in the crust, pour in the liquor, replace the paste you have removed, smear the top with the yolk of an egg, and set the pie before the fire for a few minutes. 4. Boiled Apple Make a good paste, roll it out half an inch thick, but quite thin round the edge; pare and core apples suffi- cient to fill the crust; close it up, tie it up tight in a cloth, and boil it from two to three hours according to the size. When it is done, turn it into a dish, cut a piece of crust out of the top, put in a good lump of butter, and as much sugar as will sweeten it to your taste, a little grated lemon-peel, and i drop of oil of cinnamon ; stir it well in the pudding, lay on the crust, and send it to table hot. ‘ The maxim, “ Reverence thyself," seems to me peculiarly proper for a woman..'—• Rev. James Fordyce, D.D. I. Neck of Mutton Soup.—Put a cupful of pearl barley into a pot with 3 quarts of cold water, and let it boil; then put in 2 lbs. of neck of mutton; boil it gently for an hour, taking care to skim it occasionally, and watch n to prevent it boiling over. Then put in i grated carrot, and 2 turnips cut in small squares; an onion or two, sliced thin, or a leek, and 2 or 3 pieces of carrot and turnip, uncut. Boil the whole for an hour longer after the vegetables are put in, adding, if required, a little hot water to make up for loss in boiling. Season with salt only, and serve the broth in a tureen or deep dish. The meat is served in a separate dish, garnished with the uncut turnip and carrot. Thus the broth, meat, and vegetables, being all used, food for a large number is produced at a very small expense. —0- MARCH 27. 1. Neck of Mutton Soup. 2. Boiled Leg of Pork. 3. Parsnips. 4.

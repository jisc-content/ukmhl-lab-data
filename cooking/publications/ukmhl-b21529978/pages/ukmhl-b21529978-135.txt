Pour the boiling stock on the whole, and simmer for an hour. Rub the yolks of 2 hard-boiled eggs in | pint of cream, put in the soup, bring it to a boil, and serve directly. 2. Boiled Leg of Mutton.—This should be boiled in a deep fish-kettle with a strainer at the bottom to take it up by, as a fork should never be stuck in the meat. Weigh the mutton, place it in scalding wdXox enough to just cover it; after it bubbles, allow a quarter of an hour to every lb. it weighs, and eight minutes to any ^ lb. Never allow it to boil, but just to bubble: if it boils, the meat will be hard; if it does not bubble, the meat will eat raw. 3.

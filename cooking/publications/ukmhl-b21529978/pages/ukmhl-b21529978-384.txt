‘PARTY’ DINNERS ARRANGED FOR EVERY MONTH IN THE YEAR, DULY CONSULTING THE PROVISIONS WHEN IN THEIR PRIME. ^ SUGGESTIONS TO THOSE WHO GIVp DINNER PARTIES. ‘ Sh-, you are very welcome to our house ; It must appear in other ways than words. Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.'—.Shakspeare. WITH respect to setting out a dinner-table, everything should be brilliantly clean, and nothing should be placed upon it except what is wanted \ and everything wanted, which can conveniently be upon the table, should be there, so as to dispense as much as possible with attendance, and thereby avoid the trouble of asking for things. I think it desirable not to have lights upon it, nor, indeed, anything which can interrupt the freest communication among the guests. The art of throwing the most agreeable light upon a table is well worth cultivating. Instead of inconvenient and useless centre-pieces, I would have a basket of beautiful bread, white and brown, in the middle of the table, with a silver fork on each side, so that the guests could help themselves, which would be perfectly easy with a party not exceeding eight, which limit I understand in all I say. I would have the wine placed upon the table in such a manner as to be as much as possible within the reach of each person; and I hold stands for decanters to be impediments, and coolers also, except, perhaps, in very hot weather. If the wine is served at a proper temperature, it will m general remain so, as long as ought to be necessary; ^ but it is often set upon the table before it is wanted, for show. Instead of the supernumeranes we now ' For cooling wine, fold a wet cloth entirely round the decanter, and place it in a current of air. Be particular that it is tjuite covered. 376-

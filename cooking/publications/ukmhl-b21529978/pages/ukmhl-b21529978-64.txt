THINGS A LADY WOULD LIKE TO KNOW. 2. Mutton and Beef Fie.—UuQ a deep dish with good dripping crust. Beat the meat with your rolling-pin, then broil it in the lump for ten minutes; cut it in slices, and lay it in the dish with thin strips of salt pork alternately, season it with pepper and salt, and put in a lump of butter (about 2 oz.), some mushroom ketchup, and water thickened with flour, enough to nearly fill the dish; cover it with the upper crust, and bake for an hour and a quarter, or a little longer if the crust be thick. , r 4. c. Mince Ties.—Take equal weights of tender roast beef, suet, currants, raisins, and apples which have been previously pared and cored, with half their weight ot soft sugar, i oz. of powdered cinnamon, an equal quantity of candied orange and lemon peel and citron, a little salt and 12 bitter almonds blanched and grated. Chop the meat and the'suet separately; wash and pick the currants; stone the raisins, and chop them with the peel; and having minced all the ingredients very- fine, mix them together, adding a nutmeg grated and the juice of a lemon. A glass or two of wine or spirit greatly improves it. Line your dish or pattypans with puff paste ; fill with the mince ; cover, an pinch the edges together. Bake half an hour. Many persons make the mince without meat. JANUARY SO. 1. Sturgeon, Roast. 2. Do. Garnished, 3. Devonshire Squab Pie. 4. Vegetables. 5. Open Tarts. 6. Gravy.

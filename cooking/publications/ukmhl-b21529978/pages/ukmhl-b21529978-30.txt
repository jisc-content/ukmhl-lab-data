Meat, or indeed any article, should be frequently turned and agitated during frying, to promote the evaporation of the watery particles To make fried things look well, they should be done over twice with egg and stale bread-crumbs. STEWS AND SALTED MEAT. Liebig observes, that stewing meat with vegetables is probably the most economical mode of cookery that has ever been '"ven^d, and many think it the most palatable. The meat should be cut into mode- rately smaU pieces, and put into the water when cold; and the whole should be very gradually heated till it nearly reaches the boihng point. The vegetables should be put in when the meat is about half toe and if a few onions are fried and added to the stew, they not o“y 4c“ ase the flavour, but give a rich brown colour. Setto sHouU ''Mterc'£ttbre‘'txperiments, Liebig found that the kind of salted mett whJiTs least injurious to the system is that which is cured with salt containing a considerable portion of of maenesium ; the external aspect of flesh salted in this manner Dein^ coverfd as if with a white froth, consisting chiefly of phosphate of lime eaten with caution by those who have weak stomachs.

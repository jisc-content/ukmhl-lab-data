BREAKFASTS. ‘ Then to breakfast with what appetite you have.'—Shakspeare, ♦ The less luxurious your breakfast table is, the better, always provided you are careful to have the four essentials,—good tea, good coffee or cocoa, good bread, and sweet butter, together with a fitting supply of milk and cream. I would therefore recommend a few savoury things suitable to the several months of the year, harmless, nutritive, and easily digested. Never forget to have a fair damask cloth upon your table j nothing shows off so sweetly the morning repast with its bright silver, its cheerful china, and the merry, hissing urn. When the months have flowers, by all means have the epergne well filled; for, as the poet beautifully says, ‘They are the smiles of God.’ JANUARY.

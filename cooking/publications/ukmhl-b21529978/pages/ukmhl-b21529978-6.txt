‘ Unto the boundless ocean of thy beauty Runs this poor river, charged with streams of zeal, Returning thee the tribute of my duty, Which here my love, my suit, my plaints reveal. Here I unclasp the book of my charged soul. Where I have cast th’ accounts of all my care : Here have I summed my thoughts ; here I enrol How they were spent for thee : look what they are. Look on the dear expenses of thy youth. And see how just I reckon with mine eyes : Examine well thy bearings with my truth ; And mark thy cares ere greater sums arise. Read it, sweet girl, tho’ it be done but slightly ; Who can show all his love, doth love but lightly.’ —Earl of Surrey. ‘ Read, and fear not thine own understanding : this book will create a clear one in thee; and when thou dost consider thy purchase, thou wilt call .the price of it a charity to thyself.’—Shirley. 2

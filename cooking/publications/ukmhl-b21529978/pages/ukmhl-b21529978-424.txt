Scotch Broth.—Take a neck of mutton with the fat raised from off the best end. Cut off the scrag end, and divide it into several pieces to make the broth. Let it boil gently a couple of hours, skimming well. Then add sliced carrots, onions, turnips, celery, a sprig of parsley, pepper and salt, a tea-cupful of split peas, and 6 table-spoonfuls of pearl-barley, both previously steeped in tepid water. Cut the best end off the neck into mutton-chops, exactly as if for frying; put them in soon after the vegetables, and let the whole simmer together until all is tender. A second skimming will be required after the addition of the fresh meat and vegetables. In serving, there should be a mutton-chop for each person’s plate, to be accompanied by the vegetables, barley, and brose. 2.

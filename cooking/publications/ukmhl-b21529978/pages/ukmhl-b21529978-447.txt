r SALADS. * IViU please you taste of what is here.'—ShakspeARE. Where salads are much in request, it is a good plan to bottle off sufficient ‘ dressing ’ for a few days’ consumption ; but the salad should not be made long before it is wanted for table. The dressing will re- main good for four or five days if kept in a cool place. Beetroot as a Wmter Salad.—It is extremely good, boiled and sliced with a small quantity of onion, or stewed with whole onions, large or small, as follows ; Boil the beet tender with the skin on ; slice it into a stewpan with a little broth and a spoonful of vinegar. Simmer till the gravy is tinged with the colour, then put it into a small dish, and make a round of the button-onions, first boiled till tender; take off the skin just before serving, and mind they are quite hot and clear. Or roast 3 large onions, and peel off the outer skin till they look clear, and serve the beetroot strewed round them. If beetroot is in the least broken before dressed, it parts with its colour, and looks ill. Chicken Salad.—Neatly trim the remains of a cold roast or boiled fowl or chicken; wash dry, and slice the lettuces, and place them in the middle of the dish, with a little endive. Put the pieces of chicken at top, and pour salad dressing over them. Garnish the edge of the salad with hard-boiled eggs cut in rings, sliced cucumber, and boiled beetroot cut in slices; or, if arranged nicely, the yolks of the eggs (instead of cutting them in rings) may be rubbed through a hair sieve, and the whites chopped very finely, placing the yellow and white alter- nately m small bunches on the salad. To be made just before wanted for table. Co^s/ifs and Creatn Salad.—Yia\m\ a small bowl with the petals only (removed from the calyx) of fresh-blown and fresh-gathered cow- slips; cover them with thick cream, well flavoured with sugar and

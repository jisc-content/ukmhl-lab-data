Take them up; peel, core, and cut them into halves or quarters as pre- ferred ; put them into a preserving-pan with their weight of fine loaf sugar, and a tea-cupful each of red wine and water. Do them very slowly over a slack fire, and when of a good colour place them in the compotier, skim the syrup, and pour it over them. Should the pears be very ripe, they may be peeled, cored, cut up, and at once done in the syrup. 4. BISCUITS D’aMANDES.

Well whisk the whites of the eggs; put them with the almonds; add the yolks, and gradually thicken it with 4 oz. of flour rubbed together with another pound of loaf sugar finely powdered and sifted.

Beat well together 12 oz. of powdered loaf sugar, the whites of 3 eggs, and the rasped rind of a sweet orange.

Place some very fine slips of candied citron-peel in the middle of each, wet the edges, cover the souffle's with a similar shaped piece of the paste, press them together, put them into a slow oven, and when done, and suffered to grow cold, take them from the papers, glaze them with an icing, and place them in a warm spot to set. 6.

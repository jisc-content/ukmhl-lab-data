454 PICKLING. ‘ Here you have that which in itself is good, made better by storing of it.'—Fuller. Always use stone jars, as vinegar and salt will penetrate through earthenware. Use the best vinegar. Never put in the hand to take pickles out of the jar, but use a wooden spoon with little holes bored through it. If you take out more pickle than you require to use, do not put what is left back into the jar, and be careful to keep grease from your pickles. Keep the jar securely covered. The glazing on earthen jars is made from lead or arsenic, from which vinegar draws forth poison. Keep pickles in a dry place. To pickle Red Cabbage.—(July and August; best when the frost has touched the leaves.)—Slice it into a colander, and sprinkle each layer with salt; let it drain two days; then put it into a jar, and pour boiling vinegar enough to cover, and put a few slices of red beetroot. Those who like the flavour of spice will boil it with the vinegar \ the propor- tion to each quart of vinegar will be i oz. of whole black pepper, -i oz. of ginger well bruised, and, if liked, a little cayenne. A little bruised cochineal boiled with the vinegar adds to the appearance; or cauli- flower cut in branches, and thrown in after being salted, will look of a beautiful red. Observe to choose the purple red cabbage, seasonable in July and August; but the pickle will be more crisp if the frost has touched the leaves. Tie down with bladder, and keep in a dry place. To Pickle Young Cucumbers.—Choose young gherkins; spread them on dishes ; salt them, and let them lie a week ; drain them, and, putting them in a jar, pour boiling vinegar over them. Set them near the fire, covered with plenty of vine leaves. If they do not become a tc.erable good green, pour the vinegar into another jar, set it over the hot hearth, and, when it boils, pour it over them again, covering with fresh leaves ; and thus do till they are as good a colour as you wish. Seasonable from June to August.

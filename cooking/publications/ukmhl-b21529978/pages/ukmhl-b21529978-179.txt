Veal stewed with Peas, etc.—3 or 4 lbs. of loin or neck of veal, 15 young carrots, a few green onions, a pint of green peas, 12 new potatoes, a bunch of savoury herbs, pepper and salt to taste, i table-spoonful of lemon-juice, 2 table-spoonfuls of tomato sauce, 2 table-spoonfuls of mushroom ketchup. Mode : Dredge the meat with flour, and roast or bake it for three-quarters of an hour; it should acquire a nice brown colour. Put the meat into a stewpan, with the carrots, onions, potatoes, herbs, pepper, salt; pour over it sufficient boiling water to cover it, and stew gently for two hours. Take out the meat and herbs, put it in a deep dish, skim off all the fat from the gravy, and flavour it with lemon- juice, tomato sauce, and mushroom ketchup in the above proportion. Have ready a pint of green peas boiled separately ; put these with the meat, pour over it the gravy, and serve. The dish may be garnished with a few forcemeat-balls. The meat, when preferred, may be cut into chops, and floured and fried instead of being roasted, and any part of veal dressed in this way will be found extremely savoury and 4.

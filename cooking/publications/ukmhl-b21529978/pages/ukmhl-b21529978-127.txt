Cod Pie.—Take a piece of the middle of a small cod, and salt it well one night; next day wash it, season with pepper, salt, and a very little nutmeg mixed; place in a dish, and put some butter on it, and a little good broth of any sort into the dish; cover it with a crust; and when done, add a sauce of a spoonful of broth, ^ pint of cream, a little flour and butter, a grate of lemon and nutmeg, and give it one boil; oysters may be added. 2. Oxheart. This joint is as good baked as roasted. It is not an aristocratic joint; but if well prepared and served, it is a very cheap and savoury dish. Soak the heart for an hour in hot water, having removed the lobes; then wipe it very dry. Make a forcemeat as for veal, or onions, with a few bread-crumbs added. Fill the heart with the stuffing, and sew it up. Cover with larded paper, and roast or bake for two hours, keeping it well basted. .Servp

6 Oh ! Thou whose merciful decree Hast knit our hearts in bonds of lovCj Our sure defence and safeguard be, Whate’er our wedded lot may prove. Without Thy blessing love is vain, The varied ills of life to bear; But when bestowed, few griefs remain Beyond affection’s healing care. Avert from us the spirit’s chill. Each wand’ring thought and fickle mood j Mould every feeling to Thy will, Incline our hearts to every good. Implanting deep that perfect trust. Of love’s rich soil the flower most dear ; Turn all our promised joys to dust. But leave that root unwithered here. Blend with our love that gentleness Which turns each angry word aside, Which stifles wrath with tenderness. And melts away the frost of pride.

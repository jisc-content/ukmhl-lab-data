I Soup Lorraine.—up a lb. of blanched almonds in a mortar, with a small quantity of water ; add to this the yolks of 4 eggs boiled hard and the white meat of a cold roast fowl. Pound these ingredients well’together, seasoning with salt, mace, and nutmeg to your taste. Let the above be boiled over a slow fire in 3 quarts of strong veal broth, perfectly free from fat. This soup is fit for table when it has attained the thickness of cream. 2.

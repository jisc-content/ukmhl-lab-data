Fish must be put into cold or boiling water according to its firmness of flesh : for instance, turbot, salmon, mackerel, etc., should be put into cold water; while plaice, whitings, haddocks, and such soft-fleshed, as Avell as crimped fish, should be put into boiling water. The reason is obvious: by putting flaccid and watery fish into the water cold, it is rendered still more soft and watery; but the boiling water sets it, and renders it firmer. On the other hand, the cold water penetrates and softens the fish that is of a firmer texture, and makes it eat more tender and delicate. Keep the water skimmed while the fish is boiling. Fish is cooked enough when it leaves the bone easily. Be sure to wash and clean your fish well, never trusting to the fishmonger. In frying fish, having washed it, dry it thoroughly in a clean cloth; then flour it well, or whisk it over with egg, and dip it into bread-crumbs before frying it. Be sure your pan is very clean, and that your fat (of which there should be enough to cover the fish) boils before you put the fish in. Fry fish quickly, of a fine light brown. Some like fish fried m batter—as good a batter as any, is a little ale and flour beaten up just as you are ready for it; then dip the fish in before frying it. Put plenty of salt in the water in which you boil fish, and a stick of horse- radish, excepting mackerel, with which you boil salt, mint, parslev or fennel. FISH SEASONS. The cod-fish comes in September, and disappears in March.

HINTS FOR THE ANGELS OF OUR HOUSEHOLD, CHIEFLY AS TOUCHING DEPORTMENT AND CONDITION IN LIFE. ‘ Learn to be wise and practise how to thrive: That I woidd have thee do ; and not to spend Your coin on every bauble that you fancy. Or every foolish brain that humours you ; I would not have you to invade each place. Nor thrust yourself on all societies. Till men's affections, or your own desert. Should worthily invite you to your rank. Nor would I you should melt away yourself In flashing bravery, lest while you affect To make a blaze of gentry to the world, A Utile puff of scorn extinguish it. And you be left with an unsavoury snuff. Whose property is only to offend. Moderate your expenses now at first, As you may keep the same proportion still j Nor stand so much on your gentility. Which is an airy and mere borrowed thing. From dead men's dust and bones, and none of yours. Except you make of hold it.'—Ben Jonson. HAVE AN OBJECT IN LIFE. Some high or humble enterprise of good Contemplate, till it shall possess thy mind, Become thy study, pastime, rest, and food. And kindle in thy heart a flame refined. Pray heaven for firmness, thy whole soul to bind To this thy purpose,—to begin, pursue, With thoughts all fixed, and feelings purely kind j Strength to complete, and with delight review, And grace to give the praise where all is ever due. 608

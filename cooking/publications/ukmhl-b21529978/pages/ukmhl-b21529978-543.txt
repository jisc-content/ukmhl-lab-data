GUIDE FOR PRAYER, ETC. 535 Suspicion lurks not in her artless breast; The worse suggested, she believes the best; Not soon provok’d, however stung and teas’d; And if perhaps made angry, soon appeas’d : She rather waves than will dispute her right. And injured, makes forgiveness her delight—Cowper. Oh ! teach us, yet unspoil’d by wealth, That secret race, between the extremes to move. Of mad good-nature, and of mean self-love.—Pope. Soft-ey’d pity and forgiveness bland. And melting charity with open hand; And mercy stretching out ere want can speak. To wipe the tear which stains affliction’s cheek. —Hannah More. Her hand, the agent of her heart—Shakspeare. * Earth has nothing more tender than a woman’s heart, when it is the abode of piety.’—Luther. Oh, Charity ! our helpless nature’s pride, ihou friend to him who knows no friend beside. Is there in morning’s breath, or the sweet gale That steals o’er the tired pilgrim of the vale. Cheering with fragrance fresh his wearied frame, Aught like the influence of thy holy frame ? Is aught in all the beauties that adorn The azure heaven, or purple lights of morn— Is aught so fair in evening’s lingering gleam, As from thine eye the meek but pensive beam. That falls like saddest moonlight on the hill And distant woods, when the wide world is still ? Thine are the ample views that, unconfined. Stretch to the utmost walks of human kind; Thine is the spirit, that, with widest plan. Brother to brother binds, and man to man. — William Lisle Bowles. The greatest object in the universe is a Christian struggling with ad- versity; yet there is still a greater—the one who comes to relieve it O. Goldsmith.

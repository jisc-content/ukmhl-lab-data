CONFECTIONERY, CAKES, AND PRESERVES, VERY kind of preserve should be made in a copper or brass preserving-pan (uncovered); it must be scrupulously clean and bright inside. The pots or bottles must be sound, and perfectly clean and dry. Pots should be filled within a quarter of an inch of the top, and bottles just above the shoulder. The following day they must be closely covered with strong cap paper (thin whitey brown), which must be made to adhere round the edge, and then brushed over with the white of an egg, so as to exclude the air. Each pot should be written upon, to show its contents and date of making. Fruit for jellies and jams must be quite ripe and fresh, and gathered in dry weather; in such case the preserves cannot fail to be good, and the cost is something less than half that paid for those ready bought. It may be well to know that the weight is reduced about one-third in making, and also that lb. pots only hold 13 oz., and ^ lb. pots 7 oz. Gather the fruit when it is dry. Do not boil the fruit too long, as that hardens it; pour boiling water over the sieves used. Let the pots and jars containing fresh-made s\teets remain uncovered for t^\'o days, then soak a split bladder and tie it tightly over the top; in drjnng, it will shrink to the net, and render the latter perfectly air-tight. Keep preserves in a dry, but not in a warm place. Be sure to use sufficient sugar; this, with keeping them air-tight, is the only way to avoid the risk of their spoiling. To clarify Sugar for Sweetmeats.—For each lb. of sugar allow ^ a pint of water, and for every 3 lbs., allow the white of an egg. ^ Mix when cold, boil a few minutes, and skim it; let it stand ten minutes, then skim it again, and strain it * As when sojne skilful cook, to please each guest. Would in one mixture comprehend a feast. With diceprroportion, andjudicious care.’—Pope. 4G0

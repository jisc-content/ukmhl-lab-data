SUPPERS. 429 ’ ‘ To know the palates And several tastes of the time.’—Ben Jonson. Hot suppers are not healthy, but occasionally such things are taken, and without evil consequences ; but, as a rule, I should recommend light suppers, and have therefore given some dishes, with an eye to what has been left at dinner, with a few additions.

Frangipane.—Beat up 6 eggs, and add 2 spoonfuls of flour, a spoonful of grated lemon-peel, another of powdered sugar, a • table-spoonful of orange-flour water, and half a dozen macaroons broken up; put these and a pint of milk into a stewpan over a slow fire, stir it well for twenty minutes; have ready some pattypans lined with puff paste; pour in the ingredients, and bake for twenty minutes. To Boil Tripe.—Wash it clean, and put it on to boil in plenty of water, with 4 or 6 moderately-sized onions. When the onions are quite soft, the tripe will be boiled enough. Serve it with the onions in a hash-dish, with a little of the liquor in which it has been boiled

Christinas Pudding.—i lb. of suet, i lb. of bread, i lb. of currants, i lb. of raisins stoned and a little cut, the rind of half a lemon shred as fine as possible, ^ lb. of sugar, 6 Jamaica peppers in fine powder, 8 eggs, take out 4 whites, a glass of brandy, a little salt, and as little milk as will make it of a proper consistence. Boil it in a floured cloth, or a melon-mould, eight or nine hours. This pudding will keep, after it has been boiled, six months, if kept tied up in the same cloth and hung up, folded in a sheet of cap paper to pre- serve it from dust, being first cold. When to be used, it must boil a full hour. 8. Sauce to ditto.—lx\\.o ^ pint of thick melted butter put a table- spoonful of powdered sugar, a quarter of a nutmeg grated, a tea-spoon- ful of lemon syrup, 2 glasses of Madeira, and i of Cura5oa; stir all well together, and pour it quite hot over the pudding. 9. Syllabubs.—7 oz. of fine sugar, and rasp on it the rinds of two fresh, large, sound lemons; then pound or roll it to powder and put it into a bowl with the strained juice of the lemons, 2 large glasses of sherry, and 2 of brandy; when the sugar is dissolved, add a pint of fresh cream, and whisk or mill the mixture well; take off the froth as it rises and put it into glasses. These syllabubs should always be made twenty-four hours before they are wanted, and will remain good for days. The full flavour of the lemon-rind is obtained with less trouble than in rasping, by paring it very thin indeed, and infusing it for some hours in the juice of the fruit. These proportions are sufficient for 2 dozen or more of syllabubs. DECEMBER 2 0. ‘ Virtue is hold, and goodness never fearfid.'—Shakspeare. 1. Gravy Soup. 2. Roast Leg of Pork. 3. Snow Pancakes. 4.

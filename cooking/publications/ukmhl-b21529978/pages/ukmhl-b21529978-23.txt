15 PRELUDE OF MOTTOES. * Silence and a chaste resen'e Is woman's genuine praise, and to remain Quiet within the house.'—Euripides, ' In person decent, and in dress. Her manners and her words express The purity of mind ; Good humour brightens up her face. Where passion never leaves a trace. Nor frows a look unkind ; No vexing sneer, no angry word. No scandal from her lips is heard. Where truth and sweetness blend. Submissive to her husband's will. Her study is to please him still. His fond and faithful friend. She watches his returning way. When from the troubles of the day He seeks an hour of bliss : She runs to meet him with a smile. And if no eye be near awhile. The smile is with a kiss.'—Anon. ‘Let no man value at a little price a virtuous woman's counsel.'—George Chap.man. The modest virgin, the prudent wife, or the careful matron, are much more serviceable in life than petticoated philosophers, blustering heroines, or virago queens.'— Goldsmith. ‘ Th affection warm, the temper mild. The sweetness that in sorrow smiled ; The cheek where beauty glowed. The heart where goodness overflowed.'—LoGAN. Oh, what makes woman lovely ? Virtue, faith. And gentleness in suffering ; an endurance Through scorn or trial: these call beauty forth. Give it the stamp celestial, and admit it To sisterhood with angels !'—Brent. ‘Gently entreating, and sweetly beguiling, Woman reigns while the graces around her are smiling. Calming down the fierce discord of hatred and pride.'—Schiller. ‘ Thy soft hand, amid the maze 01 ill, , Can rear one blissful bower of Eden’still.'—Beresford. Fair ladies I you drop manna in the way of starved people.'-Shakspearf. ' Well thou play'dst the housewife's part, And all thy threads with magic art Have wound themselves about this heart. My Mary 1'—Covvper.

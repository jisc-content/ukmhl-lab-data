496 THE GARDEN, AND GARDENING. WHAT a wondrous thing is vegetation! Take a trowel full of earth, and' look attentively at it. There does not seem any- thing creative or sustaining about the black mass ; yet put the bulb of a lily into this bit of earth, and see what it shall develope with the aid of the sun, the shower, and the atmosphere,—a thing so beautiful, that Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these. And so we cannot wonder at a garden being a spot of earth made peculiar ground; for it is full of sweet wonders, and of the smiles of God’s good- ness, which flowers are so truly said to resemble. And again, it soothes the mind with a balm fresh from Eden, and renovates the soul and glad- dens the eye. I do not think I ever knew any one who rejoiced in a garden who was a sour-complexioned soul. God Almighty placed man in a garden in the first blessed state of his being, and walked therein with him; and it can be so again, though not continuously as then; but we can still snatch a few hours of calm enjoyment from the turmoil of life, and delve amidst the beauties of flower-life,—^working thus far in har- mony with Him who hath clothed the hills with verdure, and strewed about our pathway the blooming reminiscences of the better land. The following instructions are culled from the excellent little manual of Mr. Carter, of the well-known firm of Messrs. James Carter, Dunnett, and Beale, of 237 and 238 High Holborn, W.C., to whom I can con- fidently recommend my readers for all matters appertaining to garden culture, the purchase of seeds, etc.:— JANUARY. Where there is the convenience of a vinery at work, commence about the last week in the month to pot off" from the store pots the plants intended for bedding out, beginning with scarlet geraniums and other free-rooting varieties, leaving verbenas and other more tender bedders

BISCUITS A LA CANELLE, Beat the whites and yolks of 12 eggs until they form a sblid froth; add a tea-cupful of orange-flower, rose, or laurel water, half an ounce of very finely-beaten cinnamon, a pound and a half of powdered and sifted loaf sugar, and sufficient potato-flour to make it into a paste. Roll it out rather thin; stamp it into biscuits of a fanciful form ; put them upon greased paper; place them in a moderate oven, and, when done and become cold, glaze them highly, and return them to the mouth of the oven for a short time to set. 9. GELEE DE BAR. Take 2 quarts of fine ripe currants, red or white; cut them gently from their stalks with a pair of scissors, and carefully extract the pips with a quill. Have ready a pound and a half of loaf sugar boiled with water to a strong syrup; throw in your fruit, skim well, and boil for ten minutes. 10. MARMELADE DE POIRES.

The pears may be slowly baked instead of being boiled, if more convenient.

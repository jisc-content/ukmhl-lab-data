PREFACE. 8 the pleasantness and completeness of things in any household, and in particular, in one of that large and important middle class, the comfort and well-being of which cannot be too earnestly desired. May I venture to suggest, especially to the young Mistress who has newly entered upon the responsibilities of that home-sphere in which woman’s mission is mainly to be found, and where it may be most gracefully fulfilled, that a wise economy and management of things will tend, with God’s blessing, to secure the permanent happiness of the little kingdom in which she reigns, and light up with the brightness of content and satisfaction the face she most loves to see. My wish is, that she should not feel those responsibilities so heavily as to oppress her with care; and with my manual as her daily companion, I am inclined to believe that she will feel her burden greatly lightened. I have striven not to overcrowd my pages, as that would bewilder rather than direct The Lady whom I am addressing is doubtless intellectual and accomplished; she will therefore understand that the mind requires a good substratum of physical nourishment, and will also be able to appreciate the apt and wise words of the lamented Rev. F. W. Robert- son, of Brighton : ‘ The glory of womanhood is no common glory; it is that of unsensualizing coarse and common things, the objects of mere sense, meat and drink and household cares,—elevating them by the spirit in which she ministers them into something transfigimed and sublime.’ HENRY SOUTHGATE. Woodbine, Sidmoutii Devon.

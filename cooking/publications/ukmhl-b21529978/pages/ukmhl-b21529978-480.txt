Then pour it out, and, when it is quite cold, mix wth it, by degrees, the strained juice of two moderate-sized and very fresh lemons. Take a J lb. of macaroons; cover the bottom of a glass dish with a portion of them ; pour in a part of the cream; lay the remainder of the macaroons upon it \ add the rest of the cream, and ornament it with candied citron sliced thin. The requisite flavour should be given to this dish by infusing in the cream the very thin rind of a lemon, and part of a stick of cinnamon slightly bruised, and then straining it before the flour is added; or, these and the sugar may be boiled together, with 2 or 3 spoonfuls of water, to a strongly-flavoured syrup, which, after having been passed through a muslin strainer, may be stirred into the cream. It is very delicious, flavoured with vanilla instead of lemon and maraschino.

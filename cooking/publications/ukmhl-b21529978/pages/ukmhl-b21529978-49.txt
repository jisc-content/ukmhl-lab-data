Scotch Broth.—Take a neck of mutton, with the fat raised from off the best end. Cut off the scrag end, and divide it into several pieces to make the broth. Let it boil gently a couple of hours, skimming well. Then add sliced carrots, onions, turnips, celery, a sprig of parsley, pepper and salt, a tea-spoonful of split peas, and six table- spoonfuls of pearl barley, both previously steeped in tepid water. 4. Cmllars.—Rub 6 oz. of butter with ground nutmeg to taste into J lb. of sifted sugar; beat 4 eggs, whites and yolks separately; add i-|- lbs. of flour, and make into a light paste; roll it into a sheet half an inch thick, cut it into long narrow strips, twist them into fanciful forms, and fry them of a light brown in lard. Care must be taken to put them into the lard when boiling, and a deep pan full of the fat be used, or the crullars will be greasy. ‘ The true philosopher's stone is to have means, and 7iot to spend mjudiciously.'

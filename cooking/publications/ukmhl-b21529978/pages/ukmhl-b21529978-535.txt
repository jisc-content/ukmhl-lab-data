}TINTS FOR DEPORTMENT, ETC. 5-7 habit of being employed. Never err the least in truth. Never say an ill thing of a person when thou canst say a good thing of her; not only speak charitably, but feel so. Never be irritable or unkind to anybody. Never indulge thyself in luxuries that are not necessaries. Do all things with consideration; and when thy path to act right is most difficult, feel confident in that power alone which is able to assist thee, and exert thy own powers as far as they go.—Mrs. Elizabeth Fry. VISITING. If we engage into a large acquaintance and various familiarities, we set open our gates to the invaders of most of our time; we expose our life to a quotidian ague of frigid impertinences, which would make a wise woman tremble to think of.—Cowley. IMPORTANT. When your child is sent to school, be careful to stipulate that a chair be provided for it to sit upon, instead of that instrument of torture, a form. More young girls suffer from weakness in their backs from this cause than any other; and from the neglect of a little cafe in early life being bestowed on this subject, they are frequently made miserable for the remainder of their days. If all mothers insist upon this, forms will be abolished, and the next generation will bless you.

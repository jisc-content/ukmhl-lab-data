480 DRESS, AND VARIOUS OTHER HINTS CONNECTED WITH THE TOILET. —♦— ■ ‘ Know, she that in her dress reveals A fine and modest taste, displays More loveliness than she conceals. ’—Patmore, Dress indicates mind; and a favourable or unfavourable impres- sion is made according to the appearance presented by every lady. Rightly considered, it is a study, and well worthy of being so, if not carried to excess. Women by nature are beautiful and graceful; and there is no reason why they should disfigure themselves by extremes in any mode that may prevail; and yet there is every good reason why a lady should be up in all that pertains to the toilet, and not to be behind in that peculiar finish and tone so characteristic of the refined woman. To this end her dress must be easy; there must be no restraint. Anything that constrains and hinders the intensely natural gracefulness of woman is in bad taste. This is as true in regard to the clothing of the body as it is to the education of the mind. Life, health, reason, and convenience ought to be the first consideration. Graceful- ness cannot exist without ease ; delicacy is not debility; and a sound taste in dress is the fair and beautiful right of woman.

The doctor rebukes his fellow citizens as careless eaters, who have the same greasy and carbonaceous food North and South, in winter and summer. This is surely rational enough. He who is about to spend a July morning listening to a sermon, cannot recpiire the breakfast of baked beans and fat pork, which is needful to the wood-sawyer in January: yet the attendant at church takes the overdose, while the danger is that the wood-sawyer, to whom it is a neces- sity, cannot get within reach of it. The doctor is a humorous narrator of his experience—putting his argument as to the fitness of food so that it shall strike home. As,— “Is your fat, good-natured old grandfather living on fat beef and pork, white bread and butter, buckwheat cakes and molasses, rice and sugar, till he has lost all mental and physical energy, and desires to sit from morning till night in the chimney-corner or at the register, saying nothing and caring for nothing?— change his diet, give him fish, beefsteak, potatoes, and unbolted wheat bread, or rye and Indian, with one half or three quarters of the carboniferous articles of his former diet, and in one week he will cheer you again with his old jokes, and call for his hat and cane.” M

The Scrap Book. . 169 Edible Spring Fungi. “ I have observed a non-deliquescent, black-spored Agaric [Agaricits phloenarum, Bull), which seems very nearly to coincide with Berkeley’s description of Panaolus separatus, cropping up in immense quantities from a seakale bed in this neighbourhood. The bed is made with sawdust used for littering a stable, and the portions bearing the fungi are exposed to the air, with little or no internal heat. The soft delicate biscuit-brown colour, and the abundance and not unwholesome smell of the specimens, inclined me to experi- ment upon their edible qualities—cautiously enough at first— for I hold the maxim, “consider every one a rogue until he proves himself a true man,” applicable to the Toadstool family. Having, however, at last consumed some consider- able quantities—say a dozen or so at a time—without the slightest inconvenience, I venture to recommend the variety to your readers, not by any means as equal to the autumn kinds, but as a wholesome and delicately-flavoured substi- tute during the interregnum of the tribe. Freshly-gathered and undecayed specimens should be selected for the frying- pan, sliced with the usual accompaniments, and removed the instant they become soft and dark coloured. Whilst on the subject of Fungi, I may as well add that I have found the following an easy and useful way of preserving the spores, and autographing to a certain extent the shape and juxtaposition of the gills. I place a piece of gummed paper (white, drab, or black, in reverse of the expected colour of the deposit) in a damp place (a box with a wet sponge in it will do in summer), until it has become sticky and relaxed in texture. I then lay the cap, gills downward, upon it, as usually directed, not allowing it to remain too long, and when the specimens are removed, and the paper dried, I have a fixed and indelible impression for future reference.

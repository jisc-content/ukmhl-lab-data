IOI Wine Notes. we congratulated him on the produce of this year’s vintage. “Yes,” he exclaimed, “ it is truly marvellous, and, what is even better, the quantity of wine will not only be far in excess of the annual average (250 hogs- heads) ; but it will be of a very superior quality.” And how transcendently delicious is the prime cm of the Clos de Vougeot you will not soon forget, if you have the good fortune to be favoured, as we were, with a “tasting order.” It requires at least ten years to develop the exquisite flavour and aroma of this wine ; but many thousand bottles which we saw in the cellars contain wine far older than this. On leaving the cellars we went over the convent, the vast but empty rooms of which on the first story still contain grand chimney-pieces and fine specimens of stone-carving. And when we had seen all noteworthy in the building, M. Roux turned us into the Clos, where, said he, you may do as you please ; which meant that we were at liberty to feast on the luscious grapes which hung temptingly from every vine.

The Seasons and Season Menus. 43 the pan. In a Paris menu of this month I observe the ringdove, ramereaux marine's et frits. A gastronomic writer wonders why Augustus and Julius Caesar gave their names to the two most un- grateful epicurean months in the whole year. He wants to know what there can possibly be in common between the protector of Virgil and Horace and the conqueror of Spain and Gaul, and sucking-pigs, leverets, young rabbits, and partridges. I confess that the relation does not “jump to the eyes.” The remark of Louis XV. discovers at once, on the other hand, a royal perception of the epicurean weakness of the time, and a selfish content in getting over it in the most comfortable way possible, which mark his place in the season. Seeing the slaughter of the young rabbits and hares (which are insipid now, but would be full of generous flavour if left another month or so of life), his majesty exclaimed, “ They will last my time. But our sons, will there be any game for them to eat ! ” The protest against the destruction of leverets, lamb, and sucking-pigs, has been made repeatedly during the last fifty years. In vain is the consumer of the sucking-pig apostrophised. “Had you waited, the little creature whom you are now devouring in white chumps, as the cunning Muscovite serves it, or in the English mannei, as Charles Lamb loved it, the perfect pig would have given you two delicious hams, a Imre, a tongue, trotters with truffles, and sweet blankets of bacon for your little birds.” But in vain. The reck- less epicure discounts all for crackling !

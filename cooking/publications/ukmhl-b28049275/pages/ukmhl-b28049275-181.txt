Histoire de la Table. 153 a-year. Seneca laments, “No more literary studies. Neglected professors yawn in their deserted schools. In the rooms of the rhetorician and the philosopher, the solitude is complete. But, see the crowds in the kitchens ! Youths in hosts besiege the ovens of the dissipated ! ” The Sybarites, who gave the inventor of a dish a patent right over it fora year ; Heliogabalus ; Apicius, who discovered how to keep oysters fresh, and him of the ragouts and cakes; Caligula and Vitellius ; Caracalla as a pieman ;—these are beads on the his- torian’s string. “Observe,” remarks Juvenal, “their tastes lay all the elements under contribution. No price frightens them. The dearest thing is that which flatters them the most.” The superfluous has become the indispensable, is Seneca’s comment. “We have reached so high a point of delicacy, that we will walk only upon precious stones ! ” There was a sound idea of the fitness of things in the arrangement of Lucullus, •who had dining-rooms prepared according to the banquets to be given in them. In the Hall of Apollo the feasts always cost one thousand pounds. M. Nicolardot is full of anecdote. His collection is not a history, but consists of most entertaining and valuable memoires pour servir; a kind of compilation in which our good, neighbours excel.

174 The Epicure's Year Book. Favre. M. de Pontmartin described the two orations in the Gazette de France: “A gourmet’s dinner after a table d’hote feed.” M. Glais Bizoin was equally happy. Pie said of the sententious solemnity of M. Malezieux, in the tribune: “Pie spreads a table cloth to crack a nut. ” FRUIT-PRESERVING HOUSES. The effect of Mr. Nyce’s Fruit-Preserving Houses is already apparent to the citizens of New York—to their great delight. “Duchesse,” according to “Putnam’s Magazine,” “and all the finer varieties of late pears, are now offered for sale every day in the shops, and are become a regular part of the dessert at all the great hotels. Indeed, they are so reasonable in price—ten cents will buy a veiy good pear, a Duchesse, a Winter Nelis, a Glout Morceau, that a year ago would have cost a dollar, and would not have been easy to buy even at that price—that they are to be found on many modest tables. Nor is this all. Catawba grapes, in excellent condition, are brought out of the New York Preserving House daily, and the finer varieties of grapes ripened last fall in cold graperies. Professor Nyce is an enthusiast, and perhaps believes that his invention will do more than it will be found able to accomplish ; but it has thus far done all that he has demanded of it. His theory is that, by keeping fruit in a very cold and even temperature, employing certain disinfectants and appliances to absorb all moisture, and admitting no ray of light, he can arrest the process of ripening, and keep the life of the fruit, so to speak, in absolute suspense. If this can be done practically, we do not see why one fruit should not be as well preserved as another; why we should not be eating peaches to-day as well as these delightful Catawbas.”

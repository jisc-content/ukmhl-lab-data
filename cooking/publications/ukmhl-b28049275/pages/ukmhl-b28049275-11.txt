Preface. Vll the original Year Book have undergone the most careful revision. It should be understood that the Epicure’s Year Book is a Gastronomic Annual—as the British Almanac and Companion to the Almanac are year books. The plan alone remains from year to year : the matter shifts with the circling of the seasons. The difficulty with which Fin-Bec has to contend is the rejection of good material. He is assailed with menus of the great feasts of the year. Inventors of new dishes and new condiments; importers of unknown vintages ; creators of new provision trades; gastronomic authorities on the table-arts, besiege him, bespeaking his attention. The object of this Year Book is to keep the gastronomic world informed on the epicurean events of the year, and to chronicle the progress of the art which should “ satisfy the exquisite taste of Alcibiades, without wounding the proud austerity of Lycurgus.” With the experience of each succeeding season Fin-Bec hopes to make his Year Book more and still more acceptable to his readers.

Lcs Soupeurs de moil Temps. *57 LES SOUPEURS DE MON TEMPS.* When the Golden Youth of 1830 were opening the Romantic School’s steady, unrelenting war against the Academicians—about the time poor dear old Viennet (who has gone to his rest, at length, this year) was at the height of his popularity, Roger de Beauvoir ap- peared on the scene, and made himself welcome to Dumas, and Mery, Champagne, Bouffd, Briffault, and the rest of the laughing band, who wreathed their pens with the vine, and drew inspiration from Epernay and Rheims, and Perigueux, and Strasbourg, and were the life and soul of the Provcngal brothers, and Vdry, and the Cafe Anglais, in Delaunay’s days.

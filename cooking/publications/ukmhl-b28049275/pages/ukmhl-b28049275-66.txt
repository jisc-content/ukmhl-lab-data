The doctor’s researches led to these - positive discoveries. “ The British species of this im- portant' group are the herring, the sprat, the pilchard (which is identical with the sardines of the French coast), and the two species of shad. These species are generally distinguished one from the other by the number of their vertebra;, and that of their scales, the relative positions of the fins, and those of their teeth.” One of the most important results which Dr. Giinther now brings forward is, according to his observations, the absolute identity of the whitebait and the herring. Let the epicure bear this in mind. The Doctor, in his “ Catalogue of Fishes in the British Museum,” calls the whitebait a purely fanciful species, “introduced into science in deference to the opinion of fishermen and gourmands.” Whereat the editor of the “ Sci- entific Review” grows exceedingly angry, and frightens

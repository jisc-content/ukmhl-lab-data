Our Cellar. 83 BURGUNDY. I am delighted to see that Mr. Beckwith is just to a favourite wine of mine—often neglected—Moulin-h- Vent, “ a very delicate grape from the department of the Saone-et-Loire.” Of Burgundy, our cellar-guide says some good things. His observation on the multitudinous divisions and subdivisions adopted by the French in their classification of Burgundy, is excellent. It is a French weakness. They would classify a spoonful of peas. But their love of order— in the vineyard and the cellar—is a refinement over- refined ; while the obtuseness of the Portuguese, who calls all his red wines, and not a little of his elder- berry, “ port,” is coarse and ignorant. We take the broad distinctions. Of the glorious grape we have Romande-conti, Clos-vougeot, Cham- bertin, Richebourg, La Tache, Corton, Beaune, Volnay, and Pomard. Then come the white wines, Mont- Rachet,* Meursault, and Chablis. Macon and Beau- jolais, follow in the rear of their masters : honest, rough, sound fellows, fit for everyday acquaintance. In Mr. Beckwith, Burgundy finds an intrepid cham- pion. Burgundy has been denounced as gouty, apoplectic, and a destroyer of the nerves. “ I am satisfied,” says the government reporter, “ that, were Burgundy taken on its merits, and treated with fair- ness, were it imbibed in moderation at dinner, and not after, its unpleasant repute as a heater of the blood, * t^hich some critics declare to be the finest of white French wines. —Beckwith.

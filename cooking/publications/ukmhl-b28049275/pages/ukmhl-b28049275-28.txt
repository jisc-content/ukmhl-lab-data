“ I, gentle readers, have set before you a table liberally spread. It is not expected or desired that every dish should suit the palate of all the guests; but every guest will find something that he likes. You, madam, may prefer the boiled chicken with stewed celery, or a little of that frican- deau ; the lady opposite will send her plate for some pigeon- pie. The Doctor has an eye upon the venison—and so, I see, has the Captain. Sir, I have not forgotten that this is one of your fast days ; I am glad, therefore, that the turbot proves so good,—and that dish has been prepared for you. Sir John, there is garlic in the fricassee. The Hungarian wine has a bitterness which everybody may not like; the ladies will probably prefer Malmsey. The Captain sticks to his port, and the Doctor to his Madeira. There is a splendid trifle for the young folks, which some of the elders may not despise ; and I only wish my garden could have furnished a better dessert,—but, considering climate, it is not amiss. Is not this entertainment better than if I had set you all down to a round of beef and turnips?”—Southey’s “Doctor.”

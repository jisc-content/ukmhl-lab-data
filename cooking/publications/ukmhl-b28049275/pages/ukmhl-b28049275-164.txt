The Epicures Year Book. 136 I was led to the consideration of the radical defects in English picnics, by a conversation that happened early last spring, on bachelors’ receptions. A Temple man was besieged by his female relatives. They insisted that he should show them the church and the grave of poor Goldy, and afterwards entertain them to lunch in his chambers.

There was not time to study a menu, but just to show my friend what could be done in a bachelor’s lodgings, with merely a fire and an intelligent woman to wait, I threw together the following whimsical bill of fare, and I called it (for all was carried to the Temple packed in tins, as it might be carried to Timbuctoo), Potted Luck.

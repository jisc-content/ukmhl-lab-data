The Epicure's Year Book. 154 BREAKFAST, DINNER, AND TEA.* We have no book in which the art, the classics, and the poetry of gastronomy, is treated lightly, brightly, and learnedly, as in this handsome volume, which has reached me from the other side of the Atlantic. It is not a work of yesterday, but it is new in England. It is not an original book, but it is a patient compilation made by a refined, scholarly, and delicately appreciative mind. It is designed for ladies who, like Dr. Johnson’s Mrs. Carter, can “both translate Epictetus and make a pudding; and write a Greek poem as well as em- broider a handkerchief.” The class is not large, I fear, just now, for if the female translators of Epictetus have increased in numbers vastly since the doctor’s time, the makers of puddings have steadily decreased. “ It must surely,” the author says, “ be a matter of interest, while preparing dishes to gratify the palates of the present generation, to notice what have pleased poets and philosophers, and races long past away, as well as to remark the great diversity of tastes, among the various nations now existing on the earth.” The “ three hundred original receipts of a practical nature ” with which the volume is garnished, are furnished forth with abundance of gastronomic anecdote and history. The chapter on breakfasts is in Leigh Hunt’s manner, travelling from Izaak Walton on the angler’s breakfast, to N. P. Willis, Mrs. Stowe, and Lord Macaulay’s * “ Breakfast, Dinner, and Tea: viewed Classically, Poetically, and Practically." D. Appleton. New York. *

The Scrap Book. 167 Who are the Frog-Eaters? The consumption of frogs is not now, as formerly, confined to the French. An English paper, the Athenceum, recently came out (i860) in favour of frogs. “ There is no reason,” it remarks, “why we should eschew frogs, and relish turtle.” They are eaten to a considerable extent by Americans ; and frogs command a high price in the New York market. “ In America, the flesh of the huge bull-frog is tender, white, and affords excellent eating. Some bull-frogs weigh as much as half-a-pound, but the hind legs are the only parts used as food.” The green, or edible frog, is in high request on the Continent of Europe, being delicate and well-tasted. In Vienna, where the consumption of these frogs is very con- siderable, they are preserved alive, and fattened in frog- geries (grenouillieres) constructed for the express purpose. To cook frogs: Take the hind legs of a young frog, skin them, wash, and fry them in butter ; or broil them. They are as delicate as the breast of a chicken. Queen Elizabeth, out of compliment to her royal French suitor, the Due d’Alenin, cherished the jewelled similitude of a frog in her bosom, in the form of a brooch.—Breakfast, Dinner, and Tea.

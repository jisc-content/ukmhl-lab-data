87 Our Cellar. an analysis of a bouquet, is enough to make an old connoisseur tremble. A combination of raspberries and violets is the hint Mr. Beckwith throws out, timidly. Try to describe the loveliest woman your imagination has ever approached. Endeavour after words that shall present to the sense the perfume of the rose, the fragrance of a bed of thyme; master in a written page the full flavour of the peach ; and your “ ’prentice hand ” may turn to your Bordeaux bins. Mr. Beckwith says, of Bordeaux, “ The body is round, fruity, and soft as satin; and all the compo- nents are so happily blended into a homogeneous whole,-that, during the ‘ degustation ’ of good Claret, all the senses seem to be simultaneously gratified. It is not, however, merely as a Sybaritic luxury, that 1 would wish Claret to be known. Higher praise may be accorded to it as one of the most refreshing, the most cooling, and the most invigorating of beverages, easy of digestion, and even assisting that process. A mildly stimulating and inebriating drink, in every way fulfilling its scriptural character as a ‘wine that maketh glad the heart of man.’ Commencing at as low a price as one shilling a gallon, the finest growths in their crude state may rule as high as twenty-five shillings.” I must not forget the white wines of Sauterne, as Latour, Blanche, and chief of all—Cha- teau-d’Yquem. Made in good condition, these wines are, as Mr. Beckwith describes them, exquisitely dulcet and delicate. The light wines of the Grave district are, to my mind, most welcome hot-day crus. * ^ ~ ~~

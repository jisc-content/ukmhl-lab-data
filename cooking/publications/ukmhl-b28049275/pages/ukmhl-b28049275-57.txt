The Seasons and Season Menus. 29 soles, lobster, and oysters ; foie-gras, asparagus, the two artichokes, peas, and spinach are the main ele- ments of the April menu. The gdlinottes are still a favourite roast. Soups, say,—consommd printanier, aux profiteroles, aux quenelles et pointes d’asperges, or duchesse. Turbot sauce genevoise, or aux huitres, or salmon, or sole parisienne or Joinville. Beef, sauce Robert, or Godard ; Welsh or Southdown mutton. A supreme de volaille, Pdrigord ; epi- grammes of lamb, Macedoine ! Lobster mayonnaise, by all means—both lobster and salad are in perfec- tion. A gigot aux laitues; a chaufroix of snipe. Asparagus flamande, or au beurre: or haricots verts h. la poulette, or artichokes lyonnaise, or h l’italienne, or again spinach, au sucre—an excellent vegetable, the doctors say, in the spring. In the way of douceurs, there is not much to add to the resources of last month. The early gooseberry and the fresh rhubarb are our national spring fruit riches—with the green currant we so strangely neglect, and of which our neighbours are totally oblivious. An American author of a literary work on gastro- nomy,* says, “Jelly can be made of green currants in the same manner as from the ripe ones. To give it a fine colour, stain it with strawberry juice ; it is nice of its own colour, but not equally handsome. This jelly is said to be delicious.” The author writes only on hearsay; I speak with experience. It is delicious— * “Breakfast, Dinner, and Tea," &c. New York. (See “Re- views.”)

These prepare me for a diet, not gluttonous, but medicinal; the palate may not be pleased, but the stomach, nor that for its own sake ; neither would I think any of these comforts worth respect in themselves, but in their use, in their end, so far as they may enable me to better things. If I see any dish to tempt my palate, I fear a serpent in that apple, and would please myself in a wilful denial; I rise capable of more, not desirous; not now immediately from my trencher to my book, but after some intermission.”—Bishop Hall. Lady Blessington at Table. The soup vanished in the busy silence that beseems it, and as the courses commenced their procession, Lady Bles- sington led the conversation with the brilliancy and ease for which she is remarkable over all the women of her time.

Hare-liver has, however, been one of the gastro- nomic excitements of the past year.

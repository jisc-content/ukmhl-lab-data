The Cosmopolitan Cook. 145 great Spanish entertainments. “ I admit,” M. Dubois observes, “ that I have never prepared it myself, but I have tasted it in Spain, and found it better than I had supposed it could be.” In this dish are beef, pork,* ham, fowls, pigeons, partridges, and rabbits ; eels, snails ; artichokes, peas, beans, carrots, and tomatos— among other things ! The culinary bit from Turkey is amusing; apropos of the onso?i-kebaf, or Turkish roast. That which is curious in the cooking of the square slices of beef on a spit, between fat and bay leaves, is, that the fat must be of sheep’s tail. In Turkey sheeps’ tail fat is used instead of lard— lard being prohibited by the law of the Prophet. “ I have seen,” M. Dubois says, “at Constantinople, sheeps’ tails that weighed, without exaggeration, ten kilogrammes (over twenty pounds). The tails are so excessively developed that the breeders are compelled to support them upon the live sheep, with little chariots. The Turks are very fond of the fat of the sheep’s tail.” The English saddle of mutton and quarter of lamb have made their reputation good in most of the kitchens in Europe, with little modifications, none of which, to my mind, are improvements. The saddle of mutton of the Maison Doree is not worthy to appear under the same roof with one—say at the Reform Club, or at the Albion, by Drury Lane. Nor can we accept the dish marked 569 on M. Dubois’ list, and headed, Muttons sliopps des brasseurs.

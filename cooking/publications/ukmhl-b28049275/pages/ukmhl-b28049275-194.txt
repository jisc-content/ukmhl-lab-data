The Epicure's Year Book. 166 A Magnificent Sherry. Host. “ Taste this sherry, sir: magnificent. Bought it at the sale of Bishop ” Guest. (Having tasted.) “ Colenso, I presume.” Three Aversions. It was the witty Prince de Ligne—to whom Talleyrand’s fame is somewhat indebted—who said that there were three things for which he had an especial abhorrence—meat that had been twice cooked, reconciled enemies, and spiteful women. A Man of Universal Taste. Southey describes a man of universal taste in matters of the palate, as one who would have eaten “sausages for breakfast at Norwich, sally-lunns at Bath, sweet butter in Cumberland, orange marmalade at Edinburgh, Findon had- docks at Aberdeen, and drunk punch with beef-steaks to oblige the French if they insisted upon obliging him with a dejefiner a VAnglaise. He would have eaten squab-pie in Devonshire, sheep’s-head with the hair on in Scotland, and potatoes roasted on the hearth in Ireland ; frogs with the French,* pickled herrings with the Dutch, sour krout with the Germans, maccaroni with the Italians, aniseed with the Spaniards, garlic with everybody; horse-flesh with the Tartars (or Mr. Bicknell), ass-flesh with the Persians, dogs with the North-West Indians, curry with the Asiatic East Indians, birds’ nests with the Chinese, mutton roasted with honey with the Turks, pismire cakes on the Orinoko, and turtle and venison with the lord mayor ; and the turtle and venison he would have preferred to all the other dishes, be- cause his taste, though Catholic, was not indiscriminating.” * Rather, with the Americans, who are the frog eating race.

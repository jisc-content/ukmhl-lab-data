96 The Epicure's Year Book. has been discovered that the specific gravity of a wine, may, in some instances, serve to point out adul- teration, etc. Pure red wines of France, according to the recent determinations of MM. Saint Pierre and Pujo, have a specific gravity of 0^999 to o’994. Dry white wines are generally the lightest; their specific gravity attains to about o-994. Sweet wines, on the contrary, are always heavier than water; but the more alcohol they contain, the lighter they become. They sometimes contain enough sugar to give them a specific gravity of ro89, which is observed in the Muscat de Lunel.” M. Pasteur’s Process. M. Pasteur’s process for the preservation of wine by heat was examined on the 20th of last June by a Commission appointed by the French Minister of Marine, to decide whether it should be adopted for the wine supplies of the Imperial Navy. The report of the Commission is in favour of the process. The Commissioners tasted wine bottled in 1863, after undergoing M. Pasteur’s process, and the same wine which had not undergone the process. The heated Wine was in perfect condition; while that which had not been heated had a “ saveitr amire trhprononcdek But M. Pasteur’s process has now been applied at Orleans, Bdziers, &c., on a very large scale, and with the best results. The wine which has undergone the process will bear long voyages by sea. In short, the French Marine gives its experience in the inventor’s favour.

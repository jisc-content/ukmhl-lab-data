WHOLESOME FARE, OR THE DOCTOR AND THE COOK. An English book on wholesome eating has appeared within the last twelve months. * It is a cookery book with a running commentary. The authors start with the proposition that “ the doctor, unsupported by the cook’s material aid, and the cook, unguided by the doctor’s knowledge, are two powerful agents, half whose strength is paralysed or misdirected.” True ; but the Delameres have not method enough in their text. They have assembled the materials for an admirable manual; and they have given themselves a good aim—but they have missed it. The values of various foods ; the suitability of dishes to various eaters ; regular courses of diet; dishes and drinks that may not be mixed, should have all been found in due order. The doctor should be always at the cook’s elbow. A book for cooks, written by a philosophical chemist : and one compiled methodically by a doctor for the guidance of the eater—remain to be written. I repeat that the Delameres have made an excellent but incomplete addition to gastronomic literature. Their work is amusing, copious—the fruit of no niggards where labour is in question. It wants that which it professes to promote—digestion. * “ Wholesome Fare, or the Doctor and the Cook ; etc.,” by Edmund S. and Ellen J. Delamere. Lockwood & Co.

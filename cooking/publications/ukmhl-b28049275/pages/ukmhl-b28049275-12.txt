It is with the utmost satisfaction that Fin-Bec has marked the effect of his first Year Book. Epicurism has been taken up in nearly every popular periodical, and the food question has ad- vanced. The result will be important; the English people will presently learn how to eat, and then they will cease to waste. Fin-Bec begs any epicure who may make a note of public value in his diary, to forward it to him early in the autumn, for the Year Book of 1870.

They say mijoter la soupe. The brave Dumas also favours us with his idea of a good cabbage soup. Put at the bottom of a large saucepan, a pound or a pound and a half of smoked ham ; cut a cabbage into four, in order to effectually extract those minor animals whose cooking is not necessary to the perfection of the bouillon. It must then be tied up carefully and put in the pot, packed up with the ham: after which fill the saucepan up to the top of the cabbage only—with the bouillon, which must have simmered during six hours.

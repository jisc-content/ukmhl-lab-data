Picnic Reform. 135 what horrible forms some of the subscriptions will take. While one lady will bring a little pigeon-pie, noticeable chiefly for the absence of pigeons, and a char-a-banc i\iM of friends; another will bring a copious provision of crude fruit from her garden. The conse- quence of a general gastronomic subscription in a large English company, where the knowledge of nearly all is restricted to a few meats and pies, must be a heavy, not to say coarse, banquet, altogether unsuited to the season. At the English picnic, more than in any other entertainment, is shown our utter disregard of the fitness of things in the matter of eating. Dr. A. W. Bellows, in his “ Philosophy of Eating,” recently published in New York,* complains that the Americans in their diet pay no attention to season and climate, and their own occupations, but “persist in having the same greasy and carbonaceous fare upon their tables, in summer as in winter, in Maine and South Carolina, and hence dyspepsia and bilious fevers.” He strongly objects to a breakfast of baked beans and fat pork— the proper meal for a wood sawyer in January—as a fitting preparation for a sermon on a Sunday in July. The remark applies with particular force to our pic- nics, and to other gastronomic habits of ours. The provoking part of our blunder is, that with a little thought it is easily mended; since the gastronomic resources of London are as abounding and as ac- cessible to modest purses as they are in any European capital. * See “ Reviews.'

A Representative Kitchen. 119 profession would have taken each the section to which his chief triumphs belonged. In this way a model kitchen, in operation under the command of the first professors in the world, would have been seen by the representatives of all nations ; and the guests of France would have been bidden to perfect banquets in the noble dining-halls. The idea was worthy of the author of the greatest book on the cuisine which the world has yet seen : that it was not realised, and that a great opportunity for spreading a knowledge of gas- tronomy was lost to the world, we have to thank Napoleon’s Commissioners, who sold every square yard to the highest bidder, and put men of M. Gouffd’s rank aside for Palais Royal purveyors. Some day, however, I trust a representative kitchen will be set up, in London or in Paris, with a Goufifd for president. All classes would gain in refinement and enjoyment by such an institution ; for it cannot be too often impressed on the dunderheads who revile at the accomplished cook, that good and varied cookery is economic and healthy cookery.

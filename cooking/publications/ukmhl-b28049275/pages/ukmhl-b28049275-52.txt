24 The Epicure's Year Book. MARCH. ■& March is the month in all the year, in which fish is most abundant. Turbot, salmon, soles, ling, plaice, flounders, perch, pike, eels, lobsters, oysters, smelts, dabs, carp, etc., are all in the market in fine condition. Oysters are in perfection. The spring enriches the vegetable garden, but there is no escaping the record of the fact, that this is a transition month in the kitchen. For those who fast, March is happily con- stituted, giving plentiful fish and vegetables to the art of the accomplished cook. It is held on all hands, that a chef must be a superior artist to furnish a good diner en maigre. It is the month of matelottes and fritures. The rdti, in March dinners, is the diffi- culty. There is the plover, the coq de prairie, and lastly the famous gdlinottes. Last season, Paris was suddenly provided, in plenty, with varieties of moor- fowl—from gdlinottes to the Capercailzie, which call to my mind certain winter nights when I enjoyed the bird under the hospitable auspices of that notable Swedish patriot, Count Adolphe Rosen of Orebro. Epicures will be glad to hear that an important trade has arisen between Russia and Western Europe, in varie- ties of moor-fowl. The gdlinotte is the favourite, and he comes well packed in oats, contained in wicker- baskets. These most welcome birds in March are delivered within a week from the time of being booked in Russia. The gdlinotte is a mighty relief from chicken and pigeon. Pain de gdlinottes aux (ruffes, V~" &

The Epicure's Year Book. 156 The origin of the menu is touched upon, where the author treats of festival customs in the houses of the country gentlemen about Shakspeare’s time : “ The carte, or bill of fare, was introduced about this period at the tables of the nobility; for Harrison tells us that ‘ the clearke of the kitchen useth (by a tricke taken up of late) to give in a briefe rehearsall of such and so manie dishes as are to come in everie course throughout the whole service in the dinner or supper; which bill some doo call a memoriall, others a billet, but some a fillet, because such are commonly hanged on the file.” The review of what people eat, and what their fore- fathers ate, discloses a rare list of human tastes and prejudices. The Spaniard held that eating a boar’s head would drive a man mad ; the Englishman gives it the place of honour at his Christmas board. The ancient Roman epicures were fond of the flavour of young and well-fed puppies ; these same gentlemen crunched the bones of the nightingale. Christmas is celebrated by the Swedes with lut-fisk, or stock-fish, decomposed in a solution of potash. Miss Bunbury observes : “The smell of the lut-fisk is terrific.” To the Scandinavian nose it is a whiff of Araby the blest. The Burmese delight to regale themselves with fried locusts (likened to fried shrimps). In China rat-soup is considered equal to oxtail soup. Are we right, or are the celestials ? The Japanese eat sea-weed.

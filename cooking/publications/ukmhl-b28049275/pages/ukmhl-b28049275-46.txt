The Epicure's Year Book. 18 4- refer the critic to Urbain Dubois’ Cuisine de Tons les Pays, page 342. He will find that the becfigues, or becfin, which are spitted with a slice of bacon between each bird, roasted and served upon toast, are indif- ferently, red-breasts, red-starts, black-caps, and other small birds which live in the south of France—chiefly upon figs. The chef opens directions for a dish of bec-figues a la Provencale: “ Pluck twenty-four fat beccaficos, ortolans, red-breasts, etc.” Let me make a timely note of the poularde des gourmets for the reader’s use this month. It is a very simple but exquisitely delicate dish, that deserves to rank very high indeed in the lists of three hundred and sixty-five methods of cooking a fowl, which M. de Cussy offered to submit to the hero of Austerlitz. Take a plump and tender pullet, truss it, dry and singe the interior, take a clean piece of meat dripping about the size of an egg, with double its quantity of butter, and mix with a good pinch of tarragon leaves;— and stuff the bird. Tie up the pullet securely at both ends, the feet within. Then take a fresh clean pig’s bladder ; insert the pullet; tie the aperture. Then wrap it in a cloth, and put it into boiling water. It should boil uninterruptedly for two hours. Untie the pullet when done, and serve it upon a hot dish in its own gravy. Separately, a sauce blonde flavoured with tarragon. Surely, such a dish as this may be served any day in any January in the most modest British establishment, without creating a domestic revo- lution !

Our Cellar. 85 are good ; the heady wines of Marseilles and Rous- sillon, are too strong for general use. Macon, Moulin- k-Vent, second qualities of Beaune, and the red wines of Champagne, are used as vins d'ordinaire by people of good means—or say the third crus of Bordeaux.* These third crus of Bordeaux ! They are the wines in which people delight throughout France, and far beyond the frontier, whereon people are permitted to drink them not over-doctored. The wines of the Gironde are perplexingly divided and sub-divided. Mr. Beckwith does not trouble us with the long list,— which is one of all the vineyards of the Bordeaux country : but we may take the following to be a good summary of them. “ There are many very excellent growths which are not even classed at all; but I may mention cursorily, such wines of the first class, as Chateau-Margaux, Chateau-Lafite (and not Lafitte, as it is usually spelt), Chateau-Latour, and Haut-Brion ; of the second class, Monton, Leoville, Rausan, La Rose, and Cos d’Estournel ; of the third class, Gis- cours, Lagrange, Langon, and Boyd-Cantenac ; of the fourth class, St. Pierre, Duluc, and Duhard ; of the fifth class, Grand-Puy, Cantemerle, Cos Labory, and Batailley.” Our wine guide offers, at once, on the subject of the first Bordeaux, some words of comfort. All the Chateau-Margaux and Chateau-Lafite, is not bought * A few very particular gourmets do not scruple to offer, a Vordinaire, the first qualities in Beaune and Volnay, and the Bordeaux of Grave and Saint-Emilion.—Nouvelle Almanack des Gourmands.

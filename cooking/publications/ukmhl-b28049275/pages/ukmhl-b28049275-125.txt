97 Wine Notes. Let wine consumers mark this ; the thinnest wine which has undergone this heating process may be transported far and wide, without the help of alcohol to make it “ keep.” The expense is very small indeed. I refer interested readers to the Report of the French Commission, to be had at the Ministry of Marine. M. Dumesnil has devised, the Chemical News says, a new process for preserving wine. The cask of wine uncorked is placed under an iron bell and the air exhausted ; two hours’ work is necessary before the noise occasioned by the exit of the air ceases. A vacuum being created, the gases contained in the wine are released from atmospheric pressure, and, as they are essentially elastic, they expand sufficiently to break the cells of vegetable fibrine inclosing them, and escape. These gases are dissolved to such an extent that the withdrawal of a large quantity occasions no sensible decrease of liquid. The theory of the decom- position of grape juice and other organic substances rests on the power of double decomposition. Gaseous products of fermentation are most active in inducing decomposition ; they alter wines indefinitely when in- closed in the fibrine-cells, which M. Pasteur calls mycoderma. M. Dumesnil allowed the wines of 1865 to ferment till March, 1866, so as to allow of the con- version of all the sugar and extractive matter into alcohol. At this period he substituted for the usual operations the treatment by the vacuum ; fermentation ceased entirely. The wines thus treated arrived at H

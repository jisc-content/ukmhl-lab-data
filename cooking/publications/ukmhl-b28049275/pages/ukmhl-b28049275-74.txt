46 The Epicure s Year Book. his debauches in the loaded vineyards. Tipsy as a Thrush* is a popular saying derived from the glut- tonous habits of the thrushes among the grapes. Their orgies on the grape give them a fine flavour, that is at its best now, when the vineyards are in their glory of purple and gold. Snipe are again upon the scene—with the partridge, and grouse, and the royal pheasant. With the abundant fruits, we have now chestnuts and artichokes in the kitchen. Artichokes are a rich resource, as hors d’oeuvres, as entries, and finally, as entremets. Of how many vegetables can this praise be spoken ? The vegetable garden is full at this season. Observe the list of fruits. Apricots, apples, figs, greengages, grapes, melons, peaches, pears, plums, quinces, filberts, and walnuts! The varieties of fish are many, sturgeon, turbot, trout, carp, mullet, John Dory, crayfish, and now the oyster (why have we not some of the French varieties ?) is put upon the table, t But I protest that it is early: that the oyster is not in a condition satisfactory to the man of taste ; and that M. Raisson was right when he con- jured the epicure to eat his first oyster at the close of November. Venison is before us ! Of thrushes, or grives. They may be eaten in many ways. Petites caisses de grives aux truffes, timbale de macaroni aux grives, are coquettishly pre- * Saoul comme une grive. f Last autumn a remarkable oyster establishment (where every variety, to the American, is to be had) was opened in the Rue Scribe, Paris. It might be copied in London. —F. 13.

Lady Bustles Orange Pudding. 131 the recipe to her own child, on her marriage.” In very mischief he took up the account of Lady Bustle’s Orange pudding, and extracted the following para- graph : “ She (Lady B.) has, however, promised her daughter Clorinda, that if she pleases her in marriage, she shall be told the composition of the pudding with- out reserve.” He sent this extract, in a blank envelope, to his sister. The female mind has a quick scent. The sister recognised the malice of the philosopher : and returned the extract, having written on the tongue of the envelope, “Nobody shall have it while I live. My mother left it to me on her deathbed. I am sorry your wife has not learned manners yet. To be sure yon are not capable of teaching her.” “What profound, what whimsical, what devilish selfishness,” quoth the philosopher. “ The perfect Christmas pudding is that which none but ourselves can taste ! ” The Bustle blood has not died out yet.

168 The Epicure's Year Book. Oil Dundee marmalade. It seems that it was first manufac- tured about seventy years ago by Mr. James Keiller, for local use. Now, one thousand tons are annually exported. One of the Newcastle potteries is almost exclusively em- ployed in turning marmalade pots, about one million and a half being required annually. Dessert Fruits in 1256. The only kinds of fruit named in the Countess of Lei- cester’s expenses are apples and pears. Three hundred of the latter were purchased at Canterbury, probably from the gardens of the monks. It is believed, however, that few' other sorts were generally grown in England before the latter end of the fifteenth century; although Mathew Paris, describing the bad season of 1257, observes that apples were scarce and pears scarcer, while quinces, vegetables, cherries, plums, and all shell fruits, were entirely destroyed. These shell fruits were probably the common hazel-nut, walnuts, and perhaps chesnuts. In 1256, the sheriffs of London were ordered to buy two thousand chesnuts for the king’s use. In the wardrobe book of the 14th of Edward the First, we find the bill of Nicholas, the royal fruiterer, in which the only fruits mentioned are pears, apples, quinces, medlars, and nuts. The supply of these from Whitsuntide to No- vember cost £i\ 14s. i^d. This apparent scarcity of indigenous fruits, naturally leads to the inquiry, what foreign kinds besides those included in the term spicery, such as almonds, dates, figs, and raisins, were imported into England in this and the following century? In the time of John and of Henry the Third, Rochelle was celebrated for its pears and conger eels. The sheriffs of London purchased a hundred of the former for Henry in 1223.— Timbs' ATooks and Corners of English Life.

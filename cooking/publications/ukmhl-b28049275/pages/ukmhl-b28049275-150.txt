122 The Epicitre's Year Book. meat is decidedly finer, and yet our neighbours say of us that we have but one good soup—turtle. Dumas, who has studied the cuisine of all nations, tells us that the Viennese make their bouillon by putting two chickens into a marmite, and boiling them till half- cooked ; they then take them out and roast them. To the bouillon they add a spoonful of gravy to colour it, and then they serve it—lukewarm. Thus they have at once a bad roti and a bad bouillon.

In the south of France mutton is preferred ; but then the south is not renowned for its soup. Still, mutton—after beef— makes a very good potage, especially if fried or roasted a little before putting in the saucepan. The same illustrious authority thus initiates us into the mysteries of a good potage. We are told to choose a piece of beef as large as is compatible with the family con- sumption. Bouillon will keep two days in summer, and three or four in winter, and large pieces therefore are a saving of time and fuel. The leg is an excellent joint—there is a good proportion of fat and lean.

Take away the bones, tie it up, and put it in the marmite with a pint of water to each pound of meat. We are advised to bone our piece of beef, but not by any means to exile the bones from the marmite, only

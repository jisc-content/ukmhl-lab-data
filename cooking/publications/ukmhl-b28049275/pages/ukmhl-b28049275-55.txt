April, gastronomically, may be said to “ open the eyes of expectation.” The old French gourmands held that the honours of April were divided between ham and lamb. At Easter, it was said, the hams of Bayonne and Mayence were in all their savoury glory, usually represented, like the Madonna, bearing her son in her lap, or like Isis with the infant Horns. We may see such images in the Louvre, and m the great Ethnographical Museum at Copenhagen, where the Queen of Heaven of the Chinese, Tinehow, figures in white porcelain, side by side with Schhng-mu, the Holy Mother. Certain metaphysical ideas are apt to flow in a common channel, and get clothed in the same symbolical dress. Hence we find a Queen of Heaven no less in Mexico than in Chma, in Egypt, Greece, Italy, and England; and under the Pagan title of a Christian festival, preserve, along with our buns, the memorial of her ancient reign.”

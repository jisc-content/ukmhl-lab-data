DINNERS AND DINERS 4 —“ I have dined ; you have dined ; we have dined.” What beauty in the last climax—the gradual communion into plurality—the suggestion of a snug party just over—the reminiscence of a tete-a-tete—the inkling of the thousand and one memories that come floating over the mind at its enunciation. There is an encyclopaedia of reflec- tion in every syllable! A dinner is the transmigrated skull which our modern philosophers, with more wisdom than the ancients, place daily upon their tables, to remind them of their mortality. How it fills the mind with genial fancies, and ripens it for the enjoy- ment of a cheerful evening. It is to a discussion of this meal that we are now about to solicit the honor of the reader’s company. We know not whether individually you are aware of the fact, but we have often entertained an opinion that “ Please, sir, dinner’s ready.” Very well; then give us the pleasure of your society, and we will talk the matter over within. Let us not disturb for awhile the harmony of that sound. “ The words of Mercury are harsh after the song of Apollo.”

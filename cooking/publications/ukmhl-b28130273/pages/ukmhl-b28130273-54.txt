Imagine the boy suddenly ex- panding into manhood, with the responsibility of his office, his mind enlarging with the sphere of his vocation and growing learned upon the dis- tinction of fat and lean, and critically erudite upon gravy ; and then trace him gradually drop- ping into the vale of years, bending under the accumulated weight of dinners he has provided for the multitude, and growing grey in the service of the stomach. The picture is too painful for con- templation. When, therefore, oh, diner ! the in- evitable moment arrives that thy pursestrings must be withdrawn in payment for thy vanished repast, let not thine eager fingers clutch up the copper change with scrupulous exactness; but leaving a fragment of thy finances as a waif to the waiting one, thou shalt button up thy breeches pocket with the consciousness of one who has not dined in vain, but who, in ministering to the per- sonal requisitions of the present, has also contri- buted a trifle to the coming exigencies of the future. It is a recognised Christian principle that we should all help one another; and waiters devoting themselves to helping, as a branch of the fine arts.

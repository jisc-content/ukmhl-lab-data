AT HOME AND ABROAD. 77 Thus terminated the most singular literary dinner on record ; and the next day the Heraldo announced, in all the confidence of large type, a forthcoming romance, entitled “ ‘ The Kings of Leon/ by Signor Alexandre Dumas.” One more little historiette for the sake of the moral attached, and we have done. A few years ago, a London bachelor friend of ours, whom we may call John Smith for the sake of the name’s novelty, took a trip to Paris for a month, and, perplexed by the mysteries of conti- nental cookery, never enjoyed a dinnner the whole time. One fine morning, prior to his intended departure for England, he was strolling along the Champs Elysees, when he encountered M. Bon- ville, a jolly French naval captain, with whom he had got tolerably intimate during his stay. “ Hollo!” cried the captain, “ how are you, my dear fellow ? I am just off for Versailles.” “ Indeed! Well, I wish you a pleasant journey.” “ What are you going to do ?” “ Dine, somewhere or other ; but as yet I have not made up my mind where.” “ Come on, and dine with me.” “ Impossible. I leave for London in the morning.” “ That’s the very reason, then, you should. Besides, I’ll give you a treat.”

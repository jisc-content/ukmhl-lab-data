80 DINNERS AND DINERS “ Nothing; at least, not till we have dined." The travellers now sat down to a table plenti- fully served, and got rid of their appetites with all possible expedition. When the repast was over, the horses were ordered forth, and the captain again rose to depart. “ Well, now I suppose,” cried Smith, “ we really are going back.” “ Nothing of the kind. We have had an excel- lent dinner, and we can now go on to Havre. ’ ‘‘Havre! Why I intended to be in London to-morrow.” “ So you can. It will be all in your road ; you can go thence by the packet to Southampton.” “ True: I forgot that. And I can send orders to Paris to forward my luggage direct home to Piccadilly.” “ Of course you can. Do it now.” It was done. Smith grew contented, and the travellers resumed their journey. In a short time the sea-port was reached, and Bonville drew' the attention of his companion to the wharves and quays of the busy scene of commerce, now beheld under the exciting aspect of night. <f Come,” said he, “ you would not like it to be said that you ever came to a sea-port without going over a vessel.” “ Certainly not! I should desire nothing better/" returned Smith, now exhilarated by the novelty of all around him.

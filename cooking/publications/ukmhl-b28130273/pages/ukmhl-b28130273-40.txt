DINNERS AND DINERS 2 G wealth. Open it where you will you stumble upon arithmetical combinations of figures that are there enshrined as symbols of golden sovereigns, counted up by hundreds and stored away in the substantial coffers of Peter’s bank. His auto- graph endows a simple strip of paper with won- drous pecuniary virtues, and his name endorsed upon a bill would make it as easily convertible into cash as though it bore the talismanic authority of <£ Mr. Matthew Marshall.” But wedged in some- how between the fourth-button of his waistcoat and the tightening tape at the back is an indu- rated mass, which only by anatomists would be called a heart. Peter hath no sympathies with poverty; he would listen to the most harrowing tale of desolate distress without the movement of a muscle; he would not bestow a doit in secret, but blazon his munificence abroad and he is liberal; the prospect of an advertisement with his donation chronicled therein, is the key that unlocks his purse-strings. With him charity is a cardinal virtue only fed and fostered by public dinners. Yet in the City is Peter Plum accounted a man with a large heart, whose benevolence is proverbial and whose gifts are manifold. He is, in short, a fair specimen of pseudo-philanthropy; his charity, like a cucumber, ripens under a glass.

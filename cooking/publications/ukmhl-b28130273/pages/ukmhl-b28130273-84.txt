DINNERS AND DINERS 70 ought to do, to subjugate the inhabitants effec- tually, and secure them from all murmurs of dis- sension, should be to diffuse amongst them the blessings of boiled beef, distributed from establish- ments that would at once minister to their imme- diate wants and secure their digestive organs from all possible insurrection. I-Iaving these views—from which, by the way, many plates have been taken, from time to time —it is with peculiar feelings of interest that we observe an absolute eruption of dining-rooms has broken out in different parts of town. The metro- polis—yea, we may appropriately call it the hot metropolis — has been lately positively reeking with steaming dishes and smoking platters. The great bell of St. Paul’s has become one gigantic dinner-bell—a bell that, with its iron tongue of time, might, in American phraseology, lick all creation. Open yet around us, ye portals of plea- sant promise! Back on your east and west hinges, ye doors of mighty kingdoms of cookery, where a new dynasty of dining princes shall rule the roast! Gape wider yet, ye narrow courts that lead from brisk and busy thoroughfares to regions of diurnal bliss! Grow greater yet, each avenue where what we have in you is so greatly prized! London has need of every one, and in the capacious stomach of its people there is room enough for all that ye can furnish!

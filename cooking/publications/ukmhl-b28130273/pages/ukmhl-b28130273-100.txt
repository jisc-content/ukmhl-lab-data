8G DINNERS AND DINERS autumnal gloaming gradually subsides, we find ourselves obliviously chatting on after dinner about old loves and old acquaintances, groping for mysterious wine-glasses in the dark, and hunting after runaway walnuts. There is a strong conge- niality in the associations of the time that we dis- cover in no other division of the day ; and it has been, in consequence, the trysting hour for hearts wrarined by love and friendship from time imme- morial. But prose is inadequate to the task of description ; let us in verse throw a few scattered images together that rise up vividly before us at the mere mention of the words—“ After Dinner Now’s the time to work the spell, Heart-linked spirits know so well. Crack the joke and tell the story, Whilst the fire burns bright before ye. Puns that draw like corkscrews after, From portly words the gurgling laughter. Let the cheerful bottle pass, Mix the care-defying glass, But be still the pledge that’s shown, Such as Temperance may own. Let the wreaths of Raleigh’s weed Float around unfurrowed brow, Choice Havannah, we have need Of thy fragrant incense now. Schoolboy pranks and recollections Of some furtive pleasures gone. Mingle with the sad reflections, That have dulled and changed the tone. Friendship’s halo shines around us, Weaving joys of rainbow hue, Making men as youth once found us, Fond in love—to friendship true.

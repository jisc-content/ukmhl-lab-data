1860. Just published, post free, Three Stamps, THE TRFATISE “GABRIEL ON THE LOSS X -AND ONLY EFFECTUAL MODE OF RESTORING THE TEETH” explains their Patented System of Supplying Artificial Teeth, with Flexible Coralite Gums as a base. The extraordinary advantages obtained bv Gabriel’s system are a perfect set of Teeth, adapted with the utmost accuracy by a visit of an hour, without any operation, and without the use of springs, wires, or any metals. Sharp edges avoided, and an amount of suction or adhesion perfectly astonishing obtained; while their success is guaranteed in the most difficult cases, even when other methods have failed. They are not affected by the ordinary changes of the mouth, or even the loss of Teeth (if any remain), thus dispensing with the further services of the Dentist. The best materials, which are warranted to remain pure and sweet, only employed, while the expense is even less than half the ordinary cost. References to patients and testi- monials may be seen. Inspection by the medical profession and all interested is particularly requested by Messrs. GABRIEL, Dentists to the Prince d’Ottajana. Established 1815.

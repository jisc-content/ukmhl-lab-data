Thus the use of curry was made known co-etaneously with the use of gunpowder; the same year gave pancakes and printing to an admiring- world ; the first idea of the steam-engine associates itself with the period when potatoes—they were then excellent boilers—first appeared in all their mealy majesty; and the daguerreotype and the electric telegraph were manifestly the noble results of our modern triumphs of cookery.

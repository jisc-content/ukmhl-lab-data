Thus prepared he began to go the rounds, and so regulating his visits that he always contrived to come in with the table-cloth, he would enter rubbing his hands and his face beaming with smiles, exclaiming, “ Ah, my dear B ! sorry to interrupt you at this time, but the fact is, just seen my solicitor. Case to come on Monday next, sure of a verdict—pay you in full with a douceur besides. Interest, my dear boy—insist upon it. Couldn’t resist the pleasure of popping in to tell you — very acceptable, I know, &c.” To which the delighted victim, in the innocence of his heart, of course 'would respond, “Beally, this is very kind of you; pray sit down. The joint just up; nobody here—only Mrs. B and the little ones. Nay, I insist upon it.” And the collolquy would terminate with a short struggle after coat and hat, which the victim cap- tures after a little decorous resistance, and then the dinner is served up, and the visitor leaves, promising to call again on the following Monday, with the necessary means of settlement. It is needless to say neither arrive as promised.

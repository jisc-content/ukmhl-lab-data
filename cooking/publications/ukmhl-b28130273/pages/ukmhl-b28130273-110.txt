f 96 DINNERS AND DINERS baBility of enjoying a cigar and a glass of brandy- and-water together at some favourite place of resort, and walking-sticks became semaphores for other parts of the house, until on egress you found that you had become one of a merry circle, which, after the performances had concluded, enclosed chops and steaks, curiously intermingled with divers spirituous compounds ? All this, and much more than need be here set down, is at once suggested by the contemplation of a bachelor after dinner, who, with the latchkey in his pocket, and a purse to correspond, goes at full price to the play, and determines upon making what the e( fast ” gentry call “ a night of it.” But the supper that follows—the savoury repast to which the previous enjoyment has given addi- tional zest—what can be a more congenial con- clusion to an evening thus spent? Chops and steaks become endowed with hitherto unperceived beauties, and a glass of stout has a relish until then unknown. Should the repast be taken where minstrelsy is supposed to attract custom and aid digestion, the chaotic blending of the orders to the waiter with the exertions of the engaged pro- fessionals will result in a confusion of ideas most bewildering to the uninitiated, and which leaves you in a perplexed condition as to whether you might not have requested a chop off “ the Monks of Old,” and a plate of mashed “ Annie Lawries.”

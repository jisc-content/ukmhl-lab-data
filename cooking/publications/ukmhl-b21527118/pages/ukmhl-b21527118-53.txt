41 THE STORE ROOM, LARDER, &c. is a fruitful cause of accidents. Where a dainty cuisine is expected, economy is impossible if the most is not made of the materials at hand, and the tiniest scraps of fish, meat, vegetable, or sauce can be worked up by a skilful cook, on condition that they are neaHy stored. The shelves should be wiped down daily with a dOjinp cloth to remove all dust, &c., and thoroughly scrubbed or washed down once a week with either carbolic s^p or a solution of carbolic. Choose a dry day for this work, and lift out everything from the larder before beginning to scrub. If possiole, always keep butt^, cream, milk, and eggs away from other food, and be extremely careful to place the dairy produce in a clean, untainted place, as nothing catches germs, &c., so quickly as milk in any shape. .

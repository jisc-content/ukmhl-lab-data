Board wages, from 8s. to 14s. weekly for women; from 12s. to 16s. weekly for men, besides fire and light. It is impossible to give moi-e than an approximate idea of board wages, as these differ in different parts of the country. With regard to dress, there are certain points to be considered. Lady’s maids wear neither caps nor print dresses; whilst aprons are a matter for their own per- sonal decision. When in attendance on their mistress a black or dark skirt and blouse, and quiet-looking head- gear and cloak or jacket are indispensable; but it must be remembered that in large country houses senmnts dress for dinner, just as their masters and mistresses do, slipping on a blouse or overall when attending on their mistresses. House and parlourmaids usually wear tidy print dresses, aprons, and caps in the morning; in the after- noon plain black dresses, with muslin aprons and caps, turned-down linen collars and cuffs. These they are supposed to provide for themselves. Where, however, mistresses insist on a uniform being worn in the after- noon, this must be provided, remaining the mistress’s property on the seiwant’s departure, as a man’s livery does. .4 professed or superior cook weai's a cap or not, as she pleases, but always a print dress and long sleeves.

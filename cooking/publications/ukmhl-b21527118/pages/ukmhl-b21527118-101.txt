THE OFFICES. 89 One good clock. One set- of jugs. One salt box. One pestle and mortar, marble or wedgewood. One dinner set, kitchen. One tea set, kitchen. One teapot. One or two good lamps, if no gas. One soft broom. One hard broom. One yard broom. One dust pan and brush. One sink brush and sink tidy. One set blacklead brushes. One cinder sifter. One set boot brushes. One pot stand. One plate rack. One kitchen table. One dishing-up table. Chairs as required. One refrigerator. One set of dish covers. Two trays. Of course, this is not a full li.st, and moulds have been purposely omitted. The ordinai'y idea seems to be twelve pattypans, one or two cake tins, one hot pot tin, one jelly and one Charlotte mould. To these may be added border, cutlet, dariole, and jelly moulds, ad lib., as your cook’s wants grow. (A fresh set of moulds, or some new and labour-saving device, is always a welcome and encouraging surprise to a willing cook, who fully appreciates any mark of attention on her mistress’s part.) A Dover egg-beater, fruit-stoners, apple-corers, potato- slicers, paring-knives, a tamis-pressoir (for sauces, purees, &c.), a bain-marie, pastry-racks, vegetable-cutters, a. coffee-mill, fireproof china dishes, such as coenties, souffio dishes, casseroles. &c., are all useful addenda, and mav be added gradually to suit your cook’s convenience and your own purse. A sink-tidy and sink-brush should bo a sine qua non in every sink.

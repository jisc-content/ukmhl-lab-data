Now, with regard to the quantity of linen required. The usual allowances are three pairs of sheets to each bed (where economy has to be considered, five pairs may be made to do for every two beds of the same size). As to the use of sheets, housekeepers entertain different opinions; .wine make their sheets up into pairs, others, again, divide them into upper and under sheets, their arrangement being to allow one under .sheet for each bed, either weekly or fortnightly, and two upper sheets for the same period, as they consider this greatly lessens the washing bill.

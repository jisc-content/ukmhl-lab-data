The usual process is this: Well dust the windows both inside and out, and wash the woodwork. Next wash well with a cloth or leather wrung out of tepid water to which you have added a spoonful of either ammonia or paraffin, getting well into the corners; then diy with a clean duster. Mind that any cloths used in window Avasliing are not fluffy, or they will spoil the result. Then polish either with a clean cloth or leather, or, better still, with pads of soft newspaper. In winter it is better to us© no water, but to rub whiting slightly moistened with water or methylated spirit on to the glass with a flannel, and then polish with two leathers, or clean, soft newspaper. Faint iStained.—Paint or puttv splashes may be removed by rubbing them with strong, hot vin^ar. Steaming or Freezing.—^When the windows are perfectly cleaned, soak a piece of cotton rag in pure glycerine, and apply this all over the window on the inside; then with a clean, dry rag polish the whole pane lightly all over till the glycerine is invisible, though not actually all removed. This will give a brilliant, lasting polish, and saves all risk of condensation, or “ sweatii^,” which occurs in rooms whose ventilation is defective, and there is not sufficient fresh air admitted to prevent the clouding of the glass. The room should be fairly warm and quite d^ when the glycerine is applied. Much less window cleaning is needed if servants are careful to keep the insides of the panes thoroughly dusted and polished with whiting or the glycerine.

CHAPTER III. THE STORE ROOM, LARDER, &c. The store room occupies a very important position, in country houses especially: it should be cool, airy, and, above all, dry. Where the space can be spared, it is best to use a fairly large room for this purpose^ and have it fitted up specially. The first thing should be to look the room well over, and have all the cracks and crannies well stopped with plaster of Paris to check the entrance of mice and other pests; then have it generously fitted up with shelves all round. These are best graduated, the larger and lower ones for the heavier and bulkier articles, the narrower and lighter ones on top. Besides this, there should be a strong, finn table, if possible with one or more drawers of generous size, and in one corner, if it can be managed, there should be a small lock-up cupboard for medical comforts, and also for bleaching liquids, and such household requisites as may not be li^tly trusted in servants’ hands. In one of the drawers of the table should be kept a supply of brown and white paper, string, tape, and some adhesive labels; in the other two or three spoons of various sorts and sizes, a sharp knife, a strong pair of scissors, a corkscre\w a ball of string, a cheese-cutter, and a soap- cutter. These last are practically the same as far as make goes, but should, naturally, be kept very strictly for their separate uses. To make these, take two pieces of wood (strong firewood will do), point these at both ends, scraping and sand-papering the wood to get it perfectly smooth (these sticks should be of the same size and shape as “tipcats”), attach a length of wire to each, either through a hole in the centre, made with a red-hot skewer, or by fastening the wire securely D

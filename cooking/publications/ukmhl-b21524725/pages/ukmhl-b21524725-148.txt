123 WHOLESOME COOEEltY. 317.—Stewed Pears. Peel tlie pears and put them in a stewpan, with a little water, lemon-peel, and sugar (to every pound of pears a quarter of a pound of sugar); if liked coloured, a few drops of cochineal. Simmer very gently till the pears are cooked. Take them out and continue sim- mering the syrup until it is thick. 318.—Fig Mould. Half a pound of dried figs, a small piece of lemon- peel, 2 ounces of white sugar. Cover them with half a pint of claret, or claret and water, or water alone; simmer them gently till quite soft and the liquor absorbed. Press it into a mould; when cold, turn out and serve with whipped cream or custard. When the figs are stewed, they ought to form a thick paste. If they should be at aU lumpy, pass them through a wire sieve. 319.—Prune Mould. Made exactly like the fig mould. Of course, take out the stones after the prunes are cooked. Crack a few of the stones, and put some of the kernels in the mould with the prunes.

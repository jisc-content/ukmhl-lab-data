WHOLESOME COOKERY. 46 96.—Ravigote Sauce (Cold). Chop some herbs of all sorts, capers, anchovies, all very small; add the yolk of an egg, then oil very gently, as you would for a mayonnaise; then vinegar to taste, also poured in gently so as not to turn the sauce; at the last stir in enough mustard for the sauce to be fairly hot, 97.—Green Sauce. 2 slices of ham, 2 slices of veal. Put them in a saucepan and let them stew gently in their own gravy; then add a little stock and white wine, and allow all to simmer for some minutes. Strain. Now take the juice of some herbs, such as tarragon, chervil, parsley, spinach, etc., by pounding them in a mortar. Add this juice to the above sauce; flavour with pepper and salt, thicken with 4 yolks of eggs, add the juice of 1 lemon. 98.— Bechamel Sauce. Place in a saucepan 1 ounce of butter, chopped parsley, tarragon, chervil, shallot, enough flour to thicken; stew for a few minutes; add 1 pint of cream (or cream and milk), pepper, salt, and nutmeg; stir it over the fire until thick; pass through a hair sieve. 98a. Sauce “a la Bechamel” (Bechamel Sauce). Proceed exactly as above, but use cream and gravij in equal quantities, instead of cream or cream and milk.

154 WHOLESOME COOKERY. 391.—Iced Souffle. Mix in a saucepan 6 yolks of eggs, with 4 ounces of clai'ified sugar. Whisk this over the fire until it nearly boils; take it ofi" the fire at once. Continue whisking till the mixture is nearly cold. Add to it 1 quart of whisked double cream and a glass of rum or cura5oa; continue whisking until all is thoroughly mixed. Have your souffle lining standing on ice, so as tc get it thoroughly cold; this is important. Fix a band of paper about 2 inches above the dish; pour in the mixture, almost as high as the paper; cover the mould completely, and embed it in ice and salt. 2 hours’ freezing is about the time it will take. Then take off the paper, strew biscuit powder lightly on the top, and serve. Souffles can be fiavoured with the juice of fruit, or coffee, or chocolate, or vanilla, etc. N.B.—The souffle must be embedded in the ice and salt as soon as it is mixed, and placed in the lining.

MEATS AND BIRDS. 123 bottles of cocks’-combs and a tin of mushrooms, to- gether with little pieces of chicken, make a good “ financik-e.” Bottled truffles are not worth buying; they are expensive, and have little or no flavour. 304.—Rissoles. Mince up any remains of cold meat; stew them up in thickened gravy, Avith a few herbs, pepper, and salt (onion if liked). Let it stand till cold. Then make it up into small balls—touch them as little as possible, and with the palms of the hands instead of the fingers—then cover them Avith fine bread-crumbs. Beat a yolk of egg up well; dip in the balls, and cover them again with fine bread-crumbs. Fry a pale yellow, and serve with fried parsley or grav}^. 305.—Westphalian Rissoles. Mince a quarter of a pound of lean ham ; pound it up Avith 1 pound of mashed potatoes, some butter, pepper, salt, and tAvo beaten eggs. Divide the mixture into rolls, and fry them in boiling fat. Seiwe Avith gravy. 306.—Pastry Rissoles. Make a light paste; roll it out thin, cut it into squares. On each square place a small piece of savoury mince; roll up each square, and fry in boiling fat. Dish up on a napkin.

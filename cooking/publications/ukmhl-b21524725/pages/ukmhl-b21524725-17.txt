Xllt PnEFACE TO FOURTH EDITION. I have been told that where there is no close range or gas-stove, it is difficult to cook many dishes rcqiiiring to be slowly simmered. In that case, the cook should be provided with a set of different-smed French baking-dishes, with lids which have a hole at the top, to allow of the steam escaping, and the dish should be put in a moderately heated oven, where it will simmer as well as on the side of a close range. It has been suggested to me that “small joints,” for three or four persons, are not easily procured. I think that the difficulty is overrated. For instance, a sirloin may be reduced and economized as follows : Cut off the end, I mean the piece which curls up in roasting, this piece can be used for a small “pot au feu,” or slowly stewed with vegetables, or salted down. If the sirloin is still rather large, take a “ porter-house steak ” off it—this is a large beef chop taken off the face of the sirloin about 1^ inch thick, it is cut right through the siiloin lengthways, cutting through the under-cut, the bone, and the upper-cut. You have now a small sirloin for roasting. You can make a further reduction by taking out the under-cut, and u.sing it for boiled steaks, provided that you do not mind being left with only the upper-cut for roasting. You can reduce a leg of mutton by taking one or two slices off the thick end of the leg, cutting through the bone so as to obtain a slice about inch thick.

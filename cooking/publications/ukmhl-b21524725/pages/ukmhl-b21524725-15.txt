PEEFACE. XI In ordering a dinnei*—I mean a dinner of several courses—use judgment. Your cook has only one pair of hands; so do not order several dishes that all require attendance at the same time. Do not, for instance,^ order three dishes running that require frying. In writing out your hills of fare, write them out in English, except, of course, in those cases where the dish is a purely foreign one. For instance, a “risotto,” a “ mayonnaise,” and other dishes of that sort cannot he translated into English, there being no equivalent for them. To translate “ saddle of mutton,” “ mint sauce,” or “plum-pudding” into French, or what is intended to he French, is a barbarism. I must apologize if I have occasionally betrayed the secret of some favourite dish revealed by a friend. I have learned I’ecipes or had suggestions for recipes from many sources, sometimes in a friend’s house, sometimes in small inns, especially in France and Italy, where the man or woman who waits at table is usually the cook of the establishment. MARIE DE JONCOURT. A^ril, 1882.

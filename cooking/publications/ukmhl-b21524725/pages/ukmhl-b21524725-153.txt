133 SWEETS. 330.—Genoa Cream. Half a pint of milk, 2 ounces of maccaroons, half an ounce of gelatine, half a wine-glassful of brandy, a little grated orange-peel, 8 ounces of sugar, 4 yolks of eggs, quarter of a pint of whipped cream, a few chopped candied fruits. Soak the gelatine in a little of the milk. Boil the rest, and add to it the 4 yolks of eggs, maccaroons, sugar, and orange-peel. Stir it on the side of the fii’e until it begins to thicken; take it off the fii'e; add the brandy and then the soaked gela- tine. Strain it through a hair sieve, and when nearly cold add the whipped cream and candied fruits. Put in a mould, ready to turn out when required. 331.—Orange Cream. 1 ounce of gelatine, quarter of a pound of loaf sugar, 1 lemon, 7 oranges, half a pint of cream. Squeeze and strain the juice of the lemon and orange; put it in a saucepan, with the gelatine and sufficient water to make the whole quantity up to 1 pint; rub the sugar over the lemon and orange peels, and add it to the juice. Boil up ten minutes, strain it, and when nearly cold whisk it up with the cream, and turn it into a mould to set, ready for turning out. This recipe can be used for any fruit juice in place of orange.

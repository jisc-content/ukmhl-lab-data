172 WHOLESOME COOKERY. 431.—Panade. Cut up small 2 pounds of juicy rumpstealc, or a ■whole fowl, or a pheasant (freshly killed). Put it in a jar ; cover this jar tightly -with a paper, and prick a few holes into the paper. Place the jar in a saucepan of cold water; the water ought to reach nearly to the top of the jar, hut not sufficiently to come over. Fit the lid of the saucepan very tightly on, and let it simmer gently nearly all day. Pour off the small quantity of liquid which will have been extracted from the meat, and let it stand for the fat to rise and be removed. Now take the meat, pound it in a mortar, and run it through a sieve into the liquid. Add a little salt. Will be about the consistency of thick cream, and is easily digested. Can be used hot or cold. 432.—Potted Meat. Cut some fresh rumpsteak into small pieces; put it all, fat and lean, into a jar with half a teacupful of water. Put the jar in a saucepan of water; cover the jar up tight, and let the contents simmer till quite tender. Pound it now in a mortar, adding its own gra^vy by degrees ; flavour with pepper and salt. Place it in jars, and cover with hot melted butter, if it is to be kept any time. This potted meat is excellent used for sandwiches, but it is better to make only a small quantity at a time.

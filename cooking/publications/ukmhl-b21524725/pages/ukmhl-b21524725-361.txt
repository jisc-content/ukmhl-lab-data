There is, perhaps, no edition in which the works of Shakspere can be read in such luxury of type and quiet distinction of form as this, and we warmly recommend it.”—Fall Mall Gazette. “ For elegance of form and beauty of typography, no edition of Shakspere hitherto published has excelled the ‘ Parchment Library Edition.’ . . . They are in the strictest sense pocket volumes, yet the type is bold, and, being on fine white hand-made paper, can hardly tax the weakest of sight. The print is judiciously confined to the text, notes being more appropriate to library editions. The whole will be comprised in the cream-coloured parchment which gives the name to the series.” —Daily News. ‘I The Parchment Library Edition of Shakspere needs no further praise,”—Saturday Review. Just published. Price ^s.

Split the pigeons in half; toss them in butter to brown them; leave them in the stewpan with the butter; add some more butter and some very finely chopped onion; cover the stewpan up very tightly, and let the pigeons simmer very gently by the side of the fire for 2 hours. Serve them up with the butter they have simmered in; the onions ought to have quite disappeared. The quantity of butter and onion will depend on the number of pigeons used.

PEEFACE TO FOUETH EDITION. I HA.VE been asked, in the event of a further edition of this book, to state quantities with some precision. It is true that in many places I have not stated quantities, but wherever they are not specified, it is because I do not think a precise statement of quantity will be any useful guide. There are dishes where quantities must be carefully Aveighed and measured; there are others where the quantities must depend on the season of the year, or the articles used, and also whether certain vegetables and flavours are liked or not; a tablespoonful of onion may be considered too much by one person, and not nearly enough by another. The cook must study the tastes of the people for whom she is cooking. Again, articles like carrots, turnips, onions, to- matoes, vary in flavour according to the season of the year, and they greatly vary in size. A hard-and- fast rule given as to the actual number of vegetables used is quite impossible.

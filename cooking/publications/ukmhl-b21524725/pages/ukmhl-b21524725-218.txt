198 WHOLESOME COOKERY. 496.—Tomato Stuflmg. Proceed as above, but substitute 3 good-sized tomatoes for tbe mushrooms. 497.—Stuffed Olives. Eemove tbe stones from some French olives with- out breaking the olive in pieces. (The way to do this is to peel round the stone as if you were peeling the whole of an orange in one piece.) Prepare some anchovy butter from recipe 122; fill the olive with this mixture ; then pour some olive oil over the olives; let them stand for a .short time before serving them; serve instead or as well as cheese, or before the soup. Allow from 4 to 6 olives for each person. 498.—Anchovy Eggs. Boil some eggs hard; peel and cut each egg in half (straighten the ends so that each half can stand firm on the dish) ; take out the yolk, and to each half- yolk pound up half a boned anchovy, and sufficient cream and butter to mix it into a smooth paste. Fill each half-white with the mixture, and serve the eggs alone before the soup, or with a lettuce salad, dressed with mayonnaise sauce. 4 eggs are sufficient for 6 persons.

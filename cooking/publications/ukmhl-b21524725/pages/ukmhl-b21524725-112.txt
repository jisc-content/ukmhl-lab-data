WHOLESOME COOKERY. 92 MEATS AND BIRDS. 231.â€”Polish Fillet of Beef. Rub the fillet with a little salt; leave it 4 hours. Now boil some vinegar, wine, and water, in equal quantities, with an onion, a clove, a bay leaf, a couple of slices of a lemon, some thyme, and a little ginger. Pour this hot over the fillet, and leave. Each day boil up the liquor, and pour it 2 or 3 times over the fillet. Do this for 3 days. Now lard the beef with fillets of anchovy. Place some thin slices of bacon fat at the bottom of a stewpan; place the fillet upon it; cover it with some more slices of bacon fat; pour round a small quantity of the liquor the beef has soaked in, then cover the stewpan with a greased paper and the lid. Place it on the side of the fire to simmer slowly; baste it frequently with the liquor in which the beef is cooking, and alternately with a little sour milk. When the fillet is cooked, clear it from any fat which may have settled upon it. Make a sauce with flour, sour milk, butter, a pounded anchovy, and some of the liquor from the beef. Add a few capers, and serve round the beef.

10 WHOLESOME COOKERY. SOUPS. 1.—Pot au feu. Put in a large saucepan 6 or 7 pounds of silver side of the round of beef, 5 quarts of cold water. Before it begins to boil, skim it very carefully. When all the scum has been removed, add 5 turnips, 6 carrots, 1 leek, 2 parsnips, 2 large onions, 1 good bunch of parsle}'-, 1 bead of celery, 6 cloves, a few peppercorns, 1 ball of browning, salt to taste (about 2 tablespoonfuls for this quantity); simmer very slowly for 5 or 6 hours. Be- fore using, strain through a hair sieve. The beef is good hot or cold, but especially cold. This soup ought to be 'perfectly clear. If it is not so, it is either because some of the scum has not been removed, or principally because the soup has been allowed to hoil. If the beef is used hot, serve a piquante or tomato sauce with it, or thicken a little of the soup and serve that. The vegetables can be chopped, pressed into a mould, and turned out cold with a mayonnaise sauce. 2.—English Clear Soup. 3 to 4 pounds of gravy beef Cut the meat into pieces, and fry them in a little butter to colour them ;

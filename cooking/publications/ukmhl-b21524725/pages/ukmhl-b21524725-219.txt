199 SUNDBISS. 499.—Caviare Eggs. Boil some eggs hard; peel them, and cut them in halves lengthways j take out the yolks, and mix them with some caviare and lemon-juice, and pepper to taste; fill the empty half-white with this prepared caviare. Beat some butter to a cream; lay a small wreath of this butter round the caviare. Serve before the soup. N.B.—The butter can be placed round the caviare (on the edge of the egg) by squeezing it through a small icing tube. 500.—Buttered Eggs (“ a la Guys ”). Cut some thin slices off a sandwich loaf; toast these slices crisply; have some grated Parmesan and butter well mixed together, and butter the pieces of toast quickly with this mixture; leave the toast by the side of the fire, or in the oven, to keep warm. Now put a lump of butter in a saucepan; break in some eggs; stir with a wooden spoon till the eggs are just set. Dish the eggs up on the toast; pour over them a small quantity of gravy (that which comes from under a roast joint). 3 eggs to 1 ounce of butter is the right proportion.

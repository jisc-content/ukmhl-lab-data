WHOLESOME COOKEBT. 100 little sliced onion, some lettuce broken in pieces; then another layer of meat and vegetables and slices of cucumber. Pour over this about 1 pint of water, and stew very gently. Should the water evaporate, add a little more, or add gravy. Skim off all the fat very carefully and dish up. The cucumber ought to be taken out as soon as it is cooked, which it will be before the other ingredients, and it can be added in again just before dishing up. 247.—Savoury Mould. Mince up very small the remains of any cold meats, the greater variety the better. Add a slice of bread soaked in milk, pepper and salt, a spoonful of chutnee. Put all together in a saucepan, with sufficient stock or gravy to moisten it; stew slightly for a few minutes; put it in a mould and steam half an hour. Turn out with a nice gravy round, or any sauce liked. N.B.—This mould is good cold, served with a salad. 248.—Fricandeau of Veal. Have a nicely shaped piece of veal (either fillet or cushion); lard it very thoroughly on both sides. Put in a saucepan the trimmings of your veal and larding pork, some chopped onion, chopped carrots, bunch of herbs, bay leaf, a couple of cloves, and some stock. Place the veal in this, and let it simmer till cooked.

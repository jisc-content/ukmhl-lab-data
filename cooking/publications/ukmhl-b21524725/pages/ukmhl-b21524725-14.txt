PREFACE. X there always he plenty in your cook’s charge, and make her responsible for it. It is wise to let your cook know your estimate of what a week’s feeding ought to cost. From twelve to fourteen shillings per head a week is ample, and you ought to be able to live exceedingly well on that. This is the calculation for a London household, where you have even to buy parsley. If the weekly books are higher than they should be, it is quite as often the fault of the mistress as of the cook. Carelessness in ordering is as great a fault as carelessness in con- suming. I often hear a mistress say, “ My cook has so little idea!” Where is she to get her ideas ? She may be twenty-five years old and have lived in four situations; her only ideas are what she has gathered in those previous situations. You, on the other hand, have lunched and dined out frequently, have probably travelled and dined at good restaurants'; your husband belongs to a club, and can give you the benefit of his experience; therefore it is you who ought to bring the ideas. The comfort and, I may say, health of your house depend on your knowledge, and the management of the detail of a house really takes very little time. An hour every morning is all that is required.

WHOLESOME COOKERY. 230 Ifj pint of juice if the fruit was fine and ripe. Put this juice to boil with 3 ounces of loaf sugar; let it boil for 2 hours; pour it into a mould, and when set, turn it out, and serve with Devonshire or whipped cream. This jelly is better if not used the same day it is made; on the other hand, it can be kept many weeks if the fruit was very ripe, and you cover the moulds tightly as you would pots of jam. 557.—Apple Jelly. Peel and core the apples, and cut them into thin slices, and throw them into cold water as you prepare them, so that they do not become yellow. Place them on the fire with sufficient water to cover them, and add the juice of 2 or 3 lemons to each 50 apples. When the apples are quite soft, press all through a jelly bag or a very fine sieve. Then weigh the juice, and add an equal quantity of sugar in small lumps. Place this on the fire, and let it simmer until thick, and you will find it set firm when cold. Place in pots, and cover in the usual manner. N.B.—The apple pulp that remains can be stewed down with some sugar (three-quarters of a pound of sugar to 1 pound of apple), to make into jam. 558.—Pear Jelly. Proceed exactly as for apple jelly.

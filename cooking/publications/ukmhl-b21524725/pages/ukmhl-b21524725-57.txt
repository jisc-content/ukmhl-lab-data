FISH. 37 69.—Flemish Mackerel. When the mackerel are prepared, bone them and fill the space with butter, chopped shallot, parsley, l^epper, salt, and lemon-juice; wrap each mackerel up in a well-buttered paper; put them to cook in the oven. When cooked, take the papers off and dish up hot. A good-sized mackerel may take about 25 minutes, but time will depend on the size of the fish and the heat of the oven, which ought to be mode- rately hot. 70.—Mackerel “ au Beurre Noir.” Open; bone; spread a little butter, pepper, and salt over them, and broil them before the fire or cook in the oven. Melt some butter in a saucepan; when it is a rich brown, add some lemon-juice and serve it over the fish. Must be sent to table quite hot. 70a.—Mackerel “ a rAUemande.” Prepared as above, but served with a mustard sauce over. 70b.—Herrings “au Beurre Noir.” Prepared and served exactly like the mackerel. 71.—Mackerel “ a la Maitre d’Hotel.” Open and bone the mackerel; pour a little oil over it, and sprinkle some chopped parsley; leave it for half UNIVERSii' LIBRARY LEEDS

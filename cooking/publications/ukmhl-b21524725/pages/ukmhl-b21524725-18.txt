If you want a small joint of veal, you can order two or three bones of loin of veal (in fact, loin chops not divided) for roasting; the shape is that of a small-sized sirloin of beef, and the weight is from 2i to 3^ pounds. The above are a few instances of simple expedients which any good housekeeper will easily learn to apply and multiply. MARIE DE JONCOURT. November, 1886.

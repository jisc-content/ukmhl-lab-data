WHOLESOME COOKERY. 176 442.—Suggestions for Different Salads. Frencli beans, or cauliflowers, or a white cabbage, •or the tops of asparagus, or celery, or beetroot and celery combined, when cooked and cold, make ex- cellent salads, either alone or together, if simply dressed with oil, vinegar, pepper, and salt in proper propor- tions. Meat cut into fine shreds, with a few chopped pickles, and dressed with a mayonnaise sauce (the recipe of which is given in all cookery books), or cold fish dressed with the same sauce, are also excellent cold dishes. 443. —Indian Chutnee. Cold cooked potatoes. Mash them up very smooth; add some chopped green chili, and onions chopped small, salt, and lemon-juice. Mix all thoroughly together; put it in a small mould, press it tight, and turn it out to serve with curry. N.B.—The chili and onion must be chopped very fine. Raw tomatoes can be used instead of potatoes. 444, —Soup “ Joubert.” Have ready IJ quart of boiling pot au feu, or English clear soup; beat up 2 eggs; blend 1 tea- spoonful of flour with enough water to make it smooth; add it to the eggs, and beat again well.

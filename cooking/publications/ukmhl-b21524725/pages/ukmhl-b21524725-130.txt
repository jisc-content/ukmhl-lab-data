110 WHOLESOME COOKERY. 272.—Poiile au Riz. Truss a fowl/or boiling. Put it in a saucepan, with half an onion chopped, 1 turnip and 1 carrot, also chopped, a bunch of herbs; cover it with milk or milk and water; add pepper and salt. Let it simmer till cooked. When it is about half cooked, take out some of the stock; put it in another saucepan, and simmer some rice in it. When both chicken and rice are cooked, strain the chicken sauce; then take as much as you think you wiU require for sauce, and thicken it with 1 or 2 yolks of eggs, and add a little cream. Use a very small quantity of this sauce to toss the rice in, and add a pinch of cheese to it, or if cheese is disliked, a little nutmeg. Now serve the chicken and sauce up, and hand the rice in a separate dish. In France the cooks usually cook chicken and rice together, and serve both in the same dish. It is less troublesome to cook, equally good, but makes a very untidy looking dish. 273.—Fried Chicken. Cut a roasted chicken into fillets and small joints • rub them with vinegar; sprinkle pepper, salt, and chopped herbs over them. Leave them for an hour; then wipe them, dip in frying batter, fry in boiling fat. Serve with fried parsley or any sauce liked.- N.B.—Eemains of cold boiled chickens can be used

The following “ menus,” and the recipes contained in this book, have, with a few exceptions, been carried out in a small household, with one cook, and without the assistance of a kitchenmaid. They may seem elaborate at first to those young housekeepers who are ignorant of cooking, and who think that fresh rolls, ices, and a variety of made dishes, must always be had from a confectioner. My advice is this: “ Do not serve at your table dishes that cannot be made at home.” The so-called plain cooking which exists in many English houses is extravagant cooking. A “ plain cook ” does not know how to use up her small scraps of meat, fish, or vegetables; she has little knowledge of soups or sauces, and has no notion that in throwing away a spoonful of gravy she is wasting the foundation of a good dish. A plain cook—I mean one who can roast and bake well—ought, with a few directions, to be able to makeFEE FACE. VI almost any disLi described in this book. She must have patience and pei'severance. So must her mistress. Slie must attend to the smallest details ; she must take as much pride in serving up a plain dish of rissoles as the most elaborate made dish. If a dish be too salt^ or too hot with pepper, it is a disgrace to the cook to send it to table, as she could, by a little contrivance, have remedied the defect and saved annoyance to her mistress. I am not giving directions for preparing meat, fish, roasting, etc., in this book; every mistress will provide her cook with a “ Mrs. Beeton ” or an “ Eliza Acton,” one of which no kitchen should be without. Where quantities are given in these recipes, those quantities must be carefully followed, as the success of a dish depends on the accuracy with which the directions are followed. The time for cooking certain dishes has intentionally not been given. A cook must understand her stove, and gradually calculate for herself the times required. The following dishes have been made on a close range in the winter, and on a Leoni’s gas-stove in the summer, and the time for cooking each dish has varied according to which stove was used. In stewing meats the cook must remember that they must simmer, and never boil. If they boil, the meat will be hard. The same with sauces or custardsVll PREFACE. in which there are yolks of eggs; if they boil they will curdle. Again, with frying, the directions must be followed absolutely; if they are not, the things fried will be hroivn, greasy, and indigestible. As the dishes come out from table, the cook must remove the remains of each dish, no matter how small, on to clean plates; the remains of gravy into jars. The next morning the mistress should find everything in order in her larder; she will at once see what remains, and give dh-ections how each article can be used. The sci’aps of meat and bones will be simmered down for stock or gravy, and on no account must the stock of yesterday be added to what is made to-day. Use some of to-day’s to lengthen out what was left yester- day, if necessary; but if you add ahuays yesterday’s stock to all that you are making fresh, you will have sour stock and gravy at the end of the week, and must not be astonished if your family have indigestion and are told by the doctor, “Never touch soups and sauces.” With gx'eat respect for the very variable views of the medical profession on the subject of wholesome food, I would suggest that “ never touch sour soups and sour sauces ” would express as much as their experience really justifies on this subject. The scraps of each day must, then, be used up each day, and not all collected together to make a sour con-Vlll PREFACE. coction at tlie end of the week. The scraps of meat —those not required for stock—will, used together make rissoles, savoury moulds, salads, curries, or “ gratins.” The scraps of vegetables will make a soup, a salad, a “ chartreuse,” a “ macedoine,” “ gratin,” or curry. The fish will make patties, curries, rissoles, “ gi’atins,” or a mayonnaise salad. If you wish to have wholesome cookery, make a rule never to have bottled sauces in the house. Your sauces must he made with fresh meat and vegetables. I make one exception in favour of mushroom ketchup (as it is not always possible to get mushrooms), though I think it is better to do without it, unless you make your own mushroom ketchup and bottle it in very small bottles, so as to use the contents of each bottle as soon as it is opened. Do not allow perquisites. Remember that roast- beef dripping and the skimmings from the " pot an feu ” are the best fats for frying; other drippings are also good (when properly prepared), and do not let your cook persuade you to the contrary. If you have not enough dripping, you must, of course, supplement it with the best olive oil, butter, or lard; but remember that lard is the least nice medium for frying in. In a household of five persons all told, and using on an average twenty-five shillingsworth of meat a week, of which one joint is a sirloin, there ought to be alwa}^sIX PREFACE. enough dripping for ordinary frying purposes. For instance, a sirloin of ten pounds will give about a pound of dripping; a leg of English mutton will give about tlmee-quarters of an ounce of dripping to every pound of meat; a shoulder will usually give rather more. Dripping and other fats, if properly clarified and kept in a cool place, can be used over and over again. The cook must have two jars of fat always ready for use— one which she will keep to fry her fish in, and one in which to fry her meats and vegetables. Impress economy on your cook, but let it be dis- tinctly understood that economy means knowing how to use things properly, and does not mean parsimony. Using stale eggs, commonly called “pudding eggs,” and salt butter for cooking is extravagant stinginess, and is not economy. The result will probably be a failure, while a different dish, with properly chosen but cheaper materials, would have been a success. It is not economical to give beefsteaks in the kitchen and use rumpsteaks in the parlour. A pound and a quarter of beefsteak will not go as far as a pound of rumpsteak; besides which, the beefsteak, usually tough, wiU have to be stewed, and that necessitates stock and vegetables. I do not advise “ locking up ” if you want to be really economical—I mean in the sense of measuring out spoonfuls of tea and lumps of sugar. Of course it is not advisable to leave out large quantities, such as a chest of tea or a bag of sugar. LetPREFACE. X there always he plenty in your cook’s charge, and make her responsible for it. It is wise to let your cook know your estimate of what a week’s feeding ought to cost. From twelve to fourteen shillings per head a week is ample, and you ought to be able to live exceedingly well on that. This is the calculation for a London household, where you have even to buy parsley. If the weekly books are higher than they should be, it is quite as often the fault of the mistress as of the cook. Carelessness in ordering is as great a fault as carelessness in con- suming. I often hear a mistress say, “ My cook has so little idea!” Where is she to get her ideas ? She may be twenty-five years old and have lived in four situations; her only ideas are what she has gathered in those previous situations. You, on the other hand, have lunched and dined out frequently, have probably travelled and dined at good restaurants'; your husband belongs to a club, and can give you the benefit of his experience; therefore it is you who ought to bring the ideas. The comfort and, I may say, health of your house depend on your knowledge, and the management of the detail of a house really takes very little time. An hour every morning is all that is required.PEEFACE. XI In ordering a dinnei*—I mean a dinner of several courses—use judgment. Your cook has only one pair of hands; so do not order several dishes that all require attendance at the same time. Do not, for instance,^ order three dishes running that require frying. In writing out your hills of fare, write them out in English, except, of course, in those cases where the dish is a purely foreign one. For instance, a “risotto,” a “ mayonnaise,” and other dishes of that sort cannot he translated into English, there being no equivalent for them. To translate “ saddle of mutton,” “ mint sauce,” or “plum-pudding” into French, or what is intended to he French, is a barbarism. I must apologize if I have occasionally betrayed the secret of some favourite dish revealed by a friend. I have learned I’ecipes or had suggestions for recipes from many sources, sometimes in a friend’s house, sometimes in small inns, especially in France and Italy, where the man or woman who waits at table is usually the cook of the establishment. MARIE DE JONCOURT. A^ril, 1882.PEEFACE TO FOUETH EDITION. I HA.VE been asked, in the event of a further edition of this book, to state quantities with some precision. It is true that in many places I have not stated quantities, but wherever they are not specified, it is because I do not think a precise statement of quantity will be any useful guide. There are dishes where quantities must be carefully Aveighed and measured; there are others where the quantities must depend on the season of the year, or the articles used, and also whether certain vegetables and flavours are liked or not; a tablespoonful of onion may be considered too much by one person, and not nearly enough by another. The cook must study the tastes of the people for whom she is cooking. Again, articles like carrots, turnips, onions, to- matoes, vary in flavour according to the season of the year, and they greatly vary in size. A hard-and- fast rule given as to the actual number of vegetables used is quite impossible.Xllt PnEFACE TO FOURTH EDITION. I have been told that where there is no close range or gas-stove, it is difficult to cook many dishes rcqiiiring to be slowly simmered. In that case, the cook should be provided with a set of different-smed French baking-dishes, with lids which have a hole at the top, to allow of the steam escaping, and the dish should be put in a moderately heated oven, where it will simmer as well as on the side of a close range. It has been suggested to me that “small joints,” for three or four persons, are not easily procured. I think that the difficulty is overrated. For instance, a sirloin may be reduced and economized as follows : Cut off the end, I mean the piece which curls up in roasting, this piece can be used for a small “pot au feu,” or slowly stewed with vegetables, or salted down. If the sirloin is still rather large, take a “ porter-house steak ” off it—this is a large beef chop taken off the face of the sirloin about 1^ inch thick, it is cut right through the siiloin lengthways, cutting through the under-cut, the bone, and the upper-cut. You have now a small sirloin for roasting. You can make a further reduction by taking out the under-cut, and u.sing it for boiled steaks, provided that you do not mind being left with only the upper-cut for roasting. You can reduce a leg of mutton by taking one or two slices off the thick end of the leg, cutting through the bone so as to obtain a slice about inch thick.xiv PREFAGE TO FOURTH EDITION. This slice can be used stewed with vegetables, or curried. If the mutton was well hung and very- tender, it can be broiled or fried in butter. If you want a small joint of veal, you can order two or three bones of loin of veal (in fact, loin chops not divided) for roasting; the shape is that of a small-sized sirloin of beef, and the weight is from 2i to 3^ pounds. The above are a few instances of simple expedients which any good housekeeper will easily learn to apply and multiply. MARIE DE JONCOURT.

Put in a large saucepan 6 or 7 pounds of silver side of the round of beef, 5 quarts of cold water. Before it begins to boil, skim it very carefully. When all the scum has been removed, add 5 turnips, 6 carrots, 1 leek, 2 parsnips, 2 large onions, 1 good bunch of parsle}'-, 1 bead of celery, 6 cloves, a few peppercorns, 1 ball of browning, salt to taste (about 2 tablespoonfuls for this quantity); simmer very slowly for 5 or 6 hours. Be- fore using, strain through a hair sieve. The beef is good hot or cold, but especially cold. This soup ought to be 'perfectly clear. If it is not so, it is either because some of the scum has not been removed, or principally because the soup has been allowed to hoil. If the beef is used hot, serve a piquante or tomato sauce with it, or thicken a little of the soup and serve that. The vegetables can be chopped, pressed into a mould, and turned out cold with a mayonnaise sauce. 2.—English Clear Soup. 3 to 4 pounds of gravy beef Cut the meat into pieces, and fry them in a little butter to colour them ;11 SOUPS. put them into 3 or 4 quarts of cold water, let them simmer, and skim carefully. When no scum is left, put into the saucepan 2 carrots, 2 turnips, half a head of celery, 1 bunch of savoury herbs, 4 cloves, 2 blades of mace, some peppercorns, and salt to taste. Simmer gently from 6 to 8 hours, strain through a hair sieve. Wlien cold, skim off any fat there may be. N.B.—Soup made in this manner should be perfectly clear. If a cook requires to “ clear ” her soup, as some do, with whites of eggs, etc,, it is only because she has not taken sufficient care at first with it. Her souj;> must simmer, and never boil. If once it boils, it will become thick and muddy. 3.—Francatelli’s Bonne Femme Soup. Chop up finely 1 cucumber, 4 lettuces, 1 onion, 1 handful of chervil; place these in a small saucepan with 2 ounces of butter, a little nutmeg, pepper, and salt; simmer gently for about 10 minutes, then add a tablespoonful of flour; moisten with 3 pints of veal stock, stir over the fire until the soup boils, then set it on one side to simmer; now stir into it very care- fully 6 yolks of eggs, half a pint of cream, and a small dessert-spoonful of sugar, N.B.—Some may think this soup an expensive one. It need not be so if the housekeeper will arrange to have for the previous day’s dinner a boiled knuckle of veal, or a dish of calves’ feet—2 are sufficient— as the12 WHOLESOME COOKERY. water in which they have been boiled is the proper stock for this soup. She can also arrange that her sweet, the clay she requires the soup, should he one necessitatiug whites of eggs. 4.—Macedonian Soup. Put at the bottom of a stewpan 2 slices of ham or a piece of lean bacon, then 2 carrots, 2 potatoes, 2 turnips, 2 onions, 1 head of celery, all cut up very small; add your stock; season with pepper and salt. Let it simmer very gently until all the vegetables are reduced to a pulp; if too thick, add a little stock before you finish simmering. Now rub it all through a hair sieve, and before dishing up add a little cream. 5.—Livonian Soup. Chop up, scald, and drain the following vegetables: —carrots, turnips, parsley, leeks, and onions. Fry them in butter; add a couple of small handfuls of scalded rice, and the quantity of stock you require. Let it simmer until quite done. Pass it through a sieve, add a small quantity of boiled cream, stir in a few yolks of eggs, and pour over some fried sippets. 6.—Italian Soup. Parboil separately some heads of celery, cabbage, carrots, turnips, and leeks; drain them and chop13 SOUFS. them up small; put them in a saucepan with butter, pepper, and salt; let them simmer gently; add stock and some finely chopped fowl livers; then add some previously boiled macaroni, some grated Parmesan cheese; simmer all together and serve. 7. —Macaroni Soup. Scald some macaroni in salt and water; put it in some good stock, and simmer till cpiite cooked; serve with grated Parmesan and Gruy^re cheeses. This makes a good and simple white macaroni soup, if milk and a little butter, pepper, and salt are used in place of the stock. 8. —Solferino Soup Is made with French beans, white haricot beans, new potatoes, young carrots, young green peas, a few spoonfuls of tomato pur^e, chopped parsley, chervil, celery, all thoroughly simmered in stock till quite cooked. Add in the tureen some fried sippets. I 9. —Peasant Soup. Chop cabbage, carrots, onions, and celery; toss them in butter a pale brown; add a little stock, and simmer very gently for 3 hours; now add some water that haricot beans or lentils have been cooked in, simmer another half-hour; now add some very finely chopped sorrel and lettuce; let it all come to a boil, and pour it into the tureen over some Med sippets.WHOLESOME COOKERY, li 10. —Lent Soup. 1 tablespoonful of cornflour, 1 small teacupful of milk; mix smooth, and add 1^ pint of veal stock; put it in a saucepan, stir it over the Are. Put 2 yolks of eggs in a cup, break them with a spoon. When the soup is no longer boiling, add a little by degrees to the yolks of eggs, and then stir it all into the soup- Now stir in a little cream or butter and serve. 11. —Oyster Soup. 1 dessert-spoonful of cornflour in a bason, mixed Avith a little cold milk and thoroughly blended without lumps; to this add 1 pint of good white stock, 1 gill of cream, salt and pepper. When it begins to simmer, drop in 1 dozen of oysters and simmer a few minutes. 12.—Chestnut Soup. Take the shells off" some chestnuts; put them in boiling water, until they can easily be peeled. Now let them simmer, but not boil, in your stock; flavour Avith pepper and salt. When quite cooked, pass all through a hair sieve, put it back on the Are, add a little cream, and serve with fried sippets. 13.—Fonds d’Artichauds Soup. The underparts of some French artichokes; boil them till done in some water in which you have blendedSOUPS. 16 a little flour, and flavoured with salt and lemon-juice. When cooked, mash them and add them to some good white stock, simmer together for some time, pass through a hair sieve, put hack on the fire, add some butter and cream, and serve. This soup is very good made with the canned artichokes, which are already cooked, and would not, of course, require boiling separately. 14. —White Sago Soup. 1J ounce of sago, 1 quart milk, salt, and pepper; boil it all together till the sago is cooked (if too thick add stock or water); add 1 ounce of butter, stir it into the soup, and serve. 15. —Brown Sago Soup. Proceed as above, only use stock instead of milk. 16.—Herb Soup. Wash 1 handful of sorrel, chop it up, put it in a saucepan -with 1 ounce of butter; stew for about half an hour, add water or stock or half milk and watei’, pepper and salt, and 1 teacupful of fine bread-crumbs. Stew from 1^ to 2 hours; beat 1 yolk of egg in the tureen; pour the hot soup over, stirring all the time with a wooden spoon. This recipe is good with lettuces and spinach mixed.WHOLESOME COOKERY. iG 17.—Soubise Soup. 1-J pint of water, half a pint of milk, IJ ounce of butter, 2 onions, 5 ounces of bread, the yolks of one or two eggs or 1 gill of cream, pepper and .salt to taste. Cut the bread into very thin slices, boil it in the water and milk, with the onions thinly sliced; add the butter, pepper, and salt; when thoroughly stewed to a pulp, rub through a wire sieve. Now set it again on the fire, and let it simmer for a few minutes, and just before sending it to table add the cream or the yolks 18.—Barley Soup. Half an ounce of butter, 1 dessert-spoonful of pre- pared barley blended together; add 1 pint of white stock or milk, fiavour with pepper and salt, boil together for 15 minutes, and serve with fried sippets.

When quite cooked, strain through a hair sieve, put it back on the fii-e, add a little milk and butter or cream. Serve with fried sippets.17 SOUFS. 20.—Tomato and Okra Soup. Take a tin of tlie puree of tomatoes, pass it tlirough a sieve, add equal quantity of water or stock or milk and water, a little onion and dried vegetables, pepper and salt, half a small tin of okras. Stew gently for three-quarters of an hour; add in at the last a small lump of butter. N.B.—This soup is, of course, excellent with fresh tomatoes and vegetables, but as a winter soup with canned and dried vegetables is strongly to be recom- mended. If preferred plain, leave out the okra, and thicken with bread-crumbs or sago or rice. 21.—Piedmontese Soup. Let some rice soak in hot water for about 1 hour; let a cabbage (broken in pieces) soak also in hot water and salt about the same time. Drain both rice and cabbage. Place them in a saucepan with butter or dripping, a chopped onion, pepper, salt, and nut- meg; add either water or stock or gravy. Let all this stew together for some time, and just before servmg add some grated Parmesan cheese. Another way.—Stew some half-cooked cabbages with carrots, onions, bunch of herbs, and plenty of butter. When nearly cooked, add some stock, or the water the cabbages have cooked in, and fine c18 WHOLESOME COOKERY. bread-crumbs. Let all stew for a few minutes, and add grated cheeses, Parmesan and Gruyk’e mixed. 22. —Conde Soup. Stew some red haricot beans with a few vegetables and stock. When thoroughly cooked and flavoured with pepper and salt, pass it all through a hair sieve; put it back for a few minutes on the Are, add a small lump of butter, and serve with fried sippets. N.B.—This soup can be made without meat stock. 23. —Lentil Soup. Made exactly like the above, using lentils instead of red haricot beans. 24. —Crecy Soup. Chop up some young and red carrots, put them in a saucepan with a lump of butter, add a pinch of sugar. Let this cook very gently, keeping the sauce- pan well covered, but occasionally stirring. Next add some stock and a raw peeled potato; simmer veiy gently; flavour, of course, with pepper and salt. Now pass through a hair sieve, put it back on the fire, add some stock, let it come to one boil, and seive with fried sippets. Another way.—0\xi into pieces some carrots, turnips, onions, and celery. Scald them in boiling water, strain19 S0UP8. them, and put them on a slow fii-e with a good lump of butter, a couple of thin slices of ham and your stock; pass thi’ough a hair sieve after it has cooked a short time. Now put it all back on the fire, and let it stew gently for two hours; skim it carefully and serve with sippets. A third way is to add rice after the above has been through a hair sieve, and dispense Avith the sippets. 25.—Faubomie Soup. Cut in shreds some lettuces, sorrel, and celery ; toss them in 1 ounce of butter with some small onions (previously scalded), add your stock, fiavour with pepper and salt, stew till cooked. At the last moment add a purde of peas and serve. 26.—Julienne Soup. 3 carrots, 3 turnips, Avhite part of 3 lieads of celery, some leeks, and a little onion. Cut all these into thin shreds, and put them into a stewpan Avith 2 ounces of butter, a little salt, a small lump of sugar ; stir lightly over the fire, and fry of a light colon)’. Then place it in a saucepan Avith your stock, set it to simmer, and remove all the scum very carefully as it rises; add 2 cabbage lettuces, a little tarragon and chervil, a little sorrel.

It must be about as thick as pea soup. A little cream added to it is an improvement. If there are no bones or stock, make this soup with half milk and half water, and after the soup has been strained, and just before dishing it up, stir in 1 ounce of butter. 41. —Monaco Soup. Fry some nicely shaped pieces of bread in butter a pale brown, sprinkle them with salt and pepper, place them in the bottom of a tureen.

Bake half an hour to 40 minutes. Have some of the same gravy at hand to baste with and prevent it drying at the top. To make a sole “ au gratin ” you proceed as above, but sprinkle raspings of bread under and above, and flnish by placing some lumps of butter on the top. You also use untliickened gravy. N.B.—Mussels are used in this dish, either as well as or in place of oysters. Another rvatj.—Wipe the sole well; brush it over with egg; sprinkle it with finely chopped parsley, mixed with fine bread-crumbs and seasoned with pepper and salt. Now melt some butter (4 ounces is sufficient for a 2 pound sole); pour it over the sole very gently, so as not to remove the bread-crumbs and7 30 WHOLESOME COOKERY. parsley. Bake for three-quarters of an hour. Have ready in saucepan about a quarter of a pint of good gravy, in which j^ou have put in a little lemon- juice, 1 spoonful of ketchup, 1 wineglassful of sherry. Then remove the sole to another dish, and add the liquor from the fish to this sauce. Simmer it all together for a few minutes and pour it round the sole. It is a great improvement to this dish to add mush- ■^ooms or oyster.s, or both, and mussels if liked. 54.—Soles “a la Orly.” Sprinkle pepper and salt over the fillets, squeeze some lemon-juice over them, and leave them on one side. Put the bones and trimmings of the soles in a saucepan, with white wine, pepper, salt, and a few herbs; stew for half an hour, then strain.

When half cooked, turn them over carefully and cook on the other side; then take them out, put them to drain. Then into the sauce put some slices of truffles or mushrooms, and stew them; add a little butter if necessary. Dish up the fish with the mushrooms and fried sippets. N.B.—Soles may be cooked in this way. 67.—Baked Whitings. Butter a dish; spread on this butter some finely chopped parsley, and a little onion, salt, and a little nutmeg; then place the whitings (boned whitings are preferable). Pour some hot butter over them, then equal quantities of white wine and stock. Put this dish in the oven, or on the top of your stove, with a cover over. When half cooked, turn the fish over carefully. When quite cooked, pour the sauce into a saucepan without disturbing the fish; add some butter and fiour; simmer till thick, then add pepper and some lemon-juice. Pour the sauce back over the fish and serve in the dish the whitings are cooked in. 58.—Buttered Whitings. Sprinkle a little pepper and .salt over the whitings, flour them thoroughly on both sides, place some butter on a gratin dish, lay the whitings upon it, and put them into a hot oven. Let them cook for some82 WHOLESOME COOKERY. minutes, then turn them carefully. Squeeze a little lemon-juice over them. The whitings must be a rich gold colour, and the butter brown, not black. Mackerels, herrings, soles, filleted haddocks, etc., can be cooked in this manner. 68a.—Broiled Whitings. Sprinkle them with pepper and salt, and pour over a little oil. Leave them for an hour or two, then broil them before the fire; turn them frequently; serve over them any sauce liked. 69.—Cod “ a la Creme.” Boil a nice piece of cod, either fresh cod or very slightly salted, in boiling water.

Slightly salted cod may be cooked as above. 61.—Bouille a Baisse. Take a variety of fishes, such as mullet, whiting, soles, haddock—a small lobster if shell-fish is liked; cut them in pieces. Put in a wide and tolerably shallow saucepan a wine-glass of oil, 1 chopped onion, a bay leaf, a clove of garlic; toss all this together. Then place your pieces of fish in; add some salt to taste, a few slices of lemon, a few slices of tomato, a pinch of powdered saffron, a glass of white light wine ; add enough water to cover the fish; boil up quickly on a hot fire. The fish ought to be cooked in a quai’ter of an hour, and the gravy sufficiently reduced. Take the- fish out, strain the sauce, put it back on the fire ; add a spoonful of finely chopped parsley, and a very little flour (not enough to make the sauce thick, but enough to prevent it being quite thin); place some slices- of French I’oll in a deep dish; pom- the sauce over.. Place the fish in another dish, and serve the two- dishes together. N.B.—Of course the true bouille a baisse is mado- D34 WHOLESOME COOKERY. from the fishes found in the Mediterranean, and those who want to eat it in perfection must go to Rouhion’s, at Marseilles; but a very good attempt at bouille a baisse can be eaten in England if the above directions are followed. 62.—Middle Cut of Cod. Make a stuffing of bread-crumbs, parsley, onion chopped very fine, pepper, salt, and butter; moisten Avith an egg or milk, cook it slightly, and put it in the open part of cod; fix with skewers; rub the fish with a beaten-up egg; strew over bread-crumbs, pepper, and salt.

N.B.—Unless the cauliflower is divided into layers it will not be good, as the sauce must cover every portion. It is also a great mistake to simply sprinkle cheese over the top; some must be mixed in the sauce too. For those who do not like cheese, a cauliflower can be prepared in this manner with a plain melted butter, leaving out the cheese.62 WHOLESOME COOKERY. i 141.—Cauliflower Fritters.

Now pour on this some of the slightly warmed aspic; let it set, then place some more chicken, egg, gherkin, cold aspic, etc., and continue until the mould is full. Place it in a cold place; and turn out when quite set. In placing the garnish inside the mould, be careful that no pieces touch the side of the mould, or the jelly will break at that point when turned out. N.B.—A simpler way is to pour the meat jelly into a border mould, and when set and turned out, fill the vacant space with a mayonnaise of fish, meat, or vegetables. 303.—Ragout a la Fiuanciere. Cut a shoe of raw ham in very small pieces; put it in a stewpan, with a bunch of herbs, a mushroom, glass of white wine, glass of stock, and some pepper.

To prepare the caramel, put 5 ounces of loaf sugar, with 2 tablespoonfuls of water, in a warm mould. Melt it over the fire until the sugar and water form a golden-coloured thick syrup; take it off the fire, and turn your mould round and round until the caramel has gradually worked itself over the whole inside of the mould and forms a casing. Dip the outside of the mould in cold water: this has the effect of making the sugar set. Now mix 1 pint of boiling milk to G well-beaten eggs, add sugar and vanilla to taste ; then pour it cold into the mould, and steam it for 2(? minutes. Let it get cold, and serve turned out. 327.—Creme Brulee (Cold). Boil 1 pint of cream for 1 minute; pour it on the yolks of 4 eggs well beaten.

If, when served, there is an appearance of water at the bottom of the dish, it is because the custard has been allowed to bake too fast and too much. This custard can be steamed and served in the same dish. 339. —Boiled Chocolate Custard Is made like any ordinary boiled custard. You simply leave out all other flavouring, and add 2 ounces of grated chocolate to the milk when you boil it. 340. —Boiled Coffee Custard Is made like any ordinary boiled custard.

Place all in a deep pie-dish and bake till quite set. Must be done very slowly. Serve cold. When the spoon is put in the dish it ought to come out with a cream upon it; if it does not, the pudding has not succeeded. 360.—Caramel Semolina Mould. Prepared exactly like the Caramel rice (358). 361.—Plain Souffle. 3 yolks of eggs well beaten; 3 whites of eggs, also well beaten; 2 ounces of potato flour (Groult’s), 1 ounce of butter, 1-| ounce of castor sugar and a little finelySWEETS. 110 chopped ]emou-peel, quarter of a pint of milk.

Let this paste stand two or three hours before using it. Now put in a deep stewpan some fat, clarified lard, or dripping; when it boils completely, dip a teaspoon in it, and then take half a teaspoonful of the batter and drop it into the fat. Continue until you have used ujd all the batter. Each fritter will be cooked when it is a rich gold colour and swollen to the size of an apricot. The reason you dip the teaspoon in the boiling fat is to cause the batter to slip easily off the spoon. Serve the fritters on a d’oyley with castor sugar sprinkled over. 366.—Canadian Pudding. Make a custard with half a pint of milk, 4 yolks of eggs, and a little sugar. Boil 2 tablespoonfuls of corn flour in pint of milk with a little sugar ; let it get cool.

Make exactly like the cofiee ice, but leave out the cofiee; use an extra half-pint of milk and some essence of vanilla. 389. —Fruit Cream Ice. Pound any fruit liked with ■ sifted. sugar; rub it through a sieve; add cream. Put it in a mould and freeze. 390. —Parfait au Cafe. Boil 1 pint of milk; take it off the fire, and stir in 1 pint of strong coffee. Now put in a saucepan 8 yolks of eggs and 10 ounces of sugar. Stir the milk in. Place the saucepan on the fire, and whisk the mixture until it is just on the boil; then take it off the fire, let it become cold, and strain it. Put it in a mould and freeze it. When half frozen, stir in a wine-glassful of cura(;oa or rum; finish freezing it. Serve immediately on a d’oyley.154 WHOLESOME COOKERY. 391.—Iced Souffle. Mix in a saucepan 6 yolks of eggs, with 4 ounces of clai'ified sugar. Whisk this over the fire until it nearly boils; take it ofi" the fire at once. Continue whisking till the mixture is nearly cold. Add to it 1 quart of whisked double cream and a glass of rum or cura5oa; continue whisking until all is thoroughly mixed. Have your souffle lining standing on ice, so as tc get it thoroughly cold; this is important. Fix a band of paper about 2 inches above the dish; pour in the mixture, almost as high as the paper; cover the mould completely, and embed it in ice and salt. 2 hours’ freezing is about the time it will take. Then take off the paper, strew biscuit powder lightly on the top, and serve. Souffles can be fiavoured with the juice of fruit, or coffee, or chocolate, or vanilla, etc. N.B.—The souffle must be embedded in the ice and salt as soon as it is mixed, and placed in the lining.( 155 ) SAVOURY DISHES. 392.—Ham Toast. Put some very finely minced ham in a saucepan, with a little gravy, a few bread-crumbs, and a little cream, if you have it; let it simmer till quite hot, and serve it on buttered toast. 393. —Marrow Toast. Break a marrow-bone; take out the marrow, and cut it into small pieces. Put the marrow into boiling water with a little salt, and boil it one minute so as to half cook it; then drain it immediately on a sieve.

Let it cool; then add the beaten yolks of 4 eggs; at the very last add 4 whites of eggs well whisked. Flavour with pepper and salt; bake half an hour, and serve at once. 407. —Hot Sandwiches. Bone, skin, and pound some sardine.s with a little anchovy paste and butter and lemon-juice. Have some thin slices of bread and buttei', and lay the paste between two slices to form a sandwich; then fry each sandwich, and serve them up hot. 408. —Savoury Oysters. Beard them; sprinkle them with pepper, salt, and lemon-juice; wrap each oyster in a very thin slice of fat bacon; skewer them and cook them before the fire. Serve on toast or fried sippets. 409.—Cold Anchovy Toast. Cut some slices of bread into equal sizes and fry them in oil; place them on a dish; lay some fillets of anchovy or sardine on each piece. Now add to the oil you fried the bread in, some minced .shallot, par.sley,16t S4.V0URY DISHES. M thymCj a bay leaf, pepper, and a little vinegar. Boil this together; strain it; pour over the toasts, and serve them when they are cold. 410.—Sardine Toast. Pound a few honed and shinned sardines (say 4) with 1 teaspoonful of gravy, 1 ounce of butter, and pepper. Make it hot, and serve on fried sippets or buttered toast. 411.—Anchovy Toast. Butter some toast; spread a little anchovy paste over. Now put the weU-beaten yolks of 2 eggs in a saucepan, with a quarter of a pint of cream; set it to thicken over the fire, but not to boil. Season with cayenne; pour it over the toast (which ought to have been kept hot), and serve. N.B.—A pinch of grated cheese added to the sauce is considered by some an improvement. Of course, it must be cooked with the sauce. Another %oay.—3 ounces of butter, 1 teaspoonful of anchovy paste, a little pepper, half a pint of cream. Simmer till thick with 1 teaspoonful of flour. Pour it over some buttered toast, and serve very hot. This quantity makes enough for ten persons. Milk can bo used in place of cream, but the toast is, of course, not so good.163 WHOLESOME COOKERY. 3 pounds of flour instead of 4 pounds. BREAD, ETC. 412.—Bread. Flour, 4 pounds; German yeast, 1 ounce; about a quarter of an ounce of salt; water, 1 pint. Put the flour and salt into a good-sized earthen pan; cover with a cloth, and put before the fii'e to get wai’m. Then make a hole in the middle large enough to hold a pint of water. Mix the yeast in the water, which must be warm, not hot; rub it down till the yeast and water are thoroughly mixed—no lumps—then pour it into the hole in the flour, and sprinkle some of the flour over the hole so as to make it perfectly invisible. Cover with the cloth, and set by the Are again. Let it stand there till the flour over the hole cracks in more than one place; then work it up into a light dough. Be very particular to use only the tips of the fingers. Knead it well till you see little air bubbles; then set it by the fire again for a little while, till it feels very light to the touch. You may now tear pieces off {do not cut with a knife). Make into what shape or size you wish. Put it on a floured tin in the oven—not too hot a one. Bake till the loaves rise, crack, and are a good colour. When taken out of the oven, thi’ow a cloth over to keep them in. If required lighter, tryBREAD, ETO. 163 413.—Home-made Bread quickly made. Mix very thoroughly one heaped-up teaspoonful of Yeatman’s yeast powder with 1 pound of Himgarian flour and a little salt; pour on half a pint of cold milk or water; make it into a loaf, or put it in a tin, and immediately into a hot oven. Bake. When the bread has risen, open the oven door for a minute to let out the steam. This dough does not require much kneading. 414.—Home-made Rolls quickly made. 1 quart of flour, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 2 teaspoon- fuls of Yeatman’s yeast powder, 1 tablespoonful of butter, and about 1 pint of milk, not more. Mix the flour, salt, and powder thoroughly together; rub in the butter, add the milk; work it into a firm dough. Flour the board; knead the dough on it two or three times very quickly. Divide it into nicely shaped round pieces; lay them on a greased baking-tin, wash them over with milk, and bake in a hot oven. Will take about 15 minutes. Must be baked as soon as made. 415.—Vienna Rolls. Mix 1 ounce of dry German yeast with 1 ounce of pounded sugar and 2 ounces of butter; then stir into it 1 pint of warm milk.

Rub the sugar and butter together to a white cream; add the eggs two at a time—beat 3 or 4 minutes between each. Have all the other ingredients well mixed together, and then add them to the sugar, butter, and eggs. Mix all firmly together. Have a shallow tin lined with a greased paper; pour in the mixture and bake in a moderate oven. Will take about hour.BREAD, ETC. 167 422.—Directions for Oyster Patties Paste. Strain the juice of 1 lemon in 1 gill of water (cold). Beat 1 egg to a stiff froth, and mix with above. Put three-quarters of a pound of dried flour into a bowl, and stir in the above liquid; knead it to a smooth paste. Lay it on a slab, and spread over it three-quarters of a pound of fresh butter. Turn over the four sides ; dredge with flour and roll it out four times ; then fold it in three and let it stand in a cool place for 2 hours. Have ready two round paste-cutters, one 2^ inches across, the other 1^ inch. Boll out the paste a third of an inch thick and make your patties. The stewed oysters must be put in after the patties have been baked. 423.—Directions and Proportions for Pastry. 12 ounces of flour, ounces lard, ounces of butter, 1 teacupful of water, and a little salt. Mix the lard and flour together; rub it with the fingers (not the hands) as lightly as possible and as quickly as you can; add the water, and work it lightly into a paste. Roll the paste out, and spread upon it one-third of the butter; roll it again and spread again one-third of butter; do this again, when all the butter ■svill be used. Double it over and put it in a bowl, and let it stand for 2 hours before cutting for use. N.B.—The more you roll it the heavier the paste will become; so take care.WHOLESOME COOKERY. las SUNDEIES. 424.—Quince Jam or Cheese. Slice the quinces (after they are peeled and cored). Put them in a stewpan, with sufficient water for them to float; stir carefully from the bottom; stew till reduced to a pulp, then weigh the pulp. Add three- quarters of a pound of sugar to each pound of pulp, and stew till set. Put in pots and cover tightly. N.B.—3 or 4 apples to every 12 quinces is by some considered an improvement. Some boil the quince seeds and peel in the water, then strain it and use it with the quinces instead of plain water. If put in moulds, the quince can be turned out, and served as a sweet with custard or cream poured round it. 435.—Pickled Lemons. Wipe 6 lemons; cut each lemon into 8 pieces; put on them a pound of salt, 6 cloves of garlic, 2 ounces of horse-radish thinly sliced, 2 ounces of cloves, 2 ounces of mace, 2 ounces of mustard, quarter of an ounce of grated nutmeg, quarter of an ounce of cayenne, 2169- SUNDRIES. quarts of vinegar. Put all this in a large jar; place the jar at the side of the fire, or in a saucepan of boiling water, and let it simmer till you think the lemons are cooked; then take it off. When cold, cover it with a lid which fits. Stir every day for 6 weeks. Put it into small bottles; cover them tightly, and keep for use. 426.—To make Coffee (French Fashion). For^each small coffee-cupful of water allow half am ounce of coffee. Put the coffee in the upper part of the coffee-pot (the ordinary French cafeti^re, which is made in tin and in china); pour the boiling water over, and let it stand till the water has run through. Must be as clear as wine. Be sure to lift off that part of the coffee-pot which holds the grains before you move the coffee-pot, or you may get a little coffee grounds shaken into the coffee. There is no excuse for not always having good coffee, provided two things are remembered: 1st. That the coffee provided must be coffee and not chicory. 2nd. That the cook must measure the water and weigh the coffee on each occasion : if she once attempts to guess at her quan- tities, bad coffee will be the result. It is better always to roast and grind the coffee at home, which is easily done. Put the beans on a baking tin in the oven, each bean separately; leave them about 10- minutes, or until they are a rich brown. I alwa^ys170 WHOLESOME COOKERY. roast each day the coffee which is required for that day. If there is any coffee not used, it ought not to he thrown away. The coffee will keep if put in a bottle at once and tightly corked. It can then be used for a coffee custard or cream. 427.—To make Coffee (Turkish Fashion). Grind the coffee very fine. Take the same propor- tions you would for French-made coffee (perhaps rather more water to allow of boiling away). Put the water into a saucepan, with a lump of sugar; when boiling hard, throw in the coffee; let it come to a boil. Lift it off the fire as soon as it bubbles, then put it on the fire again; lift it oft’ as soon as it bubbles; do this a third time. Now throw in a spoonful of cold filtered water to settle the grounds; leave it quiet one minute, and pour carefully into cups. Will have a thick yellow froth at the top. Serve Avithout milk. The coffee, as usual, to be freshly roasted, and on this occasion ground. 428.—To make Chocolate. Cut up 1 tablet of chocolate in very small pieces, blend it in a little hot water or hot milk; then add enough hot water or hot milk to make up a breakfast cup. Boil 2 or 3 minutes, stfiring aU the time. N.B.—Some people find chocolate made with milk171 SUNBmES. alone does not agree witli them. In those cases use water, and add a little cold milk when you drink it. I find the best chocolate for this purpose is that of the Compagnie Coloniale, ivithout vanilla. 429.—Meat Tea. Take 1 pound of lean beef, mutton, or chicken. Cut it into very small pieces; put it in a jar with 1 pint of cold water; put the jar in a saucepan of cold Avater, and let it gradually become warm, and let it simmer for 3 or 4 hours. It must not boil. Pass it through a hair sieve; flavour with salt, and, if liked, pepper. This meat tea can be taken plain, or thick- ened with sago, arrowroot, or bread-crumbs; or a little cream can be stirred in, or a couple of yolks of eggs, if the patient is allowed eggs. 430.—Barley Cream. 1 pound of veal. Skin it, and remove all fat; cut it in pieces, and put it in 1 quart of cold Avater and 1 ounce of barley. Simmer it slowly tiU it is reduced to 1 pint. Strain the liquor through a sieve, and then rub the meat and barley through a sieve. Add the liquor to it; it ought to be of the consistency of thick cream. Add salt to taste; and if the patient is allowed cream, a tablespoonful of cream well beaten in is an improvement.172 WHOLESOME COOKERY. 431.—Panade. Cut up small 2 pounds of juicy rumpstealc, or a ■whole fowl, or a pheasant (freshly killed). Put it in a jar ; cover this jar tightly -with a paper, and prick a few holes into the paper. Place the jar in a saucepan of cold water; the water ought to reach nearly to the top of the jar, hut not sufficiently to come over. Fit the lid of the saucepan very tightly on, and let it simmer gently nearly all day. Pour off the small quantity of liquid which will have been extracted from the meat, and let it stand for the fat to rise and be removed. Now take the meat, pound it in a mortar, and run it through a sieve into the liquid. Add a little salt. Will be about the consistency of thick cream, and is easily digested. Can be used hot or cold. 432.—Potted Meat. Cut some fresh rumpsteak into small pieces; put it all, fat and lean, into a jar with half a teacupful of water. Put the jar in a saucepan of water; cover the jar up tight, and let the contents simmer till quite tender. Pound it now in a mortar, adding its own gra^vy by degrees ; flavour with pepper and salt. Place it in jars, and cover with hot melted butter, if it is to be kept any time. This potted meat is excellent used for sandwiches, but it is better to make only a small quantity at a time.173 SUNDUmS. 433.—Orange Marmalade. Weigh the oranges, and cut them in halves or quarters. Take the peel off eaeh half or quarter. Take the pips and skin from the fruit, and press it through a hair sieve. Soak the peel all night in water slightly - salted; next day hoil it in cold water, changing the water frequently. When the peel is soft, take it out; let it drain, then cut it into shreds or long strips. Now put the peel and the strained pulj) into water (allow half a pint of water to each pound of fruit); add sugar (1 pound to each pound of fruit), a little grated lemon-peel. Boil all together until it is thick and clear. Put it into well-covered jars; keep some months before using. Will take from half to 1 hour to hoil. 434.—To prepare Dripping for Use. Put the dripping in a saucepan; hoil it over a sloAV fire for a few minutes ; skim it carefully; let it .stand to cool a little. Have a jar with some cold water at the bottom; place a muslin over the top; pour the dripping through. When cold and set, remove the dripping from the water into another jar. N.B.—Dripping ought to he clarified as above each time it has been used ; and it can be used very many times, especially if you occasionally add a little fresh dripping.174 WHOLESOME COOKERY. 435.—Hints for Frying. There must be a quantity of fat in the pan; the fat must be as hot as possible; it must smoke before it is ready for use. The things fried must be the colour of biscuits, and must be dry. If they are not, it is because there is not enough fat, or because it is not hot enough. The fat must always be clear, and have no specks; the same fat can be used frequently, and must be clarified always before using it again. 436.—To keep Butter for Winter Use. Put the butter, which must be quite fresh and without salt, in a large stewpan; let it gradually warm by the side of the fire for 1 or even 2 hours; if necessary, skim it. Now pour it into earthenware jars, taking care to leave the sediment in the pan, and not on any account to pour any into the jar. Cover the pots carefully, as you would jam, and keep for use. N.B.—When butter is very cheap, instead of salt- ing it and keeping it for winter cooking, it is very much better to proceed as above. Salt butter is not nice for cooking; I cannot repeat this too often. 437.—Proportions for Frying Batter. 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, 1 yolk of egg, 1 spoonful of salad oil, 2 tablespoonfuls of mUk. Stir it up175 SUNDBIE8. thoroughly; then add a tablespoonful of "water, pepper, and salt. Let it stand for some hours, or indeed till next day. Before using it, whisk up 2 whites of egg to a stiff froth, and beat it in. (Another way is to use "vinegai' or brandy instead of the water.) Dip the pieces of meat or vegetable or fruit into this batter, then drop into boiling fat, and fry very dry and crisp. 438.—To beat Whites of Eggs quickly and stiffly. With the whites add a pinch of salt, and use a flat dish; beat with a large steel knife, and always in the same direction. Must be used at once. 439.—To chop Parsley fine. Wash it, and dry it thoroughly before chopping it; if it is chopped damp, it sticks to the knife. 440.—Cock-Tail. 1 liqueur-glass of gin or brandy, IJ ditto ot water, small quantity of Angustura bitters, a little lemon or fresh lime juice, sugar to taste. Whisk all up together. A little crushed ice is an improvement; but if ice be used, 1 liqueur-glass of water is sufficient. 441.—Plantagenet Liqueur. Mix 1 bottle of brandy with 2 bottles best green ginger wine; bottle the mixture, and cork it tightly down.WHOLESOME COOKERY. 176 442.—Suggestions for Different Salads. Frencli beans, or cauliflowers, or a white cabbage, •or the tops of asparagus, or celery, or beetroot and celery combined, when cooked and cold, make ex- cellent salads, either alone or together, if simply dressed with oil, vinegar, pepper, and salt in proper propor- tions. Meat cut into fine shreds, with a few chopped pickles, and dressed with a mayonnaise sauce (the recipe of which is given in all cookery books), or cold fish dressed with the same sauce, are also excellent cold dishes. 443. —Indian Chutnee. Cold cooked potatoes. Mash them up very smooth; add some chopped green chili, and onions chopped small, salt, and lemon-juice. Mix all thoroughly together; put it in a small mould, press it tight, and turn it out to serve with curry. N.B.—The chili and onion must be chopped very fine. Raw tomatoes can be used instead of potatoes. 444, —Soup “ Joubert.” Have ready IJ quart of boiling pot au feu, or English clear soup; beat up 2 eggs; blend 1 tea- spoonful of flour with enough water to make it smooth; add it to the eggs, and beat again well.177 SUNDIUES. Next pour it into the boiling soup, stir while you are 'pouring, and cook it for 10 minutes, stirring con- tinuously. 445.—Neapolitan Vegetable Soup. 2 pounds of ripe tomatoes, 5 large peeled potatoes, a handful of washed and picked sorrel. Boil all this in about 2J pints of water, with a little salt. When the vegetables are thoroughly cooked, pass it all through a sieve, put it back on the fire, with 1^ to 2 ounces of butter, three-quarters of an ounce of loaf sugar season with pepper and salt; simmer for a few minutes. Have some small pieces of bread fried in butter, place them in the tureen, and pour the soup over them. 446.—Tomato and Marrow Soup. 1^ pound of tomatoes, 1 marrow, 2 large Spanish onions. Cut them in slices, and toss them in 2 table- spoonfuls of fresh dripping, add half a pint of water, pepper and salt to taste. Simmer about 3 hours; pass through a sieve; add 1 to 2 ounces of butter, 1 gUl of cream, and 1 teacupful of milk. Simmer a few minutes again. O 447.—Vendange Soup. 1 good-sized cabbage (white), 3 large carrots, 2 Spanish onions, large ones. Cut all these into shreds. N178 WHOLESOME COOKERY. Fry them all together in about 2 ounces of dripping; leave them all together to simmer slowly for about half an hour; then add in the same saucepan 1 pint of milk, 3 pints of water. Cut some stale bread in very thin slices, add them to the other things, with a teacupful of gravy (or half a teaspoonful of Liebig’s extract of beef), dessert-spoonful of salt and pepper to taste. Simmer together for 2^ hours. The result is a very thick, palatable, plebeian soup. 448.—Cauliflower Soup. Scald a cauliflower for a few minutes in boihng water, with a little salt; throw the water away, and drain the cauliflower.

Put the water in a saucepan with the butter and cheese; stir this over the fire until it begins to boil; add the flour in by slow degi’ees, stirring all the time with a wooden spoon until it forms a very thick paste; it must boil a few minute.s, working it all the time. Pour it into a bowl to cool, then add the 3 eggs one after the other, taking at least 3 minutes to work each egg in. Then let it stand for a few hours. Put some well-clarified dripping into a deep stew- pan ; when it boils, move it to the side of the fire. Take half a teaspoonful of the mixture, no more, and drop it in the boiling fat; do this until all the paste- is used; fry a light gold colour, and as each fritter isSUNDSIJiS. 201 cooked remove it. The fritters should swell to the size of a lai’ge apricot, and must be eaten without delay. The above quantity will make sufficient fritters for 12 persons. If the fritters do not swell, it is either because the paste has not been properly mixed, or the fat is not the right heat. The fritters can be warmed up next day in the oven. The dripping must be saved for this special use, it will give a cheese flavour if used for any other purpose. 503.—Cold Pate. Dish required, one of the French brown baking- dishes with a lid; be careful to see that the small hole in the lid is clear, so that the steam can escape. The quantity of material must depend on the size of the dish; one holding 2 pounds of meat chopped is a useful size. Have some raw fillet steak ; raw fillet of veal and a small piece of pork off* the loin is best, in equal quantities. Remove all the skin, gi’istle, or hard bits ; chop them up all fine, and mince them in a mincing- machine next, or pound them.

Now place some more strips in the same way, and then meat, and continue doing so until the dish is full, finish with another layer of the strips, and then 2 whole bay leaves. Next put the lid on; then make a paste with flour and water, and put a strip round where the lid fits on the dish, so as to keep it tight down. See again that the hole in the lid is quite clear. Bake 2^ hours in a moderate oven; leave it to get quite cold. Eemove the lid; then take away the two bay leaves. This dish can either be turned out, covered and decorated with a good aspic jelly, or it can be served in its own dish, and covered with aspic jelly. N.B.—To ascertain whether the meat is sufficientl3>- seasoned before placing it in the dish, cook half a tea- spoonful in a small tin, and taste it. N.B.—This dish can be made with hare, or game, or chicken and ham (ham must be cooked first), or chicken livers, alone or mixed with veal.

N.B.—Livers vary much in weight; it is therefore necessary to specify about the size required. 607.—Sheep’s Heads. 2 heads; remove the brains and tongue from the heads, clean them thoroughly by soaking them in warm water until they are (piite free from blood, then soak them in cold water for a short time.SUNDBIES. 205 Now put the heads and tongues in 3 quarts of cold water, let it come to a boil, and then skim thoroughly ; next put in 2 carrots, 2 turnips, 1 onion, 3 pepper- corns, and about 1 tablespoonful of salt. Simmer gently for 2j hours; take out the heads and tongues, and strain the stock. Cut the vegetables into small pieces; put them back on the fire with the stock; add teacupful of barley; let all simmer together for 1^ hour, when the broth ought to be finished. Save some of the stock after it has been strained; boil the brains in it for 5 minutes. Remove the bones fi’om the head, and cut the meat into pieces, all of about the same size; skin the tongue and cut it into lengths ; cut the brains in halves ; toss the brains for a few minutes in some butter until they are slightly brown. Next arrange all the pieces of head, tongue, and brains, on a baking-dish; now pour the stock in which you boiled the brains into the frying-pan where you tossed the brains; boil it up for a minute or two, pour it over the baking-dish, and bake for about 20 minutes. N.B.—This dish can be improved and varied by adding a few mushrooms, or sliced tomatoes, chopped herbs, placing some raspings and small lumps of butter, and baking all together. N.B.—A very profitable way of using sheep’s heads is to have 3. Use the broth as before; use the meat off the 3 heads in the way already mentioned; keep the tongues,206 WHOLESOME COOKERY. and serve them according to 258 or 259, or with tomato or piquante sauce. And dress the brains separately in any of the ways mentioned (251 to 254). In this way 3 sheep’s heads will give you 4 different dishes. 508. —Chicken and Chestnuts. Have a plump chicken; 4 ounces of fresh breast of pork; cut in small squares. Put 8 ounces of butter in a saucepan; toss the chicken and pork in the butter. When they are coloured light brown, remove them, and thicken the butter with 2 tablespoonfuLs of flour ; put the chicken and pork back in the sauce- pan ; pepper and salt to taste ; add 4 ounces of force- meat balls, and simmer for 1 hour; then add 20 to 30 roasted and peeled chestnuts, and simmer for another half-hour. The quantity of butter is for a small chicken. 509. —Stewed Chicken Livers.

Split the pigeons in half; toss them in butter to brown them; leave them in the stewpan with the butter; add some more butter and some very finely chopped onion; cover the stewpan up very tightly, and let the pigeons simmer very gently by the side of the fire for 2 hours. Serve them up with the butter they have simmered in; the onions ought to have quite disappeared. The quantity of butter and onion will depend on the number of pigeons used. About 1 ounce of butter, half a Spanish onion to 1 pigeon will be about right. 513.—Veal Curry. Put 2 ounces of butter in a stewpan with 2 onions cut small; when the onions are fried a golden colour,.208 WHOLESOME COOKERY. strain them from the buttei’, and put them on one side. Put the butter back in the stewpan and add about 1^ pound of veal cut very small, and 2 table- spoonfuls of curry paste, fry this also a golden colour.

Cut the legs off a hare, then cut as many fillets off the body of the hare as you can, keep them as much as possible the same shape; then, with a larding needle, run a few strips of larding bacon through each fillet. Put the bones in a stewpan, with 1 Spanish onion, 1 sprig of thyme, 1 pint of stock, pepper and salt to taste, 1 teaspoonful of chopped parsley, 1 pint of ■stock; stew this slowly for 3 hours at least; then strain the sauce; blend 1 ounce of butter with 1 tablespoonful of fiour; put it on the fire with the pre- viously made and strained gravy; 1 wine-glassful of ketchup, 1 wine-glassful of red wine, 1 piece of glaze the size of a walnut; put in the fillets, and place upon them a few pieces more of the fat larding bacon; simmer gently half an hour with the lid on; taste the gravy; if it does not seem sufficiently flavoured, add pepper and salt, and a few more pinches of herbs and209 SUNBUmS. onion, tied in a muslin, so that you can remove them easily; simmer slowly another hour. Dish up the fillets in a circle ; place in the centre half a pound of preserved glacds cherries ; pour the gravy over. 515.—Fillets of Hare and Red-Currant Jelly. Proceed as above; when you are dishing up the fillets leave out the cherries, and decorate each fillet of hare with a small piece of red-currant jelly. N.B.—Fillets of roe deer can be cooked like fillets of hare. 516. —Larks and Artichokes. Take some fonds d’artichauds, those from a tin are best, as they are all the same size, and cooked; warm them through in a little gravy. Wrap the larks in larding bacon, and roast them before the fire; remove the bacon, place a lark on each fond d’artichaud, and pour over a little hot ravigote, or Italian sauce. 517. —Larks “a la Colbert.” Prepare some toasts exactly as for Red Mullets “ a la Colbert; ” wrap each lark in a slice of larding bacon; roast them before a clear fire; remove the bacon, and serve a lark on each of the coibert toasts with a little savoury brown gravy over them. pWHOLESOME COOKERY. 210 518.—Devilled legs of Chicken, Turkey, Goose, etc. Spread a thin coating of Devil Mixture (127) on the previously cooked legs; put 1 ounce of butter in a frying-pan, and fry for 15 minutes.

Put the paste on the slab and roll it out once; put the butter in the middle of the paste, double it over, and roll it out once; now fold it in 3, and let it stand in a very cool place for a quarter of an hour; then roll it twice very thin; repeat this 3 times at an interval of a quarter of an hour; it will then be ready for the oven. 520.—Vol-au-Vent. Paste prepared as above. Poll out the paste to three-quarters of an inch in thickness; lay a saucepan cover (the size you wish the vol-au-vent to be) on the paste, and cut round it with a plain or fluted knife; now put the paste on a baking-sheet; brush overSUNDHWS. 211 the top with egg, and make a circular incision a quarter of an inch deep, leaving a 1-inch margin all round; put the paste in the oven, and when it is cooked remove the cover, which will have been formed bj the incision, and risen in the baking, and trim off the uncooked paste from the inside; brush the crust inside with egg, and put it back for five minutes in the oven. Fill the vol-au-vent with a “ragout h la financihre,” or fish a la bechamel, stewed mushrooms, stewed oysters, etc. Place the j)aste lid on the top, and serve without delay. 521.—Franco-Australian Bush Kecipe. Take a fresh leg of mutton, rub it thoroughly with a clove of garlic; mix 2 wine-glassfuls of port wine, 1 of salad oil, 1 of ketchup, 1 of vinegar, some pepper and salt; rub this mixture thoroughly into the leg of mutton ; allow the mutton to lie in it; turn and rub it each day for five days; roast in the usual manner, and use any of the liquid left to baste it with while you roast. The above quantity of liquid is for a small joint, joint of mutton is good dressed as above; also rabbits and hares, opossums, or flying foxes; but in the case of rabbits, opossums, or flying foxes it is better to stew them slowly instead of roasting them;WHOLESOME COOEEBT. 212 or, if they are roasted, they must first he covered with slices of larding bacon. N.B.—This recipe can he successfully used with “roe deer.” 522.—Mocha Cake.

Have some very strong coffee ready; add it by very small quantities to the other ingredients; heat well all the time. Have a freshly made sponge cake, cut it in slices, spread each slice thickly with the above mixture, and put the slices together again to form a whole cake; spread some more mixture on the top and round the sides, smooth it well with a knife (dip the knife occasionally in hot water). When the top and sides are well covered and smooth, decorate the top with some more of the mixture, passed through a small funnel, which is made for the purpose. The cofiee must he very strong, for, if much liquid is used, the mixture will he thin, and will not lie on the cake. The mixture between the slices must he of the same thickness as the slices.213 SUNDHIES. 522a.—'Chocolate Cake. Proceed as above, but use grated and pounded chocolate in place of coffee. 522b.—Pistachio Cake. Proceed as above, but use pounded pistachios in place of coffee or chocolate.

Turn it out; when cold, lay some stiffly whipped cream on the top and round (about 1 inch thick on the top). Decorate with cherries, glaces or crystallized, and serve it as soon as possible after it is decorated. If you are in doubt whether the cake is cooked enough, put a skewer in, and the cake is cooked sufficiently if the skewer comes out dry. N.B.—This cake for a change can be soaked in rum, and served without cream. To soak it with rum, the best way is to make some tiny holes with the* point of a skewer, and slowly pour a few tablespoon- fuls of rum until the cake is slightly saturated. 525.—Chestnut Croquettes. Boast 12 to 16 chestnuts, peel them carefully, pound them up; put them on the fire with 1 gill ofSUNDEIES. 215 milk, sugar and vanilla to taste, half an ounce of butter, and 1 or 2 yolks of egg.

This jelly is better if not used the same day it is made; on the other hand, it can be kept many weeks if the fruit was very ripe, and you cover the moulds tightly as you would pots of jam. 557.—Apple Jelly. Peel and core the apples, and cut them into thin slices, and throw them into cold water as you prepare them, so that they do not become yellow. Place them on the fire with sufficient water to cover them, and add the juice of 2 or 3 lemons to each 50 apples. When the apples are quite soft, press all through a jelly bag or a very fine sieve. Then weigh the juice, and add an equal quantity of sugar in small lumps. Place this on the fire, and let it simmer until thick, and you will find it set firm when cold. Place in pots, and cover in the usual manner. N.B.—The apple pulp that remains can be stewed down with some sugar (three-quarters of a pound of sugar to 1 pound of apple), to make into jam. 558.—Pear Jelly. Proceed exactly as for apple jelly.SUNDRIES. 231 559.—Iced Coffee. 1 pint of coffee (426), 1 pint of boiling milk, half a pint of cream, sugar to taste. Sweeten the milk, then add the coffee; let it get nearly cold, then stir in the cream; put the jug to stand for 7 or 8 hours iji a bucket of ice and salt. It is better to keep the jug standing in the salt and ice, and ladle the coffee from there as you require it. 560.—Cocoa, made from Trinidad Nibs. Put 3 heaped-up tablespoonfuls of cocoa nibs in three-quarters of a pint of water. Simmer for 2 hours. Be careful it does not boil, or the cocoa will be muddy. Use with cold or hot milk as preferred.INDEX A KECIPE Aiguehelle Fritters 210 Almond Butter (Savoury) 469 „ „ (Sweet) ... 546 „ Cakes 547a „ Cream 367a „ Puddings 367 ,, Sweet 524 Anchovy Butter 122 „ Eggs 498 » Eie 470 „ Sauce 99 „ Toast 411 409 Apple Charlotte 375 „ Cheese 379 Jelly 557 „ Tart 376 Apples, Swiss 311 Ain-icot and Peach Pie ... 533a „ „ Tart ... 533 „ Cream 332 ,, Omelet 530 Artichoke and Tomato Salad 157 „ Fritters 156, 481 „ Soup 13 Artichokes la CiAme”... 155 „ Italian 154 ,, Jerusalem, Glazed 159 „ Puree of 158 „ Scalloped 167 ,, Stuffed 154a EECirn Aspic 303 Australian Sweet “An Vin tie Madere,” Sauce 314 “Aux Militaires,” Sauce ... 100 B Baked Chocolate Custard... 338 ,, Coffee Custard 341 „ Fish 64 ,, Gurnet 82 „ Soles 52 „ Turbot 84 „ Whitings 57 Baking Powder 553 Banana Fritters 312 Barley Cream 430 „ Soup 18 Batter, Proportions for Fry- ing 437 Bavaroise 329 Beans, Brazilian Black 201 ,, Brittany 198 „ Broad, “h la Cr6me ” 200 „ Haricot, “ ^ la Pro- ven9ale” 192 „ Haricot, Plain 193 ,, Bed, Puree of 196 „ White Haricot, Puree of 199 “ Bearnaise,” Sauce 116 Bechamel Sauce 98, 98a Beef and Macaroni 235234 INDEX.

Wher- ever a variant reading is adoptedy some good and recognized Shaksperian Critic has been followed. In no case is a new rendering of the text proposed; nor has it been thought ne- cessary to distract the reader's attention by notes or commentsSHAKSPERE’S WORKS London ; Kegan Paul, Trench, Teubner & Co., Lt?. THE A VON EDITION. Printed on thin opaque paper, and forming 12 handy volumes, cloth, i8r., or bound in 6 volumes, 15J.

" This edition will be useful to those who want a good text, well and clearly printed, in convenient little volumes that will slip easily into an overcoat pocket or a traveUing-bag.”—St. James's Gazette. “We know no prettier edition of Shakspere for the price. ”—Academy. “ It is refreshing to meet with an edition of Shakspere of convenient size and low price, without either notes or introductions of any sort to distract the attention of the reader. ”—Saturday Rruiew. “It is exquisite. Each volume is handy, is beautifully printed, and in every way lends itself to the taste of the cultivated student of Shak- •pere. ”—Scotsman.SHAKSPERE’S WORKS.

In 12 volumes Elzevir 8vo., choicely printed on hand-made paper, and bound in parchment or cloth, price 12s., or in vellum, price ^£4 los. The set of 12 volumes may also be had in a strong cloth box, price ^3 l^s., or with an oak hanging shelf, 18s. SOME PRESS NOTICES. “ . . . There is, perhaps, no edition in which the works of Shakspere can be read in such luxury of type and quiet distinction of form as this, and we warmly recommend it.”—Fall Mall Gazette. “ For elegance of form and beauty of typography, no edition of Shakspere hitherto published has excelled the ‘ Parchment Library Edition.’ . . . They are in the strictest sense pocket volumes, yet the type is bold, and, being on fine white hand-made paper, can hardly tax the weakest of sight. The print is judiciously confined to the text, notes being more appropriate to library editions. The whole will be comprised in the cream-coloured parchment which gives the name to the series.” —Daily News. ‘I The Parchment Library Edition of Shakspere needs no further praise,”—Saturday Review.

My wind, cooling my broth, Would blow me to an ague, when I thought What harm a wind too great might do at sea, I should not see the sandy hour-glass run But I should think of shallows and of flats, And see my wealthy Andrew, dock’d in sand. Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs To kiss her burial. Should I to church And see the holy edifice of stone. And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks. Which touching but my gentle vessel’s side. Would scatter all her spices on the stream. Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks. And, in a word, but even now worth this. And now worth nothing ? Shall I have the thought To think on this, and shall I lack the thought That such a thing bechanc’d would make me sad ? But tell not me : I know Antonio Is sad to think upon his merchandise. Ant. Believe me, no : I thank my fortune for it. My ventures are not in one bottom trusted. Nor to one place ; nor is my whole estate Upon the fortune of this present year : Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad. Salar. Why, then you are in love. Ant. Fie, fie I Salar. Not in love neither ? Then let us say you are sad. Because you are not merry; and ’twere as easy For you to laugh, and leap, and say you are merry. Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus, Nature hath fram’d strange fellow* in her time ; Some that will evermore peep through their eyes And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper ; And other of such vinegar aspectPRINTED BY WILLIAAl CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED, LONDON AND BECCLES.RECORD OF TREATMENT, EXTRACTION, REPAIR, etc. ■■ 1 Pressmark: Binding Ref No: 1 5 S 1:7 Microfilm No: Date Particulars 1 Chemical Treatment i Fumigation I Deacidification fTLi' i 1 Lamination Solvents !

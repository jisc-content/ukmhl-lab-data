113 HORS B’CEUVRE. fish; they ought to be pretty to look at, and to furnish two or three delicate mouthfuls. Several such hors d'oeuvre may be served on the same dish, which makes at once a hand- some arrangement to the eye and offers greater choice to the guests, while at the same time it simplifies the service. For household cooking, however, the less said about warm hors d’oeuvre the better, for few private kitchens and few family cooks are equal to the task of preparing and serving these small dishes as they should be served. It is true you may get many of them from the neighbouring pastry-cook’s, but the gourmet distrusts dishes provided by pastry- cooks and caterers. Exception must, of course, be made for certain artists who have achieved fame for special things. In Paris, for instance, one of Bontoux’s timbales is a dish which it is a privilege to taste and which no private or professional cook can surpass. But, as a rule, it is well to avoid getting dishes from outside, and therefore I advise the amphitryon to dispense as much as possible with warm hors d'oeuvre. Let them be reserved for parade dinners, where there is necessarily more show than there is delicate eating. 1

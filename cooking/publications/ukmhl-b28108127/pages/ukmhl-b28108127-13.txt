INTRODUCTION. IX If the readers of your pages, so full of ideas —so suggestive, as the French modernists would say—do not become convinced, with that charming poet and gastronomist, Thlodore de Banville, that the hygiene of the stomach is also the hygiene of the mind and soul, and that delicate cookery develops the intelligence and the moral sensibility, the faidt will not be yours. I approve you heartily and wholly, even in your paradoxes, which always contain a kernel of logical observation and judicious criticism. Adieu, my dear author; macte virtute, by which I mean, continue in your efforts to win a glorious pair of gouty crutches, and believe me always your devoted and inseparable com- panion in gastronomy, P. Z. Didsbury.

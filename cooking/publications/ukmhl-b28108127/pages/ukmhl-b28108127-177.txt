ON TABLE-SERVICE. 161 In order to be comfortably seated at table the chair must be neither too high nor too low, and above all it should not be so heavy that it needs an effort to move it an inch, nor should it be rough with carving that sticks into your shoulders when you lean back, or catches and tears the dresses of women. These details also may seem un- worthy of being written down, but experi- ence has hitherto revealed to me very few reasonably constructed dining-room chairs. The table-cloth should be laid, not directly on the table, but over a thick cotton blanket. The cloth itself should be spotlessly clean, and if this condition exist much will be par- doned ; it may be of pure white linen or damask, or it may have a coloured pattern woven or embroidered along the edges. The use of colour in the pattern of table-linen is by no means novel. In the miniatures of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the table- cloths and the long, narrow dresser-cloths are constantly represented with rose or blue stripes and borders. Some luxurious table-cloths nowadays are not only richly embroidered, but also adorned with inserted bands of lace, which give you the sensation of dining off a petticoat. Such excess is to be avoided. M

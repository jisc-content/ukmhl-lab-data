165 ON TABLE-SERVICE. respect and envy Messer Mathia Giegher’s three treatises, of which the first teaches how to fold napkins according to designs shown in queer woodcuts. Li tre trattati ch messer Mathia Giegher. Net primo si monstra con facilita grande il mo do di piegare ogni sorte di panni. This book, an oblong i8mo., was published in 1639 at Padua, fully twenty years before the French entered the field with Pierre David’s Maistre d'hostel qui apprend Vordre de bien servir sur table, and which is preceded by familiar instructions for folding all sorts of table-linen into all kinds of figures. Instructions familieres pour bien apprendre a plyer toutes sortes de linges de table et en toutes sortes de figures. Pierre David gives direc- tions for folding napkins into twenty-seven different figures, including such fancies as a hen and chickens, two rabbits, a dog with his collar, a sucking-pig, a Lorrain cross, a double or single shell, etc. Nowadays few butlers possess so varied a talent as the excellent Pierre David. Our modern fine linen is, as a rule, wanting in daintiness; nevertheless, by dint of a little attention, we can obtain table-cloths and napkins that are soft to the touch, unstiffened, and free from the smell of rank soap.

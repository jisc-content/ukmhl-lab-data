INTRODUCTION. A LETTER FROM P. Z. DIDSBURY TO THE AUTHOR. My dear Author,— I have read your savoury little volume with interest, amusement, and satisfaction. So far as concerns myself, I cannot but feel flattered by your respectful quotation of my aphorisms, and by your very appreciative and useful com- ments upon them. You know that these aphorisms are the result of the experience of the many years which I have passed in the strenuous study of delicate dining — that art which, as Victor Hugo says in his Titanic way, consists “ de faire aboutir La mamelle du monde a, la bouche d’un homme. You dwell with laudable persistency upon the necessity of criticism in gastronomic matters.

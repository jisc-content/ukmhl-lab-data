DELICATE DINING. io6 name as famous as that of Boileau, and when the grand seigneurs immortalized themselves by combining delicate dishes. Such was the Marquis de Bechamel, who has given his name to a fundamental sauce : such the regent who invented pain a la d'Orleans ; such the Marshal de Richelieu, who invented mahon- naises, or mayonnaises, and attached his name to a score of noble recipes; such the smiling and imaginative Madame de Pompadour, who created the filets de volaille a la Bellevue, the palais de boeuf a la Pompadour, and the tendrons d'agneau au Soleil; such were the grand ladies who invented quails a la Mire- poix, Chartreuses d la Mauconseil, poulets a la Villeroy. The name of Montmorency has received additional lustre from a dish of fat pullets. The dukes of La Valliere and Duras, the Prince de Guemenee, the Marquis de Brancas, even the princes of the royal family, the Comte dâ€™Artois and the Prince de Conde, did their best to cherish the sacred fire of culinary art; and whatever satirical writers may have found to say against the financiers and farmers-general, none of them, whether hungry or gorged, dared to write a single word against the cooks and the tables of these heroes of incommensurable appetite.

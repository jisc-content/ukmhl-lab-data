147 ON DINING-TABLES. received the name of “ high table,” a term still in use at Oxford and Cambridge. The guests sat on one side of the table only ; the place of honour was in the centre ; and the principal personage sat under a canopy or cloth of state, hung up for the occasion, or under a permanent panelled canopy curving outwards. At Florence, in the time of the Renaissance, the guests appear to have sat on one side of the table and at the ends. Such is the arrangement in Pinturrichio’s pictures of the Story of Griselidis, now in the National Gallery at London. One of these pictures represents a feast served under a portico built in a garden. The guests are seated along one side and at the ends of a long and narrow table. The waiters carry long nap- kins thrown over their shoulders or streaming in the wind like scarfs as they walk. In the collection of Mr. Leyland, at London, there is a beautiful picture by Sandro Botticelli, representing a feast served in a lovely green meadow under a portico having five pillars on each side. In the background, at a short distance off, is a sort of triumphal arch, and beyond it you see a landscape and a lake with boats and islands crowned with castles.

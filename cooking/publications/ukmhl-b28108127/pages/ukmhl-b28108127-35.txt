THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKING. 19 “ The savours developed in this process have a decidedly favourable influence on the secretion of the gastric juice!' To present the same fact in another light : “ All methods of preparation,” says Payen (“ Substances Alimentaires ”), “ which tend to render meat easier to divide or more tender, and often more agreeable to the taste, concur to increase its digestibility, or, in other words, its easy assimilation, and often annihilate cer- tain causes of unhealthiness existing in raw meat!' Fat and fatty substances are not digested in the stomach, inasmuch as the gastric juice has no action on them, further than setting them free from the albuminoid substances with which they may be entangled. This variety of food, together with the starch, is digested below the stomach, through the ac- tion of the pancreatic and intestinal juices. This explains why the saturation of food in general by fat during the process of cooking should be avoided, as the fat in this case acts as a varnish to the albuminous substances and prevents free access to the latter of the gastric juices, by which alone this class of food can be digested. Albumen is a substance which becomes

THE THEORY OF SOUPS. 89 vious pages, is tJie grand event in oar material daily life. In no branch of cookery has the imagina- tion of fanciful cooks been so industrious as in the combination and naming of soups. As we have over one hundred fairly distinct varieties of soup, it is desirable to avoid fancy names that convey no meaning, such as the names of princes and statesmen, and to call these soups by titles that give some idea of their composition. In this matter clearness and simplicity are desirable, and the example of Gouffe is to be followed by always mentioning the characteristic in- gredient of the soup, thus : potage a Poseille, consomme aux pates d'ltalie, soupe aux choux, puree d’asperges, etc. Potage, or soup, is the generic term, though in French soupe is reserved for such soups as are served with bread in them, while potage is applied to soups without bread. Potages are divided into gras and maigres, according as they have been prepared with or without meat. Potages gras are made with bouillons or decoctions of all kinds of butchers’ meat, fowl, fish, and crustaceans. In the same way potages maigres are made from all sorts of vegetables.

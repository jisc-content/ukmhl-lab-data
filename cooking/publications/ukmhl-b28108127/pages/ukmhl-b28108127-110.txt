DELICATE DINING. 94 require care, method, and intelligence on the part of the cook who undertakes to make them, and also that quality which I have so frequently insisted upon as necessary for the highest achievements in the kitchen, namely, sentiment. The cookery-books contain multitudes of recipes for making soups. We need not re- peat them. In general, a cook who has the sentiment of his art will rarely follow pre- cisely any recipe given in a book ; he will content himself with seeking ideas in books and carry them out according to his skill and feeling. Practice, experience, and work un- der good masters make the best cook. In Paris the women cooks often take lessons in the kitchens of the great clubs. The life and soul of household cookery, the basis of a good, plain dinner, and of a host of stews, sauces, purees, etc., is beef bouillon. The first thing to learn is how to make the pot-au-feu. The result of the pot-au-feu must be sa- voury, clear, and free from grease. The operations of skimming and straining through a sieve are most important.

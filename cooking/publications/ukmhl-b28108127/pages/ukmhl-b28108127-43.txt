METHODS OF PREPARING MEATS. 2J the water has reached the boiling-point before you immerse the meat in it, and leave it to cook for about five minutes at that tempera- ture. The heat of the water, 212 degrees Fahrenheit, at once coagulates the albumen in the external layer of flesh, which becomes thus a waterproof case in which the meat cooks, safe from the infiltration of water and from the escape of its juice. After the first five minutes the cooking should proceed more gently, at a temperature of 162 degrees Fahrenheit. Both in roasting and in boiling, the result is similar, and is thus noted by Dalton on the preparation of meat for food : “ Firstly, the albumen which is present in the muscular tissue is coagulated, and the muscular fibres, therefore, become rather firmer and more consistent than they are in fresh meat. “ Secondly, the cellular tissue between the muscular fibres is softened and gelatinized, so that the fibres are more easily separated from one another, and the whole mass be- comes more tender and easily digestible. “Thirdly, the high temperature develops in the albuminous ingredients of the meat a peculiar and attractive flavour, which they did

103 ABOUT SAUCES. II.—The Classical Sauces. The classical sauces are the innumerable derivatives of the four primary sauces known as Espagnole, Allemande, veloute, and Bechamel. All these primary sauces, or sauces meres, are sublimated decoctions or quintessences of the most savoury and succulent meats, whether of quadrupeds, fowl, or fish. In a modest household it is impossible to make them ; they require pro- fessional skill, expensive materials, and extensive apparatus. People who have princely establishments may prepare the finest sauces in their own kitchens, but the vast majority of mankind must depend upon the first-class restaurateurs for their prepara- tion. The great authority Dubd's-Bernard, speak- ing of this branch of his art, says : “ Sauces, by the care and labour they require, by the costly sacrifices which theynecessarily involve, ought to be considered as the essential basis of good cookery. The gourmet would not think much of an elegant and sumptuously served dinner of which the sauces are wanting in that fineness of taste, that succulency, and that purity which are indispensable.

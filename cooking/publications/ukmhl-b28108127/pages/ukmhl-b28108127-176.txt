l6o DELICATE DINING. to expound the English method, the whole theory and practice of which consists in using the fork always with the left hand and the knife and spoon with the right. The fork is to be held with the index finger stretched out so as to maintain it in an almost horizontal position. Nothing seems clumsier than to grip the fork with clenched fist and to hold it perpendicular as the Germans often do. These points seem so simple and ele- mentary that it would appear useless to put them down in writing, and yet a little ex- perience of tables d'hote, particularly on the European continent, will show that there are still many well-dressed people in this world who eat like savages and not at all according to the English method. At a table d'hote in Hanover I remember once sitting beside a German lady, a banker’s wife, who borrowed my scarf-pin to pick her teeth with after dinner. This was not only a proof of bad manners, but also of hygienic imprudence, because a metal toothpick spoils the enamel of the teeth. For toothpicking purposes a lentisk stick is best, though a quill is not harm- ful, as Martial says in one of his epigrams : “ Lentiscum melius: sed si tibi frondea cuspis Defuerit, dentes, penna, levare potes.”

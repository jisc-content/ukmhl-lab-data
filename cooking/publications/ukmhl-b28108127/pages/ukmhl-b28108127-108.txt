DELICATE DINTNG. 92 nutriment. Bouillon contains, in the wav of assimilable substances, only a small quantity of grease, some mineral salts, and a certain quantity of gelatine. The researches of modern chemistry have shown that gelatine has little or no alimen- tary virtues, but that it is certainly “ pepto- genic,” that is to say, it excites the stomach to activity. The stimulating power of bouillon is chiefly due to creatine, which has almost the same chemical composition as caffeine, and passes through the system without being absorbed at all. Bouillon is also rich in salts of potash. The chemists tell us that osmazome consists, as far as we can find out, of creatine, inosic acid, and mineral salts, lactates, phosphates, chlorures of potassium, calcium, sodium, etc. Bouillon restores a man immediately after drinking it, like tea or coffee.

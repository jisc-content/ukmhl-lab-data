DELICATE DINING. 40 Starch in the digestive tube is changed first into dextrine, then into glucose. Much has been written about the ways of preserving the green colour in cooked vege- tables. The French cooks, I have read in English cook-books, generally put a pinch of carbo- nate of ammonia into the water. Dubois-Bernard and Souchay use a red copper pan to boil their vegetables in. The red copper, during the process of boiling, gives off a little oxychloride of copper, which is the same product that is used for giving a green patine to bronze statues. In reality the great secret is simply to have abundance of water in the pot. It will be found that string-beans, for in- stance, plunged into well-salted boiling water, in a pot of any material, provided it be large enough to allow the beans to float freely, each one careering round on its own account in the stream of ebullition, will retain their green colour perfectly. The pot should not be covered. In is needless to add that the same holds good of other green vegetables.

DELICATE DINING. 6o Fish must always be put into cold court- bouillon. The court-bouillon may be prepared before- hand, and cooled down before the fish is put in ; the court-bouillon may also be kept and used several times, provided it be reboiled every three or four days, a little water being added each time to supply loss by evapora- tion. Naturally a court-bouillon prepared before- hand will savour more strongly of the aro- matic ingredients in it than a new court- bouillon. If wine is abundant, of course it may be substituted for water almost entirely. Remark that in countries where wine is not commonly used for kitchen purposes the court-bouillon may be made quite satisfactorily with vinegar and lemons. Even in France many an economical housekeeper will not sacrifice a bottle of white wine to boil a fish. With wine, of course, the result is more deli- cate and richer. But wine is not absolutely necessary for success. Both fresh-water and sea fish may be ad- vantageously cooked in court-bouillon, with the exception, of course, of such fine kinds as the lordly turbot.

166 DELICATE DINING. The napkin will of course match the cloth, and if it is embroidered or ornamented in any way, let this decoration in no way interfere with its usefulness. Above all things, let there be no mottoes or inscriptions “charm- ingly worked in all kinds of odd places, in one corner, or across the middle, or along one or all the sides,” as Mrs. Loftie suggests in her little book “ The Dining-Room.” “ Not only are such devices pretty and ap- propriate,” continues Mrs. Loftie, “ but they may sometimes afford a subject for dinner conversation when the weather has been ex- haustively discussed.” Mrs. Loftie has made many excellent suggestions in her pages about laying the table, but this one is too cruel a!nd too ironical. If people’s conversa- tional powers are so limited that they require the motto of a table-napkin to help them out, it were better to prohibit conversation at table altogether, and have some one read aloud, as was the custom in the old monasteries, and also at the court of Frederick di Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, who used to have Plutarch, Xenophon, and Aristotle read to him while he was at table, and thus maintained that serene frame of mind which is necessary for happiness at meals.

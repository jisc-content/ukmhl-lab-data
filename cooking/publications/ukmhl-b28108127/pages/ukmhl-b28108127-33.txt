II. THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKING. Animal chemistry is in a very backward condition, as compared with vegetable and mineral chemistry. Prof. Bloxam, for in- stance, tells us that the chemical formulae of a great many animal substances are perfectly unintelligible, conveying not the least in- formation as to the position in which the compound stands with respect to other sub- stances, or the changes which it might un- dergo under given circumstances. Certain results, however, have been obtained, and will be here cited so far as they have significance in the operations of cooking, no pretension being made to originality, and the authorities being cited in each case. For the general guidance of the cook, meat may be said to be composed of four elements, namely: muscular fibre, albumen, fat, and juiceâ€”the latter being, chemically speaking, a very complicated substance con- taining a number of proximate elements.

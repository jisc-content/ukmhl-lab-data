VIII. THE THEORY OF SOUPS. “ Soup/’ says Brillat Savarin, “ rejoices the stomach, and disposes it to receive and digest other food.” The gourmet looks upon soup as a prepar- atory element in a refined dinner ; he takes a small quantity of it only, and does not ask for a second helping ; he requires it to be served hot, and not lukewarm, and in deep soup-plates, and not in boiuls. A bowl of soup may be welcome to a traveller or to a simple eater, who wants merely to satisfy his hunger by quantities of nourishment. Re- member always that there is a difference between dining and feeding. The great fault with the most popular Eng- lish soups, such as ox-tail, turtle, mock-turtle, mulligatawny, etc., is their strength and hea- viness. To begin dinner by absorbing a large portion of these preparations implies coarse- ness of conception and prodigious digestive powers.

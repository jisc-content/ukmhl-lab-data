43 ON VEGETABLES. a half pints of water, two pinches of salt, three pinches of pepper ; put on the fire and boil for ten minutes, stirring all the while with a wooden spoon. Then you add a good ounce of grated Parmesan cheese, and a good ounce of grated Gruyere, and reduce the whole for five minutes. (By “reducing” we mean applying very hot fire to the saucepan in order to bring about rapid evaporation, and so reduce the liquidity of the mixture. “ Cooking,” on the other hand, is produced by a slow and continuous fire.) Next you take a shallow dish of porcelain or of crockery which will resist heat, the same dish in which the cauliflower will be served when cooked. You place a layer of cauliflower in the bottom of the dish, and spread over it a layer of the sauce. Then you pile up the rest of the cauliflower, pour over it the rest of the sauce, sprinkle another ounce of grated Parmesan and a spoonful of cracker-crumbs, and pour over the whole three quarters of an ounce of melted butter. Then you put the dish into an oven with fire above and fire below, and in twenty minutes it will be as brown and golden as a picture by Titian, a joy to the eye and a delight to the palate.

THE ART OF EATING AT TABLE. 197 engaged in foreign travel, I will add that the use of salt-spoons is not universal in this world. If you happen to be at a table where the host, recalcitrant to progress, has not invested any capital in vermeil, silver, or bone salt-spoons, help yourself to salt with the point of your knife, as Erasmus of Rotterdam tells you, having previously wiped it on your plate or on a bit of bread. Do not attempt to help yourself to salt with the handle of your fork or spoon. In countries where salt-spoons are not held in honour, such an attempt would be esteemed a mark of ill-breeding.

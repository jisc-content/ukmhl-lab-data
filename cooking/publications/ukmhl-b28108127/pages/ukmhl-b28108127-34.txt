i8 DELICATE DINING. “In the juice of flesh,” says Prof. Bloxam (“ Chemistry Inorganic and Organic,’5 Lon- don, 1883), “which may be squeezed out of chopped flesh, there are certain substances which appear to play a very important part in nutrition. The liquid is distinctly acid, which is remarkable when the alkaline char- acter of the blood is considered, and contains phosphoric, lactic and butyric acid, together with kreatine, inosite, and saline matters.5’ These names will convey little to simple minds, but the essential point to be remem- bered is that the juice of flesh contains a variety of nutritive substances. Flint, in his “ Physiology of Man ” (N. Y., 1875), says : “ Food contains many substances having an important influence on nutrition which have never been isolated and analyzed, but which render it agreeable, and give to the diet that variety which the system impera- tively demands. “ Many of these principles are developed in the process of cooking.” The same authority tells us that the effect of cooking on muscular tissue is to disinte- grate, to a certain extent, the intermuscular alveolar or connective tissue, and so to facili- tate the action of the digestive fluids.

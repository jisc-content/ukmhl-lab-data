177 ON TABLE-SERVICE. room. Any system of lighting which leaves no part of a room in soft shadow is painful to the eye and fatal to the artistic ensem- ble. For the woman who wishes to show her beauty in the most advantageous con- ditions, and for the gourmet who wishes to feast his palate and his eyes in the most refined manner possible, a diner aux bougies is the ideal. At the Rothschild houses in Paris the dinners are served by candlelight, and, if the viands and the wines were as fine as the candlesticks, the dinners would be perfect. In the Baron Edmond de Rothschildâ€™s dining-room the air is kept cool in the summer by two columns of crystal ice placed in a bed of flowers and foliage, one at each end of the room, and the floral decoration of the table is composed exclusively of cut orchids. The above remarks about the necessity of avoiding the presence of perfumed flowers in the dining-room also apply, of course, to artificial perfumes. If ladies are to be ad- mitted to a grand artistic dinner, let them be content with their natural odour and eschew the essences of Atkinson and Rimmel. N

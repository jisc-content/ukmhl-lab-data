ON SERVING WINES. 187 mouth just as we have a stupid mind. A man who does not distinguish between a lan- gouste and a lobster, between a herring, that admirable fish that carries within it all the savours and aromas of the sea, and a mack- erel or a whiting, is comparable only to a man who could confound Balzac with Eugene Sue and a symphony by Beethoven with a military march composed by some regimental band-master.” On this matter of wine-drinking there is a French proverb of which we have no good translation: Pain taut qu’il dure, vin a viesure. The French observe this proverb ; for no people eat more bread, nor have better to eat ; and for wine, most of them drink it well diluted and not in excess, although they serve it in big hearty glasses. One of the curious and inexplicable phenomena of modern times is the persistent backwardness of British panification. On the Continent, from Brest to Vienna, you get good bread, sweet in flavour, light, perfectly cooked, crisp- crusted, pleasant to the eye and grateful to the stomach. In England the cottage loaf and the tin bread prevail in spite of every- thing, sour, indigestible, irrepressible, the dis- grace of a great country.

120 DELICATE DINING. water is poured in, otherwise the temperature of the boiling water would experience a sudden change, and the infusion would taste flat. Tea should be prepared daintily, in small quantities, and drunk immediately. If it be needful to prepare tea in large quantities, the infusion should be decanted in a unarmed earthen teapot as soon as it has acquired the appropriate strength. The object of decanting the infusion is to prevent the liquid from becoming impreg- nated with tannic acid and other acrid and noxious principles which the tea-leaves con- tain. Tea, as it is usually made in England and in America, where the process of infusion is allowed to continue indefinitely until the teapot is emptied, is a rank decoction of tea-leaves which can only be drunk after it has been softened by the addition of milk or cream and sugar. I make this statement with full consciousness of its heterodoxy, according to received English ideas. They who demand “ strong ” tea know nothing of the charms of delicate tea. They who drink tea mixed with cream never know the joy of the real taste of tea.

III. •METHODS OF PREPARING MEATS. The usual methods of cooking are Roast- ing, Broiling, Boiling, Frying, Stewing, and Decocting. We will consider each process briefly, from the point of view of practical chemistry. In Roasting, the exterior of the piece of meat is submitted brusquely to a tempera- ture considerably above 212 degrees Fahren- heit or boiling-point, or at any rate not below boiling-point. The result is that the albu- men of the surface is coagulated, and in this state acts as a barrier against the escape of the juice inside, and against the infiltration of liquid from without. After a few minutes’ close exposure to a brisk, clear fire, the joint may be drawn back a little and roasted slowly. Thus the interior mass of the meat, enclosed in an impervious jacket, cooks literally in its juice, getting heated in the inside only to a temperature between 120 and 150 degrees Fahrenheit, which is not sufficient to coagu-

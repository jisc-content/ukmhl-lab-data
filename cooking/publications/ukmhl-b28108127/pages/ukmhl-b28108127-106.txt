90 DELICATE DINING. The name puree, or creme, is given to thick soups made of alimentary substances crusted or pounded, such as game, pease, beans, len- tils, asparagus, etc. Such soups are generally very nourishing, but not easily digestible. Consomme is the name given to the supreme result of the decoction of animal and vegetable matter ; it is a perfect bouillon, a bouillon con- somme. In the cook-books you will find directions for making the ordinary consomme, composed of the juices of beef, veal, and fowls decocted in grand bouillon, or fine stock, and also for making consomme de volaille, consomme de gibier, and consommes of vege- tables. Consomme is necessary for making fine soups, but for household cookery the good ordinary stock is sufficient. (N.B.â€”Without good beef-stock it is impossible to make a dinner worthy of the name.) Stock is con- stantly required in the most simple opera- tions of cookery. The aversion of the Anglo- Saxon cook to making stock is one of the main sources of his or her inferiority. Extract of meat does not take the place oj stock. Extracts of meat should be very spar- ingly used in a well-regulated kitchen, and- extracts of coffee never.

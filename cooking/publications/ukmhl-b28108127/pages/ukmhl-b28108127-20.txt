4 DELICATE DINING. his immortal bronze statues.—P. Z. Dids- bury. VII. If there is anything sadder than un- recognized genius, it is the misunder- stood stomach. The heart whose love is rejected—this much-abused drama— rests upon a fictitious want. But the stomach ! Nothing can be compared to its sufferings, for we must have life before everything.—Honore de Balzac. VIII. The gastronomer loves order and har- mony of service, as the painter loves har- mony of colours. Excellent food served in a coarse dish will seem less succulent than poorer food served on fine porcelain. Nevertheless the charm of glass-ware, lordly dishes, and delicate napery, must not be exaggerated. No splendour of service can compensate for inferior and badly-cooked viands.—P. Z. Didsbury. IX. A good restaurant is like a more or less epic poem—it cannot be improvised in a day. Tradition, knowledge, experience, and even genius, are necessary. A good cellar alone can only be formed with the aid of length of time and prodigious faculties of taste.—Magny.

DELICATE DINING. I 10 a “carte” which forms a thick volume, and contains the enumeration of all the dishes that a cook can make; there is also a “ carte du jour,” which is the menu of the restaurant, the dinner of the day, with its noble order of pot age, hors d' oeuvre, releves, entrees, roasts, entremets, etc. The theory of a menu and of the composi- tion of a dinner is simplicity itself; in gene- ral terms, it begins with an excitant, namely, soup, satisfies hunger gradually by fish, sa- voury dishes, and roasts, with which latter a salad comes in to excite the digestion once more, and prepare the way for a vegetable, which will be followed by the dessert. In composing your menu you must consult first of all the market, and, secondly, the number of guests to be served ; and, in selecting the dishes, the chief things to avoid are such gross errors as the repetition of the same meats and the same sauces, or sauces of the same nature. If you serve a turbot sauce Hollandaise you must not serve after it a poulet sauce supreme or even a blanauette de veau. The use of French words in a menu is not indispensable. The delicate diner is not bound to know French.

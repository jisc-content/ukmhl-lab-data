194 DELICATE DINING. with a fork, and Queen Marie Antoinette and other ladies of the eighteenth century were of my way of thinking. If the ladies could only see how pretty is their gesture when their diaphanous forefinger and thumb grasp a leaf of delicate green lettuce and raise that leaf from the porcelain plate to their rosy lips, they would all immediately take to eating salad a la Marie Antoinette. Only bear in mind, good ladies, that if you do wish to eat lettuce salad with your fingers you must mix the salad with oil and vinegar, and not with that abominable, ready-made white “ salad-dressing,” to look upon which is nauseating. May Heaven preserve us from excessive complication in matters of table-service and eating ! Let us beware of having too many forks for comfort, and of forms too quaint for practical utility. Certainly, silver dessert knives and forks are very good in their way, because they are not susceptible to the action of fruit acids, but it is vain and clumsy to attempt to make too exclusive use of the knife and fork in eating fruit. Eating is not a thing to be ashamed of. To thoroughly enjoy a peach you must bite it and feel the juicy, perfumed flesh melt in your mouth.

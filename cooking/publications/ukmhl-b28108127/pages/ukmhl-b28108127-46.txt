30 DELICATE DINING. big baker’s oven—is that it is difficult, if not impossible, to keep an ordinary oven, in a cooking-stove, clean and well-ventilated. The sides, roof, and floor of the oven get be- spattered with particles of fat and spots of gravy during the baking process, and these particles become charred, and thus fill the oven with ammoniac and with a foul atmos- phere of empyreumatic oils, by which terrible word the chemists indicate the unwhole- some vapours generated through the action of fire. In the process of roasting before an open fire these empyreumatic odours are, in- deed, generated, but they pass off up the chimney, whereas in the oven they are im- prisoned, and there penetrate the meat, destroy its flavour, and render it more or less insipid. Meat, however, may be baked in pies, be- cause in this case its surface, being protected by the crust, cannot be charred and impreg- nated with the foul empyreumatic oils. The baking of meat in a pie-crust amounts, in reality, to a stewing operation, the paste forming, as it were, a stew-pan with its lid. Frequent basting is essential to successful roasting. Otherwise, the coagulated surface

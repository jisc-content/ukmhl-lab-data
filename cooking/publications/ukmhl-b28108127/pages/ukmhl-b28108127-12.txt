INTRODUCTION. via and the usefulness of your book will consist largely in awakening a spirit of criticism, and in calling attention to the roles of intellect and sentiment in the art of cooking. There is no severer and more conclusive test of a country's state of civilization than the way its inhabit- ants dine. Certainly there is no lack of cook-books. Indeed, this special branch of literature is more flourishing in Great Britain than it is in the country where good cookery is not yet entirely a souvenir of the past. These books, however, are often merely compilations of recipes, and few of them are based on careful observation or on truly scientific and artistic principles. The writers of these works, too, are often led away by the mere love of novelty, as if the caprices of ephemeralfashion were to be allowed to perturb the immutable theories of scientific dining ! Much, therefore, remains to be done, and I am sure that your dainty volume—which is a sort of higher handbook of the kitchen and dining-room, if I may so express myself (and I think I may)—will greatly help to increase a knowledge of the true principles of delicate dining.

THE ART OF EATING AT TABLE. 191 he has touched upon all the points that are essential to decency, comfort, and good feeling. These points concern three matters, namely, the laying of the table, the serving of the meats, and the behaviour and frame of mind of the guests. A veteran writer, Theophile Gautier, who uttered that famous axiom so saddening to journalists, “ Daily newspapers are published every day,” also fathered a paradox in con- tradiction to the lamentation of the Preacher. “ There is nothing new under the sun,” said the pessimistic Hebrew. “ Everything is new and hitherto unpublished,” replied Gautier, “ tout est inedit” For this reason I have quoted some observations of Erasmus of Rotterdam on table-manners, and now beg leave to gloss and comment upon them, beginning with the very important detail of toothpicks and picking teeth. The use of fine chicken-bones, which Erasmus recommended, we should now consider rustic. The only toothpick that hygiene and convenience admit are wooden splinters or quills. Gold or silver tooth- picks are dangerous, because the metal may scratch or chip the enamel of the teeth. On this point there can be no hesitation.

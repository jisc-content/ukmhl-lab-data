A really triumphant Chateaubriand is two inches thick after it is cooked, and it is cooked rose right through ; the outside is neither burned nor dry ; and when you cut it with the knife the red juice flows out and mixes with the maitre d'hotel’, and makes it, as it were, something living and animated. The inventor and baptizer of the Chateaxi- briand, I have been told, was Magny, and the name was given to it by mistake, for, accord- ing to Magny, it was christened, not after Chateaubriand, the author of the “ Genie du Christianisme,” but after a M. de Chabrillan, who is not otherwise famous.

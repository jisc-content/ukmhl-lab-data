The only reasonable and scientific spit is a sort of cage which clasps the meat around without piercing it anywhere. Thus there will be no loss of juice. The rational way of placing the spit is in a horizontal position, and care should be taken to have the fire in a somewhat convex form, so that the heat may be distributed over the ends as well as over the middle portions of the meat.

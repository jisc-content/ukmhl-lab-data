104 DELICATE DINING. “ A man is never a great cook if he does not possess a perfect knowledge of sauces, and if he has not made a special study of the methodical principles on which their perfection depends. “Two causes contribute to the imperfection of sauces—defective knowledge or defective materials. An incompetent man, disposing of the finest resources, only obtains a medi- ocre and doubtful result ; but a clever practi- tioner, if he has not the necessary materials, or if those materials are insufficient or of bad quality, does not attain the desired end. Experience, practice, knowledge, become powerless in such circumstances ; the cleverest cook can correct and attenuate, but he cannot struggle against the impossible, nor make prodigies out of nothing. “ Consequently, in order to make perfect sauces, the cook must not only know how to go to work, but he must know how to make the sacrifices that are required. These con- siderations, which we cannot too strongly impress both upon amphitryons and upon cooks, have already struck more than one observer. True gourmets are not accustomed to make parsimonious calculations; they know that good cooking is incompatible with insufficient means.”

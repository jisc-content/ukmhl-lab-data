CHAP. I.] SOUPS. 31 with the pounded rabbit-flesh : this must be done with care, for if the liquid be not added in very small portions at first, the meat will gather into lumps, and will not easily be worked smooth afterwards. Add as much pounded mace and cayenne as will season the soup pleasantly, and pass it through a coarse but very clean sieve; wipe out the stewpan, put back the soup into it, and stir in when it boils, a pint and a quarter of good cream, mixed with a tablespoonfnl of the best arrow-root: salt, if needed, should be thrown in previously. Young rabbits, 3 ; water, or clear veal broth, 7 pints : f of an hour. Remains of rabbits ; onions, 2 ; celery, 1 head; car- rots, 3 ; savoury herbs; mace, 2 blades; white peppercorns, a half-teaspoonful; salt, 1 oz.: 4 hours. Soup, 4 to 5 pints; pounded rabbit-flesh, 8 ozs.; salt, mace, and cayenne, if needed; cream, If pint; arrow-root, 1 tablespoonful (or If oz.)

Rabbits, 2 full grown, or 3 small; onions fried, 3, middling- sized ; water, 7 pints ; salt, 1 large teaspoonful or more ; carrots, 4; faggot of parsley; peppercorns, 1 small teaspoonful: 5 to 51 hours. SUPERLATIVE HARE SOUP.

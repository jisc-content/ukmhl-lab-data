A roaster of the form shown here may be purchased for about fourteen shillings. TO MAKE COFFEE. It is more usual at the present day to filter than to boil coffee, but many persons still prefer the latter mode. The degree of strength which is to be given must of course depend on the taste of those for whom it is prepared; but it should always be good when served to strangers, as a preference for weak coffee is very rare, and in many instances it would be peculiarly unacceptable to the drinkers, more especially so to those who have resided much abroad, where this beverage is in general much better prepared than it is in England.

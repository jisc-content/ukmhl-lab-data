27 CHAP. I.] SOUPS. of small forcemeat-balls; the brain cut into dice (after baying been well soaked, scalded,* and freed from the film), dipped into beaten yolk of egg, then into the finest crumbs mixed with salt, white pepper, a little grated nutmeg, fine lemon-rind, and chopped parsley fried a fine brown, well drained and dried; and as many egg-balls, the size of a small marble, as the yolks of four eggs will supply. (See Chapter YI.) This quantity will be sufficient for two large tureens of soup; when the whole is not wanted for table at the same time, it is better to add wine only to so much as will be required for immediate consumption, or if it cannot conveniently be divided, to heat the wine in a small saucepan with a little of the soup, to turn it into the tureen, and then to mix it with the remainder by stirring the whole gently after the tureen is filled. Some persons simply put in the cold wine just before the soup is dished, but this is not so well. Whole calf’s head with skin on, boiled hour. Stock: neck of beef, browned in butter, 8 lbs.; lean of ham, \ to f lb. (or a knuckle) ; onions, 4 ; large carrots, 3 ; heads of celery, 3: large bunch sweet herbs; salt, 2 ozs. (as much more to be added when the soup is made as will season it sufficiently) ; thin rind, 1 lemon; peppercorns, 1 dessertspoonful; bones and trimmings of head: 8 hours. Soup: stock, 4 to 5 quarts; flour and butter for thickening, of each 4 ozs,; pounded mace, half-teaspoonful; cayenne, third as much (more of each as needed) ; sherry, half pint: 2 to 3 minutes. Flesh of head and tongue, nearly or quite, 2 lbs.: 1^ to 1^ hour. Forcemeat- balls, 36 ; the brain cut and fried; egg-balls, 16 to 24. Obs.—When the brain is not blanched it must be cut thinner in the form of small cakes, or it will not be done through by the time it has taken enough colour : it may be altogether omitted without much detriment to the soup, and will make an excellent corner dish, if gently stewed in white gravy for half an hour, and served with it thickened with cream and arrow-root, to the consistency of good white sauce, then rather highly seasoned, and mixed with plenty of chopped parsley, and some lemon- juice.

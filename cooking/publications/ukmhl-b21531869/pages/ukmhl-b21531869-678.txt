Scotsman. ZUMPT (PROF.)—A GRAMMAR OF THE LATIN LANGUAGE. By C. G. Zumpt, Ph. D. Professor in the University, and Member of the Royal Academy of Berlin. Translated from the 9th Edition of the original, and adapted to the use of English Students, by Leonhard Schmitz, Ph. D., late of the University of Bonn; with numerous Additions and Corrections by the Author. 8vo. 14s. cloth. “ It would seem by a preface to this translation, from the pen of Professor Zumpt himself, that the translation so long in use in our English schools and colleges has not been satis- factory to the learned author. He describes it as imperfect, inaccurate, and translated from an early edition; ‘ while the German original, by continued labour on my part, hud in its details become quite a different work.' To the new translation, here published, he has given every assistance. Though the edition from which it is translated has appeared within a year, his unceasing philological labours had already collected a large number of corrections and additions for future use; these he has sent to Dr. Schmitz for incorporation in the English text, and they make the volume before ns more perfect than the German original. The Professor expresses the greatest confidence in his translator's learning and accuracy ; and intimates that it will henceforth be their ‘ united endeavour ’ to remedy what deficiences may be found. Thus, beyond all question, is the work of Dr. Schmitz henceforward the authorized version of Zumpt'^Grammar: a book which well deserves its great celebrity and the high esteem by which it is held by the best scholars. To the better education of both Germany and England in that knowledge of. antiquity which is so essential to mental culture, Professor Zumpt has contributed not a little by his admirable Latin Grammar."—Examiner.

To that great class such a booh is invaluable. It ought, in fact, to form part of the library of every one interested in rural affairs; for there are few plants so difficult to distinguish as grasses, not any more so, and none which it is more important to know correctly, because of their various uses and qualities. With Mr. Knapp’s book before him, no one can have the least difficulty in making himself master of the subject.” Gardeners’ Chronicle.

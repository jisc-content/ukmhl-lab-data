The subjects handled in a commercial dictionary are not of a stationary but a progressive character, and those who mostly use such repertories are not curious about historical notices or theoretical discussions, but concern themselves solely with practical details immediately connected with the present moment. The changes made in our commer- cial policy by the Tariff Act o/T842, and the late acts for regulating the corn and colonial trades, are so multiform, so important, and affect so many articles and interests, that Mr. M'Culloch despaired of introducing them into a supplement of a less size than the original worh, he has therefore reconstructed his dictionary altogether. We have carefully examined this vast work, and are of opinion that the indefatigable author has produced a digest of the most useful and authentic information respecting the past and present state of the commerce of Europe and the world at large, and the laws and regulations under which commercial operations are carried on. We have not space, nor would it be useful if we had, to enumerate the new subjects treated in the edition before us; it will suffice practical men to be assured that in the course of their business scarcely any commercial question can a rise upon which they will not find useful information in Mr M'Cnllech's well-stored pages.” From an article on Mr. M‘Culloch’s Dictionary in the “ Times” newspaper.

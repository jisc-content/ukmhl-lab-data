Pound to the smoothest paste the coral of one or two fine lobsters, mix with it about a third of its volume of fresh hutter, and the same proportion of spices as are given in the preceding receipt. Let the whole be thoroughly blended; set it by for a while in a cool place and pot it, or make it up into small pats and serve them with curled parsley round the dish, or with any light foliage that will contrast well with their brilliant colour. The flesh of the lobster may be cut fine with a very sharp knife, and pounded with the coral. POTTED SHRIMPS, OR PRAWNS. (Delicious.) Let the fish be quite freshly boiled, shell them quickly, and just before they are put into the mortar, chop them a little with a very sharp knife; pound them perfectly with a small quantity of fresh butter, mace, and cayenne. Shrimps (unshelled), 2 quarts; butter, 2 to 4 ozs.; mace, 1 small lal:spoonful; cayenne, ^ as much. POTTED MUSHROOMS.

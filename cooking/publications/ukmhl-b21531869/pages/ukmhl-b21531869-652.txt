Its most remarkable portion bears upon an important question, on which there still exist some differences of opinion, viz. the intrigues which led to the junction of the Duke of Newcastle and Pitt, in 1757- The letters respecting the state of Ireland under the Viceroyalty of the Duke of Bedford also, are not a little interesting.”—Morning Herald. *** Vol. III. to complete the work, is in preparation.

APPENDIX. 5S2 or very finely chopped, two ounces of candied orange or lemon- rind shred extremely small, and six ounces of jar raisins stoned and quartered: to these the Germans add a rather high flavour- ing of cinnamon, which is a very favourite spice with them, but a grating of nutmeg, and some fresh lemon-peel, are, we think, preferable for this composition. Mix all the ingredients well together; roll out some butter-crust a full back-of-knife thick- ness, cut it into four-inch squares, brush the edges to the depth of an inch round with beaten egg, fill them with the mixture, lay another square of paste on each, press them very securely together, make, with the point of a knife, a small incision in the top of each, glaze them or not at pleasure, and bake them rather slowly, that the raisins may have time to become tender.

A small, but very inex- pensive set of tin cutters must be had for this prety form of pastry, which is, however, ' quite worthy of so slight a cost.

The easier mode of placing them regularly, is to raise each ring without removing the small cutter from it, to moisten it with a camelâ€™s hair brush dipped in white of egg, and to lay it on the paste as it is gently loosened from the tin. When all the pastry is prepared, set it into a very gentle oven, that it may become crisp and yet remain

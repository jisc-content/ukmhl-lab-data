CHAP. VIII.] BEEF. 169 To brown the surface of a dish without baking or 'placing it at the fire. This is done with a salamander, as it is called, formed like the engraving below; it is heated in the fire, and held over the dish sufficiently near to give it colour. It is very much used in a superior order of cookery. A kitchen shovel is sometimes sub- stituted for it on an emergency. CHAPTER VIII. BEEF. No. ]. Sirloin. 2. Rump. 3. Edge-bone. 4.

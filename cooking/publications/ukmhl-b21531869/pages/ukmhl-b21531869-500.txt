Trevet. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. Fruit for preserving should always he gathered in perfectly dry weather; it should also be free both from the morning and evening dew, and as much so as possible from dust. When bottled, it must be steamed or baked during the day on which it is gathered, or there will be a great loss from the bursting of the bottles; and for jams and jellies it cannot be too soon boiled down after it is taken from the trees. The small portable French stove, or furnace,* shown above, with the trevet and stewpan adapted to it, is exceedingly con- venient for all preparations whicii require either more than usual attention, or a fire entirely free from smoke; as it can be placed on a table in a clear light, and the heat can be regu- lated at pleasure. It has been used for all the preserves of * Called in France, Un Forneau Economiqite. To be had of Mr. Livermore, 30, Oxford-street, at a very trifling expense, not more than seven shillings; the stewpan, of course, not included. A baking-tin should be placed on the table for the furnace to stand upon, to guard against danger from the ashes or embers falling from it.

EGGS A LA PORTUGAISE. 121 take the tin from the oven, with a slice lift the potato ovals, lay them on a hot dish, put a well- drained sausage, free from all fat, upon each, and serve. Cut up six tomatoes weighing in all, say, three- quarters of a pound ; cut up very finely one small shallot, say, half an ounce. Put half an ounce of butter at the bottom I29, fggs oi a small stewpan, melt it and put in the minced shallot, season with spiced pepper and salt, fry over a low fire till turning pale golden brown, then add the toma- toes, increase the fire, now stirring the tomatoes well, the object being to reduce their wateriness somewhat. When nicely pulped, pass the mix- ture through the sieve and put it aside. In the morning butter a fire-proof china dish, arrange the puree on the bottom of it, warm this in the oven, take it out, hollow out with a spoon six little cavities in the tomato bed and slip a raw fresh egg into each of them. Place the dish in the oven again till the eggs have set nicely, and serve.

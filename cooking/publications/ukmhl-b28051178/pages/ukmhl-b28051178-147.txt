OMELETTES WITH SALMON. 139 curry (No. 20) ; chop up five ounces of uncooked lean ham, and eight or ten ounces of cold cooked chicken. Put the ham into a small frying-pan with an ounce of butter and r49- Jam' give it a fry till fit to serve, then stir in^ the cooked chicken, season with spiced pepper, and turn the contents of the pan into the vessel containing the hot rice, which by this time should be drained and dry. Serve well mixed on a very hot dish.1 Here the method is as nearly as possible the same as that adopted for the oyster omelette, and by its means half a pound of cold cooked salmon can be turned to capital account. I5Â°- 0me' Break up the salmon, but not too finely, ^aimon^* and moisten it in a stewpan over a low fire, or in the bain-marie, either with the sauce left the previous evening or a quarter of a pint of melted butter sauce made with the salmon boilings. Add half of this, quite hot, but not boiling, to each of the omelettes in the same way as the oysters in No. 147. 1 This dish is improved by stirring into the rice a coffee- cupful of tomato ketchup and giving the whole a dusting of grated Parmesan.

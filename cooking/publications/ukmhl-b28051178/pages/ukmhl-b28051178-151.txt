143 APPENDIX. or buttermilk by degrees, working the dough with the wooden spoons. Nine tablespoonfuls, provided that the flour be of fine quality, should suffice if the operator work skilfully. When ready, turn this out upon a floured pastry board, divide the dough into eight equal portions, pat them into a round shape with the spoons, and place them in eight buttered patty pans. Arrange these upon a baking sheet, wet the surfaces of the rolls with a brush that has been dipped into milk, and slip the sheet into the oven, which should be rather brisk. When the rolls have risen and taken a pale brown colour, they may be taken out of the oven, turned out of the patty pans, and served in a hot napkin. Time, from twelve to fifteen minutes. 2. French Rolls.—For six French rolls exactly double the quantities given in the preceding recipe should be taken, with the addition of one fresh egg. Work in the same way, adding the egg well beaten at the commencement of the moistening, then enough milk to form a firm dough. When smooth, turn this out on a floured pastry board, divide it into six portions, and pat these into elongated oval shapes ; lay these in well-buttered French roll tins, brush them over with milk, and set them upon a baking sheet, finishing as in the previous case. 3. Vienna Rolls.—The difference here consists in the shape alone. Having worked the dough as for French rolls, turn it out on a floured board, divide it into six portions, roll these out into sausage shapes an inch and a half thick in the centre, tapering somewhat towards the ends, curve them in the form of crescents, lay them on a buttered baking tin, brush them over with milk, and bake about fifteen minutes.

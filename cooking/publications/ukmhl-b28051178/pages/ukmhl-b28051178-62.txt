The minced herbs mentioned in No. 6 can be stirred in with the yolks if liked, and a teaspoonful of salt should be mixed with them also. If you possess a glazing-iron, heat it, and pass it closely above the surface of the omelette while the bottom is setting. In any case the upper side remains frothy, and is buried as the omelette laps over in dishing. It is as light as a souffle, and sweet omelettes thus cooked are excellent. N.B.â€”Owing to the frothiness of the mixture a large pan is necessary. If this be not available it will be safer to divide the mixture, putting it into two bowls separately, and to cook each independently. The fire should not be too fierce.

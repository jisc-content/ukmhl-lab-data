MENU XLV. Fried sprats. Broiled fowl with mushrooms. Eggs with liver. Irish scones. When sprats are in season they make a nice breakfast dish. Treat them as much as possible as you would whitebait: flour, fry at a gallop in a boiling fat, dram, dry well, sprinkle with salt, and serve with brown bread-and-butter and lemon. They may be egged, crumbed, and served as smelts, but this is more troublesome than flouring. Choose the drumsticks and thighs of a couple of cold roast fowls; score, rub with butter, season with salt and spiced pepper, Broileu grill on a well-buttered gridiron. Treat fowl with six or eight nice-sized mushrooms in mush- like manner. Dish the latter on rooms, crofitons of fried bread with the broiled fowl arranged round them.

Properly speaking, according to old Scottish custom, these scones should be cooked on a “girdle,” i.e., a thick circular piece of iron about a foot and a half in diameter, which should be suspended or held over a clear fire and heated till a few grains of salt laid upon its surface crackle ; this having been brushed off, the cakes or scones should be laid upon the girdle, occa- sionally turned, and taken off with a slice (the “ spurtle ”) when they are nicely browned. But this process is in these days of closed ranges unnecessary, ingenious as it may have been when the cook had to do her best with only a primitive open fire to work with. Scones can now be cooked “ girdle ’’-wise in a thick iron plate or frying-pan on the hot plate of the range, or on a baking sheet in the oven. A good bottom heat is obviously the thing that is needed. You can see scones beautifully cooked by electricity at Messrs. Verity’s, in Regent Street, on this principle. But to return to the case in hand. Having mixed the dough as in No. 11, turn it out upon a board, dredge it over with flour, and roll it out a third of an inch thick, cut this into three-inch squares, double the opposite corners over, forming three-cornered shapes, and bake on a buttered tin in the oven eight or ten minutes ; or lay them upon a heated iron frying-pan upon the hot plate, and treat them in the manner just described for the girdle scones. 14.

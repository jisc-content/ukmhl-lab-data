FIFTY BREAKFASTS. l6 shakes, and with your spoon coax the omelette to slide out of the omelette pan into the hot entree dish ready for it. If carefully done the omelette will roll over, enveloping within it the partly formed mixture that remained on its surface, and on reaching the dish will spread itself rather, retaining no specially oval or bolsterlike shape, with a little of the juicy golden mixture escaping from its edges. Omelettes that are presented in neat crescent or elongated oval shapes are as a rule puddings in their consistency, over-cooked, and heavy. After turning out the first omelette, wipe the pan, do not wash it, and repeat the same process with the second basin of mixture, sending the omelettes to table “ hot and hot,” so to speak. A small pat of butter, and chopped parsley should be put into the dish before the omelette is turned into it. Timed by the seconds-hand of a watch this omelette takes forty-five seconds from the moment of being poured into the pan to that of its being turned into the dish. Be sure that the pan is hot enough to receive the mixture in the first instance, and that the fire is brisk beneath it while frying ; a powerful gas boiling-stove, circular in shape like the “ Regina,” is suitable for this work. N.B.—If the chives and chervil were omitted this would be an omelette au persil. An omelette aux fines herbes is made with a totally different garniture.

in EGGS WITH OYSTERS. boil the oysters will be leathery. Now take out the oysters, thicken the broth, put them in again, and keep this in a china or earthenware bowl during the night. In the morning boil six eggs hard ; cool them in cold water ; slice them crosswise, butter a fire- proof baking dish, put a layer of the eggs at the bottom of it, arrange the oysters, now taken out of the sauce, over this, and cover with another layer of egg slices, seasoning each layer with pepper and salt, moisten the whole with the oyster sauce, cover the surface with raspings somewhat thickly strewn, and put the dish in the oven until steaming, when serve. This is obviously an easy way of disposing of any oyster sauce left from dinner the previous evening.

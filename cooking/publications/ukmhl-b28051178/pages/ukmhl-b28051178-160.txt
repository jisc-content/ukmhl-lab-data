APPENDIX. 152 toasted at some little distance from the clear smokeless embers, patiently, till each side has turned a nice pale golden brown. Sir Henry Thompson’s dry toast is made in this way :—The slices are cut somewhat thicker — three-eighths of an inch — and slightly coloured on both sides. A sharp knife is then passed horizontally through the softish centre part, making two pieces of each slice. The inner sides are now toasted, and nice crisp dry toast is the result. 23. Anti-fat Toast, for those who have to think twice about eating bread, is easily made as follows :— Cut a stale tin-baked loaf into thin slices (one-eighth of an inch thick at the outside), lay these on a wire drainer in the oven till they crispen and turn yellowish brown. If a good quantity of it be prepared, this toast can be kept in a biscuit tin, and will be quite nice for two or three days. Excellent whether for breakfast, luncheon, or dinner.

MENU XXVIII. ABSTINENCE. Semolina fritters of fish. Vegetable curry (Malay). Eggs a la voyageuse. Indian crumpets. Boil twelve ounces of semolina in sufficient milk to form a paste. Let it get cold, then roll it out a quarter of an inch thick, and line a dozen oval tartlet moulds with it $2- ^emo* Fill these with a stiffly reduced linafrit' shrimp sauce, in which the shrimps,*”^’ cut into dice are plentiful. Close over each little patty thus formed with a covering of semolina paste, wet the edges, pinch the tops securely to the lining, and then take them out of the moulds, egg, bread-crumb, and fry in very ot fat, like rissoles. Drain, dry, and send in on a napkin with fried parsley. These can be pre- pared, all but the frying, overnight. Remains of lobster oysters, scallops, or prawns, may be similarly cooked. y Si 7

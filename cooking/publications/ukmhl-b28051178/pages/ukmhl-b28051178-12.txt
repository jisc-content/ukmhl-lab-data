4 FIFTY BREAKFASTS. Fried fish is, as a rule, a popular thing for breakfast, and if the cook bear in mind that second frying by no means spoils fillets, &c., that may have been so cooked the evening before, she will readily fall back on this method of re- cooking them. A plunge of two or three minutes’ duration into very hot fat is all that is required, followed by draining, drying carefully, and service on a hot napkin. Soles should be cross-cut in pieces two and a half inches wide, or filleted, and whitings are much nicer when not curled round in the manner so invariably adopted by London fishmongers. A propos of frying, I take it for granted that in all well-regulated kitchens a supply of good, stale, oven-dried, and finely sifted white crumbs, as well as a bottle of well-rasped light-brown crust, is always kept ready for use. Fresh spongy crumbs are wholly unfit for “ breading ” cutlets, croquettes, fish, and so on. Finely grated, hard, dry, mild cheese—not necessarily Parmesan or Gruyere—should always be similarly stored. An almost essentially necessary article in this Dranch of cookery is a wire drainer—such as confectioners use. Upon this croquettes, rissoles) fried fillets, even a fried sole, can be set to dry thoroughly after draining, for which purpose the drainer should either be placed in the mouth of the oven—the door ajar—or in front of the fire.

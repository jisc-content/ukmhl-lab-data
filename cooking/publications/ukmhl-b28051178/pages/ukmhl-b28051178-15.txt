7 INTRODUCTION. ten seconds put out the lamp, covering the saucepan closely. In eight minutes an ordinary hen’s egg will be ready, the albumen soft, and the yolk nicely formed. The common method of boiling eggs at a gallop for three minutes has the effect of over-cooking the albumen and rendering it indigestible, while the yolk is scarcely done at all. Good tea and coffee are, it need scarcely be said, important elements of a good English breakfast. To secure them it is really neces- sary, after having chosen the tea and coffee that suit you best, to be liberal in dispensing them. A proper cup of either is out of the ques- tion if the allowance be too narrowly curtailed. The practice of doling out tea by carefully measured teaspoonfuls (handed down to us by our elderly maiden aunts) was perhaps neces- sary in the days when the only leaf in the market came from China and cost from four to five shillings a pound. The required strength was then obtained by the pernicious system of setting the tea “ to draw.” People now, how- ever, have come to understand that to be whole- some tea must be produced by rapid infusion, not by a long process of steeping, and in order to get this at its best a good allowance of the leaf is necessary. Teapots are to be got with perforated cylinders to hold the tea, which can be withdrawn after an infusion of five minutes.

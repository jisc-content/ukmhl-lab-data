MENU XXVII. 79 Fried shell-fish. Chicken pur4e with mushrooms. Egg mole. Oatcakes. A dish of fried shell-fish, as is often presented at the Italian breakfast, is a nice variation from the ordinary routine. Take a dozen fair - sized shelled prawns, and a dozen shelled scallops ; make two pieces of S e ^ each prawn by slicing it lengthwise, and slice the scallops in the same way ; spread a layer of flour on a clean cloth, and roll the pieces of shell-fish in it; let this dry, and then turn them, a ladleful at a time, into a bath of boiling fat. Fry a golden yellow, drain, and pile the crisp fritters (like whitebait) on a napkin ; dust salt over them, and serve with slices of lemon, brown bread-and-butter. N.B. Scallops alone are quite acceptable when thus presented.

CURRIED EGGS. 61 Curried eggs differ from eggs a VIndienne (No. 18), inasmuch as they are hard-boiled, while the latter are poached, and are sim- ^ mered in the curry sauce, not merely covered with it as the poached eggs are. Boil overnight six eggs hard, slice them when cold in halves longitudinally, cut twelve nice fillets of cold cooked vegetable marrow or stewed cucumber, each piece to be about the size of one of the half eggs. Prepare a curry sauce as given for No. 18, put into it the eggs and pieces of marrow, and slowly heat them up to steaming point; let them rest all night thus pre- pared, and simply re-heat the dish in the morn- ing. The curry will be far better if allowed thus to marinade for twelve hours in its own sauce. Fried ham or bacon may accompany.

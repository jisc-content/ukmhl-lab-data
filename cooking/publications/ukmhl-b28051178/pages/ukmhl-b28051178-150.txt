In the directions given for home baking on a small scale, it often happens that certain rule-of-thumb dry measures are given which cannot be considered definite, such as “ cups ” of flour, and “ teaspoonfuls ” — “heaped up” or not, as the case may be — of baking powder. Many find it difficult to decide what cup to choose, and all teaspoons are not made exactly the same size.

With liquids there is less risk of ambiguity than with dry measure, for you cannot “ heap ” them up —a full tablespoonful may be accepted as a fixed quantity, z.e., four tablespoonfuls equal half a gill or a common sherry glass, for the term wine glass is not explicit. x.

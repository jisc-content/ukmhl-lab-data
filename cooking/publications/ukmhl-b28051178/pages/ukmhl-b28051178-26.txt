FIFTY BREAKFASTS. i8 used at dinner the night previously are avail- able, the following may be done : cut the birds up, neatly separating the thighs from the drum- 8 Devilled sticks, and dividing the backs in the fowl; chut- usual manner. Shred an onion very ney sauce finely ; melt half an ounce of butter (Indian). jn a frying-pan, and fry the former till brown. Having meanwhile sprinkled the pieces of fowl with curry powder, and a dust of fine salt, put them into the pan with the butter and onions, turning them about to prevent burning. When the butter seems almost ab- sorbed, turn the fowl and the onions with it into a hot dish. The operation after the pieces of fowl are put in should be conducted over a low fire, the object being to heat the meat thoroughly, and to serve it and the onions as dry as possible without burning. The onions can be brushed off if objected to before serving. For the sauce : melt a quarter of an ounce of butter in a small saucepan, stir in a quarter of an ounce of flour ; when blended well add a teacup- ful of gravy, or broth, mix, and put in a dessert- spoonful of Harvey sauce, the same of mushroom ketchup, a teaspoonful of chilli vinegar, and a dessertspoonful of good chutney. For additional heat, a teaspoonful of finely chopped skin of green chillies may be added, carefully omitting the seeds. Boil, strain, and serve with the fowl as hot as possible.

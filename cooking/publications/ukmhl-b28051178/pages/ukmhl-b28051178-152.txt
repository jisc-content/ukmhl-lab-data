APPENDIX. 144 4. Knotted Rolls.—Here again variety is ob- tained by shaping the dough in a different manner: a crisp crusty roll is thus produced. Roll the portions of dough out into long tubular shapes the thickness of your little finger, tie them in knots, and finish as in the case of Vienna rolls. 5.

Sir Henry Thompson’s Wholemeal Cakes. “ Take two pounds of coarsely-ground whole wheat- meal, and add half a pound of fine flour, or, better still, the same weight of fine Scotch oatmeal. Mix thoroughly with a sufficient quantity of baking powder and a little salt; then rub in two ounces of butter and make into dough—using a wooden spoon—with cold skimmed milk or milk and water, soft in consistence, so that it can almost be poured into the tin ring, which gives it form when baked. In this manner it is to be quickly made into flat cakes (like tea cakes), and baked on a tin, the rings used being about an inch high and seven or eight inches in diameter, each

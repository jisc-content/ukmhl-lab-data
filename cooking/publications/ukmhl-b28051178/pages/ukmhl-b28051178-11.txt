3 INTRODUCTION. nated with “ eggs and bacon ” of many English breakfast tables is wholly inexcusable, so easy is it to provide variety with the exercise of a little consideration. For the “ warming-up ” process there is nothing so safe as the bain-marie. This is a utensil which it is to be hoped every one possesses. Stews, curries, hashes, &c., can thus be re-heated without deterioration, or fear of burning, boiling, or other mishap. As another most capital thing for the prepara- tion of breakfast dishes, I strongly advocate the use of the Dutch oven. This is an old-fashioned contiivance, no doubt, but cheap, and especially handy for the fast cooking of fish and heating gratins. It can be placed in front of the fire closely or at a slight distance according to the degree of heat required, and the cook can see how things placed within it are getting on. This alone gives it an advantage over the ordinary oven, while the food half-baked half- roasted by its means seems crisper and more appetising. Baking dishes in sizes, caisses, and scallop shells of white fire-proof, Limoges ware are to be recommended for use in connection with break- fast. They can be set without risk in the Dutch or common oven, and afford a method of serving minces, re-cooked fish, eggs, and “ remains,” at once tasteful and inviting.

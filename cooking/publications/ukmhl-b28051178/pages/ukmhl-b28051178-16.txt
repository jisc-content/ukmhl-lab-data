FIFTY BREAKFASTS. 8 In this way a capital and quite harmless cup of tea can easily be produced. For coffee-making there are numerous inven- tions more or less ingenious, but after all for really satisfactory, easy, and rapid action nothing surpasses the percolator—“ Hutchinson’s patent ” for choice. A tablespoonful of coffee powder per breakfastcupful of coffee is a fair allowance. Lastly, I would advise all Avho like things hot at breakfast to invest in one of Messrs. Wolff and Co’s “ universal heaters,” sold at 119, New Bond Street, an excellent contrivance for keeping dishes, milk, coffee, &c., hot in the breakfast- room without deterioration, superseding the somewhat cumbersome practice of placing dishes before the fire, and of course a boon during the months when fires are dispensed with.

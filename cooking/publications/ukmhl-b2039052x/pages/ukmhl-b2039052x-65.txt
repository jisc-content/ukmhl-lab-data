SALADS. 49 pickled cucumbers,, shrimps^ and boiled tur- nips ! Althougli a salad should not be dressed until the moment it is required to be eaten^ the dress- ing may be prepared some hours before it is needed for use^ and, where time is precious^ and salads are frequently required^ sufficient for two or three days' supply may be prepared at once, and bottled up ready for use. If you would succeed and have a truly deli- cious salad, malcG your own dressing; let no hands but your own have anything to do with compounding it. Above all^ eschew the com- pounds sold at the grocers under the name of creams or salad dressing.'^ A foolish prejudice exists among many people against salad oil, but when once they have over- come the dislike, they generally end by becom- ing very partial to it ; its judicious use is of great benefit, as it tends to prevent the fermen- tation caused in the stomach by the presence of a raw vegetable, and is a corrective to flatu- lence. It can often be taken in salads by invalids for whom cod-liver oil has been prescribed, which is so disagreeable and difficult to take, and is found to be very nearly as nourishing. P.O. E

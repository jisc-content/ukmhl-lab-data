121 MAIGRE'' DISHES. Cream Cheese Salads. Prepare a little dressing first of all by minc- ing together a small shallot, sprigs of chervil^ thyme, parsley, tarragon, etc., and adding to them a pinch of salt and pepper, with a table- spoonful of lemon juice and three of salad oil; then mix all well together. Separate the leaves of a crisp, well-hearted lettuce; in the hollow of each leaf place a little rocky lump of cream cheese. Pour a sj)oonful of the dressing over, then arrange the leaves singly on a dish. Garnish with red radishes. Cheese Omelette. Break four eggs on to a plate, add to them a pinch of salt and pepper, and a spoonful of grated cheese; beat up with the blade of a knife. Pour the mixture into the omelette pan, which should contain plenty of frothing butter. Stir it once or twice, when it is set sufiiciently, fold one half over, slip it out on to a dish, grate a little more cheese on the top, and serve very hot. If not too stale, the cheese may be sliced, instead of grated.

SALADS. 4S turtium leaves and flowers and maiigclds may also be used. Botli the latter flowers are edible, and have a pleasant flavour. Of meat salads, chicken salad, or mayonnaise, is the most commonly known, but most poultry and game may be treated in this way. A very appetising way of treating the remains of cold beef is to cut it into dice, excluding all fat and gristle (a very small piece of meat is needed), then to add a good tablespoonful of chopped parsley and chives, and dress as a salad with mustard and oil and vinegar; this goes by the name of a persillade.^^ Fish, too, such as cold salmon or turbot, hali- but and cod, with lobster, either by itself or as a garniture to the first-named, all four being treated in this manner ; eggs should always be included in the dressing. The coral of a lobster is most valuable as a decoration. Lettuce and watercress salads are invariably served with omelettes and most other dishes made with eggs ; and with hot meat and gravy they are a delicious accompaniment, many people, particularly gentlemen, preferring them thus instead of to cold meat. Joan Cromwell's grand salad was composed of equal parts of almonds, raisins, capers.

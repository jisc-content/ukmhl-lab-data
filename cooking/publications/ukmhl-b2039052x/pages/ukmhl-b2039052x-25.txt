ECONOMY AS THE SOUL OF COOKERY, 9 in England as a ^^Dutcli oven/' but for all her only fuel is wood coal â€”cliarbon de bois/' By the way^ these charcoal stoves are so easy to set up^ and so useful for many purposes, that it is a marvel they are so little known in England. Built of brick, either in a recess or close to a kitchen wall; for neatness, the front and sides are covered with tiles, and the edges bound with iron. An opening a few inches square, with a grating above it, holds the char- coal, which lights rapidly and gives no smoke. When not in use, the grating can be covered with a loose tile, and the flat top will serve as an extra table. During the course of a dinner it will render astonishing service for sauces, side dishes, etc. In most French kitchens one of these fur- naces is to be found, generally fitted with two or three gratings, and the bourgeoise will prefer to use it for her soup pot, rather than trust the latter to the more variable heat of her cuisiniere.'^ The true French cuisiniere, or range, is very different, and in many respects much superior to, as well as far simpler than, its English com- peer.

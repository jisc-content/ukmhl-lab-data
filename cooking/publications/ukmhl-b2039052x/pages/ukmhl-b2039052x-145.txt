FRJCASSAeS and RECHAUFFEES, 129 with water and leave to cook gently in a corner of the oven for some time—about a couple of hours. A frlcandeau is similar to the above^ only the meat would be left in one piece—a short thick piece is to be preferred^ and if lean it may be larded. A slice of fat pork or bacon should cover the bottom of the stewpan; any vegetables may be used for this, and they should be placed around the piece of meat and over it. A cupful of stock poured over all. When cooked the meat and vegetables should be lifted on to a dish, the gravy skimmed from all fat_, and a little thickening and seasoning added; it should then be allowed to boil a few minutes before pouring over the dish. Nearly all fricandeaux are made after this fashion ; salsify, chicory or sorrel, and spinach, are good vegetables to use for this dish. Curries are well known in England, but the preparations known as ^^a la financiered^ may be somewhat novel. Various small things go to the composition of a financiere sauce—mushrooms, quenelles, cockscombs, sweetbreads sliced, sometimes truffles, giblets, etc.; these are slowly cooked in a rich brown sauce, and a glass of good wine.

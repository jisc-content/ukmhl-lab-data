FRYING AND SAUTE''-ING. 85 It is really more difficult to saute to perfec- tion than it is to fry well. In tlie former case^ the great point to observe is to take care the saute is not too much done^ as in that case it will not be eatable. To toss it light and quickly, and remove before it has had time to become tough, is a safe rule. Potatoes are very frequently dressed in this manner when intended to eat with veal or pork; finely chopped parsley is sprinkled over them just before serving. Cold boiled potatoes are by this means rendered equal to fresh ones. Carrots, turnips, and parsnips, with a variety of beans, are all excellent if so treated. Eggs may be lightly tossed in the saute pan without actually making an omelette of them. Parsley is a great addition to all sautes. A favourite form of using up cold meat by frying is to make rissoles. Remains of any meat or poultry, with a few bread-crumbs, herbs and a minced shallot, and a little good sauce to moisten the whole. Roll out a sheet of paste (puff paste is the best) to an eighth of an inch in thickness, cut into squares, place a little of the mince in the middle, fold over securely, and fasten the edges together with white of egg: plunge into the pan

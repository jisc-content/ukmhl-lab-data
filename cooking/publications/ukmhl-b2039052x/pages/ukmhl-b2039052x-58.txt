42 VEGETABLES AND VEGETABLE DISHES, Curried Vegetables. The following vegetables all make excel- lent curries^ and this form of serving vegetables makes a pleasant variation^ besides being a very savoury one. The addition of a little dessicated cocoanut (purchasable from any grocer in tins) gives a delicacy to the flavour. Potatoes^ celerj^^, onions^ turnips^ parsnips^ artichokes^ haricots_, broad beans^ vegetable marrowS; and cucumbers. For a hroiiii curry proceed as follows:â€” Have ready some hot fat^ enough to fry the vegetables with ease. Have the latter cut in slices or small even- sized pieces; fry them until brown and tender through ; sprinkle them all over with a little carry powder^ and add sufficient salt. If you have no brown thickening ready made^ dredge the vegetables with a little baked flour before they leave the frying-pan; then pour in a good cupful of clear stocky a spoonful of Nabob ^' or other sharp sauce and ketchups a pinch of cocoanut; and half the juice of a lemon. Let all simmer together for several minutes, then serve in the same way as a meat curry.

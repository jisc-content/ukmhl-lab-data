i62 FRUIT ''EN SALADE'' AND ''GLACE: Skin the walnuts and pound tliem^ the almonds likewise^, grate the cocoanut. A tablespoonful of liqueur, say Prunelle or Kummelj will be an improvement to any fruit salad. Very ripe blackberries, with a little less sugar, and Port wine or Roussillon, or instead a sm.all tumblerful of Blackberry Cordial and a table- spoonful of Brandy, makes a very wholesome dessert dish. Fruit may be kept fresh for a length of time by putting it into stone jars and covering with a mixture of honey and water. When required for use, take them out, wash in clean water, and they will be almost as good as freshly-gathered. A very easy way of candying fresh fruit such as ripe currants in bunches, grapes, etc., is done by taking them by the stalk, dipping into a tumbler containing water and the white of an egg, then rolling them in fine castor sugar and laying on sheets of note paper to dry, either in the sun or in a cool oven. To candy fruit properly, however, is a much more serious process.

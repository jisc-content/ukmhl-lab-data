THE PROFESSION OF COOKERY, xi kitchen. If our girls and young -women would study cookery as they study French and German, starting from the A, 0, and progressing upwards, step by step, studying it in all its branches until they might be said to have graduated/^ there would then be hope that our kitchens might become as attractive to visit as the studio or the music room. The knowledge of how to save labour, and economise not only time, but strength—which is the real test of the practical from the theo- retical—in this profession as in all others, is only acquired by the earnest student. If the natural taste for this be dull^ the more need to lay to it strength of will—resolution born of a just judgment of the importance of the knowledge she would acquire. On the other hand, however good her inten- tions may be, without this knowledge a great deal of toil will be needlessly expended; the result mortification, and the heavy, wearing sense of inferiority that puts the novice so soon out of heart.

I20 MAIGRE'' DISHES, Cheese Fricassee. Frizzle a sliced Spanish onion in a little but- ter ; when brown, add to it a tablespoonful of brown roux or other brown sauce^ sufficient warm water to make it of the right consistency; season it well. Slice into this some stale Stilton, Cheddar^ or other cheese^ and let it gradually become very hot, but beware of allowing it to boil. Serve very hot, with toast fingers'^ or with boiled cauliflower. Cheese Sandwiches. Cut some thin slices of bread and butter, brown or white ; cut off all crust. Spread grated cheese plentifully between, and pepper them well. Cut into small squares, and garnish with fresh watercress or parsley. Very nice for luncheon or supper, with celery or w^atercress. AnotJier way : Spread cream cheese over the bread in lieu of butter; sprinkle with chopped cress^ pepper lightly, and dast with salt.

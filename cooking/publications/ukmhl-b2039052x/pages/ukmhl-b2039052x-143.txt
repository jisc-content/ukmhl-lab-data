FRICASSEES AND RECHAUFFEES, 127 appetising dish may be obtained at a little cost. The potatoes which accompany this should also be fried. Another nice way^ supposing the menagere has some cold lean beef—not too much cooked —which requires warming up, is to cut it into thin strips and slice some bacon very thinly, laying beef and bacon together; roll them up, fastening with a tiny skewer, and then dip in batter and fry them. A sauce piquante should be served with the rolls. Then, again, meat may be cut into dice, with a little fat bacon, a little cooked vegetable, and chopped onion, and fried in some hot fat in the saute pan. Let this be lightly tossed about until just brown, remove all superfluous fat and dredge a little flour over all; a cupful of stock liquor should be poured in and the saute pan drawn away from the fire, leaving it to cook gently while you make a potato crust, either of cold mashed potatoes or freshly cooked ones. Mix them with an egg and a little milk to make them smooth, then cover a shallow tin plate about half an inch thick with this crust, crimp the edges and bake until brown, when the con- tents of the saute pan should be poured into the middle.

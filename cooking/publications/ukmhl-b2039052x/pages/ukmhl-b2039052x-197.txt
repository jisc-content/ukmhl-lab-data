THE DEJEUNER A LA FOURCHETTE. i8i Sardines are perliaps the most esteemed com- mencement for a dejeuner, as oysters are most liked as a preface to a good dinner. One very effective little appetiser, and admir- ably adapted to commence a dejeuner with, is made as follows :â€”Some small round pieces are cut from a stale loaf, then fried a light golden colour in hot fat, and allowed to cool. Some olives are then stewed, and a few anchovies neatly filleted; these last-named are rolled up and slipped into the stoned olives. Next a drop of stiff mayonnaise sauce is placed upon the tiny round of fried bread, the olive is fixed upon this, and another drop of sauce crowns the whole, or a bit of bright aspic jelly. The mingled flavours of olive, anchovy, and sauce are delicious. Anchovy toast is also a very nice commencement to a dejeuner. We will now consider a few dishes suitable for a simple family dejeuner, and equally suited for the luncheon table of our English friends. Let us suppose that sardines have been first handed round, as they are available at all times of the year. Nothing but a good piece of bread is required with them. It need not be hinted that this is a very unsubstantial commencement to a meal; remember it is only the appetiser.

ENTREES AND ENTREMETS. 173 When the crusfc is baked the bread is re- moved and the proper filling takes its place, then the upper crast is laid over and glazed with white of egg. This filling may be varied according to fancyâ€”a financiere ragout, sweet- breads, oysters, lobsters, shrimps, etc. When fish is used, the top of the vol-au-vent should be ornamented with the same or similar small fish. Whatever is chosen for the filling should be cooked in a sauce, thick, rich, and suited to its individual character: oysters, shrimps, fillets of sole, etc., in thick white sauce with cream ; ragouts of meat, poultry, etc., in brown sauce. Button mushrooms are a great addition to the last-named. Sweet vol-au-vents, made of fruit cooked as for a compote or jam placed in the hollow and a whipped cream over the top, are very de- licious. The following short lists may be useful as a guide to what are really orthodox and reliable entrees. A few selected entremets are also ap- pended.

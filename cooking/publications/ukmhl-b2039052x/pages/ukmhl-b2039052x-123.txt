MAIGRE'' DISHES, 107 difficult to find vegetables to make separate dislies from^ the winter's supply being nearly exhausted^ or becoming tough, while it is still too early in the year to look for fresh ones. The ^^menagere/' therefore, looks to her fowl pen as her great resource, and, fortunately, eggs are by then both good and plentiful and fairly cheap. Fish is generally abundant at that time, and a good choice to be had. Almost all vegetable soups come under the title of ^^maigre,^^ but ^'^potage au lait'^ is eminently entitled to do so. In the best cuisines it is made after this fashion. A quart of milk is boiled for a little time to extract the flavour from a small piece of lemon rind, a few coriander seeds, and a small piece of stick cinnamon ; a pinch of salt and several Jumps of sugar. It is then strained, and a small quantity poured over the soft part of a thick slice of bread cut into dice, and put in the tureen. This is placed where it will keep hot, and into the remainder of the milk two yolks of eggs should be stirred, and then allowed to boil till they slightly thicken the milk, when it also is poured into the tureen and served immedi- ately.

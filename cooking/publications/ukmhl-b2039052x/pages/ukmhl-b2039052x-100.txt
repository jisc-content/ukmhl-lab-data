84 FRYING AND SAUTE''~ING, marcliand de pommes-de-terre frites/^ whose stall is sucli a common sight in the streets of all French towns. His little furnace is filled with coke^ red-hot^ the iron pan_, slung on a chain^ so that he can raise or lower it at will^ is three parts full of boiling fat. The fat he prefers^ by the bye^ is suet melted^ as it is clear and tasteless. The potatoes^ pared, drained, and cut into finger lengths by a little machine made for the purpose, are thrown into the pan, and occa- sionally stirred about; a few minutes see them cooked, brown and crisp, then the pan is drawn up, the potatoes lifted out into the strainer; and here it should be noted how careful he is not to leave one in the fat, lest that should, by being overdone, impart a burnt flavour to the rest. In this same manner suburban Parisian restaurants will turn out the most tempting dishes from the rather coarse and tasteless river fish. If the precaution is taken to have the fat quite boiling, there is no fear of anything be- coming soddened with grease when cooked in this way. Boiling fat is generally still, free from bubbles, and a faint blue vapour may be seen to rise from it.

SOME LITTLE USED VEGETABLES. 139 ounce of butter^ stew the onion and sorrel in this (in a covered stewpan) for about half an hour. Meanwhile_, bring a quart of water to boiling point in the soup-pot^ throw into it a slice of stale white bread cut into dice (no crust)^ and let it boil till the sorrel is ready. Add that next^ then a teaspoonful of salt^ half one of pepper^ and the beaten yolks of two eggs. Let all boil up once^ then pour into the tureen. A pinch of dried herbs or just one grate of nutmeg may be added then. Watercress Soup. The foundation of this soup is best made from a puree of haricot beans. They should have been soaked overnight,, then boiled for two or three hours^ or until they will rub through a sieve. Chop the watercress^ and cook it in butter with an onion also chopped^ as the sorrel was done. Add enough boiling water to the haricot puree to bring it down to the consistency of cream; then stir in the watercress^ etc.^ and any other green herb you may possess. Just before serving stir in a tablespoonful of cream^ and salt and pepper to season it well. A pint of haricots should be sufficient for a quart of good soup.

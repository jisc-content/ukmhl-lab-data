SOME gAtEAUX and COMPOTES, 105 prunes in a stewpan with sufficient fresli water to cover them and a few lumps of sugar. Cover closely and cook slowly for a couple of hours. Compote of Rhubarb. Make a little syrup; cut the rhubarb—after wiping with a clean cloth—into inch lengths. Drop the pieces into the syrup and cook until they show signs of breaking. Remove the fruit to a dish. Add a few drops of lemon juice to the syrup^ boil it until it becomes reduced^ and pour over the rhubarb. When making a compote of strawberries use red currant juice instead of water for the syrup. It is generally sufficient to pour a boiling syrup over ripe strawberries^ having the berries in a dish which will not break^ and letting them lie in the syrup until perfectly cold before re- moving to their proper dish.

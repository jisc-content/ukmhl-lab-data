SALADS, 54 hard-boiled egg^ slireds of fresh lemon^ and chopped pickled wahiut. Dress as preferred. Haricot Bean Mayonnaise. The white haricot beans should have been soaked previous to cooking them^ to ensure their being thoroughly mealy afterwards. When well drained^ mix with them a little mustard and cress^ and the faintest suspicion of raw onion. Pour over all a good mayonnaise or cream dressing. Very nice for luncheon with brown bread and butter. Mushroom Salad. Small or button mushrooms should be used for this. Eemove the outer skins and most of the stalky drop them into boiling salted water^ and boil gently for two or three minutes. Remove them on to a cloth. When quite cold_, sprinkle them with mixed pepper and salt_, and chopped pars- ley. Pile in the salad bowl^ and dredge liber- ally with oil and spiced vinegar.

2 ECONOMY AS THE SOUL OF COOKERY. the absence of tlie soup is the cost as well as the trouble of preparing it. Sometimes it is urged that We think soup disagrees with us/^ or My husband can't take soup"': and yet no Frenchman, whatever his status in life, would think his meal complete without his potage/' Is there any reason to suppose his digestive organs are constructed on a different plan to his brother Englishman's ? The real reason—when soup is found to dis- agree—may generally be traced to its over* strength. It is not intended to furnish solid nutriment, but to supply a want felt by most people for something warm and savoury to begin the meal Avith, and it will also be found to greatly lessen the thirst for drink after- Vy^ards, hence effecting a saving in the wine cupboard. Among the poor, a simple nourishing vege- table soup would be found of great value, largely dispensing with the, at present, almost inevitable jug of beor, to which recourse is had so frequently to ''Svash down" or make up for a dinner often far from appetising. The saving, also, in the consumption of meat when soup takes the precedence, is no small argument in its favour.

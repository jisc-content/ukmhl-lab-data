SOUPS AND PUREES. 25 When fresh button mushrooms are obtain- able, a score of them may be skinned ; then gently boiled for a minute or two, drained, and added to the soup. Puree of Peas or Lentils. Soak these also for a couple of hours. Boil them in the right quantity of water required for the soup. When beginning to dissolve, strain through a sieve as before, and return to the stewpan. Crumble a little stale roll into this liquor, and season with pepper and salt. Chop finely half a dozen fresh spring onions or leeks, a bunch of fresh sweet herbs, and a few leaves of spinach. Cook these in a little butter, then stir into the puree. Pupee of Turnips and Parsnips. Pare half a dozen sound white turnips, and half as many parsnips ; add to them half a head of celery, a bunch of sweet herbs, half a dozen leeks, and an onion. Boil all together in a quart of water for three hours. Strain and rub all well through a colander. Return to the pan; add enough boiling milk to make up the required quantity.

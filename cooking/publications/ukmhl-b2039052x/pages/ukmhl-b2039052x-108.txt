92 SOME gAtEAUX AND COMPOTES, and a little butter are stirred in. Tartlets made of pate feuillete are filled with this. A gateau au riz is a sweet dish very popular in France. Whole rice is cooked in milk till quite soft^ and the milk nearly ab- sorbed; then sugar, lemon-juice, a little butter, and beaten eggs are well stirred in. The mix- ture is poured into a shallow mould, which has been well buttered and coated with fine bread- crumbs and sugar. This is baked until firmly set, when it is turned out, and covered all over with caramel, and ornamented according to fancy. It is always eaten cold. The brioche is quite a difi*erent production to the English bun. One-third of the quantity of flour intended to be used is mixed to a very soft paste with a little frothing yeast and warm water; with the other two-thirds of flour, eggs, a little butter, a few currants, salt, and more warm water are mixed to a soft paste again. These two pastes are then kneaded together to form a dough, which is left to rise several hours ; then the brioches are cut out, brushed over with egg and milk, and baked very quickly. They are exceedingly light, and much liked by people who do not care for sweet cakes. The same mixture is baked in loaves, which are cut up and buttered, as for bread and butter.

164 FRUIT ''EN SALADE'' AND GLAC&! ably now, few amateurs care to attempt the process. Marrons glaces/' the favourite sweetmeat of the few who are able to indulge their liking, are made in this wise {n.h, the same process is employed for Ghinois glaces,^^ or Chinese green- gages, and for crystallized figs) : The chest- nuts are boiled in water until they are quite cooked, then carefully peeled and thrown into cold water to become hard again. In half an hour^s time they are placed in boiling syrup, the which has been boiled till quite stiff. The vessel containing them is then set on one side. The next day the syrup (and chestnuts) is brought to boiling point, then put aside to cool again. This process is repeated four days in succession; at the end of the time the chestnuts or fruit will be found to have absorbed nearly all the syrup, and must then be lifted out on to dishes, and dried off. The process of preserving fruit by evaporation is best performed by means of the mechanical evaporators when possible to obtain these machines; still, by carefully drying in a cool oven (a brick oven is best for the purpose), much valuable fruit might be saved for winter use

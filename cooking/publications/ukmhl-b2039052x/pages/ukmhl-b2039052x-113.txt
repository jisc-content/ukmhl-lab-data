Diplomate. Remove the crust from some thin slices of stale white bread^ and stamp them into small rounds; dip each one in sweet wine. (If pre- ferred, sponge biscuits or stale sponge cakes may be used instead.) Butter a plain round mould. Arrange the rounds evenly at the bottom and sides, sprinkle the bottom with stoned raisins, a few currants and strips of candied peel. Put another layer of bread or biscuits next, and alternate thus with the fruit until the mould is three-quarters filled. Boil a pint of milk, pour it after sweetening upon two beaten eggs, add spice and salt; then care- fully pour this custard into the mould. Let the mould stand for two or three hours, then bake or steam it for three-quarters to one hour. Turn out, and serve with wine or custard sauce poured round it. P.C. H

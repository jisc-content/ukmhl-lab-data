Boil a pint of milk with a pinch of salt; beat to a stiff froth the whites of two eggs also with a pinch of salt^ then drop this snow by small spoonfuls into the boiling milk; they will swell out^ and take but a few moments to cook. Lift them carefully out, let all the milk drain from them, then set on the red puree, and put a sprig of green parsley in the centre of each. This is called Snowballs in Tomatoes/^ and is a very effective dish. Stuffed Tomatoes are great favourites with many people. The tomatoes used in this way should be of a fair size. Remove the core and a small portion of the inside, then fill up with forcemeat, sausage- meat, or any nice mince well seasoned. Place them in a well buttered baking-tin, sprinkle a few bread raspings over the top of each, then bake for ten or fifteen minutes, but do not allow the tomatoes to fall. Tomatoes are very good if simply baked with a little butter, and salt and pepper, but if done an gratin they are better still.

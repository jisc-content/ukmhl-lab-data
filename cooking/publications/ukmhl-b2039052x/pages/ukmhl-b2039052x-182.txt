i66 FRUIT ''EN SALADE'' AND ''GLACE: lieat the sugar in shallow vessels in the oven^ before putting into the juice; it should be so hot the hand can scarcely touch it. Put into the juice when that has boiled for twenty minutes, boil up once more after the sugar is dissolved, then pour into liot jars at once. It will quickly jelly, and be a better colour than if made after the old method, besides retaining better the flavour of the fruit.

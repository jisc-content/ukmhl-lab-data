ii8 MAIGRE'' DISHES, cause the mineral properties of tlie milk have beenleffc behind in the whey. To neutralise the acid remaining in cheese^ and to supply the deficiency mentioned^ he advocates the use of a very small quantity of bicarbonate of potash— a proportion of a quarter of an ounce to every pound of cheese. This addition may be made to almost any dish in cheese cookery^ and in this proportion will never be detected. The experiment is well worth the attention of those who^ liking cheese^ are yet unable to as- similate it. Cheese Pudding*, baked or steamed. Butter a small pudding mould, half fill it with thin slices of stale bread and butter—no crust— and between each slice make a layer of grated cheese. One beaten egg, half a small teaspoon- ful of mixed salt and pepper, and enough warm milk to fill the mould, mixed together, a pinch of bicarbonate of potash being stirred into this, then the mould filled up. Cover with a plate, and let the pudding stand for at least an hour before cooking it. Bake in gentle oven for half an hour, steam for three-quarters.

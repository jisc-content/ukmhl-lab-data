SOME gAtEAUX and COMPOTES, 93 The cakes made at the fetes in the country towns and villages are very similar^ more or less rich^ with or without the fruity according to the custom of the district. Here should be mentioned the tarte/^ the genuine country tart_, which makes its appear- ance on every table when the ducasse or wakes come round. The crust bears some resemblance to the pate d'Eclair/^ but the country flour renders it much more substantial \ the custard which frills it is a wonderful com- pound of eggs, milk and sugar, spice, with here and there an occasional raisin making its appearance. When well made, this compound is very good, but an inferior make has an unfortunate resem- blance to leather, and needs a country appetite to make it go down.^' When making tarts of fresh fruit, the bour- geoise will invariably make a marmalade of her fruit before laying it on her crust; placing a lattice-work of strips of pastry to finish off the top. A fruit pie,'^ or tart, with the crust over the fruit, is quite unknown in France. Puddings are but little adopted in French families, gaufres and biscuits, with ^'^ confiture/^ in winter, or compote of fruit in summer. Fresh fruit and cheese is the general finish to a dinner.

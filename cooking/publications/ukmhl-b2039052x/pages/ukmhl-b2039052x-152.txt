136 SOME LITTLE USED VEGETABLES, put in the cooked spinacli;, add a little pepper^ heat well through, beat lightly with a fork, then fill the croustades, and chop a little cooked beetroot to garnish the top. A puree of spinach with a garnish of poached eggs, or an egg boiled hard, then cut into strips, and a few strips of beetroot interspersed to give colour, is a great improvement to the vege- table plainly boiled. Some thin slices of ham frizzled and placed as a border round a puree of spinach, also makes a very nice dish. Excellent also is Sj)iiiach a la Creme. After melting a small lump of butter in the stewpan, and putting in the spinach to simmer, stir in the beaten yolk of an egg, twopennyworth of cream, and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Let it nearly boil, then pour into a rather deep dish, and place fingers of toasted bread round the edge. This is one of the daintiest dishes known. It has been mentioned before that French cooks often make a fond or foundation to a dish of meat with a puree of spinach or sorrel; but it must be remembered that no cream or eggs should be used then, and less butter, sub- stituting the gravy from the meat instead.

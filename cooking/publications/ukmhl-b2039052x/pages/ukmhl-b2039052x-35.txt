19 SOUPS AND PUREES. are all rendered mucli richer and smoother to the taste if one or two beaten yolks of eggs are added the last thing before bringing to the table. When a white soup is desired_, milk or cream is added^ and the latter should be made hot in a saacepan before putting into the tureen. Turnips^ chestnuts^ potatoes^ Jerusalem arti- chokes^ vegetable marrows^ and white haricot beans_, all make most delicious white soup. The vegetables are indeed few in number which are not pressed into the service of the soup pot in one form or another. In green soups^ where it is desirable to keep the colour nice^ it is well to put the green vegetables in boiling water with a little salt added, and a grain of carbonate of soda, and let the cover of the pot be tilted to allow the steam to escape. A delicate potago, and one which is con- sidered a specific for indigestion by the good people of the south, is made as follows:â€”A good slice of white bread is cut into dice, and put in the tureen, four eggs, yolks and Avhites beaten separately; with the yolks four spoon- fuls of olive oil are mixed, and this is poured over the bread.

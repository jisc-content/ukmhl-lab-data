74 SAUCES. Flavoured Vineg-ars. One or two small bottlesful of vinegars of different flavours will be found most useful for sauces and gravies. As a rule^ steep the herbs or roots in plain vinegar for about a fortnight^ then strain the latter^ put it on in a pan to boil for a short space^ and when cold bottle for use. Horse-radish^ celery^ chili^ garlic, mushroom, and walnut vinegars are made from roots; tarragon, mint, sage, nasturtium, basil, etc., from herbs. Fruit vinegars for sweet sauces, such as rasp- berry, blackberry, plum, etc., are made by steeping the fruit in the vinegar until all the colour and flavour of it has been drawn out, then straining the vinegar into an enamelled pan and boiling it with half its proportion of sugar. Boil for ten minutes, and bottle up w^ell. A very small quantity of flavoured vinegar is sufficient; it must not be used as freely as plain vinegar.

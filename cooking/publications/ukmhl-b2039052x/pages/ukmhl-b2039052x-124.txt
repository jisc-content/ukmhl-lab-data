MAIGRE'' DISHES. io8 Bisque/^ made from crab^ is generally thonglit to be a ratlier rare disb^ but it can be made with very little trouble. From a cooked crab all the flesby part should be taken and carefully pounded in a mortar with an equal quantity of boiled rice^ a little water^ and cayenne pepper; pass it through a tamis^ and add a sufficient quantity of boiling milk or cream; then pour into a hot tureen. A very small quantity of lobster butter (which is simply the coral of a lobster pounded with butter)^ if stirred in^ will turn it a bright red^ and make a very pretty dish. A very delicate and tasty dish of salted cod- fish is made as follows : To clear the fish from salt it is allowed to lie in water for twenty-four hours; it is then slightly boiled^ drained^ ard broken into flakes. Into the saute pan a few knobs of butter are put to melt^ then a little white breads roughly crumbed_, and a teacupful of cold mashed potatoes; these are tossed about with a fork, and a cupful of milk added by degrees, with a good seasoning of pepper; lastly, the flakes of cod are added, and all well beaten with the fork until it froths; it is then poured out into a hot dish and eaten with strips of toasted bread.

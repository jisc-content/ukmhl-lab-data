-A CHAPTER XI. Some little U6e& Degetables* THERE are some few vegetables having a very extensive use in continental house- holds^ which are scarcely ever^ if at all^ used in England. Yet they are just as easy to culti- vate as any other^ and have just as valuable hygienic properties. First among them we must place Sorrel. Except among the enlightened few who can boast a patch in their own garden^ it is almost unknown^ and^ save at Covent Garden_, is scarcely ever seen on the market. On the Continent it is cultivated in quantities; no little cottage garden but has its sorrel-bed^ and sum- mer or winter it appears on the table in various forms—as a soup^ or a puree to eat with meat^ or a sauce—and it is frequently mixed with its sister plant^ the spinach, when making a vegetable dish. 1?3

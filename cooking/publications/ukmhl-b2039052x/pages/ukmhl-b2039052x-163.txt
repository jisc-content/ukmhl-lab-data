147 TOMATOES, addition. They are even better than cucumbers if dressed in this manner and served with cold meats. A puree of tomatoes may be made exactly in the same way as the puree of sorrel or spinach^ and served with hot meat. With veal^ poultry^ sweetbreads^ mutton cutlets^ or pigeons halved and done on the grill, a puree of tomatoes^ highly seasoned and made fairly thick, is a great addition to the dish. The same puree is invaluable as an aid in using up the remains of cold meat. The latter may be merely sliced and laid in the puree to become hot through, or the slices may be lightly frizzled first. In winter the tinned tomatoes will answer the purpose excellently well, therefore it is well to have them in reserve : an un-appetising dish, of cold meat may be quickly transformed into a delicious savoury by their aid at very short notice. An edging of well-boiled rice is a pretty finish to the dish. ^ Plenty of seasoning—especially pepper— should be used with tomatoes, a pinch of cayenne is an advantage.

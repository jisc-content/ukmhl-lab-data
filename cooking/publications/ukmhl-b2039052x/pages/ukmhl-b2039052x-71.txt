SALADS. 55 Potato Salad. Slice some cold boiled potatoes very evenly, sprinkle them all over with finely minced pars- ley and shallots, and strew a little thinly sliced lemon amongst them. Mix a teaspoonful of grated horse-radish with an egg salad dressing, and pour it over. Decorate with sliced beet- root^ pickled walnuts, and sprigs of watercress. Sardine Salad. Shred finely some crisp curly endive, dredge it with pepper and salt, some lemon juice, and the oil of the sardines. Mix very thoroughly_, then pile in the centre of a round glass dish. Border with thin circles of hard-boiled eggs. Take several unbroken sardines; split them open to remove the bone, and sprinkle them with fresh lemon peel and cayenne pepper ; close them up, then sharply cut each sardine into three pieces. Lay these fillets over the top of the prepared endive, and serve. A sausage salad might be made in similar fashion, using slices of Lyons or Bologna sausage cut in fancy shapes. The dressing should have mustard and the yolk of egg added to the other ingredients.

iS2 THE DEJEUNER A LA FOURCHETTE. We will now seriously begin the meal with potage a la puree et au croutons/^ This is made by first boiling split peas and other vege- tables till thoroughly soft^ then passing them through the tamis^ and adding a sufficient quantity of stock or thin broth to make all of the consistency of cream. Season this well; let it heat again_, and while it is doing so^ some bread which has been cut into dice is fried in a little butter till brown^ then put in the tureen, and the boiling puree poured over just before serving. If we had chosen, this same potage might have been made of lentils, haricots, or potatoes, all done exactly the same way. We will presume the menagere has at hand some cold roast beef, from which she purposes to make beef olives.She will first prepare a light forcemeat, bread-crumbs, suet, chopped parsley and herbs, an egg to bind the whole, and pepper and salt; a little fine sausage meat is also an improvement. The roast beef is sliced very thinly, the force- meat laid in small quantities on each slice, and these are then rolled lightly, fastened with a little skewer, and dipped into egg and bread- crumbs, then fried in hot fat for a few minutes.

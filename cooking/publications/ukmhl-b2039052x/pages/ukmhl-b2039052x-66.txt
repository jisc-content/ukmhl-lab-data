SALADS. There are different oils procurable to suit all tastes^ but tlie purest olive oil is always pre- ferred by both French and Swiss people^ and is bought by them in large flagonS; straight from the growers. The principles of salad-making having been broadly given in the foregoing remarks^ recipes for a few choice salads are here appended. Capsicum Salad. An excellent digestive. The capsicums should be rather unripe, although for appearance sake they should be red in colour. Split them, remove the seeds, let them lie in cold water for some hours^ to reduce their pungency. With the fingers pull them to small pieces, and shred some crisp lettuce also. Chop a small onion finely^ and slice up two or three tomatoes. Mix all together in the salad bowl; sprinkle with salt, then pour several spoonfuls of oil and one of vinegar over all, and mix the whole very thoroughly together.

''MAIGRE'' DISHES, 113 After washing and dryings cut it down the middle on tlie white side^ carefully raise the meat from the bones on each side^ but do not lift it right off. Prepare a little light^ well- seasoned stuffing of bread-crumbs^ parsley^ butter-seasoning and egg, no milk; spread this on the under side of the raised flesh, press it down to the bone again^ brush over the surface with beaten egg, sprinkle with seasoned crumbs; lay the fish in a buttered tin, put dabs of butter over the top, and bake for about fifteen minutes in a quick oven. The fish should be well browned on the surface, then slipped out on to a hot dish, and a white or brown sauce, with capers or chopped gherkins, poured around— not over—it. Morue a la Hollandaise. A cod's head and shoulders or a whole fish is best served this way. Boiled in water containing plenty of salt and one or two lemons cut in quarters. Drain it when a skewer will penetrate to the bone with ease. Lay on a folded serviette, place large, mealy, boiled potatoes around it, and tufts of curly parsley. Send pure butter melted to table in a tureen.

THE DAUBIERE'' OR BRAISIEREJ' 8t truffle or two inserted^ and red meats will have tlie contrast of a green nasturtium seed^ etc. I will describe the preparation of a galan- tine de volaille when made of cooked meat. All the flesh parts of a fowl^ previously boiled^ should be sliced very thinly, a small quantity of ham and tongue also, a little sau- sage-meat mixed with chopped parsley, herbs and bread crumbs, and made up into little balls, two eggs hard boiled, also sliced, and a little red beetroot cut into strips. Take a fluted mould, arrange these ingredi- ents in order, having regard to the appearance when turned out, then take a cupful of cloai stock, season it well, add a little gelatine (pre- viously dissolved), colour it a light brown, and pour over all. Place the mould in a corner of the oven to cook gently for an hour, then weight it well, and stand aside till quite cold. A galantine made of fresh meat would, of course, take longer to cook, but it would also require pressing with a weight, as these dishes are intended to be sliced very delicately. As luncheon, supper, or '^reserve dishes they will be found exceedingly useful, looking as well as tasting very good.

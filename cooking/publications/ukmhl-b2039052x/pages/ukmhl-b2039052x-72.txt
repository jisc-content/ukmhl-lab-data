SALADS. 56 Game Salads. Almost any kind of cold game may be dressed as a salad^ and the following general directions will do for all :— The meat must be very thinly sliced—shaved, in fact—in neat pieces. Lettuces^ mnstard and cress^ and any salad herbs obtainable should be arranged in the bowl in alternate layers with the game. Dress with a mixture of chutney and oil^ with a little spiced vinegar^ and decor- ater the surface with chopped jelly. Ham Salad. Cold boiled or baked smoked ham is the best^ although unsmoked may be used. Mix together and put into a fine dredger a small quantity each of celery salt^ cayenne and black pepper, white sugar and allspice. Shave the lean of the ham, and squeeze lemon juice over the pieces, then lightly dredge them with the above mixture. Shave up some white onions and celery, and put them in the salad bowl with a few white lettuce hearts. Add the ham next, then pour several spoonfuls of oil over all and a dash of vinegar. Serve quickly.

LEEKS AND ONIONS. 145 into it^ it not only obviates the necessity of using any onion in the dressing, but gives a piquant, elusive flavouring as difficult to fix as delicious to taste. Chives, too, belong to the onion family. They are worthy of much more popular use and culti- vation than they can boast at present: the root is bulbous, and groves up early in the spring, ready prepared for the omelettes au fines herbes,'^ the soupe or salade printanier ; and for an addition to forcemeat or stuffing they are unrivalled. Thus v^e see that useful and valuable as onions are they cannot well do everything, as in this country they are unfortunately generally ex- pected to. In many greengrocers' shops,—-large ones too —and on the costers' stalls in the street, leeks are a rarity, and always expensive; shallots still rarer, garlic and chives unknown. Even in the country they are seen in but few gardens; and it is no uncommon thing to be asked what is their use. This is a state of affairs which needs remedying; we are conservative to our own loss, and, as a nation, remarkably slow to learn, or add to our knowledge. p.c. L

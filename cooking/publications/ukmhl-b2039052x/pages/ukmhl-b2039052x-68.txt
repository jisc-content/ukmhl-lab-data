SALADS. 52 chopped cliives or shallots with it^ and nearly fill the bowl with this. Dredge with the usual dressing; and mix lightly. Carefully lift the slices of carrot and lay them over the green ; decorate with tufts of scraped horse-radish and sprigs of watercress. Celery Salad. The white stalks of celery should be shred downwards^ then cut into inch lengths^, and piled in the centre of a shallow glass dish. Pour over these a cream salad dressing, and place a tuft of the green leaves on the top. Make a border round the base of pickled red cabbage, a few strips of hard-boiled egg, and an outer edge of celery leaves. Apple Salad. A tasty accompaniment to cold roast pork, goose or raised pie. Keswicks are the best for this purpose, on account of their sharp juiciness and fine green skins. Core the apples, but leave the skins on. Slice them on to a shallow dish^ dust them with cayenne pepper, and sprinkle among them a few finely minced shallots. Place a few split capsi- cums and tiny pickled gherkins about the edge^

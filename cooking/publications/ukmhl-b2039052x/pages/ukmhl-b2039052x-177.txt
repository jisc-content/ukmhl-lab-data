FRUIT ''EN SALADE'' AND GLACE^ i6i its components should be dvij before tlie dress- ing is added to them, whether the salad be composed of a vegetable or fruit. Next to dryness, we must insist upon perfect ripeness when fruit is in question. Hard or un- ripe morsels will spoil any dish. A crystal salad-bowl, or failing that, a deep compote dish, is best for the purpose. Pure white castor sugar, and wine suited to the kind of fruit used, forms the dressing.'^ This should be poured over the fruit at least an hour before it is brought to table. In the case of wild strawberries, plenty of sugar and a little good Claret is used, but for garden strawberries Port is preferable to Claret. With apricots, pineapple, or peaches, use a light sweet wine, like Sherry or Madeira; and for an orange salad a raisin wine (Muscatel) is best suited. For a pound of fruit allow four ounces of sugar, and half a pint of wine. Turn the fruit over occasionally after the dressing has been added, that it may absorb it thoroughly. Oranges should have all the peel removed, especially all the white part, divide them iu their natural divisions and press the pips out. P.G M /

Cheese, or biscuits and jelly^ generally form the closing portion of a dejeuner^ sweet dishes being thought rather out of place, excepting as far as they occur in omelettes. A glass of liqueur is as invariably the final note as a cup of cafe noir, both here and at the dinner ; indeed the mazagran or clear black cofFeC; served in a thick glass tumbler with lump sugar, seems never out of place at any hour of the day. Although resembling a dinner, in general outline, at least, it will be seen that a dejeuner is a far simpler affair. One dish of meat is considered quite sufficient, with a dish of vege- tables or salad to follow it. If a fish course is preferred, and it consists of a fairly substantial kind, as soles, or mackerel, or cod, then meat may be dispensed with al- together, or the potage may be omitted. Simplicity should be one of the characteristics of this repast, as elegance and simplicity may safely travel hand in hand.

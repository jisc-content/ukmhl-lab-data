57 SALADS. Lobster Salad. Mix a well varied green salad^ and add the flakes taken from the larger part of the lobster; make a pyramid of this.

The following are the components of all salad dressings,—the first five being the most com- monly used — Ground pepper, black or white. Salt and celery salt. Mustard. Salad or olive oil.

200 CHAPTER XX. Some strictly French recipes not included in former chapters. Potage aux Marrons. {Chestnut soup.) After having boiled the chestnuts, peel them carefully and pound them in a mortar. Pass them through a sieve, adding a little bouillon or clear stock from time to time. When reduced to a puree add more stock to make the quantity of soup required; add salt, cayenne pepper, and mace to flavour it pleasantly. Boil it up again, then if a white soup is desired, add a teaspoonful of boiling cream ; if a brown soup be preferred, add a little good gravy and a spoonful of brown thickening. Pour over a little fried bread in the tureen.

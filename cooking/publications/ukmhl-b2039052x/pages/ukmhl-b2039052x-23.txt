ECONOMY AS THE SOUL OF COOKERY, 7 healthy children call to be fed. The variety— ever capable of being extended—of these dishes call for chapters to themselves. With regard to economy in cookery, it will have been seen, therefore^, that it consists not so much in living plainly, but rather in so managing and arranging the various dishes which compose the meal, that one shall spare the other—by the use of simple means, lessen- ing the consumption of the more expensive dish or joint. , For the average housekeeper to do this easily and effectively, she must bear in mind at least two points: first, to keep herself an conrant of the commodities which are in season; the time when any article in the market is most plentiful and cheap will generally be found to be the time when it is most wholesome for food. Early or forced varieties are rarely de- sirable for ordinary food, however tempting they may appear, and they are but seldom bought by the truly thrifty housekeeper. Throughout the winter months higher prices are demanded for several kinds of food, but the prudent and wise will forestall the market in this respect, and lay in their stock while they are at the cheapest.

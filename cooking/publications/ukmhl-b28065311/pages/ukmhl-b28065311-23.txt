This should be quite clear, but if desired, half a pound of gravy beef cut into small pieces may be added when the water is put in, in which case, or if the oxtail is very large, rather more than two quarts of water should be used. The larger joints may be kept back and served as an entree on another occasion, with good brown gravy, and mashed potato in the centre. Divide the oxtail into joints and cut off all the fat. Melt the butter in a stewpan, put in the pieces of oxtail, the vegetables well washed and cut into slices, the herbs, spices, and a quarter of a pint of water. Set it over a sharp fire, stirring occasionally until the bottom of the pan is covered with a thickish brown glaze; then stir in the flour, add the two quarts of water (or a little more if it is a large oxtail) and nearly half a tablespoonful of salt; stir until boiling; skim it well, and let it simmer for about five hours, until the meat is very tender; then THICK OXTAIL SOUP Ingredients One oxtail.

PUDDINGS AND COLD SWEETS 87 OATMEAL PUDDING (after the New England manner) Ingredients Half a pint of oatmeal. Two eggs. One pint of boiled milk. Two ounces of currants. A quarter of a pound of suet. Two ounces of stoned raisins. Nutmeg. Sugar. Salt. Steep the oatmeal in the boiled milk over night. In the morning take the finely chopped suet and mix it with the oatmeal and boiled milk, some grated nutmeg, a pinch of salt, the eggs well beaten, raisins, currants, and as much sugar as will sweeten it; stir it all well together, put it into a buttered basin, tie it very closely and boil it for two hours; turn it out and serve with wine or sweet sauce. ORANGE CREAM Ingredients One pint of milk. Half an ounce of leaf gelantine. Four ounces of sugar. Half a pint of cream. Half a pint of orange juice. Put a gill of the milk into a saucepan, and dissolve the gelatine in it; put the rest of the milk into a saucepan, with the thinly cut peel of three oranges, and boil it for two or three minutes; add the sugar, and when it is dissolved strain it into the gelatine; let it get quite cold, then stir in the orange juice, and when it begins to thicken and get firm, stir in the cream, stiffly whipped, and pour it into a mould to set. In hot weather a little more gelatine must be used. ORANGE FOOL Ingredients Half a pint of cream. Sugar. Two oranges. To the juice of the oranges add the rind of one, cut very thin; sweeten to taste, and boil for one minute.

MEATS AND ENTREES 59 TIMBALES OF MUTTON Ingredients Mutton. Pepper and salt. Butter. Breadcrumbs. Gravy. One egg. Parsley and thyme. Pound your mutton very fine in a mortar, with a small bit of butter; add a little good gravy, a little parsley and thyme, pepper and salt to taste, some breadcrumbs, and the egg well beaten. Beat it all well together and cook in moulds, which must be buttered and floured. Steam them for half an hour. Turn out and serve hot with a good brown gravy. VEAL CREAMS Ingredients Half a pound of veal cutlet. Two eggs. Three ounces of panada. Pepper and salt. Four tablespoonfuls of thick Truffles, cream. Take half a pound of raw veal, freed from skin and gristle; cut it into small pieces, pound it fine, add the panada, and pound again; break in the eggs, add a little pepper and salt, and pound it all together in the mortar; rub it through a wire sieve, and mix in the cream. Butter some small moulds, line them with bits of truffle, fill them with the mixture, place them in a saucepan with boiling second white stock, or water, and boil them very gently for twenty minutes. If water is used, it should not cover the moulds. Serve with sauce supreme poured over them.

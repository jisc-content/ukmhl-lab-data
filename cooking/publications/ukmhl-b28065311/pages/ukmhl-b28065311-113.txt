PUDDINGS AND COLD SWEETS 101 Put the currants, water and sugar into a saucepan; set it on the fire, and when they have boiled a few minutes, pass them through a fine hair sieve; when the pulp is quite cold, partly freeze it, whip the cream, add it, and finish freezing. Custard may be used instead of cream, or equal parts of both. Serve in a glass dish, or in ice glasses, ice wafers being handed with it. RASPBERRY ICE CREAM Ingredients One pound of raspberries. Half a pint of cream. Six ounces of castor sugar. Rub the raspberries through a tammy or fine hair sieve; mix in the sugar, and partly freeze it; whip the cream, add it, and finish freezing. Serve in ice or custard glasses; ice wafers should be handed with them. Strawberry and red currant ices may be made in exactly the same way.

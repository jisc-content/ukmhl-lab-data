When the duck is cooked enough, take out the herbs and let the sauce be as thick as cream; dish it up, squeeze lemon juice over it, and serve hot. FRICANDEAU OF VEAL Ingredients Three pounds of fillet of veal. Streaky bacon. Larding bacon. Parsley, thyme, and bay leaf. Half a pint of stock. Salt, pepper, and sugar. One onion. Mace. One carrot. One clove. Trim the veal and lard it closely with fine strips of larding bacon; lay three or four thin slices of bacon in the bottom of a stewpan and place the fricandeau on them; cut the onion and carrot in slices and place them round it, with a bouquet of parsley, thyme, and bay leaf, an atom of mace, and a clove; add about half a pint of stock, but do not let it cover the larding; if you have no stock at hand, use water and a little salt; cover it with a buttered paper, set it on a moderate fire, let it stew gently for about two hours, basting the fricandeau with the gravy occasionally; the more slowly it cooks the better. When done, put it on a baking sheet in the oven for five or ten minutes to crisp the lardons; in the meantime, strain the stock, free it from grease, re- duce it to half glaze; take the fricandeau out of the oven, dish it up, glaze it, and pour the remainder round it. Tomato sauce may be served with the fricandeau, or mushroom sauce made thus : MUSHROOM SAUCE Ingredients Twelve tablespoonfuls of thin brown sauce. Six or eight mushrooms. A little sugar. A little cayenne.

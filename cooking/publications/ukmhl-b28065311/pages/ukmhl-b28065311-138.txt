It should be perfectly clear. RASPBERRY JAM Ingredients Raspberries. Castor sugar. To one pound of raspberries allow one pound and a half of sugar. Mash the fruit thoroughly with a silver fork; put it on the stove or in the oven till thoroughly hot all through, but not boiling. Proceed in exactly the same manner with the sugar in a separate pan, and when both are perfectly hot (without boiling) mix thoroughly, put it into hot jars and tie them down immediately. N.B.â€”Castor sugar must be used. This proportion makes it very sweet, but the jam will keep for two years. For immediate use one pound and a quarter of sugar is better. Strawberry jam made in the same way is delicious, but they should not be mashed. RASPBERRY JAM (another way) One pound of sugar to one pound of fruit. Boil it hard for five minutes, no longer; do not skim it.

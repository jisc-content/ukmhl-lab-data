OCKLYE COOKERY BOOK 114 Boil the three eggs hard, take off the shells, roll them in flour, and cover each egg carefully and evenly with the well-seasoned sausage meat. Egg and breadcrumb them, and fry them in boiling lard; drain them on kitchen paper; cut a little off the ends of each egg, so that they may stand well; cut them in half, set them on fried croutons on a hot dish, and pour the gravy round them ; or they may be served on squares of hot buttered toast without gravy. Any remains of the sausage meat may be made into small balls, fried in the same way, and used as a garnish. POTATO CHIPS Take some large potatoes, wash and peel them, cut them round and round in thin long shavings, as you would a lemon, and put them to soak in cold water for some hours; then dry them well in a cloth, and fry them in lard over a quick fire. As soon as the lard boils, put in the chips, and keep moving them till they are crisp, dry them on kitchen paper, and sprinkle a little salt over them.

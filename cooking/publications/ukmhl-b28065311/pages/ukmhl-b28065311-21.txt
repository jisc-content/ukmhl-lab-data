9 SOUPS Beat up the eggs, add the stock, cream or milk, a very little nutmeg, and a pinch of salt; mix well, strain it into a plain mould well buttered, cover the top with a piece of kitchen paper, stand it in a saucepan containing a little boiling water, draw it to the side of the stove, and steam it gently for twenty minutes; cut it into fanciful shapes a quarter of an inch thick, put these into the tureen, and pour in the boiling clear soup. MOCK TURTLE Ingredients The remains of a calfâ€™s head. One pound and a half of gravy beef. Four quarts of stock. Two carrots. Three onions. One turnip. Half a head of celery.

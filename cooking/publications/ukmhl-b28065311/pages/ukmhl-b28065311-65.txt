53 MEATS AND ENTREES meat; add the pepper, salt, sugar, and parsley, stir it till boiling, and set it to simmer; cut the turnips into thirty dice, fry them until rather brown; take them out and put them into the stewpan with the meat; when it is done, which will be in about an hour and a half from the time it was put on, and when ready to serve, take out the meat and turnips, squeeze the parsley and throw it away, skim off the fat; if too thick add a little more broth or water; if too thin boil it a little more. Place the meat in a circle with the turnips in the centre, pour the sauce over it, and serve very hot (if not hot it is spoilt). Onions, carrots, peas, etc., may be used instead of turnips.

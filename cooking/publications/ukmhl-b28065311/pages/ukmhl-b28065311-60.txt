4S OCKLYE COOKERY BOOK BRAISED PHEASANT Ingredients One pheasant. Half a pint of gravy or stock. Two small onions. One ounce of butter. One small carrot. Truss the pheasant with the wings over the back and the legs drawn in. Melt the butter in a stewpan, slice in the carrot and onions, and let them fry for a few minutes; place the bird on the top of the vegetables and keep turning it until it is nicely browned; add the gravy and let it braise gently for an hour. Dish up the bird, strain the gravy round it, and serve. A PHEASANT PIE One pheasant. Six slices of ham. Some fat bacon. Forcemeat. One onion. Twenty peppercorns. Ingredients A little allspice. Three slices of lemon (without the peel). Gravy or stock. Aspic jelly. Take out the bones of the pheasant, and fill it up with the slices of ham, the same amount of fat bacon, and as much forcemeat as is needed to make it into its proper form; put it into a stewpan with enough cold water to cover it, bring it to the boil, and rinse it with cold water to take off all the scum; then put it into another stew- pan just large enough to hold it, with very thin slices of fat bacon both under it and over it; add the sliced onion, peppercorns, allspice, slices of lemon, and as much gravy or broth as will keep it stewing without covering it, adding more to it as it boils away; stew it for an hour and a half till quite tender. Put it into a raised pie- crust or a mould, and pour savoury jelly or a good gravy over it.

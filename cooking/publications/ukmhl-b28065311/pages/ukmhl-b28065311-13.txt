OCKLYE COOKERY BOOK SOUPS A gill of soup should be allowed for each person. (A gill is a quarter of a pint.) Clear Soup is made with raw meat and vegetables, see Consomme or Clear Soup. Second Stock is made with bones and scraps, in exactly the same way. If required for clear soup, take rather more than half a pound of raw beef to two quarts of stock, pass it through the mincing machine or mince it very finely, mix it with a very little cold water in a basin, and stir it into the stock in a stewpan ; whisk it well over the fire until it boils. Let it stand at the side of the stove for twenty minutes or half an hour, and strain it through a clean, scalded soup-cloth; it should be perfectly clear. A few more vegetables freshly fried in the stewpan before the stock is added improves the flavour. The white of an egg, slightly whipped, and the crushed shell may be added with the raw meat to help to clear it, but a little extra meat is much to be pi efcrred, as the white of egg and the shell always take away some of the flavour and goodness of the soup.

128 BREAD, CAKES, AND PASTRY Only experience can teach judgment as to the temperature of the oven, and ovens vary very much in manner of heating; but so much depends upon the heat of the oven being just right for the particular kind of cake, etc., about to be bakeâ€™d, that it is very important to study the subject. The handle of the oven door is generally a good guide to the heat inside, but with some ovens it is quite misleading, in which case a few breadcrumbs on a tin will show by the time they take to colour if it is brisk or moderate, until the experience has been gained which can tell by putting the hand inside for an instant. CREAM BISCUITS Mix three-quarters of a pound of flour with rather more than half a pint of cream; add a pinch of salt, knead it lightly, roll it out thin, prick it, cut it into pieces any shape, so that there is no waste, and bake them in a quick oven for four or five minutes. WATER BISCUITS Ingredients One gill of water. Four tablespoonfuls of flour. Butter the size of a walnut. A pinch of salt.

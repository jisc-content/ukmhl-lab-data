F 65 PUDDINGS AND COLD SWEETS To steam pudding's, place them in a saucepan of boiling water, sufficient to come half way up the mould or basin, and draw it to the side of the stove; the water must be kept just below boiling point, but it must not be allowed to boil, or the pudding will be spoilt. Peel and core the apples, slice them into a pie-dish, shake some sugar over them, spread a thin layer of orange marmalade over them, and put some little slices of fresh butter on the top. Mix the arrowroot smoothly with the milk, add enough sugar to sweeten it, stir it over the fire till it boils and thickens, pour it over the apples, and bake in a moderate oven for about half an hour. If the apples are hard, stew them first, and let them get quite cold before adding the marmalade and arrowroot. Stewed apple rings may be used. APPLE CAPAN Ingredients Three apples. Orange marmalade.

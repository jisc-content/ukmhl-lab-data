OCKLYE COOKERY BOOK 8 stir in the flour, add the remains of the hare, the stock, mace, peppercorns, and salt to taste. Let it simmer gently for about four hours, then strain it through a hair sieve, rubbing through as much of the pulp as possible; put it into a clean stewpan, bring it to the boil, add a wineglass or more of sherry or port wine, and serve. If it is made of the remains of a roast hare, the blood which was saved should be added at the same time as the stock. Cut two pounds of fresh scrag of mutton into small pieces; put them into a stewpan, with the cold water and salt; set it upon the fire, and when boiling place it at the corner to simmer, keeping it well skimmed; let it simmer for an hour, then add the carrot, turnips, and onions, cut into small dice; cut up the lettuces, add them and the peas, and let all simmer until quite tender, about five hours altogether; skim off the fat, and serve either with the meat in the soup or separately. The peas should be rather old; if young peas are used, they must only be added half an hour before the whole is sufficiently cooked. HOTCH POTCH Ingredients Scrag of mutton.

MEATS AND ENTREES 47 Cut the ham into very small pieces, put it into a stew- pan with the bit of bay leaf, thyme, eschalot chopped, and a little whole pepper; moisten it with a few spoonfuls of stock, set the whole to simmer for ten minutes, and add a small ladle of white sauce; then mix in the yolks of egg- and a pat of butter, and finish with a squeeze of lemon juice over the cheeks. The bones make very good stock. The cheeks should be well soaked in cold water before they are used. OX TAIL Ingredients One ox tail. One onion. One small carrot. One turnip. Three cloves. One small blade of mace. Six peppercorns. Two bay leaves. Two sprigs of thyme. One ounce and a half of butter. One ounce of flour. One teaspoonful of salt. Divide the tail at the joints and fry them brown in a stewpan, with the butter and sliced onion; take out the pieces of tail, stir in the flour, and allow it to brown; put them back, and cover them well with water; cut the carrot and turnip into slices and add them, with the cloves, mace, peppercorns, bay leaves, thyme, and salt; bring it slowly to the boil, and let it simmer gently for three or four hours, till the meat is tender and leaves the bones easily; skim off any fat, arrange the pieces of tail on a hot dish, and strain the sauce over them. The flavour may be varied by omitting the bay leaf and thyme, and adding a tablespoonful of lemon juice at the finish, instead.

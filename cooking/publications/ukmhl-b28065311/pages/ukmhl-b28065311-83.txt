PUDDINGS AND COLD SWEETS 71 CHOCOLATE PUDDING Ingredients One quart of milk. One pint of breadcrumbs. Three ounces of grated chocolate. Four eggs. Castor and icing sugar. The juice of half a lemon. Put the milk and chocolate into a saucepan, and stir it over the fire until the chocolate is all dissolved and mixed with the milk; sweeten and flavour to taste. Put the breadcrumbs into a basin, pour the milk and chocolate over them, and mix well together. When it is a little cool, stir in the yolks of the eggs; pour the mixture into a buttered pie-dish, and bake for half an hour in a moderate oven. Beat the whites of the eggs with a tea- cupful of castor sugar and the lemon juice, till quite thick; spread this over the pudding, dust it with icing sugar, and put it in a cool oven for about half an hour, till it is a delicate brown. Serve cold. COLD MARMALADE CUSTARD Ingredients Three=quarters of an ounce of gelatine (Half an ounce in cold weather). One pint and a half of milk. Three eggs. Seven lumps of sugar rubbed on a lemon. Two tablespoonfuls of marmalade. Make a custard with a pint of the milk and the eggs and sugar. Put the remainder of the milk into a cup, break the gelatine into it, and stand the cup in a basin of hot water till the gelatine is dissolved. Strain the custard and gelatine into a basin, add two tablespoonfuls of orange marmalade, mix well together, and when it is beginning to set, pour it into a mould; when sufficiently firm, turn it out and serve.

Boil it gently for a few minutes, season with pepper, salt, and sugar, stir the yolk of egg in quickly, and pour it into a dish to get cold; then divide it into pieces the size and shape of half a sausage; egg and breadcrumb them twice, and fry them a nice golden brown. Drain them on a sieve, and serve hot, with rich brown clear gravy. They can be made with fresh or cooked meat, but fresh meat is much the best.

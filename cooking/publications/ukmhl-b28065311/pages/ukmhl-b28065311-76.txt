OCKLYE COOKERY BOOK 64 Put the butter into a stewpan, and when melted add the flour; stir it over a slow fire for ten minutes, taking care it does not brown; add the stock, and stir till it is well boiled and very smooth; add the cream, a few drops of lemon juice, a pinch of salt, and it is ready for use. This is the foundation of all good white sauces; if it is not perfectly smooth after the stock has been added, it should be passed through a tammy before adding the cream. VEAL STUFFING Ingredients Four ounces of beef suet. Six ounces of breadcrumbs. Two eggs. One small tablespoonful of chopped parsley. Half a teaspoonful of chopped thyme, and marjoram. A small quantity of grated lemon peel. Salt and pepper. Chop the suet very fine, put it into a basin, add all the other ingredients, mix well together and use.

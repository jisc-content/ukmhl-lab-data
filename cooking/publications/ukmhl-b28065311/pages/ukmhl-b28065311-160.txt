When baking a cake this size, it is a good plan to stand it in the oven on a deep baking sheet, thickly covered with dry sand, to prevent its burning. Salad oil is a good thing to grease the tin and paper with. It takes nearly three quarters of an hour to mix this cake properly. This quantity is sufficient for a three-tier cake.

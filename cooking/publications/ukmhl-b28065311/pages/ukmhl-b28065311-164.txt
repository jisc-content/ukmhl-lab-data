GOOSEBERRY WINE (sparkling) Ingredients Green gooseberries. Gin or pale brandy. Water. Isinglass. Loaf sugar. Put the gooseberries into a tub, with one gallon of water to every four pounds of gooseberries. Mash them well, and let them stand for three days, stirring them two or three times each day. Strain them off, and to each gallon of liquor put three pounds of loaf sugar; when it is dissolved, put it into a barrel, with a bottle of gin or half a pint of brandy to every five gallons. Do not stop the cask until it has done fermenting; then put in some isinglass, a quarter of an ounce to the above amount, and let it stand for six months before you bottle it, putting two lumps of loaf sugar into each bottle.

Slice the lemons into four large jugs, four lemons in each; pour four and a half pints of boiling water into each

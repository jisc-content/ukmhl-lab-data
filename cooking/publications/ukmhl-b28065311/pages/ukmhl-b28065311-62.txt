50 OCKLYE COOKERY BOOK parsley, a small quantity of chopped eschalot, two good tablespoonfuls of chicken, and a little ham, all finely minced; pepper and salt to taste, and the raw yolk of one egg to bind the mixture; stir all well together, turn out and let it remain till cold; then make it into small balls, roll them in flour, egg and breadcrumb, and fry them in clean boiling lard till a nice golden colour. Dish them on a napkin or dish paper, and serve with fried parsley in the centre. The chicken and ham may be omitted. QUENELLES Ingredients Three=quarters of a pound of fillet of veal. Two ounces of suet. Three ounces of panada. Salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Two eggs. One tablespoonful of cream or white sauce. Second stock. Cut up the veal into small pieces, removing the fat and sinewy bits; pound it well in a mortar, and rub it through a wire sieve; chop the suet finely and pound it; add three ounces of panada to the suet, and pound them well together; add the veal, and cream, or white sauce, and season with salt, pepper and grated nutmeg, and pound again; add the eggs one at a time, pounding thoroughly. Then take two dessertspoons, fill one with the mixture, dip the other into hot water, and with it remove the mixture from the first spoon, placing them in a well-buttered sautd-pan; then cover them with second stock, and poach them for ten minutes; arrange them in a circle on a hot dish, pour some good white sauce over them, and serve with mashed potatoes, spinach, or peas in the centre. Before making them up, it is a good plan to poach a little piece in boiling water, to make sure that it is firm and well flavoured.

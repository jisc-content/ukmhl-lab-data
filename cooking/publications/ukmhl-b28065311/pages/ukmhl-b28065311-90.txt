78 OCKLYE COOKERY BOOK them off, wash them well, and put them on again in a clean saucepan, with water to cover themâ€”about six pints; let them boil well for eight hours, till the water is reduced to about half; strain off, and put away till next day; then take off all the fat with kitchen paper. To a quart of the jelly add the juice of the four lemons, the grated rind of two, the cinnamon, sugar, the egg shells, crushed, and the whites slightly whipped; whisk it well over the fire until it comes to the boil; stand it at the side with the lid on for about a quarter of an hour, and then pass it through a hot scalded jelly bag; if not perfectly clear, pass it through again; add the sherry, pour into moulds and set. A cowheel makes equally good jelly; any that is not used may be made into aspic, or savoury jelly. LEMON JELLY Ingredients Eight lemons. Three-quarters of a pound of loaf sugar. One ounce and three-quarters of leaf gelatine. One inch of cinnamon. One quart of water. The whites and shells of two eggs. One wineglass of sherry. Put the juice of the lemons, the grated rind of four, the sugar, cinnamon, gelatine, and water into a basin, and let it stand all night. Put it into a stewpan and bring it to the boil; take it off and let it cool; then stir in the whites and crushed shells of the eggs, and whisk it over the fire till it boils; strain it through a hot scalded jelly bag, and if it is not perfectly clear pass it through a second time. It can be made in a day, but the colour of the jelly will be improved by its standing the night before.

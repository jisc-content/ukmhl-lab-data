Cut them into very thin round slices, keep them in salt and water till ready to cook, then dry them carefully in a cloth, fry them in boiling lard until they are light brown and crisp, drain them on kitchen paper, sprinkle a little salt over them and serve. GLOBE ARTICHOKES Cut the stems off quite close and wash the artichokes well in salt and water; throw them into plenty of boiling water, with a little salt and a tiny pinch of soda to keep their colour; let them boil till the leaves pull out quite easily, and send them to table on a napkin, with melted butter in small china ramequin cases, one for each person ; the butter may be either simply clarified, or ordinary melted butter sauce, according to taste. One artichoke should be allowed to each person, as they are difficult to divide. If artichokes are quite young an hour or less will be long enough to boil them ; if full grown or old they will take an hour and a half to two hours. As they are not very commonly met with nowadays, it may be as well to add that when served the leaves are pulled off, dipped in the melted butter seasoned with pepper and salt, and the soft ends sucked; when the centre is reached the choke is taken out, and the bottom, which is the chief delicacy, is eaten with the rest of the butter. A glass of cold water, directly after the artichoke is eaten, has a delicious flavour.

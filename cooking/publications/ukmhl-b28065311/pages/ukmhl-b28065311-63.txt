RABBIT PIE Ingredients Two rabbits. Onion. Two ounces of macaroni. Half a pint of cream. Two ounces of Parmesan or other Salt. cheese. Puff pastry. Boil the rabbits, cut off all the meat as thin as possible; boil the macaroni till it is very tender; grate the cheese. Line a pie-dish with pastry and fill it with alternate layers of rabbit, macaroni, and cheese; flavour with a little chopped onion and salt, and add the cream; cover it with pastry and bake it for one hour in a moderate oven. STEWED RABBIT Ingredients One rabbit. One onion. Half an ounce of butter. Stock. Cut up the rabbit, place the pieces in cold water to draw out the blood; brown the butter and onions in a stewpan, add the rabbit, let it brown rather slowly on one side, then turn the pieces, and let them brown on the other; this will take about half an hour; have ready some nicely browned thickened stock, add this to the rabbit, cover the pan, and stew it gently for an hour and a half.

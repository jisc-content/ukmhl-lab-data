BREAD, CAKES, AND PASTRY 139 three equal portions; then roll the paste out thin; lay one portion of lard and butter upon it in little bits, sprinkle a little flour over it, fold it in three; turn it with the rough edges towards you and roll it out; repeat this twice till the fat is used up, when it is ready for use. Put the flour into a basin, make a well in the centre, put in the lemon juice, a pinch of salt, and enough cold water to make it into a stiff pasteâ€”it should be as nearly as possible the same consistency as the fat; squeeze the butter in a cloth to absorb the moisture; roll the paste out to a quarter of an inch in thickness, put the butter and lard on half the paste, fold the other half over it, cover it entirely and press the edges together. Put it away in a cool place for half an hour; then roll it out four times, each time folding it in three, and turning the rough edges towards you. Put it aside again for an hour in the cool and repeat the four rollings as before. It should then be put away for another hour before it is used; or it can be made the day before if kept in a damp cloth. One pound of flour. Half a pound of butter. Half a pound of lard.

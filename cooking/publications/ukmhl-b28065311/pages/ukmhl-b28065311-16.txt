OCKLYE COOKERY BOOK 4 boil; as soon as the scum begins to rise, skim it well, and continue until the liquid is quite free from it; add salt to taste. Having well washed all the vegetables and cut them into slices, add them with a bunch of herbs—such as three sprigs of tarragon, two of thyme and parsley, two bay leaves—and the mace and peppercorns. Let this simmer gently for eight or nine hours, then strain it through a clean scalded soup-cloth; it should be perfectly clear. Carefully remove all fat with kitchen paper, when hot, before using. It is undesirable to clear soup with egg shells, as they take away the flavour and goodness also. Truss the fowl as for boiling, and put it in a stewpan, with six pints of water ; bring it to the boil, and skim well. Add three leeks and some salt, and boil slowly for about three hours; then take it out, cut off the breast, put the fowl back into the stewpan, and let it simmer well for three or four hours longer; strain off the soup, and let it stand for twenty-four hours ; then take off the fat, put it into a clean stewpan, with a handful of rice, put the lid on, and stand it on the stove to simmer gently until the rice is cooked ; have ready a dozen stewed prunes, cut four or five leeks into julienne shreds, and boil for ten minutes, add them to the soup, with the prunes and the breast of fowl, cut into small pieces; bring it to the boil, and add a gill of cream or milk.

72 OCKLYE COOKERY BOOK COLD PUDDING Ingredients Six ounces of pound or sponge cake. One pint of cream or milk. One ounce and a half of castor sugar. Three-quarters of an ounce of gelatine. Three eggs. Custard. Make the cake into crumbs and put them into a basin; boil the cream or milk and pour it over them; let it stand till nearly cold, then add the yolks of the eggs; put the mixture into a stewpan, place it over the fire, and keep stirring it till nearly boiling, but do not let it boil; add the sugar, and let it stand till quite cold. Dissolve the gelatine in a little milk, whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, work the gelatine very quickly into the pudding, then stir in the whites very lightly; pour it into a mould, and let it stand for four hours; turn it out as you would a jelly, and serve with custard round it. CREME,; BRULEE* Ingredients One pint of cream. Pounded sugar. The yolks of four eggs. Beat the yolks in a basin, and having boiled the cream for a very short time, pour it on them; put it all into the saucepan, and let it come to the boil as before, stirring it all the time; pour it into the dish in which it is to be sent to table, and allow it to become quite cold; then strew a thick crust of pounded sugar over it, and brown it with a red-hot salamander. The sugar should make a hard surface like light brown ice all over the top, about an eighth of an inch thick. Serve cold. * It is amusing to remember that this recipe, which came from a country house in Aberdeenshire in the 'sixties, was offered to

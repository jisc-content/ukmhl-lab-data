DRUMLANR1G PUDDING Ingredients. Bread. Cream. Stewed fruit. Line a basin with bread, cut into rather thin fingers; fill it with any stewed fruit, and cover it with a round slice of bread the size of the basin. Let it stand for some hours, till the bread is well soaked with the juice; turn it out, and spread whipped cream all over it—or the bread may be cut in pieces like sponge cakes, and the fruit piled over it in a glass dish, but care must be taken that the bread is thoroughly soaked.

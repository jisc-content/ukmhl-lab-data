SOUPS 7 Stew the vegetables in the butter and a teacupful of stock for one hour; then add the rest of the stock and simmer for another hour. Boil the cream, then mix the yolks of the eggs, well beaten, with it and strain it. Take the soup off the fire, put the eggs and cream into it, then bring it just to the boil, stirring well all the time. Add sugar and salt to taste, and it is ready to serve. PUREE OF GREEN PEAS Ingredients One quart of peas. One gill of cream. One quart of water. Salt. A small bunch of mint. One teaspoonful of sugar. One pint and a half of milk. Put the water on to boil. When boiling add the salt, mint, and peas; boil until the peas are quite tender, strain the water away from them, keeping back about a gill; pass this with the peas through a fine hair sieve; put the puree into a clean stewpan, add the milk, sugar, and a little more salt if required; bring it to the boil, add the cream, and serve with fried croutons. A handful of the peas-cods boiled with the peas, and rubbed through the sieve, improves the flavour. HARE SOUP Ingredients The remains of a roast or jugged hare. Two ounces of butter. Two ounces of flour. Two large onions. A bunch of herbs. A blade of mace. Six peppercorns. Salt. Two quarts of second stock. A wineglass of sherry or port wine. Slice the onions into a stewpan, with the butter and herbs, and fry them for about a quarter of an hour;

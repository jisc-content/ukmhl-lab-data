OCKLYE COOKERY BOOK 42 HOT POT Ingredients Mutton chops. Stock. Onion. Kidneys. Twenty oysters. Pepper, salt, and sugar. Potatoes. Lay some nicely-cut chops at the bottom of a pie-dish, a little good stock flavoured slightly with onion, then a layer of kidneys, and next about twenty oysters, a little pepper, salt, and one small teaspoonful of sugar; cover it all over with potatoes cut out like rock, and set it in the oven to stew for two hours. Cut your meat into pieces the size and thickness of a crown; cover both sides of each piece with curry powder; then put them on a skewer, with a very thin slice of bacon and of onion between each slice of meat; lay them on a baking tin with a piece of dripping on the top, and put them in the oven, basting them well till they are done. They should be almost crisp; then take them off the skewers, place them in little piles on a hot dish, and serve with good brown gravy. They may be made of cooked or raw meat.

SOUPS 5 CRECY OR CARROT SOUP Ingredients Three large red carrots. Bay leaves. One onion. Two ounces of butter. One turnip. Half a pint of water. Two ounces of lean ham or One ounce of flour, bacon. Two pints of stock. Parsley. Salt and sugar. Peel and slice the onion and turnip, cut up the ham, and put them, with a few sprigs of parsley and two bay leaves, into a stewpan with the butter, and fry a light yellowish colour. Then wash and scrape the carrots, shave them into very thin slices, not using the centres, and add them, with half a pint of water; let them stew until quite tender; then mix in the flour smoothly, add the stock, season with half a teaspoonful of salt, and one teaspoonful of sugar, and stir it over the fire for about a quarter of an hour until it boils; then pass it through a tammy or hair sieve, put it back into the sauce- pan, and again stir it over the fire until it boils; no cream must be added, as this soup ought to be of a red colour and not too thick. Serve with plainly boiled rice, or fried croutons handed separately. CROUTE AU POT One carrot. One turnip. One leek. One parsnip. Ingredients Celery. One onion. One quart of stock. Bread.

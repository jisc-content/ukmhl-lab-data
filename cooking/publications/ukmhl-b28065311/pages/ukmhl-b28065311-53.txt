MEATS AND ENTREES 41 TO ROAST A HARE Ingredients One hare. Gravy. Veal stuffing. Red currant jelly. Having stuffed and trussed the hare, tie a piece of fat bacon over the back; then cover the whole hare with well greased paper, and roast it in front of a brisk fire for one hour, taking the paper off for the last quarter of an hour; baste it constantly with plenty of dripping all the time it is roasting. Take off the bacon, dish it up with a good gravy, and hand red currant jelly with it. The blood should be saved to use in the hash next day. JUGGED OR HASHED HARE Ingredients One hare. The blood of the hare. One onion. One carrot. One turnip. A bunch of herbs. One wineglass of claret. Two ounces of butter. Three ounces of flour. One quart of second stock. One tablespoonful of red currant jelly. Forcemeat balls. Cut a fresh hare, or the remains of a roast hare, into neat pieces; slice the vegetables into a stewpan with the herbs, add the butter, and fry them for about a quarter of an hour; then stir in the flour and add the stock, a quart or a little more, and the blood; put in the head and trimmings, and let it all simmer gently for about two hours; then rub it through a hair sieve. Put the pieces of hare into a stewpan, add the sauce, red currant jelly, and forcemeat balls; let it simmer for about two hours and a half, or, if the hare is already cooked, one hour will be sufficient. Add the claret just before serving. Hare done in this way is quite as good as if cooked in the old fashion of jugging it in a jar in the oven.

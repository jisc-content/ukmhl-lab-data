PREFACE These recipes have been collected from many sources in the course of many years. The publication of them has often been suggested by friends who wished for copies of one or another, but nearly all required some alteration to ensure a satisfactory production. It is owing to the painstaking assistance of my cook, Annie Hobden, that their publication has been made possible. Their present form is the result of the most careful practical revision; superfluities have been elimi- nated, directions simplified, and it is believed that many of the dishes will prove more economical and more whole- some, yet not less palatable, than those made from other recipes for the same things, while many, it is hoped, will have the charm of novelty as well. Some of the richer ones are obviously only intended for festive occasions, but they are all given exactly as they are used in our small household, where they have been found so invaluable that I cannot help hoping they may be equally useful to others. The proof of the pudding is in the eating ! ‚Äù Ocklye, August, 1909. Eleanor L. Jenkinson.

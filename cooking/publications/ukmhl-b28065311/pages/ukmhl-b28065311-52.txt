OCKLYE COOKERY BOOK 40 Put the brown sauce into a small stewpan to boil; then have the mushrooms well cleaned and washed, chop them fine, place them in the sauce and boil for five or ten minutes; add a little sugar and a little cayenne if liked. TO ROAST AN OLD FOWL Ingredients One old fowl. Good gravy. Veal stuffing. Prepare the fowl as for roasting, stuffing it with veal stuffing as you would a turkey; put it in a steamer and steam it for two hours and a half; then take it out, dredge it over lightly with flour, and roast it before a brisk fire for half an hour, basting it constantly. Dish it up, and serve with good gravy poured round it. HAM ROLL Ingredients Two pounds of ham. Three eggs. One pound of raw veal. Pepper and salt. Half a pound of breadcrumbs. Glaze. Mince the veal and ham finely; mix in the breadcrumbs and the eggs well beaten, season it with pepper and salt, stir it all well together, roll it like a bolster, tie it up in a pudding cloth, and boil it for an hour and a half; let it get a little cool, then take it out and glaze it. Beef may be used instead of veal, but the latter is to be preferred.

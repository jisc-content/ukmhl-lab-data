55 MEATS AND ENTREES SAVOURY HASH Ingredients Cold mutton. Flour. Gravy. Apple sauce. Duck stuffing. Take some slices of cold mutton, dip each piece into flour, put them into a fire-proof dish, with a little stuffing between each layer of meat; add enough gravy to keep it moist; put on the lid, and cook it gently in a moderate oven. If necessary, colour it with a little browning when finished, and serve very hot in the same covered dish. Apple sauce to be sent in separately. Pepper, salt, and cayenne. Boil the calf’s head till tender in as much water as will cover it; take it up, draw out the bones, and boil them again in the liquor till it is very much reduced ; strain it off, and let it stand till cold, when it will be a jelly. When all is cold, cut the meat into slices, slice the eggs, put some in the bottom of a pie-dish, then slices of meat, tongue, and brains, which must be previously boiled; season with pepper, salt, cayenne, and chopped parsley. A few thin slices of bacon may be added if liked. Repeat the layers till the dish is full. Melt and pour in some of the stock it was boiled in, cover with flaky or puff paste, and bake. When taken out of the oven, it should be filled up with more of the stock, melted. Put away till next day, then turn it out on a dish ; run a knife round under the crust if necessary. Half a calf’s head makes a good-sized pie. SCOTCH PIE Ingredients Half a calf’s head. Three eggs. Chopped parsley. Flaky or puff paste.

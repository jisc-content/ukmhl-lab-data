OCKLYE COOKERY BOOK 28 Put a teaspoonful of finely chopped eschalot into a saut^-pan with the sherry and butter, place the sole in it, pour the gravy over it, and sprinkle it with finely chopped parsley; cover it with a buttered paper, and place it in a moderate oven for half an hour; take the sole out of the pan, place it upon a dish without a napkin, reduce the sauce that is in the pan over a sharp fire, add a little Harvey sauce and anchovy, pour it over the sole and serve very hot. White sauce can be used instead of gravy. Boil and mash some potatoes and mix with them a small piece of butter, a little cream, pepper, salt, and the yolk of egg. Take the remains of a turbot which has been cooked, make a good creamy sauce, and put the pieces of fish into it; if you have any lobster sauce, use that. Make a border of the mashed potato in pyramids, with a bag and half inch pipe, on the dish you are serving up in; put the fish in the middle, sprinkle a little grated cheese and a little chopped parsley over it, and lobster coral if you have any. Put it in the oven for about twenty minutes to brown. If necessary, finish with a salamander. TURBOT AU GRATIN Ingredients Potatoes. Butter. Cream. Pepper and salt. The yolk of an egg.

74 MEAT AND POULTRY. Meat, poultry, and game are very nutritious, but vary considerably as to tbeir degree of digestibility. Turkey and chicken are the most easily digested of all meats. Pheasant and partridge are also tempting and digestible; while rabbit, on account of the close texture of the flesh, is decidedly indigestible. Mutton is lighter and more easily digested than beef. Beef in every form, particularly beef steak, is very difficult of digestion. Pork and veal are also very indigestible, and require very thorough cooking to render them wholesome. Salt meat is rather deficient in nourishment, and is also not easy of digestion. Ducks and geese are unsuitable for invalids, as they are both rich and indigestible. Pigeon is close in texture and often tough. It is more suitable when stewed. Sweetbreads are both nutritious, easy of digestion, and tempting. Lambs’ throat sweetbreads are quite inexpen- sive, while calves’ heart sweetbreads are costly, varying according to the time of the year. Bullocks’ sweetbreads also are often to be had at a small cost, and although not quite so choice as calves’ sweetbreads they are both well- flavoured, nutritious, and digestible.

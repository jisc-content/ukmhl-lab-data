33 SICKROOM COOKERY. The reason of this is very obvious. I shall endeavour to explain it as simply as possible. Albumen, which is the flesh-forming, life-giving element in the meat, is very like white of egg in its properties. If white of egg is stirred into cold water it will mix freely with the water. Heat it gently and it will still remain in solution, but bring it to a certain degree of heat, say, 150° Fah., the albumen coagulates into hard particles like hard-boiled white of egg. Thus, if beef tea is heated beyond this point, the albumen is hardened into the meat or sets in coarse sediment and is strained out of the beef tea, the almost valueless liquid being given to the patient. As albumen coagulates from 120° to 150° Fall., it is obvious beef tea should never approach boiling point, 212°. It is not for an instant contended that this is the most delicious, savoury or well-flavoured beef tea, for it is not— but it is by far the most nutritious, which is everything when the case of the patient is serious. It contains all the nutriment possible to get in beef tea. Beef tea should be seasoned only with salt. Pepper or vegetable flavouring should not be put in for anyone seriously ill. Some doctors have almost ceased to attach great im- portance to beef tea, largely owing to the difficulty of getting it properly made. It is really easy to make if these few simple rules and scientific principles are adhered to. BEEF TEA IN HOSPITALS. Beef tea in hospitals is often badly made, owing to tho difficulty of making it in large quantities. P

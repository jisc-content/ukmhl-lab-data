SICKROOM COOKERY. 172 TO MAKE ARROWROOT WATER. Take two tablespoonsful of arrowroot to one pint of cold water. Allow it to simmer for from fire to ten minutes, stirring all tlie time.

The proportion of water is gradually lessened until, at three months, the food consists of equal parts of milk and water, barley water or lime water By a gradual process of exclusion the water is omitted, and at six months the child is having boiled undiluted milk with perhaps a teaspoonful of lime water to each bottle.

209 SICKROOM COOKERY. VEAL OR PORK BRAWN. (diabetic.) A lb. of veal cutlet or pork. \ lb. of bacon. 2 harcl-boiled eggs. 1 teaspoonful of chopped parsley. i teaspoonful of grated lemon rind. 1 gill of white stock. 2 sheets of gelatine. Seasoning. Remove the skin and cut the veal and bacon into dice. Choose a small dry mould or cake tin, and decorate the bottom and sides with a few slices of hard-boiled egg. Chop up the rest of the egg and mix it with the veal, bacon, parsley and lemon rind. Season well and fill the mould. Dissolve the gelatine in the stock, season, and strain in. Keep the remainder of the stock. Cover the brawn with a greased paper and bake in a slow oven for three hours. Then strain in the rest of the stock, and let it go cold and firm. To turn out, dip for one moment into warm water and turn on to a dish. Garnish with parsley. TO PREPARE MEAT GLAZE. Take two cpiarts or more of strong second stock (p. 42) made from bones; strain, and let it become cold. Remove all fat from the top. Put this stock into a saucepan with half a pint of cold water. Boil as rapidly as possible, skimming frequently to remove all scum. As the stock reduces it will become a clear brown glaze. When thick and clear strain into a jar. Useful for adding to diabetic soups, stews, or sauces. It sets when cold, and if covered with clarified butter will keep for some time. Meat glaze can be bought ready prepared. p

SICKROOM COOKERY. 2 Foods may be most conveniently considered as follows : I. —Albuminates (albumen containing) or Proteids, wbicb supply the stable nitrogen for tbe building up of the various structures of the body, i.e., “ flesh-forming ” food. II. —Carbohydrates (starches and sugars) which, with the Fats, supply the unstable carbon, the subsequent changes in which lead to the maintenance of the tempera- ture of the body (animal heat) and to the development of energy, which shows itself in the movements of the various organs of the body. III. —Fats and Oils—either a3 animal fat (fat of meat), or the various products of milk, cream, butter and cheese, or olive oil and other oils used in the various processes of cooking. The Fats, besides assisting the carbohydrates, serve an important purpose as “ albumen saving ” foods, a much smaller quantity of proteids being required if fats are judiciously mixed in the dietary. IY —Mineral Salts, mainly of soda, potash, calcium and magnesium, are also essentials—and are obtained chiefly from fresh vegetables—in milk, and in various fluids taken as food, as well as in smaller quantities in meat and the carbohydrates. Y.—Water is taken as such, or in other fluids, and also in varying proportion in all the food stuffs. The necessary oxygen is absorbed by the body in the process of respiration. The albuminates are characterised by the presence of the element nitrogen, which is an essential of all the

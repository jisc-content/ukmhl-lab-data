SICKROOM COOKERY. 14 CHAPTER III. DIET SCALES. It is difficult to lay down an exact diet scale in health, the -amount required being influenced so much by the work, age, and special surroundings. In disease the most easily digested foods must be selected, having regard to their respective nutritive values. In cases of serious illness the nourishment has to be conveyed in a liquid form, as in milk, beef tea, or raw egg. Beverages such as lemonade and barley water may be given to alleviate the thirst. Certain conditions requiring special diet scales may he here indicated. EEVER. In fever the waste of albuminous tissue is great, and therefore albuminous food in a liquid form must he generously supplied. Digestion in the stomach is at first impaired, and later may be suspended, therefore solid food must not be given. Beef tea in these circumstances is very useful, but in some cases it causes irritation, and has to be dis- continued. Milk is the food of the greatest value, but in all fevers great care must be taken to render it digestible. This can be done by the addition of barley water, which prevents it from forming irritating curds in the stomach, by the addition of soda water, by boiling, or by peptonisation. Junket is both tempting and nutritious, and in cases where it can be taken is a most useful food.

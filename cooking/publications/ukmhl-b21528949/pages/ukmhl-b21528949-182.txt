174 SICKROOM COOKERY. The staple diet must still consist of milk, from one and a half to two pints being given in the twenty-four hours. Milk, however, of itself, is now hardly sufficient, and starchy foods in some form are required. Barley jelly may be used. It is made by putting two tablespoonsful of washed pearl barley into a pint and a half of water and slowly boiling the mixture down to a pint, straining and allowing the liquid to cool and form a jelly. Two teaspoonsful of this jelly are dissolved in eight ounces of warmed and sweetened milk, and given twice a day, in place of the ordinary milk feed. At other times, the milk may be thickened by the addition of bread jelly or grated bread crumbs, and by the time the teeth are fairly well developed, bread and milk may also be given. Other starchy foods, such as oatmeal, wholemeal flour, arrowroot, maize, etc., may be safely given, provided they are thoroughly cooked. Cooking bursts the starch capsules, and the granules within are gelatinised. Two tablespoonsful of any of these foods may be added to a pint of milk, TO MAKE OATMEAL JELLY. Place a tablespoonful of coarse ground oatmeal in one pint of cold water. Let the mixture simmer for an hour or more, strain and allow the fluid to set into a jelly. Use in the same way as barley jelly. TO MAKE ARROWROOT JELLY. Add two tablespoonsful of arrowroot to one pint of water. Allow it to simmer for from five to ten minutes, stirring all the time, and then set aside to form a jelly. Malt extract, best added to the milk after it has been boiled, may also be given, and is well digested, as some of the starch has already undergone partial digestive change in the process of manufacture. Not more than five meals a day should be allowed ; in fact, four is often sufficient, consisting of from six to eight ounces of food at each meal. Convenient hours are 6 a.m., 10 a.m., 2 p.m., 6 p.m., and 10 p.m.

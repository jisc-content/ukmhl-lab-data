SICKROOM COOKERY AND HOSPITAL DIET. CHAPTER I. (I) CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS. (II) FOOD VALUES. It would not be appropriate, or of value here, to enter into the origin or nature of foods, except as they directly bear on tbe sustenance and repair of tlie human body. From this point of view the various foods will be shortly enumerated and classified, to indicate the manner in which their work is done. It will also be necessary to consider briefly the essentials of an average man’s diet in health, and the chemical constituents of the various “ food stuffs,” in order to indicate the parts these substances play in the body, after being subjected to the action of the different digestive juices. In the body certain elements are found—carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, as well as phosphorus and sulphur in small amount. These elements, in the constant process of change occurring in the body, become trans- formed into heat and energy. This waste must be replaced by foods in which the same elements exist in varying proportions. B

26 SICKROOM COOKERY. In MIDDLE AGE, or after tlie age of forty, the food should be reduced, as the body no longer needs such a large supply, nor, in many cases, is it able to digest it. Hence by ignorance a tendency to corpulence is estab- lished. Brain workers, and those leading sedentary lives, should have light digestible meals, consisting of foods such as the following: Chicken, fish, eggs, milk, fresh vegetables, fruit, light stale bread, butter, cream, and a little bacon. An excess of butcherâ€™s meat or albuminous food is unnecessary and should be avoided, as the want of exercise makes digestion a difficulty, or impossibility, and gives rise to dyspepsia, or worse. In OLD AGE, a light, nourishing, and digestible diet must be the rule. Light dishes of fish, eggs, small quantities of meat, milk, butter, cream, stale bread, and stewed fruits are suitable; weak tea, coffee, and cocoa. Climate, too, much influences diet. In cold countries large quantities of fat and oil are consumed to keep up the heat of the body. In more southern climates, fruits, vegetables, rice, and a cooling light diet seem to be demanded and supplied by nature. In the foregoing remarks it has been attempted only to indicate the diet in various diseases, but in every case this must be combined with appropriate medical treatment. Most of the recipes in this book have been specially inserted as being useful in various illnesses, and as great a variety as possible has been included, as, if one dish is distasteful to the invalid, it is often desirable to substitute another, supplying the same conditions under a different form.

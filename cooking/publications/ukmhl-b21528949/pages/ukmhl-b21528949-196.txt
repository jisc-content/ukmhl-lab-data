Band of muslin or cambric. Generally iced water is used. Occasionally a little vinegar or eau de Cologne is added. Fold the cambric in a band and dip in the lotion. Lay on the part affected. Use a piece of oilskin or mackintosh to prevent the pillow becoming wet. Renew as the band becomes warm. Use- ful to allay inflammation. Occasionally used in cases of severe headache.

4 SICKROOM COOKERY. Proteid alone can support life, but, by the addition of carbohydrates and fat, a far smaller quantity is required, thus forming a diet more wholesome and more economical. As to the digestion of the food stuffs it may be said, briefly, albuminous food becomes albumoses and peptones, and is absorbed as such; starches are converted into sugars of different forms, and fats are variously split up before becoming absorbed. II.—FOOD VALUES. Meats.—All meats are highly nitrogenous, and supply flesh-forming material. They contain the same elements as the human body, and are, therefore, valuable as a food. The various joints of the same animal vary as to nutritive value, some being richer in albumen, others containing more gelatine, or fat. Beef and Mutton are both very nutritious, hut mutton is easier of digestion. Yeal being the flesh of an imma- ture animal is deficient in nutriment, and also less easy of digestion. Pork is also close in texture, indigestible, and quite unsuitable for an invalid. Salt Meats generally lose some of their nutriment, and are also less easy of digestion. Poultry and game belong to the nitrogenous foods, and are very digestible on account of their short fibre and absence of fat. Fish also belongs to the nitrogenous foods, and is very nutritious, although in a less degree than meat or poultry. At the same time, it is lighter and easier of digestiou, and in this way is a valuable food for the convalescent, or for

13 SICKROOM COOKERY. there is more loss of nutritive constituents than in roast- ing, unless both the meat and the broth, in which it is cooked be consumed, as certain constituents from the meat and soluble gelatine pass into the broth. Stewing is the most economical method of cooking meat. Much nutriment passes into the gravy, but as both the meat, gravy, and vegetables are consumed there is no loss. By long, slow stewing the fibres are softened, and even tough meat or poultry can be rendered tender. The loss is also less than in roasting or boiling. By careful removal of all grease, a well-flavoured, digestible dish is secured. It is neglect of this important point which renders stews objectionable. Braising.—This is an excellent modeof cooking, and there is little loss of nutritive constituents. A small bank or foundation of vegetables is placed in a saucepan, with just enough stock to cover. The meat or poultry to be braised is placed on top, the saucepan covered closely, and the food gently steamed in this manner. The meat thus becomes thoroughly flavoured with the vegetables, and by slow cooking is rendered tender and digestible. Broiling and Grilling.—This method is most suitable for small portions of meat, and has much the same effect and value as roasting. It is the most perfect way for chops and steaks, as the outside is quickly sealed up, and the meat remains full of juice and is free from excess of dripping. Frying, as generally understood, on a flat pan, is much to be condemned. It spoils the flavour of the meat, renders it hard, and often indigestible, from the excess of dripping in which it is cooked. Deep frying, as applied to fish, croquettes, etc., cooked in a protective coating and well drained, is most excellent, and supplies all needs demanded by the process.

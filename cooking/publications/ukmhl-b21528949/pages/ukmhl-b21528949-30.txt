22 SICKROOM COOKERY. puddings, suet and apple puddings, milk puddings made with a pat of butter, buttered eggs, bacon, yolks of egg, wholemeal bread, jam, treacle, and all forms of light digestible food. Care must be taken to render all as nutritious and digestible as possible. Cod-liver oil is most useful in warding off the disease. Thus, in the young, by diet and care the disease may be overcome, or at least kept in abeyance. RICKETS. Rickets is caused by incorrect feeding. Insufficiency of fat in the food of young children appears to produce the disease. Occasionally hand-fed children have a difficulty in digesting milk, and are fed on so-called “ infants’ food,” and other starchy foods, such as arrowroot or cornflour mixed with water, or rusks soaked in water, the result being such children very often become rickety. Milk is the natural food for children, and cow’s milk must be properly diluted with water, in different propor- tions at different ages, to make it digestible. By boiling the milk the possibility of infection by germs is pre- vented, and it is also rendered easier of digestion. Occasionally peptonised food will be found necessary when the child is unable to digest milk in its natural form. This conveys the nonrishment needed already partially digested, and tides over the time nntil the digestive powers are re-established. Peptonised food should not be continued longer than necessary. In this way rickets may be avoided, but in older children, when rickets has developed, milk puddings, cream, potatoes and gravy, finely-chopped under-done meat, eggs, and a little bacon, will be found of benefit; while cod-liver oil must be largely given, being strictly a food, not a medicine.

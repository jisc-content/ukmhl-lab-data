94 SICKROOM COOKERY. Trim away all fat and gristle. Pass tlie meat twice through, a mincing machine. Melt the butter, stir in the flour, add the stock, and cook until the mixture draws away from the sides of the pan into a ball. Let this panada cool. Pound the panada, Teal and egg in the mortar, season well, rub through a wire sieve. Porm into quennelles in a dessertspoon, shaping them with a knife dipped in water. Place the quennelles in a flat saucepan with an inch of boiling water, cover with a buttered paper and simmer very gently until firm. Drain and dish on a strip of mashed potato. If sauce is allowed pour white sauce over (see “ Sauces ”). RABBIT. Rabbit is not very digestible, being close and firm in fibre, and for that reason is not suitable for an invalid. If specially desired it can be stewed or boiled by the recipes for boiling and stewing chicken. RAW BEEF BALLS. J lb. of raw juicy steak. 1 teaspoonful of cream, or 1 teaspoonful of brandy. Scrape the meat into shreds with a knife. If possible, rub through a wire sieve. Mix this raw shredded beef with a teaspoonful of cream, and roll into balls the size of a small marble. If preferred add the brandy to the meat to mask the flavour. Rub the bottom of a frying pan with a scrap of butter, then carefully wipe out the pan with paper. Place the balls on the pan and move them about for a quarter of a minute with a spoon just to slightly change the colour. Serve imme- diately. They must be quite unchanged and absolutely raw. They may be taken with a little wine and water or soup.

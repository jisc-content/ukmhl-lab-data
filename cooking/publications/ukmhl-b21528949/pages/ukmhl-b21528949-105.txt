SICKROOM COOKERY. 97 rooms in stock for ten minntes and cut them up also. Melt the butter, rub in the flour with a spoon until smooth. Add the milk and bring to the boil. Add the yolk of egg and lemon juice, and season with pepper and salt. Then put in the sweetbread and mushrooms. Simmer gently for three or four minutes to make thoroughly hot. Serve in either china or paper ramakin cases. For a change, six sauce oysters may be blanched, cut in four, and used with the sweetbread instead of mush- rooms. BRAISED SWEETBREAD. 1 heart sweetbread. Second stock. 1 tablespoonful of meat glaze. 1 block of fried bread. Vegetable puree. Blanch the sweetbread as for boiled sweetbread. Put the sweetbread into a saucepan with a few slices of carrot and onion, and sufficient stock to cover the vegetables. Simmer gently for about forty minutes. Toast a block of bread, and place the sweetbread on it. Brush over with melted meat glaze. Serve with a little good gravy, or sauce, round the dish. If vegetables are desirable, stew a few green peas, or boil some spinach. Drain and rub through a hair sieve. Reheat with a small pat of butter, and place at the corners of the dish. H

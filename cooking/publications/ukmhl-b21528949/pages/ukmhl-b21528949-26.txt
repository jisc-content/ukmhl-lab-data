18 SICKROOM COOKERY. Digestion so changes the food, that it may he readily absorbed by the blood vessels in the walls of the stomach and intestine. The process of digestion is commenced in the mouth by the grinding of the teeth, while the saliva acts on the starch, turning it into sugar or maltose. Digestion proceeds in the stomach, where the pepsine of the gastric juices acts on the albuminous foods, turning them into soluble albumoses and peptones, which are readily absorbed and conveyed to the liver. The starchy foods are not acted on by the pepsine of the stomach. Digestion is completed in the small intestine, where the bile and pancreatic juices act on the fats which have not been affected by the saliva or gastric juices, and form an emulsion of minute globules which is absorbed by the lacteals of the intestine. Here such starch, also, as has not been converted into sugar by the saliva, is acted on by the pancreatic juices and turned into glucose, when it is easily absorbed. Insufficient mastication, excess of undigested starch in the stomach, deficient gastric juice to dissolve the albu- minous foods, excess of fat in the diet, or hurried meals, are all fruitful causes of indigestion. Also, many people have constitutional peculiarities rendering certain foods antipathetic, or impossible of digestion to them. All these things must be taken into consideration in the diet. Food in indigestion or dyspepsia should be simple, nutritious, and well cooked. It should be eaten slowly, and mixtures should be avoided. Three to four hours should be allowed to elapse between each meal, to allow of the digestion of the previous food taken. As a rule the following foods will be found very indi- gestible : Pastry, rich highly-spiced dishes, sauces, pork, veal, steak, beef, goose, duck, rabbit, fatty meats, greasily

6 SICKROOM COOKERY. The casein of milk, from the contact with the acid juices in the stomach, often sets into hard thick curds, very difficult of digestion. By boiling the milk before use, the casein is divided into fine flakes, and cannot afterwards form curds. The addition of barley water, or an alkaline water, such as soda water, to the milk has the same effect. Cream contains most of the milk fat, a fair proportion of the casein, with a small proportion of sugar and mineral matters. Skim Milk is a light, digestible food. It is naturally deficient in milk fat, but contains a large proportion of milk sugar, and mineral matters. It is light, nutritious, and by the addition of a small pat of butter is excellent for milk puddings. Whey is a very nutritious and digestible food. It is easily made from milk by the addition of an acid when boiling. Sherry, lemon juice, or butter milk will do this. It should be strained through muslin and the whey served. The curds are exceedingly indigestible. The whey contains about one-fourth of this nitrogenous matter, some of the mineral matter, and all the sugar. The curds contain much of the casein and milk fat. Junket is easily made by heating a pint of milk to 98° Fah., adding a teaspoonful of sugar and a measureful of junket powder or essence of rennet (see Index, “Junket ”). It must then stand without being moved, until set into a firm cream. This is an excellent food in fever -where it agi’ees, or in convalescence. Butter is a product of cream or milk. It consists largely of milk fat in a very digestible form.

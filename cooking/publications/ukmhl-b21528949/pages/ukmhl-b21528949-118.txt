no JELLIES AND PUDDINGS. K>« Jelly will always be a favourite with invalids and con- valescents. It is cool, refreshing, and easily taken. It is also stimulating from the wine with which it is flavoured. In the case of milk jelly, egg jelly, and amber jelly, they are nourishing as well, on account of the milk and eggs with which they are made. Gelatine and isinglass are of little value as nutrients, but they are easily digested, and most useful to stiffen jellies. In this way milk, and other foods, can be pre- sented in a solidified and varied form, thus making a change. Calf’s foot jelly, for the same reason, is not more nutri- tious than jelly made from bought gelatine, as it is simply stiffened by the gelatine obtained by boiling the calf’s feet. It derives its restorative properties from the wine and lemon juice added to it. Nevertheless, all jelly is stimulating and refreshing, and often tempts the appetite when more solid food would fail. Light, well-cooked, farinaceous or milk puddings are useful in the sickroom dietary. They are easily digested, and can be made more nourishing by the addition of an egg. At the same time, this renders them less digestible. When an egg has been used, the pudding should be baked in a very moderate oven to prevent the egg from curdling. Stewed fruits, pi’une or fruit moulds, will all be found useful.

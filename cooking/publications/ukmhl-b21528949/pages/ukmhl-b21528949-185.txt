SICKROOM COOKERY. 177 peptonisation proceeds, a slightly bitter taste is developed in the milk. The degree unobjectionable to each indi- vidual patieut varies. Therefore it must be tried once or twice, and when the limit is reached, the milk must either be consumed by the patieut at once, or put into a saucepan immediately and brought to the boil. This stops any further action of the liquor pancreaticus, and the milk will keep like ordinary milk. Many people do not object to the slightly bitter taste, but, if desired, a little coffee added to the peptonised milk will mask this. PEPTONISED GRUEL. 1 pint of thick gruel. 2 teaspoonfuls of Benger’s liquor pancreaticus. Boil the gruel until well cooked, and very thick. Pour into a jug or basin, and let it cool to 140° F. Then stir the liquor pancreaticus well in. Keep warm under a cosy near the fire. Allow it to stand for half an hour to an hour according to the degree of peptonisation desired. Taste to see that it does not become too bitter. Bring the mixture to the boil and strain. Serve the strained gruel. lhe gruel may be made with oatmeal, cornflour, arrow- root, wheaten flour, pearl barley, sago, ground pea or lentil flour, or with any farinaceous food. By peptonising the gruel, the starch is turned into sugar, which makes it easier of digestion, and the albuminoid matters are peptonised. The change of the starch into sugar causes the gruel to become quite thin, therefore it should be thick to begin with. N

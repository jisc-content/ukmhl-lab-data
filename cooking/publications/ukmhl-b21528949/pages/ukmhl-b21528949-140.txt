If lemon flavouring is objected to, omit the lemon, and use a few drops of vanilla. A little apricot jam may be served with the pudding, if allowed. RICE PUDDING. 1 oz. of rice. \ pint of milk. 1 dessertspoonful of castor sugar. 1 egg. (Optional.) Simmer the rice very gently in the milk until tender. Let it cool a little, stir in the castor sugar and the egg well beaten (if using one). Pour into a buttered piedish and bake in a moderate oven for half an hour. An egg adds nourishment to the pudding, but at the same time renders it less easy of digestion.

(diabetic.) 3 oz. of unsweetened cocoanut. 1 small dessertspoonful of almond flour. 2 (-Jrgrain) tabloids of saccharine. 1 dessertspoonful of water. 1 white of egg, stiffly whipped. Put the two tabloids of saccharine to soak in the water. Put the cocoanut into a basin, add the almond flour, and mix. Stir in the whipped white of egg, and pour the saccharine and water over. Mix until the mixture is just sufficiently moistened to stick together. Place in small rough pyramids on a lightly-buttered baking tin. Bake for twelve minutes until crisp and a pale fawn colour. N.B.â€”The white of egg should be added by degrees, only using sufficient to bind the mixture together. GLUTEN BREAD. (diabetic.)

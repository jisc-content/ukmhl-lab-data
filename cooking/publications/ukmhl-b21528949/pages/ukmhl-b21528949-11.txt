SICKROOM COOKERY. 3 living tissues of tlie body. White of egg, consisting almost entirely of albumen, may be taken as a type of the proteids, which also form the major part of all meats. They are present also in less amount in milk (casein), in bread (gluten), and in considerable amount in certain vegetables (legumin), as in peas, beans, and lentils. The carbohydrates are found in foods mainly derived from vegetable sources, especially grain foods, as from wheat, rice, barley, oats, arrowroot, Indian corn (corn flour), and also in vegetables like the potato, and in the form of sugar in many fruits and vegetables. It must be remembered that sugar as such, in milk and in various combinations, is an important variety of the carbohydrates. The fats are derived from the fats of meat and fish, from milk, cream, butter and cheese, and from oils used in various ways in the preparation of food. It will be seen that the necessary compounds of the body are found in the ordinary daily foods, and that by a judicious selection a diet supplying all needs is secured. A complete or perfect food contains in itself all the elements of which the body is composed. Milk may be taken as the type of a perfect food, containing as it does proteid (casein), carbohydrates (sugar of milk), fat (cream), salts (calcium and others), and water. The essentials for a perfect diet are therefore proteid, carbohydrates, fat, water, and salts. (1.) These essentials must be present in the diet in proper amount and proportion. (2.) The diet must be adapted to climate, age, sex of individual, and to the amount of woi-k to be done. (3.) The essentials of diet must be present in a digestible form.

SICKROOM COOKERY. 154 ARROWROOT. + \ pint of milk. 1 dessertspoonful of arrowroot. 1 teaspoonfnl of castor sugar. Mix the arrowroot with a little cold milk to a smooth paste. Boil half a pint of milk and pour it on. Return to the saucepan and boil for six minutes, stirring all the time, as arrowroot is never cooked until well boiled. Add the sugar and serve. This is nourishing on account of the milk. Water arrowroot is made in the same way. BARLEY WATER (Thick). 2 oz. of pearl barley. 1 pint of water. Sugar to taste. Blanch the barley, put it into one pint of water, and gently boil down to two-thirds of the liquid. Strain. Add sugar to taste. Barley contains much mucilage, and, by boiling, this is extracted. Milk often sets into thick curds in the stomach, and by the addition of barley water is rendered more digestible. Referring to this Dr. Burney Yeo says: “ Thickening substances or attenuants act purely mechani- cally by, as it were, getting between the particles of casein during coagulation, and so preventing their running together and forming large compact masses. The best for this purpose is barley water or barley jelly.” (“ Barley Jelly,” p. 173.) Barley water will only keep fresh for a few hours, and should be kept in a cool place. When made it should never be heated to boiling point again, as it sets up fermentation and renders it unfit for use.

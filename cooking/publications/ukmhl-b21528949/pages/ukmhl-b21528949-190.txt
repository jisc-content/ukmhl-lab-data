SICKROOM COOKERY. 182 STERILISATION OF MILK. (Dr. Burney Yeo.) “ The complete sterilisation of milk is by no means an easy matter. It is true that the typhoid bacillus, the bacillus of green diarrhoea in infants, and the bacillus of tubercle, are all killed at a temperature of 70° C., and the raising of milk to this temperature for a time is capable, therefore, of destroying them; but a few living spores remain which require a heat of 107° to 108° C. to destroy ; but these develop slowly, and for most practical purposes a heat of 80° C., applied to the twenty-four or forty-eight hours’ supply, ought to annihilate the injurious microbes. Perfect sterilisation can only be effected by submitting the milk to the action of continuous steaming for two hours at a temperature of 248° F., or for thirty minutes at a temperature of 266° F., but this produces changes in the milk which are not desirable We must, therefore, be content with partial sterilisation, which is easily carried out. The most dangerous patho- genic germs can be certainly destroyed by heating for an hour at 154° to 167° F., or heating three-quarters of an hour by steam at 212° F.” BENGER’S FOOD.

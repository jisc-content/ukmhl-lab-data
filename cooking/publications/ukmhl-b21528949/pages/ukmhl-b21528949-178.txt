170 SOME POINTS ON THE PREPARATION OE EOOD EOR THE BOTTLE-EEI) INEANT. By PRANK 0. MADDEN, F.R.C.S. (Medical Superintendent of the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street). The mother’s milk is provided by nature for the needs of the growing infant, and all children should be breast- fed, whenever practicable, if only for a short time. When the breast milk is insufficient in quantity or poor in quality, artificial feeding may be necessary as an addition to the breast-feeding, one feed a day being substituted for a breast-feed. Later, when it is time to wean the child, artificial feeding gradually takes the place of the mother’s milk. When it is necessary to resort to artificial feeding entirely the following points must be observed : Cow’s milk is the most generally satisfactory substi- tute for human milk. It is easily procured, and with ordi- nary care can be obtained practically pure and free from gross contamination. The first indication is to free the cow’s milk from putrefactive micro-organisms. To obtain this result the milk must be boiled. It must next be diluted with water to diminish the proportion of proteids. The water used for dilution must be boiled in the same way as the milk and for the same reason. To sweeten the milk, a small quantity of syrup, sugar of milk, or plain white sugar must be added to each bottle. A teaspoonful of cream, if it can be procured fresh, may also be added. All food must be given lukewarm in a perfectly plain, boat-shaped bottle. A small indiarubber teat is fitted to the neck of the bottle and the meal is ready.

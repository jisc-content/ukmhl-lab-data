SICKROOM COOKERY. 79 ROAST CHICKEN. 1 chicken. 2 tablespoonfuls of butter or dripping. Truss the chicken and roast it before a nice clear fire. Put the butter or dripping in the tin underneath and keep it constantly basted. A small chicken will take about forty minutes, a large one about one hour. When the chicken has commenced to roast, draw it back, and let it go on cooking at a lower degree of heat. When cooked, place on a hot dish, remove the skewers, or trussing string, and serve with watercress and a little good gravy round the dish. If desirable, bread sauce may be served with roast chicken. STEWED CHICKEN. ^ 1 chicken. \ pint of milk. \ pint of water. 1 piece of celery. 1 tablespoonful of flour. 1 yolk of egg. Pepper and salt. Out the chicken into nice-sized pieces. Place it in a white saucepan and cover with the milk and water, or if liked, use second stock. Shred the celery finely across, and put it in. Let this simmer gently for two hours. Blend the flour with a little cold milk or water, and strain it into the stew. Let this boil up to cook the flour, stir- ring to keep it smooth. Add the yolk of egg, season with pepper and salt and serve. If liked, the flour may be omitted, and two tablespoonfuls of cream mixed with the yolk of an egg stirred in.

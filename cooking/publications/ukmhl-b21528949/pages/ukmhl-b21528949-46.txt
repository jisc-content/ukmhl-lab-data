SICKROOM COOKERY. 38 BEEF TEA AND EGG. \ pint of good beef tea. 1 yolk of egg. Salt. Take quarter of a pint of beef tea, made by the recipe for beef tea (1) or (2), page 36. Make it warm in a saucepan. Pour into a teacup and immediately stir in the yolk of an egg, mixing it well through. Season and serve. ESSENCE OF BEEF. (for convalescents.) Beef or mutton may be used for this. Shred finely and place in a jar without any water. Cover and place the jar in a saucepan of boiling water. Simmer gently for two hours. Then strain, and press all the liquid from the meat, and add a little salt. A very small quantity of this is given at a time, as it is strong and savoury. BEEF-TEA JELLY. \ pint of beef tea. oz. of gelatine. Make half a pint of good beef tea, and strain into a basin. Dissolve the gelatine in a couple of tablespoonfuls of water in a saucepan, and strain into the beef tea. Season, and set in small moulds or china ramakin cases. When firm dip into warm water to turn out. If prefeiâ€™red, the jelly may be served in the china cases. A conva- lescent will sometimes take this jelly when tired of beef tea.

SICKROOM COOKERY. 75 the side of the fire, and only let it simmer till tender. If allowed to boil hard it will be tough. Allow quarter of an hour for each pound of meat, and quarter of an hour over on the joint. This rule applies to beef and mutton. A very solid piece of meat without bone will require twenty minutes to the pound and twenty minutes over on the joint. For pork or veal allow twenty minutes to each pound and twenty minutes over on the joint. These meats are very close in texture and indigestible, and for that reason they require longer cooking to make them wholesome and tender. For this same cause they are very little used in invalid cookery. Chicken or pheasant will take three-quarters of an hour to one hour and a quarter to boil, according to their size and age. Partridges will take about forty minutes, and pigeons half an hour. By plunging meat into boiling water it seals up the outside of the meat by hardening the albumen, thus keep- ing in the juices of the meat. After the first five minutes it should be cooked below boiling point to ensure the tenderness of the meat. A piece of carrot, turnip and onion should always be boiled with meat or chicken, unless specially prohibited, as these vegetables much improve the flavour. If liked, chickens or birds may be wrapped in buttered paper and cooked gently in the stock- pot. The paper prevents them becoming discoloured. RULES FOR ROASTING. Make up a clear fire. Wipe the meat well with a damp cloth and weigh it.

SICKROOM COOKERY. 7 Cheese is manufactured from cream or milk. By the addition of an acid, the casein and milk fat are separated from the liquid into thick curd. By further processes it is converted into cheese. Thus cheese is highly nutritious, but decidedly difficult of digestion, and therefore unsuit- able for an invalid or for those leading sedentary lives. During hard out-door work or periods of much activity and fatigue it is an excellent and nutritious food. Flour is obtained from wheat. This is the only cereal which contains the albuminoid gluten, which possesses the valuable property of being able to raise a sponge. The second quality, or household flour, is the most nutritious, and for the following reason. The wheat grain has six coats or coverings. The centre is almost pure starch, and very white. The outer coats are rich in flesh and bone- forming material, although slightly yellow in colour. For the finest flour the miller cuts away the outer coatings, and mills up the centre, thus producing a very white, light flour. This is excellent for fancy rolls, but should not be used for household bread. For the second quality this process cannot be afforded, and several of the outer coats are milled up as well, thus giving a much more nutritious flour, although not so white in colour. Arrowroot and Cornflour are forms of almost pure starch and belong to the heat-giving force-producing foods. They are best combined with foods rich in flesh- forming substances, such as milk and eggs. Rice, Sago and Tapioca are also largely composed of starch, and are better combined with nitrogenous foods, such as milk, eggs, and if suitable a little butter.

PREFACE This book has been compiled in the hope that it may prove useful to all professionally engaged in Nursing, and to those who have to direct the preparation of food for the sick or convalescent. The recipes are given in the simplest and most tempting form, and, wherever possible, the nutritive value and specific use have been mentioned. A chapter on Diet has been included for the help of those not well acquainted with the value of foods. Strictly speaking, the number of dishes used during an acute attack of illness is small; but for many convalescents, for those suffering from Consumption, Gout, or Diabetes, the diet may be very varied and dainty. Many of the recipes are adapted from those in use at the National Training School of Cookery

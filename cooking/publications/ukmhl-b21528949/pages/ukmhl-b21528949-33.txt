25 SICKROOM COOKERY. The following foods will generally be found useful: Milk, milk and soda, milk and barley water, peptonised milk, Benger’s food, plain biscuits, a little cold coffee, arrowroot, or cornflour, rice milk flavoured with cinnamon or cloves, and all starchy foods. Later on, when conva- lescent, boiled sole or whiting, toast, poached eggs, egg and brandy, junket, weak tea, chicken, and rice puddings may be given. The following foods should be avoided, as they cause irritation : Meats, beef tea, raw fruits, oatmeal, green vegetables, and potatoes. Occasionally it will be found that milk or eggs disagree with a particular patient, and the diet must be regulated accordingly. In fact the diet must depend on the primary cause. INFANCY. The bottle feeding of infants, and the preparation of infants’ food is quite beyond the scope of the present work. The method of preparing a bottle for infants will be found amongst the recipes (see Index). In CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH food should be plenti- fully supplied, as the change of tissue is rapid, and both flesh-forming and heat-giving foods are necessary for the building up and development of the body. Mineral salts are also needed for strengthening the bones and teeth. Regular meals, nothing between meals, and meat in moderation must be the rule. In MANHOOD, frequently, too much meat and flesh- forming foods are eaten, but the extreme activity of youth and the natural love of exercise enable the body to disj>ose of the surplus supply.

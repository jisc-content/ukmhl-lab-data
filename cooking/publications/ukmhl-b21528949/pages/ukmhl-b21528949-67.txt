SICKROOM COOKERY. 59 hour until tender. Rub through a hair sieve. Melt the second ounce of butter, stir in the flour smoothly, add the sieved soup, and stir until it boils. Boil for three minutes, season, and serve. VEAL BROTH. Use neck of veal or knuckle of veal. Make exactly the same as either of the recipes for mutton broth. Veal makes a very delicately flavoured and delicious broth. FISH. Fish is most useful in the dietary of the convalescent, or for those leading sedentary lives, suffering from indi- gestion, or debarred from exercise. It is more digestible than meat, and contains a considerable amount of nutriment, although not so much as fresh meat. There are two kinds of fish. These may be briefly classed as those in which much of the oil is stored in the liver, and those in which the oil is distributed throughout the flesh, thus making the fish oily, and indigestible. The lightest and most easily digested fish are soles, whiting, haddock, plaice and flounders. Cod, dory and turbot rank next, but are a little firmer in texture. Salmon, herrings, mackerel and eels are rich and indi- gestible, although highly nutritious. For a convalescent, steamed, boiled or baked fish is the most suitable, and later, when more progress has been made, there can be no objection to well-friedsole, whiting or plaice. To choose fish, it should be firm to the touch, the scales and eyes bright, and there should be little or no odour

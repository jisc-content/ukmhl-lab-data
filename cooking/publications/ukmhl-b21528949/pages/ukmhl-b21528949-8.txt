PREFACE. IV (Mrs. Charles Clarke) and have been elaborated in various ways to suit the particular case. To the works of Sir Henry Thompson, Drs. Pavy, Cheadle, Burney Yeo, Muskett, Mrs. Hart, and many others, I must here express my indebtedness. In various parts of the book, and especially in the sections on diet and foods, I have received much valuable help from Mr. Frank C. Madden, F.R.C.S., Medical Superintendent of the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, who has also con- tributed a chapter on Infant Feeding, which I feel sure will be of much value to all who have the control of the occupants of the nursery. In conclusion, I trust my contribution to this some- what neglected branch of cookery may be acceptable to all whose duty it is to provide the necessaries of life for the sick and helpless.

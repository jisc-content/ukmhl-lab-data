153 BEVERAGES. *04 In this section are included all beverages useful in a sickroom. Some have a very specific value of their own, while others, from long custom, have become popular. It often gives pleasure to be able to make a beverage which is much fancied by the patient, or on which a par- ticular value is set. Many of the hot drinks for colds promote perspiration, and should be taken in bed. Some of the egg mixtures are valuable in cases of weakness, as they can be given between meals and prevent exhaustion without interfering with the appetite for the coming repast. APPLE WATER. 2 large apples. 1 pint of boiling water. A few thin strips of lemon peel. 1 tablespoonful of lemon juice. Sugar to taste. Peel and slice the apples. Put them into a jug with the lemon rind, juice, and sugar. Pour over one pint of boiling water. Cover closely until cold, then strain. Roast apples may be used, or the apples and other ingre- dients may be boiled gently in the water for half an hour, then strained. This is a refreshing beverage, and is useful in cases of scurvy.

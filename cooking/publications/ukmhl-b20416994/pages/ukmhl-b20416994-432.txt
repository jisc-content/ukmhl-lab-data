Pack the pickles in a stone jar or firkin. Put all the spices into a bag made of strainer cloth.

Equal quantities of small cucumbers^ the largest ones sliced, green tomatoes sliced, cauliflower picked into flow- erets, and small button onions. Keep them covered with strongly salted water twenty-four hours. In the morning scald the brine, and dissolve in it a bit of alum the size of a nutmeg. Pour the boiling brine over the pickles. When cold, drain thoroughly and prepare as much vinegar as there were quarts of brine. To one quart of vinegar use one cup of brown sugar^ half a cup of flour^ and one fourth of a pound of ground mustard. Boil the sugar and vinegar. Mix the flour and mustard, and stir the boiling vinegar into it, and when smooth pour it over the pickles. Canned Fruit. (Mrs. John Sheldon.) Put the prepared fruit in a jar, and cover with boiling syrup sweetened to taste. On three successive mornings drain off the syrup, boil again, and pour over the fruit. The last morning, let fruit and syrup come just to the boil- ing-point, but do not boil; then seal immediately. Fruit prepared in this way has been tested by the author and found perfect. Strawberries preserve their shape and never ferment.

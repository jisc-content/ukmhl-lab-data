30 The Boston Cook Book. written than the first expression. Place an egg in one tablespoon, then pack butter in another till it fills the spoon in the same proportion as the egg, and 3'ou will easil}^ carry it in mind. Have your materials measured or at hand, and all uten- sils ready before beginning the mixing, or putting the ingredients together. Keep a bucket or pan full of flour, freshly sifted each day, and ready for use. Measure flour first, and put it in a bowl or pan together with salt, soda, cream of tartar, and spice ; measure butter and put it in the mixing-bowl; then measure the sugar, and, in scraping out the sugar, take the butter which has adhered to the cup. Break yom eggs on the edge of the cup ; if the white be clear, the egg is good. Put the yolks in one bowl and the whites in another; measure the milk or liquid, and, after using the beaten j^olk, clean out the bowl with the milk. Or, measure all the dry ingredients, break and sep- arate the eggs, measure the milk, add it to the beaten yolks, and measure the melted butter last. In either way you can make one cup do for all without washing. Two eggs beaten separately " means that the yolks and whites are to be beaten separately, not each whole egg beaten separately. A tablespoonful of melted hutter is measured after melt- ing. A tablespoonful of hutter melted is measured before melting. To economize space, in many of the receipts the abbre- viations are written: one cup for one cupful, tablesp. for tablespoonful, teasp. for teaspoonful, and saltsp. for salt- spoonful. All these measures mean a full measure, unless scant or heaping measures are specified.

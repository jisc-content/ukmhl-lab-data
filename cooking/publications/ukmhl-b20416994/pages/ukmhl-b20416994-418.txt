The Boston Cook Book. 392 Oranges may be served whole or cut. Many slice them across the sections ; but the presence of the seeds and tough inner skin is objectionable. A better way is to remove all the rind and white skin, divide into sections, then with the point of a silver fruit-knife cut off the inner skin in the middle, slip out the seeds, and cut each section into three pieces. Never serve with the seeds left in, nor sweeten until just before serving. A neat way to peel an orange is to cut the rind from the ends and leave a strip round the middle, then open, leaving the sections on the strip of peel. Or cut the oranges in halves crosswise without peeling, sprinkle with sugar, and eat with a spoon. Grapes, Malagas especially, should be carefully rinsed in cold water, then drained. Fruit scissors should be used to divide the clusters. Bananas may be served whole, or sliced and slightly sweetened or salted. Peaches should have the wool wiped off, or if pared and quartered should be sprinkled with fine granulated sugar, and served at once. Strawberries, if gritty, should be rinsed and drained, then hulled, and not sweetened till served. Large selected berries may be served with the stems on. Pass sugar with them, that those who prefer may roll them in it. Currants should be sweetened, and large whole clusters may be served on the stem. Currants and raspberries are dehcious when served together. Watermelons should be served very cold. Cut off a slice at each end, that each half may stand upright. Serve the core only, taking it out with a tablespoon in cone- shaped pieces. Other melons should have the seeds re- moved before serving, be cut in halves, a lump of ice in each, and served with sugar or salt. Bineapples. â€” Tare, remove the eyes, and cut in thin slices ; then remove the fibrous centre, and serve in slices, or cut the tender parts into small pieces and sweeten to taste. Or pare and pull off the tender part with a fork, as directed for preserved pineapple.

82 The Boston Cook Booh food than a spot of soda, even if it be but the size of a pin-head, and no one should excuse such negligence. Baking-Powders. â€” When 3^our druggist or cook is not to be relied upon, use a baking-powder which has been tested and proved pure. Pure baking-powders are soda and cream of tartar mixed by weight in the proper pro- portion, and combined with rice flour, cornstarch, or some harmless ingredient to insure their keeping. To allow for this starch the measure should be a little more than the combined amount of soda and cream of tartar; three rounding teaspoonfuls of haking-'powder being equal to one level teaspoonful of soda and two full teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar. One even teaspoonful of baking-powder for each cup of flour is a convenient formula. Soda is also neutralized by sour milk or lactic acid. This is economical, particularly for those who have pure milk and more than they can use while it is sweet. But milk is often adulterated, and, in winter, grows bitter before it sours ; and the degree of acidity varies so much that the result is often failure. Sour milk is best when it sours quickly, and is thick and smooth, not separated. One even teaspoonful of soda to one pint of nicely thickened or loppered milk is the proportion. When the milk tastes or smells sour, but is not thick, use it as sweet milk in gingerbread or brown bread, where 3'ou have molasses to complete the acidity. Add a very little more soda if the receipt call for sweet milk, or a little less if for sour milk. Nearly all kinds of soda biscuit, muffins, gems, etc., should have the dry ingredients mixed in one bowl, and the liquids, such as milk, eggs, melted butter, etc., in another ; and when ready to bake, stir the two quickly and thoroughly together, and bake immediately in a very hot oven. Molasses gives another acid which is combined with soda, to raise and lighten dough. Directions for its use are given under rules for brown bread and molasses gingerbread.

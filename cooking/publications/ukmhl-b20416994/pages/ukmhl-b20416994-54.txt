Separate the membrane under the body without breaking. Thus 3'ou have the flesh in the skin, and the skeleton left entire with the con- tents undisturbed in the inside. Lay the stuffing in, filling out the legs and wings, then sew the skin along the back, and skewer or tie into the original shape. An easier way of boning a fowl where it is to be rolled like a galantine^ is to cut off the wings at the second joint, break the drumstick half-way from the joint, cut the skin down the entire length of the back, remove the flesh from the wing and second joint, turning the skin and flesh off like a glove ; then do the same on the other wing and leg, leaving the breast till the last. The wings and legs are turned inside, the stuffing is laid in the flesh, and the whole rolled over and over, and sewed on the edge of the skin and at the ends of the roll. Measuring. It has been said that good cooks never measure am^- thing."- They do. They measure by judgment and ex- perience ; and until you have a large share of both these essential qualities, use your spoon and cup or scales. Measures, in preference to weights, are used in nearly all these receipts, as they are more convenient for the ma- jority of housekeepers. When measured and estimated by the Table of Weights and Measures on page 30, the cup and spoon may be used as accurately as the scales. Flour, meal, sugar, salt, spices, and soda should al- ways be sifted before measuring. Any other materials that have been packed, like mustard and baking powder, if not sifted, should be stirred, and broken up lightl3\ One tablespoonful of solid mustard taken carelessly from the box has been found equal to three tablespoonfuls measured afcer sifting. The saltspoons, teaspoons, and tablespoons used in these receipts are the silver spoons now in general use. Iron

The Boston Cook Book. 143 White Soup Stock. White soup stock is made from veal or chicken, sea- soned with onion, celer}^ salt, and white pepper, avoiding anything which will give it color. White soups are thick- ened with rice, cornstarch,- flour, eggs, or the white meat of chicken chopped fine, and are made still richer by milk or cream. Wipe and cut the veal into small pieces. Put it into the kettle with the cold water. Heat slowly and skim, because we do not wish the soup colored. Add the salt, peppercorns, onions, and celery. Simmer five hours, strain, and when cool remove the fat. There should be about three pints of stock. When ready to use it, put the stock on to boil, and the milk into the double boiler. Thicken the stock with one tablespoonful of butter and one heaping tablespoonful of cornstarch, cooked together. Add the boiling milk, the salt, and pepper. Beat two eggs until light, put them in the tureen, and strain the boiling soup over them. Many people prefer to use the yolks of the eggs only. This makes a ^^ellow soup. Others vary it by boiling the eggs hard and rubbing the yolks through a gravy strainer after the soup is in the tureen. This veal stock may be clarified with the white of an egg, if you wish it transparent. But it is better with the milk or cream, and should be highly seasoned, and re- duced one half by boiling, as when made from veal alone it is insipid. Serve with croutons.

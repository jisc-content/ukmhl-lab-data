The Boston Cook Book. 302 Cabbage. Select a small heavy cabbage. Remove the outside leaves, cut mto quarters, cut off the tough stalk, soak in cold salted water half an hour. Cook till tender in boil- ing salted water, changing the water twice. Drain, cut or chop fine, season with salt and hutter^ or cover with vjhite sauce and buttered crumbs^ and bake till the crumbs are brown. The cauliflower and cabbage contain more gluten, and are therefore more nutritious, than any other vegetable food. They should be eaten with fat and oily food, and require an acid, like lemon juice or vinegar, as a condi- ment. Cabbage is considered indigestible, and man}^ boil with it a small piece of red pepper to counteract this effect. If the water in which cabbage is boiled be changed two or three times, less of the strong odor and flavor is retained. With proper treatment this vegetable may be served as temptingly as any other. It is more wholesome when served in its raw state as a salad than when cooked. Celery. Scrape clean, and cut the stalks into inch pieces ; cook in boiling salted water half an hour, or until tender. Drain and mix with 2i white sauce ; or dip them m fritter batter^ and fry in hoi fcut. Celer}^ is usually eaten raw, as a salad, but is more digestible when cooked. Celery is particularly good for nervous or rheumatic people. Egg Plant. Cut the plant into slices one third of an inch thick, with- out removing the skin. Sprinkle salt over each slice, pile them, and cover with a weight to press out the juice. Drain, and dip each slice first in fine crumbs^ then in beaten egg^ and again in crumbs^ and saute them in hot fat. Egg plants belong to the same famil}^ as the potato and tobacco, all of which contain a bitter juice, more or less poisonous.

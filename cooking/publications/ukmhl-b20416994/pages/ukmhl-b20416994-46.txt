Koasting (meaning to heat violently" ) is cooking be- fore an open fire ; it implies the action of a much greater degree of heat than that emplo3^ed in any of the previously specified methods of cooking. The heat of an open fire is about 1,000°. In the days of open fireplaces this was the general way of cooking large pieces of meat; but now it is adopted only in large establishments, or by those who can afibrd the additional expense of a tin kitchen, and a range con- structed especiall}^ for roasting. Baking, or roasting in a very hot oven, being a cheaper and more convenient way, is more generally used. Ovens in stoves and ranges are now well ventilated; and meat when properly cooked in a very hot oven, and basted often, is nearly equal in flavor to that roasted before an open fire. The fire for roasting should be clear and bright, and of sufficient body to last, with only a slight sprinkling of coal, through the time for roasting. The meat is placed on a spit, and hung in the jack in a tin kitchen, and made to revolve slowly before the fire by winding a spring in the jack, or b}^ turning the spit at regular intervals. The meat should be rubbed with salt and flour, and placed on the spit, ver}^ near the fire at first, to harden the albumen ; then removed a little dis- tance to prevent the meat from burning, before the inside is cooked. Place two or three spoonfuls of dripping in the pan to use in basting the meat ; baste often, and dredge two or three times with flour. When the joint is very large, place a buttered paper over it. As the juices of meat are composed largely of water, the water will be evaporated as soon as it reaches the boiling-point, or 212°. When meat is placed in a moder- ate oven, the heat is not suflScient to harden the albumen

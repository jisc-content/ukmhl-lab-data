299 The Boston Cook Book, Green or Sweet Corn. Remove the husk, and every thread of the silk}^ fibre. Put into boiUng water, cover with the clean inner husks, and cook from five to fifteen minutes. Try a kernel, and take up the corn as soon as the milk has thickened and the raw taste is destroyed. Corn, if boiled a long time, is made hard and its flavor impaired. Green Corn Fritters^ or Mock Oysters, — Cut through each row of kernels with the point of a sharp knife. Then with the back of the knife press out the pulp, and leave the hull on the cob. This is better and easier than to shave or grate off the kernels. To one pint of corn pulp add tiDO well-beaten eggs,, half a teaspoonful of salt^ half a saltspoonful pepper^ and two tablespoonfuls of flour^ or just enough to keep the corn and egg together. Do not add milk, as then more flour will be required, and this destroys the flavor of the corn. Fry in small cakes on a buttered griddle, and brown well on each side ; or add more flour, and drop by spoonfuls into deep fat. When highly seasoned with salt and pepper^ these fritters have the flavor of oysters. Make in the same way with canned corn, finel}^ chopped. Add two tablespoonfuls of milk,, as the canned corn is less moist than the fresh. Succotash, — This may be made b}" mixing equal quan- tities of shelled beans and corn cut from the cob, having first cooked and seasoned them separately. Or cut the raw corn from the cob, by scoring each row and pressing the pulp out with the back of the knife, leaving the hulls on the cob, and when the beans are nearly soft, add the corn, and cook fifteen minutes. Add cream, butter^ salt^ and sugar to taste. In winter, when the vegetables are dry and hard, soak the corn and Lima beans over night. Put the beans on in cold water, changing it twice. As soon as it boils, add the corn, and cook slowly several hours, or till soft. Sea- son with butter^ sugar,, and salt. Canned Lima beans and canned corn are also used.

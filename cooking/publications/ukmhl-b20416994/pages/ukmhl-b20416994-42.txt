The Boston Cook Book. i6 should be reheated to the test point before frying any more. Time. —Any cooked mixture, such as fish balls and cro- quettes, or very small fish, oysters, scallops, etc., will be fried brown in one minute. Thicker fish, chops, and frit- ters require longer cooking; and, after plunging them into the hot fat, the kettle should be set back from the fire to prevent them from becoming too brown before they are sufficiently cooked. While frying, be careful not to spill any fat on the stove. Keep a tin plate in your left hand, and hold it under the basket, or ladle, as you take things from the fat. Draining. — Thorough draining is another secret of nice frying, and 3^ou cannot find a much hotter place than right over the hot fat; so hold your basket of fried food over the hot fat, and shake slightly, till all dripping has stopped. Then place the fried articles on soft or unglazed paper, to absorb the fat, and keep them hot till ready to serve. Never pile fried articles one on another. Fat for Frying. Lard, a mixture of half suet and half lard, drippings, or oil, may be used for frying. Suet and drippings are cheap- est, and are preferred by many. Suet used alone cools very quickly and leaves a tallowy taste. Drippings should be carefully clarified (see page 18) and freed from water, or the articles cooked will soak fat. Lard, with a small proportion of suet or drippings, is more generally satisfac- tory. There is often a ver}^ disagreeable odor to new lard, and more or less water in it, as is shown b}^ the froth and ebullition as soon as it becomes hot. Before it is used for any purpose it should be clarified with slices of raw potato and heated until it becomes still. Olive oil is the purest fat for frying, but it is too expensive for general use. Cotton- seed oil has been recently introduced for cooking purposes, and is an excellent fat for frying, though mau}^ dislike its peculiar odor. It may be heated much hotter than lard,

The Boston Cook Book, I20 not leak â€” will better answer the purpose. After breakfast or dinner, do not put away the remnants of steaks or roasts on the platters, but look them over and put by themselves any pieces that can be used again, either cold or in what are called made dishes. Then put all the bones, trimmings, fat, gristle, and everything, especially the platter gravy, which usually flavors the dish-water, into the catch all/' If you have just one bone from a steak or chop, if it be not burned it is worth saving, and in cool weather will keep till you have another.

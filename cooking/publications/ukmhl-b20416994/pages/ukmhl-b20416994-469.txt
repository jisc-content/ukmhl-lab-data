The Boston Cook Book. 443 Dave's" method of washing dishes, though not in general use, has been proved satisfactor}^ Place a pan of cold water between the washing and rinsing pans. After washing and wiping the glasses and silver, add more hot water, and wash the china first in the hot suds, then dip each dish instantlj^ into the cold water, and stand it on the edge to drain in the rinsing-pan. The cold water rinses off the hot suds, and the sudden change of tempera- ture dries the dishes almost instantly; and they require little or no wiping. They will be neither " sticky nor streak3^" Where there is only one woman for " cook, waitress, hostess, and kitchen girl," it is well, after the table is cleared and the dishes neatl}^ packed, to wash first the kitchen dishes, and pots and kettles; then with clean water and towels wash and wipe the table dishes. The hands will be left in much better condition than when the pots and kettles are washed last. The Care of Kitchen Utensils. A complete list of kitchen utensils is not given in this work, as the variety and number needed will be largely determined by circumstances. There are several utensils, which are not perhaps in general use, which lessen the labor of cooking, and add much to the attractiveness of food prepared by their aid. There is nothing that makes so much difference between ordinary and delicate cooking as a set of strainers. There should be one of very fine wire for sifting soda, spices, etc., and for straining custards and jellies; others with meshes from one sixteenth to one eighth of an inch in diameter; also a squash strainer and a colander. Ex- tension wire strainers are very convenient. Keep also a supply of strainer cloths^ made from coarse crash or cheese cloth^ and fine napkin linen. A set of oval tin moulds^ a melon mouldy and one or two fancy moulds are convenient for entrees, puddings, and jellies.

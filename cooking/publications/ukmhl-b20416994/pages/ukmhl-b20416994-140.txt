The}' are general!quite expensive, and some soon get out of order, if not handled carefull}'. The spout of the coffee-pot should be closed with a cork, or a thimble fitted for that purpose, or a piece of soft brown paper twisted so as to form a stopper. This prevents the escape of the steam and aroma. Coffee, if allowed to boil, should stand at least ten minutes after boiling, to give it time to settle and become clear. Roasting Coffee. Put one pound of raw coffee in a small frying-pan. Place it on the stove, and shake and stir occasion all}' for fifteen minutes, or till yellow. Then cover it, and increase the heat, and shake till the kernels are all a deep cinnamon or chestnut color, and have an oily appearance. Be careful that none are burned. Keep it covered, and when still warm, not hot, add one egg and its shell. Beat until every kernel is coated with the egg. The egg will dry quickly.

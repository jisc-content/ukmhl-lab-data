256 The Boston Cook Book. Gravy for Roast Poultry and Game, â€”Put the giblets^ or neck, liver, gizzard, and heart, on to boil in one quart of water^ and boil till tender, and the water reduced to one pint. Mash the liver, and if desired chop the gizzard, heart, and meat from the neck. Pour off the clear fat from the dripping-pan, and put the settlings into a sauce- pan ; rinse out the pan with the water in which the giblets were boiled, and pour this water into the saucepan and put on to boil. Put three or four tahlespoonfals of the fat into a small frying-pan ; add enough dry flour to absorb all the fat, and when brown add the giblet liquor gradu- all}', and stir till it thickens. Season with salt and pep- per. If not smooth, strain it; pour half of it into the gravy boat, and add the chopped giblets to the remaining half, and serve separately, as all may not care for the giblet gravy. Koast Turkey. Clean as directed on page 252. Stuff with soft bread or cracker crumbs highly seasoned with sage^ thyme^ salt,, and pepper ; moisten the stuffing with half a cup of melted butter,, and hot water enough to make it quite moist. Add one beaten egg. Some use salt pork chopped fine, but stuffing is more wholesome without it. Oysters, chestnuts,, chopped celery, stoned raisins, or dates make a pleasing variety. For Stuffing and Trussing, see page 254. Put the turkey on a rack in a pan, rub well with butter, and dredge with salt, pepper, and flour. Put in a hot oven, and when the flour is browned reduce the heat, and add a pint of water. Baste with butter until nicely browned; then with the fat in the pan. Baste often, and dredge with salt and flour after every basting. Allow three hours for an eight-pound turkey. Cook till the legs will separate from the body. Prepare the gravy as directed above. Garnish the tur- key with parsley or celery leaves and sausages or force-meat halls. Serve cranberry sauce or currant jelly with roast turkey.

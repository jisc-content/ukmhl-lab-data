The Boston Cook Book. 76 Stale Bread Steamed. Have a large covered steamer fitting tightly over a ket- tle of boiling water. One with holes all over the bottom is best, as the steam condenses and runs down the sides and through the holes ; while in those with holes only in the middle it forms little pools of water round the edge, which make the bread soggy. Do not put in the bread until everything else is ready, as it takes only a few min- utes for it to become heated through. Arrange it all in the middle of the steamer, tilted against a small cup or dish so that the steam may pass between the slices. Do not let any of it touch the sides of the steamer, or it will become water-soaked. When ready to remove it, lift the cover quickly, turning it over instantl}^, that no water may drip on the bread. Spread each slice with butter as you take it out, and arrange them on a hot platter. Cover with a napkin and serve immediately. Stale biscuit may be made much nicer than new in this way. These direc- tions may seem needlessly minute ; but it is just these little things that make the difference between light, deli- cate, hot steamed bread, and the heavy, water-soaked stuff that is often served. Egg Toast, or Bread Sauted. 1 egg. [ 1 cup milk. 1 saltspoonful salt. | 4 to 6 slices stale bread. Beat the egg lightly with a fork in a shallow pudding- dish ; add salt and milk. Soak the bread in this until soft. Turn the slices by putting those underneath on the top, and dip the custard over them, being careful not to break them. Have a griddle hot and well buttered. Brown them on one side; then put a piece of butter on the top of each slice, and turn and brown on the other side. To be eaten hot with butter, also with sugar and cinnamon if liked. This is one of the nicest ways of freshening stale bread, and is especially convenient when the fire is not in

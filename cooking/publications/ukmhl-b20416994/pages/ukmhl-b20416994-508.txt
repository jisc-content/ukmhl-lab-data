The Plant takes in, water, by its roots; carbonic acid, by its leaves; nitrogen, in the form of ammonia and nitric acid; minerals, in the form of phos- phoric acid, lime, common and other salts, from the soil. The Animal takes in, water^ starch, fat, gluten, and mineral matters, in the form of vege- table and animal food, into its stomach; and oxygen into its lungs. The Soil takes in, urea and other animal excretions, dead animals and plants. The Plant produces, oxygen^ from its leaves; sugar^ starch, gluten, and mineral matters, in its sap and solid substances. The Animal produces, car- honic acid and luater, which are exhaled from the skin and lungs; urea, phosphates, and other salts, in the excretions; the fat in the bod}^, which is in time breathed away in the form of carbonic acid; water and perfect muscle, hone, hlood, and tissues, to build and repair the body. The Soil produces, carbon in the form of wood and coal, and in spring water; ammonia, ni- tric acid, and other nitrogenous compounds; phosphoric acid, lime, common salt, and other mineral matters. So the movement is circular; the beginning is the end. A marvellous commerce appears; soil, plant, and animal commin- gling; the elements of each being at different times the elements of all, and their interchange perpetual.

The Boston Cook Book. 46 Teast, what is it? — Yeast is a plant or germ of the fungus tribe. Under the microscope it is found to consist of numberless minute rounded or oval bodies which are true vegetable cells. Yeast is therefore one of the simplest or sap. They grow or expand from the minutest micro- scopic points, and seem to bud off from each other and multiply into many millions to the cubic inch. These cells are easily propagated in any medium where they find congenial food, particularly in the juice of grapes. If grape-juice be filtered and left to stand in a warm place two or three hours, it becomes first cloudy, then thick, and gives off bubbles of gas, showing there has been some change in its composition. In a short time a grayish- yellow froth, or layer of yeast cells, collects on the surface. " Whether the germs or spores of the yeast plant exist already in the juices of the living grape, or whether they are always floating in the air, and cling to the exterior of the fruit, and only become mixed with the juice in the wine- press, is not known ; " neither is it known just how they decompose the sugar of the grape. But it is enough for our purpose to know that they grow in the juice and ex- pand there, and that an active ferment may be dissolved out of these yeast cells, sufficient to cause alcoholic fermentation. The natural development of yeast through the agency of plants is too slow and inconvenient a process to rely upon ; therefore we manufacture it from various substances rich in starch and sugar. Brewer's yeast is made from malt, or sprouting grain, usually barley; home-made j^east, from flour and potatoes.

305 The Boston Cook Book. Carrots and Turnips. Carrots and turnips contain, instead of starch, a gelati- nous gummy substance, called pectine. They are useful in soups, giving them a fine flavor and color. Soups in which carrots are used are gelatinous when cold. Carrots are not a favorite vegetable for the table; but if 3'oung and tender, they are palatable when boiled, and served in a white sauce. They should be washed and scraped (not pared) before boiling. Old carrots are sometimes boiled, and served with corned beef and salt fish. Their rich color makes them eff'ective as a garnish. The red, outside part is considered the best, as the inside is stringy. Turnips contain but little nutriment. They are very waterj^, and having no starch are agreeable food to be eaten with potatoes. They contain no salt, and therefore need more than other vegetables. Being w^hoUy deficient in starch and fat, they are good with fat meat, corned beef, roast pork, and mutton. Turnips in White Sauce. — Wash and cut French tur- nips into half or three-quarter inch slices ; pare and cut each slice into strips, and then into cubes. Boil in boiling salted water until tender. Drain and pour white sauce over them. Turnips may also be mashed, drained, and seasoned with butter^ pepper., and salt. Parsnips. Parsnips contain starch and sugar, a small portion of gluten, and less water than carrots or turnips. They are eaten with salt fish and corned beef. Those which have remained in the ground through the winter are considered the best. The}^ should be washed and scrubbed thor- oughh^, but are more easily peeled after boiling. Cut them into half-inch cubes, and serve in v^hite sauce, JParsnip Fritters, — After boiling the parsnips, plunge them into cold water and the skins will shp off easil}^ mash them, and season to taste with butter^ salt^ and pepper.

All bread crumbs left on the plates or bread board or in the bread jar, any broken pieces not suitable for toast, and any crusts or trimmings of toast should be carefully collected in a pan by themselves, and dried (not browned) in the hot closet or in a moderate oven, then pounded in a mortar or rolled on an old bread board, sifted through a coarse sieve, and put away in a dry place. These will be useful in covering anything which is to be dipped in egg and crumbs and then fried. Bread crumbs brown better than cracker crumbs, and are much cheaper, being made from material which is usually thrown away. These are dried bread crumbs^ and are not to be used for bread pud- ding or scalloped dishes, as they will absorb a great deal of moisture. They will keep indefinitely in a dr}^ place. Stale bread crumbs^ which are not dried in the oven, but are made from odds and ends of stale bread, crumbled finely or grated on a coarse grater, are better for meat or fish stuflSng, bread puddings, bread sauce, bread griddle-cakes, scalloped fish, etc. They should be used at once, as the}^ soon become musty. Any whole slices of stale bread may be steamed or used for toast.

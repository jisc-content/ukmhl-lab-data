The Boston Cook Book. 346 when using the old preparation of isinglass and gelatine. Much of the strength and flavor of jellies is lost in clearing them with eggs. Use Cox's gelatine for jellies and Nel- son's for cream. Cox's gelatine makes the clearest jelly, and the fishy taste is destroyed by the strong flavoring used in making wine, lemon, or orange jelly. Nelson's gelatine is finer, softens quicker, and has a more agree- able flavor. It is therefore better adapted to creams and delicate dishes. Never cook gelatine. Soak (not dissolve) it in cold water, in the proportion of 09ie cup of cold water to one box of gelatine. It will soften in fifteen minutes, if stirred often. Then dissolve in boiling liquid, — either water, milk, or custard, — and always strain through a fine strainer after it is dissolved. 3 tablespoonf uls sugar. Soak the gelatine in the cold water till soft, then dis- solve it in boiling water. Make a custard with the yolks of the eggs, beaten, and mixed with the sugar and salt. Pour on the hot milk, and cook in the double boiler till it thickens. Then add the strained gelatine water, the vanilla, and the whites of the eggs, beaten stifle. Mix all well, and turn into moulds wet in cold water. Place in ice water, and when hard and ready to serve turn out on a dish. Italian Cream, — Use the same proportions as in the preceding receipt. Dissolve the soaked gelatine in the hot custard instead of in hot water, and strain the whole while hot into the beaten whites. When well mixed, add lemon or vanilla^ and pour into a mould.

The heat generated for all household purposes is produced by the chemical action of the oxygen of the air upon the hy- drogen and carbon which are found in the various kinds ot wood and coal. The oxygen first combines with the car- bon and decomposes it, producing carbonic acid gas, which escapes into the air, from which it is absorbed hj plants, or by human lungs when there is no proper ventilation. The oxygen also combines with the hydrogen gas in the fuel, and this produces the flame ; the larger the amount of hydrogen in the fuel, the greater the amount of flame. Some of the products of combustion are not entirel^^ con- sumed, and pass ofif* as smoke ; some are incombustible, and remain as ashes. The intensity of a fire and the amount of heat which it produces are alwa^'s in proportion to the amount of oxygen with which it is supplied. There should be just air enough for perfect combustion. An excess of air projected upon a fire conveys away the heat, cools the fuel, and checks the combustion. The suppl}^ of air should be controlled by confining it in a limited space. Fires are usually kindled at the bottom of a flue or chim- ney. The heated air, being lighter, rises ; the colder, den- ser air rushes in to take its place, becomes heated, and ascends. Thus a continuous current is established, and a constant supply of fresh air secured. The chimney serves to carry off the smoke and poisonous products of combus- tion ; the heavier, incombustible products settle in the form of ashes. The force of this current of air drawing through the chimne}^ (a matter of great importance) is called the draught. It varies with the temperature and amount of air in the room, and the length and width of the chimney. Fuel. The materials generally used as fuel are wood, charcoal, coal, kerosene oil, and gas.

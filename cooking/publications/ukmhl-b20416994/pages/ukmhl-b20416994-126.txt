Bake on a hot, well-greased griddle ; turn when full of bubbles, and bake on the other side till they stop puffing. Use one half or one third fine corn meal or Gra- ham flour^ to make a variety. To make Huckleberry Griddle-Calces^ add one 'pint of berries^ picked over and rolled in flour. Some persons prefer to mix the sour milk with the flour, and let the mixture stand over night.

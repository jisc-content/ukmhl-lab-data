Manj^ kinds of meat which are very lean and dry are improved by the addition of some kind of fat. The tender- loin or fillet of beef, the thick part of the leg of veal, grouse, and liver, are often prepared in this waj'. Larding is drawling small strips of fat salt pork or bacon through the surface of the meat; daubing is forcing strips of pork through the entire thickness of the meat. Take a piece of fat salt pork two inches wide and four inches long. Shave off the rind the long way of the pork ; then cut two or three slices about a quarter of an inch thick, the same way as the rind ; cut only to the membrane which lies about an inch below the rind, as'this is the firmest part of the pork ; then cut each slice across the width, into strips one quarter of an inch thick. This will make the lardoons one quarter of an inch wide and thick and two inches long. Insert one end of the lardoon into the end of the larding-needle, then with the point of the needle take up a stitch half an inch deep and one inch wide in the surface of the meat. Draw the needle through, and help the pork to go through by pushing until partly through, then hold the end of the pork and draw the needle out, leaving the pork in the meat, with the ends projecting at equal lengths. Take up more stitches one inch apart in parallel or alternate rows, until the whole surface is covered. Daubing is applied to a broad, thick piece of beef or veal. Cut the pork in strips one third of an inch wide and thick, and as long as the meat is thick. Punch a hole clear through the meat with a steel, and then insert the

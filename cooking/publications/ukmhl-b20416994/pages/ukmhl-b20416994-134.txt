io8 The Boston Cook Book. OATMEAL, INDIAN CORN, AND OTHER G-RAINS USED AS FOOD. Oatmeal is highly nutritious, being richer in nitrogen than any other grain; but as it does not contain a tough, adhesive gluten, like wheat, it is not easily made into fer- mented bread. Its nitrogenous matter resembles casein more than gluten, and is called avenin (from avena^ the oat). It is used as a mush or porridge, eaten with sugar and milk. It is rich in food for muscle and brain, useful for children and laboring people, but irritating to many people whose digestive powers are weak. Groats, or Grits, are oats from which the outer husk and inner flinty cuticle are removed. Indian Corn is used in man}' forms. Some varieties which contain a large proportion of sugar, are eaten green from the cob as a vegetable. The whole grains, hulled, are eaten as samp ; broken grains of various sizes, as hominy; the ground grains, as either coarse or fine meal. Meal grows musty very quickly when ground by the old process, owing to the moisture of the corn and the heat of the stones. In the new-process, or granulated, meal the corn is first dried for two years, then ground into coarse grains like sugar. Indian corn is also used in the form of a very fine powder, called cornstarch. Corn meal, when cooked, is best made into small loaves or cakes and eaten hot. It is rich in nitrogen, and contains more fat than the other grains. This causes it to attract the oxj-gen from the air, and spoil rapidly. It should be purchased in small quantities. It is better adapted to strong labor- ing people, as it is very heating for persons with weak digestion.

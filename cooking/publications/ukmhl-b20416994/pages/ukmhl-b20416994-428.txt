402 The Boston Cook Book* each jar of small juicy berries^ and one cup of sugar and two cups of water for pears and large fruits. Pour the syrup boiling hot into the hot jars, boil five minutes, and seal at once. Strawberries^ plums^ and cherries will require more sugar. Cherries should be stoned, but the stones may be used if liked. Quinces^ apples^ hard peaches^ pears^ and fruits which require softening, should be cooked in water or in syrup until tender. Then fill the jars with boiling syrup, strain- ing it if not clear. Peaches may be canned whole, or if halved, a few of the pits removed and cooked in the syrup to give addi- tional flavor.

The best quality of thick tin-foil may be used as a cover for an}" large-mouthed bottle or jar minus a cover. Fill the jar with the fruit and syrup, cover with a large piece of tin-foil, work it down over the rim until perfectly smooth and tight. If air-tight, there will be a depression in the cover as soon as the fruit is cold. Fruit thus covered should be kept away from mice, as they will eat the tin- foil. Canned fruit should be opened some time before using, that it may be aerated and the flavor improved. There has been a strong feeling against the use of fruit prepared in tin cans. Chemists have examined canned fruit as soon as opened, and found it harmless ; but if the fruit be left

The Boston Cook Book, 209 Eggs in a Nest. Boil six eggs twenty minutes. Remove the shells. Separate the yolks without breaking; or rub them to a smooth paste with a little olive oil to moisten, and shape into small balls. Cut the whites in thin narrow slices, and mix with them an equal quantit}^ of fine shredded chicken^ ham^ or salmon^ and a tahlespoonful of fine sprigs of parsley. Pile this mixture, which should be light and dry, on a platter in a circular or oval ring, and put the yolks in the centre. Set the platter in a steamer, to heat the mixture. Make a pint of thick white sauce ; pour enough of it round the edge of the dish to come half-way up the nest, and serve the remainder in a sauce-boat. The same materials may be served cold as Devilled JEggs. Mix a little cayenne pepper and made mustard with the yolks and also with the shredded meat; add a sprink- ling of vinegar^ and garnish the dish with parsley or water- cresses. Or serve as a salad, garnished with cresses or lettuce^ and sprinkle a French dressing over the whole. Egg Salad may be served in this form. Cut the yolks in dice, and mix them lightly with diced chicken, salmon, fish, or lobster; fill the white cups heaping with the mixture, and serve on a bed of lettuce or cresses, with French or Mayonnaise dressing. 14

2/6 The Boston Cook Book. venient way of using pieces of veal that would not other- wise be utilized. Veal Loaf. Parboil two pounds of lean veal. Chop fine with dne fourth of a pound of salt pork or bacon ; add four butter crackers^ pounded, two eggs^ well beaten, two teaspoonfuls of salt^ one saltspoonful of pepper^ and half a saltspoonful of nutmeg or mace. Moisten with the meat liquor, mould into an oval loaf, and put into a shallow tin pan. Add a little of the water in which the meat was boiled. Bake till quite brown, basting often. Serve hot or cold, cut in slices. Raw veal maj^ be used in the same w^ay, baking it two hours or more. No. 2, â€” Select a hnuckle of veal^ or 2i\\y hony piece that has a large proportion of gelatine. Cut in small pieces, and remove any fragments of bone. Cover with cold water., boil quickly, skim, and add one onion., one teaspoonfid of salt, and one saltspoonful of pepper. Let it simmer till the meat slips from the bones, the gristly portions are dissolved, and the liquor reduced to one cupful. Eemove the meat, pick out all the bones, strain the liquor, and season highW with salt^ lemon juice., Siud pepper^ and slightly with sage or thyme. Chop or pick the meat apart; add two or three tahlespoonfuls of powdered cracker and the meat liquor ; mix well and put into a bread pan. Put it in a cool place, and when hard serve in thin slices. The gelatine in the meat liquor will harden, and hold the meat together without pressure. Meat Souffle. Make one cup of cream sauce, and season with chopped parsley and onion juice. Stir one cup of chopped meat (chicken, fresh tongue, veal, or lamb) into the sauce. When hot, add the beaten yolks of two eggs; cook one min- ute, and set away to cool. When cool, stir in the whites, beaten stiff. Bake in a buttered dish about twenty min- utes, and serve immediately. If for lunch, serve with a' mushroom sauce.

232 The Boston Cooh Book. MUTTON AND LAMB. Mutton stands next to beef in nutritive qualities, and with many lias even more value as food, because more easily digested. In mutton about one half the weiglit is in fat, while with beef it is only one third. The choicest mutton comes from the mountainous re- gions of Penns3^1vania, Virginia, and North Carolina. Good mutton should be large and heavy, the fat clear white and very hard, the flesh fine-grained and bright red. Poor mutton has but little fat, and little flesh as compared with the bone. Mutton is cut at the market by splitting down the back, and dividing at the loin into the hind and fore quarters; or the hind and fore quarters are separated without split- ting, and the loin is taken out whole and sold as the sad- dle of mutton.

The pink skin above the fat should always be removed from chops, and wherever it is pos-

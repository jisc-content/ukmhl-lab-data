179 The Boston Cook Book. Sauted Oysters.—Prepare as for frying, and brown on each side in hot butter; or roll in the cracker only, and brown them. Oysters in Fritter Batter.^ see page 107. Broiled Oysters, — Pick over, and drain large oysters. Dip in melted butter., then in fine cracker crumbs seasoned with salt and pepper.

Rinse each clam in a little of the clam water, and if very large, cut the tough part into small pieces. When the water is clear, pour it into a saucepan, add the clams, and heat again till just hot, but

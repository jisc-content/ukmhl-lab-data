144 The Boston Cook Book. White Soup (from Chicken). 3 or 4 pounds fowl. 3 quarts cold water. 1 tablespoonful salt. 6 peppercorns. 1 tablespoonful chopped onion. 2 tablespoonfuls chopped celery. 1 pint cream. 1 tablespoonful butter. 1 tablespoonful cornstarch. 1 ieaspoonful salt. 1 saltspoonful white pepper. 2 eggs. Singe, clean, and wipe the fowl. Cut off the legs and wings, and disjoint the body. Put it on to boil in cold water. Let it come to a boil quickly^ because we wish to use the meat as well as the water, and skim thoroughly. The meat may be removed when tender, and the bones put on to boil again. (Use the meat for croquettes or other made dishes.) Add the salt and vegetables. Simmer until reduced one half. Strain, and when cool remove the fat. For one quart of stock allow one pint of cream or milk. If cream, use a little less flour for thickening. Boil the stock; add the butter and flour, cooked together, and the seasoning. Strain it over the eggs, stirring as 3^ou pour, or the eggs will curdle. By substituting, for the eggs in this white soup, the white meat of the chicken, chopped fine and rubbed to a powder, we have Potage a la Reine^ which many think too elaborate for any but a professional cook to undertake. The breast of a roast chicken may be used. Add it to the boiling stock, then thicken it with the flour and butter. Add the cream, and if not perfectly smooth, strain into the tureen. It should be quite thick like cream. Whole rice is sometimes served with clear chicken soup. If used as a thickening, boil the rice until soft enough to rub through a strainer. Add it to the chicken liquor, and unite them with butter and flour cooked together. The liquor in which a fowl or chicken has been boiled, when not wanted for any other purpose, should be saved for white soup. If the vegetables and spices are not boiled with the fowl, fvy them five minutes without burn- ing, add them to the stock, and simmer fifteen minutes.

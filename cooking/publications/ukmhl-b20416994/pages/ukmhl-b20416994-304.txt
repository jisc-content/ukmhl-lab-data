To Shape a Croquette, â€” Croquettes may be shaped into rolls, or ovals, or like pears, with a bit of parsley or a clove in the end to represent the stem. Take a taUespoon- ful of the cold mixture^ and shape into a smooth ball. If the mixture stick, wet the palms of the hands slightly. Give the ball a gentle, rolUng pressure between the palms till shghtly cylindrical; then roll it lightly in the crumbs, clasp it gently in the hand, and flatten one end on the board. Turn the hand over, and flatten the opposite end. Place the croquette on a broad knife, and roll it in beaten egg. With a spoon dip the egg over the croquette, drain on the knife, and roll again in the crumbs. Fry in deep hot fat (see page 15). Drain on paper. In rolling any kind of croquettes, if the mixture be too soft to be handled easily, stir in enough fine cracker dust to stiffen it, but never add an}- uncooked material like flour, nor the dried bread crumbs used in rolling, as those will make the croquettes too stiff. Thick Cream Sauce (for Croquettes and Patties). 1 pint hot cream. 3^ teaspoonful salt. 2 even tablespoonfuls butter. saltspoonful white pepper. 4 heaping tablespoonfuls flour, or 3^ teaspoonful celery salt. 2 heaping tablesp. cornstarch. A few grains of cayenne. Scald the cream. Melt the butter in a granite sauce- pan. When bubbling, add the dry cornstarch. Stir till well mixed. Add one third of the cream, and stir as it boils and thickens. Add more cream, and boil again. When perfectl}' smooth, add the remainder of the cream. The sauce should be very thick, almost like a drop batter. Add the seasoning, and mix it while hot with the meat or flsh. For croquettes, one beaten egg may be added just as the sauce is taken from the fire ; but the croquettes are whiter and more creamy without the egg. For patties, warm the meat or fish in the sauce, and use the egg or not as you please.

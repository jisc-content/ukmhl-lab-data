The Boston Cook Book. 367 Bomhe Glace. — Line a mould or the freezer with one quart of raspberry or pomegranate sherbet. Pack the sherbet round the bottom and sides of the mould one inch deep. Fill the centre with Bavarian cream^ or Charlotte Busse cream, or Creme Diplomate, Cover with the sher- bet, and pack in ice and salt one hour. Biscuit Glace, — Ice-cream and sherbet are often served in small, fanc}' paper cases, which may be obtained at a confectioner's. Make and freeze the cream, and fill the paper cases with two kinds, either sherbet and plain ice- cream, or sherbet and tutti frutti, or Charlotte Russe cream and sherbet, or ice-cream. Pack the cases in a freezer, and keep on ice and salt till ver^^ hard. Serve on a lace paper napkin laid on a fancj^ plate. Sometimes the bis- cuits are covered with a meringue, and colored shghtly with a salamander just before serving. Frozen Apricots. — Cut one can of apricots into small pieces, add one pint of sugar and one quart of water. When the sugar is dissolved, freeze. When parth^ frozen add, if you like, one pint of whipped cream^ measured after whipping. This is delicious without the cream. Peaches, pineapples, cherries, and strawberries are deli- cious when frozen. Vary the amount of sugar as the fruit requires. Sherbets, or Water Ices. Sherbets, or water ices, are made with the juice of fruit, water, and sugar. With a supply of canned fruit, or fruit syrup always at hand, a variety of delicious desserts may be quickl}' prepared. A tablespoonful of gelatine., soaked and dissolved, gives a light and smooth consistency to water ices. Many prefer to boil the water and sugar to a clear S3'rup, remove the scum, and when cool add the fruit juice ; and others use the white of egg beaten stiff, add- ing it after the sherbet is partly frozen. The following are some of the most delicious water ices. Follow the directions given under Orange Sherbet, for all the other varieties. •

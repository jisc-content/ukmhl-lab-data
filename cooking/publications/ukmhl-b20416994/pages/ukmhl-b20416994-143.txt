117 The Boston Cook Book, like a large, thick cucumber, and contains from six to thirt}^ beans. The beans are roasted, like coffee. The husks or shells are taken off, and used in that form as cocoa shells. The}' need longer boiling, and are preferred by many persons with weak digestion. They are some- times ground with the bean, making an inferior article of cocoa. Starch is also used to adulterate cocoa. The best cocoa is made from the whole bean after the husk is re- moved. Cocoa nibs are the beans broken instead of ground. Chocolate is the finely ground powder from the kernels mixed to a stiff paste with sugar, and sometimes flavored with vanilla. It is the most nutritious and convenient form of cocoa; a small cake of it will satisfy hunger. It is a very good lunch for travellers. If the oily scum which forms on the surface after boiling be removed, it is less indigestible. Chocolate does not produce the injurious effects which render tea and coffee objectionable, and is far better for children and working-people. Cocoa. Put half a cup of broken cocoa into a pot with two quarts of water. Boil gently two hours, until reduced to one quart; or use half cocoa and half shells. Serve with sugar and cream., or scalded milk. It is more digestible if allowed to cool and the globules of fat removed, then reheated. Prepared Cocoa. This ground cocoa comes in many forms, and some are recommended to be prepared at the table ; but all kinds are better boiled one minute in a very little water, the same as chocolate, and thinned with hot milk. Shells. Steep one cup of shells in one quart of boiling water three or four hours, adding more hot water as it boils awa}-. Strain, and serve with hot milk, or cream and sugar.

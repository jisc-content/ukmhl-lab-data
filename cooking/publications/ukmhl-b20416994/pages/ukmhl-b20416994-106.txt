The Boston Cook Book, 8o SODA BISCUIT, MUFFINS, GEMS, ETC. The soda now used in cooking is the bicarbonate of soda, â€” an alkali made from the ashes of marine plants, or, more recently, from sea salt. Crude soda is known as sal- soda^ or soda-saleratus ; when refined and cleared of its im- purities, it is carbonate and bicarbonate of soda, the latter having twice as much carbonic acid gas as the carbonate. Potash is another fixed alkali made from wood ashes. Pearlash is purified potash. Saleratus is prepared from pearlash by exposing it to carbonic acid gas. Pure, strong alkalies are powerful corrosive poisons, eating the coats of the stomach perhaps quicker than any other poisonous agent. This caustic or burning propert}^ is somewhat weakened by the carbonic acid united with them, and is therefore less in bicarbonate of soda than in the potash compounds. The latter are now seldom used. Alkalies when properl}^ combined with acids lose this poi- sonous property; the carbonic acid gas is liberated, and the compound formed b}^ this union is called a neutral salt, being neither acid nor alkaline. When not properly com- bined, if the acid be stronger than the alkali, the salt is acid ; and if the alkali be in excess, the salt is alkaline and still poisonous. Soda has a great affinit}^ for water; and when wet, a combination takes place which allows some of the carbonic acid gas to escape. This ma}^ easily be seen by the effer- vescence which occurs when soda is dissolved in hot water. This, the old way of using soda, was theoretically wrong, as much of the gas was lost; yet practically good results were obtained, because the saleratus formerly used was much stronger than the bicarbonate of soda of to-day, and could well be weakened.

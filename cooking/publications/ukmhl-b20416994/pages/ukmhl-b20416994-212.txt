The intestines are used with the meat in winter, when the turtle is in a torpid condition ; but in the summer the}' should be thrown away. Boil the intestines hy themselves one hour. This should be pre- pared the day before. Heat the meat in the gravy. To each terrapin add one wineglassful of cream^ half a cup of butter, a little salt^ cayenne^ and one wineglassful of sherry. Use the turtle eggs if there be any; if not, the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs to each terrapin. Rub smooth, mixing with raw yolk enough to make into balls the size of tur- tle eggs. Add these and the wine just as 3'ou send the dish to the table. Green Turtle Soup. The green turtle is highly prized on account of the deli- cious quality of its flesh; but as it is very large and ex- pensive the canned turtle is more generally used. One can of green turtle^ one quart of brown stock, two tablespoonfuls each of butter and flour, one lemon. Cut the green fat into dice and lay it aside. Simmer the remain- der of the turtle meat in the stock for half an hour. Brown the flour in the browned butter, add it to the soup, season highly with salt and pepper. Serve with thin slices of lemon, egg balls, and the reserved green fat.

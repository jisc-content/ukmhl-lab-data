For this reason the^^ should be covered with cold water as soon as peeled. New potatoes are watery, as the starch is not fully formed. They have a very thin skin, which may be rubbed or scraped off. Raw potatoes which are to be fried should be thinly sliced, and soaked in cold water to draw^ out all the starch, that the}' may be crisp and not meal}'. The cells which hold the starch grains are of an albuminous nature. These cells are divided in slicing the potatoes, and the starch is drawn out into the water; the albuminous mem- brane hardens in frying, and makes the potatoes crisp. Boiled potatoes should be drained the moment the heat bursts all the starch grains, which may easily be determined by their soft texture when pierced with a fork, else the starch will absorb water, and the potatoes become pasty and unwholesome. Baked potatoes should be served as soon as soft, and the skin should be slightly ruptured by squeezing to let the steam within escape, else it will condense and make the potato watery and unwholesome. Potatoes which are cut or sliced for stews and chowders should be soaked and scalded to remove the greenness before adding them to the stew. Boiled Potatoes, — Select potatoes of uniform size. Wash and scrub with a brush. Pare, and soak in cold water. Put them in boiling salted water, — one quart of water and one tahlespoonful of salt for six large potatoes. Cook half an hour or until soft, but not until broken. Drain off every drop of the water. Place the kettle un- covered on the back of the stove to let the steam escape. Keep hot until ready to serve. Potatoes a la Neige, — Prepare the potatoes as above, and when well drained and mealy beat them thoroughly with a fork, add salt to taste, and serve at once, piled lightly on the dish. Rice Potato, — Rub the beaten potato through a squash

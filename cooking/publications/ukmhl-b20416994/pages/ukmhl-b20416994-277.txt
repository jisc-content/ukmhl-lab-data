The Boston Cook Booh. 251 POULTRY AND GAME. The flesh of poultiy and of game birds has less red blood than the flesh of animals ; but as it abounds in phos- phates, it is valuable food, particularly for invalids. The flesh is drier, and not marbled with fat as in that of quad- rupeds. All game has a strong odor and flavor, which is by some mistaken for that of tainted meat. It should be kept till tender, but no longer, unless frozen. White-fleshed game should be cooked till well done; that with dark flesh may be served underdone. The breast of all birds is the most juicy and nutritious part. '' The wing of a walker and the leg of a flier are consid- ered choice tidbits." To Choose Poultry and Game. â€” The best chickens have soft yellow feet, short thick legs, smooth moist skin, plump breast; and the cartilage on the end of the breast bone is soft and pliable. This is sometimes broken in fowls to deceive purchasers; but the difference between a broken bone, that slips when moved, and a soft yielding cartilage may be very easily detected. Pin feathers always indicate a young bird ; and long hairs, an older one. The bodies of capons are very plump and fat, and larger in proportion than those of fowls or chickens. The meat is of finer flavor. Old fowls have long thin necks and feet, and sharp scales ; the flesh has a purplish tinge, and they usually have a large amount of fat. The best turkeys have smooth black legs, with soft, loose spurs, full breasts, and white plump flesh. Geese and ducks should be young, not more than a year old, have white soft fat, yellow feet, and tender wings, and be thick and hard on the breast. The windpipe

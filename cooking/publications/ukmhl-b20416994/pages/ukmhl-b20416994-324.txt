The fresh pods are sweet, and full of flavor. Wash the pods before shelling, then the peas will require no washing. Put the peas into a colander, and sift out the fine particles. Boil the pods ten minutes, skim them out, and add the peas. Boil fifteen minutes, or till tender. When nearl}^ done, add the salt. Let the w^ater boil nearly away, and serve without draining, except when the peas are to be served as a garnish. Season with butter^ cream^ salt, and a little sugar. Old peas should be cooked until tender, drained, mashed, and rubbed through a sieve, and served a^^ a vegetable or made into a puree. Peas are nutritious, but they are indigestible unless the hull be broken before they are swallowed. Beans. String Beans. — Eemove the strings. The surest way to do that is to pare a thin strip from each edge of the pods. Many persons think this unnecessar}'; but the beans are much more delicate, and two or three strings are enough to spoil the whole dish. Lay a handful of the pods on a board with the ends even, and cut them all at once into inch pieces. Wash, and cook in boiling salted water from one to three hours, the time var3dng with different vari- eties of beans. Drain ; season with butter, salt, and cream, and serve hot, or serve cold as a salad. When ver}^ young and tender, they may be cooked in just water enough to keep them from burning. Shelled Beans. — Wash, and cook in boiling water ; al- wa3's use soft water. Add salt after ten minutes, and boil until tender. Let the water boil nearly awa}', and serve without draining. Season with butter and salt. Lima beans and other white varieties are improved by adding a little hot cream.

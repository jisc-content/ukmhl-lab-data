Cut the celery into thin slices, the turnip into quarter- inch dice, and the carrot into three-quarters by one- eighth inch strips or straws, using only the orange part. Or cut carrot and turnip into quarter-inch slices, and then into fancy shapes with small vegetable cutters. Cover with boiling water, add half a teaspoonful of salt, and cook until soft, but not long enough to destro}^ their shapes. Let the quart of stock come to a boil; add the vegetables, the water, and more salt if necessary. Serve hot. In spring and summer use asparagus, peas, and string beans.

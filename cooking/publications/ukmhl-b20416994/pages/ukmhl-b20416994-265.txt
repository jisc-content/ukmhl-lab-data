The Boston Cook Book. 239 VEAL. Veal is always in the market, but is better in the spring. The fat should be white and clear; and the lean, pink or flesh color. If the flesh be white, the calf has been bled before being killed, and the meat is unfit to eat. Veal contains less nitrogen, but more gelatine, than beef. It has very little flavor, and needs to be highl}^ seasoned to make it even palatable. Veal stands lowest among heat-producing meats, and should be eaten with potatoes or rice, which stand highest, or with bacon and jell}^, which furnish in their fat and sugar the carbon wanting in the flesh. It should alwa^'s be thoroughly cooked, as under- done veal is not wholesome. At its lowest price veal is never a cheap food when wx take into consideration the small amount of nutriment it contains, the large amount of fuel required to cook it, and the danger of being made ill by its use. The lower part of the leg or knuckle and all the gristly portions are used for soups. Cutlets, or steaks, the fillet, fricandeau, or cushion, are cut from the thickest part of the leg. The loin is used for chops or roasts, the breast for roasts,' and the neck for stews and soups. Calf s head and pluck includes the lights, heart, and liver. The head is used for soup, the heart and liver for braising. The lights are now seldom used.. Hoast Veal. The loin, breast, and fillet (a thick piece from the upper part of the leg) are the best pieces for roasting. The bone should be removed from the fillet, and the cavity filled with a highly seasoned and very 7noist stuffing. Tie or skewer into a round shape. Dredge with salt,, pepper^

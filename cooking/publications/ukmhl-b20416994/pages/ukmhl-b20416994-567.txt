(7) DEERFOOT FARM. The products oÂ£ this well-known farm are justly celebrated, not only for their quality (which is the best that can be produced, from carefully selected stock, with the experience, and under the personal supervision, of its proj^rietor), but also for absolute purity and the neat form in which they are put up. The DAIRY PRODUCTS consist of rich Milk, a very thick sweet Cream and Butter, freshly made every day. The PORK PRODUCTS, which are entirely from young pigs, fed on corn and skim milk, are sugar-cured Hams, lightly salted ; dry-cured Bacon, equal to the best imported; Leaf Lard; Salt Pork, in small.kegs; Pigs'Feet, in hermetically sealed cans; and, during the winter season, the famous " Little Sausages " and loins of Pork for chops and roasting. Patrons are always sure of a ft-esh supply at the store, 59 Bromfield Street, where the goods are received daily. BURNETTS FLAVORING EXTRACTS are pure and of great strength. HOUSEKEEPERS who study their interests will demand of their grocers BURNETT'S FLAVORING EXTRACTS, and will find them the most economical as well as the most delicious of flavors. THE SUPERIORITY OF THESE EXTRACTS CONSISTS IN THEIR PERFECT PURITY AND GREAT STRENGTH. They are warranted free from the poisonous oils and acids which enter into the composition of many of the factitious fruit flavors now in the market. They are not only true to their names, but are prepared from fruit of the best quality, and are so highly concentrated that a comparatively small quantity only need be used. ENDORSED BY MRS.

The Boston Cooh Book. 201 omelet pan. When hot, rub it round the edge with a teaspoonfiil of butter on a broad knife ; let the butter run all over the pan and when bubbling turn in the omelet quickl}' and spread it evenly on the pan. Lift the pan from the hottest part of the fire and cook carefuUj^, until slightly browned underneath; slip the knife under to keep it from burning in the middle. Put it on the oven grate to dry (not brown) the top. When the whole centre is dry as you cut into it, run a knife round the edge, then under the half nearest the handle, and fold over to the right. Hold the edge of a hot platter against the lower edge of the pan, and in- vert the omelet upon the platter. Or add only half of the beaten whites to the 3^olks, and when nearly cooked spread the remainder over the top ; let it heat through ; fold over, and the white will burst out round the edge like a border of foam, making a foam omelet^ or any fancy name you may choose to give it. If 3'ou have no omelet pan, or no convenience for dry- ing the omelet in the oven, use a smooth iron spider or frying-pan with a tin cover, and double the quantities given. Heat the pan and the cover very hot. Butter the pan, turn in the mixture, cover it, and place on the back of the stove for five minutes, or till firm. Fold as usual. Omelets should be only slightly browned, never burned, as the flavor of scorched egg is not'-agreeable. One tahlespoonful of chopped parsley^ or a teaspoonful of fine grated onion ^ or two or three tablespoonfuls of grated sweet corn may be added to the yolks before cooking. Thin slices of cold ham^ or three spoonfuls of chopped ham^ veal^ or chicken; stewed tomatoes or raw tomatoes sliced; chopped mushrooms^ shrimps^ oysters which have been par- boiled and drained ; cooked clams^ chopped fine ; or grated

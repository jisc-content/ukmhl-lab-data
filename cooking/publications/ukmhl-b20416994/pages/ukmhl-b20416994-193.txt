A very good way of boiling fish is to steep it for five minutes in strongly salted boiling water, with one or. two tablespponfuls of lemon juice, then plunge it into fresh boiling water without salt, and simmer till done. Less scum rises in the fresh water, and the fish looks whiter. Allow about six minutes to a pound for boiling ; more if in a cubical form than for a thin narrow piece of the same weight.

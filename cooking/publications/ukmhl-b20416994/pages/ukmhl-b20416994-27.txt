1 THE BOSTON COOK BOOK. COOKERY Cookery is the art of preparing food for the nourish- ment of the human bod}^ When given its proper impor- tance in the consideration of health and comfort, it must be based upon scientific principles of hygiene and what the French call the minor moralities of the household. All civiHzed nations cook their food, to improve its taste and digestibiUty. The degree of civilization is often measured by the cuisine. Cooking (from the Latin coquo^ to boil, bake, heat, dr}', scorch, or ripen) is usuall}' done by the direct application of heat. Fruits and some vegetables which are eaten in a natural state have reallj^ been cooked or ripened by the heat of the sun. Milk and eggs, which are types of per- fect food, would be useless as food unless they came from the warm living animal. Fish, flesh, and fruits which have been dried in the sun or smoked, and are often eaten without any further preparation, have undergone a certain process of natural cooking. Heat seems to create new flavors, and to change the odor, taste, and digestibility of nearly all articles of food. It swells and bursts the starch cells in flour, rice, and potatoes ; hardens the albumen in eggs, fish, and meat; softens the fibrous substances in tough meats, hard vege- tables and fruits. It develops new flavors in tea, coffee, roasted meat, crusts of bread, baked beans, etc.

The Boston Cook Booh 8s When they are well puffed up, put a bit of butter on the top of each, and turn over, â€”or move them to one side and grease again with the pork, and turn over upon the freshly greased place. When browned on the other side and done, of which you can judge by the firmness of texture or by pulling one partly open, serve immediately. Tear them open, as cutting with a knife makes them heavy and indigestible. If to be baked in the oven, put them quite close together in a shallow pan, and bake ten or fifteen minutes. Short Cakes, No. 2. Make by rule No. 1, and divide into two parts ; pat and roll each part into a large, round cake the size of a pie plate, and bake either in a spider or in the oven. These short cakes may be eaten hot with butter if for a simple breakfast or tea cake, or buttered and spread with sweet- ened fruit for dessert. Strawberry Short Cake, ISTo. 1. Make a crust by rule for Dutch Apple Cake, on page 86 ; bake it on round tins ; split, butter, and spread with sweet- ened berries and cream. Strawberry Short Cake, No. 2. Make by rule No. 1 for Short Cake, and bake on a grid- dle in small rounds. Tear open, and spread each half with softened butter. Put half of the cakes on a hot plate. Mash a pint of strawberries, sweeten to taste, put a large spoonful on each cake; then put another layer of cakes, and whole berries, well sugared. Serve with cream. Peach Short Cake. Make by either of the receipts for Strawberry Short Cake, and spread with sliced and sweetened peaches. Apricots may be used in the same way; and cream may be added if preferred.

The Boston Cook Book, 359 with a few drops of the liquid jelly, and when hard add jelh' to cover the fruit. When this is hard, place a smaller mould in the centre on the jelly and fill with ice. Pour the remainder of the jellj' between the two moulds, adding it slowly, and dropping in fruit here and there, if you clioose, until the mould is full. When the jelly is all firm, remove the ice, and add warm^ not hot^ w^ater to the smaller mould, and take it out carefull}', without breaking the wall of jelly.

Place the puff* paste on a plate, and spread with raspberry jam or orange mar- malade. Lay the border of cream cake paste on the edge, and press it into the marmalade. Fill the centre with any

303 The Boston Cook Book. Egg Plant Fritters. (Adaline Miller.) — Put the egg plant whole into boiling salted water, mixed with one tablespoonful of vinegar or lemon juice; cook twenty minutes or until tender ; mash and drain. To one pint of egg plant add half a cup flour^ two eggs., well beaten, and salt and pepper to taste. Fr}^ in small cakes in hot fat^ browning well on both sides. Artichokes. The Jerusalem Artichoke is a tuber, something like the potato ; but as it contains no starch, it is not meal}'. Peel and throw at once into cold water and vinegar to preserve the color. Cook in boiling salted water until tender, watch closely, and take them out as they become soft, for if left in longer they will harden again. Serve with a white sauce. Jerusalem artichokes ma}^ be used as a salad, or they may be pickled. Globe Artichokes. — These are thick, fleshy-petalled flowers which grow on a plant that resembles the thistle. The thickened receptacle and scales of the involucre form the edible portion. Soak the artichokes, cut off the out- side leaves, trim away the lower leaves and the ends of the others. Cook in boiling salted water, with the tops downward, half an hour, or until the leaves can be drawn out. Drain, remove the choke, and serve with dravm butter. Mushrooms. Peel the top and stalk, break in small pieces, place them in a stewpan, sprinkle slightly with salt and pepper, and let them stand half an hour, until the juice is drawn out. Stew the mushrooms in the juice aiid a little butter until tender, add cream to cover, and when the cream is hot serve on toast. Mushrooms are considered difficult of digestion. They are a fungous grow^th, and have a woody odor and a meaty flavor. They are used largely in sauces. Unless familiar with the difference between the edible and the poisonous mushrooms, it is safer to use the canned mushrooms, or to obtain the fresh at a reliable market.

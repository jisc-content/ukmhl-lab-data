Shape into small balls; then roll into sticks a foot long. Let them rise slowl}^ and bake in a moderate oven, that they may be dried through before browning. When shaped into large plain rolls, they are called White Mountain Rolls. Rolls designed for breakfast or dinner are better not to be sweetened enough to taste sweet; but for tea or lunch more sugar may be added. This brings us to another vari- ety of rolls which are made richer by the addition of but- ter, sugar, eggs, and fruit, including Swedish Rolls^ Rusks, and Bunns, 1 scant teaspoonful salt. Melt the butter, and dissolve the sugar and salt in the hot milk ; w^hen lukewarm, add the yeast and beaten whites. Mix in flour to make a sponge or drop batter. In the morning add the remainder of the flour, and knead twenty minutes. Let it rise till noon or till light; then knead again slightl}^, and roll out into a large, rectangular piece, half an inch thick. Have the edges as straight as possi- ble. Spread all over with a thin layer of soft butter, and a sprinkling of sugar, cinnamon, grated lemon rind, and currants. Roll up like a jelly roll, cut ofl* slices an inch wide, lay them with the cut side dow^n on well-greased pans, and when well risen bake in a hot oven fifteen or twenty minutes. When done, glaze them w^ith sugar dis- solved in milk, and dry them a few minutes in the oven, or rub them with soft butter. If mixed in the morning, make a sponge with the scalded milk cooled, the eggs, salt, sugar, and part of the flour. Place the bowl in a pan of warm water for three or four hours ; then add the butter and the remainder of the flour. Knead, and after it is well risen roll out as above.

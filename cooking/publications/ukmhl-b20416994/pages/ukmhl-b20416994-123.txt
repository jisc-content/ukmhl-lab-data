97 The Boston Cook Book, Gluten Wafers. Half a cup of sweet cream and one saltspoonful of salt. Stir in gluten enough to make a stiff dough. Knead and roll out YQYy thin. Cut into rounds, and bake a delicate brown on an ungreased tin. Gluten is a preparation of wheat flour without the starch. Waffles, Griddle-Cakes, Pancakes, etc. The names pancakes, fritters, flap-jacks, slap-jacks, batter-cakes, griddle-cakes, slappers, etc., are applied in- discriminately in different localities. Pancakes were formerly a kind of muffin mixture, made a little stiffer than a drop batter, but not stiff enough to roll out, and were dropped from a spoon into hot fat, and fried like doughnuts. But, recently, the name has been applied to a very thin batter made usually without soda, cooked one cake at a time on a small well-buttered frying- pan, and turned like a griddle-cake; then buttered, and rolled over and over, or spread with sugar and jelly, and then rolled. In ''ye oklen time" good cooks were sup- posed to have the knack of tossing the pan so skilfully that the cake would turn over itself; but this is now one of the lost arts. For convenience and clearness, the following names will be used in this work : â€” Griddle-Cakes: any kind of small, thin batter-cakes cooked on a griddle. Pancakes: larger, thin batter-cakes, made without soda, and cooked in a small fr3'ing-pan. French or Rolled Pancakes: the same as the preceding, buttered, sweetened, and rolled. Fried Drop Cakes or Fried Muffins: any muffin mixture, dropped from a spoon into deep hot fat. Fritters: a thinner mixture made without soda, either plain or with meat, fish, or fruit, and cooked by dropping into deep hot fat. * 7

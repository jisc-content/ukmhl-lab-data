A PREFACE NOT FOR THE PUBLIC. A WORD of grateful acknowledgment is due the many friends who have aided in this work. First, to m}' mother I owe much for her excellent judg- ment in training me as a child to a love for all house- hold work. Although it was often hard to " help mother " when other children were at play, the knowledge thus gained has proved invaluable. Every j^ear's experience in teaching has made me prize more and more this early training. Also, I am deeply indebted to Miss M. S. Devereux for the illustrations of this book. In all my work I have been greatly aided by her suggestions and generous sj^mpathy. And, lastly, I would not forget my obligations to a large circle of personal friends. Especially would I remember the one who, twenty years ago, aided me in making my first loaf of bread, and the many among my pupils who, out of their varied experience, have contributed much that has proved helpful.

Boiled Dressing for Cold Slaio, â€” Boil half a cup of vinegar with two teaspoonfuls of sugar^ half a teaspoon- ful each of salt and mustard^ and half a saltspoonful of pepper. Rub a quarter of a cup of butter to a cream, with one teaspoonful of flom\ and pour the boiling vinegar on it. Cook five minutes, then pour it over one well-heaten egg. The yolk only may be used, and the white saved for clearing coffee. Mix this dressing, while hot, with one pint of red cabbage^ shaved or chopped, or w^th a mixed vegetable salad. Cold slaw is delicious served wdth fried oysters or fish. Mix the first four ingredients in a small bowl. Add the eggs. Stir well with a small wooden spoon. Add the oil, a few drops at a time, stirring until it thickens. If hy chance you. add too much oil, do not attempt to stir it all in at once, but take it up gradually. When the dress- ing is thick, thin it with a little lemon, then add oil and lemon alternately, and lastl^^ the vinegar. When ready to serve, add half a cup of lohipped cream^ if you like. The cream makes it whiter and thinner. The oil should thicken the egg almost immediately, and the mixture should be thick enough to be taken up in a ball on the spoon, before adding the vinegar. Should the egg not thicken quickly, and have a curdled appearance, half a teaspoorful of the unbeaten white of egg or a few drops of vinegar will often restore the smooth consistenc3\ Be careful not to use too much, as it will make the dressing thin. The dressing liquefies as soon as mixed with vege- tables or meat; therefore it should be made stiff enough to keep in shape until used. Many prefer to use a Dover Mayonnaise Dressing. 1 teaspoonful mustard. 1 teaspoonful powdered sugar. % teaspoonful salt, saltspoonful cayenne.

The Boston Cook Book. 34 the whites. Let the whites stand a minute, then run a palette knife round the edge close to the bowl; they will slip out easil}^, and leave the bowl almost clean. For beating eggs, for nearly all purposes the Dover egg-beater is the best. There should be two sizes, the larger one for the whites of eggs. Hold the beater lightly in the left hand, and move it round through the egg while turning the handle. For frosting, and snow pudding, and all beat- ing of soft dough, use a perforated wooden spoon. Bowls with slightly flaring sides, and not too deep to be clasped from bottom to rim in the left hand, are most convenient. If tipped slightly toward the right, the beating is done more effectually. Cutting^ or Folding, or Lifting, â€” Omelets, sponge cake, whipped cream, etc., should have the beaten white cut or folded in carefully to avoid breaking the air bubbles. Turn the mixture over with the spoon, cut through, lift up, and fold the materials together, lifting the part from below, up and over, and mixing very gently until just blended. Do not stir round and round, nor beat quickly. All mixtures which are raised with eggs alone, should have the j^olks and whites of the eggs thoroughly and separately beaten; any very thin batter, like pop-overs, pancakes, or gems made without eggs, should be beaten vigorously just before baking. Graham or whole-wheat flour is better than white flour for gems that are made without eggs, because it contains more gluten. Shall we stir only one way? No; stir any way 3'ou please, so long as you blend or mix the materials. But after heating in air bubbles, don't break them by stirring^ unless 3^ou wish to keep up the game of cross purposes indefinitely. Always let the last motion, before turning into the pans, be one of quick, vigorous heating; except in those receipts where folding instead of beating is indicated.

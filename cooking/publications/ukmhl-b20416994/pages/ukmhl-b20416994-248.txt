222 The Boston Cook Booh When no water is used in baking and the oven is ver}^ hot, this liquid will be the fat from the meat. The brown flour will settle, and some will adhere to the pan. Pour one pint of hot water or stock into the pan, and scrape off all the sedi- ment. Pour this water into a saucepan from which it may be poured easily, and place it on the stove to heat. Put four tahlespoonfuls of the hot fat into a small frying-pan, and when browned stir in two heaping tahlespoonfuls of dry flour^ or enough to absorb all the fat. Stir until the flour is brown and well mixed ; then add the hot liquid grad- ually, and stir as it thickens. Season with salt and pepper^ and simmer five minutes. Strain if not perfectly smooth. Gravy can be made in the dripping-pan ; but such pans are usualh^ large, inconvenient to handle, and take up more space than can be spared on the top of the stove, and are much harder to wash when the gravy has been made in them. To make it in the pan, pour off" nearl}^ all the fat. Put the pan on the stove and add dry flour until the fat is all absorbed. Then add hot water or hot stocky and stir as it thickens. Cook five to eight minutes, and strain. It is well for those who like gravies to make a large quantity, as it is useful in warming over the remnants of the roast. But there is no sauce or made grav}- equal to the natural juices contained in the meat, which should flow freely into the platter when the meat is carved.

Game^ including partridges, grouse, pigeons, quail, or other birds, venison, and any wild meat that is hunted in the forest or field. Meat consists of several substances, —fibrine^ alhumen^ gelatine^ fat^ and the juice of Jlesh, Fihrine exists in the blood and flesh. In the former it is soluble, owing to the alkaline nature of the blood ; it is deposited by the blood, made into flesh, and becomes insoluble flesli-fibrine, and forms the basis or fibre of mus- cular tissue. It is separated into bundles \>y membranes, and into larger separate masses by cellular tissue, in which fat is deposited. Its true color is white ; but the blood in the veins which penetrate everj^ part of the fibre gives it a reddish tinge. This ma}' be seen b}^ washing a piece of lean meat in cold water. The red coloring matter is soon drawn into the water, and the meat is a mass of white fibre. Fibrine is hardened and contracted by intense heat, but softened by moderate and long- continued heat. Meat that has tough fibre should simmer and not boil. Albumen exists in the flesh and in the blood. It is the soluble portion of the flesh. It dissolves in cold water, but hardens in hot water. Gelatine is a peculiar substance found in the tendons

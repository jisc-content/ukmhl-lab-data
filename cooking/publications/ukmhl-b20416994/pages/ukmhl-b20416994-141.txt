Put in the coffee and isinglass. Add the boiling water. Cover the spout, and boil just five minutes. Stir it well. Set the pot on the back of the stove, where it will keep hot, but not boil. Add half a cup of cold water. Pour out a little of the coffee and pour it back again to clear the grounds from the spout. Let it stand at least ten minutes. If served in the pot, be careful not to roil the coffee by shaking the pot or b}^ careless pour- ing. A tablespoonful of caramel mixed with the ground coffee gives additional flavor and color. Steamed Coffee. The same proportions as in the preceding rule. Place the coffee-pot in a kettle of boiling water, or make the coffee in a granite double boiler kept expressly for that purpose, and steam twenty minutes. Pour it from the grounds into a hot coffee-pot for serving. Coffee made with Cold Water.â€”Put the required propor- tion of cold water and coffee into a china or granite coffee- pot, cover closely, and let it stand over night. In the morning let it just come to the boiling-point, and serve at once. It needs no straining nor clearing. {Miss Devereux.) Coffee made with an Egg. One egg is sufficient to clear one cup of ground coffee. If a smaller quantity be desired, half an egg may be used, as, if fresh, the remainder will keep till the next day. Or the whole egg may be beaten with the ground coffee, and such portion of it used as is needed, keeping the remainder closely covered. To mahe the coffee^ add half a cup of cold water to the portion of egg to be used and one third of a cup of coffee.

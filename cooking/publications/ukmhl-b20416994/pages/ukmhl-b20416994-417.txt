The Boston Cook Book, 391 FBUIT. It would be a great saving of time and work, give a pleasing variety to bills of fare, and be above all a great promoter of health, if people would use ripe fruit abun- dantly in its season at their tables (not between meals). With the markets bountifully supplied with many varieties of fruit, it is to be regretted that it cannot be found at every table at least once a day. Much of the money spent for some kinds of meat would be better expended for fruit. A simple course of fruit is all that is needed after a dinner, and is much more wholesome than pies. But it is so hard for some people to break away from old customs that it will be long before housekeepers generally will be content to serve the queen of all fruits, the apple, in its natural state instead of making it into the " persistent pie," over the preparation of which many women toil, for naught save the fear that they may be considered shiftless if they have n't a pie in the house. Ripe fruit is especially appropriate at the breakfast- table, and may be taken before or after the principal dishes, according to individual needs and taste. Some peo- ple require the acid of oranges or grapes before the^^ can eat anything substantial; others might be made ill by their use at that time, but be benefited b}^ them afterwards. All fruit should be served as fresh and cold as possible. A dish of fruit which has been kept from day to day in a warm room may answer for an ornament, but it is not tempting to the palate. Only sound, fresh fruit should appear at the table. Apples for table use should have a pleasant spicy flavor, not too acid, and should be wiped clean, or polished if 3'ou prefer the street-vender's stjde.

But from the scores, yes, hundreds of receipts in the cook-books, which seem so bewildering to the be- ginner, a few simple rules may be deduced which will make the process of soup-making intelligible ; and when once the foundation is laid, you may build and enlarge as 3^ou choose. Do not be discouraged because you have not all the dozen or more ingredients mentioned in most receipts. You will find many of them may be omitted with a per- fectly satisfactory result. Much depends upon what is omitted, though, as Potage a la Heine without chicken, or Julienne without vegetables, or Mullagatawney without curr}" powder, would disappoint those who think only of the name ; but, called by any other name, you would find them very good soups.

This liquid is more or less solid when cold, according to the gelatinous nature of the ingredients. It varies greatly in quality, owing to the manner in which it is prepared and the material used.

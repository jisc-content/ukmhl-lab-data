98 The Boston Cook Booh Waffles and Griddle-Cakes. A waffle iron is made of two corrugated iron griddles fitted and fastened together at one side with a hinge, and revolving in an iron frame, which is to be placed over the fire. It may be either circular or oblong. Each griddle is divided into compartments, which are usuall}' grooved into diamonds, hearts, rounds, etc. The iron should be placed over the fire, heated on each side, and greased thoroughly, as it is very hard to clean if the cakes stick. Put a piece of salt pork on a fork, or put a small piece of butter in a clean cloth, and rub all over both griddles. The heat will melt the butter and let just enough of it go through the cloth. This is better than to put it on with a knife. Close the griddles and turn them; this causes the fat to run evenly over them. Open, and pour the waffle mixture into the centre of the half over the fire, or put a spoonful in each compartment, filling them about two thirds full. Cover, and cook one minute on one side, then turn and cook a little longer on the other. Any kind of griddle-cake mixture, with the addition of the melted butter to make them crisp, may be cooked on a waffle-iron, if one cares to take the extra trouble.

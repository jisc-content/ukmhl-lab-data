The Boston Cook Booh. 149 soup stock, and seasoned more highly with the addition of ground herbs, spices, force-meat balls, and wine. It is then not unlike Mock Turtle Soup. A very good bean soup may be made from the remains of baked beans. Add one quart of water and a slice of onion to each pint of beans. Boil to a pulp, mash, and season. Or make the soup of equal parts of white beans and canned or dried sweet corn. If dried corn, soak it over night, chop it fine, and boil it with the beans. If canned corn, chop it, and add it to the beans after straining. But whichever way it is prepared, do not boil the beans in the water in which they were soaked, nor serve them without straining, to remove the hulls, which contain no nutriment and are indigestible. 1 tablespoonful flour. Pick over and wash the peas. Soak over night, or for several hours in cold water. Put them on to boil in three pints of fresh cold water, and let them simmer until dis- solved, adding enough more water, as it boils away, to keep three pints of liquid in the kettle. Keep it well scraped from the sides of the kettle. When soft, rub through a strainer and put on to boil again. Add either water, stock, milk, or cream to make the consistency you wish. It should be more like a puree than a soup. Cook one large tablespoonful of butter and one of flour together, and add to the strained soup when boiling. Add the salt and pepper, and when it has simmered ten minutes, serve at once with fried dice of bread. This is delicious made in this simple wa3^ It must always be strained, and thickened with the flour and but- ter, or it will separate as it cools. It will be smooth, per- fectly free from grease; and those who like the natural Split Pea Soup. 1 cup dried split peas. 3 pints cold water. 1 tablespoonful butter. % teaspoonful sugar. 1 teaspoonful salt. 1 saltspoonful white pepper.

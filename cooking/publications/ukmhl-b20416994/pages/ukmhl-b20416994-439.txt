413 The Boston Cook Booh, No. 2. â€”Pound half a cup of coarse oatmeal until it is mealy. Put it in a tumbler, and fill the tumbler with cold water. Stir well; let it settle ; then pour off the mealy water into a saucepan. Fill again, and pour off the water, and again repeat this, being careful each time not to dis- turb the sediment in the bottom of the tumbler. Then boil the water twenty minutes. Add one saltspoonful of salt. If very thick, add a little cream or milk. Strain and serve hot. Beef essence or beef tea may be used in place of cream. This is the most palatable and convenient way of making gruel from oatmeal. Farina Gruel. 1 tablespoonful Hecker's farina. I 1 cup boiling water. 1 saltspoonful salt. | 1 cup milk.

171 The Boston Cook Booh, Potted Fish. Three shad or six small mackerel^ uncooked ; one third of a cup of salt with half a saltspooriful of cayenne pepper mixed with it, and half a cup of whole spices^ â€” cloves^ peppercorns, and allspice mixed in about equal proportions. Vine- gar to cover. Clean, remove the skin, split in halves, cut each half into three pieces, and remove all tlie larger bones. Pack the fish in laj^ers in a small stone jar. (Earthenware must not be used on account of the vinegar.) Sprinkle the salt and spices over each layer. Add one onion sliced thin, if you do not dislike the flavor. Add vinegar enough to completely cover the fish. Tie a thick paper over the top, or tie a cloth over and cover with a crust of dough to keep in all the steam. Bake in a ver}^ moderate oven five or six hours. Eemove the dough-crust, and when cooled cover, and keep in a cool place. This will keep some time, if the fish be kept under the vinegar; the bones will be dissolved, and it makes an ex- cellent relish for lunch or tea. Rules for Fish Salad^ Croquettes^ and Chowder are given elsewhere. Salt Fish Balls. 1 cup raw salt fish. 1 pint potatoes. 1 teaspoonf ul butter. 1 egg, well beaten. saltspoonful pepper. More salt, if needed. Wash the fish, pick in half-inch pieces, and free from bones. Pare the potatoes, and cut in quarters. Put the potatoes and fish in a stewpan, and cover w^ith boiling water. Boil twenty-five minutes, or till the potatoes are soft. Be careful not to let them boil long enough to be- come soggy. Drain off all the water ; mash and beat the fish and potatoes till very light. Add the butter and pepper, and when slightly cooled add the egg and more salt, if needed. Shape in a tablespoon without smoothing much, slip them off into a basket, and fry in smoking hot

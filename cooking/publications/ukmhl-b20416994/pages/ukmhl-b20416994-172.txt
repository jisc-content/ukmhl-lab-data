146 The Boston Cook Book. SOUPS WITHOUT STOCK. Any of the soups or purees in this division may be at- tempted before one has mastered the imaginary difficulties of stock-making. They are palatable, nutritious, inex- pensive, and quickly prepared. Wash and pare the potatoes, and let them soak in cold water half an hour. Put them into boiling water, and cook until very soft. Cook the onion and celery with the milk in a double boiler. When the potatoes are soft, drain off the water and mash them. Add the boiling milk and seasoning. Eub through a strainer, and put it on to boil again. Put the butter in a small saucepan, and when melted and bubbling, add the flour, and when well mixed stir into the boiling soup ; let it boil five minutes, and serve very hot. This flour thickening keeps the potato and milk from separating, and gives a smoothness and con- sistency quite unlike the granular effect which is often noticed. If the soup be too thick, add more hot milk. The celery salt may be omitted if you have the fresh celery, or, if you like, put one tahlespoonful of fine chopped parsley into the soup just before serving. When 3'OU wish a richer soup, use a quart of milk, mak- ing it much tliinner, and add two eggs^ well beaten, after you take it from the fire ; or put them in the tureen, and stir rapidly as you pour in the boiling soup. New raw potatoes, cut into small dice or balls and cooked till tender but not broken, are sometimes served in potato soup.

The Boston Cook Book. 361 ICE-CREAM AND SHERBET. A GOOD ice-cream freezer should be in every kitchen; for with it a great variety of wholesome and attractive dishes may be prepared â€¢with verj^ little expenditure of time and strength. Fruit, cream, and eggs, when frozen, are more palatable in hot weather than when served in other ways. A deep can, four inches in diameter, with a tight cover fitting outside the can, and packed in a firkin with ice and salt, makes a good substitute for a freezer. By scraping the cream from the sides and beating occa- sional 1}^ with a large bread-knife as the cream freezes, one maj^ have a ver}^ smooth quality of cream with very little effort. But whether with a patent or home-made freezer, the essential points are to have the ice finely crushed, to use the right proportion of coarse rock salt, and to beat the mixture thoroughly during the freezing. Salt has a great affinity for water, and when mixed with broken ice it unites with the water; the ice, in changing from, its solid form to a liquid, parts with its heat, and the mixture of melted ice and salt is many degrees colder than the ice alone. This is sufficient to reduce to the freezing-point the temperature of any liquid placed in the ice and salt. The finer the ice is crushed, the quicker it melts ; and the more the mixture is stirred, the sooner all parts become chilled. The melted ice and salt should surround the can, and not be drawn off* as fast as melted. For this reason it is a mistake to have the outlet for the water in the bot- tom of the firkin. It should be just, below the top of the can, and then the water will run out before it can get in- side the can. Draw it off whenever it floats the ice. The ice should be nearly as fine as the salt.

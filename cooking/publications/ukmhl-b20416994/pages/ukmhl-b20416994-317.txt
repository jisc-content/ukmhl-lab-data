The Boston Cook Book. 291 Some of the lower orders of vegetation afford valuable food. Irish and Ceylon mosses are seaweeds, Iceland moss is a lichen. Truffles and mushrooms are a species of fungi of vegetable growth, but possessing a strong meaty or animal flavor. We need a large variety of vegetables in our food to promote perfect health. Vegetables are rich in saline substances which counteract the evil effect of too much animal food. Some are rich in organic acids, and man}^ abound in indigestible ligneous tissues which are useful in certain conditions. Those which contain starch and albumen and which can be stored for use during the winter months are considered the most valuable. All vegetables need the addition of salt and butter, or some form of fat, and many are rendered less indigestible by seasoning with pepper. Peas, beans, squashes, beets, turnips, etc., which contain sugar, should be slightly sweetened, as much of the natural sweetness is lost in cooking; and those con- taining potash salts, as cabbage and lettace, need an acid condiment. Beans, peas, and other vegetables, which are difficult of digestion, are less indigestible if eaten in the form of purees. Green vegetables should be freshlj- gathered, thoroughly washed in cold water, and cooked in freshly boiling salted water. It is impossible to give a definite time for cooking, as much depends upon their age and the time they have been gathered. Wilted vegetables require a much longer time than fresh. All vegetables should be cooked until soft and tender, and no longer. This is better ascertained by watching them carefully and piercing with a fork than b}^ depending upon any time-table. Veg- etables which are eaten raw and are liable to ferment in the stomach are usually dressed with some condiment, â€” oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Every green vegetable keeps its color better if it be boiled rapidly and uncovered. Many use soda for the same purpose, but unwisely.

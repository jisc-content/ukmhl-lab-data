142 The Boston Cook Book. Chicken Broth. Clean the chicken, and separate it at the joints. Re- move all the skin and fat. Cover the chicken with cold water. Add one tahlespoonfid of salt^ one saltspoonful of pepper^ one small onion^ sliced. Simmer until the chicken is tender. Remove the best part of the meat, and put the bones and gristle back and simmer until the bones are clean. Wash and soak two tahlespoonfuls of rice half an hour. Strain the broth. Remove the fat. Put the broth on to boil again, and add to it the rice, and the nicest portions of meat cut into small pieces. Simmer until the rice is tender. Add seasoning to taste, and serve at once. A*few spoonfuls of cream may be added if desired. Serve with toasted crackers. Turkey Soup. Take the bones and scraps left from roast turkey or chicken, or any kind of game. Scrape the meat from the bones, and la}^ aside any nice pieces, no matter how small. Remove all the stuffing, and keep that by itself. Break the bones, and pack them closely in a kettle. Cover with cold water. Add one small onion^ sliced, one teaspoonful of salf^ and a little pepper. Simmer two or three hours, or until the bones are clean. Strain, and remove the fat. Put the liquor on to boil again, and add for every quart of liquor, one cup of cold meat^ cut into small pieces, and half a cup of the stitffing. Or omit the stuffing and thicken the soup with flour. Simmer till the meat is tender, and serve at once. If there be a much larger proportion of meat and stuffing left, use it in making scalloped turke}^ or croquettes. This is much better than to boil meat, bones, and stuffing together. In that case the stuffing absorbs the oil, and gives a very strong, disagreeable flavor to the soup.

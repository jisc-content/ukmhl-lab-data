The Boston Cook Book. 435 MISCELLANEOUS HINTS. To Chop Suet. — Cut into small pieces and remove the membrane. Sprinkle with flour, and chop in a cold place to prevent its becoming soft and sticky. To Clean Currants, — Put them in a squash strainer, and sprinkle thickly with flour. Rub them well until they are separated, and the flour, grit, and fine stems have passed through the strainer. Then place the strainer and currants in a pan of water, and wash thoroughly. Lift the strainer and currants together, and change the water till clear. Drain between towels, and pick over carefully. Dry them in a sunny place or between towels, but do not harden them by putting them into the oven. To Stone Haisins, — Pour boiling water over them, and let them stand in it five or ten minutes. Drain, and rub each raisin between the thumb and finger till the seeds come out clean, then cut or tear apart, or chop, if wanted very fine. Core Apples before paring, and there is less danger of their breaking. JEgg Shells. — Wash eggs as soon as the}^ come from the market, and then the shells may be used in clearing coffee, soup, etc. To Boil a Pudding in a Cloth. — Wring strong cotton cloth out of boiling water, and spread over a bowl. Sprinkle with flour, fill with the pudding, draw the cloth together, and tie tightly, then flour near the opening. Plunge into boiling water, and keep the water boiling during the time for cooking. Add boiling water as needed, and replenish the fire often. Meringues should be put on puddings after they are slightly cool, as, if the pudding be hot, the egg will liquefy.

Put the corn meal in the mixing-bowl, and scald it with boiling water, just enough to wet it; let it stand ten min- utes, then add cold water enough to make a soft batter. When lukewarm, add the yeast, molasses, soda, salt, and rj'C meal. Beat it well, and let it rise over night, or until it cracks open. Stir it down ; put it in a buttered and floured tin to rise again; sprinkle flour over the top. Bake in a moderate oven two hours. Brown bread made by this rule was first tested by the writer thirty years ago, when it was a wonder and delight to watch it as it was put on a wooden shovel and placed in the great brick oven. It has been made in the same house regularly every week since then, and proves just as good now as it was in the olden time.

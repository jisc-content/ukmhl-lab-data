3/8 The Boston Cook Book. Mother's Cake. {Mrs. R. M. Walcott.) This receipt is the foundation for countless varieties of cake, which are often given in cook books under different names, but which when analyzed are found to be identical in proportions. 1 scant cup butter. cup sugar. 3 eggs, beaten separately. 1 teaspoonful lemon or vanilla. 1 saltspoonful mace. 3^ cup milk. 3 cups pastry flour. 1 teaspoonful cream of tartar. ^ teaspoonful soda. Cream the butter; add the sugar gradually, then the 3^olks of the eggs, then the flavoring. Reserve a quarter of a cup of flour, lest the cake be too stiff if all be used ; less flour will be required for a thin than for a thick loaf. Put the soda and cream of tartar into the remainder of the flour. Add the milk and flour alternatel}^, a little at a time, and lastly the whites, which have been beaten stiff and dry., Bake from forty to fifty minutes in a moderate oven. Add one cup of currants^ and it makes a nice Currant Cake; or half a cup of dates, cut fine and floured, and you have Date Cake, Color one cupful of the dough with spices, — cinnamon.^ allspice,, and mace^ — or with grated chocolate^ put it in the pan in spots, and you have Leopard Cake, By using a/w^^ cup of butterit is the same as White Mountain Cake, For Nut Cake add one cup of fine chopped walnuts^ or other nuts, to the dough, and put a laj^er of unbroken halves of English walnuts over the top. Or bake in shallow round pans, split and spread with a thin layer of currant jelly,, and then fill with Cocoa- nut and Haisin Cream made as follows: One cup of raisins,^ stoned and chopped fine, half a cup of chopped almonds., half a cup of grated cocoanut^ and the white of one egg^ beaten stiff.

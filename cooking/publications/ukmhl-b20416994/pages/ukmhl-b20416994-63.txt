Accidental!}^ some one discovered that b}^ letting the dough stand till it had fermented, and then mixing it with new dough, it raised, or lifted, the whole mass, and made it lighter and more porous. Thus we have our word loaf^ from Ufian, to raise, or lift up. The old dough—or leaven, as it is called—lifts up the dough. The raised mass is held in place b}^ the heat in baking, and becomes the loaf of raised bread. Bread made from Wheat. — Bread is made principally from wheat flour. Eye and corn meal are sometimes used, but better results are obtained when there is a mixture of wheat with one or more of these grains» Rye used alone makes a close, moist, stickj^ bread; while corn meal alone makes too drj' and crumbly a loaf. Wheat is an annual grass of unknown origin, cultivated more extensively' in the Northern hemisphere. There are over one hundred and fifty varieties of wheat. They are classified as red or white, in reference to the color of the grains; as w^inter or summer, — winter wheat being sown in the autumn, and summer wheat in the spring; as soft or hard, —soft wheat being tender and floury or starchy, and hard wheat being tough, firm, and containing more gluten. Chemical Composition of Wheat.—Wheat is the only grain which contains gluten in the proper proportion and of the desired quality essential to the making of light, spongy bread. It contains all the elements necessary for the growth of the hody ; but, to meet all the requirements of nutrition, the whole of the grain, with the exception of ^ , ^ . „ , ^ , . ^ ' ^ Fig. 1.

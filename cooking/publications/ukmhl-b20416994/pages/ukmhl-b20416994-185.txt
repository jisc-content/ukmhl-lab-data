The Boston Cook Booh, 159 FISH. Fish, on account of its abundance, cheapness, and wliolesomeness, is invaluable as an article of food. It is less nutritious and less stimulating than meat, as it con- tains less solid matter and more water. An exaggerated idea of the value of fish as brain food has prevailed ; the latest authorities, however, state that there is no evidence to prove that fish is any richer than meat in phosphorus. But as it contains little fat, the white varieties particularly, it is easily digested, and as it has a large proportion of nitrogenous material, it is especially adapted to all those upon whom there are great demands for nervous energy. Salmon heads the list of whatsoever hath scales and fins," in nutritive qualities ; and it is richer than meat. The next in value are fat halibut, shad, white-fish, mack- erel, blue-fish, lean halibut, bass, flounder, trout, cod, haddock, cusk, etc. Red-blooded fish, like salmon, mackerel, and blue-fish, have the oil distributed through the hodij. They are nutritious for those who can digest them, but are too rich and oily for invalids. White fish, like flounder, halibut, cod, and haddock, have the oil in the liver, and are more easily digested. Fish should be perfectly fresh and thor- oughly cooked, or it will be very indigestible and some- times poisonous. Broiling and baking are the best methods. Small pan-fish and fillets of large white dr}^ fish are good if fried ; but oily fish should never be fried. Salting draws out the nutritive part of fish the same as it does in meat; and either, when thus prepared, should be used as a relish, and not depended upon for nourishment. Fat fish are injured less than white fish, as the fat is not removed by salting.

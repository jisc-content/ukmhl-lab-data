404 The Boston Cook Book. Tomato Catchup. (Mrs. Campbell.) Boil one bushel of ripe tomatoes, skins and all, and when soft strain through a colander to remove the skins only. Mix one cup of salt, two pounds of brown sugar, half an ounce of cayenne pepper, three ounces each of ground all- spice, mace, and celery seed, two ounces of ground cinna- mon, and stir into the tomato. Add two quarts of best cider vinegar, and when thoroughl}^ mixed strain through a sieve. Pour all that runs through into a large kettle, and boil slowl}^ till reduced one half. It is an improvement to add a pint of brandy ten minutes before the catchup is done, but many think it unnecessary. Put it in small bottles, seal, and keep in a cool, dark place. Chop the tomatoes, mix the salt with them thoroughly, and let them stand over night. In the morning pour off the water, and chop the onion and celery. Mix the sugar, pepper, cinnamon, and mustard. Put in a porcelain kettle a layer of tomatoes, onion, celery, and spices, and so on until all is used, and cover with the vinegar. Cook slowly all day, or until the tomatoes are soft. Cauliflower, or cabbage, or one quart of cucumbers may be used with the tomatoes. Sliced or grated horseradish gives a pleasant flavor. Pickled Cucumbers. {Miss Harriott Ward.) To one hundred and fifty small-sized cucumbers take one pint of salt, dissolved in boiling water to cover them. Let them remain in a covered vessel for fort3'-eight hours.

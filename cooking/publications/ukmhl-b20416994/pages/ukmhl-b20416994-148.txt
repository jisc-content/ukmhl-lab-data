122 The Boston Cook Book. Stock is usually made from the cheaper, inferior parts of meat, which yield the most nutriment when cooked in this way; also from odds and ends of cooked meat, which perhaps could not be used otherwise. The chief object in making stock is to obtain in the quickest manner the largest possible amount of nutriment from the cheap- est parts of meat, and after getting it to keep and use it. This is best accomplished by observing the following rules: — First. Cut the meat into small pieces, and soak them in cold water before heating, that every atom of nourish- ment may be extracted. Cold water draws out and dissolves the meat juices, while hot water hardens the albumen on the outside of the meat and prevents the juices from escaping into the liquid. Second. Use a careful selection and proportion of meat, bone, and water, and season judiciously, so that no one flavor will predominate. Third, Use a steam-tight kettle, and simmer., — not boil the material rapidl}', — that the juices may be retained in the water, and not wasted by evaporation. Fourth. Make stock the day before using, if possible, that the fat ma}^ be more easily remeved ; but do not give up making it simply from ''lack of time," for it ccm be made qu^ckl3^ A soitp digester is the proper vessel for making stock. This is a porcelain-lined iron kettle with a bale, and hav- ing a cover fitting closely into a groove, so that no steam can escape except from the valve in the top of the cover, which at once indicates when the water is boiling rapidly. One holding six quarts, and costing three dollars, is a con- venient size for a small family. If you cannot afford a digester, get a granite ironware kettle, with a tightly fit- ting cover. Plain ironware will do if 3^ou have nothing better; but it rusts easily, and, if tin-lined, the tin melts in careless usage. The meats used in making stock should contain gelatine,, osmazome^ and a small amount of fat.

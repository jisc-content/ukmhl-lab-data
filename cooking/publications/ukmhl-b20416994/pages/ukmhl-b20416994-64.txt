The Boston Cook Book. 38 Fig. 2. Grain of wheat with bran coat removed- husk lie the inner bran coats, containing gluten, a dark sub- stance which is the nitrogenous or flesh-forming element, the phosphates and other min- eral matters which help to make up the bony parts of the bod}', and the oil which gives the characteristic odor to wheat grains. The cen- tre, or heart, of the grain consists of cells filled with starchy a fine, white, mealy powder, which has little value as food except as a heat producer. There is also a small amount of gluten dif- fused among the starch cells. For convenience, these dif- ferent parts of the wheat will be designated as bran^ or the outer husk ; gluten, or the inner bran coats ; and starch, or the heart of the wheat. The proportion and quality of the gluten and starch in difi'erent kinds of wheat vary according to the climate and soil in which they are grown. They are also afiTected by the method of grinding the grain. Wheat grown in Southern or warm climates, and in the intense, though short, summer of our own Northwest, contains more nitrogen than that grown in cold, damp climates. It loses more water by evaporation, and consequently the seed is smaller and harder. In some varieties of wheat the outer hush is thin and smooth, and peels ofl^* readily under the stones. In others, it is thick and rough, and adheres closely to the kernel. In some, it is light-colored or brittle ; in others, dark-colored or tough. The husk}^ portion of wheat is about fourteen or sixteen per cent of the whole weight. The gluten of wheat is a gray, tough, elastic substance, consisting chiefly of vegetable fibrine. It can be examined FiGo 3. Grain of wheat magnified. A is the bran; B the gluten ; C the starch.

187 The Boston Cook Book, MEAT AND FISH SAUCES. Drawn Batter^ or water and melted butter thickened with flour, and seasoned, is the simplest form of a sauce. When milk, or cream, or white stock is used in place of water, less butter is required, and the sauce is called White, or Cream, or Bechamel sauce. By browning the butter, using brown stock, and adding different seasoning materials, we have all the varieties of Brown sauces. Many people fail in making sauces by not cooking the flour sufficiently, and also by serving them with a mass of oily butter on the surface. Usuall}^ the flour is wet to a smooth paste and stirred into the boiling liquid. When made in this manner, the sauce should boil at least ten min- utes to have the flour thoroughly cooked. But by cooking the dry flour in the hot butter the starch in the flour is more quickly cooked, and the butter is all absorbed and converted into an emulsion. Sauces made in this manner are perfectlj^ smooth, free from grease, and have a fine flavor. Every one should learn how to make both white and brown sauces. They are adapted to nearly every form of food. Meats, fish, vegetables, eggs, macaroni, rice, toast, etc., are rendered more palatable by being served with an appropriate sauce. Put half the butter in a saucepan ; be careful not to let it become brown ; when melted, add the dry flour, and mix Drawn Butter Sauce. 1 pint hot water or white stock, cup butter, scant. 2 tablespoonfuls flour. 3^ teaspoonf ul salt. 3^ saltspoonf ul pepper.

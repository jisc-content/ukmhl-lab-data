When taken alone, tlie}^ are stimulating rather than nutritive, and a patient would soon starve if he did not have the addition of the fibrine of the meat or of some farinaceous food, like bread crumbs or oatmeal. Beef Essence and Beef Tea. Beef essence is the pure juice of the meat. This is given where a patient needs much nourishment in a small com- pass. Beef tea is the juice of the meat dihited with water. It is a mistake to think that any beef because it is lean or cheap is good enough for beef tea. It will do for the soup-kettle, but not for those who are ill. Meat for beef tea should be lean, juicy, and of good flavor. Everj' par- ticle of fat, skin, and membrane must be removed. The top of the round and the back and middle of the rump con- tain the most and the best-flavored juice. It costs more per pound than some other pieces ; but as it yields nearly double the amount of juice, it is really cheaper. The ten- derloin is often recommended for sick persons. It should never be used for beef tea, as it contains very little juice and lacks flavor. When the tender fibre of the meat is desired, it may be broiled, and served with the juice from some tougher steak. Broiliyig is the quickest, and sometimes the most palatable, way of preparing both essence and tea in an emergency. Drawing and heating the meat and juice is best where a little nourishment is to be given often, and where all the elements of the meat are needed. Soaking in cold water, then straining, and heating the juice only, is the most economical way, as more than twice the usual amount of juice may be obtained by adding more water when the meat has not been heated. The albuminous juices of meat coagulate at 160Â° ; if the tea be allowed to boil, they become hard, and settle almost immediately^ when served. Many make the mistake of straining the tea, or leaving the sediment untouched. If

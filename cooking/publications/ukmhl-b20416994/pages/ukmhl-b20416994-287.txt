261 The Boston Cook Booh Roast Goose. Singe, remove the pin feathers, and before it is cut or drawn, wash and scrub thoroughly in warm soapsuds, to open and cleanse the pores, and render the oil more easy to be extracted. Then draw, as ^lirected on page 253. Wash and rinse the inside in clear water, and wipe dry. Stuff with mashed potatoes highly seasoned with onion, sage, salt, and pepper, or with equal parts of bread crumbs, chopped apples, and boiled onions, seasoned with salt, sage, SLud pepper. Sew and truss ; put on a rack in a pan, and cover the breast with slices of fat salt pork. Place in the oven for three quarters of an hour. Ther^ork fat is quickly drawn out by the heat, flows over the goose, and aids in drawing out the oil. When considerable oil is extracted, take the pan from the oven, and pour off all the oil. Remove the pork, and dredge the goose with flour, and place again in the oven. When the flour is browned, add a little hot water, and baste often. Dredge with flour after basting. Cook until brown and tender. Make a gravy as on page 256. Garnish wdth water cresses. Serve with apple sauce. Roast Ducks. Pick, singe, and remove the crop, entrails, oil bag, legs, and pinions. Wipe, truss, dredge with salt, pepper, butter, and flour. Bake in a hot oven twenty minutes if liked rare, or thirty minutes if preferred well done. Serve with olive sauce and green peas. Geese and ducks have a strong flavor, and are improved by stuffing the craw and body with apples cored and quartered. The apples absorb the strong flavor, therefore should not be eaten. Celery and onions are also placed inside the duck, to improve its flavor. Braised Ducks. Ducks that are tough and unfit to roast are improved by being braised with onions, carrots, and turnips. Or they may be stewed, and served with canned j9ea5.

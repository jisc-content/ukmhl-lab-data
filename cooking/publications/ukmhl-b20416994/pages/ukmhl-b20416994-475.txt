AN OUTLINE OF STUDY FOR TEACHERS. FOOD: ITS USES, CLASSIFICATION, AND PROPORTION. Webster defines food as anything that supports and nour- ishes life." The kingdom of nature is divided into organic and inorganic bodies. Organic bodies have life; inorganic bodies are without life. Organic bodies are composed of several reciprocal parts, each of which is necessary to, and dependent upon, all the other parts. Organic bodies, therefore, include plants and animals, and inorganic bodies include earths, metals, and minerals. Organic bodies spring from some parent or immediate producing agent; they are supported by means of nourishment, and die without it; they increase in size by the addition of new particles of matter to all parts of their substances. Inorganic bodies are formed by some chemical law or union, and grow only by addition to their surfaces. Organic and inorganic bodies are continually wasting away or wearing out. Waste takes place in all objects, animate and in- animate. The minutest change in position in any plant, ani- mal, or rock cannot be effected without some loss of substance. It has always been beyond the power of man to make anything that w^ould not wear out. But there is this important distinction between organic and inorganic bodies. Only organic bodies can repair their waste, and add to their substance; they alone have life, or vital force. When anything wears out in a stone or a steam-engine, there is no power in the stone or the engine to replace the lost matter; and when a plant or an animal dies, the power of repairing waste is gone from it forever. Hence it is with animate bodies, or bodies endowed with life, that we have to do in considering the subject of food. 29

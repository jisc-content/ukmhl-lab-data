353 The Boston Cook Book. To Whip Cream, — Place a bowl half filled with cream in a pan of broken ice. When verj' cold, put the churn into the cream, hold the cylinder firmly, and keep the cover in place with the left hand. Tip the churn slightly, that the cream may flow out at the bottom. Work the dasher with a light short stroke up^ and a hard^ pushing stroke down. When the froth appears, stir it down once or twice, as the first bubbles are too large; and when the bowl is full of froth, skim it off into a granite pan placed on ice. Take ofi* froth only, and do not take it ofl" below the holes in the cylinder, as it whips better when the}^ are covered. For this reason never whip a pint of cream in a three- quart bowl, and do not try to whip it all, as usually a little is left in the bowl which is too thin to whip. One pint of cream should treble in whipping. If for a garnish, drain the whipped cream on a hair sieve placed over a pan, and keep it on ice till stiff enough to keep its shape. Creams that are to be moulded are made stiffer by the addition of gelatine. Cream Whips. (^Miss Ward.) 1 pint rich cream. 1 cup pale sherry wine. 1 lemon (grated rind and juice). }4 cup sugar. Whites of 2 eggs, beaten light. Mix in the order given. Add more sugar if desired. Stir till the sugar is dissolved, then whip it and take off the froth as it rises, and put it on a hair sieve. Fill jelly glasses with the cream left in the bowl, and put the froth on the top. Newport Whips, (Mrs. Upham,)— One pint oi cream,, sweet or sour, one gill of sif^seet milk,, half a lemon sliced, sugar and loine to taste. Whip, and serve the whip only, in jelly glasses. If prepared in a covered bowl or tureen, the unwhipped cream may be kept for several daj^s, add- ing more cream, sugar, and wine to taste, and whipping as required for use. 23

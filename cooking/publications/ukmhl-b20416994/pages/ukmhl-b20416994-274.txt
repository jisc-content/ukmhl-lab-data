248 The Boston Cook Book. Sausages. If you like to know what jou are eating, have 3'our sausage meat prepared at home or by some one whom yon can trust. Of sweet fresh pork take one third fat and two thirds lean^ and chop fine, or have it ground hw your butcher. Season highh^ with salt^ pepper^ and sage (use the whole sage ; dry, pound, and sift it). Mix thor- oughly. Make cotton bags, one yard long and four inches wid^. Dip them in strong salt and water, and dry before filling. Crowd the meat into the bags closely, pressing it with a pestle or potato-masher. Tie the bag tightly and keep in a cool place. When wanted for use, turn the end of the bag back, and cut off the meat in half- inch slices, and cook in a frying-pan till brown. Core and quarter several apples^ and fry in the hot fat and serve with the sausages. A safe rule in seasoning sausage meat is one even table- spoonful of salt^ one teaspoonful of sifted sage^ and a scant half-teaspoonful of white pepper to each pound of meat. Souse.

Let them remain in salt and water for ten hours. Scrape, and clean again, and put them a second time in freshly salted water. With proper care they will be perfectl}^ clean. Put them in a kettle and cover with cold w^ater; skim when it begins to boil; set back and let it simmer till the bones slip out easily. Skim out the meat, and remove the hard gristle, bones, and any superfluous fat. Season with salt^ pepper^ and vinegar^ and pack in stone jars. When hard, cut in slices, and brown in the oven. Head Cheese, â€” Prepare the same as souse, omitting the vinegar^ and season with sage. Put into a strainer cloth,

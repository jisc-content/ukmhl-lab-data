The Boston Cook Booh. 428 Gluten Gems. 2 cups gluten. % teaspoonful salt. 2 teaspoonfuls baking-powder. 2 tablespoonfuls sugar. 1 egg. 2 cups water or milk. Bake in very hot buttered gem pans, in a hot oven, half an hour. Let very 3'oung children have mother's milk above every- thing else ; but if this be impossible, dissolve one ounce of sugar of milk or loaf sugar in three fourths of a pint of boiling water^ and mix, as required for use, with an equal quantity of fresh cow's milk. Give it, slightly w?irm, from a sweet, clean bottle. Sugar of milk is quite ex- pensive, but it is very much better for an infant than cane sugar. Teething children should have the milk from but one cow; the cow should not be fed on green corn nor sour apples, as these produce acidity in the milk. A little thin, well-boiled oatmeal, or farina gruel, may be added to the milk. For Slimmer complaint^ use scalded (not boiled) milk, prepared flour, roasted rice, boiled, mashed, and thinned with milk ; also rice jell}^ or barky gruel. Avoid all purely starchy gruels, like arrowroot, sago, and cornstarch, upon which many children are fed to death. For constipation,^ a little salt added to cow's milk is often beneficial; also gruel made from prepared corn meal and wheat flour, and oatmeal gruel. For older children use oatmeal, hominy or farina mush, and ripe fruit. Prepared Flour {for Infants). â€” Tie one pint of flour in a stout cloth, put it into boiling water, and let it boil three hours. Turn out the flour ball, and scrape off the gluten which will be found in a mass on the outside of the ball and is not desirable. The inside will prove a dry powder, which is very astringent. Grate a tablespoonful of this powder from the ball as wanted ; wet it in cold Diet for Infants and Young Children.

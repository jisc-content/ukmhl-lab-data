The Boston Cook Book. 393 Iced Fruits, — Dip selected fruit into the white of egg slightly beaten, then roll in fine granulated sugar. Drj^, and serve very cold. Whole fruit should be served in a high dish, garnished with green leaves, flowers, or vines, and, with a tasteful combination of colors, arranged in a convenient way for serving. Nuts should be cracked, and served with salt. Almo7ids and other nuts having a tough inner skin should be blanched. Raisins, — Use only choice varieties, and serve with nuts. Peel the oranges, divide into sections, and remove the seeds and tough membrane. Put a la^-er of orange in the bottom of a glass dish, pour over it a little wine or lemon juice, and strew wdth powdered sugar; add cocoanut, and then the banana cut in thin slices; repeat the process, using orange, cocoanut, banana, etc., as before. The top la^^er is to be heaped high in the centre, and sprinkled thickly with cocoanut and powdered sugar, and garnished around the base with slices of banana. Other combinations of fruit may be arranged to suit the taste; and cocoanut cakes or macaroons^ crumbled, or a meringue of white of egg and sugar^ may take the place of the grated cocoanut. The simplest forms of cooking fruit are stewing and baking. Only a small amount of sugar is needed, and it is not well to prepare a large quantity at a time, as stewed fruits do not keep long. In cooking fruit alwa^^s use porce- lain or granite kettles, earthen dishes, wooden spoons, and Tropical Snow. 8 sweet oranges. 1 cocoanut, grated. 6 red bananas. 1 glass sherry wine, or cup lemon juice. Powdered sugar to taste. Stewed and Baked Fruits.

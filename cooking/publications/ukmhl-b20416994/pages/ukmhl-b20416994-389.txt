The Boston Cook Book, 363 a quart of froth, and add the froth after the cream is partly frozen. Man}^ prefer to add the whites of eggs, beaten till foamy, but not stiff. Use two^ three^ or four eggs to each quart of cream. The proportion of sugar should vary according to the flavoring used. Ice-Cream, No. 2 (Neapolitan Ice-Cream). 1 quart milk. (6 or 8 eggs yolks). 1 cup sugar. 1 pint to 1 quart cream. Sugar to taste. Flavoring. Make a boiled custard with the milk, sugar, and the yolks of the eggs.

No matter how many eggs are used, a little cream, if not more than half a cupful, is a decided improvement to all ice-creams. It is better to make sher- bet, or fruit and water ices, than an inferior quality of ice- cream with milk. Ice-creams are richer and mould better when made with gelatine ; but care must be taken to flavor highly, to disguise the taste of the gelatine. Use a quarter of a box of JVelso7i^s gelatine for two quarts of custard. Soak in half a cup of cold milk, and dissolve in the boiling custard just as it is taken from the fire. If by any acci- dent the custard should curdle in cooking, it will be smooth when frozen.

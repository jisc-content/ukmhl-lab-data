The Boston Cook Book. 289 VEGETABLES. Vegetable food, in its widest sense, includes some part of every form of plant growth, — herb, shrub, or tree, — used either as vegetables, fruits, grains, condiments, or beverages. Vegetables, as the term is generall}^ used, are such plants as are cultivated for culinary purposes. They comprise a variety of the parts of the plant, — roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruit. Before studying vegetables proper, it may be interesting for those who have never considered food from a botan- ical point of view to glance at the various forms of veg- etable growth commonly used as food. Beginning with roots^ we find, among fleshy roots, the carrot, turnip, parsnip, beet, salsifj^, and radish, which are cooked in their natural state or used raw. Also from roots we get ginger, arrowroot, and tapioca. Rootstocks^ or stems growing underground, consist of tubers^ like the potato, yam, and artichoke, and of scal}^ bulbs, like the onion, chives, leek, and garlic. Stems we eat in asparagus ; and whole trunks of trees are felled and used in making sago, which is \h(d pith of a species of palm-tree. Leaves include lettuce, endive, spinach, parsley, cabbage, and greens of various kinds. Dried leaves and Jloivers are used in the form of tea, sage, thyme, ba}^ leaves, tobacco, marjoram, savor}', and other herbs. Leaf stalks include celer}' and rhubarb ; flower stalks^ cauliflower and globe arti- chokes. The juices of vegetables furnish many forms of food,—sugar, acids, honey, oil, gum, and wines. The bark we use in cinnamon. Unexpanded flower-buds are pickled, as in capers, or dried, as in cloves. Ripe cloves have no aroma. Many seeds or berries are gathered green, and are then dried for use.

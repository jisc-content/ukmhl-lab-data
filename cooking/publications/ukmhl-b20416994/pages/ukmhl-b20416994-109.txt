The Boston Cook Book. 83 Soda and Cream of Tartar Biscuit. 1 quart sifted flour. 2 fall teaspoonfuls cream of 1 even teaspoonf ul salt. tartar. 1 even teaspoonful soda, meas- 1 large tablespoonful butter, ured after pulverizing. Milk to make a very soft dough: new-process flour will take a pint or more ; St. Louis flour, less. Mix in the order given, sifting the soda, salt, and cream of tartar into the flour. Then sift all together twice. E-ub in the butter with the tips of the fingers, until there are no large lumps. Mix in the milk gradually, using a broad knife and wetting only a small part of the flour with each addition of the milk. When just stiff enough to be handled (not kneaded), cut it through with the knife until barely mixed ; it should look spongy in the cuts and seem full of air. Turn it out on a well-floured board ; toss with the knife till well floured ; touch it with the hands as little as possible ; pat it with the rolling-pin, which must be lifted quickly that it may not stick; and when the dough is about half an inch thick, cut it into rounds and bake at once. To make Twin Biscuit^ roll the dough out less than half an inch thick, cut into rounds, spread with softened but- ter, and put two together, and bake ten or fifteen minutes. Baking-Powder Biscuit. These are made in the same way as the preceding, using three rounding teaspoonfuls of baking-powder in place of soda and cream of tartar. Sour Milk Biscuit. These should be made the same as cream of tartar bis- cuit, using one pint of thick sour milk instead of sweet milk, and omitting the cream of tartar. Observe the same directions as to lightness and dexteritj^ in mixing, and vary the amount of milk according to the flour.

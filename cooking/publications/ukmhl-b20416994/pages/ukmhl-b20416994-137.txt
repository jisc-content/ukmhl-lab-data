Ill The Boston Cook Book. BEVERAGES. Tea. There are three varieties of the tea-plant; both black and green tea can be prepared from them all. Green tea is made from young leaves steamed, roasted, and dried quickly on copper plates. Black tea is made from leaves which have been exposed to the air ten or twelve hours before roasting. The action of the air upon the leaves during this long exposure causes the dark color. Green tea gives up less of its juices in drjdng, and this accounts for its energetic action on the nervous system. The tea-leaf contains the largest amount of nutritive matter of any plant used as human food, though only a small portion of it is extracted by our common method of making tea. There is a large proportion of casein in the leaves. Many of the savage tribes of Tartar}^ boil the leaves with soda, and eat them with salt and butter. But in our method of using tea as a beverage merel}^, we use such a comparatively small quantity that the amount of nutriment is verj^ little; its chief value being the sense of warmth and comfort that it gives. It excites the brain to increased activity, and produces wakefulness ; hence it is useful to students and night-workers. It retards the action of the natural functions, causes less waste, and, to a certain extent, saves food. For this reason, when not used in excess, it is suited to poor people, whose supplies of substantial food are scanty ; and to old persons, whose powers of digestion and whose bodil}'' substance have begun to fail. It should not be used early in the morning, as the body needs immediate nourishment in a larger quantity; and it should at all times be taken moderately, both as to quantity and strength.

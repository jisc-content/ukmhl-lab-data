319 The Boston Cook Book. Keep the edges even while rolling, and fold evenly, that there may be an equal number of layers in all parts. Each time the paste is folded over the butter a small amount of air is enclosed and is retained, unless the fold be patted down and allow the air to escape at the end. These bub- bles of air may be plainly seen when the ball of dough is patted and rolled out, and care must be taken not to let the air escape. For this reason roll lightly and always from you^ as a hard motion back and forth is more liable to break the bubbles. Roll with a fan-like sweep, a little to the right and left, to widen it and keep the rectangular shape; then roll gently on the edge nearest 3'Ou, to make it of uniform thickness. The more of the bubbles 3'ou can retain in the paste, tlie lighter and more puffy it will be. The number of folds or layers of butter and paste makes the paste flak}^, but the amount of air in it makes it rise and puff in baking. The paste should be folded and rolled till no streaks of butter can be seen. After the last rolling, place it on the ice to harden, as it may then be cut and shaped more easily. To Bake Puff Paste. â€” The dough should be icy cold when it is put into the oven. If the patties soften after being shaped, place them between the pans of ice till they are hard. The oven should be about as hot as for rolls, with the heat greater underneath, that the paste may rise nearly to its full height before browning ; then quicken the fire to brown the tops, and turn the heat from underneath or put a pan or grate under to prevent burning. If the oven be too hot, the paste will burn before it is risen; if too slow, it will melt and spread. Patty Shells, Tarts, Vol-au-vents, and other Forms of Puff Paste. There are two ways of shaping the paste for patties and tarts. First, roll puff paste one eighth of an inch thick, and stamp out circular pieces with a cutter, two and

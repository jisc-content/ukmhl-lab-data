143 DESSERT. Chocolate Ice Cream.—Make a foundation with two eggs, one cupful of sugar, half a cupful of flour, and a pint of milk, the same as for vanilla ice cream. While this is cooking, scrape one square (an ounce) of chocolate, and add to it two table-spoonfuls of sugar and one of boiling water. Stir this over the fire until perfectly smooth and glossy, and add it to the boiling mixture. This quantity gives a very delicate flavour. If a stronger one is wished use two squares of the chocolate. Put the mixture in cold water to cool. Stir occasionally. When cold, add one teacupful of sugar and one quart of milk. Freeze. Brown Bread Ice Cream.—Dry the crust of brown bread in a warm oven. Roll fine and sift. Add one pint of the crumbs to the preparation for vanilla ice cream. The vanilla and two-thirds of the second cupful of sugar must be omitted. Macaroon Ice Cream.—Make a cream the same as for vanilla, except omit the second cupful of sugar and the vanilla flavour. Brown one dozen and a half macaroons in the oven. Let them cool; then roll them into fine crumbs. Add these and three table-spoonfuls of wine to the cream, and freeze. Coffee Ice Cream.—Make the same as vanilla, with the addition of one cupful of strong coffee. This gives a strong flavour. Less can be used. The second cupful of sugar should be large. Caramel Ice Cream.—Make the hot mixture, as for vanilla. Put the small cupful of sugar in a small frying- pan and stir over the fire until the sugar turns liquid and begins to smoke. Turn into the boiling mixture, and put away to cool. When cold, add one quart of cream. Strain the mixture into the freezer, and freeze. The flavour of this cream can be varied by browning the sugar more or less. Almond Ice Cream.—This is made the same as vanilla,

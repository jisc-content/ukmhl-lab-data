AMERICAN DISHES. 188 light batter is formed. Mix the yeast with four table-spoon- fuls of cold water, and add it and the salt to the batter, which let rise over night in a cool place. In the morning fill buttered muffin-pans two-thirds to the top, and set them in a warm place till the batter has so risen as to fill the tins. Bake thirty-five minutes. One-third of a cupful of liquid yeast may be substituted for the compressed yeast. Hominy Muffins.—A pint of milk, a quart of Haxall flour, one teaspoonful of salt, two table-spoonfuls of butter, one- third of a cake of compressed yeast, or one-third of a cupful of liquid yeast; half a cupful of hominy, measured before cooking. Wash the hominy, and add a pint of boiling water. Boil one hour, stirring often. Then add the milk, salt, yeast, and butter. Pour this, gradually, on the flour, beating well. Let it rise over night. In the morning put in buttered muffin-pans and let rise from half to three- quarters of an hour. Bake thirty-five minutes. The muffins may be put to rise in the morning for tea. Gems.—One pint of flour, one of milk, an egg, half a tea- spoonful of salt. Beat the egg until light, add the milk and salt to it, and beat, gradually, into the flour. Bake twenty minutes in hot gem-pans. A dozen cakes can be made with the quantities given. Hominy Drop-Cakes.—One pint of fresh-boiled hominy (or, cold hominy may be used; if the latter, break into grains, as lightly as possible, with a fork, and heat in a farina kettle without adding water), one table-spoonful of water, two eggs—whites and yolks beaten separately. Stir the yolks into the hominy first, then the whites, and a tea- spoonful of salt, if the hominy has not been salted in cook- ing ; or, if it has, use half a teaspoonful. Drop, in table- spoonfuls, on well-buttered tin sheets, and bake to a good brown in a quick oven. Squash Biscuit.—One cupful and a half of sifted squash,

17 FISH. will be lost. For frying, the fat should be deep enough to cover the article, and yet have it float from the bottom. Unless one cooks great quantities of fish in this way it is not necessary to have a separate pot of fat for this kind of frying. The same pot, with proper care, will answer for chops, cutlets, muffins, potatoes, croquettes, &c. All the cold fish left from any mode of cooking can be utilized in making delicious salads, croquettes, and escallops. Boiled Fish.â€”A general rule for boiling fish, which will hold good for all kinds, and thus save a great deal of time and space, is this : Any fresh fish weighing between four and six pounds should be first washed in cold water and then put into boiling water enough to cover it, and con- taining one table-spoonful of salt. Simmer gently thirty minvites; then take up. A fish-kettle is a great conveni- ence, and it can be used also for boiling hams. When you do not have a fish-kettle, keep a piece of strong white cotton cloth in which pin the fish before putting into the boiling water. This will hold it in shape. Hard boiling will break the fish, and, of course, there wall be great waste, besides the dish not looking so handsome and appetizing. There should be a gentle bubbling of the water, and nothing more, all the time the fish is in it. A fish weighing more than six pounds should cook five minutes longer for every additional two pounds. Boiled fish can be served with a great variety of sauces. After you have learned to make them (which is a simple matter), if you cannot get a variety of fish you will not miss it particularly, the sauce and mode of serving doing much to change the whole character of the dish. Many people put a table-spoonful of vinegar in the water in which the fish is boiled. The fish flakes a little more readily for it. Small fish, like trout, require from four to eight minutes to cook. They are, however, much better baked, broiled, or fried. 3

49 ENTREES. Fillet of Beef in Jelly.—Trim a short fillet, and cut a deep incision in the side, being careful not to go through to the other side or the ends. Fill this with one cupful of veal, prepared as for quenelles, and the whites of three hard-boiled eggs, cut into rings.

Put in a deep stewpan two slices of ham and two of pork, and place the fillet on them; then put in two calf’s feet, two stalks of celery, and two quarts of clear stock. Simmer gently two hours and a half. Take up the fillet, and set away to cool. Strain the stock, and set away to harden.

When this boils season well with salt, and set back where it will just simmer for half an hour ; then strain through a napkin. Pour a little of the jelly into a two-quart charlotte russe mould (half an inch deep), and set on the ice to harden. As soon as it is hard, decorate with the egg rings. Add about three spoonfuls of the liquid jelly, to set the eggs. When hard add enough jelly to cover the eggs, and when this is also hard trim the ends of the fillet, and draw out the thread. Tlace in the centre of the mould, and cover with the remainder of the jelly. If the fillet floats, place a slight weight on it. Set in the ice 5

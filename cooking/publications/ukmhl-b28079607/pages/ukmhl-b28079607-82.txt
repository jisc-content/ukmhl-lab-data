If you wish, use also a slight grating of nutmeg, or a teaspoonful of lemon juice. Let the mixture cool slightly, then shape, roll in egg and crumbs, and fry.

Put the cream or stock on to boil. Mix the flour and butter together, and stir into the boiling cream ; then add the chicken and seasoning. Boil for two minutes, and add two of the eggs well beaten.

4 AMERICAN DISHES. Cheese Soup.—One and a half cupfuls of flour, one pint of rich cream, four table-spoonfuls of butter, four of grated Parmesan cheese, a speck of cayenne, two eggs, three quarts of clear soup stock. Mix flour, cream, butter, cheese, and pepper together. Place the basin in another of hot water and stir until the mixture becomes a smooth, firm paste.

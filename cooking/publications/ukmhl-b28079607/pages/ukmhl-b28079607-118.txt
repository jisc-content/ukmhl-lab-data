Sweet Potato Pies.—When the potatoes are dry and mealy, take a quart after they have been pared, boiled, and mashed, a quart of milk, four eggs, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, and sugar to taste. Bake the same as squash pies. If the potatoes are very moist, use less milk. Lemon Pie.—The juice and rind of one lemon, two eggs, eight heaping table-spoonfuls of sugar, one small teacupful of milk, one teaspoonful of corn-starch. Mix the corn- starch with a little of the milk. Put the remainder on the fire, and, when boiling, stir in the corn-starch. Boil one minute. Let this cool, and add the yolks of the eggs, four heaping table-spoonfuls of the sugar, and the grated rind and juice of the lemon, all well beaten together. Have a deep pie plate lined with paste, and fill with this mixture. Bake slowly half an hour. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and gradually beat into them the remainder of the sugar. Cover the pie with this, and brown slowly. Orange Pies.—Two cupfuls of sugar, two of flour, five eggs, one teaspoonful of cream of tartar, half a teaspoonful of soda, the juice and rind of one orange. These are for the cake. Beat the eggs very light; then add the sugar, and beat until frothy. Now add the orange. Mix the soda and cream of tartar with the flour, and rub through a sieve on to the beaten eggs and sugar. Stir well, and bake in deep tin plates. There will be enough for six plates. When baked, put a thin layer of the icing between the cakes, and cover the pie with icing. There should be three cakes in a pie. Icing: The whites of four eggs, one teacupful of pow- dered sugar, the juice and rind of two oranges. After beating the whites to a stiff froth, beat in the sugar and then the rind and juice' of the oranges. When the pies are iced, dry them in the heater.

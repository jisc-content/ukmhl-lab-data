POULTRY AND GAME. 45 to about three pints; by then straining and setting away to cool, and in the morning skimming off all the fat and turning off the clear stock. The bones may, instead, be used for a soup. Chicken Stew with Dumplings.—One chicken or fowl, weighing about three pounds ; one table-spoonful of butter, three of flour, one large onion, three slices of carrot, three of turnip, three pints of boiling water, and salt and pepper. Cut the chicken in slices suitable for serving. Wash, and put in a deep stewpan, add the water, and set on to boil. Put the carrot, turnip, and onion, cut fine, in a saucepan, with the butter, and cook slowly half an hour, stirring often; then take up the vegetables in a strainer, place the strainer in the stewpan with the chicken, and dip some of the water into it. Mash the vegetables with the back of a spoon, and rub as much qs possible through the strainer. Now skim two spoonfuls of chicken fat from the water, and put in the pan in which the vegetables were cooked. When boiling hot add the three table-spoonfuls of flour. Stir over the fire until a dark brown; then stir it in with the chicken, and simmer until tender. Season well with pepper and salt. The stew should only simmer all the while it is cooking. It must not boil hard. About two hours will be needed to cook a year old chicken. Twelve minutes before serving draw the stewpan forward, and boil up; then put in the dumplings, and cook ten minutes. Take them up, and keep in the heater while you are dishing the chicken into the centre of the platter. Afterwards, place the dump- lings around the edge. This is a very nice and economical dish, if pains be taken in preparing. One stewed chicken will go farther than two roasted. Potted Pigeons.—Clean and wash one dozen pigeons. Stand them on their necks in a deep earthen or porcelain pot, and turn on them a pint of vinegar. Cut three large

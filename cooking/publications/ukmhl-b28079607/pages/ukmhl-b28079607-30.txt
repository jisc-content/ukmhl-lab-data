Cod, haddock, and halibut are all cut in hand- some slices and fried in this manner; or, the slices can be well seasoned with salt and pepper, dipped in beaten egg, rolled in bread or cracker crumbs, and fried in boiling fat enough to cover. This method gives the handsomer dish, but the first the more savoury. Where Indian meal is not liked all flour can be used. Serve very hot. Any kind of fried fish can be served with black butter, but this is par- ticularly nice for that which is fried without pork. When the cooked fish is placed in the dish, pour the butter over it, garnish with parsley, and serve. To Cook Salt Codfish.—The fish should be thoroughly washed, and soaked in cold wrater over night. In the morning change the wrater, and put on to cook. As soon as the water comes to the boiling point set back where it will keep hot, but will -not boil. From four to six hours will cook a very dry, hard fish, and there are kinds which will cook in half an hour. Dropped Fish Balls.—One pint bowlful of raw fish, twTo heaping bowdfuls of pared potatoes (let the potatoes be under medium size), two eggs, butter the size of an egg, and a little pepper. Pick the fish very fine, and measure it lightly in the bowd. Put the potatoes into the boiler, and the fish on top of them ; then cover with boiling water, and boil half an hour. Drain off all the water, and mash fish and potatoes together until fine and light. Then add the butter and pepper, and the egg, well beaten. Have a deep kettle of failing iat. Dip a table-spoon in it, and then take up a spoonful of the mixture, having care to get it into as good shape as possible. Drop into the boiling fat, and cook until brown, which should be in twro minutes. Be careful not to crowd the balls, and, also, that the fat is hot enough. The spoon should be dipped in the fat every time you take a spoonful of the mixture. These balls are delicious.

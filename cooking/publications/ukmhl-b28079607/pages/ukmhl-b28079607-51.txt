43 POULTRY AND GAME. smooth bones, as, for instance, the breastbone and lower part of the sides. Work around the legs the same as you did around the wings, always using great care at the joints not to cut the skin. Drawing out the leg bones turns that part of the bird inside out. Turn the bird over, and proceed in the same manner with the other side. When all is detached carefully draw the skin from the breastbone; then run the knife between the fat and bone at the rump, leaving the small bone in the extreme end, as it holds the skewers. Carefully remove the flesh from the skeleton, and turn it right side out again. Rub into it two table-spoonfuls of salt and a little pepper, and fill with dressing. Sew up the back and neck and then the vent. Truss the same as if not boned. Take a strong piece of cotton cloth and pin the bird firmly in it, drawing very tight at the legs, as this is the broadest place, and the shape will not be good unless this precaution be taken. Steam three hours, and then place on a buttered tin sheet, which put in a baking-pan. Baste well with butter, pepper, salt, and flour. Roast one hour, basting every ten minutes, and twice with stock. When cold remove the skewers and strings, and garnish with aspic jelly, cooked beets, and parsley. To carve : First cut off the wings, then about two thick slices from the neck, where it will be quite fat, and then cut in thin slices. Serve jelly with each plate. Filling for a turkey weighing eight pounds : The flesh of one chicken weighing four pounds, one pound of clear veal, half a pound of clear salt pork, one small cupful of cracker crumbs, two eggs, one cupful of broth, two and a half table- spoonfuls of salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper, one tea- spoonful of summer savory, one of sweet marjoram, one of thyme, half a spoonful of sage, and, if you like, one table- spoonful of capers, one quart of oysters, and two table-spoon- fuls of onion juice.

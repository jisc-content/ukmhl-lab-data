Roast Turkey with Chestnut Stuffing and Sauce. —Clean the turkey, and lard the breast. Throw fifty large chestnuts into boiling water for a few minutes; then take them up, and rub off the thin, dark skin.

Do not try to take the bone from the next joint, as that is not in the way when carving, and it gives a more natural shape to the bird. Now begin at the wishbone, and when that is free from the flesh run the knife between the sides and the flesh, always using the fingers to press the meat from the

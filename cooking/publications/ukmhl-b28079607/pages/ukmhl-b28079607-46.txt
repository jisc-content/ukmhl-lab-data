38 AMERICAN DISHES. towel. Dredge on all sides with salt, pepper, and flour; and if the kitchen is used dredge the flour into that. Run the spit through the centre of the meat, and place very near the fire at first, turning as it browns. When the flour in the kitchen is browned add a pint of hot water, and baste fre- quently with it, dredging with salt and flour after each basting. Roast a piece of beef weighing eight pounds fifty minutes if to be rare, but if to be medium, roast one hour and a quarter, and ten minutes for each additional pound. Roasting in the Oven.â€”Prepare the meat as before. Have a rack that will fit loosely into the baking-pan. Cover the bottom of the pan rather lightly with flour, put in rack, and then meat. Place in a very hot oven for a few minutes, to brown the flour in the pan, and then add hot water enough to cover the bottom of the pan. Close the oven, and in about ten minutes open, and baste the meat with the gravy. Dredge with salt, pepper, and flour. Do this every fifteen minutes; and as soon as one side of the meat is brown, turn, and brown the other. Make gravy as before. Allow a quarter of an hour less in the oven than in the tin kitchen. The heat for roasting must be very great at first, to harden the albumen, and thus keep in the juices. After the meat is crusted over it is not necessary to keep up so great a heat, but for rare meats the heat must, of course, be greater than for those that are to be well done. The kitchen can be drawn back a little distance from the fire and the drafts closed. Putting salt on fresh meat draws out the juices, but by using flour a paste is formed, which keeps in all the juices and also enriches and browns the piece. Never roast meat with- out having a rack in the pan. If meat is put into the water in the pan it becomes soggy and loses its flavour. A meat-rack may be purchased for a very small amount, and

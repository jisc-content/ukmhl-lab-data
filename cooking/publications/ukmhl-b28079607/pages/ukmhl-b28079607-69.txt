In a three-pint mould put a layer of jelly about three-fourths of an inch deep. Set in ice water to harden. Have the chicken cut in long, thin strips, and well seasoned with salt and pepper; and when the jelly in the mould is hard, lay in the chicken, lightly, and cover with the liquid jelly, which should be cool, but not hard. Put away to harden. When ready to serve, dip the mould in warm water and then turn into the centre of a flat dish. Garnish with parsley, and, if you choose, with Tartare or mayonnaise sauce. Chicken Chaud Froid.â€”Skin two chickens, and cut in small pieces as for serving. Wash, and put them in a stew- pan with enough white stock to cover, and one large onion, a clove, half a blade of mace, a bouquet of sweet herbs, and half a table-spoonful of salt. Let this come to a boil; then skim carefully, and set back where it will simmer for one hour. Take up the chicken, and set the stewpan where the stock will boil rapidly. Put three table-spoonfuls of butter in the frying-pan, and when it melts stir in two table-spoonfuls of flour, and cook until smooth, but not brown. Stir this into the stock, of which there must be not more than a pint; add four table-spoonfuls of glaze, and boil up once. Taste to see if seasoned enough; if it is not, add more salt and pepper. Now add half a cupful of cream, and let boil up once more. Have the chicken in a deep dish. Pour this sauce on it, and set away to cool. At serving time, have large slices of cold-boiled sweet potatoes, fried in butter till a golden brown, handsomely arranged on a warm dish. On them place the chicken, which must be very cold. On each piece of the meat put a small tea- spoonful of Tartare sauce. Heap the potatoes around the edge of the dish, garnish with parsley, and serve.

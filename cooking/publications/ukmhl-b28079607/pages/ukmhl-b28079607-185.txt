177 BREAKFAST AND TEA. Meat Hash.—Chop rather fine any kind of cold meat; corned beef is, however, the best. To each pint add one pint and a half of cold-boiled potatoes, chopped fine; one table-spoonful of butter, and one cupful of stock; or, if no stock is on hand, two-thirds of a cupful of hot water. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Put the mixture in a frying- pan and stir over the fire for about eight minutes, being careful not to burn. Spread smoothly. Cover the pan and set back where the hash will brown slowly. It will take about half an hour. When done, fold it like an omelet and turn on to a hot dish. Garnish with points of toast and parsley. Serve hot. If there are no cold potatoes, the same quantity of hot-mashed potatoes may be used. Vegetable Hash.—Chop, not very fine, the vegetables left from a boiled dinner, and season them with salt and pepper. To each quart of the chopped vegetables add halt a cupful of stock and one table-spoonful of butter. Heat, slowly in the frying-pan. Turn into a hot dish when done,, and serve immediately. If vinegar is liked, two or more table-spoonfuls of it can be stirred into the hash while it is, heating. Breaded Sausages.—Wipe the sausages dry. Dip them in beaten egg and bread crumbs. Put them in the frying- basket and plunge into boiling fat. Cook ten minutes* Serve with a garnish of toasted bread and parsley. 13

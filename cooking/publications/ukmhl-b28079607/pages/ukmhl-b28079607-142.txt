134 AMERICAN DISHES. two-quart charlotte russe mould lightly, and put the custard in it. Put the mould in a basin of warm (not hot) water and bake slowly until the custard is firm in the centre. It should take forty minutes; but if the oven is quite hot, it will be done in thirty minutes. Test by putting a knife down into the centre, for if the custard is not milky, it is done. Set away in a cold place until serving time. It must be ice cold when eaten. Turn out on a flat dish, and pour caramel sauce over it. Royal Cream.—One quart of milk, one-third of a box of gelatine, four tablespoonfuls of sugar, three eggs, vanilla flavour. Put the gelatine in the milk, and let it stand for half an hour.

Have ready the whites of the eggs, beaten to a stiff froth; and the moment the kettle is taken from the fire stir them in, quickly, and turn into the moulds. Set away in a cold place to harden.

Lemon Sponge.—The juice of four lemons, four eggs, one cupful of sugar, half a package of gelatine, one generous pint of cold water. Soak the gelatine two hours in half a cupful of the water. Squeeze the lemons, and strain the juice on the sugar. Beat the yolks of the eggs and mix them with the remainder of the water. Add the sugar and lemon to this, and cook in the double boiler until it begins to thicken; then add the gelatine. Strain this mixture into a tin basin, which place in a pan of ice water. Beat with the whisk occasionally, until it has cooled, but not hardened. Now add the unbeaten whites of the eggs, and beat all the time until the mixture begins to thicken. Let it thicken almost

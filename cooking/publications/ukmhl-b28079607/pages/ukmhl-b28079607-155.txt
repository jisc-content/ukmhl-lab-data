Nesselrode Pudding.—One pint of shelled almonds, one pint and a half of shelled chestnuts, one pint of cream, a pint can of pineapple, the yolks of ten eggs, half a pound of French candied fruit, one table-spoonful of vanilla ex- tract, four of wine, one pint of water, one of sugar. Boil the chestnuts half an hour; then rub off the black skins, and pound in the mortar until a paste. Blanch the almonds, and pound in the same manner. Boil the sugar, water, and juice from the pineapple for twenty minutes in a saucepan. Beat the yolks of the eggs, and stir them into the syrup. Put the saucepan in another of boiling water and beat the mixture, with an egg beater, until it thickens. Take off, place in a basin of cold water, and beat for ten minutes. Mix the almonds and chestnuts with the cream, and rub all through a sieve. Add the candied fruit and the pineapple, cut fine. Mix this with the cooked mixture. Add the flavour and half a teaspoonful of salt. Freeze the same as ice cream. Lemon Sherbet.—The juice of five lemons, one pint of sugar, one quart of water, one table-spoonful of gelatine. Soak the gelatine in a little of the water. Boil one cupful of the water, and dissolve the gelatine in it. Mix together the sugar, water, gelatine, and lemon juice. Turn into the can, and freeze. This is light and creamy. Lemon Sherbet, No. 2.—One pint and a half of sugar, three pints of water, the juice of ten lemons. Boil the sugar and water together twenty-five minutes. Add the lemon juice, and strain and freeze. This makes a smooth, rich sherbet. Orange Sherbet.—Make this the same as the lemon, using, however, ten oranges.

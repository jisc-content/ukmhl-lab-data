93 FLOUR. There is now in general use in America flour made by two different processes, by the old, or St. Louis, and the new, or Haxall. The Haxall flour is used mostly for bread and the old process for pastry, cake, etc. By the new process more starch and less of the outer coats, which contain much of the phosphates is retained; so that the flour makes a whiter and moister bread. This flour packs closer than that made in the old way, so that a pound of it will not measure as much as a pound of the old kind. In using an old rule, one-eighth of this flour should be left out. For instance, if in a recipe for bread you have four quarts (old process) of flour given, of the new process you would take only three and a half quarts. This flour does not make as good cake and pastry as the old process. It is, therefore, well, to have a barrel of each, if you have space, for the pastry flour is the cheaper, and the longer all kinds of flour are kept in a dry place, the better they are. Graham.—The best Graham flour is made by grinding good wheat and not sifting it. Much that is sold is a poor quality of flour mixed with bran. This will not, of course, make good, sweet bread. The “ Arlington Whole Wheat Meal” is manufactured from pure wheat, and makes delicious bread. Graham, like flour, will keep in a cool, dry place for years.

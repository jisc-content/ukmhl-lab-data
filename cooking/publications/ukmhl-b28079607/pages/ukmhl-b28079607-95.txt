87 SALADS. twenty minutes. When cold, cut in thin slices. Season and set away the same as salmon. Serve the same as salmon, except omit the capers, and use chopped pickled beet. Salads of Fish.—All kinds of cooked fish can be served in salads. Lettuce is the best green salad to use with them, but all green vegetables, when cooked and cold, can be added to the fish and dressing. The sardine and French dressings are the best to use with fish. Polish Salad.—One quart of cold game or poultry, cut very fine; the French dressing, four hard-boiled eggs, one large, or two small heads of lettuce. Moisten the meat with the dressing, and let it stand in the ice-chest two or three hours. Rub the yolks of the eggs to a powder, and chop the whites very fine. Wash the lettuce and put in the ice-chest until serving time. When ready to serve, put the lettuce leaves together and cut in long, narrow strips with a sharp knife, or tear it with a fork. Arrange on a dish, heap the meat in the centre, and sprinkle the egg over all. Beef Salad.—One quart of cold roasted or stewed beef— it must be very tender, double the rule for French dressing, one table-spoonful of chopped parsley, and one of onion juice, to be mixed with the dressing. Cut the meat in thin slices, and then into little squares. Place a layer in the salad bowl, sprinkle with parsley and dressing, and continue this until all the meat is used. Garnish with parsley, and keep in a cold place for one or two hours. Any kind of meat can be used instead of beef. Meat and Potato Salad.—Prepare the meat as directed for beef salad, using, however, one-half the quantity. Add one pint of cold-boiled potatoes, cut in thin slices, and dressing. Garnish, and set away as before. These salads can be used as soon as made, but the flavour is improved by their standing an hour or more.

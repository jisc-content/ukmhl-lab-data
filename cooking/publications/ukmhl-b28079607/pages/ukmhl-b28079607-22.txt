AMERICAN DISHES. 14 fifteen minutes, stir this in, and cook eight minutes more. Add the parsley, pepper, and salt, and cook three minutes longer. Now add the clams. Cook one minute longer, and serve. This gives a very delicate soup, as the liquor from the clams is not used. Fish Chowder.—Five pounds of any kind of fish (the light salt-water fish is the best), half a pound of pork, two large onions, one quart of sliced potatoes, one quart of water, one pint of milk, two table-spoonfuls of flour, six crackers or biscuits, salt, pepper. Skin the fish, and cut all the flesh from the bones. Put the bones on to cook in the quart of water, and simmer gently ten minutes. Fry the pork; then add the onions, cut into slices. Cover, and cook five minutes; then add the flour, and cook eight minutes longer, stirring often. Strain on this the water in which the fish bones were cooked and boil gently for five minutes; then strain all on the potatoes and fish. Season with salt and pepper, and simmer fifteen minutes. Add the milk and the crackers, which were first soaked for three minutes in the milk. Let it boil up once, and serve. The milk may be omitted, and a pint of tomatoes used, if you like. Corn Chowder.—Enough green corn to make a quart; pare and slice one quart of potatoes; pare and slice two onions. Cut half a pound of pork in slices, and fry until brown; then take up, and fry the onions in the fat. Put the potatoes and. corn into the kettle in layers, sprinkling each layer with salt, pepper, and flour. Use half a tea- spoonful of pepper, one and a half table-spoonfuls of salt, and three of flour. Place the gravy strainer on the vege- tables, and turn the onions and pork fat into it, and with a spoon press the juice through; then slowly pour one and one-fourth quarts of boiling water through the strainer, rub- bing as much onion through as possible. Take out the strainer, cover the kettle, and boil gently foi twenty minutes.

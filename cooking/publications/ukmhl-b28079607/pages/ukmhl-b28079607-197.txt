BREAKFAST AND EA. 189 half a cupful of sugar, half a cake of compressed yeast, or half a cupful of liquid yeast; one cupful of milk, half a tea- spoonful of salt, four table-spoonfuls of butter, five cupfuls of flour. Dissolve the yeast in a scant half-cupful of cold water. Mix it and the milk, butter, sugar, salt, and squash together, and stir into the flour. Knead well, and let it rise over night. In the morning shape into biscuit. Let these rise an hour and a half, and bake them half an hour. Snow Pancakes.—Half a pint of milk, an egg, an apple, pared, quartered, and chopped very fine; a cupful and a half of flour, one-fourth of a teaspoonful of salt, a bowl of snow. Beat the egg light, and add the milk to it. Pour gradually on the flour, and beat until smooth and light. Add the apple and salt, and at the last moment the snow. Drop by spoonfuls into boiling fat, and cook until a rich brown. Waffles.—One pint of sifted flour, milk enough to make a thin batter (about two-thirds of a pint), two eggs, beaten very light; a table-spoonful of melted butter, and a little salt. Gradually mix the milk with the flour until there is a smooth paste; then add the salt and butter, and lastly the eggs. Have waffle irons about as hot as a griddle for cakes, and butter them well, or grease with pork as you would a griddle. Pour in enough of the batter to cover an iron, and put the other side gently down upon it. Keep over the fire about half a minute; then turn over, and let the other ■ side remain to the fire the same time. Remove, and place the waffles where they will keep warm until enough are cooked to serve. Many people butter the waffles as they place them on the dish, and others add sugar. This is very well if known to be to the taste of the family, but it is always safe to let each suit himself at the table. Waffles, No. 2.—One pint of milk, two eggs, two table-

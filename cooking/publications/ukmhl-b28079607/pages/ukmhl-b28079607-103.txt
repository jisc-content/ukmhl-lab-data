95 VEGETABLES. Potato Puffs,—Prepare the potatoes as directed for mashed potato. While hot, shape in balls about the size of an egg. Have a tin sheet well buttered, and place the balls on it. As soon as all are done, brush over with beaten egg. Brown in the oven. When done, slip a knife under them and slide them upon a hot platter. Garnish with parsley, and serve immediately. Riced Potato.—Have a flat dish and the colander hot. With a spoon rub mashed potato through the colander on to the hot dish. Be careful that the colander does not touch the potato on the dish. It is best to have only a few spoon- fuls of the potato in at one time. When all has been pressed through, place the dish in the oven for five minutes. Potato a la Royale.—One pint of hot-boiled potatoes, a generous half-cupful of cream or milk, two table-spoonfuls of butter, the whites of four eggs and yolk of one, salt and pepper to taste. Beat the potato very light and fine. Add the seasoning, milk, and butter, and lastly the whites of the eggs, beaten to a stiff froth. Turn into a buttered escallop dish. Smooth with a knife and brush over with the yolk of the egg, which has been well beaten. Brown quickly, and serve. It will take ten minutes to brown. The dish in which it is baked should hold a little more than a quart. Potatoes a l’ltalienne.—Prepare the potatoes as for serving a la royale. Add one table-spoonful of onion juice

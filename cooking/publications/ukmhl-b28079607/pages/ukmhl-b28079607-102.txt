The common kind, which is made by grinding between two mill-stones, retains a great deal of moisture, and, in hot weather, will soon grow musty; but the granulated meal will keep for any length of time. The corn for this meal is first dried ; and it takes about two years for this. Then the outer husks are removed, and the corn is ground by a process that pro- duces grains like granulated sugar. After once using this meal one will not willingly go back to the old kind. Indian meal is made from two kinds of corn, Northern and Southern. The former gives the yellow meal, and is much richer than the Southern, of which white meal is made. Rye Meal.—This meal, like the old-process Indian, will grow musty in a short time in hot weather, so that but a small quantity of it should be bought at a time. The meal is much better than the flour for all kinds of bread and muffins. Cracked Wheat.—This is the whole wheat just crushed or cut like the coarse oatmeal, but unlike the meal. It will keep a long time. It is cooked the same as oatmeal. That which is cut makes a handsomer dish than the crushed, but the latter cooks more quickly. Hominy.—This is made from corn, and it comes in a number of sizes, beginning with samp and ending with a grade nearly as fine as coarse-granulated sugar. The finest grade is really the best, so many nice dishes can be made with it which you cannot make with the coarse. Hominy will keep a long time, and it can be bought in five-pound package or by the barrel.

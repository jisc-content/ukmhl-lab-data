AMERICAN DISHES. 30 The oysters can, instead, be opened into a hot dish and seasoned with butter, salt, pepper, and lemon juice. They should be served immediately. Little Pigs in Blankets.—Season large oysters with salt and pepper. Cut fat English bacon in very thin slices, wrap an oyster in each slice, and fasten with a little wooden skewer (toothpicks are the best things). Heat a frying-pan and put in the “little pigs.” Cook just long enough to crisp the bacon—about two minutes. Place on slices of toast that have been cut into small pieces, and serve immediately. Do not remove the skewers. This is a nice relish for lunch or tea; and, garnished with parsley, is a pretty one. The pan must be very hot before the “ pigs ” are put in, and then great care must be taken that they do not burn. Fricasseed Oysters.—One hundred oysters (about two quarts), four large table-spoonfuls of butter, one teaspoonful of chopped parsley, one table-spoonful of flour, a speck of cayenne, salt, yolks of three eggs. Brown two table-spoon- fuls of the butter, and add to it the paisley, cayenne, and salt, and the oysters, well drained. Mix together the flour and the remainder of the butter, and stir into the oysters when they begin to curl. Then add yolks, well beaten, and take immediately from the fire. Serve on a hot dish with a garnish of fried bread and parsley. Creamed Oysters.—A pint of cream, one quart of oysters, a small piece of onion, a very small piece of mace, a table- spoonful of flour, and salt and pepper to taste. Let the cream, with the onion and mace, come to a boil. Mix flour with a little cold milk or cream, and stir into the boiling cream. Let the oysters come to a boil in their own liquor, and skim carefully. Drain off all the liquor, and turn the oysters into the cream. Skim out the mace and onions, and serve.

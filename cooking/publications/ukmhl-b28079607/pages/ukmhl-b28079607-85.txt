Chicken Patties.—Prepare the cream the same as for oysters, and add to it one pint of cold chicken, cut into dice. Boil three minutes. Fill the shells and serve. Where it is liked, one teaspoonful of onion juice is an improvement. Other poultry and all game can be served in patties the same as chicken. Veal Patties.—Put in a stewpan a generous half-pint of white sauce with a pint of cooked veal, cut into dice, and a teaspoonful of lemon juice. Stir until very hot. Fill the shells, and serve. Lobster Patties.—One pint of lobster, cut into dice ; half a pint of white sauce, a speck of cayenne, one-eighth of a teaspoonful of mustard. Heat all together. Fill the shells and serve. Oyster Patties.—One pint of small oysters, half a pint of cream, a large teaspoonful of flour, salt, pepper. Let the cream come to a boil. Mix the flour with a little cold milk, and stir into the boiling cream. Season with salt and pepper. While the cream is cooking let the oysters come to a boil in their own liquor. Skim carefully, and drain off all the liquor. Add the oysters to the cream, and boil up once. Fill the patty shells, and serve. The quantities given are enough for eighteen shells. Crust Patties.—Cut a loaf of stale bread in slices an inch thick. With the patty cutter press out as many pieces as you wish patties, and with a smaller cutter press half through each piece. Place this second cutter as near the centre as possible when using. Put the pieces in the frying basket and plunge into boiling fat for half a minute. Take out and drain, and with a knife remove the centre crusts and take out the soft bread ; then fill, and put on the centre pieces.

IOI VEGETABLES. Fried Tomatoes.—Slice ripe tomatoes and dip them in well-beaten eggs, which have been seasoned with salt, pepper, and sugar (one teaspoonful of sugar to each egg), and then in fine bread or cracker crumbs. Have two table-spoonfuls of butter in a frying-pan, and when hot put in as many slices of tomato as will cover the bottom. Fry for ten minutes, five for each side. Serve on thin slices of toast. To Peel Tomatoes.—Put the tomatoes in a frying basket and plunge them into boiling water for about three minutes. Drain and peel. Baked Onions.—Peel large onions, and boil one hour in plenty of water, slightly salted. Butter a shallow dish or a deep plate, and arrange the onions in it. Sprinkle with pepper and salt, put a teaspoonful of butter in the centre of each onion, and cover lightly with crumbs. Bake slowly one hour. Serve with cream sauce. Stuffed Onions.—Boil as for baking. Cut out the heart of the onions, and fill the space with any kind of cold meat, chopped fine, and highly seasoned. To each pint of meat add one egg and two-thirds of a cupful of milk or cream. When the onions are filled put a bit of butter (about a tea- spoonful) on each one. Cover with crumbs, and bake one hour. Serve with cream sauce. Parsnips Fried in Butter.—Scrape the parsnips, and boil gently forty-five minutes. When cold, cut in long slices about one-third of an inch thick. Season with salt and pepper. Dip in melted butter and in flour. Have two table-spoonfuls of butter in the frying-pan, and, as soon as hot, put in enough parsnips to cover the bottom. Fry brown on both sides, and serve on a hot dish. Parsnips Fried in Molasses.—Have one cupful of mo- lasses in a large frying-pan. When boiling, put in slices of parsnips that have been seasoned with salt, and cooled. Fry brown and serve hot.

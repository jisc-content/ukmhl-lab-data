153 DESSERT. Charlotte Russe.—Ten eggs, one cupful of sugar, four table-spoonfuls of wine, one of vanilla extract, a package of gelatine, one and a half cupfuls of milk, one pint of cream. Soak the gelatine in half a cupful of the milk. Beat the yolks of the eggs and the sugar together, and put in the double boiler with the remaining milk. Stir until the mixture begins to thicken; then add the gelatine, and strain into a large tin basin. Place this in a pan of ice water, and, when it begins to cool, add the whites of the eggs, well beaten, the wine and flavour, and the whipped cream. Mix thoroughly, and pour into moulds that have been lined with sponge cake. Set away to harden. With the quantities given two quart moulds can be filled. The lining may be one piece of sponge cake, or strips of it, or lady-fingers. The wine may be omitted. Charlotte Russe, No. 2.—One pint of rich cream, one teaspoonful of vanilla flavour, one-third of a cupful of sugar. Mix all together in a tin pail and place in a basin of ice water. Whip the cream to a stiff froth, and skim into a colander. When nearly whipped, return to the pail that which has drained through the colander, and whip it again. Have a quart mould lined with stale sponge cake. Fill it with whipped cream and set in the ice-chest for an hour or two.

Pour half a cupful of boiling water upon the gelatine, stir until thoroughly dissolved, and pour upon the apple; then add the sugar and lemon juice. Place in a basin of ice water, and beat until it begins to thicken. Add the whites of the eggs, beaten to a stiff froth. Pour into a two-quart mould, which has been lined with sponge cake,

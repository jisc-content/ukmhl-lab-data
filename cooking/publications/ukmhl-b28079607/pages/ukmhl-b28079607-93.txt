SALADS. 35 this, with a sharp knife, in pieces about half an inch thick. Put these in the ice-chest until serving time. Make the mayonnaise dressing. Mix the chicken and celery together and add half of the dressing. Arrange in a salad bowl or on a flat dish, and pour the remainder of the dressing over it. Garnish with white celery leaves.

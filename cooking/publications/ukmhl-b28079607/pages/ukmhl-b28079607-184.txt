AMERICAN DISHES. 176 Caramel Frosting.—One cupful of brown sugar, one square of chocolate, scraped fine; one table-spoonful of water. Simmer gently twenty minutes, being careful not to let it burn. Spread on the cake while hot. Golden Frosting.—Into the yolks of two eggs stir pow- dered sugar enough to thicken, and flavour strongly with lemon. This does not have so good a flavour as other kinds of frosting, but it makes a change. Marking Cakes in Gold.—Bake round cakes for the children, and, when the frosting on them is hard, dip a small brush into the yolk of an egg, and write a word or name upon the cake. It pleases the little ones very much.

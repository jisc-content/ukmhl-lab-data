AMERICAN DISHES. 66 parsley, and serve. Poultry cutlets can be prepared and served in the same way. Cutlets & la Duchesse.—Two pounds of lamb, mutton or veal cutlets, one large cupful of cream, one table-spoonful of onion juice, four table-spoonfuls of butter, one of flour, two whole eggs, the yolks of four more, two table-spoonfuls of finely-chopped ham, one of lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Put two table-spoonfuls of the butter in the frying- pan. Season the cutlets with salt and pepper, and when the butter is hot put them in it. Fry gently for five minutes, if lamb or mutton; but if veal, put a cover on the pan, and fry very slowly for fifteen minutes. Set away to cool. Put the remainder of the butter in a small frying-pan, and when hot stir in the flour. Cook one minute, stirring all the time, and being careful not to brown. Stir in the cream. Have the ham, the yolks of eggs, and the onion and lemon juice beaten together. Stir this mixture into the boiling sauce. Stir for about one minute, and remove from the fire. Season well with pepper and salt. Dip the cutlets in this sauce, being careful to cover every part, and set away to cool. When cold, dip them in beaten egg and in bread crumbs. Fry in boiling fat for one minute. Arrange them in a circle on a hot dish, and have green peas in the centre, and cream sauce poured around. Stewed Steak with Oysters.—Two pounds of rump steak, one pint of oysters, one table-spoonful of lemon juice, three of butter, one of flour, salt, pepper, one cupful of water. .Wash the oysters in the water, and drain into a stewpan. Put this liquor on to heat. As soon as it comes to a boil, skim, and set back. Put the butter in a frying-pan, and when hot, put in the steak. Cook ten minutes. Take up the steak, and stir the flour into the butter remaining in the pan. Stir until a dark brown. Add the oyster liquor, and boil one minute. Season with salt and pepper. Put back

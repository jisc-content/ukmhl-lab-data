Butter such a dish, as you would use for escalloped oysters. Put in one layer of fish, then moisten well with sauce; add more fish and sauce, and finally cover with fine bread crumbs. Bake half an hour. The dish should be rather shallow, allowing only two layers of fish. Sauce for an gratin: One pint of stock, three table-spoon- fuls of butter, two of flour, juice of half a lemon, half a table- spoonful of chopped parsley, a slice of onion—the size of half a crown, and about as thick—chopped very fine (one table-spoonful of onion juice is better); one table-spoonful of vinegar, salt, pepper. Heat the butter in a small frying- pan, and when hot add the dry flour. Stir constantly until a rich brown; then add, gradually, the cold stock, stirring all the time. As soon as it boils, season well with salt and pepper, and then add the other seasoning.

Another way to serve fish an gratin is to skin it, cut off the head, and take out the backbone; and there are then two large pieces of fish. Season the fish, and prepare the sauce as before. Butter a tin sheet that will fit loosely into a large baking-pan. Lay the fish on this, and moisten well with the sauce. Cover thickly with bread crumbs, and cook twenty-five minutes in a rather quick oven. Then slip on a hot dish, and serve with tomato, Tartare, or Hollandaise sauce poured around the fish. OYSTERS.

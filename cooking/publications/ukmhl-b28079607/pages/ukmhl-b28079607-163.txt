DESSERT. 155 sugar, strain through a napkin, and turn into moulds. When cold, place in the refrigerator for six or eight hours. Lemon Jelly.—Two cupfuls of sugar, one of lemon juice, one quart of boiling water, one cupful of cold water, a box of gelatine. Soak the gelatine in the cold water for two hours. Pour the boiling water on it, add the sugar and lemon juice, strain through a napkin, mould and harden. Orange Jelly.—One box of gelatine, one pint of orange juice, the juice of a lemon, one pint of sugar, a pint and a half of boiling water, half a pint of cold water, the white and shell of an egg.

Strawberry Jelly.—Three pints of ripe strawberries, a box of gelatine, a pint of sugar, one pint of boiling water, half a pint of cold water, the juice of a lemon. Soak the gelatine for two hours in the cold water. Mash the berries with the sugar, and let them stand two hours. Pour the boiling water on the fruit and sugar. Press the juice from the strawberries and add it and the lemon juice to the dis- solved gelatine. Strain through a napkin, pour into moulds, and harden. Raspberry jelly is made in the same way. Pineapple Jelly.—A pint-and-a-half can of pineapple, a scant pint of sugar, the white and shell of an egg, a box of

175 CAKES. chocolate eclairs. They may be filled with cream sweetened, flavoured with vanilla, and whipped to a stiff froth. Straw- berry and raspberry preserves are sometimes used to fill eclairs. They are then named after the fruit with which they are filled. Frosting.—The white of one egg, one teacupful of pow- dered sugar, one table-spoonful of lemon juice. Put the white of the egg in a bowl and add the sugar by degrees, beating with a spoon. When all has been added, stir in the lemon juice. If the white of the egg is large it will require a very full cup of sugar, and, if small, a rather scant cupful. The egg must not be beaten until the sugar is added. This gives a smooth, tender frosting, which will cover one small sheet of cake. The same amount of material, prepared with the whites of the eggs unbeaten, will make one-third less frosting than it will if the eggs are beaten to a stiff froth before adding the sugar; but the icing will be much smoother and softer to pay for the extra quantity. It may be flavoured with half a teaspoonful of vanilla. Chocolate Icing.—Two squares of chocolate, the whites of two eggs, two cupfuls of powdered sugar, four table- spoonfuls of boiling water. Beat one and two-thirds cupfuls of the sugar into the unbeaten whites of the eggs. Scrape the chocolate, and put it and the remaining third of a cupful of sugar and the water in a small frying-pan. Stir over a hot fire until smooth and glossy, and then stir into the beaten whites and sugar. With the quantity given two sheets of cake can be iced. Chocolate Icing, No. 2.—Soak a teaspoonful of gelatine one or two hours in three table-spoonfuls of water. Pour on it one-fourth of a cupful of boiling water, and stir into it one and two-thirds cupfuls of powdered sugar. Prepare two squares of chocolate as for the first icing, and stir them into this mixture. Use immediately.

It should be in the ice chest at least an hour before being used. In hot weather if the paste sticks when being rolled down put it on a tin sheet and place on ice. As soon as it is chilled it will roll easily. The less flour you use in rolling out the paste the tenderer it will be. No matter how carefully every part of the work may be done, the paste will not be good if much flour is used. Chopped Paste.—One quart of pastry flour, two cupfuls of unwashed butter, one teaspoonful of salt, one table- spoonful of sugar, and a scant cupful of ice water. Put the flour, salt, sugar, and butter in the chopping-tray. Chop all together until the butter is thoroughly mixed with the flour; then add the water, and continue chopping. When well mixed sprinkle the board with flour, turn the paste on it, and roll into a flat piece. Place in a pan on the ice. When hard, use the same as puff paste. It can be used as soon as mixed, but will not, of course, be so nice.

Rub the butter, salt, and sugar into the flour. Beat the egg, and add the water to it. Stir this into the flour and butter. Stir this mixture until it is a smooth paste; then put on the board and roll the same as puff paste. This paste must be rolled eight times. To Make a Pie.—Butter the pie plate (tin is the best), and cover with paste that has been rolled very thin. Roll a strip of paste long enough to go around the plate, and cut in strips an inch wide. Wet the edge of the plate with water, and put a strip of paste on it. Fill with any kind of prepared fruit. Have the paste in a roll, and cut enough from the end to cover the pie.

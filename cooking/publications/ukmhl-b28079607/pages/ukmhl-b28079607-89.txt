81 SALADS. red cabbage, celery, cucumber, and potato salads, are particu- larly appropriate for serving with meats. The lettuce salad, with the French dressing, and the dressed celery, are the best to serve after the meats. A rich salad, like chicken, lobster, or salmon, is out of place at a company dinner. It is best served for suppers and lunches. The success of a salad (after the dressing is made) depends upon keeping the lettuce or celery crisp and not adding meat or dressing to it until the time for serving. A Mayonnaise Dressing.—A table-spoonful of mustard, one of sugar, one-tenth of a teaspoonful of cayenne, one teaspoonful of salt, the yolks of three uncooked eggs, the juice of half a lemon, a quarter of a cupful of vinegar, a pint of oil, and a cupful of whipped cream. Beat the yolks and dry ingredients, until they are very light and thick, with either a silver or wooden spoon—or, better still, with a Dover beater of second size. The bowl in which the dressing is made should be set in a pan of ice water during the beating. Add a few drops of oil at a time until the dressing becomes very thick and rather hard. After it has reached this stage the oil can be added more rapidly. When it gets so thick that the beater turns hard, add a little vinegar. When the last of the oil and vinegar has been added it should be very thick. Now add the lemon juice and whipped cream, and place on ice for a few hours, unless you are ready to use it. The cream may be omitted without injury. Salad Dressing made at the Table.—The yolk of a raw egg, a table-spoonful of mixed mustard, one-fourth of a tea- spoonful of salt, six table-spoonfuls of oil. Stir the yolk, mustard, and salt together with a fork until they begin to thicken. Add the oil gradually, stirring all the while. More or less oil can be used. Cream Salad Dressing.—Two eggs, three table-spoonfuls 7

When hard, serve with a custard flavoured with lemon. Bird’s Nest Pudding.—Half a package of gelatine, six oranges, three cupfuls and a half of sugar, one pint of blanc- mange. Take the peel from the oranges in quarters. Put it in two quarts of water, and let it stand over night. In the morning drain off the water. Cut the peel in thin strips with the scissors.

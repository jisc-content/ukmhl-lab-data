Cover the roll with flour, and fry brown in four table- spoonfuls of ham or pork fat. Put it in as small a sauce- pan as will hold it. Into the fat remaining in the pan put two finely-chopped onions, and cook until a pale yellow; then add two table-spoonfuls of flour, and stir three minutes longer.

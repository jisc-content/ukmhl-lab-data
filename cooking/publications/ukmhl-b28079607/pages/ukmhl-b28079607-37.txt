FISH. 29 toast buttered, and on a hot dish. Put the butter in a small saucepan, and when hot add the dry flour. Stir until smooth, but not brown ; then add the cream, and let it boil up once. Put the oysters (in their own liquor) into a hot oven, for three minutes; then add them to the cream. Season, and pour over the toast. Garnish the dish with thin slices of lemon, and serve very hot. It is nice for lunch or tea. Oysters Panned in their Own Liquor.—Eighteen large, or thirty small, oysters, one table-spoonful of butter, one of cracker crumbs, salt and pepper to taste, one teaspoonful of lemon juice, a speck of cayenne. Put the oysters on in their own liquor, and when they boil up add seasoning, butter, and crumbs. Cook one minute, and serve on toast. Oysters Panned in the Shell.—Wash the shells and wipe dry. Place them in a pan with the round shell down. Set in a hot oven for three minutes; then take out, and remove the upper shell. Put two or three oysters into one of the round shells, season with pepper and salt, add butter the size of two peas, and cover with cracker or bread crumbs. Return to the oven and brown. Oyster Saut£.—Two dozen large, and three dozen small oysters, two table-spoonfuls of butter, four of fine cracker crumbs, salt, pepper. Let the oysters drain in the colander. Then season with salt and pepper, and roll in the crumbs. Have the butter very hot in a frying-pan, and put in enough of the oysters to cover the bottom of the pan. Fry crisp and brown, being careful not to burn. Serve on hot, crisp toast. Oysters Roasted in the Shell.—Wash the shells clean, and wipe dry. Place in a baking-pan, and put in a hot oven for about twenty minutes. Serve on hot dishes the moment they are taken from the oven. Though this is not an elegant dish many people enjoy it, as the first and best flavour of the oysters is retained in this manner of cooking.

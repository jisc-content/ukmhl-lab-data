To preferve ORANGES carved. TAKE the largeft thick-rinded Seville oranges y6u can get, let them be clear from fpots, and cut the rinds with a pen-knife in what forms you pleafe; draw out the part of the peel as you cut them,—-cut a round hole at the ftalk end, the bignefs of fixpence, and take out the feeds with the lhank of a tea-lpoon; put them into water for two days and nights, changing them once a-day to take off the bitter; take them out, and weigh them,— put them on to boil in a pan full of water, taking care they do not break. To every pound of oran- ges put one pound and a half of double-refined fu- gar, clarify it,—put in the oranges, and let them boil for twelve minutes, then fet them by for twelve days, warming them up twice in that time. Add to them the juice of two lemons, with the rind cut in flraws and boiled tender; fet them on to boil till the oranges and fyrup look clear ; put them in- to fmall pots that will juft hold them, and pour the fyrup over them ; let the hole of the orange be down till you cover them, and then you mult turn it up, and put in the piece; lay fome brandy paper on them, and cover them with bladder and paper as before. m You may preferve whole oranges without carv- ing, the fame way.

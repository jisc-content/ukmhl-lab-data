When you make foup-la-rain, lay your veal and ham in the bottom of a ftew-pan, with a piece of butter and the roots on the top ; it muft be fet over a flow fire to draw, and when the gravy is fimmered away, add to it your flock, as the receipt directs: if you have no flock, put to it fome boiling wa- ter.

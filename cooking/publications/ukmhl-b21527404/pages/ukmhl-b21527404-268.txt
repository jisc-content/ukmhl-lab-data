( 2(52 ) ICING for a Plumb Cake. BEAT a pound and a half of treble refined fugar, lift it through a fine fieve, and put it into a bowl, with the whites of five eggs well whilked, a bit of gum-dragon (half the fize of a nutmeg) dif- folved in rofe water ; whifk it an hour, till it grows white and thick,—if it is thin, it will run off the cake. When the cake is baked, take it out of the pan, and put it on a tin ; then fpread on half of the icing with a knife, dry it in the oven,—take it out, and fpread on the other half, then dry it as before. I'his will make it look much whiter than laying it on at once. A PLUMB CAKE.

( 3J ) To To roajl a PIG. STICK your pig juft above the breaft bone, and run the knife to the heart; when it is dead, put it in cold water for a few minutes, take it out, and rub it with fome rofin beat very fine; put your pig into a pail of fcalding water for half a minute, take it out, lay it on a clean table, and pluck off the hair as quick as poflible ; if it does not come clean off, dip it into the water till it does ; when you have got all clean off, wafti it well in water to take away the fmell of the rofin. Take off the four feet at the firft joint, make a flit down the belly, take out the entrails and back-gut, wafli it well, and dry it, and lay it on its belly in a difli. When you roaft it, put into it a little fhred fage and parfley, a few crumbs of bread, pepper, and fait; few up the belly, rub it over with fweet oil, and lay it down to roaft before a good briik fire, with a pig plate in the middle of the fire ; when it is almoft done, take a cloth and wipe it clean, rub it over with cold butter to crifp it, and take care you do not let it blifter. When done, cut off the head, lay the pig in a difli, fplit it through the back before you draw the fpit, and lay it back to back in your difli ; cut off the ears, lay one on each flioulder, and the jaw-bones on each fide, then fcrve it up hot, with your fauce under it.

( 210 ) Observations on PIES and TARTS. AL L pies require a quick oven. Raifed pies re- quire to be made the night before they are baked, or they will fall-in the oven;—you muft put very little gravy in them, or it will force out, or crack the Tides of the pie ; but you mull warm your gravy, and pour it in when they come from the oven. PurF-pafte requires a quickifh oven, but not too hot, or it will burn it,—and in a flow oven it will not rife, but become fad. Tarts that are iced require a flow oven, as they are generally made of fugar pafte; if you put them into a quick oven, it will brown them before they be half baked:—But the bed way is to bake thofe tarta fil'd, then ice them, and put them into the oven for fifteen minutes to dry the icing,—then you will get it of a good colour; but if you rse them befoie they are baked, the icing will be too brown.

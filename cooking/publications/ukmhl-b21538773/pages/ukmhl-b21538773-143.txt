PUDDINGS AND SWEETS 127 and just beginning to set, whip in the white of egg. Serve in custard glasses. Tutti-frutti (Cold) 271 Boil all but a little of one and a half pints of milk with 1 oz. of sugar and a stick of vanilla. Mix the remainder of the milk smoothly with 1 oz. of cornflour. Beat up the yolks of three eggs and add to the milk and cornflour. Pour some stewed or bottled fruit into a glass dish, add a little rum. When the milk and vanilla boil, add the eggs and milk and cornflour very slowly and stir well, so that there are no lumps. Beat up the whites of the eggs, and when the custard has cooled mix them quickly in. Pour over the fruit and let it stand until quite cold. Pain of Pineapple (Very Good) (Cold) 272 Melt a pint packet of Chiversâ€™ pineapple jelly and add to it a few drops of pineapple essence. Then stir into it the yolks of four beaten-up eggs, add one and a half sheets of white leaf gelatine which has been dis- solved in water with a teaspoonful of lemon-juice. Place in a jug in a pan of boiling water and stir until the mixture thickens. Add a liqueur glass of rum. Pour into a ring mould and leave to set. Turn out and fill the centre with whipped cream, piled high and scattered with preserved violets broken into small pieces. This recipe may be made with almost any jelly, varying the liqueur to suit the flavouring.

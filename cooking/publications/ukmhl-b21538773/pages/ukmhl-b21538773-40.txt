THE SINGLE HANDED COOK 24 crushed shell of one egg, strain through a clean muslin, add about half a teaspoonful of Parisian essence and three drops of vanilla. Use when just beginning to set, but before it becomes lumpy. When using cooked bones it is necessary to add two to three sheets of gelatine for half a pint of glaze. Soak it in cold water, drain off the water, and add to the glaze after the fat is removed. If using raw bones, gelatine is unnecessary. Brown glaze may be bought by the ounce, but is con- siderably more expensive than that which is made at home. Brown Glaze (Hot) (For Cutlets, Fillets, etc.) 54 To make half a pint of glaze have a good half-pint of well flavoured brown stock. Mix one dessertspoonful of potato flour smoothly with a little cold stock. Add to the remainder of the stock and boil up for three minutes. Strain and keep hot until required. This sticks to the cutlets and makes them look well glazed. White Glaze (Hot) (For Chicken, Sweetbread or Veal Cutlets) 55 This is made in just the same way as the hot brown glaze, but white stock or milk is employed.

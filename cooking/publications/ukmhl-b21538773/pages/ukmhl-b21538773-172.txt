THE SINGLE HANDED COOK 156 pancake, but omit the sugar and flavour with salt. Fry in a tiny pan, so that the pancakes are small, Do not roll them, but fold them over like an omelette. Before folding place in each one a good spoonful of well fla- voured hot mince, or of peas, French beans, or stewed mushrooms. For pancakes, see page 148.r Poached Eggs a la Reine (Hot) 338 Poach as many fresh eggs as are required in water to which is added a spoonful of lemon-juice. Drain them on a cloth and dish up on rounds of fried bread. Pour some thick brown curry sauce over the eggs, scatter a little finely chopped parsley over each, and serve at once. Eggs and Ham Cutlets with Macaroni (Hot) 339 Grate the whites of four hard boiled eggs and pound them in a mortar with the yolks of the eggs and oz. of butter ; add a heaped teaspoonful of potted ham, moisten the paste with a little cream, and season it with salt and black pepper. Divide the mixture, and shape it on a floured board into the form of cutlets. Dip them into some beaten egg and cover them thickly with fine breadcrumbs ; leave them for a quarter of an hour and then fry the cutlets in plenty of boiling fat. Boil some straight pipe macaroni until it is tender, and cut it up into small pieces about half an inch in length ; then re-heat it in a small quantity of parsley sauce. Arrange the cutlets round a hot dish, and put the macaroni in the middle.

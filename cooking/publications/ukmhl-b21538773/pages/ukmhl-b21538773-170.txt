THE SINGLE HANDED COOK 154 oontents until the mixture shows signs of thickening. When this takes place, clear away the thickened egg with the spoon from the sides of the pan, and stir more rapidly than before for a few seconds, then while the mixture is still light and creamy spread it on two squares of hot buttered toast, from which the crust has been cut, and which have been sprinkled with salt and pepper, and send to table as quickly as possible. A little prac- tice is necessary to enable an inexperienced cook to know the exact moment at which the eggs should be taken from the fire, for even after the pan is removed from the stove they continue cooking, and due allowance should be made for this, otherwise the eggs when taken from the pan may be found too solid. A great variety of buttered egg dishes may be made. For example, spread the egg on anchovy toast or on toast spread with potted ham, or place the egg on fried bread croutons and arrange a cross of filleted anchovy on each. This buttered egg, with stewed mushrooms or peas, French beans or young carrots, is delicious. Eggs in Aspic (Cold) 334 Take four hard boiled eggs, cut them in halves, re- move the yolks, and pound them with a piece of butter, and three teaspoonsful of potted ham. Re-fill the whites of the eggs with the paste, and fit each half into a small dariole mould (previously wetted) and fill up with aspic jelly. When perfectly set turn out the eggs, and place each on a round of ham slightly larger in diameter than the jelly, and dish up surrounded by a small salad.

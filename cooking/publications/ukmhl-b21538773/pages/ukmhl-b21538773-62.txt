THE SINGLE HANDED COOK 46 coated with the flour. Have ready in a saucepan a good supply of boiling fat; place some of the “ whitebait ” in a wire frying basket, taking care not to put in too many at a time, and when the fat is boiling, plunge the basket into it; directly the fish becomes a pale golden colour remove the basket, holding it for a few seconds over the pan to drain, and then turn the contents on to a dish covered with soft paper ; and let the fish dry while the remainder is cooked ; the fat must be boiled up every time before the basket is immersed in it. When ready, sprinkle a little cayenne and a dust of fine salt over the “ whitebait,” and serve them with thin brown bread and butter and lemon cut into small pieces. Mazarin of Fish (Hot) 92 Remove all skin and bone from any raw fish you may have, and pound 5 oz. of it in a mortar until smooth. Put the bones and trimmings in a saucepan with a little water to make stock. When this stock is done, soak in it 2 oz. of fine stale breadcrumb ; squeeze it, stir it over the fire until dry, and then beat into it the yolk of an egg. When cold mix in the fish, add a little piece of butter (the size of a lump of sugar), pepper and salt, and one whole egg. Steam gently in a buttered mould, resting the mould on paper, and putting paper over it. When done, let it rest a minute on the table ; tap it sharply on the table to loosen it from the mould. Turn out, and serve with or without sauce. Decorate with chopped truffle, or leave it plain. It you have a fancy fish mould, fill the top ornamentation with some of the mixture, coloured pink, and leave the remainder plain.

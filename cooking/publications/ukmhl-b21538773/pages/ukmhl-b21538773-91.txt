MEAT DISHES,' POULTRY AND GAME 75 dish is full. Add a teacupful of seasoned stock. Cover with mashed potato, leaving a hole in the centre. When nearly baked, add half a teacupful of gravy. Fill up the centre with an ornament of mashed potato, make thoroughly hot again, and let the potato ornament cook, and serve in the dish in which it was cooked, with a napkin folded round. “ Stonehenge ” (Hot) 145 Take some large potatoes, all about the same size and a good shape, wash them, and bake them in their jackets in a hot oven until thoroughly cooked. Cut a small piece oS the bottom of each, so that it can stand, and a rather larger piece o2 the top. Scoop out the inside, which should be quite mealy. Have ready some oddments of cold meat which have been through the mincing machine (any meat does, but it is a very good way of using up cold pork), two hard-boiled eggs chopped up very small, a little parsley and herbs, and either a little onion or lemon and nutmeg, according to the meat you are using, and if the meat was lean, a little butter. Season to taste, and mix well with the insides of the potatoes. Fill the potatoes with the mixture, cover each potato with its top, and re-heat in the oven. Serve on a napkin or lace paper in a sort of “ Stonehenge ” circle, and hand a tureen of really good thickened brown gravy. The mixture will be more than will fill the potatoes, and the remainder can be blended with an egg, made into balls, and fried for breakfast.

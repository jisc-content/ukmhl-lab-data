THE SINGLE HANDED COOK Pain of Gooseberries (Cold) 273 Make a gooseberry fool, using one quart of green goose- berries, topped, tailed, and wiped ; half a tumblerful of water, and ยง lb. of sugar ; stew until soft. Soak J oz. of gelatine in half a tumberful of water, when quite dis- solved add it to the gooseberries. Pass through a sieve and mix with half a pint of cream or milk. Set in a mould which has been soaked in cold water. Pain of Rhubarb (Cold) 274 Make just as for pain of gooseberries, but as the rhu- barb is more liquid, omit the first lot of water, only using that in which the gelatine is dissolved. Add a little colouring if necessary. Use a ring mould and fill the centre with whipped cream. Chartreuse of Tangerine Oranges (Cold) 275 Decorate the top of a plain mould with some jelly and pistachio nuts. When this has set, arrange a ring of Tangerine orange, sections freed from all pith; then cover with some more melted . jelly, and let this set. Put in another ring of oranges, but make the pieces turn the reverse way to the first ring, or, the weight all pressing one way on the jelly may cause it to crack. Continue to do this till the mould is full, finish with a layer of jelly. 12S

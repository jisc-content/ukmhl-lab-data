PREFACE xi together for three-quarters of an hour, and so forth. In arranging these recipes I was influenced by the following letter received through the cor- respondence column of Hearth and Home, and from which I publish an extract— “ I have found your book, Ten Shillings a Head for House Boohs, of great use to me, in fact so invaluable is it that I venture to ask you if you cannot publish a second volume of recipes. “To a busy woman such as myself, obliged to keep the house bills within a certain limit, and anxious to feed my family and servants attract- ively and wholesomely, a still greater choice of recipes (especially for puddings) would be greatly appreciated. Particularly if they are like those in the Ten Shillings a Head book, plainly worded, sufficiently inexpensive, dainty, and not too elaborate to be attempted by a single-handed plain cook. I have several excellent cookery books, but I grudge the time which it takes to look through them in order to find simple inexpensive recipes, or, failing this, to copy, simplify, and adapt those which are too ex- pensive or elaborate.” Dorothy C. Peel.

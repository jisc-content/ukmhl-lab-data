MEAT DISHES, POULTRY AND GAME 55 party the neck may be divided into three cut- lets, a tiny joint roasted or boiled, and Scotch broth. There are several ways of cooking cutlets— broiling, frying, stewing or sauteing—and dozens of ways of garnishing them. They are also served cold in aspic, en chaudfroid or in mayon- naise sauce. When required to be cold the best way of cooking them is as follows— Cutlets (Cold) 105 Stew the best end of the neck of mutton whole, with vegetables, seasoning, and spice; when done, the cut- lets are separated one from the other, trimmed and masked with the jelly or sauce, decorated with tiny cutlet frills, and served on a border of aspic or a mace- doine of vegetables. Mutton Cutlets in Batter (Hot) 106 Trim the cutlets very neatly, and braise them with plenty of vegetables for three-quarters of an hour; then press them between two dishes, and when cold remove any fat which may have adhered to them ; dip them into batter and fry in a bath of boiling fat. Garnish with fried parsley, and serve with some of the sauce in which they were cooked, after thickening it and adding browning, and a little lemon-juice and sherry.

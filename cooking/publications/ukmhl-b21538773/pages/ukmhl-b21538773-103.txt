An Excellent Curry (Hot) 169 This curry, if correctly made, is delicious. Place i oz. of butter or dripping in a pan and bring to the boil. Put in a large onion cut in three slices and fry a golden brown. Drain on paper. Fry separately one small apple, sliced, twelve sultana raisins, until they have plumped out ; half a teaspoonful of cocoanut; drain all these ingredients. Then cut 1 lb. of cooked meat into neat pieces and fry a golden brown and dram. Mix one teaspoonful of curry powder in a basin with a little salt, and a heaped teaspoonful of flour, mix smooth with a few drops of milk and then add half a teaspoonful of vinegar and half a pint of stock. Boil and put half of it aside to use later. Add the other half to the onion, etc., and as they soak up the sauce add more until all is used. Simmer until the onion and apple are all in a pulp. Then add the meat, but not until the sauce is off the boil, and do not let it boil again or the meat will be hard. Stand on the side of the stove for two hours. Serve very hot with rice and garnish of ripe red peppers and hard-boiled egg. If raw meat is used wipe it dry, flour it, fry, and then simmer it in the sauce for three-quarters of an hour before standing the pan aside for two hours.

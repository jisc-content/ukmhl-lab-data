THE SINGLE HANDED COOK 168 butter, add a little curry powder, and stir. Serve very hot on fried bread. Creamed Oysters 374 Beard two dozen oysters, and save any liquor sent with them. Put half a pint of good white sauce into a saucepan, and make it quite hot, strain in the liquor, season nicely and add a little lemon juice. Add some milk or cream, should the sauce be too thick. It should be the consistency of cream. Add the oysters, heat them slowly till they look plump and the edges begin to curl up, then remove the pan from the fire. On no account let them boil. Have ready some neat slices of hot buttered toast. Put some oysters on each piece, pour some sauce over, and dust them with coralline pepper. Cheese Tartlets (Hot) 375 Prepare eight tiny tartlet cases of cheese pastry. Put 1 oz. of butter and one dessertspoonful of vater in a saucepan and bring to the boil. Stir in sufficient very fine breadcrumbs to make a stiff mixture, and then beat in the yolk of an egg. Add pepper, salt, ca/enne, and four tablespoonsful of finely-grated cheese. Stir well over the fire. Fill the tartlet cases with this mixture, and arrange a cross of filleted anchovy cut into strips on each, and scatter the four divisions thus formed, two with grated egg yolk, and two with coralline pepper. Serve very hot. Cases of fried bread may be used instead of pastry cases.

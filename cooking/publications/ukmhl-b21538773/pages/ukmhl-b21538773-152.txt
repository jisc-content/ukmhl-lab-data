THE SINGLE HANDED COOK 136 water on to the sugar, then add the strained lemon- juice. Well heat up the yolks. When the lemonade (as made above) is cool enough, pour it on to the yolks, mix well, and strain into a small saucepan or jug. Place the jug in a pan of boiling water over the fire, and stir till the mixture thickens well; but on no account let it boil, or it will curdle and be quite spoilt. Allow it to get cold. Serve in custard glasses, Fruit Ballette (Cold) 294 Make one and a half pints of custard, using three eggs and one gill of cream, and stiffen it with oz. of white leaf gelatine. Pour it while hot on to 3 oz. of sieved stale sponge cake crumbs and 1 oz. of crushed macaroons, and flavour with a little liqueur (if liked). Leave till cold. Half fill a china mould with a hollow centre. When set, turn out and fill with a compote of fruit. The cream in the custard may be dispensed with. Ratafia Custard (Cold) 295 Make a custard as before, and fill a mould to the depth of one inch, and let it set. Now arrange a layer of rata- fias on the custard and a row of preserved cherries all round the edge. Pour in some custard, and when set add another layer of ratafias and cherries, and a third layer of custard, and leave until quite set. The custard for the second and third layers should be kept in a jug in a pan of warm water to prevent it from setting.

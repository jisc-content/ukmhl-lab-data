THE SINGLE HANDED COOK 142 PASTRY The most generally useful of all kinds of pastry is short pastry, and a good economical recipe is the following. It may be used for tarts, tartlets, and puffs, and, if flavoured with salt, for meat pies and savoury tartletsâ€” Short or Flaky Pastry 1 lb. of fine dry sifted flour, 5 oz. of clarified beef dripping or butter, or part lard and part butter. Cut the fat into pieces, and with the tips of the fingers well floured rub the fat into the sweetened or salted flour until when incorporated it looks like a mass of breadcrumbs. Make a hollow in the centre of the flour and mix with hot water by means of a knife. Form into a ball by means of the floured hands. Flour the paste-board and roller, and roll the paste lightly but firmly to the desired thickness. A Richer Pastry Mix just as before, but use one beaten egg and not quite so much water. This pastry, whether made with an egg or without, should be light, short, and flaky.

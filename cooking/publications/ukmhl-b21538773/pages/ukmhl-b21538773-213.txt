THE MANAGEMENT OF THE OVEN 197 the experienced cook soon learns to differentiate and use accordingly; but, roughly speaking, these tests are trustworthy. Oven thermometers have been in use for some time, and are, of course, of the greatest use to the unlearned (the trained cook cannot be bothered with them, and indeed rather resents their existence); but their great objection has hitherto been their susceptibility to heat and their consequent fragility, which rendered their use, save in very skilled hands (who did not care for them), unsatisfactory. However, in the last few years the Eagle Range Company have introduced the “ Eagle Heat Indicator,” with neither springs nor mercury to get out of order ; the heat indications shown on the dial fixed in the oven door being the result of the expansion and contraction of the alloyed metals used in its manufacture. This alloy remains good for years, and needs neither care nor alteration. Its degrees have been tested carefully, and correspond thus to M. Gouffe’s test and the cook’s nomenclature. 450 deg. on the Eagle Indicator corresponds with chocolate or deep brown paper, or a “ hot ” oven.

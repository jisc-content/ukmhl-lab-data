MEAT DISHES, POULTRY AND GAME 57 Lay them on the grid and cook them very near the fire, so near, indeed, that the surface of the meat catches without becoming actually burnt. Do them thus on both sides and then cook more gently, turning now and then. On no account prick the meat with a fork or the juice will run out, for the cutlets, when done, should be pink and juicy inside and brown on the out- side. Serve very hot round a puree of potato or other vegetable. Cutlets en Papillotes (Hot) 109 Take the trimmed cutlets and spread them on each side with potted ham or tongue, foie gras, or a puree of tomato, mushroom, or onion. Oil some ovals of white kitchen paper, twist the cutlets up in them as neatly as possible, and broil as before. Serve in the papers. Stewed Cutlet (Hot) no Prepare the cutlets, and place them in a stewpan which has been well greased and lined with sliced vegetables, a little ham or bacon, and spice. Cook until the vegetables begin to brown, then pour in some stock sufficient to just cover the cutlets, cover the pan, and cook gently for about an hour. Strain off the gravy, free it from fat, brown and thicken it. Arrange the cutlets round a mound of cooked carrot and turnips or macaroni, and pour the gravy round. The macaroni may be sprinkled with cheese if liked.

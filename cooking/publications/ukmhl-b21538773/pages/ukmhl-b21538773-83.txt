MEAT DISHES, POULTRY AND GAME 67 some good brown gravy poured round the dish. For the forcemeat, take the contents of a small tin of button mushrooms, chop them very fine, and mix with 8 oz. of breadcrumbs, 2 oz. of beef, or veal suet, and a small quantity of grated ham, or lean bacon ; season well with pepper and salt, and mix with two eggs. The bones of the loin can be used to make a delicate mutton broth. Navarin of Mutton (Hot) 128 Cut about 1 lb. of cold mutton (underdone if possible) into square pieces. Lay them on a dish and moisten them with a marinade made thus : two gills of mutton gravy (or stock), a tablespoonful of currant jelly dis- solved in it, a spoonful of mushroom ketchup, the juice of half a lemon, a spoonful of the vinegar from some walnut pickle, add a dust of salt and pepper. Let the meat lie in this, turning it occasionally for an hour or two. Then melt 2 oz. of butter and add a finely-shred onion, a sliced carrot and turnip, some celery and some chopped parsley ; fry until the veget- able begins to brown, then add 1 oz. of flour and mix smooth. Add about a pint of stock, bring to the boil, and then simmer for half an hour. Rub this sauce through a sieve. Place the mutton and the marinade in the pan, pour the sauce over, and then heat very gently and slowly for one to two hours. Be sure that it does not boil, or it will be spoilt. The object is to cook the navarin very slowly and gently. If you use uncooked meat, fry it lightly before placing it in the marinade. Serve with saute potatoes.

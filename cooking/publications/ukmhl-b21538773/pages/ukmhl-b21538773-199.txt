CAKES, BUNS, BISCUITS, AND SCONES 183 with greased paper, and continue to bake for about three-quarters of an hour in all. If there is any question as to the sponge—or indeed any other cake—not being done enough, run a bright skewer into it. If the mix- ture does not soil the skewer it is done. When baked leave in the mould for a minute or two, then loosen and turn out on to a sieve, and leave in a warm place until cold. If cakes or buns of any kind are removed from their tins, placed on a cold plate or dish and put into a cold place, they are almost certain to become heavy; even though the mixing and baking may have been satisfactorily accomplished.

GLAZES 25 White Glaze (Cold) (For Chickens or Galantines) 56 Strain oft the liquor in which the chicken or veal has been cooked, let it grow cold, remove the fat, clear with the whipped white and crushed shell of one egg, and to half a pint of this clear white stock add three sheets of gelatine and half a teacupful of milk. Make it all hot together, but do not let it boil, or it will curdle. Use just before it sets. Some cooks use this glaze for cold boiled chickens, others prefer a white sauce, such as No. 42, which is not quite so smooth looking.

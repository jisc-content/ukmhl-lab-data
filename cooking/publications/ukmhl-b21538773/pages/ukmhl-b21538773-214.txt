THE SINGLE HANDED COOK 198 400 deg. corresponds with cigar-brown paper, or a “ quick ” or “ sharp ” oven. 350 deg. equals a dark deal-brown paper, or a “ moderately quick ” oven. 300 deg. means a lighter deal paper, or a “ steady ” or “ soaking ” oven. 275 to 250 deg., or faintly-tinged paper, means a “ slack ” oven. In going by these figures, however, it must be noted that the thermometer, or heat-indicator, being on the door, is always a trifle cooler than the interior of the oven, a variation which must, of course, be allowed for. Bread, like cakes, should always be put first into a hot oven, say 350 deg., this being then allowed to slacken down gently to 320 deg. Both bread and cake should be a few minutes in the oven before they begin to colour, for after they turn brown they stop rising, hence the reason that an over-hot oven spoils both, as it draws up and colours the top before the centre has time to cook properly, and conse- quently when lifted out the inside of the loaf is found to be heavy and doughy. With a too slack oven the cake is overcooked, hard, and tough before the outside is properly coloured.

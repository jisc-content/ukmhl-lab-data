How to Make a Sponge Cake 414 Take four eggs, their weight (weighed in the shells) in fine sifted castor sugar, and the weight of three in fine sifted and warmed flour. Break the egg yolks into the bowl, the whites into another. Beat the yolks for five minutes with a whisk (if a fork is used the eggs must be beaten for about twelve to fifteen minutes, as the whisk beats so much more thoroughly). Then mix in the sugar and beat again for eight to fifteen minutes with a whisk or fork. Whip the whites to a froth, and stir in the yolk and sugar mixture lightly and alternately with the flour. Have ready a mould, for if the cake mixture is kept waiting while the mould is prepared it will be spoilt. To prepare the mould, brush it over evenly with warmed (not absolutely melted) butter, then mix a teaspoonful of fine castor sugar and the same of sifted flour, and dust the inside of the buttered mould evenly. Then tie a piece of greased paper round the outside of the mould so that it projects about three inches. Fill the tin half full of the sponge mixture, and place the mould on a baking tin (this is to protect the bottom of the cake from too fierce a heat), and bake in a moderate oven. When risen and slightly browned, cover the top

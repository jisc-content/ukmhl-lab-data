THE SINGLE HANDED COOK 62 fifteen or twenty minutes, according to the size of the quenelles, not allowing the liquid to boil, otherwise the appearance of the quenelles will be spoilt. If suitable moulds are not to be had, shape the quenelles with two spoons dipped in hot water and gently slide the shapes into the buttered pan and poach as before. For the Panade.—Put | oz. of butter into a pan with a gill of milk, stock, or water, and bring it to the boil. Sift in 2 oz. of fine flour, and stir all together over the fire until it becomes thick enough to ball; then draw the pan a little to the side of the stove (keeping it on a hot part) and cook a few minutes longer, stirring it at intervals to prevent it catching, till the flour is thoroughly cooked. If this precaution is neglected, the melted butter will taste raw and pasty. All quen- elles and meat creams are made in much this manner, no matter if fish, chicken, veal or game is used. Cooked meat may be employed, but the result is not quite as delicate. To pulp the meat pass it three or four times through the mincing machine, pound in a mortar, and then work through a wire sieve, using a little stock or cream to moisten it. This sieving process takes time, so that unless a very smooth mixture is required the meat need onl}~ be minced and pounded. Quenelles and creams are not difficult to make, and if these direc- tions are carried out carefully one or two trials should result in success. But it is most important that the water in which they are poached should simmer and not boil, otherwise the quenelles would be leathery and honeycombed. When once the cook can make good quenelles she is then in a position to turn out a variety of nice entrees. For example—

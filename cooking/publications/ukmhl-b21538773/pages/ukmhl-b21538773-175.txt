SAVOURIES AND BREAKFAST DISHES 159 eggs finely chopped, and serve immediately. For full directions for omelettes, see page 214 of Ten Shillings a Head. Stuffed Eggs a la Diable (Hot or Cold) 345 Hard boil the eggs, shell, place for a few moments in cold water. Cut a little piece from the pointed end. Cut each egg in half with a sharp knife. Remove the yolk ; pound with butter, salt, and a seasoning of curry powder or paste until a soft smooth paste is formed. Refill the eggs and serve each on a little round of lightly fried bread. Scatter a little coralline pepper on each egg and garnish with parsley or cress. If a hot dish is needed, prepare the eggs as before, place in a fireproof entree dish, pour a brown or white curry-flavoured sauce over and make quite hot. Scolloped Mince with Poached Eggs (Hot) 346 For this dish use little fireproof pans, butter them and part fill with mince and crumbs. Bake as before, and just at the last moment add a poached egg. Creamed Egg and Mince (Hot) 347 Place a layer of hot mince in each china saucepan or ramekin case, break an egg into each, add a spoonful of cream and a little chopped parsley on each egg, and return to the oven until the egg is lightly set.

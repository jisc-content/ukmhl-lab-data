THE SINGLE HANDED COOK 194 ticularly if large, will alter tlie temperature of the oven perceptibly; so will the opening of the oven door. Sponge cakes and gingerbread often suffer from this ; whilst if by accident or care- lessness the door be slammed, or even shut roughly, the cake inside is pretty sure to deteri- orate. Then, again, one oven will burn at the bottom, in which case the cake tin must be set on a trivet, or even two pieces of firewood, to prevent the bottom of the tin coming in actual contact with the lower part of the oven, and an extra sheet of buttered paper should be allowed in papering the mould. Other ovens, again, are apt to be over-hot at the top, in which case the cake should be covered with a sheet of buttered paper to prevent its catching and over-cooking at the upper surface. One way in which anxious cooks spoil their baking is often this, though, as a rule, the oven gets the blame of the failure. In their zeal to get the heat right they over-heat it; then the cake begins to burn. They rush to the oven, lift out the only half-set cake, and probably set it down on the floor, when the sudden change of temperature causes it to fall, never to rise properly" again.

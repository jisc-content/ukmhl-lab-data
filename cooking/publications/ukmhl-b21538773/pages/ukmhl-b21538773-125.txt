PUDDINGS AND SWEETS 109 and bake for twenty minutes. This pudding may be made with one egg, or even without an egg, using a little milk instead. Apple and Vermicelli Pudding (Hot or Cold) 224 Boil a quart of milk with a strip of lemon peel, add 4 oz. of vermicelli, and simmer for half an hour. When cool sweeten with 4 or 5 oz. of sugar, and beat in two eggs. Pare and core some apples, and put a bit of grated lemon-peel in the centre of each to flavour it. Put some of the vermicelli in a pie dish, lay in the apples, cover with the rest of the vermicelli, and bake in a very moderate oven till the apples are quite soft. Apple Charlotte (Hot) 225 Pare, core and slice 3 lb. of cooking apples, and stew them gently to a pulp with twelve lumps of sugar, and the thin peel of one lemon. Butter a mould and line it with thin fingers of stale bread which have been dipped in melted butter, and let the pieces of bread overlap each other. Cut a slice of bread to cover the top of the mould (a plain mould should be used for this pudding). Fill with the hot apple pulp, and fit a slice of bread over, cover with a plate, on which put a weight to keep the bread in place, and bake in a quick oven for 45 to 50 minutes. Turn out and serve dusted over with castor sugar.

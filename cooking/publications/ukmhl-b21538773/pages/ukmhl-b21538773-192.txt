176 CHAPTER VIII Cakes, Buns, Biscuits, and Scones NOTE.â€”For directions for cake mixing and baking, and for some forty recipes, see Chapter XVI of the Ten Shillings a Head book. How to Ice Cakes 396 The cake to be iced should be trimmed neatly and wiped with a damp cloth to remove crumbs. Now stand it on a jam pot, and the pot on a dish. Have a palette or broad knife and a jug of water ready. Pour some icing on the middle of the cake, and spread it as evenly as possible with the knife, wetting it frequently. Then set to work on the sides. If the cake is to be orna- mented with coloured icing, put it away for twenty-four hours to dry thoroughly, but if it is to be decorated with fruits these may be put on after the icing has stood two hours. For a medium-sized cake to be iced all over, 1 lb. of icing sugar will be needed.

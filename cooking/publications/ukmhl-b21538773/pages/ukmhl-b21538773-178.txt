THE SINGLE HANDED COOK 162 Savoury Tartlets (Cold) 355 Make tartlet cases of short paste, flavoured with salt instead of sugar. Fill with flaked fish or finely minced chicken and ham or tongue, with a little minced olive or mushroom, a few green peas or minced French beans. Cover with mayonnaise sauce and decorate with filleted anchovy, well washed, and arranged in the form of a cross. In each of the divisions place a little heap of chopped olive or truffle. Almost any ingredients may be mixed and utilized to fill the tartlets. Canapes a la Fribourg (Hot) 356 Steam a haddock, and work the flesh through a wire sieve, moistening with a little milk when necessary. Then mix the pulp in a stewpan with a spoonful or two of cream, a piece of fresh butter, a pinch of salt and a grain or two of cayenne. When quite hot pile on small rounds of fried bread, smoothing it into a pyramidical shape by means of a knife. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and a few brown crumbs, and serve very hot. Sardine Savoury (Hot) 357 Take as many sardines as are required out of the tin, wipe them, and let them lie in a soup plate for an hour, covered with fresh oil mixed with a little lemon juice and cayenne, then sprinkle them with finely chopped parsley and chervil. Butter some crisp toast, cut it into fingers, and spread them with tomato ketchup, place one of the sardines on each, and serve on a dish paper garnished with parsley.

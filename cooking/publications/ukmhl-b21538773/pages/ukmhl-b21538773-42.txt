THE SINGLE HANDED COOK 26 Frying Batters (without Eggs) 59 Take 2 tablespoonsful of fine dry flour and add a pinch of salt and a pinch of baking powder. Mix by degrees with cold milk until you have a batter of the consistency of thick cream. To Clarify Dripping 60 Dripping is obtained from roasted meat and is the fat which drips from it under heat. It is used to baste the meat, and what remains should be clarified and used for frying, for making plain pastry, and cakes, etc. Some of the famous French chefs regarded dripping as the best of all frying mediums, and there is no doubt, if properly clarified and used in the right quantities, beef dripping is excellent in many cases as a substitute for butter or lard. Pour the dripping into a clean large basin and cover with boiling water. Let the dripping cool a little before adding the water, or it may sputter and scald the hands. Leave until perfectly cold. It will then have formed into a hard cake of pure fat and the water and sediment will have sunk to the bottom of the basin. Lift off the fat and wipe any gravy which may adhere to the lower side and put away in a clean basin. To Render down Fat 61 The skimmings of fat from stocks should be treated in the same way as dripping, and are excellent for frying.

THE SINGLE HANDED COOK 134 and let the custard cool before pouring it into glasses, or it may crack them. This recipe is for a good medium custard, and may be varied to taste. For example, omit one of the eggs, or add the yolks of one, two or three more eggs ; use half milk and half cream, or merely add a gill of cream, whipping it in as the custard is cool- ing. If the custard is required for moulding, dissolve | oz. of white leaf gelatine in each pint of milk. Be careful to strain the gelatine-thickened milk before mixing it with the eggs. The custard may, of course, be made in a delicately clean enamelled pan, but it is far safer, if a little more trouble, to cook it in a jug in a panful of water. Custards, and, indeed, creams of any kind, should be moulded in glass or china moulds. When using gelatine for custards and creams place it until soft in cold milk, then dissolve it in the hot milk. Pineapple Charlotte (Cold) 290 T Make a custard with one pint of milk to two eggs, as in the previous recipe, and stiffen with four sheets of gelatine. Pour it while hot on to J lb. of fine brown breadcrumbs. Decorate the top of a plain mould with slices of preserved pineapple and tiny cubes of angelica. Pour in the custard very gently a little at a time, so as not to dislodge the garnish, and leave to set. Moulded Custard (Made with One Egg) 291 (Cold) Make a boiled and sweetened custard with the yolk of one egg and half a pint of milk ; flavour with vanille.

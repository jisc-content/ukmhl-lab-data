CAKES, BUNS, BISCUITS, AND SCONES 177 N Royal Icing 397 Place the white of one large egg in a plate, add a little lemon juice or other flavouring and a teaspoonful of water. Have ready icing sugar, dry and sifted, and stir it into the liquid by degrees, mixing with a knife. Con- tinue until you have a thick creamy mixture. Coloured Decorative Icing 398 Make exactly as for Royal Icing, but allow a little less sugar so that the mixture is somewhat softer. Colour with any colouring, adding it drop by drop and working it well in. This icing should be used in a bag and pipe (which is quite an inexpensive implement to be had from any ironmonger). If you wish the cake to be very neat, mark out the pattern you wish to ice with a sharply-pointed hard pencil. Lemon Icing 399 Would require rather more lemon juice than the white icing, and the grated rind of a large lemon and a little yellow colouring. Rose Icing 400 Omit the teaspoonful of lemon juice, and use instead the same quantity of rose water, a few drops of essence of rose, and sufficient carmine to make the icing a delicate rose-pink.

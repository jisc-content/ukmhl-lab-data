THE SINGLE HANDED COOK 50 pieces of butter here and there on top, and cook for ten minutes in a good oven. Stewed Codfish (Hot) ioi Cut the fish into small square pieces and dry in a clean cloth. Put 3 oz. of butter into a stewpan with two tablespoonsful of finely chopped parsley. When melted, add half a pint of boiling water, with pepper and salt to taste. Put in the fish, cover close, and stew for three-quarters of an hour. Beat the yolks of two eggs with the juice of one lemon, stir into the stew, shake the pan well for a few minutes, have ready a wall of mashed and browned potato in an entree dish, and serve the fish in the centre. Pommes a lâ€™Otero (Hot) 102 Have ready the necessary number of baked potatoes, all of a size and shape. Cut a slice off each lengthwise and scoop out most of the contents, leaving only a very thin wall of the potato. Mash the potato with butter, salt and pepper to a smooth paste and re-line the potato cases thinly. Then place a layer of minced ham or tongue on each potato, and then a small cooked rolled fillet of any white fish. Pour over the fish a good white sauce, so that the potato case is filled. This must be neatly done, as the sauce should not be slopped over the sides of the potato. Place in the oven to make thoroughly hot, and serve in an entree dish in a folded napkin. For the sauce, see Bechamel Sauce, page 41, Ten Shillings a Head; or for a plainer sauce, use melted butter, page 79, Ten Shillings a Head, using milk or stock instead of water. Soubise

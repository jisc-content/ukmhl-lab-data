THE SINGLE HANDED COOK Spring Broth 15 Melt 1 oz. of butter in a stewpan, and put in two large carrots and one turnip, each cut into two pieces, one small onion sliced, one leek, a small bunch of parsley, and the outside leaves of one lettuce ; season with a salt- spoonful of salt, half the quantity of black pepper, a pinch of sugar, and a dust of cayenne, and let all the ingredients cook very gently in the butter for fifteen minutes. Then add a tablespoonful of flour, stirring it well into the butter, and moisten gradually with three pints of white stock (the liquor in which a joint of mutton was boiled answers admirably) ; add half a teaspoonful of mixed herbs, half the quantity of celery seed, and a clove, tied together in muslin ; let the soup boil up, and then simmer for an hour, when it should be strained. Cut the carrots and turnips into narrow strips, and put them into a clean stewpan with a handful of finely shred lettuce, and half the green portion of the leek, also cut up ; pour the soup on to the vegetables and let it gradually boil up ; send it to table accompanied by grated cheese. Puree of Parsnips 16 Wash, scrape, and remove any black specks from lib. of parsnips. Cut them in thin slices. Melt 1 oz. of butter in a clean pan. Put in the parsnips and one sliced onion. Stir about for five minutes. Then add 1 quart stock or milk-and-water. Simmer till the vegetables are quite soft. Then rub them through a wire sieve. Re-boil and season. If too thick, thin down with a little milk. Serve with toast cut in dice. S

PUDDINGS AND SWEETS 149 about two tablespoonsful of the batter into the pan, and cook over a clear fire ; when one side is just brown shake the pan, and turn the pancake over and remove directly it is evenly coloured on the other side. Have ready a hot dish covered with cooking-paper, turn the pancake on to it, and roll it up ; then heat more lard in the pan and cook another pancake, and proceed in the same way until all the batter is used. Arrange the pancakes on a hot dish covered with a dâ€™oyley, sprinkle some powdered sugar over them, and serve with cut lemon and white sugar, or pour hot maple syrup over them. Apples a la Portugaise (Cold) 326 Choose twelve apples, small and all of a size. Peel them and remove the core with a round cutter. Stew in sugar syrup (use a breakfastcupful of sugar and the same of water, and the juice of one lemon and the peel of half a lemon for the syrup) until tender, but not broken. Leave till cold. Place in a glass or silver dish ; strain and then colour the syrup pink, and fill the hollow in each apple with red currant jelly sufficiently melted to enable you to pour it in. When set serve. This dish may be made more substantial by arranging the apples round a pyramid of rice boiled in milk and whipped up with apple pulp. To prepare the rice, simmer a teacupful of rice in a quart of milk until it has absorbed all the milk it can. Sweeten the milk with two tablespoonsful of sugar and season with the grated rind of half a lemon. When cooked whisk in about half the quantity of apple pulp.

PUDDINGS AND SWEETS L 145 and rub into it 6 oz. of butter, and moisten it with the yolk of an egg, a teaspoonful of lemon-juice, and some water. Roll out the paste to one-eighth of an inch thick, handling it as little as possible. This is a good pastry for patties or vol au vent cases. If needed for sweet tarts add 1 oz. of powdered sugar. Choux Pastry 316 Put into an enamelled saucepan half a pint of cold water, 3 oz. of butter, and 1 oz. of sugar ; when boiling, stir in quickly 6 oz. of flour, beat till smooth, cook till it leaves the sides of the saucepan clear, then take from the fire and beat in separately three eggs, and flavour with vanilla. Bake in slow oven, till of a pale brown. This is the pastry which is used for eclairs and petits choux. Eclairs (Cold) 317 Have ready some choux paste and a greased baking sheet. By means of a bag and pipe force out finger- shaped pieces of the paste on the tin. When baked, hollow out the under side of each finger a little, and when cold fill with cream. Press together and pour some chocolate or coffee icing over. Petits Choux (Hot or Cold) 318 Proceed as before, but make rounds of pastry, the size of small walnuts. When baked, open and fill with cream or jam.

FISH 37 free it carefully from skin and bone, and break it up into flakes. Arrange it neatly in the middle of a fireproof dish. Have ready some smoothly mashed potatoes, and mix with them the yolks of two eggs, 2 oz. of butter, and season with salt and a tiny pinch of nutmeg. Heap this roughly around the fish. Pour half a pint of white sauce over the fish, grate a little cheese over the top of all, and place in a hot oven for twenty minutes. Serve very brown and hot. Filleted Haddock with Mayonnaise Sauce (Cold) 74 Take some filleted fresh haddock, and if the fillets are large cut each into two pieces, rub them over with lemon- juice and place them on a baking tin between sheets of buttered paper, and cook for fifteen minutes in a moder- ately hot oven. When the fish is cold, mask it thickly with mayonnaise, and then arrange some French capers in rows, not too close together, on the top of each piece. Make a surround on a dish with some finely shred lettuce and place some thin shoes of cucumber upon it. For mayonnaise sauce see page 84 of Ten Shillings a Head for House Books. Scalloped Haddock (Hot) 75 Make half a pint of thick melted butter sauce ; season it with salt and pepper, and add a pinch of curry-powder

SAVOURIES AND BREAKFAST DISHES 171 with fine breadcrumbs and grated Parmesan. Pour over this a little oiled butter, and bake a golden brown in a quick oven. Cheese and Potato Fritters (Hot) 382 Bake six or eight large potatoes, scoop out the inside and pass through a sieve. Add to this half a pint of milk beaten with two eggs, 1 oz. of grated cheese, a piece of butter the size of a walnut, pepper, salt, and nutmeg to taste. Stir to a perfectly smooth batter and fry as ordinary fritters. Drain on thick paper and serve very hot on a folded napkin, with a little salt dusted over. Savoury Pancakes (Hot) 383 Put J lb. of flour into a basin, add a pinch of salt to it and a dust of cayenne ; whisk two eggs and pour them gradually into the flour, mixing it well with a wooden spoon, then add by degrees half a pint of milk, working the batter until it is perfectly smooth ; cover the basin with a cloth and let the batter stand for an hour if possible. Just before using it stir one and a half table- spoonsful of grated cheese into the pancake mixture, and a quarter of a teaspoonful of baking-powder. Put a small omelette pan on the stove(where the heat is steady), with a piece of dripping in it, rather larger than a big walnut; when the fat is boiling add sufficient of the batter to evenly cover the pan, and when the under-side is lightly browned shake the pan and turn the pancake, and directly it is evenly browned on the other side remove it from the pan, place on paper and roll it up.

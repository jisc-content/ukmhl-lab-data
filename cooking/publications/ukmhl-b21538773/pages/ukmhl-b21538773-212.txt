Gouffe, once the royal chef.

If after a stay of two or three minutes the paper turns a dark, almost chocolate brown, the oven is a “ hot ” one, fit for patties and small pastry generally. If after the same time the paper becomes of a Havannah or cigar brown, the oven is “ quick ” and ready for tarts, vol-au-vent, and such-like.

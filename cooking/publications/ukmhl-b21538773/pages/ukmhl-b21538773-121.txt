VEGETABLES AND SALADS 105 spoonful anchovy sauce; one tablespoonful milk, or milk and cream ; one dessertspoonful vinegar. Mix the mustard and sauce first, then mix in the milk, then the vinegar. Tomatoes are equally good served the same way. Haricot Bean Salad (Cold) 215 Soak the haricots for six hours, and then cook them and leave until cold. Pile in the centre of a salad bowl and surround with shred lettuce and sliced radishes. Arrange whipped cream flavoured with salt and white pepper on the haricots and powder with a little coraline pepper. Tomato Mayonnaise (Cold) 216 Take 1 lb. tomatoes, scald them in boiling water, skin and slice them. Put them in a salad bowl with some thin bread and butter cut into dice, a quarter of a small onion, salt and pepper, a dessertspoonful of chopped pickles, and two hard-boiled eggs, setting aside a few rounds of the eggs for a garnish. Mix all to- gether, and lightly mix in a good mayonnaise dressing about an hour before it is needed, so that it soaks in thoroughly.

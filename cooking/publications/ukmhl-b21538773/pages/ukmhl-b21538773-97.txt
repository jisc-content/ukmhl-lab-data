MEAT DISHES, POULTRY AND GAME 81 G to demand that the liver and the bones shall be sent home. Cut the boned birds in half and spread out on a board. Prepare the following stuffing. Pound the livers of the birds with 3 oz. of raw veal minced, and 2 oz. of ham. Add salt and pepper and ten pistachio nuts finely chopped. Spread the stuffing on the pigeons, roll as neatly as possible and tie securely with tape. Now put all the bones and trimmings in a stewpan with one carrot and one onion sliced, six peppercorns, one clove, two bay leaves, and a little bunch of parsley, pepper and salt. Place the rolled pigeons on the top and pour in about one and a quarter pints of water, and take care that it does not actually touch the birds. Cover the pan and simmer for three-quarters of an hour, by which time the liquid will be reduced to rather more than half a pint. Take out the rolls and put them aside until cooled, then glaze. For the glaze, take half a cup of water, dissolve in it three sheets of gelatine, and add a few drops of Parisian essence. Meanwhile strain off the stock from the pigeon bones and let it become cold ; skim off the fat, put it into a clean pan with the white and shells of an egg whipped stiff ; bring to the boil, and strain through fine clean muslin which has been wrung out in boiling water. Pour a little jelly into a ring mould, let it set, then arrange the rolls neatly and fill up with jelly. Turn out when required and fill the centre with sliced tomato, cucumber, and a few green peas (cooked) which have been seasoned.

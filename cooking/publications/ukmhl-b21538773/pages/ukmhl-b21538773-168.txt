THE SINGLE HANDED COOK 152 with flour, pour in the mixture and bake at once in a well heated oven. When done turn out the cake and let it get cool on a sieve, but before it is cold cut it through into three rounds with a sharp knife ; spread the top round with a layer of apricot jam, the middle with cream, and the bottom layer with raspberry jam. Replace the rounds neatly and dust the top and sides of the pudding with finely powdered icing sugar, and just before serving pour a hot boiled custard round the dish. If required cold let the cake cool, cut into shoes as before, spread with jam or cheese cake mixture and cream, press together again and, when cold, moisten with sherry and water or fruit syrup, and cover with whipped cream. Decorate with shred pistachio nuts. A great variety of gateaux may be made, using Genoese or sponge cakes, and flavouring and decorating them in various ways.

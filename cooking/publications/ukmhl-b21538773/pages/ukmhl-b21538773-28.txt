THE SINGLE HANDED COOK 12 soup has sufficient salt and pepper, and as soon as it is hot serve it with fried sippets. Puree of Broad Beans 23 Put 1 quart of shelled broad beans in a pan of fast boiling salted water. Boil about thirty minutes or till soft. Melt 2 oz. of butter in a saucepan, add two small onions thinly sliced. Remove the outer skins from the beans and add the insides to the butter and onions. Stir over the fire for five minutes, add the stock. Boil until the onion is soft. Wash a handful each of spinach and parsley, and cook in boiling water till tender. Drain, and rub through a hair sieve. Add the pulp to the soup to make it a good green. When the onion is soft rub all the soup through a hair or wire sieve, season and serve. If too thin, thicken with a little cornflour thinly mixed with cold milk, taking care to reboil it after this is done. Asparagus Soup 24 Wash and then boil twenty-four stalks of asparagus, Cut in inch lengths in one quart of water until tender. Reserve the heads. Rub through a sieve and return to the water in which they were boiled. Heat one pint of milk and thicken it with 1 oz. of butter and 1 oz. of flour smoothly mixed. Cook for ten minuutes, stirring frequently. Season with salt and pepper, add the aspar- agus. Bring to the boil and add a little cream and the heads of the asparagus, just before serving.

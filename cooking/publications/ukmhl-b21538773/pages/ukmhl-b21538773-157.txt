PUDDINGS AND SWEETS 141 leaves of Marshall’s gelatine in a teacupful of strong coffee, let it get cold, stir it into the cream, and put into a china mould ; let it stand until set. Strawberry Charlotte (Cold) 307 Line a plain round mould with Savoy biscuits. Make a strong syrup, about 1 lb. of sugar to half a pint of water, let it boil, and when clear add § lb. of picked strawberries. Boil up, being careful not to let the strawberries break. Pour into the mould while hot, cover closely and let it stand. When set turn out, and pile whipped cream on the top. Some gelatine may be used if required. But the syrup should be strong enough to set without. Ginger Cream (Cold) 308 Soak 1 oz. of gelatine in a teacup of water, to which add half a pint of sherry and let it stand five minutes, then dissolve it over the fire, stirring it all the time. Rub the rinds of two lemons with 6 oz. of lump sugar, which with the juice strained add to the hot solution. When nearly cold pour it gently into a pint of cream and stir in quite half a teaspoonful of ground ginger and some preserved ginger cut in small dice ; fill your mould, after having previously let it stand full of cold water and drained it. A little lemon jelly coloured to ornament the top makes it look much prettier—this must be put in the mould some time before and allowed to get perfectly cold and firm before adding the cream.

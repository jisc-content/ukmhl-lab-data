GLAZES 27 All pieces of fat trimmed from meat cooked or un- cooked should be cut into pieces, put into a tin and melted in the oven, and then clarified as dripping. All kinds of fat may be mixed and used for frying, but beef dripping should be reserved for cake and pastry making. Fat in which fish has been fried should be kept for that purpose only, as it would impart a fishy smell to other articles fried in it. After frying, the dripping must be re-clarified. Thus treated, it can be used over and over again. Yorkshire Pudding, Ericaâ€™s Recipe (enough for four people) 62 One egg, nearly one teacupful of flour, salt, half a pint of milk. Beat up the egg, add the milk, whisk in the flour very gently, only about a thimbleful at a time, not to make it lumpy, until the batter is like thick cream. Pour into a flat tin in which dripping is boiling. Bake in a hot oven for not less than forty minutes.

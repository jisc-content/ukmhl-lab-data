THE SINGLE HANDED COOK 92 Take one spray of cooked cauliflower for each crouton, and place it in the hollow in the centre. Pour a cheese sauce over very neatly, and serve very hot. Glazed Carrots (Hot) 180 Use small young carrots for choice. Scrape them, and put them into boiling water with salt in it. Boil gently, with the lid on the saucepan, until quite tender. New carrots will take about twenty minutes, old carrots an hour or more, according to age and size. When tender, put on a hot vegetable dish, boil down the stock rapidly to a glaze, and pour over them. Peas and Carrots a la Creme (Hot) 181 Scrape and wash some young carrots, and blanch them by putting them into a saucepan containing plenty of cold salted water, let it gradually come to boiling point, and after it has boiled for five minutes take out the carrots and drain them on a cloth. Put 1 oz. of butter (or dripping) into a small stewpan, and when it has melted add the carrots, season them with salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar, and let them simmer for six minutes, then cover them with some thick white sauce, and let them cook slowly until they are quite tender. Just before taking the stewpan from the fire, add a squeeze of lemon-juice to the sauce, two table- spoonsful of cooked green peas and two teaspoonsful of grated cheese ; place the carrots on a hot dish and scatter a little finely chopped parsley over them.

Boil and then simmer for one hour and twenty minutes. Pass through a sieve, return to pan, then add one dessertspoonful of cornflour pre- viously mixed with a little milk and water. Make very hot, serve with fried bread. Milk Soup ii This is a most useful “ emergency ” soup, as it is quickly prepared, needs no stock, and, if a little cream is added, makes a delicate white soup. Place 1 quart of milk in a saucepan. Beat up the yolks of two eggs with a teaspoonful of flour, and flavour with celery salt and white pepper. Just before the milk boils, stir in the eggs and then be very careful not to let the soup boil,or the eggs will curdle,but keep it simmering while you stew two small sliced onions in a little butter. Simmer these in the soup for ten minutes, then strain into the tureen and serve with tiny dice of fried bread.

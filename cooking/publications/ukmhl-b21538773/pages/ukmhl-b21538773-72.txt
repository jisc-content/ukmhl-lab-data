THE SINGLE HANDED COOK 56 Lamb and veal cutlets may be treated in just the same way as mutton cutlets, but the orthodox veal cutlet is prepared and cooked as followsâ€” Veal Cutlets (Hot) 107 Take a slice from the fillet of veal and cut the meat into rounds about three-quarters of an inch thick and not larger than a five-shilling piece. Pat them out neatly with a wet knife. Flour them well, or egg and breadcrumb them, and fry in clarified fat until thoroughly cooked, which will take about fifteen minutes. Lift them on to a hot dish and let them drain, serve with rolls of bacon on a border of mashed potato, tomato or other vegetable. If a sauce is required, fry the cutlets in butter instead of fat. When fried add a little more butter to the liquid in the pan, and then by degrees, stirring all the time, a dessertspoonful of dried and sifted flour, and cook together until the mixture is a pale brown. Add a gill of boiling stock or water, a little wine, if liked, a few drops of lemon-juice, pepper and salt; boil it all up together, colour with Parisian essence, if required, and strain it round the dish of cutlets. Broiled Mutton Cutlets (Hot) 108 Have ready a clean gridiron and rub the bars with a little fat. Be sure that the fire is clear and hot. While preparing the fire and gridiron let the cutlets lie in olive oil, turn them so that they are oiled on both sides.

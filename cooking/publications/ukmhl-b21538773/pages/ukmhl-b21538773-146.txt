THE SINGLE HANDED COOK 130 fruit with warm syrup, made by boiling half a pint of water with 6 oz. of sugar, colour a bright red with car- mine, and stand in a cool place for four or five hours. Then strain the syrup through muslin (leaving the fruit in the basin), take half of it, and place it in an enamelled saucepan with 1 oz. of soaked gelatine, and the thinly paired rind of half a lemon ; directly the gelatine is dis- solved strain the liquid back into the basin containing the remainder of the syrup ; add the juice of two lemons and a wineglass of sherry, and pour a little of the jelly into a wetted mould. As soon as it has set arrange some of the fruit on it, then add a little more jelly, and when this is firm continue to fill the mould in this way until all the fruit has been used. Rhubarb Mould (Cold) 280 Cut up two quarts of pink rhubarb in small pieces, put it into a covered jar in the oven with a teacupful of water and 8 oz. of loaf sugar. When the juice is ex- tracted, strain, and dissolve in it 1 oz. of soaked gelatine, with the juice of a lemon and the grated rind. Boil for a few minutes, then pour into a mould, and leave till set. Turn out and serve with cream or custard. For rasp- berry or strawberry moulds use half rhubarb juice and half raspberry or strawberry juice.

THE SINGLE HANDED COOK 150 The same dish may be made with tinned apricots, stewing half the contents of the tin and putting them through a sieve. Then whisk up with the rice and arrange the remaining apricots round with the syrup poured over. Vanilla Snow Eggs (Cold) 327 Beat stiff the whites of four eggs; have ready on the fire a pint of milk sweetened and flavoured with vanilla ; as soon as it boils drop the beaten egg into it by table- spoonsful, and as soon as they become set, dip out carefully; arrange them according to fancy upon a broad dish ; allow the milk in the saucepan to cool a little, and then stir in the beaten yolks of the eggs very gradually. When thick, pour around the snowed eggs, and serve cold. Apple Trifle (Cold) 328 Peel and slice 1 lb. of apples and boil them with two tablespoonsful of water, 1 oz. of brown sugar (or more, if they are very sour) and a small stick of cin- namon, until they are reduced to a pulp ; then add 1 oz. of butter, a few drops of carmine, the grated rind of a lemon, and after beating them up well, pass them through a sieve. Cut some sponge cakes through into two pieces, spread them thickly with the prepared apple, which should be cold, and join the pieces together again. Place the sponge cakes in a deep glass dish and pour some sherry over them, and let them soak for an hour or two before the dish is required. Then cover them with a thick boiled custard; scatter some desiccated cocoanut over the top.

CAKES, BUNS, BISCUITS, AND SCONES 181 oven, decreasing the heat slightly after the first twenty minutes. The cake will need from one and a hah to two hours’ baking. When the cake has risen and browned, the top should be covered with greased paper. The richer and the more liquid the cake mixture, the longer it takes to bake. This mixture may be used for a variety of cakes, of which the following are some examples— Rich Cherry Cake 410 Add 4 oz. of halved cherries, bake in a rather shallow square tin, trim the top and finish with a layer of almond icing, and after baking scatter the top fairly thickly with finely-chopped pistachio nuts, and make an edging all round of glace cherries. Almond Cake 411 Add 3 oz. of currants and raisins, 1 oz. of chopped almond and 1 oz. of shred peel, and strew the top of the cake rather thickly with almonds split in half. Little Pineapple Cakes 412 Add 4 oz. of glace pineapple cut in cubes. Bake in small fancy tins, and when cold ice with Royal icing, flavoured with pineapple essence and tinted pale yellow. Decorate with a small piece of pineapple and four little pieces of angelica to form leaves.

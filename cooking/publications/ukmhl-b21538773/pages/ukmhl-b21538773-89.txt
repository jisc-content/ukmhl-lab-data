MEAT DISHES, POULTRY AND GAME 73 pan is taken from the fire, merely allowing time to once boil up before serving. Oxtail au Gratin (Hot) 140 The tail should be partially cooked in water with plenty of vegetables. It should then be put on one side until cold (the water in which it is cooked will make the foundation of oxtail soup), after which it should be cut into neat pieces and dipped into hot butter. Each piece should then be rolled in fine breadcrumbs, again dipped in hot butter, then in breadcrumbs, and grilled. It can be served with either sauce piquante or sauce tartare. Steak and Cabbage Pudding (Hot) 141 Take 1 lb. steak and kidney, or any two kinds of uncooked meat, and | lb. soaked stale breadcrumbs. Put through the mincing machine, and mix in a very finely chopped onion, a little milk which has been scalded, a little butter, salt, pepper, and two beaten eggs. Cook a very young spring cabbage for twenty minutes. When soft drain it. Butter a basin that has a very tight fitting lid. Pull the leaves off the cabbage, fine the basin with them and then fill it with alternate layers of the mixture and the cabbage leaves. Cover very tightly and boil for one hour, being very careful no water gets into the basin. Turn out and serve with thick or clear gravy poured round.

Many of them have been mentioned in the course of these pages, and as the names frequently convey no idea of their ingredients, a slight description of them is given. The two chief sauces are Veloute—white, and Espagnole—brown Many other sauces are made from these. Allemande is a thicker form of veloute sauce.

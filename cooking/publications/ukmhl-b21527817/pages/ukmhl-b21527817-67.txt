53 THE GENTLEWOMAN. CHAPTER IX. THE ART OF PROLONGING LIFE. THE GENTLEWOMAN AND HER MENAGE. The first glance of her is like the preface of a beautiful book—she presents a world of things, of mind and elegance. The botanist crosses moun- o tains and valleys before he meets with a rare «/ flower, and when he does, it may be likened to the gentlewoman. O “ She openeth her mouth with wisdom ; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. o u She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. u Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.” The gentlewoman exemplifies that her accom- plishments are not incompatible with her duty; she sitteth at the head of the table and distributes God’s bounties to her admiring guests. In her presence small indeed appear all other women. She is conscious of the millions of Avrongs that are The dis- tinction between a gentle- woman and a mo- dern lady.

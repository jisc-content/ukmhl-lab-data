76 DINNERS AND DINNER-PARTIES. Melted butter. May be turned into all kinds of sauces. Fish to choose. FISH. Always choose the freshest of the clay; never be persuaded into buying that which is stale, or has been in the ice-well; such fish is not worth the trouble of cooking, and frequently brings on dy- sentery. MELTED BUTTER, (Dutch fashion). Roll as much fresh butter as required in arrow- root, to give it a thickness and appearance of cream, then melt it in a Dresden pipkin or butter sauce- pan ; well beat up the yolk of one, two, or three eggs with a small quantity of water; stir the yolk, or yolks, and water carefully into the butter, to pre- vent the egg setting; warm it to a simmer, add a little pepper and salt. By adding anchovy, mushroom, capers, or parsley, or any other flavour to this mixture, you will have any sauce you may require: but if parsley, or capers and butter is required, simmer the parsley or capers in the small quantity of water directed to be stirred into the yolk. What is better or easier, there are all kinds of tinctures sold by the herbalist of Covent Garden, and the hostess can flavour in a moment this, as also all kinds of soups.

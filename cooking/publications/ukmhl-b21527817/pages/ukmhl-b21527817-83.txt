SOUPS. 69 rowers, and the like, hut it is not allowable to choke your guests off their dinner. If soup be de- sirable, let it be as the French have it—a potage ; and if it should happen that early in the season you should indulge in green peas or asparagus, do as the French do—boil them not in too much water, and only a little salt; save the water in which they have been boiled, and the following day you may add what has been left of the vegetable, and any little jelly or gravy you may have in the larder, which, with a little pepper, will make a delicious potage. The French reckon one hundred and one potages (vide u Le Cuisinier Royal,” par Viart), which is the best and most economical of all the cookery books ever published, and if you have a garden, nearly every one of the hundred and one may be put on the table at the cost of a few farthings. A turbot dressed as you -would cook a turtle, will make a soup which is preferred by many to turtle soup. TOTAGES, OR SOUPS. Julienne. How to make, see next page. Vegetable. Green peas. Carrot.

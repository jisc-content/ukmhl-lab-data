DINNERS AND DINNER-I’ARTIES. 20 Great ex- cuse to be made in tlie fact that the gentle- women have not been pro- perly in- structed in their household duties, which they are taught to think offensive. If they had been, they would know how to avoid many of their mi- series. Careless in the cha- racter of servants. the condition of woman in society, as at present constituted, is false in itself, and injurious to them : that the education of woman, as at present conducted, is founded on mistaken principles, and tends to increase fearfully the sum of misery and error in both sexes.*’ Great excuse may he made for the women of England of the present century, in the fact that they have never been instructed, but, on the con- trary, taught to consider their household duties as an offensive occupation. The kitchens, for the most part, are dark and underground, the iron utensils generally furnished are black and dirty, not fit to be handled any more than they are fitted for the purpose they are used. If the middle-class women of England had been usefully educated, they would know how to avert many of the miseries of civilised life arising from bad and ignorant cooks, and they would have been spared many grievous trials and embarrassments of the most painful kind. The cook soon learns the extent of her mistress’s knowledge, and advantage is taken accordingly. The evil is increased by the ladies themselves, who are careless in the matter of “ character,” consequently bad servants are enabled to circulate from house to house; but if the mis- tress would only give the true reason why the cook was discharged, we should have better cooking, less dirt, less dyspepsia, and more civility.

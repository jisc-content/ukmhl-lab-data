FISH. 81 SALMON. Friecl slices ancl served hot with the mayonnaise. It is a very nice dish. See page 101. MATELOTE OF SALMON. Take two or three slices of salmon, lay them in a small kettle with a strainer, stew them very gently in a quart of veal gravy, a gill of Harvey’s sauce, for twenty minutes; lift out the strainer with the fish, pour off the gravy into a stewpan, return the strainer with the fish to keep warm, thicken the gravy with arrowroot, season it with pepper and salt, add a quarter of a pint of sherry, a gill of capers, a dozen of pickled gherkins cut in slices; pour the whole back again over the salmon. Let them simmer five minutes, and serve, to be eaten without delay. OYSTERS should be obtained direct from their bed. No- thing can be worse than stale oysters; and it is a strange fact that there is not a shop between Cheap- side and Hyde Park where you can depend upon getting an oyster fresh from Billingsgate; all the shops keep them more or less fresh. A penny-post letter the previous evening to Pym of the Poultry, will ensure your having on the following morning, per Parcel Deliver)’ Company, as many as you may order. G

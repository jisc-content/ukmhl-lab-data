Meat is composed of hone, flesh, muscle, fat, skin, and other substances, all more or less volatile; a right understanding of this is necessary, because if meat is made to boil at a heat of 212 deg., it is indigestible, and the suc- culent juices evaporate. The limit of 205 to 210 deg. affords the most wholesome as well as palatable meat; twenty minutes to each pound will be re- quired at the temperature of 210 deg. The rapid boiling at 212 deg. throws off in the steam all the savoury and volatile goodness of the meat, which is wastefully dissipated in air, and may be dis- covered by the smell of the savoury emanations from the kitchens of persons who do not under- stand the art. Question.—How should soup be made ? Answer.—The meat should be put in a chemi- cally clean saucepan, in cold water, as nearly air- tight as possible, and simmered at a temperature of 205 to 210 deg.: if the meat is suffered to boil at 212 deg., all the volatile goodness escapes, and the soup is often rendered both empyrumatic and arn- moniacal. It is important that the soup should be carefully skimmed during its cookery. Question.—Why is skimming necessary ? Answer.—Because the scum gives a dirty colour to the soup, and renders it necessary to thicken or colour it to disguise the neglect. Question.—In what way would you proceed

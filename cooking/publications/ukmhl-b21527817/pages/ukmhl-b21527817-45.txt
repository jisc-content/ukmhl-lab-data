31 CHILDREN KILLED IN INFANCY. millions have been killed in infancy, by dirty and improperly prepared food. There is scarcely a mother in the United Kingdom that is free from this charge, either through her own ignorance or the persons she has employed, and most persons labouring under disease may safely attribute it to the food they have swallowed in infancy; badly dressed food shortens life, mid destroys more than all the other diseases put together. Not one in ten of the persons that go out as domestic servants knows her alphabet, and not one in twenty can read a book on cookery so as to understand it, but what they lack in reading they make up in impu- dence—sheer impudence; they are largely gifted with that commodity called brass, and will tell a lie and stick to it; they are artful and full of low cunning; and know that their mistresses are frightened, and at their mercy. Nearly every cook disputes the right of her mistress to enter her kitchen, and many a mistress has conceded the point for peace’ sake, and tried to coax the creature into good humour, although she knew her to be a thief. The present system is a national calamity to both man and woman. England produces the best of food, and is supplied with luxuries from every clime, and in unthankfulness the whole is nearly destroyed. Is it to be wondered at that the thoughtful man prefers his club, the yachtman his vessel, the sportsman his country box, and the Children poisoned. Cooks, their dirt. Their im- pudence. The pre- sent system is a national calamity. Is it to be wondered that single men prefer their club, yacht, and country boxes?

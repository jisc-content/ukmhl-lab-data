DINNERS AND DINNER-PARTIES. 80 Turbot. Sole h, la malt re d’hotel. A turbot cooked in the same way is easier and liked better than boiling; but the articles above must be increased according; to size of the fish. It will take an hour or more cooking according to its size. Make a sauce to pour over it on going to table, as follows: A little white sauce. One table-spoonful of anchovy. Two ditto of mushrooms. Six table-spoonfuls of cream. One tea-spoonful of sugar. A little cayenne. Thicken with arrowroot. The last thing, add two dozen oysters without their beards; do not let them come to the boil; add the juice of a lemon, and serve. SOLE A LA MAITRE d’HOTEL. This is a pretty change, and much liked. Have two or three soles filleted, stew the heads and bones in about half a pint of water, place the fillets of the soles as before directed in a flat cotelette-pan in about a wine-glass of this water, simmer two and a half minutes each side, the remainder of the water turn into sauce by putting two ounces of butter, a little cayenne and salt, and chopped parsley, thickening with arrowroot; add a tea-spoonful of eschallot vinegar, or the squeeze of half a lemon, pour over, and serve.

32 DINNERS AND DINNER-PARTIES. The re- medy. The army. The educa- tional council. Where persons intended for cooks or nurses should be educated. idler to travel where his mind may lead him? What is the remedy for the calamity? The Le- gislature is as deeply concerned as any other body; there is an absolute want of fifty thousand Miss Nightingales, and half a million educated pre- parers of food fitted for the human stomach. All these might be provided, and above half a million of females raised to respectable occupations, without costing the country a farthing more than is now expended, which would be a blessing conferred on every class, who, for the last three generations, have degenerated in strength and health, and the calamity has extended itself even to our army. “ In the time of the greatest prince that ever ruled in England, the soldier could march from the Land’s End to John o’Groat’s without a death hap- pening from fatigue.” Now-a-days, a regiment cannot march a few miles without numbers of sol- diers falling, and many dying of exhaustion. It is not generally known that our Legislature, as early as the year 1834, set aside 20,000?. for the promotion of education, and that sum has annually increased until last year, when the sum actually voted for education for the year ending 31st of March, 1860, amounted to the enormous sum of 836,920?. This is the institution at which our nurses and our preparers of food should be educated ; an an- nual sum should be paid thereto by every lady keeping a cook, and none other should be employed

VI ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION. G. Y. to be surpassed in the culinary art by every nation in Europe, the Esquimaux not excepted. It is most gratifying to the Author that the first edition should have called forth the attention of some of our English noblesse, although many (as will be found in the text) were already in the habit of paying daily visits to their kitchens; hut when the Author was writing the first edition, he did not know that her Majesty had from the beginning of her reign paid daily visits of inspection of her kitchen, her pastry, her confectionary, and still rooms. It is not the least of the Author’s gratification that the first edition has called forth the written opinion of a lady (moving in the higher circles) on her own sex, which the Author has, for the benefit of the young ladies, taken the liberty of inserting as the eighth chapter of this edition. The Author has also added a Catechism, founded on the principles of chemistry, so short, so simple, yet the basis of all cookery—calculated for the be- nefit of the whole human race—the knowledge of which is health to all, especially to those who hope to become wives and mothers; and the housewives of England will, by adopting it, promote the health of their household, and learn how to reign as queens of then’ kitchens. February, 1SG2.

38 DINNERS AND DINNER-PARTIES. People that give dinner- parties should confine the attendance to their own house- hold. Those that hire mutes. Dining- rooms small and hot, everything cold but sherry and sloe-juice. CHAPTER VII. DINNER-PARTIES TO BE AVOIDED. The people that give what idiots call dinner- parties always exceed that which they can com- mand from their own establishment. Those people keep a debtor and creditor account of their dinners, and they pay them off in the cheapest possible manner. They have a large dinner one day, and the following they have a similar dinner-party, to lick up the scraps. They hire three or four waiters, dressed in black, who, in the morning, have been employed carrying the corpse, or pulling long faces at a funeral. The very look of these fellows takes away one's appetite, saying nothing of the heat of the dining-room, not larger than a horse-box, in which eighteen or twenty persons are crammed, where everything is cold except the stuff called sherry and the sloe-juice purchased at some advertising Jew wine-merchantâ€™s. Such dinners are a mockery, and ought to be avoided. There is plenty of talk, but there is no conversation.

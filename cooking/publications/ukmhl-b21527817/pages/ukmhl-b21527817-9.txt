ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION. ♦ The first edition having been disposed of, and a second demanded, the Author desires to say that it was written in truthfulness and charity to tiie FIVE MILLIONS OF UNMARRIED DAUGHTERS OF England and Wales, with a view of awakening the attention of their mothers, whom half a century of sleep and bad cookery have rendered so careless that they know not what they eat, nor of what their soup is composed; and what is worse, have so largely contributed to the frightful mor- tality of their infants, as shown in the returns of the Registrar-General. At page 186 of that Re- port are these words: “ The feeding of chil- dren, WHOSE MOTHERS DO NOT SUPPLY THEM WITH MILK, IS UNDOUBTEDLY DEFECTIVE, AND DESERVES THE ATTENTION WHICH IT IS NOW ATTRACTING FROM ENLIGHTENED PHILANTHRO- PISTS.”* The Author has given in the Catechism for Young Ladies (page 116) directions for feeding young children. False gallantry is out of the question. The time has arrived when young ladies, who hope to be wives and mothers, must be taught that badly-dressed food is the opiate of death, and that it is no credit * Deaths of Infants, 1859:—From want of breast-milk, 1017 ; Convulsions arising from improper food, 25,954; Atrophy, 27,990— Total 54,961.

CATECHISM TO BE LEARNED BY ALL. 109 CHAPTER X. CATECHISM FOR YOUNG LADIES, BEING THE WHOLE MYSTERY OF COOKING. Question.—If your mother was ill, wliat would be ordered by the doctor ? Answer.—Gruel, or broth. Question.—How would you make them ? Answer.—For gruel, I would take some fresh groats or oatmeal, and the required quantity I would mix in a basin, and pour the same into a perfectly clean saucepan, placing it oil to a clear fire, carefully stirring so that it should not burn or be smoked. When it came just to the boil, I would pour it into a basin and sweeten, adding a little nutmeg; if wine was ordered, I would add a little. As to broth, I would turn to the best cookery- book, or page 75 of this book, and make it ac- cording to the direction. Question.—Is it essential that a cook should know the multiplication and pence tables, as also the avoirdupois table ? Gruel and broth. Multiplica- tion, pence, and avoir- dupois tables.

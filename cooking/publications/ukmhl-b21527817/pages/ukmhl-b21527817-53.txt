DINNERS TO BE SHUNNED. 39 There are other dinners to be shunned—viz. where the dinner is half made-up at home and the remainder is sent in from a cheap second-rate pastrycook’s, where show and side-dishes are the order, and where the man that looks after the garden is dressed up, or the man that looks after the horse is brought in, smelling of the stable, to help the footman or the little boy with the rows of buttons. What is more disgusting than the every-day English dinners ? The soups thick and tasting of allspice and the essence of dirty saucepans; the thick lumps of clay which they dignify by the name of oyster or lobster-patties, which require powerful spectacles to discover either the oyster or the lobster; cod’s head and shoulders, badly cooked, surrounded with raw parsley, the oyster- sauce nothing more than bill-sticker’s paste, with a very sparing quantity of oysters with their beards on ; soles fried till they are black, or the colour of chocolate; the side dishes, at which every one shakes his head; the eternal vulgar logs of beef ' CD CD and mutton, badly cooked, with a slop of water from the pot in which the vegetables were boiled by way of gravy, and surrounded with raw garden- stuff as garnish; a pair of fowls, done to rags, covered with bill-sticker’s paste, and garnished, as they call it, with a barrowful of raw parsley; followed by jellies made from the gelatine manu- factured by the horse-knacker, and pastry not fit for the stomach of an ostrich. Other dinners to be avoided. The every- day dinner.

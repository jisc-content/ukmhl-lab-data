SUFFERINGS OF THE PRESENT GENERATION. 13 race, ancl that no woman should have the honour of becoming a housewife, or rising to the rank of a gentlewoman, until she made herself acquainted with the culinary art, so as to be able to explain it to those she may have the good fortune to employ. The present generation is suffering from the spoiled children—not to say neglected—of the last generation, and those sufferings will increase until the whole race are so enfeebled that there will not be a healthy woman in the kingdom; the vanity of the last generation has not only caused them to neglect their first duty to their children, but they have anatomically destroyed the shape of nearly all the females in Europe by the use of that rack of torture, called stays or corsets, which has so deformed the female figure that their waists are, or may be likened to, the shape of the wasp; and that deformity descends from the mother to her children, male and female. Anatomists tell us that, if we want to see a type as God made us, we must go to India, or some parts of Italy, where stays are unknown. There is truth in this; we need only look at the picture of “Venus and Adonis” in the National Gallery, and it will be seen that there is no such shape of the female of the present day; and if the neglect of the stomach is continued much longer, the race will not only be deformed, but disease will be added to the deformity.

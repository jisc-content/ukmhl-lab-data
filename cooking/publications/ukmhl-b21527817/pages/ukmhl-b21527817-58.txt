44 DINNERS AND DINNER-PARTIES. Vulgar dinners. with good wine. The wife, in her gentility, thought that this dinner was not grand enough : the idea of a haunch of venison and a small turbot did not coincide with the great ideas of the woman who had forgotten her age, so she set to work to spoil our dinner, and most effectually she did it. She invited some eighteen persons—u the shortness of the invitation to he excused, as it was to partake of a haunch of venison that would be in prime order on the day named.” Every one invited came; the dinner was put on the table at eight o’clock; and the very table must have felt the vulgarity of the load. There were two heavy thick soups, followed by a full-grown turbot, I should think measuring two feet across; at the other end of the table was half of a salmon, weigh- ing at least twenty pounds, with lobster and an- chovy sauces. There was also put on the table six silver side-dishes, containing—God and the cook only knew. Then there came the eternal boiled fowls and bill-sticker’s paste. I forget what was at the other end of the table, but in the middle was a horse’s tongue.* It was nine o’clock, if not past, when the haunch was brought in. I shall never forget its appearance ; at first I thought that they had placed on the dish, by way of joke, the saddle belonging to some postboy, who had rode on it as many years as the lady of the mansion was old. The poor host tried to carve it, but to cut it * There is not a horse that dies in London, or within reach of it, that the tongue is not pickled and dried and sold as a Russian rarity.

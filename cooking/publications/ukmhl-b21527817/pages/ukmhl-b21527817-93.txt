79 fish. Two tea-spoonfuls of anchovy sauce. Three ditto of mushroom catchup. One ditto of sugar. One ditto of lemon juice. A quarter ditto of cayenne. When the fish comes to boil they are done, which will be in two minutes and a half. To eat this dish to perfection it should be served smoking in the pan as cooked. SOLE AU GRATIN. This is a favourite dish, but as only one sole can be cooked at a time, the guests should not exceed four, unless it should be a very large one. The French have an oblong metal dish, mostly in silver, for the purpose, so that it may be served in the dish in which it is cooked. Grease the bottom of the dish with butter to prevent it sticking, chop some parsley and a shallot, spread lightly, add some salt and pepper, a little wine or brandy, lay the sole upon it, spread over the same things on the top of the sole, and some lumps of butter with some button mushrooms, or a table-spoonful of catchup, and a little gravy that you may have by you; rasp over some bread- crumbs, and cook it gently in the oven; it will be done in about half an hour; if a thick fish, it will take longer. Soles filleted stewed. Sole au gratin.

DINNERS AND DINNER-PARTIES. 104 beers called Bass and Allsopp’s cannot stand by the side of it, and it has this advantage, that the per- sons afflicted with stone may drink it with pleasure —with impunity—although probably the water from their cistern or pump might be forbidden. It was analysed by the late Dr. Prout, who told the patient that he might drink it with impunity. If this beer can be obtained of the October brew, it is the best of any, especially if brewed on a cold, clear, blowing day. From November to June, malt liquor, if sound, may be drunk; but from June to November, unless the beer be sound, weak sound claret, or claret-and-water, is to be preferred. BOTTLING. All kinds of malt liquors and wines should be bottled in bright clear weather, because in cloudy weather damp adheres to the bottle, and if bottled in such weather the beer or wine will never be bright. PUNCH Is all the better for keeping. To make thirty gallons : Brandy, two gallons ; rum, five gallons; sugar, thirty-six pounds; the peel of a hundred lemons cut extremely thin; two bottles of curacoa. This will take about twenty-two gallons of water. CIDER-CUP. Two bottles of cider, two glasses of sherry, one of liquor.

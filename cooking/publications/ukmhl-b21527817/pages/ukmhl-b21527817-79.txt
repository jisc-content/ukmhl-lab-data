THE SELECTION OF THE GUESTS. G5 became the fashion to imitate her Majesty in that which to her was a matter of necessity. THE GUESTS. The selection of the guests should not be for- gotten. No Amphitryon neglects it; choose them for their good qualities, let them be amiable and sociable; do not invite those whose vanity would usurp the talk; such people are empty and dis- agreeable, and no more to be admired than the wasp’s-bite disposition of some other people: above all, never invite a garrulous woman; she will detain her soup-plate on the table talking nonsense until the fish is entirely spoiled. There is a class of woman that should be ex- cluded from every dinner. I mean the woman that takes a breakfast, and afterwards consumes a couple of mutton chops, or an omelette or sweet- bread, at her luncheon, and finishes at Gunter’s, or some other pastrycook’s. Such women never do credit to any dinner. A French author describes her under the head “ Des difficiles,” and gives the following conversation : u Madame, vous offrirai-je du salmis?” “ Je ne mange jamais de ragouts.” “ Accepterez-vous de ce vol-au-vent delaitances?” “ Je n’aime pas le poisson.” “ line tranche de chevreuil ? ” “ Le gibier m’incommode.” F Selection of guests.

Answer.—It is so believed, and the Registrar- General’s return of the mortality among infants is frightful, and supports the supposition. Question.—If your mother died, how would you feed the baby Answer.—If it was possible, I would have, twice a day, a pint of fresh-milked asses’ milk, and if that did not agree with the child’s stomach, I would add from one to three drops of pure old Hollands every time the baby was fed, but I would cease to do so when I found that the baby did not require the spirit. Question.—If asses’ milk was not to be got, what would you do ? Answer.—If in London, I would go to the dairy in Hyde Park and engage for a morning and evening supply from the same cow, to be sent in a can with a lock, one key to be kept by the dairy-woman and the other by myself. If I was in the country, I would make the same engagement with a country dairy. I would, on feeding the child, reduce the cow’s milk by adding one-third of scalding water and a lump of sugar. If the milk disagreed, I would add from one drop to three drops of pure Hollands, but I would stop the spirit the moment I observed that the baby was quiet and the milk agreed with it.

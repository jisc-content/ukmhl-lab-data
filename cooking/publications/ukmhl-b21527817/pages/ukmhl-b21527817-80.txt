G6 DINNERS AND DINNER-PARTIES. u Que pourrai-je done vons servir ? ” 11 Je ne sais. J’attendrai. Je vais voir.” “ Oli, allez au diable, et n’approchez jamais de ma salle-^-manger!” A CONTINENTAL ENTERTAINMENT TO TWELVE HUNDRED PERSONS. The dif- ference be- tween a foreign and an English entertain- ment. That our English public dinners are little better than rabid entertainments is generally admitted, and will bear no comparison with an entertainment on the Continent. On the 18th of August, 18G1, there was an Artistic Congress at Antwerp, fol- lowed by a dinner: “ The guests, amounting to upwards of twelve hundred persons, took their places without the slightest confusion or crowding; and after the lapse of less than half an hour, the repast—a hot one, and really hot—was served with a promptness and precision which was perfectly marvellous; plates, &c., changed, and each dish handed round in its order, without any of that roaring and scrambling, and 1 Yes, sir! ’ ‘ Coming, sir! ’ which are uniformly the undignified characteristics of a so-called public dinner to some eighty or a hun- dred guests at an English dinner. All honour be given to the two houses of M. Allard, restaurant of Brussels, and Messrs. Lambo, freres et soeur, of Antwerp, who jointly provided this magnificent banquet.

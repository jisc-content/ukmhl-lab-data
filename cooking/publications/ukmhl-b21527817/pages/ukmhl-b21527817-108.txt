DINNERS AND DINNER-PARTIES. 94 A leg of mutton. Observe : You may take it as a certain rale that whenever you smell the oclour of cookery it is a sign of bad cooking—the juices are evaporating in air. That homely joint, the leg of mutton, may, by adopting a French refinement, be turned into a dinner fitted for the highest enjoyment. Make a bed, at the bottom of your ham saucepan, composed of— Some slices of ham or bacon. Bones of anything broken. Slices of mutton or beef. (These two are mostly thrown into the hog-tub.) Four carrots, six onions (cut up). Three bay-leaves. Some thyme. Three cloves. A bunch of parsley. Some leeks. Celery. Salt, pepper, mace, and allspice. A small quantity of any gravy or soup that you may have by you. Simmer gently for about five and a half hours. Lift it from its bed, strain as much of the gravy as is requisite, free from fat, and pour over and serve; put away the bed in a clean pan, and the following day make a potage, of course taking away the fat.

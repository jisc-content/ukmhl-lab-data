9 THE DESTRUCTION OF FOOD. How frequently we hear people eloquently dis- cussing the losses and miseries of an occasional O bad harvest; but those losses and miseries are as nothing in comparison to the daily destruction of human food, occasioned by ignorance and pride in the process of its cookery: the confiscation amounts to six times the sum levied in the shape of poor- rates. There are 3,745,463 houses in England and Wales, consequently there are as many kitchens, and it is a very moderate calculation to average the waste and loss at 51. per house. In this sum no calculation is made for doctors and apothecariesâ€™ bills, or the attendant expenses. Nor is the shortening of life, or the funeral ex- penses, taken into consideration.

DINNERS AND DINNER-PARTIES. 52 The ball- room and conversa- tion. and backbiting in society; for these women, having their minds full of useful knowledge, would have something to talk about, and would compare notes about domestic affairs instead of the stupid com- pany notes about the size of their crinoline, and the last flounces and ribbons. The author may be allowed to add to the fore- going, that the dress, follies, and delusions of the ball-room are the certain results of a bad educa- tion. It is very pretty and very poetical for hobbe- dehoys and very young men to talk of “lilies and roses,” but lilies and roses were never met with in a ball-room, and were never known to re- quire the fashionable aid of pearl powder, or washes, or the perfumes called “ Kiss me quick,” “ Stolen kisses,” or “ Box his ears.” They are the talismans to the ball-room under-toned, lively, but doubtful conversation, and mothers ouo'lit not to be sur- prised that sensible men should think such lilies and such roses are nothing more than useless weeds, of which most mothers have an abundant crop.

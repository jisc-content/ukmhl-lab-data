To be well mixed, heated, and poured over the bird, it having been previously sliced, so that the sauce may mix with its own gravy.

The following are pretty additions to either hot or cold meats or fish. SALAD, For Eight Persons, should be as fresh as can be got, and well picked and cleaned; and, the very last thing, well cut up and drained, and dried in a clean cloth, and not to be put to the mixture until it is to be put on the table: The yolks of four new-laid eggs, well beaten. Three table-spoons of fresli salad oil, poured in drop by drop whilst stirring. Two ditto of French vinegar, to be gently stirred in. One ditto of anchovy sauce, to be gently stirred in.

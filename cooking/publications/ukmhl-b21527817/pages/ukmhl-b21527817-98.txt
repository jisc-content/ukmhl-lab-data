84 DINNERS AND DINNER-PARTIES. POULTRY AND GAME. To choose. fresli large mussels, liave them washed and brushed clean, put them into a pan with some salt and water and fine oatmeal for a day or so, and they will fatten and cleanse themselves; when wanted, put them into a saucepan and on the fire, and when they open pour them into a pan, pick them one by one, take out the small piece of weed in each fish and put them aside; let the liquor settle, strain off as much as you want, put in a quarter of a pound of butter with a little pepper, and thicken with arrowroot, and just before you want it, put in the mussels to warm, but not to boil. This is a very nice sauce, and may be used wherever oyster sauce is required, or eaten with sippets of toasted bread. Make it a rule to deal with a first-rate poulterer; it is better to pay a little more than to buy cheap poultry, which are lean and generally the produce of robbery. There is a first-rate and the largest poulterer in England in Leadenhall-market, Mr. Henry D. Brooke; where you will not only have the pick of nearly the whole of the poultry sent to London, but you will get it at the market price; a penny-post letter the evening before you want either poultry or game will secure wliat you want. For cold chickens and poultry use salad, page 100, or mayonnaise, page 101.

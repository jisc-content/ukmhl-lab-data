BOILING. This word should be banished by every cook. In the process of boiling, a change takes place according to the heat that is applied to the meat; the juices mix with the water and solids dissolve, and thus the water, containing the goodness of the meat, usually finds its way into the sink. Recollect that the more the meat is subjected to a boiling tempe- rature the more it becomes indigestible. The meat should be put into cold water and carefully watched until it comes to a gentle sim- mer, the temperature should not be raised beyond a simmer, and twenty minutes for each pound will be the best guess of its being sufficiently cooked.

GAME AND POULTRY. 87 persons, and each convive will want to taste each dish. Pigeons, when in season, cooked in the same manner, are equally good, and make a change— such a change that those who taste never forget it. Grouse and partridges treated the same way are better than roasted. A young turkey poult dressed in the same way is a very inviting dish. PHEASANT. A pheasant cut up as above and stewed in two ounces of butter, the oyster liquor of a couple of dozen oysters, with cayenne and salt, thickened with a spoonful of arrowroot, the oysters thrown in just before serving merely to plump them, is a very nice dish, and much better than roasted. Roast fowl, chickens, partridges, grouse, and pheasants, are twice the size and better if stuffed with two ounces of butter, salt, and cayenne to taste, and as many mushrooms as you can put in ; baste well, and set a toast under, and when done, serve on the toast. The French say : “To the uninitiated this bird is as a sealed book; eaten after it has been lulled but three days it is insipid and bad, neither so deli- cate as a pullet, nor so odoriferous as quail. Cooked at the right moment, the flesh is tender and the flavour sublime, partaking equally the qualities of Pheasant stewed. Pheasant stuffed with wood- cocks.

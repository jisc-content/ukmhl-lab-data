DINNERS AND DINNER-PARTIES. CHAPTER I. IK GERMANY, HOLLAND, FRANCE, AND SPAIN, THE LADIES OF THE UPPER CLASS REGULATE THE MENAGE. Among the whole tribe of women called cooks, there are not ten that are worthy of their salt; there are plenty of hooks, hut they are too ignorant or too idle to look at one, and, unfortunately, the ladies that are educated at the superficial places called hoarding-schools or colleges are taught to helieye that the art of cookery, which is their first and paramount duty, is a degrading occupation. If a chapter of the introduction to Dr. Kit- chener’s u Cook’s Oracle” was daily read aloud at those places, every pupil would learn her duty, and the poor things that are turned into poor teachers, poor milliners, poor honnet-builders, and poor shirt- makers, would be enabled to satisfy their hunger by an useful occupation; they would earn the B Cooks not worthy their salt. Ladies taught to believe the art of cookery de- grading, although it is their paramount duty. Teachers, milliners, &c., if taught the art of cookery, would get a liveli- hood.

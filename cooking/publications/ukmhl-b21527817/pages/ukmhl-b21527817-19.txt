THE END OF BOARDING-SCHOOL GIRLS. 5 learn tilings which it had been well for them they had never known; they are all, as it is called, edu- cated ; they are all dressed alike, and it is impos- sible to distinguish the one from the other, but if there is a preference, we should give it to the daughters of the tradesmen ; many of these super- ficially-educated girls have to seek their liveli- hoods, and of necessity fall into the hopeless con- dition of that spiritless and friendless class called teachers of the nonsense they have acquired, and so it circulates until you find a pianoforte in nearly every lodging-house kitchen. Many parents die, leaving their offspring with- out the means of subsistence; others become un- fortunate, and then the poor girls are awakened to their miserably mistaken education; they struggle to live, they fight with poverty, but with such an education they are helpless, and fall victims to their lives ending in misery. Who is to blame for this misery but the parents, who have kept up false appearances, probably under false hopes of getting their daughters married, and cheated their girls into stupid nonsense, fine sentiment, and non- sensical talking by the poor unfortunate creatures called governesses, who would be blessed if they had the happiness or the genuine sense of a milk- maid.

She is as regardless of how a A piano* in nearly every lodging- house kitchen. The result. When the young wo- men “come out.” Their ig- norance.

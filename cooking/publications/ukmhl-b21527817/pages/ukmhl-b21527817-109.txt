This saucepan will also do for cooking a turbot or other fish, and if you go to the expense of having one made to the size of your fish strainer, it may be lifted out on to the dish without the fish being broken, and may be cooked with the same appear- ance as it had on the fishmonger’s slab. This saucepan is excellent either on the gas- stove, or hot-plate, or on board a yacht, or on a turf-fire in the Highlands; and in boiling you cook the joint according to its weight, giving twenty minutes for every pound of meat.

FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE ON CRINOLINE. 17 wish the Registrar-General would tell us the exact number of deaths by burning occasioned by this absurd and hideous custom. I wish, too, that people who wear crinoline could see the indecency of their own dress as other people see it. A re- spectable elderly woman stooping forward, invested in crinoline, exposes quite as much of her own person to the patient lying in the room as any opera dancer does on the stage. But no one will ever tell her this unpleasant truth.‚Äù c

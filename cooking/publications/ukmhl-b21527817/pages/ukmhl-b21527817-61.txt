ADVICE TO AVOID THE STUFF CALLED WINE. 47 is a foaming glass of Barclay and Perkins; it is no sucli tiling, it is purchased at the first public-house. The publican invariably draws off one-third of a butt, and fills it up with water and the following mixture: Coculus Indicus and beans—as a stupifier. Quassia—as a bitter. Coriander-seeds, capsicums, caraway-seeds, gin- ger, grains of paradise, and pounded oyster-shells. This beautiful brew is set off with a fine head— not unlike a young widow's cap—which is produced by a mixture of green vitriol, alum, and salt. In most places these impostor dinner - givers begin by calling on the Deity to sanctify the filth they place upon the table, and end by turning up the whites of their eyes, calling upon the Lord to make them truly thankful for the stuff they have received. If you value your health, you will never accept an invite to any of these kind of parties; you will thereby avoid swallowing a conglomeration of filth, together with the poisonous Cape which they call sherry; sloe-juice, made in London, which they call port; and champagne, manufactured on the banks of the Thames, with fine silver labels, at fifteen shillings per dozen, bottles included. Avoid such parties and such people, and you will save many a headache, while you may reckon every refusal as a dozen nails from your coffin.

LONDON REGAN PALL, TRENCH & CO., 1, PATERNOSTER SQUARE 1882WELLCOME INSTITUTE LIBRARY Coll. welMOmec Call No. Q~T • (The rights of translation and of reproduction are reserved.)PREFACE. — -+o« — The following “ menus,” and the recipes contained in this hook, have, with a few exceptions, been carried out in a small household, with one cook, and without the assistance of a kitchenmaid. They may seem elaborate at first to those young housekeepers who are ignorant of cooking, and who think that fresh rolls, ices, and a variety of made dishes, must always be had from a confectioner. My advice is this: “ Do not serve at your table dishes that cannot be made at home.” The so-called plain cooking which exists in many English houses is extravagant cooking. A “ plain cook ” does not know how to use up her small scraps of meat, fish, or vegetables ; she has little knowledge of soups or sauces, and has no notion that in throwing away a spoonful of gravy she is wasting the foundation of a good dish. A plain cook—I mean one who can roast and bake well—ought, with a few directions, to be able to makePREFACE. VI almost any dish described in this book. She must have patience and perseverance. So must her mistress. She must attend to the smallest details ; she must take as much pride in serving up a plain dish of rissoles as the most elaborate made dish. If a dish be too salt, or too hot with pepper, it is a disgrace to the cook to send it to table, as she could, by a little contrivance, have remedied the defect and saved annoyance to her mistress. I am not giving directions for preparing meat, fish, roasting, etc., in this book; every mistress will provide her cook with a “ Mrs. Beeton ” or an “ Eliza Acton,” one of which no kitchen should be without. Where quantities are given in these recipes, those quantities must be carefully followed, as the success of a dish depends on the accuracy with which the directions are followed. The time for cooking certain dishes has intentionally not been given. A cook must understand her stove, and gradually calculate for herself the times required. The following dishes have been made on a close range in the winter, and on a Leoni’s gas-stove in the summer, and the time for cooking each dish has varied according to which stove was used. In stewing meats the cook must remember that they must simmer, and never boil. If they boil, the meat will be hard. The same with sauces or custardsTil PREFACE. in which there are yolks of eggs; if they boil they will curdle. Again, with frying, the directions must be followed absolutely; if they are not, the things fried will be brown, greasy, and indigestible. As the dishes come. out from table, the cook must remove the remains of each dish, no matter how small, on to clean plates; the remains of gravy into jars. The next morning the mistress should find everything in order in her larder; she will at once see what remains, and give directions how each article can be used. The scraps of meat and bones will be simmered down for stock or gravy, and on no account must the stock of yesterday be added to what is made to-day. Use some of to-day’s to lengthen out what was left yester- day, if necessary; but if you add always yesterday’s stock to all that you are making fresh, you will have sour stock and gravy at the end of the week, and must not be astonished if your family have indigestion and are told by the doctor, “Never touch soups and sauces.” With great respect for the very variable views of the medical profession on the subject of wholesome food, I would suggest that “never touch sour soups and sour sauces ” would express as much as their experience really justifies on this subject. The scraps of each day must, then, be used up each day, and not all collected together to make a sour con-PREFACE. Till coction at the end of the week. The scraps of meat —those not required for stock—will, used together, make rissoles, savoury moulds, salads, curries, or “ gratins.” The scraps of vegetables will make a soup, a salad, a “ chartreuse,” a “ macedoine,” “ gratin,” or curry. The fish will make patties, curries, rissoles, “ gratins,” or a mayonnaise salad. If you wish to have wholesome cookery, make a rule never to have bottled sauces in the house. Your sauces must be made with fresh meat and vegetables. I make one exception in favour of mushroom ketchup (as it is not always possible to get mushrooms), though I think it is better to do without it, unless you make your own mushroom ketchup and bottle it in very small bottles, so as to use the contents of each bottle as soon as it is opened. Do not allow perquisites. Remember that roast- beef dripping and the skimmings from the “ pot au feu ” are the best fats for frying; other drippings are also good (when properly prepared), and do not let your cook persuade you to the contrary. If you have not enough dripping, you must, of course, supplement it with the best olive oil, butter, or lard; but remember that lard is the least nice medium for frying in. In a household of five persons all told, and using on an average twenty-five shillingsworth of meat a week, of which one joint is a sirloin, there ought to be alwaysPREFACE. IX enough dripping for ordinary frying purposes. For instance, a sirloin of ten pounds will give about a pound of dripping; a leg of English mutton will give about three-quarters of an ounce of dripping to every pound of meat; a shoulder will usually give rather more. Dripping and other fats, if properly clarified and kept in a cool place, can be used over and over again. The cook must have two jars of fat always ready for use— one which she will keep to fry her fish in, and one in which to fry her meats and vegetables. Impress economy on your cook, but let it be dis- tinctly understood that economy means knowing how to use things properly, and does not mean parsimony. Using stale eggs, commonly called “pudding eggs,” and salt butter for cooking is extravagant stinginess, and is not economy. The result will probably be a failure, while a different dish, with properly chosen but cheaper materials, would have been a success. It is not economical to give beefsteaks in the kitchen and use rumpsteaks in the parlour. A pound and a quarter of beefsteak will not go as far as a pound of rumpsteak; besides which, the beefsteak, usually tough, will have to be stewed, and that necessitates stock and vegetables. I do not advise “locking up” if you want to be really economical—I mean in the sense of measuring out spoonfuls of tea and lumps of sugar. Of course it is not advisable to leave out Icltc/g quantities, such as a chest of tea or a bag of sugar. LetX PREFACE. tlrjre always be plenty in your cook’s charge, and make her responsible for it. It is wise to let your cook know your estimate of what a week’s feeding ought to cost. From twelve to fourteen shillings per head a week is ample, and you ought to be able to live exceedingly well on that. This is the calculation for a London household, where you have even to buy parsley. If the weekly books are higher than they should be, it is quite as often the fault of the mistress as of the cook. Carelessness in ordering is as great a fault as carelessness in con- suming. I often hear a mistress say, “ My cook has so little idea !” Where is she to get her ideas ? She may be twenty-five years old and have lived in four situations; her only ideas are what she has gathered in those previous situations. You, on the other hand, have lunched and dined out frequently, have probably travelled and dined at good restaurants; your husband belongs to a club, and can give you the benefit of his experience; therefore it is you who ought to bring the ideas. The comfort and, I may say, health of your house depend on your knowledge, and the management of the detail of a house really takes very little time. An hour every morning is all that is required.PREFACE. XL In ordering a dinner—I mean a dinner of several courses—use j udgment. Your cook has only one pair of hands; so do not order several dishes that all require attendance at the same time. Do not, for instance, order three dishes running that require frying. In writing out your bills of fare, write them out in English, except, of course, in those cases where the dish is a purely foreign one. For instance, a "risotto,” a "mayonnaise,” and other dishes of that sort cannot he translated into English, there being no equivalent for them. To translate “ saddle of mutton,” “ mint sauce,” or “plum-pudding” into French, or what is intended to be French, is a barbarism. I must apologize if I have occasionally betrayed the secret of some favourite dish revealed by a friend. I have learned recipes or had suggestions for recipes from many sources, sometimes in a friend’s house, sometimes in small inns, especially in France and Italy, where the man or woman who waits at table is usually the cook of the establishment.

Put in a large saucepan 6 or 7 pounds of silver side of the round of beef, 5 quarts of cold water. Before it begins to boil, skim it very carefully. When all the scum has been removed, add 5 turnips, 6 carrots, 1 leek, 2 parsnips, 2 large onions, 1 good bunch of parsley, 1 head of celery, 6 cloves, a few peppercorns, 1 ball of browning, salt to taste (about 2 tablespoonfuls for this quantity); simmer very slowly for 5 or 6 hours. Be- fore using, strain through a hair sieve. The beef is good hot or cold, but especially cold. This soup ought to be 'perfectly clear. If it is not so, it is either because some of the scum has not been removed, or principal^ because the soup has been allowed to boil. If the beef is used hot, serve a piquante or tomato sauce with it, or thicken a little of the soup and serve that. The vegetables can be chopped, pressed into a mould, and turned out cold with a mayonnaise sauce, 2.—English Clear Soup. 3 to 4 pounds of gravy beef. Cut the meat into pieces, and fry them in a little butter to colour them;SOUPS. 11 put them into 3 or 4 quarts of cold water, let them simmer, and skim carefully. When no scum is left, put into the saucepan 2 carrots, 2 turnips, half a head of celery, 1 bunch of savoury herbs, 4 cloves, 2 blades of mace, some peppercorns, and salt to taste. Simmer i gently from 6 to 8 hours, strain through a hair sieve. When cold, skim off any fat there may be. N.B.—Soup made in this manner should be perfectly clear. If a cook requires to “ clear ” her soup, as some do, with whites of eggs, etc., it is only because she has not taken sufficient care at first with it. Her soup must simmer, and never boil. If once it boils, it will become thick and muddy. 3.—Francatelli’s Bonne Femme Soup. Chop up finely 1 cucumber, 4 lettuces, 1 handful of chervil; place these in a small saucepan with 2 ounces of butter, a little nutmeg, pepper, and salt; simmer gently for about 10 minutes, then add a tablespoonful of flour; moisten with 3 pints of veal stock, stir over the fire until the soup boils, then set it on one side to simmer; now stir into it very carefully 6 yolks of eggs, half a pint of cream, and a small dessert-spoonful of sugar. N.B.—Some may think this soup an expensive one. It need not be so if the housekeeper will arrange to have for the previous day’s dinner a boiled knuckle of veal, or a dish of calves’ feet—2 are sufficient—as the12 WHOLESOME COOKERY. water in which they have been boiled is the proper stock for this soup. She can also arrange that her sweet, the day she requires the soup, should be one necessitating whites of eggs. 4.—Macedonian Soup. Put at the bottom of a stewpan 2 slices of ham or a piece of lean bacon, then 2 carrots, 2 potatoes, 2 turnips, 2 onions, 1 head of celery, all cut up very small; add your stock; season with pepper and salt. Let it simmer very gently until all the vegetables are reduced to a pulp; if too thick, add a little stock before you finish simmering. Now rub it all through a hair sieve, and before dishing up add a little cream. 5.—Livonian Soup. Chop up, scald, and drain the following vegetables: —carrots, turnips, parsley, leeks, and onions. Fry them in butter; add a couple of small handfuls of scalded rice, and the quantity of stock you require. Let it simmer until quite done. Pass it through a sieve, add a small quantity of boiled cream, stir in a few yolks of eggs, and pour over some fried sippets. 6.—Italian Soup. Parboil separately some heads of celery, cabbage, carrots, turnips, and leeks; drain them and chopSOUPS. 13 them up small; put them in a saucepan with butter, pepper, and salt; let them simmer gently; add stock and some finely chopped fowl livers; then add some previously boiled macaroni, some grated Parmesan cheese; simmer all together and serve. 7. —Macaroni Soup. Scald some macaroni in salt and water; put it in some good stock, and simmer till quite cooked; serve with grated Parmesan and Gray ere cheeses. This makes a good and simple white macaroni soup, if milk and a little butter, pepper, and salt are used in place of the stock. 8. —Solferino Soup Is made with French beans, white haricot beans, new potatoes, young carrots, young green peas, a few spoonfuls of tomato purde, chopped parsley, chervil, celery, all thoroughly simmered in stock till quite cooked. Add in the tureen some fried sippets. 9.—Peasant Soup. Chop cabbage, carrots, onions, and celery; toss them in butter a pale brown; add a little stock, and simmer very gently for 3 hours; now add some water that haricot beans or lentils have been cooked in, simmer another half-hour; now add some very finely chopped sorrel and lettuce; let it all come to a boil, and pour it into the tureen over some fried sippets.14 WHOLESOME COOKERY. 10. —Lent Soup. 1 tablespoonful of cornflour, 1 small teacupful of milk; mix smooth, and add 1£ pint of veal stock; put it in a saucepan, stir it over the fire. Put 2 yolks of eggs in a cup, break them with a spoon. When the soup is no longer boiling, add a little by degrees to the yolks of eggs, and then stir it all into the soup- Now stir in a little cream or butter and serve. 11. —Oyster Soup. 1 dessert-spoonful of cornflour in a bason, mixed with a little cold milk and thoroughly blended without lumps; to this add 1 pint of good white stock, 1 gill of cream, salt and pepper. When it begins to simmer, drop in 1 dozen of oysters and simmer a few minutes. 12.—Chestnut Soup. Take the shells off some chestnuts; put them in boiling water, until they can easily be peeled. Now let them simmer, but not boil, in your stock; flavour with pepper and salt. When quite cooked, pass all through a hair sieve, put it back on the fire, add a little cream, and serve with fried sippets. 13.—Fonds d’Artichauds Soup. The underparts of some French artichokes; boil them till done in some water in which you have blendedSOUPS.. 15 a little flour, and flavoured with salt and lemon-juice. When cooked, mash them and add them to some good white stock, simmer together for some time, pass through a hair sieve, put back on the fire, add some butter and cream, and serve. This soup is very good made with the canned artichokes, which are already cooked, and would not, of course, require boiling separately. 14—White Sago Soup. 1J ounce of sago, 1 quart milk, salt, and pepper; boil it all together till the sago is cooked (if too thick add stock or water); add 1 ounce of butter, stir it into the soup, and serve. 15.—Brown Sago Soup. Proceed as above, only use stock instead of milk. 16.—Herb Soup. Wash 1 handful of sorrel, chop it up, put it in a saucepan with 1 ounce of butter ; stew for about half an hour, add water or stock or half milk and water, pepper and salt, and 1 teacupful of fine bread-crumbs. Stew from to 2 hours; beat 1 yolk of egg in the tureen; pour the hot soup over, stirring all the time with a wooden spoon. This recipe is good with lettuces and spinach mixed.1G WHOLESOME COOKERY. 17. —Soubise Soup. 1£ pint of water, half a pint of milk, 1J ounce of butter, 2 onions, 5 ounces of bread, the yolks of one or two eggs or 1 gill of cream, pepper and salt to taste. Cut the bread into very thin slices, boil it in the water and milk, with the onions thinly sliced; add the butter, pepper, and salt; when thoroughly stewed to a pulp, rub through a wire sieve. Now set it again on the fire, and let it simmer for a few minutes, and just before sending it to table add the cream or the yolks of eggs. 18. —Barley Soup. Half an ounce of butter, 1 dessert-spoonful of pre- pared barley blended together; add 1 pint of white stock or milk, flavour with pepper and salt, boil together for 15 minutes, and serve with fried sippets. Must be quite smooth. 19.—Tomato and Pumpkin Soup. Stew together equal quantities of tomatoes and pumpkin with a small quantity of onion, pepper and salt, stock or water. When quite cooked, strain through a hair sieve, put it back on the fire, add a little milk and butter or cream. Serve with, fried sippets.S0UF8. 17 20.—Tomato and Okra Soup. Take a tin of the puree of tomatoes, pass it through a sieve, add equal quantity of water or stock or milk and water, a little onion and dried vegetables, pepper and salt, half a small tin of okras. Stew gently for three-quarters of an hour; add in at the last a small lump of butter. N.B.—This soup is, of course, excellent with fresh tomatoes and vegetables, but as a winter soup with canned and dried vegetables is strongly to be recom- mended. If preferred plain, leave out the okra, and thicken with bread-crumbs or sago or rice. 21.—Piedmontese Soup. Let some rice soak in hot water for about 1 hour ; let a cabbage (broken in pieces) soak also in hot water and salt about the same time. Drain both rice and cabbage. Place them in a saucepan with butter or dripping, a chopped onion, pepper, salt, and nut- meg ; add either water or stock or gravy. Let all this stew together for some time, and just before serving add some grated Parmesan cheese. Another way.—Stew some cabbages with carrots, onions, bunch of herbs, and plenty of butter. When nearly cooked, add some stock, or the water the cab- bages have cooked in, and fine bread-crumbs. Let CWHOLESOME COOKERY. 13 all stew for a few minutes, and add grated cheeses, Parmesan and Gruykre mixed. 22.—Conde Soup. Stew some red haricot beans with a few vegetables and stock. When thoroughly cooked and flavoured v ith pepper and salt, pass it all through a hair sieve; put it back for a few minutes on the fire, add a small lump of butter, and serve with fried sippets. N-B-—This soup can be made without meat stock. 23.—Lentil Soup. Made exactly like the above, using lentils instead of red haricot beans. 24.—Crecy Soup. Chop up some young and red carrots, put them in a saucepan with a lump of butter, add a pinch of sugar. Let this cook very gently, keeping the sauce- pan well covered, but occasionally stirring. Next add some stock and a raw peeled potato; simmer very gently; flavour, of course, with pepper and salt. Now pass through a hair sieve, put it back on the fire, add some stock, let it come to one boil, and serve with fried sippets. Another way.—Cut into pieces some carrots, turnips, onions, and celery. Scald them in boiling water, strain19 SOUPS. them, and put them on a slow fire with a good lump of butter, a couple of thin slices of ham and your stock; pass through a hair sieve after it has cooked a short time. Now put it all back on the fire, and let it stew gently for two hours; skim it carefully and serve with sippets. A third way is to add rice after the above has been through a hair sieve, and dispense with the sippets. I 25. —Faubonne Soup. Cut in shreds some lettuces, sorrel, and celery ; toss them in 1 ounce of butter with some small onions (previously scalded), add your stock, flavour with pepper and salt, stew till cooked. At the last moment add a purde of peas and serve. 26. —Julienne Soup. 3 carrots, 3 turnips, white part of 3 heads of celery, some leeks, and a little onion. Cut all these into thin shreds, and put them into a stewpan with 2 ounces of butter, a little salt, a small lump of sugar ; stir lightly over the fire, and fry of a light colour. Then place it in a saucepan with your stock, set it to simmer, and remove all the scum very carefully as it rises ; add 2 cabbage lettuces, a little tarragon and chervil, a little sorrel. Simmer till the vegetables are completely cooked.20 WHOLESOME COOKERY. 27.—Lettuce Soup. Scald some young lettuces, drain them thoroughly; put them to simmer in some stock or broth, until they are thoroughly cooked. Take them off the fire; mash them up as smooth as possible with a wooden spoon; place all again on the fire; add more stock, if necessary; simmer again for a few minutes, with a little cream, and serve. 28.—Spring Soup. Cut carrots, turnips, and leeks into small pieces; toss them in 1 ounce of butter, stirring all the time; when slightly brown, put them in some stock and simmer for about 1 hour. Then add some peas, French beans, and asparagus tops (all previously boiled) ; simmer again for 8 or 10 minutes, skim carefully, and serve. 28a.—Plain Bread Soup. li pint of cold water, 3 ounces of bread in a lump, 1 ounce of butter, 1 yolk of egg, half a teaspoonful of salt, a little pepper. Put the bread in a saucepan, with the water and half an ounce of butter, the pepper and salt; let it simmer gently for li hour; stir it occasion- ally, and break the bread with a wooden spoon when it has become quite soft. Just before dishing up the soup stir in the other half-ounce of butter and the yolk of21 SOUPS. eo-cr • let it simmer a moment, but not boil, or the egg will curdle. 29. Plain Vegetable Soup (without Meat). Carrots, turnips, onions, leeks, celery, pepper, and salt. Cut all into small pieces; toss them up in 1 or 2 ounces of butter, till they are thoroughly browned. Place all this in the saucepan with the water some lentils or haricot beans have been boiled in; simmer for 1 hours. Put in your tureen some fried sippets ; pour the hot soup over. 30.—Simple Pea Soup. Put some young green peas in some boiling water; pepper and salt. When thoroughly cooked, add 2 ounces of fresh butter. Pour this in the tureen, over some sippets already fried in butter (those who object to butter may use 1 or 2 gills of cream). 31.—Rice and Pumpkin Soup. Cut some pumpkin into small pieces; put it in a saucepan, with some onion, a clove, piece of celery, pepper, salt, and water. When thoroughly cooked, pass it through a hair sieve. Put it back on the fire, with some rice which has previously soaked in warm water; add a little butter; simmer until the rice is cooked, and serve.WHOLESOME COOKERY. 22 32.—Turnip and Rice Soup. Simmer very gently together, until cooked, turnips and rice (more turnip than rice), with some butter and water. When cooked, pass through a hair sieve ; put it back on the fire; add some milk, pepper, and salt; simmer again; stir frequently with a wooden spoon; at the last moment, add a little butter and some cream. Serve with fried sippets, or, if the soup is not very thick, with some rice boiled separately as for curry. 33. —Plain Turnip Soup. Have ready some cooked turnips—in fact, a puree of turnips, very smooth and nicely dressed with pepper and salt. Place some stock in a saucepan; thicken it slightly with sago; when the sago is cooked, add the turnips; let it simmer for a few minutes, and serve. The addition of some cream is an im- provement. 34. —Rice and Pea Soup. Have ready a well-flavoured purde of peas and some cooked rice. Add them together to some stock; simmer together for a few minutes; add a little cream, and serve. 35.—Rice Cream Soup. Cook some rice thoroughly in chicken stock ; pass through a hair sieve; put it back on the fire; add23 SOUFS. some more of the chicken stock to that which the rice has boiled in; add a little cream, pepper, and salt; simmer for a few minutes, and serve. This is a good way of using the water some chickens have boiled in. For a change, add some chopped, scalded chervil. 36.—Game Soup. Remains of any cold game ; boil them down with any game bones you may have, 1 onion, some herbs, a few vegetables, pepper, and salt. Then take the meat off the bones; mince it in the machine; pass it through a hair sieve: strain the stock.

It must be about as thick as pea soup. A little cream added to it is an improvement. If there are no bones or stock, make this soup with half milk and half water, and after the soup has been strained, and just before dishing it \ip, stir in 1 ounce of butter. 41. —Monaco Soup. Fry some nicely shaped pieces of bread in butter a pale brown, sprinkle them with salt and pepper, place them in the bottom of a tureen.

Now add some stock (or milk and water), pepper, and salt; let it simmer a little time, and serve with fried sippets. Another wTay is to leave out the flour and sippets, and use either vermicelli or rice, and let it stew until thoroughly cooked. A third way is to use small onions. Peel them andWHOLESOME COOKERY. 26 scald them for a few minutes, stew them in some butter, and add good stock, and serve as above with fried sippets. 45.—Mulligatawny Soup.

Fry some chopped onion in butter, toss it up with some curry powder, add some stock or milk, pass it through a hair sieve, put it back on the fire with some 1 reviously boiled rice, boil up once, and serve.( 27 ; FISH. 47 _Scle “ a la Creme.” Roll up the fillets of sole nicely; stew them gen Jy in nice white stock; when done, take them out and drain them; then make a sauce with 1 ounce of flour, 1 ounce of butter, 1 gill of the stock the fish was stewed in, and 1 gill of cream. When cooked very smooth, serve over the soles. 48.—Broiled Sole. Sprinkle both sides of a sole with pepper, salt, and a little lemon-juice; rub it over with hot butter, sprinkle it over with fine bread-crumbs, and broil on both sides, either before the fire or in the oven. Pound an an- chovy with a little butter; add a small glass of di y white wine, some lemon-juice; simmer for a few minutes over the fire, and serve on the sole. 49.—Soles “a la Turban.” Cut a piece of bread the same shape as a cork, but very much larger; place it on a baking dish; round the bread place some slices of very thin fresh porkWHOLESOME COOKERY. 28 fat, then a cushion of savoury stuffing made of fish, herbs, bread-crumb, previously stewed together; on this place some well-shaped fillets of sole in the form of a turban; on the fillets place some mushrooms or truffles; pour over some hot butter, then pour over some lemon-juice; over this place a few slices of thin fresh pork fat; cover with a buttered paper, put in the oven, and bake. Have ready a thick tomato sauce, and when the soles are cooked, take away care- fully the slices of pork fat and the lump of bread, and into the space pour the tomato sauce. Serve in the same dish in which it is cooked. 50.—Soles “ a la Parisienne.” Place some fillets of sole in a stewpan; sprinkle over them some chopped parsley and onion, and pepper and salt; pour over some hot butter. Cook the soles on a tolerably hot fire, taking care that they do not burn or stick to the saucepan. Dish them up with an Italian sauce over them. 51.—Soles “a la Colbert.” When fried either whole or in fillets, place lumps of maitre d’hotel butter tastefully arranged on the fish. 52.—Baked Soles. Butter a baking dish; on this place some very thin slices of onion, then upon this a whole sole or29 FISK filleted soles; upon this pour a little white wine or cider • sprinkle with pepper, salt, and chopped parsley. Bake’them till cooked, and serve them in the same dish. 53,—Sole Normande, or Sole “au Gratin. Place on a flat dish several lumps of butter; sprinkle some very finely chopped parsley. Place on this a good-sized sole, then around some mushrooms and oysters; add some more parsley, salt and pepper to taste; then pour over a breakfast-cupful of slightly thickened gravy, in which you have previously mixed 1 wineglassful of sherry or white wine, 2 tablespoon- fuls of mushroom ketchup, 1 or 2 pounded anchovies. Bake half an hour to 40 minutes. Have some of the same gravy at hand to baste with and prevent it drying at the top. To make a sole “ au gratm” you proceed as above, but sprinkle raspings of bread under and above, and finish by placing some lumps of butter on the top. You also use unthiclcened gravy. N.B. Mussels are used in this dish, either as well as or in place of oysters. Another way.—Wipe the sole well; brush it over with egg; sprinkle it with finely chopped parsley, mixed with fine bread-crumbs and seasoned with pepper and salt. Now melt some buttei (4 ounces is sufficient for a 2 pound sole); pour it over the sole very gently, so as not to remove the bread-crumbs and30 WHOLESOME COOKERY. parsley. Bake for three-quarters of an hour. Have ready in saucepan about a quarter of a pint of good gravy, in which you have put in a little lemon- juice, 1 spoonful of ketchup, 1 wineglassful of sherry. Then remove the sole to another dish, and add the liquor from the fish to this sauce. Simmer it all together for a few minutes and pour it round the sole. It is a great improvement to this dish to add mush- rooms or oysters, or both, and mussels if liked. 54.—Soles “ a la Orly.” Sprinkle pepper and salt over the fillets, squeeze some lemon-juice over them, and leave them on one side. Put the bones and trimmings of the soles in a saucepan, with white wine, pepper, salt, and a few herbs; stew for half an hour, then strain. Flour the soles well, fry them dry, and serve with the sauce they were stewed in and strained. 55.—Whitings “ a la Orly.” Dress them exactly as the soles. 56.—Fillets of Whiting and Mushrooms. Take some large whitings and divide them into o o fillets; place them at the bottom of a stewpan, sprinkle them with pepper and salt, pour over somefish. 31 hot butter and lemon-juice. When half cooked, turn them over carefully and cook on the other side; then take them out, put them to drain. Then into the sauce put some slices of truffles or mushrooms, and stew them ; add a little butter if necessary. Dish up the fish with the mushrooms and fried sippets. JST.B.—Soles may be cooked in this way. 57.—Baked Whitings. Butter a dish; spread on this butter some finely chopped parsley, and a little onion, salt, and a little nutmeg; then place the whitings (boned whitings are preferable). Pour some hot butter over them, then equal quantities of white wine and stock. Put this dish in the oven, or on the top of your stove, with a cover over. When half cooked, turn the fish over carefully. When quite cooked, pour the sauce into a saucepan without disturbing the fish; add some butter and flour; simmer till thick, then add pepper and some lemon-juice. Pour the sauce back over the fish and serve in the dish the whitings are cooked in. 58.—Buttered Whitings. Sprinkle a little pepper and salt over the whitings, flour them thoroughly on both sides, place some butter on a gratin dish, lay the whitings upon it, and put them into a hot oven. Let them cook for some32 WHOLESOME COOKERY. minutes, then turn them carefully. Squeeze a little lemon-juice over them. The whitings must be a rich gold colour, and the butter brown, not black. Mackerels, herrings, soles, filleted haddocks, etc., can be cooked in this manner. 58a.—Broiled Whitings. Sprinkle them with pepper and salt, and pour over a little oil. Leave them for an hour or two, then broil them before the fire; turn them frequently; serve over them any sauce liked. 59.—Cod “ a la Creme.” I Boil a nice piece of cod, either fresh cod or very slightly salted, in boiling water. Drain it and cut into fillets. Blend 3 or 4 ounces of butter with flour, pepper, and nutmeg (salt, if the cod used is not salted); let it thicken over the fire, stirring all the time. Now add half a pint of cream and some very finely chopped parsley. Stir carefully for five minutes; then put in the fillets of cod and simmer gently for 10 minutes; then serve. 60.—Bouille a Baisse of Cod. Put in a saucepan some chopped leeks or onions; add some oil or butter; let it colour; then add a quart of water, a sprig or two of parsley, a bay leaf,33 FISK pepper, salt, and pinch of saffron, and some whole peeled potatoes. When the potatoes are nearly cooked, put in four slices of cod, and boil it till cooked. Dish the cod and potatoes up on one dish; strain the gravy on to some nice slices of French roll into another dish, and serve the contents of both dishes together. Slightly salted cod may be cooked as above. 61.—Bouille a Baisse. Take a variety of fishes, such as mullet, whiting, soles, haddock—a small lobster if shell-fish is liked ; cut them in pieces. Put in a wide and tolerably shallow saucepan a wine-glass of oil, 1 chopped onion, a bay leaf, a clove of garlic; toss all this together. Then place your pieces of fish in; add some salt to taste, a few slices of lemon, a few slices of tomato, a pinch of powdered saffron, a glass of white light wine ; add enough water to cover the fish; boil up quickly on a hot fire. The fish ought to be cooked in a quarter of an hour, and the gravy sufficiently reduced. Take the fish out, strain the sauce, put it back on the fire ; add a spoonful of finely chopped parsley, and a very little flour (not enough to make the sauce thick, but enough to prevent it being quite thin); place some slices of French roll in a deep dish; pour the sauce over. Place the fish in another dish, and serve the two dishes together. N.B.—-Of course the true bouille a baisse is made DWHOLESOME COOKERY. 34 from the fishes found in the Mediterranean, and those who want to eat it in perfection must go to Roubion’s, at Marseilles; but a very good attempt at bouille a baisse can be eaten in England if the above directions are followed. 62.—Middle Cut of Cod. Make a stuffing of bread-crumbs, parsley, onion chopped very fine, pepper, salt, and butter; moisten with an egg or milk, cook it slightly, and put it in the open part of cod; fix with skewers; rub the fish with a beaten-up egg; strew over bread-crumbs, pepper, and salt. Bake it, and serve, with or without oyster sauce. f 63.—Indian Way of Cooking Fish. Fillets of sole, mackerel, haddock, or mullet. Rub the fillet with curry paste and salt; fry it of a light brown; grate some cocoa-nut; pour a teacupful of boil- ing water over, mash it well together, and strain. Fry some sliced onion in the same butter the fish was fried in; put a little flour; add the cocoa-nut water, a little vinegar, salt and pepper. Stir till done and thick. Put in the fillets just to warm, not cook, and serve up. If cocoa-nut is not at hand, use prepared cocoa-nut. 1 tablespoonful of cocoa-nut and 2 ounces of butter is sufficient for 1 ordinary sized sole.FISH. 35 64.—Baked Fish. Split the fish in half; take off the head and middle hone; put it on a dish with a lump of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of water; then cover the fish about a quarter of an inch thick with a cooked stuffing made of bread-crumbs, shallots, pepper and salt, one or two yolks of eggs; sprinkle over some bread-crumbs; add . here and there some small lumps of butter. This recipe is good for sardines. A teaspoonful of rum added to the stuffing is by some considered an improvement. 65.—Skate “ an Benrre Noir.” When the skate is boiled, drain it Ufrdl and serve with brown butter. To boil the skate, lay it in a fish-kettle, with sufficient cold water to cover it, a bay leaf, sprig of thyme, sliced onion, carrot, sprig of parsley, and a tablespoonful of vinegar.

Place a layer of cauliflower on a baking-dish, then cover with sauce; then another layer of cauliflower and another layer of the sauce; sprinkle a little cheese over the whole, then a few bread-crumbs; pour a little hot butter over the top, and bake. N.B.—Unless the cauliflower is divided into layers it will not be good, as the sauce must cover every portion. It is also a great mistake to simply sprinkle cheese over the top; some must be mixed in the sauce too. Por those who do not like cheese, a cauliflower can be prepared in this manner with a plain melted butter, leaving out the cheese.G2 WHOLESOME COOKERY. 141.—Cauliflower Fritters. Boil some cauliflowers about two-thirds; divide them into pieces of equal size; dip each piece in a thick yellow or white sauce; put them on one side to get cold.

Cut it into nice pieces; egg and bread-crumb each piece, and broil them before the fire, or fry them in hot fat; serve them on a puree of vegetables, or with a piquante, tomato, or Italian sauce. 263.—Liver “a la Menagere.” Cut some liver into thin slices; toss them up in some butter, with pepper, salt, a bay leaf. Take out the liver and keep it hot. Put into the same butter some chopped onions; let them brown; sprinkle over with flour, and add some stock. Boil it up a couple of minutes; put back the liver, and simmer it until it is cooked; stir in some yolks of eggs and some lemon-juice, and serve all together.MEATS AND BIRDS. 107 284.—Liver “a l’ltalienne.” Cut some veal liver in tolerably thick slices. Put in a deep baking-dish or jar some oil, white wine, chopped parsley, chopped mushroom, chopped shallot, pepper, salt, and small pieces of bacon; lay some of the liver over this, then some of the oil, wine, and chopped herbs and bacon, and more liver; then a few slices of fat bacon on the top. Cook this in a slow oven. Take the liver out. Continue cooking the sauce some time longer; skim it and thicken it, and serve with the liver, or serve the liver with an Italian sauce. 265. —Stewed Sheep’s Kidneys. Skin the kidneys carefully; then cut them in halves or slices, as preferred. Melt 1 ounce of nice dripping or butter in a stewpan; add some chopped onion, chopped parsley. Stew for a few minutes, and stir all the time. Now add a little flour, some stock, gravy, or water, a wine-glassful of ketchup, the same quantity of wine, salt, and pepper. Stew very gently for an hour with the lid on. Serve with fried sippets. Liver or beef kidney prepared in this manner is good. 266. —Liver Stuffing, for Birds. Chop half a pound of fat liver, 2 shallots, 2 ounces of fat ham, with a little thyme, nutmeg, pepper, andWHOLESOME COOKERY. 108 salt; toss it in a little butter until nearly cooked. Pound it in a mortar, and stuff a pheasant with it. 267.—Provencale Stuffing, for Birds. Chop and parboil some large onions; drain them in a sieve; put them into a stewpan, with 4 ounces of butter, some bread-crumbs soaked in milk, chopped parsley, grated nutmeg, pepper and salt, and a few yolks of eggs; stir the whole over the fire until it forms a paste. Stuff your bird, and roast it. Serve with a tomato sauce. 268.—Fowl “ a la Marengo.” Cut up a fowl as for a fricassee; fry the pieces in oil, with pepper, salt, chopped mushrooms and herbs. When cooked, dress them on the dish with an Italian sauce round. Fry some eggs and sippets in the same oil the fowl was fried in, and serve round the fowl. N.B.—Those who object to oil can use fresh butter. Another way.—After the fowl is cut up as for a fricassee, put it in a stewpan, with 2 ounces of butter, a small quantity of gravy, chopped ham, sliced onion, pepper, and salt. Stew until nicely cooked. Add a squeeze of lemon-juice, and serve. 269.—Spanish Chicken. Cut a chicken into fillets and nice joints. Take a Spanish onion, cut it up very small; put it109 MEATS AND BIRDS. in a stewpan, with 2 ounces of butter and a little pepper and salt; let it stew gently for about an hour, or until it is a complete pulp. Put in the chicken and stew half an hour. Before dishing up add a squeeze of lemon-juice. 270.—Chicken “a la Champenoise. Take a slice of ham, more fat than lean; put it in a saucepan over the fire and nearly cook it. Take it out and chop it into small pieces; cut up also a carrot and a few mushrooms. Put them all together in the same saucepan, add some butter, and sprinkle over with flour; then add a little white wine and some good gravy. Stew this together, then skim it carefully. Now put in this some joints and fillets of roasted chicken, a few gherkins previously scalded, some chopped parsley, and some chopped anchovies (be sure to soak the anchovies in warm water first). Toss all this together without letting it boil, add some lemon-juice at the last, and serve. ✓ 271.—Fowl “ a la Verez.” Cut up a chicken as for a fricassee; fry it in butter, then add slices of Spanish onions and slices of tomato; continue cooking all together till done. Dish up with the onion and tomato in the centre. There must be more tomato than onion. Partridges and pheasants are good dressed in this manner.110 WHOLESOME COOKERY. 272. —Poule au Riz. Truss a fowLfor boiling. Put it in a saucepan, with half an onion chopped, 1 turnip and 1 carrot, also chopped, a bunch of herbs; cover it with milk or milk and water; add pepper and salt. Let it simmer till cooked. When it is about half cooked, take out some of the stock; put it in another saucepan, and simmer some rice in it. When both chicken and rice are cooked, strain the chicken sauce; then take as much as you think you will require for sauce, and thicken it with 1 or 2 yolks of eggs, and add a little cream. Use a very small quantity of this sauce to toss the rice in, and add a pinch of cheese to it, or if cheese is disliked, a little nutmeg. Now serve the chicken and sauce up, and hand the rice in a separate dish. In France the cooks usually cook chicken and rice together, and serve both in the same dish. It is less troublesome to cook, equally good, but makes a very untidy looking dish. 273. —Fried Chicken. Cut a roasted chicken into fillets and small joints; rub them with vinegar; sprinkle pepper, salt, and chopped herbs over them. Leave them for an hour; then wipe them, dip in frying batter, fry in boiling fat. Serve with fried parsley or any sauce liked. N.B.—Remains of cold boiled chickens can be usedIll MEATS AND BINDS. for this; if they have any remains of sauce over them they need not he rubbed with vinegar, etc. 274.—Duck Douillet.

Let it simmer gently until cooked, then skim and strain the sauce; thicken and serve. 275.—Stewed Duck and Olives. Eub the duck with lemon-juice; fry it in some butter or good dripping for a few minutes. Sprinkle some flour over; then add sufficient gravy or stock to cover it, 1 tablespoonful of ketchup, 1 carrot cut in four, 1 or 2 onions, 2 cloves, a bunch of parsley, a sprig of thyme, pepper and salt. Stew for an hour; then take out the duck, strain the gravy, and remove all the fat. Put the gravy back on the fire, and some stoned and scalded olives; boil for 5 to 10 minutes, and dish up with the duck. 276.—Salmis of Wild Duck. Wrap a wild duck in a buttered paper, and half roast it; then carve it into joints, and put it into a saucepan with the gravy which came from it in112 WHOLESOME COOKERY. roasting. In another saucepan put the trimmings of the duck, a tumbler of red wine, half a shallot, a clove, some pepper and salt; boil it down till there is only half the original quantity. Strain the sauce ; stir into it some flour and butter to thicken, a little glaze, a tablespoonful of oil, and the juice of one lemon. Add this to the duck. Toss up together to finish cooking the duck, and serve with fried sippets. N.B.—Of course, a salmis can be made with the remains of roast wild duck; but in that case only toss them in the sauce sufficiently long to warm them through. 277.—Stewed Duck and Turnips. Cut some turnips into pretty shaped balls; toss them up in butter, and sprinkle very lightly with sugar. Take them out; then fry your duck for a few minutes in the same butter. Then in another sauce- pan put a small lump of butter; thicken with a little flour; add some parsley, onion, bay-leaf, some good gravy, a little white wine. Put the duck in this, to stew very gently. When half cooked, add the turnips, and finish cooking together very sloivly. Skim the fat off carefully, and serve up hot. 278.—Goose or Turkey stuffed with Chestnuts. Pound the goose or turkey liver up with a very little finely chopped bacon, some herbs, salt, and nut-MEATS AND BIRDS. 113 meg.

Stuff the pigeons with the following: -bread-crumbs soaked in milk, the yolk of an egg, pepper, salt, chopped parsley, shallot, and mushroom. Put the pigeons in a stewpan, with a lump of butter or drip- ping, a slice of bacon; fry them for a few minutes, then add some gravy or good stock and a little wine • cover them up and stew very gently till done. Strain the gravy, and serve. 280. Pigeons and Prawns “en Ragout de Crevettes.” When your pigeons are prepared, cut them in half; put them in a stewpan, with a glass of light white' wine, a glass of stock, parsley, shallot, pepper, salt, and a couple of cloves; simmer them till done. Strain the gravy. Now in another saucepan put a lump of butter, some button mushrooms, and some skinned prawns; add a little flour, and the gravy the pigeons were stewed in.

Prepare a ragout a la financffire, and serve the capon upon it. 284.—Eoast Bird. Poultry or game is improved if stuffed with a stuffing made of a little bread soaked in milk, 1 ounce of butter, pepper, salt, and mushrooms. Cook the stuffing for a few minutes before putting it in the bird. Koast the bird with a toast under; baste it frequently, and serve it on the toast. 285. —Partridges “ a la Parisienne.” Toss the partridges in butter on a slow fire; before they begin to brown add a lump of glaze, some good stock, a glass of white wine. Sprinkle with a little floui, pepper, and salt. Simmer for three-quarters of an hour, by which time the partridges ought to be cooked. Continue simmering the sauce some time longer; stir in at the last a lump of butter, pass tkrough°a sieve, and serve over the partridges. 286. —Partridges “ a l’Estouffade.” Lard the partridges; put them in a saucepan, with some onion, carrots, a couple of slices of larding pork, a bunch of herbs, stock and white wine, pepper and116 WHOLESOME CO OREL Y. salt; cover the saucepan very tightly, and simmer very gently until the birds are cooked. Cook the sauce a little longer; skim it very carefully, pass through a sieve, and serve over the partridges. This dish is good if done in a slow oven in a covered jar. 287.—Partridges “a la Portugaise.” Cut your partridges into joints; fry them in oil, with a clove of garlic and a Spanish onion; to this add a small quantity of very thick tomato sauce. Simmer the whole together, and serve with fried sippets and, if liked, a few stoned olives. 288.—Salmis of Partridges. Blend some flour and butter together in a saucepan —do not let it become brown—add some stock or gravy, an equal quantity of red wine, 1 shallot, bunch of herbs, pepper, and salt; simmer this for half an hour; strain it. Have your cooked partridges cut into joints and fillets; simmer them in this sauce without allow- ing them to boil; add juice of lemon. Dish up the partridges on fried sippets with the sauce over. N.B.—All game is good dressed in this manner. C . . 289.—Pheasant “ en Souffle.” Remove the skin and bones from a roasted pheasant; pound the meat (and livers, if the bird was-117 MEATS AND BIRDS. not a high, one) in a mortal’. Put the pounded meat in a saucepan with some rich stock or gravy; let it become quite hot, but do not let it boil; then pass it through a hair sieve. Break the pheasant bones up small, and stew them down in a small quantity of gravy. Strain the gravy, add a thickening of flour and butter, stir in a small lump of glaze. Continue sim- mering the sauce till it is nearly thick, then stir in a lump of butter, some grated nutmeg, then the pheasant puree; now beat in 4 yolks of eggs; lastly, beat in (adding small quantities at a time) 2 whites of eggs stiffly whisked. Pour the mixture in a souffle case or cake tin, bake in the oven until it rises: will take about 20 minutes. Must be eaten at once ; if it waits at all, it is spoilt. Remains of chickens or partridges make excellent souffles. 290.—Roast Quails. Wrap each quail in a vine leaf, wrap it again in a very thin layer of fat bacon; roast them before the fire. They ought not to take more than 20 minutes. 291.—Roast Hare. When the hare is prepared for roasting, lard it with a fine needle. Boil a little vinegar with a little water, sliced onion, thyme, bay leaf, parsley, pepper, salt, and some butter. When it is cold, pour it over the hare and113 WHOLESOME COOKERY. leave it for 24 hours; then wipe the hare and roast it before the fire. Baste it well with the liquor it has been soaking in. Serve with its gravy thickened. N.B.—The above recipe is for a tolerably fresh- killed hare. N.B.—Some people treat the hind part of a hare in this manner, and reserve the front part for a “ civet.” 292.—“ Civet v of Hare. Cut the hare into pieces; toss it in a few ounces of butter, with some small pieces of slightly salted bacon ; when a little coloured, add 2 tablespoonfuls of flour and a couple of tumblers of light red wine. Add pepper, spices, bunch of herbs, bay leaf, a clove, and an onion. Let this simmer very slowly by the side of the fire for 5 hours (can be done in a jar in the oven). Have some small onions; toss them in butter till slightly brown, moisten with stock, add a pinch of sugar, and cook them slowly. When the hare is nearly cooked, take out the herbs and onion, and add a few mushrooms; then, if it wants salt, add some. Finish cooking. Dish up the hare with the sauce, and serve round the small onions, the mushrooms, and some fried sippets. 293.—Broiled Rabbit. Cut the rabbit into joints; wrap each joint in a buttered paper, and broil it in a Dutch oven before119 MEATS AND BIRDS. the fire. When cooked, take the papers off, and dish up the rabbit with maitre d’hotel or anchovy butter, spread on each joint. 294.—Rabbits “ Sautes.” Cut the rabbit up into neat fillets and joints. Cut some small pieces of raw ham; toss these together in butter over a hot fire, with some chopped onion (clove of garlic), parsley, and thyme; then sprinkle them over with flour. Add some stock, a little white wine. Simmer together till the rabbit is cooked. Strain the sauce; put it back on the fire; add some chopped mushrooms; cook a few minutes longer, and serve over the rabbit. 295.—Rabbits “en Papillote.” Chop up some parsley, mushrooms, shallot, clove of garlic, a little bacon, with pepper and salt. Mix this in a little gravy on the fire to form a paste. Cut a rabbit into neat fillets and joints.

Serve hot. 300.—Savoury Rice Mould. Clean and wash 6 ounces of rice. Put it in a stew- pan with cold water; boil it 1 minute, then take it121 MEATS AND BIRDS. out and strain off the water. Add stock or milk, and stew gently until the rice will break easily with a spoon. Work it tip with a spoonful of white sauce 2 tablespoonfuls of grated cheese, pepper, salt, and a beaten egg. The l'ice must be firm and well blended. Line a mould (which has an inner space) and bake it. Turn out the rice, and fill the inner vacant space with a savoury mince dressed with white sauce; decorate with slices of hard-boiled egg, and serve. Remains of cold fish warmed in any sauce is a good substitute for the mince. The stock or milk the rice was cooked in to be used for soups, or for boiling white meats in first, and then finished as soup. 301.—Oyster Kromeskys. Cut some uncooked fat bacon into very thin slices; place one or two oysters on each; sprinkle with pepper, salt, and lemon-juice. Cook in a Dutch oven before the fire, and serve on toast. 302.—Aspic or Meat Jelly. Boil a calfs foot in 2 quarts of a well-flavoured, dear pot au feu soup; strain it and let it become cold; when set, clear off the fat. Now slightly warm the greater part of it again, and pour a little in a mould. When it is set, lay some pieces of hard-boiled eSo> cut gherkins, little pieces of nicely dressed chicken.WHOLESOME COOKERY. 122 or sweetbreads. Place on this a little of the cold aspic so as to keep all the pieces in their places. Now pour on this some of the slightly warmed aspic; let it set, then place some more chicken, egg, gherkin, cold aspic, etc., and continue until the mould is full. Place it in a cold place, and turn out when quite set. In placing the garnish inside the mould, be careful that no pieces touch the side of the mould, or the jelly will break at that point when turned out. N.B.—A simpler way is to pour the meat jelly into a border mould, and when set and turned out, fill the vacant space with a mayonnaise of fish, meat, or vegetables. 303.—Ragout a la Financiere. Cut a slice of raw ham in very small pieces; put it in a stewpan, with a bunch of herbs, a mushroom, glass of white wine, glass of stock, and some pepper. Boil this together till it is reduced to half its ori- ginal quantity; pass through a sieve. In another saucepan blend some flour and butter; add a little stock; cook it till reduced to half its original quantity. Now add the two sauces together ; then warm in this sauce some foie gras, cooked cocks’ combs, truffles, mushi'ooms, and fonds d’artichauds. Serve alone, or as a garnish to fricasseed fowls, wild pheasants, etc. The “ financiere a la gelde,” which is preserved in bottles, can be used in this sauce, if cocks’ combs, truffles, etc., are not to be had easily; or the123 MEATS AND BINDS. bottles of cocks’-combs and a tin of mushrooms, to- gether with little pieces of chicken, make a good “ financi&re.” Bottled truffles are not worth buying; they are expensive, and have little or no flavour. 304.—Rissoles. Mince up any remains of cold meat; stew them up in thickened gravy, with a few herbs, pepper, and salt (onion if liked). Let it stand till cold. Then make it up into small balls—touch them as little as possible, and with the palms of the hands instead of the fingers—then cover them with fine bread-crumbs. Beat a yolk of egg up well; dip in the balls, and cover them again with fine bread-crumbs. Fry a pale yellow, and serve with fried parsley or gravy. i 305.—Westphalian Rissoles.

Serve with gravy. 306.—Pastry Rissoles. Make a light paste; roll it out thin, cut it into squares. On each square place a small piece of savoury mince; roll up each square, and fry in boiling fat. Dish up on a napkin.124 WHOLESOME COOKERY. 307.—Fried Oysters. Scald and beard the oysters; dip each separately in batter; drop them into boiling fat and fry crisp; drain them, and dish them np with fried parsley. They must be quite dry and crisp. 308.—Kromeskys. Mince some cold meats of any sort, and mushrooms, if you have them. Fry some onion slightly in butter, then toss in the mince for a couple of minutes; next moisten with gravy or stock; season with pepper and salt and minced parsley. Stew for a few minutes until it is in a tolerable paste; put it on one side to get cool. Cut up some slices of cooked bacon (rather fat)—the slices must be of the thinnest—place some of the savoury meat on each slice, roll them up neatly, and keep them in a cool place; then dip them in batter and fry them.( 125 ) SWEETS. 309.—Cabinet Pudding. Spread the inside of a mould with butter; orna- ment the bottom and sides with pieces of preserved fruits. Fill the mould with alternate slices of sponge cake, ratafias, and maccaroons, and some more pieces of dried fruits, or small lumps of guava jelly or apri- cot marmalade. Make a custard with 7 eggs, 1 pint of milk, 6 ounces of sugar, and a little vanilla or grated lemon-peel; add 1 wine-glassful of brandy. Let it get cold, and pour it by degrees into the mould so as to penetrate every corner; then cover the mould and steam it an hour. Serve cold with custard over it, into which mix another wine-glassful of brand}". 310.—Winter Pudding. 1 pint of very fine bread-crumbs, 1 quart of milk, 1 teacupful of sugar, 4 yolks of eggs well beaten, grated rind of 1 lemon, a lump of butter about the size of an egg.

Now turn out the pudding; spread over it a layer of jam or jelly, pour over the whisked whites, and hake slightly. Serve cold with cream. 311.—Swiss Apples. Peel and cut the apples in quarters; fry them in butter a pale gold colour; put them to drain (on a piece of blotting-paper is best). Heap them up on a dish, and keep them warm. Now put in a saucepan 1 pint of claret, a little cinnamon; sweeten with about half a pound of brown sugar; add the grated rind of 1 lemon and the juice of half a lemon. Make the sauce quite hot, but do not let it boil. Pour it over the apples. 312.—Banana Fritters. Cut some bananas in half; sprinkle them with castor sugar; put them to soak in a little rum. Have some frying batter; dip each piece in; fry in boiling fat, and serve rap on a napkin. N.B.—Slices of apple, orange, pineapple, etc., are good if cooked in this manner. 313.—Pain Perdu. Cut some bread into round slices of a medium thickness. Boil some milk with sugar, and vanilla,127 SWEETS. and a pinch of salt. Dip each piece of bread in the milk; then dip them into a well-beaten yolk of egg. Now fry each piece in butter, and serve hot with ■castor sugar over them. 314.—Torrijas (Spanish). Cut some bread in round slices of a medium thick- ness. Beat the yolk of an egg in milk; sweeten it. Dip each piece of bread in the milk, then in some liqueur, such as curac;oa or maraschino, etc. Let the pieces drain; then fry them, sprinkle some grated nutmeg and sugar over them, and serve hot. 315.—Maraschino Toast. Cut some bread in slices about the size of a slice of lemon; fry them a nice gold colour. Melt some jam (either cherry, or apricot, or plum) with a small quantity of water and maraschino. Simmer it for a few minutes, and pour it over your fried bread. Serve hot. 316.—Puffs. 1 tablespoonful of flour, 1 egg, half a pint of milk, a little grated lemon-peel. Mix the flour and milk to a smooth batter; add the egg, well beaten, and the grated lemon-peel; half fill some buttered cups or small moulds; bake half an hour; turn out, and serve with sifted sugar over them.128 WHOLESOME COOKERY. 317.—Stewed Pears. Peel the pears and put them in a stewpan, with a little ivater, lemon-peel, and sugar (to every pound of pears a quarter of a pound of sugar); if liked coloured, a few drops of cochineal. Simmer very gently till the pears are cooked. Take them out and continue sim- mering the syrup until it is thick. 318.—Fig Mould. Half a pound of di’ied figs, a small piece of lemon- peel, 2 ounces of white sugar. Cover them with half a pint of claret, or claret and water, or water alone; simmer them gently till quite soft and the liquor absorbed. Press it into a mould; when cold, turn out and serve with whipped cream or custard. When the figs are stewed, they ought to form a thick paste. If they should be at all lumpy, pass them through a wire sieve. 319.—Prune Mould. Made exactly like the fig mould. Of course, take out the stones after the prunes are cooked. Crack a few of the stones, and put some of the kernels in the mould with the prunes.SWEETS. 129 320.—Plum-Pudding. 1 pound of suet, 1 pound of bread-crumbs, 1 pound of raisins, 1 pound of currants, 1 pound of moist sugar, quarter of a pound of candied lemon-peel, 1 finely chopped apple, 8 well-beaten eggs, 1 grated nutmeg, 1 teaspoonful powdered cinnamon, 2 wine-glasses of port or sherry or brandy, 2 tablespoonfuls of flour. Mix well, and boil 5 hours, either in a covered tin ox- tied up in a cloth. N.B.—It is wise to mix all the above ingredients thoroughly well for 3 days befoi’e adding the eggs; then add the eggs and cook the pudding. Mixed in this mannei', the suet gets quite absorbed. 321.—Plain Plum-Pudding. 4 ounces of cun-ants, 4 ounces of suet, 4 ounces of flour, 4 ounces of raisins, half a pint of milk, 4 ounces of fine bread-crumbs, 2 tablespoonfuls of treacle.

When nearly cold, stir in a glass of brandy or cura5oa. Serve cold, with a custard round. You might save some of the above custard without gelatine for serving round it. 326.—Caramel Custard. To prepare the caramel, put 5 ounces of loaf sugar, with 2 tablespoonfuls of water, in a warm mould. Melt it over the fire until the sugar and water form a golden-coloured thick syrup; take it off the fire, and turn your mould round and round until the caramel has gradually worked itself over the whole inside of the mould and forms a casing. Dip the outside of the mould in cold water: this has the effect of makinw O the sugar set. Now mix 1 pint of boiling milk to 6 well-beaten eggs, add sugar and vanilla to taste ; then, pour it cold into the mould, and steam it for 2(? minutes.

Serve hot, or cold with a custard round. 359.—Plain Cold Eice Pudding. 1 ounce of Carolina rice, 1 tablespoonful of sugar, a very small lump of butter, 1 pint of milk. Place all in a deep pie-dish and bake till quite set. Must be done very slowly. Serve cold. When the spoon is put in the dish it ought to come out with a cream upon it; if it does not, the pudding has not succeeded. 360.—Caramel Semolina Mould. Prepared exactly like the Caramel rice (358). 361.—Plain Souffle. 3 yolks of eggs well beaten; 3 whites of eggs, also well beaten; 2 ounces of potato flour (Groult’s), 1 ounce of butter, 1£ ounce of castor sugar and a little finely143 SWEETS. chopped lemon-peel, quarter of a pint of milk.

Put it back on the fire and let it boil a few minutes, stirring all the time. It must be now quite a stiff paste, very nearly like a lump of dough. Put this lump in a large bason. When cool—not cold—put in 1 (unbeaten) egg; mix it well with the paste; then add the second egg, and then the third. It takes about 4 minutes to mix in thoroughly each egg. Let this paste stand two or three hours before using it. Now put in a deep stewpan some fat, clarified lard, or dripping; when it boils completely, dip a teaspoon in it, and then take half a teaspoonful of the batter and drop it into the fat. Continue until you have used up all the batter. Each fritter will be cooked when it is a rich gold colour and swollen to the size of an apricot. The reason you dip the teaspoon in the boiling fat is to cause the batter to slip easily off the spoon. Serve the fritters on a d’oyley with castor sugar sprinkled over. 366.—Canadian Pudding. Make a custard with half a pint of milk, 4 yolks of eggs, and a little sugar. Boil 2 tablespoonfuls of corn flour in 1-|- pint of milk with a little sugar ; let it get cool.

Boil for about 3 hours; in fact, till the apples are boiled to a pulp. Put it in pots or moulds for use. Very good served as a sweet, with custard or whipped cream over. Half a teaspoonful of cinnamon to 5 pounds of fruit is sufficient. 380. —Orange Salad. Peel the oranges, and remove the outside white skin; cut them into slices; remove the pips. Place them in layers on the dish they are to be served in; between each layer sprinkle some castor sugar and pour over a little rum or brandy. 381.—Stewed Prunes.

The following recipes have been made in one of Wolffs American freezing machines, which is a very- simple one, and easily used. I believe there are many others equally good, but I have not tried them. Ices can be simply made. For instance, an ordinary gooseberry fool iced is good; the remains of some stewed fruit, rubbed through a hair sieve and added to custard or cream, make a good and simple ice. To clarify Sugar for Fruit Water Ices. Melt 4 pounds of sugar in 4 pints of water over the fire; when it boils, beat in the white of one egg well whisked. Let it boil about 10 minutes. Strain it and bottle it. 385.—Orange or Lemon Water Ice. Squeeze the juice from a sufficient number of oranges or lemons to make one quart. Melt 1 tea- cupful of sugar in 1 teacupful of boiling water; stir this into the fruit juice. When it is cold, put it in a mould and freeze it. N.B.—The above quantity of sugar does not make a very sweet ice; if very sweet ices are liked, the quantity can be increased. 386.—Coffee Cream Ice. 6 or 8 yolks of eggs, 1 breakfast-cupful of strong coffee, 1 pint of milk, 8 ounces of sugar.

Make exactly like the coffee ice, but leave out the coffee; use an extra half-pint of milk and some .essence of vanilla. 389. —Fruit Cream Ice. Pound any fruit liked with sifted sugar; rub it through a sieve; add cream. Put it in a mould and freeze. 390. —Parfait au Cafe. Boil 1 pint of milk; take it oft’ the fire, and stir in 1 pint of strong coffee. Now put in a saucepan 8 yolks of eggs and 10 ounces of sugar. Stir the milk in. Place the saucepan on the fire, and whisk the mixture until it is just on the boil; then take it off the fire, let it become cold, and strain it. Put it in a mould and freeze it. When half frozen, stir in a wine-glassful of curagoa or rum; finish freezing it. Serve immediately on a d’oyley.151 WHOLESOME COOKERY. 391.—Iced Souffle. Mix in a saucepan G yolks of eggs, with 4 ounces of clarified sugar. Whisk this over the fire until it nearly boils; take it off the fire at once. Continue whisking till the mixture is nearly cold. Add to it 1 quart of whisked double cream and a glass of rum or cura5oa. Have your souffle lining standing on ice, so as to get it thoroughly cold; this is important. Fix a band of paper about 2 inches above the dish; pour in the mixture, almost as high as the paper; cover the mould completely, and embed it in ice and salt. 2 hours’ freezing is about the time it will take. Then take off the paper, strew biscuit powder lightly on the top, and serve. Souffles can be flavoured with the juice of fruit, or coffee, or chocolate, or vanilla, etc.( 155 ) SAVOURY DISHES. 392.—Ham Toast.

Cut some slices of bread; toast and butter them on both sides; spread the above mixture on half an inch thick, and bake about 4 minutes. It should rise, and must be eaten at once.159 SAVOURY DISHES. 402.—Cheese Pudding. Warm 1 ounce of butter in a quarter of a pint oi milk; mix it with 3 ounces of grated Parmesan cheese and 5 ounces of bread-crumbs; add 2 well-beaten eggs J oo and salt to taste. Bake half an hour, and serve at once. 403.—Cheese Straws. 3 ounces of flour, 2 ounces of butter, 2 ounces of grated cheese, a pinch of salt and cayenne pepper. Rub the butter into the flour, then the cheese, pepper, and salt; mix all thoroughly well. Add 1 yolk of egg; roll the mixture, cut it into lengths, and bake in a cool oven. 404. —Stewed Cheese. Grate 2 ounces of cheese; mix it with 1 tea- cupful of cream; add 1 beaten egg; stew it in a small saucepan with 1 ounce of butter (melt the butter before putting in the cheese). Serve when all thoroughly mixed. 405. —Toasted Cheese. Cut some Cheddar cheese in flakes; put it in the oven, and when quite dissolved, stir it up with pepper and English mustard. Another way. Mix the cheese in a saucepan, with a little milk or beer and a little mustard. When it is a smooth paste, serve it up on buttered toast.160 WHOLESOME COOKERY. 406.—Cheese Souffle. 3 tablespoonfuls of flour, half a pint of millc, 2 ounces of butter. Stir all this well over the fire ; when quite mixed and smooth, add 6 ounces of grated cheese. Let it cool; then add the beaten yolks of 4 eggs; at the very last add 4 whites of eggs well whisked. Flavour with pepper and salt; bake half an hour, and serve at once. 407. —Hot Sandwiches. Bone, skin, and pound some sardines with a little anchovy paste and butter and lemon-juice. Have some thin slices of bread and butter, and lay the paste between two slices to form a sandwich; then fry each sandwich, and serve them up hot. 408. —Savoury Oysters. Beard them; sprinkle them with’pepper, salt, and lemon-juice; wrap each oyster in a very thin slice of fat bacon; skewer them and cook them before the fire. Serve on toast or fried sippets. 409.—Cold Anchovy Toast. Cut some slices of bread into equal sizes and fry them in oil; place them on a dish; lay some fillets of anchovy or sardine on each piece. Now add to the oil you fried the bread in, some minced shallot, parsley.SAVOURY DISHES. 161 thyme, a bay leaf, pepper, and a little vinegar. Boil this together; strain it; pour over the toasts, and serve them when they ai’e cold. 410.—Sardine Toast. Pound a few boned and skinned sardines (say 4) with 1 teaspoonful of gravy, 1 ounce of butter, and pepper. Make it hot, and serve on fried sippets or buttered toast. 411.—Anchovy Toast. Butter some toast; spread a little anchovy paste over. Now put the well-beaten yolks of 2 eggs in a saucepan, with a quarter of a pint of cream; set it to thicken over the fire, but not to boil. Season with cayenne; pour it over the toast (which ought to have been kept hot), and serve. N.B.—A pinch of grated cheese added to the sauce is considered by some an improvement. Of course, it must be cooked with the sauce. Another way.—3 ounces of butter, 1 teaspoonful of anchovy paste, a little pepper, half a pint of cream. Simmer till thick with 1 teaspoonful of flour. Pom' it over some buttered toast, and serve very hot. This quantity makes enough for ten persons. Milk can be used in place of cream, but the toast is, of course, not so good. MWHOLESOME COOKERY. 162 BREAD, ETC. 412.—Bread. Flour, 4 pounds; German yeast, 1 ounce; about a quarter of an ounce of salt; water, 1 pint. Put the flour and salt into a good-sized earthen pan; cover with a cloth, and put before the fire to get warm. Then make a hole in the middle large enough to hold a pint of water. Mix the yeast in the water, which must be warm, not hot; rub it down till the yeast and water are thoroughly mixed—no lumps—then pour it into the hole in the flour, and sprinkle some of the flour over the hole so as to make it perfectly invisible. Cover with the cloth, and set by the fire again. Let it stand there till the flour over the hole cracks in more than one place; then work it up into a light dough. Be very particular to use only the tips of the fingers. Knead it well till you see little air bubbles; then set it by the fire again for a little while, till it feels very light to the touch. You may now tear pieces off (do not cut with a knife). Make into what shape or size you wish. Put it on a floured tin in the oven—not too hot a one. Bake till the loaves rise, crack, and are a good colour. When taken out of the oven, throw a cloth over to keep them in. If required lighter, try 3 pounds of flour instead of 4 pounds.163 BREAD, ETG. 413.—Home-made Bread quickly made. Mix very thoroughly one heaped-up teaspoonful of ^ eatman s yeast powder with 1 pound of Hungarian flour and a little salt; pour on half a pint of cold milk or water; make it into a loaf, or put it in a tin, and immediately into a hot oven. Bake. When the biead has risen, open the oven door for a minute to let out the steam. This dough does not require much kneading. 414.—Home-made Rolls quickly made. 1 quart of flour, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 2 teaspoon- fuls of Yeatman’s yeast powder, 1 tablespoonful of butter, and about 1 pint of milk, not more. Mix the flour, salt, and powder thoroughly together; rub in the butter, add the milk; work it into a firm dough. Flour the board; knead the dough on it two or three times very quickly. Divide it into nicely shaped lound pieces; lay them on a greased baking-tin, wash them over with milk, and bake in a hot oven. Will take about 15 minutes. Must be baked as soon as made. 415.—Vienna Bolls. Mix 1 ounce of dry German yeast with 1 ounce of pounded sugar and 2 ounces of butter; then stir into it 1 pint of warm milk. Have 2 pounds ofWHOLESOME COOKERY. 164 flour mixed with 2 eggs and some salt. Stir the milk and yeast gradually into the flour; mix it all up very thoroughly. Let it stand in a warm place for three , hours; then divide it into small shapes. Flour some tins; place the rolls upon them, and let them stand for about 20 minutes in a warm place. Bake in a quick oven for about 15 minutes; rub them over with a little sugar and water, and finish baking a few minutes longer. 416.—Spice Cake. 1 teacupful of butter, 1 teacupful of brown sugar, 1 pint of flour, 2 teaspoonfuls of baking powder, 1 tea- spoonful of carraway essence, 1 of nutmeg essence, 1 of cinnamon essence, 1 of ginger essence, and 1 teacupful of milk. Mix the flour, sugar, and powder; rub it in the butter; add the milk and essences. Mix it to a batter; fill a greased tin or small patty pans, and bake in a hot oven. Will take about 10 minutes. Another way.—1 teacupful of milk, 1 teacupful of butter, 3 teacupfuls of flour, 1 teaspoonful of baking powder, 2 eggs, half a teacupful of stoned raisins and half a teacupful of currants, 1 teaspoonful of nutmeg essence, 1 of clove essence, and 1 of cinnamon essence. Rub the butter and sugar to a cream; add the eggs, first one, then the other; beat between each. Mix the flour and powder together, and then add it to the other things, with the fruit, essences, and milk; beat165 BREAD, ETC. it to a smooth batter. Line a tin with a greased paper, and bake about half an hour. 417.—Short Cakes. 1J pint of flour, small teaspoonful of salt, 4 table- spoonfuls of sugar, 4 tablespoonfuls of butter, 1 tea- spoonful of baking powder, 3 eggs, 1 teacupful of milk, 1 teaspoonful of essence of orange. Mix the flour, sugar, salt, and powder; rub in the butter cold; add the beaten eggs and nearly all the milk, then the essence. Mix it all quickly into a smooth dough with the fingers, not the hands. Flour the board; put the dough on it, roll it out a quarter of an inch thick. Cut it into squares; lay them on a baking-tin; wash them over with the rest of the milk; lay some sliced candied peels on the top. Bake in a moderate oven. Will take about 20 minutes. 418. —Potato Cakes. Mash 2 pounds of cooked potatoes, with half a pound of flour, salt to taste, and sufficient milk to bind. Roll it out; cut it into small rounds, and bake on a hot iron plate or in the oven. 419. —Rock Cakes. Half a pound of flour, 2 ounces of butter, 2 ounces of currants, 1 tablespoonful of sugar, half a table- spoonful of baking powder. Mix the powder and flour166 WHOLESOME COOKERY. first; add the sugar and currants, then rub in the butter; next, enough milk to make it stiff (about 1 teacupful of milk will be sufficient). Bake in nicely shaped pieces. They must not look smooth. N.B.—Rock cakes can also be made, and are very good, with 1 pound of flour, quarter of a pound of dripping, 1 egg, 2 tablespoonfuls of baking powder, 2 ounces of currants, 2 ounces of sultanas, and 2 table- spoonfuls of sugar. 420.—Scones, 1 pound of flour, quarter of a pound of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of sifted sugar, 1 tablespoonful of baking powder. Mix with milk (sour if possible). Roll out into squares and bake. 421.—Dundee Cake. 8 eggs, 2 teacupfuls of butter, 1J teacupful of sugar, 1J pint of Hungarian flour, a cupful of currants, 1£ cupful of sultana raisins, a little grated nutmeg, a little essence of vanilla, 1 cupful of pounded Jordan almonds, and a little candied peel cut in thin slices. Rub the sugar and butter together to a white cream; add the eggs two at a time—beat 3 or 4 minutes between each. Have all the other ingredients well mixed together, and then add them to the sugar, butter, and eggs. Mix all firmly together. Have a shallow tin lined with a greased paper; pour in the mixture and bake in a moderate oven. Will take about 1| hour.167 BREAD, ETC. 422.—Directions for Oyster Patties Paste. Strain the juice of 1 lemon in 1 gill of water (cold). Beat 1 egg to a stiff froth, and mix with above. Put three-quarters of a pound of dried flour into a bowl, and stir in the above liquid; knead it to a smooth paste. Lay it on a slab, and spread over it three-quarters of a pound of fresh butter. Turn over the four sides ; dredge with flour and roll it out four times ; then fold it in three and let it stand in a cool place for 2 hours. Have ready two round paste-cutters, one 2 b inches across, the other 1-J inch. Roll out the paste a third of an inch thick and make your patties. The stewed oysters must be put in after the patties have been baked. 423.—Directions and Proportions for Pastry. 12 ounces of flour, 4J ounces lard, 4J ounces of butter, 1 teacupful of water, and a little salt. Mix the lard and flour together; rub it with the fingers (not the hands') as lightly as possible and as quickly as you can; add the water, and work it lightly into a paste. Roll the paste out, and spread upon it one-third of the butter; roll it again and spread again one-third of butter; do this again, when all the butter will be used. Double it over and put it in a bowl, and let it stand for 2 hours before cutting for use. _ The more you roll it the heavier the paste will become; so take care.163 WHOLESOME COOKERY. SUNDRIES. 424.—Quince Jam or Cheese. Slice the quinces (after they are peeled and cored). Put them in a stewpan, with sufficient water for them to float; stir carefully from the bottom; stew till reduced to a pulp, then weigh the pulp. Add three- quarters of a pound of sugar to each pound of pulp, and stew till set. Put in pots and cover tightly. N.B.—3 or 4 apples to every 12 quinces is by some considered an improvement. Some boil the quince seeds and peel in the water, then strain it and use it with the quinces instead of plain water. If put in moulds, the quince can be turned out, and served as a sweet with custard or cream poured round it. 425.—Pickled Lemons. Wipe 6 lemons; cut each lemon into 8 pieces; put on them a pound of salt, 6 cloves of garlic, 2 ounces of horse-radish thinly sliced, 2 ounces of cloves, 2 ounces of mace, 2 ounces of mustard, quarter of an ounce of grated nutmeg, quarter of an ounce of cayenne, 2169 SUNDRIES. quarts of vinegar. Put all this in a large jar; place the jar at the side of the fire, or in a saucepan of boiling water, and let it simmer till you think the lemons are cooked; then take it off. When cold, cover it with a lid which fits. Stir every day for 6 weeks. Put it into small bottles; cover them tightly, and keep for use. 426.—To make Coffee (French Fashion). For"each small coffee-cupful of water allow half an ounce of coffee. Put the coffee in the upper part of the coffee-pot (the ordinary French cafetiere, which is made in tin and in china); pour the boiling water over, and let it stand till the water has run through. Must be as clear as wine. Be sure to lift off that part of the coffee-pot which holds the grains before you move the coffee-pot, or you may get a little coffee grounds shaken into the coffee. There is no excuse for not always having good coffee, provided two things are remembered: 1st. That the coffee provided must be coffee and not chicory. 2nd. That the cook must measure the water and weigh the coffee on each occasion: if she once attempts to guess at her quan- tities, bad coffee will be the result. It is better always to roast and grind the coffee at home, which is easily done. Put the beans on a baking tin in the oven, each bean separately; leave them about 10 minutes, or until they are a rich brown. I alwaysWHOLESOME COOKERY. 170 roast each day the coffee which is required for that day. If there is any coffee not used, it ought not to he thrown away. The coffee will keep if put in a bottle at once and tightly corlced. It can then be used for a coffee custard or cream. 427.—To make Coffee (Turkish Fashion). Grind the coffee very fine. Take the same propor- tions you would for French-made coffee (perhaps rather more water to allow of boiling away). Put the water into a saucepan, with a lump of sugar; when boiling hard, throw in the coffee; let it come to a boil. Lift it off the fire as soon as it bubbles, then put it on the fire again; lift it off* as soon as it bubbles; do this a third time. Now throw in a spoonful of cold filtered water to settle the grounds; leave it quiet one minute, and pour carefully into cups. Will have a thick yellow froth at the top. Serve without milk. The coffee, as usual, to be freshly roasted, and on this occasion finely ground. 428.—To make Chocolate. Cut up 1 tablet of chocolate in very small pieces', blend it in a little hot water or hot milk; then add enough hot water or hot milk to make up a breakfast cup. Boil 2 or 3 minutes, stirring all the time. N.B.—Some people find chocolate made with milkSUNDRIES. 171 alone does not agree with them. In those cases use water, and add a little cold milk when you drink it. I find the best chocolate for this purpose is that of the Compagnie Coloniale, without vanilla. 429.—Meat Tea. Take 1 pound of lean beef, mutton, or chicken. Cut it into very small pieces; put it in ajar with 1 pint of cold water; put the jar in a saucepan of cold water, and let it gradually become warm, and let it simmer for 3 or 4 hours. It must not boil. Pass it through a hair sieve; flavour with salt, and, if liked, pepper. This meat tea can be taken plain, or thick- ened with sago, arrowroot, or bread-crumbs; or a little cream can be stirred in, or a couple of yolks of eggs, if the patient is allowed eggs. 430.—Barley Cream. 1 pound of veal. Skin it, and remove all fat; cut it in pieces, and put it in 1 quart of cold water and 1 ounce of barley. Simmer it slowly till it is reduced to 1 pint. Strain the liquor through a sieve, and then rub the meat and barley through a sieve. Add the liquor to it; it ought to be of the consistency of thick cream. Add salt to taste; and if the patient is allowed cream, a tablespoonful of cream well beaten in is an improvement.WHOLESOME COOKERY. 172 431.—Panade. Cut up small 2 pounds of juicy rumpsteak, or a whole fowl, or a pheasant (freshly killed). Put it in a jar ; cover this jar tightly with a paper, and prick a few holes into the paper. Place the jar in a saucepan of cold water; the water ought to reach nearly to the top of the jar, but not sufficiently to come over. Fit the lid of the saucepan very tightly on, and let it simmer gently nearly all day. Pour off the small quantity of liquid which will have been extracted from the meat, and let it stand for the fat to rise and be removed. Now take the meat, pound it in a mortar, and run it through a sieve into the liquid. Add a little salt. Will be about the consistency of thick cream, and is easily digested. Can be used hot or cold. 432.—Potted Meat. Cut some fresh rumpsteak into small pieces; put it all, fat and lean, into a jar with half a teacupful of water. Put the jar in a saucepan of water; cover the jar up tight, and let the contents simmer till quite tender. Pound it now in a mortar, adding its own gravy by degrees; flavour with pepper and salt. Place it in jars, and cover with hot melted butter, if it is to be kept any time. This potted meat is excellent used for sandwiches, but it is better to make only a small quantity at a time.173 SUNDRIES. 433.—Orange Marmalade. Weigh the oranges, and cut them in halves or quarters. Take the peel off each half or quarter. Take the pips and skin from the fruit, and press it through a hair sieve. Soak the peel all night in water slightly salted; next day boil it in cold water, changing the water frequently. When the peel is soft, take it out; let it drain, then cut it into shreds or long strips. Now put the peel and the strained pulp into water (allow half a pint of water to each pound of fruit); add sugar (1 pound to each pound of fruit), a little grated lemon-peel. Boil all together until it is thick and clear. Put it into well-covered jars; keep some months before using. Will take from half to 1 hour to boil 434.—To prepare Dripping for Use. Put the dripping in a saucepan; boil it over a. slow fire for a few minutes ; skim it carefully ; let it stand to cool a little. Have a jar with some cold water at. the bottom; place a muslin over the top; pour the dripping through. When cold and set,, remove the dripping from the water into another jar. N.B.—Dripping ought to be clarified as above each time it has been used ; and it can be used very many times, especially if you occasionally add a little fresh dripping.WHOLESOME COOKERY. 174: 435.—Hints for Frying. There must be a quantity of fat in the pan; the fat must be as hot as possible; it must smoke before it is ready for use. The things fried must be the colour of biscuits, and must be dry. If they are not, it is because there is not enough fat, or because it is not hot enough. The fat must always be clear, and have no specks; the same fat can be used frequently, and must be clarified always before using it again. 436.—To keep Butter for Winter Use. Put the butter, which must be quite fresh and without salt, in a large stewpan; let it gradually warm by the side of the fire for 1 or even 2 hours; if necessary, skim it. Now pour it into earthenware jars, taking care to leave the sediment in the pan, and not on any account to pour any into the jar. Cover the pots carefully, as you would jam, and keep for use. N.B.—When butter is very cheap, instead of salt- ing it and keeping it for winter cooking, it is very much better to proceed as above. Salt butter is not nice for cooking; I cannot repeat this too often. 437.—Proportions for Frying Batter. 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, 1 yolk of egg, 1 spoonful of salad oil, 2 tablespoonfuls of milk. Stir it up175 SUNDRIES. thoroughly; then add a tablespoonful of water, pepper, and salt. Let it stand for some hours, or indeed till next day. Before using it, whisk up 2 whites of egg to a stiff froth, and beat it in. (Another way is to use vinegar or brandy instead of the water.) Dip the pieces of meat or vegetable or fruit into this batter, then drop into boiling fat, and fry very dry and crisp. 438.—To beat Whites of Eggs quickly and stiffly. With the whites add a pinch of salt, and use a fiat dish; beat with a large steel knife, and always in the same direction. Must be used at once. 439.—To chop Parsley fine. Wash it, and dvy it thovoughly before chopping it; if it is chopped damp, it sticks to the knife. 440.—Cock-Tail. 1 liqueur-glass of gin or brandy, 1J ditto of water, small quantity of Angustura bitters, a little lemon or fresh lime juice, sugar to taste. Whisk all up together. A little crushed ice is an improvement; but if ice be used, 1 liqueur-glass of water is sufficient’ 441. Plantagenet Liqueur. .

French beans, or cauliflowers, or a white cabbage, or the tops of asparagus, or celery, or beetroot and celery combined, when cooked and cold, make ex- cellent salads, either alone or together, if simply dressed with oil, vinegar, pepper, and salt in proper propor- tions. Meat cut into fine shreds, with a few chopped pickles, and dressed with a mayonnaise sauce (the recipe of which is given in all cookery books), or cold fish dressed with the same sauce, are also excellent cold dishes. 443.—Indian Chutnee. Cold cooked potatoes. Mash them up very smooth; add some chopped green chili, and onions chopped small, salt, and lemon-juice. Mix all thoroughly together; put it in a small mould, press it tight, and turn it out to serve with curry. N.B.—The chili and onion must be chopped very fine.

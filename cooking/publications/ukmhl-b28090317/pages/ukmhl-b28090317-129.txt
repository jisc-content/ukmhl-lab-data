Put them all together in the same saucepan, add some butter, and sprinkle over with flour; then add a little white wine and some good gravy. Stew this together, then skim it carefully. Now put in this some joints and fillets of roasted chicken, a few gherkins previously scalded, some chopped parsley, and some chopped anchovies (be sure to soak the anchovies in warm water first). Toss all this together without letting it boil, add some lemon-juice at the last, and serve. ✓ 271.—Fowl “ a la Verez.” Cut up a chicken as for a fricassee; fry it in butter, then add slices of Spanish onions and slices of tomato; continue cooking all together till done.

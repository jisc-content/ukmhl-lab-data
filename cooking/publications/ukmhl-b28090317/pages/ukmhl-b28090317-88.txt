WHOLESOME COOKERY. 63 159.—Glazed Jerusalem Artichokes. Wash, peel,and cut into uniform pieces some Jeru- salem artichokes. Put them into a stewpan; pour a little hot butter over them; season with pepper, salt, a little nutmeg, and lemon-juice; moisten them with a little stock or water. Put the lid on, and let them simmer on a slow fire for half an hour, during which time they ought to become a deep yellow. Boil them in their glaze; dish them up with an Italian sauce over them. 160.—Rice and Pumpkin. Cut a pumpkin into pieces; put it into an earthen jar, with some salt, an onion, a couple of cloves, small piece of celery, and a good lump of butter; add some water; put on the lid. Cook slowly, either in the oven or by the side of the fire. When cooked, pass it through a sieve. Now boil some rice; when two-thirds cooked, add the pumpkin to it, and finish cooking them together. Add a little cream and pepper at the last, and, if necessary, more salt. 161.—Salsifis Fritters. Scrape them and soak them in some water and vinegar; then boil them in plenty of water, with salt and a little flour, so as to keep them white. W7hen cooked, drain them; then season and fry them like cauliflower fritters (141).

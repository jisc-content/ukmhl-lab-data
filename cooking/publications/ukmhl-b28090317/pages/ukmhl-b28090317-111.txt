VEGETABLES, ETC. 01 229.—Truffles (To Prepare). Wash them in 2 or 3 cold waters; brush them well, until not a particle of earth remains. Place them in a small saucepan with enough marsala, or champagne, or white wine to nearly, if not quite, cover them. Boil for 10 minutes with the lid on. Now draw the saucepan to the side of the fire, and let them remain just warm for half an hour; then peel them, and chop them up for use. Put the peel back in the remainder of the wine; let it simmer for a long time, or until the wine is reduced to half its quantity; then melt in this some glaze, about the size of a filbert. Strain through a hair sieve for use- 230.—Truffled Omelet. When your omelet is just set, place the truffles (prepared as above) in the centre, and about a table- spoonful of the truffled gravy; double the omelet up carefully and serve at once. The omelet must be of a pale golden colour, and not hard or leathery.

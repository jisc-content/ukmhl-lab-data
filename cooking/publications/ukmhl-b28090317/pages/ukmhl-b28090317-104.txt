Boil a beetroot, carrots, a cauliflower, a few peas, and some bottoms of French artichokes, or Jerusalem artichokes, French beans—in fact, any vegetables in season. Line a mould with alternate slices of carrot and beetroot cut very thin; then fill the mould with alternate layers of vegetables, sprinkle with pepper and salt, and moisten with a little beaten yolk of egg. Press the contents down, steam about 20 minutes, and serve hot with a rich bechamel sauce round it. N.B.—If liked cold, do not steam it, but leave out the egg and turn it out cold, and serve a mayonnaise sauce round, in which mix a few capers. 209.—Plain Vegetable Salad. Boil separately equal quantities of young carrots, cauliflower, French beans, peas, asparagus tops, and potatoes, and half the quantity of young turnips. Drain them thoroughly; cut up the carrots, turnips, potatoes, and cauliflowers; place all in a salad bowl, and dress with oil, vinegar, pepper, and salt, or, if preferred, a mayonnaise sauce.

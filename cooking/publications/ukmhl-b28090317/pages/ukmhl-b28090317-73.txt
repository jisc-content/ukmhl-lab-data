53 SAUCES. Pat the crumb in a mortar with 3 cloves of garlic, 1 or 2 yolks of eggs, 6 Jordan almonds, peeled. Pound all quite smooth in a mortar, and stir in some oiL The oil must be poured drop by drop to prevent the sauce turning. Eat with boiled fish or plain boiled vegetables. If liked, add a little lemon-juice to the sauce. 119.—German Pudding Sauce. Dissolve 1-J- ounce of sugar in 2 glasses of white wine; when quite hot, stir in the well-beaten yolks of 3 eggs; whisk it up until quite frothy, and pour hot over the pudding. Whilst you whisk, keep the saucepan well to the side of the fire, as if this sauce boils it will curdle. 119a.—Vegetable and Meat Sauce (Sauce faute de Beurre). Put into a jar 1 or 2 ounces of fresh butter and 1 or 2 tablespoonsfuls of salad oil. Take 2 or 3 yolks of eggs, and beat them up with pepper, salt, and a tablespoonful of vinegar or lemon-juice. Put the jar in a stewpan of boiling water, and steam it. When the oil and butter are well mixed together, pour in the yolks very gently and stirring all the time, as you would a custard, and continue until it thickens properly. For a change, this sauce is very good with a little mustard added to it.

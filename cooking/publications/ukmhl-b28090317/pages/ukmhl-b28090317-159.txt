Pound 3 maccai'oons with some castor sugar; melt 1 ounce of butter and add it to the maccaroons. Beat up 6 yolks of eggs and 3 whites separately; then beat both whites and yolks up with the maccaroons as you would an omelet. Place the mixture in the dish in which it is to be served; put the dish in a saucepan of warm water, and let it steam; sprinkle some castor sugar over the top, and pass a hot salamander over. Serve hot or cold. 350.—(Eufs a la Neige. Take 6 eggs; beat the whites to a very stiff froth. Now take a pint of milk; sweeten and flavour it with vanilla. Put the milk in a saucepan; when it comes to a boil, drop in (by large tablespoonfuls) the white egg-froth. Turn each piece so as to cook it on every side (2 minutes will suffice). Remove it out of the milk, and with the six yolks of eggs and milk make a boiled custard, which when cold, serve with the lumps of white froth on the top.

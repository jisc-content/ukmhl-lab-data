167 BREAD, ETC. 422.—Directions for Oyster Patties Paste. Strain the juice of 1 lemon in 1 gill of water (cold). Beat 1 egg to a stiff froth, and mix with above. Put three-quarters of a pound of dried flour into a bowl, and stir in the above liquid; knead it to a smooth paste. Lay it on a slab, and spread over it three-quarters of a pound of fresh butter. Turn over the four sides ; dredge with flour and roll it out four times ; then fold it in three and let it stand in a cool place for 2 hours. Have ready two round paste-cutters, one 2 b inches across, the other 1-J inch. Roll out the paste a third of an inch thick and make your patties. The stewed oysters must be put in after the patties have been baked. 423.—Directions and Proportions for Pastry. 12 ounces of flour, 4J ounces lard, 4J ounces of butter, 1 teacupful of water, and a little salt. Mix the lard and flour together; rub it with the fingers (not the hands') as lightly as possible and as quickly as you can; add the water, and work it lightly into a paste. Roll the paste out, and spread upon it one-third of the butter; roll it again and spread again one-third of butter; do this again, when all the butter will be used. Double it over and put it in a bowl, and let it stand for 2 hours before cutting for use. _ The more you roll it the heavier the paste will become; so take care.

MEATS AND BIRDS. 101 Be careful to frequently baste the top of the veal with some of the gravy it is cooking in. When you are not basting, keep the saucepan covered. When the veal is cooked, take it out. Skim the sauce carefully, and strain it; put it in another saucepan, and let it stew till very much reduced. Now put the veal back, and leave it to colour (that part of the veal which is in the sauce will colour). Dish up the veal. Stir into the gravy a couple of tablespoonfuls of stock, so as to move all the gravy from the sides ; pour it over the veal. You must be careful to dish up the side of the veal which was downwards in the gravy. N.B.—If you are going to serve a puree of spinach or endive or sorrel with the veal, you will dress your purde with the veal gravy, and serve the whole thing round the veal. 249.—Fillet of Veal “ aux Anchois.” Take a thick slice off a fillet of veal; lard it through with some fillets of anchovy, season with pepper and salt. Pour over it some plain vinegar; leave it about 8 hours, then wipe the vinegar off. Sprinkle some flour over it on both sides; put some oil in a frying- pan, and toss the veal in it over a slow fire; turn it frequently on both sides. Take out the veal. Put the juice of 1 lemon into the sauce, stir it well over the fire; pour it over the veal and serve.

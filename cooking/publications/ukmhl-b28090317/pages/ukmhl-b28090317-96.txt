WHOLESOME COOKERY. 76 183.—Hot Polish Salad (Red Cabbage Salad). Cut a red cabbage in shreds; melt some goose dripping; season it to taste with vinegar, salt, and pepper. When it is hot, put in the cabbage and let it simmer; at the last moment stir in a few yolks of eggs. N.B.—If no goose dripping is at hand, butter or oil can be used. 184.—Curried Macaroni. Boil some macaroni and drain it; put it into the curry sauce; simmer for 5 or 10 minutes, and serve. Each piece of macaroni must be quite separate, and not cooked to a paste. 185.—Macaroni “ en Timbale.” Have some boiled macaroni; drain it well; put it in a saucepan, with pepper, salt, butter, and grated Par- mesan and Gray ere cheeses; toss it on the fire till the cheese is melted, and not longer. Have a buttered tin; line it with a nice thin paste; put the macaroni in it, cover the top with more paste, and fix a well-buttered paper on the top (to prevent the paste from burning). Put it in a hot oven, and bake from half an hour to an hour, according to the size. Turn out of the tin and serve.

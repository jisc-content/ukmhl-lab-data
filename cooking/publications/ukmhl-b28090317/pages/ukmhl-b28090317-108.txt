88 WHOLESOME COOKERY. N.B.—Eggs poached in bdchamel, Robert, piquante, curry, and ravigote sauces are equally good. N.B.—Hard-boiled eggs simmered for a few minutes in any of the above sauces are also very good. The dishes may be varied by serving some plain boiled rice instead of fried sippets. 219.—Eggs “ aux Asperges.” Have some small tender asparagus cut in pieces ; soak them for a couple of minutes in boiling water, then put them in a saucepan with some parsley, shallot, and butter. Add a pinch of flour, and simmer together; then add a little water or stock, pepper and salt. When cooked, pour the sauce in a baking-dish; place your raw eggs on the top, taking care not to break the yolks; sprinkle with pepper, salt, and nutmeg. Cook in the oven till the eggs are set, and serve hot. 220.—Eggs “ sur le Plat.” Spread some butter on a baking-dish; break the eggs on to the dish, taking care to keep the yolks whole; sprinkle pepper and salt over. Put the dish in the oven or on the side of the stove till set; serve at once on the same dish. If the white adheres to the bottom of the dish, the eggs are too much cooked, or there was not sufficient butter. They take about 5 minutes.

104 WHOLESOME COOKERY. 255.—Beignets de Cervelles. After the bi’ains are cooked, cut them into pieces, dip them in batter, and fry them in boiling fat. Serve them dry, with fried parsley, or with any sauce liked. 256.—Mixed Frittura. Brains, sweetbreads, and calves’ feet, calf’s head, artichokes, all previously cooked. Divide into pieces of the same size; egg and bread-crumb them, or flour them; fry them in butter. Add a little chopped parsley and lemon-juice to the butter, and serve alto- gether. N.B.—Remember that calves’ feet, after they are cooked in the same manner brains are cooked, can be boned and dressed with any sauce liked, or fried either in batter, or egged and bread-crumbed. Calves’ feet, if properly cooked, make an excellent and cheap dish. 257.—To prepare Mutton Tongues. Soak them for lj to 2 hours in cold water; then put them in boiling water, and leave them to soak until the skin can be quite easily removed. Split them in halves lengthways, and stew them in stock, with a few herbs and vegetables; then serve them with any sauce liked, taking care to finish cooking the tongues for ten minutes in the sauce with which they are to be served.

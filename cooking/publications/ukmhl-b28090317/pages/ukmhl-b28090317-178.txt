158 WHOLESOME COOKERY. 399.—Fondue. Allow as many eggs as there are persons. Weigh the eggs; take as much butter as will equal half the weight of eggs; then take as much grated Gruyere cheese as will equal a third of the weight of eggs. Break and beat up the eggs thoroughly in a saucepan; add the butter and cheese; place the saucepan on the fire, and stir it with a wooden spoon till it is as thick as a custard; add some pepper, and if it requires it, salt also. Serve at once. This dish must not boil. 400.—Cheese Fritters. Stir half a pint of water, 2 ounces of butter, and a pinch of salt over the fire until it boils; throw in 3 ounces of flour and 2 ounces of grated Parmesan cheese. Stir it quickly till cooked ; then add, one by one, 3 eggs well beaten; stir frequently. Now with a spoon take some small pieces of the mixture and fry in boiling fat. Dish up on a napkin with water- cress. 401.—Cheese Toast. Quarter of a pound of grated cheese. Pound it in a mortar, with half an ounce of butter and 1 egg. Cut some slices of bread; toast and butter them on both sides; spread the above mixture on half an inch thick, and bake about 4 minutes. It should rise, and must be eaten at once.

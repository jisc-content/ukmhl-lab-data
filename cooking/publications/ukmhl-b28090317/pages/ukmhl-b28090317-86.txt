Simmer together for a few minutes; then stir in a couple of yolks of eggs, and dish up with fried sippets. The leeks ought to be of about the con- sistency of dressed spinach. 153.—Leeks whole. After they have been washed and boiled, simmer them whole in any brown or white sauce liked. 154.—Italian Artichokes. Take the underparts of some French artichokes; put them in a saucepan with some butter, white wine, a little stock, and lemon-juice. When cooked, drain them, and serve up with Italian sauce over. N.B.—The preserved artichokes (fonds d’artichauds) are very good for this purpose; they will require very little cooking. 154a.—Stuffed Artichokes. Make a savoury stuffing with some chopped herbs, bread-crumbs, mushroom, pounded anchovy, a yolk or two of hard-boiled egg. Make this into a paste by cooking it in a little cream or gravy; fill the under- parts of some artichokes, and put them to simmer in a yellow or bechamel sauce. Serve up with the sauce and some fried sippets.

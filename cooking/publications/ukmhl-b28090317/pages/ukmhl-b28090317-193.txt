173 SUNDRIES. 433.—Orange Marmalade. Weigh the oranges, and cut them in halves or quarters. Take the peel off each half or quarter. Take the pips and skin from the fruit, and press it through a hair sieve. Soak the peel all night in water slightly salted; next day boil it in cold water, changing the water frequently. When the peel is soft, take it out; let it drain, then cut it into shreds or long strips. Now put the peel and the strained pulp into water (allow half a pint of water to each pound of fruit); add sugar (1 pound to each pound of fruit), a little grated lemon-peel. Boil all together until it is thick and clear. Put it into well-covered jars; keep some months before using. Will take from half to 1 hour to boil 434.—To prepare Dripping for Use. Put the dripping in a saucepan; boil it over a. slow fire for a few minutes ; skim it carefully ; let it stand to cool a little. Have a jar with some cold water at. the bottom; place a muslin over the top; pour the dripping through. When cold and set,, remove the dripping from the water into another jar. N.B.—Dripping ought to be clarified as above each time it has been used ; and it can be used very many times, especially if you occasionally add a little fresh dripping.

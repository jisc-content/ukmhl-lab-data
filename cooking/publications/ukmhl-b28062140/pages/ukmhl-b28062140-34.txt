III. METHODS OF PREPARING MEATS. The usual methods of cooking are roast- ing, broiling, boiling, frying, stewing, and decocting. We will consider each process briefly, from the point of view of practical chemistry. In roasting, the exterior of the piece of meat is submitted brusquely to a tempera- ture considerably above 212 degrees Fahren- heit or boiling-point, or at any rate not be- low boiling-point. The result is that the al- bumen of the surface is coagulated, and in this state acts as a barrier against the escape of the juice inside, and against the infiltration of liquid from without. After a few minutes close exposure to a brisk, clear fire, the joint may be drawn back a little and roasted slow- ly. Thus the interior mass of the meat, en- closed in an impervious jacket, cooks literal- ly in its juice, getting heated in the inside only to a temperature between 120 and 150

ON TABLE-SERVICE. 163 three quarters inches, and the large forks eight and one quarter inches. Simple knives and forks seem to me to be desirable, and all heavy and elaborate ornamentation should be avoided, especially ornamentation in high relief, which is irritating to handle. On the other hand, variety may be charming. At a dainty dinner I would have knives and forks of a different pattern with every dish. The glasses that figure on a table will de- pend on the wines served; they should be convenient and elegant in form, and depend- ent for their charm simply on the purity of the crystal and the beauty of their silhouette. Engraved glass, cut glass, and colored glass is used very sparingly by people of taste. Bordeaux, Burgundy, and Champagne wines should be drank out of nothing but the purest crystal glass, which conceals none of their qualities of color or scintillation. It is the custom to drink German wines out of colored glasses. Liqueur glasses are often colored also, but it seems absurd to mask the purity and delicate tones of whatever nectar we may be drinking by serving it in obfuscating glasses of green, blue, red, or any other color. For my part I would admit to the gourmetâ€™s table only pure and very simply decorated crystal glass.

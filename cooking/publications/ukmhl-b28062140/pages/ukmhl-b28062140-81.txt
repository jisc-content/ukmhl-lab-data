VII. ACE TAR I A, OR CONCERNING THE DRESSING OF SALADS. A SALAD is a dish composed of certain herbs or vegetables seasoned with salt and pepper, oil and vinegar, or some other acid element. The term salad is also applied to certain cold dishes composed of cold meats, fish, etc., seasoned like a salad, and combined with salads. You also speak of an orange salad when the fruit is cut into slices and seasoned in sweetened alcohol. As an aliment, salads vary greatly in nutri- tious quality, according to their composition and constituent elements. The leaf salads, like lettuce, endive, sorrel, etc., contain little but water and mineral salts. Of all the methods of seasoning a salad proper, the simple, so-called French dressing is the most delicate, the most worthy of the gourmetâ€™s palate, and the most hygienic. 5

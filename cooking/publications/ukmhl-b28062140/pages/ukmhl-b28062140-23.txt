THE GASTRONOMIC ART. 7 experienced eye will have detected the very first day that you set foot in the establish- ment. The maitre cThdtel— important, fat, fussy, and often disdainful in his manner— serves mainly to create confusion ; he receives your orders with deference, but rarely trans- mits them to the waiter with exactitude; and, as it is the waiter who communicates immediately with the cook, it is preferable to suppress, as far as possible, the useless in- tervention of the maitre d'hotel. For my own part, in the restaurants where I am in the habit of dining, I refuse to hold any communication with the maitres d'lidtel until, perhaps, at the end of the dinner, when I graciously allow a favored one to descend into the cellar in person and select for me, with his own podgy fingers, a creamy camem- bert cheese, the ripest and the richest of the lot. This concession I make, not because I admit for a moment that the maitre d'hdtel is an infallible judge of camembert, but mere- ly because, after dinner, I am more charita- bly disposed than before dinner, and, conse- quently, I desire to show to the maitre d'hotel that I cherish no ill-feeling against him in my heart of hearts, although I maintain that his functions, as they are generally fulfilled, have no raison d'etre.

32 DELICATE FEASTING. Of the vegetable tribe, lentils, beans, and peas are the most nourishing. Fruit, when perfectly ripe, is most easy of digestion, because the juice of fruit consists of pure grape-sugar (glucose) and water, and it is in the form of grape-sugar that all starchy food is finally absorbed into the system.

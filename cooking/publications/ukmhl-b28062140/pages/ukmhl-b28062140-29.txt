13 THE GASTRONOMIC ART. tion employed in the art of cooking; the con- ditions of success in each operation; the means of preserving, developing, and com- bining flavors. Now these operations may all be reduced to a few main processes, the thorough comprehension of which is the first step in the art of cooking. All the subtle- ties and delicacies of the art depend on the perfection of these main and elementary proc- esses ; and, to go even further, we may say that no one who is not master of these proc- esses can use with advantage a book of rec- ipes. Furthermore, both the cook and the critic will increase the lucidity of their rea- soning, and the completeness of their com- prehension of things, by acquiring a few elementary notions about the chemistry of cooking. Let me insist once more upon the necessity of the application of logic and rea- son to these questions of gastronomy; upon the importance of knowing the “why” and the “ wherefore,’’ if not the “ howand, above all, upon the desirableness of culti- vating the critical faculty as applied to the arts of cooking, of dining, and of serving food. The destiny of nations, it has been said, depends upon the manner in which they eat.

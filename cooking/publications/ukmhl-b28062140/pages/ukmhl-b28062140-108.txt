92 DELICATE FEASTING. In winter, bouilloji may be kept for three days. In summer it must be made fresh ev- ery morning. Directions for composing and manipulat- ing the pot-ait-feu and various bouillo?is and consommes will be found in “ The Unrivalled Cook-Book ” (Harper & Brothers), and in Mrs. Henderson’s “ Practical Cooking” (Har- per & Brothers). In the same works will be found many hints for preparing soups, to which I beg to add the following simple soups, which are excellent if made with good materials and cooked with care. Velvet Soup.—Cook some tapioca in good stock or bouillon, being careful not to make the liquid too thick. When ready place the yolks of eggs in the soup-tureen, one yolk for two persons. Then pour over them the tapio- ca, stirring the whole so that it may become thoroughly mixed and uniformly creamy. A grain of nutmeg improves this soup. Velvet Soup maigre. — This soup can be made without meat. Cook the tapioca in water, with a little pepper and salt. Put into the tureen a lump of butter and the yolks of eggs—two for three persons. Then pour over them the boiling tapioca. Stir up and serve.

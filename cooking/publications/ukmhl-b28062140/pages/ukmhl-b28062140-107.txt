IX. PRACTICAL SOUP-MAKING. The cookery-books contain multitudes of recipes for making soups. We need not re- peat them. In general, a cook who has the sentiment of his art will rarely follow pre- cisely any recipe given in a book; he will content himself with seeking ideas in books and carry them out according to his skill and feeling. Practice, experience, and work un- der good masters make the best cook. In Paris the women cooks often take lessons in the kitchens of the great clubs. The life and soul of household cookery, the basis of a good, plain dinner, and of a host of stews, sauces, purees, etc., is beef bouillon. The first thing to learn to make is the pot- au-feu. The result of the pot-au-feu must be savo- ry, clear, and free from grease. The operations of skimming and straining through a sieve are most important.

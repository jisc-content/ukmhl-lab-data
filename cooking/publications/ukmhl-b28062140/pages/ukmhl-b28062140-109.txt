PRACTICAL SOUP-MAKING. 93 I recommend to amateurs a shell-fish soup which I learned to make at Naples. The pres- ence of garlic in its composition need alarm only the squeamish. Garlic is a noble flavor. Shell-fish Soup.—Put into a stewpan some olive oil (half a tablespoonful for each person) and a little garlic finely chopped. When the garlic is well fried add some Tomato Sauce No. i (see Mrs. Henderson’s “ Practical Cook- ing,” Harper & Brothers), half a tablespoon- ful for each person; then put in your shell- fish— all sorts of small shell-fish, cockles, winkles, even mussels, etc., such as the mar- ket offers—well washed and brushed before- hand. Now add a spoonful of consomme for each person, a few cloves, and a little nut- meg. If your kitchen boasts no consomme you may use good bouillon, strengthened with a little of Liebig’s extract. When the soup has begun to tremble and throw up a few bubbles add a little more tomato ; let it boil awhile, and serve it clear with cubes of bread fried in oil. In order that the bread may still be crisp when eaten, the cubes, or croiltons, may be served apart, and some put into each plate just before the soup is ladled on them.

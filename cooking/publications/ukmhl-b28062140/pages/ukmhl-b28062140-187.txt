171 ON TABLE-SERVICE. amples, see the various pictures of feasts by the old Florentine painters already men- tioned. For lighting a dinner-table there remains to my mind but one illumination, namely, candles placed on the table itself in handsome flambeaux, and on the walls in sconces. Gas and electricity are abominations in a dining- room. Any system of lighting which leaves no part of a room in soft shadow is painful to the eye and fatal to the artistic ensem- ble. For the woman who wishes to show her beauty in the most advantageous condi- tions, and for the gourmet who wishes to feaSt his palate and his eyes in the most re- fined manner possible, a diner aux bougies is the ideal. At the Rothschild houses in Paris the dinners are served by candlelight, and, if the viands and the wines were as fine as the candlesticks, their dinners would be perfect. In the Baron Edmond de Rothschildâ€™s dining-room the air is kept cool in the sum- mer by two columns of crystal ice placed in a bed of flowers and foliage, one at each end of the room, and the floral decoration of the table is composed exclusively of cut orchids.

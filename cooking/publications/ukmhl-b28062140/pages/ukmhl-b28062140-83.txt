67 DRESSING SALADS. serve a dinner at so much a head. What a crude state of civilization this condition of things implies! But, to return from this digression, let us consider, first of all, salads of uncooked veg- etables and herbs. Such salads are made of lettuce—either cabbage or cos lettuce, which latter the French call Romaine, and which is the most delicate—endive, corn-salad—this is a species of valeriana or rather valerianellct locust a, called by the French Mdche—chicory, both wild and curly, sorrel, celery, garden and water-cresses, little white radishes called in French raiponce, beet-root, tomatoes, cu- cumbers. To give flavor to salads, you use the small and fine herbs that are in season, such as chervil, chives, tarragon, pimpernel, balm, mint, etc. In the spring all or some of these seasoning herbs above mentioned may be combined and eaten as a salad by them- selves. Such a salad bears the name of Vendome. The vegetables and herbs that are to be used uncooked must have been specially cul- tivated for the purpose; that is to say, they must have been grown rapidly, abundantly watered, and properly bleached during growth.

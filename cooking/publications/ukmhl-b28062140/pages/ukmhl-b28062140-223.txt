ON BEING INVITED TO DINE. 207 ty palates of the past. At present the great restaurants of Paris depend for support as much on foreigners as on resident Parisians; their patrons are, therefore, unstable, and the criticism of their cookery less constant and less rigorous than it used to be. Once more the word “ criticism ” flows from the point of my pen, and sums up the whole gist of the preceding pages. Without criticism there can be no delicate feasting. How often you hear people say, “ Oh! I am not particular. I do not pay any atten- tion to what I eat.” Certainly we can con- ceive that there are men devoid of the senses of taste and smell, just as we can conceive men for whom exquisite flowers, beautiful women, fine pictures, or incomparable stat- ues have no charm. But such men are to be pitied, supposing that we deign to accord them any manifestation of interest whatever. Whether our object be to get out of life the greatest amount of pleasure or the greatest amount of work, or both together, it is good policy to pay great attention to what we eat, and to strive in this, as in all that we under- take, to attain perfection.

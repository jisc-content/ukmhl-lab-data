METHODS OF PREPARING MEATS. 2J gravy during the baking process, and these particles become charred, and thus fill the oven with ammoniac and with a foul atmos- phere of empyreumatic oils, by which terri- ble word the chemists indicate the unwhole- some vapors generated through the action of fire. In the process of roasting before an open fire these empyreumatic odors are, indeed, generated-, but they pass off up the chimney, whereas in the oven they are imprisoned, and there penetrate the meat, destroy its fla- vor, and render it more or less insipid. Meat, however, may be baked in pies, be- cause in this case its surface, being protected by the crust, cannot be charred and impreg- nated with the foul empyreumatic oils. The baking of meat in a pie-crust amounts, in reality, to a stewing operation, the paste forming, as it were, a stew-pan with its lid. Frequent basting is essential to successful roasting. Otherwise, the coagulated surface of the meat would crack and split open dur- ing the operation, and allow an escape of the juice. The melted fat, poured over the meat, penetrates into every crevice, and by means of the higher temperature of the fat the surface of the meat is maintained in an impervious state.

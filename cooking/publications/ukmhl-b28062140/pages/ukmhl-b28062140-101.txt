THE THEORY OF SOUPS. 85 vious pages, is the grand event in our mate- rial daily life. In no branch of cookery has the imagina- tion of fanciful cooks been so industrious as in the combination and naming of soups. As we have over one hundred fairly distinct va- rieties of soup, it is desirable to avoid fancy names that convey no meaning, such as the names of princes and statesmen, and to call these soups by titles that give some idea of their composition. In this matter clearness and simplicity are desirable, and the example of Gouffd is to be followed in mentioning al- ways the characteristic ingredient of the soup, thus: potage a I'oseille, consomme aux pdtes d'Italie,soupe aux choux, puree d'asperge, etc. Potage, or soup, is the generic term, though in French soupe is reserved for such soups as are served with bread in them, while potage is applied to soups without bread. Potages are divided into gras and maigres, according as they have been prepared with or without meat. Potages gras are made with bouillons or decoctions of all kinds of butchersâ€™ meat, fowl, fish, and crustaceans. In the same way potages maigres are made from all sorts of vegetables.

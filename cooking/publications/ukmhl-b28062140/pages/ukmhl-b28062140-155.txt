THE DINING-ROOM. 139 china as a decoration. A famous dining-room, designed and painted by Whistler, for Mr. Leylandâ€™s house, is pale blue and pale gold, covered with arabesques that suggest the motif of peacocks and their feathers. The only decoration of this room is composed of decorative peacock panels on the shutters of the windows, and on the walls a collection of blue-and-white Chinese porcelain arranged on gilt shelves.

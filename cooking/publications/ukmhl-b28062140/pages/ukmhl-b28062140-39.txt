METHODS OF PREPARING MEATS. 23 to extract the juice of meat we place the flesh in cold water, the temperature of which is very slowly raised to the boiling-point: thus all the juice of the flesh is dissolved out and completely separated from the muscular fibre. Bloxam says : “ The object to be attained in the preparation of beef-tea is the extrac- tion of the whole of the soluble matters from the flesh, to effect which the meat should be minced as finely as possible, soaked for a short time in an equal weight of cold water, and slowly raised to the boiling-point, at which it is maintained for a few minutes. The liquid strained from the residual fibrine con- tains all the constituents of the juice except the albumen, which has been coagulated.” The economical French, in making their pot-au-feu and bouillon, do not mince the meat, but leave it in a solid mass, the only reason being that thus the meat may be pre-‘ sented at table, although there is very little nourishment left in it after the process of decoction is over. In boiling, the meat is exposed to a high temperature in water. You wait until the water has reached the boiling-point before you immerse the meat in it, and leave it to cook for about five minutes at that tempera-

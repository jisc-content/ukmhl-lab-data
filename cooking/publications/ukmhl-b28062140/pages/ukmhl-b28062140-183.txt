The gourmet will prefer the exclusive use of ceramic dishes and plates in serving a din- ner, because a metal dish when heated com- municates a slight flavor of its own to the natural flavor of the viands. In the Parisian restaurants, even in the best, they have a vile habit of serving a duck, for instance, on a metal dish, and, while the maitre d'hotel cuts up the duck and deposits the pieces on the dish, he has a spirit-lamp burning beneath it. The dish thus becomes hot, the gravy bub- bles, the pieces of duck get an extra cooking and absorb the taste of the heated metal, and the result of the whole operation is not roast duck, but oxidized duck. This barbarous op- eration is practised daily, but only very few diners protest, to such a low level has the art of delicate feasting fallen in the country where it once flourished most brilliantly. The manner of serving a dinner is a ques- tion easily settled, provided we bear in mind the fact that it is desirable to let as little time as possible elapse between the cooking of food and the eating of it. This considera- tion militates against the service a la Fran- gaise, and favors the service & la Russe. In

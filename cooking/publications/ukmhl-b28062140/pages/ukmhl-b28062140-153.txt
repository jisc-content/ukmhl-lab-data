THE DINING-ROOM. 137 fashion with stucco or marble, adorned with columns and pilasters, and friezes, either with bare walls or with walls decorated with stucco bass-reliefs, or Pompeian arabesques. The neo-Greek or Pompeian style still has its advocates. During the second empire, Prince Napoleon had a Pompeian palace built in the Avenue Montaigne, at Paris, from de- signs by M. Alfred Normand. In this palace, which is in reality only a very modest villa, the dining-room is lighted by a large window divided into three, by two pilasters; the ceiling is panelled in caissons, and the walls are panelled in red, blue, and yellow, which colors serve as the ground for the most deli- cate ornamentation that the Pompeian style created—slender columns, trellises, long fila- ments of plants, light garlands, blond or ver- meil fruits, bows of ribbon, birds, cups, mu- sical instruments, chimeres, intermingled dis- creetly with ears of corn, fish, and game, which reveal the intention of the room without sating the eyes before sating the stomach, as is often the result of our modern game and fruit pieces, fitter to serve as a sign for a butcher’s shop than as a vision to be placed before the eyes of delicate gourmets.

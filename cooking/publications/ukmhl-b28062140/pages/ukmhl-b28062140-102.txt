DELICATE FEASTING. 86 The name puree, or creme, is given to thick soups made of alimentary substances crusted or pounded, such as game, pease, beans, len- tils, asparagus, etc. The soups are gener- ally very nourishing, but not easily digest- ible. Consomme is the name given to the supreme result of the decoction of animal and vegeta- ble matter; it is a perfect bouillon, a bouillon consomme. In the cook-books you will find directions for making the ordinary consomme, composed of the juices of beef, veal, and fowls decocted in grand bouillon, or fine stock, and also for making consomme de volatile, consomme de gibier, and consommes of vegeta- bles. Consomme is necessaiy for making fine soups, but for household cookery the good ordinary stock is sufficient. (N.B.â€”Without good beef-stock it is impossible to make a dinner worthy of the name.) Stock is con- stantly required in the most simple opera- tions of cookery. The aversion of the An- glo-Saxon cook to making stock is one of the main sources of his inferiority. Extract of meat does not take the place of stock. Extracts of meat should be very sparingly used in a well- regulated kitchen, and extracts of coffee never.

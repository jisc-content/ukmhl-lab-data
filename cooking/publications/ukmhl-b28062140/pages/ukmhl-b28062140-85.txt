DRESSING OF SALADS. 69 away the outer leaves, which are too green and tough, and which are often bruised and dirty. Then take your lettuce, cut it into four quarters, beginning at the base ; take off the larger leaves one by one until you reach the heart; carefully wash each leaf and drain the whole. A spherical wire basket is useful for draining a salad ; you put the leaves in the basket and swing it violently to and fro, and so shake the water out. Get your leaves as dry as possible; even wipe them with a towel after having shaken them in the wire basketâ€”the reason being that whenever there is any water left on the leaves the dressing will not get distributed. The lettuce having been well washed and dried, you arrange the leaves loosely in the salad-bowl, which should be large and roomy, say about one and a half times the volume of the mass of the salad, in order that you may have plenty of room to turn it during the seasoning process. On the top of the salad you lay a handful of seasoning herbs, chervil and chives and a sprig of tarragon. In this state the salad is served if it is to be seasoned at table; in any case the salad must not be seasoned un- til a few minutes before it is eaten, with the reserve to be made further on.

THE ART OF EATING AT TABLE. 195 without making strange noises or still strang- er grimaces, but discreetly and in a manner such as to rinse your teeth and gums ; mean- while you have emptied the rest of the water out of the goblet into the bowl, where you dip your finger-tips; then, having sufficient- ly washed your fingers, you raise the bowl to your mouth, spit the water out of your mouth into it, replace the empty goblet in the bowl, and the waiter removes the object, while you wipe your mouth and your fingers on your napkin, the whole business being the affair of half a minute. Of course, if you are at a table where the mouth-rinsing is not gen- erally practised, you will abstain; but let us hope that it will not be your misfortune to dine at a table where finger-bowls are not known. If such is your unhappy lot, you are quite justified in filling up a glass of water, dipping your finger-tips in it, and even moistening your napkin in order the better to wipe your lips clean before leaving the table. These small operations, trivial as they may seem, are necessary for comfort and for cleanliness; and cleanliness, it has been said, is next to godliness.

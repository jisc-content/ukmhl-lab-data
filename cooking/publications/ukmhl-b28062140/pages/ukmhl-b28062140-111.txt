PRACTICAL SOUP-MAKING. 95 Bread-crumbs, six eggs, a quarter of a pound of bacon, six chickens’ livers, or the equivalent in calf’s liver, ham, parsley, onions, a grain of garlic; chop all this up very fine, stuff it into the heart of the cabbages, and bind the leaves up with string before putting them into the pot. Now take a stewpan and put into it some bacon cut up into small pieces, and then the half-cooked hen, and then brown the whole with butter. Make a brown sauce with but- ter and flour (see “Unrivalled Cook-Book,’ p. 395, “ Roux ”), enough to just cover the hen in the stewpan; add a little uncooked rice, a dozen boiled onions, and let it stew until the rice bursts. Serve the poule-au-riz with the addition of a little nutmeg and cay- enne, or with the sweet Hungarian paprika, if you have any. The soup and the beef of this poule-au- pot, served together with all the vegetables, constitute the “Petite Marmite" that has be- come so popular in Parisian restaurants of late years. In many restaurants little earth- en marmites, containing one or two portions, are served on the tables, and in each marmite is a small fragment of beef, pieces of all the vegetables, and a portion of the clear bouillon.

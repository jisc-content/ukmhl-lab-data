II. THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKING. Animal chemistry is in a very backward condition, as compared with vegetable and mineral chemistry. Prof. Bloxam, for in- stance, tells us that the chemical formulae of a great many animal substances are perfectly unintelligible, conveying not the least infor- mation as to the position in which the com- pound stands with respect to other sub- stances, or the changes which it might un- dergo under given circumstances. Certain re- sults, however, have been obtained, and will be here cited so far as they have significance in the operations of cooking, no pretension being made to originality, and the authori- ties being cited in each case. For the general guidance of the cook, meat may be said to be composed of four elements, namely: muscular fibre, albumen, fat, and juiceâ€”the latter being, chemically speaking, a very complicated substance containing a number of proximate elements.

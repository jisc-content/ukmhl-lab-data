6l ON RELISH AND SEASONING. Take an eel and a pike, or a carp, or a perch, or a barbel, or any combinations of these fish which the larder may offer, even an eel alone, or, better, an eel and a pike; clean them and cut them up into pieces about two inches square. Suppose that you have two good pounds of fish. First, take a sauce- pan into which you put two ounces of butter and twenty small onions peeled and blanched. Let your onions get browned over the fire; then add one and a half ounces of flour, pep- per and salt, and stir for five minutes, adding a few mushrooms previously browned in butter and a little lemon-juice, and a little water if the mixture needs it. Then add one pint of red wine, a bouquet garni, a clove of garlic, pepper and salt, and a pint of good bouillon or meat-juice. Cover your pot, and let this mixture simmer twenty minutes. Then put in your slices of eel and of the less tender fish (as carp, for instance), and cook for a quarter of an hour. Next put in your tender fish, add a wine- glassful of brandy, and cook five or ten min- utes longer. Take out the bouquet and the garlic, and serve on a dish with the onions and sauce poured over the fish. The sauce will be creamy, and of a bluish-brown color.

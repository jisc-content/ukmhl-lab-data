The fork is to be held with the index finger stretched out so as to maintain it in an almost horizontal position. Nothing seems clumsier than to grip the fork with clenched fist and to hold it perpendicular as the Germans often do. Nothing is less “ English you know ” than to convey food to the mouth with the knife or to touch fish with a knife.

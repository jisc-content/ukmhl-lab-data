57 ON RELISH AND SEASONING. use in a well-corked bottle. This allspice is used alone or mixed with salt, the proportion being four times as much salt as spice. Supposing you have to season three pounds of galantine, the dose required, according to Gouffe, would be one ounce of salt and spice mixed in the above proportions. The best way of seasoning fish whose flesh is not naturally full-flavored or extreme- ly delicate is to cook it in seasoned wa- ter, or, as the French call it, in a court-bouillon. The real court-bouillon is made thus: On the bottom of your fish-kettle lay a bed of sliced carrots, sliced onions, green parsley, thyme, bay-laurel, a sliced lemon or a sliced orange, and some whole pepper, say twenty grains (not grains in weight, but grains in the botanical sense). On this bed lay your fish, and cover it with half white wine and half water (and if you have no white wine use vinegar or verjuice, two or three wineglass- fuls added to the water). Put your kettle on a moderate fire, and as soon as the liquid boils withdraw it immediately, and take out your fish,which you will find to be perfectly cooked. Fish must always be put into cold court- bouillon.

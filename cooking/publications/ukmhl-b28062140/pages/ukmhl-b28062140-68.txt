VI. ON RELISH AND SEASONING. “ The fundamental principle of all Is what ingenious cooks The Relish call; For when the market sends in loads of food They all are tasteless till that makes them good.” “ The Art of Cookery." The worthy cook who is empress of my kitchen, queen of my stomach, and, therefore, mistress of my humor, won my confidence by a simple remark that she made the first time I had friends to dinner after she had entered upon her duties. “ Monsieur,” she said, for she is of Gaulish origin ; “ monsieur, I am very pleased to see that none of the gentlemen last night touched the salt-cellar. I could not desire a finer compliment.” If I or my guests had found it necessary to ruffle the smooth surface of the salt-cellar, and add a pinch to any of the dishes, it would have been a proof that my cook had not succeeded in seasoning her dishes to the point.

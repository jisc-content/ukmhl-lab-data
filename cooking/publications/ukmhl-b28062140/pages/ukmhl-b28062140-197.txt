THE ART OF EATING AT TABLE. 18l and cats do, nor with your napkin ; make use of a splinter of lentiscus wood, or a quill, or of those small bones which are found in the legs of fowls. “ Gayety is becoming at table, but not ef- frontery. Do not sit down without having washed your hands and cleaned your nails. When you wipe your hands drive away all morose thoughts ; at meals you ought not to seem sad yourself nor to sadden others. Nam in convivio nec tristem esse decet nec contris- tare quenquam.” Erasmus further recommends children not to put their elbows on the table; not to wriggle on their chairs, but to sit upright; and to lay their napkin on the left shoulder or the left arm. “ The drinking-glass should be placed on the right, also the knife for cut- ting meat, nicely wiped (cultellus escarins rite purgatus); the bread on the left. “To begin a meal by drinking is the act of drunkards, who drink from habit and not from thirst. It is not only bad manners, but bad for the health. Before drinking, finish what food you have in your mouth, and do not approach your lips to the glass until you have wiped them with your napkin or your handkerchief.

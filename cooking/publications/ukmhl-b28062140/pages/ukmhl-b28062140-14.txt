INTRODUCTION. X a sort of higher lLand-book of the kitchen and dining-room, if I may so express myself (and I think I may)—will greatly help to increase in America a knowledge of the true principles of delicate feasting. If, after reading your pages, $o full of ideas — so suggestive, as the French modernists would say—my countrymen do not become con- vinced, with that charming poet and gastron- omist, Theodore de Banville, that the hygiene of the stomach is also the hygiene of the mind and soul, and that delicate cookery develops the intelligence and the moral sensibility, the fault will not be yours. I approve you heart- ily and wholly, even in your paradoxes, which always contain a kernel of logical observation and judicious criticism. Adieu, my dear author; macte virtute, by which I mean, continue in your efforts to win a glorious pair of gouty crutches, mid believe me always your devoted and inseparable compan- ion in gastronomy, P. Z. DIDSBURY.

METHODS OF PREPARING MEATS. 19 degrees Fahrenheit, which is not sufficient to coagulate and harden the interior albumen. By this outer dried layer the meat inside is protected from evaporation and desiccation, and, being acted on by the liquid juice, it un- dergoes a maceration and a temperature suf- ficient to disintegrate the muscular fibre, to gelatinize and render soluble the connective tissue that binds the fibres together, and to develop the aroma enough to make the meat agreeable to the taste. What the aroma is remains a mystery. All we know is that it comes from the brown sapid substance pro- duced on the outer layer of the flesh by the operation of roasting. In this part of the meat, according to Bloxam, “ some of the constituents of the juice suffer a change which gives rise to the peculiar flavor of roast meat.” Broiling requires a brisk fire, free from smoke, the combustible being either charcoal or coke. The fire should extend somewhat beyond the edges of the gridiron, in order that the sides of the meat may be acted upon by the heat at the same time as that portion which is in more immediate contact with the fire. The albumen over the entire surface of the

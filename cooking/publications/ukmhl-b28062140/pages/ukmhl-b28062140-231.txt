SUMMER HOLIDAYS. Travelling Notes in Europe. By THEODORE Child, Author of “ Delicate Feasting.” pp. vi., 304. Post 8vo, Cloth, Orna- mental, $1 25. A delightful book of notes of European travel. . . . Mr. Child is an art critic, and takes us into the picture-galleries, but we never get any large and painful doses of art informa- tion from this skilful and discriminating guide. There is not a page of his book that approaches to dull reading.— N. Y. Sun. Mr. Child is a shrewd observer and writer of an engag- ing style. He interests the reader with abundant informa- tion, and pleases him by his lively manner in communicating it.—Hartford Courant. Mr. Child is always a brilliant and interesting writer, and his sketches of travels are invariably picturesque and ani- mated in style.—Saturday Evening Gazette, Boston. Mr. Child is a very agreeable travelling companion, and his choice of places for a summer ramble is excellent. . . . The French chapters—on Limoges, Reims, Aix-les-Bains, and especially the voyage on French rivers—are abundant in novelty and odd bits of interest, as well as in beauty of scene and sympathy.—Nation, N. Y. The author gives glimpses of many by-ways which the ordinary tourist never dreams of. He is, moreover, a phi- losopher, something of a poet, a good judge of art and ar- chitecture, and, finally, a cosmopolitan with catholic tastes, but with an eager curiosity which no amount of sight-seeing can ever sate.—San Francisco Chronicle. A very pleasant volume of sketches by an accomplished traveller, vvho knows how to see and how to describe, and who can give real information without wearisome detail.— Providence Journal. Mr. Child s notes have not only the charm of a practised and grateful pen, but that of unusual originality of theme to recommend them.—New Haven Palladium.

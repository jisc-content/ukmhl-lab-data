It is only after it has been subjected to a certain amount of cook- ing that the desired flavor makes its appear- ance, by which the appetite is stimulated, and the nutritive qualities of the food conse- quently improved. “ The preparation of meat in cooking should be carefully managed so as to accom- plish the results above described. For if the heat be insufficient the proper flavor will not be developed; and if the heat be excessive, the meat, instead of being cooked, will be burned and decomposed, and thus rendered useless for the purpose of nutrition.” Notice how constantly science recurs to the physiological advantages of delicate cook- ing, in that it stimulates the appetite, pleases the taste, assists in the digestion, and actually improves the nutritious qualities of food. Before cooking meat, a sufficient time must have elapsed since the slaughtering to have allowed the cadaveric rigidity to pass and the spontaneous reaction to set in which deter- mines a primary disintegration of the tissues. The time which meat has to be kept varies according to the temperature. If cooked while in a state of cadaveric rigidity, that is

ON COMFITS. 193 is the inner bark. This breaks in splinters, and has a warm, aromatic taste, and is of a reddish colour. Take as much Cinnamon bark as you think will suffice, steep it in water for a few hours to soften' it; cut it into small pieces, about half an inch* long, and about the size of a knitting needle. Dry it in the stove. Put your pieces, when dry, into the balancing pan, and have a fire in the pan be- neath. Boil some syrup to the " Large Thread," dip your whisk into it, and shake the syrup over the pieces of Cinnamon. With your right hand gently swing the pan, so that th^ Cinnamon may take the syrup evenly. ^ Charge with syrup eight or nine times more, drying them thoroughly between each charge. You must not use your hand for these as for other comfits, as they are liable to break in two. Re- peat the series of charges until the Cinnamon hag: become quite white with coated sugar, which coat^ should be sufficiently thick to admit of the syrup' now beiug poured on with a ladle. Now charge them with the syrup, as in the making of other Comfits; and when they are suf- ficiently covered, whiten them with the best white crystallized sugar, swinging the pan, and drying- them between each of the charges. Six or seven * small charges will be sufficient of this whitening syrup. o

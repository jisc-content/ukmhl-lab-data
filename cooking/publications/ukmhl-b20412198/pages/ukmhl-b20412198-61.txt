83 PRESERVED FRUITS. 32. Whole Strawberries. Select some fine Strawberries, not too ripe, pick the stalks off, put them into a pan with some syrup at the " Small Thread f let them simmer, but not boil; take them off, and place them in an earthen pan until next day; then drain them off, add fresh sugar to the syrup, boil it up, put the Strawberries in, let them simmer, put them back in the pan for two days; then drain them again from the syrup, add more sugar to the syrup, boil this to the " Large Pearl,'' and put in the Straw- berries. Now boil up, skim them well, and put them by in a pan. The Elton Pine Strawberries are the best for preserving. 33. Red Cherries. Get six pounds of Kentish Cherries, stone them,* put them into a pan with four pounds of loaf sugar, and three pints of water; put them on the fire, and boil fifteen minutes; then place the mix- ture in an earthen pan until next day. After this, drain them, add one pound of loaf sugar, boil five minutes; repeat this for three days, giving the Cherries a boil in the syrup each time. * Some do this by running a quill into the cherry near the stalk, and loosening the stone. With a little practice you will soon be enabled to loosen the stone in such a manner that you can pull it out by the stalk. The quill should be shaped like a pen, only the point must not be sharp.

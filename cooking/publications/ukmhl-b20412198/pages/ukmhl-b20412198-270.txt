220 THE MODERN CONFECTIONER. the dinner was placed on the table, thereby not allowing sufficient space to admit of the Dessert. At the present time, however, the whole of the Dessert is placed upon the table previous to the company sitting down, as the dinners are now served " a la Russe"—viz., in the Russian fashion— the first and second courses being handed by the attendants round the table, two or more dishes at a time. You cannot, therefore, bestow too much labour on your Dessert so as to render it recherche, as the company, from its being placed before them the whole time of dinner, will be able to judge of its beauty and good taste. The beauty of a Dessert entirely depends on the taste and skill of the Confectioner in arranging and dishing it up neatly and tastefully. From what has just been said on Dessert, you will have learnt the proper method of placing it on the table. Remember, that two high dishes are not placed together, but alternate, high and low, thereby giving a lighter appearance to the table. Use plenty of fresh leaves in dishing up fruits, as they give a very neat and clean appearance. Assiettes should be dressed very neatly with bon- bons, small fancy biscuits, liqueur candies, &c., on small lace-stamped papers. The plans of Desserts will convey very correct ideas as to the proper and most tasteful methods of arranging them.

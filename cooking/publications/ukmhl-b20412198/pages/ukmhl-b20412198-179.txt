ON BISCUITS AND CAKES. 139 sugar, and pour the butter and treacle into it. Having well pounded the pieces of peel, and passed them through a sieve, add them to the treacle and butter. Now mix well together to a stiff paste. Roll it out in a little flour, and cut up into any size you think proper. They may be made round by pinching. Butter the papers you intend to bake them upon. A hot oven will be required. 238. Wafer Biscuits. 3 Eggs, 3 oz. Sugar, oz. Flour, drop each of Essence of Cloves and Oil of Cinnamon. These are frequently employed to ornament creams. The sugar must be pounded; sift it through a fine sieve, then melt it. Break the eggs; use the whites only; and having sifted the flour, mix all three well together, adding the two drops of essence to flavour. Butter your iron or stout tin plates a little, and drop the paste, which should be thin, in clots the size of a halfcrown or a crown piece, and four or five inches apart. When the tin is full, dip the finger into the centre of each liquid biscuit, and spread it out until it is exceed- ingly thin, and large. Bake to a good colour, and roll them on a round stick, like Almond Wafers (No. 229), or twist them into horns.

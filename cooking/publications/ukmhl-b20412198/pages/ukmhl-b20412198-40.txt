16 THE MODERN CONFECTIONER. egg in with the water before pouriDg it on the Sugar. Now, get about one pound of charcoal (that made out of hedge wood, or small branches is the best), beat it very fine, and stir it into the Sugar. As it boils, skim it, as in the previous case, and add cold water to prevent it running over. Now commence straining it through a pocket-shaped strainer of cloth. First of all it is quite black, but the straining must be proceeded with until the mixture is quite clear. If you pour some of the syrup into a glass, you will soon see if it is perfectly clear and fine; if it is not, you must keep on straining. Where Sugar is required to be clarified on a large scale, I would recommend the use of a boiler made after the fashion of the one already described. (See Figures 1 and 4, described at page 1.) As will be perceived, it is a boiler fitted with a small gas-stove beneath. A tap draws off the liquor into the strainer, which filters the syrup into the pan or reservoir beneath. After the syrup has been skimmed, and it has become clear, the tap may be turned on. At first the mixture will be black, but this must be poured back into the boiler; when what flows from the boiler into the receptacle underneath will soon be found to be quite clear and fit for use.

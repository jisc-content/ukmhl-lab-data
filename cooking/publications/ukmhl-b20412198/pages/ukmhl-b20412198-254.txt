They are made of copper, electro-silvered. They come principally from France, and are in sets of about twenty-five diffe- rent patterns. Take a piece of writing paper, and form it into a cone; cut the point off, that the tube you wish to use may be inserted in the end of it. Fit it in so that it will not slip out; the paper cone should then be filled with Iceing, and the mouth part turned down to prevent the sides from opening. The Iceing is then pressed or gently squeezed out in a thread of the size required for decorating. Flowers, scrolls, leaves, borders, animals, and other devices, are formed on Cakes, fee, after they are Iced; the successful execution of which depends on the skill of the artist.

A few lessons from a practised hand, however, with diligence and good taste on the part of the young practitioner, are of much more value than any directions that might be given in a book.

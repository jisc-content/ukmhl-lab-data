ON CREAM AND OTHER ICES. 95 sistence of, and as smooth as butter. Coffee Ice Cream made in this manner is Tery delicious. Some make it with ground Coffee, well strained, but the Cream has then a disagreeable brown colour. See that the Coffee is not over-roasted. 141. Green Tea Ice Cream. 2 oz. Grreen Tea, 8 oz. Sugar. Take three parts of a cupful of the best Green Tea, and pour boiling water over it. The water should just cover the Tea; let it stand until the strength is extracted, then pour it through a fine sieve into a pint of Cream. Sweeten with eight ounces of sugar, and freeze as in Custard Ices, (See No, 187.) 142. Chesnut Ice Cream. Take two pints of Chesnuts, remove the husks, and bake them in your oven. When softened, pick them over, removing any bits of skin or stringy rind. Put the Chesnuts, a few at a time, in a mortar and well pound them^ adding portions of a pint of new Cream until both the Nuts and the Cream are well mixed in the mortar. See that this utensil is exceedingly clean. Now break seven or eight eggs, and add their yolks to the Cream, with ten ounces of sugar and a little orange-flower water to flavour (if you like it).

Blanch your Almonds in boiling water, then skin them quickly, and, as they are done, drop them warm into cold water, to whiten them. At the end of two days take them out of the cold water, let them dry, and then pound them extra fine, sprinkling over them occasionally a little orange- flower water. Having weighed the Paste, take your sugar, in the proportion mentioned above, and clarify it. When boiled to the " Crack," pour it into the Almonds, and mix well with your wooden spoon. The Paste must now be taken out, and put to cool in an earthenware pan. When cold, take it out of this and put it into a mortar, and pound it well.

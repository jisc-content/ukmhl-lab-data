ON COMFITS. 197 well about, that they may be coloured equally; put them into the stove to dry. The surface of the Nonpareils only should be stained with the colour. Directly they are properly dry, take them out of the stove. Too much heat spoils their ap- pearance. If you propose to have Nonpareils of various tints, put the colours in different pots, and divide the comfits. As a rule, have twice as many white Nonpareils as any other tint. The other colours will thus be shown off to better advantage.

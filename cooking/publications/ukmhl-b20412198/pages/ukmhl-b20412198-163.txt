Rasp the lemon or orange peel off on a grater, or piece of rough sugar. The paste will now be ready for dropping on the iron plates. Get a common funnel (the aperture at the bottom must not be too large) and flll it with paste. Have the iron plates, which should now have cooled, before you, and let the paste fall in drops the size of a shilling. Drop in rows, and as near as you like so long as they do not touch.

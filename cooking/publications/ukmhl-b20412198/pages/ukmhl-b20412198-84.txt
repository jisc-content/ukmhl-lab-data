54 THE MODERN CONFECTIONER. 72. Greengage Compote. Prick the Gages with a fork, put them into a pan of water having a little salt in it. Set the pan on the fire; when they are tender, put them into cold water, in which let them stand two or three hours. Now warm them in syrup at the " Large Thread." When cold, serve. 73. Cherry Compote. Your Cherries should be fine. Let the stalks be cut off about half way. Wash in cold water, and drain in a sieve quite dry. Boil your syrup to the " Pearl," and throw in the Cherries, and let them boil quickly for five or six times. In order to preserve the colour of Red Cherries, or, indeed, any other fruit of this colour, they should be well- boiled. Having moved them from the fire, stir them gently with the spatula or spaddle. Cool the fruit, and put them in the Compotiers, with their stalks upwards. If any scum rise, take it off. The stones of the fruit may also be taken out. 74; Strawberry Compote. Take off the stalks, and throw them into syrup boiled to the " Small Thread.'" When near boiling, take them off. When cool, serve.

17 SUGAR. 4. The Degrees for Boiling Sugar. The confectioner should have a perfect knowledge of the Degrees of Boiling Sugar after it has been clarified. There are nine essential Points or De- grees in Boiling Sugar, and these were termed by Mr. Gunter, many years since, the mystery of confectionery. They are â€” Small Thread. Large Thread. Little Pearl. Large Pearl. The Blow. The Feather. The Ball. The Crack. The Caramel. 5. The Small Thread. The sugar being clarified, put it on the fire, and after boiling a few moments, gently dip the top of your fore-finger into the syrup, and apply it to your thumb, when on separating them imme- diately the sugar forms a fine thread, which will break at a short distance, and remain as a drop on the finger and thumb. This is termed the " Small Thread." 6. The Large Thread. Boil a little longer, and again dip the fore-finger into the syrup, and apply it to the ball of the thumb. This time a somevjhat longer string will be drawn. This is termed the " Large Thread." C

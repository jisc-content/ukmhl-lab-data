168 THE MODERN CONFECTIONER. 290. Ginger Drops. Take as much Ginger as you wish to use, pound, and sift it through a fine lawn sieve; add it to as much sugar as you desire to flavour, and mix with clear water. Some use the Ginger sold at shops all ready powdered; others simply the essence of Ginger, colouring the paste with saffron. The yel- low. East India Ginger, however, makes the best Drops. 291.

Lavender, Violet, Musk, or Millefleur Drops, Aee all made as the preceding, being flavoured with the essences which give them their names.

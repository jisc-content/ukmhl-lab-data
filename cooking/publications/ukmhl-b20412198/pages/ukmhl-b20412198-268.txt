CHAPTER XXVIII. ON DISTILLATION. 365. General Remarks, &c. Formerly a knowledge of Distillation was of great importance to the Confectioner, as it enabled him to make his own oils, flavours, and spirits, instead of purchasing worthless and adulterated articles. Now, however, but few, if any, of the largest Con- fectioners distil on their own premises. The spirits and essences may all be purchased at respectable shops whose reputations for fair dealing have been too long established to admit of the least doubt as to any adulteration on their part. Of the spirits and essences now most in use, I may enumerate Rose Water, Lemon Water, Orange Water, and Cinnamon Water ; Spirit of Vanilla, Spirit of Violets, Maraschino, the Spirit of Barhadoes Cream, Aniseed Spirit, Spirit of Orange, Gedra- tys. Coffee, JEscuhac, Tea, Apricot, Curago, Almonds, Cherries (or Kirchenwasser) ; Ratafia of Cherries, JRaspjberries, Currants, Oranges, Black Currants, Orange Flowers, Mulberries, and Yellow ^scuhac.

55 COMPOTES. 75. Apple Compote. Cut some fine Apples in halves, peel them, clean out the cores, and drop them into cold water. Having taken them out, prepare some thin syrup, and boil your Apples in it until they are soft. Now place them in Compotiers. See that the syrup is strained through a fine sieve, then pour it back into your Apples. 76. Pear Compote. Peocure fine Pears, cut them in halves, and boil in water until soft. Pare them, clean the stalk, and place them in cold water. After a few minutes, drain them. Get some syrup ready, boil it to the " Small Thread," and add your Pears. Now let them boil on a brisk fire till they are quite done. If the syrup is not reduced enough, take out your Pears, give the syrup a boil, and then re- move it from the fire. When cold, add your Pears to the syrup, and it is then ready to selcve up. Some lemon-juice (that from one lemon will be sufficient) added to the syrup whilst boiling will give the Pears a white appearance, if you desire them to be this colour. The flavour of a lemon in most Compotes you will find agreeable to the generality of tastes. Should your Pears be small, they need not be cut in half.

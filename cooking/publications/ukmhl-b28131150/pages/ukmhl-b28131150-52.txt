36 eveetbodtâ€™s dessert book. KATAFIAS.* Blaucli and beat to a paste eight ounces each of sweet and bitter almonds, using a little orange-flower or rose water to keep them from oiling. Put witli them a pound of loaf-sugar beaten fine and sifted, and the whites of four eggs well whisked. Mix lightly together and put it into a preserving-pan, and stir it over the fire until it is pretty hot. Then form it into small rolls, which are to be cut into slices; dust your hands with a little flower, and lay the cakes upon wafer or sugar papers ; slightly press them, sift pow- dered sugar upon them, and put them into a slow oven to harden. BISCUITS DE PRESBURG.* Make a light dough by mixing a pound of very dry flour with a tablespoonful of yeast and a teacup ful of luke-warm milk. When risen, rub in six ounces of butter, four eggs, and a little sugar. Bake this in the form of oblong cakes, similar to that of penny rolls, and when done, cut them into slices about an inch thick, and mask them with a rich almond icing. Eeplace them in the oven, which should be of a gentle heat, and let them remain to harden gradually.

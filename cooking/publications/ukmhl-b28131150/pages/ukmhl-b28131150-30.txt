In regard to home-made wines, we should at all times be very reluctant to place them before our convives, be the formerever so admirably comj)ounded, or the latter ever so indulgently disposed; for although Dr. Kitchener had a blind belief in tlie goodness of his choice red currant wine, we must not in this instance have the pretension of coping with him, but only sub- missively allow him to have been fully justified in praising and parading it, as it was manufactured under his own immediate supervision, and was pronounced, by the privileged few who tasted it, to be in every respect worthy of the well-acquired fame of the epi- curean oracle by whom it was recommended.

The ice-pot is preferable if made of pewter, and should be small enough to permit of being amply surrounded with ice when placed to stand in the pail. Having supplied yourself with this ap- paratus, get ready the cream or other composition you purpose iceing, and take all the materials into a cool, dry, airy, but not draughty room or cellar. Eoughly crush your ice, and add to it about a third of its weight of very dry salt or saltpetre; strew a tolerably thick layer of this mixture at the bottom of the pail, put your cream into the ice-pot, cover it down closely, place it in the pail, fill the latter with more pounded ice, and wrap a wetted woollen cloth round the outside. You should now turn the ice-pot round and round from right to left for ten minutes, then uncover it, and with a long-handled wooden spatula break down the crust of ice that adheres to the sides of the pot. Eesume the turning for some time longer; again stir the ice with the spatula, and continue in the same way until the preparation is per- fectly iced, when it should resemble the smoothness of butter. Observe, that as the ice melts away in the pail it should be renewed, and the liquid caused by its dis- solving should be let flow from the tap-hole below.

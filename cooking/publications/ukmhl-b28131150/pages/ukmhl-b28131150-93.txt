77 MAY. BISCUITS A LA. CANELLE.* Beat the whites and yolks of twelve eggs until they form a solid froth, add a teacupful of orange-flower, rose, or laurel w^ater, half an ounce of very flnely beaten cinnamon, a pound and a half of powdered and sifted loaf-sugar, and sufficient potato flour to make it into a paste. Boll it out rather thin, stamp it into biscuits of a fanciful form, put them upon greased paper, place them in a moderate oven, and when done and become cold glaze them highly, and return them to the mouth of the oven for a short time to set. CONFITURES 1 LA VALENCIENNE.* Take any kind of fruit that has been previously preserved in brandy, dry it upon a cloth, and dust it over with flour. Prepare an icing with the white of one egg beaten with enough sifted loaf-sugar to be sufficiently stifl"; dip into this each cherry, apricot, or plum, according to which you employ, holding the fruit by the stem during the process. Lay them carefully in a warm place to set; when firm arrange them in a dish amongst sprigs of myrtle, cypress, or any other suitable foliage. Should the fruit be not well covered it may be retouched with the icing. Presh fruits may be treated in a similar manner, but of course they will not keep long.

eveetbodtâ€™s desseet book. 158 orange juice and water, a little orange rind pared ex- ceedingly thin, and eight ounces of loaf-sugar. Lay in your fruit, and do it as slowly as possible; when it is perfectly tender, take it up, arrange it in a compo- tier, skim and reduce the syrup, allow it to cool, and pour it into the dish. COMPOTE DE PATE DE MAEEONS. Blancli a plateful of sweet chesnuts by first boiling them in water and peeling them, mash them to a paste, put them into a stewpan with half their weight of loaf-sugar and a wine-glass of Maraschino or white wine. Do them over the fire until the sugar is dis- solved, then either put them into a mould slightly oiled and turn them out when set, or pass them through a coarse sieve into your dessert-dish, that they may resemble a trifle. CANDIED MARMALADE.* Choose some very sound Seville oranges: take off the rinds, and boil them in plenty of water until they are soft. Pound them in a mortar, add the pulp and juice freed from the pips. Put all together into a preserving-pan, with twice the weight of loaf-sugar highly refined. Boil it for nearly three-quarters of an hour over a very slow fire. Put it into small moulds to keep.

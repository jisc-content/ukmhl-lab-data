4G everybody’s dessert book. there exist methods of easily transforming the four culinary cardinal commodities—eggs, flour, butter, and sugar—into such a multitude of agreeable Composi- tions. With a variety of “ petit four,” dried fruits, and confectionary (which we should take pleasure in preparing at home), we may always feel secure of dis- playing a dessert wortliy of any occasion, and enjoy the satisfaction of being able sometimes to dispense with such uncertainties as the fresh fruits of the sea- son, which are really less necessary to the success of our repasts than is supposed. Certainly, it will be urged by some, that home-made pastry and confec- tionary is seldom producible; I own this is too often the case, but if, in this respect, families more fre- quently made perfection their aim they would assuredly soon end by attaining it. 1.

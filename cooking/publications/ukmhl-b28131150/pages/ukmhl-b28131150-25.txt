LN'TEODTJCTION. 9 seldom seen at desserts, except chesnuts, wliich are served between a folded napkin ; oranges, also, may be heated slightly and sent to table in the same fashion, but it is not a commendable custom. Before ending, I must advert to the Continental habit of in- troducing the cheese with the dessert; whether this is a step forward in refinement, or the reverse, I will not attempt to decide, but as cheese is now so very rarely partaken of as an entremets, I really see no- thing against its being served with the sweets as it was in Shakspeare’s time; and, indeed, with all due respect for the merits of the most skilfully com- pounded confectionaxy, I side with Sir Boger de Co- verley in thinking that a day or a dinner is well ended which has been brought to a close with anything so excellently good as a “golden pippin and Cheshire cheese of the most mellow.” And now for the wines—a word about wines is always welcome.

Beat separately the yolks of twelve and the whites of four eggs, mix them together, add to them a wine- glassful of eau-de-vie. Pour in the sugar that you have just melted over the fire, beat it continually until almost cold, then stir in twelve ounces of dried flour. Put it into a buttered tin into which you have strewn a little powdered sugar, and bake it for a good hour. IMPERIAL RICE CAKE.* Put two ounces of whole rice to swell over the fire with half a pint of new milk; directly it comes to a boil retire it to the hob, and let it stand to absorb the milk. This done, pour it into a dish, and stir it occa- sionally until it is cold. Beat to a paste half a pound of blanched sweet almonds mixed with a spoonful of laurel water. "VVhisk the yolks of eight and the whites of four eggs, add to them two ounces of butter worked to a cream, the rasped rind of a lemon, and eight ounces of sifted loaf-sugar. Put in the almond paste, and then the rice, being careful that it is nicely granulated. Mix all well together, put it quickly into a hoop or mould, buttered and dusted with sugar; bake it for three-quarters of an hour in a moderate oven.

Currants may he done in bunches, if preferred; and later in the season bar- berries may be used; but fruit so served is not destined to be kept. FRESH FRUIT IN SALAD. Carefully pick any kind of ripe fruit from its stalks, place it in a dessert-dish, sprinkle it with a wine- glassful of white brandy, or vin de Champagne, and sift rolled white sugar over it. White or red currants, strawberries, white or red raspberries, barberries, cher- ries, or grapes are greatly improved when served in this way, especially if they do not happen to be thought sweet enough to be presented au naturel. GOOSEBERRY BISCUITS OR PASTE.* Take a quart of nearly mature gooseberries, add to them a pint of red-currant juice, place it over the fire in a preserving-pan, and as soon as the gooseberries are soft pass all through a sieve; put it again upon the fire, and reduce it until it is pretty thick; add an equal weight of loaf-sugar, stir it until the sugar is melted, then place the paste in thin trays, or moulds, and put them into a very slack oven to dry.

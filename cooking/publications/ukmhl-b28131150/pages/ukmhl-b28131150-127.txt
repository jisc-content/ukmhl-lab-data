Ill AUGUST. apricots. Prepare a strong syrup of sugar and water, throw in your melon, withdraw it from the fire, cover it down close, and let it remain some time to infuse; then let it come quickly to a boil, take it up, arrange it in your glass dessert-dish, skim and reduce the syrup, and when a little cooled pour it over the fruit. COMPOTE DE PRUNES. Take of any kind of ripe plums sufficient to make a good sized dish. If you purpose to have them stoned, remove the stone as carefully as you can from the stem end of the fruit. Should the plums be of a large kind they should be first scalded, and afterwards im- mersed in cold water; small fruit may at once be placed in an earthen pipkin with a syrup made with their weight of loaf-sugar, a wine-glassful of white brandy and enough water to float them in. Do them as slowly as possible, and as soon as they are tender place them in your compote dish, and pour over them the syrup when cooled. GREENGAGE MARMALADE.* Put your stoned fruit into a jar, and bake it until it will pulp easily. Pass it through a sieve, and to every pint of pulp add twelve ounces of fine loaf-sugar; boil it down until it is of the required thickness. Put it into small pots to keep.

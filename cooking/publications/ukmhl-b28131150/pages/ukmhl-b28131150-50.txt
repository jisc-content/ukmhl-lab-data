Then gradually add, first, twelve eggs previously beaten to a froth, then one pound of loaf-sugar powdered and sifted, and afterwards dredge in slowly twelve ounces of very good dry flour. When these ingredients are thoroughly mixed, put in b}'- degrees a pound of butter first beaten to a cream. A teaspoonful of grated lemon-rind may be also added if approved of. Place the cake in a good-sized mould, and bake it for an hour and a half.

Strew a little broken ice at the bottom of your pail; place your bottles upon it, surround them with ice to about three-quarters of their height, sprinkling a little common saltpetre amongst the ice as you put it in. At the end of five minutes carefully draw the corks from the wine and let it remain per- fectly still for rather more than an hour. Should you require it to be but slightly iced you may omit the salt- petre; but in either case it is unnecessary to move the bottles about during the process, as this would only destroy the clearness of the wine without ac- celerating its refrigeration.

Â« VIENNA CAKE * Take five or six slices of sponge-cake (made without the addition of spices), spread each slice with a dif- ferent kind of marmalade; place the slices one upon another, and cover the top and sides with a thick icing made with the whites of two eggs mixed with a pound of rolled sugar, and sufficient carmine to colour it of a beautiful pink. Let it set slowly in a warm place, but do not put it into an oven. PLAIN SEED CAKE.* Beat separately the yolks of six eggs and the whites of four; add six ounces of powdered loaf-sugar, a tablespoonful of brandy, a teaspoonful of caraway seeds, and six ounces of well-dried flour. Bake it in a buttered mould for half an hour, the oven being toler- ably brisk. BISCUITS SOUFFL^IS.* Take the whites of ten eggs, beat them to a snow, and add to them twelve ounces of powdered and sifted loaf-sugar, and three ounces of candied citron chips beaten to a paste in a mortar and moistened with white of egg ; or in place of the citron use an equal quantity of candied orange-flowers reduced to a paste. Make up your biscuits in paper cases, glaze the tops with sifted loaf-sugar, and bake in a slow oven for ten minutes.

FEBEUAET. 33 The more you work your ices the better they will be, but you should carefully take out the spatula each time after using it and replace the cover on the ice-pot. In making the “ glaces panachees,” or variegated ices, each colour requires to be first iced separately. Promages glaces are done in moulds, from which they are turned upon folded white napkins and sent imme- diately to table. Biscuits glaces requiring a particular kind of ma- chine for their execution, I have refrained from in- troducing. If you wish to thicken your cream before icing, make use of gum-arabic or any other vegetable gluten in preference to isinglass or animal substances of a similar nature, as it has been ascertained that com- positions in which the latter are contained will never ice properly. I would likewise counsel you to avoid using any of the freezing mixtures now so abundantly advertised; they are mostly combinations of noxious acids, which, during the course of the icing process, emit deleterious gas, that is both injurious to the health and destructive to the utensils with which it comes in contact.

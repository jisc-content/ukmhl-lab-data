MIXED MARMALADE.* Take a pint each of tlie pulp of red or white cur- rants, raspberries, cherries, and strawberries; add four pounds of highly refined loaf-sugar, and boil it gently for twenty minutes. Put it into glass moulds for use. Plums, pears, and apples in equal quantities first baked and afterwards pulped and boiled dowm together with sugar make an excellent marmalade ; the kernel of the plums may be blanched and added. APRICOT PASTE OR BISCUITS.* Stone some very ripe apricots, and put them into a preserving-pan with a small quantity of water; when they are tender, mash them well, pass them through a sieve ; weigh the pulp, and allow the same weight of the best loaf-sugar. Place it upon the fire, and stir it until it is very stiff, then place it in shallow tin moulds, or shape it into biscuits ; dust powdered sugar over, and dry slowly. MARMELADE DE PECHES.* Stone some ripe peaches, mash them, and pass them through a sieve. To every pound and a half of pulp add one pound of loaf-sugar ; put it into a preserving- pan, and simmer it till it is thick enough. Place it in pots or moulds, and cover with brahdied paper and wetted skin.

JUNE. 83 tLrougliout a ^vliole day. Probably a Briton would become a little lean under such a regimen, and I do not recommend bim to try it; but, as in this country olives are looked upon as genteel initiators of intoxi- cation, and people of any pretensions to propriety may scarce -with decency acknowledge a liking for them lest insobriety be inferred, I deem it advisable to remove the stigma that is attacked to tbeir reputa- tion, and hope my readers will feel fully satisfied that the fact of my thus declaring an attachment to olives is tantamount to my announcing myself to be a most irreproachably temperate person, right worthy to pro- pound moral precepts or culinary prescriptions for their mental edification or their bodily comforting. 1.

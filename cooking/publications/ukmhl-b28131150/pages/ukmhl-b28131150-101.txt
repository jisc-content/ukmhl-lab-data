JUNE. 85 COMPOTE DE PRAISES. Put together in a saucepan a teacupful of water, half a pound of loaf-sugar in powder, and half the white of an egg; when this has boiled pretty thick throw in a good pint of fresh ripe strawberries, picked from their stalks, but not bruised. Let them come to a boil, take them up with a strainer. Well skim the syrup, and when cold enough pour it into the dish with your fruit. Strawberries may also be done a Iâ€™im- proviste by arranging them in a compotier after they are carefully picked, and pouring on them a good thick syrup of white sugar boiled down with a little water, and not poured upon the strawberries till it is cold. COMPOTE DE CERISES. Put a pound of cherries into a stewpan, first stem- ming them and stoning them, if approved of; add half a pint of water, a teacupful of fresh raspberry juice, or cherry juice, strained through muslin, the juice of a lemon, and ten ounces of loaf-sugar. Let it come slowly to a boil, and directly the cherries are done take them up, arrange them in a glass dessert- dish, and gently simmer down the syrup, being careful to skim it. Let it cool a little, and pour it over the fruit. Serve when quite cold.

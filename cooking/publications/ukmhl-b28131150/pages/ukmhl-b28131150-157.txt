141 NOTEMBEE. Cryptagamia for the ornamentation of our epergnes. There are, even in England, plenty of evergreens to supply the deficiency of flowers; lustrous box, and cherry laurel, myrtle, Cyprus, bay, Eoman and Por- tugal laurel, cedar, aucuba, arbutus, ilex, &c.; and we must be destitute indeed if we cannot command the services of some of these to lend freshness to our fruit- baskets and variety to our flower-vases, instead of being forced to the expedient of using such perishable objects of attraction as ferns, though their employ- ment is, I own, fully sanctioned by custom. Before I leave the subject of dessert arrangements, allow me to counsel the discontinuance of the horrid practice of permitting the junior members of the family to invade the room immediately the dessert has been placed upon the table ; it is a signal for general discomfort; and to subject respectable adults to bo elbowed out of their positions and disturbed in the due possession of their particular appointments by a horde of small juveniles, is a misery and an injustice which the most infatuated of parents should avoid in- flicting upon the friends they pretend to entertain.

Jams are rarely presented at dessert, but marma- lades and moulded fruit jellies are quite admissible. Marmalade is the pulp of fruit, which is first deprived of its pips, &c., while jelly is only the clear juice, and jam the entire fruit bruised and boiled down with sugar. To the Portuguese is attributed the honour of discovering marmalade, and quinces are said to be the fruit which first enjoyed the dignity of transformation into that excellent composition, hence the name mar- melade, from marmela, the Portuguese for quince. In the face, however, of this satisfactory derivation no printing-house authorities will allow me to spell or publish the word otherwise than marmalade, although I have repeatedly tried my best eflbrts to promote the original method of orthography.

noiuxc; of salt-water or sea fish 515 called tepid. Small fish, or relatively small slices of fish, may be thrown into boiling water, just as well as into boiling fat for frying, and become well done; but larger fish, or more voluminous pieces of fish, should be put into tepid, relatively cold water, so that they may be penetrated by the beat gradually, and cooked equally throughout, and not overdone on the outside before the inside has begun to be set. For the same reason here set forth, the vessel in which fish is to be boiled must in a certain measure be pro- portionate in size to the fish to be boiled, for failing this, the other conditions of success, particularly that concerning the minimum quantity of fluid, cannot be maintained; the cook should, therefore, have at least two fish-kettles of different sizes at his disposal; each kettle should be pro- vided with a strainer^ of perforated tin, with supports, by means of which it can be kept raised above the water. For when the fish is done, but its dishing is delayed, it should not be left in the water, but raised out of it on the strainer, and kept merely steanied, with the lid of the kettle on. On account of this difficulty of keeping boiled fish without deterioration, Kitchiner advises cooks, when they have large dinners to prepare for uncertain guests, to fry or stew their fish instead of boiling it; they would, he Says, get more credit by it, and the carving would be easier. Fish cannot be too fresh for any purpose of the kitchen. The Dutch are as nice about this point in the present day as the Romans, according to Seneca, were in the past; the most fastidious would not eat fish unless it were cooked upon the same day that it was taken, that it might taste of the sea, as they expressed it. We can fully confirm that fish loses much of its original taste by being kept even on ice. So strong is this taste of fresh fish, that persons not accustomed to it, or not acquainted with the fact, have been known to object to it, and urban fishmongers have assured Kitchiner that very fresh fish now and then put them in

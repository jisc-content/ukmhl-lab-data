THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 334 chalk and gypsum, or carbonate and sulphate of lime. Dis- tilled water is the best. Eain water and river water may be used in places; but when there is hard water only avail- able, it should be softened by being boiled for half an hour, with the addition of a small quantity of carbonate of soda, a lump of the size of a filbert being sufficient for a quart of water. Further, the soaking of the beans must be effected during a sufficiency of time, not less than eight hours, and preferably overnight—f.e., during from twelve to eighteen hours. The stewing then becomes an easy process. Broth or standard solution of meat essence should always be added, as well as some butter; and the sauce surrounding the haricots at the conclusion of the coction should only just'be sufficient to moisten them, be bound with them, and not flowing. With these precautions rigorously en- forced, haricot beans are a tasty, agreeable savory—in short, an elegant dish, and easily digestible; they are also highly nutritious, and accessible by their price to all people who cook. The ripe beans of all varieties of Phaseolus contain only 13’6 per cent, of water; 23T2 per cent, of nitrogenized matters (of these nearly half, 11 per cent., is legumin); 2'28 per cent, of fat; materials free from nitrogen, mainly starch, 53’63 per cent.; woody fibre, 3‘84 per cent.; in- organic matter, as ash, 3'53 per cent. Turnips. The Uirnip belongs to the genus Brassica, of the family of cruciferous plants. There are several species of Brassica; e.g., the B. campestris, L., much grown for the production of oil, and, by a corruption of the German name Eohlsaat, called colza. The Brassica rapa, L., similarly yields rape- oil from its seed ; but its root, unlike that of the former, is eaten. The most important species are the B. olcracea, with all its varieties of cabbage, and the one here to be

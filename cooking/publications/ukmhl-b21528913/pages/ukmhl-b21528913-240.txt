212 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY mixed (falsely alleged to be made of mule’s flesh), and sold throughout Spain; their flavour is good, but they are very hard and tough. Others add a piece of bacon {tocino) or of ham {javion), which introduces a sufficiency of the fatty element besides flavour. This stew, for service at the table, is placed in a large dish, and sometimes garnished with fried or poached eggs. The gravy, concentrated and tasty, is eaten with sippets of white bread. It is easily seen that the alia is only a more complicated form of the puchero. Kriisch describes tbe olla when just served on the table as looking like a mountain, surrounded by depository strata, breccias, and nests of alluvial forma- tion ; the gigantic ‘ steert-piece ’ of beef is the central basal granite, round which the rings of chorizos alternate with the savoury herbs, and descend to the foot, where garbangos represent the rolled boulders. Such an olla requires large arrangements, great dexterity of the cook, and a numerous assembly to do justice to so large a collection of prime food; and for this reason the olla is not by any means a national dish, not even a popular dish, but one reserved for the use of large establishments on special occasions. The puchero, however, can be made in all pro- portions, and with any additions which accident or a well-supplied market offers, and which may suit any income and any tongue. In France this dish is termed oille, and seems to have been as national as puchero is in Spain, although its origin in Spain is not questioned; it was a substantial ragout soup at the time of Louis XIII., whose cooks, with their con- temporaries, termed it grand otiille; it is the ouille au pot mentioned in the letters of Madame de Maintenon. The veritable olla has never been much used in France, but in the establishment of the Spanish "Ambassador at Paris the ragout formed part of the diplomatic representa- tion and the official ceremonial.

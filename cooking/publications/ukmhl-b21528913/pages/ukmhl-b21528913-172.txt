144 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY Voltaire, that it was made without jus, is to some extent erroneous. Veal Gravy-Broth, or Blond de Veau. Butter the bottom of a stewpan, put in some slices of ham, 4 lb. or 5 lb. of veal, well minced, a couple of wild rabbits, two carrots and onions, and let all sweat over a mild fire; add a pint of standard broth, and reduce by- boiling to the state of glace ; when it has a nice yellow colour remove it from the fire ; moisten again with standard broth (grand bouillon); now add parsley, shallots (half a clove of garlic), two cloves ■, boil, skim, remove grease, pass through a tammy, and use the blond as you would empotage for rice, vermicelli, and sauces, such as Espagnole, and even for excellent soup. French magiric authors do not prescribe mincing the veal, but order the cook to prick the slices, after the glace is obtained, to let out all the juice which they contain ■,* this very imperfect mode of extracting the veal we have super- seded by mincing and pressing it. t Veal-Broth, Plain and Meagre, with Rice or Vermicelli. Stew a knuckle of veal in about a gallon of water, to which put 2 oz. of rice or vermicelli, a little salt, and a blade of mace. When the meat has become thoroughly boiled, and the liquid reduced to about one half, it may be sent to table, with or without the meat. Ignotus,t the magiric physician, recommends this simple broth to be used by all persons who are in the habit of indulging in rich soups (a danger not nowadays often to be apprehended) and highly-spiced dishes, to give their digestive organs an occasional relaxation. -* Cf.

OBJECTS AND RESULTS OF COOKER) elaboration. It is based upon the broadest foundation of common food-resources, applying all which are available, without refusing refined delicacies or inversely attributing to them exaggerated importance. Distinction between the Nutritive and .^sthetical Value of Food as illustrated by ‘ Bread and Cake.’ In accordance with the foregoing, we may give as the widest definition of the objects of cookery the preparation of food in such a manner that man shall derive the greatest nutritive and asthetical advantage from its consumption. Inversely, the results of cookery demonstrate the fact of the arising of these advantages out of the practice of cookery, if, indeed, these results were not originally the main agent in effecting its systematic development. It would be an interesting study to follow hypothetically the progress of the earliest attempts of man to modify natural food by fire. The earliest man must necessarily have been a carnivore, and have eaten the game and fish which he killed in a raw state. As soon as he had invented the art of making fire at will, accident or experiment would show him the advan- tages of grilling meat before the fire, particularly such as would require to be rescued from the frozen state. He would have learned quickly how to braise fish upon the hot ashes of a nearly extinct wood fire, without the inter- vention of any implement of stone or earthenware what- soever.* When he had advanced to the manufacture of earthemoare vessels, man could boil and fry his meat, and add thereto such vegetables and fruit as experience would show him to be eatable. Cereals and leguminosce, which palaeontologists tell us were eaten by some early men, even pre-Saxon inhabitants of England, in the unshelled and * This is practised in the present time in many parts of Portugal, in Lisbon before the doors of the houses of the wage-earning class, and before and in the taverns frequented by labourers.

THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 374 which is a mixture of boiled comminuted potatoes (in this process termed fruit) with yeast and some flour-paste; this mixture freshens up the yeast and makes'it ready to sprout. When mixed with the flour for the production of the ‘ sponge,’ the soluble starch is at once converted into sugar, and fermentation begins rapidly. Then the sponge is mixed with the whole amount of flour, and the process is repeated. The final or third main panification takes place in the loaf in the oven, when the temperature of the dough rises to that point which is most favourable to diastatic action; the sugar is again as quickly destroyed by the yeast, and after a short time all ferments are destroyed by the heat. In this process hardly ever any excess of sugar is formed by the diastase, none is ever in the bread. Now, it is quite clear that the addition to the dough of fermentable sugar, such as maltose or inverted sugar, must efi'ect the same object as that which is attained by the addition of soluble starch, and must accomplish it in a much shorter time. In each variety of grain there are several albuminoids occurring side by side, and almost every kind of grain seems to possess at least one albuminoid, perhaps several albu- minoids, by which it is distinguished from other varieties of grain. Wheat-flour made into a dough with water, placed in a canvas bag and kneaded, parts with its starch, and leaves gluten in the bag; this is a plastic, tough mass, which can be drawn out like shoemaker’s pitch; it imparts to wheat - flour dough that peculiar tenacity which it exhibits best in the manufacture of macaroni — without gluten no macaroni; it also imparts to dough that more gentle cohesion which enables it to retain the little bubbles of carbonic acid produced by fermentation, and helps their shape to be fixed by the baking process; it is thus the prime agent in the production of that sponginess which makes bread so digestible and so suitable for the most varying impregnations.

THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 4i8 (these tartlets may be beautifully made; the recipes for them are almost repetitions of those for the puits d’amour); ci'pple tartlets, covered with a lattice-work of thin puff paste (misnamed by careless authors a mosaic of paste, a special board for producing such lattice-work being also misnamed a 7nosaic board). Parisian Loaves may be defined as ornamented encaustic finger biscuits, and are curious by their complicatiou, which may be characterized as the application of the admonition, Stick it on / The metaphorically ‘ encaustic ’ part consists of ‘ narrow strips ’ of currant jelly, greengage jam, etc. Cherry Tartlets are highly artistic preparations.

THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 384 Yeast or Sponge DwngAings are made with a fermented dough containing milk, eggs, butter, salt, and flour. They require boiling for half an hour, and are eaten with roast meat, fish, or compote. Great care must be taken to make them spongy by cautious selection of the yeast and vigilance over the conditions of the rising. Braised Buns (in Germany called Dampfnudeln), or Steam Noicilles, consist of a well-raised rich dough, baked in a pan in a shallow bath of milk, in an atmosphere of overheated steam. They thus are hroioned at the bottom and the top, and surrounded by a white ring, where the milk protected them from radiation. The dumplings are a remarkable illustration of the difference between conducted bottom heat, which browns them from below, radiated heat, which browns them from above, and condiicted diffused heat, which, in the shape of, or attached to, steam from the milk, causes them to rise, in the first instance above the level of the milk in which they are immersed. The white soft rim correspond- ing to the surface of the milk enables the dumpling to rise even after its convex top as well as its flat under surface has been browned. Braised buns have, therefore, for a cook great theoretical interest, and their production requires no small amount of skill and a good oven. They are the result as well as the transmitters of much culinary philo- sophy. Saxon Green Dumplings fried are an ancient sweet dish, the recipe for which was preserved in the family of Baron von Miilbacher, quondam Saxon Ambassador at Paris. Its antiquity is also testified by the fact that expressed juice of tansy is one of the ingredients. The green colour is pro- duced by spinach. Small Dumplings for Soup are produced from a paste of butter, yolk, flour, salt, and spice, and ladled into boiling broth. Almond and Currant Dumplings are a sweet dish, and.

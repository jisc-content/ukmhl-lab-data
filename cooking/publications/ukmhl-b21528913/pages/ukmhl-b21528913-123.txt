95 AROMATIC AND SHARP SUBSTANCES Saffron, pistils of Crocus sativus; almost obsolete. An Arabic name for saffron is Gamma, said by Herat and Delens to have been corrupted to CiLmma, but this is doubtful, as the Hindostanee name for Curcuma is Quoorm, the turmeric above quoted, and not saffron. Fourth Group : Parts of Cruciferous and Composite Plants with Sharp Oil. Miistard, seed of Sinapis nigra and alba, L. Tarragon, leaves of Artemisia clrac^^nculus sativus; Fr. Esdragon; Germ. Traganth. Anis, seed of Pimpinella anisum, L. Cara^vay, or cummin-seed, from Garum Carui, L. ; Gr. Karon, Arab. Karaioia. The form ciimmin occurs in Greek as Kyminon, Germ. Kiimmel. The Germans use this seed as a flavouring for brandy, cheese, bread, and cabbage. In England it is used as a flavouring for an excellent kind of cake, called seed-cake. Coriander, seeds of Coriandrum sativum, L., are usedâ€”e.g., in curry (Kari), but must be grilled before use to expel a strong and disagreeable oil. The leaves of the plant are also used for marinades. Horseradish, root of Gochlearia Armoracea, Germ. Meer- rettig, is eaten raw in flakes obtained by scraping or grating, or grated and boiled in sauce ; - contains a sulphuretted crystallizable oil. Its French names are Grand Baifort, Gran, Gran de Bretagne. From this fourth group we pass by galgant, parsley, celery, etc., gradually into the domain of green condiments, such as onions, garlic, leek, etc., which also contain a stdphurous oil, like mustard and horseradish. But these will be treated of under the chapter relating to vegetables used for soups, sauces, and entremets, and are not included under the condiments described in the present chapter.

Devil's Sauce is espaguole flavoured with shallots, viuegar, and hot spices. Gravy Sauce for Boast Veal is really gravy thickened with roux and flavoured with mushrooms. Finished White Sauces derived from Velout4. Besides b6chamel and allemande sauce, there are a number of sauces derived from veloute, the specificity of which is obtained by the addition of flavours or fumets. Some of these are parallels to brown sauces, and bear the principal names of these, with the difference only of that particular part of the name which indicates that they are derived from white sauce. Italian Sazice is velout6 varied and flavoured by shallots, mushrooms, and olive-oil, the latter probably suggesting the name. Fines Herbes Sauce contains mushrooms, shallots, and parsley. Pascaline or IVhite Mushroom Sauce is veloute with minced mushrooms. D’Uxelles Sauce is a stiff mince of mushrooms, truffles, herbs, and scraped bacon, with egg-yolks and veloute, for covering entrees previous to their being crumbed and fried. It is named after the Marquis d’Uxelles, perhaps by his cook, the celebrated culinary author De la Varenne. It is improperly called a sauce. Bed Tomato Sauce is veloutd with tomatoes. Norman Matelote or Seaman's Sauce, a parallel to the brown, contains mushrooms, wine, mussels, and oysters.

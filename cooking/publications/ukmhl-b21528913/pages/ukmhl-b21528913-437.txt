GENOISES, MADELEINES, AND PETITS CHOUX 409 tions from \X\q 2:>lciin: namely, with almonds, small (in ‘ Dons de Comus ’ it is said that the smaller the g^noises the better they are), orange-flavoured; with pistachios; with filberts; but the French genoiscs perUes au raisin de Corinthe, which are to have single currants as a top-dressing on the glace, are really examples of trifling with so-called ornament, and literally childish play. Madeleines are cakes of great reputation in France, related to g6noises, and made with the same kind of batter as these ; they are produced plain and with variations. The Made- leines of Commercy had a special local reputation, the con- sequence mainly, it was reported, of the admiration which the Polish King Stanislas Leezinsky manifested for them when he travelled in France; but this local reputation was more probably the result of the accident that a Madame Perrotin de Barmond had a cook who baked very good madeleines, and as her names happened to be Madeleine Paumier, she was credited locally, and quite unduly, with the invention of the cakes. Variations are effected by additions of dried fruit, angelica, all of which in our opinion detract from the specificity of the cakes. This specificity has a fixed basis, for, as in English poxhnd cake, the three principal ingredients of madeleines—flour, sugar, and butter —are added in equal parts. Choux Patissiers, or Petits Ghoux, are cakelets baked of a batter previously boiled, like the batter of soufllds. There is no English equivalent for the name, except the perhaps jocular shoes’ of some English cooks be accepted as such. The French name choux may be derived from a similarity in shape to certain round cabbages. Several varieties are made: h la Parisicnne; p>ains d la duchesse, which has been translated into Duchess loaves ; profit rolles; and Mecca loaves, or Mecca cakes. Tlie p)roflt rolles are hollow, and filled with some kind of custard from the top, through an opening of the size of a slhlling, cut witli a

THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 6o and saucers for mixing or holding small quantities of liquid; six and three soicp plates ; two larger and two small dishes; two small basins, to serve under the wire covers already described. Most of this crockery wmuld be kept mainly in the larder. A cupboard with shelves, to be locked by a key, should be at the command of the cook. The apparatus for lueighing and measuring should com- prise : A spring steel-yard weighing up to 150 lb. A balance or eigliing-machine copahle of weighing parcels, joints, etc., up to 21 lb., turning at less than half an ounce. A balance capable of weighing quantities from 2 lb. down to a drachm, and turning with a grain. A set of weights in iron or brass, avoirdupois, from 211b. downwards. A set of lueights in bi'ass only, for the second fine balance. A set of kilogram weights from 1 kilo down to 1 gram will be a great convenience for comparison, or for the prac- tical execution of French recipes. Of meastires of capacity there should be a wooden bushel and its subdivisions ; a gallon, piMrt, pint, and gill measure of copper, tin, p>eivter, or of glass, verified. There should be a good clock in the kitchen, with a large dial and conspicuous hands, and it should be kept in good order and well regulated. The toashing of the kitchen utensils, dishes, and plates is to be done in xoooden vessels only. Supply crystallized washing soda, and a sufficiency of cloths for wiping the apparatus dry ; insist upon the cloths being dried, and kept dry after use, or upon being changed to avoid the greasy or soapy flavour of over-used unclean moist cloths, which easily adheres to dishes and plates. Make an inventory of the property ; register in this, and hand over to the cook, only such apparatus as is entire and perfect for use. Mark chips; do not count any cracked

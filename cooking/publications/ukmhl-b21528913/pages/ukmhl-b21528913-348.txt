THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 320 250 years; it is a most excellent and useful vegetable, available early in spring and summer, and late in autumn ; of an intensely green colour, and very fine flavour, which amalgamates well with that of batter and gravy; it con- tains a little mlt of sorrel, which is tasted as a slight astringency, or as edging tender teeth; some cooks increase this acidity by the addition of a little sorrel. On the Continent it is served with fried or poached eggs. Children and young persons sometimes have a dislike to it, which pedagogic zeal endeavours to eradicate by rigour; this should be avoided, as time and age are sure to transform the dislike into respect, and even affection. Some German recipes, instead of adding sorrel, pre- scribe to dissolve a little carbonate of soda in the water in which spinach is to be boiled; this must be objected to. Others flavour spinach with braised onion and bind it with a roux; this is destructive of the fine flavour of spinach. Most gastronomers prefer well-boiled and X^ressed, and finely-hacked, spinach with a dressing of little butter, or much butter, or with some gravy, or glace, or coulis, and with fried or poached eggs, and some croutons. The French like spinach with much butter, a fact which the authoress ‘ Cordon Bleu ’ illustrated by the following anecdote : A dignitary of the French Church, Canon Chevrier, in order to enjoy his dish of spinach on Friday, had it cooked on the previous Sunday, and warmed up every day, more butter being daily added to it. She also says that, owing to the large quantity of butter re- quired by spinach, the French called it la, viort ait heurre. In England spinach is naturally so constituted that it requires and bears only moderate additions of butter. Some French gastronomers, in a mood of affected pleasantry, have termed spinage le balai de Vestomac— some because of its facile digestibility, others on account of its assumed slight nutritious value.

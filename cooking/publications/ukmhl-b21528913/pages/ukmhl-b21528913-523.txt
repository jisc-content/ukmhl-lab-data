GREEN GEESE AND CYGNETS 495 Geese are most suited for culinary purposes during the time from the second week in June to the first in Sep- tember, In the Italian restaurants in London, half-grown geese (goslings) are served up as duck. A March goose gastronomers declare to be insii^id, a Michaelmas goose Tank. Geese are called gfccn till they are about four months old; such geese are yet used as second course roasts. The amateurs of these ‘ insipid premature pro- ductions ’ do not allow them to be flavoured with sage and onions. Cygnets, or young sivans, are used much as geese are. The early inhabitants of the Thames Valley probably feasted on the large black swan and his smaller white contemporary, of which bones are found in alluvial deposits. At present swans are no longer game with us, but must be reared in captivity. They are very prolific, and we have seen families of as many as nine cygnets on the protected and secluded waters of a park thirty miles distant from London. At Norwich, along with colossal herds of geese, cygnets are also reared, and are ready for the m'arket in September. The cygnet is a dish of considerable size and weight, and requires some special facilities for cooking. It is prepared and trussed like goose, and receives a shiffing of which 3 lb. of minced rumpsteak is an essential ingredient; it is then wrapped in oiled paper, water-paste, paper again, and roasted like venison ; this package requires at least four hours’ roasting before a large fire, on the spit. It has to be frequently basted with butter, and ultimately frothed with butter and flour. It would be far preferable to bake the cygnet in a good oven. Cygnets, like wild geese, early assume an oily taste; this can be mitigated only by marinading and roasting before a free fire. Goose Liver may be prepared in the well-known Strass- burg manner, or in jelly; or it may be crimhed and fried, or ]}lain-fried.

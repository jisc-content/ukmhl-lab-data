THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 122 overloaded, over-spiced, over-onioned, and over-complicated dishes to simpler compositions, and to cause them to look to the selection of the material and the preservation of its individuality as the first condition of aesthetical food-pre- paration. Simplidcation is still required even in establish- ments managed on highly cultivated principles ; for, as an example, to carefully take all grease out of a consomme by clarification, and then to pour back into it both grease and turbidity in the shape of cream, just before sending it to table, seems overwrought, if not contradictory. On the whole, such ultimate and snatch-admixtures, in the shape of sauces, cream, milk, wine, to gravy-soups, appear to us to Ido bad traditions from times when the thinness of broth required hiding by spicy and distracting additions. The Principal Constituents of Meat as Sources of Culinary Educts. The savoury extract of meat, which after exposure to high temperature forms the osmazome of brown gravy, is contained in the little cylindrical bags of the muscles which hold the discs or fibres of contractile substance. It may be either the matter from which the coutractile matter takes its nutriment, or it may be matter already used for con- traction, and destined next to be used for heat production ; or it may be a mixture of such matters. They have some distant similarities to the substances produced from white of egg, fibrin, syntonin, etc., by digestion; they are alkaloids by their reaction, and toeak acids at the same time. By this chemical function, which pronounces them to belong to a class of bodies having powerful effects upon the nervous system, these bodies are distinguished from the more neutral substances of the soluble albuminous series. The main substance of the muscle or flesh considered as an organ and as food is muscle fibrin or syntonin, the con- tractile matter just mentioned. This by itself is as taste-

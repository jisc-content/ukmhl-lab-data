‘J'HIl SPIRU OF COOKERY 5iS bones, rubbing it on both sides with spices, finely-shred herbs, and salt; rolling it up as tightly as possible, tying it securely with broad tape, putting a collaring cloth around it, placing it in a saucepan in which there is a boiling liquor composed of equal parts of water or standard broth and vinegar, spiced with bay-leaves, sweet herbs, and salt. Simmer all very slowly until the fish be done, then take the latter out and let it cool in the cloth, in case you do not want it for immediate service; reduce the liquor by boiling, strain it, and when it is cold pour it over the fish, or instead of this you may give a separately made piquant sauce with it. From many of the recipes concerning the preparation of fish given in culinary treatises, the addition of the element of savoitr derived from meat has been omitted, except in sauces and mireiMix. This deficiency, easily discovered by an ex- perienced taste, the authors of the treatises have attempted to make up for by a forcible and profuse addition of wane and spirit, a counterpart to the absurdity of the bouillon of the faisan Lucullus. Thus, in a modern culinary treatise, W'e find the following recipe for Coitrt Bordllon, which is translated ‘ Sauce Court Bouillon ’: ‘ Fill a fishpan nearly to the brim with white wine, a wineglassful of brandy, the same quantity of sherry, and “ season ” with salt, pepper, two “heads” of cloves, “a head” of garlic, sliced onions, carrots, turnips, parsnips, celery, chervil, parsley, a bayleaf, thyme, and “a lump” of fresh butter. Boil over a quick fire till reduced a third [this means, probably, by a third to a residue of two-thirds]; if the wine catches fire, it will greatly improve the flavour of the sauce. When used for cooking fish, see that the court bouillon is boiling before putting it (the fish) in, and have sufficient to cover the fish entirely.’ Two-thirds of a fishpan full of reduced court bouillon is a large volume of liquid to be worked into a ‘ sauce ’; but this proposition does not impose upon us, as, the translated

MUTTON-BROTHS J45 Mutton-Broth. General Observations.—On account of the somewhat pro- nounced flavour of some sorts of mutton, the broth made from that kind of meat is not so frequently used for the pro- duction of savoury dishes as beef. But the glace, or essence, or extract of mutton is even more savoury, and withal more refined, than extract of beef. But it is not so extensively brought into trade, simply because the production of essence of beef is somewhat cheaper than that of essence of mutton. What is called Scotch mutton-broth is not a simple broth such as we are here discussing, but an expanded ragout of mutton chops or cutlets with barley and turnips. As Scot- land is the country where sheep thrive better than else- where, mutton is there such a constant household article of nutrition that Scotch broth is made to signify Scotch nmtton broth. It is also proper that mutton should be accompanied not only with barley, which is the principal cereal now grown in Scotland, and in its southern counties shares the arable surface with turnips, but also with hirnips, upon which sheep have to live for a part of their existence, and from which they derive a part of the flavour of their meat. Recipe.—Trim a neck of mutton as for cutlets, and cut it into cutlets ; pare away all superfluous skin and excess of fat, and yellow elastic tissue or neck ligament; place the cutlets in a stewpan with the outer part of two carrots, three turnips, two leeks, an onion, and a head of celery—all vegetables cut into very small dice. Have ready two quarts of mutton-broth, or standard beef-broth, and pour it over the cutlets; add 6 oz. of Scotch barley, previously par- boiled. Boil the whole until the mutton, vegetables,. and barley are properly cooked. Use salt sparingly, remove fat from the top of the broth, and point it with some chopped and blanched parsley.

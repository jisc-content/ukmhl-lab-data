SCORZONIiRA OR SALSIFIS 3’9 containing much, asparcujin, a body which bears its name from having been originally discovered in asparagus-roots and shoots in 1805 by Vauquelin and Eobiquet. This nitrogenized substance is found in many plants at different stages of their development, most abundantly in young shoots of Leguminosse, e.cj., beans, peas, and vetches. The scorzonera may be termed the autumnal or wintry asparagus ; for although it is a root, and not a shoot, it resembles the asparagus much by its chemical ingredients ; in flavour, however, it differs again from it. It contains about 80 per cent, of water, 1 per cent, of nitrogenous matter, 0-5 per cent, of fat, 2-2 per cent, of sugar, 12-6 per cent, of other non-nitrogenized matter, 2-3 per cent, of woody fibre, and 1-0 per cent, of ash. It is a cichoraceoiis plant; its name salsifis is of uncertain derivation, but that of scorzonera (or escorzonera) comes from the Spanish scurzon, a viper, and the plant bears the adjective hisjMiiica. Its early second year’s leaves, grown in the cellar, can be eaten as salad. However intended to be used, the roots have always to Ije scraped and placed in water to which some vinegar and flour have been added. This prevents the milk-juice con- tained in the roots from becoming dark by contact with the air. Cut the roots lengthways in four if they be thick, in two if they be thinner, and all in lengths of about an inch and a half. The scorzonera should never be boiled in water, but always stewed in a savoury coulis*. The French eat salsifis prepared with cream, or in fricassee, or fried in hatter. Spinach, or Spinage. This plant passes in France by the plural dpinards; in Germany it is called Spinat. It came from Persia, where it grows wild, and has been cultivated in Europe for about

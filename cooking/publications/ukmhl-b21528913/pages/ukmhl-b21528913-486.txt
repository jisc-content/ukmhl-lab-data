THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 45S Put it iuto a stowpan with water, and boil it with some vegetables. To make Sheep’s Head Soup), a magiric authoress directs the head to be boiled with five quarts of water and ^ lb. of pearl barley. But the sheep’s head requires four hours of boiling, and if it be large over four and a half. It is laborious as well, and of the product the only part worth eating is the tongue. The price of a ready-boiled salted sheep’s tongue is fourpence in London. The sheep’s head, less the tongue, is sold for sixpence. Therefore the nutri- ment contained on a sheep’s head altogether costs ten- pence, raw, or more than the price of ^ lb. of good rump- steak. Kitchiner endeavoured to improve the dish by directing that there was to be left with the head four inches of the craig, or neck, of the sheep; he also added the singed and cleaned feet; he abandoned the brain, as the head was to be rubbed over with it after it had been singed and scraped. All was then to be boiled in good beef- broth, or, failing that, in water. We do not think that sheep’s head is under any circumstances at all an economical dish, unless head, pluck, and trotters can be obtained at a nominal price or for nothing. Neither should we say so much about it were it not that in certain schools of cookery the pupils are introduced to their sub- ject by a preparation of sheep’s head. This is erroneous in more than one respect, as all will acknowledge who read what we have said above on the subject of sheep’s head soup. Sheep’s Head may be baked, roast, braised, in a plain state or stuffed, and steioed, but then the necessary additions make it at once more expensive. The most practical form is the Galimafre of Head ami Pluck, a well-flavoured ragout; the mince of liver and heart gives it substantial foundation. Sheep’s Heart may be stuli'ed and braised, and is suitable,

63.S TFIE SPIRIT OF COOKER) CHAPTEB LIX. THE PHILOSOPHY OF DINNERS AND OF DINING. At various periods the ordar of dinners and feasts has been made the subject of social conventions. We have seen in the chapter on the historical literature of cookery that at the great dinners of the time of the Renaissance almost every dish constituted ‘ a course,’ and as there were from twelve to sixty dishes, a dinner lasted many hours. Sub- sequently dinners became agreeably simplified, the courses were subordinated to ‘ services,’ and the services were re- duced in number, first to four, then to three, and it is now proposed to confine a dinner to two so - called services.

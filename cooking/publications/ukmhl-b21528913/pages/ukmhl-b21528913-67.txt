THE HISTORIC LITERATURE OF COOKERY 39 wei’6 rendersd. After the fall of Bonaparte, upon whose culinary agents he, having from his business associa- tions strong Legitimist leanings, occasionally published jealous criticisms, he arranged for the restored Bourbons the gigantic banquet in the Plain of Virtues in 1814, and directed the table of the Emperor Alexander of Russia at Paris in 1814 and 1815, and subsequently at the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle. He was one of the chiefs of the kitchen of the Regent, afterwards George IV., at Brighton in 1816 and 1817, and again for a short period on a later occasion. Travelling to Vienna to arrange some grand dinners for the Austrian Emperor, he became chef of the kitchen of the then English Ambassador to that monarch. Careme ulti- mately resided at Paris, from which town no inducement could draw him for long, following his literary inclination, and died there in 1833 before having completed the fiftieth year of his life. Under Richaut, the celebrated saucier of the house of Conde, he learned the working of the sauces; during the great fetes given at the H6tel-de-Ville at Paris, under the direction of L’Asne, he acquired the practical knowledge concerning ornamented cold dishes; at the Elysee Bourbon, under the management of Robert and Laguepierre, he learned, as he terms it, the elegance of the modern kitchen, and the ensemble of a great administra- tion. He was thus well qualified to be an exponent of the sumptuous banqueting magirism, and contributed not a little to increase the luxury and expense of social entertain- ments in all parts of the civilized world. Autodidact of great ability, yet without fundamental philosophical culture, he used titles for some of his disquisitions which cover a much greater field than the contents of his chapters. Thus, in the ‘ Parallel of the Ancient and Modern Cookery,’ the adjective ‘ ancient ’ does not apply, as one would expect, to the times of the Greeks and Romans or Egyptians, but only to the cookery of the past parts of the eighteenth century

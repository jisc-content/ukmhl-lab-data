THE PROCESS OF FRYING, OR PHRYGOLOGY 2S9 flavoured. Of smelt the culinary professor says incidentally that it was ‘ the becfigue of the waters, the same small size, the same perfume, the same superiority.’ Probably as a contrast, or with a view of restoring his impaired reputation, Maitre Laplanche prepared an immense fried turbot, and thereby, says his master, ‘ astonished the universe. ’ It is stated that olive-oil does not bear to be heated as highly as butter, lard, and kidney fat, or suet, as it assumes an empyreumatic taste. But in the absence of precise ther- mometric data, the practical importance of this difference cannot be estimated; it shows the empirical character of cookery, that the temperature of fats used for frying has never been ascertained with the thermometer by cooks themselves. French cooks distinguish practically two degrees of heat at which things may be fried—one yields the fritiire chaude, and may be termed very hot fat; the other yields the friture mod&rie, and may be called medium hot fat. (The French also use the word friture for the frying material, the fat itself, although its natural meaning is that of the fried article.) The very hot fat is recognised by a little bread causing in it small ebullition, and then becoming surrounded by large bubbles; while the medium hot fat causes small effervescence only, and no large bubbles. When the fat begins to be overheated, a more or less dense cloud of vapour appears over its surface, and spreads a disagreeable, penetrating, and adhesive odour. The best heat for frying is about 210° to 220° of the Centi- grade thermometer; at that temperature frying is effected in the shortest time, and the product absorbs the least amount of fat. The matters lohich are fried at temperatures of from 150° to 160° absorb the largest amount of fat {Dubrunfaut). 19

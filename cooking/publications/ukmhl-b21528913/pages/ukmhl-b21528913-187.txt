SOUP OF JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES i59 Gompound Onion Soups.—They are many in number) and are produced by the addition of other vegetables, such as mushrooms, which supply savour, turnips and celery—compound onion soup uu cjrcis or uu muiyie, brown j or by substituting millc for broth, bean decoction, or water—onion soiip loith milk, or onion soiip with milk and eggs, in which the eggs are used as a final leeson (liaison) of all the ingredients; a soup also termed Homeric soiop, is a near approach to the soup of the heroes described in the Iliad. There is the soiop of white onions, for which the small white bulbs yield the material, to be made with croiltes it, pot, or gratinated crusts, and a little sugar. This must not be confounded with white soup of onion, for which the bulbs are par- boiled in water, then completely cooked in bouillon, either standard or fresh made; add to the soup 2 oz. of siceet almonds, which have been blanched, pounded, and diluted with milk; further, the puree of four hard-boiled yolks of eggs, and some panade made with bouillon ; spice with tincture of pepper, and pour over chips of fried bread. Topinambur Soup—Soitp of Jerusalem Artichokes.— This is a soup made with the puree of the tubers of the topinambur plant. When this 'vegetable was brought to Europe from South America, it was termed sicnflower or girasol, from its similarity to the true sunflower, Helianthus annuus. The name girasol, which was to indicate the erroneous supposition that the flower was always turned to the sun, and gyrated with its rise and sinking, was then corrupted into Jemisalem. Erom some similarity of the taste of the tubers to the taste of the petals and bottoms of the artichokes, the topinambtir was now termed Jerusalem artichoke. Some people made confusion worse by calling a soup made with the tubers of topinambur Palestine soup; we adhere to the true native name of the plant, topinambur, used by all classical magiric authors.

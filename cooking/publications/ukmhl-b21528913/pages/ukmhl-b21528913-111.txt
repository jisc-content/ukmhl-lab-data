83 CULINARY PROCESSES green vegetables, mostly in white sauce; it includes collec- tions of ripe fruit imbedded in jellies. Such a dish may be called a macedoine simply, as a dish of vegetables may also be termed a jardiniere; on the other hand, a printanihre is not usual. A la maitre dâ€™hdtel generally signifies a dish prepared by a substantial, but homely, modest sort of cooking. A la Girard is a surname derived from the name of a culinary assistant or under-cook, who, having prepared a dish which was to have been placed before and named after Madame de Maintenon (like the otherwise nondescript cdtelettes which are made to bear her name nowadays), thought it not good enough to bear that name, and gave it his own. Hence a muddled or miscarried dish is sometimes sarcastically termed h la Girard. A la Soiibise is generally applied to dishes which contain onions in quantity, or at least are strongly garnished and flavoured with them. A la Cricy is similarly connected with carrots, particularly in the form of puree. A number of similarly specific surnames, but applicable only to a limited circle of dishes, occur amongst the details of magiric literature: A VAllemande is a surname given to dishes to which French cooks have applied German provincial peculiarities of preparation. The most frequent application is to a dish with a garnish of sauerhmit as given with pork, or par- tridges, or pheasants; also prunes steived in luine, to German sioeet sauce for venison, or to quenelles of potatoes {cf. foot- note to p. 80, s^ipra). A la Polonaise is applied to every effort to introduce red beetroot or red cabbage, their juice, colour, and taste, into various dishes, of which Polish ragoM, or Borsch, is the type. A VIrlandaise is applied to dishes which contain potatoes in some form, in mass or as a prevailing garnish.

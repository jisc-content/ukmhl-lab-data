THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 194 is not practically treated as a soup, but served after the soup as one of the releves consisting of fish. Some culinary writers use the expression water-soucliet- hroth ; this should be ‘ souchet-broth,’ as this very broth is the result of the transformation of the water. For the same reason ‘ water-souchet ’ is a contradiction in terms, the more so when, as is done by some, the broth is termed the ‘ souchet.’ But the souchet is the piece of fish boiled in the broth, which latter, though thin, is soup-like and some- what savoury. We should, therefore, omit the ordinarily prefixed ‘ water ’ entirely from our nomenclature. Souchy-Broth.—Some prepare the souchy-broth with the trimmings of the fish which they intend to cut up for the souchies, but these will yield only a very thin decoction. Others make extract of from six to twelve flounders, which, properly concentrated, give a good fish broth. Others, again, extract the fishy flavour from the trimmings by means of weak stock or half standard broth, which gives a good flavour. The principal advantage of this souchet-broth will be reaped by eating-houses, where scores of fishes can be boiled one after the other in the same liquor. For use in private houses the souchy process offers no advantage over plain boiling. Souchies can be made with salmon—in which case they become equivalent to darne—sole, flounder, eel, perch, tench, trout, char, and other fish. In some cookery-books you are directed to send to table brown bread and butter with all souchies, a mode of premature stufling which should be discountenanced. The bread-and-butter had better remain associated with whitebait only, though even with this it has no patent or mystic connection. Turtle Soup, Soupe d la Tortue d I’Anglaise, is a clear or thick gravy soup, containing the gelatinous flaps of the skin and some of the green fat of the turtle, and adventitious quenelles. Turtles of all sizes yield good skin flaps, but

BARLEY SOUPS T65 Soups made with Barley. General Observations on Culinary Barley.—In the pre- paration for soups, barley has to be blanched—i.e., par- boiled and washed in the same manner as rice ; it has then to be boiled with well-prepared and flavoured broth, until it be quite done. Barley soups always are somewhat opaque, the more the longer the boiling has continued; this is a property of the peculiar starch contained in it. The barley best adapted for culinary purposes is termed Frankfort pearl barley, and this should be employed in the execution of all the recipes alluded to in the following. The puree of barley forms by simmering a semi-solution, which is very smooth and coherent, hence in Germany is called a mucilage. Some authors call this mucilage a cream. Barley contains about 13'78 per cent, of water, 11-16 per cent, of nitrogenous matter, and 62'25 per cent, of a starch peculiar to it. Barley soups neither require nor bear liaisons of eggs, or additions of Parma cheese. Having the peculiar mucilaginous body and flne flavour, which amalgamates best with the savour of various de- scriptions of meat, they should be treated very sparingly with spices and aromatic herbs; the addition to them of wine should be in general avoided; cream also should be added sparingly, if at all. With these limitations barley soups are most desirable articles of the dietary of the healthy as well as the sick. We shall omit from the following list of soups the fanciful, and, as no motives have been stated, perfectly gratuitous and unmeaning titles which they have received at various hands. These appella- tions are the less valuable and the more confusing, as various authors apply widely different names to the same dishes. These names have, therefore, not even the char- acter of symbols by which their bearers could be recognised and described.

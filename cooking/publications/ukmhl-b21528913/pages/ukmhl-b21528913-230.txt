202 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY with steamed rice. As it is practically made by expansion of the ragout called Indian curry (kari), we lead by a recipe for this. Indian Gurry [Kari), or BagoiU.â€”Cut a fowl to pieces as for a fricassee; put the pieces into a casserole, together with any other meat which you may choose, including some fresh or salt pork, a symphony of roots and a bouquet of herbs, and good broth.

To avoid this excess of heat and improve the flavour, some fry the spices with the onions, and thus efiect a better amalgamation; it is still better to use the tincture. This ragoiU, when diluted with the necessary amount of broth, becomes a soup, and this is the archetype of mulliga- tunny. Let the soup or the ragout be served with steamed or boiled Patna or Carolina rice. Some add apples, shallots, leek, and a few cardamom seeds to the ragout. We have a number of Indian recipes for curry which differ only in unimportant details. All insist on the necessity of having a savoury coulis as basis. It is the neglect of this essential demand which has brought curries and curry soups into dis- credit. There is a number of soups to be made of game when birds and quadrupeds are plentiful. Quails are now brought from Africa by the hundred thousand, and may occasionally be used freely in various forms. The birds, cut in quarters, may be stewed with julienne vegetables and peas pur6e, to

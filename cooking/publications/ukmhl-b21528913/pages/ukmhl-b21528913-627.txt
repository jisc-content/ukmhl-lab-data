599 CURDS AND WHEY itself and to the active watery extract.) The extract of three-quarters of a square inch of rennet skin will curdle four pints of milk. Curds and lohey may be eaten together, or the curds may be separated from the whey by a strainer, though without pressure, and mixed with cream, to which sugar and some loine or liqueur have been added. Or the curds may be strained off and pressed lightly, and placed and shaped in a mould; in that shape they are called (jreen cheese, a name which the London cheesemongers, and after them the populace, have corrupted into cream cheese. The brick- shaped white cheeses, bedded on parallel straws, sold under that seductive name in London (in Italy called ricotta), are mostly made of skim milk, sometimes of fresh milk, never of cream. The whey strained from curds is eagerly drunk by pigs ; it is also a wholesome diuretic and nutritive, easily-di- gestible food for man, owing to the dissolved albuminous substance, the sugar of milk, or lactose, and the salts, A ■whey cure in the Alys is a highly salutary proceeding in many cases of chronic illness. Gallina curds and whey is a classical English prepara- tion,* for which the ferment is derived from the tough coat that lines the inside of the proventriculus, or small (fore) stomach, situated between the crop and gizzard of turkeys and fowls. This ferment is always obtainable, while calf’s rennet is difficult of access. Care should be taken not to infuse it with boiling water, as some recipes ignor- antly advise, but only with warm water at blood-heat or lOO” Fahr. Very hot water destroys the ferment. Gallina curds and whey, says our instructor, when sweetened with sugar, makes a wholesome supper for persons of delicate habits, being entirely free from the disagree- able flavour of rennet.

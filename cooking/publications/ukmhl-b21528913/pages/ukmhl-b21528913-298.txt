270 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY Kirschenwasser, cognac brandy, cura90a, Dantzic gold- water, cedrally (cedrela), rum-punch, whisky, or gin, may be used. Variegated Jellies are characterized either hy different colours, in layers, or different flavours, all interspersed with shredded pistacio-nuts. In this way residual broken jellies may receive a new form. Streaked Jellies, or GeUes gyanacMes, became fashionable during the French Eevolution of 1789. Breccia Jellies are made by placing lumps of different jellies in a mould, and filling the interspaces with liquid differently-coloured jelly. When set the product resembles the breccia of geologists. Whisked or Frothy Jellies, also called Eussian, for no assigned reason, can be made with any jelly while in a state of fusion. When frothy it must be made to set by the external application of cold. The champagne jelly above described is frothy by the evolution of carbonic acid gas. The whisking process influences the appearance, but hardly the taste of the jelly. Comiyound Fruit Froths, or Macddoine Ptirde Jellies, are mixtures of jelly and compote. The pur4e of fruit is incor- porated with the jelly. Some of these compound fruit- puree jellies have received the name of pain, probably intended to indicate the rounded-off body, and translatable by loaf. Thus, a jelly with pur4e of pineapple is named Bain dâ€™Ananas; it is coloured with (60 grm.) a preparation of cochineal in gelatine, which the French call grenetine. Another, with pur6e of strawberries, is Pain de Praises, also requiring 40 grm. of grenetine. The jellies just mentioned form a transition to the com- pound creams, or Bavaroises, or Bavarian cheeses, which derive their consistency from gelatine, their richness from cream, and their flavour from extract of fruit, and owing to their triple basis are amongst the finest products of culinary art.

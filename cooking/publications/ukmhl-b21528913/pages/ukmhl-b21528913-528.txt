500 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY less destruction, like the comets which do not return, or the fire-ball meteors which burst. The necessary degree of mortification of the pheasant is recognised by its odour, and by the colour of its ventral aspect. Having attained this, it should be plucked and drawn; the ventral cavity should be well washed out and deodorized by immersion for a few minutes in a pink solution of permanganate of potash. For these odours proceeding from the abdominal organs are in reality hurtful to the flavour developed in the meat, while the essences in the flesh are not reached by the deodorant suggested. The stuffing of the pheasant may be effected in various ways, and in various degrees of sumptuousness; thus, according to Brillat-Savarin, you may incorporate with the farce intended to fill the bird the breasts of two ivoodcocks ; mince them, add beef marrow or suet, scraped bacon, pepper, salt, fine herbs, and a sufficient number of truffles, and put all in its appointed place. In case the thin abdominal wall should appear not to be sufficiently strong to keep the farce in the bird, place a crust of bread over it, and fasten it with a string; this will act as an efficient obturator. Prepare a yellow fried croustade of bread, and cover it with the pounded trails and livers of the wood- cocks and two large truffles, an anchovy, some scraped bacon, and a lump of butter; place the croustade thus covered underneath the pheasant while it is being roasted, so that all the juice flowing from it may be sucked up by the croustade. Dish the pheasant on the croustade, and garnish it with slices of Seville oranges. As an example of a still greater apog&e d'escidence than the one described, by which it was, however, suggested, we give the recipe for a braised pheasant galanthied with wood- cocks, called Faisan Luculhis, and invented by Vuillemot, the collaborator on the Dictionary of Dumas, and once mine host of the Tete Noire at St. Cloud : Obtain a tine fat

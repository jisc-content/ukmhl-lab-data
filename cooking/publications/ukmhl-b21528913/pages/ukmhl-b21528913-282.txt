THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 254 Plain Giirry Saitce. Flemish Sauce. Caper Sauce for broiled salmon and other fish. Sauces derived from Dutch Sauce. Compotmd Dutch Sauce is a combination of Dutch sauce with velout6 and some glace. Plain Compound Dutch Sauce is mixed with butter sauce instead of veloute. Various Independent Sauces. These sauces are called independent because they are not derived from any of the six grand sauces. Poor Man's Sauce, the Sausse au Pauvre Homme of La Chapelle, consists of chopped onions, pepper and salt, with a little water, thus not belying its name. A richer modification he produces by the addition of oil and vinegar; both sauces are to be used cold. Other forms of sauce of this name are more or less com- plicated brown onion sauce with pickles or herbs. Indian Curry Sauce is a roux expanded with broth, and flavoured with curry-powder. White Oyster Sauce is a white sauce to which oysters boiled in salt water are added. A yellow oyster satcce may be made with allemande, a brown one with espagnole; but these are derived. Mussel Sauces are in all respects analogous to oyster sauces. Claremont Sauce is onion-flavoured butter sauce. The onions are removed after frying. German Stueet Sauce is made of puree of cherries and pruneaux [Zxoetschen), and suitable for braised venison in all its forms. Compound Cherry Sauce is a mixture of cherry pur6e and black-currant jelly ; suitable for roast hare or venison.

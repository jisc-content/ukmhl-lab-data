292 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY applicable) to fritters containing slices of apples, inneapples, oranges, peaches, and other fruit. We then have custard fritters, being steamed custard, battered and fried, a useful form for the reservice of remainders; cake fritters, made, e.g., with remains of brioche, baba or ratan cake, Kugelhopfen, or even roll or bread ; they must be soaked well and long in milk, cream, or some juice, sugared, flavoured, battered, and fried crisp. Whole-hoiled rice, with any juice, and coated with batter, makes excellent fritters, sometimes miscalled croquettes. Varieties are produced by additions and flavours; thus, the Italians have a favourite variety, rice and ginger fritters, to which they give the name of diavolini.

There are croquettes of boiled beef, of chicken—elaborate ones, e.g., with tongue and truffles—of sweetbread, pheasant, rabbit, fat livers, lobster, turbot, sole, and others more rare. Kronieskys (d la Btisse), also called kraniouskys, are force- meat balls of any of the materials just mentioned, wrapped in braised calf’s udder, thinly cut, immersed in butter, and fried in hog’s lard ; instead of calf’s udder, calf’s cou'l (net, omentum) may be used as a wrapper.

The bacon should be previously cooked and cut into thin slices; each slice may envelop, e.g., tsvo oysters, or a teaspoonful of any salpicon. The form is said by some to be Eussian, by others Polish; the same uncertainty adumbrates either name. The

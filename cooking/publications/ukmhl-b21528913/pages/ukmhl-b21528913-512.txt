484 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY For Fried Chickens, the bodies should be partially boned, and steeped in a marinade, dipped in batter, crumbed and fried in batter. Cold chickens, which have been roasted or boiled or fricasseed may be similarly treated. In cookery- books a great number of similar preparations receive un- necessarily separate paragraphs, and thereby cause diffi- culties to persons who wish to make a choice amongst them.

Cold Boast Chicken may be moistened with mayonnaise; an addition of aspic, and aspic in shreds in cups, and a

NKE, PERCH-PIKE, AND OTHER RIVER FISH 557 studded and braised. The French culinary writer M. de Courchamps gives a recipe for a heaiitiful releve (of pike) to be served as a large dish in the first service. He terms it one of the most expensive dishes of the modern kitchen. The recipe is perfectly philistine by the vulgarity of its plethora, and only fit for the rustic geld-brotz dining in a Paris restaurant regardless of expense ; the complicated materials must needs spoil either the pike or the digestion. Perch, German Barsch, Perea fiuviatilis, is a river fish, but thrives also in lakes of sweet water. It is a voracious destroyer. It may be boiled with savoury and aromatic herbs, and this form goes in French culinarism by the comical name of d la xuatter-fish, with much variety of spelling, e.g., loastrefische. It may be prepared much like pike, but is a hard and tasteless dish. Perch-pike, German Zander, is much esteemed in North and Central Germany. Some German culinary treatises give as many as fifteen special recipes for its preparation. It is best prepared hke pike. Gudgeon, the gobio of the Eomans, French goujon, German Griindling, is a small fish, seldom reaching a pound in weight. At Paris it is a great favourite, and prepared like smelt. Poach, German Poche, like dace and chub, is a fish of little value as food. Barbel, French bar, German Par&c, should never be eaten, as it is liable to exhibit poisonous qualities. Gwinniad, from \Ne\sh. gweii, ivhite, German Wcissfisch, is a silvery-looking small fish, almost uneatable from its many spinous bones. At Niirnberg the paste of its scales is used for lining the inside of hollow glass beads, whereby they are made to look like real pearls.

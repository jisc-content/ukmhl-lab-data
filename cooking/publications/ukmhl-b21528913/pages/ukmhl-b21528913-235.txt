SOUP OF GIBLETS, HEADS AND TAILS IGTl enthusiastic gastronomer says : ‘ Je vais faire entrer en petite cuisine et vulgariser I’illustre potage celdbre par tant de poetes.’ Let us add that Camerani was manager (semainier perpetuel) of the Gom4die Italienne at Paris, and an appreciator of good cookery. As for the poetry, if it be an effect of the soup, the latter would be misjudged by its quality. Standard broth and all available vegetables, etc., form the liquid. To this are added, just before it is done, folds’ livers, one for each person, finely minced, or as puree, and on placing in the tureen, some ready-boiled macaroni and Parmesan cheese. When the concentrated ingredients are placed in layers and gratinated on the surface, the dish becomes a ragout, and ceases to be a soup in the modern sense. According to some French enthusiasts, ‘ a single spoonful will lap the palate in Elysium ; and while one drop of it remains on the tongue, each other sense is eclipsed by voluptuous thrilling of the lingual nerve.’* CHAPTEE XVI. SOUPS MADE FOR THE UTILIZATION OF GIBLETS, SKELETONS, HEADS AND TAILS. As regards the value of fowls’ giblets for soups and pies, much misapprehension prevails ; they are worth very little, and take a great deal of trouble and time to cook; they are also laborious to eat. Then, gizzards are always hard, and of no particular flavour, if not disagreeable. Most frequently, however, gizzards form no part of fowls’ giblets, but are wasted, like the liver, by being trussed up with a skewer outside the fowl, and shrivelled or burnt in the. roasting. For soup, boil the giblets in broth, and pick the edible parts * Ex Kitchiner, ‘ Oracle,’ p. 55.

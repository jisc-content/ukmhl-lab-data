559 LOBSTER, CRAB, CRAYFISH, OYSTERS which on pulling will come easily out of the remainder of the shell. The so-called potting of prawns and shrimps is really a mode of preserving them in clarified butter (ghee). PiO/wns go well in an omelette or in sorambled eggs. Prawns in French are called crevettes, shrimps chovvettes, or scilicogues. The omelette with prawn tails is beautifully said by Dumas ‘ to contain much kitchen,' meaning that most dexterous cookery was involved in its production—‘ voici un article qui, je crois, contient beaucoup de cuisine.’ Praicn soiip d la Bisque is quite analogous to true bisq^ie, described under Soups. In its preparation a little alcohol is not only useful, but necessary, to extract the colour and flavoior, and leave it with the fat. Crayfish, or craiofish, is a favourite with cooks for garnishes for mere show, on skewers surmounting or screening the dishes. Their main mission is to furnish that excellent soup called bisque. Jules Janin is reported to have jocularly termed the boiled lobster a marine cardinal. Dumas, smell- ing disrespect, denies this. By extending this a little, we might term the crustaceans, which turn red by heat, aqmtic cardinals; to cooks such a comparison will, appear less dis- respectful than to some other people, as they are in the habit of calling many dishes, distinguished by a natural or artificially imparted red colour, a la cardinal. Crayfish has been honoured with many recipes for its preparation besides those of bisque. It is boiled, steioed d la Bordelaise, d VAnglaise, en matelote—after the manner of Gascony ; on canapes, in aspic, etc. Dressed crab, hot or cold, is an old English dish, and re- quires much patience for its picking. Many fishmongers have great dexterity in its preparation, and produce a good-looking dish. Of oysters there is a great variety in the world, but none attain the quality of the English natives of Whitstable.

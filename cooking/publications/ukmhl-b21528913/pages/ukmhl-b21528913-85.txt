KirCHEN REQUISITES AND CULINARY AXIOMS 57 The cook should further have suspended near the chopping- block a chopper, a meat-smv, a broad chisel measuring two inches along the cutting edge, and a mallet. With these instruments the bones of any joints can be elegantly ad- justed, and the task of carving much facilitated. Three culinary knives, of different sizes, for the dressing of meat; a mincing-knife, being half knife, half chopper, but light and sharp ; a rocking-knife, a crescent-shaped tool used to mince with its convex edge, without noise, meat as well as vegetables, and a square mincing-hoard of thick, hard wood, complete the outfit having reference to the treatment of the flesh of animals. For the production of dishes in which flour is used we require two plcdn pudding motolds, for use in hot water; a cake-mould, for baking in the oven; two p>lain border moulds; a jagger, with revolving disks; a set of gjastry-ciitters; two dozen of patty, dariole or fanchonette pans ; a dozen mince-pie-pans; a baking sheet, or several sheets, if there be oven room ; two baking-tins, two bread or cake tins, two soufflh tins of various sizes; a. flour-dredger; a sugar-dredger; a pep>per-box, with a small perforated well-fixed lid; a bread-grater, and a smaller grater for nutmeg. For the treatment of vegetables there should be a set of vegetable cutters, a root-knife, and several knives, a separate set to be used for onions exclusively. Ot forks there should be a great dishing-up-fork, and several smaller ordinary companions. Of various apparatus a toasting-fork is perhaps the most useful. A block-tin colander serves for filtering liquids from solids, e.g., the vegetables from the water in which they have been boiled; a tin gravy-strainer serves to eliminate smaller particles from roast gravies ; a loire sieve serves similar purposesâ€”if its gauze be-fine it serves like a hair-sieve; two hair sieves of different sizes, with glass vessels to receive and hold them on the top, are necessary for the production of purees. For frying, par-

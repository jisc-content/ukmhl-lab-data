THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 120 the flesh of the legs, being mostly uneatable, yields extract, and the internal organs, together with any dried gravy on the outside, yield a fine gravy flavour, a so-called fumet. Definition and Production of Glace. Before the discovery of meat-extract by Proust, practical cooks were by no means aware that savour resided in meat only, but shared the common error that gelatine in broth was a valuable ingredient, and that the setting of the broth into jelly on cooling indicated great strength. They there- fore so managed their stock-pot as to obtain a highly gela- tinized stock; the pot became a museum of bones and vegetable residues, and when its contents were not worked up in actual cookery, they were evaporated down to a mostly dark-coloured extract called glace. This set, on cooling, into a solid mass, nearly as hard as cold meat, and was, and is in our days, kept ready, in various qualities, for the improvement, characterization, or specialization of soups, sauces, entrees, etc. Our most celebrated cooks have seen a change in the taste of their masters, and effected a parallel one in their practice. In the first half of the century the soups called ‘ clear ’ were required to be of a glutinous, substantial character, or, in other words, they had to contain much gelatine duly flavoured by herbs; this result the cooks managed to obtain by the addition of glace. But now the clear soups must be liquid, pronounced but not too concentrated as regards broth and flavour; the glutinous consistency is no longer preferred, but is relegated to the thick soups. We have even heard it asserted by one of our greatest chefs that this excessive consumption of glace in soups and entries was discountenanced because it had a perceptibly injurious influence upon gouty persons, and seemed to produce the arthritic diathesis in others.

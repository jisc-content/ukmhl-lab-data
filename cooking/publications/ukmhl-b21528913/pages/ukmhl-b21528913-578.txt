550 THE SJTE/T OF COOKERy We have just related that the ‘ stuffed trout ’ was to have been boiled in wine. This recipe comes from Eeyni^re, of ‘ Ahnanach ’ notoriety ; he directed that the wine in which the trout was boiling should he. made to take fire, probably as a proof of the alcohol having in the main been expelled. Many cookery-book compilers in succession copy this one from the other without seeing its purport, saying that, if the wine took fire, it would improve the sauce. None of these writers has ever made this sauce, simply because a composition such as the recipe of Eeyniere indicates does not, because it cannot, take fire, even if it flashed when a lighted match were put to it. Eeyniere recommended the addition of a little wine to the mixture of bouillon and vege- tables ; the next generation of cookery-book compilers pre- scribed a bottlefid of chablis; the latest lights with the coeur leger, two or three bottles full. Such a sautapan they no doubt could have fired, and the kitchen chimney, perhaps the kitchen as well. These recipes are striking instances of the errors of some of these writers—namely, of attempting to give themselves an air of magnificence by written pro- positions, which, when closely considered, are entirely im- practicable. Trout may be filleted, fried, and be formed into an ‘ epigram,’ a mysterious name from early French cookery, in which there was an element of symbolic mysticism. A good cold entrde for supper is Trout loith Montpellier Blotter. Char is taken in the lakes of Cumberland and Westmore- land, and is in season from July till October. When fresh it may be eaten as souchet; it is brought to London as p)otted char, and, curiously enough, reported to be fresh in April. Char may be boiled, skinned, and glaced, and makes a good basis for a steived matelote. Lampreys have a halo of anecdote around them, which might fill many pages; most of these are fables, such as

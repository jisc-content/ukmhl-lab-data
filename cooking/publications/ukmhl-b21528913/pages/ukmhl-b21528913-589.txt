561 SHELLFISH, OCTOPUS, FROG The trimmed mussel is replaced iu its shell spiced, and covered with a savoury farce, c.g., sausage meat; it is then painted with hutter, over this with yolk, crumbed, again buttered, and baked in an oven for twenty minutes. Clams are a species of cockles, found only in Devonshire, Cornwall, part of Wales, and on the west coast of Ireland and Scotland. On the basaltic island of Staffa the cave third in size is named after this shellfish Glam Shell Cave. Clams, when small, may be eaten raw ; when they are larger they may be cooked after several of the recipes applicable to oysters. . Cockles and whelks are, like oysters, eaten raw. Peri- winkles, popularly called tvinkles, are small marine snails, and eaten as a relish with bread-and-butter. A great variety of molluscs in shells are considered edible in the cooked state in many parts of the world; on some American markets such shellfish, removed from their tests, are sold by the gallon and bushel. Some of these edible molluscs are very large, e.g., the hammussel, Pinna squa- mosa, which is fished up from the bottom of the salt lakes of Meleda, one of the larger Dalmatian islands. The animal is eaten stewed in risotto ; it attains a length of from two to three feet. It also yields the silky byssus, which is used for makiug gloves and other tissues. The octopus or sepia was eaten by Greeks and Eomans, and is used in the South of Spain in the present day. The cartilaginous plate of its back, when trimmed and stewed, is much like the tendrons of veal. A sauce of reduced esp agnole, coloured deep>ly icith the ink from the hag of the seina, is sent to table with it. This preparation is an attractive, refined, and digestible dish. The 2yrep>aration of a dish of frogs has led to the greatest of modern inventions, namely, galvanic electricity. Nobody would probably take to a frog diet, or arrange a meal of frogs, out of enthusiasm for this fact. But thousands living 36

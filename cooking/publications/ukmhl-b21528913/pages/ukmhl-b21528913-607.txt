579 BOUDINS, TURBANS AND MAZARINES manufacturers of liqueitrs : ‘ Sic transit gloria Carthusian- orum.’ The compound chartreuses, as they may be called, de- scribed in cookery-books, are more numerous than distin- guished ; they contain a mixture of meat with vegetables. All kinds of meat, fowl, fish, and vegetable may be used ; but we should prefer to see every such dish described under a proper name, and not abused as a farce on a chartreuse. Boudins of forcemeat, which some erroneously range under chartreuse, should be considered elsewhere. By ornamental croustades are meant such structures of the fried bread class as are not intended to be eaten, but only to contain edible preparations. Almost every kind of ragoitt, fricassee, garnish, or sauce in any combination so as to form an entree, such as are directed to be used in com- bination with p>dUs-chctuds, vol-au-vents, casseroles of rice, borders of potato paste, timballs, and any other similar case, can be used in connection with croustades ; but these re- ceptacles certainly offer no advantages whatever over the traditional classical cases.

As to the piites-chauds correspond the diminutive petits pates or patties, so to the ornamental correspond the small croustades, in Italian called crustadini; they may be made of small sections of bread, or of any of the materials of pastry crusts.

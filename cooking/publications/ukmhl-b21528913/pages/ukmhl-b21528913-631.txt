Usit OF KUMYS, PEPTONISED MILK 603 ture of hcer or xoine yeast and sour milk—/.c., lactic ferment. When it has begun to ferment it is beaten incessantly during twelve hours, at a temperature of 35 . It then is weak kumys, and is filtered from the excess of caseine if wanted for drinking. After twenty-four hours of fermenta- tion the weak kumys becomes medium strong, and remains so until forty-eight hours have elapsed. Strong kumys is obtained only by agitating the mare’s milk incessantly during more than forty-eight hours. It can be bottled, corked, and preserved under pressure on ice; in the bottles it forms three layers, uppermost a little oil, in the middle the vinous solution, and below some caseine. Before use these are mixed by agitation. A person who drinks ten champagne quart bottles full, equal to a gallon and two-thirds of a gallon, of (mare’s) kumys daily ingests as much nutriment as a strong adult requires—namely, nitrogenized matter, 4"8 oz. ; fat, 4‘3 oz.; and carbo-hydrates, 15'2 oz. Tuberculous, i.c., pulmonary consumptive persons drink- ing sufficient quantities of kumys are observed to increase half a pound in weight daily during three to four weeks; the pulse becomes quiet, fever disappears, and on the whole great improvement is effected. Under the influence of imncreatin, a ferment extracted from the pancreas, or sweetbread, of cattle, and sold by chemists, cow’s milk is transformed in such a manner that its caseine is no longer precipitable by acids or alcohol, but is in the state of (probably) assimilable ‘peptone. It may then be mixed with acids, sugar of milk, or cane-sugar, and alcoholic preparations, such as rum, cognac or wine, and drunk as a nutritive stimulating beverage. Care must be taken to watch its effects, as in erethic persons it may prove intoxicating, even in small doses, by its quick absorption ; moreover, the taste of the alcohol is concealed, and its quan- tity may exceed the intention of the consumer unawares.

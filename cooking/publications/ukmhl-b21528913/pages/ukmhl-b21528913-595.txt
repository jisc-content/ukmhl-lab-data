MATERIALS AND INGREDIENTS OE PIES 567 and is advised in all cookery-books, particularly as regards pies, puddincjs, ragoiUs, and stetvs. We have never found any advantage to pie or pudding accruing from the practice. Eggs communicate very little taste by their yolks, none by their whites. Neither do they, inversely, acquire much taste in the pie, and the white is generally hard, while the yolk not rarely crumbles. We suspect that the eggs were possibly introduced with a view of somewhat increasing the nutritive value of a dish which — e.g., pigeon pie — was, as regards the particular ingredient of pigeon, but small when compared to the volume. Or we may surmise that the eggs were introduced with the view of diversifying the aspect of the contents of the pie when they appear on the plate of the diner, and were thus intended to act more upon the eye than the palate. On the whole, our consideration terminates adversely to the introduction of eggs in pies, and we come to the result that well-selected quenelles of forcemeat, including such as contain a good deal of yolk as a binding material, are preferable to eggs or yolks, of whatever kind. We name the ingredients of the princiiKil pies, which govern their appellation: Bwnpstealc; mutton; veal and ham; chicken and ham, simple and compound; pigeon loith i gvouse loith beef; p>artridge with veal; gihlet of goose with veal; rabbit; hare; sea pie, or compoiond lark p>l& —i.e., Icorks with veal or beef; fieldfare or blackbird codl- poitnd pie with stuffing and beef; woodcock or snipe pie with forcemeat. There is a distinction brought into the foreground in some recipes, between forcemeat and farce, which has not been upheld or mentioned anywhere. Forcemeat is a com- position of meat mainly, with only as much of other ingredients as is necessary to bind it; while farce may, but need not, contain any meat at all, and may consist ex- clusively of spiced panada with egg liaison.

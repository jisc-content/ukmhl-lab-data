•72 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY the charge simultaneously into as well as out of the oven. These are also provided wuth ixijrometers, or heat-measuring instruments, and thus yield very good results. We have seen them adapted to ships of several kinds, and to ficld- hahcries for soldiers. Brick ovens, being heated from the inside, exhibit the sufficiency of their heating by the clear- ing of the surface from black soot, and once charged with preparations to be baked, cannot be heated again until the charge be withdrawn; but iron ovens are heated from the outside, like those of most kitcheners, and can be heated and reheated without regard to the contents of their interior. They are also a little more economical, as they are heated more quickly, and consume less coal or wood than the brick- ovens. A general prineiple of baking is that the oven vmst he sufficiently hot at the moment at which the preparations to be baked are introduced into it; they must experience the same surprise as that which articles to be fried meet with when they are immersed into the hot fat. An indifferently heated oven does not cause the preparations to rise, but drying them leaves them of a pale colour, which is objec- tionable in many products. Roasting.—Boasting is that culinary operation in which the English excel all other nations. It consists in bringing a joint of meat, or a small animal, so near to a clear fire that-it may become cooked, and ultimately browned over its surface, and thus acquire that taste and savour by which roast meat excels all other forms of preparation of flesh- food.

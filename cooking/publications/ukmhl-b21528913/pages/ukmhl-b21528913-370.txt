342 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY of some aviido-acicls. There is also a small quantity of solanin present in the potato, the deleterious substance of which a larger quantity forms in the shoots which the tubers send out in spring. Solanin is a saccharide, or body which by decomposition yields sugar. It is not poisonous in the small quantities in which it is ever present in the tubers. When more of it is formed, e.g., under the in- fluence of the exposure of the potatoes to light, these latter assume, besides a green colour, a disagreeable taste, and this protects from the consumption of solanin in poisonous quantities. The introduction of potatoes as a popular aliment was opposed for a long time after their first importation by Ealeigh in 1585. Even as late as a century ago it required the labours of a French physician, Parmentier, to cause the last opposition to disappear; and when he was pro- posed for the office of municipal councillor, a woman of the people opposed him with the words : ‘ He would make us eat nothing but potatoes.’ The tubers are eaten hailed, steavied, baked, stewed, fried, or sautdes, boiled and mashed, as purde, as dumplings, crogxiettes, or quenelles, in various fancy forms, such as excavated and stuffed, or farcied. For some dishes mealy or floury potatoes are preferable; for others, such as potatoes in ^ohite sauce, or potato salad, the less mealy, more consistent small Dutch potatoes, or finger potatoes, are preferable. On tbe preparation of potatoes an essay might be written for the information of many cooks, to induce them to observe the rationale of the preparations which are empirically detailed in cookery-books. Those who seek excellence in ‘ a hundred ways ’ are sure to miss the easily attainable good. The Cabbage Tribe. Seakale, Crambe maritima, is not eaten in its full grown state, but only the sprouts of its second year’s growth are

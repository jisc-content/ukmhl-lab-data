609 rO.-^STS, RdTIES, AXD CROUTONS makes that soft and fresh-tasting, while the dry outside becomes immediately and equally but lightly browned. ‘ Wyvern’ maintains that, except in special cases, the slice of bread destined to receive any savoury composition should be delicately fried in butter till it be of a golden colour. We for our part cannot consent to call such a preparation toast; it is fried bread, French croMon, Italian crustino; nor can we consent to attribute to a croirton the same gustatory quality and digestibility as to a piece of toast. However, while holding them distinct, we may treat them side by side, inasmuch as they may be garnished with the same savoury preparations. The true French expression for toast is rdtie, an ellipse from tranche de imiii rotie, a feminine noun, and thus broadly distinguished from the male rdti, a roast piece of meat. Some have given the following definition of roties : ‘ Tranches de pain qu’on fait rotir et sur lesquelles on sert differentes substances maigres ou grasses.’ This we adopt, and do not allow croutons to be ranged under it. Amongst our selected recipes, the Indian ones from ‘Wyvern,’ we find anchovyimrde to be served on either toast or crouton, and several variations: 'Bdties of S^nnach, both savoury and sxoeet; of Cucumber or Gourd ; of green French Beans; of leaves and stalks of Beetroot; of Indian country greens, especially leaves of the mollay-keeray; Bamle-Cai (Bhindi) Toast; Brinjals {Binegum) and Moringa Toast; Toast of the Flower of the Coco-nut Palm; Bdties of Veal Kidney; of Sweetbread; of Capon; of Siveetbread and Ham; of Woodcock ; of Fat Livers of Geese ; of Ham ; of Mcorroio tvith Sugar; of Marroio xoithout Sugar ; en Canapd ; of Eggs; ivith Bacon; a variety with local names, such as d la Pro- vengale, a la Hollandaise, etc.; of Fish an maigrc ; of but- tered Eggs; oj hard-boiled Eggs ; of Eggs ivith Cream; of Purde or Mince of Kidney ; of cold roast Game ; of Sardine, Herring, and various other Fish and their roes. 3<J

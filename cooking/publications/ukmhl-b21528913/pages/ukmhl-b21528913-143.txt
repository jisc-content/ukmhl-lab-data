New Principles for the Preparation and Use of Standard Broth. We produce our standard bouillon or broth by dissolving an ounce of Proust’s extract of beef, or extract of mutton, in a quart of hot water. With this we operate in such a manner that we know the bouillon strength of each dish, as expressed in soluble extract from given weights of beef or mutton. The advantage of such a solution over the best beef-tea made in the exact proportion of 2 lb. of minced beef free from bone, fat and tendon, to just so much water as is necessary for it to yield a quart of boiling product, is evident from the following considerations: Firstly, to produce this best beef-tea, we should have to get and pay for 2 lb. of gravy-beef, free from bone and fat.

The broth thus obtained would certainly be good as regards strength, but it would be turbid from fat, glycogen, and suspended albuminous particles, and would be the more decidedly greasy the fatter had been the beef or mutton from which it had been prepared. We should therefore be obliged to perform upon it two operations before we could use it for high-class cooking. We should have to let it get

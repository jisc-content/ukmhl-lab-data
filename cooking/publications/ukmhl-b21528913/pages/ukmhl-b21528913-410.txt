382 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY fine crust, excellent taste, and is highly nutritious. It constitutes, in fact, with a certain amount of fat, a perfect food. It is very digestible, and can be eaten and assimilated with extraordinary facility by persons who suffer from disease or derangement of the digestive organs. It is raised with the aid of four-tenths of an ounce, or 175 grains, of compressed yeast to the pound of flour. CHAPTEE XXX. GRIDDLE-CAKE, DUMPLINGS, PORRIDGE, MACARONI, AND NOUILLES. Ltriddle or Girdle Cakes, and Gliuppattees or Stone-cakes, are analogous elementary preparations of flour for human food. The girdle, or griddle, is a circular plate of iron with a rim, and surmounted by a semicircular handle like a carrying- basket. The latter is necessary for placing the girdle on the open Are and taking it off when the cake is done. In respect of the manner in which it is baked on the free fire, the girdle-cake is analogous to the pancake. From the absence of any covering, we may suppose that the cake, in order to succeed, must, like the chuppattee of the Hindoos or the fried pancake, be very thin. Its advantages were that it could be made at short notice, in small quantity, easily repeated, and be eaten hot.* An inhabitant of an English town of the present time has probably little inducement to bake a griddle-cake, but if he were to become transplanted * ‘ Biddy, Patsey’s grand-daughter, would occasionally allow us to assist her in making griddle-cake. Deb and I took it in turns to knead the dough in a brown crock. Oh ! the rapture of handling it, and pressing it, and spreading it on a board, and rolling it, and patting it, and cutting it in fours, and flouring the griddle, and laying it thereon.’—Ex Croker, B. M., ‘ Pretty Miss Neville.’ London, 1887, p. 13.

WHITE OR VELOUTE SAUCE 239 White Sauce, or Velout6. Put into a stewpan 1 lb. of sliced lean ham, 1 lb. of veal or beef, also sliced, and above that two old hens or partridges cut in pieces. Add sufficient standard broth for it to reach the upper surface of the meat ] cover the pan, and let the contents boil briskly until the liquid is condensed nearly to a pale glace; then draw the pan on to a moderately hot part of the hearth; fill it up again with some normal stock, add a carrot, an onion, some cloves, a blade of mace, a faggot of parsley, half a dozen green onions, a bay-leaf and a sprig of thyme tied together. Boil the mixture once more, skim it, and pass it through a tammy or stout calico filter into a large basin. The Roilx.—Place into a stewpan the ready prepared luhite roux, pour the extract over it, and mix both by diligent stirring over the fire. Removal of Fat. —Eegulate the consistency of the sauce by the cautious and gradual addition of standard broth, so that after boiling up and subsequent gentle simmering it may throw up to the surface all the loose fat and the butter with which the roux was made, together with any coarser particles or little lumps which coalesce on the surface, either as a scum or in the form of a skin. Then the sauce assumes that perfectly smooth appearance and impression upon the tongue to which it owes the name of veloute. If necessary, dilute the sauce a little more, remove crudities from the top, and then pass it through a tammy or cloth into a white basin, stir it till it is cold, and put it in the larder for future, or in the water-bath for immediate, use. Finished Veloutd Sauce, VelouU TravailUe or Coulis Blanc.—In order to finish the stock velout6, add to it con- somm6 of veal or fowls (instead of blond de veau) and white essence of mushrooms, as well as the white varieties of all other accessories. Avoid the addition of lemon to the stock as well as the finished sauces

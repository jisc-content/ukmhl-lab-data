THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 322 a pur6e, and flavoured with bdchamel or veloutc, and a little sugar. Portuguese cooks even add a little caramel to perpetuate its natural slight bitterness, which disappears during the processes of parboiling, stewing, or braising. Tomatoes. The tomato-plant belongs to the family of Solaneae, of which the belladonna is a highly poisonous, but in medical practice useful, the potato a very nutritious member. One of the Latin names of the tomato is Solanum lycopersicum; another, Lycopersimm esculenkim vulgare, the edible wolfs 2Jeach, popularly love-app)le. It came to us from Mexico through the West Indies; in Mexico, according to Nierem- berg, it is spelt tamalt; but the Malays, who also cultivate it, according to Eumphius, pronounce it tamatte. The eat- able part is the red, fleshy berry, or seed-capsule; the seeds, with some of the watery pulp, may be squeezed out of the fruit with the hand, through an aperture made by cutting out the hard central base to which the stalk is attached. When the tomato is quite ripe, its red peel also is easily removed, and there remains the red succulent pulp. A small variety of tomatoes, cultivated more for ornament than use, has berries of the size of small cherries, down to peas, and these contain juice only and no pulp ; their peel, too, is harder than that of the large fruit, but they are very pretty as ornamental garnishes to savoury dishes, entrees, and ragoiits. The raw tomato has an acidulous taste of wild or uncultivated vegetables, which is disliked by children, and sometimes by ladies. It greatly improves with oil and vinegar as salad, and becomes still more developed when stewed, baked, or braised. Nevertheless, even these forms are inferior to its climax, which is attained in pur6es, soups, and sauces. These must be well reduced, as the fruit is very watery.

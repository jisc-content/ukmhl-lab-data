THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY ago Purification of Suet and other Alimentary Fats.* Animal fats and oils which are deteriorated by a par- ticular odour are freed from this by the operation of being used for frying ; after that they can be used in all culinary operations, including the production of pastry, particularly puff-paste. Fish-oil is completely purified of its odoriferous principle by being heated to 330° C., or near the boiling- point of mercury. Fatty acids distil in a current of water- vapour heated to above 100°, while neutral fats remain fixed; but when the neutral fats have been previously heated to a temperature of from 300° to 330°, they are decomposed, and the fatty acids distil with the superheated steam. The operation of frying itself purifies fats by the elimina- tion of the volatile fatty acids, which in general are the cause of the objectionable odour of fats. To purify fats in general, without imparting to them any flavour whatever, it is necessary to heat them slowly to 140° to 150°, and then cautiously throw in small quantities of water with a brush in minute droplets. This causes the fat to boil violently, almost explosively, with great noise (called ‘ screaming ’), and some spitting of fat abroad ; the operator must therefore keep face and hands at a distance to prevent the formation of minute burns and blisters. Mutton suet is purified of its peculiar odour by being lieated to 150°, at which temperature the hircia is decomposed, and hircic acid passes away. During the siege of Paris some mutton-fat candles were thus purified, and the fat was used for food. Classification of Fried Objects. Fritters are a subdivision of fried objects, and their name has therefore a more limited application than that of the * Cf.

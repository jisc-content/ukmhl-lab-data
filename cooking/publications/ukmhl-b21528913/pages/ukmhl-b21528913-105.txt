CULINARY PROCESSES 77 which a cook might become an expert in frying by tuition, but that to become a I'oaster he must be born a genius with an instinct for the spit. On 'peut cluvenir fritiirier, on est nd rotisseur, runs the paraphrase of Horace. We believe that innate talent, good practical instruction, the knowledge and observance of all the conditions of success, may combine to produce a superior artist, but that no one need despair of producing good roasts who will intelligently and energetically obey and carry out the instructions contained in the fore- going, combined with the results of this special deliberation on details arising in the course of the roasting. In case the roast be from any cause deficient in colour, this may be supplied by painting it with some hotted glaze prepared beforehand. If you require to increase the volume of gravy, do not dilute what you have, but produce some by an extra operation, according to the relative recipe below, from fried mince and standard broth. The common method of washing the corners and underside of the joint, and maybe the canal made by the spit, with a solution of a teaspoonful of salt in a quarter-pint of boiling water, or of pricking the underside of the joint with a sharp skewer, are all effected at the cost of the quality of the joint. Gravy for roast heef should not be mixed with any made sauce, but gravy for roast veal may be suitably diluted with melted butter or butter sauce. Dredging and Basting. — As a proof that our ancestors were very particular in basting and dredging joints before and during roasting, we give a list of dredgings and bastings,as used two and a half centuries ago. Dredgings. 1. Flour mixed with grated bread. 2. Sweet herbs dried and powdered, and mixed with grated bread. 1 ‘ Gravy for Roast Veal’: Kitcliiner, loc. cit., p. 243 ; list of 1QAR ^ I’^itohincr, p. 84, ex May’s ‘ Accomplished Cook.’ London, XOv)d| p* lou*

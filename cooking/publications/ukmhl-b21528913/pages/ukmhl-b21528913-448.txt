THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 420 As a warning against coimterfeits, it should be mentioned that, perhaps in connection with vegetarian predilections, recipes for mincemeat so called have crept into cookery- books which contain no meat at all, some of them being at the same time provided with a great excess of alcoholic ingredients. Such preparations should not be called mince- meat, and should be excluded from culinary literature as long as they bear a false title. The Glacing, Icing, or Encrusting of Cakes are processes applied partly for their ornamentation, partly for their preservation, particularly from exsiccation. The plain sugar glace is made with powdered sugar, white of egg, and a little washing blue (cobalt or smalte blue), and is spread cold on the hot cake. Chocolate glacing is applied hot, the pieces of cake being immersed in the fused solution of the chocolate in pearling syrup. Several other flavours may be imparted to the fused sugar instead of the chocolate, and in this particular the ingenuity of the confectioner has much opportunity for the display of variety. Thus, the sections of a twelfth cake may be flavoured with a selection of essences and liqueurs; the icing for bride cake, however, should be quite neutral. CHAPTEE XXXIV. THE PHILOSOPHY OF PUDDINGS. Puddings are, as to the name, of uncertain derivation. In French they were formerly called poutins (La Chapelle), or poutinade (‘ Dons de Comus,’ i. 298); but this hard spelling does not occur in modern dictionaries. The modern French word bo^cdin is not practically equivalent to pudding, as its application is confined to compositions of animal matters

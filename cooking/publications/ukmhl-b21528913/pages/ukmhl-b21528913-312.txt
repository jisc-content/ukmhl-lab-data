THE SPIRET OF COOKERY 284 0‘9 per cent, of membrane. The fat tissue underneath the skin contains from 12 to 20 per cent, of water, and from 84 to 79 per cent, of pure fat, and from 3 to 4 per cent, of membrane. Good suet from the ox contains 91 to 95 per cent, of fat, 5 to 7 per cent, of water, and from 0-8 to IT per cent, of membrane. The fat from the breast or sternum (brisket fat) of sheep and oxen is richest in water, 15 to 30 per cent., contains from 4 to 5 per cent, of membrane, and 70 to 85 per cent, of fat. Yet this fat tissue is very solid and consistent even after it has been boiled, and this consistency and its excellent taste cause it to be much inquired after. The South Germans term this brisket fat ‘ breast kernel,’ from the similarity of its taste to that of a nut. The hump of the camel is analogous to it both in structure and in taste. The fat tissues of the hog are throughout richer in pure fat, and contain less water (6'44 per cent.) than those of oxen and sheep (water, 10T8 per cent. mean). Good lard should contain only from to 1 per cent, of water, per cent, of nitrogenous matter, and at least 99 per cent, should consist of pure hog’s fat. The fats of all three species of animals have an almost identical chemical elementary composition—namely, con- tain from 76‘5 to 76 6 per cent, of carbon, 11-9 to 12 per cent, of hydrogen, and 11-3 to 11-5 per cent, of oxygen. With this the composition of cow-butter fat coincides very closely, but not entirely, as it contains 75’63 per cent, of carbon, 11‘87 per cent, of hydrogen, and 12'50 per cent, of oxygen. Human fat has the same elementary composition as animal fat. In the animal and vegetable fats, which are soft or liquid at ordinary temperature, olein (or trioleo-glyceride) prevails ; as they get more solid, margarin or palmitin (trimargarito- or tripalmito-glyceride) rises in quantity; with increasing

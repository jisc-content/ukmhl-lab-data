i6i SOUPS OF PUREES OF ROOTS, ETC. carrots. The original Crecy,* however, contained many vegetables ; indeed, for it were prescribed, as for jardiniere, toutes sortes de Ugumes,j which were to be parboiled, fried in butter, pounded, passed through a sieve, and thus trans- formed into a puree, to be mixed with prepared broth. Compared with this most comprehensive recipe all other recipes become more or less specializations in favour of carrots, until some hold puree of carrots only and soupe a la Crecy to be synonymous. Eecipes which look much to the colour of the puree prescribe that the red or outer part only of the carrots should be taken, and the core be rejected. This selection is needless when other roots, such as turnips, are added. We should call the original Crecy soup, as the most complicated, compound carrot soup; every plain one, carrot soitp simply. For the production of puree, the carrots should be parboiled in water for ten minutes, and then stewed with fresh butter, sugar, salt and aromatic herbs, and ultimately boiled with standard broth. The soup of pur&e of carrots may receive an addition of green peas or of rice. The soups of puree of turnips are two in number, one called white, the other broiun; for the production of the latter, the turnips are browned during the braising, by frying and formation of glace j in the case of the white soup they are kept covered with broth during the whole process-of boiling. Turnips should always be parboiled in water, and the water should be poured away, as in their natural state they would yield too strong a flavour, and be difficult to digest. A soup of puree of kmiips and tomatoes, made after the brown modification, and served with quenelles of potatoes, has been called soupe d la Piemontaise, and been supposed to be a national soup ; but it is little specific. * Also spelt Croissy : F., 292 ; Cord.

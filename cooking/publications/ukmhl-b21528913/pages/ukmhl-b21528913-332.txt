3C4 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY A common salpicon would contain sweetbread and fat livers, with fungi, or quenelles, or godiveau, white meat of fowls previously roasted, cocks’ combs, and artichoke bottoms, all with espagnole sauce. Most ragouts admit of being presented in a white modi- fication—i.c., with veloute sauce; or a brown form—i.e., with espagnole. Of the great number of ragouts to be found in magiric literature, we shall mention -only the characteristic or important ones : Bagout of Sioeetbreacl — one of the finest; of Cocks' Combs and Kernels, called en Financiere, from the sauce. These bodies, being themselves tasteless, require careful saucing to serve as vehicles; if badly prepared, they justly excite contempt. Bagodt d la Toidouse is very complicated; may be given with allemande or supreme sauce in a vol-au- vent or a casserole of rice. From its many optional in- gredients, it is also called Bagout meld and Bagodt fin. Calf’s-head Bagodt (en Tortue, because the calf’s head is prepared as for mock-turtle) is an excellent preparation; the one called d la Chiioolata contains more strongly spiced farce to serve as garnish to roast or boiled turkey, capon, or poulard. Similarly classical are the ragouts of Ox-palates ; Bed Sheep)'s Tongues ; Stuffed Chicken-ioings ; Fillets of Fotvl or Game; Fillets of Larks; Goose-liver, d la Strasbourg; Quenelles of Chicken; of Eel-fillets; of Crayfish-tails and Quenelles of Whiting; of Crayfish-tails, Mussels, and Oysters ; of Prawns or Shrimps in place of Crayfish ; of Fillets of Sole, Salmon, Trout; soft Boe of Carp or other fish. Of cuiHosities amongst ragouts, we have met with two— one of Carps' Tongues, a mockery of an antiquated paradox ; and a Bagodt of Babbits' Tongues, which was imagined and produced by Vuillemot. An old form of ragout is termed a Tcrrine, and is really an entree, which takes its name from the former custom of serving the meat in the very terrine in which it had been

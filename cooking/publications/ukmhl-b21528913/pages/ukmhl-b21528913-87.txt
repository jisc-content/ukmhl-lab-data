KITCHEN REQUISITES AND CULINARY AXIOMS 59 cally, polished like a mirror. Wrought-iron vessels tinned are useful for a time, but gradually lose their tin. Enamelled iron ware is useful as long as the enamel is entire ; when this lining is cracked it becomes inconvenient, as difficult to keep clean. Enamelled iron is a bad con- ductor of heat, and in this respect resembles earthenware. Of enamelled iron pans, a frying-pan is least to be recom- mended, as it retards a process which ought to be swift and short. Earthenware is very good for slow boiling or simmering, but it is always liable to crack, and therefore in the long-run more expensive than ironware. Block tin, being sheet-iron plated with tin, is very useful, as vessels made of it are light and conduct the heat well; but they are liable to rust quickly, particularly at the bottom, and must therefore be renewed at shorter intervals than vessels of other materials.

Ice-boxes are useful for some things, but unless they are very large do not admit of the preservation of raw meat therein for want of ventilation.

71 CULINARY PROCESSES The following j^s/i can also be baked : Small cod, haddock, or mackerel, with a dust of flour and a basting of butter over them; eels, when large and stuffed; herrings in a brown pan with vinegar and a little spice, and tied over with paper. A hare, prepared as for roasting, basted with butter repeatedly, and placed in a pan with a little milk, will become nicely done. It may also be cut up and placed in a vessel and jugged. Lsgs and shins of heef, ox-cheeks, etc., garnished with onions, turnips, etc., take about four hours to cook; they are then allowed to get cool to have the fat skimmed off, after which they are warmed again and served. Baking in the small ovens of kitchens is not so successful as that in the bakerâ€™s oven. This arises in most cases from the faulty construction of the ovens, which, as we have already shown above, are mainly heated from the side, and have either no bottom heat at all or not enough of it. Further, most of these ovens are not ventilated, so that the fat which spirts on hot parts of the oven or dish, on being volatilized, taints the meat with its burnt grease taste, due to acroleine. Some cooks do not take sufficient care to clean, and keep clean, the oven, which is not rarely littered with charcoal, particularly that formed by the burning of overflowing fruit-juice from fruit-pies. On this particular subject masters and mistresses of private houses cannot bestow too much attention. The construction of ovens for baking has of late years undergone considerable modification. Amongst professed bakers and confectioners brick ovens are still most esteemed, as they allow many varying degrees of heat to be applied successively, or in different parts of the oven to very different preparations. But for special trades ovens of iron have been constructed which are provided with movable trays, enabling the baker to bring the component items of

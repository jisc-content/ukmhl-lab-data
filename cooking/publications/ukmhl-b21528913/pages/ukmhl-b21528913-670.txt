642 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY aided by one Fouret, has catalogued more than 900, and twice that number might be obtained by a careful scrutiny of culinary literature. There should be on the table, says the archimagirus, an entree of butcher’s meat, one of fowl, one of fish, one of game, and one of pastry. The table covered with entrees should be a small representative image of the varied pro- ductions of nature and art. Out of four entrees two were formerly, as the ‘ Almanach ’ has it, ‘ dedicated to truilles ’; one so treated was considered indispensable—‘ dans tout diner un peu soign4.’ By entrees are always meant mgoiits ; to give them variety, one half of them should be prepared with white, the other half with brown sauce; one half should be garnished with vegetables, the other half should be provided only with gravy or sauce {jus ou couUs). The same production should not be offered twice, though in different form, at dinner; if you had chickens in the first course, do not offer them in the second; for an elegant service requires variety, and that afforded by mere variation of preparation is not great enough. If you have had soles azo gratin, do not also offer them frites. If you had jugged hare, do not offer roast hare afterwards. But dressings or garnishes you may repeat on different materials. The service of entrees during the dinner should not be hurried, but each guest should have opportunity to eat of any dish, or of several preparations, as he pleases. Some fastidious culinary critics have raised the question wh?ther the entries should precede the relevis or follow them; this is apart from the discussion of the absolute distinction between a releve and an entree. The question is shortly answered in this way, that as relev^s, in English removes or joints, are frequently roasted, it is preferable to place them before the entr6es, so as not to let them be succeeded (in case they or one of them be roasted) by the

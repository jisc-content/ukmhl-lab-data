626 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY This last method is perhaps not to be advised for general use, as all that portion of thein, which is in coml)ination with tannin, and then very little soluble in cold water, and not even easily soluble in hot, will remain unextracted. But for producing tea with a minimum of astringency'the process is useful. The leaves of Yerha or Paraquay tea are always obtained in a powdered state. The powder is placed in a vessel made frequently of a coco-nut or pumpkin, and infused with boiling water ; the made tea is then sipped through a tube to which a sieve is attached, which is dipped into the vessel. It is sweetened, but not poured out into cups. To appreciate the true flavour of cliocolatl, as the Mexicans term it, obtain cacao-beans; roast them yourself until the shells break easily, peel the reddish-brown marrow, and pound and triturate it in a hot iron mortar. Boil the paste with milk and sugar, agitate, and after slight repose pour off the top liquid containing the finest particles. The sedi- ment you can triturate again, and treat as the first part was treated. The chocolate is then ready for use, but to develop its full flavour you should let it get cold, remove any fat collected on the surface, and after twelve hoursâ€™ standing heat it again in a water-bath. Chocolate is obtainable in many forms, in plates and as powder, with and without sugar. The powders, called cocoa, are generally reputed to be deprived of most of the natural fat. In exchange they are frequently adulterated with starch. Chocolate should be served in cups, and be of sufficient consistency to he eaten jyith a small spoon, rather than drunk. In this way it was used by the Mexicans; they also ate it with golden spoons. We have tested the combinations, and find chocolate in a red cup and saucer, to be eaten with a golden spoon, sesthetical perfection; both taste and sight are much pleased with the combination.

CO^^^OUND IC/iS .IN/) ICE PUDDINGS 5^3 bute imicli to tlie diminution of Â®stival gastric derange- ments. The juices most commonly used for such water ices are those of hmona, livies, oranges, ras2)berries, straioberries, gooseberries, currants, cherries [sweet and Kentish or Vistula), rhubarb, ijineapples, verjuice of muscatel grapes, mangos, apricots, peaches, greengages, mulberries. When any of the foregoing water ices are mixed with cream, for which the coloured ones are more particularly suitable, a new series of compounds arises, which we may term comjgound water ices. In a similar manner, when any of these ices are mixed with custard ice, or cream ice and custard ice at the same time, compound icater cream and custard ices arise, which are generally very complicated and rich preparations. Custard ices l)y themselves and cream ices by themselves are preferred to the compound ones for certain purposes. Some difficulty caused by the want of viscosity or substance in the fruit water ices has been overcome by the following variation, which we may call fruit purde ices. Fruit purees are more easily frozen than juices, and therefore easier to manage in the kitchen. There are used purees of almonds, ivalnuts, filberts, pis- tachios, and of several varieties of fruit, which, like apricots, quinces, peaches, and others, form jams of agreeable con- sistency and appearance. When such fruit purdes are mixed or combined with custard, cream, and cakes in pieces, the latter soaked in dilute liqueurs or wine, or with macroons or ratafias, the preparation becomes a so-called ice pudding. Ice puddings the highest complication of the several preparations of this class. They include as remarkable representatives a rice pudding transformed into an icy isonymic, compositions of Parisian and other cakes, of gaujj'res, macroons, and ratafias. Wo even see chestnuts as a basis of a complex pudding, and the black bread of West- phalia, Pumpernickel, assist in increasing by a forcible,

l^ROCESS OF FRYING, OR PHRYGOLOGY pounded rice or purde of rice, and mixed with yolk. Such combinations may be infinitely varied. Parsley, savory, sage, and other fine herbs, fried crisp, serve as additions to other frits ; we think, however, fried herbs more curious than tasty, and liable to introduce confusing elements. Connoisseurs have been related to have tested candidates for the office of chef by giving them herbs to fry; we ourselves should not attribute much importance to proficiency in this particular. Fritted fruits—e.g., plums, peaches, apples, quinces, oranges —require, like all tender mixtures of flour, milk, and eggs, an addition of sugar. They are eaten more for their taste than for nutrition. Most fritted viands are served by themselves, or with some lemon-juice only. On account of their prominent taste, they are mainly used as entrees. The breadcriimb with which it is intended to cover, by the adhesive mediation of beaten egg-yolk or batter, any viands about to be fried should be quite dry, and very finely powdered; if the bread taken be moist, the fried crust becomes uneven, or broken and detached. By this over- sight, uninformed or improvident cooks often spoil good materials. While frying has the advantage that it can be done quicker than any other mode of preparation by heat, it furnishes no sauce or gravy; and if such be required, it must be separately provided from extraneous sources ; or the fry may be strongly spiced, or, if suitable, covered with flavoured butter (of savory, of anchovies, parsley, or mush- rooms). The author of the ‘ Physiologie du Gout ’ has recorded a series of instructions, in the shape of an allocution, to his cook, Maitre Laplanche. His friends, he said, admitted him to be a 2>otagiste of the flrst order, but they observed that he was uncertain as a friturier. The incident which is said to have given rise to the allocution was the serving

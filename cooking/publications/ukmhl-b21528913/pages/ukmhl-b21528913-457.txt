PREPARATIONS OF BEEF 429 twenty pounds ; the, fourth and fifth ribs approach the first three in weight. Eibs are more frequently boned and rolled, and then can be roasted before a smaller fire or in an oven, but require more time to get done. The rump, or round, is divisible into two parts—the upper, which furnishes the best steaks, and is also used for roast- ing ; and the lower, or silver-side, which, like the undivided round, is mostly used for boiling, stewing, or braising. The aitch-bone, also spelled H-bone, edge-bone (being the ischiadic bone), is a portion of the pelvic bone with the meat attached ; this is also used for boiling and stewing, the former in a salted state. The brisket is the part between the shoulders and fore- legs with the breast-bone. It contains the remarkable and tasty body of firm fat called kernel; it is mostly used for boiling or stewing. The shoulder is the least esteemed part of the side, and most frequently stewed and boiled, and used for the pro- duction of gravy. The head of the ox is always divided in halves. The brain is not eatable. The rest is called ox-cheek, and braised or stewed. The tongue is one of the most delicate parts, and sold separately from the cheek. The tail of the ox is now a very expensive piece, its meat being paid for at a higher rate than rumpsteak. In the beginning of the century the tail was worth from sixpence to sevenpence only. Of the internal organs of the ox, called inside, the several stomachs and intestinal canal are boiled, and consumed under the name of tripe. The liver of the ox is not eatable for man, but given to dogs. The flesh of the thinner parts of the legs, shins, is mostly too hard and tendinous for roasting and boiling, and is used for the production of fresh beef-tea, broth, or gravy—hence called gravy beef.

381 I'A RIO US KINDS OF BREAD dextrine, partly fixed or insoluble, but can be made by secondary influence soluble entirely. A little alcohol remains in the bread, and evaporates slowly. When it is kept, baked bread undergoes a change, by which it becomes stale or rough, and thereby less appetizing to most people. This change is of some importance in cookery, as stale or dry bread is suitable for many operations for which fresh bread would be, or is supposed and stated to be, unsuitable. Bread contains on an average more than a third of its weight in the shape of water. Different observers have found in 100 parts 62’8 parts of dry bread to 37’2 of water; 63-7 to 36-3 ; 554 to 44-6; 64 to 36. 100 lb. of flour yield on an average 135. lb. of bread, the limits of variation being between 130 and 137‘7 lb. The so-called aerated bread made by the process of the late Dr. Dauglish is not subjected to fermentation, but is raised by air previously compressed somewhat by mechanical means. In it but little dextrine and sugar are formed, and the albuminoids are not much changed except by the heat- ing. Bread and cakes raised by baking-poxoder are made porous by carbonic acid evolved from carbonate or bicar- bonate of soda by an acid or an acid salt. Of acids, the tartaric is most commonly employed; of acid salts, the acid phosphate of lime, and alum. The phosphate and soda mixed intimately with flour produces the so-called self- raising floxLr, first imported from America, while alum and bicarbonate constitute the Norfolk baking-powder. Meat bread is wheaten bread with which a quantity of cooked and minced meat has been incorporated, in such a manner that it disappears from sight, and is dissolved in the crumb. Fresh dough will in this way assimilate an amount of meat corresponding to 1 lb. upon 2 lb, of flour. It will dissolve much more, up to 1 lb. of meat to the dough of 1 lb. of flour, but the bread is not so good. The bread is darker in colour than white wheat bread, has a

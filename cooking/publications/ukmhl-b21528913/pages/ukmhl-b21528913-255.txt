MADE SAUCES 227 velouU as base and type. In the production of these the essence of meat must not be too strong in itself, and the flavour of herbs must be kept subdued. The pronounced- tasting hroivn sauces, or esjoagnoles,may contain the maximum of herbaceous flavour, and a fair amount of spices. Piquant sauces are yet stronger appellants to the tongue and palate ; in them the savoury taste of broth falls to the background, and spices, aromatic herbs, and organic acids assume the ascendant. Meat gravy is best left by itself, without any addition except salt, and without any dilution except with a little broth in case it should be too concentrated. From this it follows that gravy, as it is obtained only in limited quantity, must also be served in small quantities; if it be concentrated enough, a thin covering of the morsel is sufficient to indue it with the taste sought for. Long gravies are made at the cost of quality by undue dilution, and whenever gravy is required in quantity it should be produced expressly from new materials. But iixQ made saiices, however practically concentrated the stock may be from which they are to be produced, require the addition of a material, by which their body is carried, made adhesive, transportable on the morsel, and unctuous on the tongue. This material is dextrine, a transformation product of starch, and starch itself, in brown sauces dextrine bereft of a portion of its constituent water, a caramel of dextrine. This material may be prepared in many ways, but in the kitchen is made by heating starch, or flour, in any available fat, butter, lard, or oil. In this process the fat only serves as a carrier of heat to a degree much exceed- ing the heat of boiling water ; it mostly takes no part in the subsequent stages of the cooking, and when the dextrin and dehydrated or brown dextrin are once produced, much trouble is taken to again remove the fat from the sauce pre- pared with its aid.

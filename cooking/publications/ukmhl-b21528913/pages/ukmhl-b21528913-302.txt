Whipped Cream toith Fruit is highly esteemed in many forms; the fruit as pur6e is mixed with one-quarter of its weight of powdered sugar, and to this mixture an equal volume of cream-froth is added and well incorporated with it. In case the fruit puree be too juicy to remain coalescent, it should be placed on slices of sponge-cake, or on lady’s fingers, which will absorb the liquid part, and keep the body of the cream in a solid state.

A milk or emulsion of almonds, or nuts, is mixed with boiling cream suitably sweetened; to this a con- centrated solution of gelatine is added (in the proportion of 1 oz. to the quart), the whole passed through a tammy, and put in moulds to set.

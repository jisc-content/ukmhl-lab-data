652 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERV admitted of careful preparation of the food, and there was no lack of good red country wine, and therefore disease had very little chance of spreading. It was different in the lines round Metz, where the soldiers had mostly to cook in the open air under the greatest difficulties, and were badly quartered ; here typhus and dysentery assumed cowards the end of the siege threatening proportions; but as soon as, after the fall of Metz, the besieging troops marched towards the north of France and towards the Loire, they obtained good quarters and good supplies of food, and the infectious diseases disappeared. The ordinary cooking of soldiers in the field does not in any way satisfy the hygienic demands which we have for- mulated above; on the contrary, it is so unmethodical that it forms a strange contrast to all the other well-arranged military proceedings. When the cooking-pits are dug into the ground, and the provisions are distributed, every man pushes towards the fire and endeavours to find a place ; the sergeants no longer practise any kind of supervision ; a con- fusion arises which leads to deterioration and loss of food. Thus, a man cooking has just lifted up the cover of his tin pan, when another puts a handful of green wood under the pan, and causes thick smoke to impart its flavour to the contents of the pan. Another will take his kettle from the gallows on which three other kettles are suspended, and does it so clumsily that all three kettles lose a great part of their contents. While one man, whose kettle is boiling hard and running over, desires the fire to be less, his neighbour, who has only just arriv'ed with a kettle full of cold water or other contents, makes as big a blaze as he possibly can. Most of the soldiers thus trying to cook have no idea at all of the manner in which the food distributed to them ought to be prepared. If at home they have perchance learned to boil potatoes, while they are with the regiment they learn nothing at all about cooking; most of them take little trouble

THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 138 tion is always effected at the expense of a good deal of flavour, and of course of work, and should be dispensed with by all persons who value taste before appearance. It may be effected as follows : Beat three whites of egg into a froth, and incorporate it with the glace; add some lemon- juice ; whisk the mixture over the fire until the white of egg is well curdled; set aside for a quarter of an hour, then strain through a cloth into a basin, and keep for use. In this recipe the browning of the broth, by which it becomes gravy, is effected at two periodsâ€”once during the frying of the meat, and a second time during the evapora- tion to a glace of a deep red-brown colour. If six pints of standard broth were used to immerse 14 lb. of meat, and another six to dilute the consomme, there should be obtained eight or ten pints of gravy, supposing the meat to have been pressed in a screw-press. This would be ready for sauces, but for soups would require dilution to a volume of twelve quarts; each pint would then contain the soluble extract of \ lb. of beef, and the quantity would be suflBcient to yield excellent soup for forty-eight persons. Beef-broth from the Pot-au-Feu of Smaller French Households. The name of iM-au-feu, as used in older French culinary writings, applies to a mixture of various kinds of meat and vegetables all stewed together after the manner of the ancient oille, or olid of the Spaniards. But the name as here used applies to a mixture of beef and vegetables l)oiled with a relatively large amount of water, the main object being evidently the production of a considerable amount of broth to be further developed into soup. We quote recipes in themselves very old, to sliow that they are still in use with all their virtues and faults unaltered; one is for a 2)ot-au-fcu with about 3 lb. of beef, called the lorye ; and

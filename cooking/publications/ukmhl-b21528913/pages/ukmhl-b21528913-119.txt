91 SALINE CONDIMENTS Classification of Condiments. In the following pages we have attempted a classification of condiments for the purpose of obtaining some kind of order in which the materials may be grouped. We have included culinary colouring matters, although only one of them is actually an aromatic substance, because they are most frequently used in combination with condiments. First Group : Saline Condiments. Common Salt {Chloride of Sodium).—Salt is not only a condiment, but also a mineral food, essential to the neutrali- zation in the human body of the efiects of the large quan- tities of potassium salts introduced in vegetable food. It is for this reason that vegetable feeders, or so-called vege- tarians, require relatively more salt with their food, par- ticularly potatoes, than flesh-eaters. Similarly, herbivora seek salt, and like it, while carnivora never do. But when we observe how small are the quantities which herbivorous animals, e.g., horses or deer, obtain from day to day, or that many, e.g., cattle and deer in some parks, never obtain any, we cannot believe that it is essential to them as food, but is sought by them mainly as a spice, for the sake of its impression upon the sense of taste. A German professor of so-called physiological chemistry asserts that ‘ we ’ (meaning society at large) ‘ are accustomed to take far too much salt with our viands.’ This is, perhaps, only partly true for portions of the Continent, but is certainly not so for Eng- land, where dishes of all kinds are only slightly salted, and the final conditioning of each morsel is left to the individual consumer. We recommend cooks to adhere to this well- established practice, and rather to under than over salt their productions ; they should also take care to retnove by judicious soaking in water all superfluous salt from salted provisions, which, like haras or salt fish, are preserved in an excess of the mineral condiment.

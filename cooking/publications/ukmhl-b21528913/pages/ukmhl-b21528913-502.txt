THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 474 are generally used for pasties, after having been two or three days in the larder. Buck venison is in greatest per- fection from midsummer to Michaelmas, and doe from November to January. A Buck TImmch generally weighs from 20 to 25 lb., and, when covered with oiled paper and paste, will require four and a half hours’ roasting, in cold weather more. When it is done the envelopes are removed, and the outside is dredged over and frothed. It is sent to table with a strong brown gravy and red currant jelly, or a sauce made from it. Of other preparations we have Venison Steaks, plain-broiled; Venison Fry, of which liver and sweetbread are principal ingredients; Haunch of Venison, braised, after having been larded; Scollops or Kehohs, and Civet, Pasty, etc. The joints of Red Deer undergo analogous preparations. Faion of Falloio Deer is treated like lamb, and roasted in quarters, or made into hash and civet. As a dish for show it used also to be roasted entire. The Roe Deer is the most delicately flavoured of the three varieties of venison from deer, and, like Welsh mutton, is very suitable for filleting. It is always finely larded, marinaded, braised, and given in a savoury espagnole sauce. It is also quickly cooked, a loin or saddle requiring three-quarters of an hour’s baking in the oven, or an hour’s braising, to become done. It should not be cooked too long, as prolonged heating makes the meat dry. Cutlets, scollops, haricots, civets, roasts, are all prepared like those of fallow deer. Wiirtemberg is the country where roe deer is yet frequent; in former times this mountainous country abounded also in red deer; the royal coat of arms bears a pair of stag’s antlers.

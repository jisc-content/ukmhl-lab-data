5o8 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY with slices of bacon and an oiled paper, and bake them in a French field or country stove so called { fourde cainpagne), or in an oven. Various other preparations are characterized by a ragout or sauce only. Buffs, the males, and reeves, the females, of the species tringa (in French le combattant), are best towards the end of May. They are caught in nets, kept in boxes and fattened, and then roasted or fried like larks. Quails, French cailles, are also migratory birds, breeding in temperate latitudes, and wintering in more southerly climes. The European quails spend the winter mainly in Africa. When in early autumn they arrive from the north in the southern parts of Europe, they are mostly in excel- lent condition. The flocks, which comprise thousands of individuals, consist mainly of young birds. After their arrival they are chased by sportsmen as well as the people, â€¢and thousands are slain, with sticks or shot, and snared or netted ; and it is for this wholesale destruction that the German peasant unwittingly preserves and surrounds with a halo of sanctity the nests and young of the revered Wachtel. Again, when the quails return from Africa and land exhausted on islands or peninsulas of the northern Mediterranean, they meet with the same reception. In the spring of 1894 a steamer of the French Messageries from Alexandria carried 90,000 quails in boxes. The ship being delayed by adverse weather, the food provided proved insufficient, and several thousands of birds died of starvation before reaching Marseilles. By the common consent of gastronomers, quail is never cooked in any other way than as roast in a paper case {rotie en papillote); its flavour is very volatile, and when- ever the bird is brought in contact with liquid, the perfume evaporates and is lost. For the oiled paper case a thin envelope of bacon may be substituted, with a vine-leaf applied to the breast. A vine-leaf underneath the bacon is

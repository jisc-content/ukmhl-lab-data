278 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY Of grits (of rice, or wheat) three parts will produce the same solidity of the flummery as tivo parts of starch. Of buckwheat a greater proportion is required than of grits, and of millet a greater one than of buckwheat. These latter cereals will be less used where rice and wheat are freely accessible, but many an opulent man on the Baltic would think his red grits imperfect if it were not made of buckwheat. Sago would give an imperfect flummery unless it were very much boiled, or mixed from the beginning with some binding starch. The same observation applies to tapioca. The liguid by means of which the floury base may be swelled into the colloid body may be milk, or even cream, or fruit piice. A milk fitommery may be harmonized by an egg sauce, but is best relished with a contrasting fruit juice sauce, while inversely a fruit-juice flummery is best relished with a vxilk custard or cream sauce, or with cream only. The harmonious or contrasting flavouring of flummery and sauce must be attended to. Cold Puddings. In some cookery-books a number of dishes are placed under the heading of flummery which, although they may have some features in common with it, are nevertheless peculiar ; they are sometimes treated of under the name of Cold Sioeet Dishes. They are in reality Cold Puddings, and under this name we propose to consider them. They are not merely ordinary puddings which have become cold, but such as require exposure to a low temperature before they acquire the consistency or quality which entitles them to he called puddings. Cold Milk Bice is the most popular of these dishes, as a French novelist testified, who found it, in conjunction with prunes, on every hotel table in Switzerland. It may be mixed in strata with fruit pulp, such as apples, or cheese

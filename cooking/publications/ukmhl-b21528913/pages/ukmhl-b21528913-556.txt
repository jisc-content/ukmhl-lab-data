THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 52S Halibut is a flat fish which attains large dimensions, and is sold in slices by the pound; it may be boiled, baked, fried, or cooked gently in oil. Similar remarks apply to the shatc, syn. onaid, or ray (French raie); some appreciate the fin part, which becomes gelatinous by boiling. The dab (French Iwiande) is rarely met with in England; it should be treated like plaice. The sturgeon grows and lives a great part of its life in the seaâ€”the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and the Caspian. It ascends the rivers for spawning at certain seasons, and is then taken and used for food. From the Caspian it ascends the Volga; from the Black Sea it travels up the Danube to near Vienna; from the Mediter- ranean it visits the Proven9e by the Rhone; and here it was taken in such numbers in the sixteenth century that it was paid for only at the rate of a sous a pound. The fish is killed by blows on the head with heavy clubs, and subse- quent removal of the spinal marrow ; this is made into pates. The roe is preserved in salt, and becomes caviar.

It is a so-called royal fish, every such fish swimming in any river in England belonging to the Sovereign, and when taken having to be delivered to him ; the only exception to this law are sturgeons taken in the Thames, which belong to the Lord Mayor of London. The sturgeon attains a length of 20 feet, and in weight may exceed 300 lb. Sturgeon may be broiled, after having been cut in slices and freed from skin and fat, which latter, when heated, produces a disagreeable flavour. The broiling may take place in an oiled paper envelope. It may be stujfcd and roasted, larded, or spitted with strips of eel or anchovies, much like veal; it may be plain-boiled, or baked and braised; tlie latter form requires a previous marinading, removal of skin, and several flavouring herbs; the braised form may I>e

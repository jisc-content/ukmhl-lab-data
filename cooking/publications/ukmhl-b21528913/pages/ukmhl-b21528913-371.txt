THE CABBAGE TRIBE 343 used in the white or etiolated state. In this condition it is a very neutral vegetable, of a feeble flavour, but agreeably juicy. It is remarkable as being a soda-plant, so called because in its ash soda compounds prevail greatly over potash compounds. Such plants are found almost ex- clusively near the seashore, or in salty steppes, or near salt springs and salt works. Seakale is mostly eaten plain- boiled with white sauce, but is much enriched in taste by some gravy or coulis. The varieties of products of the cabbage tribe require much consideration on the part of a magiric writer. Brmsels-sprouts and cauliflower are mostly overboiled in common practice, and assume a mashy condition, which spoils both their appearance and taste.

Brussels- sprou,ts are best with gravy when hot, but when cold are suitably accommodated with oil and vinegar. Gaulifloioer associates well with white, or Dutch, sauce; a more accomplished form is obtained with the aid of a fondue, consisting of bechamel or veloute, with Parma cheese, butter, yolk, glace, and spices, all stirred in a casserole, and poured over the cauliflower.

Even a schistose arrangement may be given to this dish by alternating layers of savoy-leaves with strata of farce, and rolling the whole in an elongated

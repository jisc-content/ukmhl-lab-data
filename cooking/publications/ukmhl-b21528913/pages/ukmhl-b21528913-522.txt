The best stuffing for a goose are small Dutch, or finger, potatoes, sliced fine, salted and peppered, and mixed with the kidney and caul fat from the interior of the goose, finely chopped, or half their weight of suet or scraped bacon. The same treatment is applicable to chestnuts when used to stuff a goose. Some farce or sausage meat may be mixed with them to increase their taste. The practice of eating aj)j)le sauce with goose has given rise to a particular kind of stuffing, described by Soyer, in which the apples and the sage and onions are blended with grated boiled potatoes, A sharp sauce for roast goose, described by Ignotus and Kitchiner, which was to be poured into the body of the goose, called by the former ' a secret worth knowing,â€™ was evidently appreciated by these authors. A goose may be braised in the plain or stuffed condition ; when well done it practically becomes roast goose, but admits of being made more juicy. Steived Goose may be immersed in an acidulous and savoury jelly or aspic. If the meat be boned it adds to the convenience of the cook as well as the consumer. Where, as in the lake districts of North Germany, hundreds of thousands of geese are annually reared to serve as human food, a great variety of preparations have to be employed to make the several parts of the animals eatable and transportable in a preserved state. The breast is mostly pickled and smoked, and sold as Pomeranian Goose Breast. It is eaten raw in thin slices, like Westphalian ham, with bread-and-butter, and is of excellent taste. The livers are transformed into pat6s. The other pieces of the geese are transformed into a pickled and stewed prepara- tion, which is preserved in fat, and consumed gradually during the winter. {Pbkel-Gans pickled goose.) A similar mode of curing, cooking, and preserving is practised at Bayonne in France.

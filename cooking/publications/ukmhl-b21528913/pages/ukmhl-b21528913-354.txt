326 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY colour should suspend in the water a little hag containing woodash, equal in size to a hen’s egg, or should dissolve in it a pinch of carbonate of potash. The central flowers, the aggregate of which is called ‘ hay,’ are removed, after the boiling and immersion in cold water, with the blunt end of the handle of a small spoon. The artichoke tops are then again heated in the salt water, sent to table on a napkin, and served with white, blonde, or Dutch sauce. Skiffed Artichohes are of four qualities, characterized by the nature of the farce placed on their bottoms, and will enable the reader to appreciate some of the subtle distinctions of French culinary art. The plain stuffed are in favour for fast days, those with rich farce for ordinary use. Arti- chokes a la Barigoiile also go by the name of a la D' Uxelles. They are baked filled with farce, and accompanied with Italian sauce. Those a la demi-Barigoule are stewed in a savoury coulis, and those d la vraie Barigoule are first fried (rissole), and then braised. Artichokes are also fried in hatter, being suitably dressed, or in hot batter with savoury herbs, French sa^it&s, or baked in oil, etc., a la Provengale. The boiled artichoke may also be eaten cold with oil or pepper sauce. The recipes occurring in French culinary works under the titles of Artichauts axe gras, a la Lyonnaise, farcis d la Grimod de la ReyyiiHre, and h VItalienne, are all contained in principle in the Barigoule or D’Uxelles form. Grimod’s recipe alone includes massive fried onions in the farce for the artichoke, and grated cheese. Nearly all the re- cipes ascribed to the editor of the ‘ Almanach des Gourmands ’ exult in onions and cheese, and this practice the author of the ‘ M6moires de Madame de Crequi,’ an enthusiastic magirist, applauded. At that time the French kitchen was decidedly deteriorated by what history has shown to have been a gust of coarse predilections and idle afi'ectation.

THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 15S breadcrusts. In France onion soups, and, as a sequence, sauces and ragouts, not rarely pass by the name of h la Souhise, and of this manner a white and a brown variety are generally distinguished. On account of the strong and aromatic taste of fried onion, it is a favourite material with which to prepare soups for fast-days, so-called potages maigres, and this accounts for the existence of a great number of recipes in literature. The following are typical examples : White Onion Soicp au Gras.—This soup is made with 'Spanish onions gently fried in butter, first by themselves, then with flour, so as to form a roux, or thickening material; the body of the liquid should be standard broth. Bread in any of the various forms above described may be added to it in the tureen; some grated cheese, Gruyere or Parmesan, may be handed round with it; the cheese imparts a savour when broth is absent. White Onion Soup au Maigre.—With this no broth, but only decoction of haricot beans or water, may be employed. Some pass the onions and bread through a tammy, and thus produce a puree. Onion Soup a la Stanislas with Crusts.—This soup is named after the qiionda^n King of Poland, who ate of it in an inn at Chalons, and preserved the recipe. Much of the success of this form depends upon the prepara- tion of the crusts of bread. Break the upper crust of a loaf of bread in pieces, make them hot in the oven, rub them over with butter, grill them gently in the oven, or before the fire, or in the sauta-pan, and put them into a plate. Then produce the onion soup, allowing 10 gnu. of raw onion for each person who has to partake of the soup; the onions are to be fried. The soup may be made with or without broth, aud be served as it comes, or after having passed tbe tammy. It is spiced with tincture of pepper in the tureen.

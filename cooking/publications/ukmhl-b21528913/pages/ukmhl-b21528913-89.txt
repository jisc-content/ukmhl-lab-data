Hold a review of all articles once a quarter by the light of the inventory. ‘ Wyvern ’ desires that we should hold a weekly inspection of cooking utensils, and make liberal allowance for breakage, but be severe about con- cealment.

All q2tantities of materials prescribed for use in dishes to be prepared being relative, may or must be varied pro- portionately according to the number of persons for whose use the dish is intended. All dishes, before being sent to table, must be arranged in the most careful, neat, elegant, and therefore pleasing manner.

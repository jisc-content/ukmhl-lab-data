Tllli SPIRIT OF COOKERY â€˜36 silk tammy, or a napkin, into pans, and place it in the larder for use. This consommd may be used for sauces directly, but is a great deal too strong for soups; to be used in these it requires dilution with at least two parts of water or thin stock, so as to constitute one-third of the volume of the finished soup. Such good soup as this is practically no- where obtained except in philosophical households which conserve atavistic traditions; more particularly, it is never obtained in the modern restaurant or hotel or club, where, on the contrary, some very dilute colour and tasteless liquids are given out in soup-plates under the completely false name of consomme ; when made into thick soup with any puree or flour, the broth disappears as well, and the result is non- descript insipidity. To this recipe we have further to observe that the beef and veal, in order to be extracted completely, should be passed through the mincing-machine, either raw, before going into the stock-pot, or after it has been boiled to facili- tate the mincing, and should be pressed in a screw press after the consomme has been filtered off. The bones of the knuckles of veal might be removed before boiling to save space. We may assume that the whole of the meat will amount to 47 lb., out of 58 lb. with bones; if twenty quarts of standard broth be added at the beginning, and twenty for dilution of the consomm6, there ought to result at least forty quarts, or ten gallons of consomm6, allowing all the water furnished by the meat to have evaporated. These forty quarts would represent the extract of 127 lb. of meat, with the extracts of the vegetables, the quantities of which are not prescribed, added. If the proportion prescribed for the French household i^oi- au-jm discussed below were observed, the compound would require at least a hundred- weight of vegetables, but practically nothing like this quantity is ever taken. One pint of the consommd, diluted

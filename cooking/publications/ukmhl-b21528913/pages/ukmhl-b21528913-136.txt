THE SPIRIT OF COOKER! io8 dry distillation, a process in which all further scientific inquiry, which had begun so promisingly, perished. The watery distillate of the extract of beef had the flavour of bouillon of beef. Ten years after Geoffrey’s ‘ Memoir ’ was published the following recipe for ‘ Extract of Meat in Dry Tablets, which can ha easily transported and preserved during a year and longer.’* These tablets dissolved in water form grand bouillon, and are made as follows : Take a quarter of an ox, an entire calf, or part of one if it be large, two sheep, and two dozen of old hens or cocks; prepare all in the usual manner; parboil and clean the feet of the calf and sheep, remove all visible fat, and put the whole in a large copper ; add the decoction already prepared of from 12 Ib. to 15 lb. of hartshorn shavings ; cover the meat, etc., with spring water, and cover the boiler, weighting the lid with 60 lb. Let the meat boil over a gentle fire quietly, without skimming, during six hours or more, until all meat is thoroughly done and all soft parts are easily detached from the bones. Eemove the large bones, leaving all the rest on the fire; take out all the meat, mince it, and put it into a great press with (hotted) iron plates, to extract all juice. Eeturn the pressed-out liquid to the bouillon in the caldron, pass all through a horsehair tamis; let cool, and remove the fat. You can now salt and spice the bouillon; continue to boil while constantly stirring it, until a portion placed on a cold plate sets to a jelly, and the extract becomes thick like honey and brown in colour. Take it off the fire, let it cool somewhat, and put it into glazed earthenware vessels of a long and flat shape (pans) not exceeding three inches in depth. When the extract has become cold, set it to dry in a closet or a baker’s oven after the bread has been removed, taking care not to let it get either roasted or burned, hut * La Chapelle, ‘Le Cuisinier Moderne,’ vol. i., p. 84, 1742.

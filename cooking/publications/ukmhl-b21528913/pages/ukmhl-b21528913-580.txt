552 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY frequently infected; they inaj^ then be stewed, or with other fish worked into a matelote. The eel (French angidlle, German AaT) is the hero of many fables. The Egyptians revered it as a deity, and Athenaeus termed it a daughter of Jupiter. It delights to live in muddy waters, provided it can reach the clear also. It may attain an enormous sixe, the largest specimens having been obtained in Scotland, Poland, and Italy. The sexes are not easily distinguished; the eggs are microscopically small, and are hatched in the sea or in estuaries ; the fry ascends rivers in continuous shoals of enormous lengths. The eel on its back has a brownish-blue colour; its belly is of silvery white when it has access to flowing water; on the other hand, eels of marshes or confined tanks have an earthy colour on the under side. Their partiality for mud is great, probably because they find their food in it; this causes them to taste muddy—that is to say, to impart a flavour to the mouth which reminds of the smell of mud in marshes and tanks; to free them from it, it is necessary to make them live for some days in clean water frequently renewed or aerated. The eel may be killed by pithing. It is generally skinned, for not only is the skin hard, tough, and dark-coloured, but there is also just underneath it an oily fat, which is not of good taste, and not always digestible. The skin may be pulled off after it has been loosened at the neck by a circular incision, or been made to blister and become loose by the eel being externally grilled over a charcoal fire. The Jews do not eat eel, probably on account of its similai’ity to a serpent, which they formerly worshipped, as the Egyptians did the eel. There are four distinct sorts of eel—the snhj, the hroud- noscd, the grig, and the sharp-nosed; the latter is the kind generally known. The London markets are supplied with eels principally from Holland.

132 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY all glue for the arts should be made from bones, freed from phosphatic earth by hydrochloric acid. But he seems to have shared to a large extent the errors of Devaux, and although he was in his confidence provoked a concurrence (f.c., competition) of his (D’Arcet’s) gelatine with the hoxdllon d’os. He recommended* the use of gelatine made by this process for the preparation of soup in hospitals, poor-houses, and dispensaries, and to reduce the meat by three - quarters of its former weight; he pretended to replace (!) every pound of meat by 5 gros of gelatine, but added ‘ vegetables.’ The following were the proportions of ingredients : 50 litres of water, 12 lb. of meat, lb. of dry gelatine, 4 lb. of salt, 16 to 20 lb. of vegetables and spices; total, 192 rations of bouillon, at the cost of 8 c. each, 4 fr. being allowed for the value of the boiled meat (bouilli). Differences of opinion on the quality of such broth led to its abandonment.! Chevreul properly taxed Devaux with using illogical argu- ment in this, that he condemned all broth and bouilli of meat, but recommended roast meat, and yet the bouillon and bouilli together as eaten do not contain more gelatine than the roast meat. How can it be explained, exclaimed this savant, that a man of such inferior quality as Cadet Devaux can reap such external success from all classes, municipalities, princes. King, and Pope ? It was, he replied, because his sham science proceeded under the mask of jphilanlhroinc 'professions, which all these patrons made it a business ostentatiously to support. In 1831 the Academy of Sciences of Paris appointed a commission consisting of Magendie, Serres, Dupuytren, D’Arcet, Chevreul, Klourens, and Serullas. Its first per- formance was an examination of the Bouillon dc la Comjxujnic Hollandaisc, founded by MM. Bouwens and * In the 'Aim. de Ohiin.,’ t. 92, p. 300 ; 1810. t Merat and Duluns, ‘Diet. Mat.

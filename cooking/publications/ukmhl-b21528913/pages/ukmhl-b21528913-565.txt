HISTORY AXD PREPARATIONS OF HERRING 537 who died in 1449. The Dutch raised a mausoleum to his memory, and it is related that Charles V. visited it in 1536. The trade of the Dutch in herrings taken on the coasts of Great Britain and Ireland in 1610 amounted to the value of more than two and a half millions sterling. While living the herring is green over its back, white on flanks and belly; on the dead herring the back becomes blue. The fish ranges from high northern latitudes to 45° lat. N. From June 25 there appear in the Dutch seas the herring flashes, caused by the reflection of the sunlight from the shoals or banks of herrings which fill the water for miles. A female herring may contain more than 60,000 eggs. There are seven females for every two males. The finest and best prepared bloaters (harengs saurs of the French) were the saurets of Germath in Ireland {Hareng saicr and saitret = smoked herring, horn saurer, to smoke). They were smoked with juniper wood. Herrings are now brought to market occasionally almost fresh. In that state they are very delicate, and may be prepared for the table by being boiled. Six herrings require two quarts of hot water and a quarter of a pound of salt; boil for twenty minutes, and send Dutch or allemande sauce with them. The fat under the skin of the herring, like that of the sprat, is never of good taste, and should, if possible, be extracted. This is best done bj’ broiling the fish, whether it be fresh, or salted, or smoked. Soyer {loc. cit. 143) signifi- cantly observes that herrings certainly could be crumbed and fried, but scarcely any person would like them. This would be perfectly true if the eater were to attempt to eat the crust with the meat, as he does in the case of sole or smelt; but let him skin the crumbed and fried herring, and then pick the fillets off the skeleton, and he will find the flesh delicate and pure ; the oil has been absorlied by and removed with the skin and the crust over it.

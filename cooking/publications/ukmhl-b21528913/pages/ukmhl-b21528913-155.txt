127 BOUILLON, OR MEAT-BROTH fat flows out, and the membrane sinks to the bottom : such browned membranes are termed grcdvcs or grieves. Care should be taken by cooks that the fat which they leave on joints to be roasted or boiled be of good taste; thus some fat of sheep has naturally a tallowy taste, and requires to be eliminated. The fat of some fishes, e.g., herrings, sprats, has at times a taste of train-oil, which can only be removed by grilling the fish. Vecll contains the least amount of fat, less than one quarter of the weight of the flesh ; a fat ox has from twenty to twenty-five parts of fat upon forty parts of pure muscular tissue, or more than half the weight of the flesh ; a fat sheep has more fat (thirty-two) than flesh (thirty) ; a fat hog similarly will show fat to muscle as forty to thirty-seven. , Of fish, salmon, eels, and sprats are distinguished by much j fat; cod, turbot, sole, by the minimum of fat as compared to flesh ; the liver of the cod, on the other hand, is very rich in fat. The large marine mammals, such as lohales, are reservoirs of enormous masses of fat, and this becomes the cause of their gradual extinction by man’s hands. A chicken or pheasant may be fattened up so as to contain 10 per cent, of fat; partridges never have more than,, and seldom as much as, per cent, of fat. Geese, by cramming, can be made to accumulate considerable masses of fat under their skin, in the abdominal cavity, and in the liver. Note on the History of Researches concerning Gelatine and its Use for Food, and of the Romance of the Bouillon d’Os. The earliest scientific note on gelatine occurs in D. Papin’s work.* He obtained gelatine by boiling bones in his digester, i.e., under pressure, and therefore under higher temperatures than that of boiling water; when the heat was too great the gelatine was weaker, and, as he believed, Papin, Denys, ‘ The Manner of softening Bones and cooking all Sorts of Meat in a Short Time, and at little Cost.’ 1682.

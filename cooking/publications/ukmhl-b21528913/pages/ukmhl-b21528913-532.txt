504 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY de Orequi ’ advised that they should be larded and barded, i.e., roasted in an envelope of thin slices of bacon. But Vuillemot opposed this, as he did the larding of all game. According to Vincent Leblanc, there are in Bengal white partridges of larger size than the European gray ones. The recl-lcgged iMrtridge, which is very common in the South of Europe, is little larger than the gray, and in our opinion equally good to eat. But different persons have different predilections, and the question, in itself irrelevant, which of the two varieties is culinarily preferable, will probably never be decided. The recipes for cooking apply equally to both. We may have them roast, stewed, fried, braised, with various supports, such as mushrooms, cepes, or truffles ; or they may be egged, crumbed, and grilled (d la crapaudine). They may be dressed as salmis, or as breasts or fillets. These latter pass under all the forms and names under which the fillets of fowls and pheasants are presented. The boudins complete the list. Woodcock, in French b&casse, and its smaller varieties, snipe (bicassine) and sandpiper {b&casseau; this last name is also used for young woodcock), are the most important of paludal dark-fleshed birds, and much coveted by the lovers of good fare and sportsman’s dishes. In the middle of Europe it occurs as a bird of passage, spending the winter in Africa, and breeding in summer in northern latitudes or mountainous regions, such as the Alps and Pyrenees.

It is always better during frosty weather or in autumn ; it must be kept for some time after it has been shot. It can be roasted on the spit, wrapped in slices of bacon, but must not be over-done. Some, indeed, like the bird very much underdone, and direct that it should

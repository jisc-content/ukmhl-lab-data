THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 208 off the bones, and, having minced them, put them back into the broth. Ox-clicck Sotip is an elongated ragout. Deer’s-heacl Soup is the same. Only the heads of young deer are suitable for it. It may be useful where deer are plentiful; then it is sometimes prepared cV la chasseitr. Calfs-head or Mock-turtle Soup is an imitation of turtle soup; but as calf’s-head soup it can well hold its place, without comparison with an expensive luxury. But it is sometimes made a mockery of even mock-turtle by having distributed in it the flaps of skin of calf’s feet, and even pig’s feet. Its French name is properly ptotacje de tete de veau ‘ en torhie. ’ * The preparation resolves itself into boiling the calf’s head, and cutting it up suitably ; into preparing the soup, and uniting both in the turOen. Care must be taken not to let this soup become a mockery of good taste in cook- ing. A culinary authoress advises the addition to the calf’s head of a pig’s snout and ears, an ox-palate, and a smoked tongue; small sausages, minced sweetbread, veal quenelles, chopped hard-boiled eggs, oysters, half a bottle of Madeira wine, and two tablespoonfuls of English soy. We believe this recipe to be a literary brag, one of those coarse attempts to acquire by writing a false appearance of magniflcence— as has been well said by Dumas, a recipe which is not likely ever to be put in practice anywhere. A variation is Clear Calf’s-head or Mock-turtle Soup. Sheep's-head Soup is a laborious preparation of which sheep's head forms only a small part, and sheep's pluck another. On account of this pluck in its composition it has also been called heroic soup. But it would be but poor fare for man if it were not improved by adventitious ingredients. On the whole, it is not a very practical pre- paration. Welsh or Puj’s-head Soup is to be made of a pig’s head * The nuine-pota;je fausse tortue is modern bad French.

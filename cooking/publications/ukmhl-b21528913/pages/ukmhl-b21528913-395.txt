CROUSTADES 367 mould, or crust of the croustade. This mould now receives a lining of puff paste, and with this is baked a second time, either with the forcemeat in its interior and the lid or cover on, or by itself without any meat in its cavity. Croustades may be served with forcemeat only, or garnished with boned quails, larks, or other small birds. Of so-called ‘ croustades ’ described by some French culinary authors, some have no title to this name at all: thus, one named a lafinancihre is a mere pate; those aux triijfes a surprise are mere boiled truffles excavated and filled with farce; that a la carcassonne is a mere pigeon pie, of which the pigeon has been previously stewed as ragout. Croustades are curiosities even for the French them- selves, owing to the spelling of their name ; for crusts of bread, whether produced during the process of baking, or by additional toasting or frying, in French are croiUes, and the elision of the s is indicated by the circumflex accent. How, then, does it come that this s survives in croustades ? Perhaps because they are a revival of the Italian crustini and crustadinos. Croustades as we have known them attempted in some establishments involve two dangers : the first one is waste, as the fried bread sculptures mostly remain uneaten ; and in the so-called ‘ ornamental croustades of bread ’ are never intended to be eaten ; the second one is that in pretentious places which cater for the ignorant masses things will be served as croustades which are mere commonplace pates, and ought to be called so, and not pass under an alias intended to represent the unknown as magnificent. The croustade is a multiple waste, firstly of labour on the part of the cook, secondly of bread and lard used in frying, and thirdly of the quenelle forcemeat with which the croustade is coated or lined inside, and baked again, before the entree is put in ; this lining is to prevent the sauce from pene- trating into and through the fried bread. It is much better

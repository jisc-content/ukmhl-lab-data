345 SAUER-KRAUr starch ; this starch, when the kale is allowed to become frozen and to thaw, is immediately transformed into sugar, like a portion of the starch in frozen potatoes, and then the vegetable becomes sometimes rather too sweet. Of nitro- genized matters white cabbage contains nearly 2 per cent., of solids altogether about 10 per cent., and 9 per cent, of water. This variety bears the names of Brassica oleracea capitata alba, Al. The sugar contained in it consists partly of dextrose, partly of inosite; of the latter we have given some account under the paragraph relating to green beans. For the production of sauer-Tcraut the cabbage is shredded, mixed with salt in fine powder sufficient to produce a good pickle,â€™ placed in a vessel, e.g., a barrel, in a compressed state, and allowed to undergo the lactic-acid or sour-milk fer- mentation ; the sugar is thus transformed into lactic acid, and from this the produce derives its name of acid cabbage, or sour cabbage, or sauer-kraut. As a preparation for cook- ing, the sauer-kraut has to be washed, and thus relieved of excess of acid ; it is then to be stewed with butter, or other tasty fat, and standard broth, and when nearly done a little good wine should be added. There are many variations of this process, which mostly result in a somewhat coarser product; there are also many combinations, but the acme of all accompaniments, not excepting even roast pheasant, is roast p>artridge with sauer-kraut. French ChoxicrotUe, or Bavarian Kraut, is an imitation of sauer-kraut, produced from fresh white cabbage by the addition of vinegar. Steep the cabbage in a solution of salt in vinegar for some hours; after that drain and wash, and stew as in the previous case. The cabbage, being finely shred, absorbs sufficient acid to possess the taste of its prototype. The Germans call this forced sauer-kraut.

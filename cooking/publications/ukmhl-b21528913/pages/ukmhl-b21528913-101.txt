73 CULINARY PROCESSES lower eud, first iu one and then in an opposite direction with great precision; the heat is condensed upon the meat by a parabolic screen of tin-plate ; the whole constitutes an effectual arrangement for joints up to 22 lb., provided the jack be of sufficient size and power. Smaller pieces of meat, such as beef or rump steaks, chops, and fish, have to be roasted on an instrument called a grill, an originally French name for a frame made of crossed or parallel bars, and hence meat so done is called grilled. In this process of grilling most of the gravy which exudes is lost, but this is not much, as the meat retains the greater part and is most juicy.

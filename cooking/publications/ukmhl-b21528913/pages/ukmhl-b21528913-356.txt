328 THE SPIRIT OF COOKER} planted (after having been reared from seed), we have drawn the conclusion that the asparagus plant retains the char- acter of a marine littoral vegetable, by requiring, and refusing to prosper without, a plentiful supply of common salt in the soil around it. The great Italian physician and anatomist, Fallopia, wrote an exhaustive essay on asparagus, to which we may refer our readers for a complete history of this remarkable plant. The ancients ate the shoots of the spiny-leaved asparagus, A. acutifolius, L., which they called corruda. In the East Indies the large roots (observe, not shoots) of a particular kind of this plant, the A. sarmentos^is, are eaten, boiled in milk. In Malabar they are used for medical confections. One of the principal ingredients of the asjjaragus is a chemical substance, a so-called immediate lyrinciple, asiJara- gin, of which we have already spoken under the paragraph on Salsifis, or Scorzonera. It is very nutritious in this sense, that it probably is a compound which is used in the constructive processes of plants and animals, and is not only consumed in the downward metabolic changes for the production of power and heat. It seems to stand in a particular relation to the albuminous substances. Some authors distinguish two cultivated varieties of asparagus—the white and the green. Others admit three varieties, the third being the violet. This appears to us no valid distinction of varieties, inasmuch as all cultivated asparagus plants yield ^ohite shoots if they are cut before having seen the light, violet shoots if cut when just lifting the surface of the earth, and green shoots when they rise a few inches above the ground. The distinction between white and green was well known to the Greeks, who called the latter—the only form that could be gathered in nature —the high asgMragus, asjgaragon acron. The high green asparagus has the strongest flavour, and is certainly the

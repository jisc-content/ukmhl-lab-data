PREPARATIONS OF MUTTON. In Great Britain mutton is the most generally useful form of animal food, as well on account of its intrinsic qualities as of the adaptability of its parts to the smallest and largest wants. In Scotland, where barley, thistles, and sheep thrive equally well, mutton enjoys various forms of popular preparation, which lose much by transference to other climates. The preparation of the head of the sheep for cooking there begins with singeing with a red-hot iron ; if this were practised in London, it would lead to the inter- ference of sanitary committees of vestries, perhaps of the Local Government Board itself; however, singeing com- pleted, the horns, if any are present, are sawed off; the head is soaked in warm water and scraped. In England the head is mostly deprived of its skin, which is con- sequently not cooked. The head is next split, and the brain is removed; this can be made into forcemeat-balls, or be used otherwise, as will be described. Soak the head in water during the night to be able to bleach and clean it.

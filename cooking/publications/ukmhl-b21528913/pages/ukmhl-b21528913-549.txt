LITERATURE OF CARUM 521 wine ; a slow and a quick process are given ; this resulted probably in the production of a kind of fish essence, like our present anchovy essence. Although fish was generally used, the flesh of other animals was sometimes employed in the formation of garum. Garum, then, was a product from different animals, shrimps, scomber fish, sardines or anchovies, red mullet, their intestines, i.e., most probably, roe, also called liver, both soft and cjranular, and the flesh of other animals. It w^as probably when made by one mode a preparation analogous to caviar; when made of another, analogous to extract of meat with salt, and by a third to essence of anehovies. The liver garum of Apicius was a freak, and never had any position ; we may dismiss it from consideration. We have not translated the word scomber, the fish from which the best garum was made. We believe, with Soyer, that it could not have been the mackerel, as the descriptions of the process do not fit that fish; but we think that it was probably the tunny, as Stephanus reported, and as we have already stated above. The expression entrails, or intestines, of the fish has pro- bably to be interpreted as its roe, soft and hard, and not as gut or stomach, which latter could by no means be made to yield an essence of a savoury kind. The reader may find some further discussion of this question in Soyer’s ‘ Pantropheon.’ He may also there read the recipes for the composition of two stomachics into which garum entered, namely, hypotrimma and moretaria. Interesting, however, is the note from Bose, that while at the present day garum is forgotten in Italy, in Turkey it is still in use. ‘ The innkeepers of Constanti- nople preserve in garum the cooked fish not consumed in the day.’ Brillat-Savarin has a chapter on garum and muria, and comes to the entirely unfounded surmise that the Eoman garum had been the same as soy, which comes from India,

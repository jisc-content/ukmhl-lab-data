209 OX-'TAIL SOUP after the cheeks have been removed for other purposes. It requires much boiling, and the addition of forcemeat balls or egg balls to make it nutritious, and spices and vegetables to give it flavour. Ox-tail SoiqJ derives its speciflcity from the pieces of ox-tail v?hich are cooked in, and are to be served with it. Ox-tail was the first ingredient in the old recipe for julienne by Marc Heliot, cook of Louis XV. It is related that this soup was not known in England before the abrogation of the Edict of Nantes, and that ox-tails had little value. French Huguenot emigres are said to have invented the soup; it has, however, become so popular that it is now considered a national English soup, and cannot any longer be considered as economical as it formerly was on account of the cheapness of its principal material. For an ox-tail of first quality at present costs from 2s. 6d. to 3s., and, as it bears at the most but 1^ lb. of flesh, the purchaser pays from Is. 8d. to 2s. for the pound of beef, or much more than he would pay for prime rump steak. An ox-tail dissected gave: (a) Pure flesh, 1 lb. 7f oz.; (6) fat, gristle, and tendons, 13f oz. ; (c) hones, 14f oz. Total, 3 lb. 4 oz., which had been the weight of the tail; the length had been 2 feet 10 inches, which is noted for eventual comparison of size. It might be supposed that at least a part of the reputa- tion of this soup might be due to a particularly nice flavour derived from the ox-tails. But as the body of the soup con- sists, in ail recipes which we have seen, of stock produced with the usual materials other than the tails, and enriched as usual, the ox-tail goes for very little in its quality. The soup is mostly thickened with purde of peas, carrots, turnips, lentils, and celery, but then becomes heavy. A recipe for Thick Ox-tail Soup may be quoted as an illustration of the superstition relating to bones : Take two pennyworth of fresh bones, simmer gently with three quarts 14

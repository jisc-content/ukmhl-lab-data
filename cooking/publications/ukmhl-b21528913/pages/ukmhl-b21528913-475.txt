OX-TONGUE, TRIPE, AND COWS' HEELS 447 boiled state, and has to be reboiled in milk, at least for an hour. It must then be made tasty by sauces or garnishes, and is therefore frequently favoured with abundance of onions. According to Homer, tripe was one of the dishes presented to the guests at the feast of Achilles. A French name for tripe is Gi'cis double. A recipe for its preparation d la Mode de Caen, by Vuillemot, is remarkable by requiring as a garnish twelve blanched sheep’s feet, and, amongst a heap of other vegetables, twelve heads of leek, a bottle of wine, and a glass of cognac, for its coction. Some prepare tripe like a fricassee; others fry it in butter. The Dutch mix it with minced beef and other ingredients, and make brawn of it; such brawn they also fry, when desirous of having it warm. The Dutch name of this brawn is Bol2)ens. The Feet of Oxen, Cows, and Neats, all go by the name of Coios’ Heels. This shows that there is not much difference in their quality as food. They are generally bought ready boiled at the tripe-shop. In the private kitchen they are further boiled until all the bones can be removed, and the semi-gelatinous matter is then stewed gently in a savoury sauce. Under the title of Le Pied de Bce-uf Potdette, Vuille- mot gives a recipe which is noteworthy. The cow’s heel is to be wrapped in washed selvage, and boiled with vegetables and spices. The bandage being removed, it is covered with allemande sauce, with mushrooms, parsley, lemon and butter. A cow’s heel suffices for six persons with a good appetite. ‘ Ce plat par son confortable, est tr^s recherche,’ says this experienced cook.

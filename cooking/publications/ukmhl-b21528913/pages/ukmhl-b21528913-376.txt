THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 348 tions. Amongst physiological effects it is reported that, c.p., garlic makes the retina more sensitive, less able to bear light. Onion was long believed to be a specific preventive of effects of intoxicating drink, or a dispeller of their evil effects. At this day onion and garlic or leek are by some believed to be specifics against fatigue by hunting, shooting, and subsequent feasting. There are many allusions to the use of garlic contained in classic authors—garlic-sellers, garlic-cake shopkeepers, the garlicking of cocks to heat them for combat, garlic-growers. Garlic in Greek is scorodon or scordon; the knobs are gelgides; onion is hromyon, which may have led to kromeshj ; leek is prason. The adjective used by Linne for the rocambole, scorodoprasum, is also an originally Greek word, and signifies a plant of the taste of garlic and leek combined. A fabulous people were called the garlic-fighters, scorodomachoi. The aversion to garlic, therefore, reported as having existed amongst the Greeks was, as in our days, confined to the upper classes, and did not affect the lower. Dumas describes the very air of the South of France, par- ticularly of Proven9e, to be perfumed with the refined essence of the bulb of mystic power of attraction, and the same perfume is throughout many parts of the Continent diagnostic of the proximity of Semitic admirers of the bulb, who might have brought the culte to Egypt, or acquired it there even without the aid of the Captivity and the Exodus. The plants of the Allium tribe have yielded some note- worthy results to comparative botanical research and chemical analysis. The bulbs of garhc are the richest in solids, namely, 35’35 per cent., of which 6’76 per cent, are nitrogenized matter, 26’31 per cent, principles free from nitrogen ; 64'65 per cent, of the bulbs are water. Next to garlic comes the pearl onion, with water, 70T8 per cent.; nitrogenized substance, 2’68 per cent.; sugar, 5‘78 per cent.

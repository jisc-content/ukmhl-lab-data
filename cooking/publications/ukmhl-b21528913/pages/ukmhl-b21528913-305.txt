277 STARCH JELLIES OR FLUMMERIES However, flumrnery as now used in culinary language signifies a preparation the principal constituent of which is a kind of flour or starch (flour of wheat, or grits, of rice or rough-ground rice, also as grits, buckwheat, millet, sago, or starch of potatoes, rice, etc.), made soluble‘or expanded in milk, a fruit juice sweetened with sugar, flavoured with aromatics or liqueurs, mixed with the froth of whipped albumin, and allowed to set into a jelly in a suitable mould. A flummery is sent to table with a tasty sauce, such as liquid custard with liqueur, or cold sauce of raspberries, currants, or cherries, or cream or milk sauce with flavour of almonds or vanilla, or wine sauce. In German culinary literature the dish figures as flammeri, which is further corrupted to flambri. It is not noticed at all in many English cookery-books, and the Erench also as a rule ignore it. One of the latter* has a dish which he terms Plombihres, without any explanation. This might be an attempt at an approximative reproduction of the word ‘ flummery ’ as spoken. The French dish which bears this heavy name is a cream custard, flavoured with almonds and set by heat below boiling, mixed with whipped cream and frozen in ice. Being thus destitute of starch and flour of any kind it does not come under our definition of flummery. A Flummery of Bice-grits and Fruit Juice, so-called Bothe Griitze {Bed Grits), of Baltic Germany, originally made with buckwheat, now of rice or wheat grits, to be eaten with cream or custard, is popular in Northern Europe. Flummeries of wheat-grits, or gootato and wheat starch, boiled with milk, flavoured with liqueur, e.g., maraschino, are eaten with cold fruit sauce or liquid custards. Many varia- tions of flummeries are described, which can be produced by the observance of the following i^rinciples ; Any flour, grits or starch may be used to j)roduce the initial paste. * Gf.

323 TOMATOES containing 92-37 per cent, of water, 2-5 per cent, of sugar, and about 1-5 per cent, of nitrogenized and 1-5 per cent, of non-nitrogenized extractives. Take care to buy only ripe tomatoes, and avoid the unripe form which has been taken from the bush in the green state, and been forced by exposure to sunlight to change its colour to red. Such a tomato is always flat in taste and poor in pulp. Another Solanum, the nigru7n, L., the deadly nightshade, called so from the deleterious effect of its hlack berries, was formerly eaten in England as a greeii vegetable.* Its French popular name is morelle, like that of its medically so impor- tant relative, Solanum dulcamara, the creeping hittersxoeet or Atropa belladonna,!). Another Solanum, of which the fruit, coloured dark violet, size of a very large pear, is eatable when prepared much like gourd or vegetable-marrow, is the one called esculentum, L., known and sold in France under the name of aiobergine (also mdlonghre, mayeiine, varcn- geane), and eaten in Provence and Languedoc. It comes from India, where it is called fokke-foJcM, or brinjal, and eaten in soup and other forms, even as chutney. In the Antilles it is called gitingambo. Of the two alkaloids, atropin and solanin, which are poisonous, none occurs in the tomatoes, although their leaves are said at certain periods to be noxious. Tomatoes form an ornamental and well-tasting entremets when stuffed with forcemeat and braised {a la Pi-ovenqale) in salad-oil, and gratinated with breadcrumb and the sala- mander. Artichokes. The artichoke belongs to the family of Carduacece. Its systematic name, Cynara, is said to be derived from kyon. While it was, no doubt, prepared, cooked, and eaten as a vegetable, it 18 possible that tins was done to obtain healing effects. Cf.

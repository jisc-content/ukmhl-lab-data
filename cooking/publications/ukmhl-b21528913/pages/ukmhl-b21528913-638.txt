6io THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY Many of these as now presented at"the end of â– dinners, before dessert, we find very vulgar, dry, and destitute of art as well as harmony. Unless made by a skilled cook, these preparations are likely to turn out unsatisfactory. CHAPTER LVI. VARIOUS USEFUL CULINARY PREPARATIONS. A SANDWICH consists of at least two equal slices of either white or brown bread, an eighth of an inch in thickness, and butter, with some meat, such as ham, tongue, boiled or roast beef, mutton, poultry, or game, or a savoury prepara- tion thereof placed between them in such a manner that the buttered side of each slice of bread is inside and turned towards the meat; a sandwich can therefore be conveniently eaten while being held in the hand; for the same reason it can be conveniently wrapped in paper, or packed in a little box, and consumed at the appointed time. For sand- wiches the bread should not be too fresh, but somewhat set; it is also advisable to remove the crust before cutting the slices of bread, as this impedes the even cutting of the latter. Once made, sandwiches should be protected from drying by being kept covered or enclosed until the time when they are to be used. Favourite central ingredients of sandwiches are: ham and beef; eheese and anchovies ; eyys, iilain and com])ound; cheese and fruit (e.g., Gruyhre and plantains)-, salad; Jish or fowl; lobster; egg and anchovies, etc. An excavated roll may be stuffed with a salpicon. Excellent materials for sandwiches are Pomeranian Goose-breast, Strasburg Goose- liver Pasty, and Brunswick Sausage.

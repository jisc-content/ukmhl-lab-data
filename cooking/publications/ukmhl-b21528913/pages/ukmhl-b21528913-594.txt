566 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY table spoonfuls for large dishes. The use of this extract of the root of the latroplia manihot, which furnishes the opportunity for the West Indian speciality which we have described as ; secondly the use of standard broth ; and, thirdly, the use of tinctures of sp>ices, elevate the character of pies far above what one has been ordinarily accustomed to ; and as regards cassareep, the effects are the more evident the simpler are the other ingredients of the dish. All materials of a pie, at the moment when they are to he covered with the paste, must be cold. When the material for a pie has been parboiled, or fried, or roasted, or stewed (operations which ought always to leave the meat under- done), or when sauces have been made expressly to be placed into the pie, it is necessary to let the material become perfectly cold, either in the pie-dish or in a separate vessel, before covering it with the paste. If the latter were placed over the meat and sauce while they are steaming, the under side would condense the steam, swell up, become sodden, and lose the character of crust. For the same reason every pie-crust requires a quick heat at the beginning of the baking, to become set and hot, so as to drive the steam which rises up to it back again towards the meat. The omission of this aiid other precautions in the making of pies has given them a bad reputation, which, as regards sodden paste, is only too frequently deserved. Borne writers say that ‘ putting meat or poultry into a pie was certainly the very worst way of cooking it,’ for it was ‘ so often baked to rags.’ This is true of the products of many cooks, who make the oven an oubliette, to which the pie-dish is aban- doned, to be looked at for the first and only time when it is drawn forth to be sent to table. There are frequently put into pies hard-boiled eggs, in slices, or their entire yolks, or even entire plovers' eggs, by the side of the meat. This practice is indeed very common.

351 SALADS AND THEIR MATERIALS CHAPTEE XXVIII. SALADS AND THEIR MATERIALS ; WITH AN AP- PENDIX ON VEGETABLES GROWN AND OBTAIN- ABLE IN INDIA FOR USE THERE. The dressing, or, as it is absurdly termed in French, assaisonnement, or, Anglic^, seasoning, of a salad was in the early days of the century considered by some as a special art. This is illustrated by the biography of the Chevalier d’Albignac, who is related to have developed from a Royalist refugee into a professional ‘ fashionable salad-maker,’ whom the elegant world of the capital of these three kingdoms employed in his speciality on all suitable occasions. Unfor- tunately for the epigones, the Chevalier has not left his recipes on record, so that his performance probably partook of the impromptu, guided by memory and graduated gusta- tion. But we are allowed a glimpse into his repertoire by the list of the preparations which he is related to have carried with him in his portable laboratory—vinegar of different perfumes, oils with and without ‘the taste of fruit,’ soy, caviare, truffles, anchovies, ketchup, meat gravy, and egg-yolks. By the practice of his art and the sale of his cruet-boxes, this &migr6 is reputed to have made a small fortune, with which he retired into the Limousin and lived in happy retirement. The feeling opposed to salad-worship was evinced by the man who gave an elaborate prescription for the prepara- tion of a salad, which made the mouths of the hsteners water, but ended with the climax : ‘ Mix the ingredients well, and then [in lieu of ‘ serve ’] throw the salad out of the window. From these extremes the art has now happily recovered, and observes that j^Lste milieu which is so often the test of final accomplishment.

F<LESH FOOD OF ANTIQUITY AND MIDDLE AGES 629 said that they knew turkeys tinder the name of meleacjrides {i.e., aves), on which see supra; these probably came from Asia and were rarities, certainly not used for food as commonly as nowadays, but mainly kept as ornamental birds, like the peacocks and hens in farms, courts, and parks. Our present turkey came to us from America, although it bears many names, including kirkey and calicitl, which point to an intermediate starting - point. The pheasant, which the Argonauts had brought to Greece, was imported into Italy, together with the cherry and the peach, by Lucullus. The Greeks and Eomans ate dogs,* and con- sidered them, when young, plump and carefully prepared, delicate and wholesome food, as the Chinese do in the present day. Dinners were made the means of luxurious exhibitions first amongst the Eomans. The augur Hortensius, on his appointment, gave a dinner at which, for the first time, a roasted peacock, with its principal feathers restored to it, was served on the table. At ceremonial dinners pies with a hundred small birds became fashionable; later on dishes made of fillets of such birds, which were more convenient to eat; this gave rise to the fables about the pates composed of the tongues of nightingales and other singing birds. What the condition of cookery may have been during the Middle Ages it is not easy to ascertain, just because there is no literature which might have recorded the practices even of the highest and ruling classes of society. Careme rather puts the cart before the horse, when he says of the Middle Ages: ‘ When there was no longer a kitchen in the world, there was also no literature, no longer any high and quick intelligence, no longer any inspiration, no longer any social idea.’ This is mere declamation, particularly the part about ‘ inspiration ’ and ‘ idea,’ and reminds of the * Oj.

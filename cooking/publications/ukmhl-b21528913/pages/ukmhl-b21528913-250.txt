Agreeable combinations are prawns and cucumber, crab with gourd, and firm flesh, fish, or chicken, with either of these vegetables. The Moli Curry difi'ers so little from the foregoing that it does not require a separate sketch. Kuhab (Kebob) Curries in great variety are described in old Indian-English cookery-books, and owing to their condi- ments and ingredients were probably appreciated by early Anglo-Indians who adopted an almost Oriental mode of life more than by moderns. The best kubah cui'ry is one made of tender mutton or veal, and treated as follows: Cut the mutton into pieces about an inch square and half an inch thick; carve some slices of bacon, some pieces an inch square also, hut only an eighth of an inch thick ; cut up some pieces of

THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 58 ticularly aggregates of small objects, such as whitebait, which must be clipped simultaneously and withdrawn suddenly, a loire basket is requisite. Some three to six jelly-moulds complete the list of lighter apparatus. Amongst the more compound apparatus we range a frecz- ing-machine, or cooling apparatiis of convenient dimensions ; a coffee-mill; a mincing-machine for the comminution of meat; a tin box with various divisions, and a set of movable stoppered vessels of glass or tin, for the preservation of spices ; a similar tin box, with stoppered bottles containing ready-made tinctures of spices. There should be a xoooden slab and a marble slab, both for the production of pastry ; rolling-pins of hard wood, one a plain cylinder or faggot, and another with central or axial pin, and two projecting handles at the extremities. Consideration of the Materials of which the Utensils should he made. Vessels of cojgper are the most durable, and if kept bright cannot affect the taste or wholesomeness of the food pre- pared in them, even if they be not tinnedâ€”e.g., jams can be prepared in a large copper pan. But it is usual to get the small copper vessels, sauta-paus, stock-pot, saucepans, and pans to stand in the bain-marie, tinned; in which case it is necessary to inspect them from time to time, and see that the tinning be perfect, for wherever it is imperfect the copper is much more rapidly corroded. We have also had copper ^Ltensils silvered by the electro-plate process; these utensils are of exquisite purity, but they blister at the same temperature nearly as that at which the tinned vessels part with their tin in little drops or currents, and must therefore not be exposed to such degrees of heat. Vessels of mere cast or tvrought iron are good for many culinary operations. The best frying-pan is one of steel or hard iron, highly polished inside, and, we repeat emphati-

INGREDIENTS AND BOILING OF EGGS 589 siderable percentage of Hcutrcil jQ/t, olein, and mciTcjcvvin (21 per cent, of yolk); 0,-adi cliolesterin, nearly ^ per cent. Of fowls’ eggs, ten go, on an average, to the pound of 500 grm. ; therefore an average hen’s egg weighs 50 grm. A goose’s egg weighs fi’om 120 to 180 grm. Of the weight of the fowl’s egg, 7 grm. are shell, 27 grm. white, and 16 grm. yolk; or, in 100, shell = 14, white = 54, yolk = 32 parts. The white of hens’ eggs contains 85-75 per cent, of loater, 12-67 per cent, of dry alhumin, 0-25 per cent, of fat and sugar, and 0-59 per cent, of salts. The yolk con- tains 50-82 per cent, of water, 16-23 per cent, of nitrogenized matter, 31-75 per cent, of olein, margarin and phosjAia- tides, 0-13 per cent, of carbo-hydrates, and 1-09 per cent, of salts. From the returns of the octroy of Paris, it appears that in 1871 every inhabitant of that town consumed 128 eggs per year. Later estimates give the consumption of eggs for Paris as 18 grm. per head per day, or 131 eggs per head per year. An inhabitant of Munich consumes 182 eggs per year, and every head in London 73 eggs per year. On the other hand, the inhabitants of London consume much more meat per head than either the inhabitants of Paris or of Munich. The principles according to which eggs are to be boiled are readily enunciated, but difficult to carry out. There are many likings as regards the degree to which eggs should be boiled. For purposes of definition, we acknowledge the following: An egg placed in Ijoiling water for a short time —say not exceeding two minutes—and removed and then opened, will be found to have formed a thin coating of curdled white of egg near the shell; the rest of the white is turbid or milky, but not set; the yolk is entirely fluid, but warm. This is the minimum of cooking an egg should receive, and it may then be called very soft-boiled. When an egg is kept during two minutes or a little longer in

THE SPIRIT OF COOK FRY 312 according to the method employed iu the preparation of those of beef and mutton. But as the materials are less plentiful, stock essences from other kinds of meat are very rarely if at all made. Ficmets are essences containing certain specified flavours, from residual parts of animals, c.r/., from carcases of birds from which the fillets have been cut. With regard to such fumets and to all essences of animal parts, remember that meat alone gives any extract worthy of the name of essence, and a pound of meat furnishes not more than about half an ounce, with which a pint of good strong broth can be produced. Therefore a gravy from a carcase should not be more in weight than the meat yet attached to the bones when they are chopped. Bone and inner organs contribute next to nothing to any extract made from carcases. Some cooks apply the name of fumet only to extracts made from game, pheasants, woodcocks, partridges, and from larks, blackbirds, leverets, and rabbits. This is a matter of mere convention, and there is no reason why an essence of fowl should not be called a fumet of fowl ; any- how, essences are made in exactly the same manner as fumets. The Essence of Fowl as described in books on cookery is a good illustration of the persistence of the prejudice in favour of bones of whatever origin, and is of very little use. The coni]]oun(l essence, into which extract of veal enters, is more suital)le. The Essences of Game—pheasant, partridge, woodcock, and snipe—are useful to work up residues. Essence of Ham is always savoury and naturally concen- trated, as the meat of the ham has been dried. Essences of Fish are savoury, but have a collateral fishy or hair-oil taste, which makes them repulsive to refined palates. Broiled fish—e.g., John Dory or whitiug—gives a more tolerable essence, but it is partaken of only under social constraint, .V ' '

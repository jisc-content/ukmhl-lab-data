125 BOUILLON, OR MEAT-BROTH transformed into colla, or glue, being the hydrated form of a substance which, when dry, is called gelatine. Meat yields some gelatin to water when it is boiled, the more the longer the boiling is continued. But when it is desired to produce gelatinous matters {^jellies) in the kitchen, it is never ad- visable to use either meat or bones for that purpose, but calves’ feet, which, with the exception of the bones and cartilages, will dissolve almost entirely in water by long boiling and form neutral or tasteless jelly. Proportion of Bones to Meat in Various Animals. We come now to the consideration of the hones of meat. In good veal we have on the average twelve parts of bone in fifty-eight parts of joint as bought; in beef, ten parts of bone in fifty of joint; therefore in these two kinds of meat a fifth of the loeight at least is bone ; but in several joints the weight of the bone rises to one-fourth: in laynb the proportion is a little different, the bones being to flesh as eight to thirty- seven (17‘7 percent.); in fat sheep, as seven to thirty (nearly 19 per cent.); here the meat is a little more than five times the weight of the bones. In these estimates all visible fat is excluded. In fat ptorh bones are to flesh as seven to thirty- eight, therefore less than one-sixth (seven out of forty-five), fat again excluded. In many culinary operations the connection of the bone with the meat is of great advantage to the latter, e.g., in [ mutton chops, saddle of mutton, loin of beef, etc. During I the roasting the bone protects the meat on one side from j drying, while admitting the heat. But in the process of boiling the presence of hone is of no advantage whatever; in particular, bone and its surroundings, not being meat, contribute nothing to the flavour of the joint or the broth, and very little to its nutritious qualities, and therefore all bones should as far as possible be kept away, or removed

SERVICES AND COURSES OF 7J/NNERS 639 which the division is manifested or characterized. In England, as well as on the Continent, just before the dessert the table is almost cleared, and a new set of plates, knives and forks, and glasses are set before the diners-, constituting a change which may well be termed a service. On great occasions the dessert is served in a new room, to which the guests adjourn from the dining-room ; in this case the dessert could by no means be called a part of a single service dinner, but would constitute a second service, unless it was con- tended, which would be absurd, that dessert was no part of the dinner at all. For ourselves, we adhere to the French system of three services* so called, meaning by services convenient divi- sions of the various courses of the dinner, between which there might even be a slight pause. We hold that soup, hot and cold hors d’oeuvres, fish, releves, and entrees com- pose the first service; the second service is composed of the roasts and entremets, the third of cheese and dessert. We will now consider these courses a little more in detail, enumerating them first in succession, and classifying them on the left in two services, so called, on the right in three. Parallel of the Two and Three Service System, the Courses remaining the same. rSoup. hot and cold hors d’cnuvres. First I Fish. fervice. j Entrees (side-dishes). ^Joints or removes (releves).

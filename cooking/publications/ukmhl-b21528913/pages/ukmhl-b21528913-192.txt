THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 164 gelatinous and meaty parts are cut up small and put into the soup. Plain Savoury Purde of Bice Soup.—This may be made with beef-broth, or white with chicken - broth and veal. It requires a pound of rice to two quarts of broth. Savotiry Purde of Bice Soup with Whole Bice.* Purde of Bice Soup with Crayfish and Quenelles of Fowl.— Two quarts require about thirty tails of crayfish, and three dozen small quenelles of fowl. Point with crayfish- or lobster-butter and lemon. In case the tails and quenelles be coloured with cochineal or alkanet-root, the dish will obtain some external claim to the name of a la cardinal, with which it is marked in some recipes. Purde of Bice Sotip> with Parma Cheese and Quenelles of Fowl.—This soup requires the addition of a leeson (liaison, binding) of six yolks of eggs to prevent the 2 oz. of Parmesan cheese from coalescing and becoming a viscid sediment. The small quenelles of fowls may be coloured with spinach-green. Ptcrde of Bice Soup with Custard of Purde of Chicken.— The custards are made with the pounded white meat, or all the meat of a roast chicken, passed through a tammy, with the aid of some white sauce; the pur6e is bound by eight yolks, with nutmeg, salt, and consomme of fowls; the custard paste is placed in a dozen dariole moulds, and these are steamed, immersed half-way in water, in a fricandeau-pan. Purde of Bice Soup with Purde of Pheasant or Partridge. Puree of Bice Soup loith Croquettes of Bice.—The croquettes are made savoury with Parma cheese. This last puree has been classified as one of the ‘ national soups ’ under the name h la Florentine; but it probably has, as the name indicates, only a local, and no national reputation. * This is called a cream by some (e.g., F., 317 et seg.), a misnomer which we eliminate.

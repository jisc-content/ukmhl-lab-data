GRATINATED CRUST SOUPS 171 serve as dishes for evaporation, while sucking in the con- centrated products of the process from the dish, which are then immediately caramelized or browned. Such gratinated crusts on a silver dish also look very pretty, i.e., culinarily attractive, as indicating fine taste, and are convenient to serve. If rolls be baked expressly, let them be made of the size and shape of hens’ eggs; a dozen will be sufficient for a table with sixteen covers. The broth to be put over them must be thick, fat consomme. The last browning must be effected in the oven if the main process was carried out on a silver dish over charcoal or gas. The soup is put over the crusts only at the moment of serving, so that it has not time to entirely undo the crispness of the crusts. The soup may be any clear gravy or com- pound savoury soup, from jardiniere to onion soup. Seeing that the more simple soups are preferred, we agree with the French cooks, who immerse the gratinated crusts in a rich bouillon only.

Most cooks have no clear concep- tion of it, and some none at all. Beauvilliers* recipe (loc. cit., i. 16) is not quite intelligible; it appears to me as if it contained two alternatives, fused into one recipe by an inattentive copyist.

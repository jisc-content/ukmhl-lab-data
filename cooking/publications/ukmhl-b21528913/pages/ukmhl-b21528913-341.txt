Cf^LINARy ESSfiXCES, SOY 3â€™3 Essences may be made of shallots, garlic, sage and onions, truffles, mitshrooiiis (not to be confounded with fietcliuii), fine herbs, oranges, anchovies. The essences may be incorporated wdth butter, which, like most fats, has the power of retaining flavours better than liquids. We thus obtain anchovy butter, ravigote butter, green ravigote butter, Proveneale butter, lobster butter or lobster coral butter, Montpellier butter, crayfish butter, praivn and shrimp blotter. In the cases of crayfish and other crus- taceans, the flesh itself, not merely the extract, is incorpor- ated as puree with the butter. Soy, soya, Japanese sooju, also called India or China soy, because it came vici these countries, is the Japanese name of the plant Dolichos soja, L., and of the extract prepared from the fermented grain of this plant. The grain or bean is (said to be) fermented in (salt) water, and the product is evaporated down to the consistency of a thin sauce, or even of a dark-brown treacly extract. China soy as hitherto obtained in London had a strong taste of brown or black sugar syrup, commonly called dahs, and however genuine as regards importation it may have been, it would have been more valuable if it had not been so mixed. According to an old fable, soy is made from beetles, a statement which Londoners improve to black-beetles. This was probably induced liy the colour of the soy, which is very much like that of the brown articulate. The so-called China soy formerly sold in London was a thick liquid of agreeable, sweetish, somewhat warm taste. The later importations from Japan consist of a thin brown liquid of agreeable taste, being a salted extractive, which serves any purpose of a mild sauce ; we found it very agree- able with fish. According to Ksempfer, soy was made by the Japanese with meat-juice, and termed by them sooju; but the products sold in London contain no appreciable amount of meat-juice,

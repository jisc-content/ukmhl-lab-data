SOrR MILK KUMYS 6oi the addition to the milk of heer or elder [apple wine), or some ivhisky or rum. These additions are essentially wholesome. The art of taldug milk from mares, of the steppe, and transforming it into an intoxicating and at the same time nutritious beverage is very old, as we see from the second chapter of the fourth book of Herodotus, where it is fully described. (On this subject the reader should compare the tenth paragraph of the first chapter, supra, Illustration derived from the Case of Kumys.) It is practised as largely as ever, and in our days has been applied to the treatment of the sick, particularly of consumptive x^ersons, with the result of giving them much comfort and prolonging their lives. This is in part due to the fact that mare’s milk greatly resembles human milk in this, that it contains much less albuminous matter and fat, and more sugar of milk, than cow’s milk. The following comparison of the milk of the she-ass with that of the mare, cow, and lastly with human milk, is instructive in all respects: P.\nT.s IN 1,000 OF Milk. The /1«5. nr„..„ Human Female.

All these xii’oportions are reversed in cow s milk, which is therefore very unsuitable for the production of such a beverage. Mare s milk is transformed into kumys by two ]p''Occ’sses which run by the side of each other, one being the vinous, the other the laetie aeid fermentation. A part of the caseine is precipitated, another remains in solution. The whole of the milk-sugar is not always decomposed, and it is not always decomposed in equal proportions by both ferments ;

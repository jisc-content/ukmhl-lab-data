NATIONAL SOUPS AND COMPOUND DISHES 213 tifculado of Castile also thinks the olla obligatory on feast- days. But the French have an oille, cl la Francaise which is adaptable to moderate demands, and can be produced in smaller proportions, while it is probably better in quality than the colossal olla. This, therefore, corresponds to the puchero ; it is plat cle relevd. The oille en potage cl I’ancienne mode presents several interesting features, one of which is that the pigeons and the hen to be used in it are stuffed zuith a farce made with bread and bouillon, egg-yolks, an onion baked in ashes, and hashed bottoms of artichokes, besides green herbs, spices, and salt; then there is beef and veal in large slices, and all soup vegetables in volume; broth or water is added. The pot is heated to boiling, and then allowed to simmer for five hours. The cook then makes gratinated crusts in a metal dish, and reduces the bouillon until the crusts begin to adhere to the dish. On this basis the meat, fowl and pigeons are served and carved; the soup is then presented in a separate dish or tureen.* The first and indispensable ingredient of the olla is a volume of good bouillon ; into this beef in cubical slices is immersed; upon this follows a quantity of mutton, some pounds of veal gristle, a cut of ham, a chicken, two pigeons, a duck, two partridges, two quails, a pound of bacon, chorizos, garbaii9os (these should have been soaked in water for twenty-four hours previously). The spices are placed in a muslin bag. The vegetables are separately prepared, namely, cabbage lettuces, carrots, turnips, boiled with the fat top broth of the olla ; in another vessel are boiled, also with broth from the olla, bottoms of artichokes, onions, green haricots, slices of cucumber, points of asparagus, and green * The two soups described (D.D., 869) as d la Orimod de la Jie(piUre and A lajambe de bois—recipes by the editor of the ‘ Ahnanach des Gour- mands ’—are mere imitations of the oille en polatje.

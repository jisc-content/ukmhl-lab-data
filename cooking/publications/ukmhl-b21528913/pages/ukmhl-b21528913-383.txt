SALADS OF UNCOOKED VEGETABLES 355 dry, or by crushing the flowering plant and condensing the expressed juice. The Eoman Emperor Augustus was cured of melancholy by means of the juice of lettuce, and showed his gratitude to his physician, Musa, by causing a statue of him to be erected in his honour. Opium, being cheaper and stronger, and hops in beer have, during the last sixty years, displaced lactucarium. The lettuce is not otherwise very nutritive, for it contains nearly 95 per cent, of water, 1-5 per cent, nitrogenized matter, and about 2 per cent, of carbo-hydrates. The stiff, straight, common, or Boman lettuce has a similar composition, but contains less lactucin, and is less tender. Endive, Gicliorium endivia, var. crisixb, L., var. imllida, must be well etiolated, or is bitter, hard and indigestible. Its composition is much like that of lettuce, but the fleshy leaf ribs contain in addition about a quarter per cent, of sbbgar. There is a summer endive, called Boman, which can be blanched by tying up ; but on the whole endives are best late in autumn. The barbe de capucins is mostly grown from roots in the cellar, and is therefore etiolated from its growth. Endives should be accommodated w’ith oil, vinegar, and spices only, and not be troubled with more complicated dressings. Watercresses, Garden Cresses, Mustard and Cress, are refreshing by their stimulant taste, which is due to a sulphuretted essential oil, oil of cress, resembling mustard oil, of which we have treated above, where alsq the oils of cruciferous plants in general are defined. Many persons prefer to eat watercresses undressed, with salt and bread- and-butter, or with cheese, or with roast meat. Water- cress is the most hardy of winter salads, thriving in floioing boater (hence by the Germans called spring or fountain cress) at the average temperature of the earth, in the latitude of London about 52° Fahr. Bampion {Bapuncbdus esculenkcs, L.) is now rarely used or met with.

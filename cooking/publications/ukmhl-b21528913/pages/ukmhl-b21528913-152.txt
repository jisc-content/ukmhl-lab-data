THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 124 myochrome ; this is identical with the colouring matter of blood, or hemochrome, and, although differently arranged, has the same function, namely, that of fixing or holding oxygen, and giving it up again when it is wanted for the chemical action of the muscles. When it is heated it coagulates like white of egg, though only at a much higher temperature, and changes its colour to reddish-brown. White meat so called, e.g., the flesh of young animals, lambs, calves, and the breasts of domestic birds, contain but little of this myochrome, and great care is taken to keep this meat as white as possible, either by bleeding the animals with particular care, or by draining their bodies of all blood by long suspension. Blood is not capable of giving a savoury extract, although the blood of each species of eatable animals has a particular flavour, that of the ox and cow particularly of musk. When blood is used for cooking, e.g., in sausages called ‘ black puddings,’ the addition of several spices is necessary to overcome the alkaline flatness and absence of savour. Another ingredient of flesh is albumin, coagulable by heat, like white of egg, but differing from the latter in some pro- perties ; it is identical with the colourless albumin of blood and lymph, and is hence termed serum-albumin. It is tasteless, and is thus only a nutritive, and not a flavour- yielding, material. Next we have in muscle connective-tissue, or collagen sitbstance, which forms the sheath of the con- tractile fibres, binds them together in smaller and larger bundles, and supplies to most muscles not only white tendinous envelogies, so-called aponeurotic fascice, but also white and mostly attenuated tendinous attachments, or thin long outrunners called tendons. All the ligaments by which the joints are held together, and all the membranes by which bodies and organs are covered, and the latter are suspended in the bodies, consist of the collagen substance. It is called collagen because by long boiling with water it is

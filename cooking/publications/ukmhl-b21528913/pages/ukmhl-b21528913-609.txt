ICES AND FROZEN J'RERARATIONS regarding the practice. In parts where these natural pro- ducts were not to be had, porons vessels were in use, which allowed a sufficient evaporation of water from their surface to keep the contents at an agreeably low temperature. Such vessels the Spaniards by a Moorish name call alcar- azas. In the sixteenth century the use of ice for the cooling of drink was yet so little known north of the Alps that the physician of Francis I., King of France, when he attended his master at Nice during the conferences which he there held with the Emperor Charles V. and Pope Paul III., was astonished to see that the wine was cooled with ice fetched from the neighbouring mountains. Ices, properly so called—that is to say, frozen sweet fruit juices and other suitable preparations—became known in France only towards 1660, when a Florentine confectioner of the name of Procope founded a coffee-house at Paris in a street which then bore the name of Bue de I’Ancienne Comedie; there the first sweet ices were placed before the subjects of Louis XIV. Since that time the use of frozen preparations in warm weather to cool the body, and the use of ice and other refrigerating agents, particularly for the preservation of perishable articles of food, have been extended over all countries. Along with this extension went improvements in the means of preserving, transporting, and artificially producing ice or other agents for the production of low degrees of temperature in water or air, so that now these means are very numerous and compendious, and natural transported ice is rivalled by artificially frozen water in most large towns of the world. The equivalent for the Saxon word ice in the French language is glace, and as this has received several applica- tions in culinary art, and even been made into a verb, and as several of these applications have passed into English nomenclature, we must define these different meanings. In cookery a mere jelly was called glace for a long lime; thus

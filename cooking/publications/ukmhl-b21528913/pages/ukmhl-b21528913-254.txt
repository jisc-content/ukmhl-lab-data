226 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY ragouts. The English table has sauces such as no other kitchen produces; indeed, the (jravies of roast beef and mutton are equal to a hecatomb of sauces. It has egg sauce for vegetables, bread sauce for game, and a most pleasing variety of fruit sauces, such as of apples, goose- berries, currant-jelly, and others, and it has three exquisitely British saucesâ€”mint sauce, the complement of roast lamb; caper sauce, the complement of boiled mutton; and onion sauce, the complement of roast shoulder of mutton. The specificity of several of the sauces of the English kitchen is well indicated by a series of proverbs and anecdotes, which are for the most part so well known that they do not require repetition. The subject of the appropriateness of sauces to certain kinds of meat just touched upon admits of much dietetic and esthetic consideration, which may be continued in other places. Magirics have said truly that sauces accomplish a variety of objects; their proper application reveals the man of taste, and their practical production is a constant oppor- tunity for the exhibition of the minor qualities, such as dexterity, of a good cook. Sauces may be intended to act upon taste by homogeneity or by contrast. In the former case they must be made to conform to or to iterate the taste of the meat with which they are to be eaten. An attentive reader of a good cookery- book will find this carried out in many recipes.

Sauces of milk, cream, eggs, and butter, go well with preparations of flour, such as puddings and cakes; but purdes and sauces of acidulous fruit and jellies eaten with such pastry act by contrast, and sharpen the desire. Sauces, then, are of various kinds; some are bland, expressed to the eye by light colour, lohite sauces, with

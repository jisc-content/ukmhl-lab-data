1 HR SPIRIT OR COOKRRY 582 we have glace da veau and glace de ctiisson (called glaize in English); but the independent jellies, aspics, and sweet jellies were soon excluded from this terminology. A glace, or, as some English writers prefer to spell it, a glaze, became the name for a concentrated sauce, a consomniS of good taste, containing so much gelatine that when it was placed hot in a thin layer upon a piece of meat, or cake, or a vegetable, it adhered to it, and became set on cooling. Such articles covered with such thick shiny sauce were called glazed, whether the sauce was allowed to set or not; but this kind of glazing had no relation to the application of artificial sources of cold, and therefore does not form part of the preparations to be discussed in the present chapter.

The third meaning in French con- fectionersâ€™ language of the word glace is that corresponding to the English term an ice, being a naturally sweet or arti- ficially-sugared liquid or semi-solid transformed into a solid by artificial freezing. Such edible ice the Germans call Gefrorenes, ox frozen matter. The simplest materials for ices are sweetened fruit juices, such as lemonade, juice of cherries, of any of the fruit com- monly made iuto jams and jellies; as they are limpid liquids in the thawed state, they are in the frozen state termed water ices ; these are the most refreshing, and least onerous to the stomach. A cheap form of these is pre- pared by dissolving the so-called acid drojw (really acidu- lated sugar-drops) in hot water, producing' a sherbet, and then consolidating this by frost; such water ices are sold to the multitude in summer time at low prices, and contri-

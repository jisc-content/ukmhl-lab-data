The best Devonshire clotted cream, which is of a yellow colour, from the distribution of small drops of yellow oiled butter, is in our time yielded by milk from .Jersey shorthorn cows. Strain new milk iuto a large pan, and let it remain unmoved for twenty-four hours ; then place the pan over a slow fire, and heat it up very slowly without ever allowing it to reach or even come near to the boiling-point. Under these conditions the cream forms a thick membranous mass at the top, the fat-globules being enveloped in membranes of caseine, which are constantly

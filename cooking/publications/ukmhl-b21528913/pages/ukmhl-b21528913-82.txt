THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 54 Movable Apparatus required for an Ordinary Establishment. There are some skilful inventions relating to cookery which would be of great value if the practical executants of culinary art were of a more Athenian novelty-seeking disposi- tion. We remember the introduction of Captain Warren’s culinary apparatus, and have not changed our opinion of its great value for every establishment the authority of which will succeed in seeing it used according to the pre- scription of its inventor. We read in ‘ Wyvern’s ’ work (p. 17), that when he was staying once with a friend on the (East Indian) hills, the water for his bath was brought in the outer vessel of a ‘ Warren’s patent cooking-pot,’ and further, the host said ‘ that the inner vessel made a capital tom-tom for beating a sholah,’ Here, then, we have the example of a good instrument completely diverted from its proper to inferior uses. But on p. 19 the same author finds that his native Indian cook fully appreciated ‘Warren’s fish-kettle and vegetable steamer.’ This introduction will explain why and under which conditions we believe that a Warren’s cooking-pot may be part of the heavier sort of movable apparatus. To the same category belongs a Papin’s digester, with a movable tin lining and cover thereto. The digester is to be hermetically closed by a top-screw, and to be heated by a gas, or spirit, or charcoal flame. We have used this for flesh, fish, and fowl. Particularly a boned, stuffed fowl done in normal broth is cooked in this digester better than anywhere else, and comes out with a rich appetising flavour. The apparatus has the advantage that, once set going, it requires no attention, except to the lowering of the gas- flame in case the safety-valve should begin to blow. Of cooking-pans the following should form part of what the French call the kitchen battery; Four steiopans of different sizes, and six saticepans, also of varying capacity.

74 THE SPIRIT OF COOKER) thiu slices of bacon, to be removed shortly before the outside is finished. All meat should at first be put at some distance, say from 10 to 14 inches, always a little greater than that at which it is ultimately to be roasted, from the fire, in order that it may be warmed gradually to such a degree as will cause it to exude fat and gravy over its surface before that surface has had time to become scorched by the radiating heat; if once it gets scorched, the outside will become hard and acquire a disagreeable taste, and the heat being prevented by the scorched part from penetrating into it, the meat will appear done before it is more than half done, and will besides lose the pale-brown colour which is the beauty of roast meat and the certain guarantee of its excellent taste. As regards tlia management of the dri2)ping the following rules should be observed :* Place the dripping-pan at such a distance from the fire that it will just catch the dripping; if it be too near, some ashes or cinders will fall into it; if it be too far from the fire, you will not only lose a portion of the drippings, but the meat will be blackened and spoiled by the foetid smoke which will arise when the fat falls on the live cinders. A large dripping-pan, some 28 inches long, 20 inches wide, with a covered well on the side away from the fire, is convenient not only for collecting the dripping, but it also may hold fried fish and other dishes to keep them hot while waiting to be served. If there be much dripping during the roasting, the cook should take up the fat top occasionally and pass it through a sieve into a stone pot. After it has been cooled, and the gravy been removed from under it, it may be clarified by being heated in a saucepan, skimmed, let boil, allowed to stand until cool while yet liquid, and then passed through a sieve into a pan. Such drippings, as well as the fat skimmiugs of the hroth-piot, will be as suitable as butter for basting any roasts, except game * Vide ‘Dripping’; Kitchiner, loc. ciL, pp. 81, 148.

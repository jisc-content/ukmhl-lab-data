146 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY the cutlets with the aid of the trimmings. Considering how small is the quantity of meat in them, it will be seen that they could yield only little of a weak broth, and the result would hardly be worth the trouble and cost of production. We find that for this and the hotch-potch next to be described the broth is best produced with Anderson’s extract of mutton, which gives the finest mutton-tea that can be produced. Hotch-Potch. This name is generally spelled as in our title, and not hodge-podge, as some writers have it. It is derived from the French liochepiot, from hocher, to shake, and pot.* The dish may be defined as ‘ a confused mass of ingredients shaken and gently boiled together in the same pot.’ The French recipes contain no mutton nor mutton-broth; but besides oxtail and slices of beef, ham, and a saveloy (sausage), a long list of vegetables—carrots, salsify, turnips, scorzonera (black salsify), topinambur, celery, red potatoes, and many onions. It is therefore a very general ragovit soup, in which the meat has been, in Scotland, changed or limited to mutton. Produce the mutton-broth with chops or cutlets as in the previous recipe, and add thereto a pint and a half of tender green peas, preferably marrow-fats. Boil the soup until all the ingredients are done, and then add to it a pint of puree of spinach with some parsley, so that the soup have a deep- green colour. Gravy-Broth of Fowls. The flesh of fowls yields an extract which in gustatoryj finesse is superior even to that of mutton; by roasting its flavour is naturally enhanced, and the extract becomes gravy-broth. Eoast the required number of fowls before a brisk fire, until they are half done; then put them # It should therefore be written hotchpot; when ending with polch, thta is derived from the English to potch, to boil tender; of this the French equivalent is pocher, now restricted to signifying the parboiling of eggs,1 to poach, I

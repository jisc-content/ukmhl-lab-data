SPONGADAS AND FRUIT ICES 5S7 evei'y preparation containing much lohippcd cream, or being whij^pecl cream itself, may justly receive the same name. We give a few titles of recipes from our approved collec- tions : Chocolate Spongada with Pistachios and Ginger Com- fits—these and other comfits, little white or coloured sugar beans flavoured with specific essences, are cdements of diver- sion, requiring crunching and evolving flavour contrasting to the other materials of the composition (Spongada di Eoma); Sj)07igada of Almonds and Crea^n (Spongada di Toledo), flavoured with Kirsch-icass, French abbreviation of Kirschenwasser, cherry-water ; Compound Spongada of Pis- tachio Puree u'ith Apricot Icc ; and variations. Special hinds of ices are Apricot Ice, once in favour with Mesdames de France—one of their cooks, Cohier de Lompier, left a recipe for its confection ; Pineapple Ice—the recipes relating to this ice appear to us not very practical; Iced Vanilla and Custard Cream, probably better defined as a crecmi custard with excess of cream; Iced Custard Cream with Flou-ers of Cedrat—all other kinds of flowers (suitable for confections) may be used in the same manner: cddrat is the Citrus medicct (Risso), better known in the Bast than with us ; Iced Custcml Cream tuith Pistachio Purde and Spinach Green—for the cream which is omitted a mixture of sugar syrup and white of egg is substituted. A variation of the spongada, omitting the cream, could not attain the quality of the original cream ice, and for this reason was complictead with Jced Apricot Parde. Iced Chocolate Custard Cream and Iced Cofee Custard Cream close the selection. Tlie reader may compare the preparation of Dressed Cream and Compoiind Cream, called en Mousse,' with the spon- gadas. Stratification of ices is an Italian diversion ; the Naples ices were mostly coloured white, red, and ijellow, in layers. This practice may be imitated with all suitable frozen mate- rials.

5 OBJECTS AND RESULTS OF COOKERY and of culinary practice until long after the discovery and conquest of America. Fermented drinks were the natural outcome of sweet juices from fruit, apples, grapes, and others, or from exotic plants, such as the sugar-cane, or the maple, or the toddy-palm, or the Mexican agave. Fermented drinks from mcdted cereals were probably discovered later, but have been known to all cereal-cultivating nations at all times of which we have any historical record. A fermented drink from mareâ€™s milk, the Kiumys of the Kirgese of the Asiatic steppes, was described by the father of history, Herodotus, and remains a typical Kirgese product to this day. The manner in which many culinary processes are interlaced with processes for the production of stimulants or alcoholic intoxicants is illustrated by the fact that the same yeast which produces beer, wine and spirit ferments the bread made from cereals. Confectionery as a Measure of Culture. The few aphoristic hints contained in the foregoing para- graphs will suffice to direct the attention of the reader to the fact that the objects and results of cookery will be best understood by the light of its history. This we cannot pre- sume to treat systematically, but we will endeavour to give to our sympathizers such a short cjaicle to the historical litera- ture of cookery that they will be enabled to follow any part of the subject by means of special study. The history of human culUire, or that kind of development which passes under the unsuitable name of civilization, includes the history of the science of food-preparation ; and this branch affords sometimes interesting solutions of doubts, which no other kind of history can solve. We have proposed as a hypothesis, arising out- of the results of our culinary studies, that the state of culture of every nation could be estimated comparatively hy its con- fectionery, even when we knew little of its cookery, for

580 THE SPIRIT OF CdOHERY agglutinated by farce, with which all intervals are filled up. The farce may be boiled or baked as an independent cylinder, or as a houdin in a mould, and then placed upon the basis of the crust. To this cylinder the fillets are applied, and fixed with more forcemeat, or skewers, or string, or paper, or thin slices of bacon. When the prepara- tion has been built up, it is baked in the oven or steamed. We have seen recipes for so-called mazarines which yield mere forcemeat 23uddings (or boudins), steamed in a buttered mould and turned out on a dish; a cavity left or made in the middle of the forcemeat was to receive the ragout and sauce; the fillets, etc., and crayfish tails were fixed on the battlements of the timball as mere garnishes without any organic connection with it. These preparations do, there- fore, not essentially differ from the forcemeat puddings (entries de farce, as Careme so well named them) described above. They show no specific features, are in many respects inconvenient inversions of the principles which are observed in the preparation of the best entrees in pates, voi-au-vents, timballs, etc., and do not allow of that close association of meat and sauce which constitutes the charm of ragouts and of most other entrees. We therefore judge them much inferior to,the entrees in cases described above, and think that the principal culinary authors were right in omitting to take notice of them. CHAPTEE LII.

The use of ice and snow in Southern countries for cooling drinks in hot seasons is of very high antiquity, as can be seen from observations made by Hippocrates and Seneca

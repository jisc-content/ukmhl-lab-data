CRAMBAMBULl GINGER BEER, PULQUE 621 for a calming drink, containing mucilage and opium ; for the latter alcohol has been substituted. American Toddy is a cold bowl of rum punch in which several kinds of fruit are steeped. West Indian Sangaree is a brandy punch with Madeira wine, characterized by the addition of lime-juice. A French culinary author says that ‘ for a long time a bowl of burning punch was in England the last and in- dispensable service of every well-appointed meal.’ We have never seen punch on fire in this country, but we have witnessed on the Continent the production of the punch called cramhamhuli. It is made by setting fire to strong whisky contained in a soup-tureen or bowl, placed for safety in a cold water bath, and fusing sugar-candy on a wire-net fixed in the fiames ; the sugar, partly as caramel, dissolves in the whisky below. The preparation perhaps derives its name from hambalein, the Greek verb to stammer, as it is very intoxicating, although much of the spirit of the whisky is devoured by the flames. Ginger-beer, so called, is an excellent, refreshing, slightly alcoholic, effervescent, stimulating beverage ; the false non- fermented stuff made like soda-water should be distinguished from the classical preparation.

Pulque is the sap of several varieties of agaves, called pulcre, which are at home in Mexico; the sap, when drawn, ferments, yields a wine, and a spirit by distillation. The wine, qpdque f^tertc, is termed met or maguey by the in- habitants of Mexico ; the amount of alcohol contained in it may rise to nearly 6 per cent, by volume. Palm sap and wine, called toddy in India, is a product in the collection of which specially-trained persons are employed. Maqde yields a sap and a sugar. In North America these products are not rarely used for cooking; in Europe they hardly ever occur.

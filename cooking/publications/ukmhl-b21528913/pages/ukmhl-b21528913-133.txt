BOUILLON, OR ME AT-BROTH 105 moist dishes with its flavour and richness ; but this induced an excessive use of hot spices to counteract the sometimes sickening, or at all events unsympathetic, effect of a greasy diet, a result to which already Pliny* objected, and which may nevertheless be observed to be a matter of daily occur- rence in many parts of Europe. Where this oil was unavailing to impart taste and appe- tising qualities, certain extracts, we might term them sauces (liquamina) were used. Certain absurd reports, such as that these were made with the aid of salted pears, we may set aside, just as we set aside the fable of our days, that soy contained as a material ingredient extract from blackbeetles, while accepting the report of the preparation of some liqtiamina from valuable fish. Here, then, we have an approach to stock and glace ; the preparation of garum, when its history is properly interpreted, tended in the same direction. But the jiira and juscula, as described sufficiently in the work bearing the name of Apicius, were by no means con- stituted of strong meat-broth, but were mixtures of oil, acids, spices, and vegetable juices, the effect of which was calculated merely with reference to immediate desire for stimulation of the tongue and palate. While the Mediterranean countries used oil, the North of Europe consumed butter, clarified butter, lard, and other animal fats. The inhabitants of Central France suffered from an insufficient supply of both classes of fats, and thus had a particular inducement for that precious application of meat-broth which marks an epoch in the development of culture. And at the present time the majority of Europeans are so accustomed to this use of meat essence that even the refined part of the cookery of the ancients, and much of the cookery of the Spaniards, Italians and Greeks of our time, appears to us inattractive. * Voce ‘Greasy Diet’; cf.

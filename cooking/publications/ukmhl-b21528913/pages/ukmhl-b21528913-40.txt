THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 12 means operative artisans. This will enable him to judge of processes, their principles and results, and of materials and their adaptation to processes. He should next have a good knowledge of physics and chemistry, to be able to define accurately the metamorphoses effected by cookery, and to transform empirical traditions into rules emanating from understood principles. He should further possess a good knowledge of the historical literature of cookery of all times, as this alone will enable him to comprehend the gradual evolution of the art and the difiSculties through which it has progressed to its present high development. For this an extensive acquaintance with languages, both ancient and modern, is essential. He should further know practically, by study amongst the people of many lands, not only the so-called national dishes, but all piecidiar food- p>reparations from the most humble upwards to the most accomplished, and should aid this knowledge by an ex- tensive acquaintance with the general literature in which the state of the culture of different nations and different periods is recorded. He ought to make a very deep, and withal very critical, sUidy of his predecessors on the culinary field, without the least pharisaical bias, but with the firm intention of acquiring on the one hand all the available information, while on the other hand eliminating errors arising from ignorance or vanity; for the literature of cookery is remarkable for the conservatism not only of what is good and absolutely established, but also the pertinacity with which it retains a great bulk of useless dross, which has to be sifted out, as we have already shown above. Dr. Kitchiner read or consulted upwards of one hundred and eighty works for the purposes of his ‘ Oracle,’ and to these labours next to his genius the great value of his work is due. Plow little his practice has been followed by later authors is evident from the fact that most of them misspell his name, while many of them distort,

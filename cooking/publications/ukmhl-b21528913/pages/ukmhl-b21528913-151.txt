BOUILLON, OR MEAT-BROTH 123 loss as white of egg, and receives its flavour from the osmazome with which it is surrounded. It is during life in a peculiar irritable condition, which enables it to alternately contract and relax its particles ; this irritability ceases soon after death, and passes into a condition of hard, stable con- traction, or rigor, the first phenomenon of absolute somatic death, hence called rigor mortis. A cook may have occa- sion to take heed of this phenomenon for the following reason: If meat be set to cook, boil, or roast, before the rigor has set in, while it is yet warm and quivering imme- diately after the killing of the animal, it may become as tender, if it was otherwise of good quality, as meat which has been long hung ; but meat in the state of 7'igor mortis I will nearly always become hard or tough during cooking. I In practice meat is therefore allowed to hang exposed to ! fresh cold air at least until the rigor mortis has disappeared, and the flesh has become flexible or soft. While so ex- posed, meat breathesâ€”that is to say, takes in oxygen of the air and gives out carbonic acid, just as if it were endowed with lungs or respiratory organs. Amongst the manifold changes engendered by this breathing or oxygenation, one is very prominent as preliminary to roasting or boiling, namely, the production or increase of a quantity of lactic acid; as this acid is not quite identical with the acid produced during I the souring of milk, it is tefmed paralactic acid, and as it I reacts upon polarized light, it is also termed optically active r lactic acid, and as derived from flesh, sarcolactic acid. This I acid does not only contribute to make the meat more tasty, j but it also helps to make it more tender, by exercising a I solvent effect upon the fibrous and tendinous parts. This I solvent action also belongs to other organic acids, e.g,, acetic , acid, or vinegar, and is at times made use of to make naturally hard and tough meat quite tender. Another important substance with which the contractile fibres of coloured flesh are soaked is the red coloicring matter

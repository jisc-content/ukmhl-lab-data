THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 446 given after the first rapid broiling has coagulated the outside; then the steak bears slower ripening before the fire without becoming dry. Steak can be fried in a pan, and is then called pan-steak; if the fat and pan are hot enough, the steak is equal in quality to grilled steak, but a slow pan leaves it flabby. For frying, steak may be cut thinner than for grilling. The parts of beef ordinarily called steak,* meaning ‘ piece,’ may be prepared in many ways—by stewing with various garnishes, as kebabs or khubabs; as mince, in Spanish or Peninsular sauce; hashed, in cassarip sauce; hashed and braised, steioed in a baked pie, or in a boiled pudding. Ox-tongue may be dressed in the fresh state in all the modes applicable to beef, and is particularly tender when braised or steiued. More commonly, however, it is pickled before use, in various degrees of intensity. When it has been pickled, and not been taken out of the pickle for drying, it is called green. Such a tongue requires only a few hours’ soaking in cold water, gradual heating to ebulli- tion, and then gentle simmering for from three and a half to four hours. When a pickled tongue has been dried, and perhaps smoked, and is stiff and hard, it requires as much as twenty-four hours’ soaking in water before heat may be applied to it. Of Trip>e, Kitchiner says that it holds the same rank amongst solids that water-gruel does amongst soups. It is no doubt tasteless in itself, and if the non-striped muscular fibres contained in its walls (the tripe here con- sidered comes from the rumen, or first stomach of the ox) did contain any little savoury material, it must be lost in the difficult process of its preparation and boiling. It remains, therefore, mainly a body of connective tissue, and has to be boiled until it is nearly ready to dissolve to gelatine. It has to be bought at the tripe-shop, in the * See f^teak in the Vocabulary at tlio end of the volume.

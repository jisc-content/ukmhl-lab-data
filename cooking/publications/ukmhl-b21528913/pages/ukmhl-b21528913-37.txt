9 OBJECTS AND RESULTS OF COOKERY book on cookery.’ He might have added with emphasis that women can cook very well, and ought to do so, and actnally do so all over the world, but that the greatest amount of practice is not capable by itself to produce the truly philosophical qualifications which are essential to effectual authorship. A collection of recipes, even such as that of Cato of Utica, has no philosophical character, however meritorious it may be as a means of conservation, and however useful it may be in the limited circles to which it appeals. In the chapter on the historical literature of cookery will be found the names of two ladies who were authoresses of renowned treatises on cooking, one being Anna Wecker, 7iee Keller, the accomplished wife of the physician Wecker at Bale (1596); the other Maria Sophia Schellhammer, nee Conring (about 1700). These distinguished examples prove the general proposition, for while these authoresses were original in the collection of the materials, they wisely accepted the guidance of their husbands in those parts which tended towards an inception of a philosophical treat- ment of the subject. Physicians as Authors on Cookery. A great number of treatises on cookery, and amongst them the best, have been written physicians. Thus, the Italian Baptist Fiera published in 1490, therefore shortly before the discovery of America, the treatise quoted below, ‘ On Dinner and Diet.’ His forerunner (1471) Baptista Massa was a physician at Ferrara. In a number of trea- tises we easily distinguish the medical author, whether he be described as such or not. Sir Kenelm Digby'"'- wrote ‘The Closet of Cookery,’ London, 1669.; Sir Theodore &ir^ Xeneltn Digby, Knight, of Gothurst, Bucks, 1603-65, wrote also ‘ MedicinaExperirnentalis : Select Philosophical Secrets and Chyrnical E.x;- periments,’ 1672 ; ‘ Receipts in Physic and Surgery,’ etc. (ex Graesse, ‘Hist, of Literature,’ vi., 365, 366).

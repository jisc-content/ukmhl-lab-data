6 THE SPIIUT OF COOKER'i confectionery is the most advanced and refined part of cookery, and thus enables the expert to draw a conclusion backwards regarding the kind of cookery out of which it originated. Applying this hypothetical test, e.g., to the natives of India, we had to admit that they possessed no proofs of ancient civilization ; even curry and mulligatunny owe their quality to English skill of adaptation, while the purely Indian confections—that is to say, preparations con- sidered by Indian natives in the same light as that in which we consider macroons and meringues—are neither skilful in their execution nor attractive in their taste.* Qualifications for Authorship in Cookery. The Latin work of Apicius on the art of cookery is perhaps sufficient proof that a man may be an actual gastronomer, and yet be unable to compose even an intel- ligible work on his favourite subject. We have hazarded the surmise that the absurdities contained in the work were, perhaps, in part, later corruptions ; but these also must i have been added by persons conversant with practice, and j therefore help to prove the general proposition that mere practical acquaintance with cookery, maybe of a very high degree, does not by itself constitute a qualification for even i limited authorship. Cooks did, and do now, mostly rise | from the ranks of operatives, and have little or no oppor- I trinity for developing literary acquirements. They rise by I personal operative skill or handicraft, more or less aided I by personal address and appearance. Of course they study | culinary works for particular purposes, and are in posses- I * The so-called confectioneries made by native Hindoos in the Indian I and ColoniHl Exhibition in London were either indifferent to flatness, or j simply repulsive.

THE SPIRIT OP COOKERY i68 Clear Soui) with Macaroni, Plain Macaroni Soup.—Boil 1 lb. of pipe-macaroni, previously soaked in cold water, in a sufficiency of water to which some salt has been added. When they are nearly cooked, which will take about half an hour’s boiling in case they were not soaked, and less if they were swelled in cold water, drain them upon a napkin, and cut them in pieces of about an inch in length. Put them into a soup-pot, add two quarts of standard broth moderately flavoured with roots and herbs, or bits of fowl or game, and let it boil ten minutes longer. Send Parma cheese on a plate for each diner to help himself. Clear or Plain Vermicelli Soup.—Vermicelli, being made of the same paste as macaroni, but of very much thinner shape, are cooked much more quickly than the latter. Take half a pound of vermicelli, break them short, and keep them for three minutes in boiling water to remove any extraneous flavour which they may have acquired; drain them in a sieve, and put them in a stewpan with two quarts of any finished broth; boil until the vermicelli are done, which will take less than half an hour. Send to table with Par- mesan, or a mixture of Parma and Gruyere, cheese. As vermicelli are quickly cooked, they are useful for producing soup in a short time. They are more voluminous than macaroni, and hence half a pound only must be used with two quarts of standard broth, while of macaroni a whole pound can be put into the same quantity. When it is intended to produce a less nutritious and more liquid soup, 60 grammes of any kind of paste to the litre of finished broth is a good proportion. Plain Soup of Italian Paste, or Star Noxdlles.—The stars or paste of any shape require previous ablution with boiling water, like the vermicelli, but a little longer boiling in brotb. Plain Sotip of Lasagnes. — These ribbon-like forms of macaroni paste have to be treated in all respects like macaroni.

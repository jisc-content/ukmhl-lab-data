656 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY covered in the pan, and allowed to stew slowly on the embers. The process of meat preparation which demands the most time is hoilimj in water, but it has the advantage that no fat is necessary to begin with. Freshly-killed heef is unsuitable for boiling, some parts, such as the brisket, excepted, which can be boiled tender in two hours, provided it has been strongly beaten. All meat used in the field should be energetically beaten, as it becomes more tender and tasty by this bruising; the beating should not be effected on small, but mainly on large pieces of meat. The effect of beating, in ordinary life, of meat before cooking is differently stated by different authors—e.g., Kitchiner. We ourselves believe that the effect upon the quality of the meat is inappreciable; the piece or slice, however, preserves its flat or square shape better when beaten, and is not bent, twisted, and crumpled up so much as when it is left unbeaten. In case the meat provided for the soldiers came from old or lean or freshly-killed animals, no beating or cooking will be able to make it tender. In this case there is only one process which will make the meat eatable—namely, mincing. In the minced state it can be quickly cooked, and requires little additional chewing; it is also easily digested. The mincing is done with the sahre (a man may mince a pound of flesh in ten minutes), or, better, with a so-called sausage or rotary mincing machine. The mince may be stewed, or fried, or formed into balls and fried, and is then always tasty and digestible. As examples of the swiftness with which soldiers can prepare their meal with the aid of the mincing-machine, we quote the following facts from the Bohemian campaign in 1866 : At 10 o’clock two sheep were ' killed; at 10.40 the last portion of meat had passed through the mincing-machine; at 11 o’clock it was eaten. At 11 o’clock an ox was killed; at 1.30 the last piece of one

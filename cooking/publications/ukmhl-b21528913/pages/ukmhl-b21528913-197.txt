Compound Macaroni Sottp tvith Crayfish and Queiielles of Foiol. Compound Macaroni Soup with Soft Boes of Mackerel and Flakes of Salmon. Note on Semolina, French Nouilles, German Nudeln.— Semolina, in French more strictly semoule, is a paste made of wheat-flour or grits, similar to macaroni, but containing yolk of eggs, which is not present in macaroni. This paste, as used in France, is called nouilles paste; in Germany, NicdelmTeig. It is perhaps most used in the latter country, and is of better taste than macaroni; but as the latter are sold ready-made, and the nouilles have to be made in the kitchen, the former have much displaced their superior rivals. Mode of making Semolina, or Nouilles, or Nudeln.—We give a description of this important process here, as it is not often described in English culinary works. Place lb. of flnest wheat-flour on the pastry-board or the marble slab, make a hollow crater in the centre, and place in it four yolks of eggs, a little cream or warmed butter, some tincture of nutmeg and pepper, and some salt; work this mixture until all the flour is incorporated so as to form a very stiff dough. Poll out and double it repeatedly, and ultimately roll it out to very thin sheets of dough, and hang them up to dry. Then roll them up, and cut them with a knife into strips of such width, varying between one-eighth of and half an inch, as the exigencies require. Loosen and strew these ribbons over a baking-sheet covered with paper, and dry them for several hours before the fire or in the warm closet.

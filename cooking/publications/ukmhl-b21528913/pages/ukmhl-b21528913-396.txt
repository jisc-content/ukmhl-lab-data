THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 368 to send the dishes which may be fancied for production in ornamental croustades to table in appropriate vessels of ornamental porcelain. Several of the recipes for orna- mental croustades which we perused showed very great disparity between the cost of the vessel (mainly in labour, forcemeat, and fat; we say cost, for its only vahie is what it contributes to the pig-tub) and the value of the contents— calf’s-tail, lamb’s brains, fat livers; such were some of the interesting items proposed for reception and presentation to guests in these vessels of perverted bread. To think of a Strasburg completely - finished patty being dug out of its ornamental porcelain jar, and worried in a sautapan between fat bacon, in wine mirepoix, with truffles and mushrooms, and quenelles of game, and at last insulted by a garnish of a border of cJouhle white cocks' combs, is a painful operation, and we should advise all patrons of good cookery to dis- countenance so useless and, in more than one sense, lament- able a waste of natural substance and human effort. Itcdian crustini are circular slices of breadcrumb fried in oil or butter, and bearing on their excavated tops a small portion of a savoury ragout or mince, and on this a small ball of Parma cheese kneaded with butter, a symbol of the Indian tortoise bearing the world on its back. Alphabetical List of the Principal Pastries mentioned in Culinary Works. We have collected this list mainly from French sources, and, as the names indicate, most of the pastries are of French origin, but a portion are English, German, and Italian. We have added some definitions which may be useful to our readers : Biscotin : Obsolete sweetmeat formerly made and sold by nuns. Biscuit: Hiwnxje-cake of English; imn d’ouro of the Portuguese.

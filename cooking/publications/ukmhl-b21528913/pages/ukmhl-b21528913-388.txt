THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 360 Appendix. Particular Vegetables grown and* obtainable in India for Use there. Of so-called country vegetables suitable for cooking in India, the following are useful: Brinjals (binegitm), the fruit of the solanaceous plant already alluded to above; bandekai {bhindi); greens (bhagee); podolonghai (cJmchoonda); moringakai {mooringa); varmis beans; country cucumber, a variety differing from the European; small tomato, prac- tically only an ornamental toy; maize {mucka cholum in Tamil); sorrel; pumi)kin; yams; large and small onions; and street potatoes.

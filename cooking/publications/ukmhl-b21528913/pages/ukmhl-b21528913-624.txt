596 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY with all the whites of eggs in them, are symptoms of the decadence of culinary art. The combinations of omelette are many, and may be seen in ordinary recipe collections ; a great number of ragovits can be served on a basis of omelette. Omelette with Panna Cheese is an agreeable homogeneous dish. The addition of oysters to omelettes is unnecessary, and not specific; that of kidneys is esteemed incongruous. Of Omelette with Tumiy (French omelette au thon), Savarin says that this dish should be reserved for fine dejeuners and meetings of amateurs, who know what they are doing. He adds a few notes th^oriques, which are three very commonplace rules, the last one being that the dish bearing the omelette should be warmed. Omelettes with fruit—as distinguished from confitures— e.cj., straioherries or apples, contain flour in their composi- tion, and have, according to our definition, to be ranged tvith fritters. Several other preparations which are termed omelettes in collections of recipes are either souffles or puddings, or peculiar preparations not easily classified. Scrambled eggs, synonym stirred eggs, French oeufs hrouilUs, are a kind of spoiled omelette. Of additions to omelettes we mention forcemeat, which makes them very savoury, but must be cooked independently, and crayfish tails. Some pirepiarations of hard-boiled eggs should be remem- bered. Thus, Hard-boiled Eggs in Onion Sauce (a la Sauce Bobcrt) may come in usefully; the French term the dish CEnfs a la Tripe, which is quite unexplained. Gratinated Eggs form a solid and savoury dish, which may be made with fresh or boiled eggs. Skcffed, filled, or farcied eggs are an artistic dish of good appearance. The hard whites neatly divided serve as cups, in which the farce incorporated with the yolks is lodged. The dish may be served either hot or cold—e.g., at suppers. Baked Yolks

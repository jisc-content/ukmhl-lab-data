THE SPIRIT OF COOKER) 620 viscosity the taste may linger a little longer on tongue and palate than would that of a thinner liquid. Four quarts of punch may receive a pint of made calf’s-foot jelly, contain- ing about half an ounce of dry gelatine. Eegent’s Pimch is a highly-compounded form ; the syrup is obtained by stewing 4 lb. of chopped muscatel raisins, filtering the juice, and condensing it, adding thereto sugar- candy. Dissolve this in a pint of strong green tea; add half a pint of rum, a pint of cognac, a bottle of madeira, a pint of cura^oa, half a pint of pineapple syrup, a bottle of seltzer-water, and two bottles of champagne.

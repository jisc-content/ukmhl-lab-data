The Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries—English Culinary Works. In England the learned Eobert Warnert published a work of mainly an historical character, on the cookery of the ancient English. It was entitled ‘ Culinary Antiquities ; or, Curious Traits relating to the Culinary Affairs of the Old English.’ It consists of the following six parts: 1. The Forme of Cury. A roll of ancient cookery compiled about 1390 by the master cooks of King Eichard II.; 196 for- mulae, with list, and numbered. 2. A contemporaneous manuscript with 91 formulae. 3. A collection of recipes in English cookery, date uncertain. 4. Eecipes for the pre- servation of fruit. 5 and 6. Details of the viands consumed at the feasts following the enthronisation of bishops and archbishops. Also additional notes at the end of the volume.

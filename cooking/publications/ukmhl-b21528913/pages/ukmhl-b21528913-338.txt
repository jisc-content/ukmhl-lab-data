310 THE SPIRIT OF COOIIFRY Purdes of Cucumber, Pumpkin ami Ver/etahla Marrow, or Gourd, are excellent preparations, provided their water be condensed and they be made savoury by coulis. White and creamy dressings are less attractive. The puree of the edible large pumpkin has a fine golden or orange colour ; it is much used in France. The pulp contains much of the tender cellulose which is digestible. Purde of French (green) Beans is a passable form for green beans which have become stringy; applied to tender pods it seems a superfluity, a waste. Its colour may be improved by the addition of spinach-extract. Of the Purees of Boots cc7icl Tubers, that of the Four Boots so called, or a la Croissy, consists of onions (which are bulbsj, and three true roots, namely carrots, turnips, and paisnips.

A perusal of the list of purees does, however, yield evidence that some of them are used as entremets only in the un- diluted state, while others are used exclusively in so^ij^s. To these latter belongs the Puree of Carrots, which is not used as an independent dish. The carrots must be braised in savoury coulis. Purde of Turnips is used as an independent dish. It may be prepared in two forms, ivhite and broirn; the latter is less digestible. Some cooks add breadcrumb or panada to this puree to restore consistency after addition of the savoury sauce. The Purdes of Celeriac and Parsnip are best dressed with espagnole ; those of Topuiambur or Jerusalem Artichoke have a fine flavour which should not be overtoned by additions. Purdes of Potatoes are not quite congruent with mashed potatoes, but have to be kept a trifle thinner. Amongst the Purdes of Bulbs, that of onions takes the first

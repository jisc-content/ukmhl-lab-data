. THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 276 Cold Charlottes or Pudding-like Preparations in which any of the Five Varieties of Cream may he employed. The }iot Charlottes are real puddings, and contain no cream, e.g., those of apples or apples and brown bread ; but the cold varieties belong to this place in the system, as they principally consist of compound creams. There is no history to the name, and they are defined by French authors as Plats d'entremets a la creme et aux fruits. Compound Cream Charlottes, commonly called Charlotte Basse, or Charlotte a la Crtme dite d laBusse, or d la Bichelieu, is an artistic outer case of sponge-cake filled with any of the compound creams above alluded to. When different jellies are employed, arranged in compartments, the Charlotte d la Brunoy is produced. When the case is constructed of fresh strawberries, agglutinated by liquid jelly, a macedoine-like charlotte ensues, called in French works Celestine Straxoherry Cream. When the case is made of agglutinated almonds, supported by two layers of com- pound creams, and a custard cream jelly in the centre, a so-called Panachde Cream, or Cream d Surprise, results. Starch Jellies or Flummeries. Flummery signifies an acid jelly made from the husks of oats, the Scotch sowers ; the word derived from the Welsh llymry, or llymrig, harsh, raw, or llym, sharp, severe, has also acquired a metaphorical meaning equivalent to insipid compliment. That the husks of oats should produce an acid by fermentation is analogous to the result of the fermentation of bran, which produces acids of the fatty acid series, particularly proprionic, useful in the preparation of morocco, kid, and wash leather. But the origin of the jelly, or any jelly, from husks is less easy to explain. We have nowhere met with any description of the manner in which this original Scotch acid jelly might be produced.

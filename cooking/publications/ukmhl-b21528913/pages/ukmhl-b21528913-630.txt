6o2 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERl here the art and practice of preparation deteimines the result, the theoretical demand being for a maximum of alcohol and a minimum of acid. This is satisfied by beating or stirring the milk strongly at a temperature of 30° to 35° C. while exposed to the air; the agitation does not prevent the lactic acid fermentation, advances the alcoholic fermentation, and prevents the butyfic acid fermentation. The latter, when it occurs, makes kumys undrinkable for persons of refined taste. The caseine of mare’s milk undergoes important changes during the fermentation; at first it is in part precipitated, but later on redissolves, so that while after 3 days about 14 per cent, of the precipitate may be redissolved, after 16 days 36 per cent, are found in solution. The sugar of milk diminishes rapidly, in the first 24 hours from the normal 54 in 1,000 of milk to 18 parts; it falls further after 2 days to 15 parts, after 3 to 12, after 5 to 9, after 9 to 7, after 16 days to 6 per mille. The alcohol in 1,000 parts of kumys is on an average after 24 hours 12 parts per mille, after 2 days 15 parts, after 5 days 18, after 16 days 20 parts per mille. In kumys 5 months old, which no longer contained any sugar of milk, the amount of alcohol was 32 in 1,000. The lactic acid rises to 4 per cent, in the first 24 hours, and then scarcely doubles in 16 days. 1,000 parts of kumys contain after 24 hours 5 parts, after 2 days 6 parts, after 3 days 7 parts, after 5 days 8 parts. After this period the acid decreases again by combination with alcohol (etheriza- tion) to 7 on the ninth day, and rises to scarcely 8 again on the sixteenth day. The kumys of the first day has thus the same amount of acid as the best wines, the latter expressed as tartaric acid. The resolution of the lyrecipi- tated caseine is partly due to the increase of the lactic acid, partly to change by peptonization. Kumys is mostly made in vessels constructed of smoked horse-skins, but also in wooden tubs; its ferment is a mix-

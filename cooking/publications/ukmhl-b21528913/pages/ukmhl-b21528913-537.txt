509 QUAIL AND GROUSE applicable only in case it be desired to keep the roasts for some time in a cold state; then the vine-leaf prevents it from getting dry. A recipe for Qtcails au Gratin comes from Beauvilliers. The birds are boned and stuffed with a farce au gratin, bedded on and imbedded in farce, and baked on a silver dish. Quails loith Truffles, or a la Financihre, are also to be boned, stuffed, and braised, or twice egged, crumbed, and fried, garnished with Toulouse ragoAt and qtienelle force- meat. The breasts or fillets admit of all the preparation given for fowl and pheasant. Other braised forms some- times produced in the French kitchen are grotesque ragorlts, such as Cailles a I’Anglaise, in which eight quails, a calf’s brain in halves, and nine chipolata sausages are cooked with bacon, bouillon and champagne; or Cailles a la Cendrc aux Ecrevisses, a funny mixture of quails and crayfish, calculated for a show dish in the restaurant. Numerous are the preparations termed fillets, or scallops (which had better be termed bouchees), all named after sauces or ragouts with which they are allied. Some receive names from particular herbs, which are intended to impart their flavour, such as au kmrier, au basilic. Others, again, are to be covered with salpicon, and repose on arti- chokes. Of ragouts there is one called en compote, another poupeton, because baked in a mould ; a third and good recipe refers to a pate chaud; there are also several tourtes de cailles, but with little specificity. There are given in different books recipes for seven varieties of soup), all characterized by the presence of quail. One bears the absurd name of Bisque de Cailles. In these preparations the characteristic flavour of the birds is entirely lost. Gf grouse there are in this country three kinds, the black, the red, and the white. The male black grouse in the North is called blackcock (in French coq de bncylre); the female is called gray hen. In the South of England

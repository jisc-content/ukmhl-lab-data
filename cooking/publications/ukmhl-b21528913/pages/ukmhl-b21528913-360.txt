THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 332 Green French and Broad Beans and Scarlet Runners. Raw green beans, before the development of their seeds, have a decidedly sweet taste. Like cabbage, they undergo a fermentation, which, when it is guided by the addition of salt and proper treatment, results in the production of lactic acid—the characteristic ingredient of sour milk. Such fer- mented or sour beans are made and eaten by millions of inhabitants of the northern part of the continent of Europe, and in Russia are the principal vegetable food, by the availability of which throughout the winter the peasants produce some variety in their monotonous black bread and fish diet, and ward off scurvy. Now, this sweet taste and fermentability of beans is due to the presence of a sugar, which, as it was first discovered in beans, was called 2)Jiaseomannite, from i^iiaseohbs, the Latin diminutive of the Greek and Ijatin name for bean, and mannite, the sugar of manna, to which it appeared to have some similarity. It was next discovered that this was identical with a sugar which had been observed previously in flesh, and termed inosite; but what was still more remarkable, it was found that it abounded regularly in the human brain. It was then observed in small quantities in many parts of vegetables, and some sweet Sauterne wines were found to owe their taste—at least, in part—to this carbo-hydrate. It crystal- lizes, and looks like a diminutive cauliflower. It is not capable of being fermented by yeast, but is decomposed by the lactic acid bacillus, and can be transformed into an explosive, equal in power to smokeless gunpowder. Now, seeing that inosite is unquestionably food for the brain as well as the muscles, it is right to look to its con- servation in our food, and avoid its extraction. Green beans should therefore never be boiled, whereby the bean- sugar is lost to a great extent in the water; but should be stewed, so as to preserve all their immediate principles.

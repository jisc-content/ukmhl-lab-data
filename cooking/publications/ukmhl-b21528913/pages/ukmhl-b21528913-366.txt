THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 33Â« Nivernaise, and that the compound dish is only d la Niver- naisc. A dish of mere turnips should, therefore, not be passed under that name. Gourd, or Vegetable Marrow. The fruit of the Cucurbitaceoe contains from 90 to 95 per cent, of water. In the melon this is a virtue, as it produces its juiciness ; in the raw cucumber it is objectionable, as it dilutes the dressing for salad. A juicy cucumber is, there- fore, best sliced, salted, and pressed before use as salad. The most watery is the small pumpkin or gourd called vegetable marroxo. Merely boiled in water it is nearly taste- less, and only helps to moisten a dry dish; but it acquires quality by being stewed with consomme or standard broth, and dried considerably during the stewing, so as to get its juices more concentrated and its taste more pronounced. This fruit bore its proper name of gourd up to about 1830, after which its present appellation came into vogue. Some eat it plain-boiled, tuith sauce; others stewed and glazed. When stuffed or farcied and steioed it becomes an excellent ragout-like dish. Cucumbers. Cxicximbers may be treated in the same manner as gourds provided they be not too thin and suflBciently ripe to easily part with their seed-pulp. Stewed, and in sauce, after previous soaking in salt water and vinegar, called marin- ading, they yield a ragout which is very suitable as garnish. The juice must be suitably reduced. Pumpkins. The pumpkin, French potiron, German Kiirbis, is used by the French with great dexterity for the production of soups, purdes, creams, tarts, and other entremets. It is a resource of the kitchen in many colonies, e.g., the Cape of Good Hope, where the Kaffirs almost live upon it at certain times

JELLIES, SAVOURY, SWEET, AND COMPOUND 261 An ounce of gelatine in a quart of water will make a firm jelly; this quantity of the finest glass-like gelatine should cost less than twopence ; on the other hand, calf’s foot will only yield jelly equal in weight to its own absolute weight, or 2 lb. of calf’s foot will yield a quart of jelly, or just as much as 1 oz. of gelatine will produce. But now con- sider the work and expense required to get that ounce of gelatine out of the calf’s foot; you have to purchase it, and its price may be Is. 4d.; you must split it, and for the mere purpose of saving space remove the principal bones ; you must then parboil it, wash and boil it anew with the water which is to be the jelly. A kilogram of calf’s foot (or 2 lb.) is generally put on the fire with litres (a gallon) of water, boiled and skimmed, and kept boiling during from four to five hours, to extract as much gelatine as will correspond to one thirty-second part of the weight of the water which remains after 34 litres have evaporated, namely, 1 litre, or about 31 grm., or nearly 1 oz. We will not work out the details of our proof mathematically, but they are overwhelming already, to the effect that gelatine prepared de, novo from calf’s foot costs at least sixteen times as much as the best gelatine sold in trade; and if it be of equal quality to the latter in all other respects, it will certainly be less clear, and have to be clarified at further expense, which will greatly increase its price. The two varieties of jellies, those naturally making them- selves from fruit juice under the influence of stirring or evaporation, and those produced by the addition to a solution of starch, or agar-agar, are made with the aid of carbo-hydrates, or substances consisting of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen only, without any nitrogen ; while the third vai’iety of jellies, including the savoury ones, which are not ordinarily made with carbo-hydrates, are produced with animal gelatine, such as the swimming-bladder of fish, the

62 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY All stirring is to be effected with tvooclen spoons, or spatulas, except where directed otherwiseâ€”e.g., in the case of the contents of broken eggs, which are to be mixed and stirred by a broom made of wire. The jtdce and g)^dp of lemons, sweet and hitter oranges, are to be kept entirely free from pips or seeds, as these impart a bitter and objectionable taste to the product. Apples not used entire are to be peeled, and all parts of the seed-capsule, or core, are to be entirely removed. Baisins not expressly commanded to be used whole, and not being sultanas, are to be stoned, so as to be absolutely free from kernels or seeds. All raisins should either be plumped in a minimum of hot water, or be boiled or stewed with the preparation in which they are to be eaten, so that their skins may be quite tender. Baisins or currants should not be put on the top of baked puddings or tarts, where they are liable to be shrivelled and burnt. All c^orrants are to be picked on a sheet of paper, being spread over the sheet in a thin layer ; more particularly all small stones are to be removed, as these are liable to injure the teeth of eaters. Sand and other impurities are to be removed by washing. Bice also must be spread on paper and inspected to remove small xohite stones, which, derived partly from the mill- stones under which it is peeled, are frequently contained in it; it must also be washed in several waters to remove sand. Beef and other suet must be fresh and untainted, and should always be tested by the smell immediately before use. Eggs, after being broken, should be tested singly by the smell, and the yolks, as well as the whites, when used separately, should each be so tested before being mixed with others. A single mouldy egg will spoil a voluminous dish.

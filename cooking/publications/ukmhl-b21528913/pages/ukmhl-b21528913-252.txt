224 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY sufficiently or too strongly flavoured. To make such dry food moister, to lubricate it and thus aid in its use, to increase the attractiveness of the taste by additions of flavours and juxtaposition of contrast, to hide or mask excessive flavours, certain liquid additions have been in- vented which pass by the naiue of sauces. A liquid such as we now define as a sauce the Eomans termed jws, but it is uncertain how far they distinguished between meat juice or gravy and accessory liquids such as we now term soups. This word jiis remains in French, but with a more closely circumscribed significance, namely, gravy. This may not be a compound, but merely the juice issuing from the meat, or extracted from it by direct means. The mere addition of hot water to jus makes it bouillon. Jus and bouillon are the bases of all sauces and soups. Sauces are no longer comprised under the Eoman termy^ra (the plural of pis), although this expression had prevailed for centuries, and been current in the Middle Ages. It is surmised that the jura became in practice gradually mixed with the artificially-prepared solutions in which meat was preserved or matured for cooking, and thus the salsugo or salsilago of Pliny, the briny pickle in which meat was stowed away, furnished the name for the liquid with the aid of which it was eaten. When salt was rare, salted jura were of much greater importance than they are now, when salt is prudently mixed with all appropriate dishes, and placed before the eater for use at his discretion. Thus a standard jus became a salsuvi or a salsa, in Italian salza, which the French transformed into saulza, and ultimately into sauce. The importance of sauce as a lubricating principle is easily demonstrated by an experiment on potatoes made with and without any sauce. But if a sauce, in addition to lubricating the morsel, also stimulates the organs of taste, it causes an increase of the salivary secretion, and by thus

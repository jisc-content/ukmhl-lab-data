KITCHEN REQUISITES AND CULINARY AXIOMS 63 All fish is to be scalded, scaled, drawn, cleansed, and trimmed before use in the recipes, except where modifications are expressly prescribed. Eemove all hoiUd fish immediately from the water in which it has been cooked; if it be left in the water it will lose in flavour and firmness. Do not send plain boiled fish to table on a napkin, nor garnished round with cold and wet parsley, nor with fried small fish; the latter generally becomes sodden and spoiled, while the mixed vapours rising from both kinds of fish are detrimental to the flavour of each. Nutmeg is never used in any other form except the grated condition ; it is therefore not necessary, in recipes, to use the participle ‘grated’ as an adjective every time that nutmeg is mentioned. Poimding is always done in a mortar ; it is therefore not necessary in recipes always to mention this receptacle in connection with pounding. Never pour cold or hot water into a dry, hot cast-iron, porcelain, or earthen vessel, as it is liable to crack ; k t the vessel cool down before putting the liquid into it. Copper vessels are the least liable to injury by this ill- treatment, wrought-iron ones also little; but cast-iron saucepans are easily cracked; cold porcelain (china) and earthenware vessels are also liable to crack by the sudden contact with hot liquids or with flame. Therefore warm all such vessels gradually, either with the cold liquid in them, or before putting hot liquid into them. We might multiply these aphoristic cautions and axioms, but prefer to recite any others which are now in our mind’s eye in connection with the detail out of which they arise.

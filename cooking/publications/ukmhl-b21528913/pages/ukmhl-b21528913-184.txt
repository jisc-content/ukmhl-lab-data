If so, we would beg them to omit soup from the menu, for as at present offered these ghosts of soups of the past produce an impression which it requires a host of good entries and entremets to obliterate. CHAPTEE IX. SOUPS CHAEACTERIZED BY PARTICULAR VEGETABLES. The knowledge of the theory of broths and of the practice of their'production would enable any practical person to construct any soups belonging to the ten divisions. But, unfortunately, the practice of cookery does not repose upon recognised principles, but on recipes, many of which are based upon flagrant error, such as that which we have exposed concerning bones. There is no soup worthy of the name which does not contain an element of vieat savour. Whenever that is absent, a substitute is adopted in the shape of a strong vegetable flavour. Some of this flavouring is also adopted to support the savour of broth, and when used with moderation blends admirably with it, and is free from unÂ£Esthetic consequences ; we mean leek more particu- larly, and a portion of onion subsidiarily, at times when leek is out of season.

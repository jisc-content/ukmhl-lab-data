PUREES OF VEGETABLES 305 cooked. Later on a terrine came to be composed of several varieties of meat braised together, and served in a vessel still called terrine—i.e., earthenware pan—but mostly made of silver or porcelain, or enamelled iron. Prepared ragouts, or cold pates, such as the livers of chocks of Toulouse or of Nerac, are sold and sent in terrines (tureens). ^ The Terrine d Vancienne mode, or clu Louvre, made according to a recipe by Leclercq, had the greatest reputation amongst dishes of this kind; its ingredients were fat chicken, partridge, back of hare, nut of veal and of mutton, all larded and spiced, boiled in broth, with roasted chestnuts and fine herbs added. CHAPTER XXIV. PUREES OF VEGETABLES USED AS GARNISHES OR AS ENTREES. The name puree was originally confined to pea soup, as we see from Varenue,* where it is considered as interchangeable with this (‘Potage aux pois, ou puree'). The soaked and swelled peas are to be boiled, and the bouillon is to be taken off without crushing the peas; if more bouillon be wanted, a second decoction may be made. It was this bouillon without the peas which was termed pur&e, and was more particularly specialized as puree claire, and used as the bouillon for soups au maigre. Thus, the frog sooip and crayfish soup (‘ Potage aux ecrevisses en fa^on de bisque’) were to be made with it,f and it was declared preferable to fish bouillon. But in the course of time the entire pea soup, with the crushed and disintegrated peas in it, was called puree, and then gradually the liquid was lost * Varcnno, loc. cil., p. 71. t Bdd., loc. cU., pp. 78, 79. 20

AERATED WATERS. WINES 613 waters having much increased, mnnufnctonss were estab- lished in which common water was impregnated with carbonic acid gas, made at one time from soda, whence the water was called soda-xoater. In the present day all such waters are impregnated with gas made from chalk, or its ground, pulverulent form, called lohiting. The gas is gen- erally placed under high pressure, because the public are under the erroneous impression that they get the more of the stimulating effect of the gas the more of it is con- tained in the water. But the opening of such an over- charged bottle only leads to effervescence, loss of gas, and not rarely to uproarious overflow of water; and the water remaining in the bottle is immediately, by the unavoidable commotion, made more flat than would be natural mineral water charged under ordinary air-pressure, and at the temperature of the earth. But this delusion on the part of the public has gone further. Natural mineral waters are now deprived of their carbonic acid, and then recharged with it; and for the results of this operation the public are content to pay high prices. Distilled aerated waters are the best, because they are not only free from organic impurities, but also free from those salts which in some of the most vaunted waters rise to an undue amount. Artificially aerated waters from common, perhaps infected, wells, or conducted supplies, are very unsafe, as the aeration kills none of the infectious germs, but rather favours the life of some of them. Wine and its varieties concern us in this work only in so far as they are used in the actual culinary preparation of dishes, or in as far as they serve the oesthetical purpose of beverages to be used in the course of meals, and particularly feasts. The wines of Xerez, or sherries, are white, and generally would ho the best of all were they not afflicted with two adulterationsâ€”plaster of Paris and spirit. Owing to con-

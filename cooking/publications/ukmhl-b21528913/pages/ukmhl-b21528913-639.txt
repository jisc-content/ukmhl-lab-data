6ii son AND HARD WAIER CHAPTEE LVII. BEVERAGES : WATER, WINE, CIDER, BEER, SPIRITS, CUPS, SHERBETS, TEA, COFFEE, AND TISANES. Water is the universal beverage of organized beings; it is the liquefying agent by the solvent action of which both the constructive and destructive processes of nutrition and pro- duction of power are carried on. Water should be clear, that is to say, free from saspenclcd impiirities, and should be equally free from dissolved matter. The suspended im- purities are more easily recognised and removed, while the dissolved ones are recognisable only by chemical reactions, and for the most part irremovable. The dissolved impurities, which are of objectionable influence upon various processes of cookery, are those which produce in water the qualities called temporary and permanent hardness. Temporary hard- ness is produced by solution of carbonate of lime (carbonate of calcium or chalk) under the influence of excess of car- bonic acid (carbonic anhydride). This can be removed by boiling the water during a few minutes, when the carbonic anhydride passes away, or by addition of caustic lime, whereby the anhydride is neutralized, and in each case the chalk is deposited as a white or dusky powder. Permanent hardness, however, is caused by the presence of soluble neutral calcium salts, mainly sulphatu or gypsum, and of magnesium salts, mainly sulphate and chloride. Both forms of impurity are distinctly injurious in many processes of cookery to the food to be prepared, e.g., to leguminous seeds, as haricot beans, which are made hard thereby; to green vegetables, which loss colour and tenderness; to jellies, which are made turbid. In a great many cases of cookery soft or distilled water is therefore absolutely essential to success; haricot beans, peas, etc., are not only made hard in

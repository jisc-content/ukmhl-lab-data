565 MEAT PIES AND THEIR SAVOUR The regulation of the piguancy of meat pies is one of the most important topics of their philosophy. Those who of opinion that savoury pies, pasties, and patties are dishes contrived rather to excite than to satisfy the appetite will think little of them unless they be highly spiced and made piquant with zest, curry-powder, forcemeat linings, quenelles, gravy, fungi, wine, herbs, pickles, and spices. But this is not at all owr idecuof pie, which, on the contrary, relates to a substantial nutritive preparation, and, as will be seen from , a perusal of the recipes contained in the best magiric works, is supported by the principles upon which nearly all are eonstructed, namely, that all those materials which have an insufficient amount of solid nutritive substance about them are to be supported by the liberal addition of such material in another shape, e.g., beef, veal, ham, farce, eggs, etc. Now, it is just this combination which enables a cook to reach in a pie a very high degree of savour, while avoiding the mere piquancy of stimulating preparations. It is for this reason that we have insisted upon the necessity of limiting or toning down all flavourings derived from onions and their relatives; that we have excluded wine from these preparations almost entirelyâ€”in short, that we have equi-, poised their entire spicing, flavouring, and seasoning to the demands of polite society. The addition of cassareep to puddings and pies containing meat of quadrupeds or birds, or both, is highly to be recom- mended. Veal pies have not rarely an insipid taste and a blanched colour, disadvantages which are overcome by the addition of this extract and of some made gravy. \Vith beef, veal, fowl, rabbit, kidneys, and their compound pies, the addition of cassareep effects a remarkable improvement; but it must be done judiciously, not to overload the sauce with strong extract, and make its character too pronounced. The cook should study the application of cassareep by beginning to use it in drops, gradually rising to tea and

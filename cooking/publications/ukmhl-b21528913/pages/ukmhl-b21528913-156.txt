128 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY less nourishing. He obtained gelatine from the jack (fish), but not from the mackerel. Cartilage was dissolved almost entirely, and yielded a strong gelatine. The name gelatina was first employed by Spielmann, in 1766, in his chemical essays,* and in French by Eoussille Chamseru.t The English physician Bostock was the first to estimate the quantity of gelatine required to make water gelatinize; he found the minimum to be 1 per cent. Herissant, in 1758, undertook a remarkable research on bones. He steeped them in a mixture of four parts of water and one part of fuming nitric acid, and found that after a time they had lost their hardness, and were represented by an insoluble matter which had retained the shape of the bones, was flexible and of organic nature; a calcareous matter had dissolved in the acid; it was not then diagnosed as phosphate and carbonate of lime, but the fact was proved that bone consists of an organized tissue and a calcareous matter. In 1766 Herissant extended these inquiries to the shells of molluscs living on the earth, or in fresh or salt water, and to madrepores and corals. In 1775 Changeux published, in the Journ. de Physique, an extensive article ‘ on a mode of extracting alimentary matters from several substances in which they were not known to exist,’ etc. According to him some spoonfuls of powdered bone of the ox or calf, boiled for an hour with water, ‘ should yield an enormous quantity of jelly, as savoury and restorative as the jelly of meat.’ In 1791 Proust perceived that the substance which yields gelatine exists in flesh and bone, and that although it is present in flesh in much smaller quantities than in bone, it is much more easily dissolved out of flesh than it is out of hone, in which latter it is hardened and compressed in cells impregnated with bone-earth. He compared the quantity t Journ. Gen. de Mid. Hx. 120. * ‘ Annotationes Chemicfe.’

But as a knowledge of cookery is of general necessity, its teaching must be, even when quite elementary, of universal applicability. There is much evidence in favour of collateral advantages which good cookery may, and does, confer upon society, e.g., in preventing and counteracting the too common tendency to excessive consumption of alcoholic liquids. In relation thereto also it may be hoped that this treatise will contribute to the progress of hygienic knowledge and con- duct, and thus aid on all sides in the evolution and prac- tice of humanitarian principles, and in the embellishmen and prolongation of human existence. 11, Pembroke Gardens, London, W.

397 BRIOCHE, PLAIN AND COMPOUND (lough and a hutter-ancl-egg stirred dough, which are mixed and doubled up a great number of times to produce the greatest amount of useful sponginess. When the brioche is intended to serve as a inece dc fond, and be of large size, it should' be baked in a buttered paper case. It is best eaten hot with the early coffee, and should be broken with the fingers or a silver fork. The preparation of the dough, and the adaptation of the shape to the size, and the modes of baking the various sizes, are all evidence of the care and ingenuity which has to be bestowed upon it; the baking, e.g., has to avoid two extreme faultsâ€”namely, that the interior shall not be underbaked, and that the exterior shall not be scorched, and not be burst in the rising. When it is intended to use the brioche as fancy bread, or sell it in definite portions, it may be moulded in diminutive shapes, in conical tins, dariole forms, or fancy shapes, such as twisted masses, rings, twisted rings like the torta of Eome, fingers, and others. For small compoiind fancy brioches for parties some confectioners introduce into the dough dried cherries, candied peel, pineapple, angelica, and some liqueur. Of this compound dough they make a ball as nucleus, and surround it with a shell of dough free from these in- gredients. A recipe for a Brioche with Cheese has been given by Cour-* champs, but it is in parts somewhat obscure in consequence of the overcrowding of expressions. The result of the execution of the recipe will certainly be tasty, but, owing to the large amount of hidden fat, and the general richness of the ingredients, it will call for a vigorous digestion. Dr, Ignotus would have said that it was full of gout. Under the name of Briochines Vertes occur in French works recipes for the dumpilings brought from Saxony to France by Baron Miilbacher, a former Saxon ambassador. We have classified them as what they are, as their fancy name is misleading.

ASPARAGUS 327 Asparagus. The name of asparagus is said to be derived from asper, as many species of this genus are very spiny. This state- ment shows the danger of endeavouring to derive names from similarity of sound, or subordinate qualities of the objects named.

It has no connection at all with the Latin adjective aspar, but might possibly be related to the Greek aspartos, signifying a plant which grows wild and is not sown. Such a name could well be suggested by the perennial character of the plant, which is found round the Mediterranean, and in its warmer homes shoots twice a year. The asparagus of our gardens is an improved form of this wild shore-plant, and in botany bears the name of officinal, because its roots (not its shoots) were formerly much used in medicine as one of the five major ap>eritives, which were combined in a syrup bearing that name. The red berries also had similar properties, and their fermentable juice was an ingredient of the Benedict Electuary. Only to the young shoots pharmaceutical properties were never ascribed, while their dietetic and nutritive properties were so highly appreciated from the earliest times, that by a generalization all edible young shoots of whatever plants were termed aspar agoi. The alimentary use of asparagus was appreciated by the ancients, so that Pliny refers to it in glowing terms. Ac- cording to him, the cultivation of this plant at Eavenna had been perfected so much that three shoots weighed a pound. The cultivation of the asparagus occupies a remarkable chapter of horticultural science, and has given rise to an extensive literature.

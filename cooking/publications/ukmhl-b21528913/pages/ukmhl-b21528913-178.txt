THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 150 are slices, dice, or chips; dice and chips may be fried just before immersion. When the broth has been poured over the bread, the tureen should be covered and allowed to stand a little for the bread to soak ; it should not be stirred; the broth, therefore, must be salted, coloured, and spiced before being poured over. If the vegetables, which may have been boiled in the broth, be presentable, serve them on a separate plate, but if they be fibrous and unsightly do not send them to table. An excellent addition to such soup is grated Parma cheese; it should not be added to the soup in the tureen, but to each plate separately, to prevent its fusion and adhesiveness. This soup must be carefully distinguished from that kind of bread-soup which in French is termed soiq^e mitonnle* This latter is prepared by adding 60 grm. of broken dry breadcrumb to 12 decilitres (li litre) of prepared broth and simmering, while constantly stirring, for twenty minutes. When the bread is completely disintegrated, and forms a fine paste, the soup is thick, like a puree, and ready for use. This soup is most excellent and nutritious when made with meat-bread. Synoptical Classification of Soups. With the object of obtaining a means of survey and refer- ence for the practical purposes of common life and its relations to the kitchen, we have arranged soups into tC7i divisions or categories. 13y a more stringent application of the principles of classification, a greater number of classes might be obtained, but the increase would probably not make the arrangement of greater practical use. Several of the soups used as illustrations in the first division might be distributed amongst the nine following divisions; but we * Of. Gouffe, lor.ciL, p. 53.

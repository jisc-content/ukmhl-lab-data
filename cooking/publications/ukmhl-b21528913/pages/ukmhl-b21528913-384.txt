THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 356 The salads of celery-stalks, tomatoes, ciicwnbers, gherkins, white and black truffles, require no commentaries after the foregoing generalization. Salads of Cooked Vegetables, sometimes inappropriately called Boiled Salads.—The salad oi Black Truffles, a laBusse, is made with parboiled tubers.

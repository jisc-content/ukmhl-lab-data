The most simple mode of doing this is by- solution and skimming; if this be not sufficient, the fining by white of egg becomes necessary. Preparation of Sugar Ssnrup for Jellies. Sugar syrup, even when made from white sugar, is fre- quently somewhat turbid, not so much from matters con- tained in the sugar as from impurities in the water. Syrups, unless made with distilled water, have, therefore, to be clarified at a boiling heat, either by mere skimming or by means of white of egg; the boiling heat also sterilizes the syrup by destroying bacteria. Preparation of Fruit Juices for Jellies. Fruit juices have to be boiled and skimmed, and ultimately filtered. Filtration may be made through paper or cloth ; it may be preceded by agitation with paper-pulp or sand. These substances collect the gelatinous pectinous particles, which, if not thus fixed, quickly obstruct any filter, and allow no more juice to pass. For filtration through paper, the best material is the strong white Ehenish filtering-paper sold by chemical warehousemen. Sand should be white, and well boiled, washed, and levigated ; it must be shaken with the juice in a stoppered bottle. This process is effectual in treating larger volumes of lemon or orange juice, which contains much gelatinous pectose. Jellies flavoured with Wine. Such jellies can be made with high - flavoured wines, sherry, hock, and others, either by adding them to any of the standard sweet jellies, or by producing a dilution of the wine with water, adding prepared syrup, acidulating with lemon-juice, flavouring with tinctures of spices, heating-^the mixture, and dissolving in it a quantity of glassy gelatine

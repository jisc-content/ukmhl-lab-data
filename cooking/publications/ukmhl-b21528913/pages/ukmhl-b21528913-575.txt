RED AND GREY MULLET, JOHN DORY 547 The red mullet, or sur mullet—French rouget or mulet— a sea-fish characterized by a large head and a red skin, abundant on all Mediterranean coasts, is taken in the English Channel, and particularly at Plymouth. The Eomans valued it greatly, and observed its change of colour when it dies. Some modern enthusiasts termed it the woodcock of the sea, as its trail is eatable when suitably cooked. Its flesh is white, firm, short, agreeable, and digestible, and on the plate separates easily into flakes. In the sea, mullets sometimes travel in shoals underneath shoals of mackerel. For cooking, the fish should be only lightly scraped, or not scraped at all; the gills should then be pulled, when part of the trail will come with them. This is all the eventration that is required. There is a variety of mullet which is reddish-brown, sometimes called the striped mullet. Its flesh is firmer, but nearly as good as that of the perfectly red variety. The mullet prefers a muddy sea-bottom. It is best grilled, and it is not advisable to boil it ever in court bouillon. Anchovy,, or Italian, or espagnole sauce go best with it. It may be filleted, marinaded and fried, filleted and baked, grilled with fine herbs, or grilled in oiled paper. G-ray mullet, graylimj, and whiting pout (the latter, in French, tacaud), should be prepared like red mullet. The John Dory—French Jaune Dove—is excellent when fresh. It is mostly eaten plain-boiled, with lobster or Dutch sauce. It may be stuffed with forcemeat, and braised or baked; the stuffing should be kept fat, and slightly spiced with tinctures and herbs. Baste the fish, and keep it moist by bacon or oiled paper. Probably owing to the curious appearance of the fish, many fables have been connected with it—such as that it was the fish out of the mouth of which Peter took the tribute-money ; or that the marks on its head were impressed by St. Christopher when he caught one in wading through an arm of the sea.

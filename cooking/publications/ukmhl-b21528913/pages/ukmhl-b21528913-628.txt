THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 6oo Soar milk, bonny clobber, German Schliiypcr-milch, is formed when milk is allowed to stand in a cool place; some cream collects on the top, and a membrane of delicate funyi, a so-called mycelium, forms on the surface. The milk then assumes an acidulous taste, sometimes also is a little effer- vescent, and curdles in the same manner, appai’ently, as by rennet; in reality, however, the curdling is caused by lactic acid, developed from the sugar of milk by a living ferment, a lovv' fungus, termed the bacillus (little rod) of sour milk. The curdling by rennet, on the other hand, is effected by a non-organized soluble ferment without the production of any acid. While in the whey produced by rennet an albu- minous substance remains in solution (lacto-gjrotein), and can be precipitated by fermented or sour whey—that is, whey the sugar of milk of which has been transformed into lactic acid; this precipitated lacto-protein is the material from which the Alpine cheese-makers produce the small hard cheeses called herb-cheese (Krauter-kase and Zieger)— in sour milk this lacto-protein falls together with the caseinc, and for this reason curds as well as cheese from sour milk have properties which differ somewhat from those of the curds and cheese produced from sweet milk by rennet. When milk is effervescent as well as acidulous, the yeast plant is present, besides the lactic acid plant, and produces some alcohol and carbonic acid, also from sugar of milk. This double fermentation is produced regularly in mare’s milk, in the Kirghese steppes, and results in the production of koumiss. Sour milk is an agreeable, easily digestible, nutritious preparation ; it should be well stirred before use, and if not very rich receive an addition of cream; its taste is heightened by some sugar and cinnamon 2>ou'der; grated breadcrumb, or dice of bread, may be added to give it body. In countries where the people during summer eat much sour milk for supper with hot potatoes or bread, variation is produced by

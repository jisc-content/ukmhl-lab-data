387 PORRIDGE, GRUEL AND SKILLY that he should have opportunity to sei’ve this dish ; the claim, was granted, and the Archbishop presented the dish, Be la GroaU, to the King. The plums in this porridge were probably, as in plum-pudding, raisins and currants. There figure in cookery-books recipes for Savoury Porridge, so called because of an addition of onions. According to our terminology, porridge can be savoury only if made with broth or standard solution of Proust’s extract of meat, or with cheese or mushrooms. Such porridge would be a transition to sou])s containing cereals, and we suppose that these latter will be the forms in which porridge will be known to future generations. Thin Porridge, or Gruel, is made with water or milk; it requires boiling, and, if knotty, skimming and straining. Oatmeal and maizemeal should be steeped in water for several hours before being boiled, and afterwards should stew in a warm place or water-bath for several hours, to become perfectly smooth and soluble. The Yorkshire milk and oatmeal does not agree well with all persons on the first trial, and should be taken in moderate quantities. Grnel may be bound or thickened with a liaison of two yolks of eggs to the pint, and then should not be heated to boiling. In some of the casual wards of the London workhouses the gruel given as nutriment to able-bodied paupers passes under the name of skilly, a word perhaps derived from the name of a vessel used in cooking, called skillet (perhaps from Old French esctiellette, diminutive of escuelle, Fr. dcuelle, from Lat. scutella, diminutive of scutra, a dish or plate, the word from which scullei'y {dishery) also is derived. Hence a scullion is a dish-washer.

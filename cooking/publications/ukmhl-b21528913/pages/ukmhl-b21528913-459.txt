431 PRESERVATION OF BEEF the kidney, sncl, which is indispensable for many most important culinary operations. In America as well as Europe much beef - fat is transformed into a material closely resembling butter, and mainly sold under the name of oleo-viargarine. Some Transatlantic traders have lately invented the name of marroto for their tinned oleo- margarine. In South America some beef is preserved by drying, forming yarkee, corrupted into jerked beef; great quantities of beef are preserved by salting, called junk; and by tinning, i.e., enclosing in tin boxes, and sterili^iing by heat. Ox-kidney is not as hard as the liver, and not so unsuited for culinary preparation; but even when well done it requires a good mastication and a strong digestion; for, as it has a strong flavour, it requires a well-seasoned and browned espagnole sauce for its adaptation, and these concomitants are not within the range of toleration of delicate stomachs. The salting or pickling' of beef and the means by lohich it is effected involve important considerations. Beef is salted not only for preservation until it be wanted, but to im- prove or adapt its taste, and make it more tender. It may be rubbed with a mixture of salt, or a little saltpetre, or nitrate of potash, the latter to insure its having a little red colour. Cavities produced by the removal of bones or glands, called kernels, should also be rubbed and have some salt left in them, and be tied up again so as to keep the sides together. The mixture of salts dissolved in water may also be injected by means of a syringe with a pointed piercing nozzle; but this causes the meat to be unequal in quality. The quantity of saltpetre or nitre to be used with the salt should be about 4 per cent, of the latter, or, in round numbers, 4 oz. to 6 lb. The saltpetre is not essential to preservation, but has reference only to the fixation of some of the red colour of the meat; those who

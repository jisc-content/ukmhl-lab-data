THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 104 Spiced Salt. Spiced salt* is made by mixing 1 oz. of spiced p>epper with 4 oz. of salt. Before pepper was confined to special boxes or caraffines of the cruet-stand, it was generally served in this form, and stood on the table in a salt-cellar, as does now our pure salt. CHAPTER VI. BOUILLON, OR MEAT-BROTH; ITS DEVELOPMENT AND ROLE IN THE HISTORY OF COOKERY. Historical Introduction. ‘ The sapid principle of meat may be described without exaggeration as the quintessence of the art of cookery.’—Louis Proust. ‘ French cookery owes its superiority over that of other nations only to (the excellence of French) bouillon.’—Alexandre Dumas. Whatever influence the Italians of the Renaissance may have exercised upon French cookery, to the French must be allowed the merit of having made bouillon, or broth, the foundation of the taste of all moist savoury preparations, and of having thereby made a great number of dishes more wholesome as well as more tasty than they were before this development. Amongst the ancient as well as the later Italians, the broth of meat remained almost unused, for even ‘ the capon-broth with flour-paste ’ (macaroni) men- tioned by early Italian novelists was used only on a very limited area, and had certainly no general application.! Greeks and Romans possessed large quantities of more or less fine olive-oil, and used this generally for penetrating * ‘ Spiced salt,’ mentioned by Gouffe, and after him Wyvern. f Of.

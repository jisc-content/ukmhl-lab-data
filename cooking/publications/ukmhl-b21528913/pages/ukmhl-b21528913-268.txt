240 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY Bechamel Sauce. This sauce consists of a basis of veloutd with an admix- ture of cream. According to earlier writers, the sauce h la Bdchamcl derived its name from a Marquis de. Bechamel, who, they think, was thereby immortalized. According to others, however. Bechamel was the name of an inventive cook. Take of finished veloutd sauce the quantity required, and add thereto an equal volume of boiling cream. Allow the mixture to boil for a few minutes while stirring it inces- santly, then pass through a tammy into a special saucepan, and place this into a water-bath to be ready for use when called for. Many recipes prescribe a further concentration of the finished velout6 sauce previous to the additions of the cream. This indicates the weakness of the broth generally employed in the preparation of the stock sauce. When normal broth is employed these frequent concentrations become quite unnecessary.

And this we find actually to be the case. Cookery-books swarm with errors engendered by the absence of scientific training, and this deficiency is manifest not only in the reciting of prescriptions, but extends in some cases down to the very pots and pans in daily use in every good kitchen; thus an otherwise excellent writer actually does not know the definition of a water-bath, or, as the French term it, a bain-marie, and persistently signalizes with that name the saucepans intended to stand in the bain-marie, whether they be in or out of water.

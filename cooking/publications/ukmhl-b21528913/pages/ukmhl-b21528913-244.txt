Polish BagoM or Soup (Barszcze).—This is an expanded ragout of many ingredients, coloured with fermented and fresh juice of red beetroot. There is no collateral consomme or broth added, but the compound depends for savour on such as its ingredients yield by five hours’ boiling. Some term the dish Borsch, an abbreviation of the word in the title, or Polish Soiqj, and place it amongst the national soups. It is doubtful whether this name is not connected with Pbrsch, the East German name of Savoy cabbage, and of a ragout made therewith. The ingredients are various descriptions of meat and vegetables, much in the style of the olla; then a red glace and a julienne, of which red beet- root is the prevailing ingredient, quenelles of fillet of beef, farcied eggs. When all are done separately, the meat is carved free from bone, and cut in dice, put into the soup- tureen, the quenelles and eggs are added, and the bouillon, carefully prepared and spiced, is put over all. The red beetroot juice is made by grating a number of beetroots, and fermenting the pulp with yeast in a protected vessel. Some add also directly expressed juice, as well as beetroot in substance, to the dish, which in consequence has a deep- red colour.* Bussian Soup {Ouka).—This is a gravy soup of veal, fowl, etc., with souchets of salmon, eel, perch, and mullet, quenelles of whiting, lobster coral, aud mushroom pur6e. It has some analogy to bouillabaisse. Bussian Cabbage Soup [Tschi) is a broth soup, with onions, cabbage, aud quenelles.

METHODIZING OF CAMP COOKERY 657 side, half the ox, was eaten. Two mincing-machines had been employed. Indeed, the mincing-machine is eminently useful in the field. All meat which it is difficult to prepare, or which takes much time for its preparation—e.y., the neck, or the parts cut off the head (cheeks)—when thus minced can be cooked in a few minutes. If a soldier finds that his meat has become too tough during roasting, or that it has not become tender during boiling, let him pass it through the mincing-machine, form it into rissoles, fry them, and in ten minutes he will have digestible, tasty meat. This mincing is also useful during bad weather, when fires will not burn, or when there is but little wood or a scarcity of water. On days of rest the mincing-machine may be used to transform meat into sausages, which may be kept ready against days on which cooking is difficult. During the siege of Paris the Germans had, on account of the rinderpest, no beef, but only mutton and pease-sausages, so-called Erbsiourst. They cooked the mutton in various ways, and ate it boiled, grilled, as cho2:)s and cdtelettcs, roast on Ike spit^ as Jclpubabs grilled and steioed, and as mince ; they thus had^aily variety for each week, and were fed admirably. It follows from all this that the cooking of the soldiers should be studied, organized, and, so to say, methodized, and secured by technical instruction and compulsory pre- scription ; above all, it should be purified of fundamental errors such as the following : IHoth and soxtp in camp cookery have their uses. But military writers on cookery still maintain, though without discussion, the fallacy of the usefulness of bones in the pro- duction of broth for soup. They say that brolh is to be prepared from the hones and all other materials which are pared off the meat in its preparation for cooking. Such a process must of course yield a very variable broth, whi9h, 42

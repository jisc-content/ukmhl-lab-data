THE SPIRIT OP COOKERY 350 not from white. It can also be extracted from oil of garlic and from oil of asafoctida. A hundred parts of crushed mus- tard-seeds yield from 0-2 to 1‘2 parts of oil. The oil is colourless, boils at 148 C.°, has a sharp and penetrating taste and odour, excites tears, and inflames and blisters the skin. Horseradish, Cochlearia armoracea, owes its pungent taste and flavour to the presence of a sulphurized oil related to oil of mustard, but contains only small quantities of it, 2,000 parts of root yielding by distillation with water 1 part of oil. One drop of this oil fills a large room with the odour of horseradish. Cresses and radishes contain and yield oils related to the foregoing, but they are peculiar in subordinate features. The volatile oils obtained by distillation with water from many parts of cruciferous plants, seeds, flowers, leaves, and stalks, are probably mostly mixtures of several oils. All the cabbage tribe yield such oils, some undoubtedly garlic oil, others oils of peculiar character. All are sulphurized, and this explains in a measure the loudly-announced phenomena of their decomposition. The use of bulbs and herbage containing sulphurized oil has been much restricted in cookery during this century. Eagouts and purees of onions are now made with materials previously toned down by parboiling in water. The fine Spanish and Portuguese onions also are parboiled before being immersed in espagnole sauce. But the pur6e of garlic which was a celebrated dish at the Trois Fr^res Proven9eaux at Paris in the first half of this century, prepared with cod- fish, and passing as Morue d la Puree d’Ail, has disappeared. Some surmise that it owed its reputation to the mild nature of the ProvenQal garlic, and that had it been made with northern garlic it could not have been eaten.

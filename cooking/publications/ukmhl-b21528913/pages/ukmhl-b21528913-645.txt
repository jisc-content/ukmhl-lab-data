617 CUPS; SPIRITS TFflssatZ Boiol is an ancient Christmas Eve regalement, and consists of hot ale with several spices poured over roast apples. AU Cup, Beer Gup, or Cool Tankard, is a mixture of ale with spices and sugar, fortified by braudy and sherry, and flavoured with capillaire and lemon; to be cooled in water or ice.

Fermented cherries yield an excel- lent distilled spirit. Much of this is made in Alsatia, and termed cherry-water, German Kirschenwasser, or by a French abbreviation kirsch.

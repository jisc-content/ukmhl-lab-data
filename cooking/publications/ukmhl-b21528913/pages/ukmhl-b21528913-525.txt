VARIETIES AND PREPARATIONS OF PIGEON 497 well done ; wild ducks are preferred only just, or rather under, done. TBoth are very suitable for treatment as a ragout with cassareep in the form of the West Indian pepper-pot. Of ingeons, French cooks distinguish four varieties as most suitable for cooking: Bomains (large birds), Cochois (from Picardie), Birets (in i\.ugust), and a la Gaultier (from Paris and neighbourhood).

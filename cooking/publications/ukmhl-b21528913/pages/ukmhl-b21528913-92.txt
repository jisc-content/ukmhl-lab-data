64 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY CHAPTER IV. GENERAL CONSIDERATION OF CULINARY PRO- CESSES. Boiling, Baking, Roasting, Frying, Grilling. Boiling is the application of heat to natural products or compounds intended to he eaten hy means of direct contact with water heated to the degree of ebullition, and kept at or near that degree until the food he cooked. In the con- sideration of this process two influences have to he separately valued, namely, that of the heat merely, such as can he applied and studied in the processes of roasting and baking, and that of the hot water as a chemical agent and solvent. When the latter influence prevails, it generally effects such a transformation that the process of boiling becomes one of extraction or of solution. This prevalence has, therefore, to be avoided, for the best boiling is that which causes to the matter to he boiled the least loss of its useful and nutritive constituents. Now, as all boiling causes such a loss, that mode of boiling which causes the least loss is the best. From this it follows that, as the loss is in a direct proportion to the solvent employed, all boiling should be effected in a minimum of water. In practice, tioo degrees of boiling are distinguished, one called boiling absolutely, and another lower one called simmering. In both cases the water is, at the average pressure of the air at the sea-level, at the temperature of 100° Centigrade or 212° Fahrenheit. But in the water boiling violently heat is conveyed much quicker than in the water which merely simmers. Now, as many materials which have to be cooked are bulky, and bad con- ductors of heat, they should, in order to become equably cooked, not be exposed to the influence of water in strong

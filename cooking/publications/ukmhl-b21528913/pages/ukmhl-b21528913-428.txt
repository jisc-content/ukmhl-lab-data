400 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY and then to be drenched with a thick orange syrup mixed with cura9oa. Even this treatment is plagiarized from the baba, and thus cake and sauce must be pronounced spurious intruders. The oldest form of spelling of the name of the cake is rcttan, and as such it occurs in De Varenne ; the deviations are very slight, namely, raclan and radon. It may be j)re- pared with either one dough or two doughs, a fermented one and a butter-and-egg stirred dough, both to be mixed before transfer to the baking mould. German culinary authors give many variations for the preparation of this favourite cake, all of which are of no essential importance; they can all be ranged under the two typical processes which we have given above. The variations are practised mainly with regard to the additions, namely, currants, stoned raisins, pounded almonds, cinnamon, and candied peel. To our taste, the finest ratan cake is that of two doughs without any additions whatsoever; in that state it is equal to the pure brioche, and, by the more equal distribu- tion of the pores, mechanically superior to it; for the brioche is partly flaky and rises in layers, while the ratan is not so, and rises like sponge-cake in minute uniform bubbles. With the increase of the number and quantity of fruity and spicy ingredients, the ratan loses its original character, and may be changed beyond recognition; but then it should also receive the names by which such derivates ought to be designated. Common cookery-books contain detailed recipes for many such variations, which uselessly increase the number of apparent recipes, teach nothing to the cook or general reader, and confuse more than enlighten a person who would study the theory of ratau cake with a view of having one now and then baked in his kitchen.

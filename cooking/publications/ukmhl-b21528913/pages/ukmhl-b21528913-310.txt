THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 282 since prehistoric times, been the principal culinary fat, as well as fat-food; it was burned in their lamps, and illumi- nated the shrines of their saints, as it does those of the saints of the Eussians of the present day. The northern nations have a prejudice against the use of olive-oil in cooking, which is mainly due to the fact that it was some- times of bad quality, owing to the long transport or original faults in the making. Such faults—e.g., in Bourbon Naples —were engendered by oppressive fiscal imposts, which the cultivators had to pay before they were allowed to pulp and press their olives. The oil which runs spontaneously from the pulp of the olives, called virgin oil, is the best and least coloured, and is ready for immediate use. The oil which is obtained by the press is more or less turbid and slightly coloured, and has to be stored for some time to deposit its impurities and become clear. Olive-oil differs much in appearance and quality, according to its chemical composition. Some is colourless like water, and very liquid,' consisting of almost pure olein ; other qualities are yellowish, greenish to green from chlorophyll, and more or less thick—that is to say, less mobile and liquid than the previously described qualities. All these may be of excellent taste; they can be made more liquid by exposure to cold and removal of the crystallized fat. The use of oil requires the taking of some precautions; every new portion of oil to be used should be heated for at least half an hour on a moderate fire, to avoid the rising of the oil and the loss of the fritter by ejection. This pheno- menon is perhaps due to the sudden evolution of water from one of the constituents at high temperatures. The evolutiou of this gas is promoted by agitating the hot oil—a.g., by dashing in a fine spray of water, which bursts explosively, and is called ‘ screaming the oil ’—f.c., making it scream. It causes loss of oil, and the scattered

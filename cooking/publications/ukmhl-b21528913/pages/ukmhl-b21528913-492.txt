464 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY cutlets grilled, with d’Uxelles mince and d’Uxelles sauce. After having used it for his description of his form of cutlets a la Maintenon, the same author declares that the name of d’Uxelles was ambitious, and at the same time little intelli- gible ; he therefore proposes to substitute for it a rational definition of the preparation, namely, ‘ fine herbs for garnishes and sauces,’ meaning mushrooms, parsley, shallots, pepper and salt, all fried in butter. All this confusion of names is a modern product, and arises from the disregard of modern writers for the well-established names of typical dishes, and their want of acquaintance with the historical magiric literature of their country. Cutlets, whether of veal, pork, or mutton, grilled an natural, or egged and crumbed, over a charcoal fire, were formerly called carhonades ; but during the last thirty years the word has been much supplanted by cutlet, or cdtelette, and is heard rarely except in ancient establishments and places removed from the crushing influence of the levelling Juggenath. Quite a new application of the word carbonade was made by some authors, who under this term gave recipes for the preparation of boned loins by genuine brais- ing. This involves a twofold mistake : firstly, a piece of meat to be grilled must be in the shape of relatively thin slices, and therefore a joint in its integrity cannot be called grilled or carbonated ; secondly, as these joints are directed to be braised, they are not carbonados, and the title of braised carbonades is at least an iteration or tautology. Gou£f6 seems to restrict the name carbonade to braised fillets of mutton, or boned chine, of which he specializes five variations, differing by vegetable garnishes only.

Flatten them with the bat, and broil them over or before a clear fire; spice them after they are done, and place them on a

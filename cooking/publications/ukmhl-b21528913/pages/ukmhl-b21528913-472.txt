444 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY likely to molest the gastric function. An authoress who terms them ‘ heef-palates ’ attributes to them the quality of Javourita entries. Like turtle, calf’s head, pied de benuf, or beche de mer, they are tasteless in themselves, and depend for their development upon the sauce and garnish. As to their attractiveness when well prepared, we agree with ‘ Dons de Comus.’ The Philosophy of Beefsteak or Btmipsteak forms a power- ful contrast to the trifles of the foregoing paragraph. Beau- villiers* speaks of ‘ le veritable bifteck, comme il se fait en Angleterre,’ and of the other variety, which he says is called ‘ Eomesteak,’ and assures the ‘amateurs de bonne chere’ that it would be worth their while to cross the Channel to taste this favourite English dish, which, when ‘ mortifie a son point,’ and well dressed, according to him, is superior to most of the subtle double relishes of the Parisian kitchen. Beef and rump steak are intimately associated with the history of the training of pugilists. The celebrated trainer Sir Thomas Parkyns,f Bart., of Bunny Park, greatly pre- ferred beef-eaters to sheep-biters, as he called those who ate mutton. On the other hand, when Humphries, the pugilist, was trained by Eipsham, the keeper of Ipswich Gaol, he was at first fed upon beef, but got so much flesh that the beef was changed for mutton, roasted or boiled. To this Kitchiner observes, apparently as an explanation of this story, that by boiling a great part of the nutritive juices of the meat was extracted. This relative loss by boiling or roasting has never been accurately estimated, and is probably not very great. The season for steaks used to be from September 29 to March 25, but since the introduction of processes of refrigeration, tolerable steak is obtained even during the summer months. * ‘ Art du Cuisinier,’ t. i., p. 122. f In his book ‘ On Wrestling,’ 4to., 3id edit., 1727, p. 10.

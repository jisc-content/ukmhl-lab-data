297 A\-IGOl/y'S OF MUS/7A’00J}/S CHAPTER XXIII. RAGOUTS OF VEGETABLES, AND COMPOUND RAGOUTS OF VEGETABLES AND MEAT. RagoOts of vegetables, or stewed vegetables for garnisbiug braised and boiled meat dishes, are mainly characterized by cryptogams—fungi or mushrooms. The common mushroom, Agaricus campestris, L., is usually eaten at two stages of its growth, one when it has just risen from the mycelium, and is small, with its hymen still closed, called button, and the other when it is just expanded, its hymen forming a ring round the stalk, and the spore-bearing ridges forming a rosy lining to the expanded umbrella. To be valuable they must he plump at both these stages ; the spores may just have turned black, but, on the whole, such mushrooms are over- ripe. Flabby, leathery, expanded, fissured, black-lined mushrooms are to be avoided. Of all animal and vegetable matters, only three possess the ijrincii)le of scqnclity in the highest culinary and gusta- tory sense, namely, meat, cheese, and mushrooms. This principle is an alkaloid, or a series of alkaloids, which is practically designated as osmazome. It is most developed when it is somewhat overheated, or browned; hence, mush- rooms are most sapid when fried in fat, and darkened by that process, as well as by the distribution of spores, which also become dark or black by heat. In France and Germany the agaricus passes under the name of champignon, hut in England it is called mushroom. This is a special application of the French name mousseron, of which more below. The agaricus contains above 91 per cent, of water, 2^- per cent, of nitrogenized substance, 1 per mille fat, nearly 1 per cent, of mannite and grape-sugar; soluble matter free from nitrogen above 3'7 percent., woody

THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 190 Soup Sauces. Many of the soups, particularly fish soups, described in culinary treatises, are in fact much less soups than some- what elongated ragouts. The more solid ingredients of such soups are the same as, and undergo preparatory pro- cesses similar to, the solid constituents of ragouts. It is owing to the recognition of this fact by practical cooks that they have termed the liquid part of these complicated dishes sou'p sauces.^ We simply adopt this term as we find it, because we believe it to be highly descriptive. When our readers come to study sauces, they will see that the differences between them and soups are mainly differences of concentration. A soup sauce is, shortly defined, a coulis. A Becipe for a Savoury Soup Sauce, e.g., of Eel Fillets, is the following : Cut up small carrots, celery, parsley, roots and leaves, shallots, and a liberal number of mushrooms; add thyme, bay-leaf, sweet basil, peppercorns, and mace. Fry them in 4 oz. of butter, then add a little wine and three pints of standard broth of any origin, and boil for an hour. Then strain the broth through a tammy, using any avail- able pressure to the residue; put the liquid into a stewpan, thicken it with white roux, and give it an appropriate con- sistency, so as to keep it more mobile than sauce ought to be. Finish it with a liaison of yolks of eggs, and point with tinctures of spices and chopped parsley. Then pour this soup sauce over the fried, boiled, or braised fillets of eel, or any available crayfish, or prawn-tails, in the soup- tureen, and stir gently. Out of a great number of so-called fish soups* we indicate a selection, partly with definitions ; Jack or Pike Soup, a soup sauce over fillets of jack ; some add puree of almonds and cream panada. * A series of recipes for fish soups is collected in D.D., 874 e( seq. (pike, eel, sole, flounder, sturgeon), mostly ex ‘ liecipes de la Maison de Madame,’ an old classic French work.

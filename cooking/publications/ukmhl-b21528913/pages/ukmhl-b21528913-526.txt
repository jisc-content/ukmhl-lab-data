THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 498 quires about an hour aud a half’s cooking in a moderately- heated oveu, aud the addition of strong gravy both before and after it is cooked. The cook indicates the presence of pigeon in the pie by fixing some claws of the bird on the outside of the crust. Pigeons may be braised, with qii,en- elles or a ragoiU; they may be boned, stuffed, crumbed, or fried ; braised in a wine mirepoix, and garnished with a Spanish ragout {ci la Seville). More complicated ijrepara- tions are Pigeons au Gratin, in capsules, a dish which is in reality a forcemeat pudding. Breasts or Fillets of Pigeon admit of the same forms of treatment as the fillet of fowls, but are more laborious to produce. The mode of dressmg pigeons for stews, fricassee, braises, etc., in the most expeditious manner, should be studied in ‘ Dons de Comus’(t. ii., p. 196). Throw the pigeons just killed into warm water, beat the stomach and remove the crop; now put them in hot water on the fire, and stir them until the feathers begin to come off; take them out and cool them at once; remove the trail, causing the feet to enter the abdomen, aud truss them with skewers. Give them shape, blanch in boiling water, and put in cool water. For roasts the pigeons are not treated with hot water, but plucked and singed in the ordinary manner (‘ Dons de Comus,’ t. ii., p. 351). CHAPTEE XLVI.

The pheasant was brought by the Argonauts from the banks of the river Phasis, from which its name is derived.

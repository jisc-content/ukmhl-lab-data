DETERIORATION OF CULINARY ART 637 for a salaried appointment, ‘ Accord^ !’ We have seen an account of an interview which the King’s official taster of peaches, M. Petit Eadel, had with a peasant grower. From the history of the King’s fruit jury, of which this peach- taster was a member, may be judged the nature of the reign, which afflicted France, effected the felonious invasion of Spain, and caused even Chateaubriand to be disgusted at Cabinet councils, which sat mainly for the purpose of listen- ing to the King’s small jokes. During the fifteen years of the elder Bourbon rule, culinary science in France made no progress, notwithstanding the effort which was manifested by the publication of the second series of the ‘ Almanach des Gourmands.’ The July scrimmage of 1830 brought new life to France, and with it gastronomy assumed new forms, of which the reader can learn the details in D.D., p. 65. The Orleanist Government is described as one ‘ qui probable- ment avait de la sympathie pour les viveurs,’ for ‘ it ruled by truffles.’ The sympathies of Louis Philippe were enlisted for soups, which we know from the ‘ Almanach ’ were rapidly deteriorating ; he sometimes ate four plates full of different soups, and a fifth in which he had the others all mixed up. Perhaps if the soups had been better, he would have eaten a smaller volume, and ‘ Mr. Smith with his old woman ’ might never have crossed the Channel. The downfall of culinary art is characterized by the story of the man who engaged to eat a dinner of the value of 500 francs, and in this country by Soyer’s one hundred guinea dish produced for a banquet at York. Dumas be- lieved that he had assisted at ‘ the last supper of genius,’ and in a climax of vanity exclaimed, ‘ On mangera toujours, mais on he din era plus, et surtout on ne soupera plus.’ Notwithstanding, both dinners and suppers have survived, but people talk less transcendentalism about them.

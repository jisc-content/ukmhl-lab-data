THE SPIRIT OF COOKER) 296 such as quails, snipes, larks, plovers, and dottrel, are obtainable, their fillets form good material for quenelles. Several varieties of farce deserve the special attention of connoisseurs, such as that of liver and ham for raised pies. In ordinary culinary works the selection of a light-coloured calf’s liver is prescribed. But no healthy liver is naturally light-coloured, and those which appear to be so in trade are made pale by the butchers, by immersion in water. How- ever, this process affects only a thin outer layer of the liver tissue; to effectually blanch a liver, i.e., to wash out the blood contained in it, it is necessary to tie it to a water-tap inserted into the opening of the portal vein, and let the water run through it for some time. This treatment also removes the last traces of bitterness. If this be not feasible, the liver may be sliced and laid in water, or may be scraped, and the pulp washed in a cloth. But the process is un- necessary, except where the colour of the quenelles is to be pale and not dark. Gratins require a farce with much fat, and are, therefore, best made with livers of geese, or with scraped calf’s liver mixed with much bacon fat. Godiveau is a kind of farce used for garnishing the interior of hotp>dtes, vol-au-vents, aadtourtes d la ciboulette ; it may be made of veal, with beef-suet, parsley, and spices ; or of flesh of foivl, or of game with truffles, or of mushrooms, or of fish, turbot, eel, carp, all with panada. Godiveaus are generally preferred to be made with a particular binding material, called crane pdtissitre, which is analogous to the cooked batter above alluded to; it consists of eggs, flour and milk, is heated to boiling, cooled in water, and then mixed with the minced meat. In Baton’s Dictionary it is stated that at many tables, where everything else is well done, it is common to find very bad stuffing. This is as true now as it was in 1822.

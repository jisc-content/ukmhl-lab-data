189 FISH AND VEGETABLE BROTHS fare for fast-days, except as regards the soup, for nearly all soups beconae inattractive by the absence of savour in the shape of broth. This circumstance has, no doubt, con- tributed much to the deterioration of soups in general, and their gradual abandonment by the healthy part of the population. Cooks, however, placed opposite an economical demand, have endeavoured to supply suhstikites for meat- broth in the shape of the following decoctions. Fish-Broth. Very few fish give an edible broth; the decoctions of most of them are not agreeable to an educated taste, and all of them are of no nutritive value; even the best fish- broth must be kept very weak, as when strong it is equally unacceptable. As good fish has to furnish the more sub- stantial dishes, we have never known it used for the pro- duction of fish-broth ; conger eel, which is not very good or not very easy to eat, on account of its many prickly bones, is used for the production of fish-broth in Bretagne. Most fish used for soup is filleted and made into puree, and only the skeletons and heads are boiled with herbs and water. Thus a flavoured liquid, but without much savoury ex- tractive, is obtained. English cooks use flounders, eels, and anchovies for making fish broth. V egetable - Broth. A kind of vegetable-broth is made from peas {bouillon de 2)ois) and haricot beans by diluting purees and retaining the woody particles on the tammy. We have already seen ; how the vegetarians miscall this decoction ‘ stock,’ and deceive themselves and inexperienced credulous persons with this fallaqy; we have known the growth of young children stunted by the application to them of this lament- I able fad by their faddist mother.

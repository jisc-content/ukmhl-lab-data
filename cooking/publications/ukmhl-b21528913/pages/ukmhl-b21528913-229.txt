201 CURRY OR KARI SOUP the broth is sufficiently impregnated with the spices. The pepperiness may be imparted with a few drops of tabasco as a finishing touch, or of chilli vinegar if tabasco be unobtainable. Kari or Ctirry-Poivder for flavouring Mulligatunny*— Such powders can be bought ready-made, but can also be compounded as follows: Take 4 oz. of pimento, 3 oz. of curcuma {terra merita, i.e., turmeric), | oz. of black pepper, a nutmeg, and a scruple of ginger; powder all very fine, and mix carefully. This powder may be added to any ragout, composed of mushrooms, artichoke bottoms, sliced truffles, quenelles, sliced hard yolks of eggs, slices of sweet- I bread, cock’s-combs, brains and sweetbread of lambs, and other ingredients, such as fish and meat. Another more compound list of spices for flavouring mulligatunny is the following: 2 oz. of coriander-seed, 1 oz. of cummilv-seed, 1 oz. of femigreek or meethee, ^ oz. of nmstard-seed, two cloves of garlic, a dozen black g^eppercorns, and four leaves of ktirreeapliol, or kodia-neem {karay-pauk). Put all into a muslin bag, without pounding or braising, boil with the soup, and remove as soon as the flavour is satisfactory. .

Thus the difficulty of making turbid what should be a clear soup is •i avoided; the amount of spiciness to be imparted to the ! soup is entirely in the hands of the cook. In the prepara- tion of the broth use turnips sparingly, leeks freely ; also a few sprigs of thyme or marjoram.

502 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY protect them during roasting by oiled paper. In our view, such a roast is as disagreeable a sight as the roast hare crouching, and with its head and ears standing up. The roasting of a pheasant in slices of bacon and oiled paper takes about half an hour; it should be frothed or browned with flour, salt and butter just before being sent to table. Our medical friend Ignotus directs a pheasant cock to be stuffed with the lean part of a sirloin of beef cut in pieces of the size of dice, and spiced with pepper and salt. During roasting, the gravy of the beef diffuses itself through the flesh of the pheasant, thereby rendering it more juicy, tasty, and tender. Veal, being a white meat, may be preferred by some, but requires more flavoured additions. The recipe also says that early in the present century the pheasant was generally larded, but that many persons objected to the. taste of bacon which it acquired by exposure to dry culinary heat. For braising, a pheasant should be well larded, stuffed, garnished, and immersed in standard gravy, and when done be served with a ragout of fat livers, sweetbread, mushrooms, truffles, etc. Pheasant is very suitable for game ines and pasties, and in that form was by cooks of the last century placed into oval potting-pots, cooked to the point, and covered hot with a thick layer of fat aromatized by braising. In this state the pie was kept for months, and preserved as well as tinned meat is nowadays, but, of course, not suitable for transport. The most suitable fat for such preservation is that from a boiled ham which is in course of being cut. The accomplished cook Simpson, founder of the celebrated restaurant in the Strand, gives (in his work on cookery of 1716) only two recipes for pheasant, while in current modern English works we find more than twenty. But on investigation, the latter are seen to be mostly mere varia-

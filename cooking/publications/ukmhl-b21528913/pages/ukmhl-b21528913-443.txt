In ancient Rome such cakes were sometimes made of large size, as they are made in Germany in the present day, aud termed Matte- Kuchen, matte meaning curds. Of variations the best known are ornamented cheese cakes, or Coventry tartlets, but we fear that these imitations of the exterior of fanchoncttes will never be equal to the simple grace of the plain cheese cake.

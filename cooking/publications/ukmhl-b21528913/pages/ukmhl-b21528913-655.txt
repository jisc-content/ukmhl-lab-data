MEALS OF THE ANCIENTS 627 CHAPTEE LVIII. NOTES ON THE COOKERY AND MEALS OF FORMER GENERATIONS. In very ancient times people sat down to dinner at tables as they do in the present day. Thus, the Egyptians did, according to Apollodorus in ‘ Athenseus,’ sit down at table to eat. At Eome they sat down until the end of the second Punic war (202 b.c.). The lying doion on couches for the purpose of eating a dinner was an invention of the Greeks. It WB-s properly termed an uncomfortable luxury, and was probably confined to the upper classes, for it required much service. At a feast which Ortagenes, the Theban, gave to fifty of his friends, and to which he invited the Persian general Mardonius and his suite, numbering also fifty persons, a few days before the battle of Platjeae (479 B.c.), the company, assembled in a large hall, reclined on fifty couches, each of which was occupied by a Greek and a Persian. We are not aware of the exact time at which society was released from the practice of lying down in order to take a meal. The release was delayed mainly by the fact that the conversation amongst the cultivated guests became highly attractive, general, and oratorical, and on account of the csi)rit displayed in it was called Attic salt. Thus, it came to be believed that posture had^some mysterious connection with the conversational result of the dinner, and therefore was abandoned only reluctantly. According to Varro, the Eomans preferred to dine in company numbering not less than the number of the Graces, namely three, and not more tlian the number of the Muses, namely nine. Amongst the Greeks the number seven was that to which they desired to raise or limit their^compaiiy.

rilE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 246 number of the most important—that is, best known and most used, sauces—but abstain from the introduction of details, which would involve needless repetition. Finished Brown Sauces derived from Espagnole. Esj^agnole flavoured with Truffles, or Sauce a la Financihre. —This sauce contains only extract of truffles ; while when it contains chopped truffles in substance it is termed Pdrigueux sauce. Sauce for Calf's Head, or Sauce en Tortus.—The latter name is a mere reminiscence from mock turtle, or tete de veau en tortue; otherwise there is nothing of turtle about it. Satccefor Salmis is espagnole flavoured with such extract as can he obtained by braising the trimmings of the roasted birds, woodcocks or snipes, from which the salmis have been cut. Sauce for Salmis h VAncienne is hke the previous one, , with some wine and parsley added, therefore not specifically different. Italian Sauce, Sauce Italienne Bousse, is espagnole varied and flavoured hy shallots, mushrooms, and olive-oil; the latter probably suggested the name. Fines Herhes Sauce is espagnole flavoured with mush- rooms, shallots, and parsley. Piqiiante Sauce is espagnole specialized by pickles and flavoured with shallots. Gherkin Sauce is like the preceding sauce, but with pre- vailing sliced gherkins. Tomato or Love-aqople Sauce. The adjective ‘ brown ’ is here a little inappropriate, as the colour is covered by the red of the tomatoes. This sauce should he as thick almost as a pur4e. Lyons Sauce is espagnole with flaked onions fried in oil. Proven^ale Sauce is espagnole flavoured with oil and garlic.

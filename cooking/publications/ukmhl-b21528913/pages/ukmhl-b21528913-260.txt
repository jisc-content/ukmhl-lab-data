THE SPIRIT OF COOKER! 232 contain three sliced lemons less rind and pips, while our own recipes warn cooks not to put any lemon-juice into general sauces. The word mirepoix (fern.) occurs in D.D. as saiice a la mirepoix, hut is not to be found in any ordinary French dictionary. It is probably a name proper; Gouffe defines it as an essence of several kinds of meat and vegetables, veal and ham two parts each, fat bacon one part, carrots, onions, and herbs, two bottles of madeira, and five litres of strong bouillon, salt, and spice. These, then, are the elements for the production of a coulis, but the volume of wine reminds of the court bouillon. Braises (or braizes), in French braisis, are understood nowadays to be the substance of meat or game which is roasted under certain special conditions, with the aid of materials specially prepared and mixed, which also bear the name of braises. A braisiere is a vessel of metal (braising-pan) in which this process is carried out; it must be provided with a cover so close fitting that steam cannot escape under a little pressure, and the cover must have a raised rampart so as to be able to receive a quantity of braise, or live charcoal. In such a receptacle the meat to be roasted is, therefore, under conditions different from those which prevail on the grill or the spit. It is in an atmosphere of steam, and thereby prevented from drying or much concentrating its juices; and it is at the same time subjected to radiating heat from above, which acts, though milder, like that coming from a fire. Braising thus yields a more succulent product, supposing the object of the pro- cess to be of limited succulency, and more sauce than the roasting process; but the sauce, or its materials, must be added in a prepared state. A piece of meat to be braised may be placed with a mirepoix and basted with it, or it may be associated with a separate set of braising materials, which will not differ ip

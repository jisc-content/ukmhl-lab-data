THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 448 CHAPTEK XXXVII. PREPAEATIONS OF VEAL. Veal is the great historical object of the cookery of the French, which can be understood thereby; it is not so in England, where calves are killed much later, i.e., at a more advanced age than on the Continent, and the use of beef prevails greatly over that of veal. There was in existence in France a law according to which calves were not to be killed under the age of six weeks; but this law was little observed, and where it was, calves were not allowed to outlive the span of allotted time. The recipes for French preparations of veal are, of course, adapted to the size of the joints, and such recipes translated into English without adaptation would refer to objects of such large proportions that their treatment would become, if not impossible, at least very difficult. It follows that the anatomical division of the calf, as effected by the butcher in England, differs considerably from that usual on the Continent. The animal, from which the head has been severed entire, is divided lengthways by a perpendicular section in two halves, sides, and these are divided into four quarters. Each anterior or fore quarter consists of a neck, which is in reality half a neck; a sho^llder, being in reality the shoulder-blade with adherent flesh ; the hack, or carri, from which the cdtclettes proper are made; and the breast or ribs of veal, which includes the anterior part, or brisket, with the tasty firm fat called kernel, and the rib cartilages near the sternum, or breast- bone, called in French tendrons. The dividing-line of the fore and hind quarters follows pretty nearly the natural division into chest and abdomen, as indicated by the diaphragm or

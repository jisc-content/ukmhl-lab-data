BOUILLON, OR MEAT-BROTH ”3 the resulting broth 1 lb. of dry extract. But according to the first experiment he should have obtained only fifteen half ounces, or ^ oz. of extract from every pound of flesh. He had, therefore, to account for the origin of the excess of oz. of extract, and did so as follows : The bones had not changed in weight during boiling, which caused the investigator to exclaim, ‘ Voilh covwie les os font du bouillon,' in allusion to the fallacy current in many kitchens, that broth could be extracted by boiling from mere bones; the excess of weight in the extract had been obtained by the formation of gelatine from soft parts—that is to say, gristle, tendons, ligaments, and membranes. Proust described the pure extract as a dry, flexible, elastic, brownish paste, which imparted to the mouth so intense a taste of meat that at first it was disagreeable. He found that alcohol separated from it half its weight in the shape of savoury principle, and that the part insoluble in alcohol was tasteless like gelatine. When fresh meat was 1 treated with alcohol, the savoury matter was also extracted, I and it was thus proved that the savoury principle is pre- sent in the meat before cooking, and is not produced by the process of cooking. The gravy of roast meat which flows during roasting pre-exists in the meat, just as the flavour of rum exists in the watery extract of the sugar- cane, but it becomes altered and improved by the influence of heat. The meat fibre deprived of its juice is still nourishing, but completely tasteless. Geoffrey pressed it to remove the last traces of broth, and found that men would not eat it, and dogs devoured it only under the compulsion of duction of the sapid meat-extract was an acid,* and promised to prove this in a subsequent article ; he unfortunately left hunger. Proust surmised that the most active principle in the pro- Probably the acid teimed subsequently mosinic acid by Liebig. 8

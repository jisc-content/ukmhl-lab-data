4 THE SPIRIT OF COOKER\ uncooked state,* would now be prepared by boiling, and having been also broken by pounding instruments, stones and wood-pestles, would yield the earliest massive nutritive material, viz., grue.l.\ Further Illustrations of Evolution. The development of the culinary treatment of meat on the one hand would lead to the discovery or invention of soups, stews, and sauces, while that of the treatment of cereals would result in bread, first unleavened, afterwards leavened, ultimately harmed, lastly raised by chemical means through mineral agents in the shape of baking-powders. The incidents of roasting would afford opportunities for the study of the use and management oi fat; a similar result would come out of the treatment of the milk of cows, namely, the knowledge of producing and using butter. More southern men would have learned and practised the use of fat from the oil-yielding seeds, such as nuts, almonds, poppy-seeds, and particularly olives. To these main sup- porters of life the use of green vegetables, of roots, rhizomes, Milbs, sproids, and siveet or aromatic fruit could only have been added very gradually, as they required to be educed from their original so-called wild condition by horticultural art—an art which presupposes stability of society and of property, and was never practised by either pastoral nomads or the huntsmen of the archaic forests. The discovery of zests and spices was one of the latest acquisitions of culinary science, and presupposed a great development of trade both by land and sea. The earliest universal sioeet principle of food was honey; while s^i^ar from plants, particularly from the sugar-cane, was an expensive curiosity yet in Eoman imperial times, and did not become a staple article of trade * The extremely ground-clown condition of their teeth has been at- tempted to be explained by this practice. t ‘Rome was reared upon gruel,’ said Cato of Utica.

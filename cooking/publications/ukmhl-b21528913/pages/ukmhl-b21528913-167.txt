139 rOT-AU-FEU another with lb. of beef, called the, small* We give the quantities in grammes of the original: (a) Larger pot-au-feu: Meat, 1 kilo 500 grni. ; bones, 400 grm.; water, 8 litres; salt, 60 grm.; carrots, 300 grm.; onions, 300 grm.; leeks, 400 grm.; celery, 25 grm.; cloves, 2; turnips, 300 grm. ; parsnips, 50 grm. (h) Small 2^ot-a2ir-feit,: Meat, 750 grm. ; bones, 125 grm., or about the quantity which generally accompanies the meat—that is to say, imposed by the butcher on the pur- chaser; water, 4 litres; salt, 30 grm.; carrots, 150 grm.; onions, 150 grm.; leeks, 200 grm. ; celery, 10 grm. ; clove, 1; turnips, 150 grm.; parsnips, 25 grm. Practical Consideration of these Recipes.—We should exclude the bones from both recipes as mere encum- brances and perfectly useless. Now, as 750 grm. of beef in 4,000 grm. of water (or 1| kilos in 8 litres) give a very weak broth, this deficiency has to be covered by the addition of large quantities of vegetables, the sum of the weight of which stands to the weight of the meat in the proportion of 6 to 7. Owing to the large quantity of these vegetable ingredients, the soup will be good to eat notwith- standing its weakness as regards meat-extract, but will be strongly flavoured with onion and leek, and the meat will be much exhausted, and require some tasty garnishings to make it palatable. The small pot-au-fexi is said to be sufficient for four or five persons, or for two or three on two succeed- ing days. The meat will probably not yield to the water more than one-third of its osmazome, or savoury extractive, equal to that of half a pound of flesh, or a quarter of an ounce of mercantile extract. Our standard broth, however, contains half an ounce in the pint, therefore four ounces to the four litres; the small pot-au-feu thus yields a broth which, as regards meat-extract, contains only one-sixteenth the * Cf.

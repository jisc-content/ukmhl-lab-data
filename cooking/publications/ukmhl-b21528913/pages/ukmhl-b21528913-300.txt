THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 272 Many modern recipes for hlanc-manger are content with a mixture of milk and starch, w'hich, when boiled and cooled, becomes an opaque jelly, a mere flummery. This may be eaten with a sweet custard sauce. Others, again, destroy the character of the dish by adding chocolate, and term it chocolate blanc-manger.

Jellies should not be impregnated with mere perfu,rnes, such as violets, for they will be as disappointing as the sugared violets which became a fashion under the Second Empire in France. Artiflcial ethers resembling fruit- essences should also be avoided. Fruit Jams which in England are called Cheese. The prototype of these confections is the jam made originally of quinces and honey, now of quinces and sugar. From the Spanish name of the quince, viarmela, this jam was called marmelada. From this the name was transferred to orange jam, which many persist in affectedly calling orange marmelade. While orange jam has little resemblance to true marmelade as regards consistency, there are other kinds of fruit the pulp of which furnishes excellent cheeseâ€”particularly of the plum tribe, apricots, and above all damsons. In these small plums the pectin bodies which produce the dense gelatinizing principle are most successfully developed. The more juicy kinds of fruit used in domestic cookery, such as currants and raspberries, contain enough of these pectin bodies to yield jellies, but never enough to produce so dense a con- fection as is implied by the metaphoric term of cheese. Their juice requires an addition of some gelatinizing principle, which might appropriately be agar-agar, but, under the conditions of rarity to \vhich this cheap and

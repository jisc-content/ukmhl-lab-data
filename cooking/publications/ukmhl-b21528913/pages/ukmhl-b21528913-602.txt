574 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY paste, which, when closed, passes by the misleading name of casserole, when open by that of border. It is such an advantage for meat to be enclosed in paste that the mere variation of the enclosing medium requires no notice. But it challenges notice when the variation results in the dete- rioration of the quality of the product which is yielded as purchase value for the supposed improvement in the external appearance. The casserole au riz is a preparation which has had its evolution, as is evident from the following definition of its earliest stage : ‘ A piece of cooked meat may be en- closed in rice which has been boiled and moistened with a little bouillon and lard ; make a round ball of it, and bake it in the oven until it has a little colour.’ As in all evolutions there are abortive segmentations, so here we have one effected by De Courchamps ; a casserole of rice is described as an imitation (of the shape) of a piineapple, the material being a mixture of rice and apples ; thus an entremets of rather difficult construction was proposed to take the place of an entree of relative simplicity. The merit of the casserole of rice, if it has any apart from the contents, consists exclusively in its appearance, for it can hardly be eatable, and even if it was accessible to a broad, good-humoured appetite, is certainly not eaten, and on that ground alone would appear to be a very superfluous contrivance. It is a coarse patAcase, has not a single attractive feature about it, and it requires a high degi’ee of imagination on the part of a cook to call it elegant. If such forms be wanted to serve entrees, by all means let us have them moulded in porcelain or clay, and burnt, and let the designs be really elegant; but do not call clumsy inedible masses of mere rice paste of the shape of lialf a Stilton cheese artistic productions, and scrapings with bits of raw potatoes or turnips on its surface ornamental designs. After this confession we need not go into details regarding the possible contents of such casseroles. They might, of course,

i84 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY level of dry champagne, but taste, instead of becoming coarse, has stooped to insipidity. The French expression Usque, signified a soup made from crayfish, and was not applied to any other culinary prepara- tion without special qualification. It is, therefore, a sufii- cient definition, and the expression Usque d’dcrevisses is perhaps a tautology. Bisque is an ancient soup, as is shown by literary refer- ences. One of the most spirited allusions to it is by the chaplain of Francis I., King of France, Meshn de Saint- Gelais, in a poetical letter addressed to a lady: ‘ Quand on est febricitant Ma dame on se trouve en risque Et pour un assez longtemps De ne jouer k la brisque, Et de mal diner, partant De ne point manger de bisque, Si rude et si fSuheux risque Que je bisque en y songeant. ’ Less witty and somewhat inconsistent in its conclusion is the description of a gourmand at the time of Boileau : ‘ dont la mine fleurie Semblait d’ortolans seuls et de bisque nourrie.’ Most recipes for bisque begin with ‘ Lavez cinqtiante dcre- visses,’ and the crowd of copyists all repeat, ‘ Wash half a hundred crayfish ’; but as there are at least two varieties of crayfish,* and as both vary greatly in size, quite apart from differences according with their age, this ‘ dosage ’ of the basis of the bisque is much too uncertain. The quantity of fish to be used should be indicated by the aggregate weight as well as the number of fish necessary to make it up. The traditional fifty crayfish would probably be of the * Syn. Crawfish, Astacus Jluviatilis. Bisqxte is translated as crawfish soup or cullis simply in Smith and Hamilton (‘Eng.-Fr. Diet.’). Brisque is a game, yew de paume, Ang.i>dds. D.D., 246, gives a receipt of Vuille- mot’s for bisque, which is faulty as regards the period at, and the circum- stances under which, the carapaces of the crayfish are to be pounded and extracted.

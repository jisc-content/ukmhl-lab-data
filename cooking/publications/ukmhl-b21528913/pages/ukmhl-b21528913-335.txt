PUREES IN GENERAL 307 meat purees are of great value to the sick, and even to persons suffering from defects of the masticating organs, or local affections of the mouth, tongue, and throat, and may be made useful as part of the diet of children. The mstriimcnts necessary for the production of puree in general are, in the first place, those which will mince meat very fine, or a mincing-machine so called, cutting by revolving ■and fixed knives, and pressing through metal sieves with round holes; 7nincing-knives of semilunar shape, which cut hy rocking action, hence called rocking-knives ; a strong mortar of marble, and a pestle of boxiooocl—the mortar should be permanently placed on a block of wood, being a section of a tree somewhat' wider in diameter than the mortar. There should then be large hair sieves of horse- Ihair, with from 72 to 144 openings to the square inch, and wire sieves ; it is useful to have sieves of different widths of the openings, as their successive use saves both time and labour. The tougher materials having been minced, can be pre- pared for passing the sieve only by strong pounding. This is best effected if the quantities taken are not too large ; mere trituration is sufficient in the case of leguminous seeds, but coherent materials require to be comminuted by strong blows of the pestle. Then place the sieve over a large bowl -or dish, so that it stands entirely within it-; put the pulp on the sieve and triturate it with a wooden spoon. Some cooks from time to time invert the sieve, and scrape off the portion of the puree which adheres to the under side ; but this seems not in any way mechanically useful, but a natural impatience to estimate the increase of the result of the work done. Eemove the remainder from the top, to pound it again if necessary, and wash the sieve in hot water, to clear the meshes of any fixed fibres. We have found a stiff circular disc-like brush, with a central perpen- dicular handle, an excellent substitute for the spoon, and

591 rO.-lCfriXG AXD frying of eggs kitchen, however accurately an egg, or any number of eggs, may be boiled by a strict application of these mathematical rules in a laboratory or on a breakfast-table. Hence it follows that the boiling of eggs in kitchens will mostly be left to the instinctive feeling of cooks, and that the practice which they have once acquired can never be modified, because it is inaccessible to argument based upon physical data, and therefore boiled eggs for breakfast will always, within certain limits, be a result of fortuity. Poached eggs are eggs boiled after the removal of the shell. The cook who wishes to display her skill in poaching, says Kitchiner, must endeavour to procure eggs that have been laid a couple of days. Those that are quite new-laid are so milky that, take all the care you can, your cooking of them will seldom procure you the praise of being a prime poacher; on the other hand, you must have fresh eggs, or it is equally impossible. The beauty of the poached egg is for the yolk to be seen blushing through the white, which should only be just sufficiently hardened to form a trans- parent veil for the egg. To poach eggs, have a stewpan half filled with clear boiling water on the fire; add some salt and a little vinegar; break an egg into a cup, remove the stewpan from the fire, and gently slip the egg into the water; let it stand till the white be set, then put the pan on the fire, and as soon as the water boils take out the egg with a slice or straining ladle; trim off the ragged edges of the white with a pair of scissors, and place it on toast or any other suitable basis. Or break ea.ch egg into a separate dariole mould, and slip one after the other into the stewpan containing boiling water mixed with a tablespoonful of vinegar and some salt; let them boil for two minutes, and withdraw them in the order in which you entered them, or simultaneously by means of a wire basket. The bread to receive the poached egg should be a little larger than the egg, and about a quarter of an inch thick ; it

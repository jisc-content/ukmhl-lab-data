130 THE SJ>IE/T OF COOKERY proved to his satisfaction bones to be nutritive by allowing dogs the choice between soup and bones : the animals chose the bones and left the soup. He pulverized bones (against which Proust bad warned), and called this the ‘ solution of the Gordian knot ’ and the ‘ egg of Columbus.’ But this was a mere filch from Cbaugeux. Proust reduced all meat-jellies to a constant degree of dryness ; be proposed that they should be used by mariners, travellers, and explorers of new countries, and enable every- body to produce immediately bouillon for kitchen, hospital, and poor-house. Devaux bad declared the bouillon of meat to be ‘ a black, salt, acrid juice, which beats the mouth and decomposes,’ while the bone-bouillon was to be in every respect superior. Proust refuted Devaux at length, and did too much honour to this vapouring charlatan; but the charlatan all the same received the felicitations of learned societies, generals, prefects, princes of Germany, and other ‘ philanthropists ’; even his Holiness the Pope blessed him with his own hand, as a friend of humanity, and told him that at Eome he, the Pope, had eleven establishments for the production of ‘ bone-broth ’ (evidently destitute soup- kitchens). Proust advised Devaux to put all his letters and compliments into a fascicle, and mark it on the outside; ‘ Matters about which I know nothing.’ But the ‘ science ’ blessed as philanthropic by a Pope had the usual vitality of error. Devaux in 1828 published a new pamphlet of 112 pages.* Gelatine is there described as being amongst nutriments what gold is amongst metals; its bouillon is good for all ages and conditions, for the animal body consists entirely of gelatine; but meat-broth frequently aggravates illness, and is not even good for convalescents. A hundredweight of bones represent by the gelatine which they contain that amount of gelatine * ‘ De la gcSlatine dea oa et de son bouillon,' dedicated to tlie l>uc de herri.

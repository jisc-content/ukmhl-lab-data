Soak them in water frequently renewed, and then boil them in water until the shell is easily detached from the cartilage ; free the latter from all pieces of shell, ligaments or flesh ; put it in a stew- pan, cover it with standard broth, add the symphony of vegetables, and boil for two hours, or until the pieces of cartilage have become transparent and rather soft to the touch. Drain them on a sieve, and cut them in small pieces ; finish the broth, and pour it over the pieces of cartilage.* Sturgeon Soup with Gurry is the same preparation as the foregoing, or soup sauce from sturgeon-flesh-broth with white roux and vegetable puree, all flavoured with curry, put over sturgeon-head cartilage, garnished with rice. Fish Souchets or Souchies. The significance of the word ‘ souchet ’ or ‘ souchy ’ is not explained in dictionaries or cookery-books ; it is not used by the latest French authors of note, the author of ‘ D.D.’ or Gouffe. It might be derived from souche, stump or piece. It is often used in combination with the prefix xoater, as water-soicchet, or with fish, as fish-souchet.t Most so-called water-souchets in cookery-books appear to be stews of fish with a thin, gravy-like, savoury sauce; nevertheless, they are ranged under soups. What is given in London taverns and restaurants occasionally as water-souchets is mere common flat fish—e.g., flounders—cut transversely in large slices, and boiled in water with some roots and herbs. We have never observed any souchets to be filleted. A souchet * For Chinese sturgeon soup, cf. F., 341.

THEORY OF THE PROCESS OF FRYING 285 solidity of the fats, stearin (tristearo-glyceride) rises, and at last prevails in quantity. Ox suet is almost entirely composed of stearin, with very little of the other fats. The chemically imre, fats have neither taste nor flavour ; these distinguishing qualities they obtain from the admixture of substances which are either naturally present or imparted by changes, such as oxidation or fermentation, or by art, particularly culinary art. On the other hand, flavour can be withdrawn from fats, and such tasteless and odourless fats might, like flavourless spirits, be termed silent fats. De- composing fats are called rancid; decomposing butter becomes very objectionable by the liberation of butyric acid; decomposing animal fat tissue communicates the odour of the tissue in which it is stored to the liberated fat. Overheated or burnt fat, as it is called, assumes the disagreeable taste, and emits the irritating odour, of a substance formed from glycerol, termed acrol. Theory of the Process of Baking in Fat, called Frying (Phrygology). The operation of frying may be defined as the cooking of things intended to be eaten by means of fat; it postulates a pure-tasting fat or oil, and a high degree of heat. The proper degree of heat is indicated by the fact that substances containing moisture, on being placed into hot fat, will apparently make it boil—that is to say, part with their water—and, when their surface can be raised to a sufficiently high temperature, become yellow and brown. The expres- sion ‘ boiling fat,’ which is sometimes used in connection with frying, has therefore to be interpreted as meaning, not fat assumed to boil by itself under the influence of heat, for it never does boil when pure, but fat in which a material suitable for being fried will cause the phenomenon of ebullition by itself giving out steam, and become browned, or frit.

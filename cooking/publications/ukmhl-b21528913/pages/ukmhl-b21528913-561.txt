Ooo SMELT AND SPRATS Corporation of Rochester presented him with a dish of smelts; but it is reported that at times they could be no longer obtained near Rochester. Large numbers come from Holland, but are necessarily judged to be inferior to the English. Smelt has roe, the salmon fry, called smolt, laas none; smelt spawn in November to January, and are then useless, but remain in season during the other nine months of the year. When fresh it has a smell of violet and cucumber, from which its name may be derived, and on account of which the Germans call it foetid (stink fish); this odour disappears when they are twelve hours out of the water. When bought they should be stiff and firm, have bright eyes and a transparent skin. They are trimmed by pulling out the gills, which bring the trail with them. When smelt is split and dried it is called sparling. A variety of sea and river smelt, the atherine, sea smelt, or sand smelt, is inferior to the real smelt; it is taken in large numbers in the harbour of Boulogne, and for- warded to Paris. Smelt is fried exclusively, and not prepared in any other way; dredged with flour, and painted with butter or oil, crumbed and egged, it is im- mersed in hot fat, or oil, and fried to a light brown colour. Sprats, German Sprotteii, are small fish of the size of anchovies and sardines, which are taken in the Baltic and North Sea, most conveniently and abundantly in the river Thames, even as high as Greenwich, in November, and for some time after. The firsc dish of sprats of the season used to be served at the Lord Mayorâ€™s dinner on the day of his acceding to office. Great numbers of sprats are consumed by the population, the fish being very cheap, costing a penny a pound; the ignorant Philistines are asked to pay fourpence a pound, and, of course, avoid this exces- sive price. Sprats are by many believed to be young heirings. They do not seem to differ much anatomically

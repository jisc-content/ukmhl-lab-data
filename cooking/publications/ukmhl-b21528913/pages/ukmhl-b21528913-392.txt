364 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY All these varieties of paste can be made with oil, if this be freed from its flavour or odour previous to use by sub- jecting it to heat and frying a little bread in it. The Spaniards facilitate the use of oil in pastry by mixing it with heef suet; the mixture acquires the consistency of butter, and is then incorporated with the flour in the same manner as this. All the varieties of paste enumerated above were well known more than two centuries ago, but they do not seem to have been specifically known to antiquity. There are apparently no records of the time and place at which flake doiujh was invented, or at least developed. In parts of Germany flake dough is also called Spanish dough, but no ground for this appellation has ever been given. Short Paste for Pies is made in the same manner and of the same quantities of materials as the short paste for hot psites. With acid fruit the under side of the pie-crust some- times remains pasty and soft, and, from volatile acid, of un- attractive taste. To avoid this, some cooks bake the crust separately, and cut it in slices and serve it with the fruit, but on a separate dish. Noidlles Paste has already been referred to above under the notes on soups ; remember that this paste contains no butter. Paste which is intended to be the material for the orna- mentation of pastry is called Office Paste, and is made of flour two parts, sugar one part, and (to the pound of flour) two eggs and two yolks; no fat of any kind is added to this paste. An Almond Paste for Ornaments and Croquantes is pro- duced in two stages. Make a pur6e of Jordan almonds, and incorporate with it an equal weight of sugar-powder in a casserole over the fire. Produce a solution of gum dragon or tragacanth in eight to ten times its weight of water, and filter it by pressure through a cloth. Incorporate this solu- tion as well as a quantity of finely-powdered sugar, equal

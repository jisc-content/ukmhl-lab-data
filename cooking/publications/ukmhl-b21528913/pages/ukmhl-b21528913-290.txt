262 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY tendinous, gristly, and skinny parts of the extremities of animals (the Italians have in this relation a fancy for the legs of kids), and the hony and horny parts of the skeleton ; only the bone-like horns of the stag tribe yield gelatine : the horns of oxen, sheep, goats, etc., do not yield this sub- stance by boiling in water. There is a fourth kind of jelly produced by culinary operations, which, however, is not called so, but is termed cream, or Bavarian cream, or Bavarian cheese, French Bavaroise; it consists of a gelatine jelly mixed with cream as froth, or with a carbo-hydrate jelly and whipped cream, and with white of eggs in the state of froth. Isinglass was preferred by cooks because it yielded the clearest jellies, although, like the other gelatines, it mostly required purification (clarification). Of it 60 grm., or nearly 2 oz., were required for an ordinary quart jelly, which is more than double the quantity demanded above in the case of jelly from gelatine or calf’s foot. During cold seasons less gelatinizing substance is required. Of rasped hartshorn, 1 lb. (or 500 grm.) was required to yield by boiling with litres of water during six hours (!) 1 litre of jelly. Of fresh pig’s skin 1 lb. (or 500 grm.) had to be boiled for eight hours to yield gelatine which would set litres of jelly. Most cookery-books require for an ordinary jelly of the volume of 1 litre 80 grm. dry gelatine, 1 in 13-5, which we find much exceeding our standard proportion of 1 oz. to the quart of liquid = 1 in 32 ; or while the cookery-books require 8 per cent, of gelatine in a jelly, we require a little more than 3 per cent. (3T2 per cent.), say 3| per cent, of gelatine of the best quality. Making allowance for the exigencies of seasons and tastes, we maintain that jellies must not be too firm, but fuse easily in the warmth of the mouth ; over-firm jellies be- come quickly repugnant, and are not rarely left on the plate by persons of refined taste.

MULLIGATUNNY SOUP 199 peculiar to Southern India, and derives its name from the Tamil words violegoo (pepper) and ticnnee (water). In its simple form as partaken of by the poorer natives of Madras, it is, as its name indicates, a pepper-water used as a sauce, which the Madras cook makes as follows : He pounds together a dessertspoonful of tamarinds, six red chillies, six cloves of garlic, a tablespoonful of mustard- seed, a saltspoonful of fenugreek-seed, twelve black pepper- corns, a teaspoonful of salt, and six leaves of karay-pauTc. When the ingredients have been worked to a paste, he adds a pint of water, and boils the mixture for a quarter of an hour. Concurrently he cuts up two small onions, puts them into a chatty, and fries them in a dessertspoonful of gee till they begin to turn brown ; now he strains the pepper-water into the chatty, and cooks the mixture for five minutes, after which it is ready. This pepper-water is used as a mere sauce, for it is eaten with large quantities of rice. The English, applying their ideas of further develop- ment to this composition, added other condiments, gave it a basis of broth with chicken, mutton, etc., thickened the liquid with flour and butter, and by degrees succeeded in effecting the evolution of a decidedly characteristic and savoury soup. The best mulligatunny is nowadays obtained in England, where it is presented in the form of a clea7' as well as in that of a thick variety. Some think the former, from an artistic point of view, the better one, without, however, professing to under-rate the thick. They believe the superiority of the English mulligatunny over that com- monly prepared in India to be due to the foundation of broth, a point which most Indian cooks leave out of con- sideration.

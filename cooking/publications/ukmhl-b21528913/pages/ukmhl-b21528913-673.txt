DESSERT, NUMBER OF DISHES, GARNISHES 645 roasts, and six entremets; for twenty persons add a third more of the numbers given for fifteen. A false assumption of magnificence on the part of culinary authors shows itself in the recital 0/ garnishes to dishes, only a small proportion of which is ever executed. On perusal of many examples, we find that the more indifferent are the materials of the dishes, the more laborious and expensive are the garnishes recommended to be incorporated with or added to them. Garnishes have many uses, e.g., that of increasing the nutritive value, or bulk, or sufficiency for service of a dish, which by itself would be insufficient; thus, a chicken might not be sufficient for a carver to serve six plates, but when stuffed and moderately garnished it would probably be sufficient. Now, in all cases in which the original material, be it fish, bird, joint, or vegetable, is sufficient, a garnish can only be intended as a means of heightening the taste, but not as increasing the nutritive value of the dish; in all these cases it must be kept within the narrowest limits of quantity, and should never be applied as a means of merely impressing the eye. When, therefore, we give indications or hints for garnishes to many dishes, the readers should bear in mind that we do this only to assist them with suggestions to be used occasionally, but by no means to be regularly adhered to. On the contrary, we maintain that a well-cooked dish requires very few if any external additions. We do not underestimate the value of the external appearance of dishes, we also recognise that their appearance is of influence as regards their appreciation by gustation; but no one can judge a farce by its looks, or a dish masked by a thick sauce by its garnish, and there- fore w'e advise our readers to bestow all care, in the first place, upon the taste and appearance of the prime material of the dish, before they expend any thought, material, or labour upon collateral objects, croustades, croutons, fleurons, quenelles, crayfish, cocksâ€™ combs and kernels, truffles, and

THE SPIRIT OF COOKERV 32 Mayence, and a third by Anna Wecker,* * * § n6e Keller, the accomplished wife of the physician Wecker at Bale. Principal Authors in all Countries during the Seventeenth Century. In the seventeenth century culinary art not only made practical progress, but it began to be treated theoretically, and the publications concerning it lost to some extent the character of curiosities. The most celebrated cookery-book was, and remained for some time, that by Fran9ois Pierre de la Varenne.f By the side of this were most renowned the three anonymous French treatises quoted below under note I. Of German cookery-books the mOst celebrated was that by Maria Sophia Schellhammer, nie Conring, and by the side of this circulated cookery-books which bore the name of one or other of the large towns, like that of Niirn- * Wecker, Anna, ‘ Neu kiistlich und niitzliches Kochbuch.’ Published at Altorff in 1596, and frequently republished—e.^., at Bale, 1667, 8vo. Many of the works quoted in the foregoing have been republished several times, or even frequently, in different places, and at longer or shorter intervals! which shows that their contents were of important and recognised value. f Varenne, Francois Pierre de la, ‘ Le vray Cuisinier fraD9ois enseignant la maniere de bien apprester et assaissoner toutes sortes de viandes, grasses et maigres, legumes et p<1,tisseries‘'en perfection,’ etc., ‘augm. d’un nouveau Confiturier.’ Paris, 1654, 8vo. ; 1682, 8vo. ; k la Haye, 1656, 12mo. ; Amst., s.a., 8vo. ; also Lyon, 1699, h, I’Ecole des Ragoftts, etc. A German extract, under the title ‘The French Cook, and his Confec- tioner and Baker,’ etc., was published as an appendix to ‘ Sig.

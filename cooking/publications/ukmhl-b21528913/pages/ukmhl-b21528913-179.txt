C/^ASSIFICA TION OF SOUPS 151 have waived these considerations also for the purpose of giving to this arrangement the utmost practical utility. First division: Soups consisting of broth, gravy, or con- somme only, being clear sou'ps properly so called. The dietetic broths of the fifth division might be ranged here as a subdivision. Second division : Soups characterized by particular vege- tables ; a few compound recipes are included, but always exhibit a prevalence of one ingredient or another. Third division: Soups containing cereals or their products —rice, barley, rye, wheat, Italian paste, bread, potatoes, cassava, tapioca. Under this division the souioes au pain described above in connection with the p)ot-a^^,-feu should strictly be ranged, but in practical life they occupy a more general position. Fourth division: Soups made with leguminous seeds— peas, beans, lentils, soy. An appendix would contain recipes for soups of chestnuts. Fifth division: Soups with preparations of eggs, dietetic broths, and panadas (being more solid than soupes au pain). These might be somewhat differently distributed, e.g., the dietetic broths might go to the first division, and the panadas to the third; but they may be left united as serving a common purpose, and by their blandness and digestibility associating kindly with soups containing preparations of eggs. Sixth division: Soups characterized by molluscs (shell- fish), articulates, fishes, and reptiles. It includes some of the most celebrated recipes, such as that for bisque and turtle, and the fish soups of importance to certain religious denominations. Seventh division: Soups made with flesh purges and minces of fowl, game, rabbit, hare, etc. In this division are included some characteristic soups such as cock-a-leeky and rnulligatuuny.

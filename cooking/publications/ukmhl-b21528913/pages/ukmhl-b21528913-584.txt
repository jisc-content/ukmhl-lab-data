556 THE SPIRIT OF COOKER) The Bavarian renhe, a small carp, thrives in the deep waters of the Bavarian Alps or Highlands, and of Tyrol. At Munich, e.g., it may be had twice a week from the Lake of Starnberg when it is in season. Egged, crumbed, and fried, it is as perfect as any fish on the globe. It is almost boneless, a feature which raises it high above other sweet- water fish, eels alone excepted. It varies in size from that of a herring to much larger dimensions, in which it weighs up to 4^ lb. The pike, in its younger state also called jack, French hrochet, German Hecht, Esox Indus, is the shark of sweet waters ; it lives on fish, and swallows them entire. It is proliferous, and attains a considerable age and great size. Its flesh is shorter than that of cod, but is similarly destitute of flavour. A pike eats in six years 252 kilograms of living fish; taking the value of this at a franc per kilo, we have 252 francs, without considering how much this devoured fish would have increased in six years. Supx^osing a pike to weigh 10 kilos in the sixth year, it would cost the rearer 25 francs 2 centimes per kilo ; but probably it would not weigh 5 kilos in the sixth year, and cost more than 50 francs per kilo, while it would fetch in the market only 2 francs per kilo. The rearing of pike in closed ponds is therefore not a profitable business. In rivers it is destroyed as much as possible, and the size of pike taken over most x>arts of Europe has during the present century decreased considerably. The largest xfike of which we have authentic record was 46 inches long and 36 lb. in weight. Pike may be boiled blue or in court bouillon ; it improves by being hung for a few days in cold weather; it may be crimped and boiled; or braised; roasted; marinaded, crumbed, and grilled. Jack has a similar variety of recipes adapted to it: en fricandean; larded and braised with ragout; as fillets and cutlets fried and grilled, etc, ; stuffed and baked;

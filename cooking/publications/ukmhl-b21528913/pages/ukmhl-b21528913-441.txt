MILLE FEUILLES, iMACROONS, BRENTEN 413 encrusted loith almonds ; it also resembles a souffle, because the paste is first boiled and then baked; of this there are variations, one being baked in a case of paste, timbale oj rice, others resulting from substitution. Many-jlahed cakes, Gdteatix de Millc Fcuillcs, are an ancient highly-complicated luxury. Careme* says of it that ‘ cette grosse piece appartient encore a nos anciens.’ The mille is only a large round number to represent many, for the flakes, or fcuillcs, actually rise to several thousands in a cake. If, say, a pound of puff paste receives ten turns as prescribed, that yields 512 layers of flakes; if, as in the simi)lc mille fcuillcs cake, five such strata of 512 layers each are superposed, we have 2,560 flakes, and if, as in the com- pound millc fctullcs cake, ten such layers are superposed, we get 5,120 flakes. Cakes xoith prevalence of almonds carry almonds both in their substance and on the top; they are varied by additions of fruit and flavours. Their most specific representatives are Swedish macroons, but the rest are obscure undistinguished compositions. Macroons are meringue paste with pounded almonds added. They are made with ratafia flavour, i.c., a few bitter almonds are mixed with the sweet; maci’oons made of bitter almonds mainly are called ratafias, and are always of small size. Brcntcn, or Frankfort Brenten, are made of a paste of powdered almonds and sugar, which is roasted, and then receives an addition of a little flour, milk, cinnamon, and rose-water. The name of Brenten may possibly be derived from the fact of the paste being roasted, i.c., burnt (Germ. fjebrannt). Here may be placed Crackling, or Knack Cakes, which con- tain butter and eggs, and have the almonds on the surface. Fanchonettes are little round cakes consisting of a basis of * ‘ ratia«ier Royal Pariaitin,’ i. 266-272.

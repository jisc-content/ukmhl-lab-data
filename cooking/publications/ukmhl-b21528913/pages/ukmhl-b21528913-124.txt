96 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY Fifth Group : Aromatic Herbs, falsely called Savoury Herbs. Bay-leaf, leaf of Laxwus nohilis, L.; used in pickles, marinades, and curries. This leaf acts by an aromatic oil, and besides develops some prussic acid by a decomposition of one of its ingredients. Thy vie, the whole plant of Thyimis vulgaris, L., in blossom. The variety called lemon thyme is preferred for force-meat. Marjoram, Origanum majorana, L. Of this herb three varieties are used, called summer, winter, and boiling marjoram ; some also distinguish a wild and a sweet modi- fication. Basil {sweet), Ocymum hasilicum, L.; used for marinading fish and venison. Savory, Satureja hortensis. Of this herb, two varieties, summer and winter savory, are used. The name savory is a corruption of the Latin name satury, and is not derived from any savoury qualities, which, correctly speaking, it does not possess, for it is truly aromatic. The adjective savory has been extended to some similar herbs, which are now sold as a mixture, dried in bottles, broken up with stalks, wood, and all. Take care to use only leaves, finely powdered, and avoid, by picking out, wood and stalks. Savory is the best flavouring for green French beans, scarlet and white rimners. Take care for this purpose to obtain the entire plant, and the particular species, and not a mixture with others, which would spoil the beans. Greengrocers are sometimes so ignorant as to believe, or, at all events, to assert, that one aromatic herb is as good as another for beans, ' because they are all savoury â€™; their ignorance confounds the adjective wrongly applied to aromatics with the corrupted name of the satury. Mint, Mentha sativa or viridis; used raw as a flavouring

268 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY amounting to one ounce for every quart of vinous liquid. Care should be taken not to make the jellies too strong. There is a kind of frothy jelly produced by adding effer- vescent wine to an otherwise fully finished jelly mixture which is on the point of setting. It is called Jelly with Chavipagne. When the wine is stirred in and incorporated, the jelly is packed into a mould and kept in ice. Such a jelly may be combined with one containing still wine, and having a different colour. Thus, we have seen white cham- pagne jelly forming the top, and translucent hock jelly form- ing the basis, of jellies. Orange Jelly, when well made, idealizes the best features of the fruit. It embodies the zest, which is otherwise mainly wasted ; then it receives vigour and additional zest by some added lemon. Both the orange and lemon rind should be extracted with alcohol, and the tincture only should be added to the juice. Put the juice, say, of ten oranges and two lemons in a quart of water, and boil, while skimming, after having added 12 oz. of sugar {i.e., 1 oz. of sugar to each fruit). In case the boiled and skimmed solution were not to run clear through Rhenish filter-paper, it should be boiled with the beaten white of one egg, and then filtered. Dissolve 2 oz. of gelatine in a quart of water, and add the solution to the juicy clean syrup ; add a wineglassful of maraschino, or cognac, or mere alcohol to the product, and pour it into moulds. The product should be about 5 lb. of jelly. Clarification by albumin diminishes the flavour of the jelly; the tinctures of the zests should therefore be added quite at last, with the pointing of liqueur. Lemon Jelly is similarly prepared, only ten lemons being required for five pints of jelly. Mackloine of Oranges is orange jelly mixed with prepared sections of oranges.

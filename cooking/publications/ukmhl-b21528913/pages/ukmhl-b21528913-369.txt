34i POTATOES European yciin. In botany the plant passes as Dioscovea batatas, Ipomcea batatas, and Convolvulus batatas. The tuber has a sweetish taste, and is not so attractive as the potato; it is also more pulpy or pasty, so that a baked batata has to be eaten with a spoon out of the peel as a bag. It contains 75'78 per cent, of water; nitrogenized matters, 1’52 per cent.; fat, 0'36 per cent.; matter free from nitrogen, 20'06 per cent.; woody fibre, 1'07 per cent. ; ash, 1'21 per cent. The extractives free from nitrogen are, sugar, 1'73 per cent.; gum and dextrin, 2'23 per cent.; starch, 14*75 per cent., and other matter, 1*35 per cent. The starch made from them is sold in trade as ‘ Brazilian arrowroot, and serves mainly for the purpose of adulterating the true arrowroot. Yams may be stewed, fried either as they are, in slices, or dipped in batter {au beignets). Potatoes. The potato-plant is a member of the genus Solanum, or nightshade, of which we gave some notes under the head- ing of Tomatoes. The early varieties of potatoes grow and ripen in from seventy to ninety days after the earthing of the so-called seed - tubers, such as those grown on the Atlantic Islands, at Malta, and other warm places; while the large late potatoes of the moderate zone require 180 days from the time of planting. Potatoes are frequently carried to market in an unripe state, and then are watery and not wholesome—at least, not attractive. The potato contains in the mean 75*77 per cent, of water, or as much as meat; nitrogenized substances, 1*79 per cent. ; fat, 0*16 per cent.; starch, 20*56 per cent. ; woody fibre, 0*75 per cent.; and ash, 0*97 per cent. Of the 1*79 per cent, nitrogenized matter, 1*18 are soluble and insoluble albuminous matter, while 0*61 per cent, consists of asparagin, the substance of which we have spoken under Asparagus and Scorzonera, or Salsifis, and

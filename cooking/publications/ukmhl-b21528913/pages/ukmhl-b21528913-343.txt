When this starch or flour is dried on hot iron plates, it becomes iCooked and transformed into a body called tapioca. The third prodiict of the tubers is the milky juice, which in the fresh state is poisonous to man and animals. The poisonous principle is either destructible by air or volatile, .as the juice loses its poisonous qualities within thirty-six hours after it has been expressed, and immediately by boiling; the poison passes into the distillate. When this juice is condensed to a treacle-like thick extract it becomes xassareep, now to be described. Cassareep or cassarip, the concentrated juice of the tubers ■of the lanipha, is not mentioned by any of the earlier 'writers on the subject of this plant, and we may therefore :surmise that it is a relatively late discovery. It is a brown, slightly sweet, aromatic thick extract, which communicates an extraordinarily savoury taste to meat-gravies. Its prin- ■cipal value appears in the construction of the West Indian Pepper-pot. If this extract be not well sterilized after it is bottled, it is liable to pass into alcoholic fermentation, burst the bottle, and become lost. The sterilized extract, or ex- tract which has fermented, will keep for an indefinite period. When the juice of the tubers is allowed to ferment by itself, it yields a weak spirituous liquid called ouycou, from which a spirit can be distilled. There is a siueet variety of manioc called canianioc, the juice of which is not poisonous, and which can be eaten without any other preparation than baking in an oven or boiling in water.

378 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY bran to the animals which have hitherto consumed it (some, like millers’ horses, not without frequent evil effects, from the magnesium phosphate contained in bran, which forms calculi in the intestines), for they are qualified to digest such cellulose as man can under no circumstances assimilate. The testing of jlour for quality is effected with the aid of the eye, nose, and hand. It is the better the whiter it is; it must have its peculiar pure smell, free from all strange odour, and free from even a suspicion of rnouldiness; when a handful is strongly pressed, it must assume the shape of the hollow of the hand like a cast, and, remaining lumped together, must be capable of being laid flat on the table without collapsing. Flour may be tested by a quantitative analysis for the amount of soluble albuminoids which it contains, or which are found in it by a reaction following the presence of water. The greater is the amount of soluble matter, the less is the value of the flour for bread-making. On the other hand, the more gluten the flour contains the better. We now pass to the consideration of the actual process of bread-making, the most majestic of all food preparations, and prototype of almost all the many processes for the pro- duction of pastes, crusts, and cakes, which in their turn include the greatest achievements of culinary art. A sack of flour, the wholesale unit of miller and baker, weighs 280 lb. When made into bread it will yield from 90 to 94 loaves of 4 lb. each, or from 360 to 376 lb. of bread. The preparation of the ferment, in the quantity adapted to the sack of flour, is effected as follows : From 6 to 12 lb. of ripe, mealy potatoes are boiled and finely mashed, and mixed with water so as to form a thin paste; with this, at the temperature of 85° Fahr., from 14 to 2 lb. of wheaten flour are mixed, and to the compound a quart of brewer’s yeast is

THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 242 Butter Sauce (popularly termed Melted Butter), Sauce Beurr^e a I’Auglaise, Sauce Blanche. This sauce, which serves as the basis of many English sauces, requires great care in its preparation, and is very agreeable and useful. Put 4 oz. of butter into a stewpan, add thereto some tincture of nutmeg and pepper, and 4 oz. of sifted flour; knead the whole well together over the tire, and when it has become somewhat more fluid without increase in colour, moisten with a pint of warm water, or, better, standard broth; stir the sauce on the fire until it boils, and after having kept it boiling for a few minutes, withdraw it from the fire, and mix with it 1| lb. of fresh butter, added in small pieces with constant stirring. In case the sauce should throw up the butter in an oily form, add a tablespoonful of cold water, and continue stirring. Add salt, then pass the sauce through a tammy into a large saucepan, and keep it in the water-bath. If it is to be acidulous, add the juice of half a lemon, or a little vinegar, just before serving it, but never earlier ; never let it boil, or even stand long, after the acid has been in- corporated. When the sauce is incautiously exposed to a high temperature for any length of time, it is apt to become decomposed by the butter collecting on the surface as an oil; this can be counteracted by the addition of a little cold water in winter, or a small piece of clear ice in summer, and working the sauce briskly with a spoon ; it will then soon assume its original smoothness. As the quantity of butter incorporated in the foregoing sauce will be altogether 30 oz., and as some may object to it on account of its richness, it is necessary to know that becamo known in wider circles only towards the middle of la.st century, and vclont6 only towards its end ; for neither ‘ Dons do Conuis ’ nor La Chapelle has the term ‘ veloute.’

THE SPIRIT OF CGOKERl 4o8 Black Sea. The Latins received hazel nuts from Prceneste and Avellinnm. From the latter village the French name of avclines originated, also the adjective adopted in Linne’s botany, Avellana. Hazel-nuts have lost nothing in the esteem of mankind, as we can see from the discussion of their merits by the Greek physician Galen. Pistachios are, according to Theophrast, natives of India, and were brought to Eome from Syria by Lucius Yitellius in the reign of Tiberius; thence they were taken to Spain by Flaccus Tiberius. The discussion for and against pista- chios, which was once lively amongst physicians, as evidenced by the discussions on them contained in the works of Galen and Avicenna, are of no practical value now that the character of their nuts is fully known. The White Nougat of Marseilles consists of almonds and pistachios boiled with Narbonne honey. The Broivn Nougat is made with burnt almonds only, without any pistachios, and into this mainly has sugar been introduced, not for gustatory, but for mechanical reasons. This brown com- pound is much used for the construction of fancy con- fectionery representing rocks and ruins, and as these have sometimes to be kept and transported, and honey nougat would not have the requisite solidity to endure this, sugar had to be substituted for the honey to enable the rocks and ruins to maintain their position and structure. Genoa Calces, Fr. Gdnoises, generally occur as cakelets, and are made of sugar, eggs, flour, almonds, or pistachios, walnuts, filberts, etc., glaced on the top; they are liable to undergo many variations—some like nougat, but without honey being introduced. (A large dense cake, with almonds outside, sold in slices by London confectioners under the name of Genoa cake, does not fit the definition of that name in our historical system.) In ‘ Dons de Comus ’ genoises are covered tartlets like English mince-pies, and plums do not enter into their composition. There are many varia-

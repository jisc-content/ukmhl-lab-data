4o6 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY while just hot out of the iron, with a little sugar strewed over them, Imt soon become tough and lose their attraction. (2) With a stirred dough, of which flour, eggs, butter, and milk are the only ingredients; this is the richest or fattiest form. (3) With a mixture of two doughs prepared separately as under (1) and (2). The fermented dough, having been started first, as it requires time, is called the fore-dough or siDonge, The mixed dough corresponds to the mixed doughs described above, used for brioche, Kugelhopfe, croplets, pan- cakes, etc., but is kept more fluid, so as easily to run into the waffle-iron. The variations are numerous, but not important; the mixed dough may be produced in one operation, but is less accomplished. The rising of the waffles may be efJected by the addition of ivhipped cream or whiptped white of egg to the dough ; the product is called fancy waffles, and of these there are again variations; French sweet gauffres are such fancy gauffres. Another form of thin cakes baked in smaller irons, not honeycombed, but marked with a pattern, are hiepen or hipp)cn. But their constitution is more that of almond confections. When that is not the case they differ in no wise except in size and outer form from small waffles. CHAPTER XXXIII. SPECIALIZED CAKES AND CONFECTIONERIES. As we proceed from bread through cakes, we come to an increasing specialization of products which are no longer in the hands of bakers, but of confectioners. The art of pro- ducing any refined cakes is not often, rather very rarely.

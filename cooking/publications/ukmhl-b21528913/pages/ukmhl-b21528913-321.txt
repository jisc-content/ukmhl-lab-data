CLASSIFICATION OF FRITURES 293 kromesky is thus seen to contain the same kind of salpicon as the bouchee or the croquette; it differs from the latter not even in shape, but only by the material by which the shape is maintained. Bissoles are a kind of pastry made of minced and spiced ]neat or vegetables, or fruit, wrapped in a paste, and fried in lard. The paste may be the one used for nouilles or ravioli. Probably these preparations were originally made with whole rice, and this gave the name. From the word and thing rissole are derived the verb rissolcr, to give a nice red colour to baked and roasted meat, and the diminutive rissolettes, little portions of farce, served on little crusts of bread, called croutddes. There are recipes for many varieties of rissolesâ€”some for every day, some for fast-days; some are to be used as hors cVoeicvre for garnish. Besides the savoury ones, many forms contain vegetables only, such as spinach and mush- rooms, and fruit, such as apricot. The term rissolettes, or croiUades, is a modern French expression for the old Italian crustini, the little excavated pieces of fried bread, which are charged with some force- meat or tiny portions of fine ragout; these savoury parts are not fried. Croutons are the most simple fritures, and are used with soups, ragouts, and entremets. They are always tasty, and far excel mere toasted bread, even as sippets, or suckers up of gravy or sauce. They should be crisp, but not hard, have a firm exterior and soft interior. Hard croutons, necessitating noisy crunching, are not aesthetical.

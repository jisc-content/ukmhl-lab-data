GELATINIZED OR CHAUDFROID SAUCES 263 Some cookery-books erroneously consider the gelatinizing power of isinglass to be one quarter greater than that of gelatine, or 60 grm. of isinglass to be equal to 80 grm. of gelatine. Such gelatine must have been very inferior, and mixed with glue which had lost its gelatinizing power by excessive boiling. The hest gelatine is 200 per cent, better than the best isinglass. Gelatinized or Chaudfroid Sauces. We first allude to some preparations which form a transition from sauces to jellies, or combine some pro- perties of both. What French cooks term a chmodfroid is really a white or hrown jelly containing some sauce, veloute, espagnole, or hechamel incorporated with it; the name thus indicates a mixture, and is as self-contradicting as the ingredients are heterogeneous. When this sauce is applied to fowl, partridge, or woodcock, the dish also is called a chaudfroid of fowl, etc., being really fowl thinly covered with jelly, or glaced with this composition. We shall call chaudfroid a sauced jelly, or gelatinized sauce (compound jelly); it is the counterpart of what some again improperly call a hot aspic (aspic chaud). Thus, the proper place for chaudfroids in our system is between sauces and jellies, where we have accordingly placed them. The three principal varieties of chaudfroid correspond to the three principal sauces mentioned; other sauces are evidently not so suitable for this treatment. Citronized Milk Jelly, or Jelly with Curdled Milk, This very excellent refreshing and nutritious dish has for ingredients 1 quart of milk, 12 oz. of white sugar powder, 4 lemons, and 1 oz. of gelatine. When milk, sugar, gelatine, and lemon-zest have been boiled, turned out into a basin and allowed to cool a little, add the juice of the lemons, and continue stirring till the casein is curdled.

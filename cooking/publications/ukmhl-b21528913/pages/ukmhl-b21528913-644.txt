6i6 THE SIT/HT OF COOKERY court bouillon and similar preparations low-priced French wines have to bo used. All white and red Frencli and German wines are fit for the production of Woodruff CuiJ (made with Asperula odorata). Of some qualities of wine so-called Peach or Pineapple Bowl can be made; the liquid may be drunk, the fruit eaten with a teaspoon. Imperial or other snwcl tokay is not a wine, but a sweet, made of raisins, and either entirely or almost unfermented ; consequently, like Bota Tent (Tintilla de Eota), which is made in the same manner, it contains only a small per- centage of spirit, and may contain none. If it contains above 4 per cent, it is certainly adulterated. Marsala is very useful for cooking purposes, except those cases in which high flavour is required ; of extractive it will furnish a sufficient quantity. As regards cider or apiple wine, a revival has taken place of late years, and much excellent apple wine and perry is produced in Herefordshire and other counties. In Brittany and Germany also much cider is made and used. It is mixed in cii,ps {e.g., with woodruff) as well as drunk at table. In hot seasons sparkling cider is a very agreeable and wholesome beverage. Beer is used for the production of some kinds of soup, hot sp>iced drinks, and cooling beverages, such as shandy- gaff, a mixture of hops and malt beer with ginger-beer. The stronger and more hopped qualities are not used in cookery, but the varieties of medium strength are recom- mended in some recipesâ€”e.g., for boiling certain joints in. Practically, we believe, these recipes are very rarely carried out. Flip, or Ale Flip, is warmed ale to which sugar, cognac or rum, and ginger and nutmeg, have been added; this is beaten up with some stirred or frothed eggs, half the whites omitted, and well mixed. Tliis preparation is in parts known as one yard of flannel.

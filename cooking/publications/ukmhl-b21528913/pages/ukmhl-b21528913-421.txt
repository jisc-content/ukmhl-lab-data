393 PANCAKES AND KRAPFEN be extinguished. Cr&pc is perhaps related to the German Krdjjfel, Krapjcn, which in the north of Germany are also called pancakes. Pancakes should be fried crisp, and not pasty or flabby; for this reason they should not be kept covered, but eaten as soon as possible after having left the pan. The batter or dough can be fermented like that of waffles, or Krilpfel, with more or less butter, and particularly eggs. Herbs may be added. In this and other manners pancakes may he varied, c.(j., hy the addition of bruised ratafias, and of cream, by spreading apricot-jam over them and rolling them up. They may also be made compound by adding over each pancake, as it is finished, a thin layer of apricot jam, and over this a thin layer of potato-souffle batter, and making from six to twelve such layers, and then baking the pile for half an hour in the oven.

They are also called German pujfs and croplets. They are the nearest analogue to ordinary flat pancakes, but differ in this, that the dough is kept stiffâ€™er to enable the cook to roll it out, cut and fry it floating in fat, lard, butter (ghee), or olive oil. The Krapfen may receive, just before being baked, into their interior an addition of jam or fruit jelly; in that case the dough may be rolled somewhat thinner, doulffed over the jam or jelly, closed all round, and baked. Krapfen should, when introduced into the fat, at once

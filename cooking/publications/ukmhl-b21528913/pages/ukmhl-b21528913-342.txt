THE SPIRIT OE COOKERY 3M The Japanese eat the flour of the soy-bean cooked, and call the dish mx&o. Brillat-Savarin supposed that soy had been the garum of the Eomans : ‘ Soy which comes from India, and which is known to be the result of fishes fermented with mushrooms.’ This is followed by a sentence of prurient nonsense on fishes and truffles, with which this author concludes this passage. The latropha Plant and its Products. A plant largely grown in the West Indies, and supposed by the Abb6 Eaynal to have been brought from Africa by negroes, by them and the Indians termed manioc or macjnioc (French manioque), producing large tubers on its roots, was by Linne termed latroqYia manihot. This name, derived from iatron, ‘remedy,’ andp/inyo, ‘I eat,’ is intended to be expressive of the properties of different species of the genus, which were supposed to be healing as well as nutritious. Humboldt termed the plant laniq^ha manihot. Its roots or tubers become very large, and expand even to the size of a man’s thigh; their external tint is gray, green, or red, their pulp always white; their juice is milky; by rasping, leviga- tion, and pressure, they yield three products—a qndp, a starch, and a juice. The pulp, when obtained by mere comminution of the tubers, and drying, is called couaque; when it has lost some of its starch by levigation, and is dried, perhaps slightly cooked outside in the shape of small thin round cakes, it is called cassava/'' (spelled also cassavc and cas.savi); such cassava cakes, with milk, eggs, and cur- rants, form an excellent pudding. The mere starch, free from nitr’ogenized, pectin- and gum-like bodies, is called * Yoce Cassava. C/. Humboldt, ‘ Plant. /Hcjuinoct.,’ ii. 108 ; Subeirtin, Joimi.

COFFEE, TEA, YEEBA, AND CHOCOLATE 625 ing the infusion through a sieve, a cloth, or paper; the latter medium gives the brightest product. But this pro- cess of merely infusing is very wasteful, even when the coffee is finely powdered. It is preferable to unite the j;ro- cess of boilimj and infusing in the following manner : Place the amount of coffee which it is intended to use, less about one-tenth of its bulk, which is to be reserved, into the vessel in which you want to boil it, and pour over it the measured quantity of cold water; now heat to ebullition and keep boiling for some minutes ; then take the vessel off the fire and add to the liquid the reserved tenth part of the coffee, and stir it well in, but without boiling the mixture again. Let stand a few minutes, and then pour the coffee on the filter, liquid first, grounds last. To keej) coffee hot, place the vessel containing it in a water- bath, but do not heat it directly on a hot-plate, or on the fire, as it thereby alters its taste somewhat, and assumes the quality of merely boiled coffee. Boiled coffee is rarely bright when merely decanted, but requires filtration to become so. In Europe tea is generally prepared Ijy infusion of the leaves with boihng water, the vessel in which the infusion is made being warmed and rinsed previously with boiling water. The Japanese reduce their tea to a fine powder by pounding it; they put a certain portion of this into a teacup, pour boiling water upon it, stir it up, and drink it as soon as it is cool enough. Dubuisson recommended to put cold water into a kettle with the tea, cover it close, set it on the fire, and make it all but boil; when you see a sort of white scum on the surface take it from the fire; when the leaves sink it is ready. Or the night before you wish to have tea ready for drinking, pour on it as much cold water as you wish to make tea ; next morning pour oftâ€™ the clear liquor, and when you wish to drink it make it warm. 40

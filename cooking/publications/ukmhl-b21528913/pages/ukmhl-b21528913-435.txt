NOUGAT AND OTHER NUT CARES 407 possessed by ordinary cooks, and only here and there the daughters of families conserve the ancestral art of com- pounding such delicacies for the table. When even these accomplishments disappear, a general levelling down takes place, in which the standard of quality has to yield to one of price. Now comes the opportunity for the imitations and counterfeits which excite surprise by their gaudy as well as vulgar appearance, and the contrasting feeling evoked by their taste.

We were glad to find that in Alsatia confectioners, or, as they are termed in Ger- many, Gonditoren, preserved ancient traditions with regard to local products particularly, and that the filbert nougat had, like the hazel-nuts of the Vosges, lost nothing of its ancient glory.

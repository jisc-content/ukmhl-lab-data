426 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY boiled suet-dough apple pudding is produced. Or the apples, pommes cVAfrique or p>ommes cl’api, parboiled in syrup, each containing a preserved cherry, are put into a crust of vol- au-vent, or of tourtes d’entremets glacds, or of crotostades of fine paste in form of a flan. The apples may be covered or interspersed with layers of meringue paste. On the other hand, the apples may be used, as the oranges above, for the production of a raised case, and the interior of this may be filled with a pastry custard. When the apples are pricked and left prickly all over with sharply sliced almonds, a so-called hedgehog of applies results. Apple D^implings are fancied by many persons, and should be well prepared. Peel and core the apples, and fill them with apricot jam; wrap them in very thinly rolled- out paste, and paint them with beaten egg. Now put coils of bands of thin puff paste around them, give them the form of apples, and for a stalk a bit of cinnamon to each ; bake them in the oven, glace them with sugar, and send them to table. Hot Charlottes are correctly defined as preparations of fruit, contained in edible cases resembling in form those of raised pies, but being compounded of previously baked paste—such as bread, biscuit, or other materials. They may therefore be of great simplicity as regards material; while, on the other hand, they admit of great complication of material and ornamentation of structure. The name is more than a century old, and its origin is not stated. The Apple Charlotte is the most typical. A round, buttered Charlotte mould is lined with evenly-trimmed pieces of breadcrumb well buttered; the cavity is filled with half- stewed slices of apples, to which apricot jam, currants, etc., may be added, and closed with buttered bread. It is baked to a nice colour, turned out, and glaced. A Pear Charlotte is a generalization, and, as the pears are too mild, they require the admixture with them of red plum jam or damson

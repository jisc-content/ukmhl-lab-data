DRESSED CREAMS—BAVAROISES 275 put forth in books retailing cheap cookery and certain shops as creams, a name to which they are not entitled. We have therefore given them their proper defining name. A Custard Jelly loith Wine and Egg-froth bears the French appellation creme hachigue; the wine may be hock, champagne, madeira, or malaga. The amount of gelatine in all these jellies is kept at 6|- per cent., dry, or about 1 oz. to the pint, of the finished jelly, for they have to maintain a spongy, frothy condition; but the meat or sweet jellies require but ^ oz. to the pint. Custard Jelly loith Wine and Orange-juice is a good com- bination. Compoimd Custard Jellies with Cream and Custard Cream Jellies are mixtures of cream with custard and jelly, the latter added to give it consistence and shape, flavoured with materials similar to those which are employed in plain creams, custards, and jellies. When the cream is added to these compounds in the whipped state, they are by French cooks termed en mousse. This should be ‘ spongy.’ Such custard cream jellies may be flavoured with vanilla, or orange-floioer, or madeira xoine and vanilla, or maraschino, or coffee. An old recipe* prescribes curdling of the cream by the agency of (rennet) ferment obtained from fowl’s stomachs or gizzards. This recipe has been so deteriorated by copyists that, on the false assumption of the gizzards being introduced to produce gelatine, the real gelatine was omitted, and the eggs were omitted probably from parsimony; such a mutilated formula must necessarily produce a failure. Other flavours and additions are chocolate, burnt sugar, ox- caramel (resembling criixne bruUe), macaroons, and ratafia. A jelly flavoured with the latter also passes by the name of Italian cream, or Bavaroise xoith ratafia. * Cf. D.D., 4G9.

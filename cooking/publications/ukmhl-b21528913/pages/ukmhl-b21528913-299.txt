271 BLANC-MANGER Blanc-Manger and its Transformations. It appears from a letter of Madame de Maintenon that Dr. Fagon prescribed under the name of hlanc-manger an aliment to be used by patients affected with in- flammatory disorders. On following up the matter his- torically, we found the following old recipe for hlmic-matiger : Pound 125 grm. of blanched almonds with a little water, and add a litre of consomm4 made without vegetables and free from fat; in the place of the vegetables put into the bouillon with which you make consomm6 two cloves, a stick of cinnamon, and some salt; when the bouillon is well mixed with the almonds, add 60 grm. of the white flesh of roast fowl, minced and pounded, free from skin, tendons, and bone ; or roast veal, or a piece of breadcrumb. When all is well mixed, pass through the tammy, add to the pur4e the juice of an orange and 125 grm. of sugar, and place on a lively fire until the composition has become thickened. This, then, is really a so^cp of almonds and supreme de volaille in consomm6; how its name hlanc-manger came to be confined to a white jelly is not ascertained; but the limitation is of relatively recent origin, perhaps not older than the beginning of the present century. A blanc-manger is nowadays a jelly made with calfâ€™s foot, or gelatine, and milk of almonds. There are several modifications, marked by greater or lesser concentration of the ingredients. A French recipe even goes so far as to destroy the white colour of the jelly by an addition of grenetine, being gelatine coloured red with alkanet-root or cochineal. A recipe for a fried hlanc-manger leads to a pudding-like mixture of rice-flour, cream, marchpanes, macaroons, and eggs, lemon-zest, and salt, which is to be fried in butter or lard. But this is a misapplication of the name altogether, and should be discontinued.

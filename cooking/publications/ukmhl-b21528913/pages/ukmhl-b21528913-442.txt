414 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY jlakc dough, or pulf paste, in the shape of a flat little cup, like a dariolc, filled with a semi-liquid or moist creatn-like •prei^aralion, which in the older preparation was while, intended to represent, and mainly consisting of, cream, but in the later recipes also contained yolks, and thus became a custard. This second layer is next to be masked over with meringue paste, i.c., a mixture of white of egg, froth, and sugar, and this is to be ornamented on the top with bright- coloured jellies and jams. Fanchonettes are entremets, and were much fancied towards the latter half of the eighteenth century ; hence they have been termed some of the friandises du dernier sieclc. How little these delicate and elegant cakes are understood nowadays is evident from this fact alone, that some of the best books on pastry, in describing fanchonettes, omit entirely the basis of puff paste, without which such a cake is as impossible as a paid without a case.

Of Cheese Cakes the earliest description occurs in the Latin work already often alluded to, entitled ‘ De Ke Eustica,’ and ascribed to Cato the Elder, called of Utica. He simply terms it placenta, which is the Latin for cake in general, and not for any particular cake.

Cheese in connection with these cakes does not mean ripe cheese in the ordinary sense, but fresh pressed curds, or caseine. Cheese cakes, like fan- chonettes, have a basis of flake dough or puff paste, shaped like a httle flat saucer, and filled with a sweet custard con-

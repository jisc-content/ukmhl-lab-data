483 PREPARATIONS OF FOWLS the bacon, and brown the outside. In case you serve the roast chicken on a bed of watercresses, it becomes, in French magiric language, a rdt; but when served with made sauce—tomato, Dutch, crayfish, or any other—it is called an entrde. You may fill the chicken with truffles, or a well-seasoned farce, or with chestnuts. Chickens and Fowls boiled in water or standard broth, with vegetables, are a favourite English dish ; they may be eaten with boiled or broiled ham and white butter sauce. A chicken may be boiled in about fifteen minutes. When it is intended to be served with a sauce, e.g., bechamel and tarragon, it should be wiped quite dry before the sauce is put over it. Fowls may be stcxoed, particularly with rice, and this dish should always be made with standard broth ; as the fowl takes longer than the rice to become done, it is pre- ferable to boil each by itself, and mix the products. The best boiled fowl we know of is one boned, stuffed with farce, and cooked in standard broth in a Papin’s digester. From a comparison of the weight of boned fowl with that of its skeleton, and of its price to that of rumpsteak, we have learned that the price of the eatable part of fowl is about 2s. Id. per pound, or about one-third more than rumpsteak. Fricassee of Foxol is prepared with a typical white savoury sauce, which is best flavoured with mushrooms. The dish undergoes many variations, according to the special treatment of the sliced fowl, the garnishes, and the ragouts which it is made to accompany, and is then called d la St. Lambert; braised and fried, A la Daxtphine ; fried in oil, braised and garnished with ravioli, a laBomaine. Cxirried Foivl (syn. kari de poxtlet A VIndienne) is a fricassee to which curry-powder has been added; it is generally preferred with boiled rice; it should be savoury, contain no excess of onions, and be not too hot.

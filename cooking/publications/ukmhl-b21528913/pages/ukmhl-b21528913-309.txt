CULINARY FATS AND THE PROCESS OF FRYING 281 in cold cellars, it yields a very good butter, but on the lai'ge scale of extensive farms it is impracticable. Butter which has not a pure taste can be improved by washing first with salt waiter, then with some milk, and ultimately with pure water. It can be preserved by salting, but not thereby protected absolutely from deterioration. The best mode of preserving butter for culinary processes is clarification by heat. Clarified butter, Indian Ghee, Schmalz of the Germans, is produced by heating butter until all froth and deposit of casein has subsided and the liquid is perfectly clear and free from water. The necessary degree of heat is ascertained by immersion of a piece of breadcrumb, which should float under slight effervescence, and become slightly brown. Such butter will keep good indefinitely, and is the best and most reliable form for all culinary purposes. French cooks use butter for the fritures maigres, and aver that it requires more care than lard or suet, because it accepts heat quicker, and has therefore to be heated on a less active fire. In countries in which butter is rare—as in Italy, the South of France, Spain, and Portugal—hog’s lard or beef suet takes the place of butter for many culinary purposes for which in our northern countries butter exclusively is used. But this does not exclude the use of hog’s lard for frying in countries where butter is plentiful, as lard, on the whole, is considerably cheaper than butter. Lard is dis- liked by some cooks, as it is said to leave a disagreeable layer of fat on the objects fried. Mahometans and Jews, who do not use lard, find, in countries where butter is rare, an occasional substitute for it in goose fat. This, when clarified, is of excellent taste, but it can be obtained only in limited quantities, even from lake districts—e.g., that of North Germany, where geese are reared in great numbers.

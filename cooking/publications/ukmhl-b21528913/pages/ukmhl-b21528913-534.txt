5o6 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY have, further, salmis of woodcock and snipe ; we have them with truffles, or minced in croiistades, their jillets fried in butter, braised, etc. They receive the usual conventional names, which have in them no element of fixity, and do not call for detailed notice. Scotch Woodcock, an analogue of Welsh rabbit, is a preparation of buttered toast with anchovies, eggs and cream, set over the fire, and shonld not be confounded with any preparation of real woodcock. Widgeon (Fr. sarcelle) and teal are wild birds of the duck tribe, and may receive the same culinary treatment. They may be roasted, but require a sharp, z.e., acidulous and hot, sauce; they yield good salmis or fillets of breast. When they taste fishy they must be marinaded, and then yield good ragouts. By a process of generalization from the examples of goose, and duck, and fowl, culinary writers have arrived at many recipes for the preparation of these birds. None of them show any specificity in the preparation of the birds themselves, which are always to be roasted before being treated further. This is evidently the result of their peculiar flavour. The variation which gives the pretext for the title is always in the sauce or garnish only. Ortolans are rarely eaten in England ; when obtainable, they are said to come from Belgium ; they are in season in September, but in the South of France, e.g., at Toulouse, they can be had in numbers in June, being probably animals caught in spring and kept in cages. Ortolans may be baked on croustades lined with /a?â€˜cc, or rubbed with butter, crumbed, and roasted for ten minutes only ; they may also be roasted in paper, papillotes or caisses, and accompanied with a good sauce. Wheatears (Fr. motteux, cul blanc) are in season in August, and are rarely to be had in London ; they are more plentiful at Brighton, in the neighbourhood of which

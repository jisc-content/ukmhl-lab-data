PREPARATIONS OF WILD BOAR 473 The Wild Boar cannot be cleared of its bristles by scalding and scraping, but its surface has ho be singed with red-hot irons. The skin, therefore, always contains the roots of the bristles, and has to be soaked and boiled greatly to become eatable. The preservation of the skin is essential only in the case of the boar’s head; from all other parts it may be removed, like any other animal’s skin. The flesh of the Wild Boar's Saddle or Loins is very solid and tendinous, and requires, like the head, a double process of cooking, namely, braising in the first place, and after- wards painting, crumbing, baking, and basting with a savoury mirepoix. Some red deer in Germany receive a similar treatment. Wild boar may be roasted, or made into a ragoilt, or collared, i.e., rolled and dressed in aspic. But for all these preparations the boar must not be less than a year, and not more than three years old; a loin of an animal of about two years, well braised in a brown sauce, is an admirable delicacy.

Before being hung it requires to have certain lymphatic glands re- moved, which are liable to become starting-points of un- pleasant changes. The Neck is the next best joint, and requires no special treatment. The Shoulder and Breast

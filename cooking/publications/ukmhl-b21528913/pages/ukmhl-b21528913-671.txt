SECOND SERVICE, ROASTS, ENTREMETS 643 roast or roasts. It is therefore judged to be both ‘ intelli- gible and artistic’ that the releve and the rot should be separated from each other by two light entrees. Under the category of the roasts, the first division of the second service, are ordinarily comprehended, besides the I'eal roasts, certain cold dishes, which might be ranged in a particular order, and large dishes to be placed at the ends of the table. Thus, it happens that salad passes often as a rot; the same with pcMs de foie gras, and some fish fried or fish boiled blue; crayfish, the langouste or langostino, a large prawn, and prawns themselves, may be placed with the roasts or entremets. However, this always remains side-play; the essential part of the service are the pieces or joints of meat roasted on the spit or otherwise before the fire, or in the oven. In France the large joints of butcher’s meat are preferred as releves, while in England they are preferred as roasts—e.g., roast beef, leg of mutton, loin of veal; on French tables the roasts consist of fowl or roebuck, red- legged partridge, and ever so many small birds, from becasses to larks, hares, etc. To this is joined a selection of fish cooked in court bouillon, or fried of a golden colour; there are added terrines of Nirac, pdUs of Pdrigueiix, Chartres, Amiens, or Strashurg. Along with the roasts are placed the entremets, and as there are mostly some impatient people at every dinner, these cause themselves to be served with the entremets while the principal joints are being carved; but this interference is bad style, and is not to be recommended for imitation. At the time of the service of the entremets the convives do not any longer desire substantial dishes, but rather delicacies—fine and savoury vegetables well supplied with coulis, butter, or sugar; a timbale of macaroni, sugared fritures, light pastry, perfumed creams or cream-like jellies, golden and trembling soufiles, French or Russian charlottes, pyramids of meringues, flans, etc., all so arranged as to

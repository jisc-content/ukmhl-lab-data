THE SPIRIT or COOKERY 520 afterwards composed of other fish, but it always retained the name which recalled its origin. Pliny reports that the later makers of garum macerated the ‘ intestines ’ of fish in water saturated with salt, until putrefaction began to show itself; they then added parsley and vinegar. A thick garum was also prepared, and said to be obtained by allow- ing the entrails and other parts, generally thrown away, to liquefy in salt. At the time of Pliny the fish termed scomber was said to be preferred; of this either the gills, and ‘ intestines,’ or only the blood, taken directly the fish left the water, were alleged to be employed. The makers thus were said to obtain a precious liquid, which the further ingredients and treatment, and the care necessary for its production and preservation, rendered so dear that eight pints of it cost from fifteen to twenty pounds sterling. The most esteemed garum was that from Antipolis, and from Dalmatia. Horace praises that from Bysance. Into this compound mushrooms greatly entered, and parts of the scomber fish. An island near Carthagena was called Scombraria, because here many scombers were taken. Here a company was established which manufactured garum, and this was considered the best, and called Garum sociornm. The word scomber has been variously interpreted—on the one side as mackerel, on the other as tunny. The blood and entrails, i.e., probably, roe, of hmny fish, mixed with salt in a vase, produced also garum. The vessel was opened at the expiration of two months, and the rich garum was taken out. This may well have been a kind of caviar, A garum was also made from (it is alleged the livers of) anchovies, macerated in vinegar, pepper, salt, parsley, garlic, white wine, and sweet herbs. Apicius made a garum from (he alleges the livers of) red mullet. In old Eoman economical writers recipes are given for making garum from small fish, with much salt, stirring, standing, and addition of

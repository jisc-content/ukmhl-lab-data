According to Cato, the old Eomaus had been reared upon gruel, and this soup-like preparation was down to our days the general or occasional food of entire popula- tions. When gruel was superseded by better preparations, e.g., porridge, it was limited to the breakfast-table, ultimately to the sick-chamber; it survives in workhouses as skilly.

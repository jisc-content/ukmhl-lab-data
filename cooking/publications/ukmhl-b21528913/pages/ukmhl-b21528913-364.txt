336 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY boiling, are capable of yielding principles of agreeable taste and flavour, while in the raw state they are somewhat the reverse. It is clear, from the saccharine character of the turnip, that some increase of the sugar, by addition from without in the course of its preparation, may be quite harmonious with the whole of its taste. Such an increase is made in steiued and glazed turnips. A well-done piece of turnip in soup or stew is like a sponge, and when pressed in the mouth with the tongue against the palate, oozes out not only its own liquid, but also the matters and flavours which it may have absorbed from the liquid in which it was stewed. Gouffe says that turnips should not be boiled too long with broth, as they deteriorate the latter by absorption of savoury principles. The absorption undoubtedly takes place, and therefore turnips boiled in broth are of much better taste than- those boiled in mere water. But there is nothing like a condensation of savour in the turnip; it abstracts only a little broth while yielding some of its own juice and extractives. This is all in favour of the turnip, if it be intended that it should be eaten; if it is not to be eaten, but to be removed (from coulis, braises, soups, etc.), it should be pressed in a cloth in a screw-press, and the juice should be added to the preparation to be eaten, if need be, after concentration. The turnip may be eaten ptlain-hoiled in sauce, or mashed loith butter {d VAnglaise), or as purie.

OMELETTES, COMPOUND AND SAIT)UP)' 595 time. An omelette, like a custard, should just be set with- out being coherent; it should be pulpy without being fluid. It should break before the mere spoon or fork; if it requires a knife for division, it is spoiled. The most patronized form of omelette is that Aux Fines Herbes, mainly represented by parsley. Arabian Omelette of Ostrich Eggs is an invention of French cooks, dating from the period of a visit which Napoleon III. made to Algiers. The ostrich eggs came from a farm. The recipe from the cook of the Algiers Bey can be seen in D.D., 773. All the fat used was oil. An ostrich egg is equal to the contents of ten hens’ eggs. The number of compound omelettes which may be made is, of course, very great; there are several hundreds of them recorded in French culinary works, being the majority of preparations of eggs collected in several monographs. Very few of them are anything but coarse mixtures, and have any unity or thoughtful congruity about them. The omelette is a mildly savoury preparation, and does not well amalgamate with sweet principles, except when, as in the case of the Omelette axix Confitures, the fruity sweetness acts by massive gustatory contrast. From this point of view, a mere sweet omelette is a preparation not worthy of attention, although there are formulae for such, and even variations—e.g., Omelette ato Kirsch. Care should be taken that the confitures to be used with the omelette should be such—i.e., fine fruit jellies—and not jams or stewed fruit. At a private dinner in a large West End hotel, we saw a preparation announced as ‘ Omelette aux Confitures,’ which looked like a roll of boiled wash-leather, and contained stewed rhubarb (leaf stalks). The host sum- moned the head-waiter, and informed him that if the cook was not ashamed to send such a dish as this, he, the waiter, ought at least to have been ashamed to serve it.

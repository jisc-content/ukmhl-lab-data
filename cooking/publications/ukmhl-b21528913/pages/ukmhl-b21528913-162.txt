THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 134 CHAPTER VII. THE PRACTICE OF PRODUCING BROTHS, GRAVIES, AND CONSOMMES OF BEEF, VEAL, MUTTON, FOWL, AND GAME, AND THEIR USE WITH SOUPS AND SAUCES. General Observations. We have in the previous chapter given the, scientific 'prin- ciples on which all production of hroth for culinary use ought to he based. We have fully described the standard by which all such production should be measured and com- pared, and which may be applied to all recipes used in any kitchen, even to those which are destined to be superseded. The present chapter is a practical supplement to the previous one, inasmuch as it will form a transition to the actual pro- duction of soups and sauces, by giving the actual rules and recipes for the composing of any kind of broth, be it in the smallest household or the largest establishment. They are, of course, given as alternatives to be used on demand, in cases in which the use of extract of meat is for some reason or other excluded. In this relation it must be borne in mind that standard hroth from extract, or an equally strong broth obtained by extracting meat with boiling water directly, is only material for the production of gravy and conso77wi6, which latter when desired for use must under all circumstances be produced in the kitchen, and cannot at present be bought ready-made. We therefore repeat their definitions: Gravy is a watery solution of extract of meat which has been browned by the influence of heat upon the first time advanced in literature. Proustâ€™s claim to the discovery of extract of meat in its true pure form was recognised hy myself in the course of the studies for this work.

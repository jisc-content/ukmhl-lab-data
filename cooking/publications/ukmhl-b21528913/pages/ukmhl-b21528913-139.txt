III BOUILLON, OR MEAT-BROTH soup, and became discredited. ‘ Glue does not make bouillon.’ These tablets were counterfeits of the true tablets of portable bouillon, and were instrumental in de- stroying their reputation. To restore their reputation and establish a manufacture of a saleable standard article, a company was founded by two Dutch merchants of the name of Bouwens and Van Copenael, both domiciled at Paris. Their product was sold and known as Bo^lillon cle la Compagnie Hollandaise, and seems to have been a fair article of trade, containing certainly much extract of meat; for the French chemist Chevreul, who examined this product as member of a commission appointed by the Academy of Sciences in 1831, discovered in it the crys- tallized substance creatine in 1835, a discovery which marks the beginning of the chemical knowledge of flesh and its preparation. Proust examined the relative cost of his absolutely pure extract and of the extracts containing gelatine; he dis- covered a further source of difficulty in the appreciation of some varieties of bouillon tablets in this, that they con- tained salt—i.e., sodium chloride—caramel or burnt sugar, and extracts of parts of vegetables ; these additions made the tablets not only still less valuable by dilution, but rendered them deliquescent. The tablets were, in fact, an imitation, and a bad one too, of an old-established pre- paration current in all higher-class kitchens, namely, glace (or glaze, or glaize), the evaporated extract of the stock-pot, in fact a weak, and in its weakness varying, extract of meat mixed with as much gelatine as could practically be added to it. The Germans called this product pocket-bouillon, the French bouillon sec. Both stock-pot and glace will be considered lower down; here we continue the historical account of the subject, by premising that neither Proust nor Chevreul, and a fortiori none of the members of the commission of the Academy, seems to have been acquainted

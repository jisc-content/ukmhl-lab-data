19 OBJECTS AND RESULTS OF COOKERY cookery, and all cookery whatsoever, requires in the first place soiincl materials costing money, and such only are worth the trouble of cooking and expense of the fire; ‘ scraps ’ are accidents to be taken care of, no doubt, but the very last objects on which to bestow either expense or labour, or on which to waste words in cookery-books or elsewhere. Let no one think that the danger of these errors is small, for now they have crept into public schools, and are taught systematically. I quote from an article ‘ On Housekeeping Schools,’ by Mrs., now Lady, Priestley, in No. 188 of the Nineteenth Century BevieiVi October, 1892, p. 659, the following experience : ‘ Being curious to know how simple cookery was taught in our Board Schools, I dropped in upon a demonstration class one day, and found the making of “ potato-soup ” and “how to heat up cold meat” on the programme of the day. A girl was singled out to say how potato-soup should be made. The answer was : ‘ “ You must chop up your bones, or cut up your meat, to draw out the nutriment.” ‘ Mistress ; “ Surely there’s a better word than nutriment, isn’t there ?” ‘ Girls : “ Yes, mistress.” And up went all hands. ‘ Mistress : “ What is it, then?” ‘Flavour said one, nourishment ventured another. No one was right, the appropriate word could not be found, and as the situation was becoming embarrassing the mistress had to give the cue, spelling out slowly “ G-o-o-d ” ‘ “ Goodness !” shouted the class triumphantly. ‘ “ Yes, goodness; to draw the goodness out of the bones, that’s an easier word, isn’t it?” ‘ “ Yes, mistress.” ‘ “ Well, then, we chop up our bones to draw the ” ‘ “ Goodness out,” echoed the class.

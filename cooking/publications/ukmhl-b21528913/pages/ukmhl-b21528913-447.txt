TARTS, TIES, AND MINCE-PIES 419 might be a meat tart properly so called, if only it were arranged upon the Roman pattern of the iorla of a twisted ring of pastry outside, as the container of a ragout inside the ring, the ragout being the contained. Persons of dis- cerning taste should strive to dissociate all crusts whatever from fruit as well as meat during their preparation, and cook all three by themselves, uniting them only shortly before or during the meal. Mince Pics as now commonly made are tarts and tartlets of puff or short paste, laid in moulds, covered or open, and containing suitable quantities of mincemeat. By the practice of subdivision, they belong to the category of small pastry rather than to cakes and puddings. In their case, the consideration which we have placed before the reader in the previous paragraph concerning the use of the word pie has received rather a contrary illustration, for the cakes connected with mincemeat of this particular kind are called pies, even though they conform to the enlarged definition of tarts. But this is explained by the exceptional position which mincemeat itself holds as a mixture of flesh meat with fruit of several kinds. The original idea of mincemeat as a flesh-food happily still surviving, it was called mince- meat still, even by those who left out the flesh, and trans- formed both title and mince into a delusion. Even they knew that it would be ridiculous to call a mince pie a mince tart, although it revealed the true nature of their nerve- and meaning-less composition. Mince pies, then, are dis- tinguished by containing meat previously roasted and matured by being penetrated with the flavour of fruit and brandy. By the mode of its preparation, and the addition of the brandy, mincemeat becomes capable of being pre- served for a considerable time, and one operation thus suffices to provide the materials for many pies, which can he made during, and at the distance of, several weeks from each other.

36t VEGETABLES PECULIAR TO INDIA young leaves of this plant can also be used as spinach. Young immphins {dil imssuncl), or gourds, gathered when they are of the size of ducks’ eggs, of an age analogous to that of gherkins, may be boiled and served like artichoke bottoms. Purees of sweet potatoes and yams should be accommodated with cream. These tubers may be treated artistically by marinading in brandy and lime-juice, dipping in batter, and frying. Yams are suitable for several forms of treatment which fit potatoes. {Gf. ‘Wyvern,’ loc. cit., pp. 126, 162 et seq.) •CHAPTEE XXIX. VARIETIES OF FLOUR-PASTE USED IN CULINARY / OPERATIONS. The art of manipulating the flour of cereals with various admixtures for the production of several qualities of paste or dough is one of the most important achievements of human ingenuity. Each form of paste is typical—that is to say, different in essential qualities from every other quality. When two types are mixed—e.g., in the brioche, or in waffles, or in krapfen—a compound form is obtained, in which both qualities are expressed in a modified form. The progress from the simplest to the most complicated form is less evident upon the multiplication of materials than by the increase of the manual labour and the skill required in its application. Flour and Suet Fa'-Ae for Meat Puddings and others is apparently easy to produce, but many cooks fail in appre- ciating the necessity of adapting details of proportion to the special object which the paste is to serve. As the paste is mostly boiled, a larger proportion of suet than demanded by the standard is not so injurious as an excess of flour.

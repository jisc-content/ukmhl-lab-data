331 PEAS AND CHICK PEAS Gi'avy. Fried Asparagus involves the upper two inches, or less, which are boiled, egged, crumbed, and fried. Several ragouts made with asparagus possess no specific features. Green Peas. G-reen peas, the unripe fruit of Pisiom sativum, contain about 80*5 per cent, of water, 5'75 per cent, of nitro- genized albuminous—to speak strictly, leguoninous—sub- stance, 0-5 per cent, of fat, no sugar, but 10-86 per cent, of other carbo-hydrates, some woody fibre, and 0-8 per cent, of ash. In the ripe peas the water sinks to 14-3 per cent., the leguminous nitrogenized matter rises to 22-63 per cent., and starch and related bodies to 53-24 per cent. The green peas are much more digestible than the ripe in any form. Green peas, plain-boiled and dished with some butter, are termed a VAnglaise, and distinguished from the ste^oed, called d la Franqaise. The latter require some bouillon, a little sugar, and a roux; the binding must be added sparingly, as when properly treated young peas effect their own binding spontaneously. Chicle peas, or Spanish garhanzos, are apparently not often eaten in the green state. Sugar Peas is a form of peas of which the shells are edible, and very sweet, at a period when there is hardly any seed developed as yet. These shells are stewed just like the young green peas, and are very tasty; they become stringy when older, and then have to be sucked or drawn through the teeth singly by the eater, or worked into pur6e by the cook. Maoroiv-fats are a late variety of peas of great size and tender substance. China chilo is a ragoiit of green peas and mutton, stewed with some onions, lettuce, butter, and spices, to be served with rice boiled in broth and moistened with butter. This is a most excellent dish, and is most conveniently eaten with a dessertspoon.

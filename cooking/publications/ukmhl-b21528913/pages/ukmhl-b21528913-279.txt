251 DERIVED SAUCES includes a pandemonium of herbs and onions. In genuine French parlance ravigote means a sauce made of certain aromatic herbs; it is derived from the verb ravigoter, to revive, to regain one’s strength. Thus, any sauce made of refreshing green fine herbs would be a ravigote. If these herbs were pounded and incorporated with butter, the pro- duct would be a fourth variation, ravigote butter, and the addition of such to other sauces may entitle them to be termed co^npoicncl ravigote sauces. The herbs to be used in all ravigotes are chervil, parsley, tarragon, chives, garden cress, celery, balm, and, for green ravigote, spinach. Only Dubois has onion in his modification, which is, however, warm ; while of the others one is cold, and passes with that adjective. As it is mayonnaise to which some ravigote has been added, it should be termed mayonnaise ravigotde, or green mayonnaise, jhcrora Saxice is bechamel with a leason of egg-yolk. The latter should be of the orange colour of black Spanish fowl eggs. This sauce has two variations, determined by details of no importance. Maitre d’Hotel Sauces. The surname of h la Maitre d’Hdtel is applied to several preparations which must be kept distinct. The first is Maitre d'Hotel Bictter or Gold Maitre d’Hdtel Sauce, which consists of butter mixed with parsley, lemon-juice, salt, and nutmeg. When this butter is gently warmed, and by stirring made to assume the consistency of cream, it becomes Maitre d Hotel Sauce. When the butter is incorporated over the fire with an equal weight of bechamel sauce, we obtain Compound Maitre d’Hotel Sauce. When the incorporation of the butter is made with veloutd, we obtain the Maitre d Hdtel Sauce lice. Made with espagnole it was dedicated to Chateaubriand, when the French under his Ministry invaded Spain in 1823.

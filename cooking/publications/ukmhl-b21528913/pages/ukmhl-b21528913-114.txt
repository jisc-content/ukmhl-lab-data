86 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY has the great recommendation that it is much less costly than a diet including meat as a mainstay; on the other hand, it has the disadvantage to be physiologically incom- plete, and therefore incapable of bringing the human body to the highest climax of its physical development, or keeping it in the possession of its full strength. While vegetarianism, like the former clerical prohibition of meat, might have extended somewhat the practice of vegetable cookery, and thus advanced it a little, it has confined itself to importing into its peculiar literature a number of terms taken from ordinary cookery, and misapplied to counter- feits* which cannot be to its credit. By a careful scrutiny of vegetarian literature, we have convinced ourselves that its recipes are, without exception, extracted from ordinary current cookery-books ; in no particular have we observed any advance, and nowhere any addition as the result of independent study or experiment. The alleged ethical motives for the avoidance of flesh food have not led to cesthetical substitutes, but only to the adoption of cheap makeshifts, which can never supplant the products of rational cookery.

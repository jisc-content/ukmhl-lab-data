They have probably a history of more than a thousand years, their name being supposed to be a con- tracted derivate of Merovingians, the family name of the imperial house which was superseded on the throne of Franconia by the Karolingians, thus indicating the time at which they were invented. Meringues can be made of two varieties, according to whether any starch is put into the preparation or not; incidentally to such addition, the proportions of the main ingredients, white of egg and sugar, have to be altered; the addition of starch assimilates the preparation somewhat to sponge or Savoy cake.

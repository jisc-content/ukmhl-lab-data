388 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY Macaroni and Nouilles, or Nudeln. While all Italy may be called the home of the macaroni, they are particularly well made at Naples from so-called Black Sea wheat, and prepared in many different ways, in soups, au (jratin, as timbales, always accompanied with Parmesan cheese. The mass of the population of Naples lives upon macaroni, figs, garlic, and iced water. Macaroni can be made of wheat-flour only; this is made into a stiff paste, and triturated under heavy rolling stones; when the paste is finished it is pressed through cylinders, and shaped either into bands or the well-known tubes. Macaroni are eaten boiled with butter, cheese, and other garnishes. The first boiling should be carried only so far as is necessary to swell and soften them (che cresca in cori>o), and should be done in loater; the second boiling, to com- pletion of the coction, should be done in broth or 7nilk, care to be taken not to overboil them and make them mashy and shapeless. We abstain from recording the numerous pre- parations of macaroni, which are all governed by a few principles. The twibales of the gratinatecl macaroni are all exquisite dishes; the macaroni harmonize with brown butter, Swiss or Italian cheese, tomatoes, bechamel, and other sauce, and are always easily digested; care to be taken in the gratination of macaroni. The colouring of cheese in the oven has the advantage that it enhances its taste and savour; in this respect it resembles the osinazome of 7neat, which by browning, that is to say, by the abstrac- tion of water under the influence of heat—caranielization— also assumes a greater influence on the gustatory nerves. But the moment the limit of this action is overstepped, the cheese or its browned product assumes a bitter, repellent taste, and is the reverse of savoury. For this reason pre- parations of cheese should never bo deeply browned. Nouilles, or Nudeln, or German x><^ste, are a preparation

185 BISQUE OR CRAYFISH SOUP siz6 of prawns. But it must be remembered that of these stone, crayfish fifty would be equalled in weight by twenty- five so-called noble crayfish {Edelkrehse in German), and yield soup for eight persons. To produce bisque, from four to six crayfish of the larger size are required—of the smaller variety, about a dozen—for each person. After having killed them by skewering, remove the gut from each of them by holding the fish in the left hand, and with the right thumb and forefinger pulling out the central paddle of the tail; to this the gut will adhere. Put the crayfish in a stewpan, add a mirepoix of finely- sliced roots and a bouquet of herbs, pepper, and pimento as tincture, 2 oz. of butter, a glassful of Madeira or Marsala wine, cover with standard broth, and add sufficient thereof to make the fish swim. Boil while stirring until the cray- fish are all red. Let cool, and pick out the crayfish while running the broth into a saucepan. Eemove the meat from the tails, and cut it into dice and set it aside. Pound all the carapaces, tail-sheaths, and claws included, together with six anchovies, some bread fried in butter, and some wine or spirit to dissolve the colour ; add the liquid in which they have been boiled, and boil again while stirring. Boil (to fifty crayfish) 125 grm. of rice, until it forms a thin paste ; add this to the boiled pounded carapaces, insure the suffi- cient liquidity of the mixture by the addition of broth if necessary, and pass through a tammy. Add a piece of butter to the puree, and keep it hot in the water-bath. Brown some thin slices or dice of bread in butter, and place them, together with the dice of the meat of the tails, in the soup-tureen, and pour the soup over them.

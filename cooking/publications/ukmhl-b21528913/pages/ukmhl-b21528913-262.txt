234 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY heat and to impart an agreeable flavour. Then dilute with standard broth and use for its purpose. A thickening for sauces is described by Gouffe under the name of Liaison b, VAllemande; this name, as its author himself admits, is confusing, the material having no con- nection with allemande sauce, but being mere flour-paste made with water, bouillon, or milk, and thezâ€™efore differing greatly from a well-made dextrine thickening, or white roux, which not only contains butter, but holds the flour in a state of transformation. It is this flour-paste which has injured sauces in the estimation of the public, and we advise our readers to avoid the liaison h VAllemande and the velouU bourgeois produced therewith, and to adopt in all cases the flour dextrine thickening above described. A thickening of yolk of eggs is applied not only to sauces, but also to soups, blanquettes, and fricassees of chicken. For the incorporation of such a liaison with a sauce, the latter must be withdrawn from the fire, and allowed to cool some- what. Then a small portion of the sauce must be mixed very gradually with the yolks, and the small addition repeated until the liaison is very hquid and well mixed, and then only is it returned to the body of the sauce; the latter is then heated with constant stirring to near, but not actually to, boiling. There is also a more rarely used mode of thickening broivn saiices loith blood of fowls or game; in such a case the blood is treated as the yolks are treated in the process just described. The so-called liaison with butter and with mixtures of butter and cream are not true thickenings, but enrichments intended mainly for the enhancement of the taste. When they are employed with soups, it is mostly done to hide their want of savour. Cooks should avoid introducing con- cealed forms of fat into dishes needlessly, as they may prejudice physiological nutrition.

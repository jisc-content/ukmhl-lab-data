THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 430 The feet of oxen, which, like those of cows, go under the description of cozu’s heels, are boiled and eaten by fre- quenters of tripe-shops. French cooks make an accom- plished dish of them. Ox-heart is a favourite dish of some, but is rather of a pronounced taste, and very solid. The sioeetbread, or pancreas, of the ox, goes along with those of cows and calves to serve for the production of entrees. This part has become absurdly dear in large towns. Of steaks, three varieties are distinguished—one, prime, called rumpsteak; the second quality, called beefsteak, coming from a lower part; the third variety is a cross-cut from the under-cut, or fillet; it has not the quality of rump or beef steak, but is more easily prepared in a tender state. The blood of the ox is not used for any preparation of food. Beef is best in winter, because it can be hung up as long as may be necessary to make it perfectly tender. The action of air upon beef, as upon all meat which has not been cooked or frozen, is the same as that which it exercises in the living body; oxygen is absorbed, and carbonic acid exhaled. Concurrently, a certain amount of lactic acid forms in the meat, which during the subsequent cooking dissolves or softens the tendinous, fibrous, or tough parts. If the meat be intended for boiling, it may, while hung, be rubbed over with a little salt from time to time. Kernels so called, being lymphatic glands, should be cut out, and the cavities salted; joints also should be cut into and salted. In warm weather, hung meat must be examined and rubbed over its surface with a dry, clean cloth daily; by this practice the bacteria of excessive change are so kept under and hindered in their growth and multiphcation that they cannot affect the interior of the meat. The ox furnishes a delicious fat from the proximity of

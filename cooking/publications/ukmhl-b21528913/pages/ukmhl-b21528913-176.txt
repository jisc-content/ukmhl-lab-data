THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 14S removal of all or most of the meat useful for cooking can furnish but little useful broth. Further, all such kinds of true broth are very expensive, seeing that the edible part of a fowl or chicken costs on an average 2s. to 2s. 6d. the pound, all bones and offal deducted. And as all cooks are constantly constrained by the remonstrances of their masters against high expenditure to produce tasty things at the least cost, the expensive and refined broths do not often have an opportunity to come up to our standard. Seeing how good and cheap are the extracts of the flesh of kine and sheep, the absence of rarer fumets is no great depriva- tion to society at large, and the most savoury dishes remain open to the likings of the proprietors of the most economical kitchens at a reasonable expenditure of money and skill. Application of Broths for the Production of Soup. From broths, as described in the foregoing, to sou2)s, is so small a step in transition, consisting mainly in dilution, that in culinary works many recipes for mere broth are headed as recipes for clear soiq). To recite any of them would be a useless repetition, as they contain unaltered all the virtues and faults, particularly as to bones, which have been fully discussed above. As regards soups, we shall offer a classification upon the basis of their characteristic ingredients, and shall take care to carry through a practical nomenclature. For in this chapter of soups the abuse or misuse of names is even greater than that which prevails in respect of other culinary productions. Not only are well-established names of original soups taken away from them, but they are applied to others, sometimes several in succession, which have no character in common with that which originally received the name. This is well proved, c.g., by the case of Brunoise soup. True soup of that name requires as an essential ingredient of lentils, and we should therefore ho-ve to

Pickled Pork in small pieces (the petit saU of the French, Solp>er of the Germans) is a favourite dish with an ancient history. The Boman Emperor Claudius entered the Senate one day and called out: ‘ Con- script fathers, is it possible to live without pork pickled in slices ?’ And the venerable fathers replied at once : ‘ Oh, sir, it is better to die than to have to live without salt pork !’ Ham admits of many different excellent modes of pre- paration, which we cannot discuss in detail.

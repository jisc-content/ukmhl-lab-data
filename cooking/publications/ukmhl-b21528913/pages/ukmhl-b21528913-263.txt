235 GRAND SAUCES General or Stock Sauces, also called Grand Sauces. The general sauces, cmdis gdndraux, stock saioces, are by some French authors also called grand sauces, meaning that they are made in bulk, and then modified {travailU) for particular purposes. The French author Courchamps has misapprehended this expression, and believing it to be a symbol of the high quality of a sauce, has claimed that a certain brown sauce, which he particularly favours and thinks the best of all sauces, should alone be termed grand sauce, and that mere espagnole should not be identified with it. This proposition hardly requires any discussion, but seems condemned by culinary history no less than by common practice.

The same definition clearly is applicable to the adjective grand in connection with the general or grand aspic, as it is termed in the French kitchen, namely, a savoury broth- jelly which may be further transformed either into stock sauces, or into real aspics, or jellies, or added to ragouts, fricassees, and soups. It is made in so concentrated a form that it might be called essence of aspic, and assume the position of a glaise; it is prepared just like the best broths and coulis, with the addition of an ounce of gelatine to the pint of solution; it is generally made clear, and clarified with white of egg in the same manner as is described above for soups. From this general aspic a few simple sauces are derived, namely, clear tarragon sauce and plain aspic sauce. All sauces except Dutch sauce having broth as the essential basis of their savour, and such broth not differ- ing from the standards which we have laid down in con- nection with soups, it is not necessary to describe the mode

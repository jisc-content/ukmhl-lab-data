4o2 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY flavoured sugar, or sugar mixed with fruit-juice; Biscuits d r Urstiline are made of biscuit paste mixed with rice, and apple or apricot jam, and grilled orange-flower. A number of preparations are also called Biscuits Soufflds somewhat improperly—e.g., the biscuits SotojffUs aux Ainandes, d la Fleur cV Or anger, and the Biscuits d la Mere Jeanne—but they differ from true biscuits in their essential properties. The refined Portuguese bake an excellent biscuit cake which they term d’otcro, golden bread ; they do not cut it, but the lady or daughter of the house breaks it with her fingers.

In Plum Cake the rich floury basis of cake almost dis- appears, or is overtoned entirely by the addition of a largo amount of raisins, both sultanas and muscatels stoned, currants, dried cherries, pounded almozids, minced mixed candied peel, and spices. The body of the cake is thus

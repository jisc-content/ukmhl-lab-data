4i6 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY paste, and its specificity as to fruit is that its cavity within the torta is filled with cooked slicad apricots, covered over with ajjricot jam used as a mortar. Such a tart may be made with any sort of fruit which can be stewed so as to preserve its shape, and be made into jam also; probably apples are ideally qualified in this respect, and stand next to apricots in usefulness. The tart may be covered with a lid of puff paste, and then is what some French books term a D'Artois of Apiricots, an absurd slavish misnomer for covered apricot tart. A more simple covered tart of apples and apricots is called a turnover, the apples and jam being enclosed between two layers of tart paste. Plums, if not too juicy, and their jam, are suitable to be enclosed in turnovers; these forms of fruit pie are very popular amongst young people. Darioles belong to the patisserie dâ€™entremets; they are little shallow cups of puff paste filled with a compound cream or custard; they are therefore thus far identical with fanchonettes, but do not rise to the complication of the latter, there being no meringue paste garnish, and no top of ornamentation. There was also a difference formerly do ricjuezor, now neglected; the creams of the fanchonettes were white, those of the darioles yellow. On the whole, we may term darioles the simple form or beginning of fanchonettes, and these latter compound darioles, to establish a com- parative definition of both. Both should retain their ancient names. There are some variations of darioles worthy of notice, such as with orange flavour, called a la Duchesse, and with coffee flavour, but they are unimportant. When, however, the custard of darioles receives an addition of cheese of any kind, fresh or ripe, the product assumes a new special name, that of Talmouse. No ratafias are added to such, while they are added to cheese cakes; on the other hand.

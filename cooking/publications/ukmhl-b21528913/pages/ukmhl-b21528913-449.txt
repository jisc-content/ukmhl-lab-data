421 THE PHILOSOPHY OF PUDDINGS —c.<7., hlach pudding. Paddings are mostly cooked by boiling or steaming, more rarely by baking. Thus, of some thirty odd puddings which we have compared, only four—Somer- setshire pudding, plain bread pudding, Bakewell pudding, and lemon pudding—are baked; the remainder, with the variations nearly thirty dishes, are all boiled. Puddings resemble so^offlds in this, that their substance is to a large extent already cooked before it is placed into the composition which fills the shape. The materials which are thus frequently used are bread, white and brown, Italian pastes, brioche, Savoy or sponge cake (biscuit), macroons, and ratafias. The contents of boiled puddings surrounded with a case of suet dough—such as fruit (apples) or meat {e.g., mutton)—are cooked, at least partly, before being placed into the capsule. A few puddings, however, are compounded directly from elementary cooking materials—e.g., Somersetshire puddings. A so-called Yorkshire pudding—such as is eaten with meat —is also made directly and baked; but these are exceptional compositions amongst puddings. Indeed, a pudding is mostly, if we may be allowed to use an expression from petrology, a breccia—a compound formed of fragments of a material which had a previous independent existence, and bound together by a soft mortar or cement which was able to penetrate and fill the pores of, and intervals between, the lumps, and then become set by the culinary thermic process. It is by this that pudding becomes a unity, and receives a kind of gustatory homogeneity, however numerous and diversified may be the substances introduced into its con- stitution. Puddings should not be hard, or even too solid, but easily comminuted or squashed. The boiled cabinet gmdding, a distinctly English invention, is the very ideal of a confection of this kind.

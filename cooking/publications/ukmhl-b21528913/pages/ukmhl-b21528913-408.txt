38o THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY and is then cut off and weighed in proper quantities to be made up into loaves. They are then put in the oven at an initial heat of the latter of from 400° to 450° Fahr., and then heated for about one and a half hours. The temperature of the bread rises but little, and only on its outside—the crust—above the temperature of boiling water. If so-called pressed, manufactured German yeast be em- ployed to raise the sponge, from 6 to 7 lb. to the sack of flour are required (or 0-4 oz., or 175 grs., to the pound of flour). This pressed yeast acts very rapidly, and therefore serves particularly for the production of very white bread, fancy bread, and rolls. It is a common report amongst the public that bakers add potatoes to bread-dough for the purpose of cheapen- ing its production, to their own advantage, by this admix- ture of less valuable material; this is entirely erroneous, and the addition of potatoes is limited to their perfectly legitimate use for the production of the ferment above described. The tests of good bread are that it should have a flinty, light-brown crust, should crack on application of a fracturing force; its crumb or the whole loaf should rise again when compressed to a moderate degree; it should be spongy on fracture, and the bubbles of the sponge should be uniform in size; it should be white in colour, agreeable in smell and taste, sweet and nutty. Paniflcation, then, consists in the transformation by ferments of starchy and albuminous matters, the induction of an alcoholic fermentation of sugar contained or produced in, or added to, the dough, the evolution of carbonic acid gas, of which much escapes, while enough is retained to impart to the dough ultimately a porous, spongy condition ; in this state it is kept by the viscid gluten; the condition is made permanent by heat, and bread is the result. The starch in bread is partly soluble as starch or as

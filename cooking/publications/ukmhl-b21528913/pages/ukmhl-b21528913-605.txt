577 CHARTREUSES, VARIOUS FORMS observe days of abstinence from meat, or abstain from it altogether, as the so-called vegetarians. For these certainly the grande chartreuse, the most accomplished of hot vege- table combinations, ought to be a comforting consideration, and even its contemplation, preliminary to its consumption, ought to assist in the assertion of their propositions on account of its monumental aspect. A chartreuse can be perfect only during the months of May to August inclusive, inasmuch as the vegetables necessary for its production are only then in the desired state of growth and tenderness. At any other time of the year its perfec- tion will be opposed by the seasons, the effects of which cannot here be overcome by processes of preservation, so useful for other purposes. But of course substitutions can do much to make up for deficiencies, even if they imply the abandonment of some of the fundamental demands of the definition. For there are several ways of observing the fast- days so called, the jours maigres of the French, the absolute non-compromising rule, which excludes milk, eggs, broth, and similar derivates, and the less rigorous interpretation, by which these viands of animal origin are considered as not satisfying the definition of flesh food, and are therefore permitted. The definition of grande chartreuse by Careme was so stringent that it excluded even that first widening of the appellation by which it was made to include so-called entrees made with fruit, such as apples. But he allowed the introduction into chartreuses simply so called, which might be assumed to constitute a variety, for the sake of distinction, of parts of fish and shellfish. When thus a cavity was once made in the structure of the chartreuse this apparail quickly became a raised pie, or pcite-chaud, the case of which only consisted of the legitimate green vege- tables and roots, while the contents were the most ordinary meat entrees and ragouts, such as Carthusians would neces-* 37

THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 2o6 dish is, therefore, a ragout only, and not used as a soup in the locality. Ravioli, or Babioles, are an Italian dish, consisting of little shells or capsules of thin nouilles paste in which a savoury meat farce is enclosed. They are boiled in broth, and served with brown gravy, as an entree, particularly to open a dejeuner without soup, as is practised in Italy. When they are made small, and immersed in a sufficiency of broth, they pass as quenelles in Ravioli sotip {Raviolis a la Napolitaine*). The preparation of the shells is given under ‘Nouilles.’ The farce is prepared from fowl, game, veal, etc. ; add thereto some fresh-made curd of milk and some Parma cheese, also some spinach, parboiled, spices an salt, and bind with yolk of egg. The farce is enclosed in pieces of paste of about 4 inches surface each, then warmed on a baking-tin in the oven, immersed in boiling broth—to be quickly scalded, so that the broth cannot affect the farce —boiled for from five to fifteen minutes, according to size, and removed and drained. Some gratinate the ravioli, with Parma cheese, and butter poured over it. This treat- ment we cannot, from experience, approve of; the cheese becomes adhesive, and spoils the unity of the taste of the farce. A concentrated hroivn gravy is the best sauce to go with ravioli as entree. If they are to be eaten as soup send a tureen of clear gravy with them. Ox-kidney Soup is really an expanded ragout.

Thus it became the object of the fable that its preparation in 1806 had cost three louis d’or for each diner or person at table. This romance was destroyed by Baron Brisse, who gave a copy of the recipe to Dumas in a letter, in which this * Cf. F., 375 ; Gouflfe, p. 372. For soup only, a poor recipe. Of. D.D., 922.

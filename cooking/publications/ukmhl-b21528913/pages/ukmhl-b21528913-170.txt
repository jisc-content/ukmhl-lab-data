THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 142 opiniou by, had a share in this change. Thus Brillat- Savarin wrote that bouilli was a wholesome, digestible nutriment, but of small restorative power, as it had lost some of the animalizabh juices by boiling. He describes four categories of benighted persons who eat bouilli, while professors (of the physiology of taste, we suppose) never eat it, because it is flesh without its jidce. The assertion that a wholesome, digestible nutriment possessed small restora- tive power would be physiologically speaking untenable. But what the writer meant by restorative power was not the mere food-value, but the value of the pleasure of the good taste of the morsel as well. As applicable to the result of Gouff^’s recipes we agree with Savarin, and advise our readers to supplant these recipes by better ones. Instantaneous Broths, or Bouillon a la Minute. The same author, Gouff6, who has given such elaborate directions for the “pot-au-fev,, brings under the chapter on soups (p. 51) a recipe for instantaneous broth, or Bouillon a la Mimote, which is in so far phenomenal, as it accom- plishes, not in a minute or instantaneously, but in twenty minutes or half an hour, what other recipes do in four or five hours only—e.cj., in cases of illness—where, as Gouffe says, expense is a secondary question. Cut up 1 lb. kilo) of very lean beef (gravy-beef) and half a boned chicken; pound all V7ell, put it into a casserole with 10 grs. of salt, pour over it 1^ litre, or 3 pints, of water, and heat to boiling while stirring. As soon as the boiling has commenced, add shred carrots, turnips, onions, leeks, and celery ; boil for twenty minutes, and pass through a cloth. This is a perfectly rational proceeding : bones are omitted, fat is excluded, the meat is comminuted and per- fectly exhausted, the boiling is confined to twenty minutes. This is, indeed, the process to be applied for the production of broth of unvarying strength. If the beef be omitted,

174 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY ideal, and of which the human body stands so much in need. There are several obstacles to the general and frequent use of leguminous seeds, particularly in soups. In the first place, they require long and careful preparation before being cooked, as well as during the cooking. Thus, peas and haricot beans require to be soaked in pure water— distilled water is the best; pure rain-water comes next; soft natural water in the third, water made soft by the addition of some carbonate of soda in the fourth place. Hard water of every kind, i.e., water containing either carbonate or sulphate of lime in solution, is injurious to the seeds; for, as the lime-salt combines with some of the ingredients of the seeds, it makes the seeds hard: they are not sufficiently softened by boiling, and remain indigestible to a large extent. Against this accident the transformation into puree is only a partial defence, for it is adopted probably only in regions in which the precaution of the necessary soaking in soft water would also be taken; the lower classes, who have most need of substantial physiological cookery and nutrition, do not generally understand or obey the injunc- tions as regards soft water, or have no means of obeying them. Moreover, the length of time required to cook the seeds is to them objectionable, and they therefore prefer bread, bacon, steak, and cheese to soups. Pease are eaten by the lower classes of towns in quantity, as pease-pudding so called, which they buy ready made in the cook-shop, a portion, wrapped in paper, for a penny. Leguminous soups are distributed in soup-kitchens over which intelhgent charity keeps control. The forms of soup of leguminous seeds which can be made, or are more commonly made, are collected in the following titles : Plain Green Pea Sottj), Soup of Ptule of Gi’een Peas, Soup of Purde of Green Peas for Fast Days, Gompoxind Green Pea Soup, Compound Green Pea Soup with Custard,

THE SPIRIT OF COOHERi 294 CHAPTER XXII. FARCE, OR FORCEMEAT, FOR STUFFINGS ; QUENELLES AND GRATINS, GODIVEAUS. Farce is a French culinary expression, derived from the Latin farsum, for a mixture of minced or pounded meat, fat, bread, and spice, or, the bread being omitted, for sausage-meat only (farcimcn, sausage), or for farinaceous egg-bound preparations, to be used for stuffing birds to be boiled or roasted, or filling raised pies, or the hollows of hard-boiled eggs after removal of the yolks, or for serving as material for gratins. The English forcemeat is derived from the French viande farcee, but for forcemeat balls the^ French use the expression boulettcs de hachis. Forcemeat is prepared of different qualities, according to the applica- tion for which it is intended. Thus, for filling raised pies entirely or in part, it is not made of such select material, and not reduced to such fineness as for the production of quenelles, which require the greatest comminution; on the other hand, stuffings and gratins permit of a greater ad- mixture of egg and panade than quenelles, and the more savoury the pie is to be, the more its contents must be confined to fleshy and fatty ingredients. The name of (juenelles is confined to small forcemeat balls given with soups or ragouts. We believe the word not to be very current in French kitchens. In Germany its equivalent is kneffs, which seems derived from the Greek kuesma. The varieties of forcemeat are many, and those most com- monly prepared are made of veal for balls, of veal and iwrk mixed, of veal or foiol with calf’s liver, or (variation) fowl’s liver; forcemeat for cold pasties is mainly composed of veal and pork, well flavoured and spiced ; of fowl's flesh.

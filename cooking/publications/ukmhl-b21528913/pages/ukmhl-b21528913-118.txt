90 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY probably in the hands of the Arabs. Amongst the booty which Alaric took from Eome* were three thousand pounds of pepper. After the conquest of the East by the Turks spices became much more scarce in Europe. Thus, in 1263 Oriental spices were rare in France, for in that year the Abbey of St. Gilles in Languedoc made a present of some horns (cornets) of spice (cinnamon) to Louis le Jeune, of whom they were about to ask a great favour. That spices were highly valued as additions to food follows from the practice which took ground at the same time of terming presents made to judges, of course as bribes, spices. Spices became more accessible and more widely dis- tributed after the discovery of America by Columbus, and the route to India by Vasco de Gama. This was particu- larly the case with cinnamon, of which the Portuguese for a long time held a monopoly, and Lisbon became the centre of the trade in that bark. The Portuguese also first made cloves common throughout Europe. These had been known at Eome at the time of Pliny only as curiosities, and used for perfumes, but not then as spices in combination with food. In the Middle Ages, and down to and through the period of renaissance, spices were used for the production of sauces to be eaten with meat. But cinnamon, the principal ingredient of these sauces, has for many generations been confined to the spicing of sweet dishes, and been almost entirely excluded from savoury compositions. The principal spices of the cameline sauce (probably a corruption from cannelline sauce), of which the corporation of the sauciers of Paris obtained a monopoly, about 1494, under Louis XII., were cinnamon, cloves, grains of Paradise, bread, and vinegar. Of the sauce called gence, ginger was the prevailing flavour, with almonds, verjuice, and wine. * Cf. Herat and Delens, ‘Diet. Mat. Med.,’ Poivre, vol. iii., p. .510.

THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 466 A Dunelm of Mutton, or Royal Haggis, is a mince in pudding form, consisting of minced leg of mutton, suet, breadcrumb, eggs, anchovies, spices, mushrooms, and red wine. We think the wine objectionable. The mince is enclosed in a caul, and baked in a sautapan in a quick oven. Haggis, or Scotch Haggis, is a mince (hachis) in pudding form also, and is termed by the poet Burns ‘ great chief- tain o’ the pudding race.’ Some have not improperly classed it amongst the sausages, of v/hich its nearest analogues are German liver sausage and brawn, called Schwarte - Magen. Haggis may be made of mutton or lamb; that is to say, their draught or pluck, comprising the liver, heart, sweetbread, and, according to some, the midriff, middle rib, i.e., between ribs or diaphragm. These par. boiled minced and grated materials, mixed with fat, bread, or flour, properly spiced, are enclosed in the soaked, cleansed, and scraped fourth stomach of the animal, not too tightly, so as to admit of some expansion, and boiled for three hours. Haggis is a dish of which it is said that South Britons, going North, eat once to satisfy curiosity, but never again. This small repute has yet been diminished by a humorist who had heard that a certain (badly made) haggis, on being cut into at table, had squirted some of its contents over part of the company ; in this case air had evidently been included, and not been allowed to escape through the pricks prescribed to be inflicted upon the bag.

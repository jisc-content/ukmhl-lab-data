THE HISTORIC LITERATURE OF COOKERY 35 The latter was a Parisian restaurateur, and lived from 1754 to 1820. He had very great influence in purifying culinary recipes, and shaping the practice by the introduction of exactness and method in the main, as regards French cookery such as we know it. Brillat-Savarin in his ‘ Physiologie du Gout,’ p. 289, has given an interesting memoir of the character and career of Beauvilliers, which we recommend’ our readers to peruse. The first edition of Beauvilliers’ ‘ L’Art du Cuisinier ’ was published in 1814, and the work was republished many times, but, though altered and enlarged, not improved after the death of its author.

The one, ‘ Le Cuisinier Moderne,’ is by Vincent La Chapelle, chef de cuisine to the Prince of Orange and Nassau (second edition, Hague, 1742). It is a beautifully written, exhaustive treatise, in five octavo volumes, full of information and instruction. In his pre- face the author exposes a plagiarism on the part of the editor of a new issue of a work which we have quoted above, note p. 32, as the ‘ Cuisinier Eoyal et Bourgeois,' to which now, however, the name and title of ‘ La Chapelle ’ were fraudulently prefixed. The other work, published re- peatedly at Paris (we have the edition of 1758 before us, but it is not stated what place it takes in the series of editions) in three largo duodecimo volumes, of together more than 1,200 pages, is entitled ‘ Les Dons de Comus, ou I’Art de la Cuisine r^duit en Pratique.’ This also is a highly accomplished work, as already indicated by its preface, and fully borne out by its text, and refreshing by its correct historically true nomenclature. In some of its menus the work exhibits a tendency to mannerism, e.g., to dinners and suppers limited to one kind of meat only, tout en boeuf, or veal, or mutton, or even tout

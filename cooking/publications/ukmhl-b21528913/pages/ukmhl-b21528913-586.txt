THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 55S CHAPTEE XLIX. PREPARATIONS OF CRUSTACEANS AND MOLLUSCS, AMPHIBIANS AND REPTILES. Culinary art in its application to crustaceans and molluscs becomes much more restricted than it is in relation to higher animals used for food. Lobster is mostly plain- boiled. After this preparation its meat may receive various additional accommodations, such as a tomato sauce, whereby it h&com&Q d Iâ€™Americaine; or a gratination; or be formed into a boudin, or a cake so called, being a pAte; or it may be formed into guenelles, y^ith. the flavour of different sauces, or with spinach. Tinned lobster is rather coarse, and requires much skill to become tasty. Potted lobster gives a chance to a skilful cook for producing a specialized finished pre- paration. Sea crawfish may be prepared much like lobster. Langos- tinos, or Southern prawns, about fifty to the pound, should be treated like the following. Praiuns and shrimps are distinguished by a very tine savoury taste, which makes them welcome additions to sauces (see Garum, su2Jra), farces, salads, and rehshes of bread and butter of rare effect. To learn their full value, acquire a pailful of prawns of the Isle of Wight, or of the Tagus at Lisbon, and let them be boiled at once and served with, say, tea. Or request the shrimpmonger to bring you a quart of his last boiling while they are hot. To shell them, hold the carapace and part of the tail of the shrimp with the thumb and index tinger of the right hand; with the left hand take hold of the last three joints of the tail, bend it back a little, and pull, when the shell of the tail will come off at the third joint; then lay hold of the flesh of the tail.

PREPARATIONS OF SOLE, PLAICE, FLOUNDER 527 the frying itself will be uneven, and therefore inartistic ; if the fat be not hot, the ‘ surprise ’ will not take place, and the piebald, sodden fish will be an object of pity rather than of gustatory desire. There are a number of other pre- cautions to be observed in the frying of sole, which mostlj' follow out of the general rules. When the sole is fried, protect it from moisture, which makes it sodden, and thus destroys the main feature of a friture, namely, its crispness. Fried Sole admits of various kinds of secondary treat- ment ; it will keep good in a dry larder for several days ; it may be boned or filleted, and warmed in a Dutch oven gradually or immersed in various sauces. Sole au Gratin is an excellent preparation, particularly with mushrooms, and depends for its taste just as much as a roast upon the browned outside and the concentrated gravy. Several variations are pleasing, such as that with brown Italian Sauce, or that d la Mode de Trouville, which latter, however, must be kept modest in the matter of onions and cider. Sole ait Four is stuffed and baked in the oven. Next come the Fillets of Sole, collared, in white sauce, with capers ; fried; in forcemeat au gratin ; braised; scored and broiled; Normandy matelote of soles; the same with tomatoes a I’Americaine; d la Orly (or Horly), and many special adaptations termed after places, such as d la Venitienne, Provengale, Dieppoise, Bouennaise, etc., mostly without specificity. Filets in aspic, as salad, and in mayonnaise, are excellent cold dishes. Plaice, French plie, when quite fresh admits of some preparations like sole, but does not bear braising or gratin- ating without becoming pulpy. It is best filleted and fried, and requires some spice and a good sauce to become an agreeable fare. Flounder, French carrelet, is still more perishable than plaice. Boiled fresh it makes good souchets (souchies).

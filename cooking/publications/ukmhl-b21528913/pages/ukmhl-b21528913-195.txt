167 ITALIAN PASTE SOUPS Sicily and Calabria flourish. Macaroni were brought to France from Italy by some Florentines, probably at the time of the marriage of Catherine of Medicis with Henry II. Their home is Naples, where they are prepared in many different waysâ€”boiled, in soups, au gratin, etc., always accompanied with grated Parmesan cheese; like potatoes or bread, they are on every table, from that of the richest citizen to that of the most humble inhabitant. Macaroni are made from wheat-grits or flour, of which qualities are selected which contain much gluten ; the parts of such grits, of which thirty-four parts require ten to twelve parts of boiling water, are worked vehemently under heavy revolving stones, and upon this working depends much of their quality as regards taste and permanency of shape. The best macaroni are made in Italy, at Naples, Livorno, Genoa, and Turin, and in the Auvergne in France. In the latter country some sorts of macaroni are also made from wheat gluten, obtained in the manufacture of starch ; of this gluten ten parts, flour which need not be rich in gluten thirty parts, and five to six parts of boiling water, are mixed. Macaroni and other sorts of Italian paste contain in the mean 13 per cent, of water, 9 per cent, of nitrogenous matter, 0'25 per cent, of fat, nearly 77 per cent, of starch and matters free from nitrogen, and 0'8 per cent, of ash. From physiological experiments on digestion, it follows that although macaroni are as well digested as bread, yet they are, like bread, not sufficiently rich in nitrogenized substance to serve as a perfect food; during their exclusive use a vigorous, previously well-fed man will lose daily from 6 to 7 grammes of nitrogen furnished by his own tissues. In this respect the French macaroni, to which gluten is added, are a little better, for they offer to the body a greater proportion of nitrogenous matter. The addition of cheese and eggs and of meat fills up the deficiency in ordinary diet.

BOUILLON AND BO UILL I 141 the soup, when it is already in the tureen ready to be served; never add the colouring to the bouillon in the stock-pot, as it becomes disqualified for other purposes. The boiling of the meat is to be continued until it be cooked, which is to be ascertained by probing it with a long needle, or steel skewâ€™er, or fork; the cooking of the small pot is not to exceed four, that of the large five, hours. If the boiling were to be continued beyond this, the broth, it is alleged, would lose in quality. Dietetic Value of Bouillon and Bouilli obtained in these Processes. There can be little doubt that these processes given under the title of not-au-fm were designed more with a view of obtaining a considerable quantity of well-tasting thin broth, made attractive by masses of vegetables and green condi- ments, than that of preparing a well-tasting piece of beef; for the boiling during four hours of lb. of meat in four- fifths of a gallon (8 lb.) of water cannot possibly give an attractive result. The great fault of the recipes, then, is the excess of water in which the relative quantities of meat are to be boiled. If each quantity of meat were boiled in an equal weight of water, a much better result would be obtained as regards the broth as well as the meat. The consequence of this false practice has been that this boiled fresh beef, which the French term botcilli, has fallen into great and entirely undeserved disrepute. Thirty years ago every dinner in a good private house or hotel on the Continent began with soup, and upon this followed the boiled beef; at the present time the boiled beef is rarely met with. No doubt the beef was not always prime, or the meat was from a cow or heifer, and pale and tasteless; but these aberrations detract nothing from the excellent quality of a well-boiled side, or rib, of beef. No doubt also that book-lore, which the travelling public partly forms its

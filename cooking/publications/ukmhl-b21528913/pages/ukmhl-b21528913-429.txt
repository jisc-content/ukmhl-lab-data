401 SAVOY AND BISCUIT CAKES doubt that Bath buns date back to Eoman times, both as to composition and shape, the latter being that of the Latin l)laceiita. Savoy cake is the result of the culture which that land once enjoyed, when its gold-mines assisted the genius of its rulers. But of the name of Compiigue cake, which figures in modern French collections of recipes, we cannot give the raison d’etre, the less so as the current recipes for its production are either mere imitations of brioche and ratan cake, or so unintelligible as to require much technical interpretation. This cake, too, is to be drenched with a liqueur, and stratified with apricot jam after being sliced, a treatment whereby it loses its character as a cake, and becomes, like its companion the false cake described above, a pudding. Biscuits are fine and light pastry composed of eggs, the whites of which are whipped to a snow or froth, with sugar, wheat-flour or potato-starch, or both, and some aromatic or colouring substances which are put into the paste. No fat is added to this paste, except in the case of the French bisctdt manq^ie, and the only fat which they contain is the oil naturally present in the egg-yolk. These cakes must never be baked brown, but remain of a pale-yellow colour. To effect this with certainty, their out- side is protected by a glace of very finely powdered white sugar. If the biscuit be baked in a mould, the latter must be covered with butter or suet fat, and this glaced with the powdered sugar. In the following are enumerated the principal forms of this remarkable pastry: Savoy Cake—Fr. Biscuit de Savoie; Naples Bisczdts or Ladies Fingers—Fr. Biscuits a Cuiller;* Compound Biscuits : Biscuits aux Pistaches, aux Amandes, AveHnes, Noisettes; Biscuits au Chocolat (one part of chocolate to seven parts of sugar); a la Gdnoise, with aniseed flavour, to be cut and toasted j Biscuits d Couper are to be sliced and glaced with * Carfiiue haa ii la Guillert. 26

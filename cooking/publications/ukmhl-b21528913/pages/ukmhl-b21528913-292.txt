264 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY Then put in moulds in cold water and let set. The casein rises to the top; when the jelly is turned out, it occupies the base, and the jelly forms the top stratum. Aspic, a Jelly with Essence of Meat. How this Greek name for a shield, and also for a venomous serpent, came to be applied to a savoury jelly is not yet explained. The jelly, if made without any solid additions, serves as a sauce with cold meat. Such a savoury jelly may, indeed, be given with all cold meat at meals. It moistens and flavours the morsel at the same time. If aspic could be made only according to the recipes of modern cookery-books, beginning with calf’s feet, etc., the frequent use of this preparation would be impracticable. But with normal broth, made by dissolving half an ounce of extract of meat in a pint of water, flavoured as you please with spices and herbs, and half an ounce of German or French gelatine, an aspic is made in a short time of a size sufficient to serve several persons at several meals. The gelatine to be em- ployed must be in thin leaves like paper, quite transparent, and dissolve quickly in the broth without previous soaking in cold water. Its solution in pure water must be quite tasteless. A sufficiently concentrated solution of gelatine in water sets or congeals at a sufficiently low temperature. In warm seasons such congealing does either not take place, or is incomplete or tarries, and has then to be promoted by the influence of a cold atmosphere, or of cold water or of ice. In view of these uncertainties, every cook must test his gela- tine as to its gelatinizing faculty some time before he wants it for actual use, and has to adapt its quantity to the amount of solidity or stiffness which he desires to obtain. The process of setting of a decoction of calf’s feet, etc., resem- bling the process of freezing of water by cold, caused the Italians to term the solidifying solution yelatina, the French

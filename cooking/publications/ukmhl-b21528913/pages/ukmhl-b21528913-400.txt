372 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY Of the constituents of cereals we have to deduct the ivater as inert for nutrition, and the cellulose as in the main indi- gestible hy man. The following are the ingredients serving for nutrition : 1. The Carbo-hydrates.—These are the starches, gums, and sugars. The plurals indicate varieties, e.g., of starch ; for the starch of wheat differs greatly from, e.g., that of barley. 2. The Fats.—These, after eliminating phosphatides, are present in small quantities, except in maize or oats, which are rich in oil. 3. The Phos2>hatides are organic substances containing phosphoric acid and nitrogen ; their compounds and modi- fications are essential constituents of all nuclei of cells, and as such prominent ingredients of brain and nerve tissue and of seeds. Phosphatides in flour are of importance in all the culinary processes to which flour is subject; they are govern- ing ingredients of eg-yolks, as will be more particularly shown under the chapter which treats of eggs. By decom- position they yield neurin, glycero-phosphoric acid, and fatty acids of various kinds. 4. The Albuminoids, or substances similar to albumin, the white of egg, or such as those of which the blood and tissues of animals are constructed. They are termed flesh-formers, while the fats and carbo-hydrates are termed heat-givers. Both probably yield heat as well as mechanical energy by their combustion in the body. 5. The Mineral Matters, or Salts, Alkalies, Earths, and Acids.—These are found as ash on combustion of the organic matter. The carbo-hydrates occurring in cereals are starch and dextrine, cane-sugar (sucrose) and maltose,' dextrose and levulose. They are called carbo-hydrates because in them hydrogen and oxygen are found present in the same pro- portion as in water, and when all this water is deducted

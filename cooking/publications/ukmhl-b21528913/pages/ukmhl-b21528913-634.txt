6o6 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY and mushrooms, cheese is the only source in nature from which those gustatory elements can be drawn which con- stitute savouriness ; this was fully proved by the French physician and chemist Louis Proust, the discoverer of extract of meat, as we have shown above. Cheese is the most valuable animal food obtainable ; it is from two to three times as nutritious as the same money- value of ordinary meat; yet an individual of Konigsberg consumes only 10 grm. per day throughout the year; each head of the Paris population only 9 grm. ; each head of the population of London 16 grm., or half an ounce, daily. Bound Dutch cheese might be used in cookery more fre- quently than it is. As it inclines to be saltish in taste, the latter fault may be eliminated by omitting the salt from the recipe selected (‘ Wyvern,’ he. cit., p. 230). Dutch cheese is also easily grated, and little inclined to mouldiness ; but while it is no doubt a little cheaper than Cheddar or Gloucester when absolute weights only are compared, it is also more watery and less flavoured, and thus the advantages of a lesser price are neutralized. A rich ripe cheese can rarely be used in cookery, but for the production of the fingers or straws of cheese {vide infra) almost any kind of cheese, green Stilton, Gorgonzola (some- times called Stracchino), can be used ; even Boquefort cheese made from ewe’s milk is applicable. Welsh Babbit may be defined as Cheese-toast. The name of this excellent dish is at present unexplained ; it may be Gaelic, and have originated in Wales. The conjecture accord- ing to which the name rabbit was a corruption of rare bit has no kind of probability in its favour. It deserves to be men- tioned that, according to ‘ Wyvern,’ native Hindoo cooks term Welsh rabbit Bamakin Toast, a correct if easy result of appreciation of analogy. There are plainer and more com- pound forms of Welsh rabbit; one of the latter goes by the

THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 230 which the people took home to flavour their ragouts. They were distinct from the merchants who sold cooked meat. Later on the sauciers were called vinaigriers, or moutar- cliers, and by a patent of Louis XII. their business was in 1614 raised to the rank of metier. In these statutes the sauces gence and cameline are mentioned; the sellers were only to sell their own manufactures, and were to produce them as follows : Gence (to be eaten with roast meat), from almonds, wine, ginger, and verjuice; cameline (to be eaten with fried fish), from cinnamon, cloves, paradise grains, bread, and vinegar. These sauces were said to have been invented by Villustrissime sieur de Taillevant, maitre queux des rois Charles V. et Charles VI. It is not impossible that cameline is a corruption from cannelline, from cannelle, cin- namon. Mustard, moiitarde, from mustum, m%cst, the powder of sinapis-seed, obtained its name from the employment of must in its preparation. Court bouillon is an extract prepared by braising a collection of all available stock or bouillon vegetables in butter, evaporating down to a concentrated state for colour, adding a large volume of wine, and boiling up. This is to be used in small portions as an addition to-sauces. Salt-water used' to be a special preparation. Sea-salt as formerly much used being sometimes impure, mainly from dust, was dissolved in water, boiled and skimmed; French cooks also flavoured it to boil fish therein. Verjuice, Fr. verjus, is the expressed juice of unripe grapes ; it may be used like lemon-juice, but possesses no advantages over it; it may be useful now and then when lemons are not available, during July, August, and Sep- tember, in grape-growing countries. Zest of lemon is all that part of the peel or rind which can be removed by grating the yellow layer of cells filled with essential oil.

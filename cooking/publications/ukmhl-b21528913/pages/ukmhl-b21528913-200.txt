THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 172 Soups made witli Potatoes, Cassava, Tapioca. General Observations.—Soup may be made from potatoes directly after they have been boiled or during their being boiled, or the potatoes may be boiled and dried, and then moistened again ; or they may be roasted or fried in fat, and then made into soup. Each of these processes imparts a somewhat different character to the product. In most cases it is advisable to transform the potatoes into a purde, and give to this uniformity by a binding if the potatoes used were rough-starched. Plain Potato Soup of a dozen tubers requires the ordinary bulbs, roots, herbs and spices, but above all, a quantity of not less than 4 oz. of fresh butter; moisten the whole with two quarts of standard broth. Serve with chips of fried bread. Fried Potato Soup.—This soup goes under various patro- nymics, all of which are unsupported by history or anecdote. It possesses some specificity in this, that a portion of the potato-starch is by frying transformed into dextrin, which imparts to the soup a somewhat more mucilaginous body, reminding of barley soup. Some recipes order the addition of a pint of boiling cream, which is excessive and detri- mental to the savoury character and digestibility of the soup. Others advise the addition of a garnish of shredded lettuce, which interferes with the unity of this excellent soup.* Potato So2ip with Quenelles of Potato. Quenelles of Potatoes to be used in the Foregoing So7ip.— Bind the mashed and sifted potatoes (six) with butter, cream, and tinctures of spices; add the yolks of three eggs and the whites of two eggs, whipped to a froth, also chopped parsley; heat the paste, form into quenelles, and poach these in boiling water or broth. * Potato soups, various, cf.

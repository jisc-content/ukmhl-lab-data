70 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY prepare a joint of meat for enjoyment at home with his family. In general, roasting must be admitted to yield results superior to those of baking, but some joints when baked so nearly approach to the same when roasted, that they may be eaten as roasts with satisfaction. Such are Zcys and loins of pork, legs of mutton, fillets of veal, and many others. The meat should be good, and rather inclined to be fat. Very lean meat is unsuitable for baking, as it starts from the bone and shrivels up in a remarkable manner. Besides the joints mentioned, the following dishes may be particularly recommended for baking. They are protected from the drying which threatens lean meat by coverings of oiled or greased (buttered) paper, or by paste, and then their cooking becomes equivalent to braising. A sucking pig, when sent to the baker prepared for baking, should have its ears and tail covered with buttered paper properly fastened on, and a bit of butter tied up in a piece of linen to baste the back with, otherwise it will be apt to blister. A goose prepared in the same manner as for roasting should be placed on a stand, so that when it is half done it may be turned with its lower side upwards. A duck should be similarly treated. A buttock of beef, having been in salt for about a week, should be washed and put into a brown earthen pan with a pint of water or broth. Cover the pan tightly over with two or three thicknesses of cap or foolscap paper—never cover anything that is to be baked with broton paper, the pitch and tar in which will give to the meat a smoky bad taste—and give it four or five hours’ baking in a moderately heated oven. A ham, properly soaked, as directed below, may be covered with a crust of paste all over, and baked in a moderately heated oven; it is as full of gravy and of as fine a flavour as a boiled one.

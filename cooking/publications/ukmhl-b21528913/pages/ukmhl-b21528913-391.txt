363 VARIETIES OE ELOUR-PASTE exactly of the same materials in the same propoi’tion as the scalded-water paste, but the water is cold, and consequently the butter is not fused ; the paste therefore requires a great deal more kneadiug than the hot one; the fingers of the operator are used as dividers of the paste into flakes, which are again reunited by pressure with the palms. Short Paste for Hot Pates is also made like the previous kinds of paste, but the amount of fat is much greater, one part of butter being incorporated with two parts of flour. This paste should be kept cool, and not be worked with the hand, but with a knife or a pestle; for at temperatures approaching that of the human body the paste loses its cohesion and plasticity, and cannot be rolled out and shaped. On account of this, some recipes diminish the butter to one part upon four parts of flour. P^(,f Paste or Plaice Dough {Pate feuilletee) is one of the most remarkable achievements of magiric art. A stiff dough made of flour, yolks, and water, is stratified with cold butter by doubling up and rolling out in such a manner that layers of dough of extreme tenuity alternate with layers of butter of similar tenuity; for this purpose the dough must be kept very cold, in summer by artificial means. Short Puff Paste is a mixture of equal parts of puff' paste and short paste; it is therefore less stratified than p%ff paste. The doubling or tripling up and rolling out is called in culinary language ‘ giving it a turn.’ A piece of puff paste a quarter of an inch thick will, during baking in a well-heated dry oven, rise to the height of two inches, and thus increase its perpendicular diameter eight times, while there is no notable increase towards the circumference. The French pastrycooks call the excavation in the Hour into which the liquid to be incorporated is placed une fontaine {De la Varenne, l.c., p. 168) or une fosse.

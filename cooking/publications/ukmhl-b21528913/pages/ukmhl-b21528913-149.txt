BOUILLON, OR MEAT-BROTH 121 Difference between Broth and Gravy. The flavour of broth, as perceived by the nose, is very slight and delicate ; the gustatory impression is stronger. To become fully developed, gravy requires the effect of heat, when it is in the form of concentrated extract, so that it becomes slightly browned. Even highly-concentrated broth has never the stirring effect of light-brown gravy. Broth, on the other hand, requires the addition of flavouring vegetables and spices. For soups only the pale broth is requisite, but brown gravy imparts vivacity to the taste. For savoury sauces both the pale and the brown gravy are necessary. The hroion gravy is prepared by frying veal, ham, beef, fowl, game, etc., in butter until brown, and sim- mering the fry with stock; ragouts are founded in a similar manner. The changes which the extractive matters of meat undergo when they turn from the bland and colourless form to that of reddish-brown gravy are very interesting subjects of study, particularly as gravy such as flows from roast beef cannot yet be produced at will from pale broth. The alkaloids and peptonoids of broth no doubt suffer a change similar to that which starch and sugar undergo when they are heated to high degrees of temperature ; they lose water, become more complicated, doubled and trebled in chemical structure, and assume different, new properties, amongst ^ them a brown colour; the new products, when resulting from carbo-hydrates, are termed caramels. To the brown products of the broth peptonoids the term ‘ caramel ’ was actually applied by ancient great cooks, e.g.. La Chapelle ; in our time the term osmazome, which was formerly applied to the whole aggregate of meat-extract, might be reappro- priated. The correct appreciation of the true source of savour has contributed greatly to establish sound prin- ciples of tasty and wholesome cookery; to recall men from

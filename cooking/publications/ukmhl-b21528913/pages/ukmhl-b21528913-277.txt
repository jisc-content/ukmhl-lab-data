FINISHED WHITE SAUCES 249 Eussian Sauce is velout6 with liaison of yolks and herbs. It is peculiar by complication as well as name, and the secondary ingredients are better adapted to a brown sauce, e.g., grated horseradish, which becomes coloured on being boiled. Atelets Satice, Sauce aux Hdtelets, is now a covering for small bits of meat, or small birds or fish, which are strung on skewers, so-called hdtelets. The meat thus is in the position of kebobs or khubabs. The things to be fried are covered by this preparation, falsely called a sauce, then breadcrumbed, over the paste, dipped in beaten eggs, and again breadcrumbed and fried. Such fritures are termed a la Villeroi or a la Dauphine. Sup>reme Sauce, Sauce ait Suprtme de Volaille, is veloute flavoured with mushrooms and consomme of fowls, to be eaten with supreme de volaille, ie., slices of braised breast of fowl. This is really the highest development of veloute sauce; it verges towards bechamel and allemande, but does not receive any liaison ; however, both these sauces go well with the supreme. Horseradish Sauce assorts better with espagnole. If to be kept as white sauce, do not boil the horseradish long, and add much cream. Unites well with boiled beef or braised fillet of beef. The Hindostan housekeeper, or his ramasamy, will do well to remember that, although horse- radish grows well at Ootacamund and at Bangalore, yet the root of the moriuga, or ‘ drumstick-tree,’ provides a good substitute for horseradish. Morhuja-root Sauce (for use in East India).—Treat the moringa-root like horseradish. Gold Sauce of Moringa-root is the analogue of cold horse- radish sauce. Mingle with an ordinary mayonnaise or tartar sauce iced. Cardinal Sauce is velout6 somewhat promiscuously flavoured, and coloured red, whence the name.

434 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY a somewhat longer time to get done than the unboned joint, because the necessary rolling and tying together, to keep the meat juicy, prevents the heat from penetrating quickly to the interior, and heat has therefore to be applied for a longer time; if this he omitted, the interior of the roll may be found underdone, or even raw. If a family or symbiotic company be small, even a sirloin of light weight, roasted at once, becomes gastronomieally inconvenient. In such a case divide the joint as follows: Cut out the underciit or fillet, and dress it as a larded and braised entree; or, after marinading it previously, dress it as what some older writers called mock hare; the marinading gives you time for postponing its use. Cut off the abdominal flap with the outer parts of the ribs, and stew it for pressed beef, or boil it with roots and rhizomes; or salt it slightly, and then stew and boil it; from the main loin remove all excess of fat, which on the under side is suet, and use it for pudding, or fuse it out for other uses, such as frying. Now chop off the bodies of the vertebrae against which the fillet has been lying, and roast this tidy joint before the fire, protecting the ribs, exposed by the removal of the fillet, with suet and oiled paper. In this way a sirloin will give materials for three different hot dinners, plenty of variety, and enable the company to consume every part in an agree- able form. There are a number of variations of loins of beef, boned, i rolled, and braised, bearing different names, which depend upon variations of garnish mainly. Thus, the roll may be garnished with a ragout d la Financidre or d la Flamande, or d la Printanihre, or the garnish may consist of alternate j groups of stewed peas and potatoes, turned in the shape of olives and fried. We believe that no joint has received so much attention, and so many skilful modifications, as the braised loin of beef. In several of the recipes which we have perused, a great excess of alcoholic liquid is recoin-

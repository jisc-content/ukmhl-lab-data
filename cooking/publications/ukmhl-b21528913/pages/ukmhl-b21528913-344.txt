3i6 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY CHAPTER XXVI. VEGETABLES FOR ENTREMETS OR SECOND COURSE SIDE-DISHES. History and Use of Celery. Ciu.Eity is used in England mainly in two forms—firstly, in the shape of young green leaves for flavouring soups; and secondly, and mainly, in the shape of greatly-developed, etiolated, blanched leafstalks, which are eaten raw with cheese or salt, and also cooked in soups, ragouts, stews, and stewed by themselves. On the Continent, however, besides the young green leaves, the modification called celeriac, the greatly enlarged pole-rooi of the plant, is mainly used. This furnishes one of the most agreeable vegetable materials for various preparations : (a) The roots are boiled in broth, and eaten sliced in the soup ; (b) they are eaten as a vegetable with white sauce, either being boiled in broth first and subsequently dressed, or being stewed and braised at once in a sliced state ; (c) they yield an excellent salad boiled in broth or salt water, sliced fine, salted and spiced, covered with oil and a little vinegar. They may be mixed with other ingredients, or form a top- dressing to other more voluminous salads. An entire celery i)lant, of the kind which forms the en- larged and tuberculated pole-root, consists of about 61 per cent, of root, 18 per cent, of leaf-stalks, and 20 per cent, of leaves ; a root may weigh from 140 to 150 grammes, or from 4| to near 5 ounces. The root contains about 84 per cent, of water, 1'5 per cent, of nitrogenized substance, 0‘4 per cent, of fat, 0-8 per cent, of sugar, 11 per cent, of matters free from nitrogen (in this some starch), 1-5 per cent, of woody fibre, and above 0’8 per cent, of ash.

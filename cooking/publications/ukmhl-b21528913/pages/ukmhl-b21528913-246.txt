2lS THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY Pacific. The nests consist of marine cdgce (fucus or vareck, or others) mixed with small feathers. They have to be steeped in water or broth for at least twelve hours, and when the feathers have been picked out with a forceps, must be finely sliced, and boiled in standard broth until tender. They are then placed in the finished gravy-broth, which should never be made thick, so that the slices of algae be perfectly visible. Japanese Beclie de Mer Soiqn—The animal passing under the French name beche is taken in the Japanese seas and dried. When it is well cooked it yields a trembling, coherent, gelatinous mass. It is immersed in a savoury soup, and constitutes a first-rate delicacy. Chutnees or Chutneys. Chutnees* are compounds of sweet and acid fruit with sugar and spices. They perform the function of sharp sauces and of salads at the same time, and may be termed the little hors-d’oeuvres of the curry service. They used to accompany curries, and were served on small plates along with the rice. But with the disappearance of curries from the bill-of-fare of modern dinners, chutnees also have fallen into desuetude, owing probably to excess of spices with which makers used to impregnate them. Fresh chutnees should be served in saucers upon a tray, and several varieties may be presented for selection. Caviare, dressed with a little lemon-juice and a trace of cayenne pepper ; other roes of fish pounded with a little butter; potted prawns, potted ham, crab paste, lobster paste, and sardine paste, can accom- pany the chutnees. Tomato Ghutnee is made with the pulp of the love-apple, some onion, celery, green chillies, all chopped, and salt and vinegar. It differs from an ordinary salad only by the absence of oil. * Cf. for Gen. Observ., ‘ Wy\ ern,’ loc. cit.

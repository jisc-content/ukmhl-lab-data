496 THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY A variety of loild geese are suitable for the table—such as the barnacles of Wexford and Tralee in Ireland—but only in the first year of their existence ; in the second year they become tough, and acquire an oily or fishy taste, to he counteracted by marinading and roasting, and the accom- paniment of horseradish sauce. Ducks are mostly eaten roast, but are equally excellent en daube or braised. Green peas, fried turnips, or macedoine, are suitable garnishes; the braised duck goes well with espagnole. Boast Duck is mostly flavoured with a stuffing consisting of grec7i sage ^ oz., onion 1 oz., and breadcrumb 2 oz., with fat and spice and salt. This is put into the cavity of the duck, and fills only a small part of it, and therefore can hardly be termed a stuffing; for the idea ‘to stuff’ in- volves that of filling completely. To delicate stomachs this stuffing is not very digestible. Steioed Dicck or Duckling with Vegetables is a favourite dish, and admits of many variations. Fillets or Breasts of Duckling may be prepared a la bigarade, i.e., with the juice of Seville orange; the rest of the bird is turned into a salmi. Wild Ditck, of which the male is called mallard, the young individual a flapper, is a great resource of the autumnal and hiemal kitchen. It should be well hung before being dressed, and always roasted. It requires basting with butter, and from fifteen to twenty minutes, before a brisk fire. The Canvas-back Duck is a delicate bird of American origin. It should be cooked like our wild duck, but nearer to the fire, its fat being so liquid that it requires rapid coction not to run out. It is best eaten with plain gravy or sharp sauce. The cooking of wild ducks is different from that required by the domestic bird, in this, that it is never carried so far as in the case of the latter. Reared ducks must always be

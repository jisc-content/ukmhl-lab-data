The flavour of celery resides in an essential oil, which can be obtained by distillation with water of seeds and herb ; it is transparent, colourless or little coloured, and has a pungent, sweetish odour. On account of the volatility of the oil with water-vapour, dishes containing celery should not be boiled longer than is necessary for the cooking of the vegetable, or the vegetable should be added at the latest possible period. Another of the characteristic ingredients of celery {Apiuin (jravcolens) is apiin, originally discovered in parsley, in which it is present in larger quantities than in celery. This l)ody is a (jliicoside—that is to say, a sugar combined strongly with another matter, apigeuin. A solution of apiin in boiling water, or a decoction of parsley or celery, is coloured deep blood-red by ferrous sulphate, even when very dilute, and brownish-red by ferric chloride. Apiin crystallizes in needles, and in feebly alkaline solution turns the ray of polarized light to the right. Apigenin is a yellowish sublimable substance, and contains an aromatic radicle. Celery, in German spelled Sellerie, is probably derived from its Greek name selinon, which Linne used in com- pounding the distinctive adjective of its relative, parsley. Apiv/m is described as the plant beloved by the bees (apis). The older English botanists called celery ache; it has been

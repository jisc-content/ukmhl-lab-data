RARE VARIETIES OF SEA-FISH 549 marine perch ; conger eel, a very bony fish, of which Galen said that it was the hardest and most indigestible of fish; the murcena, or sealed, of which the Romans had a great opinion—on Cgesar’s return from Gaul, a speculator offered him 6,000 muraenas to be used at his triumphal banquet; bream, shad, dace, loeaver, sea-barhel, and thornback. CHAPTER XLVIII. PREPARATIONS OF SWEET-WATER FISH. Trout (French truiie, German Forelle) is the finest sweet- water fish. Of two varieties, one has white, the other rose- coloured flesh; the latter is called salmon trout, and is most esteemed; the colour of its flesh is supposed to be derived from the spawn and young of the crayfish which the trout eat. Although trout may grow to very large size (Soyer ate of one, taken in the Lake of Killarney, which weighed 26 lb.), they occur in the market only of moderate size. Trout should be boiled in salt water, with a little vinegar and aromatic herbs, and served with boiled potatoes and browned butter. This is the form to which, after having tried many others, we always prefer to return. Gold boiled troxd is excellent when served in a mayonnaise. When travelling in the Pyrenees we had this dish put before us almost daily. There is a recipe for Trout boiled in Wine, an echo of the faisan Lxicxdhis of Vuillemot, which we advise our readers not to spoil their fish with; even the ragout of mushrooms, the allemande sauce, and the garnishes could not restore the flavour of the trout drowned in and evaporated with the champagne or sauterne. Trout may be prepared axi gmtin, or boiled, sauced, egged, and baked, (d VAxurore), or baked in envelopes with fine herbs, or stujfed and stexoed (trnites farcies), or filleted and fried.

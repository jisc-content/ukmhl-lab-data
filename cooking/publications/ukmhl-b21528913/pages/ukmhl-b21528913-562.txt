THE SPIRIT OF COOKERY 534 from herrings, and they appear soon after the herrings are gone. However, while sprats rise in brackish water, herrings do not follow them, but remain at sea; and, inversely, sprats are not known to travel wdth the shoals of herrings. Sprats contain a large quantity of an oily fat of dis- agreeable flavour, and quite uneatable; this causes all other preparations of sprat, except the broiled, to be un- attractive or repulsive; hroilincj dissipates or volatilizes most of the oil, and leaves the meat eatable, and even of good flavour. Bouillon from sprats is very salt naturally, and cannot be used in a concentrated form. Smoked and dried sprats taste like kippered herrings. Whitebait is supposed to be herring fry, and is said to have been raised to the condition of herring in an aquarium. Dumas, in speaking of ‘ a whitebait dinner at Grennish,’ says that this little fish was called yanchette in Italy, 2>ontin at Nice, and T>oisson blane at Bordeaux. Probablj^ the only quality which the fish of the various localities have in common is that they are young fish ; probably they do not belong to the same species in any of these places. If whitebait are mainly herring fry, they are at the same time mixed with a considerable percentage of the fry of other species. They are taken only in brackish water, floating up and down the river with the tide; they make their appearance, being about an inch in length, early in March, and last through the early summer; but becoming large, they lose their attractive tenderness^ and colour, aud assume an oily flavour. Whitebait is eaten fried. Mackerel’’" was probably called scomber by the Eomans, though the tunuy was the principal bearer of that name. As regards the origin of the name mackerel, \ve have only a surmise by Belou, to the effect that it w’as derived from * Cf. Belon, Griease, Lit. Gosch., v. 093 ; cf. .'Elian, ‘ Hist.

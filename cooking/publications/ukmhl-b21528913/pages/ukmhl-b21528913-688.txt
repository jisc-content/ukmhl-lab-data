Its heat can be accurately graduated by raising or turning down the wicks, which are mostly two, each four inches wide. A gallon flask of mineral oil should be fitted into the stove-box. When used for some hours daily, such a stove consumes about two gallons of oil per month. Lamias burning spirit, which can be purchased at prices not exceeding 6s., are a means of great comfort on a journey.

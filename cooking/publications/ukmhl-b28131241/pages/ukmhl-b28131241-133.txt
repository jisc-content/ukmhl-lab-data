HATELETS. 67 truffle and poultry-fillets, or of fish and lobster. The small ‘aspic’ is surmounted by a cooked truffle, either peeled or ‘au naturel’. No. 7. and 9. are also vegetable ‘hâtelets’ ; they are to be formed of turnip or carrot, carved with a knife into the shape of a vase, but taken in several pieces. The vases are then garnished with little flowers, imitated in vegetables. A man of skill and taste will be able to execute very nice imitated ‘bouquets’ of flowers, with the vegetables commonly in use in every kitchen ; such as fresh bay-leaves, nutmegs, peppercorns, etc. Certainly such flowers cannot boast the strictest likeness with natural flowers, yet they are of a very nice and original effect. I have often seen such ‘bouquets’ executed in great perfection by mere apprentices.

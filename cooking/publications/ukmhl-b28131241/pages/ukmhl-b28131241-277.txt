BUTCHER’S MEAT. — VEAL. 211 fry very white ; let them cool under press, to stamp them round, as the ‘pain’ of liver, then mask them with a white ‘chaufroix’- sauce, and range them on a baking-sheet, to let the sauce cool. Choose some nice button-mushrooms, cut them transversally in slices, which mask with the white ‘chaufroix’-sauce, and range beside the sweetbreads. Fig. 73. Place a cylindric mould in an earthen vessel, surround it with pounded ice, and settle at the bottom a thin layer of aspic-jelly ; over which form a circle with alter- nated rounds of tongue and of liver. Cover it, by degrees, with aspic ; and this being firm, place over it a circle of rounds of sweetbread ; pour over it some aspic, and begin again another circle, of ox-tongue and ‘pain’ of liver alternated. Then fill the mould with aspic. Half an hour after, dip it into warm water, wipe it, and turn the aspic out on a cold dish. Garnish the top with a circle of rounds of mushrooms, and fill the hollow with a salad of vegetables, thickened with mayonnaise-sauce. I 490. Hot-pie (‘pâté-chaud’) à la financière (D. 74 and 75).

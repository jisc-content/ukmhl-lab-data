263 BUTCHER'S MEAT. — LAMB. with salt, pepper, and chopped parsley. One hour after, dip them into melted butter, mixed up with a few yolks of eggs; roll them in fresh bread-crumbs, set on a gridiron, and broil them on a moderate tire, for a quarter of an hour, turning and basting with butter ; then dish them, and send up separately some Tartar-sauce. 617. Sheep’s feet, ‘à la poulette’. — Boil two dozen sheep’s feet (see No. 616), drain them on a sieve, take off the shank-bone ; place them in a stew- pan, and keep covered. Ery in butter two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion ; when of a nice color, sprinkle over two tablespoonfuls of flour ; which fry, stirring with a spoon. Dilute the paste with about a quart of hot broth, stir it on the lire until boiling, and add to the sauce a bunch of parsley, and a few trimmings of raw mushrooms ; then remove it back, and boil for a quarter of an hour, letting it boil but partly ; skim off the fat, and pass it, through a sieve, over the sheep’s feet in the stewpan. Add to the stew three dozen small mushrooms, and a pinch of pepper ; let them simmer on a slow fire for twelve or fifteen minutes, and thicken with a ‘liaison’ of three diluted yolks of eggs; finish with five ounces of good butter in small bits, a pinch of chopped parsley, and the juice of one lemon. In Provence a point of garlic is added to the sauce before thickening it : this addition giving it a higher relish. 618. Lamb-cutlets ‘sautées’, with mushroom-purée (D. 95). — Get three necks of lamb, trim the superficial skin, re-covering them, and cut from Fig. 95. each, slantwise, five nice cutlets. Cut off the piece of back-bone, trim away the sinew from end and sides; beat the cutlets slightly with a cutlet-bat, trim them neatly, salt, and range them one beside the other, in a flat stewpan, with hot clarified butter. Set the stewpan on a brisk fire, fry the cutlets for twelve minutes,

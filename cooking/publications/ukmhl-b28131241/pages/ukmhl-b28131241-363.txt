POULTRY AND GAME. Poultry is divided into several distinct categories : fowls (poules), chickens (poulets), pullets (poulardes), and capons; turkeys, peacocks, and guinea-fowl (pintades) ; geese, and ducks ; and lastly, pigeons.

Eggs indeed being, in a manner, of absolute necessity in regard to culinary operations. Poultry, as far as I know, is to be found all over the world, but under very different conditions. The breeds not being the same, the products of course are far from possessing the same qualities. England and France are the countries, the best provided in this respect. By the extreme, and intelligent care taken for their reproduction, chickens, pullets, capons, and turkeys, are there brought to an unquestion- able, unsurpassed perfection. The introduction of foreign breeds, and the crossing of these breeds with those of our own countries, have had their natural result, the production of the most valuable sorts, varieties, and specimens, as well in regard to their fecundity, as for the superior quality of their flesh. This is however no exclusive privilege, but freely to be shared by all nations ; for wherever poultry is produced, it may be fattened, and the breed improved, and brought continually nearer to perfection. Bari poultry is only met with, where no trouble is taken for its amelioration, or where the methods applicable are unknown. The chickens of Brussels in Bel gium, and of Sagan in Prussia, the pullets of Brest in France, those of Slovenka in Russia, the geese of Silesia and Wurtemberg, the ducks of Toulouse, the capons of Ky√®v, Florence, and Styria ; give unquestionable

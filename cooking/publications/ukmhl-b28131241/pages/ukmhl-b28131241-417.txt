Chartreuse Of pigeons (D. 146). — With a small tin-cutter cut up some small sticks of carrots and turnips, half an inch long. Those stamped in carrot should be cut off the red parts only, and those in turnip should be kept a Fig. 146. tenth longer, in order to be able to place, on one white stick disposed transversally, four red ones. Boil the vegetables in salted water, but only till three-parts done; drain, wipe them on a cloth, and when cold, apply them against the sides (spread with buttered paper), of an oval ‘timbale’-mould, in the order shown by the drawing. Support the vegetables, by applying inwardly a thin layer of force-meat : the bottom of the mould must also be spread with force-meat. Blanch a cabbage, braise it with a pound of streaky bacon, previously blanched, and a small raw sausage.

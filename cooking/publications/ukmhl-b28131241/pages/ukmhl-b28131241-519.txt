ENTREMETS. — PASTE. 449 One hour before baking the cakes, work the paste with the hand, introduce into it a handful of yellow Indian-corn, and a few tablespoonfuls of molasses. Grease a cast-iron baking-sheet, and warm ; take up the paste with a tablespoon, and drop it on the hot baking-sheet : when spread, the cakes should be two or three inches in diameter; bake them on a good oven, turning them ; when ready, dish them, and send up at once. The Americans think as much of these cakes, as the Russians do of their ‘blinis’. 1000. Cheese soufflé, in small cases (D. 199). - Warm eight ounces of butter in a stewpan. Break ten yolks of eggs into a kitchen-basin, mix them with the butter ; stir on the fire for a few seconds, thickening the preparation ; then take it off the fire, and gradually introduce into it fourteen ounces of grated cheese (swiss and parmesan, each half). Season with a pinch of pepper and one of sugar, warm the preparation very gently, without ceasing to stir. When smooth, take it off the fire, and introduce into it two Avhipped whites of eggs. Twenty-five minutes previous to serving, add to the preparation six more whip- ped whites of eggs; now fill about ten middling-sized square paper-cases, which place on a baking-sheet, spread with paper, and push them into a slow oven. When done, dish up, and serve. This preparation of ‘soufflé’ does not rise much, but also does not crumble down, and is excellent to eat : being the best I know. 1001. Munster-tartines. —- Cut some slices of brown Westfalian bread, (pumpernickel), about the fifth part of an inch thick, and of a rectangular form, three inches wide; cut also some slices of fresh household-bread, of the same shape and thickness. Mask the brown bread with a thin layer of good butter, on which apply a slice of white bread, which equally mask with butter, and cover with a slice of brown I bread ; press the bread slightly, then divide it into oblong squares. These ‘tartines’ are served with tea.

PREFACE TO THE SECOND FRENCH EDITION. The rapidity, with which the first edition of this book has been ex- hausted, lias confirmed the hopes, that I had founded on the sympathy of the public. Botli the French, and foreign Press, have deigned to direct their atten- tion to the ‘Cosmopolitan Cookery’; and practitioners of high reputation have been kindly lavish in their praises of it. To all those enlightened minds who, at the same time that they are serving the cause of progress, place their influence and authority so gene- rously at the service of a humble fellow-laborer, I beg to express my warmest acknowledgments and thanks. I • shall reply to the sympathetic encouragement of my colleagues, by renewed efforts for the advancement of the culinary art, to which 1 devote the entire activity of an experience, jealous to justify the esteem, with which it has hitherto been honored. The ‘Cosmopolitan Cookery’, although not a book of the first order, will occupy a large place in culinary instruction, not only on account of the variety of the elements, and the new ideas it contains, but for the practical method of the different schools that it represents. Its numerous drawings, its theoretical demonstrations and definitions, form an exceptional collection, which I deem worthy to be consulted and studied, not only by cooks, but by all persons desirous of treating their guests according to the classic traditions of the table in all civilised countries. •

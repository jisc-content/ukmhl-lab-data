SWEET ENTKEMETS. CAKES. ooo 1226. Little cream-bucket (D. 273). — Take a wafer-preparation of almonds, in the proportions prescribed in No. 1083 ; spread it, on a waxed and floured long baking-sheet, in a layer not too thin ; when taken out of the oven, cut the cake in a strip of twenty-five or twenty-six inches, by five or six. Cut the ends slantwise in the same direction, apply this strip against a model of thin wood, made for this purpose and of bulking shape ; cut it narrowly, keep it in form with paper ; as soon as the cake is cold, solder it interiorly with the aid of a support of paste, Fig. 273. fixed with icing-sugar. Fix then on the top of the bucket two parallel handles, formed with the same paste, and pierced through ; surround the body of the bucket with hoops, imitated in almond-paste; fix it on the centre of a dish, till it, at the moment, with ‘plombière’-cream, or some whipped-cream. 1227. Parisian ‘d’artois’-cakes. — Spread on a baking-sheet a flat of thin tine short-paste, mask it with a layer of apple-marmalade, reduced with a little apricot, applying this layer half an inch thick. Equalise the surface, then masking it with thin slices of fresh apples, cut thin, passed under a round tin-cutter, and divided in the middle; range these apples symmetrically, setting them à cheval, so that the marmalade be entirely wrapped up. Sprinkle over the apples tine sugar, push the baking-sheet into a moderate oven; as soon as the paste is done, taking the flat out of the oven. Mask the apples with a paste-brush, dipped in vanilla-syrup, cooked à la nappe with a little apple-juice ; then divide the flat into long squares, thus forming the cakes. 1228.

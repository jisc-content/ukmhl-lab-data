When the cutlets are done, glaze them with a paste-brush. On the other hand, prepare a ‘croustade’ of rice, cut out cold, in a low form, and in the order shown by the drawing. Keep it covered till serving-time, then fix it on the centre of a dish, and dish the cutlets on the top, in a circular order, the bone downwards. Fill the centre with a good purée of chestnuts, baste it with a little melted glaze, and send up separately a boatful ol madeira-sauce. This entrée is certainly very elegant, by which I do not mean, that it should always be served in this grand style. The cutlets may be served very well directly on the dish.

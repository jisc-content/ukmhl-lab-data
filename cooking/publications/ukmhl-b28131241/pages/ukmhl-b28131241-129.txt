63 COOKING STOCK. 160. White fish-sauce (velouté). — With six ounces of butter, and eight ounces of flour, prepare a light yellow Toux’ ; that is to say, fry the flour without allowing it to take color. Dilute the Toux’ with four quarts of clarified fish-broth, stir the sauce on the fire until boiling, remove it back, and boil it for three quarters of an hour; then skim off the fat, pour it into a kitchen-basin, and stir with the spoon. 161. The ‘bain-marie’ (D. 3). — The bain -marie of the kitchen is com- posed of a deep baking-sheet, or square case in copper ; or else simply of a Fig. 3. flat stewpan with boiling-water in it In this vessel are kept warm those sauces and garnishes, which once finished must boil no longer. If the sauces of a dinner should be of great number, it is convenient to label the stewpans when shutting them in, so as to avoid any mistake at serving-time. The water of the ‘bain-marie’ must always be kept in a state of simmering, but not developed ebullition. The word ‘bain-marie’ is also applied to those creams, puddings, and ‘pains’ of poultry or game, which must be poached or cooked in a shut stewpan, the bottom of which is filled with a little boiling water. 162. Béchamel-sauce. — Put eight ounces of flour into a kitchen-basin, dilute it with three gills of cold milk, and fill the liquid in a stewpan, stir it on the fire; as soon as beginning to get consistent, remove it back, and work it well to smooth it; then moisten the sauce with a pint of boiled milk, add to it two small onions, a bunch of parsley, salt, peppercorns, and five ounces of raw ham in small dice. Let it boil, then put it back on a very slow fire, boil it twenty minutes, stirring from time to time ; and then pass it through a sieve, or a tammy. 163. ‘Mirepoix’. — The ‘mirepoix’ plays a great part in cookery, it is an auxiliary to many cookings; it is more or less rich, and carefully treated, according to wants and occasions.

SWEET ENTREMETS. —• JELLIES. 561 Drain the little baskets, spunge them, fill up the openings with butter; range them, each as soon as ready, on a thick layer of pounded ice, and fill them with the jelly ; let the jelly be delicate, and not too limed. An hour afterwards, dish the little baskets on a little stand of biscuit or ‘génoise’- cake, glazed, placed on a dish, and bearing on its centre a little support. Fig. 280- It is convenient to observe, that the jelly be not kept shut up too long in the skin of the ‘mandarines’, lest it should turn of a bitter taste, which is very disagreeable indeed. 1240. Jelly-‘rubanée’ (D. 281). — Take fifteen leaves of ‘gélatine’, with which prepare about a pint of clear white jelly, freed of all flavor ; divide this jelly Fig. 281. in two parts, one holding a third of the jelly, the other two thirds. Mix into the less quantity four tablespoonfuls of juice of strawberries, or raspberries, as well as a tew drops of vegetable carmine, thus giving it a nice rose-colored hue. Mix into the larger portion of the jelly, a few tablespoonfuls of liqueur, with white vanilla-cream; being careful not to mix in the liqueurs, until the jelly has lost all its heat. 36

COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. II my investigations, coupled with existing resources, will not be without influence on the profession in future times. Whatever the lot of this book may be, so intimately connected witli the general health and comfort ; there is one point in it, that becomes clearly manifest on one examination, namely, that I have not neglected any pains to be exact and clear : exactitude and clearness constitute indeed, in all the sciences, and especially in that of cookery, the only real bases of instruction. I have, as far as my own faculties permitted, redoubled my activity and zeal, in order to justify the title of this book ; to render the result however more successful and complete, I have not hesitated to lay under contri- bution the knowledge and experience of all the intelligent men of my acquaintance. This was, in my opinion, the safest way of arriving at a practical, sincere, and honest elaboration of culinary processes, that are so variously applied. I acknowledge with profound gratitude, that I have met with willing assistance from all sides. And now that the task is achieved ; all 1 have to do is, to await the sentence of the public, the absolute judge of an authorâ€™s work. U. D. 1808.

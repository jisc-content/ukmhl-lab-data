BUTCHER S MEAT. — BEEF. 165 who is operating, and who must be best able to judge, if the beef was quite young or not. The roasting beef must not be unwrapped, till within half an hour previous to its being taken off the spit: it must not be dredged with salt, sooner than at the last moment. Roast-beef, without doubt, must be served as hot as possible; yet I have had occasion to observe, that the meat takes higher qualities, that is, it acquires more Fig. 56. tenderness, when kept in the hot-closet {étuve) for twenty minutes: this observation is especially applicable to meat coming from a large animal. The spit is evidently the best method for the preparation of a joint of roast-beef; yet, when sufficient care is taken, it is possible to arrive at a fine result, even by cooking it in the oven. When the piece of roasting beef is to be cooked in the oven, there must be at disposal a baking-sheet with upstanding rim, to which is adapted a gridiron resting on four feet: on this gridiron the roasting beef is placed, wrapped up in a greased paper. The bottom of the baking-sheet is covered with a coating of fat into which a little warm water is mixed from time to time, so as to avoid its blazing up. But in no case must the fat of the baking-sheet reach to the height of the meat. The roasting beef must be baked in a moderate oven, and be basted and turned repeatedly. When no spit was handy, excellent results have been often gained by operating according to this method. Joints of roast-beef, whether large or small, whenever they are served hot, must be accompanied (separately) by good gravy, by potatoes boiled in water, and by one dish of fresh vegetables, likewise boiled in water ; besides these garnishes, it is convenient to serve scraped horse-radish, or else some horse-radish-sauce, either cold or hot. In England as well as abroad, in English houses, Yorkshire-pudding is generally served with hot roast-beef. L

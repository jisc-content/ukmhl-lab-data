FISH. 95 218. Brill, Paris fashion (D. 23). — A thick and fresh brill is a fish, which, well prepared and richly garnished, may form an exquisite dish, and acceptable even in a choice dinner. Cleanse the brill, wash it well, and wipe it on a cloth; score it on the black side all along the spine-bone ; place it on a large gratin-dish, thickly spread with butter; salt, and moisten it, to its height, with white wine ; add a minced onion, and a few trimmings of mushrooms. Let it boil, and at the first bubbling remove it back. Fig. 23. Prepare a garnish composed of about twenty fresh button-mushrooms, boiled at the time with butter and lemon-juice, three dozen large oysters poached in white wine, a few peeled truffles, boiled in wine and cut up in large slices ; and a few flat oval fish ‘quenelles’, rolled on a floured table and poached at the time. Boil in a ‘court-bouillon’ about twenty live crayfish. With four ounces of butter, the same of flour, and the liquor of the brill, passed through a sieve, prepare a white-sauce somewhat thick. When the sauce is passed, pour it into a flat stewpan, mix with it half the liquor of the mushrooms and the oysters ; reduce it on a sharp fire, introducing by degrees the remainder of the oyster- and mushroom - liquor. When sufficiently reduced, thicken with two diluted yolks of eggs, passed through a sieve, cook this preparation without boiling, then remove the sauce back, and introduce into it four ounces of butter (of the best quality), and at last a small piece of red butter, prepared with crayfish- shells : all of this is added gradually, continuing to stir the sauce, and not letting it boil. When ready to serve, drain the fish, place it on an oval dish, and surround it at both extremities, on one side with a group of white button-mushrooms, on the other, with a group of trimmed oysters. Mask the brill, and garnishes, with half of the sauce ;

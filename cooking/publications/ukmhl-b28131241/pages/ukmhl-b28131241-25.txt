BILLS OF FARE. To every person, not sufficiently initiated in the practical forms of culinary art, the bill of fare (menu) will have only a trivial signification; it is not every body, that is aware of its utility or importance ; but practi- tioners, as well as ‘gourmets’, know perfectly well how to appreciate its high purpose and significance. In the eyes of the amphitryon, the bill of fare is the eloquent expression of the dinner he is expecting. For the practitioner, it is a matter of still greater interest ; as it is the representative of all his exertions, his abilities, his vigils, and unceasing labors;there slumber hidden in its folds, as well the secret hope of triumph, as the apprehensions of failure: a reflection of his science, it may be considered the ‘rock a-head’, or the symbol of his future. If, moreover, it is considered, that a badly composed bill of fare cannot but be the precursor of a poor dinner ; it will be easily believed, how many deceptions and disappointments there may be, reflected on those glazed little squares of paper. These consequences, too, depend in all appearance on such petty details; that young men cannot too carefully make themselves acquainted with the experiences of competent men for meditating and seriously studying the composition of bills of fare ; above all they never must forget, that a bill of fare, well composed and ingeniously executed, has more than once altered the destiny of a cook. Questioning the absolute necessity of the bill of fare, or the importance of the part it plays, therefore, is considered by me as the greatest culinary heresy : it being as much as to wrong one of the branches of the art, which, as regards its labors and material principles, may well exact a little prestige.

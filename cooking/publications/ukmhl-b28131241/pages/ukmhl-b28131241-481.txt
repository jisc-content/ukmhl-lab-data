411 GAME. - QUAILS, LARKS, THRUSHES. y Now spread eight ounces of short-paste in a round flat, rather thick ; set it on a round baking-sheet (tourtière), wet the edges of the paste, and garnish its centre with a layer of force-meat; on which arrange the larks in a dome-like fashion, Ailing the cavities with force-meat; then cover the dome with thin slices of fat-bacon, Anishing the operation, proceeding as in No. 897 ; bake the ‘tourte’ in a moderate oven for one hour; when done, slip it on a dish, make a circular incision on the centre, removing the top, and through this opening, take out the bacon ; baste the inside of the ‘tourte’ with a few tablespoonfuls of good brown-sauce, or some thickened gravy, reduced with a little wine ; cover it again, and send it up. 923. Small cases of thrushes with truffles (D. 186). — Prepare a dozen ‘galantines’ of thrushes, shaping one end pointed, and the other round. Pare, Fig. 186. glaze them with a paste-brush, and mask them with a thin coating of‘chaufroix’- sauce. Get twelve plaited paper-cases, pointed on one end ; garnish them with a little chopped aspic, and place a ‘galantine’ in each of them. Prepare a small cold entrée-stand of the shape of a channeled cup, and adorned on the top with a hanging channeled border. This stand may be in three pieces, and the base in massive wood, masked with fat. The hanging border is modeled with the hand. When the stand is Axed on a dish, take a few cooked and cold peeled truffles, dip them in melted meat-glaze, and dish them up on the centre of the cup of the stand. Surround the base with a thick string of chopped aspic, squeezed through a cornet ; then place the small cases all round, applying the pointed end against the truffles. My object here has been, to represent the prettiest method of serving this entrée, really simple, and yet very distinguished. But one should not forget, that the stand is here nothing but an accessory, to be omitted at pleasure.

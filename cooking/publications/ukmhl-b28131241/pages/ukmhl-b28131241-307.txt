BUTCHER’S MEAT. — MUTTON. 241 504. Haunch of mutton, braised * (D. 85). — Choose a haunch of mutton cut to the height of the first ribs, bone the loin, and the leg to the first joint; salt the meat inwardly, truss it to a pretty elongated form, and place it in an oblong stewpan, spread with trimmings of lard and vegetables ; salt slightly, and moisten with about a pint and a half of broth. Set the stewpan on the fire, reduce the broth to a glaze, moisten then the mutton to its height with broth ; let the liquid boil up, Fig. 85. then remove the pan on to a very slow lire, with live embers on its lid, keeping it thus for five hours at least, and longer if the haunch does not come from a young animal. In all cases, it is prudent to put it in cooking an hour sooner, thus avoiding all risk of serving the meat tough. When the mutton is properly done, take it up on a baking-sheet ; dilute its i stock with a glass of white wine, boil, skim off its fat, and strain it; reduce it to half-glaze, and thicken slightly with brown-sauce, or tomata-sauce. Remove the string from the mutton, cut it in slices in the way shown in the drawing ; dish up, put a ruffle on the bone, and surround it with a garnish of small glazed onions in groups ; glaze with a paste-brush, pour a part of the sauce on the bottom of the dish, and send the remainder in a sauceboat. 565. Mutton-steak, broiled, with Spanish tomata-sauce. Cut off a good large transversal slice, or steak, from the greatest breadth of a leg of mutton, about an inch and a half thick, sawing off the bone of the centre. Beat * What in the kitchen-vocabulary is called braising, is the mode of cooking meat in a succulent i gravy, and with but little liquid : braised meat, of whatever species, must always be thoroughly done.

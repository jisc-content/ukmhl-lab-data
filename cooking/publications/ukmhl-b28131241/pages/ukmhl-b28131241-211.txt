Lobster-tails, with jelly (D. 46 and 47). — To arrange this entree in the conditions, in which it is shown in the drawing (47), it is requisite to have two dishes of lobster to prepare; then half the tails, turning to the right, are placed on one dish, and those turning to the left on another; thus they maybe dished up together. Else the order of the arrangement must be altered, and the six half-tails be ranged in three groups. A Fig. 46. Fig. 47. Boil in salted water three or six small lobsters, and let them cool with their tails stretched out. When cold, remove their tails and claws ; which latter are opened, so as to lay bare the flesh; which is taken out, coated with aspic-jelly, and then put back again into the shells. Divide each tail lengthwise in two parts ; pick them, and slice their flesh. Cleanse the tail-shells carefully ; wipe them, and mask them, on the bottom, with a layer of chopped jelly, on which place the flesh of the tails applied on the cut side, the red part turned upwards. Meanwhile, fasten on to a dish a decorated ‘pain-vert’, having a small wooden column fixed on its centre; surround the column with butter or parsley-leaves, in order thus to form a base for the tails ; then take the six halves of tails bending- in the same direction, and dish them on the ‘pain-vert’* with the pointed end downwards, applying them against the column, and supported at their base by chopped jelly. * As in the course of my descriptions the ‘pain-vert’ is often mentioned , I wanted to give a model. | This (D. 4G) is in wood, spread all round with a layer of fat, and on the top with a round of white paper. It j bears on its centre a stem or small column ; either in fat or, in wood masked with fat, butter, or paper, j The centre of the column is hollow. 10

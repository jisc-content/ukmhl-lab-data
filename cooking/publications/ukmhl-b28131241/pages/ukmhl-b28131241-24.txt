X COSMOPOLITAN COOKEKY. It will be perceived, that the method 1 commend, is based, one may say, altogether on the principle of the fork remaining invariably at the service of the left hand, in regard to food that requires to be cut up on the plate, while the knife and spoon belong to the right hand; in any case they should not be displaced by passing them from left to right, or from right to left. This displacement is sometimes the result of a pre-occupation of mind, that cannot be too carefully avoided; for as soon as the instru- ments are diverted from the office naturally assigned to them, confusion arises, and embarrassment betrays itself. Awkwardness, real or apparent, therefore simply depends on the observance, more or less attentive, of a few rules, that might be thought unimportant, but from which an ex- perienced guest never departs. Thus, to accustom oneâ€™s self to hold the fork with the left hand, in order to convey the food to the mouth, soup excepted; to hold the knife or the spoon with the right hand, without any transposition ; is nearly all, that constitutes the basis and the principle of the method. The remainder is but a secondary and accessory question, belonging to a code of cere- monial rules, which I have neither the desire, nor the right to draw up. My only object here is, to be the promoter of a reform, on the continent; which, in my opinion, the exigencies of improvement require in the order of gastronomy.

421 GAME. HARE. inch thick; when cold, divide it (with the aid of a model) into parts, the size and shape of a nice cutlet ; glaze them with the paste-brush, adorn them on their thick part with truffles, and cover them entirely with a thin layer of aspic-jelly. On the other hand, fix on a dish, a small entrée-stand in fat, and cast in two pieces ; adorn the friese with vine-leaves and imitated grapes of white fat. Dish up. on the centre of the stand, a group of small round truffles, dipped in half-set jelly. Fig. 190. thus fastening them together. Put a small hone and ruffle on each cutlet, and dish them up in a circle round the truffles. The stand is here nothing but an accessory ; it may be suppressed, and cutlets and truffles served directly on the dish. 945. ‘Pain’ of hare, with truffles. — Take out the meat from the legs and shoulders of a cooked hare ; pare, divide it in pieces, which fry with bacon on a brisk fire, and let cool ; pound them afterwards, add to them the same volume of raw chopped fat-bacon, and a few trimmings of raw truffles; season the force-meat highly, pass it through a sieve, and add to it a quarter its volume of cooked bacon, and the same of raw truffles, both cut up in large dice. Butter thickly a ‘timbale’-mould, fill it with the force-meat, pressing it in; cover the top with bacon, and set the mould in a ‘sauté’-pan, with water to a third its height'; push it into a moderate oven, to bake for three quarters of an hour, and let the ‘pain’ cool in the mould. One hour previous to serving, heat the mould in boiling water, and turn the 'pain’ out on the lid of a stewpan ; smooth its surfaces with the blade of a knife, glaze it with a paste-brush, slip it on a dish, coat it (le napper) with half-set jelly, and surround at its base with ‘croûtons’ and chopped aspic.

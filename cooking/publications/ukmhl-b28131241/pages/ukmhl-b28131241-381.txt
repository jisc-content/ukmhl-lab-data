311 POULTRY. — FOWLS. (inwardly) against the buttered sides of a dome-mould, with a cylinder ; applying the decorated part of the fillets against the sides, and the pointed end on the base of the cylinder. Fill the hollow with a good raw chicken ‘quenelle’ force-meat ; cover the top with a round of buttered paper, and poach the ‘pain’ in the ‘bain-marie’ for forty minutes. Fig. 120. When ready to serve, turn the ‘pain’ out on a dish, garnish the hollow of the cylinder with sliced truffles and white cocks’-combs, forming on the top a small circle, and setting in the centre a round truffle; mask the ‘pain’ with a little white- sauce, reduced with the trimmings of truffles, and pour the remainder into a sauce- boat. This entree is dished up to go on the table, and it is placed on a round hot-water dish. 721. Poulards (pullets) of ‘la Bresse’, roasted (D. 121). Fig. 121. England and France are the first countries in the world for the production of good poultry : those of the old province of ‘la Bresse’ (like the Norfolk turkeys) leave nothing to desire.

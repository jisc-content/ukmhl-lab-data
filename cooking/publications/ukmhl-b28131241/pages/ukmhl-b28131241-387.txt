317 POULTRY. — FOWLS. deira : the Tagout’ should be cold; cover it with a layer of force-meat, and poach the ‘pain’ in the ‘bain-marie’ for three quarters of an hour. When ready to serve, fry the minion-fillets on a brisk lire, only for a few se- conds, thus setting them ; drain immediately dry, and dish them up in a circular order, round the poached ‘pain’ of force-meat, meanwhile turned out on the centre Fig. 124. of a dish ; which mask slightly, as well as the bottom of it, with a little good wlnte- sauce ; and insert on the top a ‘hâtelet’-skewer, garnished with a nice cock’s comb and a truffle. This dish is placed on a hot-water dish. 732. Capons of Lully. — Draw two capons, singe them, cut up the leg- bones at the joint, disengage partly the meat of the leg-bone, and cut it half the length; then introduce the legs into the hollow. Fill the crop of the capons with a little raw ‘quenelle’ force-meat; truss them neatly with their legs straight, rub them with lemon, and cover them completely with bacon ; then place them in a stewpan, moisten to height with a ‘mirepoix’ with white wine ; boil them at a moderate tire, with the lid on ; and when done, drain, wrap them up in a damp cloth, and let them cool. On the other hand, prepare a garnish composed of round truffles, button-mush- rooms, and nice cocks’-combs ; mask the mushrooms with a white ‘chaufroix’-sauce, glaze the truffles with a paste-brush dipped into half-set jelly, and leave the cocks’- combs in their natural condition. Fix on an oblong dish a ‘pain-vert’ of an oval form, not too thick, and bearing on its centre a support of wood, masked with fat. The

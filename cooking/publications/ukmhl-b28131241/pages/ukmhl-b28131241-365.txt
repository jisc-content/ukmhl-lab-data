295 POULTRY. — TURKEY. On the other hand, prepare a little force-meat, with the trimmings of the fillets, and with this, mould some ‘quenelles’ with a spoon ; arrange them evenly on the bottom of a buttered flat stewpan, and poach them in salted water. Prepare a nice ‘pâté-chaud’ crust ; when done, fix it on a dish, and keep it hot. When ready to serve, till the pie-crust to height with a good ‘risot’, finished with Fig. 108. a ‘julienne’ of raw truffles ; smooth the top, whereon dish the ‘paupiettes’ in a circle, and in an upright position. Fill also with rice the hollow formed by the paupiettes ; and place on it upright the ‘quenelles’. Now put a large truffle on the top, and a small one on each of the ‘paupiettes’; mask the quenelles lightly with a little sauce, the remainder of which send in a sauceboat. 696. Cold turkey, with jelly (D. 109). — Fill a nice turkey with Fig. 109. bread-stuffing ; wrap it up in paper, and roast it to a nice color ; then take it off the fire, and let it cool. Cut off the tip of the legs at the joint, and put a ruffle to the drum-stick-bones. Slip afterwards the two fillets off the breast ; cut them up in slices, and put them back into place ; glaze the turkey with a paste-brush, dish it on a layer of chopped aspic-jelly, surround it on both sides with nice-shaped ‘croûtons’ of jelly, and place on each end a bunch of water-cresses.

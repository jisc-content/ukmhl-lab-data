129 FISH. 304. ‘Matelote’ of carp (D. No. 38). — Cleanse two or three mid- dling-sized carp ; divide them in pieces, cut the heads in two ; remove the gall-stone, and blanch the roes separately. Slice an onion, and a carrot; fry them in a stewpan, with butter, for eight or ten minutes; then add the pieces of carp, season them, and two minutes after, moisten (till covered) half with white wine and half with red ; add two spoonfuls of brandy, a bunch of parsley, with aromatics, peppercorns, cloves, and about fifteen fresh raw mushrooms. Set the stewpan on a brisk fire, boil the liquid, for ten or twelve minutes. Then remove the stewpan back, and thicken the stock with a piece of kneaded - butter in small bits. Toss the stewpan, till the butter is dissolved. At the same time bake ‘à blanc’ a hot-pie crust; when ready, fix it on a dish, place on its interior centre a support of fried bread, which surround at its base with force- meat ; dry it in a warm stove. When about to serve, garnish the crust, to its height, with the lower rounds of the fish, as well as with small poached ‘quenelles’ ; on this first layer, place the heads of the carp, surrounding them, on one side with mushrooms, on the other with small glazed onions ; on the latter, range ‘en rosace’ four nice slices of carp, on the centre of which (entering into the bread) run a ‘hatelet’-skewer garnished with shrimps or crayfish. Mask the fish and mushrooms with a little sauce ; the remainder of which is sent up in a sauceboat ; add the blanched soft-roes, cut up in pieces. 305.

Cover the fish with a sheet of buttered paper, and set it in a moderate oven ; a quarter of an hour after, turn it out, and finish cooking it carefully basting

Turkey with truffles, Toulouse fashion (D. 114). - The tat turkeys of Toulouse are those most in renown in the south of France. This roast, as Fig. 114. served in Toulouse, and such as it is represented in the drawing, is one of the most distinguished ones to be offered to ‘gourmets’. Peel about fifteen raw truffles, and put them into a stewpan. Pound half a pound of fresh bacon with the truffles-trimmings, and pass it through a sieve. Draw a good turkey, not over fat, but fleshy ; stuff it with the bacon, sew up the openings ; truss it, wrap it up in buttered paper, and roast it on the spit, basting with butter.

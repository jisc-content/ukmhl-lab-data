Boil in salted water a pound and a quarter of good large macaroni ; drain, and cut them in pieces two inches long ; which put into a stewpan, and pour over a part of the sauce, in which let them simmer for a quarter of an hour, thus reducing all the moisture: then take it off the fire, introduce into it five ounces of butter in small bits, and a handful of grated parmesan: season, and let it nearly cool; arrange Fig. 191. them by layers, in the cavity of the Timbale’, alternated with the slices of truffles, and the prepared force-meat. Close the Timbale’ with a round of paste, and bake it in a good oven, for three quarters of an hour ; when done, turn it out on a dish, open it on the top, and pour in the remainder of the sauce. To render this dish more luxurious, the force-meat of game may be replaced by slices of cooked fat-liver. 958. ‘Gibelotte’ of field-rabbits. — The ‘gibelotte’ (a sort of fricassée) is a popular dish of France, and specially of Paris, where it is generally very well prepared. Skin and draw two field-rabbits, cut them up into middling-sized pieces, which put into a kitchen-basin, with aromatics and two small onions; baste them with two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and let them macerate for two hours ; drain them after- wards on a cloth, wipe, and place them in a stewpan with melted fat-bacon, or with lard ; fry them quickly, season them with salt and pepper ; when their moisture is evaporated, and they are of a nice color, sprinkle over a small handful of flour; moisten to height with white wine, stir the stew till boiling (the sauce should be a little thick) ; let it boil quickly for seven or eight minutes ; add six ounces of streaky bacon in squares, and a bunch of aromatics ; remove the stewpan on to the side of the fire, cover it, and continue cooking the meats : when they are nearly done, add to them about fifteen raw mushrooms.

BUTCHER S MEAT. — PORK. 279 • j meat and vegetables must be done ; then drain tbe pork, place it on a dish, and sur- J round it with the vegetables.

Ham, with aspic-jelly (D. 101). — Get a ham freshly smoked, scrape it, saw off the end of the knuckle-bone, and leave it to soak for a few hours ; after which boil it according to the instructions given in No. 654. When taken out Fig. 101. of its cooking-stock, after slipping off the thigh-bone, wrap the ham up tightly in a cloth, shaping it into a nice form to cool. Unpack it afterwards, trim the rind away, pare it neatly, glaze the surface with a paste-brush; put a ruffle to the bone, set it on a ‘pain-vert’ masked with white paper, or with fat ; surround the ham at the base, with chopped aspic-jelly ; place on the top some ‘croûtons’ of aspic, in a scroll fashion, and insert on the thin end one or two ‘hâtelet’-skewers, garnished with jelly and truffles. The ham may be carved before dishing up. 660. Salt leg of pork, English fashion. — Wash a leg of pork, salted for a fortnight ; place it in a braising-pan, cover it largely with water ; place the braising-pan on a brisk fire, in order to let the liquid boil ; then forthwith remove it back to the side of the fire. Add some large vegetables, as well as half a quart of dry yellow pease, wrapped up in a cloth, which is tied fast with thread. Cover the braising-pan, and continue a regular ebullition, for three hours, if the leg weighs seven or eight pounds. When the meat of the knuckle-end of the leg is tender, to the touch of the finger, drain the leg, pare, dish it up, and keep it warm. Drain the pease, untie, take them out ; pound them, and pass them through a sieve ; put the purée into a stcwpan, add to it a piece of butter, season it, warm, and place it in a small deep dish. ,

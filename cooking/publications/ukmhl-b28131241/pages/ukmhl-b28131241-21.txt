THE ART OF EATING AT TABLE. No doubt it would require a long* study, to write ‘on the Art of Eating’, as exercised by the variety of civilised nations. The investigations requisite for that purpose, if judiciously conducted and co-ordinated, might be not uninteresting even for the learned ; but a work of that nature, and impor- tance, would by far exceed the bounds proposed for this book; I shall therefore confine myself to pointing out those general rules, which com- prehend, in brief, the sum of all my observations. I will not here enter into an examination of the manner of eating of the different modern societies, according to their rank and degree of civili- sation ; as ungracious parallels, or distasteful comparisons, might be the result.

All those who have travelled over Europe, and have been present at dinners, whether great or little; all those who have seen many persons at- table, know perfectly well, that this assertion is by no means exaggerated. Would it then be displaying too much presumption to endeavor, on the one hand, to set aside superannuated customs, which at bottom are défective; and on the other hand, to propagate a method, more in harmony with good taste, and the best traditions of gastronomy ? I do not think so. Had 1 entertained the least suspicion, that my thought might be liable to such an interpretation, I would immediately have abandoned the idea

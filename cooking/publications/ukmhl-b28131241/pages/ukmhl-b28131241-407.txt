POULTRY. — CHICKEN. 337 crumb, and broil them on a moderate tire for twenty minutes, turning them ; dish them up, and pour on the bottom of the dish some succulent good gravy with taragon. 770. Chicken-fillets, English way (D. 138). — Pare ten fillets of chicken, trimming away the sinewy skin : beat them slightly, with the handle of a knife dipped in water, round them on the largest side, and pare them to a point on the opposite side ; salt slightly, and keep them covered. in salted water a nice pickled ox-tongue, managing to have it just done at serving- time. With the thighs of the chickens prepare some 'quenelle’ force-meat, fill with it a plain border-mould, and poach it in the 'bain-marie’. Get fifteen small raw truffles, peel, and keep them covered. With the bones of chicken, vegetables, aromatics, a little white wine and broth, prepare some stock, little of it, but good. When strained, add to it the trim- mings of truffles, reduce it to half-glaze, and mix it with an equal quantity of brown- sauce. Let this sauce boil for three minutes ; strain it then, through a tammy, into a small stewpan ; add to it the raw truffles, and a few spoonfuls of sherry ; boil the truffles on a very slow fire for eight or ten minutes. When ready to serve, pour the clarified butter into a flat stewpan, in which place the fillets one beside the other, and set the pan on a good fire, to poach the fillets on both sides. Two minutes will do. Take them up at once, and drain them. Drain the pickled tongue, remove the skin, and cut up, slanting, and across the thickness, a dozen good slices, not too thin ; and pare them to the size and shape of the fillets.

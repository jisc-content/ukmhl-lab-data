COSMOPOLITAN COOKEliY. VIII of adding this ‘hors-d’œuvre’ to my cookery - hook ; but, on the con- trary, every thing strengthens me in the conviction, that my initiative comes most opportunely, to fill up a gap, and supply a deficiency, until some better qualified writer may furnish us with a complete treatise on this subject. Now-a-days, when communication between the inhabitants of the most distant countries is so easy and so frequent, when even culinary art is tending to become a universal science, and when all wish to participate in its progress ; we cannot and ought not to show ourselves indifferent to any thing, that may contribute, directly or indirectly, to strengthen the most natural tie, that binds nations to one another. Hence it would be desirable to come to an understanding, as to the adoption of a uniform and generally accepted method, on the art of eating, founded on the most rational rules. Taking one’s repasts in society, whether at home or at the tables of others, is an act of no less real import and significance, than all the other manifestations of decorum and urbanity.

Be it remarked, that we are not alluding here to the refinements of etiquette, but solely to a method, of which the rational application might regulate the motions of the person eating, and at the same time contribute to his ease and comfort at table. These brief remarks relieve me of the task of urging any more explicit or detailed considerations. Suffice it here to say, that the English method, if not the most disseminated, is at least the one most observed and practised in the higher circles of society; and that, in all probability, it will one of these days (at no very distant epoch) take the lead of all the others. Indeed, the English enjoy, in this respect, a European reputation; they both eat at their ease themselves, and do not inconvenience their neigh- bours at table: these are two points, which, in my opinion, give to their

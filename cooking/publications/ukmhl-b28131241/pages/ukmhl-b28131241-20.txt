COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. VI used in their composition, or by reason of their peculiar process of appli- cation. But, were it only from the student’s point of view, the title of my work imposed on me the duty of bringing to light all known theories, however singular they might appear : culinary science being- without limits, practitioners mrust do their best to search it out even in its most obscure recesses. Side by side, however, with original productions, men of study will find inexhaustible resources, the more useful, that they are clear, and easy, both to comprehend and execute. ‘Cosmopolitan Cookery’ is now the Second Book that I am-publishing- in England; one more yet remains, for me to execute, of great importance and extent, in order to complete the comprehensive series, which I have planned; but I confess I feel constrained, at present, to postpone such further publication. Not that I have by any means renounced my recently announced project: far from that, my object is, to give it a more full and wide extension. Ever animated by the desire of diffusing culinary learning, I have no mind to shrink from any effort, any sacrifice; but, being only a working artist, living by his labor and the practice of his art, it may easily be understood, that my funds are not inexhaustible. Those versed in the details of publication, must be well aware, that many years are often requisite to re-imburse the cost involved in publishing attractive, but luxurious, illustrated works, like mine, addressing, by their speciality of character, only a narrow circle, not the generality of readers. Never- theless, I have good grounds for thinking, this interruption will be of no long duration : I willingly indulge the hope, that the sympathy of the public in my books, will soon permit me to resume my interrupted task, and carry it to full completion. .July, 1870.

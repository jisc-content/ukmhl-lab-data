BUTCHER’S MEAT. — MUTTON. 261 613. Carbonnades* of mutton, glazed (D. 93). — Get four ‘carbon- nades’ of mutton, cut each of them in two, removing the bone between the lesser fillet and the larger one, but without taking the minion-fillet out, trim away the fat, re-covering the loins ; which lard with bacon, fold the skirt under, secure it with string, and place the ‘carbonnades’ in a stewpan strewn with sliced vegetables, Fig. 93. cloves, peppercorns, and aromatics. Salt slightly, moisten with a glass of broth ; set the stewpan on a brisk fire, and reduce the moisture to a glaze ; moisten the meat again to its height with broth and white wine, let the stock boil quickly five or six minutes, then put the pan over a moderate fire ; cover it, and braise the ‘carbonnades’, basting often with their own stock. At last, glaze them nicely, remove the string, dish up, and baste them with their own stock, mixed-up with a little tomata-sauce. 614. Mutton-cutlets,‘à la macédoine’(D. 94). — Mutton-cutlets, if Fig. 94. nicely pared, of equal size, broiled to a nicety, constitute an entrée, which, in spite of its simplicity, may appear at any dinner ; but on the condition, that the meat be tender, delicate, and succulent. Pare fourteen mutton-cutlets all of equal length ; season them ; dip into melted buttci’, broil them at a moderate fire, turning them. As soon as taken off the fire, put ruffles to the bones, range the cutlets in a circle on a round dish. Place in the middle a ‘macédoine’ of tender vegetables of vai’ious shades and sorts, thickened * The name of ‘carbonnades’ is given to the end of the nock of mutton, from the point, where the cutlets end, and where the loin begins.

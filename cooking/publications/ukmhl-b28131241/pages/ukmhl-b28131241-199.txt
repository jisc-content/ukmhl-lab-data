133 FISH. 314. Turban of sole-fillets, Paris fashion (D. 40). — Remove the black skin from five small soles ; take out their fillets, pare them neatly, season, and decorate half of them with pieces of truffle, cut in crescents ; which insert into small incisions, made at an equal distance, in the fillets. With the trimmings of soles, and an equal quantity of pike-flesh, prepare some ‘quenelle’ force-meat (see No. 244). With the three parts of this force-meat fill a buttered border-mould, and poach it in the ‘bain-marie’. When firm, turn the border out on a flat of short-paste, half-baked, and cut exactly of the diameter of an entrée- Fig. 40. dish ; mask it with a thin layer of force-meat, applying the remainder of it on the top, in a thick string, thus augmenting the height of the border. This done, place the fillets of soles ‘à cheval’ against the exterior sides of the border, thrusting the thin ends into the hollow of the border, and taking care to alternate the fillets, one being decorated, and one plain. Fill the centre of the turban with a bread-support, masked with buttered paper, or with bacon ; also wrap the fillets up with buttered paper and bacon; fasten it with string, and push the turban into a moderately heated oven, to bake for thirty-five minutes; when done, take off the paper, remove the bread-support, drain the fat off, and slip it on to a round dish. Edge the dish with a border of ‘nouille’-paste, and stick on the centre of the turban a support of fried bread of the same height, on which fix a small pewter-cup, masked with nouille-paste. Garnish it with small round truffles, and mask the fish with some ‘veloute’-sauce, reduced, and very slightly thickened. Send up separately a boatful of oyster-sauce. 315. ‘Aiguillettes’ Of tunny, fried. — Cut a slice of tunny, a little more than half an inch thick, remove the skin, and divide the slice in two, removing the bone, and cutting the flesh off the thickness of the slice, in very thin strips, forming

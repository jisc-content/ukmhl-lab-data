POULTRY. — TURKEY. 301 in tliin slices; which, as well as the pieces of the leg, arrange on the garnished dish containing the ‘nouilles’. 707. Turkey, boiled, à l’écarlate (D. 112). — Singe a turkey, draw, till it with a stuffing of bread-crumbs and beef-suet (chopped), so as to get it quite round ; truss the turkey, as for boiling, and place it in an oblong stewpan with aromatics, peppercorns, cloves, and a few sprigs of fresh celery-leaves. Two hours previous to serving, moisten the turkey, to its height, with hot broth and toppings; set the stewpan on the fire; let the liquid boil up, cover the turkey Fig. 112. with a buttered paper, and boil it for two hours, covered, and on a moderate fire, that the cooking-stock may not be reduced too much. On the other hand, boil two pickled ox-tongues, being careful to put them on the tire soon enough to be done at the same time with the turkey, and keep them in their stock till ready to serve. When the turkey is done, strain the cooking-stock, and skim off the fat, which pour over the turkey. With a pint of turkey cooking-stock prepare a little white-sauce (see No. 159); stir the sauce on the fire, to thicken ; as soon as boiling, take it off, thicken with three yolks of eggs, boil without allowing it to boil up, and pass it through a sieve. When ready to serve, drain turkey and tongues, remove the string from the turkey, and set it on an oblong dish ; make a decoration on the breast with taragon- leaves, and surround it, at its base, with slices of tongue cut off the thickest parts ; pour on the bottom of the dish a little good gravy, and pour the sauce into a sauceboat. The dish itself is placed on a hot-water-dish.

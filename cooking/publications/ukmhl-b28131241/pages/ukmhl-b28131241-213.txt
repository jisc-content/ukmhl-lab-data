FISH. 147 Keep on ice a plain border-mould, coat (chemiser) the bottom with a layer of aspic-jelly, and place all round the inside some halves of hard-boiled eggs, alternated with little groups of vegetables of different shades ; fill the mould gradually with the aspic. Fig. 48. An hour afterwards, turn the border out on a cold dish, and now fill the cavity of the border with a salad of mixed vegetables (see No. 217), thickened with mayonnaise ; but take care to dish it up in pyramids, against which apply the slices of lobster in circles, one above the other ; place the meat of the claws on the top, coat them, as well as the slices, with half-set aspic ; and serve separately a boatful of mayonnaise-sauce with eggs. 347. Lobster (cold) in shells (D. 49). — Cut up, in small dice, the Fig. 49. boiled meat of one or two lobsters ; put them into a kitchen-basin ; mix in a few spoonfuls of pickled mushrooms, or gerkins, cut like the lobster ; season, and let them pickle in oil and vinegar. Meanwhile, prepare a small stand in fat, decorated at the base, and forming a ‘gradin’ ; fix it on the centre-dish. When ready to serve, drain the ‘salpicon’ on a sieve, put it back into the basin, sprinkle over a pinch of chopped taragon, and thicken it, with a few spoonfuls of mayonnaise with eggs. 10*

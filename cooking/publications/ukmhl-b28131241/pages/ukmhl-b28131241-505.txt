435 GAME. - WILD-BOAR, BEAR. masked with white fat ; surround it, at its base, with a wreath of oak- or orange- leaves; garnish the bottom of the ‘pain-vert’ with ‘croûtons’ of aspic-jelly. This piece is dished up, to figure on the table. To serve, the head must be cut up, the neck in thin slices; let it be garnished with jelly, and handed round to the guests with the following sauce : Fig. 195. Berlin-sauce. — With three yolks of eggs, and a pint of salad-oil, prepare some I mayonnaise-sauce, proceeding as directed in No. 284 ; finish it with two or three tablespoonfuls of English mustard, and good vinegar ; then introduce into it a little more than its volume of very firm red-currant jelly in small dice ; mix the jelly without crushing it, and pour the sauce into a sauce-boat. This sauce it not over fine to look at, but certain to be much valued by ‘gourmets’. 975. Young boar (marcassin) cutlets, Roman fashion. — Cut slantwise twelve small young boar-cutlets, remove the sinewy skin, disengage the end of the ribs, let them macerate for twenty-four hours in a cooked marinade. Now drain them, spunge, and put them into a ‘sauté’-pan, with butter and oil; fry them quickly, turning them ; as soon as set, drain their fat, pour over them a little meat- glaze, reduce their moisture, drain them, and dish them in a circular order. Pour into the cavity some sweet-sauce (No. 951), a sauceboatful of which send up separately. 976. Bears’ paws, Russ fashion. — In Russia bears’ paws are sold \ ready skinned, as commonly, perhaps, as pigs’ feet elsewhere. Although this is a dish little known in central Europe, yet it may be appetising for the people of the West. Wash the bears’ paws, wipe, salt, and put them into a kitchen-basin; cover them with cooked marinade, and thus let them macerate for two or three days. 28*

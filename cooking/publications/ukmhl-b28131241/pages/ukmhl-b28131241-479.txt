409 GAME. — QUAILS, LAKES. 918. Cold-patties (D. 184). — With some short-paste spread a few small cold-patty moulds ; till them with a common preparation of raw liver-spain’. Cover them with a thin flat of paste, bake them in a slack oven. When the pies are taken out of the oven, let them cool ; cut open the lid, and remove part of the game Spain’ preparation ; then fill the hollow with the contents of Fig. 184. a little ‘terrine’ of fat-liver, cut them with a warm little tea-spoon ; raise the preparation in a dome above the edges of the paste. Place on the top of the preparation a little jelly-‘croûton’. Range the patties, in a pyramid, on a cold dish. 919. Small cold-patties Of larks (D. 185). — Bone seven larks, re- serving their heads; season, stuff them with a preparation, in the conditions prescribed in No. 897 ; shape them round, surround them with a strip of buttered paper, and Fig. 185. braise them short of moisture; let them cool, then pare, glaze them with a paste- brush, and mask them with a thin coating of aspic-jelly. On the other hand, bake twelve small channeled pie-crusts; when cold, mask them at the bottom, and all round, with a preparation of purée of cooked livers, diluted with a little ‘chaufroix’-sauce ; half-fill the crusts with chopped aspic, and set the ‘galantines’ thereon. Insert on the top of each a lark’s head, previously cooked, and glazed with a paste-brush. Dish the small patties then on a folded napkin.

Fig. 232. 505 SWEET ENTREMETS. FRITTERS, EGGS same tin-cutter, then place the fritters one by one, on a floured napkin, spread on a baking-sheet, and now let the paste rise, until elastic to the touch. Plunge the fritters, half at a time, into a frying-pan with not very hot incited fresh lard, or butter; cover the frying-pan, and three minutes after, uncover it, to fan the fat with a kitchen-fan, thus cooling the surfaces of the fat; turn the fritters over, continue fanning; when done, drain them with a skimmer, then roll them in powder-sugar, and dish them in a heap on a folded napkin. Fritters, if well prepared, should be of a tine brown color, having a white circle in the middle, such as represented by the drawing. 1135. Eggs ‘à la neige’, moulded (D. 233). — This new method of preparing eggs 'à la neige’, well deserves the attention of cooks. Whip up three or four whites of eggs ; when of a nice consistence, introduce into them a quarter of a pound of powder vanilla-sugar, breaking the preparation slightly; then pour it into a channeled-mould, provided with a cylinder, buttered, and glazed with sugar. Put the mould into a stewpan with warm water, poach the preparation for twelve or fifteen minutes in the ‘bain-marie’ ; remove the mould, and live minutes after, turn the ‘entremets’ out on a dish, on the bottom of which pour some English-cream with vanilla.

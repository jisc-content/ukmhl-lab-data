COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. IV U. D. 1869. I particularly call the attention both of epicures and of practitioners, to the collection of Bills'of fare of authentic origin, composed and executed by intelligent men; for these Bills of fare cannot fail to be of general, nay universal interest, independently of the useful information they may furnish on the subject of alimentary productions from all the points of our gastronomic geography. With these various claims I hope the ‘Cosmopo- litan Cookery’ will soon become popular throughout civilised Europe. Its happy début makes one feel confident of the success of the second edition, which I now offer to the public, and which is undoubtedly superior to the first essay.

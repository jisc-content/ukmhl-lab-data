SWEET ENTREMETS.. — CROQI'EMBOUCHE. 537 As soon as the sugar is quite cold, disengage the ‘croquembouche’ from the mould, and turn it out on a folded napkin. 1194. ‘Petits pains’, with almond-milk (D.259).— Place on a small baking-sheet, a dozen large ‘dariole’-moulds, which surround with pounded ice; adorn them at the bottom, and all round, with preserved fruits: angelica, pine-apples, or candied peel; taking care to dip all the details of the decoration, one by one, into half-set jelly. As soon as the moulds are quite caught and set by the cold, spread them with a thin layer of ‘blanc-manger’; when this layer too is set, till the hollow with a preparation of bavarian-cream with rice, mixed up with a ‘salpicon’ of pre- served fruits. When about to serve, dip the moulds into hot water, wipe them, turn the ‘pains’ out, and dish them in a pyramidal way. 1195. Mokha ‘croquembouche’. — Prepare some common ‘choux’- paste ; take it up with a tea-spoon in small pieces, which drop on the floured slab, and roll them with the hand to a round shape. Place these pieces at little distances on a baking-sheet, egg them, bake them in a slack oven. Let these ‘choux’, when baked, be the size of a cherry. When taken out of the oven, disengage them from the baking-sheet, let them dry in warm-closet for full an hour, being placed on a baking- sheet covered with paper. Take them up, one by one, with fingers; then dip slightly, on one side only, into some ‘cassé’-sugar ; then raise them against the insides of an oiled dome-mould, fixing them on iti superposed circles, one above the other: two persons are required for this operation. The sugar having cooled, turn the ‘croquembouche’ out on a pastry-gi’ille, and immediately mask it with a thin layer of cooked coffee-icing-sugar. The glaze having got firm, disengage the ‘croquembouche^ from the pastry-grille ; dish it on a folded napkin with any garnish.

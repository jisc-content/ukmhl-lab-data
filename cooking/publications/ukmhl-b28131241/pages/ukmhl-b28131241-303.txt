237 BUTCHER'S MEAT. — MUTTON. layers of bacon ; pour into it the preparation of calf’s liver, and place it in a small sauté-pan, with a pint of hot water, push it into the oven (at a slow heat), and poach the ‘pain’ for three quarters of an hour. If no oven be at hand, poach it in a stewpan with tire on its lid. When the ‘pain’ is done, take the mould out of the water, and allow it to cool for five or six hours. Dip the mould afterwards into boiling water, introduce the blade of a knife between the ‘pain’ and its sides, and turn it out on the back of a plate, removing carefully the layers of bacon ; smooth the surface with the blade of a knife, dipped in hot water : then glaze it with a paste-brush ; the glaze having cooled, set the ‘pain’ on a cold dish, taking it off the flat with a stewpan-lid ; sur- round it then with aspic-jelly, either chopped or in ‘croutons’, and serve. 558. Roast leg of mutton, with haricot-beans (D. 84). — It is not sufficient for a leg of mutton to be plump and fat, that the animal be of a good breed, it requires also to be kept long enough to be quite tender; without this indispensable condition, mutton is always tough. Neither the exact point that should be reached, nor the time requisite for its attainment, can be well described or precisely stated ; for this happy medium, for hanging after killing, must be subordinate to the variable influence of season and of climate. In some countries twenty-four hours may suffice to render a leg of mutton fit for cooking ; while in others eight or ten days will not be too much. It is a matter of appreciation, taught by experience; but in all ’cases, one should avoid the danger, of over-passing the extreme limit, beyond which, from an exaggerated period of hanging, the meat will become spoiled and quite unwholesome. The task of the physician is to restore the health, Fig. 84.

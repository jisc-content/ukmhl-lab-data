ENTREMETS OF VEGETABLES, EGGS, PASTE, etc. I have classed together, in this chapter, the ‘entremets’ of vegetables, eggs, and paste (farinages); as in a dinner their character is identical, and they may without inconvenience replace each other, being indiscri- minately served as ‘entremets’. ‘Entremets’ of vegetables, in their simpleness, are always well received at table, they hold an assigned and distinct rank in the order of a regular dinner, which would be incomplete without them. In plain dinners, ‘entremets’ of vegetables are not always served, especially when the removes and entrees are garnished ; but in choice din- ners they are obligatory. Paste-‘entremets’ (farinages) possess the double advantage, that, ac- companying a garnish, they may, in plain dinners, take the place of entrees. 982. ‘Surtout’ of polenta, Milan fashion. — Boil three pints of water, with a little salt in ; remove it back to the side of the fire, introduce into it ; fourteen or fifteen ounces of fresh odoriferous yellow corn semolina (semoule de mais), which let drop like rain into the liquid ; boil the liquid until thickened, then i introduce into it a piece of butter, whereon pour it into a buttered ‘timbale’-mould. ! Cover the preparation on the top with a buttered paper, and let it cool for four or five hours. The preparation having got firm, dip the mould into hot water, to remove the loaf of polenta ; wipe it inwardly, butter it anew, and bread-crumb it; put the ‘polenta’ carefully in again, then scoop out the loaf, by the aid of a knife and spoon, leaving at the bottom and sides, no more than half an inch thick of ‘polenta’, and taking care to remove the top whole, and keep it aside.

SWEET ENTREMETS. — CAKES. 547 Cut the baked biscuit up in round flats, but so graduated as to till up the dome ; raise these flats on a dish like a Neapolitan-cake, masking each of these flats with apricot-marmalade ; mask the surface with a layer of ‘meringue’, then adorn it with the cornet, in the manner represented on the drawing ; sprinkle over the decoration Fig. 266. fine sugar, and allow it to take a little color in a moderate oven. When the cake is taken out of the oven, garnish the cavities of the decoration with preserved cherries ; send up separately some apricot-sauce. 1211. Montblanc-cake (D. 267). — With some tartlet-paste (see No. 1101) line a flawn-circle, which is straight and rather high; immediately remove Fig. 267. the circle; then pinch the paste on the top, as well as against its outer sides ; wrap these then up in a strip of paper, which maintain in place with thread. Mask the paste inside, bottom and sides, with buttered paper; then fill the hollow with com- mon flour, in order to bake the paste à blanc. As soon as the flawn is taken out of the oven, unwrap it, empty it, mask the bottom, and sides all round, with a rather thick layer of apricot-marmalade ; spread then a layer of light ‘frangipane’ perfumed with orange. 35*

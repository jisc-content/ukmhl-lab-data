SWEET ENTREMÊTS, PASTRY, ICES, COMPOTES. Sweet ‘entremets’ are included in the arrangement of a dinner by the same right as all the other dishes [mets). In a classical dinner, the sweet ‘entremets’ must of' necessity be equal in number to the cold or warm ‘entrées’ ; but in many cases, ‘entremets’ of vegetables may be allowed to help the number of the sweet ones : a dinner without sweet ‘entremets’ can never be considered a complete, a perfect dinner. Sweet ‘entremets’ are common to all nations, where gastronomy is of any importance. I have even had occasion to observe, that this dish is not only highly appreciated every where, but that it is even the one usually most carefully managed by the cooks. In this chapter I include all sweet dishes, cold or warm, served at the conclusion of a dinner. I have even, from my desire to render this chapter more complete and useful, added ices and compotes. A cook certainly is not always bound to prepare the ices served at a dinner ; this being a thing for him sometimes quite impossible ; but nevertheless it is unques- tionably highly requisite for him, to be thoroughly well acquainted with this manipulation, and also to be able, in case of need, to prepare them for himself; if an occasion should, as in the course of his career it often will arise, for utilising all such points of culinary knowledge. The series of‘entremets’ here given is relatively a very numerous one; for the greatest part they are simple, and of very easy preparation, only a few of them being more complicated and luxurious. By these few pro- ducts of higher order, it has been my wish to initiate novices into that I ‘coquetterie’ of work, which always gives a higher finish and relief to the physiognomy of a dinner.

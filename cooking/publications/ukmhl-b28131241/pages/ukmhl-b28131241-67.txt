COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 1 SOUPS. Soups are served among all the Nations familiarised with gastronomy. The English, the French, the Germans, the Russians, and generally all the populations of the North of Europe, are fond of soups. In Russia, the soup often forms the most luxurious dish of a dinner, and alone costs more than all the rest of the dishes. If, in some countries, soups are served in different conditions ; it is not the less true, that they have a great importance everywhere.* In the North of Europe, and in England, the soups are preferably garnished witli meat, poultry, game, or fish. In France1 light garnishes are usually preferred. Purees, creams, and thickened soups, may be served without any; whilst liquid soups, consommes, and clear broths, always require garnish of some sort or other. The garnishes for soups may be more or less abundant and varied, according as they are destined for plain, or choice dinners. There are circumstances, when the soup has come to be regarded as one of the most important dishes of the repast ; in such a case every license is allowed, so long as it is served with those requirements, which its nature admits. Rut in a regular dinner, where dishes are select and distinguished, where the soup is only a relative accessory, it should make itself conspicuous only for its delicate richness at once and simplicity. But whatever be the * Soup is not in England, as in France, a dish, even at the daily dinner-table indispensable; but though it may be true, that soup is, for the most part, less generally used, at any rate in small and simple households; yet is it, however, undeniable, that as in every other gastronomic land in Europe, so in England, no dinner of distinction will be served, without including soup. Nor can soup be reckoned only as a customary dish; it is no less wholesome, and beneficial ; nay to exhausted appetites, and powers of digestion, even indispensable.

POULTRY. — GOOSE. Put into a flat stewpan about half a pint of 'béchamel-sauce a little consistent, add to it the trimmings of the truffles, and reduce it, gradually introducing into it a gill of melted glaze, or some good reduced gravy ; when of a good consistence, pass it, through a tammy, over the 'salpicon, and let the preparation cool on the ice. Take Fig. 148. it up afterwards, with a spoon, in parts of the size of a walnut; roll them into the shape of small pears, and wrap them up in a layer of rice, cooked ‘a l’Italienne’, and kept firm ; then bread-crumb the 'croquettes’, fry, and dish them on a folded napkin. 809.

In such condition one fat-liver alone may suffice for an entree ; but if smaller, two or three will be required. In all cases, one should try to get good livers, which do not deteriorate by the cooking. Take away the gall of the fat-liver; make on each side, of the smooth sur- face, transversal incisions; into which slip some thick slices of raw truffles, cut up slantwise off the centre.

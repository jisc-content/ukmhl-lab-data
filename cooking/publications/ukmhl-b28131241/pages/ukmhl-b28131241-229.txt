BUTCHER’S MEAT. By butcher’s meat is meant beef, veal, mutton, lamb, kid, and pork. Butcher’s meat, in its various extent, is, so to say, the nerve and soul of the kitchen. There is no fat dinner (diner gras), no festival, where it does not make a conspicuous figure. By the distinguished taste, or by the richness of its substance, the varieties of butcher’s meat are alike indispensable on the table, as in the kitchen. Indeed a classical dinner is not to be thought of, without large joints of meat; and, as for the kitchen, it needs their co-operation for the preparation of the broths, and succulent gravies, as well as for preparing most part of the sauces. Butcher’s meat is served, either as remove (relevé) or else as entree, but rarely as a roast joint; yet roasted or broiled meat is frequently served as an entree, as well as a remove.

The whiter sorts of meat, such as veal, lamb, and pork, on the contrary, require absolutely to be well done, and not juicy, in order to be palatable, and easy of digestion.

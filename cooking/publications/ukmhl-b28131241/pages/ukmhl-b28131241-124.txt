COSMOPOLITAN COOKERY. 58 152. Clam-cllOUder soup. — The ‘clam-chouder’ is an American shell - fish. Open four or five dozen clams, chop their flesh, put it into a deep and thickly buttered stewpan, add six onions blanched and minced, a dozen raw potatoes, peeled and cut in dice, a bunch of aromatics, a little salt, pepper, nutmeg, cayenne, and mace; moisten the whole with a sufficient quantity of wine and fish-broth, to cover. Set the stewpan on a brisk fire, let the liquid boil for twenty-five or thirty minutes, then remove it back, and add to the soup a bottle of Rhine-wine. Add a handful of bruised crackers, or else thicken with a piece of kneaded-butter, and finish the soup, introducing into it six ounces of good butter, after having removed the aromatics.

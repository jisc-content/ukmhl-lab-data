The force-meat being passed through a sieve, add a ‘salpicon’, composed of truffles, fat liver, and pistachios. Sew the ‘galantine’, tie it up in a fine cloth, truss it, and boil it in a ‘court-bouillon’ for two hours. Drain it after- wards, take it out of the cloth, wrap it up again; score, and roll it in a spiral way, forming it like a pyramid, in a stewpan, and round a dome-shaped mould. Let it cool entirely, take it out of the cloth, divest it of the thread, and put it on a decorated ‘pain-vert’, having on its centre a support in form of a dome. Adjust the head again (boiled separately) to the ‘galantine’, mask it with a thin coating of Montpellier-butter (see No. 85), ornament it with anchovy - butter, squeezed through a cornet ; surround its base with a thick string of jelly, and afterwards with a circle of hard-boiled eggs in quarters.

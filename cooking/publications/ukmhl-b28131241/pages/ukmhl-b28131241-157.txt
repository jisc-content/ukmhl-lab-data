Salad of (iershis) gudgeon-perch (D. 20). — The gudgeon- perch are found often enough in the markets of Germany, and even of Paris ; but at St. Petersburg they are most plentiful and most highly esteemed. They may be purchased alive, and are therefore naturally of more value and better quality. In its form the gudgeon-perch is exactly like the perch, only being much smaller: its flesh is white and dainty. With the gudgeon-perch an excellent soup is prepared in Russia. Take out the fillets of a few dozen ‘iershis’; trim, season, and range them on the bottom of a flat stewpan or baking-sheet, thickly spread with butter. Baste with a little white wine, poach them on a sharp fire, and cool them in their liquor. Drain them on a cloth, season, baste again with a little oil, and sprinkle over some chopped parsley. Dish them up afterwards, in a dome-like fashion, on the centre of an aspic-border, and mask with à layer of mayonnaise-sauce. Surround the dome at its base with a circle of halves of hard-boiled eggs, decorated with a round of truffles. Set on the top a half-egg, garnished with vegetables. Serve separately a boatful of mavonnaise-sauce. 210.

Divide them afterwards in two parts; season, and baste them with oil and vinegar, keep them thus for an hour ; then range them into an aspic border in alternate layers, masking each layer with mayonnaise - sauce ; mount them in a dome-like fashion, and cover the top also with mayonnaise-sauce.

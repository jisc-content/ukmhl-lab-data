FISH. 71 on a brisk fire. When the liquid is beginning to boil, remove it back, and keep the fish thus for forty-five or fifty minutes, according to the thickness of the flesh, and preserving the liquid always at the same degree, without allowing it to boil. Meanwhile, boil a middle-sized lobster in salt water, then pick its tail, taking the meat in one piece, without breaking the shell. Cut the meat in slices, which place in a small stewpan. Cut up the trimmings, and the meat of the claws, in small dice, and keep them covered. Fig. 10. Prepare a very smooth butter-sauce -, which finished, add the ‘salpicon’ of lobster, and keep it at the ‘bain-marie’. When about to be served, drain the turbot, take the string off the head, and slip it on to a large dish, the bottom of which is covered with an oval-shaped flat full of holes, and covered with a napkin ; it is hardlv necessary to mention, that the white side of the fish must be placed upwards. The cooked lobster is set on the centre of the turbot, on the shell of the lobster is arranged the flesh of its tail, cut up in slices, and the shell itself run through with a fliatclet’-skewer, garnished with a crayfish. The turbot is surrounded with fresh parsley, and the lobster-sauce is sent up separately. 168. Hot turbot-pie (‘paté-chaud’), Danish fashion. — Take a small raw turbot, or the half of a large one, remove its flesh, cut it across in fillets one inch wide, which put into a kitchen-basin, and season with salt and spices. Boil hard five or six eggs, cut them up in quarters, season them with salt and spices, sprinkle over some parsley, and keep them covered in a basin. Sift a pound of large semolina, so as not to leave in it a particle of flour ; then mix with it, one after the other, two yolks of eggs, rubbing it between the hands; spread it on a baking-sheet, and dry it in a hot closet ; rub it again, breaking all lumps, and boil it with a little butter in salted water, keeping it compact and dry.

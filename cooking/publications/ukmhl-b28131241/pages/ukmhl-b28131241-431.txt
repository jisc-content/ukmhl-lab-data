Ducklings roasted (D. 153). — The ducklings of Rouen are the most esteemed in France. Indeed, they are generally of a superior quality and remarkable beauty. Fig. 153. Get two fat ducklings, draw, wash them inwardly, and put inside a small bunch of aromatics ; singe them carefully, twist the legs over the drum-stick, and truss them, fixing this bone in upright position. Set them on the spit, and roast them by a good fire for twenty-five minutes, basting with a paste-brush dipped in clarified butter. A few seconds previous to taking the ducklings off the fire, salt them ; divest them of the string, and place them on an oblong dish, the breast towards the end of the dish. Put on the centre some water-cresses, and send up separately a sauceboat of good gravy.

PREFACE. 6 dishes prepared from cheese and eggs, for although many vegetarians do not use those foods they are not excluded from a broad vegetarian dietary. In the preparation of the present work the author desires to acknowledge the assistance he has received from the proprietors and chefs of various vegetarian restaurants, notably â€” The Charing Cross Vegetarian Hotel, the "Acorn," the " Central," the " Porridge Bowl," the " Apple Tree," &c. ; and he feels that the recognised excel- lence of the cuisine at these establishments will in itself be no small guarantee of the practical nature of the work.

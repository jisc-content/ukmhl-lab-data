BREAKFASTS. 33 The coffee should, if possible, be roasted not more than twenty-four hours before it is used. It should be ground as short a time as possible be- fore it is made. Fresh-boiled water at boiling-point must be used in making coffee, but the coffee itself must not be boiled if the finest aroma is to be preserved. Milk for coffee should be made very hot, but not allowed to boil. Cream should always be used as well. Coffee should never be allowed to stand long in metal, as it loses its aroma. If made in a pan or metal pot, it should be poured off into a hot jug. Freshly roasted and ground coffee of fine quality may be had at Is. 6d. per lb., and fine Mochas and other coffees at higher prices. Machines for roasting and grinding coffee at home can be procured in sizes to suit small fami- lies, and are strongly recommended to those who like really good coffee. To make Coffee in a Pan.

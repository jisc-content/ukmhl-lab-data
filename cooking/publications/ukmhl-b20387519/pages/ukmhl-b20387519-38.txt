34 PRACTICAL VEGETARIAN RECIPES. Coffee made in this way is strong enough to be mixed with, two-thirds of milk. To make Chocolate or Cocoa. Ingredients.—2 ozs. chocolate, 1 pint milk. Take 2 ozs. of any good plain chocolate, English or foreign. Place it in an enamelled pan with about two tablespoonfuls of water. Set it by the fire, and let it dissolve slowly. When the choco- late is all dissolved, add to it a pint of cold milk ; bring it gradually to the boil, and it is ready for use. Chocolate is much improved by frothing; but to do this properly, a French or Italian chocolatiere is required, with a whisk passed through the lid so that the chocolate can be whisked while coining to the boil. If cocoa is required for breakfast, the maker's directions, provided with the packets, may usually be followed, or it may be made as above. It must be remembered that all cocoa requires at least one minute's boiling—no mere pouring on of boiling milk or water will suffice to cook it thoroughly.

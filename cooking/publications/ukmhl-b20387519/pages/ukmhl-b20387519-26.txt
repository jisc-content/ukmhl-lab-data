22 PRACTICAL VEGETARIAN RECIPES. Wafer Oatcake. Ingredients.—| lb. oatmeal, water. Mix with the oatmeal nearly half a teaspoonful of salt. Pour over it a quarter of a pint of boil- ing water. Mix it quickly into dough ; turn it on to a board well sprinkled with meal; work very little. Poll it out as thin as possible, cut into rounds or triangles, and bake on a girdle or hot- plate. The excellence of both kinds of oat cake de- pends on the quickness with which they are worked, and the lightness of the handling. Oat-cakes, if not fresh made, should always be toasted a little before the fire, so that they may eat quite crisp. Cut in small rounds and buttered thickly with fresh butter, they are most acceptable at after- noon tea. Chestnut Cakes.

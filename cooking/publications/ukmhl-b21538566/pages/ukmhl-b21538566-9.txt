PREFACE. 5 trouble, and it is because our French neighbours spare neither in the exercise of the culinary art that they so greatly excel in it. Breakfast with them is never an expensive meal; but it is, as the celebrated chef said of his sauce, “ Prepared with brains.” If, then, thought is taken the day before for the morrow’s breakfast, it may be got up with little trouble and be both suitable and economical. Now the number of dishes used for breakfast is, in the majority of English families, very limited. Bacon and eggs are the staple, the former generally unsatis- factory, being either over or under cured, too salt or too new ; it is besides expensive, a large portion of it running to fat. New-laid eggs, when they can be procured in town, are very costly, they properly, after twenty-four hours, can only be described as fresh. The Cockney mind is not, however, very enlightened on this subject, and the vendors of eggs are persuaded, or at any rate try to persuade the public, that eggs are new-laid until they are “ an apology for pepper.” The British cook has no idea of making these London eggs more palatable by the exercise of a little skill or the addition of some sauce, gravy, or cold meat, generally at hand even in households of very modest pretensions.

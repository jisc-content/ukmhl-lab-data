33 THE BREAKFAST-TABLE. away every particle of skin, fat, or gristle ; cut it into slices lengthways as thin as possible, and then into neat pieces; make the roulades in the same manner as those of fillet of beef. They will take rather longer to cook. BEEF CUTLETS. Take the fillet as directed for roulades, trim away every particle of skin and fat, leaving only the delicate fillet, which cut into slices the third of an inch thick, lightly pepper and salt them and set them aside on a plate for two hours or more. Broil the cutlets slowly from five to seven minutes ; they should be somewhat underdone. The moment before serving place on each a small piece of the following mixture :—Soften a small piece of butter on a plate, put a few drops of essence of an- chovy, a pinch of salt and a grain of Cayenne pepper, and make quite stiff with chopped parsley, and if you like add a morsel of finely-minced shalot. Serve very hot and garnish with fried potatoes. MUTTON CUTLETS. It is often convenient to dress the loin chops for one or two persons as follows:—Trim away the fat, cut the meat neatly from the bones and divide each chop info two, egg and bread-crumb them, and fry in a little butter. Take the bones with an onion and make them into gravy, thicken this either with a cooked potato rubbed through a sieve, a little tomato sauce, or flour. c

55 THE BREAKFAST-TABLE. SPICED BEEF. For ten pounds of meat make the following pickle :— One pound of common salt, two ounces saltpetre, one ounce of cloves, half an ounce of allspice, half a pound of coarse sugar. Let all these ingredients be thoroughly pounded and mixed together. * Take ten pounds of the brisket of beef, rub it well with this pickle every day for a fortnight. When about to cook, roll it up as tightly as possible and tie it round with string, place it in a deep earthenware pan with a little stock, or water, and cover the top with suet; let it bake gently for four hours, or it may be boiled. When cold cut the string, and it will retain its form, glaze or cover with raspings. ROLLED BEEF. Choose a piece of the thick flank long enough to roll well—about four pounds will be enough for a small collaring tin. Put it into a pickle as directed for spiced beef. When about to cook take out the bones and gristle and remove all skin, roll the meat round, press it into the collaring tin and boil gently until it is perfectly tender. Put a weight on the top and let it stand until the next day. The bones, &c., taken out of the meat should be boiled in the water with it. PRESSED BEEF. Take a nice square piece of the thick flank, cure it

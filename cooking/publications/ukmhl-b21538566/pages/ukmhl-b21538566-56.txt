HANDBOOK FOR 52 fatter and not so large, the rolled thick flank is better. The mock brawn will suit most tastes better than the real, as it is less rich and it has the advantage of being very economical. GALANTINE. Salt the rind of a loin of pork for a few days. It must not have on it more than a quarter of an inch of fat. When required for use, soak it to make it roll well, lay it flat, and place on it a layer of lean ham, then one of sausage-meat, or other forcemeat, highly seasoned with pepper, salt, and sweet herbs mixed into a paste with an egg and one fourth of its weight in fine bread-crumbs, and made very tasty with essence of anchovy; pass a knife twice over a clove of garlic and stir the mixture, or, if not objected to, add a minced shalot. Forcemeat for galantine should always have fat in equal proportion to the lean, then it will not eat dry. On the forcemeat put a layer of cooked tongue, pig’s or sheep’s will do, if you have any pieces of game, fowl, or rabbit at your command, they make an im- provement. Add a few pistachio kernels, blanched, and mushrooms if they are to be had. On this press another layer of forcemeat as before, and then roll all up tightly in the skin, put it into a cloth and cradle it with broad tape. Boil it in weak stock, or, if you have none, water salted and peppered, an onion or two, some cloves, a little fat, and a few bacon bones.

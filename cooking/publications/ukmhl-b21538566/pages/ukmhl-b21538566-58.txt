HANDBOOK FOR 54 both until thoroughly done. The addition of pig’s feet or a little rind of pork thoroughly cooked is a great improvement. When done, carefully take the meat from the head, cut it up with the pork, mix with the brains and tongue, and finish as directed for brawn. YORKSHIRE BRAWN. Take a pig’s head and foot, thoroughly cleanse them, cut the head and ears up, put it into a stewpan, cover it with water, and add a teaspoonful of salt, a good pinch of pepper, and chopped sage. Place it on the fire until it boils, then simmer gently until all the meat is off the bones. Take it up and chop it in a hot basin, add all the liquor in which the meat was boiled, stir up well and put it into earthenware jelly moulds. This is very good, but will not keep long in warm weather. PRESSED OX CHEEK. Thoroughly cleanse an ox cheek. The whole or a portion may be used, as convenient, boil it gently in salted water with an ox heel or pork skin, when both are thoroughly done take out all bones and chop up the meat, and having seasoned it highly with pepper, salt, and a little allspice, press it into the collaring tin and finish as for brawn. The liquor this is boiled in will make excellent soup.

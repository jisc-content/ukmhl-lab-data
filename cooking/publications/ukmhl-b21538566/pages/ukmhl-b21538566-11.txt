PREFACE. 7 either with or without skins, and they are not so ex- pensive as when bought at good shops. Dried fish, of various kinds, is much used with us; of it can only be said, it may be relishing, but it is neither cheap nor wholesome. Chops and steaks are excellent in their way, but both are expensive; and the former appear too often to be relished when piquant sauces do not go well with tea and coffee. Of the steaks need it be said how often they are tough ? “ Then what are we to have ?” cries the perplexed housewife; “ every thing nice is so expensive, and it is most difficult to provide variety from cheap materials.” To this I submit that, although the price of pro- visions is at the present time enormous, and the general cost of living most serious for small incomes, the chief difficulty does not lie in the expense, but in the want of skill in making the most of things, and also in the want of forethought and management. Take, as an illustration, a loin of mutton—either roasted or cut into chops it is very expensive ; but if you take out the fillet and use for roulades, as directed in the following recipe, or simply cut it into neat cutlets and fry them (it may be done without injury to the upper cut of the joint), and you get dish No. i. For No. 2, cut the meat off nearly level with the chop

29 THE BREAKFAST-TABLE. LOBSTER EN BEIGNETS. Preserved lobster answers very well for these. Bray and Hayes’, imported by Crosse and Blackwell, is the best. Divide the lobster into as nice pieces as you can—the smaller answers well for sauce or scal- lopping—and dip each into a good frying batter, as directed for ox brains, but adding to it a little Cayenne pepper and a few drops of Burgess’s essence of an- chovies. Fry the beigncts quickly in oil, or good fat, and serve hot. SCALLOPED LOBSTER. Take either fresh or preserved lobster, and coat it well with a sauce made like melted butter, with milk, equal proportions of corn-flour and flour, and a good quantity of butter, and made very tasty with essence of anchovies and Cayenne pepper. The sauce must be very thick, or it will make the scallop eat soddened. Spread a layer of sifted bread-crumbs on a tin or earthenware dish, previously rubbed with butter, then put in the lobster, then another layer of crumbs, with a few sifted raspings on the top, and bake as quickly as possible. Preserved oysters may be scalloped in this manner.

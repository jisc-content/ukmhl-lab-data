50 HANDBOOK FOR THE BREAKFAST-TABLE. break on the top of the mince an egg to each person, strew over them a dust of fine raspings, pepper, and salt, put in the oven until the eggs are set, not hard, and serve with fried croutons round the dish. TRIPE EN PATE. Tripe that has been stewed until very tender, with plenty of onions and well seasoned, is best for this dish. Cut the tripe into pieces about an inch and a half square, dip each into a batter made like that for ox brains, and fry. COW HEEL. Stew it after it comes from the shop, with plenty of onions, pepper, and salt, until perfectly tender. Cut the meat into neatly-shaped pieces, egg, bread-crumb, and fry them. Take care the bread-crumbs are well seasoned. Tomato sauce, or a little strong gravy, should be served with this dish.

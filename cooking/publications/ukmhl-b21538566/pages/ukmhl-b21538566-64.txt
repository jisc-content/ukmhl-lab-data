HANDBOOK FOR 6o of soda in the teapot has been a good deal decried, nevertheless, the water of certain districts will not make good tea, and in such cases the use of minute portions of fine carbonate of soda, whilst on the score of health unobjectionable, will add greatly to the enjoyment of the “ cheering cup.” Water should never be allowed to boil longer than a minute before making tea. This is so well known to tea-tasters in the City, that they will not attempt to decide on the merits of any sample if the water in which it has been infused has continued in ebullition after reaching the boiling point. Earthenware teapots are the best; they are made now in great variety, at prices ranging from pence to shillings. If, however, one of silver or other metal is preferred, care should be taken that it is kept bright inside as well as out, and that it is never put away after use without being thoroughly dried.

It is a mistake, however, to suppose that coffee to be good must be strong. “ Coffee should never be boiled,” said a French lady to her English cook.

i6 HANDBOOK FOR the allotted time has expired. Four minutes will set a fresh egg, three one kept some time. It is a good plan, if eggs are boiled by the clock, on putting them into the saucepan to say to oneself, on noting the time, “They must boil until,” for instance, “one minute past number three,” or “ one minute to num- ber six,” as the case may be; thus the time for taking up the eggs is impressed on the memory, and if other things engage the attention, this is important. Egg- glasses are by no means infallible guides; they get out of order in some mysterious manner; it is far better to go by the clock. Some people think that cooking an egg in hot water, without allowing it to reach the boiling point, makes it lighter for invalids. As the yolk only should be eaten when the stomach is very delicate, this slow process is not necessary. Lightly boiling will make the egg more palatable, and, besides, the raw look of the white when otherwise cooked is apt to disgust. The eggs of some kind of fowls, and those which have been preserved, have often such thin shells that they are with difficulty kept from bursting in boiling. It will generally be found that this will be prevented by putting the eggs in a sauce- pan of cold water over a brisk fire, and when they boil taking them up, or, if required very well done, allow- ing them to continue boiling for one minute. This manner of cooking eggs, however, demands the most “wisdom,” as the time in which they are coming to the boiling point must vary, and, of course, they will be cooked before they reach it if the process proceeds slowly.

Many of the recipes are equally suited to early or late breakfasts, or luncheons, and it is because it is so difficult to select from an ordinary cookery book such dishes as these that this little Handbook for the Breakfast Table has been written. It does not pretend to give directions for every well-known breakfast dish, but rather to supplement these by some novelties, which have also the merit of being as economical as the present price of provisions will allowâ€™.

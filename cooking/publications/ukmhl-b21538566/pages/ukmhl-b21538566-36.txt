3 2 HANDBOOK FOR ROULADES DE BOEUF. To make these a fillet of beef must be procured. One of the most convenient ways is to remove the fillet or under-cut of the sirloin before roasting. The under-cut of the rump, known as fillet steak, is however equally suitable for the purpose. There need be no waste in its use, as all the trimmings can be made into pies or stews for the second table. Cut as many slices as you require roulades, as thin as possible, lay one at a time flat on the board, cover it with a very thin slice—not quite so large as the beef— of well-cooked bacon, then roll it up very tightly, egg it over, roll it in finely-sifted bread-crumbs, very highly seasoned with pepper and salt, then put it on a skewer in such a manner as it will keep its shape nicely. As the remainder are prepared place them on the skewer, not too close together; four will be suffi- cient to place on each skewer. Put into the frying- pan a small slice of butter, and when it boils put in the ro7ilades, and let them cook gently on one side for ten minutes, when they should be crisp and brown, then turn them on the other side and finish. A very little concentrated gravy thickened may be poured round the dish immediately before serving, or they may be sent up without it. The remains of a roasted fillet of beef or of sirloin are excellent used for roulades. ROULADES OF MUTTON. Remove the fillet from a fine loin of mutton, trim

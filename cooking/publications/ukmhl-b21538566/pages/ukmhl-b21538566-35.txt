A portion slightly rubbed with vinegar, then sprinkled with pepper and salt, and hung in a cool place for a day, makes an excellent roast. From the remainder you can have roulades and cutlets, or the materials for pie or mince. If charged as fillet usually is, at steak price, it ought to be cut free from skirt, and with but little suet. It will be observed that butter is directed for frying little dishes. This may seem an extravagance, but as, if properly employed, a very little will serve, it need not be so. The great cooks say use enough butter to cover whatever you are frying, and it is all very well if you can afford it, or happen to live where butter is cheap; but, for the most part, if the pan be no larger than necessary, and the article frying be turned once or twice, it is surprising with how small a piece you may manage. Of course any other kind of fat may be substituted, and if care is taken that whatever is used is kept to boiling point, the flavour of the dish will not be seriously impaired. For frying pate, or light batter, the fat of the stock- pot is excellent. A good mixture is made by melting beef suet, and adding to it an equal quantity of lard. It is almost useless to say oil is good for most frying purposes, because that generally attainable has so strong and disagreeable a flavour it is no wonder a prejudice exists against it. Like most other things, however, excellent oil is to be obtained in London by those who will take the trouble to seek it, and who can afford to pay for it.

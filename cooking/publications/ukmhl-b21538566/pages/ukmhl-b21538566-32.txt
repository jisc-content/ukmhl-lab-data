28 HANDBOOK FOR RECHAUFFE OF TURBOT. Cut the pieces neatly from the bone, lightly pepper, salt, and flour them. Have a little butter in the frying-pan, and let the fish cook gently, until warm through and a nice brown; or the pieces may be brushed over with yolk of eggs, crumbed lightly with seasoned raspings, and then fried quickly in a little butter. RECHAUFF& OF COD. Take the fish from the bones, making sure none . are left in it. Make a sauce by boiling the bones and skin in broth, and afterwards reducing it to a very small quantity by boiling rapidly without the lid of the stewpan; use to this an equal quantity of cream or milk, flavour nicely with Burgessâ€™s essence of anchovy, Cayenne pepper, and salt; then make it very thick with equal quantities of corn flour and flour. Stir the fish into this sauce whilst hot. Spread a layer of finely-sifted bread-crumbs on a buttered dish. Lay the fish on this, then cover over thoroughly with another layer of crumbs, put a little dissolved butter over it, and bake a quarter of an hour in a quick oven. If you have any oyster or lobster sauce left it will answer well to mix with the fish, instead of making fresh, only it must be very thick, as when the dish goes to table it ought not to be moist. Turbot, or indeed almost any fi$h, is good re-warmed in this way, and the addition of any shell-fish is always an im- provement.

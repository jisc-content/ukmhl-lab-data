HANDBOOK FOR THE BREAKFAST-TABI.E. 62 keeping the pot filled up with water, and skimming as directed. A very cheap and useful beverage, and perfectly wholesome, is made from cocoa shells. A pound costs but threepence. Proceed as for nibs, but allow a breakfast-cup of shells to a quart of water. Among the most recent preparations of cocoa Van Houten’s may be cited as the best. It is not mixed with starch or sugar, and has all the fine aroma of pure cocoa. GILBERT AND . RIVINGTON, PRINTERS, ST. JOHN’S SQUARE, LONDON.

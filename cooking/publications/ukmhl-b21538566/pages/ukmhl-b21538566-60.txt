56 HANDBOOK FOR as in the foregoing recipes, boil it in stock with a bay- leaf and an onion and a bundle of sweet herbs. When perfectly tender place it between two dishes with heavy weights on the top. The next day turn it neatly and glaze. This looks nice, and is improved if, when cold, it is cut to the size of a deep tin dish, and when placed in it a clear meat jelly is poured over so as to run well underneath it. When turned on to its dish to be served, the meat should be found covered with a bright, clear jelly, a quarter to half an inch thick. ROLLED TONGUE. Cure as directed for rolled beef. Boil it until very tender, and having skinned the tongue, and cleared away all gristle and bones from the root, roll it round whilst it is hot, and press it into the collaring tin. Press it, and allow it to stand twenty-four hours. Tongue rolled is far more economical than when served in its natural form, and is very delicious. GLAZE. The proper glazing for hams and tongues is expen- sive to buy, and somewhat troublesome to make. The following is cheap and very easily made :â€” Put a quarter of an ounce of gelatine into a jelly- pot with four tablespoonfuls of water. Let it simmer in the oven until quite thick, then add browning (burnt sugar), to make it the colour you wish.

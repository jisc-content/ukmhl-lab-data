EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. 230 pomatia) was from 2s. to 3s. per hundred, while those from the hedges, woods, and forests, brought only Is. 6d. to 2s. He further adds, that in the vicinity of Dijon the proprietor of one snailery is said to clear nearly £300 a year by his snails; and also that there are exported from Crete annually about 20,000 okes (each nearly 31bs.) of snails, valued at 15,000 Turkish piastres. M. Renou (as quoted by M. Cailliaud of Nantes), in a curious account, read in 1864 before the Academical Society at Nantes, on the importance that the ancients attached to snails, observed, that during 1862 and 1863, the escargots brought to the Marche de la Bourse, at Nantes, on Sundays and fete days, amounted in number to 996,000, producing the sum of 2490 francs.* M. Roux, superintendent of the Clos de Yougeot, and neighbouring vineyards, gave, in the ‘ Union Bourguignonne/ some details of the operation of clearing the vines of snails. The Clos de Yougeot vineyard yielded fifty-five double-decalitres (each thirty- five pints); Romanee-Conti, six; Chambertin, six; Per- riere and Plante-Chaude, three; in all, seventy. It was calculated that these snails would have eaten up buds, the produce of which, M. Roux estimated at from fifteen to twenty pipes of wine, without reckoning the injury to next year’s growth. The cost of clearing these snails in the fifty-five hectares of the vineyard in question amounted to 120 francs, a mere trifle compared to what was saved. It is further stated that these mol- lusks were sold at a remuuerative price, as, when sold in Dijon, Lyons, and especially in Paris, they repre- sented a value of several thousand francs.f * ‘ Catalogue des Radiaires, des Annelides, des CirrliipSdes,’ &«., par Frederic Cailliaud, de Nantes, p. 222. f ‘ Morning Post,’ May 8tli, 1868.

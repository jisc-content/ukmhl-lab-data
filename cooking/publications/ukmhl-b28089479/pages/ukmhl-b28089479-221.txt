MURICIDjE. WHELK. 205 and that vast heaps of the shells of the Murex had been discovered.* Aufrere, in 1789, describes a hill called Monte Tes- taceo, behind the Alcantarine Convent, at Tarento, consisting chiefly of the shells of Murex brandaris which were supposed to have produced the purple dye,f and according to Dr. Bizio, the Tyrian purple was pro- duced from this Murex brandaris, and the amethystine .purple from Murex Irunculus. Romulus employed the purple dye for the trabea. It was purple and white, something similar in cut to the toga, and was the royal robe worn by the early Icings. Servius mentions two other kinds of trabea besides the one already described, one wholly of purple, which was sacred to the gods, and another of purple and saffron, which belonged to augurs. Julius Caesar appears to have been the first of the Ro- man emperors who wore the toga entirely of purple. As long as the Empire of the East lasted, this dye continued to be appropriate to imperial use. Its manufacture seems to have expired with the capture of Constantinople by the Turks, for, in 1464, Pope Paul II. authorized the substitution of scarlet for purple in the vestments of the church.| The best purple dye was stated by the ancients to be exceedingly durable; and when Alexander took pos- session of Susa, he found amongst its treasures 5000 talents in weight of purple cloth, from Hermione in the Peloponnesus, which had been laid up there for 180 years, and yet retained all the freshness and brilliancy * Pliny, ‘ Nat.

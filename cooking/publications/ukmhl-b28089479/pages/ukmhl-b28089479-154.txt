EDIBLE BRITISH JIOLLUSCA. 138 carry the seed of oysters is a well-known fact, since the walls of sluices newly erected are often covered with them. In the island of Re the existence of oyster- beds, however, no longer depends upon this contin- gency, they being now in a state of permanent self- reproduction. Again, in some localities it is sufficient to prepare the emerging banks for collection, to see them soon covered with seed; but in other places nothing would be obtained without transplanting proper subjects. The concession of emerging banks is anxiously applied for by the inhabitants of the coast, —the more, so, as improvements in the working of this branch of trade are of daily occurrence. Thus, Dr. Kemmerer, of Re, covei’s a number of tiles with a coating of a kind of mastic, brittle enough to enable him to detach the small oysters from it. When this coating is well covered with seed, he gets it off: all in one piece, which he cari’ies to the place where the seed is to grow. The same tile he coats a second time, and so on.” In France, oysters having a green tint are con- sidered great delicacies, and the art of greening oysters is carried to the greatest perfection on the coasts of Aunis, whence come the celebrated green oysters of Marennes. They receive their colour and peculiar flavour when transplanted to certain beds or claires, which, at the approach of winter, are lined with a kind of vegetation, which disappears in the spring; and the oysters are said to owe their colouring to the absorption of the chlorophyl with which the waters of the claires are saturated. It is a fact that the oyster assumes its green colour when the claire grows green, and loses its colour when the claire is deprived of its vegetation. Some have thought that the greeniug

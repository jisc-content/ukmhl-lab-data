No commendations they need lack ! ” Oysters are very beneficial to persons who suffer from weak digestions, but then they must be eaten raw, and without vinegar or pepper, and I have known an invalid able to eat oysters when quite unable to take any other food; and oysters are also recommended for consumptive patients. Mr. Frank Buckland gives the following description of the composition of an oyster, viz., the chemical ingredients contained in them, “ Oysters con- tain a great deal of water of the same composition as sea-water; namely, hydro-chlorate of soda, hydro- chlorate of magnesia, sulphate of lime, sulphate of soda, and sulphate of magnesia, phosphate of iron and lime. Then they contain much osmazome, or creatine. You cannot see osmazome very well, but osmazome is the smell of roast beef. It is the same thing as the essence of meat. The oyster also contains a certain quantity of gelatine and mucus, which renders it so digestible, and thirdly, it contains an animal material of which phos- phorus is the principal ingredient. Phosphorus is the principal brain-making form of food that we can take, and therefore those who are fond of literary pursuits, who have to work hard, always find that oysters will bring them better up to the mark than any other form of food that they can take.”* In China, fresh oysters are used to cure freckles.

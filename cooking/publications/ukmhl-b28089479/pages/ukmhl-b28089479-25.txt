9 MYAD.&.—GAPER. the spoon-shell, probably owing to the wide spoon- shaped tooth in the left valve. The length of a full- grown specimen is about 3 inches, by 2^ in breadth. Mya arenaria is larger than My a truncata, longer and more pointed at the gaping end, equally coarse and rugged in appearance, its colour varying according to the nature of the soil in which it buries itself. Montagu states that this species is eaten at South- ampton, and called “old maid but upon making inquiry there I cannot discover that they are now known by that name. In Chichester harbour and in Fareham Creek the poorer classes collect them for eating, and call them “ pullers.” At Youghal the name for them is “ sugar-loons,” and in Dublin “ colliers,” and at both places they are considered good bait, and fit to eat; but at Youghal they warn you to be careful to take off the skin which covers the outside of the shell and tube, as it is supposed to be poisonous. However, it is probably harmless, except iu cases where it causes indigestion; but I believe Mya arenaria has been known really to disagree with some people, and Miss Ball mentions a friend being very uncomfortable after eating one. The Hampshire people do not seem to have noticed this peculiarity. I cannot let this opportunity pass without expressing my sincere thanks to Miss Ball for much valuable in- formation, which she kindly sent to me from Ireland, respecting the various edible mollusks. Mya arenaria (Mye des sables) may occasionally be seen exposed for sale in the market at Bordeaux. It is the Soft Clam of America, and there it is most highly esteemed as food, and also as bait.

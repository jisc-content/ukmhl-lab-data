He adds that these mounds of cockle-shells are about eighteen to twenty feet high, and that the Chinese immigrants have largely employed them as a source of lime. These mounds are supposed to be of great antiquity, from the fact of the shells being partly cemented together by crystallized carbonate of lime, the result of the very slow action of atmospheric and aqueous influences. At the bottom of one mound which contained 20,000 tons of shells, a human pelvis was found; and other remains and stone-implements have been obtained from the Chinese lime-burners. Mr. Earl attributes the formation of these mounds to the Semangs, a diminutive negro race, now sparingly scattered over the surrounding country, but who were evidently very numerous and widely spread in former times.* In Grey's ‘ Australia/ vol. i., mention is made of a hill of broken shells, which it must have taken cen- turies to form, situated between Port George the Fourth, and Hanover Bay. “ It covered nearly half an acre of ground, and in some places was ten feet high ; it was situated over a bed of cockles, and was evidently formed from the remains of native feasts, as their fire- places and the last small heaps of shells were visible on the summit of the hill."

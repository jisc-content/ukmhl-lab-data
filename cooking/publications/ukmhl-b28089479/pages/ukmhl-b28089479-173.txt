157 OSTREADjE . OYSTER. grated or rasped fine, put this into the stew-pan with a few sour tamarinds (if they are to be obtained, if not, a sour apple chopped). Let the whole simmer over the fire until the apple is dissolved, and the cocoa-nut very tender; then add a strong thickening made of flour and water, and sufficient salt, as a currie will not bear being salted at table. Let this boil up for five minutes. Have ready also a vegetable marrow, or part of one, cut into bits, and sufficiently boiled to require little or no further cooking. Put this in with a tomato or two; either of these vegetables may be omitted. Now put into the stew-pan the oysters, with their own liquor, and the milk of the cocoa-nut, if it be perfectly sweet ; stir them well with the former ingredients; boil the currie, stew gently for a few minutes, then throw in the strained juice of half a lemon. Stir the currie from time to time with a wooden spoon, and, as soon as the oysters are done enough, serve it up, with a corre- sponding dish of rice on the opposite side of the table. This dish is considered at Madras the ne plus ultra of Indian cookery.”* “ To Stew Oysters.—Take the oysters clean from their liquor. Let the liquor stand till it is clear ; then put a little of it to the oysters, and stew them; then put to them a little white wine, a little cream, a little lemon-juice, and a bit of butter ; shake them together, then serve.”f “ American Box Stew.—For six people open six doz«n of oysters, put them in a basin with their own liquor. Place in a stew-pan a pint and a half of milk and a quarter of a pound of butter, pepper and salt to taste; * Miss Acton’s ‘ Modern Cookery Book,’ taken from 1 Magazine of Domestic Economy.’ MS. Book.

62 EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. The British method of rearing mussels differs from that of the French. By the latter, endeavours are made to intercept the spat, as we have already seen, and by the former, the young mussels are removed from the grounds where they have been deposited, as soon as they are sufficiently large, to positions up estuaries, at some distance from the sea, where they are uncovered at low-water. They grow and fatten by the admixture of the fresh-water with the salt-water.* The Billingsgate market is chiefly supplied with mussels from Holland, the east coast of England, Corn- wall, and Devonshire, in August and September; though smaller quantities are received from other parts of our coasts, besides those above mentioned. About ten or twenty tons' weight arrive at a time, though, of course, the quantity varies according to the season, and they are sold at Is. a measure. In the evidence given before the Fisheries Commission at Exeter, Decem- ber 24, 1863, it was stated, that the price of these shellfish taken in the estuary at Lympstone, was 8s. per sack of ten pecks, but that the supply was de- creasing. Mussel culture is now successfully carried on, on the Boston Deep beds. Mr. Frank Buckland stated, in his examination before the Select Committee on Oyster Fisheries, in 1876, that, since the Lynn and Boston cor- porations have taken the beds under their protection, the mussels have increased immensely. The average value of these shellfish in the Lynn Deep alone, is about £3400 a year. There are 16 bags, or 32 bushels, in a ton of mussels, and each ton is worth about £1. * * Fish and Fisheries/edited by David Herbert, M.A. ‘Best Means of Increasing Mussels/ &c., by J. C. ilcocks.

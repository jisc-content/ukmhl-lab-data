EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. 28 brightest I ever found was near Dawlish; it was mauve colour, with white streaks. The largest are dredged at Tenby. In Ireland, at Youghal, in Birterbury Bay, in Con- nemara, and in Ban try Bay, Tapes av/rea is said to be eaten, but it is not a common species, though locally abundant; and in the spring numbers are found in the Scilly Isles. At Falmouth, it is brought to market with Tapes decussata from Helford, and both kinds are called “ hens.” The Spaniards prize the Tapes highly, as I pre- viously observed. At Cadiz, shellfish are considered good if people drink too much wine, and consequently they are often introduced at festasj and no food is considered by the Spaniards so nourishing as shellfish for those who work hard. It is a rule at Spanish tables to hand round white wine with shellfish, though with other things they use any wine indiscriminately, and the wisdom of this custom is proved by experience. Indeed serious illnesses are often caused by taking port wine with oysters, lobsters, &c.; the astringent qualities of port, having the effect of hardening the shellfish, and some- times producing violent indigestion. In Paris not so very long ago, we might have read amongst the many varied signs, the following, “ le vin blanc, bon pour les hmtres.” The following recipes for cookiug the Tapes are from Cadiz. Tapes Soup—Sopa de Almejas.—Wash the shells and put them into a saucepan with a little water, then put them on the fire for a few minutes to open them. Pick the fish out and put them into a clean saucepan, with an onion chopped very small, salt, pepper, and butter.

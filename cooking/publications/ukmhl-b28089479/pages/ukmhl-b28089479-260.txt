When they are cooked and tender, pour over them a thickening of yolks of eggs with chopped parsley; the addition of nutmeg and lemon-juice makes them more savoury.* The inhabitants of Central France use several sauces for snails, and the four principal are the following, ac- cording to Dr. Ebrard, viz.: — “L’ayoli, or ail-y-oli, of Languedoc; a paste made with olive oil and pounded garlic.” “ L’aillado, of Grascony; a most complicated sauce of garlic, onions, chives, leeks, parsley, &c., with spices, cloves, and nutmeg, the whole thickened with oil.” “La limassade, of Provence, called La vinaigrette in Paris.” “La cacalaousada, of Montpellier, composed of flour, ham, sugar, &c. At Bordeaux the aillada is softened with a mixture of bread, flour, and yolk of egg, boiled with milk.” Stuffed snails are also considered very good. A fine stuffing is made with snails previously cooked, fillets of anchovies, nutmeg, spice, fine herbs, and a liaison of yolk of eggs. The snail-shells are filled with this stuffing, then placed before the fire, and served very hot. In some countries Blainville states, that snails are eaten, smoked and dried. * Dr. fibrard.

EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. 32 * 1 The Fisheries of the Adiiatic,’ by George L. Faber. may also be included in our list of “ edible mollusca,” though it is not sufficiently abundant to form any more than a rare and dainty dish with us ; while in the Mediterranean, it is a common species; and ac- cording to Mr. Faber,* it is also abundant in the lagoons of Venice, and on the sand-banks of Grado on the Austrio-ltalian coast, and the shells are exported for miniature painting. It is however, found at Hayle, Cornwall, and may be gathered at the lowest spring tides. They burrow in the sand, and it requires some skill and quickness to catch them, as they retire so rapidly. The fisher- men called them “ cocks ” and told me they usually cooked them by boiling, but that they did not often eat them. I have taken them near the mouth of the river Helford, where they appear to be tolerably abun- dant; and in that neighbourhood the local name given to this species is the Cram. I was so fortunate as to procure a dozen beautiful specimens from Plymouth, besides those from the Helford river; the largest measuring 24 inches in length and 3^ in breadth. The colour is a pinkish- brown, with rays of a darker shade; the epidermis is of a pale horn-colour, and transparent, showing the rays of the shell through, and is very glossy. The shell itself is solid and opaque. Specimens sent to me from the Mediterranean are the same as those found on our coasts, both as to size and colouring; but this is not the case with some of our other bivalves,—the Isocardia Cor, for instance, attaining a larger size with us, than it does in the south of Europe.

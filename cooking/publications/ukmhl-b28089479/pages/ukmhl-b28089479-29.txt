Many persons like the addition of a wine-glass of vinegar.f To Fry soft Clams.—Get them taken from the shell, as they are very troublesome to clean. Wash them in plenty of water, and lay them on a thickly folded napkin to dry out the water; then roll a few at a time in wheat flour, until they will take up no more. Have a thick-bottomed frying-pan one third full of boiling hot lard, and salted (in proportion, a table- spoonful of salt to a pound of lard), lay the clams in with a fork, one at a time-; lay them close together and fry gently, until one side is a delicate brown, then turn carefully and brown the other; then take them off and put on a hot dish. When fried properly, these clams are very excellent.J Fam. SOLENIDiE. SOLEN.—RAZOR-SHELL. Solen Siliqua, Linnaeus. Razor Shell. — Shell straight, open at both extremities.

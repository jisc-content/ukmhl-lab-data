228 EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. quantities of Helix aperta, for food for the higher classes at Rome, where it is known by the name of Honacello. The shell is of a yellowish-olive colour and nearly translucent, thin, and of an ovate-globular form. It has a large mouth, with the peristome white, and the whorls four in number. In the heat of summer, and during the winter, this Helix, like Helix pomatia, buries itself in holes in the ground, shutting up the aperture of its shell with a calcareous epiphragm. Two of the specimens I have in my collection, which came from Italy, still have this epiphragm very per- fectly preserved, and it is glossy, and slightly convex. Theophrastus, in his ‘Treatise upon Animals which live in holes/ states that snails have the habit of burying themselves. He says, “ Snails live in holes during the winter, and still more in summer, on which account they are seen in the greatest numbers during the autumn rains. But their holes in the summer are made in the ground, and in the trees.* Helix nemoralis is also eaten, and at Toulouse sells for five or ten centimes a dish ; but by some, snails with striped shells are not considered good, as they have a bad taste and smell. M. Moquin-Tandon pur- chased, in 1847, in the market at Toulouse, a basket containing four hundred specimens of Helix aspersa, for sixty centimes; and another, with 1503 specimens of Helix nemoralis, for seventy five centimes—making fifteen centimes the hundred for the former, and a little less than five centimes for the latter. Helix nemoralis, and Helix hortensis, are known by various names in France; for instance, “ at Bordeaux they are called Demoiselles; Mogne at Libournes, Limaio at Agen, * Athenams, * Deipn ' vol. i. p. 104.

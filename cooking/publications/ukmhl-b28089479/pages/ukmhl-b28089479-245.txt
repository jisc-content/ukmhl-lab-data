229 HELICIDtE. SNAIL. Moli-morno at Limoges, Limed a at Montpellier, Livree in the north of France, and Garacolo in the Pyrenees.5’* Helix pisana, which is a very local species with us, and only found at Tenby (where I have seen it in profusion), at Manorbeer, in Cornwall, Jersey, and Ireland, is greatly prized as an article of food abroad, and is larger than it is with us, indeed, almost as large as Helix nemoralis. At Marseilles the average sale of Helix pisana and Helix rhodostoma, is about 20,000 kilogrammes, at three francs the fifty kilogrammes, which makes the sum of 1200 francs. By the sale of our common garden snail (Helix aspersa) the same price is realized, and that of Helix vermiculata amounts to 4800 francs. It is also stated that in the market at Dijon is sold, annually, about 6000 francs worth of the vine snail Helix pomatia (the escargot par excellence, and called also Luma, Gros luma, and le Moucle de vigne) at one franc fifty centimes per hundred.f In Italy the vine snail is known in some places by the name of Bovolo. In Corsica the same species are eaten, as those above men- tioned, and it is said that, in the Island of Re the sale of these Helicidee amounts annually to 25,000 francs, but probably this sum is exaggerated. In Burguudy, Champagne, and Franche-Cotnte, a great quantity of snails of all kinds are consumed, and also sent to Paris; and Professor Simtnonds mentions that (in 1859) there were fifty restaurants, and more than 1200 private tables in that city, where snails were considered a delicacy by from 8000 to 10,000 consumers ; that the monthly consumption of this mollusk was estimated at half a million ; again, that the market value of the vineyard snail (vine snail, Helix * Dr. Ebrard, ‘ Des Escargots.' f Idem.

EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. 252 this), as the following1 account taken from Mr. A. E. Verrill’s ‘The Cephalopods of the North-Eastern Coast of America/ will prove. He mentions the early litera- ture of Natural History containing allusions to large species of Cephalopods, accompanied by more or less fabulous and usually exaggerated descriptions, as for instance the one given by old Eric Pontoppidan, which I shall quote further on. Professor Steenstrup, and Hr. Harting were the first to describe and figure these Gigantic squids scientifically. The American fishermen frequently meet with these big squids, in the waters of Newfoundland and the adjacent coasts; and the cod- fishermen who visit the Grand Banks, appear to have been long familiar with them, and occasionally to have captured and used them as bait. The whalemen state that the sperm whale feed upon huge squid, and that when wounded they often vomit large fragments of them in such a condition as to be recognizable,* and this statement is corroborated by Mr. R. Warrington, of Apothecaries* Hall, who informed Mr. H. Woodward that the test of the genuineness of “ Ambergris ” as imported, which is found in the sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) is, that it is full of the undigested beaks of the Galamary, upon which it feeds; and one of the “Delphinidas/* the Hyperoodon, or Bottle-lieadcd whole, is also said to feed upon cuttle-fishes, as Mr. W. Vrolik found in the stomach of one specimen about ten millions of the mandibles of a species of Loligo.f According to Mr. H. Woodward, the undigested remains of fossil cuttle-fishes are frequently noticed within the ribs of the Ichthyosauri, and Plesiosauri of * Maurz’s ‘Sailing Directions,’ as quoted by Mr. A. E. A errill. + Description de ‘ Deux Cephalopodes gigantesques,’ par P. Harting.

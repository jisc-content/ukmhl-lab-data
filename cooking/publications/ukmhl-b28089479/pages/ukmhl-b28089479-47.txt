31 VENERID.E. —PULLET. I This coarse, rough-looking shell is found on many parts of the coast of the English Channel, also in the Channel Islands, and in Ireland. Mr. Hanley* states, that at Herm, near Guernsey, it is collected as an article of food from the small pools between the rocks at low water; and Dr. J effreys says that it is habitually eaten in County Clare, and that Weinkauff mentions its being sold in the market at Algiers. It is a common species on the south coast of Ireland, and Mr. Damon, of Weymouth, on visiting Henmare, found that OAving to the great consumption of Venus verrucosa for food, the species was nearly exhausted. It is dug out of a sandbank at low spring tides, at Bantry. M. Charles Bretagne, Member of the Societe Imperiale d’Acclimatation, wished to try and pro- pagate it on the coasts of France, from Toulon to Menton, and the Due de Monaco conceded the right to establish banks for the rearing of oysters and la Praire, as this Yenus is called in France.f The stock of the latter would have to be brought from Mahon, as it is not found in any quantity on the coast of Provence. Dr. Paul Fischer observes that it ought to thrive well at Arcachon if cultivated, as it is in- digenous there. It has several names by which it is known in Spain ; viz., Maclo cuadrado, Carneros, Gurrianos y Feriguetos, Gredas, Escwpinas grabadas, and at Naples, Taratufolo and Camadid, and in Sicily, Vongulo.

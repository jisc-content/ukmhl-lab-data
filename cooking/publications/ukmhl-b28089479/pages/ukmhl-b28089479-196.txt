130 EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. The Ear-shell, Ormer, Oreille de Mer, or Si-ieu (six yeux), is said to take its place in the British fauna solely on account of its being found in the Channel Islands, where it is very abundant; but it is still more so on the coast of France, between St. Maio and Gran- ville, and great quantities are brought from thence to the Jersey market, which is well stocked during the summer, and they are sold at the rate of sixpence a dozen. They are also sold in the market at Cherbourg, and said to be found on the rocks of the breakwater. This celebrated shellfish has been praised by old authors as a most delicate morsel. One writer speaks of the Ormer, or Anris marina, as “a lump of white pulp, very sweet and luscious/’ and another, as quoted by Professor Ansted, in his ‘ Channel Islands,’ mentions “ a large shellfish, taken plentifully at low tides, called an Ormond, that sticks to the rocks, whence we beat them off with a forck or iron hook. ’Tis much bigger than an oyster, and like that, good either fresh or pickled, but infinitely more pleasant to the gusto, so that an epicure would think his palate in paradise if he might but always gormandize on such delicious ambrosia.” Athenmus also tells us that the coTia, or ears, are most nutritious when fried. Again, he says, “ But otaria (and they are produced in the island called Pharos, which is close to Alexandria) are more nutritious than any of the before-mentioned fish (speaking of cockles, sea-urchins, pinnas, &c.), but they are not easily secreted. But Antigouus, the Carystiau, says this kind of oyster is called by the iEolians the ‘ Ear of Yen us.’ ”* Captain Beechey, in his ‘ Voyage to the Pacific,’ * Atheuams, ‘ Deipu.’ vol. i. bk. iii. 35, p. 146.

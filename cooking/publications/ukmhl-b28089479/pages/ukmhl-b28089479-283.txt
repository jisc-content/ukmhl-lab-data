SEPIAML—CUTTLE. I 2G7 them and cut them in pieces, season with scallions and onions, and add a little vinegar towards the end.

Montpellier Method of Cooking Sepiola Rondeletii.— Stuff it with a force-meat of fish, then fry the arms and cut them in pieces, and place them round the dish.* In Spain the cuttle-fishes (Sepiola and Loligo ?) Ca- lamares are eaten, either broiled on a gridiron, or stewed in red wine in an earthern jar; after which you may boil them if you like, or serve them in wine, or stew them, adding, after they are tender, a little flour, and the yolk of an egg, well beaten, and this is con- sidered the most wholesome way of dressing them. At Palma, Majorca, they are usually stuffed with a force-meat, and I found them most palatable, the flavour resembling that of the lobster. In Andalusia the Calamar, or Choco, is much prized, and is very plentiful; and Major Byng Hall mentions them as one of the great treats of the natives of Madrid, f Another species of Octopus, viz. Eledone moschatus, which is found in the Mediterranean, is eaten by the lower classes in Italy, either boiled, fried, or made into a ragout; and in Sicily and Sardinia, where it is abun- dant, the fishermen use it largely for food.J They know it by the following names, Muscardino, Muscarolo, and Folpo da risi. * Ozenne. f ‘ The Queen’s Messenger.’ $ Ozenne.

EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLHSCA. 140 whose trade was not very extensive, procured a few thousand oysters from Falmouth, and, out of thirst for gain, he sent them off to Rochefort, before they had sojourned more than three weeks in the beds set apart for their purification. These oysters caused alarming symptoms, and M. Cuzent, being called upon to test them, as they had been seized in the market at Roche- fort, found copper in them, the quantity being about twenty-three centigrammes per dozen oysters.* I have elsewhere given an account of the finding of copper in the Falmouth oysters; one of the tests used by M. Cuzent was so very simple, that any one might discover the presence of copper. It is as follows :—An ordinary needle is thrust into the green part of the oyster, and then the mollusk was immersed in pure vinegar. When copper was present, thirty seconds sufficed to cover the portion of the needle embedded in the oyster with a red coating of copper, f The amount of shell-fish consumed in Paris annually, including lobsters, crayfish, oysters, &c., is immense. In 1867, the consumption of oysters in Paris was 26,750,775, of which the greater portion came from Courseulles-sur-Mer, and from Saint Vaast-de-la- Hougue.J In the ‘Revue des Deux Mondes/ Janvier ler, 1884, it is stated that the consumption of oysters in Paris alone was 2,000,000. Oysters are not packed in barrels, as with us, but at the restaurants and in the wine-shops are seeu very shallow baskets, in shape resembling a small shield, with a thatching or wall of straw on either side, risiug * ‘ Galignani’s Messenger.’ t ‘ Field,’ March 14th, 1868.

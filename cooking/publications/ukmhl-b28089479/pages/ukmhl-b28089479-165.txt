149 0STREAD2E. OYSTER. the Republic of Venice. In the ‘ Intellectual Observer/ vol. i., p. 483, is an account of an “ oyster-shell ” island, by M. Aucapitaine, on the east coast of Corsica, com- posed of layers of shells, bearing some resemblance to the shell-mounds of St. Michel-en-l’Herm, in La Vendee. This island is formed of still-living species, and is between three hundred and four hundred yards in circumference, the greatest elevation about thirty yards, and the mean elevation rather more than two yards above the level of the sea. The Romans are said by the fishermen to have deposited the shells of the oysters there, which they salted for exportation, but M. Aucapitaine does not believe in the artificial origin of this island. According to M. de Quatrefages, the shell-mounds of St. Michel-en-l’Herm are composed of oyster, mussel, and scallop shells, of the same species as those living now in the neighbouring seas. Many of them have their valves still connected by the ligament which forms the hinge, and they have not even changed colour. The three banks of St. Michel-en-l’Herm are about seven hundred and thirty yards in length, three hundred in width, and rise about ten to fifteen yards above the level of the surrounding marshes. Mr. Buckland mentions a large heap of oyster-shells in Galway Bay, at a place called Creggauns; another south-west of Tyrone, and one at Ardfry Point. The Creggauns heap consists principally of the shells of the oyster, mussel, and common cockle, though the whelk, Pecten varius, periwinkle, limpet, Nansa reticulata, Helix nemoralis, Trochus,and Venerupis decussata (Tapes cbicuxsata ?), are also found in it. There are layers of wood-ashes and stones, apparently used as hearth-

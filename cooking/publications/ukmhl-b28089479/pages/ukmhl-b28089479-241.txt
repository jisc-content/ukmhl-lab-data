In Lorraine, a corner of the garden is often given up to the snails, surrounded with a fine trellis-work to prevent their escaping, and all kinds of vegetables are placed inside which are most appreciated by them. During the winter, the “ escargots ” (their shells beiug closed with their epiphragm) are kept in pots, jars, or baskets, in a dry cold place. The vine- growers in the neighbourhood of Dijon keep them in a dry cellar, or dig a trench in the vine-slopes, placing at the bottom some leaves, then their snails, covering them with more leaves and a few spadefuls of earth. In Silesia, the snails are fed with marjoram, wild thyme, and aromatic plants, to give them a flavour. Ulm, in Wurtemberg, is celebrated for its “ escar- gotieres,” and, according to Marteni, more than ten millions of Helix pomatia are sent away to different gardens and “ escargotieres ” to fatten, and when ready for table are sent to various convents in Austria for consumption during Lent.* Helicidce are considered rather poor food, and there- fore suitable as Lenten fare; and this peculiarity has given rise to a singular custom near Bordeaux, men- tioned by M.

The consumption is considerable, and a dish of twenty-five snails costs one franc fifty centimes.

Dr. Ebrard in his pamphlet * Des Escargots,’ mentions those of Bruuswick and Copenhagen, which latter furnished snails for the tables of the noble Danes, in the eighteenth century. Q

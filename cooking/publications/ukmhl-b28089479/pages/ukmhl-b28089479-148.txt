EDIBLE BRITISH MOI.LUSCA. 132 was an oyster-fishery in Poole Bay, and that though the town of Poole claimed much dominion in this bay, the Lord of Corfe Castle had a power and jurisdiction, as Admiral by Water and Land, on the seas round the Isle of Purbeck, on the high seas, and throughout the whole island, in pursuance of a grant by Queen Eliza- beth to Sir Christopher Hatton. The fishermen of Wareham, upon paying a small fine to the Lord of Corfe Castle, have a right also to fish in these waters. A considerable oyster-fishery was carried on at Poole, which supplied the London markets for two months every season, and no less than forty sloops and boats were employed, during which time the receipts were between £6000 and £7000. The last day's catching, by a prescriptive regulation, was thrown into the channels in the harbour, where the oysters were left to fatten, and supply the town and neighbouring county during the winter. In digging a dock at Ham, opposite the harbour, in 1747, a large bed of oyster- shells was found, six feet and a half thick, regularly piled up. This bed had been formed by the fishermen, who deposited the shells after they had taken out the fish for pickling, &c., without breaking the ligatures; this was the custom in the 17th century, which in 1640 and 1670, induced the Corporation (who imagined that such encumbrances might injure the channel) to cause the fishermen to open their oysters in the boats, and throw the shells on the strand, by which that hill of shells was raised, which at high water is surrounded by the sea, and called “ Oyster bank.”* The late Duke of Northumberland introduced oyster * ‘Topographical and Historical Description of the County of Dorset,’ by John Britton, Esq., and Mr. E.

224. EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. contain about ten quarts. Pliny in bis letter to Sextus Erueius Clarus, says (complainiug of bis not fulfilling bis engagement to sup with bim) :—“I had prepared, you must know, a lettuce apiece, three snails, two \ggs, and a barley-cake, with some sweet wine and snow.”* In Sir Gardner Wilkinson’s ‘ Dalmatia and Monte- iegro/be tells us that the Illyrian snails mentioned by ’buy are very numerous in Veglia or Veggia, the Jyractica of Strabo. Both Helix pomatia and Helix aspersa are eaten abroad to this day, and formerly in England, according to Dr. Gray, the glassmen at Newcastle indulged tliernselves in a snail-feast once a year, and collected them from the fields and hedgerows on the previous Sunday. Addison, in bis c Travels,’ mentions having seen a snail garden, or “ escargotiere,” at the Capucins, in Friburg. It was a square place boarded in, filled with a vast quantity of large snails. The floor was strewn about half a foot deep with several kinds of plants, for the snails to nestle amongst during the winter. When Lent arrived, their magazines were opened, and a ragout made of snails. In Barrois, an “ escargotiere ” consists of a cask with the head staved in, covered with a net; or a square hole with the sides lined with wood, and fastened over at the top with an iron trellis, or with a simple hurdle made of light osier-sticks. The snails are placed in as they find them, until there are sufficient for a repast, or for sale. They are also kept in these places till they are ittened, or till they close their shells with their piphragm, which enables them to be more easily * Pliin’s ‘ Letters,’ vol. i. p. 30.

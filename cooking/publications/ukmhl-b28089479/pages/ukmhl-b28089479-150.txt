EDIBLE BRITISH JIOLLUSCA. 134 were taken. The Burran Bank oysters are highly esteemed in Dublin, and are called “ Burton Bindons/’ They are brought from Kilkerran and Rossmuck Bays, in Galway, and are laid down to fatten on the Red Bank Oyster-bed in Aughinish Bay. Formerly Mr. Burton Bindon was the possessor of these beds, but now Mr. Singleton has succeeded him, as we are informed by Mr. Buckland, who visited these and other oyster-beds on the west coast of Ireland, the east coast of England, and also those on the west coast of France. There are oyster-beds in the Shannon, said in 1836 to yield a revenue of £1400 ; and formerly, a small bed in Cork harbour, of no great extent, but the oysters were large, and prized for stewing; however, I am told that the latter no longer exists. In Lough Swilly there are oyster-beds, but the oysters were getting very scarce in 1876, and it was proposed having what is called in Ireland, a jubilee, viz , closing the banks, or a portion of them, for two years, and preventing the picking or taking of small oysters.* Oysters are increasing in scarcity and dearness in Ireland and in England, and this may be traced in a measure to the inci’eased de- mand, the railroads conveying the oysters into the country; aud Mr. Farrer stated, in the evidence before the Committee on Oyster Fisheries, in 1876, that oyster cultivators had great difficulty in obtaining oysters to fatten, because they were taken into the manufactur- ing districts, where the people eat them though in bad condition; whereas they formerly had them brought to the beds in the Thames. It is said that over-dredging has destroyed many of * ‘ Report on Oyster Fisheries,’ 1876; Mr. Blake’s evidence.

TELLINID^E. PSAMMOBIA. 19 its contents; for tlie farmers, who use it as manure; and that out of the heaps of sand, &c., formed on the quay, the Psammobia and other shells are collected. It is only a locally abundant species; but is generally diffused. Large richly-coloured specimens are found in Birterbury Bay, Connemara; and Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Northumberland* Pembrokeshire, Firth of Forth, and the Channel Isles, are a few of the localities given by Dr. Jeffreys. Athenaeus* states that Tellinidae were very common at Canopus, and abound when the Nile begins to rise, and that the thinnest of these were the royal ones, which were digestible and light. For fish-sauces, both the Psammobia and the Donax, or Wedge-shell (which belongs to the Tellinidae also), might be substituted instead of cockles; and, indeed, a species of the latter, which with us is very rare, viz., Donax trunculus, is sold in the markets at Naples, and is said by Poli to be one of the best kinds of shellfish, both for making sauce and for seasoning small rolls of bread. I have often watched the women at Yiareggio fishing for the Donax and the Mactridae. They dress themselves in their husbands' or brothers' old garments, and stand in the water to the waist. They use a kind of net made of a piece of thin light wood, oval-shaped at one end and straight at the other. This is surrounded on the upper side by a small frame-work about six to eight inches deep, except at the straight end, and covered with sail- cloth or some such material, to keep in the sand and shells. To this is attached a wooden handle about four to five feet in length. They hold the net before them in * Athen. Deipn.â€™ vol. i. bk. iii. c. 40. c 2

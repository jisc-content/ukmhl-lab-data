OSTREA/Mi. OYSTER. 139 of the Marennes oysters was due to the essentially argillaceous soil of Marennes, to the brackish waters of the Seudre, or to oxide of iron ; but at La Trem- blade, where the greening process is also carried on, it is attributed as much to the action of fresh water as to the nature of the soil, and reeds grow on the edges of the claires which could not grow in salt water. The greening takes place in a few days. A fortnight is sufficient when the claire is in the humour. But the greatest care must be taken not to empty the claire, as it would be a long time before it became green again.* Oysters are imported into Marennes for fattening and rearing from all parts of France, and the number in 1880-81, including Portuguese oysters, amounted to 130,000,000. In 1882, Marennes sent out 151,000,000 oysters, representing a value of 5,900,000 francs.-j- Some years since these Marennes oysters were so much in demand, that the white oyster-beds in the neighbour- hood had become insufficient to stock these peculiar beds where the creature acquires the green colour and delicious taste which causes the Marennes oyster to be so eagerly sought after. White oysters had therefore to be imported from Spain, Brittany, Ireland, and England. A considerable quantity of oysters were at one time imported from Falmouth, and these contain copper, which imparts an acrid taste. They were gene- rally, on their arrival, deposited in certain beds apart from the others, and there kept for six months, after which it was proved by experience that they lost their copper, salt, and bad flavour.

Our Scotch pearl-fishery has, within the last few years, been revived, and in 1860 Mr. Moritz Unger, a foreigner, on making a tour through the districts where the pearl-mussel abounds, found that the pearl-fishing was not altogether for- gotten, many of the people having pearls in their pos- session, of which they did not know the value. He purchased all he could obtain; consequently, in the following year, many persons devoted their spare time to pearl-fishing, and during the summer months made as much as £8 to £10 weekly. The summer of 1862 was most favourable for fishing, owing to the dryness of the season, and the average price was from £2 6s. to 10s.; £5 being a high price. They now fetch prices varying from £5 to £20. The Queen purchased one Scotch pearl for 40 guineas; others at high prices have been bought by the Empress of the French and the Duchess of Hamilton, and Mr. Unger had a neck- lace of these pearls valued at £350.* In 1867, at the September meeting of the ‘ Perthshire Society of Natural Science/ attention was called to the pro- bability of the ultimate extinction of the pearl-mussel TJnio margaritiferus in the rivers near Perth, owing to the quantities destroyed in search of pearls, thousands of shells being left on the banks of the rivers where * The ‘ Times,’ December 24, 1863.

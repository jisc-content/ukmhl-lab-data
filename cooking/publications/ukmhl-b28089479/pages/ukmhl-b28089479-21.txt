PHOLADID^E. PIDDOCK. I that part of the shore where these mollusks bury themselves, is left exposed by the tide, they are all killed. He was in the habit of collecting the Pholas dadylus as bait for white fish, digging them out of the clay or shale; and he added that if he kept them a day or so before using them, they changed colour, aud shone like glowworms, even shone quite brightly in the water, some distance below the surface, when put on the hooks for bait. This reminds me of the follow- ing quaint lines in Breton's f Ourania,’ quoted in Daniel’s f Bural Sports — “ The glowworme shiniDg in a frosty night Is an admirable thing in Shepheard’s sight. Twentie of these wormes put in a small glasse, Stopped so close that no issue doe passe, Hang’d in a Bow-net and suncke to the ground Of a poole or lake, broad and profound. Will take such plentie of excellent fish As well may furnish an Emperor’s dish.” The luminosity of the Pholas after death is referred to by Pliny, who says, “ The onyches shine in the dark like fire, and in the mouth even while they are eaten;”* and, “ that it is the property of the dacytlus (a fish so called from its strong resemblance to the human nail) to shine brightly in the dark, when all other lights are removed, and the more moisture it has the brighter is the light emitted. In the mouth, even while they are eaten, they give forth their light, and the same, too, when in the hands; the very drops, in fact, that fall from them on the ground, or on the clothes, are of the same luminous nature.” + * Pliny, ‘ Nat. Hist.’ vol. ii. bk. ix. c. 51. Throughout this volume I have used the translations of Pliny and Athenseus in Bolin’s Series of Classical Authors. + Idem. vol. ii. bk. ix. c. 87.

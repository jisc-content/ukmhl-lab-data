254 EDIBLE BRITISH MOI.LUSCA. barbed points, sunk into the soft body. To the grapnel they had attached a stout rope which they had carried ashore and tied to a tree, so as to prevent the fish from going out with the tide. It was a happy thought, for the devil-fish found himself effectually moored to the shore. His struggles were terrific as he flung his ten arms about in dying agony. The fishermen took care to keep a respectful distance from the long ten- tacles, which ever and anon darted out like great tongues from the central mass. At length it became exhausted, and as the water receded it expired. The fishermen, knowing no better, proceeded to convert it into dog’s meat. It was a splendid specimen, the largest yet taken, the body measuring twenty feet from the beak to the extremity of the tail The circumference of the body is not stated, but one of the arms measured thirty-five feet. This must have been a tentacle. Twenty other specimens are mentioned by Mr. Verrill, and their dimensions given. It is not only on the north-eastern coasts of America that these gigantic cephalopods have been met with, for Mr. W. H. Dali, discovered a large and very in- teresting species, viz., Onychoteutliis robusta, near Iliu- link, Unalashka Island, off the coast of Alaska, in 1872, thrown upon the beach, and Mr. T. W. Kirk, in the ‘Transactions of the Wellington Philosophical Society,’ October, 1879, describes the occurrence of five specimens of giant cuttle-fish on the coast of New Zealand, of the species Architeuthis Mouchezi(?). The cuttle-bone of one, when first extracted, measured six feet three inches in length, and eleven inches in width.* * ‘ The Cephalopods of the North Eastern Coast of America,’ Parts i. and ii., by A.

PATELLIDJ8. LIMPET. 177 The women of the Andaman Islands wear various ornaments, and, according to Mr. Ball, the most, ex- traordinary are the skulls of their defunct relatives, festooned with strings of shells, which some of them carry suspended from their necks.* Limpet shells are used for mortar. In the island of Herm, near Guernsey, poultry are fed on Patella vulgata ; but it is said that they will not touch Patella atheletica, which is also considered too tough for bait. Sea-birds feed on the Patella, and Mr. Gatcombe, in the Field, August, 1863, mentions having once taken from the gullet of an oyster-catcher upwards of thirty limpets. He also adds an account of a curious occur- rence which took place on the Plymouth breakwater some time ago, “ One of the workmen employed on the breakwater observed a sandpiper fluttering in a peculiar manner, and discovered, on approaching it, that it had been made prisoner by a limpet. It would appear that in running about in search of food, the bird's toe had accidentally got under a limpet, which, suddenly closing to the rock, held it fast until the man came up, who with his knife removed the limpet, and released the bird." The Cornish giant, Tregeagle (who is said to have been a wicked seigneur, once residing in a mansion on the site of Dozmare, or Dosmery Pool, by which it was engulphed, and his park transformed into the barren waste now known as Bodmin Moor,) is supposed to haunt Dozmare Pool, and is condemned to the hope- less task of emptying it with a single limpet shell, which has a hole bored in it. Tregeagle was not an * ‘ Jungle Life.’ N

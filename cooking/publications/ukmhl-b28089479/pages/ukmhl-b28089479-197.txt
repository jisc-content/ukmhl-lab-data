HALIOTIDAL EAR-SHELL, OR SEA-EAR. 181 mentions the abundance of two species of Haliotis in the Bay of Monteroy, and that they are much sought after by the Ind aus, not only for food, but because the shells are used for ornaments, and the natives decorate their baskets with pieces of them. Haliotis gigantea is eaten by the Californian Indians, and the Chinese are very partial to Venus’s-ears, which form part of a Chinese dinner, with sea-snails, shark’s fins, &c. The Koreaus dry great numbers of Haliotis and string them upon rattans for the Chinese market, and they sell at the i-ate of 300 for a dollar.* The shells of Haliotis tuberculata are said by M. Debeaux to be used in medicine by the Chinese. The Japanese also use the Haliotidse as food, and make them into soup. The large Haliotis gigantea they call Awabi, and Haliotis swpertexta is Tolcobushi. f The natives of New Zealand call Haliotis iris the mutton fish. The Guernsey ear-shells are used by farmers to frighten away small birds from the standing corn—two or three of these shells being strung together and sus- pended by a string from the end of a large stick, so as to make a clattering noise when moved by the wind.J Haliotid/s in great quantities are brought to Bir- mingham from various parts of the world, for making mother-of-pearl ornaments, buttons, and inlaying papier-mache tables, &c., and this latter art of orna- mentation was introduced by George Suter, a decorator in the employ of Messrs. Jennens and Bettridge, who patented the invention in 1825. An instance has been * ‘Travels of a Naturalist in Japan and Manchuria,’ by Arthur Adams, F.L.S., II N. + ‘ Japan,’ by J. J. Itein.

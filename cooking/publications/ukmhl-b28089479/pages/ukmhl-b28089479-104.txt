EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. 88 “ As soon as a pinna is discovered, an iron instrument, called pernonico, is slowly let down to the ground over the shell, which is then twisted round and drawn out. When the fishermen have got a sufficient number of them, the shell is opened, and the silk, called lana penna, is cut off the animal, and, after being twice washed in tepid water, once in soap and water, aud twice again in tepid water, is spread upon a table, and suffered to become half dry in some cool and shady place. Whilst it is yet moist, it is softly rubbed and separated with the hand, and again spread upon the table to dry; and, when thoroughly dried, it is drawn through a wide comb, and afterwards through a narrow one.

It is then spun with a distaff and spindle, two or three threads of it being mixed with one of silk, after which they knit, not only gloves, stockings, and waistcoats, but even whole garments of it. When the piece is finished it is washed in clean water mixed with lemon-juice; after which it is gently beaten between the hand, and finally smoothed with a warm iron. The most beautiful are of a brown cin- namon, and glossy gold colour. A pair of gloves made of the Pinna silk may be seen in the British Museum; and in the International Exhibition some articles made of it were exhibited in the Italian Court, viz., a large shawl, gloves, and specimens of the thread in skeins.” As an article of food, the Pinna is nearly as good as the scallop, and Plutarch tells us that Matron, the

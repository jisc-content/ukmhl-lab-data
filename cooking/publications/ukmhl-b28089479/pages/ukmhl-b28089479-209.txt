193 MURICIDjE.—WHELK. Whelks are sold at Is. 6d. to 2s. a measure ; and are in season from August to September, though they are really good to eat at any time. Children are frequently seen buying a saucer of whelks in London in the spring ; and the shellfish shops near Billingsgate market are well stocked with them. There are, as Woodward remarks, two different shellfish sold in London under the name of Whelks or Buckies, namely, the common Buccinum undatum, and the more prized Fusus antiquus. Whelks are very troublesome to the lobster-fishers, for they often devour the bait, and I have seen at St. Margaret's-at-Cliffe, on the Kentish coast, the lobster-pots drawn up, one after the other, baitless, and full of these greedy mollusks; most trying to the poor fishermen, especially when bait was scarce, and they had been obliged to walk some miles in the morning to purchase it. On some parts of the coast the fishermen use the Bucnnum for bait for the long-line fishing, and Mr. Smethurst, of Grimsby, says that when the fishermen get on to what is called the “ shawl ” of the Dogger Bank, in the spring, when the fish (such as cod, ling, halibut, skate and haddock), begin to accumulate in the warm weather, whelks are used as bait, and that when they fished at the north end of the Dogger, at the fall of the year, and in deeper water, lampreys were used along with whelks.* The Lamprey (Petromyzon jluviatilis) is considered very valuable as bait, and in the winter and spring numbers are found in the river Trent, at Sawley, in Leicestershire, and are collected in baskets from the weirs to which they adhere, and sent off alive iu * * Mollusks, Mussels, Whelks,’ &c., by Charles Harding.

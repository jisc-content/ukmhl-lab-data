PECTINID2E. SCALLOP. 105 is called the Sand-clam. Lutraria maxima is called the Great clam, as we have already seen. In America, Mya arenaria is the soft clam, and Venus mercenaria the hard clam, and it is from the shell of the latter that the wampum, or Indian money, is made, although other shells are used for the same purpose; the white “ wampum ” beihg made sometimes from the Bahama conch, or strombus.

The worth of wampum is regulated very much by its free- dom from white and by the intensity of its blue or purple. The manufacturers prepare two kinds, which are of different value. According to their deepness of blue, or freedom from white, is the estimation in which the pieces and strings are held. Formerly the price of a horse, a pack of beavers, or anything else, could be estimated exactly in strings and pieces of wampum. Belts are made of pieces of wampum strung together, and it is believed that the Indians adapt and arrange them in such a manner as to be significant like writing. Belts of wampum are, therefore, mostly delivered at treaties, and on great public occasions. In ‘ Flint Chips/ Mr. Stevens mentions that Mr. Granville John Penn, a descendant of William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania, had until quite recently in his posses- sion, the belt of wampum, the sole title-deed of an

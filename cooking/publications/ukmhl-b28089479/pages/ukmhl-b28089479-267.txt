SEPIADjE CUTTLE. 251 which they call Chatrou (or La pieuvre), is a most formidable enemy to swimmers and divers, for when it has embraced the limbs with its tentacles, it adheres with such tenacity that it is quite impossible for a person to disengage himself, or to move any of his Vmbs.* The common Octopus punctatus of the west coast of .North America is the largest of its tribe hitherto studied; but the gigantic squids far exceed it in size, as we shall read presently. Mr. W. H. Dali, in the f American Naturalist/ 1873, tells us that this species of Octopus occurs abundantly at Sitka and there reaches a length of sixteen feet on a radial spread of nearly twenty- eight feet, but the whole mass is much smaller than the decapodous (or ten-armed) ceplialopods of lesser length. In the Octopus above mentioned, the body would not exceed six inches in diameter, and a foot in length, and the arms attain an extreme tenuity towards their lips. Dr. W. 0. Ayres informed Mr. Terrill, the writer of the above, that he has often seen thi3 species exposed for sale in the markets of San Francisco, where it is eaten by the French, and that specimens with the arms six or seven feet long are common; and Professer W. H. Brewer states that he has seen speci- mens in the same markets which spread fourteen feet across the outstretched arms.f The ten-armed Ceplialopods, or Gigantic squids, attain larger dimensions than the Octopus, viz. the species of Architeuthis (a genus which is closely allied to Ommastrephes), Ouychoteuthis robusta (or Lestoteu- * * Life in Normandy,’ note.—D.

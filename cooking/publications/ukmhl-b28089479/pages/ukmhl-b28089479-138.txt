EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. tlie animal, doubtless by muscular contraction, exerts a strong force upon the contained water, while it re- laxes the forced contact of the lips at any point of the circumference, according to its pleasure. The result is, the forcible ejection of a jet of water from that point, which, by the resilience of its impact upon the surrounding fluid, throws the animal in the opposite direction, with a force proportioned to that of the jet d’eau.” Again, Mr. Gosse adds, “ That the Pecten widely opens and forcibly closes its valves if left un- covered by the water, is, doubtless, correct. I have seen my specimen perform such an action, and perhaps it might by such means jerk itself from place to place, witb considerable agility. But I do not think so rude a mode of progression could enable it to select the direction of its leaps, which, under water, appears to me to be determined with so much precision.”* Scallops are found pretty generally distributed in all seas, and are much sought after for food. At Weymouth, the average produce of the trawlers is five bushels of scallops per week. They have been sold at two-pence per hundred, 700 going to the bushel ;f but they appear to have become scarcer lately, if one may judge by the price at which they are now sold, viz., four-pence a dozen, and two-pence per dozen for the shells, without the fish, for making shell ornaments. The fishermen suppose that they are taken in the greatest numbers after a fall of suow. In Cornwall they are called Frills, or Queens; on the Dorset coast, Squinns, and in the north of France, * ‘ Devonshire Const,’ by P. H. Gosse, pp. 50, 52. f ‘ A Year at the Shore,’ by P. H.

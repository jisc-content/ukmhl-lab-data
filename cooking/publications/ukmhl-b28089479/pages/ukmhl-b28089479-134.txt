EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. 118 close examination I observed, besides those from the neighbouring seas, species from distant countries, for example, Conus textiles. Triton femorale, Meleagrina mavgaritifera (Pearl-Oyster), species only found in the Indian and Eastern Seas. I think, therefore, that this may be regarded as part of a Natural History collection. Assuming the truth of this conjecture, its antiquity is without precedent. Did the original proprietor form one of a Natural History Society at Pompeii, of which the distinguished Naturalist, Pliny, who pei’ished at Pompeii, was a member ? It would also be curious, in these days of research for priority of names, to know how they were described. Such a discovery might disturb existing nomenclature, and increase the per- plexity already felt in naming collections. But laying aside fanciful conjectures, the collection is further instructive from the condition and perfect preservation in which the specimens are found, after an interment of nearly 1800 years.'” The scallop is figured on the coins of Saguntum, which are of Phoenician time, the dolphin being on one side, with the letters s.a.g.w. under, and the scallop on the reverse; and Florez, in his ‘ Medallas de Espafia/ Parte 2, 1728, says of these coins, “These (the dol- phin and the scallop shell) allude to Neptune and Venus, for as the dolphin is sacred to Neptune, so is the shell to Venus,* as the daughter of the sea, and also for the pearls it engenders, applied to the adorn- ment of women. This shell is most appropriate for the impress of a maritime city, from the utility enclosed within it, and its application to diverse uses, either from its seed for jewels, or as a delicacy for the table, for the * ‘ Faveas concha Cypria vecta tua,’ Tibullus, lib. iii.

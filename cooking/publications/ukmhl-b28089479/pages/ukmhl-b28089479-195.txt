HALIOTIDiE. EAR-SHELL, OR SEA-EAR. 179 smaller ones are better boiled, and tben eaten with vinegar and pepper. Eastbourne method of Cooking Limpets.—Put them on the gridiron till all the water boils out of them, and then they are fit to eat. Dr. Jeffreys speaks highly of roasted limpets, having tasted them in the island of Herm. The limpets were placed on the ground, and laid in their usual position, and cooked by being covered with a heap of straw, which had been set on fire, about twenty minutes before dinner.* “Limpet Sauce.—Choose clean-shelled limpets, not covered with barnacles, steep them in fresh water, and then heat them in a close-covered saucepan until they part easily from the shells. They yield a rich brown liquor, in which, after being shelled, they may be stewed for half an hour. Thicken the liquor with but- ter and flour; strain and season with pepper, cayenne, and salt, and a slight flavouring of lemon-juice or vinegar. The limpets, being tough and indigestible, are not returned into the sauce.” f Fam. HALIOTIDiE. EALIOTIS.—EAR-SHELL, or SEA-EAR. Haliotis tubercclata, Linnaeus.

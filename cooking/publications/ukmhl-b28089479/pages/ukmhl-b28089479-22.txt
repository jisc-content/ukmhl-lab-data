6 EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. Costa, as quoted by Dr. J. G. Jeffreys in bis 'British Conchology/ says that it is so phosphorescent, that if the flesh is chewed and kept in the mouth, the breath becomes luminous and looks like a real flame. Dr. Coldstream states that “ the phosphorescent light of this mollusk is given out most strongly by the internal surfaces of the respiratory tubes, and that it is strongest in summer; and Professor John Muller has observed, that when Pholades are placed in a vacuum, the light disappears, but reappears on the admission of air; also, that when dried, they recover their luminous property on being rubbed or moistened.* Many others have also made experiments with the Pholas, and have studied its phosphorescence, viz., Reaumur, Beccaria, Marsilius, Galeatus, and Moutius. The two first mentioned endeavoured to render this “ luminosity permanent, and the best result was ob- tained by placing the dead mollusk in honey, by which its property of emitting light lasted more than a year. Whenever it was plunged into warm water, the body of the Pliolas gave as much light as ever.”f Beccaria also found that a single Pholas “rendered seven ounces of milk so luminous that the faces of persons might be distinguished by it, and it looked as if transparent. Pholas dactylus, or the long oyster, as it is called at Weymouth, is not often eaten in England, but is generally used for bait. A Newhaven fisherman, how- ever, told me they sometimes collect some for eating from the chalk boulders, between Newhaven and * Forbes and Hanly, vol. i. p. 107. f ‘ Phosphorescence,’ by T. L.

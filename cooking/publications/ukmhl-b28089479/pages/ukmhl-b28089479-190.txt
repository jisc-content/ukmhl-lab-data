174 EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSOA. periwinkle. At Naples they make them into soup, and I am told it is an excellent dish. At Eastbourne we have often seen the Irish reapers come down to the shore and eat the limpets raw which they had knocked off the rocks with their knives. The poorer classes at Eastbourne also eat them constantly, the children collecting them at low tide from the rocks. Mr. Patterson, while residing, in 1837, near the town of Earne, Co. Antrim, endeavoured to form some idea of the quantity of the common limpet taken from the rocks on that part of the coast, and used as food; and he had reason to believe that the weight of the boiled fish was above eleven tons. Limpets ready boiled are regularly sold in the fishmarket at Truro, at Is. per quart ; and at Plymouth they gather great numbers of them (especially from the breakwater), as well as in the Isle of Man, where they are known by the name of “flitters;'’'’ and in Scotland the juice of these shell- fishes is mixed with oatmeal. In the Feroe Isles they call them “ flia; ” and in ‘ Life in Normandy 1 (vol. i. p. 192), we are told “that limpets are constantly eaten by the poor; and that at Granville the children use a square-pointed knife, with a thick back, for getting them off the rocks; some having, in addition, small wooden hammers; others only a stoue in their right hands. The edge of the knife was applied always on one side, and never at the top of the shell; a little sharp tap was given, either with the hammer or stone, and the fish fell at once.” This reminds us of Hermippus, who says :— “ And beating down the limpets from the rocks, Tliev make a noise like castanets.”* * Athemeus, ‘peijm.’ bk. xiv. 39.

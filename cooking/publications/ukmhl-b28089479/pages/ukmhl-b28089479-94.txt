EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. 78 stock mixed with flour; a flavour of herbs may be given if liked, and bits of meat added to it. Mussel Soup.—Take the liquor that flows from the mussels when open on the fire, and strain it through a fine napkin; put it into some good broth; add the yolks of six eggs beat up with it, thicken it over the fire, and put it into your soup when ready to serve, arranging the mussels round the dish.* Mussel Soup with Crawfish.—Take a hundred mus- sels, wash them very clean, put them into a stew-pan, cover them close. Let them stew till open, then take them out of their shells, strain the liquor through a fine sieve over the mussels. Take a dozen crawfish, pound them up with a dozen of almonds blanched and beat fine; then take a small parsnip, and a carrot scraped and cut into thin slices; fry them brown, with a little butter. Take two pounds of any fresh fish, and boil in a gallon of water, with a bundle of sweet herbs, a large onion stuck with cloves, whole pepper, black and white, a little parsley, a small piece of horseradish, and salt the mussel liquor, the crawfish and the almonds. Let this boil till half is wasted, then strain it through a sieve, put the soup into a saucepan, with twenty of the mussels, a few mushrooms and truffles cut small, and a leek cut very small. Take two French rolls, take out the crumb and fry it brown, cut it into little pieces, put it into the soup, and let it boil altogether for a quarter of an hour, with the fried carrot and parsnip. In the meantime take the crust of the rolls fried crisp, half a hundred of the mussels, a quarter of a pound of butter, a spoonful of water, and shake in a little flour, then set this on the * ‘ French Family Cook.’

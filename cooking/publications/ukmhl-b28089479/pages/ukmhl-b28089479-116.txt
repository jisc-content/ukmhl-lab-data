So superstitious are these men, that not one of their number, Christian or idolater, would continue their employment without the countenance of the sorcerer, and in 1857 Government was compelled to pay these impostors. The chief shark-charmer wa3 a Roman Catholic.* The same authority further states that the utmost depth in which a diver can remain safely is about seventy feet. They can remain under water from fifty to sixty seconds, and the diving is carried on from five to six hours daily. Each of the ten divers can, in the course of the day, bring up from 1000 to 4000 pearl- shells. A single oyster contains sometimes thirty or forty pearls, of which some may be worth a sovereign on the spot. The small valueless seed-pearls are burnt, and sold as pearl-lime to the wealthy Malays, to add to the betel and cabbage-nuts which they chew. The Ceylonese mix the lustreless pearls with grain, and feed their poultry with them, in whose crops the pearls regain their former brilliancy after a few minutes grinding. The crops are slit up, and the peai’ls taken out. It is said to be done by other Indian races, but that the pearls lose weight. In India the priests of Buddha keep up the strange belief as to the origin of pearls, which I have mentioned elsewhere, and make it a pretext for exacting what they term “ Charity oysters,” from the divers and boatmen of their faith for the use of Buddha, who, when propitiated, will make the fish yield more pearls in future seasons.f * • Voyage of the Novara,’ vol. i. p. 332. f ‘ Household Words,’ “ My Pearl-fishing Expedition,” vol. iii. p. 80.

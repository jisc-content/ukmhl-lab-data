EDIBLE BltlTISH MOLLUSCA. 142 In the Bay of Cadiz Ostrea Virginica (or Ostrea angulata?) is eaten when very small, but the poor people eat it full-size, viz., ten inches long. This species lives in the salt mud of the Cuadalete, and is called Ostione; other oysters are called Ostrea or Ostrias, and Ostrea edulis is known by the name of Ostia blanca. The river is said to be salt three leagues from its mouth. A Freuchman at Puerto St. Maria tried the experi- ment of breeding oysters for the Madrid market, but they were slimy, and not to be compared with the English oysters, though they were said to be good when cooked; and Major Byng Hall stated that at Madrid, oysters—not fine ones—cost twopence-halfpenny (that is, 1 suppose, one real) each ; but this is not very remarkable, for in 1865 natives cost twopence, and Whitstable oysters three-halfpence each in London, the very land of oysters, so scarce had the mollusks become. Ostrea edulis is found in abundance in the Gulfs of Trieste aud of Venice. Ostreo-culture is carried on in a most primitive manner by the fishermen of Moi - falcone, Duino, Zaole, &c. They drive piles, or rather oak branches, into the bed of the sea, in one and a half to two fathoms of water, in the spring, and in the autumn, when the spat has settled on them, they are transferred into deep waters, there to await their de- velopment after the third season. In Dalmatia the branches of oak are m< rely thrown into the water, and there allowed to remain until the oysters mature and fall off.* The Tareutines declare that oysters are fattest during the full moon, and they are also fully persuaded that the moon-beams have a pernicious effect upou sea-fish, * ‘ Tlie Fisheries of the Adriatic,’ by G.

Few persons who have paid a visit to the seaside can have failed to remark this common shell, which, at low tide, may be seen crawling over the tangled masses of seaweed. Many pleasant hours do children pass in gathering basketfuls of periwinkles, taking them home and boil- ing them, and enjoying a hearty meal, with the accompaniment of good thick slices of bread-and-butter. Periwinkles vary much in colour, some being of a dark olive-green, nearly black, or of a pale greenish- white, like the specimen figured; and others red or rufous-brown, with narrow bands of smoke colour. Varieties of form also occur, and I procured from Exmouth two curious specimens, with the whorls angular and the edges sharp, instead of rounded. Athenaeus, in his * Deipnosophists/ mentions several kinds of periwinkles. He says, “ Of the periwinkle, the white are the most tender, and they have no dis- agreeable smell, .... but of the black and red kinds the larger are exceedingly palatable, especially those that are caught in the spring. As a general rule all of them are good for the stomach, and digestible when eaten with cinnamon and pepper.” There is a large consumption of these little mollusks in London; and Billingsgate market is supplied from various parts of the British coast; the largest supply is in May and June, and they sell at one shilling a measure. Mr. Patterson, of Belfast, states, in his f Introduction to Zoology/ that quantities of periwinkles are annually shipped from Belfast for London, and in 1861 the # ‘ British Conchology,’ vol. iii. p. 371.

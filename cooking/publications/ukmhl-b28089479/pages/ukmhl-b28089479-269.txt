The Grand Banks specimen (Architeuthis princeps) was found floating on the surface, on the Grand Banks, Newfoundland, October 1871, bv Cap- tain Campbell, of the Schooner ‘ B. D.

To their horror they found themselves close to a huge fish, having large glassy eyes, which was making desperate efforts to escape, and churning the water into foam by the movement of its immense arms and tail. It was aground, and the tide was ebbing. From the funnel at the back of its head it was ejecting large volumes of water, this being its method of moving backwards, the force of the stream, by the reaction of the surrounding medium, driving it in the required direction.

EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. GO covered with, mussel spawn. He then increased the Dumber of his poles, and after various attempts he constructed his first artificial mussel-bed, or bouchot. At.the level of the lowest tides he drove into the mud stakes that were strong enough to resist the force of the waves, and placed them in two rows about a yard distant from each other. This doable line of poles formed an angle, whose base was directed towards the shore, and whose apex pointed to the sea. This pali- sade was roughly fenced in with long branches, and a narrow opening having been left at the extremity of the angle, wicker-work cases were arranged in such a manner as to stop any fishes that were being carried back by the retreating tide. It was soon found inex- pedient to trust only to the chance of the currents and waves that might bring in the young mussels to the poles and fences, and men frequently went to a very great distance in search of the young mollusks,— even as far as the plateau of Chatelaillon.” M. de Qnatrefages further tells us, that the little mussels that appear in the spring are called seeds; they are scarcely larger than lentils till towards the end of May, when they rapidly increase in size, and are then called renouvelains, and in July are ready for transplanting. They are detached from the bouchots which are situated at lowest tide-mark, and are then put into pockets or bags made of old nets, “ which are placed upon the fences that are not quite so far advanced into the sea.” The young mussels attach themselves by means of their byssus all round the pockets or bags. As they increase in size aud become crowded together, they are taken out and distributed over other poles lying nearer the shore, aud the full-

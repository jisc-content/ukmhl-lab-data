Some prefer two dozen of oysters to each soup-plate, instead of one dozen, in which case, double the quantity of oysters and their liquor is required, leaving the other ingredients as before.”* “ Oysters Stewed.—Wash them in their own liquor, strain them, put them into a saucepan with some white pepper pounded, a little beaten mace, a little cream, a piece of butter mixed with flour; stir this till it boils, throw in the oysters, simmer them till enough ; add salt if required; toasted sippets round the dish.”f “ To Stew Oysters another ivay.—Take a quart of oysters, wash them one by one in their own liquor with a little vinegar and white wine; then strain the liquor into a saucepan, and put your oysters to it, with a bit of mace, whole pepper, cloves, nutmeg, and a very little thyme and savory, a whole onion, and a little lemon-peel; cover it close, and let it stew very slowly almost a quarter of an hour; then make a sauce with six spoonfuls of the liquor, shalot, anchovies, some butter, a little mace, and juice of lemon; wet sippets in the stewed liquor and lay them upon a plate, lay your oysters on them, the best side upwards, and crumble the yolks of two or three hard-boiled eggs over them, so pour on your sauce. Garnish with lemon and barberries.];” * 1 All About Oysters.’ f ‘The Lady’s Assistant,’ by Mrs. Charlotte Mason, 1775. + ‘The Lady’s Companion,’ 1753, vol. ii. p. 151.

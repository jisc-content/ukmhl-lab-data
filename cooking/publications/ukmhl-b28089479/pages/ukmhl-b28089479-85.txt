69 MYTILID2E.—MUSSEL. Some of the natives inhabiting the Patagonian Channels between the Gulf of Penas and Smyth’s Channels, live the greater part of the year almost entirely on mussels and limpets, varied occasionally by the capture of a seal or small otter * Athenseus says that mussels are moderately nutri- tious and digestible, the best being the Ephesian kind, which are particularly good when taken about the end of autumn (vol. i. p. 150). In the Feroe Isles, the large horse-mussel, Mytilus modiolus is eaten, and they call it in Feroese Ova. Mr. Alder tells us that at Rothesay they are collected for food f (though not so delicate as Mytilus edulis), and in the Shetland Isles for bait, where they are known by the name of Yoags. They are also eaten in the north of Ireland, but not considered very good, on account of their strong scent and flavour; but they are capital bait for cod. In Labrador the bait gene- rally used at the commencement of the cod-fishing season, viz., in May and June, consists of mussels salted for the purpose; but as soon as the capelings (Mallofus villosus) reach the coast, they are sub- stituted, to save expense; and in many instances the flesh of gannets and other sea fowl is employed.J At Tenby, they call Mytilus modiolus the poisonous mussel, and affirm that no one ever ventures to eat it. Pearls are occasionally found in the common mussel, and also in the oyster, scallop, cockle, periwinkle, and * ‘ Cruise of the Alert/ p. 48. + Forbes and Hanley, * Brit. Mollusca/ vol. ii. p. 185.

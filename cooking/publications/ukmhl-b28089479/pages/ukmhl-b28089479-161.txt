OSTREADJE.—OYSTER. 145 tion. As fast as the oysters are opened the shells are used to build up new land, and with them a large peninsula has been formed, stretching out for more than half a mile from the low marshy shore towards the oyster-beds, and furnishing room for wide streets, a railroad, and a steamboat landing, in addition to the large packing-houses, and the shops and dwellings for a population of several thousand people. A single view of the long white solid streets and docks of this singular town would convey a much more vivid idea of the oyster-packing industry than any number of tables of statistics. At some future period this enormous accumulation of oyster-shells will be considered as a kjokkenmoddings.'' * In Brand's ‘ Popular Antiquities ' we are told, that oysters are in season in London on St. James's Day, July 25th (old style), and that there is a popular super- stition still in force, similar to that relating to goose on Michaelmas Day, viz., that whoever eats oysters on that day will never want money for the rest of the year; but the real oyster season is considered to commence on the 4th of August, and last until January, and the natives especially, from October to March. Oysters are said to be in season when the month has the letter r in it. In ‘Poor Robin's Almanack,' 1719, under Sep- tember, he says,— “This month hath go!ten an R iu’t, By which Astrologers do hint, That the Fish icleped oysters, Are in their operative muistures, Which tho’ counted ungodly meat, Because without grace they are eat, * ‘ Report of the Commissioners of Fisheries of M»r\hnid,’ 1880. ‘ Development of the American Ouster,’ by W.

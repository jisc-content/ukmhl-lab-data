245 SEPIADjB. CUTTLE. Fam. SEPIAD^F. SEPIA .—CUTTLE. Sepia officinalis, Linnaeus. Common Cuttle-fisli, or Scuttle.—The animal is curious, very flat, with white stripes across its body, the groundwork being dark brown. The head is brown, as well as the arms, but the inside of the latter is white, and is furnished with four rows of suckers. Its two tentacular arms are very long, expanded broadly at the tips, and are also furnished with suckers. The beak is hard and black* shaped like that of a parrot. The common cuttle-fish, theSeche, Seiche,or Casseron, of the French, is very generally eaten by our fishermen, and at Great Yarmouth they bring them in baskets to the houses for sale, recommending them as excellent and wholesome food. Cuttle-fish are often taken on the fishing lines, and will follow the bait to the surface, sucking it and holding fast by their long tentacles,* but we seldom find them alive on the shore, though their white bones are constantly picked up; and an immense number of these bones sometimes strew the beach from Beachy Head to Pevensey, while numbers float on the surface of the water. This was particularly the case there some years ago. It seemed as if there had been some epidemic amongst the cuttles which caused this great mortality, for certainly many basket- fuls of bones might easily have been collected. They are not without their use ; and at Liverpool, cuttle- bones are sold to the druggists for making tooth- powder, as much as twelve hundredweight arriving at * ‘ Sea Fisli/ &c., by W. B. Lord.

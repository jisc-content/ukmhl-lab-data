Limpet Soup.—Wash them, and free the shells from seaweed, &c., put them into a saucepan and parboil them. Take them out of the shells; chop up some parsley, and put it, with a tablespoonful of oil, or an ounce of lard or butter, into a saucepan, and fry until it becomes brown. Add a pint of water, and, when boiling, throw in the limpets, with a teaspoouful of anchovy sauce, some pepper, and boil again for half an hour; or, if preferred, stew them before putting them into the soup. To dress Limpets.—Take those of a large size, and fry them with a little butter, pepper, and vinegar.

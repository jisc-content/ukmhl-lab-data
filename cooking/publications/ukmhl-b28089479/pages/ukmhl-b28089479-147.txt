by certain ancient customs and bye-laws.* * * § OSTREADiE. OYSTER. 131 company of fishermen, ruled, like those of Faversham, Jersey oysters are brought over and bedded in the Southampton water. They are described as being small, but of superior flavour, and are conveyed long distances to be laid down, naturalized, and afterwards sold as natives. They are also remarkable for their saline flavour when first brought over, but it goes off after they have been bedded some time at South - ampton.f In 1876 Jersey oysters were very scarce, and the beds in a bad condition. It is said that formerly there were fine oyster-beds between Portsmouth, Hay- liug, and the Isle of Wight; and recently a breeding place on the French system has been established at Hayling Island, and there is considerable trade carried on in oysters. There are extensive oyster-beds in the Medina and Newtown rivers, in the Isle of Wight, and a large quantity were bred in 1880, and were in good condition up to 1881.J The manor of Osborne is said to derive its old name of Austerbourne, or Oysterbourne, from the oyster-beds of the Medina.§ A bed of oysters was discovered ofl’ Eastbourne, some years since, the fish being of a very superior and delicate flavour. The price was Is. per hundred, but it rose to 2s.; and another large bed, which was valued at £5000, was found about three miles off the mouth of Dartmouth harbour, about the same time.

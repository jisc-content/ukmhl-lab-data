Tem- poral power being palpably unavailing, the spiritual tribunal steps in ; the decision of the magistrates being useless, perhaps excommunication may suffice. This then was an established maxim. If the criminal cuuld be reached, it was handed over to the ordinary courts of justice; if, however, the matter was beyond their control, it fell within the jurisdiction of Ecclesiastical Courts.” Bartholomew de Chasseneux, a noted lawyer of the sixteenth century, gives the following form of excommunication. “ 0 snails, caterpillars, and other obscene creatures, which destroy the food of our neigh- bours, depart hence ! Leave these cantons which you are devastating, and take refuge in those localities where you injure no one. J. N. P.” etc. On the 1 7th of August, 1487, snails were sentenced at Macon.* The Norwegians are said to have had a “ Lemming-Litany ” in their church service, in which these pests were most solemnly exorcised.f The shells of Helix pomatia are used for rnakiug small whistles for children. The apex of the shell is cut off, and a piece of tin added; they are then sold for a penny each; and who does not recollect the wonderful cats made of the shells of the common garden snail, Helix aspersa, with heads of putty or cement, and how anxious we were.to become possessors of these beautiful creatures !

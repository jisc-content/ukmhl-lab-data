If required in large quantities, take the large boiler, put therein four pounds of lard or butter and four pounds of sliced onions; fry for five minutes. Have ready two pailfuls of mussels out of the shell, and in their liquor, which put in the boiler with one pound of salt, two ounces of pepper, two ounces of sugar, two pounds of chopped parsley, and two pounds of flour, mixed with water to the thickness of good cream; boil ten or fifteen minutes, stir it gently with a wooden spatula, and serve. If not required maigre, use instead of water, the same quantity of boiling * ‘ Autiquitates CuHnarise,’ by the Rev. Richard Warner, p. 23.

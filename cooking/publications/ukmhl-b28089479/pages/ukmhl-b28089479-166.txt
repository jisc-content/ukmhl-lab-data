The heap occupies an irregular space of two hundred feet long, and sixty feet wide, and ranges from six to eight feet deep. There are various traditions as to the age of the heaps; and it is said, that ninety years ago a series of high tides cast up the heap of shells from adjoining beds.* Dr. Schliemann found oyster-shells in large numbers in the ruins of all the five prehistoric settlements at Hissarlik, showing that oysters must have been a favourite food with all the early settlers, and their abundance in the first and oldest city is confirmed by Professor B. Virchow.f In an old kitchen-midden, in the Andaman Is- lands, close to the landing-place at Homfray’s Ghat, Mount Augusta, the valves of oysters Arcidce and Cyrenidce, are found in abundance, but the present race of Andamanese are stated by Mr, Ball not to eat oysters, which suggests the idea that possibly there were dif- ferent inhabitants of this poi'tion of the island at some former period. J Saint-Hilaire describes heaps of oyster and other shells, bordering the river Piriqui-assu, near Aldea Velha., which are without doubt TcjdTcJcenmdddings. Similar shell-heaps, or Ostreiras, as they are called in Brazil, are found on the coast of Sao Paulo, and on the Ilha do Governador, in the Bay of Bio. They often contain human remains, pottery, &c § At the present day the Baltic appears to be almost the only sea where the oyster will not grow, a fact * ‘ Field,’ February 4th, 1865. + ‘ Trqja,’ by Dr. Henry Schliemann, see uote vi. p. 285.

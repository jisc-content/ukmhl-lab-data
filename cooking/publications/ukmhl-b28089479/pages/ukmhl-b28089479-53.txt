VENERIDjE . — PULLET. 37 milk; measure a small teaspoonful of dry saleratus (volatile salts), mix it with a little hot water; when all is dissolved, and a little cooled, add to it the sour milk or buttermilk, then proceed to make it into a soft dough with as much cold water as may be necessary ; dip your hands in dry flour to prevent the dough from sticking to them. Rub over the sides of an iron dinner- pot with a bit of butter, and line the sides only with the paste made in the hands, not more than half an inch thick, press it closely against the pot, then put in fifty large clams, a quarter of a pound of sweet butter cut small, a small teaspoonful of ground pepper strewed over, and half a nutmeg, grated, if liked; dredge wheat flour over, until it looks white; put of clam juice and water sufficient to nearly reach the top of the paste; lay skewers across, roll out a crust for the top, and whatever paste remains, cut into small squares, and drop in before putting on the crust; cut a slit in the centre, cover the pot close and set it over a gentle fire for one hour; then take it up and serve as soon as done. The crust becomes heavy by standing. This is a dish much liked by those who are fond of clams. The paste direoted in this recipe is delicate and far more healthful than any other.* Pickled Clams.—Boil them from the shells, and take them out with a skimmer and put them into a basin; take of their own liquor half enough to cover over them, and the same quantity of strong vinegar. Whole pepper, alspice and mace, each a teaspoonful; make this hot and then pour it over the clams. After twenty-four hours they are fit for eating, and will keep good for a long time. * Mrs. Crowen.

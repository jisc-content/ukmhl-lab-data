Myadce are widely distributed, and are not only food for man, but for the walrus and other northern animals, besides birds and fishes, which relish them greatly. Captain Tuckey, in his expedition to the river Zaire, or Congo, found that a species of Mya was much sought after by the natives, and that three or four hundred canoes were met with near Draper’s Islands, in which the people were busily engaged in dragging up these shellfish; having made temporary huts by bending and entwining living branches of trees, be- sides occupying caverns in the rocks with their families during the fishing-season.

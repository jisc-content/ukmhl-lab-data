OSTREADiE. OYSTER. 165 “Oysters and Chestnuts.—Dip some oysters into a savory batter; bread-crumb them, and fry them brown. In the same manner treat a similar number of blanched Spanish chestnuts. Make a sauce with the oyster liquor, a piece of butter rubbed in flour, and two glasses of white wine. Stew the chestnuts in this; add some yolk of egg to thicken it, and pour it upon the oysters.”* “ Oyster Steak. — Take a steak double the usual thickness, and with a very sharp knife divide it in the centre from one side only, so as to form a sort of bag. Open sufficient oysters to stuff the bag; season with salt and pepper; add a lump of butter and some of the oyster liquor; sew it up carefully, put it on a gridiron, let it gradually cook so as to warm the oysters right through. Serve hot with butter, pepper, and salt.”f “ Scalloped Oysters.—Scald and beard some dozens of oysters; strain the liquor into a stew-pan, and add thereto two ounces of butter, mixed or kneaded with two ounces of flour, a little cream, anchovy, nutmeg, and cayenne; stir the sauce over the fire to boil, and reduce for ten minutes; then add a couple of yolks of eggs, and a little lemon-juice, and some chopped parsley; add the oysters, cut each in halves; stir all together over the fire for a few minutes, and fill some scallop-shells with this preparation; cover them over with a thick coating of fried bread-crumbs; place them on a baking-sheet in the oven for five minutes, and serve hot.”J If you have no scallop-shells, the deep * ‘ Household Manuals : How to Cook Fi-h,’ by Georglnna Hill, t * All About Oysters.’ * Francatelli's ‘ Cook’s Guide ’ l

256 EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. had scarcely regained the shore, before the monster replunged into the deep.* The Hydra of Lerna, destroyed by Hercules, was most certainly a polypus, or sepia, and in at least one of the early representations of the subject, the animal is most correctly drawn as a cuttle-fish or polypus. Montfaucon represents the Hydra as a “ Monster with several heads—some seven, others nine, and others fifty—but that it was not a dragon is evident, not only rom the waves which are at its feet, but also from the form and capaciousness of its breast, and whole body; and again, its connection with the ocean can be traced in the crab being sent to its assistance by Juno, to bite Hercules in the heel, and when he crushed it, he over- came the Hydra. Juno, unable to succeed in her attempts to lessen the fame of Hercules, placed the crab amongst the constellations, and it forms one of the signs of the zodiac. It represents the month of June, because, when the sun has come to this constellation he begins to go backwards like a crab.”f Pliny mentions several kinds of polypi, one of which he especially calls the land polypus, and states that it is larger than that of the sea ; and Hardouin says it is the species found on the seashore, which more fre- quently comes on dry land than the other kinds, j; In the Polynesian islands, the natives have a curious contrivance for catching cuttle-fish. It consists of a straight piece of hard wood, a foot long, round, and polished, and not half an inch in diameter. Near one * ‘ Le Monde de In Mer,’ pur Fredol. + <Nnt.

At this time there was an epidemic of small-pox in the village, so that men fell down and died in the street, and the holy man prayed to Fudo Sama, that the plague might be stopped. Then the god appeared to him and said, ‘ The Saint Yakushi-Niurai of the Cuttle-fish, whose image thou earnest, desires to have his place in this village, and he will heal this plague. Thou shalt therefore raise a temple to him here, that not only this small-pox, but other diseases for future generations, may be cured by his power/ Hearing this, the priest shed tears of gratitude, and having chosen a piece of wood, he carved a large figure of his patron saint of the Cuttle-fish, and placed the smaller image inside the larger, and laid it up in this temple, to which people still flock that they may be healed of their diseases.” This story is said to be translated from a small ill- printed pamphlet sold by the priests of the temple, all the decorations of which, even to the bronze lantern in the middle of the court-yard, are in the form of a cattle-fisli, the sacred emblem of the place.f Both the Chinese and the Japanese make use of Octopus sinensis (d’Orbigny) as food when young, and season it with vinegar and ginger, and also of a species * ‘ Fudo,’ literally • the motionless;' Buddha, in the state called Nirvana. t • Tales of Old Japan,’ by A.

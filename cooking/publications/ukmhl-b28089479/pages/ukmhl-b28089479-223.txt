Cailliaud to be used for food in the spring (after the fisb have spawned) by some of the inhabitants of St. Micliel-Chef-Chef, in the department of the Loire Inferieure. In March, 1865, I saw Purpura lapillus sold at Hastings ready boiled for eating at Id. per pint; but the name given to them, was not one to encourage a trial, viz., Man- suckers; though I was assured they were very good, and tasted like periwinkles. The Spanish names for it are Minchas, and Corn de fel. The Almond Whelk, or Red Whelk, as it is some- times called—Fusus antiqnus—is eaten in Liverpool, and great quantities are taken ou the Cheshire coast. In Dublin the fishermen use them principally for bait for the larger kind of fish, such as cod and ling, and only occasionally eat them, boiled or pickled. The beautiful large white variety is dredged off the Irish coast. My largest specimen from Dublin measures six and a half inches in length, and three and a half inches in breadth, and Dr. Jeffreys saw the shells used as lamps in the Shetland Isles by the northern fishermen. They are suspended from a nail in the wall or ceiling of the hut, by means of a piece of string, which is fastened round the shell in a triangular form. The inside is filled with fish-oil, and a wick of cotton or tow is put into the canal at the extremity of the mouth.* The Chinese use a large shell, a species of Fusus, for their fog-horns. In (Antiquitates Culiuarise/ it is said that at the enthronization feast of William Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1504, 8000 whelks were supplied at five shillings a thousand, and they were served up as an accompaniment to sturgeon; and amongst the dishes * ‘ British Coucliology,’ vol. i., Introduction, p.

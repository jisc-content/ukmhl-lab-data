EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLU&CA. 201 cut in the solid sandstone rock, in which shells seem to have been crushed. They were perfectly smooth on the inside, and many of them shaped like a inoderu iron pot, broad and flat at the bottom, and narrowing towards the top. Many of these were filled with a breccia of shells, and he supposes that all the shells were of one kind, probably Murex trunculus.* Dr. Tristram in ‘ The Land of Israel/ mentions finding traces at Tyre of its ancient trade and manufac- tures, and that amongst the rubbish thrown out in the excavations were numberless fragments of glass, and whole “ kitchen-middens ” of shells, crushed and broken, the owners of which had once supplied the famed Tyrian purple dye. All these shells were of one species, and that one of the most plentiful on the coast, the Murex brandaris. It has frequently been stated that Murex trunculus is the true original of the Tyrian dye, and it is very possible that it may have been also used for that purpose. But Dr. Tristram adds, “ While we noticed only a few broken specimens of M. trun- culus scattered about, the compact masses of broken shells, and which, therefore, had most probably been used in manufacture, and not merely for food, were exclusively of the former species.” In Africa, the island of Meniux (now called Gerbee, in the Gulf of Gabes) was famed for its purple, as well as parts of Gaetulia that border on the ocean ; and in Europe, the best came from the coast of Laconia. Cornelius Nepos speaks of the Tarentine red; and Hardouin remarks that in his time were still to be seen the remains of the ancient dyeing-houses at Tarentum, # W.

In the British Museum a fishing-net is ex- hibited, from the Friendly Islands, with cockle-shells fastened on to it to sink it, instead of leads. Cockle-shells are used as cultch for the oyster spat to adhere to; they are thrown on to the breeding beds ; and they sow them during the time the oyster spat are floating about in the sea Mr. Frank Buckland, in his examination before the Select Com- mittee on Oyster Fisheries, 1876, adds that “Spat are especially fond of cockles, and that the great ad- vantage of cockle-shells cultch is, that the oysters will grow up in handsome bunches, they can then be broken off, and they will grow into proper size and shape, and become handsome and fit for market.” Major Hayes, Inspector of Irish Fisheries, in his report on the principal Oyster Fisheries of France, made in 1878, noticed at Arcachon, a new form of collector for spat, viz., cockle-shells strung closely to- gether upon wire, a hole being made in the shell near the hinge ; the wire is run through, and when strung they are placed at the proper time in situations favour- able for catching spat.

EDIBLE BRITISH M0LLU8CA. * ‘ British Conchology,’ vol. ii. p. 109. 63 proves, without doubt, that shellfish can be impreg- nated with copper or other poisonous substances, which probably would affect those who ate them. Some persons consider that mussels are unwholesome if a small species of crab (Pinnotheres pisurn, or Pinnotheres veterum), which is sometimes found in their shells, is not carefully taken out; others, that they are only fit for food in the winter months; and by some on account of their feeding on the spawn of the star-fish, which is poisonous.* It is said that if a silver spoon is boiled with the mussels, and it turns black, it proves that they are poisonous, and not fit to be eaten. But, whatever may be the cause of the wholesale poisoning by these shellfish, they have been the means of saving many poor from starvation in times of scai’city. Mr. Patterson, of Belfast, in his ‘ Intro- duction to Zoology/ mentions having been informed by an old inhabitant of Holywood, near the above- mentioned town, that in 1792, or 1793, there was a great drought prevailing, which caused much distress, and that in the month of June or July, twenty poor families from the interior of the country encamped on the I’oadside, near the beach to the west of Holywood, remaining there about five weeks, subsisting partly on such vegetable matter as they could pick up about the hedgerows and fences, but principally upon the mussels which are so abundant on the extensive mud-banks of the neighbouring coast. No instance of disease from this diet occurred, and during that summer the poorer classes in the village appeared quite as healthy as in other years, though mussels formed their chief food.

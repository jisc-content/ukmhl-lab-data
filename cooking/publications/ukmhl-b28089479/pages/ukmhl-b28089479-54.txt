38 EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. Clam Fritters.—One and a half pints of milk; one and a quarter pounds of flour; four eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately; whites stirred in lighthT at the last; the clams must be chopped small; mix well, and drop with a spoon into hot lard, and fry brown.* Scalloped Glams.—Chop the clams fine, and season with pepper and salt. Cayenne pepper is thought to give a finer flavour than black or white, but to some palates it is insufferable. Mix in another dish, some powdered cracker, moistened first with warm milk, then with the clam liquor, a beaten egg or two, and some melted butter. Stir in with this the chopped clams. Wash as many clam-shells as the mixture will fill, wipe and butter them; fill, heaping up and smooth- ing over with a silver knife or teaspoon, range in rows in your baking-pan, and cook until nicely browned. Or, if you do not care to be troubled with the shells, bake in patty-pans, sending to table hot in the tins, as you would in the scallop-shells-t Glam Gliowder.—Fry five or six slices of fat pork crisp, and chop to pieces. Sprinkle some of these in the bottom of a pot; lay upon them a stratum of clams; sprinkle with cayenne or black pepper and salt, and scatter bits of butter profusely over all; next, have a layer of chopped onions, then one of small crackers, split and moistened with warm milk. On these pour a little of the fat left in the pan after the pork is fried, and then comes a new round of pork, clams, onions, &c. Proceed in this order until the pot is nearly full, then cover with water, and stew slowly * ‘Every Day’s Need.’ f ‘Common Sense in the Household,’ by Marion Harlaud.

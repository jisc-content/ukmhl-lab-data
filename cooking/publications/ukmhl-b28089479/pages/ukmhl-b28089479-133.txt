PECTINID.E.—SCALLOP. 117 very quaint and beautiful shapes, and, occasionally, they have reference to the object or history of the building; for instance, any building in any way connected with Santiago has the nails in the form of scallop shells.* The custom of bearing scallop shells as a badge of pilgrimage, is more widely spread than is usually sup- posed, for Sir Rutherford Alcock mentions their use on the sleeves of many of the Japanese pilgrims to the Cone of Fusiyama, in the island of Japan. In China, the valves of Pecten Japonicus are used as small shovels. Shells were used by the Romans to ornament their dwellings, and the “ Fountain of Shells/'’ described in Sir William Gell’s ‘ Pompeiana/ was decorated with the Tyrian murex and the scallop. Mr. Damon tells us that there is still standing, in a villa at Pompeii, a fountain decorated with the shells of the Mediterranean, one species of which, viz., Murex Brandaris, retains its colour and general freshness, and is not to be dis- tinguished from living examples. In an interesting paper on a ‘ Collection of recent shells discovered among the ruins of Pompeii, and preserved in the Museo Borbonico at Naples/ published in the ‘ Geological Magazine/ vol iv. No. 7, July, 1867, Mr. Damon calls our attention to the following, and says, that “ Among the many singular discoveries made in the ruins of Pompeii, and deposited in the Museo Borbonico, in the city of Naples, are a variety of shells, principally species now found in the Mediterranean Sea, amongst them Pecten Jacobceus, and so far of interest as an illustration of the persistency of certain known species within the historic period, no difference whatever being observable between the disinterred, and living specimens.

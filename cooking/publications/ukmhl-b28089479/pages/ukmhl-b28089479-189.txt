173 PATELLIDiE. LIMPET. 11,880,000 limpets for that purpose.* At low tide limpets may be collected in numbers from the rocks and boulders. Some are seen safely ensconced in holes or depressions made by means of the muscular action of their foot or disk, which is the width of the shell; others are seen creeping about in search of fresh rest- ing places, or food, with their tentacles slightly pro- truding beyond the shell, till alarmed by some touch, or otherwise; and they adhere with wonderful strength to the rocks. Wordsworth says : — “ And should the strongest arm endeavour The limpet from its rock to sever, ’Tis seen its loved support to clasp, With such tenacity of grasp, We wonder that such strength should dwell In such a small and simple shell.” Dr. A.Hartwig, remarks in his ‘Harmonies of Nature; or, the Unity of Creation,’ that the broad-soled foot of the limpet acts as a powerful sucker, and that it has been calculated that the larger species are thus able to produce a resistence equivalent to the weight of 150 lbs., which, considering the sharp angle of the shell, is more than sufficient todefy the strength of a man toraisethem. On the Devonshire coast I have found very large specimens of Patella vulgata, and worn quite smooth, some of the shells measuring as much as eight inches in circumference. Limpets, a foot in diameter, are found on the western coast of South America, and are used by the natives as basins.f In many places limpets are used for food, especially on the Continent, where they are oftener eaten than the * Forbes and Hanley, ‘ Brit.

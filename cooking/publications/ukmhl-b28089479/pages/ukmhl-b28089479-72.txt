EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSC.!. 56 ranean species, and is rare and local in England. It is lound on the Devonshire coast, at Paignton, and occasionally at Dawlish, and at certain times of the year, especially in the spring after a gale from the east, numhers may be gathered. On paying a visit to the Paignton sands, for the purpose of shell collecting, in the spring of 1862, the beach was quite strewn with broken single valves of this cockle, and there had evidently been quantities of live specimens washed up as well, as we met many persons returning home with their baskets heavily laden with them. Ccirdium rusticum varies in colour, from nearly white to a rich rufous-brown; sometimes there is a white band round the shell, and one of a dark chestnut-brown towards the margins. The colouring of the animal is most beautiful, the body being of a pink or pale vermilion, the mantle yellow or reddish, and the long foot of a most brilliant crimson. This foot terminates in a hooked point, and when stretched to its utmost is nearly four inches in length. It is by means of this organ that the cockle can bury itself in the sands, and also take those wonderful leaps of which we read in Mr. Gosse’s interesting work, fThe Aquarium/ andagain in his ‘ A Year at the Shore/ where he mentions that a specimen was seen to throw itself over the gunwale of a boat when laid on the bottom boards. Mr. Gosse states, in this latter work, that the mode of leaping is performed as follows :—“ The long taper foot is thrust to its utmost, and feels about for some resisting sur- face, a stone, for instance, which it no soouer feels than the hooked point is pressed stiffly against it, the whole foot, by muscular contraction, is made suddenly rigid, and the entire creature,—mantle.

VENERlDiE. PULLET. 27 in the sand or gravel (unlike the cockle, which makes but one), about an inch or so apart. They are easily dug up by means of an old knife. On warm, still days they appear to rise more readily to the surface; but if cold or windy they burrow about two to three inches deep in the gravelly sand. Butter-fish are considered very wholesome and I was assured by the cockle gatherers that they might be eaten with impunity at all times of the year, and never disagreed with people as the mussels and cockles occasionally do. At Falmouth, also, they are considered far richer and sweeter than cockles, and are sold in the market at 3d. per hundred. M. Gay says, that at Toulon it is known by the name of Clouvisso, and is a favourite dish in Continental seaports.* Clovisse is another name for it, and at Bordeaux it sells in the market from twenty to thirty centimes per hundred, and both it and Tapes pullastra are called Palourde by the French, and also le Lunot. At Puerto de Santa Maria., in Spain, it is very highly prized, and the Spaniards say “es buena” in speaking of it ; and at Vigo thousands are gathered at every tide. The following names are given in Spanish to all kinds of Tapes, viz. Almeixas, Almeija, Petchinas, Almejas, and Escupina lliza. At Naples it is called Vongola verace. Other species of Tapes are eaten abroad, besides those already mentioned ; and we may add another to our edible inollusks, viz. Tapes virginea, which is dis- tributed all round our coasts. It varies very much in colour, and you may gather a dozen or more specimens without finding two that resemble each other. The * ‘ British Conchology,’ vol. ii. p. 3G1. I

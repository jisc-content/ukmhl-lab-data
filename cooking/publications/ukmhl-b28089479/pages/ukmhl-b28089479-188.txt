172 EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. “ Oysters an Gratin.—Set a little cream in a pipkin, with a piece of butter (the quantities to be judged ac- cording to the size of the dish), and mingle them gradually; add to this a little anchovy sauce, cayenne wine, and grated lemon-peel. Pour half of this in a dish, lay in the oysters, and grate over them a little Parmesan cheese and bread-crumbs (not too thick a layer), seasoned in the usual way; then pour over the rest of the cream and butter, and grate another thin layer of Parmesan and bread-crumbs. Set it in a quick oven, or in a Dutch-oven.”* In the Mediterranean, a species of oyster, viz., Spondylus gcecleropus, is eaten both in Spain and in Italy. The Spanish names for it are Ostia vermella, or Ostiavermeya, and the Italian, Spuonnolo, and Gopiza. Fam. PATELLIDiE. PA TELL A.—LIMPET. Patella vulgata, Linnaeus.

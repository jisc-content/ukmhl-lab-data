Dr. J. Gr. Jeffreys, quoting an interesting account of Isocardia cor, by the Rev. James Bulwer (who kept a specimen in a vessel of sea-water, and was therefore able to study the habits of the animal), given in the ‘ Zoological Journal/ states, “ that the animal appears insensible both to sound and light, as the presence or absence of either did not interrupt its movements ; but its sense of feeling appeared to be very delicate ; minute substances being dropped into the orifice of the mantle instantly excited the animal, and a column of water strongly directed, expelled them from the shell. With so much strength was the water in some instances ejected that it rose above the surface of three inches of superincumbent fluid . . . . Locomotion very confined; it is capable, with the assistance of its foot, which it uses iu the same manner (but in a much more limited degree) as the Cardiacea, of fixing itself firmly in the sand, generally choosing to have the umbones covered by it, and the orifices of the tubes of the mantle nearly perpendicular.* Rest- ing in this position on the margin of a sand-bank of * ‘ British Concliology,’ vol. ii. pp. 300, 301.

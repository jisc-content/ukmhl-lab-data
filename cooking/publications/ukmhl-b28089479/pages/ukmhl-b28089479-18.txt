2 EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. solid oak—a material ten times harder than itself. He also observed that the form of the tube is evidently not the result of an auger-like instrument, because it is broader at the bottom than at the top and sides. Dr. J. G. Jeffreys, who quotes the above in his ‘ British Conchology/ agrees with Sellius that the foot or muscular disk, and not the shell, is “ the sole instru- ment of perforation by the mollusca of stone, wood, and other substances, which is closely applied to the concave end of the hole, and is constantly supplied with moisture through the glandular tissues of the body.” He adds, “By this simple, yet gradual process, the fibres of wood or grains of sand-stone may easily be detached or disintegrated, time and patience being allowed for the operation.” Some naturalists believe that it is accomplished by means of an acid contained in the fish, by which it dissolves the calcareous rocks; while others maintain that the Pholas bores by using its shell as a rasp. This mechanical process is fully described by “ Astur,” who, from his own observa- tions, has endeavoured to solve the problem, and who, to quote the late Mr. Buckland’s words, is apparently the only person “ who has ever seen the Pholas at work.” In the ‘ Field/ “ Astur ” published some time since an interesting description of the method by which this mollusk bores its habitation. He says, “ Having pro- cured several of these mollusks in pieces of timber, I extracted one, and placed it loose in my aquarium, in the vague hope that it would perforate some sand- stone on which I placed it. It possessed the powers of locomotion, but made no attempt to bore. I then cut a piece of wood from the timber in which it had been found, and placed the Pholas in a hole a little

Sprinkled on bread-and-butter it makes a good sandwich."* “ Another Oyster Powder.—When the oysters are prepared by simmering in their own liquor, cut them across in thin slices ; dry them crisp, that they may be reduced to fine powder. Pack and use them for sauces, as truffles or morrels.”f “ Oysters on Toast.—Open oysters, put them in a pan with their liquor, a quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper, a wine glass of milk, two cloves, and a small piece of mace, if handy; boil a few minutes until set; mix one ounce of butter with half an ounce of flour; put it (in small pieces) in the pan; stir round, when near boiling pour over the toast and serve. A little sugar and the juice of a lemon is a great improvement."^ “ Oyster Toast.—Beard and pound a few oysters in a mortar ; when they form a paste add a little cream, and season them with pepper; get ready some nice pieces of toast, spread the oyster paste upon them, and place them for a few minutes in an oven to become warm. A little finely chopped pickle may be thrown upon the tops."§ “ Oyster Ketchup.—Pound the fish, and add to each pint of them one pint of sherry wine, one ounce of salt, powdered mace two drachms, pepper one drachm. Boil up, skim, strain; add to each pint two tea- spoonfuls of brandy, then bottle, to flavour sauces when oysters are out of season." || * ‘ Enquire Within upon Everything. + ‘ Indian Domestic Economy.’ % ‘ All About Oysters.’ § Idem. || ‘ Dictionary of Practical Receipts,’ by G.

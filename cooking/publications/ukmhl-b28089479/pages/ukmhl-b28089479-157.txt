141 OSTREADiE. OYSTER. I to the height of a foot or a foot and a half, tied with strino1 at both ends and across the centre. These © baskets contain a hundred or more oysters, according to their size. There is another species of oyster largely cultivated in the French oyster-beds, which I have already men- tioned, viz., Ostrea angulata (the Grypliceci angulata, of Lamarck), the Tagus oyster, and quantities are consumed in England, where they are known by the name of Anglo-Portuguese. Its introduction and acclimatization in France are due to an accidental case.* A vessel bound from Portugal was laden with a cargo of this oyster. Having entered the Gironde, after a long passage, the captain, believing the oysters dead, threw the cargo overboard, upon an old oyster- bed named the Richard bed. Having found in the Gironde a soil nearly identical with that which they came from, and conditions favourable to their propaga- tion, the oysters multiplied in such proportions that from the Pointe de Grave to the above Richard bed, an extent of thirty kilometres, they form one vast bed. The taste and flavour are very different to that of our native oysters. It delights in muddy and brackish waters, and is suitable for sending long distances, as the lower valve is deep and holds much water. M. Paul Fischer says that it belongs essentially to the Littoral Zone, and is uncovered at each tide, and everywhere distributed where limpets are found.f The first im- portation of Ostrea angulata to the Arcachon beds from Lisbon was in 1866. * ‘Oyster Culture in France,’ Translation of Report, by M.

CAKDIADJE.—COCKLE. 57 I siphons, shell, and all, is jerked away in an uncouth manner.” There is another cockle found also at Paignton, which is even more scarce than Cardium rusticum, viz. Gardium aculeatum; it is larger and not so solid, with long spines on each rib, and is of a pale brownish-pinlc or flesh colour. It is very good to eat. I have had splendid specimens sent to me, alive, from Paignton, in a jar, with seaweed ; some measuring more than three inches in length, and two-and-a-half in breadth, and I have taken them myself at Langston Point, near Dawlish. The foot of the animal is long, and of a reddish-pink, but not nearly so vivid or brilliant in colour as that of Gardium rusticum. It is also an inhabitant of the Mediterranean. Paignton method of Cooking the Red-nosed Goclcle.— Cleanse them for a few hours in cold spring water, and then fry them in a batter made of bread-crumbs.* Cockle Soup.—After the cockles have been well washed, place them in a stew-pan over a slow fire till they open, and then take them out of their shells. Put an ounce of butter or lard, some finely-chopped parsley, a sliced onion, a little pepper, and a teaspoon- ful of anchovy, into a saucepan, with a little flour, and fry till it becomes brown. To this add a pint of water, or a pint and a half of milk, and when it boils, place in your cockles. Let it boil again for half an hour, then serve. The cockles being large will require to be cut in halves or quarters, previous to their being put into the soup ; and the quantity required would be about two pounds’ weight.

PATELLID.3E. LIMPET. 175 I The Patcllidce were also among the shellfish eaten by the ancients ; Diphilns says they have a pleasant flavour, are easily digested, and when boiled are particularly nice.* It is a curious fact, and one which is puzzling to archasologists, that limpet shells should be found in such abundance in cromlechs, both in the Channel Islands and in Brittany, surrounding the remains of the dead, often covering the bones, skulls, &c., to the depth of two and three feet in thickness. Mr. F. C. Lukis, in the ‘ Journal of the Archaeological Association ’ (vol. i. p. 28), mentions finding limpet- shells, mixed with earth, round the bones in the Crom- lech du Tus, or de Hus, Guernsey. Again, in a Cromlech in Jersey, discovered in April, 1848, Mr. Lukis adds that there is a difficulty in solving the great question— why such a mass of limpet shells should invariably accompany these abodes of the dead ? They are found not only in the earliest deposits, but also amongst the more recent, f The term “ Cromlech/' as applied to the Cromlech du Tus, is a local name, used in the Channel Islands for a subterranean chamber, lined with upright slabs, covered by a roof of one or more slabs of stone, with a long passage leading to it, formed in like manner of upright slabs covered by large lintels, over which has been raised a tumulus of earth; while our term Cromlech is applied to those covered by one capstone only, with- out any passage leading to them.J Those consisting of chambers and a long entrance passage covered by slabs, within a large tumulus of earth, as at Wellow, * Athenceus, ‘ Deipn.’ vol. i. bk. iii. p. 152. t 1 Journal ot the Archeological Association/ vol. iv. p. 336. t Sec Sir Gardiner Wilkinson, ‘ British Remains on Dartmoor ’ * Journal of the Archeological Association/ vol. xviii. 1863.

The shells of these, measured four inches in length, and two and a half inches in breadth.

In the ‘ Field/ November 15th, 1862, is an interesting account of au experiment made on oysters that had become so im- pregnated with copper as to be as green as verdigris. They were taken from Falmouth harbour. An at- tempt was made to extract the copper from them ; and, after putting a hundred or more into a large crucible, reducing them to ashes, and continuing to increase the heat until the copper was melted; the produce was a bright bead of pure copper, which, ac- cording to the description, would be about the size of a large pin’s head.

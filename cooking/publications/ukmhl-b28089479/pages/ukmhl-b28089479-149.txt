133 OSTREADiE.—OYSTER. I cultivation on the Northumbrian coast. They were imported and established there, and in the year 1865 the fisheries were allowed to commence, when they were found to have succeeded admirably, but since then the sand has destroyed the oysters. Messrs. Fox-bes and Hanley state that since the introduction of steamboats and railroads, considerable quantities of sea-oysters are brought from Falmouth and Helford, in Cornwall, also from Scotland and Ireland; the Irish oysters coming mostly from Carlingford, Mala- hide, Lissadell, Burran, Arklow, and Wexford; but the ‘ Report of the Irish Fishery Commissioners/ in 1874, gave a most unsatisfactory account of many of these fisheries; and it is said that the Carlingford beds, once so productive, are nearly dredged out, and in 1876 the take did not exceed a few thousands. The Wexford and Tralee beds were in the same condition, from over dredging and a succession of bad spatting years. It is not lawful to sell oysters in Ireland in the months of May, June, and July. The Wexford men dredged for them, of course, in the other months, but one reason of the beds being badly stocked was, that in the closed months they were regularly dredged by Beaumaris boats, which replenished their own exhausted beds with them ; and in 1 863 a French lugger visited Wexford seven times, carrying off on each occasion a large quantity of oysters for “ laying down ” on the French coast.* The amount of oysters taken on the principal natural oyster-beds in 1876, off Arklow, was 7520 barrels of 450 each, large and small, at prices from 18#. to 24s. del. per barrel. In 1875, 13,640 barrels * ‘ Morning Post,’ Aug. 29th, 1804.

14 EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLDSCA. valve, and one in the other; exterior covered with an olivaceous epidermis, concentrically striated. Breadth 1 inch, length from 7 to 8 inches. The razor or spout-fishes are all good for food, but Solen siliqua, which is the largest of our British species, is the one generally collected for that purpose. Solen ensis is eaten in the Feroe Isles, and is there called Langslcoel; and Solen marginatus, commonly known as Vagina, is greatly prized as an article of food by the Neapolitans. This last-named species has a wide range abroad, but is not so common in this country as the two above-mentioned shells, though it is abundant in some localities, amongst others Rye, Tenby, and the Channel Islands. In the Isle of Man the razor-fish is called Eeast-gholvirragli. The razor-shell is the aulo of the Romans; and Aristotle, in his ‘ History of Animals/ gives a descrip- tion of it, stating that “ it buries itself in the sand, can rise and sink in, but does not leave its hole, is soon alarmed by noise, and buries itself rapidly; and that the valves of the shell are connected together at both sides, and their surface smooth.5’* However, according to Dr. J. G. Jeffreys, the power of locomotion of the Solen is not confined to burrowing; as they can dart from place to place in the water as quickly as the scallop, and apparently in the same way. In the time of Athenasus it was much eaten, and highly valued, if we may judge from the following quotations in his * Deipnosophists — “ Araros says, in his f Campylion,5— « These now are most undoubted delicacies, Cockles and solens. * Forbes nnd Hanley, * Brit.

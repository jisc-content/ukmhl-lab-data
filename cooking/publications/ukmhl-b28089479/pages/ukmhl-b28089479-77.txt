MYTILIDjE.—MUSSEL. 61 grown mussels, which are ready for sale, are planted on the houchots nearest the shore. The fishermen gather enormous quantities of fresh mussels every day, and take them in carts, or on. the backs of horses, “ to La Rochelle, and other places, from whence they are sent as far as Tours, Limoges and Bordeaux/5 It appears that the French mussel breeders have discovered that mussels which live suspended to piles, or ropes of vessels, nets, &c., attain to a larger size, than those which live on the bottom, be it sandy, rocky or muddy; they therefore suspend thick ropes to wooden piles, and the mussels adhere by their byssus to them, the ropes are then tightened a little to prevent the animals lying on the bottom.* The fishermen of Cherbourg consider that there are two distinct varieties of the common mussel, viz., Mytilus incurvatus and Mytilus achatinus. The former is usually sold under the name of Cayev, and is much esteemed by the consumers of mussels, the flesh being more delicate and easier of digestion; and it is also stated, that the shell of this species is never inhabited by the Pinnotheres, which is often found in the common mussel. The Gayeu is generally to be found on the rocks, where it lives rather isolated • while the common mussel is found on the muddy sand. The second variety, viz., Mytilus achatinus, is to be met with onlv in the neighbourhood of the “ Grand-Vey,55 and then only at spring-tides. It is much less esteemed as food, as it is tougher than Mytilus incurvatus. It is sold at Cherbourg under the name of la Blonde, on account of its colour, f * l’lnpsoii's ‘ Utilization of Minute Life,’ pp. 163, 164. t ‘ Essiiie d’un Catalogue ties Mullusques, murins, teiTcstres et fluviatiles,’ par At.

EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. 99 fi snail on the dinner table at Vienna; they were served up plain, boiled in their shells, or stuffed with force- meat. At Naples, snails are generally kept in bran for a week or two, or for two or three days, before they are considered good for the table. They live on the bran, which is said to fatten them. When first the snails are gathered from the hedges, &c., it is a necessary precaution to starve them for a few days, and not to eat them at once, as they feed on poisonous plants, such as the deadly nightshade, poppy, datura, &c.; cases of poisoning by snails having oc- curred where they had been gathered near, or had fed upon these noxious plants. It is a mistake to suppose that the only snails used as food are the Helix pomatia and Helix aspersa.* These are naturally preferred on account of their larger size, which makes them less troublesome to eat; but a variety of small kinds of snails, nineteen species in all, including those above mentioned, are also em- ployed in cookery on the Continent, and there is no reason why they should not be as good as the others, nor is’ there any reason why we should not use snails, and many other molluscous animals, which we now throw aside, but -which are doubtless quite as palatable and as wholesome as other kinds which our prejudices permit us to indulge in.

Docteur Ebrard, in his f Des Escargots, au point de vue de TAlimentation, de la Viticulture, et de [’Horticulture,’ gives an interesting account of the use * Helix aspersa has a variety of names in France, and in the north it is called Colimagon, Jardiniere, and Aspergill*; at Montpellier, Caragunlo; in Bordelais, Caguuil/e, Litnaou, and Li mat; in Provence, Escargot, and Escourgol; at Avignon, Caragoou and Contar; Banarut at Arles ; and Bujaina at Uras.-i.—Ur.

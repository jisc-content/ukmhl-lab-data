HELICIDA5.— SNAIL. 233 abundance. Much amusement was afforded to the Spaniards by Rossmassler throwing away the delicate animal, and only retaining its shell, which to them was worthless, but most valuable to him as a conchologist. Upon one occasion, on arriving at a posada, he found the hotel people sitting down to their midday meal, before a great dish of snails. He says :—“ One look satisfied me that they were of a rare kind, for which I had sought in vain, and I immediately seized upon some of the empty shells, which caused a universal laugh.

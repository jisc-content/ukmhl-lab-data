AVICULID2E.—SEA-WING. 101 At the Bahrein fisheries the trade is in the hands of the merchants, who hear hard on the divers, and even those who make the greatest exertions in diving can scarcely obtain a sufficiency of food.* The hardships and sufferings endured by the divers are very great. After a long dive, we are told that the natives of the Paamuto Islands may be seen squatting on the reefs with blood gushing from the ears and nose, and become quite blind for ten or twenty minutes. Sir William Denison tells us, that the pearl-fishery of Tuttukudi or Tutikorin, in the Gulf of Manaar, has been rather productive of late years. The leading man of the pearl-divers was presented to him, and he wore, as a sort of badge of office, a gold shell with a pearl inside.t Mr. Edward Eae mentions having purchased some fairly good pearls at Archangel, from the pearl-fisheries on the Terski coast. Pearls are occasionally found by the men employed in Birmingham in making pearl- buttons, in the mother-of-pearl shells imported for that purpose. A few years since, it is stated that a small number of shells were brought to Birmingham, which, either by mistake, or through ignorance, had not been cleared of the pearls at the fishery, and a considerable number were found, and sold by the man who had bought the shells for working into buttons. One pearl sold for £40; the purchaser is believed to have re-sold it for £160, and it was said to have been offered for sale in Paris, afterwards, for £800.§ * McCullock’s ‘ Commercial Dictionary.’ f ‘Varieties of Vice-Regal Life,’ by Sir William Denison, KC.B., p. 199.

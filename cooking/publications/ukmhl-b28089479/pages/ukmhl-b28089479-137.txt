121 PECTINIDJE. SCALLOP. versely; auricles nearly the same size; ligament in- ternal; hinge without teeth. This is the common scallop of the people, and much smaller than the “ Great scallop/' also subject to greater variety of colour. Specimens are found quite white, with a dark red line on the summit of each of the radiated ribs (var. lineatus), also brown, yellow, speckled white and brown, purplish-pink, and orange. The specimen figured was dredged up off the Parson and Clerk rocks at Dawlish, and at times there may be gathered basketfuls on the beach between that town, and the mouth of the Exe. The shells are much used in ornamental work; and pretty baskets, pin- cushions, needle-books, &c., are made from the beauti- ful variegated valves. The scallop may be called the butterfly of the ocean, from its power of swimming or flying rapidly through the water. This was observed by Pliny, who says that the scallop is able to dart above the surface of the water, just like an arrow.* By some this power is supposed to be caused by the rapid opening and shut- ting of the valves, but Mr. Gosse states that, after carefully watching the habits of a Pecten, which he kept for some days in a glass phial of sea-water, he discovered that the flitting motion was performed by forcing jets of water through the compressed edges of the mantle. He says, “ When the Pecten is about to leap, it draws in as much water as it can contain with- in the mantle, while the lips are held firmly in contact. At this instant the united edges of the lips are slightly drawn inward; and this action gives sure warning of the coming leap. The moment after this is observed, * Pliny, ‘Nat. Hist.’ vol. ii. bk. ix. ch. 45 (29).

The flesh is said to have a peculiar taste, consequently that of the cuttle-fish and calmar (loligo) is preferred. At Naples, shellfish mer- chants of Sta. Lucia sell them ready cooked, f At Venice, Octopi were sold ready boiled, and taken hot from the cauldron.J I have seen them in the market at Palma, Majorca, where they are called “Pop.” These Octopods, called Octopodia by the modern Greeks, are regularly exposed for sale in the markets of Smyrna, as they are in the bazaars in India; and on the coast of the Red Sea the inhabitants fish up a great quantity of Poiilps, which they both eat and sell.§ The North American Indians are also partial to them. Plato, the comic writer, says;— “ Good-sized polypus in season Should he boiled,—to roast them’s treason, But if eurly, and not big, Roast them ; boil’d ain’t worth a fig.” M.

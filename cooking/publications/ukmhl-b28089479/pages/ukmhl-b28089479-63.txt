Those pearls which are clustered together in the form of a blackberry, are said by them to be thus produced. Nor is this belief peculiar to Java, as a Spanish lady informed a friend of mine, that, if seed-pearls were shut up in cotton-wool, they would increase either in size or in number ? The ex- perience of our jewellers is, that the effect of cotton- wool on pearls is to injure their colour, and make them yellow. But it is said to preserve them, if they are kept in a box with a piece of the root of ash, or in dry magnesia. The tears of Chinese mermaids are said to be pearls.\ Shakespeare says,— “ Love’s feeling is more soft and sensitive Tban are the horns of cockled snails.” * ‘ Household Words,’ vol. iii. p. 80, “My Pearl-fishing Expedition.” f Forbes, ‘Oriental Memoirs,’ vol. iii. p. 180.

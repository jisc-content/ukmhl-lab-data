AVICULIM. SEA-WING. 87 fishes, which come leaping by close to it, and being unmolested grow so bold as to skip into its shell and fill it full. The Pinnoteres, waiting for the opportunity, gives notice to the Pinna by a gentle pinch; upon which, shutting its mouth, it kills whatever is within the shell, and divides the spoil with its companion.”* * * § Mr. Say f says, that a small crab (a species of Pinno- teres), which lives in the shell of the common American oyster (Ostrea virginica),is much valued by oyster eaters in the United States, and that in opening a large quantity of oysters, these little crabs are collected apart, and serve to gratify the palate of gourmands. They are only seven-twentieths of an inch long, by two-fifchs wide.J The byssus, or silky thread of the Pinna, is called by the Sicilian fishermen, lana penna, and is manufactured into a silken fabric. It was known to the ancients, and called by them pinna-wool, and by the Tarentines lana pesca, or fish-wool. St. Basil, Bishop of Ceesarea, in Cappadocia, meDtions it in one of his homilies, saying, c' \\ hence had the Pinna its gold-coloured wool, that colour which is inimitable ? Gibbon states that the Romans called the Pinna “ the silk-worm of the sea,” and that a robe made from the silk was the gift of a Roman Emperor to one of the Satraps of Armenia. In Aufrere's travels is a description of the mode of collecting these shellfish by the Neapolitans, and of the manufacture of different articles from the silk :— * Pliny, ‘ Nat.

125 OSTUEADiE. OYSTER. purplish-pink; transversely striated. Hinge tooth- less ; ligament internal, of an olivaceous-brown ; beaks small. The interior of the shell white and polished, sometimes fixe purplish-pink colour of the margins showing through. The edible oyster of Great Britain is supposed to be superior to those of other European countries, and to attain to a greater degree of perfection on our coasts ; and it was much valued by the Romans, who trans- planted numbers from our shores, and placed them in artificial beds in the Lucrine Lake. Sergius Orata is said to have first invented the artificial oyster-beds, “ not for the gratification of gluttony, but of avarice, as he contrived to make a large income by this exercise of his ingenuity/’* M. Dabry de Thersant in a number of the ‘ China Review,’ as quoted in the ‘ Flight of the Lapwing,’ states, that artificial oyster- beds were formed in China long before they are known to have existed amongst the Romans, and, while in Europe essays and pamphlets are being written on the theory of the subject, the practical Chinese have been obtaining good results for the last 1800 years, notwith- standing the fact that they have no clear ideas as to the nature of the oyster or its means of reproduction. Apicius first discovered the art of preserving oysters fresh for a considerable time, and sent some from Italy to the Emperor Trajan, while he was on an expedition against the Parthians, which were found on their arrival to be as good as on the day they were gathered.f This mode may possibly have been the same as that which is practised in Italy at the present day, where, as Poli * Pliny. ‘Nat.

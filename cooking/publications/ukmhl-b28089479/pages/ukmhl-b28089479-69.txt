CAltDIADJE. COCKLE. 53 liquor and a little water, thicken with flour and butter, adding pepper, salt, a little mace, and some cream. Soger’s Porridge of Cockles, oysters or mussels, for the poor. They make a most nourishing and palatable food, and on the coast a very economical one.—Take two dozen oysters, or if you use cockles or mussels, take a quart of either, put them into an earthen jar with their liquor, and three tablespoonfuls of flour; place it on the fire, and stir them round and round ; add a little salt and pepper, and they are done. Eat them thus, or add them to soup or porridge. A little dripping or lard is an improvement, also a bay-leaf, mint, or an onion sliced. Scalloped Cockles.—Wash the cockles well, then scald some dozens of them; strain the liquor into a stew-pan, and add thereto two ounces of butter, mixed with two ounces of flour, a little cream, anchovy, nutmeg, and cayenne ; stir the sauce over the fire, to boil and reduce, for ten minutes, then add a couple of yolks of eggs, a little lemon-juice, and some chopped parsley ; add the cockles ; stir all together over the fire for a few minutes, and fill some scallop shells with this prepara- tion. Cover them over with a thick coating of fried bread-crumbs; place them on a baking-sheet in the oven for five minutes, and serve hot.* Ragout of Cockles.—Clean your cockles, open them and take them out of their shells, toss up some mush- rooms in butter, put in your cockles with a bunch of sweet herbs, and moisten the whole with half of their own liquor, and as much fish-broth ; add some parsley shred small, and some pepper ; when ready, thicken * Fruncatelli.

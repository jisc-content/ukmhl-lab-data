PECTINIDiE. SCALLOP. 1 11 Galicians took the scallop shell as the sign of St. James.”* The port where the body of St. James was landed was called Tria Flavia, now Padron.f In those days there reigned over the country a certain queen named “ Lupa,” and she and her people were plunged in wickedness and idolatry. Now, having come to shore, they laid the body of the Apostle upon a great stone, which became like wax, and, receiving the body, closed around it. This was a sign that the saint willed to remain there; but the wicked queen Lupa was displeased, and commanded that some wild bulls should be harnessed to a car, and that the body, with the self-formed tomb, should be placed on it, hoping that it would be dragged to destruction. But in this she was mistaken, for the wild bulls, when signed by the cross, became as docile as sheep, and they drew the body of St. James straight into the court of her palace. When queen Lupa beheld this miracle, she was confounded, and she and all her people became Christians, and she built a magnificent Church to receive the sacred remains, and died in the odour of sanctity. But then came the darkness and ruin, which, during the invasion of the Barbarians, overshadowed all Spain, and the body of the Apostle was lost, and no one knew where to find it, until the year 800.

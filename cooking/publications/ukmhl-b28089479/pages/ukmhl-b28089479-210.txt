EDIBLE BRITISH M0LLT3SCA. 194 large cans to Hull, and other places for the cod-fisherv. This bait-fishing lasts about a fortnight. The fishermen know whelks by the following names, viz., Conches or Buekies; and at Yougbal they call them Googawns, and Cuckoo shells. In ‘ Popular History of the Mollusea/ by Miss Roberts, she mentions this species of shell being used in North Wales as trumpets by the farmers, for calling their labourers; and shells of a similar kind are also used in Muscovy and Lithuania by the herdsmen for col- lecting their cattle, horses, mules, goats, and sheep. The Italian herdsmen use them also. Dr. William Russell tells us, that at Casamicciola, in the Island of Ischia, morning, noon, and night, the air was filled with the monotonous notes of conch shells, sounded bv the watchers over the vineyards and gardens, to scare away thieves and birds.* In some parts of Staffordshire the farmers call up their cattle by means of a horn or trumpet. In Tahiti shells were also used as trumpets—a species of murex being the kind generally employed for that purpose. The largest shells were selected, sometimes a foot in diameter at the mouth. A perforation, about an inch in diameter, was made near the apex of the shell, in which was inserted a bamboo cane, three feet in length, secured by being bound to the shell, the aperture rendered air-tight by the outsides of it being cemented with a resinous gum from the bread-fruit tree. These shells were blown when any procession marched to the temple, and at other religious ceremonies; besides being used by the herald, and on board the native fleets.

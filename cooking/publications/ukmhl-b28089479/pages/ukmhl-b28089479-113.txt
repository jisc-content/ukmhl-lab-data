AVICULimE.—SEA-WING. 97 was priceless.” In 1 779 a pearl, which from its shape was called the “ Sleeping Lion/’ was offered for sale at St. Petersburg, by a Dutchman; it weighed 578 carats, and was bought in India for £4500. The largest pearl known, I believe, is in the possession of Mr. Beresford Hope; it weighs three ounces, and is two inches long, and two and a half inches in circum- ference, aud is set as a pendant: and the pearl necklace of the Empress of the French is one of the finest known. The Shah of Persia has a pearl valued at £60,000.* In India rose-coloured pearls are much esteemed, for red pearls (Loliitamukti) form one of the seven precious objects which it was incumbent to use in the adornment of Buddhistic reliquaries, and to distribute at the building of a Dagopa.f Marco Polo states, that in the island of “Chipangu” (the kingdom of Japan), the Chinese “ Jih-pan-kive,” rose-coloured pearls were abundant, and quite as valuable as the white ones, and that there some of the dead were buried and others were burnt, and that when a body was burnt they put one of these rose- coloured pearls in the mouth “ for such is their custom.”% These rose-coloured pearls were no doubt those found in the conch shells. The most productive pearl-fishery banks lie on the west coast of Ceylon, between the eighth and ninth degree of north latitude, near the level dreary beach of Condatchy, Aripo, and Manaar.§ The other principal * ‘A Manual of Precious Stones and Antique Gems,’ by Hodder M.

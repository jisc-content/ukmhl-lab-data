CARDIADA5.—COCKLE. 41 whicli the surrounding- soil is mud, at too great a depth to be disturbed by storms, the Isocardia of our Irish Sea patiently collects its food from the sur- rounding element, assisted in its choice by the current it is capable of creating by the alternate opening and closing of its valves.” The Mediterranean species of this bivalve are smaller than those found on our coasts, and there are no less than five or six kinds known in the European and Indian seas.* Epimarchus, in his play of the ‘ Marriage of Hebe/ mentions shellfish of all kinds, and says,— “And bring too the black Cockle, which keeps the cockle-hunter on the stretch.”f This may possibly refer to the oxhorn-cockle. The wife of a coastguardsmau, who had lived many years at Brixham, and had often luxuriated in a dish of these delicious shellfish, gave me the following recipe for cooking them :— To dress Torbay noses.—Wash the shells well, then boil them till they open—about ten minutes or so; take the fish out of the shells and put them into a fry- ing-pan with some butter, a little salt and pepper, and fry till they are of .a good brown colour; then serve.

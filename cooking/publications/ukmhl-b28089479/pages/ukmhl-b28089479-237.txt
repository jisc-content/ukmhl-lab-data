221 HELICIMS. SNAIL. malady. They must gather them themselves, pound them and put them into little bags, which are worn round the neck. As soon as the fever leaves them, they bury their bags at the foot of the walls of the chapel, and if they fail to perform this ceremony, the fever returns. Mrs. Palliser adds, “ we found quantities of these bags made of course linen, lying half-buried under the walls of the chapel.” * I have been told that a large trade in snails is carried on for Covent Garden market in the Lincoln- shire Fens, and that they are sold at 6d. per quart, and upon further inquiry I find that snails are still much used for consumptive patients and weakly children; also as salves for corns put between ivy leaves; and as food for birds. In the manufacture of cream they are also much employed, bruised in milk and boiled, and a retired milkman pronounced it the most successful imitation known. It appears that not only are the Helicidce nourishing to the human species, but that they have a beneficial effect upon sheep, giving a richness to the flavour of the mutton. Dr Jeffreys, in his 'British Concholoery/ quotes the following passage from Borlase’s 'Natural History of Cornwall—"The sweetest mutton is reckoned to be that of the smallest sheep, which usually feed on the commons where the sands are scarcely covered with the green-sod, and the grass exceedingly short; such are the towens or sand-hillocks in Piran-saud, Gvvythian, Philne, and Senau Green, near the Land's End, and elsewhere in like situations. From these sands come forth snails of the turbinated kinds, but of different species, and all sizes, from the # 1 Brittiiuy and its Byewnys.’

EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSC A. 264 kind of Cuttle-jisli, but different from the Sepia, and has ink of a pale colour. Alexis talks of cooking them thus :— “ I took the teuthides, cut off their fins, Adding a little fat, I then did sprinkle Some thin shred herbs o’er all, for seasoning.” Bk. vii. c. 130, Aiken., Deipno sophists. And Antiphanes, in his ‘ Female Fisher/ says (refer- ring to the ink) :— “ Give me some cuttle-fish first. O Hercules, Thej’ve dirtied every place with ink ; here, take them, And wash them clean.” According to Pliny, Anaxilaus states that the ink of the Sepia is possessed of suck remarkable potency that if it is put into a lamp, the light will become entirely changed, and all present will look as black as Ethiopians.* The ink of the Cuttle, or Sepia, is dried, and imported from China to Liverpool, where it arrives either in cakes, or is there made into cakes called Sepia, which is used in painting. Dr. Lankester, in his little work on ‘ Animal Products/ says that the Cuttle-fisli is very abundant in the Mediterranean, and that the ink-bag is carefully extracted, the liquid being poured out to allow of its drying as quickly as possible. It is then triturated with a little caustic soda, or potash, and after- wards boiled with caustic lye for half an hour, when it is filtered, and the caustic liquid is then treated with an acid till it is neutralized. After standing, a pre- cipitate falls, which is collected, washed with water, and finally dried by a gentle heat. This substance is the dark pigment used by artists under the name of Sepia. * Pliny, ‘Nat. Hist.’ vol. vi. bk. xxxii. c. 52.

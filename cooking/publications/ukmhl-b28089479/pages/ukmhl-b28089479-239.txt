HEL1CID.E. SNAIL. 223 i unexpected appearance that they gave up the castle to the besiegers. The Romans were very partial to snails as an article of food, and fed them till they grew to a large size. Several sorts are mentioned by Pliny, and they were all kept separate; amongst others, white ones that were found in the neighbourhood of Rieti. He describes the Illyrian snails as the largest (probably Helix lucorum, or Helix cincta), the African as the most prolific; others from Soletum, in the Neapolitan terri- tory, as the noblest and best. He also speaks of some as attaining to so enormous a size that their shells would contain eighty pieces of money of the common currency,* that is to say, eighty quadrantes, the quadrans being a small copper coin three-quarters of an inch in diameter, about the size of a new sixpence, and one-sixteenth of an inch thick. This statement of Pliny’s is really not so improbable as may appear at first sight, for on trying how many sixpences a usual- sized specimen of our largest snail, Helix pomatia, would hold, I find that about forty could easily be put into it; and very fine specimens are to be found in the neighbourhood of the Mont Grenier, in Savoy, which would certainly hold more than forty. In the museum of the Jardin des Plantes, in Paris, there are two specimens of this Helix from Moldavia, nearly twice the size of the usual ones, measuring about two and a quarter inches in breadth, and which would easily hold eighty sixpences. Fulvius Iiirpinus studied the art of fattening them with so much success, that some of his snails would * Kirby’s ‘History of Animals,’&c., ‘Bridgewater Treatise,’ vol. i. p. 281.

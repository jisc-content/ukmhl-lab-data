EDIBLE BRITISH J10LLUSCA. 196 that a chank, in which the whorls were reversed, and ran from right to left, instead of from left to right, was regarded with such reverence, that a specimen formerly sold for its weight in gold, hut that now one may be had for £4 or £5. The Chinese also hold reversed chank- shells in special veneration, and give high prices for them. They are kept in the Pagodas by the priests and used on special occasions, and the consecrated oil is kept in one of these sinistrorsal Turbinellidce, with which the Emperor is anointed at his coronation.* Prom the earliest ages the Gulf of Manaar has been fished for chanks. Perforated conch shells, both a- Triton (T. variegatum ?), and a large conical Strombus, perforated at the apex of the spire, not on the side of one of the upper whorls, as in the case of the Triton, are used by the natives of New Guinea, Humboldt Bay, or “ Talok Lintju."—They are highly prized by them and make a booming noise.f A species of Triton was used formerly by the Indians of South America as a trumpet, and a specimen was dug up at Canete, in Peru. The shell was called “ Bosina,” on account of the sound produced by blowing into it resembling the roar of a bull, and it was used to announce the approach of any great man into a town. It was ornamented with tassels of human hair, and a leather strap of exquisite workmanship. Mr. Walter Shaw, of the Pacific Steam Navigation Company, at Callao, is said to have it iu his possession. :£ Dr. Potter, in his f Archaeologia Grseca/ vol. ii., states that the ancient Greeks used shells as trumpets * Lubbock’s ‘ Prehistoric Times,’ vol. i. p. 222. t ‘ A Naturalist on the ‘ Challenger.’ + ‘ Two Years iu Peru,’ by Thomas Hutchinson,’ vol. i. p. 134.

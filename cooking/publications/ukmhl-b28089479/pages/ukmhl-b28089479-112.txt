A large mausoleum or Mahometan tomb was erected to his memory in the suburbs of Cambay, with an inscription, telling us that during this terrible scarcity, the deceased had offered a measure of pearls for an equal quantity of grain, but not being able to procure it, he died of hunger.* In ‘ History and Mystery of Precious Stones/ re- viewed in the ‘ Morning Post/ Feb. 4th, 1884, we read, that pearls bave for ages been significant of tears. Queen Margaret Tudor, cousin of James IV. of Scot- land, previous to the battle of Flodden Field, had strong presentiments of the disastrous issue of that conflict. She had fearful dreams, and in one vision she beheld abundant pearls, the emblems of widow- hood and mourning. A few nights before the assas- sination of Henry IV. of France, his consort, Marie de Medicis, dreamed that all the jewels in her crown were changed into pearls, and she was told that it signified she would weep greatly. A peai’l is described by Madame de Barrera as nearly the size of a pigeon’s egg, and pear-shaped; it weighed 250 carats, and was known as “ La Pere- o-rina/’ and belonged to the crown of Spain. It was brought from Panama in 1560 by Don Diego de Temes, who presented it to Philip IT. “ It was then valued at fourteen thousand ducats, but Freco, the kind’s jeweller, having seen it, said it might be worth £14°000, £30,000, £50,000, £100,000, as such a pearl * Forbes’ ‘Oriental Memoirs,’ vol. ii p. 18.

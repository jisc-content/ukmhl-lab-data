OSTREAD^E. OYSTER. 157 name of “ Anglo-Dutch.” Dr. Knapp tells us that not less than 800,000 tubs of oysters, each tub contain- ing two English bushels, are annually procured from the Normandy coast for the English market and the Channel Islands, and large quantities are sent from Arcachon. The principal oyster fisheries on the French coast are those of Courseulles- sur-Mer, Les Sables d’Olonne, Marennes, and La Tremblade, which are used simply for rearing and fattening purposes; and those which may be regarded as places of reproduction, are Granville, Cancale, Auray, Vannes, lie d’Oleron, and Arcachon.* An interesting paragraph appeared in the ‘ Times/ November 13th, 1862, on the cultivation of oysters on the western coast of France. It is as follows:— “ M. Coste has just communicated a paper to the Academy of Sciences on the progress of his artificial oyster-beds. Several thousands of the inhabitants of the island of Re have been for the last four years en- gaged in cleansing their muddy coast of the sediments which prevented oysters from congregating there, and as the work advances, the seed, wafted from Nieulle and other oyster localities, settles in the new beds, and, added to that transplanted, peoples the coast; so that 72,000,000 of oysters from one to four years old, and nearly all marketable, is the lowest average re- gistered per annum by the local administration, repre- senting at the rate of from 25 to 30 francs per thousand, which is the current price in the locality, a sum of about two millions of francs, the produce of an extremely limited surface.

72 EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSC A. The pearl-mussels are collected in the same manner now, viz., by wading for them in shallow pools, or by thrusting a long stick between the valves when the shell is open. When a number have been collected they are left to decompose, when the pearls drop out.* They may also be found in Kerry, in the Moy, near Foxford, and in many of the other Irish rivers; and Mr. Buckland stated in the 1 Field/ December 10th, 1864, that they abound near Oughterard, and that a man called “ Jemmy the Pearl-catcher” told him he knew when a mussel had a pearl in it, without re- quiring to open it first, because “ she (the mussel) sits upright with her mouth in the mud, and her back is crooked/’ that is, it is corrugated like a cow’s horn. Bruce, in his e Travels/ observes that the pearl-fishers of Bahrein informed him that they had no expectation of finding a pearl when the shell was smooth and per- fect, but were sure to find some when the shell was distorted, and deformed; and he adds that this applies equally to the Scotch pearl-mussels. In France they also collect pearls from the pearl-mussels, and they generally sell them as foreign pearls. At Omagh, in the north of Ireland, there was formerly a pearl-fishery, and Gilbert, Bishop of Limerick, about 1094, sent a present of Irish pearls to Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury. Pearls were much used in Irish religious ornaments in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Scotch pearls were in demand abroad as early as the twelfth century. In the fourteenth century (1355) Scotch pearls are referred to in a statute of the Parisian goldsmiths, by which it was enacted that no worker in gold or silver should set them with oriental * * Tour in Ulster.’

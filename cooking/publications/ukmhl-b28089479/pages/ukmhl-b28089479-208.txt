192 EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. the extremity with a longitudinal mouth, armed with two strong cartilaginous lips, encloses the tongue, and a great part of the oesophagus. The tongue is armed with short spines, and acting in concert with the hard lips, which can be opened or shut, or strongly pressed together, it forms a sort of rasp or auger, by which very hard substances are rapidly perforated; and then the tongue being protruded, the hooked spines with which it is armed, are admirably fitted for the collection of food.55 Whelks are taken in great numbers in wicker baskets baited with offal, and Pliny describes the taking of “ purple fish ” by a similar method, viz., in a kind of osier kipe, called Nassis, baited with cockles.* Billings- gate market is chiefly supplied from Harwich and Hull, and some of the steamers from the North bring six or seven tons at a time.f Mr. Charles Harding, of King’s Lynn, informs us that the principal sources of the supply of whelks “ on that part of the coast are as follows : Saltfleet, about twenty miles from Grimsby, Sherringham, near Cromer, Lynn Deeps, Docking Channel, Blakeney Coast, Wells, Boston Deeps, Bran- caster, Thornham, and Hunstanton. The Lynn fishery supplies about 20,000 bags, or 1250 tons of whelks a year. . . . The average amount paid for them before the expense of boiling and carriage is about £10,000. The Great Grimsby fishery supplies about 150,000 wash of whelks annually. A wash contains 21 quarts and a pint, and the average price for the season would run about 3s. a wash, or a total of £22,500.

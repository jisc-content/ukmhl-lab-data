Oysters, mussels, and periwinkles, with shrimps, are the fisheries which engage a good number of fishermen at Leigh, near Southend. The Leigh shore has been found particularly well adapted to grow and fatten oysters. % Whitstable was a fishing-town of note in the reign of Henry VIII., and was called in ancient records “ Northwood.” Leland, in his ‘ Itinerary/ thus de- scribes it:—“Whitstable is upward junto Kent, a ii miles or more beyond Faversham, on the same shore, a great fisher-towne of one paroche, belonging to Plaze College, in Essex, and yt standetli on the se-shore. Ther about they dragge for oysters.” The dredgers of Whitstable do not trust entirely to the natural resources of their oyster-beds, but purchase from the Essex coast what is called the brood, which is the spat in its second stage. They also purchase oysters from Ireland, France, and Holland, and lay them down ou the Whitstable beds.

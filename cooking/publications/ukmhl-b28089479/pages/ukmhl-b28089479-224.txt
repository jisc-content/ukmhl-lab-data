In heraldry we find whelks used, and the arms of Sir John Slielley, of Maresfield, in Sussex, are sable, afess engrailed between three whelk-shells or. The Shelleys of Lincolnshire bear, argent a chevron gules, between three whelks sable;* and the crest of the Venables, of Cheshire, is a wyvern gules, issuing from a whelk-shell argent; and many other examples might be given.f A buccinum, or whelk, with a figure rising out of it, or rather looking out of it, is sculptured on tlie font in St. Clement’s Cburcb, Sandwich. It is said that the eider-duck when it has not more than one or two eggs in its nest, places a shell, Bucci- num glaciale, beside them. The usual number of eggs is from five to six. Western Norway Island, off the coast of Western Spitzbergen, is a well-known place where the eider-duck breeds in great numbers.^ Dublin Method of Cooking Whelks.—Cleanse them well, boil them till they can easily be taken from the shell, and then fry them with plenty of fat or butter, till they a,re brown. Whelk Soup.—Take two onions and cut them into small dice, fry them in a stew-pan with some butter; shake the pan well for a few minutes, add five heads of celery, two handfuls of spinach, two cabbage-lettuces cut small, and some parsley. Shake the pan again, put in two quarts of water, some crusts of bread, a teaspoonful of pepper, and a blade or two of mace. Let this boil gently for an hour.

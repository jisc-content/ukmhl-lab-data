SEPIADJE.—CUTTLE. 265 I The polypus is the symbol of Messina, and, according to Montfaucon, is figured on a medal of that city, with a man’s head on the reversed side. Pliny recommends the polypus for arresting haemor- rhage, it is bruised and then applied; and he further adds, concerning it, that of itself it emits a sort of brine, and therefore needs none to be used when it is cooked; that it should be sliced with a reed, as it is spoilt if an iron knife is used, “ becoming tainted thereby, owing to the antipathy which naturally exists between it and iron,” and Dalechamps suggests that this means, “ it being the nature of flesh to cling to the knife.”* In France, Octopus vulgaris is highly prized for bait, and is also considered very good as food, and in ‘ Life in Normandy ’ is the following recipe for cooking it: — “ A dish of cuttle-fish is divided in the centre by a slice of toast; on one side of the toast is a mass of cuttle-fish stewed with a white sauce, and on the other, a pile of them beautifully fried, of a clear even colour, without the slightest appearance of grease. The flour of haricot-bean, very finely ground, and which is as good as bread-crumbs, is added.” To Cook Cuttles (Mont St. Michel Recipe).—First place them in boiling water and allow them to remain some time in order to make them tender. Then cut them in ^pieces and boil them with vegetables and onions, then fry them in a paste made of batter. The water in which the fish has been boiled is used for soup.f “To Cook Cuttles.—First cleanse them thoroughly by scalding; then rub the body and legs (feelers ?) with * Pliny ‘ Nat. Hist.’ vol. vi. bk. xxxii. c. 42. + Ozenne.

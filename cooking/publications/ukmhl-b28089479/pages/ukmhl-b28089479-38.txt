EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. 0 0 Fam. MACTRIDJS. MACTRA.—TROUGH-SHELL. Mactra Solida, Linnaeus. Trough-shell. — Shell thick, opaque, of a yellowish-white colour, nearly equal- valved, covered at the sides with a brownish or drab- coloured epidermis; nearly triangular in form, ligament short and internal; beaks small; a Y-shaped cardinal tooth in one valve, with a long lateral tooth on each side, and fitting in the opposite valve into deep grooves, with tooth-like edges. Of the Mactridse, both Mactra solida and Mactra stultorum are sometimes eaten in England, but they are not considered very good, and are full of sand ; though the former is eaten in Devonshire; and Mr. Dennis (as quoted by Dr. Jeffreys, in his ‘British Conchology,) says that the people of Newhaven, near Brighton, eat the Mactra stultorum also. It appears that in 1861 the steam dredging-machines were at work at the mouth of the barbour, and that they turned up Mactra stultorum in great numbers, so that the beach at high- water mark was covered by them.* They live buried in the sand not very far from low-water mark and at no great depth from the surface. In Holland the shells of Mactra stultorum are used for making roads and foot-paths ; they are also burnt for lime, and the fish is eaten there. According to Poli, it is known in Italy by the name of Mezzana, at Naples Gongola, and in the Adriatic Bibaron colorito.f It is eaten at Yiareggio, with Mactra lactea, aud Mactra corallina * ‘ British Conchology,’ vol. ii. p. 424. f ‘ Tho Fisheries of the Adriatic,’ by George L.

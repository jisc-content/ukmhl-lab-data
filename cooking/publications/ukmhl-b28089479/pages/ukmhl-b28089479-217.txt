If the cloth be now washed with scalding water and soap, and laid again in the sun, the colour changes to a beautiful crimson, which suffers no further altera- tion from sun, or air, soap, alum, alkaline leys, or any of the substances used for assaying the permanency of colours. The juice of the purple-fish receives no colour itself, and communicates none to silk or linen, without ex- posure to the sun. It seems to be the light, and not the heat, of the sun, that calls forth the tincture ; for when the cloth is covered with thin opaque bodies, which transmit heat without light, no colour is produced, while transparent ones give no impediment to its pro- duction. The juice, itself, in close glass vessels becomes presently purple in the sun.* Lister, in 1680, mentions the discovery of a shellfish, Purpura Anglicana, on the shores of the Severn, in which there is a vein containing a juice giving the delicate and durable tincture of the rich Tyrian purple. A writer in the ‘ Annual Register ’ for 1760, says that, being “ at a gentleman’s house in the west of Ireland, he took particular notice of the gown of the lady of the house. It was a muslin flowered w'ith the most beautiful violet colour .... She told me it was her owu work, and took me to the seaside, where she gathered some little shells; . . . beating them open and extracting the liquor with the point of a clean pen, she marked some spots directly before me.” He adds:— “ 1 suppose a hundred fishes wouid not produce a drop as large as a pea.” Richard of Cirencester also mentions * ‘ Neilnmnn’s Chemistry,’ p. 510 ; the Memoirs of the French Academy for 1730.

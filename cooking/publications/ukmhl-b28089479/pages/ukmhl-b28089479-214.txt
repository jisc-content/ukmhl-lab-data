Some of the tobacco consecrated by having been long sus- pended to the coverings of the shell, was taken by the medicine men, and smoked to the “ Great Medicine.” During the ceremony every one listened most atten- tively, hoping to hear a sound proceed from the shell. At length some one imagined he heard a noise resem- bling a forced expiration of air from the lungs, and this was considered a favourable omeu, and the tribe prepared for the expedition confident of success. If on the contrary the shell obstinately remained silent, the result of the expedition was regarded as doubtful.* The natives of Usambara, in South Africa, according to the late Mr. Keith Johuson, the leader of the East African Expedition, in 1879, attach marvellous powers to a large land shell, a species of Achatina, imagining that it can ward off all forms of evil and witchcraft, and for this reason it was held in high repute, and they place the dead shells in little enclosures of stone iu their fields, and at the gateways of their villages, which are thus considered safe from the attacks of the enemy, or from disease .f Dr. Troost, in an account of some ancient remains discovered by him in Tennesee, mentions the finding of a large conch shell (Cassis flammed), with the * Long, ‘ Expedition from Pittsburgh to the Rocky Mountains, 1S23, as quoted in ‘ Flint Chips,’ by Edward T.

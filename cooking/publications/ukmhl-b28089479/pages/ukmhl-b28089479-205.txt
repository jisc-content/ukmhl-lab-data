189 LITTORINIDiE. RERIWIHKLE. amount was 3394 bags, each containing about 3 bushels, and weighing 3i cwt., so that the periwinkles exported in that year exceeded 10,000 bushels, and weighed nearly 600 tons. There are extensive pei’iwinkle grounds at the mouth of Pagham Harbour, which are visited every low tide by women and children, who gather large quantities, and send them to Brighton and Worthing, and they are sold at 8d. per gallon. The Mersey flats supply good periwinkles. In the Orkneys, at Stromness, I am told that they are collected in sacks, and sent south to the different markets. Professor Simmonds states that the annual consumption of periwinkles in London, in 1858, was estimated at 76,000 baskets, weighing 1900 tons, and valued at £15,000; further, that the inhabitants of Kerara, near Oban, gather them, and get sixpence a bushel for collecting them, and forward them from Oban to Glasgow, thence to Liverpool, en route for London. About thirty tons are sent up to London from Glasgow. Mr. A. Morton tells me that in Jersey the market is supplied with periwinkles brought from Southampton, those found in the island being very small; and occasionally a few pints of the Trochus appear in the market, and are sold as winkles. Trochus zizyphinus, and Trochus cinercirius, are said by M. le Doc- teur Ozenne to be eaten at Toulon, and on the coast of La Manche, aud from experience I can recommend the common Trochus crassas, simply boiled and eaten as periwinkles, the flavour resembling the latter, and being quite as sweet and palatable. In Spain the name for the latter is Caricoles franciscanos, and Minch as. Both Trochidce and Aporrhais pes-pelecani are sold

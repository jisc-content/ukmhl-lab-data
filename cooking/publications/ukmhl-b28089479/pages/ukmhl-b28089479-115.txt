The inspector having sent in his report to the effect that there are sufficient pearl-oysters of mature age on the banks, the government advertises a date for its com- mencement. A large number of boat-owners, both Cingalese and from the opposite coast of India, apply to enrol their boats, and these probably number 150 to 180; they are divided into two fleets, sailing under red and blue flags. They proceed to the banks, which are some six miles from shore, on alternate days. Each boat provides its own crew and divers, and has on board a guard whose duty it is to see that the oysters fished are not surreptitiously disposed of. Each diver stands on a flat stone attached to the diviug- rope, and, after taking a long inspiration, closes the nostrils with one hand, and descends on the stone to the bottom, where he hastily collects as many oysters in his basket as the time he is able to remain under water admits of At a given signal all the boats sail for the shore, where they are unloaded under inspection, and the oysters placed in the government Tcottoos (palisaded enclosures with cement floors). Here the oysters are counted, and the proportion due to the boat-owners for their services, is made over to them. The remainder, which is the property of government, is put up to auction and sold to the highest bidder.

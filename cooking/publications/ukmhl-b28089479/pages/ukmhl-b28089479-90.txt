A species of freshwater mussel, Anodonla ci/gnea, is said to be eaten in the county of Leitrim by the peasantry, and Unionidce ai’e eaten in the south of Europe, either roasted in their shells and drenched with oil, or covered with bread-crumbs, and scalloped; and, according to Dr. Wilhelm Gottlob Rosenhaner, Unio Requtenii, and TJnio litoralis, which are found near Granada, in the river Jenil, are often brought to the market; but when the fish are taken out of their shells and cooked, they are described as very tough food. Anodontce and TJnionid^ce (Anodontes et Mulettes), are employed by the fishermen in the neighbourhood of Nantes for bait;* and I have occasionally used Dreis- sena polymorpha, for the same purpose, which seemed to be greatly appreciated by the fish in the pond where 1 was fishing, as they greedily sucked off the bait as fast as it was put on the hook. The Dreissence were brought from the canal at Sawley, Leicestershire, and turned into the ponds, where they have thriven wonderfully, and are the favourite food of water-rats, if one may judge from the number of empty shells deposited on the banks, amongst the rushes, in small heaps sometimes two or three inches deep. In some countries the shells of the large Anodontce are used for skimming milk. In China, in the province of Nanking, Anodonta edulis (Heude) is said by M. R. P.

SEPIADiE. CUTTLE. 263 I the sides of the boats, attract the Squids.” They were a species of Ommastrephes, usually called by the fisher- men the Flying-squids, or Sea-arrows, as they swim very rapidly over the surface of the water, in immense shoals. They were taken by “ jigging.” The “jig ” is of iron, and consists of a long shank, surmounted by a circlet of small recurved hooks. These cuttles are favourite articles of food, both with Japanese and Chinese, and are carefully dried for the market, and sold in great quantities. Near Hakodadi there is, we are told by Mr. Adams, a small fishing village exclusively devoted to the catching and curing of the Squid; and many hundreds of thousands may be seen daily drying in the open air, all nicely cleaned; each kept flat by means of little bamboo stretchers, and suspended in regular rows on lines, which are raised on poles about six feet from the ground. The open spaces, and all the houses in the village, are filled with these squid-laden lines. Squids everywhere form a novel kind of screen. Pliny speaks of the Springing loligo, and Trebius Niger remarks that whenever it is seen darting above the surface of the water, it portends a change; and also that they sometimes dart above the surface in such vast numbers, as to sink the ships upon which they fall.* Another of the Teuthidce, which is rare on our coast, but is common in the Mediterranean, Sepiola Rondeletii, is eaten at Nice, and is called Supieta, or Sepiata, and is said to be a very delicate morsel. The Italians call it Galamaretto, Zottolina, Sepolina, and Seppietta; and quantities are consumed at Genoa and Leghorn, and it is also used as food in Sicily and Sardinia. Aristotle speaks of the Teuthis, which he says is a * Pliny, ‘ Nat. Hist.’ vol. vi. bk. xxxii. c. 6.

MYTII.IDA5. MUSSEL. 83 garlic, all chopped very fine. Put it on tlie fire; moisten it with a glass of white wine, a spoonful of broth, and half the quantity of liquor from the mussels. Boil this sauce, and when it is nearly reduced to half, add the mussels, with a spoonful of gravy; let the whole boil a few minutes; then add a spoonful of lemon-juice, pepper, and grated nutmeg, then serve.* FrancatellVs Recipe for Scalloped Mussels.—Scald and beard some dozen mussels ; strain the liquor into a stew-pan, and add thereto two ounces of butter, mixed or kneaded with two ounces of flour; a little cream, anchovy, nutmeg, and cayenne ; stir the sauce over the fire to boil and reduce for ten minutes, then add a coupleof yolksof eggs,a little lemon-juice, somechopped parsley, and add the mussels. Stir all together over the fire for a few minutes, and fill some scallop-shells with this preparation; cover them over with a thick coating of fried bread-crumbs, place them on a baking- sheet in the oven for a few minutes, and serve them quite hot. They may also be served upon neatly- shaped pieces of dry toast. A Ragout of Mussels.—When the mussels are well cleaned, stew them without water till they open, take them from the shells, save the liquor; put into a stew- pan a piece of butter, with a few chopped mushrooms, a little parsley, and a little grated lemon-peel; stir this ; put in some good gravy, with pepper and salt; thicken this with a little flour ; boil it up, put in the mussels with some liquor, and serve hot.f * ‘ Dictionnaire General de la Cuisine Franyaise, Ancienne et Mo- derne.’ + ‘ The bady’s Assistant.’ G 2

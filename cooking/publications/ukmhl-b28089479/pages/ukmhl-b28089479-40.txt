EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. 24 in Spain (where it is known by the following names, Arolas, Orolas, and Navallon), viz., Lutraria elliptica, very unlike the Mactridce in appearance, and not tempting to look at. It is a broad flattish shell, about live inches long, and three in height, with a long tube, something resembling My a arenaria. It lives in muddy estuaries, and at the mouths of rivers, buried to the depth of one and a half to two feet; and I have had some fine specimens from the mouth of the Towy, in Carmarthenshire. Mr. Dennis * says the Lutraria are called Clumps at Herm, and I am told by Mr. Morton, that the fisher- men in Jersey know them by the name of Horse-shoes. In Devonshire they are called Glams. In cooking them, they are first boiled, then taken out of their shells and fried. Lutraria oblonga, which is a common species in some of the little muddy estuaries near Croisic and Piriac, on the coast of the Loire Inferieure, is said by M. Cailliaud to be very generally eaten, but it is a rare species with us, though it has been taken on the Devon, Cornwall, and Dorset coasts. At Mahon the name for it is Guitzu j Quiquirigalias, and Cabras at Santander, and Ropamaceiras at Yigo.f Mr. J. K. Lord states that in British Columbia and Vancouver's Island the large Lutraria Maxima, called the great clam, or otter-sliell, is one of the staple articles of winter food on which the Indian tribes who inhabit the North-West Coast of America in a great measure depend.

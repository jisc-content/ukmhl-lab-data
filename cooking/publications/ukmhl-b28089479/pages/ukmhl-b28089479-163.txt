147 OSTREADiE. OYSTER. have already mentioned that artificial oyster cultivation is carried on in China, and has been for many genera- tions. The principal oyster-beds are situated near the mainland, opposite the north and east of Namoa Island. Pieces of rock or stones are laid out on the beds, old oysters are placed on them, and here the spat is deposited. After three years, the oysters are brought to market. As regards quality, they are inferior to those of Amoy and Foochow, which are exported on a large scale to the ports along the coasts.* M. Dabry de Thersant says that there are some prolific beds in the neighbourhood of Macao, which, after deducting the working expenses, about £600, return an annual profit of more than £2000. A staff of eight men are employed on these beds, at about £1 per month each. Another bed which is leased for an annual sum of £10, for thirty years, returns a profit of from £1100 to £1200 per annum.f The best oysters are those collected in January, February, and March. There are several species of oysters in China. The Bamboo Oysters are grown in the following manner. Old oyster-shells of two kinds are selected, thick and thin, each of the thick ones having * a hole one and a half inches in diameter bored through the centre of it. Slips of bamboo about two feet in length, one and a half inches wide, and half an inch thick, are pointed and split to about half the distance down, a thin shell is inserted in each split near its bottom end, the two top ends of each split are pressed together and thrust into the perforated shell, which * ‘China: Imperial Maritime Customs.’ Special Catalogue, Inter- national Fisheries Exhibition, London, 1833. t ‘ Jb light of the Lapwing.’ L 2

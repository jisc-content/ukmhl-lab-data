EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. 43 Here cockled means either shelled or whorled. The Greek ko^Xo?, means a snail, or a shell with a spiral whorl (hence the name of “goggle ” for the Buccinum); but it is also used sometimes for a bivalve shell or “ cockle.” Ko-^Xulpcov is a spoon. Camden, in his ‘ Britannia ’ (p. 962), in speaking of Ireland, and of the commodities of the British Ocean, says, “There are cockles, also in great numbers, with which they dye a scarlet colour so strong and fair, that neither the heat of the sun nor the violence of the rain will change it, and the older it is, the better it looks.” Of course, the purple-fish (Purpura lapillus) is here meant. Locke also speaks of the “oyster or cockle.” The Latin cochlea is properly a snail; but cochlear (.cochleare, or cochlearium), “a spoon,” or “spoonful,” seems to be derived from the form of a bivalve shell, rather than of a snail; it was also a measure for liquids, and in medicine it still signifies a spoonful, hence the Italian cucchiajo, French cuiller. Cochle- arium was also used by the Romans for any small shell, as in mediaeval times. Some authors, indeed, say the spoon was called cochlear, not from its shape, but from the pointed end or handle being used for taking the snails (cochleae) out of their shells and eating them, and the broader part for eating eggs, &c. This may be doubted, but a spoon could scarcely resemble a snail-shell, and Martial says (xiv. 121), “ Sum cochleis habilis, nec sum minus utilis ovis.” At the meeting of the Ethnological Society, March 4th, 1862, Mr. G. W. Earl gave an interesting descrip- tion of the singular Malayan shell-mounds, which were formed entirely of cockle-shells. He described them as

231 HELICDME.—SNAIL. We read that formerly, in Paris, snails were only to be found in the herbalists’ shops, and at the chemists’; but now there are special places for them in the fish markets, by the side of the crayfish and other fresh- water fishes; and in nearly all the restaurants you may see dishes of Helix pomatia displayed in the windows. They are ready cooked, and only require warming for a few minutes on the gridiron. It is from Troyes, at the price of five francs the hundred, that the vine snail is sent to Paris, boiled in their shells, and seasoned with fresh butter mixed with parsley, and a very little gailic. When you wish to partake of them, you place them before the fire till the butter melts, and then they are fit to eat. I purchased some, and succeeded in eating two, but with difficulty, as the way they were dressed did not disguise the slimy, soapy taste, and the want of salt and peppei’, etc., made them most un- palatable. I felt that I could sympathize with Dr. Black and Dr Hutton, who also endeavoured to eat a dish of stewed snails ; but, after vainly attempting to swallow in very small quantities the mess which each internally loathed, “ Dr. Black at length ‘ showed the white feather but in a very delicate manner, as if to sound the opinion of his messmate, ‘ Doctor,’ he said, in his precise and quiet manner, ‘ Doctor, do you not think that they taste a little—a very little—green ?’ * Green ! green, indeed ! Take them awa’ ! take them awa’! ’ vociferated Dr. Hutton, starting from the table and giving full vent to his feelings of abhorrence.” * In Paris, snails are not considered in season till the first frost, about the end of October, or beginning of * * Curiosities of Food/ p. 348.

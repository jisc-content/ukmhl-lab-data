8 EDIBLE BRITISH J10LLUSCA. * ‘British Conchology,’ vol. iii- p. 65. Fam. MYADAE. MYA.—GAPER. Mya Truncata, Linnaeus. Gaper or Truncated Mya. —Shell equal-valved, suboval, gaping much at the small end, truncated and swollen at the other, covered with a pale greenish epidermis, which also continues over its long broad tube and mantles; valves wrinkled transversely ; beaks depressed; umbones prominent, but unequal; a large spoon-shaped tooth in left valve, with a socket or hollow in the other; ligament internal.

At Belfast this shell is called “ Cockle brillion,” * evidently the same name as that applied in Brittany to the winkle, viz. vrelin or brelin. They live buried in the sand or mud, in' an upright position, at the mouths of rivers and estu- aries near low-water mark, and at low tide their locality is known by the holes in the surface. It re- quires much labour and patient digging, sometimes to the depth of more than a foot, to procure a dish of these esculents, therefore they are not so common an article of food as others which are more easily gathered. In Orkney, Mya truncata is called Kunyu, and is not only eaten, but is used as bait for cod-fishing. The Zetlanders call it Sinurslin, the Feroese, Smirslingur. They eat it boiled. In German it is the Klaffinusrhel. On some parts of the Devonshire coast it is known as

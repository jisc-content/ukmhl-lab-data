In France, in the neighbourhood of Dieppe, a great many women and children, each provided with an iron pick, are employed in collecting them either for sale in the market or for bait* * * § I find from Mr. Morton, of St. Clement's, Jersey, who kindly sent me much information respecting the shell-fishes used as food in the Channel Islands, that in Jersey the Pholas is plentiful, and is sold in the market boiled ready for eating. In Spain it is con- sidered as next best to oysters, and is sometimes eaten raw. All the Pliolades are edible, and a large West Indian species, Pholas costata, is much prized, and is regularly sold in the markets of Havana, as we are informed by Forbes and Hanley. Athenaeus recommends these shellfish, as they are very nu- tritious, but he adds that they have a disagreeable smell.f The Normandy method of cooking the Pholas (le dad commun) is to dress them with herbs and breadcrumbs, or pickle them with vinegar. J Large quantities of this fish are sold in the markets of La Rochelle, and Captain Bedford says that the Pholas crispata is eaten by the poor of Oban.§ * ‘ British Concbology,’ vol. iii. p. 102. f ‘ Deipnosophists,’ vol. i. bk. iii. c. 35, p. 146. % ‘ Cottage Gardener,’ vol. i. p. 382.

TELLINIDiE. PSAMMOBIA. 21 dish after having been boiled, that it requires a con- siderable quantity to satisfy the appetites of three or four persons. Sometimes the fish is pounded and made into a puree to mix with the soup; but it makes it more substantial and heavier of digestion. Spanish Method of making Fish Sauce.—Scald the fish in boiling water, sufficiently to make the shells open; but do not let them be heated more than neces- sary. Clean them nicely, and then mix them with a white sauce. To give a pleasant flavour, add a little lemon-juice or vinegar. Spanish way of Cooking all kinds of Shellfish.— Chop up a good quantity of garlic, onions, parsley, and red peppers (which last must be prepared by throwing them into boiling water, and rubbing off the skins with a dry cloth); scald the fish, and pick them out of their shells, then put all together in an olla (or round earthen pot), with plenty of oil; fry them till a deep yellow. They may either be served thus, or when finished add some broth, boil it up, and serve it like a thick soup. The genuine Cadiz lovers of shellfish, however, consider that scalding the fish spoils it; they there- fore prefer the raw fish being put at once into the oil and vegetables, and the dish is then sent to table with the shells in it. “ Psammobia vespertina ” has the following names in Spain, Nauallinas and Guitzu- petit.

It was composed of eight strings of “ wampum/5 formed of white and black beads, worked upon leather thongs, and the whole made into a belt, twenty-eight inches in length by five and a half inches in breadth. The ground is of white beads, and the pattern consists of three diagonal stripes of black beads, and, in the centre, Penn is represented taking the hand of the Indian Sachem, the former being the larger figure of the two.* The native money of New Britain consists of small cowrie-shells strung on strips of cane—called in Duke of York Island, Dewarra—measured in lengths. The first length being from hand to hand across the chest, with the arms extended; the second length from centre of breast to the hand, one arm extended; the third from the shoulder to the tip of the fingers along the arm; fourth, from the elbow to the tip of the fingers > fifth, from the wrist to the tip of the fingers ; and sixth, finger lengths. Fish are generally bought by their length in Dewarra, unless they are too small. A large pig will cost from thirty to forty lengths of the first measure, and a small one, ten.

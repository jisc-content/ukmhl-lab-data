PECTINIDjE. SCALLOP. 123 Vanneau, or Olivette ;* and in the south of Ireland the peasantry call them Closlieens. The Spanish names for Pecten opercularis are Volandeiras, Xels, or Xelets. Pec-ten varius is sent in quantities from the depart- ment of Charente Inferieure to the markets at Bordeaux, and is there called la Petite palourde,f and in the north of France Petite vanne ; and, according to Poli, it is the Pellerinella of the Neapolitans, and the Canestrelli cli mare of the Venetians. In Spain it has many names, viz., Zamorinas, Zamburinas, Andorrinas, Golondrinas, and Romera, and is used as food, and I have seen quantities in the market at Palma, Majorca. To fry Scallops.—Wash the shells well in clean water, then put them into a saucepan over a slow fire until they are open ; then take out the fish, take off the beards, and place them on a dish, covering them well with bread-crumbs or flour, and add a little pepper. Then put some oil, lard, or butter into a fry- ing-pan, and when it begins to boil, put in the scallops, and fry them till they are well browned. Shake the frying-pan occasionally, to prevent their mixing to- gether. Soyer, in his ‘ Menagere/ gives the following recipe : “ Escallop is exceedingly fine; it should be kept in salt and water some time, to free it from sand. When opened, remove all the beard, aud use only the white, red, and black parts. It may be cooked like oysters, and is excellent with matelote sauce.” In Francatelli’s ‘ Cook’s Guide/ is a recipe for oyster soup; but he adds that a good soup may be made in * ‘ British Conchology,’ vol. ii. p. 60. + ‘ Faune Conchyliologique Marine,’ par le Docteur Paul Fischer.

EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. 182 known of a skip arriving at London from Panama, bringing more than two millions of pearl-shells for the English markets. During the last few years pearl-shells have risen in price, and in 1883, the value had increased from £160 to £240 and £250 per ton.* The wholesale price in the Channel Islands for shells of the first quality is £10 per ton, and by retail they are sold at 1 d. per lb. Mother-of-pearl, however, is not only made from the Haliotidce, but the snail pearl-shell Turbo cornutus, the white pearl-shell, Meleagrina rnargaritifera, are also used in this manufacture. Mr. John P. Turner, in his account of the 'Bir- mingham Button Trade,’ says, “ That no elaborate machinery is employed in the production of pearl but- tons.” Hitherto skilled hand labour, assisted by nothing but the foot-lathe, was alone employed. The mother-of-pearl which is cut into buttons, is of various kinds. The white-edged Macassar shells (Meleagrina rnargaritifera), fished almost entirely from the seas round Macassar, in the East Indies, are the finest in size and quality. The yellow-edged Manilla shells are more brittle in turning, and are used chiefly for knife- handles in the Sheffield trade. The Bombay and Alex- andria shells are smaller in size and less delicate in tint and clearness, and are found in the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea; they vary very much in quality and usefulness. The BlacJc shell, one of the Ilaliotidce, is brought from the Archipelago of the Pacific Ocean, and is so called because, when polished, it throws out a very dark shade, full, however, of beautiful rainbow tints * Times, Feb. 13tli, 1883.

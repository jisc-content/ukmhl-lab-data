When a sufficient number of bam- boos have been prepared, they are planted very closely together on the mud flats, much in the same way as a gardener plants cuttings. At the end of about a month, the spat, which had attached itself to them when planted out, has developed into small oysters. The bamboos are then taken up and transplanted about six inches apart. In four or five months the bamboos are almost hid by the oysters which cluster round them, and which are now collected and sold.* The shells of the oyster and murex were used by the Romans as tooth-powder, and oyster-shells are now used as manure. The Chinese use the shells, when ground down, in certain skin diseases; and the valves of Ostrea talienwanensits, and of other species of oysters, are calcined «ntil quite white, pulverized, and then mixed with the juice of certain plants, as a dressing for ulcers.f In the crab traps in China, which are made of bamboo in the shape of a truncated cone, the bait is placed in the middle of the basket, and an oyster is generally used for that purpose.

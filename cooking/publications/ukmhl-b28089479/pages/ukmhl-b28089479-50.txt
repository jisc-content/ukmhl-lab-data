34 EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. becoming an object of interest to the shellfish growers in this country, viz., Venus mercenaria. The experi- ment to acclimatize it on the French coast has already been tried by M. de Broca, M. Coste, and the Co^nt de Ferussac. Breeding-beds were prepared on the coast at Arcachon and Saint-Vaast-la-Hogue, and in 1861 the steward of the ‘ Arago’ steamer brought over about 200 hai'd clams, and also some American oysters, which were deposited in these beds under the super- intendence of M. Coste.* In 1863 another supply of live clams was brought over, but Dr. Paul Fischer stated, in 1865, that though the mollusks seemed per- fectly healthy, they did not appear to have spawned, as no young specimens could be found. Mr. F. G. Moore, Curator of the Liverpool Museum, describes (in a paper given to Professor Brown Goode, and quoted at one of the Conferences held at the Inter- national Fisheries Exhibition,) the successful introduc- tion of the hard clam, or quahog, into the waters of St. George’s Channel. Venus mercenaria is very largely consumed in America. The New York supply comes chiefly from Long Island. The prices for them are as follows: 20 cents per dozen, aud 75 cents to 1 dollar per 100. Like oysters, they bear long journeys well, and can be preserved alive for some time by being kept wet and cool. The shell is very thick, covered with a drab- coloured epidermis, and much resembles, in form, our Cyprina island:ca, but it is more triangular. Inside, the valves at one end are of a rich purple colour, the portion used for making the'Wampum, as we shall read further on. * • Utilizutbn of Minute Life,’ by Dr. T. L. Pliipson.

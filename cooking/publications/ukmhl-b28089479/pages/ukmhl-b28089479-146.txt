EDIBLE BItITISH MOLLUSCA. 130 iu ‘Macmillan’s Magazine/ No. 30, October, 1862:— “ The brood is carefully laid down in the oyster-beds off Wkitstable, and allowed to grow for three, perhaps four years. The oysters in different stages are marked off by means of long poles, so that the shell-fish farm is divided into separate fields, each being in a particular stage of growth. At the time when the oysters are lifted for the London or other markets, they are mea- sured by being thrown against a wire grating, and all those under a certain size are thrown asrain into the water. To give an idea of the business done in the oyster trade, it may be stated that in 1860 the Whit- stable men took as much as £50,000, for native oysters alone, which, after deducting the cost of the brood, would still leave a handsome profit.” There are exten- sive fisheries opposite Milton, those of the Cheney Rock. We are told that in a single season, more than 50,000 bushels of “ natives ” were sent from this one fishery to London.* Mr. Frank Buckland defined a “ native ” as being a thoroughbred oyster, and its geographical limits would be at and about the mouth of the Thames, from Harwich on the north, down to Margate on the south, and it is indigenous to the soil, in contradistinc- tion to the Irish, Milford, and other oysters, which come from different parts of the world.f The “ Milton natives ” bear the bell, or may be Said to be the pearls among British oysters. King John granted these fisheries to the Abbot of Favershain, in whose hands they remained tdl the dissolution, and they have beeu dredged from the earliest times by a * Murray’s 1 Handbook, Kent and Sussex,’ p. 64. •f ‘ Report on Oyster Jb’isli ries,’ 1S76.

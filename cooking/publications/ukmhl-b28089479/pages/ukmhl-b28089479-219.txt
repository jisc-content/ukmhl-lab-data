The proper proportions for dyeing fifty pounds of wool were 200 pounds of juice of the Buccinum, and 111 pounds oi pelagium,* and this mixture produced a beautiful amethyst colour. The Tyrian hue was given to wool by soaking it in the juice of the Pelagia, while the mixture was in a raw state, and afterwards dipping it in the juice ot the Buccinum. The best quality was of the colour of blood, of a blackish hue to the sight, but of a shining appearance when held up to the light.f The “ conchyliated ” colour comprehended a variety of shades, viz., that of the heliotropium, as well as one of a deeper colour; that of the mallow in- clining to a full purple, and that of the late violet; this last being the most vivid of all the “ conchyliated ” tints. J The best purple in Asia was that of Tyre, and the peculiar symbol of that city was the whelk, or purpura, and it appears on the Tyrian medals.§ Strabo remarks that this city was rendered unpleasant as a place of residence, owing to the great number of its dyeing- works. In the days of Ezekiel, purple was imported by the Tyrians from the Peloponnesus, but they soon learned to extract the dye for themselves. A modern traveller, Mr. Wilde, observed at Tyre numerous round holes • Pelagia was the shellfish, and pelagium, the juice, or colour, from it. t Pliny, ‘Nat. Hist.’ vol. ii. bk. ix. chap. 62 (38).

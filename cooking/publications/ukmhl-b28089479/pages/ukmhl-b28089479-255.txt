239 HELICIDiE. SNAIL. The ancients seem to have studied the habits of these mollusks, as besides Theophrastus, whom I have already quoted, Aristotle also mentions them; and Teucer speaks of the snail as “ an animal destitute of feet and spine and bone, whose back is clad with horny shell, with long projecting and retreating eyes/'’* and many others.

EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSOA. 216 This water is good against all obstructions whatso- ever. It cureth a consumption and dropsie. It may be distilled with milk for weak people and children, with hart’s-tongue and elecampane.* “ An excellent Snail-water.—Take of comfrey and succory-roots, of each four ounces, liquorice, three ounces, the leaves of hart’s-tongue, plantain, ground- ivy, red-nettle, yarrow, brooklime, watercresses, dande- lion, and agrimony, of each two large handfuls ; gather these herbs in dry weather, and do not wash them, but wipe them clean with a cloth. Then take five hundred snails, cleansed from their shells, but not scoured, and of whites of eggs beaten up to a water, a pint, four nutmegs grossly beaten, the yellow rind of one lemon and one orange. Bruise all the roots and herbs and put them together, with the other ingredients, in a gallon of new milk, and a pint of Canary; let them stand close covered, forty-eight hours, and then distill them in a common still, with a gentle fire. This quan- tity will fill a still twice. It will keep good a year, and is best when made spring or fall; but it is best when new. You must not cork up the bottles for three months, but cover them with paper. It is immediately fit for use; take a quarter of a pint of this water, and put to it as much milk warm from the cow, and drink it in the morning-, and at four o’clock in the afternoon, and fast two hours after. To take powder of crab’s eyes with it, as much as will lie on a sixpence, mightily assists to sweeten the blood. When you drink this water, be very regular in your diet, and eat nothing salt nor sour/’f “ Mock Asses Milk.—One pound of snails layed in f ‘ A Queen’s Delight,’ Ac., 1658. * ‘ The Complete Cook.’

PHOI-ADIDjE.â€”PIDDOCK. 3 more than an inch deep. Its shell being about two inches long, this arrangement left about an inch and three-quarters exposed. After a short time the animal attached its foot to the bottom of the hole, and com- menced swaying itself from side to side, until the hole was sufficiently deep to allow it to proceed in the following manner. It inflated itself with water appa- rently to its fullest extent, raising its shell upwards from the hole; then, holding by its muscular foot, it drew its shell gradually downwards. This would have produced a perpendicular and very inefficient action, but for a wise provision of nature. The edges of the valves are not joined close together, but are connected by a membrane; and, instead of being joined at the hinge, like ordinary bivalves, they possess an extra plate attached to each valve of the shell, which is necessary for the following part of the operation. In the action of boring, this mollusk, having expanded itself with water, draws down its shell within the hole, gradually closing the lower anterior edges, until they almost touch. It then raises its shell upwards, gradu- ally opening the lower anterior edges and closing the upper, thus boring both upwards and downwards. The spines (points) on the shells are placed in rows, like the teeth of a saw; those toward the lower part being sharp and pointed, whilst those above, being useless, are not renewed. So far for the operation of boring; but how to account for the holes fitting the shape of the animal inhabiting them ? To this I fear- lessly answer, that this is only the case when the Pholas is found in the rock which it entered when small. This mollusk evidently bores merely to protect its fragile shell, and not from any love of boring; and B 2 i

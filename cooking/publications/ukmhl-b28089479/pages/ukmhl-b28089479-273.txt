SEPIAM. CUTTLE. 257 i end of it a number of beautiful pieces of the cowrie, or tiger-shell, are fastened one over another, like the scales of a fish, until it is nearly the size of a turkey's egg, and resembles the cowrie. It is suspended in a hori- zontal position by a strong line, and lowered by the fisherman from a small canoe, till it nearly reaches the bottom. The fisherman jerks the line to cause the shell to move, as if it were alive, and the jerking motion is called tootoofe, the name of the contrivance.

The natives of the South Seas have also another special bait for the Octopus, which appears to differ slightly from the kind already described. It is said to be a rat-shaped bait, round which, when dangled in the water, over the edge of the reef, the Octopus wraps himself so tenaciously as to enable the fisherman to pull him out. ... In the centre of this bait is a piece of quartz, sometimes of an agate species, rubbed into a cone. This is backed by pieces of mottled shell kept in place by cocoa-nut fibre, which passes underneath, and extends past the point of the cone, into the sem- blance of a tail. Mr. Lambert, the authority for the above, further tells us, â€œthat there are one or two characteristic native traditions at Tonga Tabu (Figi Islands), relative to the peculiar hostility of the Octopus tribe to the rat tribe. Formerly they were warm friends, but a rat on a volcanic island, which vy suddenly found to be sinking below the surface of the water, having called on an Octopus to carry him on his s

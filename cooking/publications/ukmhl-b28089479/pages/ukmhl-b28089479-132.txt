Pilgrims kiss it three times, and put their hats upon the head of it, with abundance of respect and devotion. There are thirty silver lamps always burning in the church, and six large silver candlesticks five feet high, which were given by Philip III. There are five platforms of large freestones, for walking all round the church, and above it is another of the same kind, where the pilgrims ascend and fix some remnant of their clothes to a stone cross, which is erected thereon. They likewise per- form another ceremony as singular as this. They pass under this cross three times, through such a small hole that they are obliged to slide through with their breasts against the pavement, so that such as are never so little too fat must suffer severely, and yet through they must go if they will obtain the indulgence thereto affixed. This is the strait gate of the gospel, through which the pilgrims enter into the high-road of salvation. Some who had forgotten to pass under the stone cross have gone back five hundred leagues to perform this cere- mony.* Mr. Street, in his ‘ Gothic Architecture in Spain / states that even in that country, the old belief of the power of the bones of St. James of Compostella to work miracles appear now practically to have died out, and that there are no longer great pilgrimages to his shrine. However, at Santiago de Compostella, he saw one professional pilgrim with his rags covered with scallop shells, whom he had previously seen begging at Zara- goza; and in one of the Plazas at Santiago an old woman was selling scallop shells.

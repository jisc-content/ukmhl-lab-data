EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSC A. 190 in the market at Palma, Majorca, for eating purposes; and in Italy the latter is also eaten, and is known at Venice and at Trieste, by the name of Zamarugola* The Chinese are very partial to sea-snails, and we read in a description given of a Chinese dinner, that the second course consisted of a ragout made of them. At Macao, these sea-snails are white, but at Ningpo they are green, viscous, and slippery, and by no means easy to pick up with chop-sticks. Their taste re- sembles the green fat of the turtle. It is curious that the most abundant shell found in the Scotch kjokken- moddings is the periwinkle, and it is also met with in great numbers in the Danish shell-mounds. Periwinkle Soup.—Take a pint and a half or a quart of periwinkles, wash them well, and boil them in a sauce- pan with a handful or two of salt, to enable you to pick out the fish easily. Put a little dripping or butter into a saucepan, with an onion or carrot, some chopped parsley, and a sprig of thyme, and fry until it becomes brown. Add a pint of water to this, and as soon as it boils put in the periwinkles (which have been previously picked out of their shells), with a little pepper and salt, and let the whole boil again for half an hour. To boil Periwinkles.—It is only necessary to put them into a stew-pan with as much water as will prevent the bottom from burning, as the liquor oozing from them will be sufficient for the purpose; when the shells open wide enough to extract the fish, they will be sufficiently done.f Rote.—It is necessary to throw into the stew-pan a handful or two of salt with the periwinkles, otherwise * ‘ British Conchology,’ vol. iv. p. 252. t Murray’s ' Modern Cookery Book.’

MYTILID.33. MUSSEL. 63 Dr. Knapp informed Messrs. Forbes and Hanley that the quantity of mussels consumed in Edinburgh and Leith is about 10 bushels per week, “ say for forty weeks in the year, in all 400 bushels annually. Each bushel of mussels, when shelled and freed from all refuse, will probably contain from 3 to 4 pints of the animals, or about 900 to 1000, according to their size. Taking the latter number, there will be consumed, in Edinburgh and Leith, about 400,000 mussels. This is a mere trifle compared to the enormous number used as bait for all sorts of fish, especially haddocks, cod, ling, halibut, plaice, skate, &c.; and at New haven the total consumption of mussels for bait may be reckoned at 4,320,000 annually. There are nearly as many used at Musselburgh, Fisherrow, &c., and other places on the Frith of Forth, and we may calculate that 30,000,000 or 40,000,000 of mussels are used for bait alone by the fishermen of that district each year/’* We learn from Mr. P. Wilson, late Inspector of Fisheries at Eyemouth, in Scotland, that in one week alone, sixty-one tons of mussels were used for baiting the long lines, by the boats from the fishing stations of Eyemouth, Burnmouth, and Coldingham, the cost of which was about £160, the produce in fish from which was 25,620 stone, worth £2500. f Mussels are considered to be the best bait for salt- water fish, and will keep alive two days, when taken from the shell, and suspended on a hook in sea- water. The mussel has the power of attaching itself by means of its “ byssus,” to rocks and stones; and we read that * Forbes and Hanley, ‘ British Mollusca,’ vol. ii. pp. 174, 175. f ‘ Molluscs, Mussels, "Whelks, Sic.,’ by Charles Ilurding.

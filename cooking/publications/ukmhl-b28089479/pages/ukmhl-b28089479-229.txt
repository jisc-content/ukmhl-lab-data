HELICIDiE. SNAIL. 213 snails in scorbutic affections, and gives the following recipe for a consumption :— “ Snail-water Pectoral.—Take snails beaten to a mash •with their shells, three pounds; crum of white bread, newly baked, twelve ounces; nutmeg, six drams ; ground-ivy, six handfuls; whey, three quarts; distill it in a cold still, without burning. If I would have this water not so absolutely cold, I add brandy half a pint or a pint. This water humects, dilutes, supplies, tempers, nourishes, comforts, and therefore is highly conducive in hectic consumptive emaciations.” In Dr. John Quincy’s ‘ Pharmacopoeia Officinalis, or a complete English Dispensatory,’ are the following :— “ Decoctnm Limacum, or Decoction of Snails.—Take garden snails, cleansed from their shells,number twelve; red cows’ milk, new, two pounds; boil to a pound; and add l’ose-water, an ounce; sugar-candy, half-an-ounce. “ It will be very difficult to boil this so long as to waste one-half, because it will be apt both to run over and burn to the bottom, and therefore mast be stirred all the while; this quantity is ordered to be drank every morning, and is a noble restorative in consump- tions, especially for young people.” “ Decodum Antiphtliisicum, a Decoction against Con- sumptions.—Take ox-eye daisy flowers, dried, a handful; snails, washed clean, numb, three; candied eryngo-root, half an ounce; pearl-barley, two ounces; boil in spring- water from a poundtohalf apound, and then strainforuse. “ This brings a supply of such soft and inoffensive nourishment, as gives no trouble to a weak constitution, and therefore is of service in consumptions, hectic fevers, etc., etc. The patient must drink four ounces of this warm, with an equal quantity of milk, twice a day.”

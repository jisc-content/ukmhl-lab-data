71 MYTILID^E. MUSSEL. the pearl-fishers had pui-sued their searches.* These mussels are found in Lochs Earn, Tay, Rannoch, and Lubnaig, and in the Don, the Leith, and in many of the other Scotch streams; also in some of the Welsh rivers, from whence I have received fine specimens ; in Ireland, near Enniskillen, and in the river Bann, which is noted for its fine pearls. Sir Robert Redding, in a letter dated Dublin, October 13th, 1688,—as quoted by Dr. Boate in his ‘ Natural History of Ireland,’—says “ that there are four rivers in the county of Tyrone abounding with pearl-mussels, all emptying themselves into Lough Foyle, whereon stands the town of Derry. There are also other rivers in the county of Dunnagall, a river near Dundalk, the Shure, running to Waterford . . . . And no doubt there may be many more that I do not know; all these places are at the feet of very great mountains. The manner of pearl-fishing is not extra- ordinary, the poor people, in the warm months, before harvest is ripe, whilst the rivers are low and clear, go into the water, some with their toes, some with wooden tongs, and some by putting a sharpened stick into the opening of the shell, take them up; and although by common estimate not above one shell in a hundred may have a pearl, and of those pearls not above one in a hundred be tolerably clear, yet a vast number of fair merchantable pearls, and too good for the apothe- cary, are offered for sale by those people every summer assize. Some gentlemen of the country make good advantage thereof, and myself, whilst there, saw one pearl bought for 50s., that weighed 36 carats, and valued at £ tU.” * ‘ Naturalist’s Circular,’ No. 17, October, 18G7.

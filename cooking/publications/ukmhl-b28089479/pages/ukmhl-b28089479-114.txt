EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. 1)8 fisheries are those of the Bahrein Islands in the Persian Gulf, Coromandel, Catifa in Arabia (which produced the pearls purchased by Tavernier for £110,000), the Algerine Coast, the Sooloo Islands, and, in the Western world, the Bay of Panama and the Coast of Columbia, which had formerly some very valuable pearl-fisheries, for Seville alone is said to have imported thence up- wards of 697 lbs. in the year 1587. In Western Australia pearl-fishery grounds have been discovered in the Torres Straits. In 1864 the pearl-fishery of Ceylon suffered con- siderably, owing to an irruption of the skate fish, which was said to have killed the pearl-oysters; and the loss of revenue was calculated at £50,060. A correspondent of the ‘ Ceylon Observer/ says, however, that the Ceylon pearl-fishery shows no sign of languishing, and that a new bank had been fished, the oysters from which are of a larger size than those hitherto obtained from this fishery. The total amount received by the government, in 1881, was £75,000 worth less than the largest fishery on record, viz., that of 1814, which gave a return of £105,000; but in the f Journal of the Society of Arts/ Aug. 12th, 1881, as quoted from ‘ Colonies and India/ it is said that the pearl-fishery for that year had been one of the most successful on record. The pearls from the oysters on the banks situated off “ Silavaturai,” on the western coast of the island, have been famous for their purity, shape, and colour, from time immemorial, and in these attributes they far surpass those obtained from the pearl-oysters of the Persian Gulf, although, as a rule, inferior in size to the latter. . . . The pearl-oyster is said to be migratory in its habits, and for one cause or

195 MURICHLE. WHELK. I sound is described as very loud, monotonous, and dismal. We are told that in the island of Tanna, in the New Hebrides, shell trumpets are blown as signals to the disease-makers, or sorcerers, to entreat them to stop plaguing their victims. “ These disease-makers col- lected any nahak, or rubbish, that had belonged to any one, such as the skin of a banana he had eaten, wrapped it in a leaf like a cigar, and burnt it slowly at one end. As it burnt, the owner’s illness increased ; and if it was burnt to the end, he died; therefore, as soon as a man tell ill, feeling sure that some sorcerer was burning his rubbish, shell trumpets, which can be heard for miles, are blown as a signal to the sorcerers to stop, and wait for the presents which should be sent in the morning. When a disease-maker fell ill himself, he too believed that some one was burning his rubbish, and had his shells blown for mercy.’’’ * The large chank-shell, Turbinella rapa, is a chief instrument of the Buddhists, who blow three times a day on this sacred shell, to summon believers to wor- ship; and the same authority states that, according to the most ancient annals of the Cingalese, the chank- shell is sounded in one of the superior heavens of the demigods (similar to the conch-blowing tritons of Grecian Mythology) in honour of Buddha, as often as the latter wanders abroad on the earth.f Sir J. E. Tennent mentions that this chank-shell is exported from Ceylon to India as a wind instrument, and to be sawn into rings for anklets and bracelets ; and also * Turner, ‘ Polynesia,’ as quoted in Taylor’s ‘ History of Mankind,’ p. 128. t ‘ Voyage of the Novara.’ O 2

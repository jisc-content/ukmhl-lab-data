EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLTJSCA. 270 forms presented a most beautiful appearance, studding the bottoms of the grey limestone rock pools.”* At the Museum of the Jardin des Plantes, at Paris, I have seen specimens of this Echinus in a block of sandstone from the Baie de Douarnenez, in Finisterre; also, specimens of Echinus perforans in granite rock from the Bay of Croisic. How these animals bore into such hard substances is still a question; it is supposed by some that they first perforate with their teeth and then soften the rocks by some secreted solvent.t A friend of mine, who examined some of the holes, observed that they are evidently formed by the animal, aud are lined with a smooth yellow substance which it deposits on the stone; that in limestone rocks the deposit is probably obtained from the stone itself by means of a solvent, but that in granite it may be derived from the lime held in solution in the sea- water. Mr. H. N. Moseley mentions that at St. Vincent, Cape de Verde Islands, when the rock pools are exposed by low tides, numbers of sea-urchins (Echino- metra) may be seen burrowing in rounded cavities in the rocks, which they had made both in the calcareous saud-rock and the volcanic conglomerate.! In Brazil, also, a ^species of Echinometra (Echinometra Michelini, Dessor) is found living in holes, not only in the sand- stone, but in the gneiss rocks, and in many places the rock is fairly honeycombed by their nests.§ In Sicily there is a verse which compares the spines * Forbes’s ‘ British Stur-fislies,’ p. 170. f Ibid. p. 154.

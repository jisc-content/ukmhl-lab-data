EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. 176 near Stoney Littleton; at Rodmartin; at Uley; and at Nympsfield, are called Tumps. In speaking of Cromlechs, in the Channel Islands, I do not therefore allude to monuments such as we call Cromlechs; which last, though probably sepulchral, have not yet been found to contain interments. We read that at the Cape of Good Hope, at White Sands, also at Cape Point, and many other places along the coast, there are to be seen a series of shell mounds, containing large Patellidce, Haliotis and other shells. The limpets are of so large a size that they make convenient drinking-cups. All about the mounds are to be found various stone implements used by the people—either Bushmen, or Hottentots.* In Britton’s ‘ History of Dorset,’ mention is made of the finding of a small urn in a barrow in the parish of Lulworth, about two inches high, and one inch in diameter, neatly covered with the shell of a limpet; but it was quite empty. Necklaces of limpets and other shells, strung together on fibre or sinews, are found in early British graves. Beads made from the columella of Strombus gigas are found in sepulchral remains in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Indiana,f and the shells of the Dentalium made into beads have been met with in tumuli in Ohio.J In Egypt, on the mummies of children, necklaces of natural shells, or shells figured in gold, silver, precious stones, &c., are found—chiefly, accord- ing to Passalacqua, met with on those of young girls.§ * ‘ Notes by a Naturalist on the Challenger,’ hy H.

12 6 EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. tells us, they are carried from Tarentum to Naples, in bags, tightly packed with snow, which not only by its coolness preserves them, but also, by preventing them from opening their bivalves, enables them to retain in the shells sufficient moisture to preserve their lives for a long period.* There were other places from whence oysters were procured, and Mucianus speaks with rapture of those found at Cyzicus, a town in Asia Minor,f on the shores of the Sea of Marmora, the ruins now called by the Turks, Bal Kiz. He describes them as larger than those of Lake Lucrinus; fresher than those of the British coasts; sweeter th.au those of Medulte (the dis- trict in the vicinity of Bordeaux, now called Medoc) ; more tasty than those of Ephesus; more plump than those of Lucus; less slimy than those of Coryphas (a town of Mysia, opposite Lesbos) ; more delicate than those of Istria, and whiter than those of Circeii (a town of Latium). Pliny mentions that according to the his- torians of Alexander’s expedition, oysters were found in the Indian Sea a foot in diameter, J and Sir James E. Tennent unexpectedly attested the correctness of this statement, as at Kottiar, near Trincomalee, enor- mous specimens of the edible oysters were brought to the rest-house. One shell measured moi’e than eleven inches in length, by half as many broad.§ The Greeks preferred the oysters of Abydos, and Archestratus, in his e Gastronomy,’ says :— “ JEnus has mussels fine; Abydus too Is famous for its oysters; Parium produces * Poll, ‘Testacea Utriusque Siciliae.’ f Pliuy, * Nat.

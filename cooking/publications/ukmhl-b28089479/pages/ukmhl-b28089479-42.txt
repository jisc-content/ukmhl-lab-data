EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. 26 holes in the rocks, both at Tenby and Eastbourne, but rarely without some depression or distortion of the valves. But the Tapes decussata is more local than the Tapes pullastra. I had never found it in pro- fusion till the spring of 1862, when, on visiting the sands near the mouth of the Exe, I noticed that at low-water mark the ground was covered with speci- mens of it; and also with Scrobicularia piperata, which is called by the Exmouth fishermen the “ mud-hen ■” but this latter is not used for food in this country, as it has a hot biting taste.* It is said to be eaten at Spezia, and may be seen in the markets of Trieste and Venice; and it is used for making soup. It is known by the name of “caparozzolo.”t Tapes decussata is a-larger and more rugged shell than Tapes pullastra, though much resembling it, but it is not so convex, and differs from it in colour, being of a dirty white, with the bands, rays, or markings of a drab colour, sometimes of a purplish-tinge ; while Tapes pullastra is of a more yellowish-white, with zigzag markings of a rufous- brown, sometimes extending all over the shell, and at others only towards the extremities. In the Northern Isles, the pullet or cullyock, is only used for bait. Tapes decussata is called in some parts of England “ purr,” and in Hampshire “butter-fish.” At Stub- bington, near Tichfield, quantities are collected, and sold in the neighbourhood, at 5d. per quart, where they are considered richer and better than cockles. They are found at low tide not far from high-water mark, and their locality is easily detected by two holes * ‘ British Conchology,’ vol. ii. p. 446. f 1 The Fisheries of the Adriatic,’ by G. L.

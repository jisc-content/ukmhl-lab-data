Season with pepper and salt; beat the yolks of the eggs and put them in, stir all the time for fear of curdling, add a little grated nutmeg. When it is thick and fine, fill the rolls, pour your soup into the dish, place in the rolls, and lay the rest of the mussels round the rim of the dish.* Mussels a la Poulette.—Take two quarts of mussels —the smallest are the most delicate; scrape the shells carefully, with a knife, and wash in water, changed several times, till perfectly free from gi’it. Put one quart of the mussels in a saute-pan, with a sliced onion, four ounces, a few sprigs of parsley, say one ounce, two pinches of salt, two small pinches of pepper, one pint of French white wine. Cover the saute-pan ; put it on the fire, and toss the mussels occasionally ; when the shells open the mussels are done, then take them out of the saute-pan, and take off one shell. Put the second quart on the fire, and cook them in the same way. It is advisable to cook only half the quantity at a time, as the mussels would not be done evenly, if too many were put in the pan at once. Be careful not to let them be overdone, as this would shrink and harden them, and impair their quality. Strain the liquor into a basin ; put into a stew-pan one ounce of butter, and one ounce of Hour; stir over the fire for three minutes; mix the liquor, and add enough water to produce a pint of sauce; thicken it with two yolks of eggs and half an ounce of butter, add oue tablespoonful of chopped parsley. Dip the mussels in plenty of hot water; drain them well, and wipe them. * ‘ The Art of Cookery untile Plain and Easy.’

50 EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. shells, often amounting to some tons in weight, were noticed by Dr. Darwin, which had at different periods formed the chief food of the inhabitants.* These remind us of the so-called kjbkkenmbddings (kitchen heaps) of Denmark, or shell-mounds, to which the attention of archaeologists has been recently at- tracted in Northern Europe, and which consist of thousands of shells of the oyster, cockle, and other edible mollusks, with implements of stone, such as flint knives, hatchets, &c., and implements of bone, wood, and horn, with fragments of coarse pottery mixed with charcoal and cinders, f Quite recently, one of these kjokkenmoddings has been discovered at Newhaven, in Sussex, and among the objects found were limpet and other shells, with bones of animals. J In 1863, Sir John Lubbock published, in the ‘ Natural History Review/ an account he had received from the Rev. G. Gordon, of Scotch kjokkenmoddings on the Elginshire coast, resembling those in Denmark. Mr. Gordon says, “By far the most striking, if not the most ancient, of the kjokkenmoddings we have in our vicinity, is that one which lies within a small wood on the old margin of the Loch of Spynie, and on a sort of promontory formed of those raised shingle beaches so well developed in that quarter. This mound, or rather two mounds (for there is an intervening portion of the ground which has no shells), must have been of considerable extent.

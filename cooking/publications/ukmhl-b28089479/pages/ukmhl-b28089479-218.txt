202 EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. as a production of Britain, “ shells from which is pre- pared a scarlet dye of the most beautiful hue, which never fades from the effect of sun or rain.” It is also stated in the ‘ Athenasum ’ of July 20, 1850, that the Nicaraguan Indians use a purple dye prepared from shellfish. Pliny says that there are two kinds of fish that pro- duce the purple dye, the Bucdnum, and the Purpura, purple or pelagia.* Murex trunculus is generally considered to have yielded it, but Murex brandaris was also used, and most certainly at Tyre, as we shall presently read. We all know the story of the discovery of the Por- phyra shellfish, by the dog of a Tyrian nymph loved by Hercules; which having picked up some of these shells, and crushed them with its teeth, its mouth became stained with purple dye. It is scarcely probable that it could crush the strong hard shells of the Bucdnum, or Murex, but it might easily break the beautiful fragile shell of the Helix ianthina, which we know yields a purple juice; for though a fable, the above was intended to relate a possible event; and we are told by Sir Gardner Wilkinson, that the ianthina is common on the coast about Tyre and Beyrout. And though so small, being only the size of a small snail, three-quarters of an inch in diameter, the water becomes completely coloured all around it, whenever it is alarmed, and throws out its purple liquid, f Athenmus speaks of many different kinds of purple- fish, some of them of large size, like those which are found near Segeuin and Lesteum ; and some small, like * Pliny, ‘Nat. Hist.’ vol. ii. bk. ix. chap. 67. f See note, Kawlinson’s ‘ Herodotus,’ vol. ii. bk. iii. chap. 20, p. 415.

109 PECTINIML— SCALLOP. date 1583, to the memory of “George Raw, gent., gQo^g^y^Qe mayor aud customer of Sandwic, and mar- chant adventurer in London /’ with a shield bearing the arms, ermine on a chief (gules), two escallop shells (or); crest, a dexter arm embowered in armour (sable), garnished (or), holding a scallop shell. How- ever, the escallop in heraldry is borne not only as a badge of pilgrimages, but by those who have made long voyages, have gained great victories, or have had important naval commands.* It is curious to remark, that leaden coffins, orna- mented with scallop shells, rings, and beaded pattern, belonging to a much earlier period, have been dug up from time to time on the sites of Roman cemeteries. Mr. C. Roach Smith, in an interesting paper on ‘ Leaden Coffins/ in ‘ Journal of the Archaeological Association/ vol. ii., mentions several. Two were found at Colchester, and near one of them was an urn, in which were two coins, one of Antoninus Pius, and the other of Alexander Severus; again, in Weever's ‘Funeral Monuments/ mention is made of a similar coffin (discovered in the parish of Stepney, Middlesex, in the district known to occupy the site of one of the cemeteries of Roman London), the upper part orna- mented with scallop shells; having at the head and foot two jars ; on the sides a number of bottles of glistening red earth, some of which were painted, and also some glass phials. The chest, or coffin, con- tained the body of a woman. Leaden coffins have been found at York, and in a Roman tomb at Southfleet, Kent, and other places, as well as in France; and * ‘ Crests of Great Britain and Ireland/ vol. i. p. 525, by Fairbairn. l

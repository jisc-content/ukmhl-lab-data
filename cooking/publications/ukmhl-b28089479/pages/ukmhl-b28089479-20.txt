EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. 4 iu this opinion I am borne out by my own specimens. The young Pholas, having found a substance suitable for a habitation, ceases to bore immediately that it has buried its shell below the surface of the rock, &c. It remains quiescent until its increased growth requires a renewal of its labours. It thus continues working deeper and deeper, and, should the substance fail or decay, it has no alternative but to bore through, and seek some fresh spot where it may find a more secure retreat.” At Amroth, near Tenby, is a submerged forest, the trees of which are completely perforated by the Pliolas; and at spring-tides fine specimens may be collected. Montagu remarks that, whilst it is the general habit of shipworms (Teredo navalis, or Teredo norvegica) to bore parallel with the grain, the Pholas perforates the wood across the grain.* Dr. J. G. Jeffreys mentions that Redi, in a letter to his friend Megalotti, describes the Teredo as being not only eatable, but excelling all shellfish, the oyster not excepted, in its exquisite flavour. Nardo also praises it, and wonders why the Venetians, who call it Bisse del legno, do not eat it.f The German name for the Pholas is very appropriate, viz., die Bohrmuschel, Steinbohrer, or pierce-stone; in France it is called le Bail commun, Gite, or Pitau; in Spain, Folado, Almeixa-bravas; in Minorca, Peus de cobra and Datil del mar; and in Sicily, Dattoli di mari. An old fisherman told me that the Pudworm, as he called it, was a very delicate fish; and he had often noticed on the Hampshire coast, that at low spring- tides in the winter, when sharp frosts set in, and when * Forbes and Hanley, ‘ British Mollusca.’ t ‘ British Conchology,’ vol. iii. p. 159.

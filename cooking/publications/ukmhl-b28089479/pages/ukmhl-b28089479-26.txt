EDIBLE BRITISH MOLLUSCA. 10 (of the United States Commission) gave some interest- ing details at one of the Conferences held in connection with the International Fisheries Exhibition, London, 1883, respecting the extent to which Mya arenaria is used in the United States. He says, â€œ In the State of Maine 318,000 bushels, or 1,000,000 lbs. of this mollusk were used for bait and for food. In Massa- chusetts an equal quantity, if not more, and in the Middle States 406,000 bushels, making in all over 1,000,000 bushels, having a value to fishermen of 458,000 dollars. He liad not the statistics for Con- necticut, Rhode Island, and some of the other States where these shellfish were also used in considerable quantities, but including them it might be said that over a million and a quarter bushels, valued at probably not less than 600,000 dollars, were used on the Atlantic sea-board Some fishermen on the coast confined themselves to the quarrying, as it was called, of these shellfish, for they had the habit of burying themselves two or three inches deep in the mud or sand of the shallow bays along the shore. This industry afforded employment to a large number of fishermen at a time when nothing else could be done. Some of the smaller vessels, not considered safe to encounter the winter gales, were taken into the shallow waters, and served as hotels and work-houses for the men engaged in quarrying the clams. These men spent two or three months in gathering a vessel-load, shelling them and salting them, to be sold in the early spring to the vessels engaged in the great ocean cod fisheries; whilst large numbers wei'e also engaged during the entire summer gathering them to be sold in the larger markets for food, where they were prized very highly

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION Iw his present undertaking, the Author’s object has been to pro- duce a treatise which may be useful not only to cooks themselves but also to those who employ them. He has accordingly been as sparing as possible of the use of technical terms, and has endeavoured, at the same time, to be concise as well as explicit in his directions.

But, in the majority of instances, the Author’s instructions wdll be found generally practicable ; common sense, aided by some experi- ence, vnll suggest tlie employment of available substitutes, when costly sauces and other recherche preparations are directed to be used. Simplicity is as essential an element in cookery as it is in other arts: the Author, therefore, particularly cautions the inexperienced

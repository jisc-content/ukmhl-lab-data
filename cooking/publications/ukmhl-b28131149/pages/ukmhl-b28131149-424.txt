CAKES 402 the hatter. As soon as the whites arc satisfactorily whisked,* pro- ceed to mix them also in with the batter: they must be added in small quantities at first, until it has become smoothly diluted; the whole of what remains should then be added, and gently yet thoroughly mixed. The batter thus prepared, must now be gently poured into a mould previously prepared for the purpose in the following manner:— About one poimd of beef or veal suet should be first chopped very fine, then melted do^vn in a stewpan; after it has been strained through a napkin, pour this into the mould, turn it round in all directions, so that the fat may touch aU the angles and recesses; it must then be poured out, and the mould should be turned upside dowTi on a plate, and allowed to stand in a warm place, for a few minutes, that the fat may be entirely drained off. About one pound of the finest sifted sugar should now be immediately put into the mould, and shaken about in it, in order that it may effectually cover the whole of the inside of the mould with a perfectly smooth white surface. Care must be taken to avoid leaving a greater quantity of fat adhering to the sides of the mould than is positively necessary; for if there be too thick a coating of sugar in the mould, the Savoy cake wiU be more difficult to bake of a fight colour; the heat of the oven being liable to partially calcine the sugar, and thus darken its hue. '\^^len the Savoy cake is ready to be baked, tie a broad band of paper (folded in three) round the base, and put a few wood-ashes on the baking-sheet, previously to placing the cake on the latter, before putting it in the oven, which must be of very moderate heat; parti- cular care must be taken to keep it closed as much as possible while the cake is baking, and also not to increase its temperature after- wards : this may be easily avoided, if the oven be substantially built,f by its being properly heated at first, it will then retain for some time an even temperature. It is impossible to determine on the exact length of time that this, or, indeed, any other cake should remain in the oven before it is done; this will mainly depend upon the construction of the oven, and partly on the necessity there may be for occasionally opening it during the process baking the cake. The whites must be whisked slowly at first, increasing the motion of the hand gradually until it reaches the greatest possible speed: the motion of the whisk must be kej)t up at this rate, until the whites are become sufiiciently fii-m, when they must be instantiy mixed in with the batter,—othenvise they are liable, by partial decomposition, to lose their consistency. t Brick ovens are best adapted for baking all kinds of large cakes, pies, &c.: the reason of this is chiefly owing to their being generally constructed of a superior kind of bricks and tiles, requiring, from their compactness, one or two hours to heat them tlioroughly; such an oven is, therefore, capable of retaining its heat a much longer time than one built of iron ; unless, indeed, when the latter happens to be very substantially made, which is too seldom the case. Iron-built ovens are also desirable, as well for their economy c>f fuel as for the short time in which they may be heated ; and, further, on account of the celerity and convenience with which one person may prepare large quan- tities of small pastry, and bake it also. This could not so easily be done with a brick oven by only one person ; as when it happens that a large oven is full of pastry, some one must be" in constant attendance, in order to watch, and regulate the different de^ees of heat or baking which the several ai'ticles require, and determine their stay and position in the oven accordingly. All this needs the most vigilant care and attention, in order to secure success in the baking of delicate pastry; for, however well it may have been pre- pared, if it is not equally well baked, the result will be unsatisfactory.

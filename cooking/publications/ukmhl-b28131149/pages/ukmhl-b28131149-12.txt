PREFACE. VI And now, generous and gentle patrons, 1 once more respect- fully take my leave of you for a while ; and to you, Gentlemen of the Public Press, I beg to return my most sincere thanks for the handsome and kindly manner in which you noticed my earnest efforts to assist my English brethren to outrival their hitherto successful foreign competitors for fame in the Culinary Art. But I should not do justice to my o\vn feelings if I omitted on this occasion to offer my special thanks to the Author of the admirable little work, entitled ‘‘ The Art of Dining, or Gastro- nomy and Gastronomers,” for the very flattering terms in w'hich he has spoken of my professional labours. C. E. FKANCATELLT, Waltox Villas, Bromptox, June \st, 1853.

COLD ENTREES, 378 spread the head out upon a large earthenware dish, and rub it with the foUoAving ingredients :—Six pounds of salt, four ounces of saltpetre, six ounces of moist sugar, cloves, mace, half an oimce of juniper berries, four cloves of garlic, six bay-leaves, a handful of thyme, maijoram, and basil. When the head has been well rubbed with these, pour about a quart of port-wine lees over it, and keep in a cool place for a fort- night ; obseiwing that it must be turned over m its brine every day, during that period. Wlien about to dress the head, take it out of the brine, and wash it thoroughly in cold water; then absorb all the exterior moistiue from it with a clean cloth, and spread it out upon the table. Next, pare off all the uneven pieces from the cheeks, &c., cut these into long narrow fillets, and put them with the tongue, fat bacon, and truffles, prepared as directed for the galantine; then, fine the inside of the head ivith a layer of force-meat (the same kind as used for galantines), about an inch thick, and lay thereon the fillets of tongue, bacon, truffles, and here and there some pistachio kernels (the skin of which must be removed by scalding) ; cover these with a layer of force-meat, and then repeat the rows of tongue, &c., and when the head is suffi- ciently garnished to fill it out in its shape, it shoidd be sewn up with a smaD trussiug-needle and twine, so as thoroughly to secure the stufi- ing. The head must then be wrapped up in a strong cloth, previously weU spread with butter, and sewn up in this, so as to preserve its original form: it should next be put into a large oval braizing-pan, covered with any carcasses of game (especially of grouse, from its con- genial flavour) or any trimmings of meat there may be at hand, and ^so four cow-heels, or six calves’ feet; then moisten with a copious wine mirepoix (No. 236), in sufficient quantity to cover the surface of the head. Set the braizier on the stove-fire; as soon as it bods up, skim it thoroughly, then remove it to a slow fire (covered with the hd con- taining live embers), that the head may continue to simmer or bod very gently, for about five hours; as soon as it appears to be nearly done, remove the braizier from the fire, and when the heat of the broth has somewhat subsided, let the head be taken up on a large dish: if it appears to have shrunk considerably in the -wrapper, this must be carefully tightened, so as to prcsen-e its shape : it shoidd then be put back into its braize, there to remain, until the whole has become set

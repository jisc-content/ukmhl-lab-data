REMOVES OF CHICKENS. 203 684, CHICKENS, A LA DAUPHINE, Draw two spring cliickens, proceed to bone them as for galantines,^' excepting that the legs and wings must be left entire. The void must be then filled with quenelle of fowl, in which has been mixed some chopped mushrooms and parsley; the chickens should afterwards be trussed, taking care to give them the same shape as they would have were the bones not removed; and after rubbing them over with lemon- iuice, cover the breasts with thin layers of fat bacon, and secure theii’ shape by wrapping them in sheets of buttered paper; then place them in a stewpan, with carrot, onion, and a garnished faggot; moisten mth some light mirepoix (No. 236), and set the chickens to simmer very gently by the side of a slow fire for about three-quarters of an hom*; when done, drain them upon a napkin, remove the string, &c., and ^sh them up; sauce them with the clarified essence in which th^ have been braized, and serve. It is also customary to serve chickens, fowls, capons, or poulards, when prepared in this fashion, with ragouts d la Financiere, d la Parisienne, with Macedoines, or Jardinieres of vegetables, Italian, Poivrade, Tomata, or Supreme sauces. 685. CHICKENS, A LA MONTMORENCY. Truss two or more chickens (as may be required), and let their breasts be entirely covered with close larding; next place them in a stewpan containing a wine mirepoix (No. 236), covering the nnlarded p^s with thin layers of fat bacon; add as much good consommi as will suffice to reach up to the larding, cover the chickens with a round of buttered paper, and set them to braize gently on a slow fire—taldng care that the Hd of the stewpan be covered with live embers of char- coal, to effect the glazing of the larding. When the chickens are done, dish them up, garnish them with a white ragout d la Financiere (No. 187), or a ragout d la Parisienne CNo. 203), and serve.

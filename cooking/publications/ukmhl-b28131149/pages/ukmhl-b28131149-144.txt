DRESSED FISH IN GENERAL. 122 boiling will suffice to braize it; the fish must be well basted with its liquor every now and then. When the sturgeon is done, take it up, remove the skin, drain, and aftenvards mask it with some stiff glaze, in which has been mixed some pounded lobster-coral in sufficient quantity to give the sturgeon a bright scarlet colour; form on its centre a palm or star, with some contises fillets of soles. The orna- mental skewers that appear in the woodcut must, if used—which is not strictly essential—all be garnished with a lai’ge truffle, crayfish, mushroom, quenelle, and truffle. Pour some Cardinal sauce (No. 48) round it, garnish with a border of tails of very small lobsters, and alternate groups of small quenelles of whiting, button mush- rooms, and truffles. 433. STURGEON A LA GENOISE. Prepare the sturgeon as in either of the foregoing instances, and after having glazed and dished it up, pour some Genoise sauce (No. 30) round it; garnish with a border of large crayfish, and serve. 434. STURGEON A LA DAUPHINE. Pare off the whole of the skin of a prime cut of sturgeon, weigh- ing about 8 lbs; gaimish the inside to its full extent with some quenelle force-meat of whiting, mixed with some chopped and sim- mered fine herbs; wrap the sturgeon in tliin layers of bacon— secured on with string; set the sturgeon to braize in some wine mirepoix; when done, drain it and put it to cool in the larder, after which cover it well over—first divesting it of the bacon, &c.—with a coating of stiffly-reduced Allemande sauce, and when the sauce has cooled upon the fish, bread-crumb it in the usual manner, drop a little clai’ified butter over it through a straining-spoon, put it on a drainer into a deep baking dish, and set it in the oven to be baked of a light colour. Then place it on a dish, sauce with Sturgeon sauce (No. 56), garnish with an outer row of quenelles of gm'uets.

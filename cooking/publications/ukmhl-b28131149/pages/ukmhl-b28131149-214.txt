Peepaee a AVestphalia ham in every respect according to the first part of the previous directions, and having allowed it to steep in the mirepoix the allotted time, run a large iron skewer through it, and fasten it at each end on to the spit with string; next reduce the mirepoix, vegetables, &c., of which it is composed, and cover the under part of the ham therewith ; then wrap the whole of the ham up with large sheets of cartridge-paper, previously weU oiled for the purpose; over the paper put a covering of venison paste, as is usual when about to prepare venison for roasting. Cover the said coating of flour and water paste, with greased paper, and tie on this with string. About five hours before the ham is required for table, put it dovm to roast before a moderate fire; when it has been down about three hours and a half, take it up, make a hole in the paste, and with a funnel, infuse half a pint of brandy, or in preference to this, if you have it, as much Malaga wine; stop the hole up with paste, and put the ham down to the fire to roast for twenty minutes longer; then take it up, and remove it carefully from the spit, so as not to lose any portion of the essence contained within the coating of crust that surrounds the ham. Trim the ham, and set it to dry on a baking-sheet in the oven, glaze it and dish it up, using the essence reserved for the pur- pose, in order to give flavour to the sauce intended to be served with it. Westphalia hams, thus dressed, may be sensed with any of the garnishes described as appropriate for baked hams. 650.

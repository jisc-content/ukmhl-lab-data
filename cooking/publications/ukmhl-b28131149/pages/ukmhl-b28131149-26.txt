4 SAUCES, 7. ALLEilANDE SAUCE. Reduce the qaantity of white Veloute sauce intended for the Alle- mande, over a brisk stove-fire, adding a little essence of mushrooms or some mushroom trimmings ; when the sauce is sufficiently reduced, take it off the stove, and incorporate with it a leason* of yolks of eggs (in the proportion of four yolks to a pint), a little nutmeg, cream, a pat of butter, and a little lemon-juice; set the leason in the sauce, by stirring it over the fire until it simmers , it must then be quickly stirred to keep the sauce from boiling, as, in that case, the yolks of eggs would be liable to curdle, which would considerably deteriorate from its quality When the leason is set, pass the sauce through a tammy into a basin, or bam-marie, for use. This sauce is in much request, as the foundation of m.any others, especially fish sauces. SPECIAL SAUCES, COJIPIUSINO Financih'e Sauce. Aurora Sauce. Turtle do. Dutch do. Salmis do.

PUFF-PASTE. 391 Place tlie flour on the pastry-slab, spread it out in tlie centre so as to form a well, in which place the salt, a small piece of butter, the yolk of an egg, and about two-thirds of the quantity of water required to mix the paste ; spread out the fingers of the right hand, and mix the ingredients together gradually Avith the tips of the fingers, adding a little more water, if necessary ; when the whole is thoroughly incor- porated together, sprinkle a few drops of water over it, and work the paste to and fro on the slab for two minutes, after which it should be rather soft to the touch, and present a perfectly smooth appearance. The paste, thus far prepared, must now be spread out on the slab wath the hands, and after the butter has been pressed in a cloth, to extract any milk it may contain, it should be placed in the centre of the paste, and partially spread, by pressing on it with the cloth ; the four sides should then be folded over so as entirely to cover the butter; a little flour must next be shaken under and over it, and the paste should be shaped in a square form, measuring about ten inches eacli way, by pressing it out with the hand ; it should then be placed on a clean baking-sheet, laid on some pounded rough ice,* and a deep sautapan also filled with ice should be placed upon it: by these means the paste will be kept cool and firm. About ten minutes after the paste has been made, take it from the ice and place it on a marble slab, shake a little flour over and under it, and then roll it out about two feet long, and ten inches wide; observing that the paste must be kept square at both ends, as much of the success depends on due attention being paid to the turning and folding. The paste should then be laid in three equal folds, and after these have been rolled over to cause them to adhere together, the paste must next be turned round in the opposite direction and rolled out again in the same man- ner as before ; it should then be put back on the ice, and after allow- ing it to rest for about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, roU it out again, or, as it is technically termed, give it two more turns ; the paste must now be put back on the ice, and again rolled tvdee or three times, as the case may require, preparatory to its being cut out for whatever purpose it may be intended. * In the summer season it is impossible to insure success in making puff-paste, unless rough ice be used to further that end, it being a matter of the first necessity tLat it should be kept cool and firm : two requisites that tend materially to facilitate the working of the paste, and also contribute veiy considerably to give to it that extraordinary degree of elas- ticity, when exposed to the heat of an oven, so well known to experienced pastrycooks. A piece of puff-paste a quarter of an inch thick, when baked, will rise to the height of two inchesâ€”thus increasing in volume eight times. To effect this properly, it is neces- sary to procure three oblong tin pans, of the following dimensions: the first should measure 20 inches by 16, depth 3 inches ; the second, 18 inches by 14, depth 2 inches; :md the third, 16 inches by 12, depth 3 inches. Place some pounded rough ice in the largest, then set the second-sized tin on this, with the puff-paste in it; lastly, put the smallest pan, also filled with ice, on the top of the paste: by this method puff-paste may be easily made to perfection during the hottest days of summer. In winter, the use of ice may, of course, be dispensed with. In extreme cold weather, when the butter is very hard, it will be necessary to press it in a cloth or on the slab, to give it more eiqiansion, and thus facilitate its incorporation with the paste. Care must be taken, in mixing the paste, not to make it too stiff, especially in summer, as, in that case, t becomes not onlv troublesome to work but it also affects its elast citv in baking.

151 INFANT’S FOOD. cool before being used, as the food must not be given above the heat mentioned. The occasional use of these foods prepares the way for weaning. Weaning in a child of average health takes place about nine months after birth. During weaning, in addition to plain milk, a fresh egg well beaten may be given in say three portions during the day, with some milk mixed with it. After weaning, a little beef-tea (see page 138, ordinary beef-tea,) may be given—not more than 2 oz. (four tablespoonfuls) a day. No farinaceous foods should be given until after weaning, as there is no saliva to mix with and prepare them for digestion until the teeth come. In the pap and flour mixtures already mentioned the starch is driven out by boiling. As the teeth come, animal and vegetable food may be gradually added in small quantities, but the diet of young children should consist chiefly of milk and eggs, either taken separately or made into puddings with semolina, rice, arrowroot, etc. (see page no). It must be understood that the foregoing remarks are quite general in their nature, and subject to modi- fication for even healthy infants. The patent foods suit some children; a little beef-tea before weaning agrees well with others. Warning.—Mothers cannot be too strongly wanted against giving infants either spirituous liquors or opiates—that is, soothing syrups, etc. Spirituous liquors cause inflammation of the coats of the stomach, and lay the foundation of many diseases in afterlife. Opiates injure the nervous system, make the child nervous and irritable, and hurt digestion. All soothing powders contain opium (even Dalby’s Carminative), and should only be used when ordered by a doctor.

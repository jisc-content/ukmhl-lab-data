SOUPS. 57 carrots, bay leaf and celery seed ; simmer for half an hour. Then add the leek, turnips, and potatoes, and allow the whole to simmer for another hour. If the meat cooks fast, it will fall to pieces and have no taste. Remove the celery seed and the pepper- corns ; arrange the meat on a large dish ; place all the vegetables round the meat; pour a large cupful of the broth into the dish, and serve hot. Remove the fat from the broth, break some dry rusks in a soup tureen, and pour the boiling broth over them. Keep the meat hot while the soup is served. The potatoes can be made more digestible by par boiling them, and adding them later. To keep them from breaking, put them on the top of the meat and other vegetables, and, before dishing the meat, lift them off carefully with a spoon. This is a very economical dish when vegetables are cheap, and, as it must be cooked very slowly, it requires little fuel. In France large earthenware saucepans are used for the pot-au-feu. Stock.—Required: i lb. leg of beef (lean) ; i small carrot; i small turnip; i very small onion; i sprig parsley; i small bay leaf; i clove ; 3 or 4 pepper corns ; 3 pints cold water; teaspoonful salt. Prepare the vegetables (see page 37); cut them into thick slices; cut the meat into small pieces ; put the vegetables and meat into a saucepan with the parsley, bay leaf, prepared onion, salt and cold water. Cover the saucepan and allow the water to come slowly to the boil; skim well; add the pepper and the clove, and simmer very gently for four hours. Lay a clean cloth in a colander; strain the stock through it into a basin. Let it get cold, and remove all the fat. Clear Soup.—Required: 1 pint of stock ; the white and shell of 1 egg.

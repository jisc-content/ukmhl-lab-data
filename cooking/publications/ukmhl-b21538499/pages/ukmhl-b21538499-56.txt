SOUPS. 52 I repare all the vegetables, and shred down into strips one inch long. Melt the dripping, and sweat the vegetables in it, then add the boiling water, pepper and salt, and boil briskly without the lid on the pan till the vegetables are cooked. Allow about 40 minutes for young vegetables, and for old vegetables from i to 1 ]/2 hours. Break the flour with the milk, add it to the soup, and stir till it boils, then cook for 5 to 7 minutes. Note /.—Boiling water is used to preserve the colour, and flavour of the vegetables. The lid is kept off the pan for the same reason. . Note II. A Soup Maigre is prepared in the same way, leav- ing out the flour and milk. Note ///.—Any other vegetables in season may be used instead of those mentioned. The soups may be made richer by putting a well-beaten yolk of egg in the tureen, and gradually stirring the soup in with it. Fish Stock.—Required: 2d. worth of fish trim- mings ; 1 onion ; stick of celery ; 6 white peppercorns ; 1 blade of mace ; salt; 1 quart cold water. Thoroughly cleanse the trimmings and put them into a saucepan with the water and salt. Bring slowly to the boil and skim thoroughly. Add the celery, onion, peppercorns, and mace, and allow all to simmer for 40 minutes, then strain. This stock can be used either for fish soups or sauces. Note /.—If better stock is wished, a haddock or a cod’s head can be used instead of trimmings. Note II.—If fish stock is cooked too long, a very bitter flavour is extracted from the bones. Fish Soup.—Required: 1 quart fish stock ; 1 y2 oz. flour; y2 pint milk; 1 tablespoonful finely chopped parsley. Heat the stock. Break the flour with the milk, and add it to the stock. Stir till it boils, then cook for 10 minutes, adding the chopped parsley at the last.

They are essential to the health of the body About two-thirds of the human body consist of water. In a full-grown person about five pints pass off daily in various ways. It is, therefore, evident that if one object of food is to replace the waste of the body, must be supplied to replace what goes out, and must therefore form an important part of food. Liquid foods (milk, soups, and drinks) consist largely of water. It is not, however, necessary to replace the waste entirely by drinking liquid, as a large proportion of all apparently solid food is in reality water. Fruit and vegetables contain a great deal of water, and there is much even in animal food. Water does not directly nourish the body either by forming flesh or giving heat. Its chief uses are—a, to mix with and soften solid food, and thus help the various stages of digestion; b, to assist in carrying the food to the various parts of the body, where it is required to re- place what has been wasted ; c, to mix with and help to carry off matter which has been used up.1 It is 1 The blood contained in the arteries conveys the digested food to the various parts of the body, and that contained in the veins removes the used-up matter. More than three-fourths of the blood consists of water. IV. Water

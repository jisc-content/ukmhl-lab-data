Grease a double piece of kitchen paper, and twist it over the top of the basin or mould, and steam slowly for half an hour, adding boiling water if the water boils away. If a basin is used, steam for three quarters of an hour. Bread Pudding.—Required: 2 oz. stale bread- crumbs ; 1 egg; y2 pint milk; 1 pinch of nutmeg or cinnamon; ]/2 oz. sugar.

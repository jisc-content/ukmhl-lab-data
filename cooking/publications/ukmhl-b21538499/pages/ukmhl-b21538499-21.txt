17 THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKERY. is cooked at boiling point this substance turns into a tough skin ; and if fish and meat are cooked too long at boiling point the juice hardens and the fibre becomes tough rags. Meat is not only unpalatable when thus hardened, but is less digestible. Meat to be made into soup must be differently treated from meat to be served as a joint. To make soup, we must draw the juices out of the meat, and for this purpose the meat must be cut into small pieces, put on with cold water and salt to draw out the juices, slowly warmed, then simmered—not boiled. If, however, the meat is to be cooked for eating, we must on the contrary keep in the juices. This is done by exposing the meat for a few minutes to a strong heat which hardens the albumen on the surface, and so forms a case which keeps the juices from running out. The special modes of forming this casing will be found in the general directions for the different ways of cooking. Salted meat, however, should be cooked without this process of hardening, and should be put on with cold water, to soften the fibre and draw out some of the salt. The power of salt to draw out fluids causes salted meats to be much less nutritious than fresh meats; because not only is the fibre har- dened by the salt, but the nourishing fluids are drawn out, and are thrown away with the brine. Salt does not affect fat in the same way—hence well-cooked fat bacon is more digestible than ham. Hard water is best for boiling fresh meat for eating, as the lime in it helps to harden the outer surface. Soft water is best for soup and salt meat, as it does not exercise the same hardening effect. The water in which meat is boiled should be used as stock for soups or gravies, as certain of the nutritive properties of the meat are found in it.

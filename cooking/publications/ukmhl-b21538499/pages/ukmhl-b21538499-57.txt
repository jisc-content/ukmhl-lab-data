53 SOUPS. Ox-cheek Soup.—Required: i ox cheek; 2 car- rots; 2 turnips; 2 onions; a small bunch of savoury herbs or }( teaspoonful celery seed; 1 oz. flour ; 1 oz. dripping; 5 quarts hot water; 1 tablespoonful vinegar; 1 teaspoonful browning; 1 dessert spoonful brown sugar.

Serve the cheek separately, with a little of the soup as gravy. Two oz. semolina or crushed tapioca may be used instead of the flour.

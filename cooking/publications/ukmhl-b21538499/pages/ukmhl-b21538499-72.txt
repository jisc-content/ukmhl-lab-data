68 MEAT—STEWING. Irish Stew.—Required: y2 lb. scrag-end neck of mutton or flap; i lb. potatoes; y lb. onions ; pepper and salt; hot water. Wipe and trim the meat and cut into pieces. Put it into a stewpan and just cover it with hot water. Add a good pinch of salt, bring it to the boil and skim well. Skin and scald the onions and cut them into thin rings. Wash and peel the potatoes and slice down one or two. Add the onions and sliced potatoes to the meat, season with pepper; and simmer from i y2 to 2 hours. About 40 minutes before serving add the rest of the potatoes whole, or if large cut in two. When ready arrange the whole potatoes neatly round a hot ashet; pile the meat in the centre and pour the gravy over. Note 1.—This dish can be made more digestible by parboiling the potatoes before adding them. Note II.—Remains of cooked meat make excellent Irish stew, but should merely be reheated after the onions and potatoes are tender.

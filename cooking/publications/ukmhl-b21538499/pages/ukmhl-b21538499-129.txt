Omelet.—Required: 2 eggs; ^ oz. butter; 1 tea- spoonful soft sugar; 1 small pinch of salt. Break the eggs ; separate the yolks from the whites; add the sugar to the yolks; stir in a basin till they are thick and creamy (about ten minutes). Place the whites with the salt on a dry plate; with a dry sharp knife whisk them in a cool place till they become a stiff froth; mix this gradually in among the yolks, tak- ing care not to beat down the froth. In the meantime let the butter melt, but not discolour, in an omelet pan; pour the mixture into the pan; cook it on the tire till it sets (about two minutes); then place it in the oven to allow it to rise and brown. If there is no oven, hold it before the fire. Turn it out, double it over and serve immediately.

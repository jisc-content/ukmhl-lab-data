As cold contracts the pores of the skin, there is then much less escape of moisture than when the weather is warm. This moisture should be replaced by liquids, fruits, and vegetables, in order that the temperature of the body may be kept uniform. Of the heat-giving foods, starches and sugars are the most suitable for warm climates, as they are easily digested. III. Different Employments.

Those engaged in severe mental work should have animal food, if possible, as part of their diet; garden vegetables should be used, but in small quantities, as they are difficult to digest.

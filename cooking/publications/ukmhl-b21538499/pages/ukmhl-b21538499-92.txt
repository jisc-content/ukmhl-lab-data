MISCELLANEOUS. 88 the fruit, juice, and sugar in a clean pan, which should not be more than three quarters full, as jam boils up. Bring very slowly to the boil, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon; skim carefully ; strawberries and raspberries should then be boiled for about twenty minutes; rhubarb, gooseberries, plums, and black currants about half an hour. When ready place in pots and cover tightly with paper immediately. If the jam is to be used within three months, less sugar—say three quarters of a pound may be used, especially with strawberries and raspberries, which are sweet. Jelly.—Proportions: i pint juice to i lb. loaf sugar. Gather the fruit in dry weather, remove the stalks and any decayed pieces; place it in a clean pan ; let it slowly warm (not boil) till the juice has come well out. Then squeeze the fruit gently in a piece of muslin or clean kitchen towel. Measure the juice; return it to the pan with the sugar, bring slowly to the boil; skim carefully; boil quickly for five to ten minutes. To know if the jelly is ready put a spoonful in a saucer in a cool place; if it stiffens immediately it is ready; if not, boil for a few minutes longer. Put into pots and cover tightly with paper immediately. Where strict economy is practised the fruit left in the muslin or cloth should be stewed with a little water and sugar, and eaten with rice or bread. Snow Pancakes.—Required: freshly-fallen snow; 2 oz. flour; i teaspoonful sugar; i oz. dripping. Place some newly-fallen snow in a basin near the fire; when it has melted, mix as much of it with the flour and sugar as will make the usual consistency of pancake batter. This should form four pancakes. Cook in the same way as ordinary pancakes. Pickle for Meat.—Required: 2 lbs. common salt; 4 oz. brown sugar; 2 oz. saltpetre; 2 gallons water.

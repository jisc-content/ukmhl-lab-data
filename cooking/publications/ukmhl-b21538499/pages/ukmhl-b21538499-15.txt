the materials of food. II the body. The white of egg1 is the type of food which is required for this purpose. Lean meat- and skim milk3 are of the same nature, lhe sticky or glutinous substance4 which was left in the cloth after the starch was squeezed out of the flour, is a flesh former; also parts of almost all grams, such as oats, and barley, and the glutinous5 matter of peas and beans. All these substances will make flesh—-that is, will replace the used-up materials of the body—ana we shall therefore call them II. Flesh-formers.6 Table showing the Chief Flesh-forming Foods. Animal. Lean Meat. Fish. Poultry. Skim Milk. Cheese. White of Egg. Vegetable. Flesh-forming Material exists largely in— Peas. Flour, ) made Beans. Macaroni, [ from Lentils. Semolina, ) wheat. Oatmeal. Rye. Barley. Maize. It will be seen from this table that both the animal and vegetable kingdoms supply flesh-formers. Half a pound of animal food contains a larger amount of flesh-forming power than half a pound of vegetable food. But the same amount of flesh-forming power may be derived from certain vegetable products (which are much cheaper) if taken in large quantities. T. he vegetable products which yield the greatest amount of 1 Albumen. . , . ... 2 The juice of lean meat consists almost entirely of myosin, which is of the nature of albumen. 3 When milk is turned into cheese, this substance is called casein. 4 Glutin. 5 Legumin. . . 6 Technically called Nitrogenous Foods, as nitrogen is the flesh- forming element common to them all. They are also called albuminoid—i.e., white of egg like.

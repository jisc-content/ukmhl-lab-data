i8 THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKERY. The finer pieces of meat which are juicy and tender in fibre are generally roasted or boiled, as these pro- cesses serve to retain the juices, and sufficiently soften the fibre. Coarser and hard pieces should be stewed, as long, slow heat is needed to soften them. Gristly pieces should be slowly boiled or stewed ; because it is only when cooked with liquid that the gristle can become soft. Dry heat, as in roasting, whether before the fire or in the oven, makes gristle tough like leather. Fish contains less albumen than most kinds of animal food; but the same general principle of cookery should be applied to it. The oily kinds, such as mackerel, herring, and salmon, the most nutritious though least digestible, are best suited for grilling. In white fish the oil is principally contained in the liver, which is generally removed from the fish, but may be used in various ways. White fish are gener- ally boiled, fried, or baked. The liquor in which fish is boiled should be used as stock for soup, as there is much nutriment in it, and it is to be regretted that it is so generally thrown away. 2. Vegetables.â€”Vegetables, especially grains, con- tain a large quantity of starch, which is most unwhole- some as an article of diet, unless the grains are swollen and burst. To accomplish this, it must be mixed with a sufficient amount of liquid, and be subjected, for a few minutes at least, to a high degree of heat. The liquid is, in certain preparations, supplied in the form of fat which melts with heat. Suet, butter or dripping may be mixed with flour; but great care must be taken to have the fat very finely mixed with the flour, as when this is not done the flour cakes together, and the melted fat cannot reach it to assist in bursting the grains. For this reason, short crust is

149 INFANT’S FOOD. Nature has provided in the milk of the mother a suitable and sufficient nutriment for the infant. Ex- ceptional circumstances may prevent the mother nursing it. It then becomes necessary to provide other food which should be chosen to resemble as far as possible that supplied by the mother. The best substitute is warm ass’s milk ; next to this comes cow’s or goat’s milk mixed with one third or more of water hot enough to make the mixture warm (about 96° or 98° Fahr.), and a very small quantity of sugar of milk. The mixed milk of the dairy is better than that of one cow, as more equal in quality. It is imperative in towns to sterilize it. Sugar of milk which may be obtained at the chemists, is prefer- able to cane or beet sugar which are apt to cause acidity. Should there be any tendency to rickets, lime water should be substituted for one half of the common water to be mixed with the milk. Lime water may be purchased at the chemist, or made thus :— Lime Water.—Take a piece of unslaked lime the size of a walnut, put it into a quart bottle of water, let it stand twenty-four hours, then filter, and it is ready for use. In most cases when a child has had enough of food, it will show a disinclination for more. Nurses often err in forcing more upon it, and there is nothing more apt to injure the digestion of a child than to stop its crying fits (many of which proceed from over feeding) by offering it food. Only enough for one meal should be prepared at a time, as milk becomes sour, and the slightest sourness makes the milk ferment, and is very hurtful to the infant. For the same reason great care must be taken to have the bottle in which the milk is given perfectly clean. It should be thoroughly washed

16 THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKERY. The chief lesson to be learned from this chapter is, that different classes of food must be represented in the daily diet, and that variety of food is essential to health. A second important lesson is, that food which will form flesh is to be found not only in milk, eggs, and butcher’s meat, but also in vegetable food, especially in pulses and in grains (wheat, barley, oats, &c.), and this food in these pulses and grains is much cheaper than the same kind of food when bought in the form of animal food. CHAPTER II. THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKERY. Food is cooked that it may be made acceptable to the taste, and digestible. The chief modes of cooking are roasting, broiling, boiling, stewing, baking, and frying. Of these modes, boiling is the most digestible; roasting the most nutri- tious; stewing the most economical. In this chapter we shall treat of foods as commonly known, viz., animal food (including milk and eggs) and vegetable food. These require very different management in cooking. Two general rules may be laid down— 1. Meat, milk, and eggs should be cooked at a moderate heat (about i6o° Fahr.). 2. Vegetables (including grains) should be cooked for a short time at least at boiling point (2120 Fahr.). 1. Animal food. Every one knows that when an egg is boiled for four minutes the white becomes quite solid. The material of which white of egg consists is called albumen. Similar substances exist largely in milk, in fish, and in lean meat, but not in fat. If milk

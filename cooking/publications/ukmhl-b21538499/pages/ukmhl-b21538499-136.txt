BREAD, ETC T32 Warm the milk and butter in a pan together till the butter is melted, but not hot Rub the yeast smooth with teaspoonful sugar; add the milk and butter. Stir this mixture gradually into the flour; add the egg slightly beaten; mix till quite smooth. Divide into two and put into well greased tins; set these in a warm but not too hot place for an hour to rise. Then put into a quick oven till baked, about fifteen minutes. Oatcakes.—Required: 4 oz. fine oatmeal; 1 tea- spoonful dripping (preferably bacon); pinch baking soda ; pinch salt; hot water. Mix the oatmeal, soda, and salt.

Rub plenty dry oatmeal into the baking-board, turn out the mixture, form it into a smooth ball and roll out as thinly as possible. Frequently rub in dry oat- meal to make the cakes white. Cut the round in four or eight pieces and place on a hot girdle to cook. When the cakes begin to curl, place them on a tray in a cool oven or in front of the fire till crisp. Dripping may be used instead of the bacon gravy ; but then the water must be hot. The cakes can be rolled out thinner when made with hot water. Cold Porridge Scones.—Required: cold por- ridge ; oatmeal. Knead as much oatmeal into the cold porridge as it will take up ; roll out with a roller to about half an inch of thickness. Cut into neat pieces, bake on a girdle ; when cooked on one side, turn them. In kneading, you must be careful to take up the oatmeal gradually, as, if it be added too quickly, there will be lumps of dry oatmeal found in the scones. A gird e before using should first be put on the fire till it is very hot; then have it raised up from the fire while

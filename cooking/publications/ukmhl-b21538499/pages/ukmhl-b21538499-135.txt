BREAD, ETC. I3i towards the middle, till it no longer sticks to your hands, and feels quite elastic. This quantity makes two loaves. If cottage loaves are wanted, form a large ball and place it on a floured tin; then place a smaller ball on the top of the large one, and make a small hole or mark on the top. If moulds are used, flour them and half fill them with the dough. Cover the loaves and let them rise for about twenty minutes in a warm place, then bake in a hot oven for about two hours. Turn the loaves out of the moulds, or remove them from the tin, and slant them against a dish or board to allow the steam to escape. The above are general directions ; certain flours (generally the best) absorb more water than others, and the pupil must learn by experience the proper consistency of the dough. If brewer’s yeast is used, the dough may stand all night in a warm place. Milk Rolls.— Required: y lb. flour; 1 oz. salt butter; about y2 gill of milk ; y2 teaspoonful baking powder. Rub the flour and butter lightly together with the tips of the fingers. Add the baking powder; gradually stir in enough milk to make it a stiff dough. Take rough lumps and place them on a floured flat tin. Bake in a quick oven till ready, about twenty minutes; place on a sieve to cool. This makes about four rolls. If preferred, the dough may be rolled into small oval shapes, and brushed with milk, or with a slightly beaten egg, to give them a glazed appearance. These rolls must be made as quickly as possible in order to be light. Sally Luns.—Required: y lbs. flour; 2 oz. salt butter; 1 egg; i]/2 gill milk; y2 oz.

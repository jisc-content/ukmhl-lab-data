58 SOUPS. Remove all fat very carefully from the stock; put the stock into an enamelled pan with the white of egg and the shell; whisk all together till the stock looks frothy on the surface, then stir over a slow fire till it steams. Leave off stirring, and allow the soup to boil thoroughly for about five minutes; draw the pan to the side of the fire, and let it stand for about fifteen minutes to allow the scum to rise and curdle. Lay a clean cloth in a colander; strain the soup thiough it into a basin. Cut neatly small pieces of vegetables ; boil them till tender; add to the strained soup , add also a very small piece of loaf sugar, as it makes the soup sparkle. Heat the soup, and serve.

Break flour with enough milk to make it a thick batter; dip each piece of fish into this, and fry. 2nd. Brush the pieces over with milk ; toss them in flour in a sheet of kitchen paper; shake off the loose flour; fry. 3rd. Dip the pieces into batter No. 1 (as above); toss them in stale bread crumbs in a sheet of kitchen paper ; shake off the loose crumbs ; fry. 4th. Break an egg on a plate ; beat it up slightly; dip the pieces in this; toss them in stale bread crumbs in a sheet of kitchen paper; shake off the loose crumbs ; fry.

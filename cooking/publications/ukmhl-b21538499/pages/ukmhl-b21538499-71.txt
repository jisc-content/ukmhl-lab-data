MEAT-BOILING. 67 The tongue may be sliced and used as a garnish or minced with the other parts. Dressed Lamb’s Head is prepared in the same way and is a more delicate dish. Mince.—Required: 3 or 4 tablespoonfuls of the chopped heart and liver, liquor to moisten, seasoning. Mix these together and heat in a pan. Dish on ashet. Brain Cakes.—Required: Sheep’s brains; 2 table- spoonfuls bread crumbs; 1 teaspoonful finely chopped parsley ; pepper ; salt; 1 tablespoonful dripping. After soaking put the brains in boiling salted water, boil gently for about 10 minutes. Strain and chop the brains, mix them with the bread crumbs, parsley, and seasoning. Form into small cakes, using a little flour to prevent the mixture sticking to the board. Make the dripping smoking hot in a frying-pan, fry the cakes, drain and serve them round the head. Dressed Sheep’s Head.—(English Method). Required: 1 oz. butter; 1 oz. flour; 3 gills milk, sheep’s brains; pepper and salt. Make a sauce with the butter, flour, and milk, add the brains, pepper and salt. Remove all the meat from the head (after boiling), put it into the sauce, till thoroughly heated. Dish on hot ashet. XII.—STEWING. The flavour of stews may Ire inexpensively varied by the use of various herbs. See remarks, page 46. Although the gravy of stews may be made with water, they will be richer and more nourishing if, instead of water, they are made with the liquor in which meat has been boiled, liquor from the stockpot, stock made with a few cooked or uncooked bones, or gravy left over from previous stews. When it is not convenient to add the water or liquor warm, it may be added cold.

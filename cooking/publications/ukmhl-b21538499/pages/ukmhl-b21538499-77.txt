MEAT—STEWING. 73 To Make the Stew.—Make the dripping hot in a stewpan ; brown the rabbit in it, then lift it on to a plate. Add the onion cut in thin rings, then the flour, and fry these together to rather a light brown colour. Add the water by degrees and a pinch of salt; bring it to the boil, skim well and add a pinch of pepper. Return the rabbit to the pan and simmer i/4 to 2 hours, skimming and stirring frequently. Cut the carrot and turnip into neat blocks and add them to the stew to cook with the meat. Cut the bacon into thin slices ; remove the rust and rind and form each slice into 2 or 3 neat rolls. Place these on a skewer and cook for 7 or 8 minutes in a moderate oven or in front of the fire till crisp. Pile the rabbit on a hot ashet; place the vegetables round and pour the sauce over. Place the bacon on top of the rabbit to keep it crisp. Note.—A young rabbit will take only about 40 or 50 minutes to cook.

SOUPS. 51 If a more delicate soup is wanted, pass it through a colander when ready, to keep back the pieces of onion. Brown Vegetable Soup.—Required: a small carrot; 1 small turnip ; 1 small onion ; 1 oz. oatmeal; i]/2 oz. dripping ; 3 pints cold water; ^ teaspoonful salt; 1 pinch of pepper. Cleanse the carrot and turnip ; skin and scald the onion. Chop them all very small and dry them with a cloth. Brown the vegetables to a golden colour with the dripping in a stew pan ; put in the oatmeal, stirring till it also is a golden colour. Draw the pan to one side to allow the contents to cool a little. Pour in the cold water gradually, stirring till the whole is quite smooth. Bring to the boil, and boil slowly for at least one hour. Add the pepper and salt a quarter of an hour before serving. Any other vegetables .may be used instead of the above. Flour may be used instead of oatmeal. Bread Soup.—Required: % lb. scraps of bread; 1 oz. dry grated cheese ; 1 oz. dripping ; 3 pints cold water; y teaspoonful salt; 1 pinch pepper; 1 pinch grated nutmeg.

Soda Scones.—Required: y2 lb. flour; y2 of a small teaspoonful carbonate of soda ; y2 teaspoonful cream of tartar; nearly y2 pint butter milk ; y2 tea- spoonful salt. Mix the dry materials well together in a basin ; stir in enough butter milk to make a stiff but elastic dough. Turn it out on a floured board, knead it lightly till it no longer sticks to your hands ; roll out thin ; cut it out in small rounds with a tumbler or tin cutter. Bake them on a tin in a hot oven for about five minutes. When they are risen and the surface is smooth, turn and cook for five minutes longer. They should be a very pale colour. Or put them on a hot girdle and cook first on one side and then on the other, as in the oven. Serve hot or cold. Sugar may be used instead of salt, and they may be made richer by rubbing 1 oz. butter or dripping into the flour before the butter milk is added. Dropped Scones.—Required: y2 lb. flour; small y2 teaspoonful carbonate of soda; small y2 teaspoonful cream of tartar; tablespoonful castor sugar; 1 egg ; buttermilk. Sieve the flour, soda, cream of tartar, and sugar into a dry bowl. Make a well in the centre of these and drop in the egg and a little buttermilk. Beat well together with the back of a wooden spoon to get a smooth paste. Then add enough milk to make it of a thick creamy consistency. Grease a hot girdle, and drop on the mixture in small rounds. When the surface rises in bubbles, turn the scones over with a knife to cook the other side. When ready, cool them on a sieve.

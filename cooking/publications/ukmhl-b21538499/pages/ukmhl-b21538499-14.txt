THE MATERIALS OF FOOD. I. Warmth or Heat-giving Foods.1 Table showing the Chief Warmth-giving Foods. Fats. Cream. Butter. Oil. Yoik of Egg. Suet. Dripping. Lard. Starch. Found in Flour. Potatoes. Arrowroot. Corn Flour. Rice. Semolina. Tapioca. And most Garden Vegetables. Sugar. Found in Sugar Cane. Beetroot. Honey. Fruit. Milk. . heat-giving foods, after digestion, are passed into the blood, which is then pumped by the heart into the lungs. The blood is spread out in little thin hair-like vessels all over the lungs, so that the air breathed into the lungs may mix with it. The mix- tuie of that portion of the air called oxygen with the fatty particles floating in this blood, causes in living creatures a burning up of these fatty particles, and this combustion produces heat, and is so like the process of burning which goes on in a fire, that it is sometimes called animal burning or combustion." This mixture of fresh air with the other particles of food floating in the blood, also causes one of the many changes which they pass through, before they are in a fit state to become part of the body. We must now see what kinds of food, or rather what parts of food, will make flesh, and so build up 1 Technically called Carbonaceous Foods, because they contain a great deal of carbon. Coal, peat, and wood are the carbon burnt in a common fire The air supplies the oxygen, which may be with bellows to make the fire bum briskly. 2 The technical name of this process is Oxidation.

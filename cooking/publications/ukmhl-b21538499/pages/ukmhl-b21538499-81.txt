MEAT—FRYING. 77 it well and draw the saucepan to the side of the fire; simmer for about five hours; remove the meat from the bone; cut it into neat pieces. Break the flour in a basin with a little cold water, remove the fat from the stock, and add about a quart of the stock to the flour and water. Put this mixture into the saucepan with the pieces of meat and the salt. Simmer gently for about ten minutes ; add the parsley, and serve. A few drops of vinegar or lemon juice may be added with the parsley. The remaining stock can be clarified and made into sweet jelly for invalids (see page 141), or used for soup. XIII.—FRYING. Steak Fried in the Pan.—y2 lb. best steak (about 1 inch thick); y2 gill hot water; pepper and salt. Wipe the meat and remove the outside skin, then beat it slightly to make it more tender. Make an iron frying-pan thoroughly hot, and rub it well over with the fat side of the skin trimmed from the steak.

Add a pinch of pepper and salt, and the hot water to the pan. Boil it up, and pour it round the steak.

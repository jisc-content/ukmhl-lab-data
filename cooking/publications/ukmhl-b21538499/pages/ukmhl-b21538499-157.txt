APPENDIX. 153 Second.—In order to gain from a practice class its peculiar advantages as compared with demonstrations, each dish should be entirely cooked by certainly not more than two pupils. Ten, or at most fourteen, pupils so coupled are as many as a teacher can efficiently direct at one time. For practice lessons it is advisable to have a kitchen-range of the kind usually used by the working classes of the district. To enable a class of ten or twelve girls to work at the same time, this should be supplemented by the gas or American stove already mentioned. A sink should be fitted up in the room in which practice lessons are conducted; also a cupboard to hold utensils and stores.

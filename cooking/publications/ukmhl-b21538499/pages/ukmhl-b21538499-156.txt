1 52 APPENDIX. SUGGESTIONS FOR ARRANGING COOKERY CLASSES IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. If a school can be so built as to allow of a room being specially arranged as a kitchen, so much the better, but it is by no means essential. Cookery classes can be conducted in an ordinary well-ven- tilated schoolroom with little or no inconvenience. Cookery may be taught in two ways—first, by de- monstration, in which the teacher cooks and explains the dishes; second, by practice classes, in which the pupils themselves cook. If managers of elementary schools can give the money and allow the time to have the children taught first by demonstration and then in practice classes, that is the most thorough training First.—In demonstration classes the number of pupils that can be admitted depends upon the accom- modation. It is advisable to have the seats slightly raised; if this cannot be done, the teacher must teach from a small platform. She should have either a gas stove or a projecting American stove to cook with, as, if an ordinary close or open range is used, she would require constantly to turn away from her class in attending to the pots and pans on the fire. The utensils should be such as are commonly used by a working man’s family.

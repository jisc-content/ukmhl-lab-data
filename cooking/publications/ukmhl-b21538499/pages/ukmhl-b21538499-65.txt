61 FISH. The dish is more delicate if lemon juice is used instead of vinegar. Stuffed and Baked Haddock.—Required: i haddock ; i oz. bread crumbs; x/2 oz. suet; x/2 tea- spoonful chopped parsley; pinch powdered herbs; pepper and salt; milk to bind ; brown crumbs; i tablespoonful dripping. Stuffing.—Prepare the crumbs, shred and chop the suet. Put crumbs, suet, parsley, herbs, pepper and salt into a bowl. Mix these well and add enough milk to bind together. To Prepare the Fish.—Wash the haddock in cold water. Remove eyes, gills, scales, and the black skin from inside. Trim off the fins and tail. Rinse and dry the fish. Place the stuffing inside and sew up the opening. Truss with a skewer into the shape of the letter S. Melt the dripping in a Yorkshire tin. Lay in the fish and baste with the dripping. Sprinkle with brown crumbs, and bake in a moderate oven about 20 minutes, basting occasionally. Place on a hot ashet, removing skewer and thread. Garnish with parsley. This dish may be improved by using butter instead of dripping, and an egg instead of milk. Baked Herrings.—Required: 2 fresh herrings ; say 1 gill water; say 1 gill vinegar; 6 pepper corns; 1 blade mace ; ^ teaspoonful salt. Cleanse and dry the herrings ; cut off the heads, tails, and fins. Cut from the opening already made for cleaning down to the tail end. Lay them on their backs; remove the bones; sprinkle the salt over them ; roll them up, beginning at the tail end. Place them in a small pie dish with the pepper corns and mace; pour over them enough vinegar and water to cover them; bake in the oven for three quarters of an hour.

With a small- pointed knife (a potato knife costs about 4d.) pare the skin very thin, as the best part is next the skin; cut out the eyes, taking care not to take a slice of potato with them. Place the potatoes in cold water as they are pared, to preserve the colour. New Potatoes.—Wash well in cold water; rub with a rough towel to remove the skin; place in cold water till required. Cabbage, Cauliflower, and Lettuce.—Re- move the coarse outer leaves. To remove earth and insects, place the vegetables in plenty of cold water, with about a desert spoonful of salt to a quart of water, for about half an hour. Carrots.—YYash and brush well in cold water; scrape them downwards (towards the narrow end)' If carrots are to be served as a vegetable, cut each into two or three pieces; if they are to be used for soups, cut into small square pieces; if they are to be fried, cut into slices. Put the cut-up pieces into cold water till required. If they are to be fried, dry each piece carefully.

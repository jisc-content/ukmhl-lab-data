Savoury Custard.—Required: 2 yolks of eggs; 1 white of egg; 1 gill of beef-tea; % oz. of butter; a small pinch of salt. Whisk the yolks and white of egg well together in a basin; stir in the cold beef-tea. Butter slightly a cup or small jar; put the mixture in; cover with a slightly-buttered paper. Place this in a pan of boiling water, the water coming half-way up the jar. Steam thus for about twenty minutes, taking care not to shake the jar, which would curdle the egg. The water must be boiled slowly, to prevent the custard becoming honey-combed. Serve either hot or cold. Nourishing. Mutton Broth.—Required: 1 lb. neck or knuckle of mutton; 2 pints cold water; 1 dessertspoonful whole rice or barley; 1 teaspoonful chopped parsley; 1 teaspoonful salt. Wipe the meat with a damp cloth, and cut it in small pieces, removing skin and fat. Remove the marrow from the bone and put it (the bone) with the meat, water, and salt into a clean lined pan. Bring it slowly to the boil, and remove all scum carefully. Simmer 3 to 4 hours, skimming occasionally; then strain it through a fine strainer. When cold remove all fat from the top, return the soup to a lined pan and add to it the rice or barley (blanched). Cook this for about 20 minutes, and at the last add the parsley. Other thickening, such as arrowroot or crushed tapioca, may be used instead of rice. If liked, the blanched rice or barley may be added after the first skimming and cooked with the meat.

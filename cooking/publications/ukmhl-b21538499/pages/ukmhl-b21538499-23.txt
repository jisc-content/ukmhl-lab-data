ADAPTATION OF FOOD. 19 more wholesome than puff paste, as in the former the starch and fat are more thoroughly mixed. The use of baking powder makes pastry, etc., lighter. In cooking garden vegetables, the heat should reach boiling point, not only because the starch cells must be burst, but because there is a good deal of confined air in vegetables which it is desirable by this means to set free. The water may, however, after five or ten minutes, be reduced to slow boiling, as the full boiling point has the effect of hardening the woody fibre of which vegetables consist largely. The bursting of the starch cells can be carried out at a somewhat lower heat (170° or 180° Fahr.). The cooking of garden vegetables in hard water helps to hold in the nourish- ing juices; but it is at the risk of the lime in the water hardening the woody fibre. Therefore, while hard water makes vegetables more nutritious, soft water makes them more digestible. CHAPTER III. THE ADAPTATION OF FOOD TO VARYING CIRCUMSTANCES. Hunger and thirst are instincts which indicate to us that food is required ; taste is a sense which assists us in selecting food ; but as the stomach can be trained to bad as well as to good habits, it is necessary to exercise intelligence, not only in choosing food, but in adapting its use to the varying circumstances of life. Food should be adapted to I. Different ages. II. Different climates. III. Different employments. IV. Different states of health.

Ingredients.—One dozen sauce oysters, one egg, salt and pepper, parsley, 3 ozs. flour, one tablespoonful oil, one tablespoonful lemon juice. Method.—Sift the flour into a basin, add a small pinch of salt, stir in the yolk of an egg, half the oil, and suffi- cient tepid water to 'form a batter, resembling in consis- tency a double cream. Allow the batter to stand for about an hour. Whisk the white of egg to a stiff froth, and mingle with the batter just before using. Beard the oysters, lay them on a cloth to drain, put them on a plate, season with pepper and salt, sprinkle over with lemon juice, the remainder of oil, and about a teaspoonful of chopped parsley. Mix carefully. Dip each oyster into the batter, and drop into hot fat or lard, fry a golden colour, drain on a cloth or paper, dish up, garnish with parsley and quartered lemon, and serve. 1 Suitable moulds for this dish can be obtained from Messrs.

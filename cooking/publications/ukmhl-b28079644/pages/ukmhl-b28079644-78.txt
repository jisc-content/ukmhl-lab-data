Stamp out six nice rounds of buttered toast about the size of the cut side of the eggs ; sprinkle over thickly with tongue and yolks. Cut the remainder of tongue, gherkins, olives, and anchovies into fine shreds ; mingle gently with a few drops of oil and lemon-juice ; add a little chopped parsley and the capers, also a pinch of white or red pepper, whichever is preferred.

Ingredients.—i oz. butter, i gill cream, three eggs, salt, pepper, and a pinch of cayenne, three or four slices toasted bread, not quite i oz. flour, about i gill milk, one teaspoonful chopped parsley and savoury herbs (tarragon and chervil). Method.—Melt the butter in the stewpan, add the flour, and let cook a little over the fire ; draw away from the fire, and add the cream and milk. Stir constantly until it thickens, let it simmer very slowly, taking care that it does not burn nor curdle. Separate the whites from the yolks of eggs ; beat up the whites to a stiff froth. Mix the yolks with the sauce, season with salt, pepper, and cayenne. Stir in carefully, or rather fold in, the whisked whites just the same as the whites are folded in a cake mixture ; mix in at the same time the parsley and savoury herbs. Have ready the toast cut into convenient slices, put the mixture heaped up on these, smooth over with the blade of a knife, bake in a hot oven until of a golden colour, and serve quickly.

7i FARINACEOUS AND CHEESE DISHES Brush over completely with beaten egg, and roll in breadcrumbs or panurette. Mark the centre again with the small cutter, and fry the cassolettes a golden brown in hot fat. Drain them, remove the inner circles, which form the lids, scoop out some of the inside by means of a small teaspoon, so as to obtain a hollow space in each cassolette. Prepare a nicely seasoned ragout of the shrimps and Bechamel sauce. Fill the cases with this, put on the lids, put them in a hot oven for a few seconds, dish up, and serve very hot.

Peel a cucumber very thinly, and cut it similar to the celery. Drain the latter, and put it into a bowl with the cucumber. Season with salt and pepper, and mix it well with mayonnaise dressing. Heap it up in the bowl, wipe the sides of the bowl with a damp cloth. Surround the salad with a border of small red radishes, garnish with slices of hard boiled egg, sprinkle over a little finely chopped French gherkin and parsley, and serve.

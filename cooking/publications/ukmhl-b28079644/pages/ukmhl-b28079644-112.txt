Roll out, fold in three, and roll out into an oblong shape again ; continue this four or five times, setting the paste aside in a cool place for twenty minutes between each turn. Before using it should be allowed to stand for at least half an hour. SHORT CRUST PASTE. Ingredients.—i lb flour (sifted), not quite \ pint water, 6 to 8 ozs. butter or lard, salt. Method.—Add a pinch of salt to the flour. Rub the butter or lard lightly into the flour until perfectly mixed ; add the water gradually, and work into a smooth paste. Roll it out and fold two or three times. This paste is used for meal pie-crust, but it can be converted into short crust by adding a small handful of sifted sugar after the butter or lard is rubbed into the flour. A yolk of egg or a little milk added will improve the crust; in that case you will require a little less water. LOBSTER BUTTER.

EGGS, OMELETS, ETC. 67 SAVOURY OMELET, FRENCH STYLE. Ingredients.—Four eggs, one dessertspoonful chopped parsley, including a leaf or two of green tarragon and a sprig of chervil, one tablespoonful cream, a pinch of sweet herbs, 1 oz. butter, a clove of garlic, pepper and salt. Method.—Break the eggs in a basin, add the cream, and beat up well; add the chopped herbs and seasoning. Cut the clove of garlic, and wipe the inside of the omelet-pan with the cut side. Melt the butter in this pan, clarify, and when hot pour in the egg mixture. Stir over a brisk fire with a fork until the eggs begin to set, then roll towards the side of the pan opposite the handle. Allow it to take a golden brown colour. Turn out on a hot oval dish, and serve. Tarragon and sweet herbs, or the flavour of garlic may be omitted. A small chopped shallot may be added to the butter and fried a little if liked. HAM OMELET. Break four eggs into a basin, add a good tablespoonful of cream or milk, and a pinch of white pepper ; beat up thoroughly so as to amalgamate the whites with the yolks. Chop finely 1 to 2 ozs. lean ham. Melt an ounce of fresh butter in an omelet-pan, when hot put in the chopped ham, and fry a few seconds so as to blend the ham with the butter. Pour in the beaten eggs, etc., and commence stirring slowly over a bright and brisk fire with a fork. When the mixture begins to get firm, fold the omelet into the shape of an oval cushion ; allow it to set and to get a light brown. Turn out on to an oval dish, and serve quickly. A little hot tomato sauce poured round the omelet will be found a great improve- ment.

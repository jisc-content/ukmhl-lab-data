Chop the meat very finely. Peel and chop the shallots, fry them a golden colour in the remaining ounce of butter ; add the chopped meat and a table- spoonful of grated cheese, moisten with brown sauce, add a little seasoning if needed, and turn on to a plate to cool. Divide the paste in two, roll out both parts thinly. Put a dessertspoonful of the meat mixture on the paste at equal distances and in the shape of a little bell, moisten the paste with a brush dipped in water or beaten egg, cover the paste and meat with the second part of the paste, press down between the balls of meat, cut or stamp out some rounds or squares. Mix a tablespoonful of cheese with a couple of handfuls of breadcrumbs, brush over each rissole with egg, and roll in the prepared crumbs. Fry a golden colour in hot fat, drain, and dish up. Garnish with fried parsley, and send to table with a boat of hot piquante or tomato sauce.

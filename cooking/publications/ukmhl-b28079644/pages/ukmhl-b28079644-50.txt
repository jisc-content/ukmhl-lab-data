Ingredients—One medium-sized tin or terrine of foie- gras pate, pint stiff aspic jelly, two sheets French leaf gelatine, one truffle, 1 gill mayonnaise sauce, ■§■ gill Bechamel sauce, a few sprigs of tarragon and chervil. Method.—Have ready six to eight small flat oval moulds (any pattern). Trim the foie-gras, cut it into slices, and stamp out as many ovals as there are moulds, similar in shape but somewhat smaller. Melt the aspic, and coat the moulds thinly with it. Decorate them with strips of truffle and tarragon and chervil leaves. Stir the mayonnaise sauce to the remainder of aspic while it is still liquid. Coat the moulds with this, and put the remainder in a mortar with the trimmings of foie-gras and pound till smooth ; season to taste. Dissolve the two leaves of gelatine in the Bechamel sauce, and add this to the pounded foie-gras. Pass it through a fine sieve. Coat each of the oval pieces of foie-gras with this mixture, and set it in the moulds, fill up with the puree, smooth over with a knife, and place the mould on the ice to set. When ready for serving, immerse the moulds in tepid water, wipe with a cloth, turn out, and dish up, garnish to taste, and serve.

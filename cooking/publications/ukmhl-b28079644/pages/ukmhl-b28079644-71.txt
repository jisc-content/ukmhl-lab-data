EGGS, OMELETS, ETC. 59 as to form rings of toast. Spread a little fresh butter over each ring, and place them on a well-buttered fire- proof dish. Break an egg carefully into each ring of toast, season with a little salt and pepper, pour about a dessertspoonful of fresh cream round each egg. Put the dish in a slow oven until the white of egg begins to set. Send the dish to table as hot as possible. Great care must be taken that the eggs do not get over-cooked, and above all that the yolks are not disturbed during the process of cooking. POACHED EGGS, CLEMENTINE STYLE. Ingredients. — Six eggs, a handful green peas, two tablespoonfuls mayonnaise, aspic jelly, half a lemon, six oval souffle cases, pint macedoine of cooked vege- tables, white and brown chaudfroid sauces, one truffle, salt and pepper. Method.—Poach the eggs, one at a time, in slightly salted boiling water flavoured with lemon-juice. In poaching the eggs special care must be taken to see that they are completely covered with the white, thus ensuring a neat shape. Trim the edges and place the eggs on a sieve or a cloth to drain. Mask each egg alternately, or half- and-half, with white and brown chaudfroid sauce ; when set garnish with fancifully cut slices of truffle and green peas, or hard boiled white of egg, then cover with a thin layer of aspic jelly. Mix the mayonnaise with a little aspic jelly (half set), add this to the macedoine of vegetables, season with pepper and salt and mix carefully. Put a bed of this into each of the souffle cases (which must be large enough to hold the eggs), place the prepared eggs on the top of this. Decorate the sides with a row of cooked green peas embedded in aspic jelly. Dish up and serve cold as a breakfast dish or savoury.

FISH, ETC. j SAVOURY SARDINE TIT-BITS. Ingredients.—2\ ozs. sardine paste (£ oz. butter, 2 ozs. sardines), 3 ozs. butter, salt, pepper and cayenne, water- cress for garnish, a handful of small cress, one dessert spoonful sweet oil, one teaspoonful vinegar, brown bread, two hard boiled eggs. Method.—Cut some thin slices of brown bread. Put 2 ozs. of sardine paste in a mortar, and pound with the yolks of two hard boiled eggs and 1^ ozs. of butter ; rub this through a fine sieve, and spread it over the slices of bread. Wash the cress and cut it up small, season it with oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper; sprinkle it over the layer of paste. Place another slice of bread on the top, and press together. Spread the top of each with butter, and sprinkle over thickly with finely-chopped whites of hard boiled eggs. Cut them into fanciful shapes or strips about an inch wide. Mix some sardine paste with a little cream or butter, and ornament the surface through a forcing bag, according to taste. Dish them up neatly on a folded napkin or dish paper, and garnish with some picked watercress. SARDINE ECLAIRS. Carefully wipe a number of sardines, and remove the bones. Roll out some puff paste or short crust about one-eighth of an inch thick, and enclose each sardine neatly in a piece of paste. Shape each piece neatly, and place on a baking sheet. Brush the surface of the eclairs with beaten egg, sprinkle some grated Parmesan and a pinch of Paprika pepper over all. Mark each lightly with the point of a knife, and bake in a well- heated oven for about ten minutes. Arrange on a folded napkin or dish paper, garnish with parsley, and serve hot as a breakfast dish or savoury.

Method.—Pick, wash, and blanch the rice, drain well, and put it in a stewpan with the butter ; stir over the fire for a few minutes, then moisten with stock, and cook till tender, adding more stock as required by degrees and as the rice swells whilst cooking. Stir frequently to prevent it from sticking. Now add suffi- cient salt to taste, a pinch of grated nutmeg, and enough Paprika pepper to give the rice a soft pinkish tint. Chop finely the prawns or shrimps, keeping aside a few for garnish, chop the white of the hard boiled egg, and add both, together with the cheese, to the rice. Stir gently till thoroughly hot. Arrange on a hot dish, garnish with hard boiled yolk of egg (rubbed through a coarse sieve, or chopped finely), some prawns or shrimps, and a few sprigs of freshly picked watercress. Serve hot.

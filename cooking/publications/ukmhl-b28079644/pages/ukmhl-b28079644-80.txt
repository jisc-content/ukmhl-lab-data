68 EGGS, OMELETS, ETC. LEEK OMELET. Ingredients.—Three eggs, one tablespoonful grated cheese, two leeks, well washed, trimmed, and stewed in brown sauce, i oz. butter, salt and cayenne, one table- spoonful milk or cream. Method.—Break the eggs into a basin, add the cheese, sufficient salt and cayenne to taste, and the milk or cream. Beat well to amalgamate the yolks and whites of eggs and other ingredients. Cut the cooked leeks into slices, and keep hot in a small stewpan with just enough sauce to moisten. Melt the butter in an omelet- pan ; when thoroughly warm (not too hot) pour in the egg mixture, and stir over a bright fire until the eggs begin to set. Shape quickly into the form of a cushion, place the stewed leeks in the centre, and fold in the ends. Allow the omelet to take colour, then turn out on a hot dish, pour a little brown sauce round the base of the dish, and serve quickly.

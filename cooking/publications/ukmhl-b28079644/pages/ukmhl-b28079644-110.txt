MISCELLANEOUS 98 TARTARE SAUCE. Put two yolks of eggs in a basin, place it in a shallow pan containing some crushed ice, add a teaspoonful of salt, a good pinch of white pepper, a pinch of cayenne, and a teaspoonful of mustard ; stir well together, and add gradually a pint of salad oil, and about a quarter of a gill of tarragon vinegar ; when the sauce is smooth and creamy stir in a good tablespoonful of cold Becha- mel or Veloute sauce, two teaspoonfuls of chopped gherkins, one of chopped capers, one of chopped par- sley, and about half a teaspoonful of finely chopped tarragon and chervil. Do not mix the gherkins, capers, etc., until the sauce is finished, as they are likely to cause the sauce to turn if put in too soon. A few drops of lemon juice may be added if the sauce is found too thick. TOMATO SAUCE. Put into a stewpan 1 oz. of slices of bacon, 1 oz. of butter, and a finely chopped onion, fry a little, and add about 1 lb. of ripe tomatoes freed from stems and cut into slices, stir over the fire a little longer, then add 1 oz. of flour previously mixed with a little cold stock or gravy. Stir in gradually f quart of stock, add a few peppercorns, a few sprigs of savoury herbs and parsley, allow to simmer for half an hour. Remove the herbs, rub through a sieve, return to the stewpan, season with salt, a pinch of caster sugar and pepper, finish with a pat of fresh butter, and serve as required. P.S.â€”A tablespoonful of double cream might be used instead of butter, but the sauce should not be allowed to boil again after the butter or cream as a finish has been added.

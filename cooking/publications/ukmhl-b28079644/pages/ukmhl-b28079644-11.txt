PREFACE KX ' A book devoted exclusively to Breakfast and Supper Dishes should prove a welcome addition to the culinary library, and will, I venture to hope, be found of real help to all engaged in cuisine and household matters. My long experience as a practical cook has made it apparent that such a book is badly needed. I do not, therefore, make an apology for offering this small work. In compiling the recipes I have aimed to introduce as many new and original dishes as possible, so as to bring relief to the monotony of the everyday Breakfast and Supper tables. I have exercised great care in the preparation of this collection of recipes, so as to produce by clear and easy directions dishes that are at once elegant, tasty, and dainty, without exercising extravagance. I sincerely trust that this work will be found thoroughly serviceable, even to the inexperienced, for the directions given should enable any one to prepare most of the dishes successfully and without difficulty.

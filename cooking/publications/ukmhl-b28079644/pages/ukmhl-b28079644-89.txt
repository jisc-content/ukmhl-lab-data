FARINACEOUS AND CHEESE DISHES 77 rounds or ovals, place them on a buttered baking-sheet, prick them with the prongs of a fork, and bake in a sharp oven for about ten minutes. CHEESE STRAWS. Ingredients.—4 ozs. flour (sifted), 3 ozs. butter, two tablespoonfuls cream, 4 ozs. grated cheese, a pinch of cayenne. Method.—Mix the flour and cheese in a basin, rub in the butter, add the cayenne, and moisten with the cream; work into a smooth paste. Roll out about a quarter of an inch thick ; cut the paste into even-sized long narrow strips or fingers, place them on a buttered baking-tin, and bake in a fairly hot oven for eight or ten minutes. Tie up into small bundles with coloured ribbon, and serve hot or cold. CHEESE STRAWS WITH FILLETS OF KIPPERED HERRING. Ingredients.—| lb. short paste, cayenne, one kippered herring, 1 oz. grated Parmesan, ground mace. Method.—Roll the paste out rather thinly, sprinkle it with grated Parmesan cheese, cayenne pepper, and a very little ground mace; fold together both ends towards the centre, roll out again, and sprinkle as before. Fold again, and roll out rather thinly this time. Cut it into fingers about four inches long and a quarter of an inch wide. Cut some strips of kippered herring fillets exactly the same size as the paste, place one of each together, and twist them to give them the appear- ance of a screw; close the ends with your thumb and forefinger, and bake them for a few minutes in a quick oven. These should be dished up in transverse rows, and be served as hot as possible.

Med K10577 HOW TO PREPARE IT. Put half a teaspoonful of the powder into a breakfast cup (more than that quantity is not required), pour on boiling water whilst stirring briskly — but be sure the water is boiling—then add milk and sugar to taste. Better still, boil milk and water together in equal pro- portions, pour on to the half teaspoonful of powder, stir, and sweeten to taste. When time is of no consequence, it is a good plan to pour it all back into the saucepan and bring to the boil for a second or two (on no account allowing it to stew); when returned to the cup, add the desired amount of sugar. These instructions should be strictly followed, and the delightful aroma and delicate flavour of Rowntree’s Elect Cocoa, will be brought out to the full. In the hands of a clever cook Rowntree’s Elect Cocoa becomes the chief ingredient of some of the most delicious dishes that can be placed upon the table, as for instance :— CHOCOLATE CAKE.—Ingredients: 4 oz. castor sugar, 4 oz. flour, 4 oz. butter, 2 eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls Rown- tree’s “Elect” Cocoa, 1 teaspoonful baking powder, flavouring, milk. Stir butter and sugar together 5 minutes, then add one egg well beaten, and part of flour and cocoa (mixed together), when well mixed add other egg with more flour and cocoa, then add remainder of flour and cocoa with baking powder, also the flavouring and suf- ficient milk to make soft paste. Put mixture in a shallow tin, well greased and lined with paper, bake for 40 to 50 minutes in moderate oven; when cold, cut in fancy shapes. Of all Grocers, Confectioners, &c.

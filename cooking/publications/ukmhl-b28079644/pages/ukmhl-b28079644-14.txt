Turn on to a plate and let cool. Pound the roes and shallot in a mortar, adding an ounce of butter ; season with a pinch of cayenne pepper and some aromatic spice or seasoning (Epice culinaire) to impart a savoury flavour. Spread the mixture thickly on to the prepared croutes of fried bread. Sprinkle the top with chopped hard boiled white of egg, or form some pretty design with the yolk and white of egg. Squeeze a little lemon juice over each, set in a hot oven for a few seconds, dish up, and serve very hot. BLOATER FRITTERS. Ingredients.—Two bloaters, 1^ ozs. grated cheese, frying batter, frying fat. Method.—Split the bloaters, take out the bones, re- move the skins, cut off the heads, and divide each fillet into three or four neat pieces. Mix the frying batter with an ounce of finely grated cheese.

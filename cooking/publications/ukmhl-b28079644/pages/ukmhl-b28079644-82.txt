FARINACEOUS AND CHEESE DISIIES 70 Method.—Pick, wash, and drain the rice. Peel and chop the shallots. Melt the butter in a stewpan, add the shallots, and fry a golden colour. Stir in the curry powder, and fry a few minutes longer, stirring all the while ; then add the rice, and shake the pan over the fire in order to blend the rice thoroughly. Moisten gradually with the brown sauce, cream, and a little stock if found necessaiy. Peel the tomato, cut it into dice, and add also. Cook gently till the rice is tender. Be careful that the rice is kept moistened, as it swells in cooking; stir frequently but gently. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of ground mace and nutmeg. Dish up, surround the base with hard boiled slices of egg, and a tuft of watercress between each slice of egg. Serve very hot. CASSOLETTES OF RICE WITH SHRIMPS.

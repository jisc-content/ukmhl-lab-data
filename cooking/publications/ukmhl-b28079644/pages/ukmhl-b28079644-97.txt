Method.—Mix the flour with the cheese (2 ozs.), rub in the butter, moisten with the egg-yolk and a little milk, and work into a smooth but fairly firm paste. Roll out rather thinly, stamp out some rounds or ovals according to the shape of the moulds, and line a number of shallow patty or tartlet-pans (these may be round or oval), prick the bottoms to avoid blistering in baking, fill up with rice, and bake a nice light brown colour. Remove the rice, and let the croustades get cool. Whip the cream until stiff, mix in the grated cheese (1 oz.), the Paprika, and the celery salt. Fill the croustades with this. Cut some fine strips of red chillis, and ornament the surface of the croustades in the form of lattice-work, place a caper or a tiny round of cornichon in each cavity.

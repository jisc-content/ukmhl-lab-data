FARINACEOUS AND CHEESE DISHES 75 and proceed thus until sufficient raviolis are obtained. Drop these into fast boiling and slightly salted water, and boil for about fifteen or twenty minutes. Take them up and drain on a sieve. Dress them on a dish in layers with tomato sauce, and grated Parmesan cheese between each layer. Sauce over well with tomato sauce, and place a few tiny bits of fresh butter here and there. Set the dish in a brisk oven for ten minutes, and serve quickly. RAVIOLI TIMBALES WITH PARMESAN CHEESE. Ingredients.—Two to two dozen and a half small raviolis (prepared and cooked as in the foregoing recipe), tomato sauce, seasoning, ^ lb. short crust paste, 3 ozs. utter, i-J- ozs. grated Parmesan cheese. Method.—Roll out the paste as thinly as possible. Butter six to eight small timbale or bouche moulds; stamp out the same number of rounds of paste to fit the bottoms of the mould, lay them into the moulds, and prick the paste to prevent blistering in baking. Stamp out by means of a column cutter some rounds about the size of a sixpence, dip each round of paste into a little beaten egg, and line the sides of the moulds with these, so as to overlap each other (arrange them in rows). Fill the moulds with rice or dried peas, and bake in a fairly warm oven for about ten minutes. Take out the rice or peas, but do not remove the crusts from the moulds. Melt the butter. Fill up the centre of the moulds with cooked raviolis, alternately with layers of Parmesan cheese, tomato sauce, and oiled butter. Place them in a hot oven for another fifteen or twenty minutes. Un- mould on a hot dish, place a little ravioli (kept back for this purpose) on top of each, sauce over with hot tomato sauce, and serve.

FISH, ETC. 12 TOASTED OYSTERS. Toast some slices of white or brown bread. Cut some thin slices of cooked ham. Stamp out some rounds of toasted bread and ham about to 2 inches in diameter. Cover each round of toast with ham, and place upon them the same number of oysters as there are rounds of toast. The oysters should be drained from the liquor and bearded. Put a tiny piece of fresh butter on top of each oyster, season with a pinch of salt and a pinch of cayenne, then bake in a hot oven for about three minutes. Dish up on a folded napkin or lace paper, garnish with parsley, and serve hot. CROUSTADES OF SALMON, DEVILLED. Ingredients.—| lb. smoked salmon or thin lax, £ oz. butter, \ lb. short crust paste or puff paste, one tea- spoonful chopped parsley, one teaspoonful chopped shallots, curry powder and cayenne. Method.—Roll out the paste, and line eight to ten small tartlet moulds. Prick the bottom with a fork to prevent blisters in baking, fill up with some rice or dry peas. Bake a golden colour, take out the rice or peas, and put the crusts on a baking tin. Cut the salmon into fine shreds. Melt the butter in a small saute-pan, put in the shallots, and fry a light brown ; then add the salmon or slices of lax if the latter be preferred. Toss over the fire, taking care not to smash up the fish. Season with a good pinch of curry powder and a pinch of cayenne, shake well, and mix in the parsley. Fill up the crusts with this, bake for a few minutes, and serve very hot. SALMON TIMBALES. Ingredients.—| lb. cold salmon (free from skin and bones), 4 ozs. breadcrumbs, a teaspoonful lemon juice,

MEAT, ETC. 24 CHICKEN CROUSTADES. Ingredients.—4 ozs. calf's liver, 1 oz. butter, 8 ozs. chicken (freed from skin and bones), salt, mignonette pepper, aromatic spice, Madere sauce, 2 ozs. bacon, two shallots, 2 ozs. panade, three whole eggs, a sprig of thyme and marjoram, one truffle, about lb. short crust paste. Method.—Cut the liver and bacon into thin slices and season to taste. Peel and chop finely the shallots, fry them in the butter a pale brown colour. Put in the bacon and fry a little, then add the liver and toss over the fire for a few minutes, together with the thyme and marjoram (only very little of each must be used). Re- move the herbs, and pound the remainder in a mortar. Pound the chicken separately, add the panade and three yolks of eggs ; when smooth and thoroughly mixed season with a little aromatic spice, and salt and pepper if found necessary. Now add the liver farce, and mix it well together with the truffle chopped finely. Rub this through a fine wire sieve. Should the farce be found too stiff, a little brown sauce (Madere) may be added. Roll out the paste rather thinly, and line several croustade or timbale moulds with it, trim the edge of the paste, and prick the bottoms to prevent blistering. Whisk the whites of eggs to a stiff froth, and mingle rather more than half with the prepared farce (force- meat). Fill up the lined moulds with it, and put them on a baking-sheet into a fairly hot oven. Bake for about twenty-five to thirty minutes. When half done spread a little of the remaining whipped white of egg on top of each croustade, and sprinkle with a little grated cheese mixed with a pinch of cayenne pepper, and finish baking. The white of egg can be put on the croustades by

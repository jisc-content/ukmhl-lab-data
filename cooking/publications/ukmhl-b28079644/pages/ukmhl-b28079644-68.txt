SAVOURY VEGETABLES AND SALADS 56 CHESTNUT AND CELERY WITH MAYONNAISE. (A Smart Supper Dish.) Ingredients. — i gill mayonnaise, one head white celery, one blade mace, one slice onion, \ oz. sheet gelatine, salt, pepper, and Paprika, one French gher- kin, -J- pint aspic jelly, % pint shelled walnuts, one bayleaf, \ pint tomato pulp, one teaspoonful tarragon vinegar, a few tarragon leaves, and chillis for garnish. Method.—Mask a plain border mould (pint size) with a thin coating of aspic, decorate the side with fanci- fully cut chilli and tarragon leaves. Mix half a gill of mayonnaise, with enough liquid aspic jelly to make it set, and line the decorated mould with this. Put it in a cool place to set. Meanwhile put the walnuts in a stewpan, cover with boiling water and a little salt, the mace, bayleaf and onion, and boil for ten minutes or so. Drain, and put them in cold water, remove the skin, and shake them gently in a towel. Cut them into shreds. Dissolve the gelatine and add to the tomato pulp, season with pepper, salt, and half a teaspoonful of Paprika, flavour with the vinegar, boil up, and strain. When almost cold mix with it about half the shredded walnuts. Fill the border mould with this preparation, and put the mould in a cool place until required. Wash and scrub the celery, rinse it well, and dry on a cloth. Remove all the green parts and cut the white part into julienne strips. Mix these in a basin with the remainder of the walnuts. Add pepper and salt to taste. When ready for serving unmould the border and dress on a round dish. Season the salad with mayon- naise and place it in the centre of the dish. Pile up high, sprinkle with a little chopped gherkin, and serve.

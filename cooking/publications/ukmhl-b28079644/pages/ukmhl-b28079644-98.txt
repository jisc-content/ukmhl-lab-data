86 FARINACEOUS AND CHEESE DISHES Method.—Cut the toast into neat squares (about ij inches), cut them open, butter the cut sides lightly, and sprinkle with plenty of grated cheese. Season each with a good pinch of Paprika or a tiny pinch of Nepaul pepper. Place them together into their original shapes. Set them in a hot oven on a baking-sheet for a few minutes, taking great care that the bread does not get too brown. Take out, dish up, sprinkle the top with grated cheese, and serve quickly. COLD CHEESE SANDWICHES. Ingredients. — Two tablespoonfuls grated cheese, a little crisp celery or a few shelled and peeled walnuts, cayenne, one large tablespoonful double cream, bread and butter.

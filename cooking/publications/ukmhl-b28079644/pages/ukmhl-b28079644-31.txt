Ingredients.—§■ lb. flour, i oz. grated cheese, a little milk, i oz. cold chicken meat, two slices pickled beet- root, i gill stiffly made mayonnaise, 4 ozs. butter, one yolk of egg, 2 ozs. ham or tongue, six stoned olives, a handful of cooked green peas, one tablespoonful capers, seasoning. Method.—Sift the flour into a basin, rub in the butter, add the cheese and mix well, moisten with the yolk of egg, and put enough milk to form a fairly stiff but smooth paste. Roll out the paste on a floured board. Stamp out some rounds, and line a number of small fluted patty pans, or very tiny buttered brioche moulds, prick the paste to keep it from rising, fill these with raw rice, and bake a nice colour in a moderate oven. Remove the rice, turn out the crusts, and let them cool. Cut up the ham or tongue and chicken into very small dice, or fine shreds, cut the olives to match, and put these together with the peas and capers in a basin. Stamp out some rings of beetroot, allowing one for each tartlet. Chop up the trimmings of the beetroot, and mix with the remainder of the ingredients in the basin. Season to taste, and mix with a little mayonnaise. Fill the taitlet crusts with this, cover with a layer of mayon- naise, place a ring of beetroot on top of each, dish up, and serve.

39 MEAT, ETC. FOIE-GRAS RISSOLETTES. Ingredients.—One small terrine foie-gras, 2 ozs. cooked tongue, 1 lb. puff paste, frying fat, six preserved mush- rooms, two tablespoonfuls Veloute or Bechamel sauce, parsley for garnish. Method. — Prepare a salpicon with the foie-gras, mushrooms and tongue, put it in a small stewpan, and moisten with sufficient sauce to obtain the right con- sistency for a salpicon. Heat up, and put on a dish to cool. Have ready some good puff paste (six turns), roll out about one eighth of an inch thick, and stamp out some rounds with a plain cutter. Put about a teaspoonful of the salpicon mixture in the centre of each round of paste, slightly wet the border thereof, and fold over so as to produce half-moon shapes ; press down lightly so as to close the ends. Fry in smoking hot fat, drain, and serve on a dish with a folded napkin. Garnish the dish with sprigs of freshly picked parsley, plain or fried. The fat must be very hot but not burning. Take special care not to touch the edges of the paste, other- wise the dish will not be a success, because the paste will not rise.

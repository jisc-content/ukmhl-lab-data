Mix the cold meat, breadcrumbs, parsley, onion, mixed herbs, and ham or tongue in a basin ; moisten with the egg (previously beaten), season to taste with salt, pepper, and a grate of nutmeg. Spread this on to a plate and allow to stand for a time. Divide into six or eight portions, shape like a cork, place each on a slice of bacon and roll up, tie with fine twine, or fasten them on to skewers. Bake in a fairly hot oven for about half an hour ; brush over with dissolved meat glaze (if handy). Have ready some neatly-cut pieces of toasted and buttered bread, the size of the olives, place the olives on these, dish up, garnish with parsley, and serve hot. HAM AND EGG TARTLETS.

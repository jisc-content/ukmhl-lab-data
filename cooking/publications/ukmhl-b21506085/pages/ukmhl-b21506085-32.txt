IN FOREIGN KITCHENS. 24 Devonshire Junkets. — One pint of new milk, a cup of clotted cream, one tablespoonful of brandy, and one of prepared rennet, half a cup of sugar, and quarter of a nutmeg grated. Make the milk warm, but not hot, add brandy, sugar, and rennet, and set in a cool place. When firm, spread the cream over the top, dust with powdered sugar, and serve cold. Yorkshire Toasted Tea-Cakes. — Make a sponge with three pints of sifted flour, one teaspoonful of salt, one pint of warm milk, one teacup of butter melted in it, and half a cake of yeast dissolved in a little warm water. Let this rise very light, add a beaten egg, and enough flour to knead into a smooth dough. Make this into flat cakes the size of a plate; let them rise an hour, and bake in a moderate oven. Do this the day before using. When used, split in two, toast on each side, butter each side, pile them in layers, cut like a pie, and serve very hot. They can also be eaten fresh, and are then buttered hot; but toasted tea-cakes are regarded as more distinctively Yorkshire.

13 ENGLAND. land was the light, sweet, tender bread of good American housekeeping to be discov- ered. In toast it was fairly good, but as bread and butter, a thing to be tolerated, since bread must be, but never heartily enjoyed. But a properly toasted English muffin or crumpet, as well as a tea-cake, is so good that one forgives the bread; and there are firm little pasties enclosing pigeons or game, delicious in flavor, and good hot or cold. Potted meat, game, and fish are put up in the most perfect fashion, potted pigeons being something to remember with joy, and imitate if possible, and English jams and sweetmeats are all choice and deli- cate. Who does not remember the tragedy of the apricot puff in the “Mill on the Floss,” and Tom’s renunciation of the half with most jam in it, eaten blissfully by Maggie, with no thought of the reproach for greedi- ness awaiting her. The English schoolboy rejoices in such puffs. In fact, apricot seems the symbol for the utmost charm in any tart or puff, and Thackeray learned to treat all his boy friends to apricot omelette after beefsteak pudding,— a combination at which he himself shuddered.

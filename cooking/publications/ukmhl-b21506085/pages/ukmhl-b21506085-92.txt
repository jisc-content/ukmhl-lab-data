84 IN FOREIGN KITCHENS. cooking is Italian or French, as one may elect. Now and then the Italian chimney has its share, and a flavor of smoke may be discerned, the miracle being that it is not al- ways there, since smoke and Italian chimneys have been synonymous from the beginning. An ingrained incompatibility exists, and apparently has always existed, between the Italian and fire of any sort. It is certain that the sun appears to him the only legiti- mate source of heat, that he would cook by it if he could, and that hot ashes in*a copper holder, the forerunner of our grandmotherâ€™s foot-stoves, are his notion of a desirable method of keeping warm in winter. The newer houses claim to have chimneys con- structed on the English principle, but the Italian is utterly aghast at the amount of fuel demanded by both Americans and Eng- lish. The kitchens are arranged after the French fashion; that is, the chimney holds a stone table with various openings for char- coal fires. But the general effect is far more cheerful and ample; there is more light, more space, and quite as good a sense of order.

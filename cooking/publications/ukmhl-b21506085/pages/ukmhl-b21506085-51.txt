FRANCE. 43 Chartreuse of Partridges. — Stew two par- tridges, and at the same time a small summer cabbage with two sausages, half a teaspoon- ful of salt, and a pinch of cayenne. Cut one carrot and one turnip in thin rounds; boil till tender in salted water. Butter a tim- bale mould, which should be not very high. Cover the bottom with the carrots, turnips, and sausages, in slices. On these lay the partridges, and cover all with the stewed cab- bage. Lay a buttered paper over the mould, and let it cook in a slow oven for an hour. Then reverse on the dish on which it is to be served; see that there is no fat or juice to make it unsightly, and serve very hot. Little Souffles of Cheese. — Boil one pint of rich milk, and add one teaspoonful of butter, one small cup of fresh bread-crumbs, and cook for five minutes, stirring all the time. Then add six beaten yolks of eggs, one cup of Parmesan cheese, one teaspoonful of sugar, and a pinch of salt. Beat the six whites very stiff; mix, and put in small oiled patty-pans, and bake in a quick oven for about fifteen minutes. Serve at once before they fall.

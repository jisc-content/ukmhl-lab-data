88 IN FOREIGN KITCHENS. Frenchwoman’s. Our next neighbor, an Italian advocate’s wife, busied herself in much the same fashion. The cook Assunta, long in her service, knew the family tastes, and scarcely needed assistance; but the mistress prepared special dishes now and then, chiefly compotes and light sweets. But, like the French, the larger portion of the people eat little sweet, save perhaps in ices taken at the cafes, dessert being most usually simply fruit and cheese. Mistress and maid went together to market, pausing on the way for five minutes’ devotion in one or another of the innumerable churches, and issuing for the season of profound ex- citement which marketing in Italy always affords. Instant destruction for everybody concerned is the stranger’s first feeling as the voices rise to a shriek and arms fly and madness seems to rule. But it all ends placidly, and the dinner has a better flavor for having been fought for. The early coffee or chocolate is taken with a roll or two, and the mid-day meal is like the French second breakfast, almost a din- ner, the dinner proper being at six or seven.

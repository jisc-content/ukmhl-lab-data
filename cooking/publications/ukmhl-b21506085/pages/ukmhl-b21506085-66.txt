58 IN FOREIGN KITCHENS. eat all, and more than all, that was possible, was the chief thought of the Frau Rath, who watched the plates anxiously, and felt it a personal offence if a dish remained untried. At four o’clock coffee was served in the drawing-room or on the terrace, and at seven came supper, — practically dinner on a smaller scale, since hot roast of some kind, with salad and a vegetable, and stewed fruit of some sort, was always served. Cakes, sweetmeats, and various adjuncts of the American supper were never seen. Tea was a mockery, wine and beer taking its place for most. Fresh fruit was frowned upon as unhealthy, and served only as a compote; and fruit at or before breakfast the Frau Rath declared to be simply rank poison. Grapes were for wine, and not to be wasted in other ways, though, as a “cure,” people might sometimes take them. But good meat and vegetables, with plenty of wine, beer, and coffee, were true food, such as made good fighters and good scholars; and a dinner, to be truly a dinner, must have not less than three forms of meat, all prepared in the richest manner.

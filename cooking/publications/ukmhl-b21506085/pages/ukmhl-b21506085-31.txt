ENGLAND. 23 pound of candied peel cut fine, and a tea- spoonful of powdered cinnamon. Add a small cup of blanched almonds cut in bits; let it stand half an hour, and then bake for one hour in a moderate oven. While still hot, prick holes with a sharp knife and pour in a syrup made of one cup of sugar and a large tablespoonful of water, boiled together five minutes. Cover the top of the cake with harlequin comfits, or dust it thick with powdered sugar, the comfits, however, being the old way. Devonshire Cream —This delicious cream, sent to the London market in small square tins, is eaten by many an American in Co- vent Garden, and is made as follows: The milk should stand twenty-four hours in win- ter, and twelve in summer, and then is put on the stove till it is almost at boiling-point. It must not boil, but must show small rings and look thick. The slower it is done the better. It is not to be skimmed till the following day, and is then what is known as “clotted cream.”

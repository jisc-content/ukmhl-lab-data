IO IN FOREIGN KITCHENS. boarding-houses the story is the same; while if one knows private life in England and vists in country houses, he finds that the French order prevails, and real English dishes remain in the background. English meats are of a quality unknown even to the highest order of American butcher, since we have, as yet, no system of feeding expressly for market such as prevails in England. It is true that one finds much American meat, and even more from Australia; but it is la- belled so, and brings far less price than the native meat. Nowhere but in England can one find such mighty chops, an inch and a half thick, firm and fine in grain, tender as chicken, and served spluttering hot from the gridiron, with their accompaniment of mealy potatoes in demi-toilette, since the skin is cut from each side only. The English cook has mastered a potato, a thing the French cook has never learned; but his power stops at a potato in its jacket. For mashed po- tato in its perfection, as well as for baked, America has the palm, meaning always by America the land of good housekeepers. The bad ones are ignored.

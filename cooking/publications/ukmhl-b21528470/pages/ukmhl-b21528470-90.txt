The condition of the fire is of importance ; you cannot fry properly over a bad one ; continous care is another necessary condition. Successful frying, in short, demands both skill and knowledge, and in proportion to their exercise and degree will be the reputation of both frying and the fried. “ The art of frying,” says Sir Henry Thompson, “ is little understood, and the omelet is almost entirely neglected by our countrymen. The products of our frying-pan are often greasy, and therefore for many persons indigestible, the shallow form of the pan being unsuited for the process of boiling in oil, that is, at the heat of nearly 500 deg. Fahr. (that of boiling water being 212 deg.). This high temperature produces results which are equivalent indeed to quick roasting (when the article is cooked in boiling fat); but frying as generally conducted is rather a combination of boiling and toast- ing (or scorching); and the use of the deep pan of boiling oil or dripping which is essential to the right performance of the process, and especially as preventing

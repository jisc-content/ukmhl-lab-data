843 MENUS AND THEIR COMPILATION In England, America, and France much art and luxury have been lavished on menu cards. Parchment of the Middle Ages competes with Japanese rice-paper. Some menus, with their seals and ribbons, are like a charter of nobility, whilst others are in the form of beautiful miniature fans. For some time there has been a reaction against extravagant luxury, which is being replaced by a sim- plicity not less excessive. Sometimes the names of the dishes are written by hand on thick paper, without any ornamentation. As usual, the best kind are between these excesses of ostentation and severity. Menus of out-of-the-way and awkward shapes are at all times to be avoided, because they encumber the table and are difficult to consult. Without microscopical print, they should be suffi- ciently small to be readable without remark, and not add to the embarrassment caused by a succession of glasses and other articles on the table. The menu card is a simple accessory, and should be treated as such. This rule ought to be taken into consideration when ordering the shapes and sizes. When a menu card has too much prominence given at the table, we run the risk of it being said that “ the dinner on the paper is better than that on the plates.” Among the many points that a cook has to study in order to be perfect in his profession, the composition of a menu is undoubtedly one of the most important. The number of guests for which a meal is to be provided must first of all be taken into considera- tion ; then the style—that is to say, whether'it is to be an expensive or plain luncheon, dinner, or supper that is required, for the menus are generally compiled according to the means and positions of the guests.

75 NOTES ON ROASTING roasting than in cold. Thick joints—say sirloins of beef or legs of mutton—will not be well cooked if roasted as long as you would roast thinner ones, such as ribs of beef or shoulders. Boned or stuffed meat will require longer cooking than the same joints would unstuffed, or writh the hone in. The meat of young animals and of older ones requires different treatment (as a rule, young flesh, containing less fibrin requires most cooking) ; some kinds of meat are best roasted before a brisk fire (pork, veal, and lamb, for instance) ; others should be more slowdy cooked. [Some flesh requires very little cooking, some much longer—the flesh of old and full- grown animals, poultry excepted, requiring the shorter time.] The cook’s aim should be to preserve the real flavour and nourishing qualities of the meat, and to prevent the juices from being dried out during the roast- ing process. Attaining this aim depends chiefly upon the roasting being neither too quick nor too. slow, and upon the care given to the basting, which should always be thoroughly done. Avoid thrusting forks into roasting meat. It is a good plan to begin with the meat rather close to the fire and then a little farther from the fire, increasing the distance between the grate and the joint until (the exterior being hardened) the flesh is heated nearly uniformly all through, and then bringing it and keeping it near the fire, lest remaining too far from it should destroy its crisp firmness, and make it un- pleasantly soft and soddened. If too little cooked or underdone, meat is indigestible. If too much cooked or 5

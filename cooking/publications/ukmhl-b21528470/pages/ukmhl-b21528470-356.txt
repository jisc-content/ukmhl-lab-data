844 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY The bills of fare vary according to the seasons of the year, and are made up as a rule with dishes appropriate to the times ; there are also certain rules and regula- tions which must at all times be strictly observed. In compiling a menu it is necessary to study the variety of dishes, and their selection, for each dish should vary by its colour and taste from those served before or after. The character of dishes must be retained throughout ; sauces should correspond in taste and colour with the viands with which they are intended to be served. If there are two soups quoted on a menu, one ought to be clear and the other thick; should the thick soup be a puree of vegetables, the clear soup must contain no vegetable roots as garnishing. When two or more fish are to be served, the first, as a rule, is boiled, and generally a large fish, such as turbot, salmon, cod, &c.; the next one would be a small fish, either fried or broiled. Whitebait are often served as a third fish. The entrees should always be so classified that light dishes, such as rissoles, bouchees, croquettes, quenelles, kromeskis, &c., are served first of all. If there are two removes, poultry is served before the butcherâ€™s meat. The cardinal point is to have all dressed removes served before the plain roasted ones. What is called the second service on a menu in- cludes the roast, the savoury, and the sweet entremets, the dessert, and cheese. When two or more sweets are served, the first one is to be hot and the other cold. If fancy savouries are given, they come in after the sweets, for they are intended to prepare the palate for the taste of the choice wines which usually follow a good dinner.

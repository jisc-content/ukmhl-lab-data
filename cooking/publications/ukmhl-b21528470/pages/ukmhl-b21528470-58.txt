48 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY in n.c. 829, writes : “ It is less a rebuke for a man to be busy to know what is done in his kitchen than for a woman to know what is done without her house.” Then, again, in 1590, Spencer says:— “ They both attone. Did outie to their lady as became, Who passing byforlh led her guests anone Unto the kitchen roome, ne spared for nicenesse none.” In the poem of “ Piers the Ploughman ” there is the following passage: “ Ich be cook in here kitchen.” Geoffrey Chaucer, who lived in the 14th century, writing in “ The Wyf of Bathe’s Tale,” speaks of “ blessing halles, chambers, kitchens and boures, cities and burghs, castels hihe and toures.” Shakespeare writes is his “ Comedy of Errors” :— “ There is a fat frind at your master’s house that kitchen’d me for you to-day at dinner.” Some of the culinary affairs of yore disclose most envious facts in connection with cooks and kitchens ; for instance, there is a hook with the kitchens of the olden time, strange tricks and fancies, called “ Porta’s Natural Magicke.” It gives directions as to the ways of roasting and boding a fowi at the same tune, so that one half shall be roasted and the other boiled, and concludes that, should you have a lack of cooks, there is a way of persuading a goose—how* to roast himself.

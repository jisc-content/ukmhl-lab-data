27 THE ART OF COOKERY Feasts and Epicures of Olden Times. An old cook gives the following as the ordinary bill of fare for a gentleman’s table about Candlemas. The first course consisted of cock-a-leekie, a Chatham pudding, a fricassee of chicken, a leg of mutton, all garnished with barberries ; the second, the more sub- stantial, included a chine of mutton, a chine of veal, a lark pie, a pullet larded, a pullet plain, all garnished writh slices of orange ; the third, woodcocks, a couple of rabbits, asparagus, a Westphalia gammon; the fourth, two orange tarts, a bacon tart, an apple tart, a tart of Bon Chretien pears, a dish of pippins, and a dish of pearmains. Still earlier (1470), at a tremendous banquet given by the Earl of Warwick to George Neville, his brother, upon his being raised to the dignity of Arch- bishop of York, the provisions are on a truly Gargantuan scale. This is the authentic list of material used on the occasion : — 300 quarters of wheat 300 tuns of ale 104 tuns of wine 1 tun of spic’d ale 10 fat oxen 0 wild bulls 300 pigs 1,004 wethers 400 hernsies 200 pheasants 500 partridges 4.000 woodcocks 400 plovers 100 curlews 100 quails 1.000 eggets 2

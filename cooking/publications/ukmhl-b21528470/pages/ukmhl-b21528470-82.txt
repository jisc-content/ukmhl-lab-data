PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 70 ledge be great or small, it ought to be faced. No intelli- gent and competent housekeeper, whether mistress or servant, should, however, be contented by merely acquir- ing the rudiments of cooking; she should be able to compound cheap and palatable dishes, the recipes for which she had herself put together. Anything which is a personâ€™s duty to do should be done well, and by doing so one ought to find pleasure and pride in it. Cooking being such an important part of the daily work of millions of mistresses and servants, it is one of those things in which they should excel. They should not begrudge the time and study required to enable them to become skilful and economical cooks. It is no trifling matter to serve day after day half- boiled potatoes and badly cooked vegetables, unpalatable stews, and underdone meat; the human stomach not only fails to get its proper nourishment as it should from these viands, but it experiences also inconvenience, contracts disease, and suffers the consequent penalty. What can be more unpalatable than food served up before it is properly cooked, and what less satisfying to the appetite ? Any food which the stomach loathes, whether from toughness, richness, bad flavour, or un- palatableness, is not a pleasure, and cannot possibly be wholesome or economical, and must consequently be injurious to human health. Wise people can check gluttony, if good cookery should encourage over-eating; but this I should hardly think would be the case.

43 THE COOK AND THE KITCHEN are much more conspicuous than in any other part of an establishment. Cleanliness is the most essential ingredient in the art of cooking, and at any sacrifice should be maintained in the kitchen. All connected with cookery should make it the rule to be economical, to endeavour to make the most of everything. There is perhaps no country where the study of economy in the kitchen is more needed than in England. Here we must take the French for our example. A French housewife will, say, with 40 francs be able to supply the table for a week with every comfort and luxury, and in addition save something out of the 40 francs, whilst the English housewife will hardly meet the wants with 40 shillings a week for meals of the plainest kind. The better a cook the more economy he will practise : this is one reason why there is more waste among the poor and middle classes, where the cooking is done by so-called plain cooks, who are ignorant of the art of cookery. These will throw away what an educated cook will turn into a seasonable dish. Time, however, will mend these wants, for already the schools have taken up the education of cookery, so that ere long children will learn as a part of their elementary education how to cook with economy. A little forethought in these matters will soon show the real meaning of economy. Scraps of meat or fish, fag- ends of bacon, so often wasted, with a little judicious management make, when re-dressed in a different form to what they were first served, tasty little dishes, which improve the api earance of the table with very little extra cost. i) O

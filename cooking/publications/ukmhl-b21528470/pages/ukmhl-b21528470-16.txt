ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION. In issuing the Second Edition of this book I desire to express my best thanks for the manner in which it has been received by the Catering Fraternity, as well as others interested in the Art of Cookery. With the view of increasing its general utility the work has undergone careful revision. I wdsh also to assure my readers that I will not relax my endeavours to improve the work, by including any novelties and improvements in the Art which may come under my notice. % C. H. S.

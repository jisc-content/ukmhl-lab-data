GASTRONOMY IN THE FORM OF AN APHORISM 53 “ The dinner-table is the only place where one does not feel weary during the first hour.” “ May we be satisfied with the happiness we have if we cannot obtain the pleasure we want.” “The discovery of a new dish is far more important to humanity than the discovery of a new star.” “ The glutton and drunkard do not know the mean- ing of eating and drinking.” “ The classification of eating goes from heaviness to lightness.” “ The order of drinking goes from the light to heavy.” “ It is heresy to assert that it is wrong to change wines; the tongue is satisfied with the third glass, but after the third glass the taste for wine is blunted.” “A dessert without cheese is like a girl without eyes.” “ Punctuality is an indispensable quality of a cook, and should be sacred to the guests.” “ To wait long for a delayed guest is an offence to those who arrived in good time.” “To wait long for a late coming guest means rude- ness to the others who wait for his sake.” “Those who receive friends without having pre- viously provided for their meal do not deserve to have friends.”

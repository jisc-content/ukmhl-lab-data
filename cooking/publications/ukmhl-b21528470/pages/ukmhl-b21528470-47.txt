THE COOK AND THE KITCHEN 37 One of the great triumphs of the ancient cooks was to serve up a whole pig, boiled on one side and roasted on the other. The guests tried in vain to detect the place where the knife had separated the animal, or how it was contrived to stuff it with an oho composed of thrushes and other birds, slices of sow, hens, and highly spiced minced meat, the whole flavoured with a rich juice or sauce. These old cooks could with a vegetable counterfeit the taste of fish or flesh. It is reported that in an expedition against the Scythians in the winter, and at a great distance from the sea, the King of Bithynia had a violent longing for a pilchard. His cook cut a turnip in exact imitation of its shape, then fried it in oil, salted and well powdered it with the grains of a dozen black poppies, and his Majestyâ€™s taste was so exquisitely deceived that he praised the root to his guests as an excellent fish. This seeming transmutation of vegetables into fish is a great art, but in these days it appears to have gone out of practice; it might with advantage be revived, especially in countries where much cheap and wholesome food is lost or wasted, because an adequate knowledge of cookery is wanting. The ancient cooks sent almost to the ends of the earth for choice viands which were not obtainable at home. Those of Athens, for instance, procured from England their oysters, of which the finest came from the neighbourhood of Sandwich. Juvenal recoids

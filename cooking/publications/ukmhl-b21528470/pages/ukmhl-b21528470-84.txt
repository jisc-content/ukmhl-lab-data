PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 72 Mrs. Glasse is often referred to as the most old- fashioned and unscientific of cooks, but she, at any rate, steered clear of this blunder; whereas, Murray says: “ All meat for boiling should be first entirely covered with cold water.” One of the best authorities says : “If the flesh be introduced into the boiler when the water is in a state of brisk ebullition, and if the boiling be kept up for a few minutes, and the pot then placed in a warm place, so that the temperature of the water is kept at 158 deg. to 165 deg., we have the united conditions for giving to the flesh the qualities which fit it for being eaten. If you wish to rob meat of its most nourishing and wholesome properties, put it in cold water, which receives them, leaving the meat quite unfit for eating, even if it does make the water a foundation for soup —that is, stock! But if you want ‘ stock,’ it can be made with cheaper material than joints of meat intended for the table.” When meat is to be eaten, the albumen should be retained in it, for not only does it preserve the fibrin from becoming hard, but it gives to it softness and delicacy. The influence of boiling water upon albumen is well known. The best method of boiling meat intended for food is to introduce it into boiling water ; if the boiling be kept up for five minutes, and then so much cold water be added as to reduce the temperature to 165 deg., and the whole retained at this temperature long enough, all the conditions are united which give to the flesh the quality best adapted for its use as

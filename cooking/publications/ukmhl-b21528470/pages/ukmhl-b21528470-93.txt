81 Notes on Broiliag and Grilling. This is a process in general favour with both cooks and physicians, as it retains in the meat the more nutritious qualities and flavour, their evaporation and exhalation being prevented by the sudden closing to- gether of the fibres, or, in other words, the hardening and browning of the surface. The gridiron, kept always in a perfectly clean condition, should be made hot and previously rubbed with a piece of clean fat to prevent scorching, and thereby disfiguring the appearance of the food ; and the fire, where coal or coke is used, should be clear and bright. The great art lies in suiting the time' of cooking and the number of turns to the size, thickness, and general character of the meat you have to broilâ€” a beefsteak, for instance, requiring more frequent turning than a mutton chop, and a pork chop requiring a longer time for its broiling than a steak.

But, above everything, take care not to pinch the meat in turning, or the juices will run out, and much of the flavour be lost. At the first cut from a well-cooked steak or chop, especially a steak, the gravy should burst forth. The value of the gridiron is, perhaps nowhere better known than in England, especially in

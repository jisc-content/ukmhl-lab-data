An ingenious cook may form varieties as endless as a musician with his instrument or as a painter with his colours. The study of cookery books, their rules and recipes, are of little use unless the practising party has the natural gift for perfect cookery. To arrive at perfection in culinary art means to be able to make a perfect sauce, and a ccok who is proficient in sauce-making must possess the most delicate skill for roasting. To merely make up a dish from a recipe is in comparison like dispensing from a prescription.

29 THE ART OF COOKERY fat hog for three shillings and fourpence, and a fat sheep for one shilling and twopence. In those halcyon days twenty eggs could be bought for a penny, you could indulge in a swan for fourpence, and wash the banquet down with ale at three halfpence the gallon ! Amongst the dishes of the middle ages we find mention, in a catalogue of extras suitable for a grand and formal repast, of “ an umble pie.” This dish, provided for those “ below the salt,” was composed of the “ umbles,” or entrails, of the deer, and anti- quaries claim to have found in it the origin of the colloquial phrase of to-day— “ to eat humble pie.” But it is among the ancients that we must look for the really heroic days of feasting and eating. In quite early time the appetite seems to have been simply voracious, unstimulated as it was by the refinements of luxury to which the Romans attained. Theogenes and Milo are both credited with having devoured an ox at a single sitting; Astydamas of Miletus ate for supper portions quite as large ; Canubis, of Lydia, is not the only potentate believed to have been guilty of cannibalism. To come to later times, Fuller relates the case of one Nicholas Wood who, in providing for a feast, was considered a culinary artist, and rose in importance. To be indifferent to the description of food served up was to wound this personage in his tenderest feelings. The Duke of Wellington lost the services of a good chef for no other reason than that he was careless regarding the quality of his meals. “ I cannot stay with him,” said the wounded artist.

The nerves in the lower skin are the nerves of taste, and probably are set into vibration by the substance tasted, very much as the exquisitely sensitive nerves of the ear by sound. At all events the sense is conveyed to the brain, where we involuntarily distinguish between pleasant and disagree- able tastes. The nerves, moreover, of the tongue are not all alike.

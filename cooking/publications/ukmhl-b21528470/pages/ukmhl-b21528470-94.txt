PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 82 relation to chops, steaks, kidneys, the blade-bone, or even a small shoulder of mutton, all of which may be sent to table in the highest perfection from a clear fire managed by careful and competent hands; although it is still not so widely appreciated as it deserves to be in the preparation of many a small dish of fish, fowl, and meat or hone, to say nothing of a grilled mushroom, either alone or as an accompaniment to any of them. Notes on Salads and Salad Dressing. Salads are now, as they were a couple of hundred years ago, composed of certain pot-herbs, to which are added various aromatic odoriferous herbs or fournitures, as the French call them, which greatly add to the zest of the mixture. There are about twelve of these herbcs de fourniture, namely, garden-cress, watercress, chervil, chives, scallions or green onions, tarragon, pimpernel or burnet, parsley, hartshorn, sweet basil, purslane, fennel, and young balsam. Cresses are wholesome and anti- scorbutic, chervil is a purifier, chives a stimulant, tar- ragon stomachic and corroborant, while parsley is carminative, and the remaining herbs are all pronounced by L&rnery in his “ Traite des Aliments ” to have medicinal virtues.

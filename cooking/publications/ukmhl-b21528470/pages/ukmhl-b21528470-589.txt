SAUCES, &c. Sauce for Mutton Cutlets.—Stew in half a pint of gravy (made with half a teaspoonful of Liebig Company’s extract) one dozen button mushrooms chopped, half a bay-leaf, a sprig of parsley, and half a shallot, shred finely ; thicken with butter, rolled in flour, take out the bay-leaf, and add salt and pepper.

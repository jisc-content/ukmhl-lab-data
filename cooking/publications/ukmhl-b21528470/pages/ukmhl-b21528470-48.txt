PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 38 that the epicure Montanus could tell by his first bite at an oyster whether it was English or not. “ Man is a cooking animal.” Such was the defini- tion of the human species which Boswell on a certain occasion gave to Edwin Burke. “ The beasts,” continued Boswell, “have memory, judgment, and all the faculties and passions of our own mind in a certain degree, but no beast is a cook.” Would that we could supplement that dictum of old Dr. Johnson’s trumpeter by saying that the reverse holds true. But what man is there who can lay his hand on his heart and solemnly declare that something in the above is not true ? What one of us is there who has not had cause to anathematise his cook, and in a moment of righteous wrath felt a fiendish desire to inflict upon that functionary the doom of Richard Rose, the Bishop of Rochester’s murderous cook, who was “ boiled ” to death at Smithfield ? Who shall say what stupendous issues in the world’s history have not turned upon good or bad cookery ? Most of us have heard of the famous black broth of Sparta, but few know, or are familiar with, its origin. “ I am not astonished,” exclaimed a native of Sybaris (the Pares of the Greek gourmand), after tasting it, “ that you Spartans are so fearless of death on the battle-field, since anyone in his senses would rather die than be compelled to live on such execrable food.” Bad cooking, then, may have been responsible for the Spartan courage.

PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 52 Gastronomy in the Form of an Aphorism.* “ The world is nothing without the life, and all that lives requires nourishment.” “ Animals devour, the man eats ; the educated man alone eats with consciousness.” , 11 The fate of the nations depends upon their food.” “ Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you who you are.” “ The Creator has imposed the obligation of eating to human beings to enable them to live ; thus are we invited through the appetite and rewarded by the enjoyment of taste.” “To be a gourmet or epicure means to intimate the faculty of judging in eating, by which pleasant- tasting dishes obtain the preference to others which do not possess that peculiar qualification.” “ The delight of the dining-table appertains to all ages, positions, all nations, and all the days of the year, and will remain thus until the end, in order to comfort and console us for the loss of the less needful pleasures.” * Translation from Brillat-Savarin’s Thijiiologie, chi Gotit.

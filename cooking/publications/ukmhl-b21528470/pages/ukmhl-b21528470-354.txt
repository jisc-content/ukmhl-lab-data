PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 342 The size of these cards was gradually diminished, and, as they became smaller, larger numbers were placed at the table, so that at this time each guest is provided with a printed menu card. To set up a menu is an art, and, whatever may be said to the contrary, the style of it adds much to the popularity of a dinner. It gives one, as it were, a foretaste of the chefs ability, and a confidence is consequently inspired. This is, no doubt, as important to a successful issue as is the faith in a doctor’s nostrums. Modern menus, as a rule, are much prettier got up than those of olden times. In the matter of material for menus, white paper is mostly used, but more expensive material is much used also. I have seen some made of silk, papier-mache ; some in the form of shells, books, almanacks, cigars, cigarettes, matchboxes, newspapers, maps, post-cards, bank-notes, blank covers, envelopes, &c. Menus in the shape of envelopes are particularly pretty, and now very much in favour. One takes the form of a small, delicately-coloured envelope of thin cardboard, decorated with gold; the flap is engraved with a motto, crest, name of host or hostess, some flowers, or a knife and fork crossed and a sprig of herbs; the post-mark is “ Bon Appetit.” On the address side is a stamp in gold, with some gastronomic design, and a post-mark bearing the name of the place where the meal is given, with the respective date and name of the diner. The enclosure is, of course, the menu itself. Hand-painted menus on paper, parchment, and satin are in great favour in all Society circles. Some of the newest have a miniature of the host or hostess painted in the centre, and are occasionally the work of noted artists.

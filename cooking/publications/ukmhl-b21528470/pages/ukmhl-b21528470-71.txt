EATING AND DRINKING AMONG THE TURKS 59 find delicious. Turkish pastry is quite varied, arid would not be disagreeable if honey and sugar were not used so abundantly, and if the taste of tallow could be excluded. Bakalciva and ebmek hataif (thick cakes in honey, perfumed with rose-water and covered with caimak, a kind of cream), in particular, recall very savoury memories. Pachas and rich Turks always have at their repasts a great number of dishes, which the servants bring in on brass platters, and place on the mat on the door, or sometimes on small low tables around which the guests squat. They eat in a grave manner, and help themselves generally with their fingers as well as with forks, and with their teeth as well as with their knives. Nevertheless, they deign to use a spoon to convey to their mouths food that is not very solid, like stewed rice, maleby (a kind of cooked cream), and iaourt (thick and bitterish milk), all of which they are very fond of. Their drink consists of clear water, but this does not prevent them from imbibing before their repast a white liquor, raki, which is made of the gum of the mastic-tree mixed with alcohol. It is an agreeable drink, but it is used like absinthe, the taste and properties of which it possesses. Its use, and even its abuse, does not bring remorse to the conscience of the Turks, for Mohammed has forbidden them to use wine, but he forgot, prophet though he was, to foresee the manufacture of raki, an invention more modern than his own. 4

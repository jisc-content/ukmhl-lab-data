FAMOUS CHEFS AND EPICURES 501 In the charming Parisian suburb of Neuilly, M. Suzanne and his amiable wife are now domiciled, in circumstances which make life worth the living. He is, however, by no means idle, for he still contributes valuable advice and instruction to the English and French catering journals, so that his own countrymen, as well as those on this side of the “ silver streak,” are benefited by the useful information he is ever ready to give. He is acknowledged to be a great authority on culinary matters; and as the author of “Egg Cookery” he has proved to be one par excellence on the treatment of eggs, for he describes no fewer than two hundred ways of converting them into dainty and appetising dishes. All those who have come into contact with M. Suzanne are agreed that he is one of Nature’s gentlemen, retiring and modest, even to a fault; whilst amongst his confreres he is “ looked up to ” with admiration and respect on account of his geniality and undoubted abilities. In addition to this, his personal accomplishments are of no mean order. He excels as a musician and an artist, whilst his work as an amateur photo- grapher is worthy of the most unqualified praise. He has indeed gained something like notoriety in this department, having at different times photographed such leading sports- men as the Earl of Bradford, the ill-fated Marquis of Hastings, Baron Rothschild, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar, etc. It was Suzanne who took the portrait of Fred Archer in his hunting-dress, upon the occasion of the visit of the cele- brated jockey to Melton Mowbray, where the Wilton family have their seat. This portrait was quite the rage at the time, and attained a sale altogether unlooked for.

PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 18 and for three years this Spartan regime continued. Happily for mankind and gourmands, the traditions of the French kitchen were preserved, even during this depressing period, and under Napoleon the art revived again. This was signalised by the publication of the first number of the “ Almanach des Gourmands,” which the late Duke of York called the most delightful book ever printed. The author and editor of it was “ Grimod de la Reyniere,” a quaint humourist as well as an able chef. This is what he says, amongst other things, con- cerning cooks and cookery: “ The finger of a good cook should alternate perpetually between the stew- pan and his mouth, and it is thus in tasting every moment, his Ragouts, that he can hit upon the precise medium so as to make him a competent judge of his dainty dishes.” It seems, however, that some did not appreciate these high-class French dishes as did others, for I note in the work entitled “ Antiquitates Culinarise,” which was published in 1791, that French cookery was called “ the art of spoiling good meat ” and “ the art of making bad meat eatable.” The Scotch at this time were, according to a writer, very conservative in their cookery and plain in their living. It is said that only their fish, oatmeal, and whiskey kept them alive.

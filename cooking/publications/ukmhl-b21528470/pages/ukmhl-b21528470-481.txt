THE DEFEAT OF COFFEE 469 COFFEE. How many writers have vaunted the good effects of coffee I Heroes, statesmen, and philosophers have bowed over their fili- gree cups; and Frederick of Prussia, Napoleon, Talleyrand, and Metternich have all acknowledged and felt the inspiration of the fragrant berry. There are various methods of preparing the infusion. The best coffee in the world is probably made in Paris ; though the very finest qualities of coffee come to the London market. The usual method of making the beverage in France is a. la Dubelmj, which consists in pouring boiling water on coffee placed in a porcelain or silver vase, colandered or pierced with very small holes. The first decoction is poured off, heated to boiling heat, and passed again through the coffee-pot, when a clear and exquisite coffee is produced. Not more than a full-sized tablespoonful of coffee should be allowed for each guest in making a small cup of coffee for after dinner. Here is a recipe of Dr. Roques’s for a cafe a la creme frappc a la glace. It is a delicious breakfast beverage during the summer heats. Make a strong infusion of Mocha, or Bourbon coffee; put it in a porcelain bowl, sugar it properly, and add to it an equal portion of boiled milk or one-third the quantity of rich cream. Surround the bowl with powdered ice. Coffee, it may be added, should be hot, clear, and strong, and, like every other good thing, should be taken in moderation. THE DEFEAT OF COFFEE. “The imports of coffee are steadily declining in favour of tea.”—Daily Paper. Alas, for Mocha ! well it may Look piteous and pout, For Tea is more than ever in, And Coffee’s going out. “ Dolteajam satis 1” Coffee cries “ ’Tis clear you will wrong go; You do not let your victims sleep, No more does Mr. Congo.” Said Congo, “ Coffee, you’re a fool, Your ruin’s past postponing; You’ve had your day, ’tis over now, ’Tis you that should be moaning ” (Moning).

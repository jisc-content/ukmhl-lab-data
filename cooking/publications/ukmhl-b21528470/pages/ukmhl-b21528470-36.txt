PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 26 Who shall say what stupendous issues in the world’s history have not turned upon good or bad cookery ? It has always been a reproach to the English that they are behind the rest of the civilised world in respect of cookery. A witty Frenchman once spoke of the English as “ a nation with fifty religions and one sauce.” I do not think they are as bad as that, and if there is still some reproach clinging to their nation in this respect, it is proved and admitted by competent judges that a first- rate dinner in England is, beyond all comparison, better than a dinner of the same class in any other country for the following simple reason, that English gold can buy the best cooks, just as it can purchase the best singers. The greatest cuisinier of his day, L. E. Fde, wrote as follows : “I will venture to affirm that cooking in England, when well done, is superior to that of any other country of the world.” There is certainly nothing in the French cookery to equal an English baron of beef, the noble sirloins, nor haunches, legs, saddles and loins of Southdown mutton. The principal articles of food, in the quality of which the French surpass the English, are poultry and veal; but such are the skill and science of their cooks that, with worse mutton, worse beef, and worse lamb than the English, they produce better made dishes of every kind.

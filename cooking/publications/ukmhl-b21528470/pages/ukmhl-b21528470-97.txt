NOTES ON SALADS AND SALAD DRESSING 85 arise ; but, from whatever side we examine the question of this seasonable dish, everything depends upon oil—good, pure, pellucid, nut-flavoured oil. That of the olive is to be preferred, of course, and for choice the Provence oil, as distinguished from the so-called “ Lucca.” Home- made salad dressing, it goes without saying, is better than that bought ready-made. A few not generally known items on the subject may be acceptable. First, you can boil your dressing, and so keep it, tightly bottled, for some time. Take three eggs, one tablespoon- ful each of sugar, oil, and salt, a small tablespoonful of mustard, a cupful of milk, and one, or less, of vinegar. Stir the oil, salt, mustard, and sugar in a bowl until perfectly smooth, add the yolk of the eggs, well beaten, then the vinegar, and lastly the milk. Place the bowl in a basin of boiling water, and stir the contents till of the consistency of custard. For aspic mayonnaise dressing melt a cupful of savoury jelly, then put it in a bowl, which place in a basin of ice water, mix with a quarter cup of vinegar, one tablespoonful of sugar, one scant of mustard, one teaspoonful of salt, and a pinch of cayenne. Beat the jelly with a whisk, and when it thickens add the oil and vinegar little by little, lastly a little lemon-juice, beating it all the time. This dressing ought to be very white, and will serve as an excellent salad dressing.

Their important posts were always held as situations of high trust and confidence; so that “ magni coqui ” (master kitcheners) have filled positions of consider- able dignity, in their time, in the palaces of kings and princes. William the Conqueror bestowed several portions of land upon these highly favoured domestics, the Co- quorum Propositus and Coquus Eegius. Robert Argillon, a cook, had a manor bestowed on him for the services he rendered. Domesday’s Book refers to this honour as follows :— “ Robert Argillon holdeth one carucate of land in Addington in the county of Surrey by the service of making one mess in an earthen pot in the kitchen of our lord the King on the day of his coronation, called ‘ de la groute,’ i.e. a kind of plum-porridge or water- gruel with plums in it. This dish is still served up at the royal table at coronations by the lord of the said manor of Addington.” At the coronation of King George IV., Court of Claims, July 12, 1820, the petition of the Arch- bishop of Canterbury, which was presented by Sir G. Nayler, claiming to perform the service of presenting a dish of “ de la groute ” to the King at the banquet, was considered by the Court, and decided to be allowed.

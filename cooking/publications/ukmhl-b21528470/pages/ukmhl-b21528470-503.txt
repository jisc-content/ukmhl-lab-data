FAMOUS CHEFS AND EPICURES 487 ANTONIN CAREME, 1784 1888. Antonin Careme—or, to give him his full title, Marie-Antonin Careme was a chef of whom all cooks should feel proud ; for, as a French historian tells us, although he rose from nothing, having been “ suddenly deserted in his childhood by his parents, in an agony of destitution ” —yet he rose, by his own magni- ficent talents, from the lowest condition to the highest, to be one of the greatest of chefs and to administer to the tastes and bodily requirements of Talleyrand, Rothschild, the Emperor Alexander of Russia, our King George the Fourth, and many others. “ The name of Careme,” says Larousse, in his “ Dictionnaire Universelle,” “has become proverbial to designate, in a manner, the ideal of a perfect cook.

But what am I saying? Is it fitting for a man of lalent to enjoy in peace the fruit of his mental labours ? Have I not had a pitiable experience of it.' O vicissitude! 0 ignorance ! 0 Laguipiere, infamous calumny has indeed surrounded thee with tribulation—on ac- count of which thou hast been forced to quit thy beautiful country, and go to Serve, in Italy, a powerful man for whom you recently made delicacies in the Elys6e-Bourbon. Thou hast followed thy king into Russia ; but, alas ! by a, most deplorable fatality amongst military pomps, thou hast perished ; thy hands and feet frozen by the frightful climate of the north. You were compelled to sit without moving behind the carriage of your king, longing to quit this murderous land ; but, alas 1 implacable

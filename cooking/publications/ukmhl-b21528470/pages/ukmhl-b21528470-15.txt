PREFACE The object of this book is to present* to the reader an Oracle of Gastronomy; a culinary guide for every- day reference; a vocabulary of English and foreign terms used in cookery ; as well as a collection of epigrams and quotations bearing on the art; and a few historical sketches relating to it. I therefore trust that it will prove a help to advocates of the School of French Cookery, a gastronomic treat to the gourmet, a valuable book of reference for hotel proprietors, managers, aud chefs, as well as for ladies who manage their own estab- lishments ; and that it may be found useful and accept- able to all householders. I have spared no pains to render this work as com- plete and accurate, and “ up to date,” as possible ; but, as new dishes and new ideas in regard to culinary preparations are coming to light almost daily, I cannot claim for my book that it is a complete and exhaustive treatise, although I have endeavoured as far as possible to make it one. I shall therefore always be thankful to any of my readers who may notify to me any errors or omissions which they may detect on its perusal. I also desire to thank the very able reader at Messrs. Spottiswoode & Co.’s (the Printers of the latter part of this work) for very many valuable suggestions. Chateau, Vevey : February 1892.

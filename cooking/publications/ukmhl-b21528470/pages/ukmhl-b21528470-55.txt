THE COOK AND THE KITCHEN 45 instruments in the hands of the best professors without their being in tune would be insipid. A good cook, besides being versed in the technique of the kitchen, should also be a good judge of the kinds, qualities, and uses of every dietary article. The old Greek comic poet Dionysius says :— “To roast some beef, to carve with neatness, To boil up sauces, and to blow the fire, Is anybody’s task ; he who does this Is but a seasoner and a broth-maker. A cook is quite another thing. His mind Must comprehend all facts and circumstances, Where is the place, and what the time of supper ; Who are the guests, and who the entertainer ; _ What fish lie ought to buy, and where he ought to buy it,” etc. “ A cook can be made, whilst a roaster is born.” These were the words of Brillat-Savarin.

It is easier to compose an operatic piece than to invent a new dish, and even man who has the natural endowments would find it more easy to qualify himself to compete with the Royal Academicians than with the chief operators in cookery. In confirming these facts we cannot do better than follow the quotations of the Marquis de Cussy, who re- modelled the aphorism of Brillat-Savarin, thus :— “ On devient cuisinier ; On devient rotisseur; t)n unit saucier. ’

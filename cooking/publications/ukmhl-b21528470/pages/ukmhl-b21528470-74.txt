62 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 11. Slices of sera-fisli and sharks’ fins, with bamboo and mushrooms. It was hard to tell what kind of a dish it was, hut it was rather bad than good. 12. Giblets of poultry with morels. The morels helped the giblets down. 13. Ham and cabbage. Not very good. 14. Ham of sucking pigs, cooked in their own juice. A pause now ensued, during which pipes and tobacco were brought in. The pipes held about a thimbleful of tobacco—enough for two or three puffs—and we were kept busy filling and lighting them. 15. Land-turtles, with their eggs, in castor oil. 16. Ends of ham. Good. 17. Breast of fowl, with sour cabbage. No delicacy. 18. Stale eggs (these eggs had been kept one month in salt and two months in moist earth). The whites looked like burned sugar, and were transparent. The yolks had a greenish colour, and the embryos appeared dark, rolled together, and perfectly recognisable. Dessert: Conserve of sitzon, a red fruit that looks like a shadberry, and tastes like a currant. Good. The only drink was tea, very weak and without sugar, and Jamion, a rice wine, which is drunk hot like tea, and is wretched stuff.

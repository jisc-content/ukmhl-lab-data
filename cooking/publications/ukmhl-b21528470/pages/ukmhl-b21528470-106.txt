94 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY Etiquette for serving Hors-d’oeuvre, &c. There are a number of Hors-d’oeuvre, as well as other eatables, that may be taken at the dinner table without the aid of either knife, fork, or spoon—for instance: Olives, to which a fork should never he applied. Sandiviches. They should never be cut too large. Asparagus, whether hot or cold. Lettuce, which should be dipped in the dressing or a little salt. Celery, which may be placed on the table beside the plate. Bread, Toast, Tarts, Small Calces, <£c. Fruits of all kinds except preserves, which are eaten with a spoon ; melons and pines are eaten with fruit knives, and often apples and pears. Cheese is in some cases eaten with the fingers, even by the most particular gourmets. Either the leg or other small pieces of a bird may be picked with the fingers. Ladies at most of the fashionable tables pick small pieces of chicken, without using knife or fork.

We may live without poetry, music, and art; We may live without conscience, and live without heart ; We may live without friends ; we may live without books ; But civilised man cannot live without cooks. We may live without books—what is knowledge but grieving ! We may live without hope—what is hope but deceiving ? We may live without love—what is passion but pining 1 But where is the man that can live without dining ? Owen Meredith.

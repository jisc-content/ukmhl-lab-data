Tho Roxburghe Club Dinners. ]59 Marquess of Blandl'ord, Lord Althorp, Lord Morpeth, Lord Gower, Sir Mark Sykes, Sir Egerton Brydges, Mr. (afterwards Baron) Bolland, Mr. Dent, the Lev. T. C. Heber, Rev. Rob. Holwell Carr, Sir Walter Scott, etc. Ac.; Dr. Dibdin, secretary. The avowed object of the club was the roprinting of rare and neglected pieces of ancient literature; and, at one of the early meetings, “ it was proposed and concluded for each member of the club to reprint a scarce piece of ancient lore, to be given to the members, one copy being on vellum for the chairman, and only as many copies as members.” It may, however, be questioned whether “the dinners” of the club were not more important than the literature. They were given at the St. Alban’s, at Grillion’s, at the Clarendon, and the Albion, taverns; the Amphylrions evincing as rechercM taste in the carte, as the club did in their vellum reprints. Of these entertainments some curious details have been recorded by the late Mi\ Joseph Haslewood, one of the members, in a MS. en- titled, “ Roxburghe Revels; or, an Account of the Annual Dis- play, culinary and festivous, interspersed incidentally with Mat- ters of Moment or Merriment.” This MS. was, in 1833, pur- chased by the Editor of the Athenccum, and a selection from its rarities was subsequently printed in that journal. Among the memoranda, we find it noted that, at the second dinner, a few tarried, with Mr. Heber in the chair, until, “ on arriving at home, the click of time bespoke a quarter to four.” Among the early members was the Rev. Mr. Dodd, one of the masters of West- minster School, who, until the year 1818 (when he died), en- livened the club with Robin-Hood ditties and similar productions. The fourth dinner was given at Grillion’s, when twenty members assembled, under the chairmanship of Sir Mark Masterman Sykes. The bill on this occasion amounted to 571., or 21. 17s. per man; and the twenty “ lions” managed to dispose of drinkables to the extent of about 33Z. The “reckoning,” by Grillion’s French waiter, is amusing.* * Dinner du 17 Juin 1815. 20 200 0 Desser 20 0 Deu sorte de Glasse ..140 Glasse pour 6 .... 0 4 0 5 Bouteile de Champagne 4 0 0 7 Bouteile de harmetage 5 5 0 1 Bouteile de Hok ... 0 15 0 4 Bouteile de Port ..160 4 Bouteile de Maderre .200 22 Bouteile de Bordeaux 15 8 0 2 Bouteile de Bourgogne 1 12 0 (Not legible) 0 14 0 Soder 0 2 0 Biere e Ail 0 6 0 Por la Lettre .... 0 2 0 Pour faire un prune ..060 Pour un fiacre .... 0 2 0 55 6 0 Waiters . . 1 14 0 57 0 0

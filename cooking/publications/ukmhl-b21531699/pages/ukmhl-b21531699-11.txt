Gastronomy and Gastronomers No. 107 — 1834. Walker’s “ Original” No. 110 — 1836. Yarrell’s British Fishes No. 116 — 1837. Codes of Manners and Etiquette ... No. 118 — 1837. Portions of these Papers have been reprinted, with additions, in “ The Art of Dining, or Gastronomy and Gastronomers,” in Murray’s Railway Reading, 1852.

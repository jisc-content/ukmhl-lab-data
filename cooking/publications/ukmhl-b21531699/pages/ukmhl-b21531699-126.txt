110 Hints for the Table. Wines. Bukke’s reasons why the great and rich should have their share of wine, are amusing. He says: “ They are among the unhappy; they feel personal pain and domestic sorrow; they pay their full contingent to the contributions levied on mortality in these matters; therefore, they require this sovereign balm.” “ Some charitable dole,” adds he, “ is wanting to these, our often very unhappy brethren, to fill the gloomy void that reigns in minds which have nothing on earth to hope or fear; something to relieve the killing languor and over-laboured lassi- tude of those who have nothing to do.” Dr. Bence Jones has determined, by means of the alcoholometer of M. Geisler of Bonn, the strength of different wines : thus— Port varied from 20 7 per cent, to 23'2 per cent, b} measure.

The sherry is now stronger; the port is not so strong; the Marsala is weaker; the Rhine wine is the same strength; the brandy is as strong as formerly; the rum is nearly half as strong again; the porter is stronger, and the stout rather stronger than formerly. Young wine is red and bright at first, owing to the presence of phosphoric and other acids. As these acids become subdued, the colour is subdued as well, until all that raw brightness, in- dicative of immaturity, is mellowed and ripened into the rich, tawny hue—that mixture of glowing red and mellow brown, with the golden light striking through, which every one takes as his surest guide in his choice of port and red wines. Alas for his innocence! Even this may be counterfeited, and the tell- tale colour of immature wines be artificially concealed and meta-

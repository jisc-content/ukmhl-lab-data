1Tints for the Table. 128 can be procured; sprinkle about four ounces of either of the above powders upon the shoulder of the bottle, so as, gradually dissolving, to fall or run down its sides ; as the salt dissolves, the bottle should be gently turned in the mixture, and kept in it about twenty minutes, or half-an-hour. A decanter of wine or water may be readily cooled by folding round it a wet cloth, and placing it in a current of air. Artificial ice, made by the aid of an air-pump and other appa- ratus, has been found too expensive, and is rarely resorted to in India. Upon its first introduction into Bengal, the novelty proved very attractive; and a rich and luxurious native, it is said, expended 70(U. in the single article of ice, at an entertainment given to a European party. Sometimes wine is kept cool at table by fancifully arranging wet cloths round the necks of the bottles, over which is a kind of petticoat.

The stem should be hollow, and as it approaches the circular flat upon which it stands should be perfectly globular. As long as this contains any wine, a column of fixed air is seen ascending, and keeping up the sparkling action, not pleasant to the eye alone, but conducive to the flavour’ and cordial to the taste.

Pour in a pint of port wine, and stir it gently until it is on the point of boiling only: it should then be served immediately. The addition ol a strip or two of orange-rind cut extremely thin, gives to this beverage the flavour of bishop. In France, light claret takes the place of port wine in making it, and the better kinds of vim du pays are very palatable thus prepared: Water, 1J wineglassful; spice, quarter of an ounce, of which fine cloves twenty-four, and of remainder rather more ginger than cinnamon; sugar, three ounces: warm fifteen to twenty minutes.

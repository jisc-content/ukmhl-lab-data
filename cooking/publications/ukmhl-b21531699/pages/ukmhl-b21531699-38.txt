22 Hints for the Table. 1. Let not the number of tlio company exceed twelve, that the conver- sation may be constantly general. 2. Let them be so selected that their occupations shall be varied, their tastes analogous, and with such points of contact that there shall be no necessity for the odious formality of presentations. 3. Let the eating-room be luxuriously lighted, the cloth remarkably clean (!), and the atmosphere at the temperature of from thirteen to six- teen degrees Reaumur. (60 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit.) 4. Let the men be spirituels without pretension—the women pleasant without too much coquetry. (‘ I write,’ says the author, in a note, ‘between the Palais Royal and the Chaussce 3’Antin ’) 6. Let the dishes be exceedingly choice, but limited in number, and the wines of the first quality, each in its degree. 6.

If any one has been present at a party uniting these twelve requisites, he may boast of having been present at his own apotheosis. Lady Morgan has described a dinner by Careme, at the Baron Bothsehild’s villa, near Paris; wherein “ no burnished gold re- flected the glaring sunset, no brilliant silver dazzled the eyes; porcelain, beyond the price of all precious metals, by its beauty and its fragility, every piece a picture, consorted with the gene- ral character of sumptuous simplicity which reigned over the whole.” The crowning merit of this splendid repast appeared to he that “every meat presented its own natural aroma—every vegetable its own shade of verdure.” The accomplished Earl of Dudley said: a good soup, a small turbot, a neck of venison, ducklings with green peas, or chicken with asparagus, and apricot tart, is a dinner fit for an emperor— when he cannot get a better. Mr. Walker well observes: Anybody can dine, but very few know how to dine so as to ensure the greatest quantity of health and enjoyment. Indeed many people contrive to destroy their health; and as to enjoyment, I shudder when I think how otten

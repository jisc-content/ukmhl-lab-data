This Book is specialty adapted for a Prize-Book at Schools. “ Another of the valuable and interesting little compilations whereof Mr. Timbs is the most successful and ingenious deviser, is a volume upon the ‘ School-Days of Eminent Men,’ which is hardly to be regarded as a boy's book only. School-days interest us all, and Mr. Timbs has crowded his pages with matter in which even the learned may find acceptable bits of information. The sketches of the history of education in this country aro exceedingly suggestive.”—Examiner. “ The idea is a happy one, and its execution equally so. It is a book to interest all boys, but mure especially those of Westminster, Eton, Harrow, Rugby, and Winchester; for of these, as of many other schools of high re- pute, the accounts are full and interesting."—Notes and Queries. “The contents are exceedingly instructive and entertaining, and the whole book beautifully illustrated and adorned. It is an elegant and judi- cious publication, to which the man of letters will turn for reference, and the schoolboy, we hope, cling with assiduous desire to copy those noblest models, whose lives beckon him on to the sama eminence, and assure him of final reward.”—John Bull. “ Like Mr. Timbs’s previous works, this contains much that is not only interesting but much that is instructive also. . . . This is altogether a most amusing volume, and will be a most acceptable present to any schoolboy am- bitious of figuring in a future edition as one of England’s ‘ Eminent Men.’” Gentleman's Mayazine.

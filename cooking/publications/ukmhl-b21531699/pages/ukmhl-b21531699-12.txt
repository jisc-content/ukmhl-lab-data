THE FRONTISPIECE. Ortolans.—These specimens have been engraved, by permission, from Mr. Gould’s great work on the Birds of Europe. The Ortolan will be found described at pp. 72, 73. The Patent Elutriator, for Decanting Wine, is described at pp.124-7. THE VIGNETTE. The Cut has been reduced from the vignette to Nichols’s Biographical Anecdotes of William Hogarth, Third Edition, 1785. It represents Hogarth’s Invitation Card, engraved from the original, then “in Charles-street, Grosvenor-square, in the possession of Dr. Wright.” The illustrative note is as follows : “A specimen of Hogarth’s pro- pensity to merriment, on the most trivial occasions, is observable in one of his cards requesting the company of Dr. Arnold King to dine with him at the Mitre. Within a circle, to which the knife and fork are the supporters, the written part is contained. In the centre is drawn a pie, with a mitre on the top of it, aDd the invitation of our artist concludes with the following sport on three of the Greek letters —to Eta Beta Pg. The rest of the inscription is not very accurately spelt. A quibble by Hogarth is surely as respectable as a conundrum by Swift.”—Pages 63, 64.

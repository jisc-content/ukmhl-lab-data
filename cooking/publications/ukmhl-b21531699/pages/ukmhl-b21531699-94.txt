In June, 1847, he was entertained at a public dinner at the London Tavern, given by his friends and admirers, for liis philanthropic and dis- interested exertions for the relief of the poor. He left the Reform Club in 1850, and his first public undertaking was the agricultural dinner at Exeter. In 1851 he took Gore House, which he converted into a vast restaurant, under the designation of the Symposium; but by this specula- tion he lost 4000Z. After that he employed himself on his cookery-books, and in the Crimean war, where he only arrived a little too late.

Soyer was interred in Kensal Green Cemetery, in the vault erected for liis wife. She was a Miss Jones, the adopted daughter of M. Simoneau, a Belgian artist of some reputation. Madame Soyer herself was a painter, and produced some admirable works.—Abridged from the Illustrated Times, August 28,1858. Soyer’s principal works on Cookery arc his Gastronomic Regenerator, and his Fantropheon; these are two guinea volumes—the former hisSystem of Cookery, and the latter illustrating the Cookery of the Ancients, and the Classics of the Table. His Modern Housewife is an excellent book for middle-class families; and his Shilling Cookery Book is adapted for all classes. Of these works more than 300,000 copies have been sold.

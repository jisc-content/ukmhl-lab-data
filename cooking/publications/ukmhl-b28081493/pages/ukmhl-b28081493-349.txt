SECOND COURSE. 811 you to devote to it your personal attention; and being rather difficult to execute, be present when your cook makes it, that she may follow strictly the receipt, which I flatter myself is rather original. Take a pound and a half of lean veal from the fillet, and cut it in long thin slices, scrape with a knife tili nothing but the fibre remains; put it in a mortar, pound it ten minutes, or until in a puree, pass it through a wire sieve (use the remainder in stock), then take one pound of good fresh beef suet, which skin, shred, and chop very fine, put it in your mortar and pound it, then add six ounces of panada (made as under) with the suet, pound them well together, and add the veal, season with a teaspoonful of salt, a quarter one of peper, half that of nutmeg, work all well together, then add four eggs by degrees, continually pounding the contents of the mortar; when well mixed take a small piece in a spoon, and poach it in some boiling water, and if it is delicate, firm, and a good flavour, it is ready for use; if you require some very deli- cate, add two tablespoonfuls of white sauce, or even thick melted butter; you can vary the flavour by the addition of a spoonful of chopped parsley, eschalot, mushroom, &c.; the flesh of rabbit, 01 fowl, or hare, pheasant, grouse, &c., if plentiful, may be added, using the ingredients in proportion.

STUFFING FOR VEAL.-Chop up half a pound of beef suet very fine, put it in a basin, with eight ounces of bread-crumbs, a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, a little pow- dered thyme and marjoram, half the rind of a lemon grated and

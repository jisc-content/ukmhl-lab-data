SECOND COURSE. 335 744. CHOPPING OF HERBS, &c.—This may appear a very simple thing to do well, yet it is often done badly, by which the flavour is lost. They should be well washed and dried, and then take the leaves in the left hand, pressing upon the leaves with your fingers, and chop as fine as possible, not by placing the point of the knife on the board, and raising it and letting it fall, but with a good sharp cut, so that they are cut, not pressed. Onions should be peeled, and cut in halves length- wise, and then with a thin knife cut each half in slices, leaving them joined at the root; again cut into slices contrariwise, and then from top to bottom; thus having cut into very small squares, chop it with both hands with the knife. You may also wash them; when half-chopped, press them in a cloth, and chop them still finer. OF DIFFERENT SORTS OF PASTRY. The variety of pastes is to the pastry what first stocks are to soups and sauces, and must be very properly first described, particularly as it is here I must refer my readers for paste which is used for the hors-d’oeuvre and entrees - to succeed you must be particular in your proportions, and veiy careful in the mixing; for, although there is nothing more simple if pains be taken, so will the least neglect produce a failure, nor is it only with the makino- 0f the paste that pains must be taken, but likewise with the baking, for a°s paste badly made would not improve in baking, neither wifi paste, however well made, be good if badly baked; should the oven be too hot, the paste will become set, and burn before it is done; and, again, if too cold, it will give the paste a dull heavy appearance, but an oven properly heated (which can be readily known by a little attention on the part of those in the habit of using it) will give it- a clear brilliant appearance For every description of pastry made from puff paste, try if the oven is hot iy placing your hand about half way in, and hold it there about a quarter or a minute, if you can hold it there that time without inconvenience it would wo , 1 A ! en0Ugl1; buttlf you cannot Mse of the heat, the safest method d be, try a piece of the paste previous to baking the whole ; I apply these peTsot oflo t^ ‘l aH 7 friendS) but l,articuklA t0 uninstructed, as a person of continual practice cannot fail to be aware of the truth of them.

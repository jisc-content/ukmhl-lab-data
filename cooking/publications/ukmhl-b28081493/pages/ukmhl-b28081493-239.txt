REMOVES. 201 370. SUCKING PIG is merely plain roasted, stuffed with veal stuffing, but before putting it upon the spit it requires to be floured and rubbed very dry, otherwise the skin would not eat crisp: the usual method of serving it is to cut off' the head, and divide the body and head of the pig in halves lengthwise, pour over some sauce made ot the brains, and a little brown sauce, or of white melted butter, nicely seasoned with salt, pepper, and sugar; serve apple sauce separate in a boat, if approved of. 371. HIND QUARTER OF SUCKING PIG, (York shire Fashion.)—Cut off the skin, cover with paper, and roast before a quick fire about three-quarters of an hour; ten minutes before being ready, remove the paper and baste it; serve with gravy under, and mint sauce and salad. 372. SALT PORK.—Pork is salted in the same manner as described for beef, omitting the sal-prunella, but of course it does not require so long a time: a leg weighing seven pounds would be well salted in a week, as also would a hand and spring weighing about ten pounds, and either would require two hours’ boiling, putting them in a stewpan with plenty of cold water, and serving with carrots and greens, and pease pudding. 373. PIG’S CHEEK, (A New Method.)—Procure a pig’s cheek nicely pickled; boil well until it feels very tender, tie half a pint of split peas in a cloth, and put them into a stewpan of boiling water, boil about half an hour, take them out, pass through a hair sieve, put them into a stewpan with an ounce of butter, a little pepper and salt, and four eggs, stir them over the fire until the eggs are partially set, then spread it over the pig’s cheek, egg with a paste-brush, sprinkle bread-crumbs over, place in the oven ten minutes, brown it with the salamander, and serve.

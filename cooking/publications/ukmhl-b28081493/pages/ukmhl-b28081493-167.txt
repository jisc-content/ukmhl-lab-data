Of the round fish, the salmon is considered the best and most delicate in flavour, but varies considerably, according to the river in which it is caught • for there is no doubt but that it returns to the river where it was original^ spawned, and its time of spawning varies in different rivers.

Kerry, in Ireland, it is in season al the year ; yet in the Lake of Killarney, whose mouth adjoins that of the rra, it begins to be out of season in August.

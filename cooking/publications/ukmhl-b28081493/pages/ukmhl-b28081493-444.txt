406 CONVERSATION ON HOUSEHOLD AFFAIRS. but we will not talk of them now, our present business being of too great moment to allow of trifling away our time on such uncertain subjects.â€” Emilv is still in the country and daily improving. Thanks to your indefatigable perseverance, our culinary correspondence is drawing to a close; but I intend, when I return again to the farm, to write you a few letters of what a country housewife is or ought to be, as I under- stand Mr. I), is half inclined to purchase the small farm belonging to our old friend Mr. H.

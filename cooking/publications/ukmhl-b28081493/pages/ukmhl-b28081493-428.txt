DESSERT. 390 removes, but may be used for that purpose by being made three or four days before it is required. 930. SAVOY CAKES, OR LADIES’ FINGERS.—Have the weight of nine eggs of sugar in a bowl, which put into a bain-marie of hot water, weigh the same weight of flour, which sift through a wire sieve upon paper, break the eggs into a bowl, and proceed as directed for sponge-cake; then with a paper funnel or bag, with a tin pipe made for that purpose, lay it out upon papers into biscuits three inches in length and the thickness of your little finger, sift sugar over, shaking olf all that does not adhere to them; place them upon baking-sheets, and bake in rather a warm oven of a brownish-yellow colour, when done and cold, detach them from the paper by wetting it at the back, place them a short time to dry, and they are ready for use for charlotte russe, or wherever directed. 931.

Serve where indicated. 932. SMALL SPONGE CAKES.—Put six whole eggs into an earthen pan with half a pound of sugar, upon which you have previously rubbed the rind of a lemon, stand the pan in very hot water, keeping its contents well mixed until becoming rather warm, when take it from the water, continuing to whisk until quite cold and thickish, stir in gently half a pound ol sifted

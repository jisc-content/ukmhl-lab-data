PREFACE. Dublin; and will show the numerous imitators I have through- out the kingdom, which are yearly on the increase. I have also reproduced here the important Report made by the Board of Guardians of the South Dublin Union, which gives a correct account of food made and distributed; the number of people fed there, and the unprecedented saving made by the adoption of my system; as well as the extreme facility for the distribution of aliments daily given to from 15,000 to 20,000 people, without the slightest confusion,—a plan which I would strongly recommend to the public, especially at a time of national festivity or thanksgiving. THE GREAT CITY SOUP KITCHEN, VICTORIA STREET, FARRINGDON STREET. Food for from eight to ten thousand persons may he cooked daily by entirely new cooking gas apparatus, which has been admirably executed by Messrs. Smith and Philips, of Snow Hill. Having been consulted by the Committee of this unique Charitable Institution, to whom I gratuitously offered my services for the planning and designing of the Kitchen department, including the Refectory, and also the manner of distributing food for outdoor relitf, the whole of which is done daily without the slightest confusion or hindrance,—I proposed to those benevolent persons a plan which, if followed, would prevent starvation among the deserving poor in the great metropolis. This could readily be effected by daily collecting the waste pro- visions throughout the fish, meat, and vegetable markets of London; also, the surplus of club houses, hotels, and eating houses, the proprietors of which establishments would prefer giving in charity that which was before in general turned to no account, if assured that they would experience no trouble or incon- venience. The addition of three more such establishments would effect this very great desideratum, and would add much to the merit of the undertaking, though great praise is already duo to the Committee and their indefatigabl Secretary.

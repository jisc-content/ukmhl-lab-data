395 DESSERT. one of the most interesting sights which England alone, at the present time, can boast of. Not to tantalize your womanly curiosity, I shall, without delay, tell you that it was a juvenile entertainment, given by the liberal and inde- fatigable manager of the St. James’s Theatre, Mr. Mitchell, under the roo'f of which house he had the honour of entertaining the Crown of Great Britain, the blooming buds of the Royal Family, supported by the rising branches of the aristocracy, all with elegant bouquets, and possessing joyful faces, caused by the excellent entertainment the intelligent proprietor provided to gratify their infantine ideas. Nearly three hundred in number seemed to join their happiness with that of the Prince of Wales, Prince Alfred, the Princess Royal, and the Princess Alice, under the superintendence of her Most Gracious Majesty, and their august father, Prince Albert, who, in a homely and happy family manner, seemed, for the time, to have forgotten their mortal grandeur in joining the youthful happiness of those lovely children, who, in time, will be the ornament and pride of England. Knowing, by study, that pleasure and satisfaction of mind, in any state of life, increase or create appetite, especially upon children, on arriving at home, feeling rather tired, I lay down on a couch, and took a short repose; but being full of the pleasing sight I had just witnessed, and my imagination lately so involved with gas- tronomy, it caused me to dream that, by special order, I was to make a monster cake for the luncheon of those lovely children, which they were to partake of after their terpiscolyridramacomic festivity; to my ephemeral ideas, the cake was made, and the table laid in a vast room, where grada- tions of chairs and tables were erected in a demi-circle, at the top of which the branches of the royal family were gracefully sitting, and surrounded, according to rank, by the other juveniles ; the banqueting-hall seemed to me like the theatre, decorated all over with festoons of natural flowers; the dif- ferent tables were surcharged with every description of delicacy; fruit, ices, effervescent refreshment of all kinds were provided; every child seemed to be waited on by their noble parents, her Majesty leading them to follow her maternal affection. When grace was invoked, I was appointed to cut and distribute the monster cake, which, to my present recollection, was no less than four feet in height, three wide, and most beautifully ornamented with all kinds of bon-bons, small-fruits, pistaches, &c. Having reached the centre platform, where that supposed chef-d’ceuvre of cake was exhibited and gazed at by the widely-opened eyes of the youthful multitude, I was just in the act of raising the knife which was placed there for me to cut it with, when my liand all at once was seized, as if by magic, to prevent me from doing so. After a deep sigh, I awoke, and perceived it was my younger boy Raphael pulling me by the arm, saying, “Mamma, the dinner is ready!” Though much annoyed with the sudden disappearance of such a fairy scene, I could not find it in my heart to scold him for his innocent interference with my enchanted illusion ; but, as far as recollection serves me from a dream I

Xlll INTRODUCTION. Mr. B. Perfectly so, madam. Mrs. L. I have been talking to Mrs. B. about her system of housekeeping, ivlio was relating to me a conversation you had with a gentleman, astonished with its economy. I am also surprised, and should like to take a few leaves out of your most excellent book, if you will allow me. Mr. B. Certainly, my dear madam; in my wife, without flattering her too much, you see almost an accomplished woman, (in hearing such praise, Mrs. B. retired, saying, ££ How foolishly you talk, Richard;”) she speaks two or three different languages tolerably well, and, as an amateur, is rather proficient in music, but her parents, very wisely considering household knowledge to be of the greatest importance, made her first acquainted with the keys of the store-room before those of the piano; that is the only secret, dear madam; and this is the explanation that I gave to my friend, who thought it a good jest, and one of truth. I told him to do the same by his two daughters, which would not only make them more happy through life, but transmit that happiness to their posterity by setting an example worthy of being followed. I always say, give me a domesticated wife, and with my industry, I would not change my position for a kingdom; ££ Very true, very true,” was my friend’s answer, and we then parted.

Bifrons Villa, St. J IF , September 20th, 1849. Eloise, Dearest,— Please in your name, and also in mine, return our sincere thanks to our friends, and especially to the fair daughters of Albion, for the flattering reception they have given to our culinary correspondence, or gastronomic journal, with which I beg of you especially to couple that powerful organ, the public press, which in a few days, like the commotion of an earthquake, has shaken the domesticated nerves of thousands of housewives throughout the United Kingdom, merely to inform them that I, “ Mrs. B.,” and you, “ Mrs. L.,” humble but domesticated women, have had a friendly correspondence respecting housewifery in all its branches; the echo of which, believe me, Eloise, has done more in a few days, than half a century could ever have accomplished for us in our happy but obscure sphere; therefore you must not be too proud

381 DESSERT. If not able to obtain the best quality of sugar, it would be ne- cessary to use white of eggs as an assistance in the clarification, by putting the white of one egg in a basin and whipping it well with a pint of cold water; add half of it to the sugar, whipping it well in, let simmer, adding the remainder by degrees whilst simmering, and passing it through a fine cloth into a basin. The boiling of sugar is divided into seven different degrees, which may be ascertained by the following directions:â€” The first degree is known by dipping a copper skimmer into it whilst boiling, turning it over two or three times; if the sugar falls from it in sheets it has attained the first degree. The second is known by boiling your sugar rather longer, dipping your finger and thumb into cold water, then your finger into the boiling sugar, putting your finger and thumb together, and again opening them, it will form a kind of thread; if it is too weak boil a little longer; this is the most useful degree for fruit or water ices. The third degree is attained by boiling.,it a little longer, and trying it in the same manner; upon the thread breaking, should it form a kind of pearl, it has attained the above degree; the sugar in boiling would also be covered with a quantity of small bubbles resembling pearls. The,fourth degree is attained by boiling it still longer; dip a skimmer into it, turn, take out, and blow it hard, when the sugar will form little bladders and float in the air; this degree is called the souffle. For the fifth degree boil still longer, trying it in the same manner, but blowing harder; the bladders will be larger and adhere together, forming feathers; this degree is called la plume, or the feather. The sixth is called le petit easee, and is obtained by boiling the sugar a little longer: to know this degree, have a pint of cold water in a basin, into which you have put a piece of ice, dip your finger into it, then into the boiling sugar, and then into the water again, take the piece which adheres to the finger and bite, it rather crisp, but sticking to the teeth, it has attained that degree. The seventh and last requires great attention: to attain it, boil rather longer, dip your finger in as before, if it cracks and does not at all adhere to the teeth in biting, it is done, take from the fire, and it is ready for use for making any kind of sugar ornar merit.

FISH. 143 herring, but it is only by accident they are caught. Their freshness is dis- tinguished, like other fish, by their gills and brightness. As this fish is now of so great importance as an article of food, I shall refer more at length to it in my letters on pickling and preserving, and give you a description of my new plan of curing and smoking, and also what I consider its medicinal and other properties. 252. HERRINGS BOILED.—Gently boil six herrings about twenty minutes in two quarts of water, in which you are to introduce a quarter of a pound of salt; then have ready the following sauce :—put half a gill of cream upon the fire in a stewpan; when it boils, add eight spoonfuls of melted butter, an ounce of fresh butter, a little pepper, salt, and the juice of half a lemon; dress the fish upon a dish without a napkin, sauce over, and serve. 253. HERRINGS BROILED, SAUCE DIJON.— The delicacy of these fish prevents their being dressed in any other way than boiled or broiled; they certainly can be bread-crumbed and fried, but scarcely any person would like them; I prefer them dressed in the following way wipe them well with a cloth, and cut three incisions slant- wise upon each side, dip them in flour, and broil slowly over a moderate fire; Avhen done, sprinkle a little salt over, dress them upon a napkin, garnish with parsley, and serve the following sauce in a boatput eight tablespoonfuls of melted butter in a stewpan, with two of French mustard * or one of English, an ounce of fresh butter, and a little pepper and salt; when upon the point of boiling, serve. 254. HERRINGS BAKED BOULOGNE WAY. Take six very fresh herrings, scale them well with a knife open the belly about one inch, near the gills, remove the’ gills and the guts, with the exception of the crown or silver gut, which leave in; pull them towards the head so as not to tear the belly, wipe them with a cloth, but by * Dijon is the town in France so celebrated for its mustard.

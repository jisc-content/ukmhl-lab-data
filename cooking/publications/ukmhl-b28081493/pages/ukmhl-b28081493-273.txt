I select a small leg of veal as white as possible, saw off the knuckle a good length, with which I make stock for sauce, broth, or glaze, and serve the meat as No. 184, then with a sharp knife open the skin under the fat part of the leg, without cutting through the solid meat, then with the hands open the fillet, and lay it quite flat to extract with the knife the middle bone, then let it lie flat lengthway on the skin side, and by placing the left hand on the thick part, (which is called in France “la noix,”) with the knife cut two-thirds of it in a slant- ing direction, leaving from one to one and a half inch of flesh for the fillets (page 159); two fricandeaux may be made of the noix alone, two also of the part called the under noix, but it would destroy the fillets entirely. I then take a chopper dipped in cold water, and beat the veal with the flat part, so as to make it of an equal thickness; I then lard it.* You may not succeed very well the first or second time, but now I am quite an artist in larding, as is also my cook, whom I taught, it being so much like sewing. But should you not be able to manage it, you must send it to the poulterer, dhe remains of the leg make an excellent fillet for another day’s dinner. Having proceeded thus far, I then cook it, in the following manner: 410. I take a stewpan of a convenient size, and lay on the bottom six or eight thin slices of bacon, and place the frieandeau on them; I then take two onions, two small carrots cut in slanting slices which place round it; I then make a bouquet of ten sprigs of parsley, two of thyme, two of bay leaf, which I put in with LARDING, (How to cut the Bacon for it.)—Choose a piece of firm fat bacon not too thick, cut a piece crossways two inches wide if for lardino- fillets of beef or loin of veal; one and a half wide if for frieandeau or poultry; and one inch wide if for sweetbreads or fillets of game or poultry: lay it on the table with the rind under, press it flat, remove the lean part, then cut it in slices across four lines thick and as deep as the rind; when done, press them close together, then cut a slice four lines thick right through, drawing the knife from the handle towards the point, and proceed thus with all the piece, it will thus make every piece of bacon of the same size. Then proceed to lard as follows:—Having the frieandeau trimmed as l •°'i43i)’, ky i<; lenfert'iwise upon a clean napkin across your hand, forming a kind of bridge with your thumb at the part you are about to commence at then with the point of the larding-needle make three distinct lines across’

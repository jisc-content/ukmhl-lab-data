SOUPS. 127 Take four pounds of eels, well washed and skimmed, cut into slices of the size of a five-shilling piece, and half an inch thick; put into a stewpan a quarter of a pound of butter, melt it, add the pieces, and season with a table- spoonful of salt, a quarter of an ounce of pejDper, half an ounce of sugar, two onions chopped fine, a little parsley, a bay-leaf, half a pint of water; cover the pan, set it on a slow fire for about half an hour, without stirring it, then mix two ounces of flour with two pints of water, pour over the fish, let it simmer for twenty minutes, stir the stewpan gently, do not break the fish in taking it out. More or less seasoning may be added, according to taste. This soup, carefully made as above, is very inviting, and though meagre, very nutritive. 228.** ANOTHER CONGER EEL SOUP.â€”Get six pounds of eels, which skin and bone, save about two pounds of the best part to cut in thin slices, which put by until wanted, cut the rest into pieces, with a pound of lean veal, beef, or lamb, and a quarter of a pound of lean bacon; put in a stewpan, with two ounces of butter; two onions cut in thin slices, a little carrot, celery, one bay-leaf, two sprigs of thyme, four cloves, one ounce of salt, and half an ounce of pepper, set it on a quick fire, stir with a wooden spoon continually, until a white glaze is formed at the bottom of the stewpan, add three quarts of water, let it simmer two hours, skim, pass through a sieve into a basin, take a clean saucepan, and put in a quarter of a pound of butter, three tablespoonfuls of flour, place on the fire, and stir until oiming a white roux, let it cool a few minutes, pour the stock in, boil for twenty minutes, keep stirring, then place the pieces of eel in it and fifty leaves of fresh parsley let it simmer till tender, and serve.

158 FISH. Perch were known to the Romans, and those they received from Britain were considered the best. They do not grow to a very large size, four pounds being considered a large one.

Perch may also be served plain boiled or stewed as directed for tench, with sauce served separate. Tench are considered by modern epicures to be one of the best of all fresh- water fish j they should be caught, killed, cleaned, and cooked almost directly; they may be kept alive in a large bucket of water a few days, as also may carp, feeding them with a few crumbs of bread. They are very difficult fish to clean ; the best way is to form them in the shape of the letter S, and in-

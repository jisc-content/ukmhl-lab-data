THE NURSERY DINNER. 32 53. CHILDREN’S DIET FOR THE DAY.—Bread and milk for breakfast at eiglit; the dinner at one, which was composed as follows throughout the week: roast mutton and apple pudding, roast beef and currant pudding, baked apples; boiled mutton with turnips, after which rice or vermicelli pudding; occasionally a little salt beef, with suet dumplings, plain and with currants in them, or pease pudding; or if unwell, a little veal or chicken-broth, or beef-tea (the receipts for which will be found in the series entitled Comforts for Invalids).

Many persons will, I am aware, quite disapprove of this system of washing the meat, they would serve it as if it were for full-grown people, but you well know what would do for children as well as I—plain, simple, and wholesome food; I always earned out this system, and I now make my cook do the same. 56. Then the next day I would give them a small piece of mutton, plain boiled, with turnips, and apple tart;

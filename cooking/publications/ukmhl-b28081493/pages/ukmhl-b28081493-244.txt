rOULTRY. 506 â€¢wipe the inside with, a wet cloth, cut the breast-hone through on each side close to the back, and draw the legs close up; fold a cloth up several times, place it on the breast, and beat it down until it lies flat; put a skewer in the joint of the wing, and another through the middle of the leg and body; one through the small part of the leg and body, close to the side bones, and another through the extremity of the two legs. The liver and gizzard should be placed between the pinions of the wings, and the points turned on the back. When thus trussed, singe all the hair olf that may remain, take about one pound of stuffing (see Receipt), and put it under the skin at the neck, tie the skin under, but not too tight, or.it may burst in roasting; put it on to a small-sized spit, and fasten it with a holdfast, or hang it neck downwards from a bottle- jack; put it about eighteen inches from a good roasting fire, let it turn about ten minutes; when the skin is firm and dry, press into the bowl of a wooden spoon, so that it sticks, about one ounce of butter, and rub the turkey all over with it: when all melted, remove the turkey eight inches further from the Are. One of about six pounds will take two hours to roast, without pouring any fat over it. In case your fire is too fierce, and likely to break the skin, draw it back still more: it will, with proper care, be of a golden colour. I do not object to the gizzard being placed under the wing when roasting, but never the liver, which I cook in the dripping-pan, as the gravy which would run from it would spoil the colour of the breast. When done, remove it, cut the strings, lay it on your dish, and pour under half a pint of good brown gravy, or make some with glaze. Or, whilst the bird is roasting, butter the bottom of a small stewpan, pick and slice two onions, lay them at the bottom, cut the neck in small pieces, add half a spoonful of salt, a quarter

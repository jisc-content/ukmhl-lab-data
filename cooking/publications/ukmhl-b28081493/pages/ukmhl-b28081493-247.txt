209 POULTRY. with half a lemon, and put it into a two-gallon pan, and cover it with cold water, to which are added two ounces of butter, one ounce of salt, four onions, a stick of celery, one carrot, two turnips sliced, a large bouquet of parsley, two bay leaves, two sprigs of thyme; set it on the fire, when beginning to boil skim it, let it simmer two hours, or more if large; try the breast with a needle, if it goes in and out easily it is done; take it out and set it on a dish to drain, remove the string, serve on a fresh dish with a pint of good thick oyster sauce over it. By omitting the oysters in stuff- mg, you may serve the turkey with celery sauce, Jeru- salem sauce, tomato ditto, mushroom ditto, or good parsley and butter; and, as an accompaniment, a piece of about two pounds of nice streaked bacon, which has been boiled with the turkey, and from which you have removed the skin, and serve on some greens, or Brussels sprouts, over which you have thrown a little salt, pepper, and two ounces ot oiled butter, lou see, dear , that this dish can be varied without much expense and trouble; observe that this way, the broth is good for soup the same day’ by the addition of two pounds of veal cut in small pieces' a quarter of a pound of lean bacon, one onion, one blade o mace, one leek, a wineglass of water; put it into a separate stewpan, stew on fire till forming a white glaze then add it to the turkey when on the point of boiling- w ien done, skim off all fat, pass it through a tammy or cloth; you may use it for any clear soup by adding a little brown gravy or colouring, and also for any kind of puree • or by reducing it a little, make white or brown sauce’ adding to the last the proper colour. I must observe, that this will be almost impracticable when you have a Pa-rty; the only plan would be to get the turkey done one hour before you require it, keeping it hot with its breast in some of the stock; but, as the rot i will keep well in small quantities, it can be reserved for the next day.

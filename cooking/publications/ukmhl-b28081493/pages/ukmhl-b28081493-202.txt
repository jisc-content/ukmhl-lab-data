FISH SAUCES. 164 mushrooms in season there j and if at that period mackerel, or what species of mackerel have soft roes, as I think it probable that they entered into its composition, as an island- near Carthagina, where they were caught, was called Scombraria, and that which was prepared by a company in that town and which was considered the best, was called Garurn Sociorum. The Mwria was the liquid in which the tunny was pickled, and no doubt very similar to our essence of anchovies. Those most generally in use at the present day are the following; in addition to which there are various kinds made and sold in bottles, some of which are much cheaper to buy than to make. 286. MELTED BUTTER.—Put into a stewpan two ounces of butter, not too hard, also a good tablespoonful of flour, mix both well with a wooden spoon, without putting it on the fire; when forming a smooth paste, add to it a little more than half a pint of water; season with a teaspoonful of salt, not too full, the sixth part that of pepper ; set it on the fire, stir round continually until on the point of boiling; take it off, add a teaspoonful of brown vinegar, then add one ouuce more of fresh butter, •which stir in your sauce till melted, then use where re- quired; a little nutmeg grated may be introduced; it ought, when done, to adhere lightly to the back of the spoon, but transparent, not pasty ; it may also, if required, be passed through a tammy or sieve. If wanted plainer, the last butter may be omitted. 287. ANCHOVY SAUCE.—Make the same quantity of melted butter as in the last, but omit the salt, and add three good tablespoonfuls of essence of anchovies. 288. FENNEL SAUCE.—This is a sauce principally used for boiled mackerel. Make the same quantity of melted butter as in the last, to which add a good taoie- spoonful of chopped fennel; it is usually served in a boat.

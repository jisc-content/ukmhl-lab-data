THE AUTHOR’S PREFACE. Having, perhaps very ungallantly and ungratefully, nearly ruined my celebrated heroine, Hortense, and obliged her to give up her cheerful villa at St. John’s Wood, where for nearly seven years she so highly enjoyed the pleasures of an easy life, and caused her to reside in a small, though neat little cottage, and be contented with rural simplicity,—will probably appear a very great calamity, and a source of continual unhappiness ; but on perusal of the following letters, exchanged between her and her inseparable friend, Eloise, my readers will perceive that, contrary to their expectation, she is still happy and quite in her element; and more likely from her humble cottage to benefit the lower class, by teaching them the results of her culinary study, of which she gives us so fair a sample in this edition; and probably at the end of the year 1853, she may be able to give the world a very cheap work for the benefit of that class, who really require the most guidance with regard to the eco- nomical management of plain domestic cookery. And no doubt, by the addition of a small piece of land to her property, she will be able to give advice to small farmers and the pea- santry, on the art of rearing poultry, keeping a cow, feeding and curing of pigs, making of butter and cheese, management of a kitchen garden, &c.; where, I am certain, knowing her economi- cal disposition, she will grow almost everything useful, and convert her picturesque habitation into a model farm-house in miniature.

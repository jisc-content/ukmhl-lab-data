FISH. 140 the flavour is nearly the same ; choose them as red as possible, rather short, firm to the touch, and with transparent golden eyes. In cleaning, merely scrape them lightly, pull out the gills, and part of the inside will come with them, which is all that is required. Great surprise has been expressed at the number and cheapness of red mullet in the London market this season (1849); it arises from a circum- stance which, though trivial in itself, shows the necessity that exists for some means of giving instruction to fishermen, so as to enable them to prosecute their avocations with more facility and certainty; in no class of industry are the people that are employed in it so ignorant as in this, and it is the duty of a paternal government to see that the resources of the country are properly developed. I would have a person appointed to see that the food of our public institutions is not wasted in cookery (as I suggested in my former letter), and be capable of affording instruction by lectures or otherwise to the different classes who provide that food. The circumstance to which I allude originated with a well-known gentleman in the West of England, who noticing that the mackerel and red mullet arrived on the coast together, and that there was a large fishery of the former and none of the latter, endeavoured to find out the reason : he ascertained that the red mullet obtained its food from the mackerel, and, consequently, they swam lower; he therefore directed the fishermen to have a deeper seine net, by which means they will be enabled to take both kinds at the same time. As science and chemistry are now lending their aid to assist the different branches of our manufacture, I cannot see the reason why they should not do so in so important an article as that of food. 247. RED MULLETS.â€”Procure two red mullets, which place upon a strong dish, not too large, sprinkle a little chopped onions, parsley, a little pepper and salt, and a little salad-oil over, and put them into a warm oven for half an hour; then put half a tablespoonful of chopped onions in a stewpan, with a teaspoonful of salad-oil, stir over a moderate fire until getting rather yellowish, then add a tablespoonful of sherry, half a pint of white sauce or melted butter, with a little chopped parsley; reduce over a sharp fire, keeping it stirred until becoming rather thick;

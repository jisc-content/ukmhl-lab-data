SAUCES. 100 fuls of broth, milk, or water; boil, and serve under any white meat. 171. WHITE CUCUMBER SAUCE. —Peel two cucumbers, divide each lengthwise into four, remove the pips, and cut into pieces one inch long; add, in stewpan, one ounce of butter, a teaspoonful of sugar, half of salt, let it stew on the fire for fifteen minutes, then add a gill of white sauce, eight spoonfuls of milk, broth, or water, simmer gently and skim; add a tablespoonful of liaison, and serve where directed, but observe that all these garnitures ought to be served under the meat and over poultry. 172. RAGOUT OF QUENELLES.—Make twelve nice small quenelles, (see Quenelles,) warm half a pint of white sauce, in which you have put four tablespoonfuls of milk, and half a teaspoonful of eschalot; when well done, pour on them the liaison, with the juice of a lemon, and serve. A few English truffles or mushrooms may be added to this sauce, allowing them time to cook. 173. MAITRE-D’HOTEL SAUCE.—Put eight spoon- fuls of white sauce in a stewpan, with four of white stock or milk; boil it five minutes, then stir in two ounces of maitre-d’hotel butter; stir it quickly over the fire until the butter is melted, but do not let the sauce boil after the butter is in: this sauce should only be made at the time of serving. Melted butter may be used. 174.

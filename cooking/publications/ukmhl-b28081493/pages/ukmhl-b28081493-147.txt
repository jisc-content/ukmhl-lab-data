With a little attention, however, success is certain; and, once accomplished, there would be no difficulty in making anj icgetable soups or sauce, therefore it is very desirable to know how to do it properly. When done, pour two quarts of clear broth over them, set it upon the fire, and when upon the point of boiling, place it at the corner to simmer, until the vegetables are quite tender, (the onions especially,) carefully skimming off all the butter as it rises to the surface; it will require about half an hour’s sim-

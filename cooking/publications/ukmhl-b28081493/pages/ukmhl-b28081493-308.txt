MUTTON PUDDING.—Line a pudding-basin with paste, as directed in the last; then have ready cut into slices, the meat from two loin-chumps of mutton, which lay upon a dish, and season with a teaspoonful of chopped onions, the same of chopped parsley, rather more than half that quantity of black pepper, and salt in proportion; then put a layer of meat into the pudding, then a layer of raw potatoes cut into slices; proceeding thus until you have filled it up, but finishing with meat, cover it up as m the last, likewise tie it in a napkin, and boil, but lather better than two hours would be sufficient: serve as before directed. 535. LAMB PUDDING.—If convenient, procure the entire ribs of a lamb, sawing off the breast almost close to the lean part of the neck; the breast may be cooked as directed (No. 351); cut the neck into rather thin cutlets, which season lightly with white pepper, salt, and a little chopped parsley and onions; you have previously lined a pudding-basin with paste as before, fill it with the meat thus prepared, intermixing a few new pota- toes cut in slices, finish the pudding, boil, and serve as before directed. 536. VEAL PUDDING.—Cut two pounds of veal from any part of the leg into slices, about the size of the palm of the hand, and a quarter of an inch in thickness, put two ounces of butter into a frying-pan, and when melted lay in the veal, and a few slices of streaked bacon, season the whole with pepper and a little salt, add one bay-leaf, and a few sprigs of thyme; place the pan over a slow fire, saute the veal gently for a quarter of an hour; then take it from the fire, and leave it in the pan until cold, then have a pudding-basin lined with paste as before, lay in the veal and bacon, pouring the gravy over, cover, and boil as before, but an hour would be sufficient.

BREAKFASTS. 11 out breaking the yolks, season lightly with a little white pepper and salt, put a few small pieces of butter here and there upon them, and then set the dish in the small oven,, where let it remain until the whites become set, but by no means hard, and serve hot; if the oven is moderately hot, they will take about ten minutes ; if no oven, put the dish before the fire, turning it round now and then until the eggs are set regular. This is a most excellent dish. 19. OMELETS may also be served for breakfast with great advantage, being very relishing, especially the ome- lettes aux fines lierbcs, au lard, and aux champignons, but as they are considered to belong to the dinner, they will be given in that series of receipts. FISH. 20. HERRING- TOAST SANDWICH. — Choose a bloater for this purpose not too dry, which split in two, cutting it down the back; lay them upon a plate and pour a pint of boiling water over; let them soak five minutes, when place them upon a cloth to dry; then broil them very gradually upon a gridiron; when well done, which will be in about four or five minutes, have ready two thin slices of toast, made very crisp, butter them lightly, then take away all the bones from the herrings, lay the fleshy parts equally upon one piece of toast, and cover with the other; serve very hot. 21. TOAST AND EGGS WITH HERRING.—Pre- pare your toast and eggs as directed, (No 17,) but previous to pouring the eggs over, lay the flesh of a herring as directed in the last, and pour the eggs over that. Herring upon toast, with a layer of mashed potatoes over, is also very good.

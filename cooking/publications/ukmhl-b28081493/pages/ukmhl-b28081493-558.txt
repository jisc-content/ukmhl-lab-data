SOYER’S MAGIC STOVE, FOR COOKING WITH GAS GENERATED FROM HEATED SPIRITS OF WINE. N.B.—The boiler should never be more than half full. To charge the Reservoir G correctly, pour out the spirit which might remain in the boiler into the measure, which fill up with fresh, and return into the Boiler. Of course, if over filled, it is liable to boil over. A—The Lamp containing the Spirit for heating the Reservoir G. B—The Burner which heats the Reservoir G, and which should immediately be extinguished on the Spirit being exhausted in the Reservoir, otherwise it might injure the bottom of the Reservoir. C—The Burner which ignites the vaporized Gas from F, as it passes from the Reservoir G- D—The Filler of the Lamp A. E—The Ball. F—The Pipe which conveys the vaporized Gas inside the Reservoir G to the Burner C, where it becomes ignited. This should at all times be kept clear with the probe. G—The Reservoir containing the measure of Spirit for vaporization. H—The Rod of the Lamp A which connects it to the Stove K. I—The Flue of the Stove through which the Flame passes. K—The Stove. The screws must he screwed straight and air-tight.

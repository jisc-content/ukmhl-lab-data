SAUCES. 102 lay them on a cloth to dry; take the middle out of each onion, and fill them with veal forcemeat, (with a little chopped eschalot, parsley, and mushroom, mixed in it,) and put them in a saute-pan well buttered, cover them with white broth, let them simmer over a slow fire until covered with a glaze, and tender; turn them over, and serve where required. 178. HOT TARTAR SAUCE.—Put four tablespoon- fuls of w7hite sauce in a small stewpan, four of broth or milk, boil a few minutes, then add two tablespoonfuls of the tartar sauce (see Salads) in it, stir it very quick with a wooden spoon, make it quite hot, but not boiling; put it on a dish, and serve where described. 179. MEPHISTOPHELIAN SAUCE.—Do not be afraid of the title, for it has nothing diabolical about it; the first time I tried it was at Mr. B.’s birthday party, when some of his friends, having over and over again drank his health, till he had hardly any health left to carry him to the drawing-room, where the coffee was waiting, about eleven o’clock,— asked for some anchovy sandwiches, but, from a mistake in not having any in the house, I composed this ravigotante sauce, which partly brought them back to their senses. I cut up the remains of the turkey, rubbed some mus- tard over it, sprinkled a little salt and plenty of cayenne, put it on the gridiron on the fire, and made the following sauce: I chopped six eschalots, washed and pressed them in the corner of a clean cloth, then put them into a stew- pan with one and a half wine-glassful of Chili vinegar, a chopped clove, a piece of garlic, two bay-leaves, an ounce of glaze, and boiled all together for ten minutes; then added four tablespoonfuls of tomato sauce, a little sugar, and ten of gravy or brown sauce; boiled it a few minutes longer, then added a pat of butter, stirring it well in, removed the bay-leaf, and poured over turkey, and served.

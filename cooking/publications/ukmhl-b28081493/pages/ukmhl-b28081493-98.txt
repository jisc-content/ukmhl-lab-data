62 CULINARY CORRESPONDENCE. LETTER No. VI. Dearest Eloise,—I here enclose you the last receipt which I intend to give you for invalids. You may, no doubt, fancy that my diet is extravagant; but let me teach you that when we must pay the doctor’s bill, which I con- sider an extra and painful tax upon humanity, it is ours and their duty to try to restore health as soon as possible, and my receipts will, if well coupled with the science of a medical man, cause a prompt restoration to health ; and have the desirable effect of increasing the butcher’s bill by diminishing that of the doctor’s.

Behold, sitting round an inviting table four or five of those healthy and generally handsome faces of the young children of Albion, waiting, until after the usual blessing has been invoked by the eldest, with the greatest anxiety to know who is to be the first served, trying to open their eyes as Large as their appetites, at the disappearance of a cover removed by a clean country servant, who exposes to their view the immortal piece of roast beef, from which a most excellent exhalation escapes as from a crater of happiness, and -which seems to fill the room as wrell as the hearts of the whole party with joy ; and the yet greater anxiety of the still younger branches of the family, who have cunningly reserved their infantine appetites for the appearance of the grandnationaldisli, and more pleasing to their fancies,—the plum pudding, to which, for the occasion, a few spoonfuls of brandy have been poured on the

SOUPS. ] 16 square, but not too thick, and put them into the soup, which season with a little cayenne pepper; when the pieces are hot, add a gill of cream, and pour it into your tureen. The above quantity would make two tureens of soup, and will keep good several days, but of course half the quantity could be made. 20G. BROWN MOCK-TURTLE.—Proceed the same as in the last article, only colouring the stock by drawing it down to a brown glaze, likewise adding half a pint of brown gravy (No. 186), omitting the cream, and adding two glasses of sherry. If no gravy, use browning, and make a brown roux instead of a white oue. 207. MULLIGATAWNY SOUP.—Cut up a small knuckle of veal, which put into a stewpan,with a piece of butter, half a pound of lean ham, a carrot, a turnip, three onions, and six apples, add half a pint of water; set the stew- pan over a sharp fire, moving the meat round occasionally, let remain until the bottom of the stewpan is covered with a brownish glaze, then add three tablespoonfuls of curry powder, one of curry paste, and half a pound of flour, stir well in, and fill the stewpan with a gallon of water; add a spoonful of salt, the half of one of sugar, when boiling, place it at the corner of the fire, and let it simmer two hours and a half, skimming off all the fat as it rises, then pass it through a tammy into a tureen; trim some of the pieces of veal, and put it back in the stewpan to boil, and serve with plain boiled rice separate. Ox- tails or pieces of rabbits, chickens, &c., left from a pre- vious dinner, may be served in it instead of the veal. The ■veal is exceedingly good to eat Taste, before serving, if quite palatable.

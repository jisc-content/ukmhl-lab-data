PREFACE TO THE EIRST EDITION. Though I have fulfilled my promise by giving publicity to my receipts for food, which I have composed for the poor, it has been suggested to me by the benevolent, to publish a small pamphlet with the following receipts, which might prove useful to humanity at large, having the great advantage of being very cheap and easily made. I have also added a few simple receipts for dishes, which may be made at a trifling expense, by copying which, every labouring family may reduce their expense, and live much better than they have hitherto done. The best means of preserving health, with a due amount of labour, is to use a wholesome and digestive food, which, fortunately for her children, nature has abundantly produced, and has most won- derfully disposed the digestive organs of every individual to act in accordance with their peculiar habits. The mendicant eats with the greatest pleasure a piece of brown bread or potato, which acts more generously on his system than the best of food that could be placed before the greatest epicure with a satiated palate. Equality of trouble and pleasure are fairly distributed over the human frame in every class of society, but when entirely depi'ived of food, the greatest suffering acts upon it, and often makes a thief of an honest man, or a murderer of a civilized Christian ; for, on this all-important point, nature loudly speaks, and a strong appetite never jokes.

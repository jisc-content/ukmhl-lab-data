SOYER’S MODEL KITCHEN. From the Times, Sept. 28, 1847. “ To the Editor of the Times. "Sir,—The great interest you manifested in Eebruary last, when I made known my intention of erecting by subscription a model kitchen for the poor, was handsomely responded to by the public, and the scheme being considered by Government likely to be (at that distressing period) of immense advantage for Ireland, I wps requested to lay my plans before the Lords of the Treasury, and being approved of, I willingly accepted the invitation of erecting my model kitchen in Dublin, instead of London, as I at first intended. “ Having successfully proved that the system was of paramount importance, both as regards the large quantity of superior food that could be produced, and the immense saving that could be effected, the Government then purchased my model kitchen, and the South Union Relief Committee of Dublin have had the use of it ever since the 24th of April. “ As I am certain, Sir, that my subscribers and the public will feel interested in the result of my plan, the following brief statement will, I hope, awaken all local boards (if at all anxious), and adopt a system which mast save, on a very moderate calculation, at least 50 per cent, at any period of either scarcity or plenty. “ I leave to those who are better acquainted than I am with statistics what would be the amount saved to the ratepayers all through the country. “ Erom the opening of my model kitchen by me, on the 6th of April last, to the 24th, the number of rations of 2i lb. each was . 40,000 “ From the 26th of April to the 22nd of May, by the South Union Relief Committee, the number of rations, averaging 12,500 per day, was .... 300,000 “ From the 24th May to the 31st of July, also by the South Union Relief Committee, the number of rations per day, varying from 1,750 to 23,640, was . . 729,279 “ From the 2nd of August to the 14th, averaging 6,500 a-day, was 78,000 “ Making 2,868,179 lbs. of food, and of rations . . 1,147,279

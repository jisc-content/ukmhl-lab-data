Mr. B. and I have come to he so fond of rice, that we hardly ever pass a day now without having some on our table. When just boiled, drain it on a sieve, put back in a stewpan for a few minutes, on a very slow fire to dry, put in a little salt, pepper, and an ounce of butter; stir lightly with a fork, and eat it with meat, or any solid food, instead of potatoes: it is a very generous food. 67. RICE WITH MARMALADE. — Two nice chubby little girls, who live close to us in the lane, came unexpectedly to see me the other day; having nothing sweet to give them, I put into my rice, which was waiting for our dinner, instead of salt, a spoonful of apple marmalade—they found it delicious (you might use gooseberry, currant, raspberry, or strawberry jam for the same purpose); it was so simple and so good, that we have had it several times since with currant jelly. I cannot recommend a better pudding for Christmas than your No. 803. The following is an extract from the Analytical Sanitary Commission, as published in the Lancet, December 4th, 1852:— “ Soyer’s Sauce Succulente. — Purchased of Messrs. Crosse and Blackwell, 21, Solio-square. This sauce is thick, pulpy, and of a reddish-brown colour. It contains vinegar, a con- siderable quantity of tomato, wheat-flour, shallots, garlic, red- currant jetly, several herbs, &c. In flavour, it is exceedingly delicate and agreeable.” “ Soyer’s Relish.—Purchased of Crosse and Blackwell, 21, Soho-square. This sauce is likewise of a reddish colour; it is much hotter than the former sauce, and contains tomato, shallots, soy, &c., and other flavouring ingredients. No lead nor copper either in this or the preceding sauce.” NOTICE ON SAUCES. SOMETHING NEW. Soyer’s Aromatic on everybody’s table. ill shortly be introduced

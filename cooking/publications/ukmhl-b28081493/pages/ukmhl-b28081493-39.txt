3 BREAKFASTS. Yon will find this way a great improvement upon the old system, as often in cutting through four or five slices with a bad knife, you squeeze all the butter out of the upper one, and discover the under one, at the peril of its life, swimming in an ocean of butter at the bottom of the dish. N.B. The warming of the bread gradually through, on both sides, is a very great improvement upon the quality of the toast; it may give a trifle more trouble, but still it is quicker done, and much lighter. All kinds of toast must be done the same way, but if to be served under a bird, eggs, or kidneys, it requires to be toasted drier. Being in every way an economist, I generally save the remnants of the loaf that have become too dry to be eaten as bread, and by just dipping them in wrarm water, toast- ing them gradually, and buttering them, I found that they were eaten in preference ; but their being stale is a secret of my owu, which, if divulged, would prevent their ever being eaten after. 2.

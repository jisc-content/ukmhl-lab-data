104 SOUPS. SOUPS. In France, no dinner is served without soup, and no good soup is supposed to be made without the pot-au-feu (See No. 228), it being the national dish of the middle and poorer classes of that country. I think it might be of service to the working classes, as by it they would be oftener able to partake of a hot dinner, the advantages to be derived from which, in a cold climate like ours, I have already remarked upon.

The above will make a delicious broth for all kinds of

204 POULTRY. This is the best and most delicious of the various matters with which man furnishes himself as food; although containing but little nourishment, it gives a delightful variety to our repast: from the sparrow to the turkey, we find everywhere, in this numerous class, that which gives a meal equally as good for the invalid as the robust. Increasing every day in luxuries, we have arrived at a point unknown even to Lucullus; we are not contented with the beautiful qualities which Nature gives this species, but, under pretence of improving them, we not only de- prive them of their liberty by keeping them in solitude and in darkness, but force them to eat their food, and thus bring them to a degree of fatness which Nature never intended. Even the bird which saved the capitol of Rome is treated with still greater indignity,'—thrust into warm ovens, and nearly baked alive to produce those beautiful and delicious livers so well known to gourmets.* In London the poultry and game are sent in so nicely prepared for cooking, that any remark upon the method of killing, plucking, and drawing it, would appear almost unnecessary; but remembering the manner that I have seen poultry and game mutilated in some parts of the country, I have been in- duced to give the following simple directions. The Best Way of Killing Poultry.—Take the bird by the neck, place the thumb of the right hand just at the back of the head, close the head in your hand, your left hand holding the bird, then press your thumb down hard and pull the head and neck contrariwise ; the neck will break in- stantaneously, and the bird will be quite dead in a few seconds: then hang it a short time by the legs for the blood to flow into the head, which renders the flesh much whiter. In France they are usually killed by cutting the throat close to the head; both methods are good with regard to the whiteness of the flesh, but I prefer the English method, not being so barbarous. To Pluck either Game or Poultry.—Lay the bird upon a board with its head towards you, and pull the feathers away from you, in the direction they lie ; . many persons pull out the feathers the contrary way, by which means they are likely to tear the skin, and very much disfigure the bird for the table. * Foie gras dc Strasbourg.

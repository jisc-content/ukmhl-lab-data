XVI INTRODUCTION. be totally impossible; therefore I beg to propose (if you can afford the time) that you will in writing, give me the description how you lay out your breakfast-table, with the addition of a few receipts for the making of rolls and the other breakfast bread, which I so much enjoyed whilst with you; even how to make toast, and more espe- pecially how you make coffee, chocolate, cocoa (tea, of course, I know). And should this meet with your approbation, I will make a little journal, which may some day or other be useful to our families and friends. Until I hear from you, I shall be waiting with anxiety for your decision upon this important and domestic subject. [Remaining, dear Hortense, Yours very sincerely, ELOISE. LETTER No. II. From Mrs. JB , in reply. Bifrons Villa; Jan. 3rd, 1843. My dear Eloise,—In answer to yours, I agree, with the greatest pleasure, to contribute towards your domesticated idea, which, I must say, is very original, and may, as you observe, prove useful; but why should we confine our culinary journal to breakfasts only ? why not go through the different meals of the day ? that is, after breakfast, the luncheon; then the nursery dinner at one; and here it strikes me that in that series, we might introduce some receipts, to be called, Comforts for Invalids; even our servants’ dinners and teas; then the early dinner at two or three, for people in business, the parlour dinner at six, the coffee after dinner, and even suppers for a small ball or evening party; but all on a moderate scale, leav- ing the aristocratic style entirely to its proper sphere. To show my approbation of your idea, I enclose herewith the first receipt. How to make Toast.

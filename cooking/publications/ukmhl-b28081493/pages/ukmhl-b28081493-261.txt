223 ENTRIES, or MADE DISHES. Entrees are, in common terms, what are called made-dishes; of course, these are the dishes upon which, in the high class of cookery, the talent of the cook is displayed. Great care should be observed in dishing them up, fjr the eye is a great assistance to the palate : it often happens that the careless- ness of the servant destroys the labours of the cook, by the manner in which the dish is taken from the kitchen to the dining-room. In some measure to avoid that, I direct a small thin border of mashed potatoes, about half an inch wide and a quarter of an inch deep, to be placed on the bottom of the dish, which keeps each object in its place: they should always be served exceed- ingly hot. . MADE DISHES OF BEEF.—The remainder of any cookerl joint:* of beef may be advantageously and economically dressed m the following ways: 404. HASHED BEEF.—Cut the beef into small thin slices winch lay upon a plate, and to every pound of beef add half a tablespoon fa1 of flour, a little chopped onion or eschalot, two sa tspoonfuls of salt, and a half one of pepper, mix the whole we together, and put it into a saucepan, with half a pint of water, stir it over the fire until upon the point of boilin^ when set it at the corner of the fire to simmer for ten minutes- it t then leady to serve. A great improvement to the appearance by adding n few spcxmf„ls of brown gic y ( o. 186), or a teaspoonful of colouring (No. 187) which might always be kept in a bottle. The flavour of any kind ot hash may be varied, by adding a few sprigs of parsley or thyme butter the size of a walnut, and three small or one lar^e onion cut into slices; put it on the fire until the onion is browned ! add the meat, which warm on one side, turn over when ’ ** through, pour over it a pint of hot water add two niel-1 7 i*™ l™ cu‘ “ witl.Pa tabled

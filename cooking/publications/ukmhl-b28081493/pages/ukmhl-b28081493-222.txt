REMOVES. IS4 All tlie above joints may be stewed in the same way, with less vegetables, and served with sauces Nos. 13C, 140; the gravy in which they are stewed will always he useful in the kitchen, or may he reduced and served with the joint. 334. SHOULDER OF VEAL STUFFED AND STEWED. —This is a very awkward joint to carve to advantage, and equally so to cook; by the following plan it goes further than any other way. Take the joint and lay it with the skin-side downwards, with a sharp thin knife carefully detach the meat from the blade-bone, then hold the shoulder edgewise and detach the meat from the other side of the bone, being careful not to make a hole in the skin; then cut the bone from the knuckle and take it out; you may at first be rather awkward about it, but after once or twice trying, it will become easy; you may also take out the other bone, but I prefer it in, as it keeps the shape better; then lard the lean part like the neck in No. 328; mix some salt and a little mixed spice together, with which rub the meat from whence the bone has been cut, stuff with veal stuffing, or sausage-meat, or suet-pudding; braise, garnish, and serve as No. 310. This being the toughest part of the veal, it should be tried before taking up, to see if it is properly done, by thrusting a larding-needle in it; if it goes in easily it is done. This joint is excellent cold, and should be carved in thin slices cross-wise. 335. CALF’S HEAD.—Choose one thick and fat, but not too large; soak for ten minutes in lukewarm water, then wrell powder with rosin, have plenty of scalding water ready, dip in the head, holding it by the eai, scrape the hair off with the back of a knife, which will come off easily if properly scraped, without scratching the cheek; when perfectly clean, take the eyes out, saw it in two lengthwise,

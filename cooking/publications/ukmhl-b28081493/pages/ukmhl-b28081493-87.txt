51 COMFORTS FOR INVALIDS. Toast and Water.—The facility of making this popular drink is probably the cause of its not being -well made one time in ten, that is, in private families ; the bread is too much or too little done, or there is too much or not half enough water, or more or less bread ; I venture to say that if any person would take the trouble to go from house to house, where there are patients, and taste toast and water at each, they would not find two of the same flavour, and perhaps not any of it properly made. To make it to per- fection, proceed as follows :— 105. TOAST AND WATER.—Cut a piece of crusty bread, about a quarter of a pound in weight, place it upon a toasting-fork, and hold it about six inches from the fire; tom it often, and keep moving it gently until of a light yellow colour, then place it nearer the fire, and when of a good brown chocolate colour, put it into a jug, and pour three pints of boiling water over; cover the jug until cold, then strain it into a clean jug, and it is ready for use z never leave the toast in it, for in summer it would cause fermentation in a short time. I would almost venture that such toast and water as I have described would keep good a considerable time in bottles. The idea that bread must be burnt black to make toast and water is quite a popular delusion, for nothing nourishing could come from it: if your-house were burnt to ashes, it would be valueless ; and the same with burnt bread, which merely makes the water black, but the nutriment of the bread, in- tended to relieve the chest, has evaporated in smoke by being burnt.

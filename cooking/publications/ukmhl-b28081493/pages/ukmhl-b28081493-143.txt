SOUPS. 105 clear soups, and of course for thick soups or purees; by boiling it rather faster about five minutes before passing, you will be better enabled to take off every particle of grease from the surface. In making a stock of beef pro- ceed as above, but allow double the time to simmer-; mutton or lamb, if any trimmings, might also be used; if beef, use seven pounds; if mutton, eight; or lamb, seven, of course bones and all included; with care, this broth would be quite clear.

This is as I always eat it myself; but some persons may probably prefer a little parsley-and-butter sauce oi piquant sauce, served with it. Should auy of the veal be left until cold, it might be cut into thin slices, and gradually warmed in either of the before-mentioned sauces Should you make your stock from the leg or shin of beef, stew it double the time, preserve the vegetables i e in the stock, and serve with beef, or serve the beef with some nice sharp sauce over; the remainder, if cold mav also be hashed in the ordinary way.

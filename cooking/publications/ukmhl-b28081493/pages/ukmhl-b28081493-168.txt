130 FISH. 229. SALMON, PLAIN BOILED.—I prefer always dressing this fish in slices from an inch to two inches in thickness, boiling it in plenty of salt and water about twenty minutes; the whole fish may be boiled, or the head and shoulders of a large fish, but they require longer boil- ing. Salmon eats firmer by not being put into the water until boiling. Dress the fish upon a napkin, and serve with lobster sauce, shrimp ditto, or plain melted butter in a boat with fresh sprigs of parsley boiled a few minutes in it. A salmon weighing about ten pounds will require an hour’s gentle boiling ; a head and shoulders weighing six pounds, half an hour: the remains may be dressed a la creme, as directed for the turbot. 230. SALMON, SAUCE MATELOTE.—Cook three good slices of salmon as directed in the last, or a large salmon peal, trussed in the form of the letter S, dress it upon a dish without a napkin, having previously drained off all the water; put a quart of matelote sauce, No. 302, under or over it. 231. BROILED SALMON.—Dip each piece in flour, put it on a gridiron, turn occasionally; fifteen minutes will give it a nice pale yellow colour; it should be served with Dutch, or caper sauce. Cod. This fish, like the former, belongs to the northern parts of the world ; its flavour and quality, like terrestrial animals, depend greatly on its feeding-place, a few miles making a marked difference: it is exceedingly voracious. I have seen taken from a quantity of white-bait one only three inches long, having a shrimp an inch and a half long in its belly ; and in a large one, three haddocks, weighing, when taken out, almost as much as itself. It feeds also greatly on shell-fish, and seems to have a very powerful gastric juice. We obtain them in London exceedingly fine, perhaps more so than in any other town in the world : they are caught on the Dogger Bank, and brought alive in wells, by boats, to Gravesend, and forwarded to London

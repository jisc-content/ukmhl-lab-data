EARLY LUNCHEONS. 27 napkin before each person, with, cups and saucers for tea or coffee, at choice, small plates for rolls, and a size larger for meat, sausages, eggs, &c., a small knife and fork for each; the butter in a pretty freezing butter-glass, just covered with clear spring-water, and garnished with a few sprigs of parsley or water-cresses ; the cream in a small china cream-jug, and a larger jug con- taining hot milk for coffee; orange marmalade in its original pot, honey- comb, water-cresses, and once a few nice young radishes, which were excel- lent, although a little out of season; one day also dry toast was served, another day buttered, the next muffins, then crumpets, white and brown bread, and small rolls, thus making a continual change, but all so small and inviting.

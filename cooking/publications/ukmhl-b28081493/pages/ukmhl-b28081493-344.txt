SAVOURY DISHES. 306 but not boiling; then take it from the lire, and taste if pa- latable, place a cover upon the stewpan, which stand a little dis- tance from the fire, putting a few red-hot cinders upon the lid for five minutes, tie a napkin by the four corners upon a jelly- stand, through which pass the jelly, having a basin beneath to catch it, pour the first that runs through again into the napkin until it runs quite clear; when all through, pour it in a plain mould or saute-pan, which place upon ice until the jelly is quite firm; then dip the bottom of the mould in hot water, turn the jelly out upon a cloth, and cut it into whatever shapes you please, to garnish and ornament any cold savoury dish; the jelly when warm might be divided, one part kept white, and the other coloured with a little brown gravy or colouring, thus enabling you to variegate in garnishing. Should the jelly be required to ornament tongues, hams, pies, salads, or any article when no Galantine is made, then to make the stock, cut the veal into small pieces, and split the calf’s foot in two, put a quarter of a pound of butter in a convenient-sized stewpan, with the veal, foot, a small piece of lean ham, and the other ingredients as directed for Galantine, pour in half a pint of water, put on the lid, and stand it upon the fire until the bottom of the stewpan is covered with a white glaze; then add a gallon of water, let simmer three hours, keeping it well skimmed; pass and clarify as above.

COLD HAM.—Procure a very nice but small ham of about nine pounds in weight, which soak about ten hours in cold water, and simmer three hours in plenty of water; when done, take out and let remain until cold ; then cut off the skin as thinly as possible, but without leaving the marks of it; let a piece remain upon the knuckle about two inches and a half in breadth, which either festoon or vandyke, carve the fat neatly to form a shell, if you can, and glaze it over lightly, serve with a paper frill upon the knuckle, and garnish with savoury jelly, or if plain with a few bunches of fresh green parsley. A handlul of fresh hay put in the water when boiling is an improvement. 661. COLD TONGUE.—Boil a nice ox tongue for* three hours, and, when done, take off all the skin, and truss it of a good

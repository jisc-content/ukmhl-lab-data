4i COMFORTS FOR INVALIDS. ■white from the yolk, put the yolk in a basin, with a quarter of a gill of good cream or milk, which mix well with a spoon; have half a pint of broth boiling, which pour gra- dually over the egg and cream, mixing it (as you pour the broth) with a wooden spoon; it is then ready, and ought to be taken when going to bed, if only for a cold. 73. SWEET LAIT DE PODLE. — This is also reckoned very good for a cold. Put two yolks of eggs into a cup, with two teaspoonfuls of pounded sugar, a few drops of orange-flower water, or the eighth part of the rind of a fresh lemon grated, beat them well together for ten minutes, then pour boiling water gradually over, keep- ing it stirred until the cup is nearly full. Drink this very hot when in bed; I can strongly recommend it from experience. 74. RIZ AU LAIT, or RICE MILK, is a very favourite food, or soup; in France many persons make their suppers of it, even when in a state of perfect health. Proceed as follows:—wash a tablespoonful of good rice in water, which drain and put into a stewpan, with a pint of milk, upon the fire, and when boiling, place it at the corner to simmer, until the rice is quite tender, (for invalids it must be in a pulp); sweeten with a little sugar, and it is quite ready. 75. RICE MILK, {seasoned.)—Proceed exactly as in the last, but when the rice is quite tender add an ounce of butter, two teaspoonfuls of sugar, and a little salt, stir well together, and it is then ready; this must neither be too thick nor too thin, but about the thickness of well- made gruel. In France they always add a few drops of orange-flower water, but that depends upon taste. These last two are very nutritious, especially after a long illness.

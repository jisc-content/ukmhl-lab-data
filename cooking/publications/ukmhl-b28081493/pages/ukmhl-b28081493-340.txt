302 SAVOURY DISHES. 653. RAISED PIE OR FOWLS.—Make the paste and iorcemeat as in the last, but instead of veal and ham, bone a young fowl as directed for galantine, which lay flat upon a clean cloth, breast downwards; season the interior with a little pepper, sa t, and chopped onions; spread a layer of forcemeat over, half an inch in thickness, have ten pieces of veal, of the thickness of your finger, and the same length as the fowl, and the same number of pieces of fat bacon, lay half of the veal and bacon alternately upon the fowl, well seasoned with pepper and salt, cover over with more forcemeat, then another layer of veal and ham, cover with more forcemeat; then roll the fowl over, making the skin meet at the back; you have previously lined a raised pie mould with paste, then line the pie with forcemeat, half an inch in thickness, lay in the fowl, sprinkle a little pepper and salt over, cover with the remainder of the forcemeat, to form a dome, place a pat of butter and two bay-leaves upon the top, finish and bake precisely as in the last; when done, pour in a gill of gravy made from the bones of the fowl; serve cold. 654. RAISED PIE OF PHEASANT.—Proceed precisely as for the pie of fowl, but of course using a pheasant; an old one would answer the purpose if kept long enough, but all the sinews of the legs must be taken out in boning it; the fillets of the breast also, being very thick, may be partly cut out and used with the veal for the interior; if in a situation to obtain rabbits, the fillets of them might be used instead of veal for the interior, and the legs for forcemeat. For gravy, break up the bones of the birds, which put into a stewpan with a glass of sherry, an onion, a few sprigs of thyme, parsley, and a bay-leaf; let it simmer a minute over the fire, then add a pint of broth and a little isinglass or gelatine, let the whole simmer for an hour, giving it a nice brown colour, when pass it through a sieve into a small stewpan, place it again upon the fire, skim off all the fat, and reduce it to half a pint, and when the pie is baked, pour it in, shaking the pie a little to mix well; serve when cold. Pies of grouse, partridges, moor fowls, &c., are made precisely in the same manner, using one or more according to the size you wish to make your pie. The fillets of hares are likewise excellent in pies, whilst the legs might be jugged or converted into soup. Capons, poulards, green geese, or ducklings, may also be served

THE SEPTUAGENARIAN EPICURE. 426 spring of Ins extraordinary career, had been placed on an eminence, say the top of Primrose hill, and had had exhibited before his infantine eyes the enormous quantity of food his then insignificant person would destroy before he attained his seventy-first year,—first, he would believe it must be a delusion; then, secondly, he would inquire where the money could come from to purchase so much luxurious extravagance? But here I shall leave the pecuniary expenses on one side, which a man of wealth can easily sur- mount when required. So now, dearest, for the extraordinary fact: imagine on the top of the above-mentioned hill a rushlight of a boy just entering his tenth year, surrounded with the recherch6 provision and delicacies claimed by his rank and wealth, taking merely the medium consumption of his daily meals. By closely calculating, he would be surrounded and gazed at by the following number of quadrupeds, birds, fishes, &c.By no less than 30 oxen, 200 sheep, 100 calves, 200 lambs, 50 pigs; in poultry, 1,200 fowls, 300 turkeys, 150 geese, 400 ducklings, 263 pigeons ; 1,400 partridges, pheasants, and grouse ; 600 woodcocks and snipes ; 600 wild ducks, widgeon, and teal; 450 plovers, ruffes, and reeves; 800 quails, ortolans, and dotterels, and a few guillemdts and other foreign birds ; also 500 hares and rabbits, 40 deer, 120 Guinea fowl, 10 peacocks, and 360 wild fowl. In the way of fish, 120 turbot, 140 salmon, 120 cod, 260 trout, 400 mackerel, 300 whitings, 800 soles and slips, 400 flounders, 400 red mullet, 200 eels, 150 haddocks, 400 henings, 5,000 smelts, and some hundred thousand of those delicious sdvery whitebait, besides a few hundred species of fresh-water fishes. In sliell-fisli, 20 turtle, 30,000 oysters, 1,500 lobsters or crabs, 300,000 prawns, shrimps] sardines, and anchovies. In the way of fruit, about 500 lbs. of grapes, 360 lbs. of pine-apples, 600 peaches, 1,400 apricots, 240 melons, and some hundred thousand plums, greengages, apples, pears, and some millions of cherries, strawberries, raspberries, cun-ants, mulberries, and an abundance of other small fruit, viz., walnuts, chesnuts, dry figs, and plums. In vege- tables of all kinds, 5,475 pounds weight, and about 2,434 pounds of butter, 684 pounds of cheese, 21,000 eggs, 800 do. plovers’. Of bread, 44 tons, half a ton of salt and pepper, near 2i tons of sugar ; and, if he had happened to be a covetous boy, he could have formed a fortification or moat round the said hill with the liquids he would have to partake of to facilitate the digestion of the above-named provisions, which would amount to no less than 10,8164 gallons, which may be taken as below:—49 hogsheads of wine, 1,3681- gallons of beer, 584 gallons of spirits, 342 liqueur, 2,394f gallons of coffee, cocoa, tea, &c., and 304 gallons of milk, 2,736 gallons of water, all of which would actually protect him and his anticipated property from any young thief or fellow schoolboy, like Alexandre Dumas had protected Dante and his- immense treasure from the pirates in his island of Monte Christo. You now, dearest, fancy that I am exaggerating in every way; but to convince you, and to prevent your puzzling your brain to no purpose, I also enclose you a

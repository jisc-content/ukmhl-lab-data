23 BREAKFASTS. let the coffee get black, or the least burnt, do not attempt to make use of it: it should only be sufficiently charred to break easily in a mortar if required. 44. COFFEE MADE WITH A FILTER.—To make a quart: first put a pint of boiling water through the filter to warm it, which pour away, then put a quarter of a pouud of ground coffee upon the filter, and upon which put the pressor and the grating lightly, pour over half a pint of boiling water, let it stand three or four minutes, then pour over a pint and a half more boiling water; when well passed through, pour it into a clean stewpan, which set at the corner of the fire until a light scum arises, but not boiling; pour it again through the filter, and when well drained through, pour into the coffee-pot, and serve with hot milk, or a little cream, separately. 45. ANOTHER WAY, (more economical.)—Proceed as in the last, but drain the coffee through once only, and serve; after which, pour another quart of boiling water over the coffee-grounds, which, when drained through, reserve, and boil up for the next coffee you make, using it instead of water; use an ounce less coffee.

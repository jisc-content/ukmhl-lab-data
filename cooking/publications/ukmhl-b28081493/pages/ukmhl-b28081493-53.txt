To saute, put a little butter or good fat in the pan; set it on the fire with the slice in it, saute very gently, turning very often, and serve on very thin toast. 34. HAM AND EGGS.—While your ham is doing, break two fresh eggs in the pan, season slightly with salt and pepper, set it before the fire till the eggs are delicately done, and slip them whole carefully into your dish, without breaking the yolk. 35. BACON.—The streaked part of a thick flank of bacon is to be preferred; cut nice slices, not above a quarter of an inch thick, take off the rind, put to broil on the gridiron over a clear fire; turn it three or four times in the space of five minutes: this will be all the cooking required. Serve it very hot. Though this is the best part, the whole of the bacon is good, especially if not rank, which can be easily detected by its yellowish colour: if too dry or salt, after it has been cut in slices, dip it into a little vinegar and water three or four times, and saute as usual • it will make it softer and less salt.

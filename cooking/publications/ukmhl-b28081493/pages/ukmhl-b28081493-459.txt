THE BACHELOR’S DINNER. 459 LETTER No. XXIII. Dear Eloise, Since our little labours first went to press, I have received several kind notes from various persons requiring information on various points. To give all the information sought would make this volume double the size; but amongst others, there is a very polite one from a young bachelor, who states that finding we have so well described a dinner party as it ought to be, with ladies, he should like to know how one ought to be managed when gentlemen only are present, he being a young gentleman, and having no female relatives and acquaintances—a class which, he adds, is, unfortunately, numerous in England—and that it would be a boon for them to receive some information on the subject. I declare, my dear Eloise, that the style of his writing is so graceful and pleasing, that I should, if possible, like to gratify his wish.—Your ever grateful pupil, Hortense. LETTER No. XXIV.

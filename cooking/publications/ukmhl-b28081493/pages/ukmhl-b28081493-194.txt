156 FISH. if the flesh leaves the bone easily; dress upon a dish ■without a napkin ; then have ready the following sauce : mince a large bpanish onion with two common ones, and put them into a stewpan with three spoonfuls of salad-oil, saute rather a yellow colour, add two glasses of port wine and one spoonful of flour, mix all well together, add a pint oi broth (reserved from some soup) or water, with halt an ounce of glaze, or half a gill of brown gravy, or a few drops of colouring; boil it up, drain the stock the carp was cooked in from the vegetables, which also add to the sauce; boil well at the corner of the stove, skim, and when lather thick add a teaspoonfnl of Harvey sauce, one of essence of anchovies, and a little cayenne pepper, pour all the liquor drained from the fish out of your dish, sauce over, and serve. 272. CARP, SAUCE MATELOTE.—Put your carp in a small oval fish-kettle, with wine and vegetables as in the last, to which add also a pint of water and a little salt, wuth a few cloves and peppercorns; put the lid upon the fish-kettle, and stand it over a moderate fire to stew about an hour, according to the size; when done, drain well, dress upon a dish without a napkin, and sauce over with a matelote sauce, made as directed for salmon sauce matelote, or caper sauce, as for skate; small carp are very good- flavoured ; they should, like a whiting, open in two from the back, then bread-crumbed and fried. Trout.—There are several kinds, none of which, it seems, were known to the Romans. This is the salmon of fresh water, and bears a very close resemblance to it in flavour. They grow to a very large size ; I partook of part of one weighing twenty-six pounds, which was caught in the Lake of Killarney, in July, 1848. They have different names in various parts of Great Britain, but there is the common trout, the white trout, and the sea trout; the white trout never grows very large, but the sea trout does, and is of a veiy fine flavour.

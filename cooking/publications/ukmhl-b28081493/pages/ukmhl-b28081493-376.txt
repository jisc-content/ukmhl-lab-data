PASTRY. 338 edges with the hack of your knife, and place it upon a baking- sheet, which you have sprinkled with water; egg over the top, then dip the point of the knife into hot water, and cut a ring upon the top a quarter of an inch deep, and half an inch from the edge of the vol-au-vent, set in a rather hot oven; if getting too much colour, cover over with a sheet of paper, do not take it out before done, or it would fall, but when quite set, cut off the lid and empty it with a knife; be careful to make no hole in the side or bottom; if for first course it is ready, but if for second, sift sugar all over, which glaze with the salamander. Regulate the thickness of the paste from which you cut the vol-au-vent, according to the size you require it, the smaller ones of course requiring thinner paste. A vol-au-vent for entrees will take about half an hour to bake, and as the common iron ovens often throw out more heat upon one side than the other, it will require turning two or three times to cause it to rise equal; it ought to be when baked of a light gold colour. 752. VOL-AU-VENT OF PEACHES.—Put half a pound of sugar in a sugar-pan, with the juice of a lemon and about half a pint of water, place it upon the fire and boil till becoming a thickish syrup; then have eight peaches not quite ripe, which cut in halves, break their stones and blanch the kernels, throw six halves with the kernels into the syrup, boil three minutes, take them out with a skimmer, lay them upon a dish and take off their skins, stew the rest in syrup in like manner, four at a time; when all done pour what liquor runs from them again into the syrup, which reduce to a good thickness, pass it through a tammy into a basin, when cold pour a little over the peaches, and leave until ready to serve; dress the peaches in your vol- au-vent with the syrup over. This is a receipt I learnt in France, where I got peaches for a sou each. 753. VOL-AU-VENT WITH FRUIT.—These are gene- rally used for the second course, and do not require to be so high as the other, especially as the fruit ought to be dressed in the form of a pyramid; if they are cut about three quarters of an inch in thickness it will be enough; when nearly done, silt some powdered sugar over them, and put it back in the oven to glaze well; if not hot enough use the salamander; remove the interior, taking care not to make a hole in the bottom or sides, and fill with any kind of fruit you like, but never mix two kinds together, except currant aud raspberry.

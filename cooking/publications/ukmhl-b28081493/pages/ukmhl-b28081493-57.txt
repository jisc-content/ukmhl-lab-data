FAS iS gauze, rinse out the stewpan, pour the coffee (which will be quite clear) back into it, place it upon the fire, and, when nearly boiling, serve with hot milk if for breakfast, but with a drop of cold milk or cream if for dinner. To prove the simplicity of this mode of making coffee, I shall here give a repetition of the receipt as it actually is:— 41. TO MAKE COFFEE.—Put two ounces of ground coffee into a stewpan, which set upon the fire, stirring the p-owder round with a spoon until quite hot, then pour over a pint of boiling water; cover over closely for five minutes, pass it through a cloth, warm again, and serve.* The foregoing proportions would make coffee good enough for any person, but more or less coffee could be used if required; the cloth through which it is passed should be immediately washed and put by for the next occasion. A hundred cups of coffee could be made as here directed in half an hour, by procuring a pan sufficiently large, and using the proper proportions of coffee and water, passing it afterwards through a large cloth or jelly-bag. * This entirely new system of making coffee has never yet been introduced to the public, and was found out by the author of this work through the following circumstance : Whilst travelling by night in a railway train, and arriving in due time at the station, where positively no less than five minutes are allowed to restore exhausted nature after a long and tedious journey, and then obliged to use a certain portion of manual strength in pushing through the crowd to get at what is called the refreshment room, and after waiting for nearly two minutes for my turn to be served with some of the boiling liquid which they called coffee, found it as bad as any human being could possibly make it (they having probably waited patiently by the side of a winter’s fire until the last train made its appearance) ; it tasted anything but palatable ; but having along journey before me, and requiring something to eat and drink, I was obliged to put up with it; but before I could even partake of half, or finish masticating some stale toast or over-buttered muffin, the unsociable bell violently rang to acquaint the passengers that their appe- tites were perfectly satisfied, though that incredulous organ would not let us believe it; and every one being perfectly aware that railway trains, like time, wait for no one, the hurry of which event, fortunately, made me escape the swallowing the thick part which was deposited at the bottom of the cup. Rushing out of the refreshment room, I jumped into the wrong carriage, the fidgety train having changed its place, and the time being too short toVectif? tno mistake, I was obliged to make fresh acquaintance with my new com- pactions de voyage, who happened to be as much dissatisfied with the steam*

soyer’s charitable cookery. 503 with the soup or food, it being sufficient for one meal without, and will not only save time, but when eaten afterwards will be more wholesome, and act more generously on the system, than when eaten in haste. When the soup or food is ready, notice is given by ringing the bell, and the one hundred persons are admitted, and take their places at the table—the basins being previously filled, grace is said—the bell is again rung for them to begin, and a sufficient time is allowed them to eat their quart of food. During the time they are emptying their basins, the outside passage is again filling; as soon as they have done, and are going out at the other side, the basin and spoon is cleaned, and again filled; the bell rings, and a fresh number admitted; this continuing every successive six minutes, feeding one thou- sand persons per hour; but as there are three thousand quarts more to distribute, which only occupies seventy minutes to make, other means must be used for distributing the food, for which purpose a door is provided at the entrance of the kitchen, to which persons come with tickets, which are given to them by district visitors, or subscribers; or if not with tickets, to pur- chase the food and which they take home with them. There is also provided carts and barrows for either horses, donkeys, or men to draw, containing from twenty-five gallons to two hun- dred gallons each, with fires attached; so that the soup or food contained in them should be hot or cooking on its way to the place of distribution. Such is a brief description of the kitchen. I also propose to change the diet every day, according to the provisions obtainable, and on fast days to give meagre food. Its advantages over those at present in use are numerous; the principle of employing steam in cooking is not new, and is adopted in most large establishments in England and on the Continent; it not only causes a great saving in fuel, but also in the preparation of food, for, with the greatest care, it is liable to burn, when subjected to the direct heat of the fire on the bottom of the boilers; but my new plan of combining the use of steam, and the same fire which produces it, to act upon the pan containing the meat, vegetables, and condiments, extracting immediately the valuable nutritive qualities of the animal and vegetable substances without loss by evaporation, and in using it in the manner I do, is one which I may justly lay claim to as my invention. There isjalso great economy in the number of hands employed.

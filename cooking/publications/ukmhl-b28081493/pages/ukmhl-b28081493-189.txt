151 FISH. 262. SOLES, SAUTE IN OIL.—Trim the fish well, ■dip it into a couple of eggs, well beaten, put six table- spoonfuls of salad-oil in a saute-pan, place it over the fire, and when quite hot put in your sole, let it remain five minutes, turn over, and saute upon the other side; ten or twelve minutes will cook it, according to the size; serve upon a napkin without sauce; they are excellent cold. 263. SOLE A LA MEUNIERE.—Cut the fins off a sole, and make four incisions across it upon each side with a knife, then rub half a tablespoonful of salt and chopped onions well into it, dip in flour, and broil it over a slow fire; also have ready two ounces of fresh butter, mixed with the juice of a lemon, and a little cayenne, which rub ’■over the sole, previously laid in a hot dish, without a napkin, turn the fish over once or twice, put it in the oven a minute, and serve very hot. 263.* SOLE AU GRATIN.*—Cut the fins off a fine fresh sole, make an incision in the back, then butter a saute-pan, and put one teaspoonful of chopped onions in it with a glass of white wine, then lay in the sole, cover it with six spoonfuls of brown sauce, and sprinkle some bread-crumbs over it, with a few small pieces of butter; then place it in a moderate oven twenty minutes or half an hour, (try when done,) take it out of the saute- pan, and dish without a napkin; then put four spoonfuls of stock in the saute-pan, boil it five minutes, keeping it stirred, then add the juice of half a lemon, a teaspoonful of chopped mushrooms, if handy, one of chopped parsley, one of essence of anchovies, and a little sugar and cayenne * In France they have silver dishes on purpose for those dishes, in which they are dressed and served to table ; the gratin adhering to the bottom of the dish is a great improvement.

CURR1 SAUCE.—This I generally keep ready-made in the larder, being very fond of what I consider such wholesome food as curry; but not liking to be troubled with making it often, I cause my cook to prepare a certain quantity at a time. Mr. B. is very partial to curry, but he likes it in winter; for my part, I prefer it in summer. After having partaken of some one very hot summer’s day, I felt quite cold. Capt. White, who has been nearly twenty years in the East Indies, tells me that it will produce that refreshing effect; I can enjoy it in any season. Put into a pan four good-sized onions, sliced, and two peeled apples, with a quarter of a pound of butter, the same of lean ham, a blade of mace, four peppercorns, two bay-leaves, two sprigs of thyme; stir them over a mode- rate fire until the onions become brown and tender, then add two tablespoonfuls of the best curry powder, one of vinegar, two of flour, a teaspoonful of salt, one of sugar; moisten it with a quart of broth or milk, or even water, with the addition of a little glaze ; boil till in a pulp, and adhering rather thickly to the back of the spoon; pass all through a fine sieve or tammy, give it another boil for a few minutes, put it in a basin, and use when required. Any kind of meat, poultry, and fish, or parts of game, are excellent warmed in this sauce, and served with well- boiled and dry rice. I have kept this sauce in a cool place in the winter for a month, boiling it now and then. The quantity of powder may be omitted, and a spoonful of curry paste used, or some mangoes. (See Curries.) 157. A VERY GOOD AND USEFUL WHITE SAUCE (quite new).—Put a quart of white sauce in a stew- pan of a proper size on a fire; stir continually until reduced to one-third; put two yolks of eggs in a basin, stir them well up, add your sauce gradually, keep stirring.

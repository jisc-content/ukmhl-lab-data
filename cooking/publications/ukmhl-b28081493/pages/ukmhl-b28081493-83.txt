47 COMFORTS FOR INVALIDS. 92. RASPBERRY VINEGAR BEVERAGE.—Put two tablespoonfuls of raspberry vinegar into a cup, over which pour half a pint of boiling water; when cold, use it as you may be instructed or when necessary; any kind of fruit syrup would answer the same purpose, and be equally as good, that is, currants, cherries, strawberries mulberries, &c. 93. A VERY STRENGTHENING DRINK.—Put a teaicupful of pearl-barley into a saucepan, with three pints of cold wTater, the rind of a lemon, and a small piece of cinnamon; boil the whole very gently until the barley becomes tender, then strain it through a fine sieve, and sweeten with a spoonful of treacle: if treacle should be objectionable, honey or sugar will do. 94. FRESH FRUIT WATER.—Fresh fruits, when m season, are very preferable to syrups, which are but seldom well made, except at some of the first confectioners or Italian warehouses. Pick a pottle of fresh raspberries or strawberries, which- ever you may require, rub them through a sieve into a basin, which mix well with half a pint of syrup, the juice of a lemon, and a quart of spring water; pass it through a fine hair sieve, and put it by in a jug for use : both the sjrup and water may either be increased or diminished according to taste. Red or wMte currant icaters are made precisely the same, only omitting the lemon, the currants themselves bein^ sufficiently sharp. ° 99.

VI of our success, for be well convinced that it is more clue to the iron tongue of the press than to the brain that has conceived it. A Second Edition is already wanted, say you—“ I can hardly believe it,”—and that in less than a fort- night. At all events, the only novelty in this one must be confined to corrections, which I can assure you, thanks to you and the printer’s carelessness, are tolerably numerous; therefore, follow your publisher’s advice, and cause the steam-press to issue, as quickly as possible, 6000 copies, which will form the Second Edition. With the greatest esteem, I remain, ever yours, Hortense. P.S.—I have forwarded you one of the Magic Stoves, which I have just received from Gardner’s. I had this morning one on our breakfast-table, and cooked in a very short time, at a trifling expense, two of Soyei'’s new mutton chops (No. 452) four sau- sages, and eight pieces of very thin bacon, and also in the fat fried two slices of bread; we were eight to breakfast, and all enjoyed this extraordinary novelty. You reproach me for not sending you one earlier; that which I intended for you has been taken by the Marquis of N. and party to Egypt, with the view of having a dinner cooked on the top of the Pyramids.

ENTREES. 245 462. SOYER’S NEW MUTTON CHOP. — Trim a middling-sized saddle of mutton, which cut into chops half an inch in thickness with a saw, without at all making use of a knife (the sawing them off jagging the meat and causing them to eat more tender), then trim them to the shape represented in the drawing, season well with salt and pepper, place them upon a gridiron over a sharp fire, turning them three or four times; they would require ten minutes cooking; when done dress them upon a hot dish, spread a small piece of butter over each, (if approved of,) and serve: by adding half a tablespoonful of Soyer’s Gentlemen’s or Lady’s Sauce to each chop when serving, and turning it over two or three times, an excellent entree is produced: the bone keeping the gravy in whilst cooking, it is a very great advantage to have chops cut after this method. At home, when I have a saddle of mutton, I usually cut two or three such chops, which I broil, rub maitre-d’hotel butter over, and serve with fried potatoes round, using the remainder of the saddle the next day for a joint. The above are also very ex- cellent, well seasoned and dipped into egg and bread-crumbs previous to broiling. Lamb chops may be cut precisely the same, but require a few minutes less broiling. You must remark that, by this plan, the fat and lean are better divided, and you can enjoy both ; whilst the other is a lump of meat near the bone and fat at the other end, which partly melts in cooking, and is often burnt by the flame it makes ; the new one not being divided at the bone, keeps the gravy in admirably. If well sawed it should not weigh more than the ordinary one, being about half the thickness. Do try them, and let ma know your opinion. Ever yours, IIortensb.

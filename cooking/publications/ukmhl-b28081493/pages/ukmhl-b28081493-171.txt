FISH. 133 The Forked Hake never comes into the market; but should it in future do so, it should also be cooked like haddock. Haddock, the callarias and galeris of the Romans. This is also the fish that it is said St. Peter took the tribute money from, and thus gave the impressioR of his finger and thumb, where it remains in confirmation of the miracle. It is a very fine flavour when fresh and in season, which is when the roe is very small; the time depends on the place where taken, but generally about Oc- tober. I think one weighing from six to seven pounds is the best size, although I have had them at twelve pounds. They follow the young herrings and sprats ; and, when feeding on them, their flesh is richer than when feeding on whitings: they cannot be eaten too fresh. Those received in the London market of a large size are called Dublin Bay, but which generally come from the Sussex and Hampshire coast. The same features as in the cod will tell if they are fresh. 235. DUBLIN BAY HADDOCK.—This is a fish winch I can highly recommend, both for its firmness and lightness; it is excellent plain boiled, and served with a cream sauce, or any other fish sauce. But the better plan IS to cut tour or five incisions upon each side of the fish an inch deep, then put it into a deep dish, and cover well with salt, let it remain about two hours, then put the fish m boiling water, to. simmer from thirty to forty minutes; if a fish of five or six pounds in weight, dish it on a nap- kin garnished with plain boiled parsnips and parsley, with egg sauce in a boat. The common haddocks may be dressed precisely the same. ^ fish86;tbBAKiED iIADD0CK-Fi1l the interior of the f tdfii th iSt lng’ SGW, ^ UP With Pa°kthread, and truss J* ;th the tail m its mouth, rub a piece of butter over the diP °l and bread"crurab it over, set it on a baking- BaP n r ^ Warmish ovcn to babe i if a Dublin to l l U W°U d take from three quarters of an hour an hour, but a common haddock would require but half

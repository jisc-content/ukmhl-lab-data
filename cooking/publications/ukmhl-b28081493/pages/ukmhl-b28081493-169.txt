FISH. 131 etili alive, where they are immediately crimped; the flesh then becomes firm and flaky, with a fine curd between each. Those are best with a small head and thick at the neck. 232. TO BOIL COD FISH.—Crimped cod, as I have before remarked, is preferable to the plain; it is likewise better cut in slices than cooked whole; to boil it well, have the water ready boiling, with one pound of salt to every six quarts; put in your fish, draw your fish-kettle to the corner of the fire, where let it simmer slowly from twenty minutes to half an hour; when done, the bone in the centre will draw out easily; if boiled too much, it would eat tough and stringy; should the fish not be crimped, add more salt to the water, it will cause the fish to eat firmer. 233. COD FISH SAUCED OYER WITH OYSTER SAUCE.—Boil three slices of the fish as above, drain and dress them upon a dish without a napkin, blanch three dozen oysters, by putting them into a stewpan, with their juice, upon the fire, move them round occasionally, do not let them boil; as soon as they become a little firm, place a sieve over a basin, pour in the oysters, beard them, put the liquor again into a stewpan; when boiling, add two cloves, half a blade of mace, six peppercorns, and two ounces of butter, to which you have added a tablespoonful offloui, breaking it into small pieces, stir well together, when boiling, season with a little salt, cayenne pepper’ and essence of anchovies, finish with a gill of cream or milk, add the oysters, and sauce over. The remains of the fish may be taken from the bone and placed upon a dish, with a little of the above sauce (to which you have added the yolks of two eggs), then sprinkle over with bread-crumbs, and place it twenty minutes in a hot oven till the bread-crumbs become brown.

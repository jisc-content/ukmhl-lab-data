BREAKFASTS. 16 32. SAUTEED KIDNEAS.—Should you not have a fire fit for broiling, put an ounce of butter into a saute-pan (which of course must be very clean), cut the kidney in halves lengthwise, remove the skin, and when the butter is melted, lay them in, the flat side downwards, Having previously well seasoned them with pepper and salt; set the pan on a moderate fire three minutes, then turn them; place them again upon the fire until done; when have ready a piece of dry toast, which place upon a hot dish, pour the kidneys with the butter and gravy over, and serve very hot. Care must be taken in sauteing that the butter does not become burnt. Another way is to sprinkle about a teaspoonful of chopped eschalots, or onions, over them whilst being sauteed. This materially changes the flavour, and meets the approbation of many.

HAM, BACON. 33. BACON AND HAM for broiling.—Ham for broil- ing ought not to be too old or too dry, it would perhaps eat rank. Nothing requires more care than broiling. Either get a slice of ham weighing a quarter of a pound or two ounces, which lay on your gridiron; put it over the fire; it will take perhaps five minutes if the fire is good, and more, of course, if slow; but in that short space of time, turn it three or four times, and it is done. Pro- ceed the same if you want to serve it with poached eggs (see No. 16), but be careful that the eggs be ready at the same time as the bacon or ham, or both would eat badly. If you happen to have a whole ham by you for that purpose only, as is often the case at a farmhouse,

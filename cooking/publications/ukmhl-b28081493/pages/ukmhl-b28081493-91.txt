55 COMFORTS FOR INVALIDS. over lightly, rub the gridiron over with a little oil, lay the whiting upon it, and put it over a clear fire, but not too close, turn it carefully three or four times, and when it feels firm to the touch of the finger, it is done; if a large one, it will take about twenty minutes; sprinkle a little salt over, if required, and serve with plain melted butter, with a few drops of essence of anchovies in it. 118. SAUTEED WHITINGS.—Put some fat or butter in a frying-pan, which place over a clear but moderate fire; have your whiting floured as in the last, and when the fat or butter is melted, lay it in the pan; let it saute slowly until it is done, which try as in either of the last two; when done, drain it upon a cloth, sprinkle a little salt over, and serve. If fried, enveloped in bread-crumbs, dip the fish lightly into flour, then egg it all over with a paste brush, and dip in some very fine bread-crumbs, and fry it rather longer, but do not let the fat get black, or it will give the fish a black heavy appearance, and quite spoil the flavour. Fish fried in oil would have a much better appearance than when fried in fat, but probably would be objectionable to a weak stomach. They ought to be completely covered with the fat. 119. SMALL SOLES or SLIPS may be either boiled, broiled, or fried, as directed for whitings, requiring about the same time to cook; serve precisely the same. Smelts are very delicate fish, but ought never to be plain boiled : being confident of the good use they may be turned to as a diet for the sick, I shall here give two receipts for dressing them very plainly yet still very palatably. 120. SMELTS, BOILED.—Choose them rather large, —if so, two would be sufficient for a meal,—having pre- viously drawn and cleansed them, put a gill of water into

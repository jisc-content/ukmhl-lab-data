508 SOYER’s MODEL KITCHEN'. “ To snPP!y number of rations by the old plan of pre- paring food in different depots, would have cost, at 3d. per ration (which is rather under the average), the sum of . But, according to my plan of preparing food with my model kitchen, as it was estimated in a report made to the Belief Committee by its Secretary, on the 23rd of April last, the cost of each ration, including coals, expenses of house, carriage, labour, &c., came to 1 §d., making altogether, for 2,868,179 lbs. of solid food, a sum of £15,536 7,768 “ Effecting a saving in favour of the South Union Committee of 50 per cent., or a sum of .... £7 768 “In suPPort of the almvc statement, I beg to observe that the ratepayers of the North l nion of Dublin have paid 3s. 4d. in the pound, whilst those of the South Union only paid Is. This result, Sir, speaks volumes in favour of my system. In addition to the model kitchen, Messrs. Brown & Co., of Great Bussell Street, Borough, have erected one of their patent steam-plate ovens, which can bake on an average 1,000 loaves of 4 lb. each every 12 hours with three bushels of coke. The 1,000 loaves require 11 sacks of flour, consequently, 22 sacks can be worked in 24 hours, 132 sacks "per week, at about a Id. per sack for fuel. W hat with the savings in baking, and also the new process of making bread I have introduced, I calculate that full 2o per cent, can be saved on the cost of bread at all times. Therefore, admitting that the model kitchen, the new oven, and the new bread could only save 35 or 40 per cent, to the ratepayers, the system cannot be otherwise than particularly intci’esting to the whole community. “ I am, Sir, yours most respectfully, “Befobm Club, Sept. 23.” “ A.

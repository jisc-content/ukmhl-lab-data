PASTRY S42 cut in fine strips the rind of a lemon or orange, boil with the apples, and ornament also with pieces of young angelica pre- served, cut in diamond, placing a piece between each apple. Flancs of pears may be made precisely the same way, but with good ripe eating pears, cut in two lengthwise, leaving the stalk cut in half. 768. A PLAINER WAY.—Peel and cut eight apples in thin slices in a pan, with two ounces of pounded sugar, the .rind and juice of a lemon, the rind well-chopped, put on fire, stir till forming a thick marmalade, and tender, melt a little currant jelly, pour over and serve. 769. SMALL FRUIT TARTS.—The next in order to sweet vol-au-vents, and which are easier to make, are tartlets, their appearance being inviting, and their expense limited, and very easy to serve. They may be made from the trimmings of any puff' paste which remains, and should be enveloped in paper, and kept in a cold place, or in the flour-tub. Make them as follows:—Have ready twelve or more small tartlet pans, which butter, line each with a bit of puff" paste cut with a cutter the size of a crown-piece, force up the edges with your thumb and finger, put a small ball (made of flour and water) in each, bake them nicely in a very hot oven; when done, take out the ball (which may be kept for other occasions) from the tartlets, and shake powdered sugar over the bottom of each, and glaze with a salamander, turn them over, and shake sugar in the interior, which also salamander; fill with any kind of preserve, marmalade, or fruit, for sweet vol-au-vents. They may be made with cream as follows:—Make your tartlets as before, placing cream instead of the ball of flour, made thus: put half a pint of milk in a stew- pan, when boiling, add half a stick of vanilla, reduce the milk to half in another stewpan, have the yolks of two eggs and a quarter of an ounce of powdered sugar, and one ounce of sifted flour, with a grain of salt, pour in the milk, taking out the vanilla, place over a slow fire, keep stirring till it thickens; when cold, fill the tartlets, and bake nicely in a moderate oven; when cold, add a little jam, have ready a meringue of four eggs (see No. 772), lay a -teaspoonful of each upon them, spreading it quite flat with a knife, ornament the top with some of the mixture, put into a paper cornet, sift sugar over, place in a slow oven till a light brown colour, and the meringue quite crisp; it the oven

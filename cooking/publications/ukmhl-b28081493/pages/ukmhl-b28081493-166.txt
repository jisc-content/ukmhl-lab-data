128 FISH. Of all aliments that have been given to the human race for nourishment, none are more abundant or more easy to procure than this antediluvian species, and yet of how few do we make use, and how slight is our knowledge of their habits, for it is only within the last few years that the idea was exploded that the herrings made an annual migration from the Arctic seas to deposit their spawn on the shores of these islands. Fish possess, according to their kind, a greater or less degree of nourishment, depending, like the animal, in a great measure on those beautiful meadows at the bottom of the ocean, â– where they feed; for even those which live upon some of a smaller kind, as the cod on the haddock, this on the whiting, and this again on the mussel, or other crustaceous fish which move but little from the place where they were originally spawned, derive their nourishment from the herbs and the animal- culse which those herbs produce that grow around them; the cod on the south- east of the Bank of Newfoundland is as fine again in flavour as that on the north-west side. Fish, of course, do not afford the same amount of nourish- ment as meat, as they contain but a slight quantity of osmazome ; but its flesh is refreshing, and often exciting. A curious circumstance has been observed in respect to the animate parts of the creation which draw their nourishment from fish, as in birds and the human race, that they produce more females when doing so than males. It ought to be made an article of diet more often than it is, as the particles it contains tend to purify the blood from the grossness it receives in partaking of animal food ; and when taken at the commencement of dinner, tends to assist the digestion of those substances which form the more substantial part of the meal. In the Receipts will be found those which I consider fit for the table; but, as a general rule to be observed, as in the feathered tribe, all those of beautiful variegated colours (as the wrasse* kind) are more unfit to eat than any other; as if the Great Creator of all, in order to please man, had destined some for his nourishment, and others to gratify his senses by their melodious notes and beautiful plumage. * This fish is eaten in many parts of Great Britain, but I cannot recom- mend it. *

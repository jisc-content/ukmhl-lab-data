Last winter I kept some for three months quite sweet; having half a one left, I put it by in the above way, bones and all, in a basin, and covered with the fat produced with roasting, and put it in the larder, and it was excellent. Ducks may be served in the same way. DUCKS.—There are several varieties of this bird, all, however, originating from the mallard. There have not been that care and attention paid to this bird as to the fowl; but I think it is well worthy the attention of farmers, it being one which is exceedingly cheap to rear; great care should be evinced in feeding it twelve days previously to its being killed. Ducklings are con- sidered a luxury, but which, I think, is more to be attributed to their scarcity than flavour : those from Aylesbury are preferred. The drake is generally considered the best, but, as a general rule, those of the least gaudy plumage are the best; they should be hard and thick on the belly, and limber-footed. 400.

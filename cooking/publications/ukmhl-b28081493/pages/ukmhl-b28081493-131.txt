SAUCES. 93 143. MUSCE HERB SAUCE.—Put two tablespoon- fuls of finely chopped onions in a stewpan, and a table- spoonful of oil, place it on the fire, stir a few minutes, add ten tablespoonfuls of demi-glaze, and four of broth or water; boil, skim; if too thick, and the scum should not rise, add half a gill of broth or water; boil, and reduce to a proper thickness, and add a tablespoonful of chopped parsley if at hand, one of mushrooms, and season with a little cayenne; the juice of a quarter of a lemon; serve. I often introduce a little garlic in this. 144. ITALIAN HERB SAUCE.—Proceed in the same way as the above, only add a little chopped thyme, and a small glass of sherry. 145. ROBERT SAUCE.—Peel and cut up two good- sized onions, put them in stewpan with an ounce of butter, till they are a nice yellow colour, then add eight table- spoonfuls of demi-glaze, and two of water or broth; skim boil quickly; when of a proper thickness add a good table- spoonful of French mustard; season rather high; if no French mustard, use English, but it completely changes the fiavotir, though still very palatable.

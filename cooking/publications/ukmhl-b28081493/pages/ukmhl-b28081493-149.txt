Ill SOUPS. tarragon; however, some few sorts of vegetables, mixed together, make a most estimable soup. Weigh half a pound of the vegetables in fair proportions to each other; that is, carrots, turnips, onions, celery, and leeks, which cut into small fillets an inch in length, and of the thickness of a trussing-needle; when done, wash dry, and pass them in butter and sugar as before, add two quarts of clear soup, adding, just before it is done, a little sorrel, cabbage- lettuce, and chervil or peas, if handy, but it will be excel- lent without either. 193. CLEAR TURNIP SOUP.—Cut, with a round vegetable scoop, about forty pieces of turnip, of the shape and size of small marbles, which put into a stewpan, with sugar and butter as before, but fry them of a light brownish colour, add two quarts of broth, and finish the soup as in the previous receipts. A tablespoonful of Italian paste, previously half boiled in water, then drained and finished in the soup, is also an improvement. 194. CLEAR ARTICHOKE SOUP. —Peel twelve Jerusalem artichokes, which well wash, then cut as many round scoops as possible, the same as in the last, proceed- ing exactly the same. The remainder of either turnips, artichokes, or carrots, may be boiled, and mashed with a little butter, pepper, and salt, and served as a vegetable, or reserved to make a soup puree; the remains of other vegetables from the previous soups should also be re- served for flavouring of stock, instead of using the fresh vegetables. 195. VERMICELLI.—Put a quart of clear stock into a stewpan upon the fire, and when boiling, add two ounces of vermicelli; boil gently ten minutes, and it is ready to serve.

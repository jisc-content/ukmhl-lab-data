POULTRY. 210 That is my plan of boiling, but the following is my new way of giving the flavour of vegetables to all poultry, which is a decided improvement. The aroma from the bird when the cover is removed is quite inviting, and the appearance of it, which is as white as alabaster, and cuts also full of juice : I call it— 381.

I also often stuff it thus: I put two

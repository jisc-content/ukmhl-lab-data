FISH. 348 a very unsightly appearance). A turbot of ten pounds •weight will take about an hour to cook after it has begun to boil (but, to be certain, ascertain whether the flesh will leave the bone easily); then take it out of the water, let it remain a minute upon the drainer, and serve upon a napkin, with a few sprigs of fresh parsley round, and lobster sauce, or shrimp sauce, in a boat. 258. TURBOT, TIIE NEW FRENCH FASHION. —Boil your turbot as in the last, but dress it upon a dish without a napkin, sauce over with a Hollandaise sauce, or any other way, with a thick caper sauce (having made a border of small new potatoes round it), sprinkle a few capers over the fish and serve. 259. TURBOT A LA CREME is made from the re- mains of a turbot left from a previous dinner: pick all the flesh from the bones, which warm in salt and water, and have ready the following sauce: put one ounce of flour into a stewpan, to which add by degrees a quart of milk, mixing it very smoothly; then add two peeled eschalots, a bouquet of parsley, a bay-leaf and a sprig of thyme tied together; add a little grated nutmeg, a teaspoonful of salt and a quarter ditto of pepper; place it over the fire, stirring until it forms a thickish sauce; then take it from the fire, stir in a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, and pass it through a tammy; lay a little of it upon the bottom of a convenient-sized dish, then a layer of the fish, season lightly with a little white pepper and salt, then another layer of sauce, proceeding thus until the fish is all used, finishing with sauce; sprinkle a few bread-crumbs over, and put it into a warm oven half an hour; brown with the salamander, and serve upon the dish it is baked on. Any remains of boiled fish may be dressed the same way.

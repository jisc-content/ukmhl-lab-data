iv ceipts to our culinary journal, I beg of you to call this morning upon the printer, Savill, of Chandos-street, and get composed, in good plain reading type, the en- closed ; it will probably make forty more pages. Send me a proof as soon as possible, which I will immediately correct and return to you, as you say our publishers are now getting short of the work. I would not think of going to press this time with less than 5000. Kind remembrances of love and friendship to you and yours, Dear Eloise, Hortense. The extraordinary sale of this work, unparalleled in the history of the book-trade, (for the short time from its publication, the 7th of Sept. 1849,) has caused many to doubt the fact. The author has therefore inserted the following letter, received from his publishers: Stationers Sail Court, Feb. 15, 1850. Dear Sir, "We beg to inform you, that tbe sale of your “ Modern Housewife” is still in great demand, and we would therefore advise you to go to press immediately with 3000 or 4000, as they are certain of being wanted early in March. We remain, your most obedient servants, Simpkin, Marshall, & Co. To M. Soyer, Reform Club. P.S.—The last number mentioned would be preferable, as completing the Twenty Thousandth copy of your last work. Let us know, also, when the 7th edition of your “ Gastronomic Regenerator” can be delivered to us.

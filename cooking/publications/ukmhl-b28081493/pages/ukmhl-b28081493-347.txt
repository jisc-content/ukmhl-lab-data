309 SECOND COURSE. die head ; but in a small farm-house where they kill a pig perhaps once a year at Christmas, the head can be very easily cut off for this purpose. Being on a visit some years since at a farm-house, I had the opportunity of having one, and trying my skill upon it ; it was much approved of, both for its ferocious appearance, and its flavour, and it lasted good tor three weeks. The following is the way you should do it: procure the head with as much of the neck attached to it as possible (the hog must have been stabbed in the neck, not hit on the head, as that would have broken the skull); then singe it well over the flame of a fire, wipe it with a cloth, scrape it well with a knife with- out scratching the skin, and place it on a cloth upon its skull; open it very carefully without piercing the skin, leaving no flesh, whatever upon the bones; bone the neck part, and cut it into small fillets two inches long, lay the head on a board and rub it with half a pound of brown sugar, let it remain for one hour; then place it in a salting tub, and throw over it six pounds of salt, pour in a separate pan two quarts of ale, add four bay-leaves, half an ounce of peppercorns, a quarter ditto of cloves, six blades of mace, eight sliced onions, ten sprigs of thyme, ten of winter savory, and two sliced carrots; stir it well up, and let it remain for two hours; then throw it over the head, which turn eveiy day for eight or ten days, rubbing it well; when sufficiently salted, take it out and dry it on a cloth, lay the head straight before you, skin side upwards; have ready six or eight pounds o forcemeat, but using pork instead of veal, with which cover the head an inch in thickness at the thinnest part; put the fillets cut from the neck in a layer lengthwise in the head, with a lon°- piece of fat bacon, half an inch square, between each, sprinkle a little chopped eschalots, pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg over, and continue filling with forcemeat and the other ingredients until you have used the whole and it be quite full; join the two cheeks ogether with the above in the interior, sew it up with packthread, giving it the shape of the head as much as possible, and fold it in one or two large thin cloths, leaving the ears out and upright. Bmtsc as follows : Put half a pound of butter in a large braising-pan or stock-pot, over which put four pounds of trimmings of pork or knuckle of veal, eight onions, two carrots, four turnips, eight bay-leaves, a tablespoonful o peppercorns, twelve cloves, ten sprigs of thyme, ten of marjoram, four es of mace, half a bottle of bucellas wine, if at hand, and four calf’s feet, P ace it upon a sharp fire, stirring it occasionally, until the bottom is covered

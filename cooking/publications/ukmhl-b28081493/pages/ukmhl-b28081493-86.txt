COOLING LEMONADE.—Put a quart of water in a stewpan to boil, into which put two moist dried figs, each split in two; let it boil a quarter of an hour, then have ready the peel of a lemon, taken off rather thickly, and the half of the lemon cut in thin slices; throw them into the stewpan, and boil two minutes longer; pour it into a jug, which cover closely with paper until cold, then pass it through a sieve: add a teaspoonful of honey, and • it is ready for use. 103. IMPERIAL, (a Cooling Drink for the Spring.)— Two ounces of cream of tartar, two lemons (juice and peel), four ounces of sugar; place in a stone jug, and pour about six quarts of boiling water; allow it to get cold, and bottle for use. Or, instead of sugar, add three table- spoonfuls of raspberry vinegar, and six ounces of honey. This is excellent aerated like soda water. Essence of ratafia, or any other, maybe added, with about half a pint of pure spirit at proof, for those accustomed to spmts. 104. ORANGEADE.—Proceed as for lemonade, but using the whole of the orange, a little of the peel include , sweetening with sugar-candy, and adding a teaspoonful o arrow-root mixed with a little cold water, which pour into the boiling liquid at the same time you put in the orange. The arrow root makes it very delicate.

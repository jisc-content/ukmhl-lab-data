PASTRY. 344 gently, perfectly mixing the sugar, then with a table or dessert spoon lay them out upon white paper in the shape of eggs, sift /owdered sugar thickly over, let them remain ten minutes, then shake off the superfluous sugar, place upon boards which you have wetted, and put them in a slow oven, just hot enough to cause them to be light and slightly tinged; when the outside becomes quite crisp, take off the papers, by turning them topsy- turvy and lifting the papers from them; dip your spoon into hot water, and with it clear out the best part of the interior, dust them with powdered sugar, lay them upon a baking-sheet, and put into the screen to dry; they may be made several days be- fore they are required, if put away in a dry place; to serve, fill them with whipped cream, flavoured either with vanilla or orange-flower (but do not make it too sweet), stick two toge- ther, dress in pyramid upon a napkin, and serve. Should they happen to stick to the papers, moisten the papers with a paste- brush and water underneath; they will come away easier. 773. GATEAU FOURREE.—This style of cake is exceed- ingly simple, and admits of great variation. You must make half a pound of puff paste (No. 745), take one third of it and roll it out several times so as to deaden it, then mould it round with your hands to the shape of a ball, roll it out flat to the thickness of half a crown, lay it on a baking-sheet, put on it marmalade a quarter of an inch thick, reserving about one inch all round of paste to fix the cover on, then roll out the remainder of the paste to the same shape, it will of course be thicker; wet the edges of the bottom, and lay the cover on it, press it so that it sticks, cut neatly round the edges, and make a mark with the back of a knife about a quarter of an inch deep and half an inch apart all round, egg over, and lightly mark any fanciful design with the point of a knife on the cover, bake in a very hot oven for twenty minutes; when nearly done, sprinkle some sugar over, and sala- mandex-, and serve cold. It may be made with frangipane and cream and apple marmalade, and then can be served hot. 774. DARTOISE FOURREE.—The former one must be made in proportion to the dish you intend to serve on, but the following is simple, and looks as well: -Prepare the paste as before, but roll the bottom piece square, put it on a baking- sheet, cover with jam, marmalade, or frangipane, leaving one inch at the edge, roll the cover the same size, wet the edges, place it

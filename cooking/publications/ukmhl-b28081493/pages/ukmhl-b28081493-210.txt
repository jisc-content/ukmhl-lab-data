When the meat is cut up, the following kernels must be taken out, in order to preserve the beef, particularly in hot weather : those in the neck, where the shoulder clod is removed; two from the round, the popeâ€™s eye, and one from the flap ; one in the thick flap in the middle of the flank, and another between the rump and aitch-bone. The flavour and quality of the meat depend on the country whence it comes, and the nature of its food.* As a general rule, the flesh ought to be of a dark red colour, smooth, open-grained, with fat rather white than yellow, running in thin streaks through the flesh. Ox-beef is the largest and richest, but heifer is better, if well fed. It should be hung for two days previous to using, in a cool place, free from draught; it will keep good from three to six days, according to the weather. 308. SIRLOIN OF BEEF should never be less than three of the short ribs, and will weigh more or less accord- ing to the size of the ox from which it is taken; that from a small, well-fed, Scotch heifer, I consider the best; it will weigh about twelve pounds, and take about two hours and a half to roast, depending much on the fire. Having spitted or hung the joint, cover it with buttered paper, and place it eighteen inches from the fire; about one hour after it has been down, remove the paper, and place the joint nearer the fire, put half a pint 01 water, with a little salt, in the dripping-pan; about a quarter of an hour before removing from the fire, dredge it with flour and salt from the dredging-box; when taken from the fire, empty the contents of the dripping-pan into a basin, from which remove the fat; pour the gravy in the * See future Letters.

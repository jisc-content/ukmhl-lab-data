REMOVES. 188 337. HAUNCH OF MUTTON.—I have already de- scribed the mode of selecting the best for a small family —a Welsh, Devonshire, or Southdown; in cold winter time, a plump Scotch Highland, in Ireland a Kerry or Wicklow is the best; it should have been hung three weeks. Saw or break three inches from the knuckle-bone, remove all skin from the loin, put it on a spit, commencing at the knuckle, and bringing it out at the flap, avoiding the fillet of the loin; then cover it with three sheets of but- tered paper, place it about eighteen inches from the fire, if a large one it will take two hours and a half; half an hour before being done, remove the paper, baste it with a little butter, and dredge it slightly; when done, dish it up with a frill round the knuckle, and pour a pint of hot gravy over. In summer time, French beans should be served with it, but always mashed potatoes. 338. SADDLE OF MUTTON.—The same rule in regard to choice applies to this as to the haunch. Take oft' the skin, run a lark-spit through the spinal marrow- bone, which affix to a larger one with a holdfast at one end and string at the other; then tie the paper over the back, and place it down to roast; it will not take so long a time to roast, in proportion, as another joint; one about ten pounds will take about one hour and twenty minutes; remove the paper ten minutes before taking it from the fire, dredge to give it a nice colour, and make gravy as for beef, No. 308, or serve with gravy, No. 183. 339. SADDLE OF MUTTON, A LA POLONAISE. —This is my economical dish, par excellence, and very much it is liked every time I use it. Take the remains of a saddle of mutton, of the previous day, cut out all the meat close to the bone, leaving about one inch wide on the outside, cut it with a portion of the fat, into small dice;

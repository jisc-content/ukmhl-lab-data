448 FOOD IN CHOLERA. prived; but thanks now for the change which has taken place, we may shortly hope for a permanent decrease, especially with the progress medical science has made since the first appearance oi this awiul visitation in Europe. The following are a series of receipts which I have submitted to some scientific men, which, after a few corrections on their part, have been pro- nounced good, and which may be taken during the illness by those who have the least tendency to it or fear of the cholera: TO BOIL RICE.—Well wash half a pound of rice in cold water, which throw away, put to boil half a gallon of water, in which put your rice, boil six minutes; put on a sieve, butter slightly a stewpan, put in the rice, cover over, set in the oven for fifteen minutes, or near a fire; it will then be white and very digestible, still astringent, and every grain detached from each other; if no oven or stewpan handy, boil in water fifteen minutes, throw on a sieve, let drain a short time, serve on a dish, and eat plain, with salt, or as follows: When the rice is done either way, add half a teaspoonful of salt, a quarter of an ounce of brown sugar, a little cayenne pepper, one ounce of salt butter, mix lightly with a fork, and serve very hot; in case of slight derangements increase the pepper.

Eor beef proceed precisely the same (with mutton), being most recom- mended by the faculty; but any kind of meat or poultry, rabbit, &c , may be cut small, and curried the same, as you must have perceived in my series of curries. TO VARY THE FLAVOUR, which is desirable when in good health, introduce a little eschalot or onions, bay-leaf or thyme, or half a clove of scraped garlic, but all according to taste. Indian Pudding.—If you happen to make double the quantity, and any

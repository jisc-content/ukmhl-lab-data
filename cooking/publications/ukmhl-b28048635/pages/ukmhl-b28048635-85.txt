The Dahlia. 8i will be found difficult of course, in their sparkling bright- ness, to get which to perfection one needs to procure some copies of the original for imitation. But whilst the single dahlia is made as in the foregoing instructions the double is not, inasmuch as the separate leaves are curled half way from centre to outside edge, as in the illustra- tion (Fig. 44), and the whole flower is produced by simple Fig. 44. repetition, by placing one leaf of the same pattern or shape side by side the other till a complete circle is pro- duced. This again is repeated, row upon row in diminish- ing sizes, till the top row is reached, when a very much smaller tube is used, or even paper, so that the centre is produced in very small and fine divisions.

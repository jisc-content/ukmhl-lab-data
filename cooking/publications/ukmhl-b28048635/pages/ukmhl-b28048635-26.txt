The border is simple, and the key to its working out is this (Fig. 5) placed round the top edge of the cake, and afterwards going over the top of the outline with Nos. 1 and 2 plain cornets filled with pink icing—a picking-out sort of process. Of course, I need hardly say that the “ sides ” of the cake must be in keeping with the colour on the top of same; and also that one is not to slavishly follow out (and nothing more) the designs I shall give, because that would defeat the object I have in view.

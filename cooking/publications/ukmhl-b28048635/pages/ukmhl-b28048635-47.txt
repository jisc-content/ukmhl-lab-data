Plaque Piping. 43 a very pretty effect is produced by cutting out of wafer paper or any other coloured sheet of confectionery, such as cake or gum-paste, a shape, round, oblong, square, or heart-shape, on which a motto, or “ Many happy re- turns,” and so on, may be prettily written, and placed in the centre of the bunch of flowers, by which means it can be converted into whatever kind of cake one may de- sire, excepting, of course, a wedding cake when it would have to be all done in white and orange. Divide the cake into eight divisions on the rim of top border, and file in the outlines of the threadwork (for the way to mark out and work out designs, consult my book on “ Piping and Ornamentation,” where full instructions are given for this important part of the subject); raise the threadwork layer upon layer, commencing with a No. 3 plain tube, and finishing off the top layer with No. 1, and afterwards pipe the different coloured roses on the nails, and when dry place them in position as in the illustra- tion ; the best colours for roses for this purpose are yellow, red, and salmon, and the leaves a pale green. d 2

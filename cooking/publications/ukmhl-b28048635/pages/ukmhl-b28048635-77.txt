73 The Rose. stick the nails as they are placed out of hand, or a plat of straw made round and tied with string form a very suit- able “stand” for placing the nails when the flower is piped on them ; for the manipulation of the colours one or two china plaques or palettes are useful, as they may be very readily cleaned. My first illustration (Fig. 34) is the “ centre ” of a rose, which part of the rose I attach so much importance to, as to say that if it is not put on the nail correctly it is impossible to get anything like a fair result. Hold the nail in the left hand, and in the right the large flower tube of our 3s. 6d. set—in an horizontal position, and as you press the bag or cornet of paper you will find the sugar curl round as seen in the illustration; turn the nail round at the same time you press the tube, and as you coil the ribbon of sugar be careful to keep the centre sufficiently open, and not allow it to look too solid. Fig. 35 shows how the centre is raised up, as in the case of large roses a high centre is indispensable, or the big leaves cannot be placed to advantage. I would point out here the advisability of having, say, a dozen nails, so that twelve centres may be piped on before the extra leaves are put on, otherwise, the sugar being in a pasty condition, the mass would give too much and lose its form, so that it is necessary to allow the centre of the F

Model and Figure Piping. 47 CHAPTER VIII. MODEL AND FIGURE PIPING. Supposing one desires to produce a model of any building, say St. Paul’s Church, or that beautiful bridge, the Tower Bridge, which I did for the firm of Burton, Son & Sanders, sugar mills, Ipswich, and exhibited in the exhibition of 1895, or say Whippingham Church, Isle of Wight, such as my pupil, Mr. H. Shepard, West Cowes, did. You would first determine the dimensions, and get out your scale and see how it looks in paper or cardboard. In some cases you will find that as one reduces the size of the object to be reproduced, it is anything but attractive, so that the obvious thing to do then is to depart from the orginal pro- portions in whichever particular part the object looks out of proportion, a thing which I did in the case of the bridge above referred to with very good result. Take the following: and one will see that each division is piped on waxed glass, which, when all are ready, are taken off, are fitted together, and the outer railings raised up and ground filled in with sand to finish it off. This little church,* made, of course, so famous owing to our good Queen worshipping within its peaceful walls, is a very charming piece of archi- tecture, and no less beautiful is its details than the beauty of its symmetrical whole; and if any of my readers are ever in that lovely and charming little island, I would advise them to take the invigorating and enthusiastic coach rides for which that island is so noted, and especially the one to “ Ventnor,” and inspect it for them- selves. Another piece of this interesting kind of piping is to be found in my book on “ Piping for Beginners,” page No. 72, plate 5, which consists of six panels, each See Frontispiece.

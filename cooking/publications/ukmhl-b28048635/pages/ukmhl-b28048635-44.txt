40 Cake Decoration and Flower Piping. show them, and shall be pleased to help them all that in my power lies. Marine Panel.—This form of piping is a very effective and fine one, and possesses such an advantage over the ordinary water or oil colour artist as to, in my judgment, entirely eclipse their efforts, and what the artist in oil has to do in light and shade, in sugar pictures this is accom- plished by simply raising the objects with the tube. For instance, take the yacht in the distance, the form is much more easily brought out with the pliable sugar than with the colour of the artist, unaided by anything else. I remember seeing at the exhibition at Niagara Hall, Lon- don, some cakes with flowers and scenes painted on, but the effect gave one such an impression of the “ picture gallery,” that it was on cakes something more than con- fectionery—it was paint, and the only thing wanted to com- plete the effect was the words “ wet paint.” Now had this sketching been relieved wfith the tube, by raising some work above that which I am complaining of, there would not have been such self-evidence of the brush, and its application to the outside of that or those cakes. A background put in with the aid of a brush is tolerable ; but the brush, and that only, is bad taste, more especially as I have already pointed out, “light and shade” can be produced so much more easily and more effectively with the tube. The next illustration is that of a yacht out on the briny ocean, full sail, with just enough wind to fill the sails, and carry her forward on the bosom of the deep —I mean of the cake. The colour is put on in the same manner as in the former panels—pale yellow ground; the sky picked out with pale blue; the clouds filled in with white sugar, and a faint tinge of pale red to give colour to the scene; the waves are first put in with pale blue, and afterwards covered in with white sugar to represent the choppiness of the water, and its surface representing the foreground, with rough sprays of foam, and lastly with very careful mapping out the yacht, which must be sketched in with very fine lines of white sugar, and after- wards filled in with the desired colour of the boat one is

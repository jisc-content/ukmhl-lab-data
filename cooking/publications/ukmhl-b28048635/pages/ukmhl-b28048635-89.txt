85 The Pansy. In concluding this chapter on flowers, let me add, whilst the foregoing flowers and all those which are piped on the nails are very useful in so many ways, I must pro- test in the name of Art against the practice of confec- tioners who, from either lack of proper knowledge or sheer indifference, make a practice of applying flowers to cakes in the most indiscriminating fashion; and this is the more unpardonable seeing that there are so many capital ideas ever around us, for we can hardly look into a stationer’s shop window without seeing something to suggest a not only pleasing but novel design. Some such I have given in this work with the hope and object that they will suggest more. As I have before stated, one will findthat these flowers, sprays, sprigs, and small clusters of flowers and foliage, piped straight on to the cake, with the addition of some piped on the nails, so as to enable the operator to raise in a more prominent position a few above those piped “straight on,” will make the work much more commercial, and at the same time gives much more effect for much less labour. My last illustration, A BASKET OF FLOWERS—ROSES, I give not because it is a cake, but because a cake may be made in the manner in which this basket was made.

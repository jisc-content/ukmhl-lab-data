I am first a teacher, and my duty is to say what I know to be the truth about the right instruments and methods to be used and adopted, and not to puff tubes because I sell them, and for the sake of making more profit at the same time, as I have also said before. Some work,' and, in fact, all our commercial work, re- quires to be turned out so quickly that a few tubes are indispensable for the purpose of doing that kind of work, and to make it pay, but even here the outside number should be fourteen, in which assortment a set of flower tubes should be included. How, then, is still the ques- tion, can leaves of any kind of flower be piped well ? By simply using paper cornets, and in the following manner.

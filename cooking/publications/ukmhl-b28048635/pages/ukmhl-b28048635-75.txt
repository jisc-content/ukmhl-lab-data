Flower Piping in General. 71 I will select the most useful flowers, four in number, which practically covers the whole realm of the flower plain, for, after all, the shapes of flowers when pulled to pieces have a striking resemblance in structure and con- struction to each other. There is, of course, a difference, or else I should have to take one flower, and one only; but still the differences I find are all governed by certain principles, and their production must therefore be governed by certain rules, inasmuch that the underlying principles run through the whole, and the four I have selected to convey my information are all common or well known flowers, which any cottager can grow for himself. They are the rose, the narcissus, the dahlia, and the pansy. These four possess the principal characteristics of all flowers in form. For instance, take a division of the narcissus, and how like it is to the geranium and such type of small flowers, sweet peas, single dahlias, and whilst it may not be generally observed, pull a rose to pieces, and see what a striking resemblance its leaf has to the buttercup, the sunflower, the common daisy, and so forth, possessing so much in common.

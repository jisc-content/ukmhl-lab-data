69 Flower Piping in General. CHAPTER XII. FLOWER PIPING IN GENERAL. The question of flower piping, whilst it has been written about to some extent, has not been dealt with in anything like an exhaustive manner, or in such a way as to give any real and useful inrormation, but, on the contrary, has been in many ways positively misguiding. This is worse than giving no information whatsoever, because the most important thing to be observed in the production of flowers in piping, or in any other way of flower producing artificially, is to study the flowers in their natural beauty and habits; the former for their form and colour, the latter for spray—basket or free- hand piping in general. Apart from the fact of the great charm and pleasure flower cultivation affords one, there are certain particulars in their form and structure which—without a very close observance of the flowers in their natural state—is missed. The absence of such knowledge is very noticeable in the mere imitation, inasmuch that each flower has its own characteristic, without which it ceases to be the flower by which name it is known.

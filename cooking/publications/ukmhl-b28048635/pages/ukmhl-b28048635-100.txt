96 Cake Decoration and Flower Piping. border of the design is in thread-work, which gives rather a bold appearance to finish the whole. Fig- 59 (see preceding page) is a sketch of the top of the cake we did for F. T. Jackson, Esq., of Arctic Region fame, and represents the Snow Mountain, “ Cape Flora,” at the foot of which he was snowed up for three years, where, as is shown at base of model, his huts, &c., were erected, whilst in the foreground stood, in the frozen-up water, his ship. The top is in chocolate, whilst the ship, etc., is in cake, touched here and there with Royal icing, and dusted with icing sugar and sparkle to give a brighter effect. This is one idea out of very many which could be carried out with sugar, and with it I must conclude this, my second book on piping. In again taking leave of my readers, I beg to thank them for the many kind and appreciative letters I have received from them. My only regret in concluding this book is that with its last chapter comes a sort of void, for, whilst writing it, after reading the letters above referred to, a feeling of personal friendship has sprung up between us, and I have felt as if I was talking to someone “ in the flesh,” as we say sometimes in Church.

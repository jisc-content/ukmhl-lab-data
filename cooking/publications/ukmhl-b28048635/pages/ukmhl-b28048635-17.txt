The Forward Movement of Piping. 13 mens of work in cakes which I have seen in London side by side—one to look at, the other made to eat. The remedy is simple. Let there be a competition for the best specimen of work which can be sold for so much a pound, and also one for the best specimen of a work of art in sugar piping. Then we shall not only en- courage the exercise of the artistic faculty, but also, which is of very great importance, increase the value of the production as a commercial commodity, and, last, but not “ least of all,” the ability of the general work- man. The competition of general workmen in the halls of the exhibitions is a good feature and greatly to be commended, and it is not surprising to see in them the younger generation producing far and away better results with the tube than men old enough to be their fathers, which fact speaks well for the future of our trade, and for the superiority of the new methods over the old. One word more. It has been suggested in some quarters that the original designs, &c., of this and my other work are merely sketches, and not actual repro- ductions from real sugar work. This, I need hardly point out to any intelligent wielder of the “tube,” is untrue, the originals in sugar which have been piped specially for this work being still in my possession.

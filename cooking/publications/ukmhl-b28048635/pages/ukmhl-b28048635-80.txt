76 Cake Decoration and Flower Piping. done, loses the effect you desire to give the flower, inas- much that you lose sight of the edge of the curl; so that I would advise only a half curl for the greatest possible effect in the least amount of work, which, after all, is a great consideration in these days of keen competition, is it not? Fig. 39. Fig. 39 shows the finishing of the leaf in the curl- ing, which by a downward tendency gives the finish to it and joins the last part to the one underneath, so as to show as little of the join as possible, and at the same time leave the ground clear for the finishing leaf, which in this, as in other flowers, is very necessary to have it done neatly. The next illustration (Fig. 40) shows the finish of the rose and how it is placed, but care must be taken to so neatly glide the tube round the rose in this finishing touch as to leave no trace of the place last touched by the tube. So many people in the trade can pipe a flower fairly well, but if you examine their work the unfinished finish of the rose is so discernible that it spoils whatever there may be of any beauty in the other parts of the flower; so be careful of the finish and do not leave it in an ^finished state.

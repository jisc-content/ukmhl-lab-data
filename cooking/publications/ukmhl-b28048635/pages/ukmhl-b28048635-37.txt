Some Fancy Designs. 33 is a double, and one of those borders which, when it is placed in position properly, requires little else to finish the cake. Being very deep on the side and on the top, it almost covers the entire surface. The key to the de- sign is the “wave curve” (see “Piping and Ornamenta- tion”) neatly laid along the edge of the cake in equal divisions—say eight or six ; then, with a No. 4 or No. 3 plain tube, the length strings are put in, and afterwards the cress threads are brought over, and gradually brought up to the top with Nos. 3, 2, and 1 plain tubes, the design being afterwards developed with a No. 5 star and No. 2 plain tube. The whole is then finished off with a No. 2 and No. 1 plain tube, raising the parts up to a fine edge very evenly. This border is particularly effective for Christmas or New Year if done in two colours—say, yellow and orange, or pink and pale green, picked out with chocolate or coffee.

44 Cake Decoration and Flower Piping. CHAPTER VII. BORDERS. W ith the panels in Chapter VI. a very good border is the following, as it allows one to work it in, and fill in or completely fill in the side of the cake. It is marked out Fig. 18.â€”Cornucopia Design. in the shape of two cornucopias on the edge of the cake, and afterwards filled in (like the stomach of the boy at the missionary meeting who had more mouth than ear) till it is well bulged, finishing the edges and centre with some fine raised scroll work. Take this one, which, as will be seen, lends itself perhaps more to panels than any other design.

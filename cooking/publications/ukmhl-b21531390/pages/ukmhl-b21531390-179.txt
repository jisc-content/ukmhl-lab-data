MODERATE FORTUNE. 171 difficulty be made to attend to her own personal comfort; and even the most patient are worn out with her perpetual fretfulness. Her mind is continually infested with envy, hatred, and dis- content. She thinks Providence has dealt hardly with her; that all the world are proud and un- grateful ; and that every one despises her because she is in the alms-house. This pitiable state of mind is the natural resull^ of her education. Her father was a respectable mechanic, and might have been a wealthy one, had he not been fascinated by the beauty of a thoughtless, idle, showy girl, whom he made his wife. The usual consequences followedâ€”he could not earn money so fast as she could spend it; the house became a scene of discord; the daughter dressed in the fashion; learned to play on the piano; was taught to think that being engaged in any useful em- ployment was very ungenteel; and that to be engaged to he married was the chief end and aim of woman; the father died a bankrupt; the weak and frivolous mother lingered along in beggary, for a while, and then died of vexation and shame. The friends of the family were very kind to the daughter; but her extreme indolence, her vanity, pertness, and ingratitude, finally exhausted the kindness of the most generous and forbearing; and as nothing could induce her to personal ex- ertion, she was at length obliged to take shelter in the alms-house. Here her misery is incurable.

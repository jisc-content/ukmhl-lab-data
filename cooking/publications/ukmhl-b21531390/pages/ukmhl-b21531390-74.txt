THE FRUGAL G6 quantity of vinegar; salt as you think fit, and cloves, allspice, and cinnamon, at the rate of a quarter of a pound to a hundred weight: to be poured on scalding hot. TRIPE. Tripe should be kept in cold water, or it will become too dry for cooking. The water in which it is kept should be changed more or less fre- quently, according to the warmth of the weather. Broiled like a steak, buttered, peppered, &c. Some people like it prepared like souse. GRAVY. Most people put half a pint of flour and water into their tin-kitchen, when they set meat down to roast. This does very well; but gravy is better flavoured, and looks darker, to shake flour and salt upon the meat; let it brown thoroughly, put flour and salt on again, and then baste the meat with about half a pint of hot water (or more, according to the gravy you want). When the meat is about done,* pour these drippings into a skillet, and let it boil. If it is not thick enough, shake in a little flour; but be sure to let it boil, and be well stirred, after the flour is in. If you fear it will be too greasy, take off a cupful of the fat before you boil. The fat of beef, pork, tur- keys, and geese, is as good for shortening as lard. Salt gravy to your taste. If you are very particular about dark gravies, keep your dredging box full of scorched flour for that purpose.

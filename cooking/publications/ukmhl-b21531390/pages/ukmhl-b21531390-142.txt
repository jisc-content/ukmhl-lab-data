134 RURAL ECONOMY, ETC. LAMP'GLASSES. A VERY simple but effective precaution is em- ployed in Paris, to prevent the breaking of lamp glasses by the sudden application of heat. Be- fore they are used, a glazier cuts or scratches the base of the glass with a diamond, and afterwards sudden heat may be applied without danger. o TO MEND CHINA. Take a piece of flint glass, beat it to a fine powder, and grind it extremely fine on a painterâ€™s stone with the white of an egg, and it joins China without riveting, so that no art can break it in the same place. TO RENDER SHOES WATER-PROOF. Mix a pint of drying oil, two ouiices of yellow wax, two ounces of turpentine, and half an ounce of Burgundy pitch, carefully over a slow fire. Lay the mixture, whilst hot, on the boots or shoes with a sponge or soft brush; and when they are dry, lay it on again and again, until the leather becomes quite saturated, that is to say, will hold no more. Let them then be put away, and not be worn until they are perfectly dry and elastic; they will afterwards be found not only impenetrable to wet, but soft and pliable, and of much greater durability.

133 RURAL ECONOMY, ETC. EFFECT OF HOT WATER ON FLOWERS. The following fact is deserving of record, as an interesting addition to what has hitherto been discovered on the subject of vegetable physi- ology, and as enabling the lovers of flowers to prolong for a day the enjoyment of their short- lived beauty. Most flowers begin to fade after being kept twenty-four hours in water; a few may be revived by substituting fresh water; but all the most fugacious (such as the poppy, and perhaps one or two others, excepted)^ may be completely restored by the use of hot water. For this purpose place the flowers in scalding water, deep enough to cover about one-third of the length of the stem, and by the time the water has become cold, the flowers will have become erect and fresh; then cut off the coddled ends, and put the flowers into cold water. WATER COLOUR FOR ROOMS. Take a quantity of potatoes and boil themâ€”then bruise them, and pour on boiling water until a pretty thick mixture is obtained, which is to be passed through a sieve. With boiling water then make a thick mixture of whitening, and put it to the potatoe mixture. To give colour, if white is not wanted, add the different-coloured ochres, lampblack, &c. according to circumstances. This,paint dries quickly, is very durable, and has a good appearance to the eye.

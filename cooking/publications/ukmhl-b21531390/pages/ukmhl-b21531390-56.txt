THE FRUGAL 48 or bark scraped from the barberry bush, colours a common bright yellow. In all these cases, a little piece of alum does no barm, and may help to fix the colour. Kibbons, gauze handkerchiefs, &c. are coloured well in this way, especially if they be stiffened by a bit of gum-arabic, dropped in while the stuff is steeping. The purple paper, which comes on loaf sugar, boiled in cider, or vinegar, with a small bit of alum, makes a fine purple slate colour. Done in iron. White maple bark makes a good light-brown slate colour. This should be boiled in water, set with alum. The colour is reckoned better when boiled in brass, instead of iron. The purple slate and the brown slate are suitable colours for stockings; and it is an economical plan, after they have been mended and cut down, so that they will no longer look decent, to colour old stockings, and make them up for children. A pailful of lye, with a piece of copperas half as big as a henâ€™s egg boiled in it, will make a fine nankin colour, which will never wash out. This is very useful for the linings of bed-quilts, comforters, &c. Old faded gowns, coloured in this way, may be made into good petticoats. Cheap cotton cloth may be coloured to advantage for petticoats, and pelisses for little girls. A very beautiful nankin colour may likewise be obtained from birch-bark, set with alum. The

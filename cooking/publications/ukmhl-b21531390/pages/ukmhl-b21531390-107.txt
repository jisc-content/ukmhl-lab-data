HOUSEWIFE. 99 keep any length of time. Three ounces of hops in a pail of water boiled down to a quart; strain it, and stir in a quart of rye meal while boiling hot. Cool it, and add half a pint of good yeast; after it has risen a few hours, thicken it with flour stiff enough to roll out upon a board ; then put it in the sun and air a few days to dry. A piece of this cake two inches square, dissolved in warm water, and thickened with a little flour, will make a large loaf of bread. Potatoes make very good yeast. Mash three large potatoes fine; pour a pint of boiling water ^ over them; when almost cold, stir in two spoon- fuls of flour, two of molasses, and a cup of good yeast. This yeast should be used while new. PRESERVES, ETC. Economical people will seldom use preserves, except for sickness. They are unhealthy, ex- pensive, and useless to those who are well. Barberries preserved in molasses are very good for common use. Boil the molasses, skim it, throw in the barberries, and simmer them till they are soft. If you wish to lay by a few for sickness, preserve them in sugar by the same rule as other preserves. Melt the sugar, skim it, throw in the barberries; when done soft, take them out, and throw in others.

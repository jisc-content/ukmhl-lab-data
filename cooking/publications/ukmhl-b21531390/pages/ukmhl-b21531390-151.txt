MODERATE FORTUNE. 143 easy to know how to spend riches, and always safe to know how to bear poverty. ^ A superficial acquaintance with such accom- plishments as music and drawing is useless and undesirable. They should not be attempted un- less there is taste, talent, and time enough to attain excellence. I have frequently heard young women of moderate fortune say, I have not opened my piano these five years. I wish 1 had the money expended upon it. If I had employed as much time in learning useful things, I should have been better fitted for the cares of my family.^^ By these remarks I do not mean to dft;courage an attention to the graces of life. Gentility and taste are always lovely in all situations. But good things, carried to excess, are often produc- tive of bad consequences. When accomplish- ments and dress interfere with the duties and permanent happiness of life, they are unjustifiable and displeasing; but where there is a solid foun- dation in mind and heart, all those elegancies are but becoming ornaments. Some are likely to have more use for them than others; and they are justified in spending more time and money upon them. But no one should b-. taught to consider them valuable for mere parade and attraction. Making the educa- tion of girls such a series of man-traps,^â€™ makes the whole system unhealthy, by poisoning the motive.

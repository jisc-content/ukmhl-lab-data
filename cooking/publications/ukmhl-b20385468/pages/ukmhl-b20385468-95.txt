91 THYMUS VULGARIS (Linn.). The Garden Thyme ( Thymus vulgaris) the little aromatic sweet herb so familiar to us for its culinary use in stuffings, flavour- ings, etc., is an ' improved' cultivated form of the Wild Thyme of the mountains of Spain and other European countries bordering on the Mediterranean, flourishing also in Asia Minor, Algeria and Tunis, and is a near relation to our own Wild Thyme, Thymus serpyllum, which however has broader leaves (the margins not reflexed as in the Garden Thyme) and also a weaker odour. It is cultivated now in most countries with temperate climates, though it does not seem to have had any reputation in antiquity as a culinary herb, nor do we know at what period it was first intro- duced into northern countries, but for many centuries it has held an important place in the English kitchen-garden, especially before the introduction of Oriental spices, when, with other aromatic herbs, it was even more used in cookery than now. It was certainly com- monly cultivated in England before the middle of the sixteenth century : how long previous to that is not known, but it was well figured and described by Gerarde. The name Thyme, in its Greek form, was first given to the plant by the Greeks as a derivative from a word which meant 4 to fumigate,' either because they used it as their incense, for its balsamic odour, or because it was taken as a type of all such sweet- smelling herbs. The antiseptic properties of Thyme were fully recognised in classic times, there being a reference in Virgil's Gtorgics to its use as a fumigator, and Pliny tells us that when burnt, it puts to flight all venomous creatures. Another theory as to the deriva- tion of the name is that it comes from the Greek word ihumus, signi- fying courage, the plant being held in ancient and medieeval times to be a great source of invigoratioiij its cordial qualities inspiring courage. It was, besides, an emblem of activity, bravery and energy, and in the days of chivalry, it was the custom for ladies to embroider the device of a bee hovering over a sprig of Thyme on the scarves they presented to their knights. In the south of France, Wild Thyme is a symbol of extreme Republicanism, tufts of it being sent with the summons to a meeting to members of a society holding those views. Strangely enough, thie little plant, so familiar also in its wild form, has never been known in this country by any other common

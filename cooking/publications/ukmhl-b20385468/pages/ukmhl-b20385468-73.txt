Sprigs of fresh parsley form the most favourite garnish to cold dishes, and it is also often fried whole as a garnish. The leaves are extensively cultivated, not only for sending to market fresh, but also for the purpose of being dried and powdered as a culinary flavouring in winter, when only a limited supply of the fresh parsley is obtainable. There is always a market for dried parsleyâ€”as much as 2/- per lb. being given by wholesale buyers for first-class dried parsley when demand is keen, though the usual price is lOd. to 1/- per lb. In addition to the leaves, the stems are also dried and powdered, both as a culinary colouring and for dyeing purposes.

Medicinally, the two-year old roots are employed, also the leaves, dried, for making Parsley Tea, and the seeds, for the extraction of an oil called Apiol, which is of considerable curative value. The best kind of seed for medicinal purposes is that obtained from the Triple Moss curled variety.

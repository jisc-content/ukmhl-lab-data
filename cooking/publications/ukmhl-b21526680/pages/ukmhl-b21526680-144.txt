DOMESTIC COOKERY. 120 When the anchovies are good they â– will be dissolved ; and the colour will be better than by the usual way. To melt Butter, which is rarely well done, though a very essential article. Mix in the proportion of a tea-spoonful of flour to four ounces of the best butter, on a treucher. Put it into a small sauce-pan, and two or three table-spoonfuls of hot water, boil quick a minute, shaking it all the time. Milk used instead of water requires rather less butter, and looks whiter. Vingaret, for cold Fowl, or Meat. Chop mint, parsley, and shalot, mix with salt, oil, and vinegar. Serve in a boat. Shalot Vinegar. Split six or eight shalots ; put them into a quart bot- tle, and fill it up with vinegar, stop it, and in a month it will be fit for use. Camp Vinegar. Slice a large head of garlick ; and put it into a wide- mouthed bottle, with half an ounce of Cayenne, two tea-spoonsful of real soy, two of walnut ketchup, four anchovies chopped, a pint of vinegar, and enough cochi- neal to give it the colour of lavender-drops. Let it stand six weeks; then strain off quite clear, and keep in small bottles sealed up. Sugar Vinegar. To every gallon of water put two pounds of the very coarsest sugar, boil and skim thoroughly, then put one quart of cold water for every gallon of hot. When cool, put into it a toast spread with yeast. Stir it nine days ; then barrel, and set it in a place were the sun will lie on it, with a bit of slate on the bung-hole. Make it in March ; it will be ready in six months. AVhen sufficiently sour, it may be bottled, or maybe used from the cask with a wooden spigot and faucet. Oooseherry Vinegar. Boil spring water; and when cold, put to every three quarts, a quart of bruised gooseberries in a large tub.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. I3i Pigeon pie. Eub the pigeons with pepper and salt, inside and out; in thefonnerput a bit of butter, and if approved, some parsley chopped with the livers, and a little of the same seasoning. Lay a beef steak at the bottom of the dish, and the birds on it; between every two a hard egg. Put a cup of water iu the dish; and if you have any ham in the house, lay a bit on each pi- geon : it is a great improvement to the flavour. Observe when ham is cut for gravy or pies, to take the under part rather than the prime. Season the gizzards, and the two joints of the wings, and put them in the centre of the pie; and over them in a hole made in the crust, three feet nicely cleaned to show what pie it is. Partridge pie, in a dish. Pick and singe four partridges; cut off the legs at the knee; season with pepper, salt, chopped parsley, thyme, and mushrooms. Lay a veal steak, and a slice of ham, at the bottom of the dish; put the partridges in, and half a pint of good broth. Put puff pas];e on the edge of the dish, and cover with the same; brush it over with egg, and bake an hour. Hare pie, to eat cold. Season the hare after it is cut up; and bake it, with eggs and forcemeat, in a raised crust or dish. When it is to be served, cut off the lid, and cover it with jelly-gravy, as in page 111. A French pie. Lay a puff paste round on the ledge of the dish; and put in either veal in slices, rabbits or chickens jointed; with forcemeat balls, sweetbreads cut in pieces, artichoke-bottoms, and a few truffles. Vegetable pie. Scald and blanch somebroad beans; cut young carrots, turnips, artichoke-bottoms, mushrooms, peas, onions, lettuce, parsley, or any of them you have; make the whole into a nice stew with some good veal gravy. 1

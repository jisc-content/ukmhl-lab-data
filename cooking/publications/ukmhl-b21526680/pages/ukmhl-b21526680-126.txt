102 D0M:ESTIC COOKETIT. Wlien there is plenty of vegetables, no meat is necessary; but if meat be preferred, a pig’s foot, or ham-bone, &c. may be boiled with the old peas, which is called the stock. More butter than is mentioned above may be used with advantage, if the soup is re- quired to be very rich. When peas first come in, or are very young, the stock may be made of the shells washed, and boiled till they will pulp with the above: more thickening will then be wanted. Gravy Soup. Wash and soak a leg of beef; break the bone, and set it on the fire with a gallon of water, a large bunch of sweet herbs, two large onions sliced and fried a fine brown (but not burnt), two blades of mace, three cloves, twenty berries of allspice, and forty black peppers. Stew till the soup is as rich as you choose ; then take out the meat, which will be fit for the servants’ table with a little of the gravy. Next day take off the cake of fat; which wall serve for basting, or for common pie-crust. Have ready such vegetables as you choose to serve. Cut carrots, turnips, and celery, small, and simmer till tender: some people do not like them to be sent to table, only the flavour of them. Boil vermicelli a quar- ter of an hour; and add to it a large spoonful of soy, and one of mushroom-ketchup. A French roll should be made hot, put into the soup till moist through, and served in the tureen. Yegetahle Soup. P.are and slice five or six cucumbers; and add to these the inside of as many cos-lettuces, a sprig or two of mint, two or three onions, some pepper and salt, a pint and a half of yoimg peas, and a little parsley. Put these, wdth half a pound of fresh butter, into a sauce-pan, to stew in their own liquor, near a gentle fire, half an hour : then pour two quarts of boiling water to the vegetables, and stew them two hours; rub down a little flour into a tea-cupful of water, boil it with the rest fifteen or or twenty minutes, and serve it.

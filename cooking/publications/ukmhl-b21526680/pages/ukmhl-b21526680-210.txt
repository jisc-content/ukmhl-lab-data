1S6 DOMESTIC COOKEUT. Mushroom Ketchup, another way. Take a stew-pau fall of the large-flap mushrooms, that are not worm eaten, and the skins and fringe of those you have pickled, throw a handful of salt among them, and set them by a slow fire ; they wall produce a great deal of liquor, which you must strain; and put to it 4 ounces of shalots, two cloves of garlick, a good deal of pepper, ginger, mace, cloves, and a few bay-leaves, boil and skim very well. When cold, cork close. In two months boil it up again with a little fresh spice and a stick of horse-radish, and it willthenkeep the year; which mush- room ketchup rarely does, if not boiled a second time. Walnut Ketchup, of the finest sort. Boil or simmer a gallon of the expressed juice of walnuts when they are tender, and skim it well; then put in two pounds of anchovies, hones and liquor, ditto of shalots, one ounce of cloves, ditto of mace, ditto of pepper, and one clove of garlick. Let all sim- mer till the shalots sink; then put the liquor into a pan till cold; bottle and divide the spice to each. Cork closely, and tie a bladder over.

Some people make liquor of the out- side shell when the nut is ripe; but neither the flavour nor the colour is then so fine. CocTde Ketchup. Open the cockles, scald them in their own liquor; add a little water when the liquor settles, if you have not enough; strain through a cloth, then season with every savoury spice ; and if for brown sauce, add port, anchovies, and garlickâ€”if for white, omit these, and put a glass of sherry, lemon-juice and peel, mace, nut- meg, and white pepper. If for brown, burn a bit of sugar for colouring. It is better to have cockles enough than to add water; and they are cheap. To keep Capers. Add fresh vinegar that has been scalded, and become

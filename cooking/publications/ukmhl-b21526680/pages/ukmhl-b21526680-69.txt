VEAL. 43 Knuckle of Veal. As few people are fond of boiled veal, it may be well to leave the knuckle small, and take off some cutlets or collops before it be dressed; but as the knuckle will keep longer than the fillet, it is best not to cut off the slices till wanted. Break the bones to make it take less room: wash it well; and put it into a sauce-pan with thi’ee onions, a blade of mace or two, and a few pepper-corns; cover it with water, and simmer till quite retuly. In the meantime some macaroni should be boiled with it if approved, or rice, or a little rice flour, to give it a small degree of thickness: but don't put too much. Before it is served, add half-a-pint of milk and cream, and let it comeup eitherwithor without the meat. Or fry the knuckle with sliced onions and butter to a good brown ; and have ready peas, lettuces, onion, and a cucumber or two, stewed In a small quantity of water an hour: then add these to the veal; and stew it till the nicat is tender enough to eat, but not overdone. Throw in pepper, salt, and a bit of shred mint, and serve all together. Shoulder of Veal. Cut off the knuckle, for a stew or gravy. Boast the other part with stuffing: you may lard it. Serve with melted butter. The blade-bone, with a good deal of meat left on, eats extremely well with mushroom or oystei’-sauce, or mushroom ketchup in butter. Keek of Veal. Cut off the scrag to boil, and cover it with onion- sauce. It should be boiled in milk and water. Pars- ley and butter may be served with it, instead of onion- sauce. Or it may be stewed ^vith whole rice, small onions, and pepper corns, with a very little water. Or boiled and eaten with bacon and greens. The best end m.ay be either roasted, broiled as steaks, or made into pies.

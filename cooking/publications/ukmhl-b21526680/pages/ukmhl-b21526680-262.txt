Let it stand before the fire a few minutes before it goes to the oven, add seeds, 6r currants, audbake an hour and a half. Another.—Mix a pound and a half of flour, and a pound of common lump-sugar, eight eggs beaten sepa- rately, an ounce of seeds, two spoonfuls of yeast, and the same of milk and water. Note.—Milk alone causes cake and bread soon to dry. Common Bread caTce, Take the quantity of a quartern loaf from the dough, when making white bread, and knead well into it two ounces of butter, two of Lisbon sugar, and eight of cur- rants. AV^arm the butter in a tea-cupful of good milk. By the addition of an ounce of butter, or sugar, or an egg or two, you may make the cake better. A tea- cupful of raw cream improves it much. It is best to baiie it in a pan, rather than as a loaf, the outside being less hard. Queen calces. Mix a pound of dried flour, the same of sifted sugar, and of washed clean currants. AV^ash a pound of but- ter in rose-water, beat it well, then mix with it eiglit eggs, yolks and whites beaten separately, and put in the dry ingredients by degrees ; beat the whole an hour ; butter little tius, tea-cups, or saucers, and bake the batter in, filling only half. Sift a little fine sugar over.just as you put into the oven. Another way.—Beat eight ounces of butter, and mix with two well-beaten eggs, strained; mix eight ounces of dried flour, and the same of lump-sugar, and the grated rind of a lemon, then add the whole toge- ther, and beat full half an hour with a silver spoon.

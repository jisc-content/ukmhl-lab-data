DOMESTIC COOKERY. 152 Common Pancalces. Make a light batter of eggs, flour, and milk. Fry in a small pan, in hot dripping or lard. Salt, or nutmeg, and ginger, may be added. Sugar and lemon should be served to eat with them. Or when eggs are scarce, make the batter with flour, and small beer, ginger, &c.; or clean snow with flour and a very little milk, will serve as well as egg. Fine PancaTces, fried without butter or lard. Beat six fresh eggs extremely well; mix, when strained, with a pint of cream, four ounces of sugar, a glass of wine, half a nutmeg grated, and as much flour as will make it almost as thick as ordinary pancake batter, but not quite. Heat the frying-pan tolerably hot, wipe it with a clean cloth ; then pour in the batter, to make thin pancakes. PancaTces of Pice. Boil half a pound of rice to a jelly in a small quantity of water ; when cold mix it with a pint of cream, eight eggs, a bit of salt and nutmeg: stir in eight ounces of butter just warmed, and add as much flour as will make the batter thick enough. Fry in as little lard or drip- ping as possible. IrisTi PancaTces. Beat eight yolks and four whites of eggs, strain them into a pint of cream, put a grated nutmeg, and sugar to your taste; set three ounces of fresh butter on Ho fire, stir it, and as it warms pour it to the cream, which should be warm when the eggs are put to it; then mix smooth almost half a pint of flour. Fry the pancakes very thin; the first with a bit of butter, but not the others. Serve several on one another. New-England PancaTces. Mix a pint of cream, five spoonfuls of fine flour, seven yolks and four whites of eggs, and a very little salt; fry them very thin in fresh butter, and between each strew sugar and cinnamon.

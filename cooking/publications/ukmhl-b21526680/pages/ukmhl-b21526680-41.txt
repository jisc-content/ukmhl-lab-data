17 FISH. EELS. SpitcTicocJc JEels. Take one or two large eels, leave the skin on, cut them into pieces of three inches long, open them on the holly side, and clean them nicely: wipe them dry, and then wet them with beaten egg, and strew over on both sides chopped parsley, pepper, salt, a very little sage, and a bit of mace pounded fine and mixed with the seasoning. Rub the gridiron with a bit of suet, and broil the fish of a fine colour. Serve with anchovy and butter for sauce. Fried FeU. If small, they should be curled round and fried, being first dipped into egg and crumbs of bread. Boiled Eels. The small ones are best; do them in a small qnan- tity of water, with a good deal of parsley, which should be served up with them in the liquor. Serve chopped parsley and butter for sauce.

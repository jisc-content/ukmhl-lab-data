FISH. 5 If fish is to be fried or broiled, it must be wrapt in a nice soft cloth after it is well cleansed and washed.— "When perfectly dry, wet with an egg, if for frying, and sprinkle the finest crumbs of bread over it; if done a second time with the egg and bread, the fish will look much better; then having a thick-bottomed frying-pan on the fire, ■with a large quantity of lard or dripping boiling hot, plunge the fish into it, and let it fry mid- dling quick, tni the colour is a fine brown yellow, and it is judged ready. If it is done enough before it has obtained a proper degree of colour, the cook should draw the pan to the side of the fire ; carefully take it up, and place it either on a large sieve turned upwards, and to be kept for that purpose only, or on the under side of a dish to drain, and if wanted very nice, a sheet of cap paper must be put up to receive the fish, which should look a beautiful colour, and all the crumbs ap- pear distinct; the fish being free from all grease. The same dripping, ■with a little fresh, will serve a second time. Butter gives a bad colour: oil fries of the finest colour for those who will allow the expense. Garnish with a fringe of curled raw parsley, or pars- ley fried, which must be thus done: AVhen washed and picked, throw it again into clean water ; when the lard or dripping boils, throw the parsley into it immediately from the water, and instantly it will be green and crisp, and must be taken up with a slice : this may be done after the fish is fried. If fish is to be broiled, it must be seasoned, floured, and put on a gridiron that is very clean; which, when hot, should be rubbed with a bit of suet to prevent the fish from sticking. It must be broiled on a very clear fire, that it may not taste smoky; and not too near, that it may not be scorched. TUEBOX. To Iceep Turbot. II’ necessary, tui-bot will keep for two or three days,

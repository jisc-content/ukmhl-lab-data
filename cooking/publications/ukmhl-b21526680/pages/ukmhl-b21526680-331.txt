Dip a I’ag into it, and rub it thick on the stove, &c. and the steel will never rust, even if wet. "When it is to be used, the grease must be washed off with hot water, and the steel be dried before polishing. To take Rust out of Steel. Cover the steel with sweet-oil well rubbed in, and in forty-eight hours use unslacked lime finely powdered, and rub until all the rust disappears.

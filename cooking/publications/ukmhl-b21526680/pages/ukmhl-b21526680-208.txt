184 DOMESTIC COOKEET. Repeat the boiling vinegar, and stop them up again in- stantly ; and so on till green ; the last time put pepper and ginger. Keep in small stone jars. To Piclcle young Cucumbers. Choose nice young gherkins, spread them on dishes, salt them, and let them lie a week—drain them, and put- ting them in ajar, pour boiling vinegar over them. Set them near the fire, covered with plenty of vine-leaves; if they do not become a tolerably good green pour the vinegar into another jar, set it over the hot hearth, and when it boils pour it over tliem again, covering with fresh leaves; and thus do till they are of as good a colour as you wish ;—but as it is now known that the very fine green pickles are made so by using brass or bell- metal vessels, which when vinegar is put into them, be- come highly poisonous, few people like to eat them.

Another way.—Put them into ajar, cover them with the best vinegar cold, let them stand four months; then pour off the pickle and boil as much fresh vinegar as will cover the walnuts, adding to every three quarts of vinegar one quarter-pound of best Durham mustard, a

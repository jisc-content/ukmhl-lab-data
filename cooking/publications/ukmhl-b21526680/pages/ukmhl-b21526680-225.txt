Pare and halve, or quarter, large pears, according to their size; throw them into water, as the skin is taken oft' before they are divided, to prevent their turning black. Pack them round a block-tin stew-pan, and sprinkle as much sugar over as will make them pretty sweet, and add lemon-peel, a clove or two, and some allspice cracked ; just cover them with water, and put some of the red liquor, as directed in another article.

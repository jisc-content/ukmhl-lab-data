To two gallons of spring-water put two pounds of coarse sugar, two pounds of bay, and two pounds and a half of common salt, and half a pound of saltpetre, in a deep earthen glazed pan that will hold four gallons, and with a cover that will fit close. Keep the beef or hams as long as they will bear, before you put them into the pickle ; and sprinkle them with coarse sugar in a pan, from which they must drain. Eub the hams, &c. Avell with the pickle, and pack them in close ; putting as much as the pan will hold, so that the pickle may cover them. The pickle is not to be boiled at first. A small ham may lie fourteen days, a large one three weeks ; a tongue twelve days, and beef in proportion to its size. They wiU eat well out of the pickle without drying. AVhen they are to be dried, let each piece be drained over the pan; and Avhen it will drop no longer, take a clean sponge and dry it thoroughly. Six or eight hours Avill smoke them, and there should be only a little saw- dust and wet straAV burnt to do this ; but if put into a baker’s chimney, sew them in coarse cloth, and hang them a week.

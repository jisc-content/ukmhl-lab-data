XIV. AilvertuemenU. FRUGALITY. oo2:0{00 Many persons are of the opinion that they must begin in a large way, if they are to begin to save at all, or otherwise their efforts are of no avail. This is quite a mistake; he who begins to save in a small way will soon notice the effects of the effort. In the daily expenses incurred for the kitchen and cupboard, ofttimes something could be saved, but the necessary knowledge is wanting. For instance, many housewives think they are acting in a sparing manner when they purchase cheap packet, or loose cocoa, because they do not know that really good cocoa (like Van Houten’s) by going farther, can be used more economically. Sometimes, too, people hesitate, although unwisely, before purchasing a really sound article, because the price appears a little high. But a very little practical experience will convince anyone fliat Van Houten’s Cocoa can be used so economically that it really is the cheapest in the end. Above all, it will be found extremely nourishing and easily digestible, while its delicious flavor never palls on the taste by the most frequent use.

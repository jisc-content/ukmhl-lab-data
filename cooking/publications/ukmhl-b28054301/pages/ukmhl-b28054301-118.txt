I] 14 THE EXHIBITION COOKERY BOOK. 235. TO MAKE COCOA Put a teaspoonful of Van Houten’s cocoa into the cup, withdraw the spoon, pour on the boiling water, then stir and add the sugar to taste. , To make larger quantities of cocoa, put a teaspoonful for each cup required into a dry jug which has been previously thoroughly warmed, pour on boiling water, then stir and serve into cups adding sugar to taste. Most cocoas require boiling in milk, but with Van Houten’s cocoa this is not necessary. All that is required is to see that water is boiling when poured on the cocoa, as otherwise a perfect cup of cocoa cannot be made.

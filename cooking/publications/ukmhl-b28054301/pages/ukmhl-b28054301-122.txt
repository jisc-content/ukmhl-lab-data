THE EXIIIJUTION COOKKKV BOOK. Il8 \ ■ fermentation. J^ut straiglit from Messrs. Cliivers’ own fields, t)f those of neighbours on the spot on whom they can rely, comes the absolutely fresh fruit to the factory, and is boiled up into Jam in silver-lined, steam-jacketed pans. The result is an absolutely pure and thoroughly high-class article, which has met with the most brilliant success. Other results have been equally satisfactory. Half a century ago there was scarcely fifty acres of fruit in the neighbourhood, to-day there are thousands. Messrs. Chivers own several thousand acres themselves, a large portion of which is planted with fruit, while they purchase the produce of neighbouring fruit-growers ; and although we read that in certain agricultural districts the value of land has woefully declined, yet in the neighbourhood of Histon it has risen fully ten pounds per acre. This remarkable fact speaks for itself. The buildings of the factory cover more than three acres of ground. The store rooms seem endless. You can stroll through streets of Jam-pots. • The boiling rooms are large, light, and airy, and in the season may be seen half a hundred pans sputtering with boiling fruit. Further, the firm have added the preservation of whole (Greengages and Plums in syrup to their Jam manufacture, while to assist in keeping their large staff busy when the fruit season is finished, they make Patent Custard Powders, manufacture Marmalade, and among other things produce Mince-meat in glass jars. This last has developed into a very large trade, several tons per week being sent out in the au,tumn months.

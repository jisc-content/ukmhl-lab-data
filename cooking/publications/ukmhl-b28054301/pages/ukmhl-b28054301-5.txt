The Exhibition Cookery Book, —♦— SOUPS. I. STOCK FOR SOUPS AND SAUCES. iUmo.st any kind of meat, bones, and trimmings of cooked and raw meat, can be used for making stock. The usual proportions are i lb. of meat, etc., to every quart of water. Put the meat and bones (the latter should be cracked) in a stock-pot or a large well-tinned saucepan, add the required quantity of cold water and a little salt, and let it come to the boil. Remove the scum and add one or two carrots, one turnip, and one or two onions, all of which should first be washed and peeled. A bunch of herbs, one bayleaf, and some peppercorns added to the stock while cooking wil] improve the flavour. The whole must simmer slowly for at least tour hours before it is fit for use. Stock is used for making soups, gravy, and sauces, instead of using water.

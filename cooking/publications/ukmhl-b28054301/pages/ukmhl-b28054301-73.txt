THE EXHIBITION COOKERY BOOK. 6q Separate the yolks of eggs from the whites, and put the former in a basin with the sugar, beating the contents of the basin thoroughly as each yolk is added. Whisk the whites of eggs to a very stiff froth, and keep on the ice till wanted. The pinch of salt should be added to the whites of eggs before they are whisked. Add the remainder of ingredients with the exception of the butter and the yolks, and work the mixture for at least ten minutes longer. Butter a souffle dish, pile the prepared mixture on to it, smooth over with a wetted knife, dredge with castor sugar, and make an incision with the blade of a knife. Bake in a brisk oven for about 15 or 20 minutes, and send to table as soon as it leaves the oven. In place of liqueurs a few drops of vanilla essence may be used. Soak the gelatine in half a cup of cold milk fifteen minutes. Beat the yolks of the eggs and sugar together and put into a doulble boiler with the remaining milk. Stir over the fire until it begins to thicken (but do not let it boil), then add the gelatine, stir till dissolved and strain into a large basin. Put in a cold place, and when it begins to- cool add the whisked whites of eggs, flavouring and the whipped cream. Mix thoroughly, and when beginning to set, pour into a mould previously lined with the finger biscuits. 135. CHARLOTTE RUSSE.

THE EXHIBITION COOKERY BOOK. 2S 40. ROAST CHICKEN. Pick, draw, singe, and truss a chicken, roast it before a clear fire or in the oven. Put a little butter or dripping over the chicken and into the tin, to enable you to baste it frequently during the process of cooking. A quick heat is required for the first ten minutes and a slower heat after that. A small chicken will take about 40 minutes, and a large one about one hour. When done remove the skewer and string, place the chicken on a hot dish, garnish with watercress, pour a little gravy, made in the same manner as directed for roast meat, round the dish, and sen^e with a boat of bread sauce 41. BOILED BEEF OR MUTTON. Wipe the meat, cut off any superfluous fat, and weigh the joint. Put the meat into a stew-pan of boiling water sufficient to cover it, season with salt, and let boil fast for five minutes to harden the outside. Remove the scum, add some vegetables, such as carrots, turnips, and onions, and let simmer gently until tender. Average time allowed for cooking is twenty minutes to the pound and twenty minutes over. Salted or pickled meat should be placed in cold or tepid water, and must be brought slowly to the boil. Boiled beef is served with a garnishing of cooked carrots and turnips and small suet dumplings. Boiled mutton is garnished with vegetables, i.e., carrots, turnips, and onions, and is served with caper sauce. (See sauces.)

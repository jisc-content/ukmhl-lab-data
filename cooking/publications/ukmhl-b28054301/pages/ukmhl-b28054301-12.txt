SPRING SOUP. 3 pints stock 1 turnip 1 very small bunch of herbs (fresh) 1 white of egg 1 carrot 1 small onion I piece of celery ^ lb. gravy beef Seasoning Clean and wash the vegetables, peel them, scoop out some small rounds of carrot and turnip, cut half the onion and one celery stalk into dice, and cook each of these separately in salted water. Cut up the remainder of the vegetables into small pieces, and put these with the herbs into a stew-pan, add the white of egg (previously beaten) and the meat (previously minced and freed from skin and fat), pour in the stock, stir till it boils, and let simmer very gently for ten minutes. Strain carefully, and put the strained (clarified) soup in a clean stew-pan; add the vegetables, previously cooked, season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of castor sugar; boil up and serve. Needless to say that early spring vegetables should be used. A few tarragon and chervil leaves cut into very fine strips may be put into the soup if liked. Great care must be taken in straining the soup, for it should be perfectly clear; if found otherwise it should be strained a second or third time. Use a coarse kitchen cloth for this purpose. It is best to pour a little boiled water through the cloth before straining the soup.

Wash and peel the potatoes thinly, put them in a saucepan of cold water sufficient to well cover them, add a little salt, and boil till they are tender. Pour off the water, and put the saucepan with the potatoes back on the fire for about three minutes to dry. Shake the pan frequently to prevent burning. They will take about half an hour to cook. 91. MASHED POTATOES. Prepare and boil the potatoes as above described; when cooked, drained, and dried, mash them with a fork, or rub through a sieve. Return them to the stew-pan, and add butter, salt, and pepper, allowing an ounce of butter to every pound of potatoes. Beat up well over the fire until thoroughly hot, and add a little milk or cream. 92. POTATO CROQUETTES. Mash a pound of potatoes as above described, stir in an ounce of butter, when hot add a teaspoonful of chopped parsley and half an egg well beaten ; cook for a few minutes to set the egg, season to taste, and put the mixture on a plate to cool. Shape it into even-sized balls or cork shapes, egg or breadcrumb them, and fry in hot fat to a nice golden brown. Drain and serve.

When the fowl is tender take it out. Wash the leeks, trim off the roots and outside leaves, and cut them into one inch lengths. Strain the broth, which should measure about 3 pints, into another stew-pan; add the leeks, and the rice, previously washed and blanched. Boil for about half an hour. Season to taste. Cut the fowl in half, divide one half into small pieces and put with the soup; use up the remainder for some other purpose. Before serving add a teaspoonful of chopped parsley to the soup.

TOILET SOAPS. • Nothing is more injurious to a sensitive skin than the use of a soap containing an undue proportion of alkali, or one made from cheap rancid fats. Many of the cheaper kinds of soap sold for toilet purposes contain irritating ingredients, some of the highly coloured old fashioned soaps being positively ruinous to the skin. In no matter therefore should more di.scrimination be used than in the choice of soap for Toilet purposes, and it is with pleasure that we are able to speak in high terms of the VINOLIA Soaps. They have been before the public for a number of years, and received the highest awards for excellence of quality.

THE EXHIBITION COOKERY BOOK. 15 FISH. 21. BOILED FISH. Fish for boiling should be fresh and firm. Remove the scales and the eyes, cut off the fins, clean it well, and wipe with a damp cloth. Put the fish into hot water with salt and vinegar enough to make the water taste; boil very gently till the tail bones will come out if lightly pulled; if the fish be boiled too fast the skin will break; a good sized fish will take from 20 to 30 minutes. Lift the fish carefully out of the water, drain it well, dish neatly, and serve with melted butter or white sauce. Vinegar or lemon juice added to the water makes the flesh firm and keeps it a good colour. 22. FISH FRIED IN BATTER. 1 plaice 1 tablespoonful sweet oil Salt Frying fat 2 ozs. flour ^ gill tepid water 1 white of egg Wash and dry the fish, lay on a clean board and fillet it; make the batter; put the flour into a basin with a good pinch of salt, then add the oil and the water gradually, taking care to avoid any lumps. Stir till quite smooth. Allow the batter to stand for a while. Just before it is required whisk the white of egg to a stiff froth and mix with the batter. Take each fillet on a skewer, dip it in the batter, and fry in boiling fat. Put the fish on a piece of paper to drain well. Dish up on a hot dish. The fat should be strained after using, as pieces of the batter will have come away from the fish, and these would stick to the next thing fried in the fat.

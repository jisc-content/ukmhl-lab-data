THE EXHIBITION COOKERY BOOK. II3 MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES. 233. TO MAKE TEA. Put a .kettle with freshly drawn, pure, and if possible, filtered water on the fire, and bring it to the boil for the purpose of making tea. Do not use water which has been standing on the stove all day, and which has been replenished from time to time, for this will not make good tea. It is most important that the water used must be boiled purposely. Use an earthenware teapot in preference to a metal one, pour some boiling water in the pot to heat it. Pour it out and put in a level teaspoonful of tea for every cup required and add an extra teaspoonful for the pot. As soon as the water in the kettle boils (water boils when it bubbles and the steam comes out of the spout) pour on as much as will fill the number of cups required. Set the pot to stand for three minutes. Stir up the tea-leaves with a spoon, and after another two minutes the tea will be ready. 234.

THE EXHIBITION COOKERY BOOK. H SIMPLE MEAT DISHES. 38 ROAST OR BAKED MEAT. For a medium sized joint of beef or mutton allow fifteen minutes to every pound and fifteen minutes over for cooking. If the meat is very thick, allow half an hour over. Pork, veal, and lamb must always be well done, and require about twenty minutes to each pound and twenty minutes over. These meats are not wholesome if served underdone. For large joints—sirloin of beef, legs of pork, etc.—it is best to allow half an hour to every pound. Wipe the meat, trim if necessary, place it in a baking- tin, on a twist, or hang it in front of the fire. In the former case the meat must be put in a very hot oven, with a little dripping on top, for ten minutes, so as to harden the outside and to keep in the juices of the meat. Then lower the heat of the oven, and cook rather slowly till done, Whether a joint is cooked in the oven or in front of the fire it requires to be basted frequently, and if the meat is lean it will require rather more dripping for basting than fat meat. 39. TO MAKE GRAVY Take up the joint and put it on a hot dish, pour off the fat in the baking tin or dripping pan. The brown particles or lumps adhering to the bottom of the pan must not be poured away, for these contain the essential flavour of the meat and are necessary for the grav)'. Put from one gill to half a pint of water into the pan, add enough salt and pepper to taste, stir over the fire until the brown lumps have quite dissolved, let this boil for a few minutes, then pour over or round the joint.

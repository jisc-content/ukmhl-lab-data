Pass a trussing needle, threaded with string, through the tail of the fish, centre of body, and eyes, draw the fish up into the shape of the letter “ S,” brush it over with the remainder of the egg, and sprinkle some breadcrumbs over it and a few bits of butter or dripping. Bake in a brisk oven from half an hour to thi'ee-quarters of an hour, basting frequently. Serve with anchovj' sauce or melted butter. Skin the fish, pick out all the bones, and shred or chop it finely. Mash the potatoes and mix them, (together with the parsley, pepper, and salt), with the fish. Melt the butter, and add the fish, etc. Mix all well together with the cream. Form the mixture into small even-sized round flat cakes on a floured board. Beat up the egg on a plate, brush over the cakes with it, toss them in the breadcrumbs, shape neatly again, shaking off all the loose crumbs, and fry them a golden brown in boiling fat. NOTE.—If the mixture be found too stiff for shaping add a little milk or a yolk of egg. 27.

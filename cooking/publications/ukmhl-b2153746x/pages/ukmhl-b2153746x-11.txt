PREFACE WHAT is the excuse for including the following work in a series on Technology ? This question may be answered by quoting the following passage from the Report of one of the Moseley Commissioners : 4 The term “Technical Education ” has several con- notations ; sometimes the strictly mechanic arts point of view is adhered to, sometimes it1 is understood as that form of education which helps a man to earn a living.’ As a considerable number of women do earn their living by teaching cookery, it is hoped that the follow- ing hints may be of service to them, either during their training or afterwards. During the past five or six years, it has been curious to watch the development of domestic economy teaching. In some quarters science has been regarded as an enemy to practical cookery, whereas practical cookery is enormously improved by a thorough knowledge of scientific principles combined with manual dexterity.

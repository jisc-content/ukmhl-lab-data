VI INSTRUCTION IN COOKERY All teachers should try to study their subject from every side; and the more truly scientific their knowledge is, the sounder their methods of practice are. This little book does not pretend to be a recipe book, but to give a few practical hints on the conduct of classes. Some few recipes are given which I have from time to time collected. Some are from the number of recipes which Miss Peacock, of the Leeds Training-School, has compiled, and this, in itself, will be a guarantee that they are practical. The chapters on Invalid Cookery and Infant-Feed- ing owe a great deal to the book of lectures, published by Dr. Robert Hutchinson, entitled ‘ Food and the Principles of Dietetics.’ Other suggestions in these chapters have been made by Mr. Ralph Thompson, F.R.C.S., M.Ch., Guy’s Hospital, now Surgeon at the Victoria Hospital for Children, Chelsea.

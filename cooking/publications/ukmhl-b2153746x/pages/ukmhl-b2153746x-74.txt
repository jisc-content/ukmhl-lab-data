INSTRUCTION IN COOKERY 58 The squab pie of Devonshire is made thus by using alternate layers of mutton, apple, and onion, and is very delicious, wholesome, and savoury. The melt makes excellent stock, and can be purchased very cheaply, but it must, like all inside organs, be purchased as fresh as possible. Cow-heel and ox-cheek make excellent and nutritious stews. Stock and milk should both be boiled if there is any fear of their going sour, and here it must be remembered that milk in London is always 12 hours old before selling, and in hot weather very often arrives sour. It should be scalded at once, as it can never be made into milk puddings if at all sour. Sour milk may, however, be used for cakes or scones, and if some carbonate of soda is added, this will to a large extent take the place of baking-powder. If treacle or jam are used for anything in cold weather they should be warmed, and then less will be required. In making treacle rolls a few bread crumbs flavoured with ginger sprinkled over the treacle may be used, as this prevents the treacle oozing out when baking them. It cannot be too strongly impressed on children that if their jam tarts have too much jam in them the jam will boil over, and not only spoil the tart, but also be wasted in making a great mess in the tin.

Rhubarb jam is a very good, economical, and cheap jam for cooking-lecture use. I give the following recipe for it: Rhubarb Jamâ€”Peel the rhubarb, and cut it up into pieces about 1 inch long. Weigh the fruit, and note

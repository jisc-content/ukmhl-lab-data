41 THE SYLLABUS FOR CHILDREN The second line for revision need not be dated* Thus, the second lesson there would be revision of cleaning, which would be marked opposite cleaning, though not given on that day. Conduct marks may be given below this at each lesson, and these are useful, too, as a check on the children. If record books are kept faithfully, they will prevent one child always doing the same revision; but they must always be marked at the end of the lesson. NOTE-BOOKS Authorities differ as to the time devoted to these. Personally I incline to the theory that it is of value to a child, both educationally and practically, to write a clear synopsis of the chief parts of lesson in a note-book which she shall be allowed to preserve, and I think it is a good thing to have the children seated with their hands and eyes properly employed for a short time during the morning. I think the mere copying of recipes is of no use to anyone unless the greatest regard is paid to price and time of cooking; but the points which make for success in the various processes of cooking are very important. ACCOUNTS The simplest form of accounts is one which shows the money taken and spent each week at a glance (see next page). Separate vouchers or order sheets or books should be kept, and should be totalled each day, and entered at the end of the week in the account book. The money taken for sale of food should be entered daily. Some authorities advance money, and this should be entered, too, on the receipts side.

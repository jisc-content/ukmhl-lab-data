IOO INSTRUCTION IN COOKERY strict as to the number allowed, and as to the proper registration of the girls. It is wonderful how very slow people are to see the necessity for keeping rules; but if a teacher gives in and endangers the grant, she will always have to take the blame. At one time, when a class such as the above came, it was considered quite allowable for one girl to personate another and answer to her name for one evening, so that the numbers should be kept up and the grant paid. Another difficulty is that every student objects to clear- ing up, and they are often far more untidy about their work than day-students (perhaps to some extent owing to the artificial light); hence a teacher requires great tact and firmness in enforcing neatness and order. The students cannot be governed as children can be: they must be led. With regard to the syllabus taught, it must be re- membered that the students have been working all day, and the lesson must be stimulating and attractive. Everything should be complete and properly dished, and this is easier to manage than in a day-school, as the girls have probably a great idea of how things should look. Simple garnishes should be encouraged, and cut tissue paper, or even kitchen paper, used where bought dish papers are prohibited. The demonstrations might be alternated with short lectures on stoves, prices of meat, suitable parts to be bought for certain purposes. One lecture on infant feeding might also be given, and two practical demon- strations on invalid cookery (see chapters on these). I do not think it easy for the students to prepare three-course dinners, as the time is so limited; but some combination of dishes can be practised with vegetables, if care is taken in the selection of these.

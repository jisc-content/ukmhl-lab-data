This provides twenty lessons. In classes where three courses — one cookery, one laundry, and one household management class—are taken in a year, it would not be possible to go beyond the fifteenth lesson. In that case the second course should begin with stewing, and the revision should include all processes taught in the first course. They should, however, be illustrated in the practice lesson by dinners and teas, which gives the children practice in cooking to time.

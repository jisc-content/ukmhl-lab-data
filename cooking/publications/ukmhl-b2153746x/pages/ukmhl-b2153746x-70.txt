54 INSTRUCTION IN COOKERY with enough water to cover. Boil till all the water is evaporated and the fat is quite still, and the bits of skin left are brown ; then strain and set on one side till cold, when it will be white and hard. Lard, especially cheap foreign lard, has a very dis- agreeable odour when used for frying. Grilling—This is difficult to teach economically. The best things to cook are small pieces of meat cut from mutton or beef steak, and small chops cut from the neck. Herrings, mackerel, and oily fish may also be used. If the use of the Dutch oven is taught at the same time, bacon and sausages may also be used, and fish, dried or fresh. The main points to be emphasized are that the fire must be clear, and that all grilling should be done immediately before serving. This is the one method of cooking in which the article must be eaten immediately. It is, with a large class, a little difficult to practise in it. The gas grillers are used so much now, that it will be well to explain the use of them too.* Above all, the great digestibility of grilled food should be emphasized, and its consequent superiority to frying, which is the usual way of cooking chops amongst the ignorant. However, even that is better than the baking of them in a slow oven. Properly made bread sauce is a very savoury addition to the chop, and it is a good way to show the pupils this, seeing that it is a better accompaniment for an invalid to a grilled chop than a potato. I give a recipe for this on p. 90. * Steaming—Use an oval steamer with another steamer * The burners are inverted and the metal-work or fire- clay allowed to become red hot. The article to be grilled is placed under this and turned frequently.

THE SYLLABUS FOR CHILDREN 33 Supposing a teacher were teaching cookery in London, she could ascertain a good deal of the needs of her neighbourhood from the caretakers or women employed to clean, and a good deal more from a talk with the head mistresses of the girls she teaches. I think the homes in some districts in London will come as a shock to many who are new to the Metropolis. The 5s. a week * scullery cottages,’ so plentiful in the great manufacturing towns of the North, are wholly conspicuous by their absence in London. It may easily be seen, then, that rent is a very important feature in deciding on which of these budgets a teacher should base her lessons. It will not be enough to assume that because a man is earning £i 18s. a week the second budget would apply in all cases. He might be obliged to pay very heavy rent in the particular neighbourhood, and this would reduce the amount available for food, and consequently the dishes taught ought to be cheaper. The best skeleton syllabus is one which gives a practical demonstration (short for preference) in a certain process of cookery, followed by a practice lesson, which will enable the pupils easily to prepare and make the same dish themselves. In the provinces the girls leave school at thirteen, and the limit of fourteen has not been yet extended to these poor children who thus become wage-earners at an earlier age than in London. The children in the provinces will, therefore, probably not get a second and third course, and more has to be compressed into the first. Even now in London refusal of the Board of Education to pay grant on girls under eleven years of age will make the chances very small of a third course being given in cookery. 3

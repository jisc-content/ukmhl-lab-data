46 INSTRUCTION IN COOKERY wooden spoon for mixing, but it is much easier for the children to mix it dry or 4 short â€™ with a knife than with a spoon, but it must be a broad-bladed knife. At the first lesson the children should always make turnovers or flat tarts, such as treacle tarts baked in flat tin plates. The treacle may be stiffened by the addition of about ^ oz. of white bread crumbs in which a little ginger has been mixed. Jam turnovers may be made by cutting a round the size of a saucer, and folding it by the lines with a little jam in the middle. It may be turned over and brushed with sugar and water. This gives it a glazed appear- ance much admired by the pupils. At the next practice of pastry more ambitious things may be taught. The teacher should again demonstrate pastry-making and the preparation of the fruit for a fruit tart; the cutting of the strips for the edge, and the making of the edge nicely. The easiest way to do this is to make it with a fork. These pies can be very successfully baked in the small gill pie dishes, and if they are to be served at dinner, it is well to have a little extra fruit stewed separately. Small cakes and scones may be made at almost any lesson when the oven is free, and the children, of course, love these dearly, and they find a ready sale. The bread lesson, which is the last of the baking series, is dealt with fully in Chapter II. The following points should be emphasized in baking lessons: Baking is cooking in a hot oven by dry heat. A very hot oven is required for pastry and bread. A moderate oven for small cakes and for baking meat. A slow oven for large cakes and milk puddings. The oven must be the right heat at the moment the food is put in.

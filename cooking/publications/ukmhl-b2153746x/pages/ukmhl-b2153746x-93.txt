CHAPTER VII 77 DIET IN DISEASES AND CONVALESCENCE THE diseases in which specific diet plays an important part are such diseases as diabetes (where sugar is excreted in the urine, and must therefore be kept out of the dietary), gout due to an excess of uric acid, affections of the stomach and bowels, disorders of the blood, and diseases of the organs of excretion. In acute diseases it is usual to recommend special diet, and in chronic cases to recommend abstention from substances likely to prove harmful. It is well to remember, too, that it is no use to force food of a special character where it is obnoxious to the patient, as food taken under these circumstances will do no good at all. It often falls to the lot of a cookery teacher to give courses of invalid cookery to nurses, and the following syllabus is suggested for such a course. Invalid Cookery Syllabus Lecture I. Diet in Fevers—A fluid diet. Practical Demonstration—Milk with cereal prepara- tions, as Benger; baked flour or malted milk; beef tea ; lemon jelly.

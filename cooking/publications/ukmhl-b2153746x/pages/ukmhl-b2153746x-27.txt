They are so portable that where it is impossible to have a gas stove fixed they can be used. There are several good makes. Those made by Rippingille’s Albion Lamp Company, Birmingham, which cost about 52s. 6d., are about the size required for a class, and no doubt they can also be hired. The London depot is 7-8, Stonecutter Street, Farringdon Street, but William Whiteley stocks and sells them, and they can be obtained in most large towns.

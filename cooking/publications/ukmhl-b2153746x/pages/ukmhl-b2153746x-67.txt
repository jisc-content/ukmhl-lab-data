5i THE PROCESSES OF COOKERY It is well to spread a piece of linoleum on the floor near the stove, and also to protect the table in the same way. Shallow Frying is the first process to be taught. The examples of food to be fried should either be pancakes, eggs and bacon, sausages, or liver and bacon, steaks of cod, pieces of cold plum pudding, bubble and squeak, cold potatoes.

An excellent way of using cold potatoes at a frying lesson is as follows : Mash some cold potatoes with salt and a very little onion. Make some bacon fat hot in a frying pan and pour the potatoes in en bloc; allow them to brown nicely, turn them on to a hot dish, and serve with fried bacon for breakfast or high tea.

The batter will often stick to a frying pan which has been washed recently. Then put a fresh portion of fat into the pan, heat it up as before, moving the pan about to ensure even heating. Then pour into it enough batter to evenly coat the bottom of the pan.

STOVES T3 level with the top of the wick tube. A wick exactly the same size as the tube must always be used. All wicks should be carefully dried before use, and allowed to be thoroughly saturated with oil before being lighted. In putting in a new wick, cut it level with a pair of good scissors, push it carefully into the winders, and turn it then into position. Lighting the Stove—Draw out the oil container, turn up the wick, and light with a taper (not with paper); turn the wick down until nearly out; see that the whole of it is lighted; slide the container gently back into its proper position; then turn up the flame very gradually till it is as high as necessary—never more than £ inch. Extinguishing the Stove—Turn down the flame, draw out the container, and blow out across the flame. When not in use, the wick should be turned below the level of the tube, as this will prevent the oil from spreading over the tank. All petroleum oil has a tendency to creep, and it is necessary to wipe the tanks over with soft paper occasionally. If dampers are provided, they can be used to intensify the heat for the oven alone. In some poor parts of London, such as Plaistow, small inexpensive Sunrise stoves are used exclusively for cooking. Small detachable ovens are also used to fit over these. Oil Used—Petroleum is in its crude state a thick brown fluid, and principally comes from America, though Eastern Russia is found to be rich in mineral oil. It is now refined and purified to such an extent that much of the most inflammable part of it is dis- tilled away. These products include petrol, benzoline, naphtha, and their terrible inflammability is too well

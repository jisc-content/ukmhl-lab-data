The teacher’s bread ought to be baked before the children’s goes into the oven. The best way to'test it is to tap it, and if it sounds hollow, it is well baked. It should be put in a sieve to cool, and if a shiny appearance is liked, the loaves may be brushed over with a little warm milk while still hot. In order to ensure a thorough practical knowledge of bread-making, it is well for a second lesson to follow the above lesson the next time the class meets, and then in any sub- sequent lesson to allow two girls to make about i lb. each until all the class have practised. The second lesson may be managed as follows: Prepare warm flour, water, etc., as before. Directly the children have washed their hands, the warm bowls and flour should be portioned out, the yeast should be prepared and mixed with lukewarm water, and the bread ‘ sponged ’ and mixed.

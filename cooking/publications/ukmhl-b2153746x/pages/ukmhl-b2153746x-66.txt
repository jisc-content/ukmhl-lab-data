50 INSTRUCTION IN COOKERY well to show the children this, and then to compare some which has only been cooked during the lesson, and they will at once see the use of long, slow cooking. The principle of the bain-marie, a very useful one where there are liable to be distractions, may be shown with a jam jar and a large pan of boiling water, or jars in the oven may be used. Three 3-lb. jam jars can be made to stand in a large preserving pan of water, or straw can be put between them, and saucers used as lids. The proper thickening of stews is rarely understood. The children must be shown that for every pint of liquid 1 tablespoonful of flour previously mixed very smoothly with cold water may be stirred in. Stews are also thickened by the addition of peas, potatoes, barley, or rice. The flavouring and admixture of different vegetables is also very important. Stewing is cooking slowly in a small quantity of liquid in a closely covered vessel for a long time. It may be done in a covered jar in the oven, or in a covered thick pan on the fire, or in a covered jar standing in boiling water, forming a bain-marie or water bath. By this last arrangement the contents of the jar are never raised above simmering point. Stewing is the only process of cooking which renders tough and coarse meat tender.

The children are so liable to forget to hold the pan handle all the time, and then disastrous results may follow; and some children are quite overcome by the smell of heated fat.

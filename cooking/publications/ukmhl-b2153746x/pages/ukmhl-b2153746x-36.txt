INSTRUCTION IN COOKERY 20 necessary accomplishment. The quantity (6 oz.) may to the inexperienced seem as bad as the teaching of roast- ing by using mutton chops, but it must be remembered in a class of 18 children (allowing two monitors) at least 48 oz. or 3 lb., nearly a quartern, of flour is kneaded by each child when the dough is put together. A quartern will make four good-sized loaves, a very usual baking for a small family. In consequent revisions a quartern may be mixed by the child, and that is the limit any child of twelve can knead. Tea-cakes are more difficult than bread, as they are mixed moister, and therefore are not so easy for a beginner to handle. I have always found it easier for them to knead it at the board, picking up the dough with the tips of their fingers and pounding it with their closed fists. When quite smooth the bread may be put to rise in a warm place—the top of the gas stove when the oven only is lighted is very good, or in front of a coal stove with a screen round, or even on the top of a steamer with the water simmering very gently underneath ; but the heat must be even and steady, or the bread will not rise to time, and it is always important in a bread lesson to waste no time. This will make the dough begin to rise, but great care must be taken not to apply too great heat to the bottom, as this will cook the dough and practically make it useless. It is absolutely necessary to let the dough rise well for at least 1 hour, as, if not, it rises after shaping too much. Whilst the children’s dough is rising, the teacher may shape her own loaves. It would be well to show the children how to make the ordinary tin loaf a good shape. The tin should be warmed and greased* and a piece of dough should be selected to half fill it,

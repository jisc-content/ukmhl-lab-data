INSTRUCTION IN COOKERY 52 to turn her pancake with a knife for fear of accidents. In tossing a pancake, move the pan rapidly forward as you toss, and then back again. A palate knife is a great help to a cookery teacher, though, of course, it is not an artisan tool. So also is a filleting knife and a very sharp French chopping knife. The pupils may, after mixing the batter, pour it into two bowls, and proceed to peel potatoes, while two at a time fry in two separate pans. It is not possible for a teacher to supervise more at one stove. Each girl should have a broad-bladed knife, J-gill measure, a plate, and a hot dish for her pancakes, and, if possible, allow each child to do two, as she will probably require considerable help with her first attempt.

Fish-cakes are a good example of this process, also potato balls, and these do not require a great amount of fat if a small pint saucepan is used instead of a large saucepan. Dough-nuts—Made by using a little dough made of yeast as for tea-cakes, or with the same mixture as for rock-cakes (omitting the currants). This should be rolled into a round about 3 inches in diameter, a small piece of jam placed in the middle, and then folded up, or one piece about ij inches may be fastened on to another by slightly moistening it. They should be put into hot fat and fried a golden brown, and then rolled in castor sugar while still hot. No lesson on frying should be given without over and over again impressing on the children the following facts :

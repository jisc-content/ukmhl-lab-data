INSTRUCTION IN COOKERY H known to need description. It is safe to infer that the cheaper oils are more dangerous than the expensive, but no oil with a lower flash-point than ioo° F. is allowed to be sold as lamp oil for burning purposes, though— and it seems a contradiction—naphtha is used for little hand lamps. The refined oil or petroleum, after these processes, is a safe article to be kept in the house. The best known are rock oil, crystal oil, and kerosene, and the best and safest makes are Alexandra Oil, Stranze’s A i Crystal, Pratt’s Astral, Royal Daylight, and White Rose Oil. These are all of much higher flash-point than the Government standard, and are cleaner and more economical in use than those of lower grades. The estimated cost of each burner of such a stove as is described above is about five-sixths of a penny an hour. In many of the big stoves the waste heat is utilized in heating a tubular boiler, which costs about £i extra. This is of great use for washing up in a class-room, where there is probably no hot water laid on. There is on the market an oil stove which is wickless. It is largely used in the open air, and for expeditions such as Nansen’s. It is of Norwegian origin, and is called the Primus stove; many large ironmongers stock it. This stove does not consume oil, but the vapour of oil mixed with air. The result is a blue smokeless flame, intensely hot. The principle of this stove is as follows : A container (b) filled with paraffin is fitted with a pump {a). By means of this pump the paraffin oil is forced into the tubular part, here indicated (c). The tubular part stands in a cup over which a little

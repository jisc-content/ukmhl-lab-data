6 INSTRUCTION IN COOKERY It will be seen from the accompanying illustration that these stoves have a second top oven, which can be heated by the waste heat from the bottom one, or the burners may be deflected downwards and a capital ‘ browning ’ chamber made. The sides are packed with slag wool, which makes it less liable for the heat of the oven to be suddenly reduced by a draught, and the heat is retained longer after the gas is extinguished.

The oven tap is guarded at the side by a perforated arrangement of metal, in which the fingers have to be inserted to turn it on. Thus nothing can catch in the tap and cause it to be turned on without the knowledge of the operator. An illustration of Fletcher and Russell’s stoves is also given as frontispiece. These stoves are admirable in every way. The oven tap is well at the side. This firm’s stoves have for years been supplied all over England, and most London teachers use them. COAL STOVES Undoubtedly those coal stoves which are not set into the wall, but are placed out in the room, are most convenient for a class. They are very easily transferred from one place to another, and the setting of the flue pipe is almost the only point about which it is necessary

INSTRUCTION IN COOKERY 40 This may seem absurdly obvious, but it is wonderful what a number of cookery teachers spend hours over registers for lack of such a table, which can, by the way, be purchased at any stationer’s. The entries are made at the same time on a special sheet register, to be kept in the cookery teacher’s charge, and in a roll-book for the convenience of the school egister. The names should be entered in alphabetical order, with the age and standard next to the name. The Board of Education are becoming very particular about age, and therefore, if an inspectress was unable to see the ages of the children at a glance, she might withdraw the grant. Registers should be kept under lock and key. RECORD BOOKS These are books kept to show the lessons given and the work done by the pupils’ own hands. They are of great value as books of reference, for both inspectors and teachers, and essential in cases where the regular teacher is absent. Lesson. Date. Name of Class. J. Smith. CO bo bo l—I I M.

THE PROCESSES OF COOKERY 53 Mediums Used—Dripping, lard, vegetaline, olive oil, and butter. The three first are the best and cheapest, as olive oil spurts so, and butter burns too quickly for it to be used for anything but omelettes or small pieces of tomato, or something similar. Rule I—The fat must be smoking hot and quite still. Rule II—The fat must be heated up between each piece of food being put in. Rule III—Do not put too many things in at a time, as this cools the fat too much. . Rule IV—Use very fine dry bread crumbs if a coating of qgg and crumb is used, and see that the things are cooked well. Rule V—Drain well on soft paper. Rule VI—Strain the fat after using and cooling through a very fine muslin or wire gauze strainer, so as to be quite sure that there is nothing left in it. Muslin must always be employed after anything made of potatoes has been used. The presence of water or gravy in fat makes it spurt, and is very dangerous. If a kettle should boil over on the stove into the frying pan there might be a bad accident. In the event of the fat catching fire, a teacher must have something to slip over the pan at once, such as a closely fitting lid or small board, which extinguishes it. The Best Way of employing Spare Pieces of Fat for making Dripping—Carefully remove all fat that will not be eaten from food before cooking. Cut this up, and either melt it in a dripping tin in the oven if it is required in a hurry, or place it in a stew pan

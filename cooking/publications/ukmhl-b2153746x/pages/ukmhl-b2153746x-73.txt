TEACHING DOMESTIC ECONOMY 57 buy the scrag, neck, and breast of a piece of mutton, known in London as a target, she would be able to | stew the scrag, grill or fry the chops, and roll, stuff, and either stew or bake the breast of mutton. The objections against buying a large piece of meat such as this are: 1. The flies, attracted by it, are very liable to become a real source of annoyance and danger. This can, of course, only be avoided by having the meat-safe fixed above the door and away from the window. 2. Some people would say that the children would not buy in such quantities; but the whole target might be shown and cut up before them, and the full advantage pointed out, together with the exact part of the animal being cooked, and this would afford a more useful object-lesson than buying in bits. If there is a decent keeping-place, decomposition may be largely retarded by dipping the meat in boiling water for 4 or 5 minutes, and then covering it with a piece of muslin soaked in vinegar. Meat should always be kept in a draught. Again, supposing in a rich district a teacher were to buy a haunch of mutton, the leg and loin. This is, of course, where there was a demand for prime joints. She could then cut half the leg in half, use a piece of the top for fillet, and bone, roll, and stuff the loin, and, if liked, cut up the part of the top of the leg where there is bone for stewing. The fat must be carefully trimmed off and used for rendering into dripping. It is very extravagant to serve up large quantities of fat portions of meat for dinner, as very few people like a great deal of fat, and it can be trimmed off and reserved for so many other things. Scrag of mutton makes excellent meat and potato pie, and, having plenty of bone, the pastry is well supported.

BREAD AND BREAD-MAKING i9 but they need only look at the dough after the children have kneaded to wonder where the dirt came from. The teacher should next make up 1 lb. of warmed flour, with \ oz. yeast and 1 teaspoonful of salt, and about J pint of warm water. (See recipe at the end of the chapter.) After demonstrating clearly that lukewarm water is blood-heat or comfortably warm water, and showing how it is made with 1 part of boiling and 2 parts of cold, it is well to let them test it with their fingers. The yeast should be mixed with a little sugar and liquefied, and allowed to ‘ sponge ’ for a few minutes. Then mix this with the flour after sprinkling with salt, knead well till quite smooth, and allow to rise for 1 hour in a warm place. After a further inspection of the children’s hands they may be allowed to stand round the table while two monitors give out the warm bowls and 6 table- spoonfuls of flour (6 oz.) to each child. The yeast is portioned out to each child, allowing a proper fraction of the amount given in the recipe. They are then allowed to mix it with a little sugar and lukewarm water, and proceed as above, mixing with a wooden spoon or fingers; but the teacher must be very careful not to allow them to make it too moist. After that they must knead it. Then half the class place their portions together in one bowl, and half in the other. Two girls at a time in turn knead the larger quantity; the rest of the class may be employed in washing the basins and some other light work, such as peeling potatoes, etc. Some children have very little idea of kneading, and so it will be necessary to give them a thorough practice in this very 2—2

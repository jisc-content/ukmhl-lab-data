THE SYLLABUS FOR CHILDREN 39 CLERICAL WORK Registers—As these are the documents upon which depend the money paid by the State for the main- tenance of cookery classes, it is absolutely necessary that they should be accurately kept and punctually marked. The Board of Education requires every register to be marked in ink at the moment the class meets, and to be closed half an hour afterwards, accurately totalled and initialled by the teacher taking the class. Every pupil who arrives punctually receives a red mark. Every child who arrives less than half an hour late receives a black mark, and any child arriving after this is marked with an 4 0/ as though not present. Half an hour is deducted for every black mark in the child’s total number of attendances. Let no teacher be induced to accept any excuses for unpunctuality, or give a red mark when the pupil is late. The quickest way of totalling registers if hours and fractions of hours have to be reckoned is always to employ decimals, and to make out a simple table of these, as a ready reckoner. Supposing the duration of a class is 2J hours, or 2*5, the table would run as follows: and so on, deducting half an hour, or 0*5 of an hour, for every late attendance. If, as used sometimes to happen, 2f hours has to be reckoned, 1 attendance = 2*5 hours 2 attendances =5 ,, 3 >> = 7 5 ” 4 >> = 10 » 1 attendance 2 attendances 3 275 hours

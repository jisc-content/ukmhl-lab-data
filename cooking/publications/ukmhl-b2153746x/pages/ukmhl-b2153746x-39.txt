SKETCH OF LESSON ON YEAST AND BAKING- POWDER (This may he inserted before the actual bread-making is given) Action of Yeast—Yeast is a very small plant, the cells of which float in the air, and will fasten itself on to anything on which it can feed and multiply. It grows rapidly on beer as brewers’ yeast, and on hollands as German yeast. It splits most sugary substances into gas and alcohol. When kept at blood- heat the gas causes bubbles. It is these bubbles which work in the dough of bread and make it light. The dough does not go on increasing in bulk in the oven, because the great heat kills the yeast plant; cold numbs it, and renders it useless. Baking-powder—Baking-powder is composed of a dry acid powder and a dry alkali powder mixed with cornflower, to separate the particles and spread it more evenly in the substance to be raised. When mixed with water or any liquid it fizzes up. Carbonate of soda and tartaric acid are used, as they are almost tasteless when mixed. Butter-milk and soda have a similar action. Self-raising flour is merely flour mixed with dry baking-powder.

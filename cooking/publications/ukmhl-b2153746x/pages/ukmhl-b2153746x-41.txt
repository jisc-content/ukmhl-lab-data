BREAD AND BREAD-MAKING 25 Place the flour in a warm bowl, mix the yeast with a little moist sugar until liquid, pour a teacupful of warm water on to it, and pour it into the centre of the flour, stirring a little flour in with it. Let it rise for 15 minutes. Sprinkle the salt round, and knead with lukewarm water and milk to a stiff batter. Beat well, then let it rise in a warm place for an hour. Put it into warm greased tins. Allow to rise for a few minutes. Then bake in moderate oven according to the size of the loaf.

9 STOVES draught over the oven for it to be heated, and the heat is deflected on to the boiler. 2. They may be too large, and then it is impossible for the flue door to prevent the flame and smoke driving up. This goes on each side of the door of every flue, and it is impossible to make any special part of the stove hot. 3. The flues may communicate with one another, or leak into one another or the chimney. This causes the heat again to be distributed and so wasted, and may be due to defective masonry. After the stove has been properly set the proper working of the flues is simply a question of their being kept clean; and the fire being carefully stoked. The top of the hot plates and the flue doors should be removed, and the flue-brush, which must be of a suitable size to work freely up and down, should then be inserted. The soot will fall to the bottom, and so will be found underneath the oven and boiler, and this should be very thoroughly raked out. Every teacher should be able to clean her own flues. It is no good for her to assume that flues are clean because she is told so, if the oven is not becoming as hot as it should be from the size of the fire. It is a great pity if the stoves are placed in such a position as to be easily affected by the wind. I have in my mind a certain little stove which will bake any pastry when the wind is in the west or south, but when the north or north-east winds blow it is impossible to cook anything in the oven. If a stove which has burned satisfactorily ceases to work, and the operator knows that the flues are clean, it would be well to have it thoroughly overhauled by an expert to see if any bricks have fallen across the

INSTRUCTION IN COOKERY 24 Leaven—This has been in use since the time of Moses. Leaven is dough which has not been baked, and in which yeast plants have fixed themselves. It has a sour taste, owing to the formation of acids. Aerated Bread—This is simply bread made from dough into which gas has been pumped, as it is in the manufacture of aerated waters. Note for Teacher—This lesson must be illustrated by showing yeast, and mixing it into sugar and warm water. Point out the gas bubbles after it has stood. Again, various acids and alkalis may be mixed, and a bottle of soda-water may be shown, with an explana- tion of the bubbles, and how they got there. Bread—i oz. German yeast, i teaspoonful salt, 3J lb. flour, about if pints lukewarm water. Warm a bowl and put the flour into it. Add about i teaspoonful of sugar to the yeast, mix them well together with a wooden spoon, now pour on to this about J pint of lukewarm water, make a hole in the middle of the flour, pour the yeast and water into it, stir a small quantity of the flour into this, sprinkle some salt round the edge so as not to touch the yeast, and allow to rise covered up with a cloth in a warm place for about 20 minutes. Then knead up with more warm water, making a stiff dough, knead until smooth, then allow to rise again for about an hour, keeping it warm and covered up the whole time. Next make into loaves, and place in warm and greased tins. Let the loaves rise for about 15 minutes, then bake in a quick oven at first, and afterwards not so hot. If this quantity of dough is made into three loaves, they should take about an hour each. Brown Bread—1 lb. whole meal, 1 small teaspoonful salt, j oz. yeast, lukewarm milk and water.

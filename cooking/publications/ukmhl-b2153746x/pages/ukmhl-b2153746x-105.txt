89 DIET IN DISEASES Remove all cores and pips and skin, and place the pulp in a glass cup, after beating it well. A tiny squeeze of lemon may be added. Mashed Potato Puree—Specially for patients suf- fering from dysentery. Steam some potatoes or bake them in their skins. Rub them to a mash, and then beat well with a wooden spoon. Add a little hot milk and butter and a very little salt (no pepper). Beat well, and serve heaped on a plate very hot. Arrowroot—Milk may be used instead of water. One teaspoonful of arrowroot, \ pint of water, a little brandy. Mix the arrowroot with a little of the water. Boil the rest, and pour it on. Return to the pan and boil. Add the brandy, and serve at once. Stewed Fruit—The excellence of stewed fruit depends largely on the pan or jar used. An enamelled lined saucepan is the best, or a jar with a closely fitting lid. The sugar and water should always be well boiled first and skimmed, and the fruit put into this. Then the fruit must only be allowed to simmer gently. When it is stewed it should be lifted out, and the juice further reduced by boiling. Dried fruits such as figs, prunes, apricots, raisins, should be soaked over night, and then allowed to come to a boil in that water, and then the water should be drained away and a further syrup made in the above way, in which it should be simmered till done. Porridge—Put a quart of cold water in a pan with 1 teaspoonful of salt. When it boils sprinkle in about 5 oz. of oatmeal, stirring all the time. Boil gently for \ hour, stirring it often.

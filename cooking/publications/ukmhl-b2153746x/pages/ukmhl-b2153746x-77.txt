On pp. 62, 63, 64, and 65, the reader will find a list of good reliable meat at London prices, so that a teacher can judge for herself as to the comparative prices she ought to pay. The practice of sending the children to look round the shops and pick up meat is theoretically good, but it is practically bad, as it generally results in tainted meat being palmed off on them.

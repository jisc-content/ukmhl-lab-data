2 INSTRUCTION IN COOKERY stoves also give the greatest and most varying accom- modation for the greatest number of workers. They can be hired very cheaply from the agents of the local gas companies, but here it may be well to insert a word of caution. These gas agencies very often profess to supply any make of gas stove desired, but they will often press an inferior make or an old stove on anyone they consider ignorant. A student in training should carefully note the various kinds of stoves used in the training schools and in the elementary schools which she may have visited ; if she has carefully observed them, she will find that one large oven is preferable to two small ones. In one elementary school visited by the present writer there was a stove with two small ovens and a gas fire in the middle. These ovens became so fierce that every- thing was burned on the top or bottom, and only one small shelf in the middle was available. As the shelf was only about i foot square, it may be easily seen how much better a large oven would be in which three of the shelves can be used at one time. POINTS OF A GOOD GAS STOVE 1. Oven Tap—-The oven tap is best placed in a different part of the stove from the jets for the top, and it should be stiff and not easily turned. Half the accidents in gas stoves have been due to the fact that the oven tap has been inadvertently turned, and the gas allowed to go on escaping into the oven ; and directly the door is opened the gas on the top lights the volume of gas in the oven, and the unfortunate worker may be terribly injured. 2. Burners—There should be about six rings or jets of varying size on the top, and, if possible, one large

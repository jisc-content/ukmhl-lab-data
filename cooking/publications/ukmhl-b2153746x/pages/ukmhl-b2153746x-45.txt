29 BREAD AND BREAD-MAKING Method—About 3 lb. of potatoes should be mashed for 1 stone of flour, or you may use 1 lb. to 1 quartern. A smaller quantity of yeast (§ oz. to 1 quartern) is liquefied and mixed with tepid water and the potato pulp, and then poured into a hole in the middle of the flour. Allow to ‘ sponge ’ for 1 hour, then knead up, let it rise for 2 hours, and shape into loaves; let them rise, and bake in a hot oven for 1 or 2 hours, according to size. It will be seen that this would be too long for a lesson, but a potato, boiled and mashed, may be added to most doughs. Tests for Oven for Bread—Put a piece of jwhite paper on the oven shelf. If this turns a pale fawn colour in 2 or 3 minutes, the oven is right for bread— about 350° F. Some say 410° F. when it is put in, but this is too hot. A brick oven is best of all, and there are no loaves so nice as those baked in one. Recipe for the York Brown Bread—Into a quartern measure put: 3 tablespoonfuls sugar, 1 tablespoonful salt, 3 oz. of yeast, 2 tablespoonfuls treacle (dark brown), 4 tablespoonfuls melted lard or butter. Fill the measure up with lukewarm water. Add then 3 quarts of wholewheat flour; knead very well, and allow to rise 2 or 3 hours in a warm place. Shape into loaves, and place in warmed and greased tins. About half fill these, and allow to rise for another J-hour. Bake in a hot oven, but be careful not to burn, as, owing to the treacle, the bread is apt to catch. In this chapter I have advocated the mixing of 6 oz. of flour and a small portion of yeast by the children. This is only in first lesson. When more

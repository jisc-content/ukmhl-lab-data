Lime Water—Slake a piece of freshly burnt lime about the size of an orange with cold water. Put the crumbled lime in a gallon jar, and fill up with water. Shake well, allow it to settle, and throw away the first water. Fill up with cold boiled water, shake, cork, and use after it has been allowed to stand 24 hours. Do not expose to the air.

In the sweetened kinds a good deal of cane sugar is added, which is not good for a baby, and the result is that children fed on it very often become flabby. The third kind, the con- densed separated or skim milks, are entirely unsuited to a baby’s diet. Condensed milk is rather more digestible than cow’s milk, owing to the great dilution with water in its preparation for food. It is largely patronized as a food for infants by poor people, but it is really very expensive, as the following calculations will show : A tin costing 5jd. contains \ pint of condensed milk. This is diluted with 1 pint of water, and makes 1J pints of liquid. The best dairy milk is only 4d. for 2 pints. Another disadvantage of condensed milk is that in

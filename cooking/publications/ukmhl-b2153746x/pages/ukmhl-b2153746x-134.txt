METHUEN & CO., 36 ESSEX STREET, LONDON, W.C. Price 2s. Fourth Edition. Crown Svo. xvi + 168 pages. MILLINERY THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL BY CLARE HILL INSTRUCTRESS TO THE WEST RIDING COUNTY COUNCIL AND LEEDS EDUCATION COMMITTEE AMONG the subjects taught under the auspices of Education Committees, Millinery has deservedly won a popular place. The cry of teacher and student alike is for a manual dealing with subject-matter that has hitherto proved too elusive for them to grasp, or not been included in their curriculum or training course. After many talks with teachers and students, and dis- cussing the points of shortcomings, the author has compiled a treatise which, while as concise and simple as possible, yet fully meets the demand, and thus makes no apology for offering the result of much wide and practical experience to the public, venturing to think that notes on Pattern-taking; Colour and Form, Draft- ing on Geometrical Principles, and Draping ; Renova- tions, Trimmings, Stitches used in Millinery, Widths and Costs, and Identification of Materials, more than warrant her in the assumption that this little book will prove a boon and friend to those who study its pages. A notable feature of the book is the large number of diagrams and illustrations.

INSTRUCTION IN COOKERY IO flues, or whether they have begun to leak. Sometimes the fire-clay next the oven slips away, and leaves a non-conducting space of air between the fire-heated clay and the oven. Regulation of Heat—If the oven is not provided with a damper, and is becoming hotter and hotter, after the required heat is reached it may be slightly cooled by placing a small tin of water in the oven, and also by using a cool oven sheet, and opening the door slightly and very carefully. The entrance to the flue must have the fire raked away from it. In baking large cakes in an oven liable to burn at the bottom, the cake tin should be placed in a deep baking tin filled with salt. This is a good non-conductor of heat, and will prevent the bottom of the cake being scorched; or tins with a corrugated false bottom may be used, or the tin may be placed on one or two bricks. Rice puddings may be placed in a similar tin containing water. Many ovens are provided with a knob which directs the heat either to the top or bottom. The little venti- lators in the oven door, when open, allow the steam to escape, and assist the oven to brown its contents. When closed they prevent the escape of the steam. If there is anything spilled in the oven, salt is the best thing to put on it, and this will prevent the smell rising to the top of the house. The cleaning of flues is the great drawback to all coal stoves, and unless these are kept very clean, and the top of the oven kept free from ‘ clinkers,’ it will be impossible to work a class satisfactorily with them, and in any case they must be lighted some time before they are needed.

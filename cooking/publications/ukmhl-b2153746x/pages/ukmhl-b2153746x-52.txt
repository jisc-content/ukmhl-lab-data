INSTRUCTION IN COOKERY 36 cloak-room, small teacher’s room and lavatory, a gallery for the children’s desks, and one cupboard in the wall, one coal stove, and a gas stove to the left of the demonstration table. There are also four other tables with a second shelf about a foot from the ground. These are much better than fixed counters, as they can be moved for cleaning. The building shown in the plan is larger than most cookery centres in the Metropolis, but is about the size of the laundry centres, which are, as a rule, larger than the cookery centres. Apart from its size, it has a teacher’s room and lavatory leading off the main room, which, if they were adopted as an essential part of every cookery centre, would add enormously to the teacher’s comfort and health. Again, if the centre is. built in the playground of a school, it must be placed sufficiently far from the offices provided for the children. (See diagram, p. 37.)

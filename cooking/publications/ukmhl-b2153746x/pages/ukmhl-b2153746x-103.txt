DIET IN DISEASES 87 Put the yeast into the warm water when liquid. Work it into the flour. Add the eggs well beaten and the butter melted. Knead till quite smooth. Put in a warm place and allow to rise 1 hour. Shape it into loaves, and allow to rise 10 minutes. Bake in a moderate oven for 1 hour. Almond Meal Biscuits — Mix 4 oz. almond meal, 2 tablespoonfuls of specially ground bran, 1 oz. creamed butter, 2 teaspoonfuls baking-powder, 1 egg, and about a tablespoonful of milk. The Preparation of Fruits for Diabetic Patients— The fruits suitable are cherries, gooseberries, plums, blackberries, and cranberries. Wash the fruit, place in a pan, bring to a boil, and throw away that water. Put into fresh, cold water and stew till tender. A little of Callard’s prepared glycerine may be added. Omelette Souffle—Separate the whites and yolks of 3 eggs. Beat the whites till very stiff. Stir gradually into the beaten yolks. Make about 2 oz. of butter very hot in an omelette pan (aluminium or steel are the best), and place on a gas ring, stirring all the time. When brown underneath, hold in front of the fire till brown on the top, or place a very hot shovel on the top. This may be served with cream or Devonshire cream. Barley Water—Wash 2 oz. of pearl barley in cold water. Put it into a clean enamelled saucepan and bring to a boil. Boil 5 minutes, and pour off the water. Pour on to it 2 quarts of boiling water, and place in a pan with the thinly peeled coated rind of 1 lemon. When reduced to about a quart, add the strained juice of the lemon and allow to stand till cold. The lemon juice may be omitted if it is to be added to milk.

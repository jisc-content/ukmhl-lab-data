Turn the loaves on end to allow the steam to escape. A lesson on bread-making is hardly complete without some mention of flour and its quality. A grain of wheat can be divided into six parts— 1. The outer skin. 5. The glutin or flesh- 2. The middle skin. forming cells. 3. The inner skin. 6. Starch cells. 4. The germ. Flour is sold as Vienna, household, and brown flour— Pastry white or Vienna flour contains 5 and 6. Household flour contains 4, 5, and 6. Brown contains some of all six. The germ is very rich in fat and flesh-forming food, and should, if possible, be preserved as an article of food. There are two ways of grinding the flour, either between roller or stones. The latter produces a nicer and more digestible flour, but it is not so white. Bread made from this stone-ground flour is largely sold in the London shops, and recommended by doctors under the name of Farm-house Bread. This flour can be obtained direct from Jackson Bros., Nowell Mills, Newark, and costs 15s. 6d. per 10 pecks or stone, carriage paid, which is not expensive. In the modern makes of flour everything is sacrificed towards getting the flour a good colour, and though this may be essential for good pastry, it is not so good or digestible for bread.

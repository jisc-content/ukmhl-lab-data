27 BREAD AND BREAD-MAKING Adulterations of flour are not so common as they were, but adulteration in bread still continues to be used. Amongst the working classes the one thing they like is very white bread, and this is often produced by the use of alum and the substitution of potato pulp for the best flour. The use of alum may be detected by sticking a hot knife into the loaf, which comes out covered with a stringy fibre if alum has been used. Flour should not be sticky to the touch ; if so, it is too new. It should not be kept in a damp place, for this will give a musty flavour to the bread. Scale of Weights for Flour—1 pint = 14 oz. flour ; 1 quartern = 2 pints or \ quartern ; 1 quartern = J of a stone = 3! lb. (and makes a loaf weighing 4 lb. 6 oz., the regulation quartern loaf); 1 stone or peck (14 lb.) makes about 17 or 18 lb. of bread. Substitutes for Yeast—Cookery teachers are often asked what can be used as a substitute for yeast in countries where it is difficult to procure and keep yeast. In Canada a patent compressed yeast is used, and there are also yeast powders to be obtained from many grocers. People get very tired of soda bread and baking-powder bread, and the following recipe is quiet satisfactory: Mash 2 ripe bananas or plantins with 1 tablespoonful of brown sugar, J oz. flour, and \ pint tepid water. Mix well in a warm place, and expose to warm air for a few minutes. Bottle tightly in a ginger-beer bottle, and let it stand for 48 hours in a rather warm place. Use this quantity for about 1 quartern of flour, and strain it carefully into the centre of the flour. There is another made of 2 boiled and mashed potatoes, but this is apt to turn the bread a bad colour.

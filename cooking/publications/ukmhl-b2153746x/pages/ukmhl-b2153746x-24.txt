8 INSTRUCTION IN COOKERY As long as the flues of these stoves are kept clean, and the above directions observed as to setting, these little stoves are admirable in every way. Some of the best are sold by Smith and Wellstrode, and cost about £5 apiece. In a permanent cookery centre, or room only used for cooking, a fixed stove should always be provided in addition, and of these one of the small Eagle ranges or a small Westminster may be recom- mended. The advantage of the ‘ Eagle ’ range is that the flues are made of iron, and therefore the builder who sets it cannot exercise his individual fancy in making brick- work flues. Many of the varying accounts one hears of ranges are due to defects in setting them, and unless the bricklayer understands his work, the work- ing of the stove, however good it may be, is entirely spoiled. In the £ Eagle’ ranges a great advantage is attained by having two flues for each oven, both directly leading from the fire, and these enable the oven to be heated evenly, either from the top or bottom. In most ranges the heat has to travel round the oven before it reaches the bottom, and a much larger and better fire is required There is no doubt that in many ways these ranges effect an enormous saving in fuel. Flues—There are three possible defects in building flues: 1. The brickwork of the flues may be too small for the amount of flame and smoke which is to be driven up them. Supposing the oven fire smokes, this causes the flues to smoke ; then, if the operator opens another flue door—say, over the boiler—there is not enough

The essential points in ensuring a good supply of gas, other than the vagaries of the gas company, are— (1) The operator must see that the air-holes are kept free from grease, flue, and black-lead, as the gas will burn with a yellow flame if these are blocked up.

(3) The pipes should be * blown ’ out occasionally to free them from the deposit of the gas. This last must be done about once a year by a man who understands pipes. If there is a very poor supply of gas, it is well to ' apply to the company. It will be necessary to exercise some judgment in the combination of dishes cooked at the demonstration and in the class, so that the oven and top are never unduly crowded at one time. It is well to notice if any window or door affects the heat of the oven, as the metal sides of a gas oven are quickly cooled by a draught. The use of gas for cookery is largely on the increase in our large towns, and it is not correct to assume that children from even the poorest districts in London are ignorant of its use.

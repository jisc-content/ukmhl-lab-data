81 DIET IN DISEASES constituents of food. It will therefore be necessary to avoid all articles of food which contain sugar and starch. The elimination of the starch and sugar from foods is a difficult and expensive process, and a diabetic diet is therefore a very expensive one. This makes many of the preparations placed on the market quite beyond the reach of a slender purse. It is well to buy these foods from a good place, such as Callard’s, 74, Regent Street, as many of the foods sold, which in price are very much below theirs, are perfectly useless from the diabetic point of view, and may do a great deal of harm. Butcher’s meat of all kinds, except liver, may be eaten. Fish, game, and poultry also contain no injurious constituents. Eggs, cheese, butter, and cream may be eaten, but not milk, unless specially prepared by a drying process which eliminates the sugar. Most green vegetables may be used, but not parsnips, beetroot, carrots, or potatoes. The things which a diabetic patient misses most are fruits and the ordinary bread. Gluten bread is not very nice. The recipes for it, and for an omelette souffle, are given at the end of this chapter, as also the preparation of certain specified fruits—gooseberries, cherries, cranberries, damsons, and blackberries. Nuts, except chestnuts, may be eaten freely. There is also a preparation of Irish moss which can be made into a mould, and the above firm supply a kind of glycerine which may be used for sweetening the pre- pared fruits. 6

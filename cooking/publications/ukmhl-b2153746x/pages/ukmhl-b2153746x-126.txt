110 APPENDIX EXTRACT FROM THE REGULATIONS FOR THE TEACHING OF SPECIAL SUBJECTS [Quoted from the Board of Education 1907 Code of Regulations for Public Elementary Schools in England, by special permission of the Controller of His Majestyâ€™s Stationery Office.] DOMESTIC SUBJECTS 15. Every scholar attending* a Course of instruction must be registered in that Course at its beginning, and no scholar may be added during the progress of the Course. Individual scholars may be allowed to attend particular lessons of a Course in which they are not registered if they have missed the corresponding lessons in other Courses in which they are duly registered, provided that their attendance does not increase the number present at any lesson beyond the limits specified by Rules 19 (<b) or 23 (b) of these Regulations. Such attendances must be entered in a supplementary list and may not be reckoned for purposes of grant in either Course. 16. Each lesson should, if possible, include both demonstration and practical work. When demonstration and practical work are not combined in one lesson, the practical work for all the scholars must be given within eight days of the demonstration lesson to which it is related, unless this is prevented by the School being closed for a special holiday, in which case alternative arrangements must be submitted as soon as possible for the approval of the Inspector. 17. Where any practical lesson is repeated in order to comply with Rules 19 (b) and 23 (b), the hours spent in such repetition must not be taken into account towards the total number of hours constituting the course, and no attendance may be reckoned for a scholar at a repeated lesson if she has attended the original.

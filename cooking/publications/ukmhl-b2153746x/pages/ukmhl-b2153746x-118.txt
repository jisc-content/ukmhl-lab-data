102 INSTRUCTION IN COOKERY steamed plum puddings, fried articles egged and bread- crumbed, bread, and cakes, are the most portable and easily dished up. They also find a ready sale. Good Yorkshire tea cakes always take immensely in the South. Note-Books—There is always a tendency where these are allowed for them to degenerate into mere recipe books, a practice which is severely condemned by the Government inspectors. It is a good plan to have the recipes written out, or printed and mounted on cards, and let these be used on the tables, and collected, and used over and over again, as.it is most important to train people to work from printed recipes. The note-books should contain small points not always given in recipes, and, though every teacher ought to prepare her own black- board sketch for her own lessons, a few sketches of the sort of entry which is likely to be of most use to the pupils are given below. Pastry—Keep everything very cool, using a knife as much as possible. Handle lightly and mix very dry. Roll lightly. Bake in a very quick oven. Mixing of Cakes—In cakes where the butter is in greater proportion to the flour, J lb. butter to I lb. flour. The butter is creamed, and then beaten with the sugar. The eggs must be beaten, and beaten in gradually, to prevent curdling ; and, lastly, the flour and fruit must be stirred in lightly. Baking of Cakes—Small cakes require a quick oven. Large cakes require a moderate oven. Line tins for large cakes with paper, and place these on a tin filled with salt to prevent the bottom of the cakes burning.

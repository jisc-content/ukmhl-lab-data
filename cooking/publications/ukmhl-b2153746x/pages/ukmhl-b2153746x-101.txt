85 DIET IN DISEASES Lecture VlII. More Elaborate Dishes for Convalescence In this last lecture almost any dishes which are digestible and not highly seasoned may be introduced, and for the typical demonstration I have indicated four which I always find are great favourites with people whose appetite is returning. Chops may also be given grilled with a really well-roasted potato and some properly made bread sauce. In demonstrations such as the above a great deal may be done by having the recipes typed out before- hand, and these sold at a moderate sum at the end of the course. Very few people can carry an immense number of recipes in their heads, even when they are constantly cooking. Most people will agree that nurses form a keenly appreciative audience, and many of them may find that a thorough knowledge of invalid cooking is of inestimable value if they either intend to take up private nursing or to embark on the more lucrative undertaking of a nursing home. Of course, the above- suggested syllabus in no way exhausts the subject of invalid cookery, but it claims to be fairly representative of the different kinds of diet required. RECIPES FOR THE DISHES FOR DEMONSTRATION Baked Flourâ€”Place a sheet of white paper on to a baking tin. Spread some flour on this, and place in the oven till a pale fawn colour all over. If it shows signs of browning at the edges, remove the flour and spread it evenly again. Rub it carefully through a fine wire sieve.

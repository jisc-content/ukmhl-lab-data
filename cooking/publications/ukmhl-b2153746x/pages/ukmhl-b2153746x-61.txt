45 THE PROCESSES OF COOKERY puddings is to emphasize the fact that the batter should be poured into a flat tin well covered with smoking hot fat, and then placed in a hot oven. The real way of baking it under the meat is not easy for a class. This might be managed in a gas oven where only one Yorkshire pudding was required by suspending the meat from a hook so] that it dripped on to the baking tin containing the Yorkshire pudding. Each child should make up 2 oz. of flour, ^ egg, 3- pint of milk and water, \ teaspoonful of salt, and carefully stir the ingredients (the mixed egg and milk) very gently into a hole in the middle of the flour. This quite prevents lumps. Baked potatoes may be scrubbed and baked in their skins in a very hot oven, or they may be peeled, parboiled, and placed in a dish of hot fat, and basted with this at intervals. The next two lessons on baking may be devoted to the making and baking of short pastry. The best fat for children’s use is good fresh hard dripping or * vegetaline,’ which may be cut up very finely with a broad flat knife, and never touched with the hands. The proportion of ij oz. of fat to 3 oz. of flour is the most successful, and then a little baking-powder may be used. Great care must be exercised not to allow the children to mess it about with their hands. The teacher may show the class that fingers can be used to rub in fat as well as showing them that the fat can be cut up with a knife, but it is well to let children practise the latter only at the first lesson. The addition of the water is often a great difficulty, but a teaspoonful of water to each ounce of flour is the best proportion, though it must be varied if the flour is damp or the dripping hard. Some teachers use a

In making meat pies, the best way to get a good result is either to use meat which has been previously cooked and allowed to cool, or to put the meat on immediately before the pastry has been mixed, and allow to cook in a saucepan or in hot-pot dishes in the oven. Then let the children make up 4 oz. flour and 3 oz. fat, either in the method employed in making rough puff pastry or in the ordinary way, dividing the fat into two parts and putting it on in small pieces. Let them roll this into a complete round the size of a saucer. Bake on a baking-sheet, as the pastry for oyster patties is cooked.

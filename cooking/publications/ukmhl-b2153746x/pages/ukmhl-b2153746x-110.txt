94 CHAPTER VIII INFANT-FEEDING IN view of the terrible mortality among infants, many education authorities are anxious to place in their syllabus of domestic economy some lessons to elder girls on this very important duty which falls to the lot of most women. Milk—It cannot be too strongly impressed on all women that the woman who does not nurse her child herself, if she is able to do so, is not doing her duty by the child. If, however, she is unable to do this, artificial feeding must be resorted to. Fresh Cow’s Milk is the best food for children in lieu of their natural nourishment. As this forms too hard a clot in the stomach of the child, it is found that the addition of barley water or lime water lessens the toughness of the clot and makes it more digestible, and this is espe- cially true in the case of lime water. For the first month boiled milk may be mixed with twice as much barley water or plain water, or water and lime water mixed. Cream and sugar must also be added. The best way of adding cream is to put, say, i pint of milk into two tumblers, and cover it with muslin, in a cool place, and when the cream has risen add the cream from one tumbler to the other, and warm up the mixed milk and cream together till just boiling.

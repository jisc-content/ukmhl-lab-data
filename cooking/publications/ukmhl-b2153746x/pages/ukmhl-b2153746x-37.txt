BREAD AND BREAD-MAKING 21 kneaded lightly, and then grasped firmly with both the hands and rolled backwards and forwards till quite smooth on the under side. It should then be placed in the tin upside down, lightly pressed with the knuckles into the corners, pricked three or four times with a fork, and put to rise for io minutes in a warm place. A very good substitute for a tin is a i-lb. stone jam jar, warmed and greased, which has the advantage of taking up very little room on the baking-sheet, and also of making a very nice crust. The loaf bakes in a round cake shape, and it is a good shape for using for cut bread and butter or sand- wiches, if the bottom is cut first. The shaping of the cottage and Coburg loaves is not so difficult, but it is well to be careful in the very light handling of these as compared with the previous process of kneading. After the teacher has shaped her loaves and put them to rise, the children may be employed in scullery work or other cooking until their dough is sufficiently light to shape ; they also should write the bread recipe in their books. The teacher may put her bread now to bake in a hot oven, and explain clearly that the heat must be lowered after the first io minutes. Then comes the dividing of the dough for the childrenâ€™s loaves. Cut it up into as many pieces as there are children. By this time it will be doubled in bulk, so there ought to be about enough for two loaves for each child, and one may be a Coburg and the other a tin loaf or baked in a jam jar. If there is not enough, half the class might make one kind and half the other. These may then be put to rise, and the boards and tables scrubbed. The monitors must now be responsible for baking the bread. The class should be made to understand that

28 INSTRUCTION IN COOKERY It is done as above, but a few hops are added. All these methods are really only of use to start the dough. It is much better, having begun the fermentation of the flour in this way, to keep back about 2 tablespoonfuls of the dough, and then place this in a wide-necked bottle with a screw top, with sugar and warm water, to make the dough quite thin again, and leave this covered up in a warm place all night. Place this in the middle of the flour and knead it in the ordinary way. Allow it to rise till nearly three times the bulk of the flour. The quantity needed must be regulated by experience. It is much affected by the temperature of a climate like India, for instance, less being required in warm weather than in cold. A good reliable baking-powder is made as follows: 8 02. of flour, 4 oz. tartaric acid, 4 oz. cream of tartar, 6 oz. carbonate of soda. Sieve this and store in a dry tin. Soda Bread, etc.â€”Use J pint of butter-milk or sour milk, and 1 teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda. Mix this into the flour until it is the consistency of dough. In a previous paragraph I alluded to the substitution of potatoes for flour in bread. This is a fraud if it is proved that the bread was sold as made with flour, but in a household where a large number of potatoes have been cooked, it would be a good and economical way of using them up to work them into the bread next day; but it must be remembered that, if it is desired to have them light and floury, they must be sieved immediately after cooking, before being allowed to get cold, and many kinds of potatoes become sticky and glutinous if mashed when cold.

31 CHAPTER III THE SYLLABUS FOR CHILDREN UNDER some education authorities a teacher is allowed to draw up her own syllabus, and in the hands of a skilful and sympathetic teacher this is a privilege which cannot be too highly valued. It is not possible to give a model syllabus which will exactly meet the requirements of every child in the many schools in the country. The age of the pupils, the length of the course, the number of courses possible during the school-life of the child, and the length of the lessons, must be taken carefully into consideration. The keynote of the best syllabus is always the needs of the neighbourhood, and is based on the probable income of the parents of the children attending the class. In London a skeleton syllabus has been drawn up based on the incomes and figures supplied in Charles Booth’s ‘ Life and Labour of the Peopled This gives the three standards as £2 10s., £1 18s., and £1 8s., and the families are supposed to include father and mother and four children.

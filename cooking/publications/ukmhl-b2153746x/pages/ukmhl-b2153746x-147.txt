These are the first volumes in a series designed to enforce the idea, so all-important in young people’s education, that history begins at home. The volumes are meant to bring history into connection with scenes which their readers know, to illustrate manners by local examples, and to teach that every place has its interest and its story. These associations may not in each district be described in full, but enough is told of them to give the small student the clue to their existence, and to teach him how to look for them in old buildings, names of places, and the natural features of his own county and neigh- bourhood. Maps and illustrations are freely added, and each county volume is written by an author who has made a special study of the county he treats.

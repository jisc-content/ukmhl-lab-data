209 MISCELLANEOUS. TO CLEAN PLATE, KNIVES, LAMPS AND THE KITCHEN UTENSILS. A good housekeeper never should neglect to have everything belonging to the table, clean and in good order. The silver plate ought to be washed from time to time with Spanish soap; without this precaution, it will become black and a bad colour. When the plate is cleaned, rub it with a chamois leather, which will make it bright; occasionally use hartshorn powder mixed with gin, and then polish it off with the chamois. When the plate is cleaned, the knives should be looked to; nothing should be neglected. The lamps should be cleaned every day; wipe the glasses, and cut the wicks. Half an hour before you light them, fill them with oil. The stew and saucepans should be carefully looked to and cleaned, as serious illnesses have been caused by a neglect of this care. When the pans are cleaned they ought not to be exposed to the sun or fire to dry them quicker. Spanish soap and water is the best thing to clean kitchen utensils. THE END.

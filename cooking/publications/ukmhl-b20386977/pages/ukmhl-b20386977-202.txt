SWEET DISHES. 170 or orange-flowers pralinee, with about the size of an egg of butter; add four yolks of eggs. Do not boil, but spread this on a dish; when cold, cut it into pieces, make them into balls, dip each into the beaten yolks of eggs, roll them in bread crumbs, and fry them. Just as they are done and a good colour, take them off, drain them, sift sugar over them, and serve hot. CREPES DE POMMES. Make a thick batter with eggs, cream, grated nutmeg, a glass of brandy, a pinch of salt, a little sugar, and a little flour; add some essence of vanille, or steep a stick of vanille in the batter an hour before you mix it with the apples. Pare some good baking apples, take out the cores, and chop them fine; then mix with the batter. Drop a spoonful of the batter in the frying-pan in which you have melted some butter, and which is boiling hot; take the crepes out, and dish them, sifting white sugar over them.

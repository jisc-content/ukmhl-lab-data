20 SOUPS. POTAGE AU LIEVRE. Cut up a good old hare^ with all the blood you can save from it; put it into a stewpan^ or soup- pot^ with as much beef stock as will cover it; then stew slowly till the hare is tender; boil the liver till tender in stock; rub it through a tamis ; mix it with a little of the soup^ till quite thin and smooth; add this to the soup; season with a clove, a blade of mace, pepper, and salt; let it boil a few^ minutes, and add half a bottle of good red wine : port, in England, is the best. You must serve the best of the meat cut in fillets, with a few small forcemeat balls. Very good. POTAGE AUX LAPINS A LA EEINE. Take a large rabbit, or two small ones, one pound of lean ham, one onion stuck with a clove, one turnip, some celery, a clove of garlic, and two quarts of water; put them into a stewpan, and let the rabbits stew till tender; then strain off the soup through a tamis; then boil a pint of thin cream, and add to it the best part of the meat of the rabbits cut in neat small fillets, and some of it pounded fine; put this in the soup if not thick enough; add a little flour and butter, or two eggs well beaten with a spoonful of milk.

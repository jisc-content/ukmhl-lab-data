144 FISH. CHAD AU BLEU. Wash and clean your chad; stew it in court bouillon like salmon, and serve on a napkin gar- nished with parsley. Serve oil and vinegar in a sauce-boat. CHAD A L'OSEILLE. Having cleaned and prepared your chad, put it to steep with oil, salt, pepper, chives, parsley, thyme, and bay-leaf; then fry it, basting it with the marinade in which it was steeped; serve it on stewed sorrel. Or you may serve it with caper sauce. MACKAREL A LA MAITRE D'HOTEL. Clean your mackarel, wipe it, and split it down the back. If you wish it to be very good and delicate, steep it an hour in a little oil with pepper, salt, and fennel; fry it, basting it with the marinade in which it was steeped. When it is done, melt some butter mixed with chopped parsley, pepper, and salt; put your mackarel on this seasoning on the dish, and add a spoonful of vinegar to the sauce or the juice of a lemon. You may serve mackarel, after dressing it as be- fore, with oil and vinegar, or tomata sauce, or sauce tartare.

MUTTON. 114 HARICOT DE MOUTON. Take the loin, the neck, or part of the shoulder, and cut it in pieces. Put the cutlets on in butter to brown in a pan; take them out, and make a roux with some flour in the melted butter. Add some stock, pepper, salt, bunch of sweet herbs, cloves, bay-leaf, clove of garlic, and put your meat into the sauce. Whilst stewing, fry some turnips and haricots in butter till a good colour, then add them to the meat. Let all stew together a short time, skim the sauce, and serve with the meat, garnished with turnip roses. MUTTON KIDNEYS A LA BROCHETTE. Let your kidneys steep five minutes in cold water, to soften the skin; remove it, and split each through the middle; put a wooden or silver skewer, if you have them ; when they are skewered, season them with pepper and salt. Dip each into oil or melted butter, and broil them on a gridiron. Before you serve, remove the skewers, unless they are of silver, and serve them on a dish with butter and fine herbs.

206 MISCELLANEOUS. sprinkle the inside with fine salt^ and place them in a stone jar^ which fill with water^ and throw a good handful of salt; let them remain a night. The next day change the water^ put two or three handsful of salt and a glass of vinegar to make a strong pickle. Cover it with melted butter; and when you wish to use them^ steep them in luke- warm water, to take off the taste of the pickle, and boil or stew them. TO PRESERVE BEANS. Gather them when full size, pick them, and scald them a few minutes, but do not let them lose their colour. After having drained them, and let them get cool, put them in a stone jar, that will hold two or three quarts, but do not let them be closely packed, so as to let the pickle be between them ; put a handful of salt into the water; the next day throw off the water, and pour a stronger pickle over them, two parts water and one part vinegar, with two or three handsful of salt, and pour over all some melted butter. The beans will preserve their colour and flavour prepared thus.

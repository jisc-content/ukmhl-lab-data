PORK. 120 PORK. ROASTED PIG. Scald the pig in boiling water, scrape and prepare it as usual, when well cleaned and singed, put it on a spit, baste it with oil, and serve hot, with sauce made of the liver chopped fine with sage, a little shalot, thyme, parsley, cream, pepper, salt, a little butter mixed with flour, and a spoonful of stock. When you serve, your pig should be a nice brown, split it in half, garnish with the feet cut in two, and a little clear plain gravy, serve the same in a sauce boat j serve also, to suit every palate, a sauce made with dried currants, but this sauce is too English to have a place in the receipt book, which is purely French. PORK ROASTED A LA FRANCAISE.

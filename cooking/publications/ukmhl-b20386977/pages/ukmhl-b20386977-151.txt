119 LAMB. whilst preparing the blanquette and breast^ cut the neck into cutlets, season them with pepper and salt, fry them or broil on a gridiron ; arrange them on a dish in the form of a crown, alter- nately with the breast, serve the blanquette in the middle. This is a very good dish, and has three preparations on the same dish. LAMB'S HEAD AND PLUCK. Scald the pluck, when cold mince it very fine; mix the brains with it, and stew in stock with a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion, pepper, salt, a bit of. lemon-peel, and a little nutmeg; when stewed enough, add a little cream and the yolk of an egg. Put on your dish, with the head laid on it prepared as follows:â€”Scald your head till nearly done, in water and salt, then take it out, and pour over it the yolk of an egg or two beaten well; then strew bread crumbs thickly over it, again baste with the egg, and again shake bread crumbs over it, put it into the oven till brown, shake pepper and salt over it, and serve it. You may vary this by substituting some jams for the cream and egg. Very good.

SOUPS, 2 then strain oflf for use^ and when cold^ before you use it take off any fat that rises. The meat should be stewed to rags to have all the good out of it j the stock should be a jelly. You may make a stock with the meat and vegetables^ put on with some warm water to stew; this will be found very useful in the kitchen to assist in gravies or soups made with vegetables, or the gravies that require stock; but this will not keep beyond a couple of days. The first stock will keep a week^ if required, with a little more seasoning. VEAL STOCK. Take some veal, put it into a stewpan with a slice of bacon, or the knuckle-bone of ham, let both stand by the fire, closely covered, half an hour, till a pale gold colour; then fill your stew- pan with water, and add onions, carrots and half a pound of beef, to improve the consistency; but this is left to taste, as some prefer it without the beef, as being more delicate. Let it stew slowly till done enough; pass it through the tamis. When you want this for invalids leave out the bacon and the beef, and add chervil. You can serve it with rice or vermicelli; and it will be a nice, nourishing soup.

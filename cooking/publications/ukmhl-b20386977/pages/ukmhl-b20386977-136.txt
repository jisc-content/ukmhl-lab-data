104 VEAL. FRICANDEAU. Lard a slice of veal^ or a fillet; put in a stew- pan some pieces of bacon, with onions, carrots, bunch of sweet herbs, cloves, and put your fri- candeau on the seasoning; add a little stock, and baste your fricandeau occasionally with a little of the sauce. When it is done enough, and a good colour, take out the fricandeau, keep it hot whilst you skim and reduce the sauce; add a little potato flour to thicken it; then put in the fricandeau to warm; serve with the sauce in which it was stewed, or if you have too much sauce, keep it to season the sorrel, or chicory, you serve with the fricandeau if you like. BLANQUETTE DE VEAU. You make a blanquette of veal with any part that has been roasted, cut in small pieces; put in a stewpan some butter, melt it with a little flour, salt, pepper, parsley, and thyme, and put your veal into this, and moisten with some stock; before you serve, add a liaison of eggs beaten with cream; a little nutmeg or lemon-peel grated is a great improvement.

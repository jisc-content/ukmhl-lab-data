SYRUPS. 197 best, put them into an earthen-jar, and set it into a pan of cold water; let it boil until quite clear, strain it well when done, and bottle for use; cork it close. This syrup is very good for making orange or lemon-jelly, or lemonade. The jelly is made by adding one ounce of isinglass dissolved in a pint of water, and putting the syrup to your taste ; it will make a clear fine jelly. When cold, turn it out. RASPBERRY VINEGAR. Pick two pounds of ripe raspberries, then let them steep four or five days in strong vinegar; strain it off without squeezing it; add two pounds of sugar broken, and clarified to each quart, let it simmer very gently on a slow fire, stirring it to mix the sugar well with the vinegar, when it boils strain through a tamis, and when cold, bottle it for use. You can add half the quantity of vinegar to the raspberries, and let it steep three or four days; then squeeze through a tamis. This will be good, but not as clear, and will answer for present use.

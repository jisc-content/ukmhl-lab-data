FRESH-WATER FISH. 153 herbs, onions, cloves, garlic, mushrooms, salt and pepper; on this seasoning lay your fish, pour over it some red wine, and hang it on a crook, and let it stew slowly. When the wine is ready to boil, throw into the kettle some bits of butter rolled in flour; stir the sauce; add a glass of brandy, and let it take fire. When the sauce is reduced, serve. Arrange the fish on a dish, with the seasoning round it. Take out the bunch of sweet herbs, and garnish with fried sippets of bread. PIKE AU BLEU, OR COURT BOUILLON. Do not scale the pike, but merely clean and wash it; then dress it in the same sauce as salmon, and serve with oil and vinegar. Pike may be served with caper sauce, after being boiled in court bouillon. You may also serve it with a farce inside, made in the usual way, and bake your fish, basting it with butter occa- sionally, till done. You may grate some bread crumbs, and mix with pepper, salt, and chopped parsley, and about ten minutes before you serve, strew them over the pike.

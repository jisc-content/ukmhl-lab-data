143 FISH. COD AU BLANC. Take a fine cod, sprinkle salt over it for a day or two; put it in a fish-kettle full of cold water; take it off after it boils up, cover the kettle for ten or fifteen minutes, drain it, melt some butter in a stewpan, add a little flour, pepper, and some cream; put your cod quite hot on your dish, and serve with the sauce poured over it. Slices of cod that has been dressed can be served with the same sauce, but in this case the fish must be warmed in the sauce. Nutmeg grated, or a blade of mace is an improvement. COD A LA MAITRE D'HOTEL. Dress your cod as before, put on your dish with a piece of butter some pepper, chives, and parsley chopped fine, grated nutmeg, and ver- juice or vinegar. Mix well with butter, and serve your fish on it. COD WITH CAPERS. Dress it as before, and pour over it some white sauce with capers. You may also serve cod with small potatoes boiled in water, with white sauce, with or without capers, and anchovy essence.

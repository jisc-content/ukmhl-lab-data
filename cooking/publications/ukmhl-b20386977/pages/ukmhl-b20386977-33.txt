FRENCH COOKERY roB, ENGLISH FAMILIES. SOUPS. STOCK. Take six pounds of beef^ or a leg-bone of beef, pour over it six quarts of water, or more, in pro- portion to the quantity of the meat, using to each pound of meat a quart of water; let it stew slowly for an hour to draw out the gravy; let it come to nearly a boil, till the scum rises and is cleared off; then add some carrots, turnips, leeks, a parsnip, celery, and a clove of garlic, an onion, three or four cloves, six whole peppers. The vegetables will cause more scum to rise, which you must skim off, and let the stock stew very gently, keeping it closely covered till done enough, B

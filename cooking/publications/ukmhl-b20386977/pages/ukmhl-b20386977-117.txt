ANOTHER MODE. Mash some boiled potatoes quite smooth with a large piece of butter, some boiled cream, pow- dered sugar, a pinch of salt, and some eggs, with a little grated lemon-peel; do not mix all toge- ther, but add by degrees as you mash the pota- toes ; make it into a firm paste, and put it on a paste-board sprinkled with flour; make little balls, roll them in flour, melt some butter, and when very hot, put in your balls. Turn them so that each side might be a good colour; take care they are not too brown; serve with sugar dusted over them hot. You may give any flavour you like, and if you add a glass or two of wine, or one of brandy, with a little nutmeg, it improves the flavour, but this is left to taste.

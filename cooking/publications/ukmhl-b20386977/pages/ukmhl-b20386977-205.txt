CREAMS. 173 This cream is very delicate, and also served on trifles, wliicli you prepare as follows : Take either spunge-cakes or Savoy biscuits—the first is best —steep them in wine with brandy, one-third of the latter to two-thirds of wine. When well steeped, put them in your trifle-dish in a layer, or steep them in the dish, which is better, then put a layer of macaroons on them, baste them with wine, then put a layer of apricots, raspberry or strawberry-jam, cover this with a rich custard, which should be thick, add some pieces of pre- served citron also, and cover it with the whipped cream, drained first on a sieve. CREAMS IN MOULDS. Boil a quart of cream with a stick of vanille, lemon-peel, or a few bitter almonds, sweeten it to taste. When boiling, add an ounce of isin- glass dissolved and clarified; let it boil a few minutes, pass it through a tamis after allowing it to settle a few minutes to let any sediment fall to the bottom, then pour it into your moulds; and when cold, turn out. These creams will be much lighter, if you whisk them well till set and thick, before you put them into your moulds.

194 SYRUPS. SYRUPS. SYRUP FOR LIQUORS. Boil two pounds of sugar with a quart of water; strain it^ and add by degrees another quart of water. When finished^ and you have a good syrup, add the white of an egg beaten with the shell; let it boil up; then strain through a jelly-bag for use. Bottle it close. SYRUP OF PRESERVED FRUITS. Take the juice of any preserved fruit you may have left after filling the pots, add some clarified sugar, and boil together. This, mixed with cream, serves in place of jam, or will make a refreshing drink. SYRUP TO GLAZE FRUIT. Boil a wine-glass of fruit, add two pounds of sugar, and let it boil till you find that when you put in your spoon, and take it out of your syrup, you see threads that will break between your fingers. This syrup is used to glaze all kinds of fruit, such as grapes, currants, &c., which you dip in.

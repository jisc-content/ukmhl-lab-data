Prepare your artichokes as before; boil them ten minutes, and remove the choke; put in place of it a farce made with onions, parsley, mush- rooms, some veal or poultry minced fine, and grated bacon ; fry them in butter, and make into forcemeat; then fill your artichokes. Put them on a slow fire in butter to stew slowly, till done enough, then take them out of the butter and serve them either alone or with sauce blanche, or to your taste. In place of butter, you may put strips of bacon below and above them to stew; they are more savoury and rich. Artichokes, as I have said, can be boiled and served with oil and vinegar. Small young arti- chokes may be served raw with oil and vinegar. You may also serve them with sauce made as follows :â€” Take two hard yolks of eggs; pound them fine and mix them in a sauce-boat, with pepper, salt, shalots, and fine herbs, with or without a clove of garlic, according to your taste; well mix these ingredients with some vinegar, and when quite smooth add some oil, which mix well; then serve with artichokes plainly boiled as before. This sauce is very good; your artichokes may be cold or hot.

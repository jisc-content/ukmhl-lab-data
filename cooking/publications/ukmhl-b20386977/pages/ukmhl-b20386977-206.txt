CREAMS. 174 BAVAROISES Are made in the same manner, with this diffe- rence, that in place of the vanille or lemon-peel, you use raspberry or strawberry juice in summer, or jelly in winter. You may also make it with water in place of cream, but it is not so rich, though many prefer it. Cream whipped with any essence you please, sweetened to taste, and put in a small cheese-vat on a napkin, or use a sieve for four-and-twenty hours, then turned out is very good. CREPES A LA CREME. Boil a pint of cream for five minutes with a stick of cinnamon, a few coriander-seeds and two ounces of sugar; let it cool, and then mix in it three table-spoonsful of flour and six eggs well beaten, strain it through a tamis. Stir in it two ounces of melted butter, a little grated nutmeg, and a little salt, then put a piece of butter into a frying-pan. When it is hot, put in a tea-cup full of the batter, fry them a nice brown without turning, as they are very delicate, and apt to break; serve with sugar sifted over them.

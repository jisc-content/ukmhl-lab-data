171 CREAMS. CREAMS. CREME FRITE. Boil a quart of cream, add two spoonsful of flour, some sugar and lemon-peel, grated; stir it, and let it stew till the raw taste of the flour has gone off. When it is cool, mix three eggs with it; pour this batter on a dish well floured, and when it is cold, cut it in pieces, and fry them in butter. Sift sugar over, and serve with sauce made with wine, sugar, nutmeg and arrow-root, or butter. I prefer the first. CREME A LA FLEUR D'OBANGE. Boil a quart of cream, or good milk; when boiling, add sugar to taste, and some orange- flower water. Beat six or seven eggs, leaving out half the whites, pour them into your cream; then put this into your dish, and bake it, or put it covered into a pan of boiling water, and put hot cinders on the cover; serve in the dish. Vanille may be used in place of the orange-flower water, or lemon-peel may be boiled with the milk in place of the other to flavour it. A good cook will vary this at pleasure.

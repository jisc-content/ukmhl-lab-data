VEGETABLES. 86 YAMS May be dressed in the same mode as potatoes, or plainly baked. TKUFFLES Are used in several ragouts^ and with roast turkey or capons; and give a delicious flavour to any dish or pie to which they are added. They may also be served alone. TEUFFLES AU NATUREL. Wash and brush your truffles well; then wrap up each in a slice of bacon, and then in several folds of oiled paper; put them in hot ashes; let them remain an hour; take off* the paper and bacon, and serve. You may, if more convenient, bake them in a hot oven, wrapped up in the bacon and paper; but they will require a longer time. TRUFFLES AU VIN. After cleaning and brushing your truffles, put them into a stewpan, with some slices of fat bacon; add a bunch of sweet herbs, salt, bay- leaf and a bottle of white wine, or champagne. Let them boil three quarters of an hour, and serve with the sauce reduced, or without any sauce, if preferred.

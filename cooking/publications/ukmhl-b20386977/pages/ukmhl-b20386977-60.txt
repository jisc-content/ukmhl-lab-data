SOUPS. 28 pieces of veal and put it back in the stewpan to boil^ and serve; rice boiled separately. This soup does not properly belong to a French cookery book, but I have given it, as it is a genuine Indian receipt. BOUILLON A L'HEURE, OU A LA MINUTE. Take a piece of beef, cut it into slices, and put it into a stewpan with a little water, a carrot, onion, and a turnip, cut in pieces. When the meat and vegetables are stewed, and begin to stick to the bottom of the stewpan, with a little water, quite boiUng, add some salt; let it boil half an hour, and strain it through a tamis. You may, if you like, chop the meat fine, and put it in the stewpan, with the water and the vegetables at the same time. BOUILLON DE VEAU. Take a piece of veal, or some of the pluck, and stew it an hour in a quart of water with different kinds of sweet herbs, an onion, clove, salt, pepper, some lettuce leaves, and chervil. When the meat is done you may either strain through a tamis, and serve with rice or, not strained, with the vegetables.

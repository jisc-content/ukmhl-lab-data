MISCELLANEOUS. 208 onions^ garlic^ allspice^ cloves^ and whole pepper- corns. If you wish your gherkins to be perfect at the end of a week^ take away the vinegar, and fill it up with fresh, adding more spices and pepper. Cover your jar closely to exclude the air, which spoils the taste and look of the gher- kins; a few capsicums added improves the flavour, but take care they are red, and fully ripe, as those that are green spoil the flavour and makes them bitter. TO PRESERVE FRUITS. The more firm and hard the fruits are, the better they will preserve ripe fruits. Fruits with seeds preserve easier then those with kernels. The fruit to be preserved should be placed in a close room, which should also be dark. Lay them on planks, so that they cannot touch each other, as that spoils them sooner. If your fruit is very choice and fine, wrap them separately in paper bags and hang them from nails or crooks fixed in the shelves. Bunches of grapes are preserved in the same manner, the stalk at the bottom, or it is still better to put them in close drawers to exclude the air.

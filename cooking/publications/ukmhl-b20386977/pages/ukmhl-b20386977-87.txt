GARNITURES. 55 GARNITURE AUX HARICOTS. Wash your haricots^ and boil them in water; change the water when they are half done; season with salt^ an onion stuck with a clove, a carrot and a little celery, which you tie together, and add a bit of bacon. When done enough, strain them through a sieve, and put them in a stew- pan, with some butter and a little Hour; turn them till they brown; then add a little chopped onion, and turn it till the onion is done enough; moisten it with jus; let it boil, and keep con- stantly stirring it; then add your haricots, and stew slowly till done. This is good round roast mutton or beef. GARNITURE DE CHAMPIGNONS. Put your mushrooms in a stewpan, with some butter, parsley and chives; when warm add a little flour, and moisten with stock.

VEGETABLES. 87 MUSHROOMS. You must be very careful in the selection of good ones^ as it is highly dangerous to eat any that are of the wrong sort^ for many persons have been poisoned from it. And always bear in mind that to be wholesome, mushrooms must be stewed for many hours. CHAMPIGNONS EN CAISSE. Take some good fine mushrooms, peel them, cut off the stalks, and then cut the mushrooms into pieces; make a paper case or little box, butter or oil it well; put your mushrooms in the case, with some butter, chives chopped, and parsley, salt, pepper; then fry them in a pan, or put the case on a gridiron to do very slowly. Serve in the paper hot. If you stew the mush- rooms first with a little butter, before you cut them in pieces, they will be better done, and more wholesome; but this is left to the judgment of the cook. CHAMPIGNONS SUE, LE GRILLE. Take some large mushrooms, pick off the skin, and cut the stalk; put them on the gridiron, with the hollow sides uppermost; fill the inside with some butter, pepper, salt, fine herbs chopped; and when done enough serve.

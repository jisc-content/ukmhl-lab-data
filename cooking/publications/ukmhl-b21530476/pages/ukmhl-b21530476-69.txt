PISH. 3 They are caught in the Tliames and some other large rivers. MuUels.—The sea are preferred to the river mullets, and the red to the grey. They should be very firm.— Tlieir season is August. Gudgeons.—Thtj are chosen by the same rules as other fish. They are taken in ninning stre.ams ; come in about midsummer, and are to be had for five or six months. Eels. There is a greater difference in the goodness of eels than of any other fish. The true silver-eel (so called from the bright colour of the belly) is caught in the Thames. The Dutch eels sold at Billingsgate are ^ery bad ; those taken in great Hoods are generally good, but in ponds they have usually a strong rank flavour. Bxcept the middle of summer, they are always in season. Lobsters. If they have not been long taken, the claws will have a strong motion when you put your fin- ger on the eyes and press them. The heaviest are the best, and it is preferable to boil them at home. When you buy them ready-boiled, try whether their tails are stiff and pull up with a spring ; otherwise that part will be flabby. The cock lobster is known by the narrow back part of his tail, and the two uppermost fins within it are stiff and hard ; but those of the hen are soft, and the tail broader. The male, though generally smaller, has the highest flavour, the flesh is firmer, and the colour when boiled is a deener red. Crabs. Ihe heaviest are best, and those of a mid- dling size are sweetest. If light they are watery: when in perfection the joints of the legs are stiff, and the body has a very agreeable smell. The eyes look dead and loose when stale. Praicns and Shrimps.—When fresh they have a sweet flavour, are firm and stiff, and the colour is bright.—

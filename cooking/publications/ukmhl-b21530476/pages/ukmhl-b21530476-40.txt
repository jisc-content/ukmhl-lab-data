xxxviii ODSEUVATIONS FOR THE ranee prevails on necessary subjects, among those who are not backward in frivolous ones. It is very necessary for a woman to be informed of theprices and goodness of all articles in common use, and of the best times, as well as places, for purchasing them. She should also be acquainted with the comparative prices of provisions, in order that she may be able to substitute those that are most reasonable, when they will answer as well for others of the same kind, but which are more costly. A false notion of economy leads many to purchase, as bargains, what is _ not wanted, and sometimes never is us^, Were this error avoided, more money would remain for other purposes. It is not un- usual among lower dealers to put off a larger quantity of goods, by assurances that they are advancing in price ; and many who supply fancy articles are so successful in ]iersuasion, that pur- chasers not unfrequently go far beyond their original intention, even to their own future disquiet. Some things are better for keeping, and, being in constant consumption, should be laid in accordingly; such as paper, soap, and candles. Of these, more hereafter. To give unvarying rules cannot be attempted: for people ought to form tlieir conduct on their circumstances; but it is presumeti that a judicious arrangement, according to them, will be found equally advantageous to all.

Such a degree of judgment will be respectable even in the eyes of domestics, if they are not interested in the Ignorance of their employers; and if they arc, their services will not compensate for want of honesty. When young ladies marry, they frequently continue their own maids in the capacity or house-keeper,s who, as they may be more attached to their interest than strangers, become very valuable servants. To such, the economical observations in this work will be as useful as the cookery; and it is recom- mcndable in them to be strictly observant of both, which, in the course of a year or two, will make them familiar in the practice. it is rnuch to be feared, that for the waste of many of the good things that God has given for our use, not abuse, the mis- tress and servants of great houses will hereafter be called to a strict account. Some part of every person’s fortune should be devoted to charity: by which “ a pious woman will build up her house before God, while she that is foolish (i. e. lends nothing to the laird,} pulls it down with her hands.” No one can complaii*

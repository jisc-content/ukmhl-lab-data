SOUPS. 10* Wlien fat remains on any soup, a tea-cupful of flour and water mixed quite smooth, and boiled-in, will take it off. If richness, or greater consistency be wanted, a good lump of butter mixed with flour, and boiled in the soup, will give either of these qualities. Long boiling is necessary to give the full flavour of the ingredients, therefore time should be allowed for soups and gravies; and they are best if made tbe'day be- fore they are wanted. Soups and gravies are far better when the meat is put at the bottom of the pan, and stewed, and the herbs, roots, &c. with butter, than when water is put to the meat at first; and the gravy that is drawn from the meat should be almost dried up before the water is put to it. Donâ€™t use the sediment of gravies, &c. that have stood to be cold. When onions are strong, boil a turnip with them, if for sauce; this will make them mild. If soups or gravies are too weak, do not cover them in boiling, that the watery particles may evaporate. A clear jelly of Cow-heels is very useful to keep in the house, being a great improvement to soups and gravies. Truffles and morels thicken soups and sauces, and give them a fine flavour. Wash half an ounce of each care- fully, then simmer them a few minutes in water, and add them with the liquor, to boil in the sauce, &c. till tender. SOUPS, &c. Scotch Mutton Broth.

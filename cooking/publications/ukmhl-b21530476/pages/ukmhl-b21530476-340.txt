274 DOMESTIC COOKERY, lump-sugar, boil the quantity half an hour, taking off the scum as it rises. When cool enough, put to it a crust of toasted bread dipped in thick yeast, let the li- quor ferment in the tub thirty-six hours; then into the cask put for every gallon the peel of two and rind of one lemon, and both of one Seville orange, and one gal- lon of cowslip-pips, then pour on them thq liquor. It must be carefully stirred every d.ay for a w^k; then to every five gallons put in a bottle of brandy. Let the cask be close stopped, and stand only six weeks before you bottle off. Observe to use the best corks. Elder Wine. To every quart of berries put two quarts of water, boil half an hour, run the liquor, and break the frait through a hair sieve; then to every quart of juice, put three quaiters of a pound of Lisbon sugar, coarse, but not the very coarsest. Boil the whole a quarter of an hour with some Jamaica peppers, ginger, and a few cloves. Pour ft into a tub, and when of a proper warmth, into the bar- rel, with toast and yeast to work, which there is more difficulty to make it do than most other liquors. When it ceases to hiss, put a quart of brandy to eight gallons, and stop up. Bottle in the spring or at Christmas. The liquor must be in a warm place to make it work. ^V^lite Elder Wine, very much like Frontiniae. Boil eighteen pounds of white powder sugar, with six gallons of water, and two whites of eggs well beaten; then skim it, and put in a quarter of a peck of elder- flowers from the tree that bears whiie berries; donâ€™t keep them on the fire. When near cold, stir it, and put in si.x spoonfuls of lemon-juice, four or five of yeast, and beat well into the liquor; stir it every day; put six pounds of the best raisins, stoned, into the cask, ami tun the wine. Stop it close, and bottle in six months. When well kept, this wine will pass for Frontiniae.

SOUPS. 107 is done to rags. Add cream, vermicelli, and almonds, as will be directed in the next receipt, and a roll. An excellent white Soup. Take a scrag of mutton, a knuckle of veal after cutting off as much meat as will make collops, two or three shank-bones of mutton nicely cleaned, and a quarter of a pound of very fine undrest lean gammon of bacon; with a hunch of sweet herhs, a piece of fresh lemon-peel, two or three onions, three blades of mace, and a desert-spoon- ful of white pepper; boil all in three quarts of water, till the meal falls quite to pieces. Next day take off the fat, clear the jelly from the sediment, and put it into a sauce- pan of the nicest tin. If macaroni is used, it should be added soon enough to get perfectly tender, after soaking in cold water. Vermicelli may be added after the thick- ening, as it requires less time to do. Have ready the thickening, which is to be made as follows : Blanch a quarter of a pound of sweet almonds, and beat them to a paste in a marble mortar, with a spoonful of water to prevent their oiling; mince a large slice of drest veal or chicken, and beat with it apiece of stale white bread; add all this to a pint of thick cream, a hit of fresh lemon-peel, and a blade of mace, in the finest powder. Boil it a few minutes; add to it a pint of soup, and strain and pulp it through a coarse sieve ; this thick- ening is then fit for putting to the rest, which should boil for half an hour afterwards. A plainer white Soup. Two or three pints of soup may be made of a small knuckle of veal, with seasoning as directed in the last article; and both served together, with the addition of a quarter of a pint of good milk. Two spoonfuls of cream, and a little ground rice, will give it a proper thickness. Gillet Soup. Scald and clean three or four seta of ijoose or duck

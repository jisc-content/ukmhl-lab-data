CAKES. 251 Eggs should be very long beaten, whites and yolks apart, and always strained. Sugar should he rubbed to a powder on a clean board, and sifted through a very fine hair or lawn-sieve. Lemon-peel should be pared very thin, and with a little sugar beaten in a marble mortar to a paste, and then mixed with a little wine, or cream, so as to di- vide easily among the other ingredients. After all the articles are put into the pan, they shoul^ be thoroughly and long beaten, as the lightness of the cake depends much on their being well incorporated. Whether black or white plum-cakes, they require less butter and eggs for having yeast, and eat equally light and rich. If the leaven be only of flour, milk and water, and yeast, it becomes more tough, and is less easily divided, than if the butter be first put with those ingredients, and the dough afterwards set to rise by the fire. The heat of the oven is of great importance for cakes, especially those that are large. If not pretty quick, the batter will not rise. Should you fear its catching by being too quick, put some paper over the cake to pre- vent its being burnt. If not long enough lighted to have a body of heat, or it is become slack, the cake will be heavy. To know when it is soaked, take a broad- bladed knife that is very bright, and plunge it into the very centre, draw it instantly out, and if the least sticki- ness adheres, put the cake immediately in, and shut up the oven. If the heat was sufficient to raise, but not to soak, I have with great success had fresh fuel quickly put in, and kept the cakes hot till the oven was fit to finish the soaking, and they turned out extremely well. But those who are employed, ought to be particularly care- ful that no mistake occur from negligence when largo cakes are to be baked.

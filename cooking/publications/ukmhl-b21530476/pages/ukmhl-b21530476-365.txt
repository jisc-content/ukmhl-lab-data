SICK COOKERY. i’ilO PART XII. COOKERY FOR THE SICK, AND FOR THE POOR. SICK COOKERY. General Remarks. The folloTfving pages ■will contain cookery for the sick; it being of more consequence to support those whose bad appetite will not allow them to take the necessary nou- rishment, than to stimulate that of persons in health. It may not be unnecessary to advise that a choice be made of the things most likely to agree with the patient; that a change be provided ; that some one at least be always ready; that not too much of those be made at once, which are not likely to keep, as invalids require variety ; and that they should succeed each other in dif- ferent forms and flavours. A clear Broth that tciU keep long. Put the mouse round of beef, a knuckle bone of veal, and a few shanks of mutton, into a deep pan, and cover close with a dish or coarse crust; bake till the beef is done enough for eating, with onlj as much water as will cover. "When cold, cover it close in a cool place. When to be used, give what flavour may be approved. A quick made Broth. Take a bone or two of a neck or loin of mutton, take off the fat and skin, set it on the fire in a small tin sauce- pan that has a cover, with three quarters of a pint of water, the meat being first beaten, and cut in thin bits; put a bit of thyme and parsley, and, if approved, a slicrf of onion. Let it boil very quick, skim it nicely, take off the cover, if likely to be too weak; else cover it. Half an hour is sufficient for the whole process.

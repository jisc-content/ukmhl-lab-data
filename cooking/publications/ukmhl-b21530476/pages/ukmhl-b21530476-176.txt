DOMESTIC COOKERY. 110 ancliovy or two. Simmer these with some good whole or split peas; the smaller the quantity of water at first, the better. Simmer till the peas will pulp through a colander; then set the pulp, and more of the liquor that boiled the peas, with two carrots, a turnip, a leek, and a stick of celery cut into bits, to stew till all is quite tender. The last requires less time; an hour will do for it. When ready, put fried bread cut into dice, dried mint rubbed fine, pepper, and (if wanted) salt, into the tureen, and pour the soup in. Green-Peas Soup. In shelling the peas, divide the old from the young ; put the old ones, with an ounce of butter, a pint of water, the outside leaves of a lettuce or two, two onions, pepper and salt, to stew till you can pulp the peas; and when you have done so, put to the liquor that stewed them some more water, the hearts and tender stalks of the lettuces, the young peas, a handful of spinach cut small, and salt and pepper to relish properly, and stew till quite soft. If the soup is too thin, or not rich enough, either of these faults may be removed by adding an ounce or two of butter, mixed with a spoonful of rice or wheat, flour and boiled with it half an hour. Be- fore serving, boil some green mint shred fine in the soup. When there is plenty of vegetables, no meat is neces- sary; but if meat be preferred, a pigâ€™s foot or ham-bone, &c. may be boiled with the old peas, which is called the stock. More butter than is mentioned above may be used with advantage, if the soup is required to be very rich. When peas first come in, or are very young, the stock may be made of the shells washed, and boiled till they will pulp with the above; more thickening will then ha wanted.

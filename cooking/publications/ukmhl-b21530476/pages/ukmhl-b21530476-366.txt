300 DOMESTIC COOKERY. A very supporting Broth against any kmd of weakness. Boil two pounds of loin of mutton, with a very large handful of chervil, in two quarts of water, to one. Take off part of the fat. Any other herb or roots may be added. Take half a pint three or four times a day. A very nourishing Veal Broth. Put the knuckle of a leg or shoulder of veal, with very little meat to it, an old fowl, and four shank bones of mutton extremely well soaked and bruised, three blades of mace, ten pepper-corns, an onion, and a large bit of bread, and three quarts of water, into a stew-pot that covers close, and simmer in the slowest manner after it has boiled up, and been skimmed ; or bake it; strain, and take off the fat. Salt as wanted. It will require four hours. Broth of Beef, Mutton, and Veal. Put two pounds of lean beef, one pound of scrag of veal, one pound of scrag of mutton, sweet herbs, and^ten pepper-corns, into a nice tin sauce-pan, with five quarts of water; simmer to three quarts; and clear from the fat when cold. Add one onion if approved. Soup and broth made of different meats, are more supporting, as well as better flavoured. lo remove the fat, take it off when cold as clean as possible; and if there be still any remaining, laj' a bit of clean blotting or cap paper on the broth when in the basin, and it will take up every particle. Calves' Feet Broth.

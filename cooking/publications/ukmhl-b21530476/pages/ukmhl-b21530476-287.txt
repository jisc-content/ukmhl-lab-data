SWEET DISHES. 221 oven a quarter of an hour, but do not let the top be- come hard. Another way.—Wash it well, and simmer in half milk, and half broth of veal or mutton, till it is tender. To a spoonful of this liquor, put the yolk of an egg beaten in a spoonful of cream; just make it hot to thicken, but not boil; puti t over the macaroni, and then grate fine old cheese all over, and bits of butter. Brown with the salamander. Another.—Wash the macaroni, then simmer it in a little broth, with a little pounded mace and salt. When quite tender, take it out of the liquor, lay it in a dish, grate a good deal of cheese over, than cover that with bread grated fine. AVarm some butter without oiling, and pour it from a boat through a little earthen colan- der all over the crumbs, then put the dish in a Dutch oven, to roast the cheese, and brown the bread of a fine colour. The bread should be in separated crumbs, and look light. Omtet. Make a batter of eggs and milk, and a very little flour; put to it chopped parsley, green onions, or chives, (the latter is best) or a very small quantity of shalot, a little pepper, salt, and a scrape or two of nutmeg. Make some butter boil in a small frying-pan, and pour the above batter into it; when one side is of a fine yel- low brown, turn it and do the other. Double it when served. Some scraped lean ham, or grated tongue, put in at first, is a very pleasant addition. Four eggs will make a pretty sized omlet; but many cooks will use eight or ten. A small proportion of flour should be used. If the taste be approved, a little taragon gives a fine flavour. A good deal of parsley should be used. Kamakins and omlet, though usually served in the course, would be much better if they were sent up after, that they might be eaten as hot as possible.

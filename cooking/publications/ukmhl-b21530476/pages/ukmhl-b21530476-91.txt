25 MEAT. PART II. MEATS. To choose Meats. Tenison.—If the fat be clear, bright, and thick, and tile cleft part smooth and close, it is young; but if the cleft is wide and tough, it is old. To judge of its sweet- ness, run a very sharp narrow knife into the shoulder or haunch, and you will know by the scent. Few peo- ple like it when it has much of the haut-gout. iieef.—If the flesh of o-v-beef is young, it will have a fine smooth open grain, be of a good red, and feel ten- der. The fat should look white rather than yellow; for when that is of a deep colour, the meat is seldom good; beef fed by oil-cakes is in general so, and the flesh is flabby. The grain of cow-beef is closer, and the fat whiter, than that of ox-beef; but the lean is not of so bright a red. The grain of bull-beef is closer still, the fat hard and skinny, the lean of a deep red, and a stronger scent. Ox-beef is the reverse. Ox-heef is the richest and largest; but in small families, and to some tastes, heifer-beef is better if finely fed. In old meat there is a streak of horn in the nbs of beef: the harder this is the older; and the flesh is not finely flavoured. Veal.—The flesh of a bull-calf is fii-mest, but not so white.

Choose the meat of which the kidney is well covered with a white thick fat. If the bloody vein in the shoulder looks blue, or of a bright red, it is newly killed; but any other colour shews it stale. The other parts should be dry and white; if clammy or

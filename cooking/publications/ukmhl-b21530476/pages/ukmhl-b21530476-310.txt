DOMESTIC COOKERY. 2-J4 straight one, for safety, ■will do very well; and if put by nicely cleaned, in a dry place, when done with, •will last for several years. Those of copper or brass are im- proper, as the tinning wears out by the scraping of the sweetmeat ladle. There is a new sort of iron, with a strong tinning, which promises to wear long. Sieves and spoons should be kept likewise for sweet things. Sweetmeats keep best in drawers that are not con- nected with a wall. If there be the least damp, cover them only with paper dipped in brandy, laid quite close, putting a little fresh over in spring, to prevent insect mould. When any sweetmeats are directed to be dried in the sun or in a stove, it will be best in private families, where there is not a regular stove for the purpose, to put them in the sun on flag-stones, which reflect the heat, and place a garden glass over them to keep insects off; or if put in an oven, to take care not to let it be too warm, and watch that they do properly and slowly. To‘keep Currants. The bottles being perfectly clean and dry, let the cur- rants be cut from the large stalks with the smallest bit of stalk to each, that the fruit not being wounded no moisture may be among them. It is necessary to ga- ther them when the weather is quite dry ; and if the servant can be depended upon, it is best to cut them under the trees, and let them drop gently into the bot- tles. Stop up the bottles with cork and rosin, and put them into the trench in the garden with the neck down- wards ; sticks should be placed opposite to where each sort of fruit begins. Cherries and Damsons keep in the same way. Currants may be scalded, as directed for gooseberries, the first method.

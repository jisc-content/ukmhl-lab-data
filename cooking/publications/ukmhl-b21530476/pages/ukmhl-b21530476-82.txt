16 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Stuffing for Pilsc, Haddock, and small Cod. Take equal parts of fat bacon, beef-suet, and fresh butter, some parsley, thyme, and savoury; a little onion, and a few leaves of scented marjoram shred fine; an anchovy or two; a little salt and nutmeg, and some pepper. Oysters will be an improvement with or with- out anchovies; add crumbs, and an egg to bind. SOLES. If boiled, they must be served with great care to look perfectly white, and should be much covered with parsley. If fried, dip in egg, and cover them with fine crumbs of bread; set on a frying-pan that is just large enough, and put into it a large quantity of fresh lard or dripping, boil it, and immediately slip the fish into it; do them of a fine brown. See to fry, page 13. Soles that have beenTried eat good cold with oil, vine- gar, salt, and mustard. Stewed Soles. Do as carp, page 12. Soles another way. Take two or three soles, divide them from the back- bone, and take off the head, fins and tail. Sprinkle the inside with salt, roll them up tight from the tail end upwards, and fasten with small skewers. If large or middling, put half a fish in each roll; small do not an- swer. Dip them into yolks of .eggs, and cover them with crumbs. Do the egg over them again, and then put more crumbs; and fry them a beautiful colour in lard, or for fast-day in clarified butter. Soles in Ike Portuguese way. Take one large or two small; if large, cut the fish in two; if small, they need only be split. The bones be- ing taken out, put the fish into a pan with a bit of but- ter and some lemon juice, give it a fry, then lay the lish on a dish, and spread a forcemeat over each piecÂ«

283 DAIRY, but also in taste. Those who direct a dairy in a gentle- man’s family, should consider in which way it can be managed to the best advantage. Even with few cows, cheeses of value may be made from a tolerable pasture, by taking the whole of two meals of milk, and propor- tioning the thichiess of the vat to the quantity, rather than having a wide and flat one, as the former will be most mellow. The addition of a pound of fresh-made butter, of a good quality, will cause the cheese made on poor land to be of a very different quality from that usually produced by it. A few cheeses thus made, when the weather is not extremely hot, and when the cows are in full feed, will be very advantageous for the use of the parlour. Cheese for common family use will be very well produced by two meals of skim, and one of new milk ; or in good land, by the skim milk only. Butter likewise should be made, and potted down for winter use, but not to in- terfere with cheese as above, which will not take much time. To prepare Rennet to turn the Milk. Take out the stomach of a calf as soon as killed, and scour it inside and out with salt, after it is cleared of the curd alw’ays found in it. Let it drain a few hours; then sew it up with two good handfuls of salt in it, or stretch it on a stick well salted ; or keep it in the salt wet, and soak a bit, which will do over and over by fresh water.

Let them boil gently to three pints of water; strain it off ; and when only milk-warm, pour it on the veil (that is, the maw). Slice a lemon into it; let it stand two days; strain it again, and bottle

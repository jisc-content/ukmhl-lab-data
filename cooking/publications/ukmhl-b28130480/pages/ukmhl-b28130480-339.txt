Soak the fillet for at least two days in olive oil and sait, drain, and simmer in a stew-pan lined with slices of bacon, carrots, onions, a bouquet of mixed herbs, sait, pepper, and equal quantities of stock and white wine ; when sufficiently done, drain the fillet, glaze it, and serve with piquante sauce, to which you hâve added a little of the liquor in which it was cooked, after passing it through a tammy and reducing. Warm three ounces of sugar and a pinch of sait in a large tumblerful of milk; whilst this is cooking, stir three ounces of maizena and three yolks of egg into a wine-glassful of cold milk ; as soon as the sugar and milk boil, add this mixture, stir over the fire for a few minutes, flavour with lemon peel or vanilla, and pour into a mould through a fine sieve ; place in the refrigerator ; when set, turn out of the mould and dish up on a folded napkin. The Americans generally garnish this dish with strawberry or some other kind of fruit syrup. The advantages of this cream are that it is very nice to eat and cheap to préparé. Maizena Bavarian cream.

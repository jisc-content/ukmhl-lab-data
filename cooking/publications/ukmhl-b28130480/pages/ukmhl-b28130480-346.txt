We get two species of this wild bird from the northern forests of Alsace, Lorraine, and principally from the Vosges-; one is as big as a peacock, and the other about the size of a pheasant ; their flesh is dark, and their flavour very strong. If the birds hâve fed on juniper berries they will hâve a most disagreeable taste, and if on certain kinds of pine seeds you can at once detect it, as the smell will cling to your hand if you touch the bird. Préparé the same as pheasants, lard the breasts, and roast. The birds must not be too high. Warm a wine-glassful of milk in a saucepan ; as soon as it boils, stir in two ounces of powdered sugar, three ounces of butter, a pinch of sait, and take off the fire. Stir two ounces of maizena and two yolks of egg into a wine-glassful of cold milk, add to the hot milk, boil for five minutes, stir the whole time, pour into a bowl, whip until cold, and pour into a baked open tart case. Maizena cream tart.

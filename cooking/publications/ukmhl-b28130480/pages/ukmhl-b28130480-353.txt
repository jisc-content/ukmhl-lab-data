A good turbot ought to be thick, and hâve a yellow tinge ; if it looks at ail blue, you may be sure it is not good. Préparé your turbot with care, soak in cold water for two hours, drain, place in a fïsh-pan, and cover it entirely with fine sait ; at the end of an hour, fill the fïsh-pan with boiling water and simmer from twenty to forty minutes, according to the size of your fish ; when done, drain and dish up on a napkin, garnish with parsley and boiled potatoes, and hand both hollandaise and shrimp sauce in sauceboats. Ortolans roasted in a saucepan. Préparé your ortolans the same as for roasting (see 6th of November), place them in a saucepan with a little butter, fix the lid on firmly, and shake over a quick fire ; a few minutes suffice to cook them. Serve very hot.

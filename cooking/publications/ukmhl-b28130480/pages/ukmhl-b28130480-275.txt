Dish up the pork or bacon on the pièces of cabbage, reduce the sauce, stir in a lump of butter, mixed with flour, and pour over the cabbage and bacon. Pluck, singe, and flatten the backs of two or three dozen larks, draw them, throw away the gizzards, and pound the trail in a mortar with scraped bacon and mixed herbs ; fill the larks with this, and wrap each one in a slice of bacon. Line a plain mould with paste, fill it with the larks, sprinkle them with sait and pepper, spread a thick layer of butter over them, add two or three laurel leaves, and a pinch of mixed spice ; cover with paste, and bake for two hours and a half. Turn out of the mould, and serve cold. Simmer five ounces of fresh butter in a saucepan, with two yolks of egg, a little lemon-juice, sait, and coarse black pepper ; stir until the sauce is quite hot, take it off the fire, and stir until it thickens. This sauce must be made just before serving. Lark pie. Portuguese sauce.

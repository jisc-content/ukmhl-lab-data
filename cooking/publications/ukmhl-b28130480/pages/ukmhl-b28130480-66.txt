Champignons farcis. Stuffed mushrooms. Chocolaté créant. Crème au chocolat. Chump of veal with chicory. Make an incision half an inch deep, lengthways and across the skin of the chump ; trim the other side of the veal so as to make it quite smooth and lard it ; place in a stew-pan with some carrots, onions, a bouquet of parsley, and a little stock, simmer until the bottom of the saucepan is coloured, add one pound of méat, moisten with a little water and stock, cook over a slow fixe with hot coals on the cover, or in the oven ; when three- auarters done remove the vegetables and bouquet, which will hâve sufficiently flavoured the méat and would only absorb the gravy. Make a larger fire and moisten the veal with its own juice until it is glazed, which will take about half-an-hour. Take ail the fat off the sauce and pass through a tammy. Make a foundation of purée of chicory or sorrel (see 23rd ot December) on a dish, place the chump on it, and cover with the sauce. Scrape your fish with care, fry, and serve with fried parsley. Fried dabs.

Stewed pheasant. Truss the pheasant for boiling, lard it with fine strips of bacon, sprinkle with sait, pepper, and mixed spice ; be careful to lard even the legs, cover with slices of bacon, and place in a stew-pan lined with bacon ; moisten with equal quantifies of white wine, and stock, and simmer for two hours ; when done, drain the pheasants, remove the slices of bacon, and dish up covered with game sauce. Maizena pancakes. Take three ounces of maizena, half a tumblerful of milk, a dessert-spoonful of olive oil, an egg, and a pinch of sait, stir thoroughly together, and make your pancakes in the usual manner.

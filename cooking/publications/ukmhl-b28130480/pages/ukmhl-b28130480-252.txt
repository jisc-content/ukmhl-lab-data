THE 366 BILES OF FARE. 232 AUGUST 19. Potage de riz aux petits pois. Mulet grillé. Croquettes de volailles. Filet de bœuf rôti sauce madère. Omelette au thon. Marmelade de mirabelles. Rice soup with green peas. Broiled mullet. Chicken croquettes. Roast fillet of beef and Madeira sauce. Tunny omelet. Mirabelle plum marmalade. Tunny omelet. Blanch the soft roe of two carps for five minutes in boiling sait and water ; chop them up with a piece of tunny the size of a large egg, and an eschalot ; toss in a saucepan with a large lump of butter until it has melted, but do not let it boil or it will harden the roe. Melt a second lump of butter, season it with chopped parsley and chives and a little lemon-juice; pour into the dish in which you intend to serve the omelet, and keep it warm in the oven. Beat up twelve fresh eggs, stir in the chopped roe and fish, cook the omelet in the usual man- ner, but make it rather thick, place in the previously prepared dish, and serve very hot. Madeira sauce. Boil two wine-glassesful of Madeira, a quarter of a pound of méat glaze and a little coarse black pepper until reduced to a quarter the original quantity ; brown an ounce of flour in an ounce and a half of butter, add to the sauce ; simmer for ten minutes, skim, pass through a sieve, and serve. Mirabelle plum marmalade. Préparé the same as peach marmalade (see 3rd of October).

Court-bouillon, or white wine sauce This sauce is so useful that it always ought to be at hand in every kitchen, and whenever any is taken out of the bowl in which it is kept, it must be replaced by the sanie quantity of white wine. Fill a fish-pan nearly to the brim with white wine, a wine-glassful of brandy, the same quantity of sherry, and season with sait, peppér, two heads of cloves, a head of garlic, sliced onions, carrots, turnips, parsnips, celery, chervil, parsley, laurel-leaves, thyme, and a lump of lard or fresh butter, if for fast days use olive oil ; boil over a quick fire until reduced a third ; if the wine catches fire, it will greatly improve the flavour of the sauce. When used for cooking fish or crayfish, see that the court-bouillon is boiling before putting them in, and hâve sufficient quantity to cover the fish thoroughly. A cheaper manner of preparing the sauce is by using equal quantities of vinegar and water instead of white wine, and by omitting some of the vegetables. Bone your shoulder, lard the top part of it, and skewer into any shape preferred. Cook the same as fricandeau of veal (see 1 ith of May), reduce the sauce in which it has been braised, and glaze the shoulder with it. Glazed shoulder of lamb.

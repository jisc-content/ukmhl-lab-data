PROVISION CALENDAR. January. Under the first kings of France the year commenced on the ist Of March, but during Charlemagne’s reign it was altered to Christmas-time ; after Hugh Capet it was changed to Easter ; and under Charles IX., the lover of the beautiful Marie Touchet, theanagram of whose name is “Je charme tout,” the ist of January became New Year’s day ; and it was announced ail over Paris with a flourish of trumpets that for the future the 3ist of December would close the year. This was a very good decision, for January is worthy of being the first month of the year; the winter season blessed by ail gourmands now commences. I hâve before my eyes an engraving of the sixteenth century, where the twelve months of the year are represented by as many figures. January is personified by a man at table ; he is eating hke Gargantua, and drinking like Bassompierre, who used to drink a large butt of wine at one draught to the health of the thirteen Swiss cantons ; not like St. Macaire of Alexandria, whose saint s day is the 2nd of January, for he only used to eat one leaf of raw cabbage every Sunday ; but much more like Chailemagne. January is without doubt the great month for eating. Provisions in season during January. Ail butcher’s méat is good, and fattened poultry are in their prime. Added to the usual game, we hâve woodcock, larks, geese, and wild duck. The Mediterranean provides us with fresh tunny, and ail other fish are in perfection. Truffles hâve more perfume than at any other time of the year. lhe fiist forced asparagus cornes into the markets.

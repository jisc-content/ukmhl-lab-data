Soup à la Saint-Germain. Soles boiled in white wine. Sirloin of beef à la provençale. Roast pigeons. \ oung broad beans with cream. Elder-flower fritters. Sirloin of beef à la Provençale. This is an excellent old recipe, which I am sorry to say is seldom used. Lard the sirloin with fillets of ham \ chop up some marrow, scraped bacon, anchovies, rnixed herbs, and garlic ; stir well into butter, olive oil, sait and pepper ; spread this stuffing on to slices of bacon, lay them on the beef, skewer or tie them on, cover with buttered sheets of paper, and roast ; when nearly done, remove the paper and bacon so as to brown the méat. Add a little of the gravy cleared of ail grease, to some piquante sauce, and hand in a sauceboat ; squeeze a few drops of lemon over it just before serving. Elder-flower fritters. Break up some elder-flowers into small sprigs, and soak for two hours in either sherry or brandy, with a little sugar ; drain, dip into batter, to which you hâve added a little brandy and a few drops of orange-flower water ; fry until a golden colour, and dish up in a pyramid. Roast shovellers. This bird, which is a species of wild duck with red-webbed feet, is only found up rivers. Roast the same as wild duck. N 2

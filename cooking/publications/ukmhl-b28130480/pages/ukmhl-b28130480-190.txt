Make a stuffing with sausage- meat and very thin tomato sauce, fill the tomatoes with this, sprinkle with grated bread-crust, and bake. Serve as soon as the stuffing is browned. Burnt cream. Warm four fine yolks of egg and a pinch of flour, stir well and add a pint of milk gradually, flavour with cinnamon and dried lemon peel ; if required to be very nice, flavour with pounded pistachio nuts, almonds, or macaroons, and a little orange-flower water. Continue stirring until cooked, be care- ful the cream does not burn. Put a silver or tin dish in the oven, sprinkle the bottom of it with powdered sugar, moisten with a little water, and when the sugar is browned, add the cream, and serve immediately.

Put a large piece of fresh butter in a saucepan, with some leeks, sorrel, chervil, and lettuce leaves, a bouquet of mixed herbs, sait and pepper ; when sufficiently done, add the re- quired quantity of water, boil well, and thicken with yolks of egg and créant. Clean out your fish, save the livers and replace them in the mullet with some well salted butter, pepper, and finely chopped parsley. Wrap each mullet in an oiled sheet of paper, sprinkle over with olive oil, chopped parsley, pepper, sait, and a little garlic, place them on the gridiron with red-hot coals under- neath and hold a salamander over them, this prevents your having to turn the fish. When cooked, squeeze the juice of a lemon over the mullet. Some cooks do not clean out their red mullet. Thoroughly clean and scale your pike, and sew up its head.

Next day, before serving, drain off ail the liquid, and garnish with parsley. Hand oil and vinegar with this dish. Red mullet in cases. Pickled pike.

THE 366 BILLS OF FARE. 24 JANUARY 24. Potage bisque d’écrevisses. Crayfish soup. Stewed calf’s head. Chicken fritters. Roast haunch of boar. Soufflé of apples. Blanc mange of maizena, flavoured with tea. Tête de veau nature. Marinade de volaille. Cuissot de sanglier rôti. Pommes sautées. Bavarois au thé. Stewed calf’s head. Bone the calf’s head, keep the brains separate and drain them for an hour, then boil them with some water and lemon juice and leave them in their water. Scald the calfs head, eut out the tongue and put it to cool. Cut the head into four pièces, and place in a stew-pan large enough for it only to fill it two- thirds ; in another saucepan put two ounces of thyrne, one ounce laurel leaves, three and a half ounces onion, one ounce carrot, two ounces flour, two quarts of water, sait, whole black pepper, and two wine-glasses of vinegar ; when this boils pour it over the calfs head, and place it on the tire, adding the tongue. After boiling for two hours and a half, place the two pièces with the ears at one end of a dish and the two other pièces opposite, split the tongue, lay in the centre of the dish, put the brains on it, and garnish with parsley. I consider this the best manner of cooking calfs head. Fry some slices of bread-crumb or brioche (see 24th ofDecem- ber) about a quarter of an inch thick and three inches in diameter, in some very fresh melted butter, until of a golden colour, be careful to keep the bread soft. Spread whatever jam or compote you prefer on each slice and place round a dish, fill the centre with a syrup, made with the same kind of preserve, melted in equal quantities of sherry and water, pour in when hot, and place the dish in the oven for a few minutes.

Braised leg of mutton. Roast pigeons. Fried potatoes à la Macaire. Almond cake. Fried potatoes à la Macaire. The following amusing anecdote will explain the origin of this dish. Louis Philippe and his family were breakfasting at the Tuileries one morning, and the Prince de Joinville was so absorbed giving an account of one of his voyages, that he refused a splendid dish of fried potatoes which was handed to him ; but his narrative finished, he turned round and asked for potatoes, but such justice had been done to the dish that not a crumb was left ; a footman ran to the kitchen for more, but there were none ready ; there was no time for hésitation ; the audacious chef threw the trimmings of the potatoes served at the royal table into a frying-pan with a large lump of butter, tossed the misshapen pièces until a golden colour, pleasing to the eye, and further adorned by a dash of finely-chopped parsley; the prince found the potatoes so good that he in- quired the name of the dish ; no one knows what answer he received, as being very deaf he repeated, “ Ah, fried potatoes à la Macaire; I find them excellent and hope they will often be served.” The king and princes laughed so heartily that the tears rolled down their cheeks ; but the deed had been done, and potato trimmings cooked in a frying-pan had received their baptism.

You can always tell if a melon has ripened on the plant, or if it has been ripened artificially, by examining the stalk, as if the latter, it will be quite shrivelled. If the melon is heavy it proves it is not spongy ; if the skin smells strong it in- dicates a well-flavoured melon ; and if on pressing the little round opposite the stalk you find it not quite hard you may feel sure that the fruit is ripe. Some good housewives bite the stalks of the melons before buying them, as they say that the more bitter the stalk the sweeter the melon. Melons are generally served after the soup. Some people eat sugar with their melon, which is a great mistake, as it makes it more difficult to digest ; sait and pepper, on the contrary, help the digestion immensely. Boil three ox palates in water ; trim, scrape, skin, and eut them into quarters; simmer for half an hour in stock; season with a head of garlic, two heads of cloves, thyrne, laurel leaves, sait and pepper ; drain, and leave until cold. Lay a small teaspoonful of beef forcemeat on each piece, roll up into the shape of a cork, dip into very thin paste, made with a table- spoonful of olive oil, a little flour, a tumblerful of white wine, and a pinch of sait, it rnust be almost liquid ; fry in boiling lard or butter, and serve very hot, garnished with fried parsley.

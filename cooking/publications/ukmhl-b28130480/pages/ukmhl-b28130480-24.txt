Baked whiting with sweet herbs. Clean the whiting and lay in a baking dish which has been previously buttered and sprinkled with chopped parsley, onion, a little sait, and scraped nutmeg. After placing the whiting in the dish, pour a little fresh melted butter over them, and moisten with equal quantifies of white wine and stock. Put the dish in the oven, and when the whiting are half cooked, turn them carefully ; when sufficiently done, turn their juice into a saucepan, being careful not to disturb the whiting, add some melted butter and flour to the sauce and boil, add a few drops of lemon juice when ready and a pinch of white pepper. Pour the hot sauce over the whiting, and serve in the same dish in which they hâve been cooked. Koast fillet of beef.

PREFACE. This book, which was already one of the most useful and practical of cookery books, has been rendered more complété in'this édition by many alterations and modifications. The bills of fare are written entirely according to our French customs. Dishes used by both rich and poor are given in their proper seasons. The recipes hâve corne from many different schools of cookery, and are clearly and concisely explained. In this édition, as in my previous ones, I hâve not attempted to give recipes for using up scraps, as this art is only useful when you run short of provisions ; it is quite a mistake to imagine that warming up previously cooked méat is economical, as ail good transformations must be expensive. The only way to use up scraps of méat is to warm them in any of the simple sauces, recipes for which will be found further on. Scraps of fowl or game must not corne under this category, as ail salmis and marinades hâve to be made from fowls or game which hâve been previously roasted. Entrées of game or fowl must always be warmed up, in the same sauce, if required to be used on the second day. In cookery, above ail things, “ Nothing can corne ol nothing.” The Author.

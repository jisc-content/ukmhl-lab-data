Spiced sait. The great cook, Durand, of illustrious memory, advocated the use of spiced sait, which he said had often stood him in good stead. The following are the exact quantities he gave in his recipe. Take twenty ounces of sait, four heads of cloves, two nut- megs, six laurel leaves, a stick of cinnamon, four whole black peppers, half a quarter of an ounce of basil leaves, and the same quantity of coriander seeds \ pound in a mortar, pass through a tammy, pound any large pièces that remain over, pass through the tammy, and keep in tightly corked bottles. s

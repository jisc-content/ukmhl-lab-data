Brown tbickening. Brown thickening is the foundation of nearly ail brown sauces. Place a lump of butter, well mixed with fine flour, in a saucepan, stir over a quick fire, until a good brown colour, moisten with stock ; stir the whole time, and as soon as ît boils take off the fire. Some brown thickenings hâve an acid taste, which is caused by the butter being browned over too quick a fire, which can be avoided by taking the saucepan oft the fire as soon as the butter melts, and placmg ît under the fire, so that hot cinders may fall on the lid; stir occasionally, and when brown, moisten with stock as above.

Roast plieasant à la Brillat-Savarin. Brillat-Savarin gave the following orders for cooking a pheasant:—Hang until tender, pluck, draw, and lard it carefully. Bone and draw two woodcock—keep the trail separate, throw away the gizzards, chop up the méat with beef marrow which h as been cooked by steam, scraped bacon, pepper, sait, mixed herbs, and truffles ; fill the pheasant with this stuffing, which is rather difficult to keep in if the bird is at ail high, in which case fix it in with a piece of bread the shape of a cork, and tie it round with fine thread. Lay a thick slice of bread two or three inches broader than the pheasant in the drippmg-pan ; pound the trail of the woodcock in a mortar with truffles, an anchovy, a little scraped bacon, and a lump of fresh butter, spread a thick layer on the bread, roast the pheasant over it so as to catch ail the dripping, and dish up on it. Simple mortals roast their pheasants in the same manner as partndges, and hang them until they are so high that they are hardly eatable.

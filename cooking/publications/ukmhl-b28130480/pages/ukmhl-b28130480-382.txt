THE 366 BILLS O F FA RE. 3Ô2 DECEMBER 27. Potage Baraquine. Bouchées aux huîtres. Turbot sauce crevettes. Filet de bœuf rôti garni d’un ragoût financière. Paon rôti ou en daube. Croûte aux champignons. Bavarois glacé. Baraquine Soup. Oyster patties. Turbot, shrimp sauce. Roast fillet of beef garnished à la financière. Cold roast or braised peacock. Mushrooms on toast. Iced Bavaiian cream. Cold roast or braised peacock. Do not pluck your peacock, but skin it carefully, so as not to disturb the feathers, take care not to spoiî the head and neck, lard the breasts with fine strips of bacon, and roast ; when done, leave until cold, after which, place the feathers on the bird in their original position, raise the head and neck with a piece of wire, spread out the tail in a fan shape, and serve. As a peacock dressed with its feathers must be served cold, it is nicer braised than roasted, as the stuffing seasons it more highly ; in this case préparé it the same as cold braised goose (see 2 7th of February). This dish is a magnificent ornament on a dinner or supper table. Sauce à la financière. Boil three or four tablespoonsful of minced raw ham, sorae trufïïe trimmings, mushrooms, a bouquet of mixed herbs, and three whole black peppers in equal quantities of stock and white wine, reduce to half the original quantity, clear off ail grease, and pass through a tammy. Stir some stock into a little brown thickening in a separate saucepan, reduce, add the previously made sauce, and serve. Grarnish. à la financière. Cook some foie gras, cockscombs, and livers, chicken quenelles, mushrooms, and truffies in financière sauce, and use as a garnish.

During dinner extra wines hâve spécial glasses handed with them. Finger-glasses with warm water must be handed after crayfish or prawns. The dessert plates must always hâve a doiley and a finger- glass placed on them. There are two different ways of serving dinner,—the French and the Russian. The French dinner is divided into three courses, theffrst com- prises soup, small side dishes, fish, and entrées ; the second, roasts, vegetables, and sweets ; the third, dessert, each course being ail placed on the table at the saroe time. The Russian fashion is to place ail cold dishes on the table. The hot dishes are carved in the kitchen and handed one by one to the guests. Each of these arrangements lias its advan- tages and disadvantages. In the French fashion your dishes often get cold before you can eat them, and in the Russian the guests are deprived of seeing élégant dishes prettily placed on the table. However, it lies entirely in the hands of the host to choose between these two fashions, according to the capabilities of his household. Order in which to serve Dinner. Soups. Small side dishes, viz.

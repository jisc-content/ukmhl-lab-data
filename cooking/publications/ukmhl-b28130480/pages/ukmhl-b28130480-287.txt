267 THE 366 B/LLS OF FARE. SEPTEMBER 23. Potage Faubonne. Moules au gras. Perdreaux en escalopes. Rosbif rôti. Pommes de terre sautées. Gâteau mille feuilles. Faubonne soup. Stewed mussels. Scalloped partridges, Roast beef. Fried potatoes. Light pastry. Stewed mussels. Wash your mussels carefully, but do not leave in the water, or they lose much of their flavour ; warm them in a saucepan ; as soon as they open, take out the mussels, and reserve their liquor. Warm some button mushrooms in melted bacon, stir in a little flour, moisten with reduced stock, season with a bouquet of mixed herbs and pepper ; when done, clear off ail grease, add the mussels and a little of their liquor, and serve when quite hot. Scallop the fillets of four partridges, toss them in a saucepan with some butter until firm ; drain the scallops, remove the butter, and replace it by three tablespoonsful of game stock and two tablespoonsful of German sauce ; when boiling, add the scallops, and either sliced truffles or peeled mushrooms, a little fresh butter, and the juice of a lemon. Dish up the scallops in a circle, and fill the centre with the sauce. Take an anchovy, a tumblerful of red wine, a little gravy, a chopped eschalot, and the juice of a lemon ; simmer until cooked, pass through a tammy, and add to the gravy of your roast. Scalloped partridges. Sauce for ail roasts.

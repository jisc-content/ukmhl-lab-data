Clean out your cod, fill it with coarse sait, rub the sides and sprinkle them with fine sait, and leave in a cool place for three or four hours. Two hours before cooking it, wash the cod, make several slits down the back, tie a string round the head, and soak in milk and water. Boil in boiling sait and water, add two pints of boiling milk, and leave on the fire for three-quarters of an hour, if a very large fish it will take a little longer to cook. When done dish up on a napkin, garnished with boiled potatoes and fresh parsley. Melt some fresh butter in a bain-marie, season with sait, pepper, a pinch of mixed spice, and the juice of a lemon \ hand in a sauceboat with the cod.

Stuff a young chicken with a handful of coarsely-cho-pped parsley mixed with butter, sait and pepper ; roast it, without covering with slices of bacon, and dish up with its own gravy. It generally takes about twenty-five minutes to cook a young chicken in this manner. The stuffing is a great improvement, as young poultry often tastes of the food with which it has been fattened. Take twelve eggs, whip the whites of six of them, stir into a little flour, hot melted butter, sait and pepper, and pass through a fine sieve. Line the bottorn of a tin or plated dish with slices of Gruyère cheese, and thin slices of bread, spread with plenty of butter, pour the eggs over them, and bake \ brown with a salamander before serving. Boil your potatoes in sait and water ; when done, peel and slice them as quick as possible, cover with white sauce made with potato flour, and serve very hot. Baked eggs and cheese. Potatoes with white sauce.

THE 366 BILLS OF FARE. 298 OCTOBER 24. Potage à la purée d’oseille. Aloyau braisé. Barbillons frits. Coq de bruyère rôti. Champignons au gratin. Purée of sorrel. Braised sirloin of beef. Fried barbel. Roast black-cock. Baked mushrooms and bread- crumbs. Apple Charlotte. Charlotte de pommes. Roast black-cock. Choose some tender young birds, lard them with fine fillets of bacon, and roast. Serve, garnished with slices of lemon, and hand strong gravy in a sauceboat. Peel a dozen fine russet apples, scoop out the cores, eut them up into small pièces, and stew in a preserving-pan with plenty of sugar, a little water, strips of lemon peel, and a small piece of cinnamon ; cook over a quick fire, stir occa- sionally, add a lump of very fresh butter, and remove the lemon peel and cinnamon as soon as the apples are done. Line a mould with slices of bread-crumb, which hâve been dipped into melted butter ; let each piece overlap the other, fill the centre with the stewed apples, and if fancied, add a little apricot, cherry, or gooseberry jam, cover with a round slice of bread-crumb, also moistened in melted butter; place the mould in a saucepan until warm—be careful the bread does not burn—after which, bake in the oven, when a pretty golden colour, turn out of the mould, and serve very hot. Apple Charlotte.

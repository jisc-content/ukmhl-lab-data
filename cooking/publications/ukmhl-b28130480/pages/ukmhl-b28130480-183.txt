Hâve a foie gras weighing about a pound and a half. Make some forcemeat with one pound of turkey breast, one pound of fresh pork, mix'ed herbs, laurel leaves, thyme, sait, pepper, and two heads of cloves, and pound well. Peel one pound of truffles carefully, and stick some large pièces into the foie gras. Line the bottorn of a deep dish with some of the stuffing, lay the foie gras on this, surround it with the remainder of the truffles, fill up ail interstices with the stuffing, and cover the whole with slices of bacon and laurel leaves. Cook the pie in a bain-marie over a slow fire, keep the water at boiling point but be careful none gets into the pie. It generally takes *. about an hour and a half to cook a pie of this size. Stick a skewer into the centre, and if burning hot when taken out you will know that the pie is done. When cold, remove the slices of bacon and cover with a layer of lard. Some people prefer the pie baked in the oven, as they consider it has more flavour. If the pie is to be eaten immediately, calfs liver forcemeat (see next page) may be used, instead of turkey and pork. M 2

When done, serve on stewed mushrooms (see 27th ofNovember). Asparagus with white sauce. Scrape and wash some fine heads of asparagus, tie them up into small bundles, cook in boiling sait and water, take off the fire before the asparagus becomes too soft, serve with white sauce, handed separately. Rice soufflé. Boil seven ounces of rice flour in a pint of milk with a little sugar and some pounded maccaroons, stir until it becomes a thick smooth paste, flavour with vanilla or lemon, add four or five yolks of egg, whip up the whites of the eggs and stir them in, pour into a souffle' dish, sprinkle with powdered sugar, and bake in a moderate oven. A potato souffle' is pre- pared in the same manner, only potato flour is used instead of rice.

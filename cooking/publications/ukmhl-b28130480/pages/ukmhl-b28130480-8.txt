TRANSLATONS NOTE. The first object I had in translating this work, was to please my cook ; but having been asked by many of ray friends to give them the recipes (in English) for some of the celebrated Baron’s excellent dishes, I determined to allow my poor translation to appear in print. May I, under these circumstances, ask the forgiveness of ail English cooks, if I venture to give them a few hints hovv best to carry out the views of one of the greatest of French chefs ? Soi/ps.—The reader will at once see that no colouring is ever used in French soups. Fish.—There are many kinds of fish mentioned, which you rarely see named in the fishmongers’ bills of fare, but they can be procured at any good fishmonger’s if asked for, such as Garfish, Weaver, or Whiting Pollock. Crayfish in excellent condition can always be procured at Schelbs, in Wigmore Street. Beef—Whenever boiled beef is mentioned, it means fresh, not sait méat. Vegetables.—Celery roots and cardoons, both most delicious vegetables, are seldom seen at English dinner-tables, but they hâve been for sale at Martin’s, in Covent Garden, for several years past. . „ , , Cooking wine.—Chablis is the white wine generally used for cooking in France ; so in the recipes, I hope it will always be used, unless Madeira or Sherry is specially mentioned. Bills of fare for fast days.—There are so many good dishes for our fast days given in this book, that I hope ail Catholic families will try them, and perhaps pass happier Fndays than hitherto.

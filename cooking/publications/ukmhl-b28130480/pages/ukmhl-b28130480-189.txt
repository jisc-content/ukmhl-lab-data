THE 366 BILES O F FARE. 169 JUNE 17. Potage à l’oseille, chiffonnade de cerfeuil. Petits pâtés aux écrevisses. Chou farci. Poularde rôtie. Épinards au jus. Meringues à la crème. Sorrel soup with chopped chervil. Crayfish patties. Stuffed cabbage. Roast fowl. Stewed spinach. Meringues with cream. Crayfish patties. Make two pints of brioche paste (see 24Ü1 of December), but use only a quarter of a pound of butter, equal quantities of egg and water, and some German yeast ; when the paste has risen to double its original size, put it in a cool place or on ice until quite firm. Roll it out very thin, and eut it into twenty-four small rounds about three inches in diameter, sprinkle a board with water, and lay the paste on it, place a small quenelle of fish on twelve of the rounds and two shelled crayfish ; cover with the remaining twelve pièces of paste, press together with a small round tin cutter, egg over, and bake. Serve very hot. These can be fried in boiling lard or butter, if there is no oven. Stewed spinach. Warm the spinach in fresh butter, season with sait, black pepper, and a pinch of grated nutmeg, moisten with either veal stock or the dripping from a fricandeau of veal which has been reduced ; when done, stir in a little butter, and serve, garnished with fried sippets of bread.

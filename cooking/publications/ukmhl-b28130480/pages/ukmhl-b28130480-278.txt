This soup is of Gascon origin, and must alvvays be browned in the oven before serving. Cut up your cabbages into quarters, blanch, and dry them carefully in a cloth, tie a string round each piece, and place in a stew-pan, lined with slices of bacon ; add a piece of sait pork, slices of ham, a knuckle of veal, onions, carrots, and a bouquet of mixed herbs, moisten with stock, and simmer over a slow fire when done, add some thick slices of bread-crumb, and as soon as they begin to thicken the soup, re- rnove the pièces of cabbage, place them on a cloth, cut off the string, and sqeeze them. Grate equal quantities of Gruyere and Parmesan cheese, and sprinkle some at the bottom of an earthenware pot or soup-tureen, fill it with alternate layers of cabbage and the soaked slices of bread-crumb, sprinkling each one with grated cheese—be careful that the last layer is of cabbage—cover it thickly with cheese, and brown in the oven or with a salamander.

Lobsters à la Bordelaise. Cut up each lobster into eight pièces, break the claws with- out spoiling their shape, and boil for twenty-five minutes in white wine, seasoned with a head of garlic, laurel leaves, thyme, parsley, sait and pepper ; place the cover on the sauccpan, and stir occasionally to prevent the sauce burning ; when done, dry each pièce in a cloth, and lay in a clean saucepan. Brou n some sliced onions and eschalots in butter, stir in a little flour, and when quite thick moisten with some of the liquor in which the lobsters were boiled, stir over a quick fire for ten minutes, add two wine-glasses full of tomato sauce, and a pinch of cayenne, as this dish must be highly flavoured; pour the sauce over the lobsters, and warm for a few minutes ; dish up the pièces so arranged as to give the appearance of the lobsters not having been cut, garnish with the claws, cover with the sauce, and serve.

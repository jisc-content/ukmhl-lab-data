Fruits should be bottled on the same day that they are gathered, or they will be apt to ferment. SUGAR BOILING. TO CLARIFY SUGAR. Put the w’hite of an egg into a preserving pan, with a quart of water, beat it up to a froth with a whisk, add, six pounds of loaf sugar, mix them all well toge- ther, and set it over a very slow fire, so that it gradu- ally comes to a boil.

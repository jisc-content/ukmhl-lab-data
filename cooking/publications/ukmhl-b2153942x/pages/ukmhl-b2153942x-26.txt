CONFECTIONARl 28 FANCY PASTRY FOR FILLING BASKETS. Roll out pulF paste thin, cut them out and form them as the last, only much smaller, and without put- ting any jam between, or make them in any other form, with tin cutters; }>lace them on a clean tin, and bake them in a moderate oven, put some jam or jelly on the top of each, and arrange them tastefully in a sugar or other basket, or in a dish on a folded napkin. The whole of the small pastry and tartlets are for this purpose, and some of each should be used to make a variety, filling them with different sorts of marmalades and jams, so as there may not be a sameness. SHORT PASTE, OR TART PASTE. One pound of flour, eight ounces of butter. Rub the butter and flour together with your hands, till the but- ter is crumbled into pieces, mix it into a moderate stiff paste with cold water, and continue rubbing it with your hand on the board or slab until you have a smooth and supple piece of paste, having no degree of tough- ness, and shines on the surface. This paste will take considerably less water to mix it in summer than in winter. This is used for making raspberry tarts, and all co- vered tarts, and occasionally for large fruit and other pies. RASPBERRY TARTS. Make a long roll of tart paste, cut it off in small pieces, and roll them out in an oval form, about a quar- ter or the eighth of an inch in thickness, and let them be large enough to cover your pans; lay them in, and press the paste a little in the centre, with your thumb. Trim it off close to the edges, with the edge or back of a thin knife; notch them round. Thin some raspberry jam with a little water; fill the tarts about three parts full with it, and bake them in a quick oven.

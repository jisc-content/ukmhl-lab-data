MADE EASY. G1 seeds, and if agreeable, a few allspice. Place it over the fire and stir it occasionally, but stir it well when it is on the point of boiling, to prevent the eggs from curdling, or the jelly will not be bright. Boil it for four or five minutes, pour it gently into a jelly-bag, which you must hang at a moderate distance from the fire, so that the jelly will not get cold and set; let it strain through into a basin, and if it does not run clear, strain it over again. Perhaps it will not at first run clear for a few minutes, and then on a sudden, run quite bright; put another basin underneath, remove the thick, and pour it again into the bag. When it is clear, pour it into your moulds, and put them in a cool place. When set, just dip the moulds in warm water, and the jelly will turn out easily. PUNCH JELLY. Make the same as calf s foot jelly, flavouring it with rum, or a little brandy, instead of wine. ORANGE JELLY. Dissolve an ounce of isinglass in just enough water to cover it. Get some China oranges. Eub ofif the yellow rind of four peels on sugar, and scrape the sugar into the isinglass; a small piece of cinnamon may be added. Let it simmer over a slow fire, stirring it fre- quently. Squeeze and strain the juice of your oranges till you have a pint and a third, with the juice of a small lemon, and mix these together with enough clari- fied sugar to sweeten it. Add it to your isinglass, and when it boils, it is done. Strain it through a fine lawn or tamis sieve, and put it into moulds: what you may have left will do to &1 some glasses, when it is cold. ' LEMON JELLY. Dissolve an ounce of isinglass as directed for Orange Jelly, but without any cinnamon, and using lemon peel instead of orange peel. Strain a pint of lemon juice,

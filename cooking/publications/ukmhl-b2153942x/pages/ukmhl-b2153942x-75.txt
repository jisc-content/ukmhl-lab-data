77 MADB EASY. the colour in powder^ and mixing it in part of the sugar when boiled; when the sugar you have poured on the marble slab, is cool, colour it all over with this mixture, fold it over, cut into lengths, and twist them. This practice, is, however, not very ornamental, and is so unwholesome, that it ought not to be used. COMMON TWIST. Boil two pounds of moist sugar over a clear fire, in a preserving pan, with half a pint of water; it should boil to the crackled degree, (see Sugar Boiling); then pour it on the slab, drop a few drops of the oil of pep- permint upon it; fold it over, pull it, cut it into lengths, and make it up as directed for Paradise Twist. TO PULL TWIST, BULLs’ EYES, &C. Fix a staple in the wall, and rub a little butter over it; put your sugar on the staple, and pull it towards you; continue doing so till it is perfectly white. BEST bulls’ eyes. Boil a quart of clarified sugar in a pan over a clear fire, till of the degree of crackled, (see Sugar Boiling) try it as directed for Barley sugar; when nearly boiled enough, put in half a tablespoonfui of lemon-juice; let it boil again, try it as before, and when it will snap, it is done. Pour it out upon a slightly oiled marble slab, and put twelve or fourteen drops of either essence of lemon or oil of peppermint on your sugar, take the sides of your sugar as it cools, and fold them into the mid- dle. When cool, cut them the size and shape you want. The more expedition you use in cutting them the bet- ter, as the sugar will soon get hard and brittle. Some use an iron stamp to cat them to tlie size and form they want them. You may colour the whole, or part of it with hay saffron, cochineal, orchil, or rose pink, dissolved in spi- rits of wine.

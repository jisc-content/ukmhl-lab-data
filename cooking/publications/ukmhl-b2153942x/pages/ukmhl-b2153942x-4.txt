CONFECTIONARY 6 again immersed in the iced water, until you are ready to use it, when it should be pressed in a clean cloth or napkin. If ice cannot be easily procured, the following mix- ture may be used with advantage: one ounce of chrys- talised muriate of ammonia, one ounce of nitrate of potass, and two ounces of sulphate of soda: powder each separately, and throw them into just sufficient cold spring water for the butter to float freely. AVheii you take the butter out for using, wash it well in cold spring water. If these powders are put into a half pint of water, and a phial bottle containing cold water be immersed in it, ice will be produced, although it is the hottest day in summer. The water in the phial must be below that of the mixture. Confectioners, in hot weather, generally steep their butter in cold spring water, for the night before using, and place it in the coldest part that can be found about the premises. Others add to the water a little car- bonate of ammonia, (volatile salt,) and common salt, of about two ounces to a large pan of water; but this is not a good plan, as I have seen butter spoiled by it, especially if it is not very good. Pure sal am- moniac should be used instead, with cold boiled water. The Egyptians used to put water, which was previously boiled, into earthen jars, and expose them all night on the upper part of their houses to the air to cool, which they removed before sunrise, and buried in the ground. 13y a similar method, water is converted into ice, in the East Indies. The extreme coldness of the night air in these hot countries thus enables the inhabitants to cool water for many domestic purposes. PUFF PASTE.

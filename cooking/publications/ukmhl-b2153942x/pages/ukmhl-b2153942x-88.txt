CONFECTIONARY DO Now put into a clean pan a peck of flour, and having made a hollow in the middle of it, pour in the yeast and water which yoa have just mixed up : then sprinkle a handful of flour lightly over the top. Cover the pan over with a thick cloth, and put it in a warm place to rise, which it will do in about half an hour. When the ferment has risen up, and you see the flour which you sprinkled on the top is cracking, you must put in two quarts more water, just luke-warm, in which you have dissolved half-a-pound of salt, and mix up with it the whole of the flour and the ferment, just as you would make dough for a pudding. Keep working it, and scrape with a spoon all the flour and scraps from the edges of the pan, which mix up with the other dough, until you have a soft smooth dough, about the substance you would use for a pie crust. Then sprinkle a little flour on a clean board or table, on which put all the dough out of the pan ; and having rolled it out and doubled it over, seve- ral times, divide it into as many pieces as you wdsh to make loaves; roll each piece out several times with vour hands, doubling it, and rolling it out again, occasionally sprinkling the table or board slightly with flour, until it feels solid and compact; then break the piece into two parts, one part rather larger than the other, make them both round, and put the smaller piece on top of the larger piece, and press your thumb through the middle of the top to the bottom, to unite them. If you choose, you may slightly notch the edpes with a knife, which will open slightly in the baking, and produce a crusty notched cottage loaf. Should you prefer to make brick loaves, you must, after you have rolled and doubled the dough, as directed for cottage loaves, separate each piece into two parts, one larger than the other, and mould them into a long form, ])utting the smaller piece on to the top of the larger piece, and press your thumb through the top to the bottom, to unite them. If you desire to bake your loaves in tins, you must

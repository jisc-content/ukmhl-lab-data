For this purpose provide some pewter ice pots, put the cream which you intend to freeze in them, and put on the cover with a piece of folded paper at the edge to keep it firm, then place the pot in a pail, and surround it with pounded ice, mixed with salt, keep turning it round briskly by means of the handle, open the pot every five or six minutes, and scrape down the creams which has frozen to the sides, and stir it well together, when it, is like butter, put it into moulds, and place them in fresh ice and salt, or serve it in glasses. Fruit ices may also be made with water instead of cream, by using about two pounds of fresh fruit and a pint of syrup, to a pint of wa- ter, or one pound of preserved fruit, to a pint of water. Chocolate, coffee,* ginger, vanilla, noyeau, and other licquer ices, are made with custard, fiavoured with either of those articles, and frozen as the others, when cold. For the particulars of each sort of ice, and a more detailed account of the method of freezing them, see the Guide to Trade, the Confectioner C. Knight & Co. Ludgate Street, in which will be found Receipts for above sixty different sorts of ices, including ice pudding, and Punch a la Romaine, â€¢ Ice or other coifee creams should be made from fresh coffee, when it has a finer, and more beautiful flavour.

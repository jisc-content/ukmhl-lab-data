CONFECTIONARY 80 fits, but coloured sugar will answer all the purpose of nonpariels. TO COLOUR LOAF SUGAR DUST. Sift as much powdered loaf sugar as you intend to use, and put it into an earthenware pan; make it warm by placing it over a slow clear fire, at a short distance from it; mix it about in the pan with your hand, and be careful that it does not burn; then put some of one of the colours to it, (see Colourings for Confectionary) mixed with water to the consistence of cream, and mix it together; continue mixing and stirring it about with your hand till it is quite dry; then put it on paper to cool. Sift it when it is cold, and put it in jars or canisters. You must use your own judgment as to how much colour to use; but as a general rule use as little as possible, for most of the colours are unwholesome, and some of them are highly injurious. COLOURINCS FOR CONFECTIONARY. In giving the various sorts of colourings used in con- fectionary, the use of any thing pernicious is not re- commended, although it may be mentioned in some of the recipes; it is merely given to show that such things are used: and that such coloured articles, however ele- gant they look, cannot be produced without them. However, in general, the quantity of any of the delete- rious colours necessary to tie used is so small, that very lif tie injury can arise from their use, if care be take n not to put m more than is just sufficient.

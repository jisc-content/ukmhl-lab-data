MADE EASY. 87 PINK COLOUR. You may make a pink colour with either archil, lake, Dutch pink, or rose pink. Take as much of either of them as will be enough for your purpose, and moisten it with spirits of wine; grind it on a marble slab, til! quite line, and add spirits of wine, or gin, till it is of the thickness of cream. RED COLOUR. Red colour is made with cochineal, grind half an ounce of cochineal line enough to go through a wire sieve, put into a two-quart copper pan, half an ounce of salts of wormwood, and half a pint of cold spring water; put the cochineal into it, and put it over a clear fire; let them boil together for about a minute; mix in three quarters of an ounce of cream of tartar, and let it boil again; as soon as it boils, take it off, and put in of powdered roche-alum rather less than half a tea- spoonful; stir it well together, and strain into a bottle; put in a lump of sugar, to keep it; cork it up, and put it by for use. SCARLET COLOUR. Vermillion, ground with a little gin or lemon juice, and then mixed with water, makes a bright scarlet; but in using it be careful not to take too much, for iv is highly pernicious. CHERRY RED. Boil an ounce of cudbear in three half pints of water over a slow fire, till reduced to a pint, then add an ounce of cream of tartar, and let them simmer again. When cold, strain them, add an ounce and a half of spirits of wine to it, and bottle for use; this is rendered red when mixed with acid, and green with alkali; it is not a good colour, and Dutch grappe mad- der may be substituted for it: take two ounces, tie it in

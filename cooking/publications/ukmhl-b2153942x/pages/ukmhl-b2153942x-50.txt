CuNFECTIONAKY A. cabinet pudding is also occasionally made with stale sponge or savoy cakes, or some of either of these ami French roll mixed together. A LEMON PUDDING. Put eight penny sponge cakes broken in pieces, into a basin, and break in three ounces of butter, with the peel of four lemons, grated. JBoil a pint and a third of a pint of milk, and pour it on the cake; let it soak w'hile you break three eggs and the yolks of five more, into a basin, and whisk them together a little. Now beat up the milk and cake with a fork, till smooth, add your eggs, the juice of one lemon and the third of another, with sugar enough to sweeten it to your palate, and an ounce and a quarter of candied lemon peel in slices; mix all well together, put it into a dish, and bake it in a warm oven till it is set. A MARROW PUDDING, Chop half the marrow of a beef bone, take out the largest of the pieces, and then chop up the rest very small. Put it into a basin, and mix it into a quarter of a pound of stale diet bread cake, or, if you have it, savoy cake; boil a pint of milk, ]iour it upon the cake, and set it by to soak. Break three eggs into a basin, and whisk them to a froth. By this time the cake will be soaked; beat it quite smooth, give the eggs another slight whisk, and pour them into the cake; add a few currants, some candied orange and lemon peel cut in pieces, about a quarter of a nutmeg, half the peel of a lemon grated, and sugar sufficient to sweeten it. Put it into your dish, lay the pieces of marrow that you have saved out, on the top, with a few currants, and citron or lemon peel cut in very thin slices, and bake it m a warm oven. Putting an edging of puff paste round the dishes, makes your puddings look ornamental, but it is old- fashioned, and should only be used as a variety.

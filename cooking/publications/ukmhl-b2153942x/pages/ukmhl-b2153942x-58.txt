CONFECTIONiKl CjU JELLIES. calfâ€™s foot jelly. Be particularly careful that every thing used in. making jelly is quite clean, or it will be impossible to get it clear, and of a good colour, or to obtain that delicacy of flavour for which it is so much esteemed. A jelly bag should be made of thick flannel, cut into a long half diamond shape; sew the two longest sides together, and then sew the open end to a hoop, which will make it into the shape of a long funnel, but leave no opening at the point. Carefully wash two calf s feet, cut them in pieces, and boil them gently in two quarts and a pint of water, till a spoonful of the liquor will set in a few minutes when taken into a cool place; this will take two, or per- haps three hours. Then strain off" the liquor, and care- fully take away all the fat from the top. This will be easiest done the next day, when cold; but if you want it immediately, skim off as much of it as you can with a skimmer, and then draw strips of writing paper slowly across the top, till you have soaked up all the fat, and the paper appears without grease spots. Add to the liqour a quarter of a pint of white wine (sherry is the best), enough loaf sugar to sweeten it, and the juice of four lemons, which you must strain in. Whisk the whites of three eggs in a basin or pan, so as to well mix them, and add your liquor to them a little at a time, whisking all the while. Put it into a clean stewpan, add the rind of two or three lemons pared off very thin, a small piece of cinnamon, a few coriander

S4 CONFECTIONARY them on iron or tin plates, and bake them in a warm oven: when cold, take them off the paper. ALMOND ROUT CAKES. One pound of sweet almonds, one pound of loaf sugar. Beat the almonds and sugar quite fine, and make it into a moderate stiff paste with the yolks of eggs. Make them into any shape your fancy may dictate. Use finely powdered loaf sugar to dust your board or blocks; in making them, place them on clean tins that are slightly buttered, so as not to touch each other, or lay a sheet of whited brown paper on the tin, to put them on, and dust it with loaf sugar. Let them remain in a warm place all night, or a day and a night, before they are baked. Put them in a brisk oven; when lightly i'ijioured over, they are done. Ornament them with nonpariels, candied peel, drops and comfits, when making them, while the paste is moist, or after they are baked. Make a mucilage of gum- arabic, and lay it, with a small brush, over the parts where you wish the nonpariels to adhere, and otherwise ornament them with piping. If you wish to cut your paste out of blocks, put it in a stewpan over the fire; keep stirring it with a spoon or spaddle; stir it well from the bottom. When you find the paste does not stick to the sides of the pan and come all together, it is done. Let it get cold be- fore you cut it out. When they are made in this way, the impression shows much better. ALMOND ROCKS. One pound of sweet almonds, two pounds of loaf Qugar, a pound and a half of sweet almonds cut in alioea.

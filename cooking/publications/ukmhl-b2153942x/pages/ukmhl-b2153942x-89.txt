91 MADE EAST. roll and double your dough, just the same as if you were making cottage loaves, but must not separate the pieces, only roll them up to the length of the tin, and put them into the tins, so as to fill them not more than half full, which will give the dough room to rise and fill the tin; and then you will have a nice crust at the top. Another sort of tin loaves is made by rolling the dough out with your hand, to the width of the tin, and then rolling up one end as far as the middle of the piece of dough, and after that, rolling up the other end of the ])iece of dough, to meet the piece first rolled up; put the piece into the tin, with the join uppermost, and when it is baked, it will show a light-coloured crease along the middle of the top of the loaf. Cakes are made by rolling out small pieces of dough and making them round, then flatting them by pressing your hand on them; you may notch them by cutting them with a knife, round the edges, which will give you more crust, as the notches open in the baking; or you may slightly cut them on the top, in any form you fancy. Loaves will require about an hour and a half in a hot oven; but cakes will not require more than an hour. If you live near a baker^s, it would be better to send your bread to him to bake, as a baker’s oven has a more steady and regular heat than can be had in an oven by the side of the fire in a range. The process of moulding, as the rolling out and doub- ling over is called, must be done as quickly as possible, as all the time you are doing it, the dough is rising, atid will, if you are too long, weaken it, and make the bread heavy. HOUSEHOLD BREAD. Put into a clean pan, or a wooden trough, not too deep, a bushel of flour, and make a hole in the middle of it; then mix, in another pan, a pint of brewer’s yeast with a pint of warm water and a quarter of a pound of salt, and strain it through a sieve; then mix a little

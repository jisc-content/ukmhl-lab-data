CONFECTIONAKY 36 EASPBERKY BISCUITS. Three pounds of stale or broken almona goods, such as Macaroons, Eatafias, or Almond Cakes, and one pound of common Biscuits, or some stale Sponge Cakes. Beat this mixture fine in a clean mortar, and pass it through a sieve; put it again in the mortar, and beat it into a moderate stiff paste with the yolks of eggs. Roll it out into a sheet about one-eighth of an incli thick, to any size you please; spread a thin layer of raspberry jam; roll out another sheet the same size and thickness as the former, lay it on the top; then cut it in pieces, with a knife and straight edge, about three inches long by an inch or inch and a half wide; put over, a layer of rather thin iceing, made with the white of egg, and loaf sugar dust, (see iceing for Rich Cakes), spread it on as evenly as you can; then separate them, and lay them off on a tin that is covered with wafer paper, an inch apart. Bake them in a cool oven with the door open; when the iceing is of a pale delicate brown, they, are done. If your iceing is too thin, it will run down the sides, and disfigure them; and if the reverse, it will all scale off after they are baked. RASPBERRY BISCUITS, (No. 2.) Instead of using the almond goods, and biscuits, or sponge cakes, take as follows:—One pound of sweet almonds, two pounds of loaf sugar, and one pound of biscuits, or Hour, and proceed as before.

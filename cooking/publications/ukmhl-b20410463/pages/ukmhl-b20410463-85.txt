BREAD MAKING. 69 who judge entirely by the smell, and others decide by appearance. Occasionally, on cutting a loaf, it is found to have large and irregular holes in the centre, or sometimes just under the top crust, and it is not easy to assign a reason for this. In some cases the cause is doubtless insufficient kneading, in others careless moulding of loaves ; but when neither of the above may be suspected, the cause is probably owing to the nature of the flour used. Some flours contain so little gluten, and their chemical composition is such that the tiny bubbles formed by the yeast run together, making larger and larger holes. Many flours, good for pastry and other purposes, will not make satisfactory bread on this ac- count. Good bread cannot be made without suitable flour, good yeast and careful attention to many little points.

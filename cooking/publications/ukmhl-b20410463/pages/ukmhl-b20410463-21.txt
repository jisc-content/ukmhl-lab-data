CHOICE, CARE AND CLEANING OF UTENSILS. 5 new pan needs care in this respect. If allowed to become very hot by a flame up the side while the pan is only partly filled with liquid, the tin is likely to melt; a poor quality is certain to do so. Iron pans should be unlined if to be used for frying or any purpose requiring great heat; and, as frying is often a preliminary process of a stew, it is a mistake to buy a tin-lined stew-pan. Enamel-lined iron pans are very cleanly while new, but will not stand much hard usage ; and, owing to the different degrees of expansion of the two materials when heated, the lining soon becomes covered with little cracks, and eventually chips off. A good quality of thin enamel ware makes a fairly useful pan if carefully treated, but the cheaper makes are rarely worth their cost. Brass, copper, steel and tin are all used for pans, and where well kept—clean and dry—are all good ; but otherwise the two first become dangerously unwholesome, and the two last are soon worn through by the action of rust. A cheap tin pan is not worth buying, for the poorer the tin the more quickly it will rust. A pan is most easily cleaned immediately after use. If the cleaning cannot be done at once, and anything ad- heres to the inside of the pan, fill it with water and leave it to soak. Pans should be washed both inside and out. When an open fire is used for cooking, the outside will need scraping with an old knife and brushing with a hard brush kept for the purpose. If a pan is burnt, scrape off as much as possible of the burnt substance, fill with water and soda and boil. If necessary, repeat the scraping and boiling. The pan brushes now commonly sold for a few pence are a great convenience in this part of kitchen work. Iron pans are scoured with bathbrick, fine sand, or preparations such as Brooks' soap, sapolio, etc. Care

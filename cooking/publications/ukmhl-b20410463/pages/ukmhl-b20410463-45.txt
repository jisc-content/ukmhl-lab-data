PRESERVED FOODS. 29 2nd. Yegetables are preserved in a liquor which should be drained away, and they are then well washed before using. 3rd. Fruits and most Fish should be served or cooked in the juice or liquor which is about them. Those foods preserved by drying, whether meat, fish or vegetables, require steeping in cold water to soften and moisten the fibres, and this whether dried merely, or salted in addition. In choosing canned foods it is important to notice :â€” The Brand, choosing cans with the name of a reliable canner and importer. The Condition of the Tin, rejecting any with bulged out ends, that being a sure sign of putrefaction. Tins should be stored in a cool even temperature. Vegetables are as a rule better bottled, though some kinds are only to be had in cans. Peas^ small and light green, are to be preferred to the larger darker kind. Tomatoes preserved whole are better than those in pulp for general purposes, though the pulped ones are ex- cellent for soups and sauces. Oysters canned are only fit for sauces and flavouring, should always be of the best quality, and used as soon as opened. The contents of tins will sometimes remain good for days if properly attended to. They must be removed from the tins at once, and kept in a cool dry atmosphere. Truffles will keep if drained from their liquor and covered with sherry. Button mushrooms also drained and covered with white vinegar, and rinsed before using will be wholesome though lacking flavour. Extreme care must be taken in using all preserved foods, and if there is the slightest suspicion of their freshness, they should be rejected at once.

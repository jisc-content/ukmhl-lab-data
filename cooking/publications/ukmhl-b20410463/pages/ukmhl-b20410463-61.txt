METHODS OF COOKING. 45 the most wholesome and digestible method of cooking meat. But this method is only suitable for thin pieces, as chops and steaks, and is never satisfactory for any but the tenderest parts and the very best quality of meat. Though steaks and chops alone have been previously spoken of in connection with the subject of broiling, other foods, especially poultry, small birds, and some kinds of fish may be very satisfactorily broiled. Foods that have little natural fat, as poultry, etc., are generally folded in stiff well-greased paper before grilling, to prevent their becom- ing dry and discoloured. The juices are not so perfectly retained in this way, for if the paper were exposed to such intense heat it would immediately burst into flame. The moisture, however, that is drawn from the food is unable to escape from the greased paper, and helps to keep up a certain amount of steam, which prevents the meat becoming dry, and forms a gravy which should be care- fully kept and served. Meat of all kinds is frequently prepared for broiling by being dipped in or brushed over with oil or melted butter ; this also helps to prevent unnecessary drying of the surface. Braizing is less one method of cooking than a com- bination of two, stewing or steaming, with baking or roasting. A proper braizing pan consists of a deep stew- pan to contain the joint, and a shallower one, forming the lid, which contains hot charcoal. A bed of vegetables is laid in the lower pan with an allowance of stock or water. The joint to be braized is placed on the top of the vege- tables, and if the amount of stock in the pan is sufficient to surround but not cover the meat it will be stewed, and the process of cooking must be slow as in that method. If, however, only sufficient stock is used to cover the

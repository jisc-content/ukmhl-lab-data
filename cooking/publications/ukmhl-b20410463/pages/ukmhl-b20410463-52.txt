PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. 36 180Â° Fah. The time varies with the size of the egg, from 2| minutes for poaching a medium-sized egg to 4| minutes for boihng a large one. If too much cooked, or at too high a temperature, the white becomes tough, hard, and to many people indigestible. When required for salads, garnishing, etc., the eggs must be boiled from 10 to 20 minutes, and if the yolk is to be powdered for sprinkling, it must be cooked for the longer time, or the centre will be somewhat tough and elastic, and useless for the purpose. When whites and yolks are separated for cookery purposes, the whites are usually beaten to a froth, and in this form are used to lighten and raise such mixtures as souffles and cakes. Whipped whites are also frequently used for decorations. In all cases they should be whipped just before using, if allowed to stand the froth begins to fall. A little salt added to the whites helps to bring them to a froth more quickly. When frothed whites are to be mixed with a heavier or more solid substance, great care must be taken not to break down the froth. The object of whisking being to mix in air, rough handling after- wards would render the whisking useless; the mixing must therefore be done very carefully. They should be folded or wrapped up in the other substance, but the mixing must also be thorough, for any pieces of white separated from the rest will toughen and taste leathery, besides failing in the special purpose of giving lightness to the mixture. After mixing lightly and perfectly all such preparations should be cooked at once. The white "speck" should always be removed from a broken egg, as it is easily distinguished aAr cooking, and in anything of a liquid nature, such as custards, sauces, etc., it would be hard and unpleasant.

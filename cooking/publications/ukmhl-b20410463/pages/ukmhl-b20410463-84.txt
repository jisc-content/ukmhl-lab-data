68 PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. bread, or they will fall flat in the oven. Brown bread, owing to the nature of the flour used, will not make good cottage loaves or fancy shapes, it is more suitable for tin bread or scones, etc. The heat of the oven for baking is given by authorities as from 500° Fah. downwards. Some give the first tem- perature for baking as low as 350° Fah. This diversity of opinion is chiefly owing to the fact that the construction of ovens is so very various, and the nature of heat in an iron and a brick oven is not quite the same. Also we must remember that a large batch of bread will, by its en- trance, lower the heat more than a small one. Few private houses, however, are able to use a thermometer for such purposes, and what is generally known as a hot oven is all that is found necessary. For the first part of the baking, for about one-third of the time calculated to complete it, the oven door should be kept shut. At this stage all the steam from the bread should be kept in the oven, and, as the heat quickly kills the yeast, and the rising in the oven is chiefly the result of expansion of the tiny bubbles contained in the dough, no cold air should be admitted till the bread is fully risen and a crust formed. When this point is reached, the heat ought gradually to decrease, that the centre of the loaves may be well baked without the crust being burnt. Under-baked bread is very unwholesome. To judge if properly baked, it is customary to try it in various ways, but all these tests need an accompani- ment of experience. If the loaf, on being knocked, sounds hollow, it is said to be well baked ; if the sound is heavy and leaden, it is under-baked. A crust that is elastic and springs back after pressure is considered another sign of well-baked bread, and there are people

46 PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. vegetables, the meat will be cooked in the steam steamed"), and the fire must be sufficient to keep up the supply of steam. The pan is to be tightly covered, then the steam rising from the liquor, which is charged with the flavours of the vegetables, will cook the meat and transfer these flavours to it. While the stewing or steaming is proceed- ing, the bed of hot charcoal in the deep lid roasts and browns the surface, the steam basting the joint and pre- venting it drying. Occasionally the lid must be removed and the joint well basted with the liquor and sometimes turned. As neither these pans nor charcoal are common in English kitchens, the two processes are sometimes carried out separately. The stewing is first accomplished, then the joint is placed for a short time in a hot oven and browned and glazed. The method is most suitable for solid, somewhat close pieces of meat; and if they are of indifferent quality, flavour and moisture are imparted by this process. White meats are generally, and red meats sometimes, larded, which also tends to improve the flavour.

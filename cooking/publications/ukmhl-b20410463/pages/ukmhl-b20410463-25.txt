CLEANING AGENTS. 9 as, though invisible, there is a sHght dark residue noticed if a white cloth is rubbed over the polished surface. Washing will not make a perceptible difference in the brightness if the pan is thoroughly and quickly dried. Bathbrick moistened wdth oil will clean steel, and if afterwards used dry imparts a good polish ; if the steel is greasy, and yet not to be brought into contact with food, turpentine may be substituted for oil with good effect. Either of these liquids will leave a certain oiliness on the surface, which resists the action of moisture, whether from the atmosphere or from accident, but turpentine or methylated spirit must both be avoided on utensils brought into contact with food. Water w^ould be used in preference, and for all such things as are in daily use, and therefore being constantly cleaned, water would be sufBcient. Steels that have been allowed to become rusty may be treated with Emery, either powder or paper, but this should only be employed in extreme cases, as it dulls the surface of the metal if used often. Blacklead moistened with turpentine for the parts of a stove or grate liable to be greasy will be found better than blacklead and water. Turpentine removes the grease entirely, and, being a spirit, evaporates, leaving the blacklead evenly distributed and ready to impart a polish under friction. Water has no action on grease, which would have to be removed by the brush. The iron is therefore difficult to pohsh, and the brush soon becomes hopelessly spoiled. For grates where there is no proba- bility of grease being present, water is frequently used to moisten the blacklead, but never gives quite the same brilliancy, owing to the brushes becoming damp.

COOKS' STORES. 23 or other purposes. The " crumb " of bread, if very fresh, may be roughly broken up, thoroughly dried on the top of the stove or in an almost cold oven, then pounded and sieved. By putting through a sieve, the crumbs are of uniform size, and this uniformity cannot be obtained by grating. Such dried white crumbs may be used for crumbing fish or meat for frying. Hard morsels of bread and soft white crusts are quite suitable for steeping in water or milk for farces or forcemeats where steeped bread is needed. Crusts should be broken quite small, dried perfectly in a cool oven, then browned to pale golden brown, when they may be crushed and sifted and kept in air-tight bottles or tins. These crumbs should not be allowed to become dark coloured ; all dark or burnt morsels of crust should be removed before crushing. The crushing of the dry crusts should be done on a slate or chopping board ; on no account should a pastry rolling- pin and board be used for this purpose, as they would be roughened and utterly spoiled for pastry making. Brown crumbs have many uses, such as raspings for ham, dishes au gratin, re-garnishing any dish which is not perfectly coated or requires dressing, and for lining baking moulds for either sweets or savouries. For many purposes fresh white crumbs must be pre- pared, and frequently more than are actually used. Such crumbs, if not touched by fish or other strong flavoured food, should be dried and re-sieved ; they may be kept some time.

Strictly speaking this flour is not brown, but a dark cream colour, and can only be called brown by comparison with white flour. It may be prepared in quantities, and is

i6 PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. Knots or kernels in either lean or fat are indications of disease. Pork, more than any other kind of butcher's meat, must be carefully chosen. It is only wholesome in winter, and should never be used in warm weather. Poultry.—Choose white-legged fowls for boiling, as they have generally the whitest flesh. Black- or yellow- legged fowls have generally darker flesh but richer flavour, and are often preferred for roasting. In every case choose fowls with the claws uncut, as it is then much easier to remove tke sinews. The breast-bone should no^be broken; for though this practice of poulterers malces the bird look more plump, it interferes with the proper carving of the breast. Unless for stock or soups, j^poultry should always be young. Young birds may be known by :— 1. The softness of the breast-bone and tip of the pinions, which are practically gristle when young. 2. Brittleness of the beak. 3. Length of spurs—in old birds these are worn down. 4. Downy feathers, and the absence of long or coarse hairs.

VEGETABLES. 33 removed ; and if the weather or store place be excessively cold they should be brought to the ordinary temperature by lying in the kitchen for a while before being used. If actually touched with frost, they are spoiled, but may be used for stock and flavouring purposes if laid for a few hours in cold water. The cold water is several degrees above frost, and will thaw them gradually, while the sudden application of heat would make them stringy and tough. When being cooked, the temperature of the liquid used should vary with the age of the vegetable. While fresh and comparatively young they cook best if placed in boiling liquid, but as they become older the tem- perature of the liquid should be reduced, till in the late season, before the new young vegetables are quite ready, the old ones should be placed in cold liquid, cooked slowly and for a long time. At the latter stage, however, it is waste of time attempting to prepare them for a vegetable course. Green vegetables should always be perfectly fresh. One sign of this is their crispness. Any which have become soft or limp are not in prime condition. Leaves, stalks or pods should crack sharply when bent, flowers should have crisp leaves; in cauliflower or broccoli the flower should be white and close. All should be bright in colour with no withered or yellow leaves or shells, and should be selected of equal size if for cooking together. They all require careful washing in salt and water, and the leafy kinds may be steeped in salted water for a short time, in case of flies or slugs being hidden, as it will cause them to separate, but much steeping toughens and impoverishes the vegetable. As a general rule, if plainly boiled, green vegetables 3

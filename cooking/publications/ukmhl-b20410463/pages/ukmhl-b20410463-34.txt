i8 PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. fat, especial care is taken to keep game well basted and protected from the dry heat of the fire by barding with bacon. Fish.â€”Almost more than any other kind of food it is essential that fish should be used when fresh and in full season. It putrifies more quickly than other food, and in many cases becomes dangerously unwholesome. Like other things it is always most plentiful and cheapest when in season. Its condition is easily judged by smell and appearance. The odour of stale fish is quite indescribable, but would be detected at once by the merest novice. When fresh the flesh is firm, quickly recovering from pressure, and of a good even colour, not mottled in appearance, the eyes are bright and prominent, and the gills red. The red spots on plaice fade from the time it is taken out of the water, till, in a s-tale fish, they are scarcely discernible. There are a few kinds of fish which may safely be kept for a short time^ and cod and turbot are by many considered to improve when kept a day or two ; but nearly all are finer flavoured and of better quality when used quite fresh. Some of the coarser kinds, as mackerel, are unfit for food a few hours after being caught. When fish has to be kept, let it remain in a cool place, if possible in a current of air, never in water. It may need steeping a short time before cooking, but shoul^ never lie long in water, as this impoverishes the flesh and makes it flabby. Thorough and careful wash- ing is essential, especially for fish from small streams and ponds, as such fish are often slimy both to touch and taste ; in such cases the fish must be rubbed with dry salt in addition to being thoroughly washed.

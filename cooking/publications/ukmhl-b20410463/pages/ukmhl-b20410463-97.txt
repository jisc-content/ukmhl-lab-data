CLEAEING OF JELLIES. Some jellies are not intended or required to be cleared. In these cases it must be remembered that though not transparent they must be free from any solid substance, and this is only to be ensured by careful straining through a fine material such as a tammy or hair cloth. In all jelly making the first essential is absolute cleanliness of all utensils and materials used. The jelly pan should be of a material capable of being perfectly polished, brass by preference, and it should be polished directly before, as well as after, using. Egg shells should be well scrubbed before the eggs are broken, lemon rinds carefully cleaned, and no speck of any kind of fat or starch allowed to come in contact with either materials or utensils. Wire whisks need special attention —much more than they often get—if they are to be in a fit condition for whisking jellies. Any failure in perfect cleanliness will result in cloudy jelly. Cleanliness alone, however, will not clear it. For this albumen is the prin- cipal agent, and is provided in the case of sweet jelly by white of egg—two whites being sufficient to clear one quart of jelly. Savoury jellies are also cleared with white of eggs in the same proportion, but have frequently the additional help of raw meat, which contains a large pro- portion of albumen, and yields also a certain flavour. The albumen must be thoroughly blended with the other ingredients by means of vigorous whisking till the jelly (8i) 6

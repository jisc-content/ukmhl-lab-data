PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. 24 useful for brown sauces and gravies, and for thickening brown soups when any flour thickening is needed. To prepare it, ordinary flour must be spread very thinly on a surface, such as a baking tin or plate, and put in a cool oven. It must be carefully watched, as any scorch or overbrowning will give a bitter flavour to the flour, and spoil any dish for which it may be used. Dried Herbs.â€”These should not be used when fresh herbs can be procured, but as there are many times when certain herbs cannot be had in a fresh state, a store of dried herbs should be kept in every kitchen. They may be bought in bottles, but are not generally of such good flavour as home-dried ones. Herbs for drying should be gathered when dry and fully grown, just before they begin to flower, tied in bunches, keeping the different kinds apart, and hung in a rather warm room till crisp and dry. Each bunch should be protected from dust by being placed in a loose paper bag. When dry the stalks are stripped off, and the leaves crushed or pounded to a fine powder, then bottled. Let all stores of dried herbs be renewed every season, as the flavour is never so good as when freshly dried. When used in liquids, to avoid sediment, flavouring herbs should be tied loosely in a scrap of muslin, they are thus easily removed when their flavour is extracted. Parsley may be dried as other herbs, but generally it can be procured in a fresh state. Still in case of failure through severity of winter weather, a little may be dried in summer while it is plentiful and of a good colour. When used mainly for its colour dried parsley may be placed in water a short time before it is needed, this will to a certain extent restore the green.

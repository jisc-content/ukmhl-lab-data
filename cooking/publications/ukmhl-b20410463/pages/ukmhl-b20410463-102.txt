86 PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. the mould. The best preparation for delf moulds is to brush them lightly but thoroughly out with oil. If any drops remain in the cuttings, rinse with cold water and turn upside down to drain. This preparation will cause the cream to slide out easily without roughening the surface. If a metal mould is used no preparation is needed for a mixture containing gelatine. The metal being thin and of even thickness, a momentary plunge into hot water is all that is required to loosen the mixture, and it may be turned out without trouble. The water for this purpose must be perfectly clean and as hot as the hand can comfortably bear. The mould must be plunged over-head for an instant only. This will generally be found sufficient to loosen the contents; but, if the mould has been standing on ice, a second plunge may be needed. In every case the operation must be quickly performedâ€”simply a plunge and out again. The mould and mixture should be carefully wiped dry from all trace of water before attempting to turn out.

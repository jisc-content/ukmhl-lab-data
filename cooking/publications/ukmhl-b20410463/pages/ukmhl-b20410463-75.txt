GRAVY AND SAUCE. 50 food substances by frying or sauteing, and are thickened afterwards by the addition of some form of starch. Whatever the foundation or method of preparation, sauce is intended finally for one of two purposesâ€”either for coating or serving as an accompaniment to a dish. For coating, it should be thin enough to pour freely and smoothly, but thick enough to cling to the surface and not run off, leaving it bare or only smeared. A good deal of care must be exercised in making and using sauce for coating hot substances. Although it must not be so thin as to run off the food, it must be thin enough to cover the dish evenly and form a neat and orderly garnish to the whole. It is, therefore, often better to coat the meat with a portion of the sauce and then add more liquid to the remainder till thin enough to run easily over the dish. In coating cold meats, the consistency of the sauce is of less consequence, provided it is not too thin, as it is only applied to the meat, and is not served on the dish itself. Cold coatings often have jelly or gelatine added, rendering them stiffer and brighter when cold. Those sauces served as an accessory, but apart from the dish, are considerably thinner than the coating sauces, and recipes are often very misleading. For this purpose it should never be so thick that it will not pour from a spoon or ladle, and it must not be forgotten that all containing starch are liable to thicken after cooking if allowed to stand any time. They should, therefore, be thinner in the pan than it is desirable they should be when served. To prevent a skin forming on the surface, either keep it stirred till required or finish the actual cooking or boiling before adding all the liquid ; the remainder may then be gently poured over the surface of

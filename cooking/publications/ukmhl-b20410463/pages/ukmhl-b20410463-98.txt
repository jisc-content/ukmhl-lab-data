82 PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. reaches boiling-point. The whisking must then be dis- continued, and the contents of the pan should boil briskly for three or four minutes so as to thoroughly harden the albumen, during which boiling it gathers together the impurities in the jelly. It must be allowed to stand, the pan being covered to keep in the heat, till the scum cracks and shows a clear liquid. The next process is the strain- ing. The entire contents of the pan must be poured into a jelly bag suspended where it will not get chilled or shaken. The egg shells settling at the bottom of the bag form a filter through which the liquid passes and where it leaves behind all the hardened albumen and the sub- stances contained in it. The first part of the liquid which passes through the bag will not be clear, but as soon as it runs clear the first liquid should be carefully returned to the bag without disturbing the other contents ; in this way all the jelly will strain perfectly. In order to avoid waste of the jelly, heat the bag with boiling water just before using it, have the bag set in a warm place out of draughts, and after pouring in the contents of the pan cover the bag to keep it as warm as possible. The ordinary felt jelly bag as supplied by shops is not altogether a satisfactory article. It is somewhat too close while new, and after a few scaldings and washings fre- quently keeps back as much jelly as it lets through. It is better to make a bag of flannel not too closely woven, so as to allow for shrinking. A rather closely woven tea cloth is sometimes used for this purpose, but it is liable to be troublesome owing to its shapelessness. Whatever is the material used it should be spotlessly clean, and flannel or felt need the utmost care to prevent any smell or taste of soap being detected. Wines and spirits when added to jelly should be added

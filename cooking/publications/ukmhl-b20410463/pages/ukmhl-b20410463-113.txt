(97) 7 TEUSSING POULTEY AND GAME. Trussing is the preparation of poultry and game for cook- ing, and is frequently done by the poulterer when birds are bought, but as a great deal never passes through a poulterer's hands, it is important that a cook should per- fectly understand the operation on which to a large extent the appearance of the dish and comfort of the carver depends. Plucking or removing the feathers is the first stage. The longer the process is deferred after killing the easier it becomes, quite fresh birds being difficult to pluck with- out tearing the skin. Take hold of a pinch of feathers between the finger and thumb and give a sharp pull, always in the downward direction, or as they lie on the skin. Begin with the soft feathers under the wings and over the breast, then the back, and two or three inches up the neck. Take the large feathers from the wings and tail one or two at a time and pull them out thoroughly, taking care not to leave any quills behind. If quills are left in the flesh, which often happens with large birds, take hold of them with the edge of a small knife and the thumb and they will come out. Singeing.â€”After plucking, a quantity of down and sometimes hair will be seen on the skin ; this is removed by passing the bird over a flame of gas or burning paper close enough to singe the down. Then wipe the bird over with a cloth.

22 PRINCIPLES OP PRACTICAL COOKERY. SO evenly as other fats, such as lard, dripping, or butter. With careful straining and avoiding overheating, the same bath of fat may be in constant use for a long time, and additions may be made as it gets reduced, but these additions must be of similarly clarified fat. Dripping, i.e., the fat that drips from baking or roasting meat, has many uses, but it is not to be recom- mended for a bath of fat. Dripping, especially if from a baked joint, is apt to be somewhat discoloured and strongly flavoured with juices from the meat. It should be clarified by melting in boiling water, keeping it well stirred, then allowing it to become cold, when the cake of fat may be removed from the top. Adhering to the under side of the fat will be found a deposit of brown sediment. This must be scraped away till the white fat appears, then the block should be melted and carefully heated to evaporate the moisture contained in it, and after this strained through a hair sieve or muslin. Caramel is used for colouring gravies, soups, sweets, wines, spirits, etc. It is made by melting sugar to liquid and then allowing it to heat until it becomes a dark brown, by which time it has lost its sweetness and developed a flavour of quite another character. If diluted with water in proportion of 1 pint water to 1 lb. sugar, it may be bottled and kept for use in a sufficiently liquid state to mix readily with other ingredients. It does not ferment, and will keep any length of time, therefore may be made in large quantities, and will be found one of the most useful adjuncts to cookery. Crumbs.â€”Many of the crumbs required in an ordinary kitchen can be obtained from pieces of bread left in the preparation of various dishes. Crusts and any scraps of clean fresh bread may always be utilised either for crumbs

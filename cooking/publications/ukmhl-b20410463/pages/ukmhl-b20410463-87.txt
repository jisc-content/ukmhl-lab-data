71 CAKES. the dry ingredients are mixed in and the whole made into a soft paste with beaten eggs and other liquid. When the proportion of shortening is very small, lard or dripping is often substituted for butter, but their flavour is unpleasant when used in large quantities. Lard and butter mixed make a good shortening for plain cakes. Baking powder is generally added to such mixtures; they are not made so moist as pound cake, and generally require rather quicker bakmg. 3. Sponge Cakes.—The chief ingredients of the best quality of sponge cake are eggs and sugar ; flour must be used, but its weight is relatively small. Cheaper cakes have more flour, are moistened partly by milk, and baking powder is frequently used to help to make them light, but this is only from motives of economy. Strictly speaking, a sponge cake contains no butter, and for this reason can be given to invalids and children to whom butter after cooking would be indigestible. The usual method of mixing is to whisk the eggs and sugar till light and creamy—this is sometimes done over gentle heat; just before baking, the finely-sifted flour and the flavouring are carefully mixed in. If butter is used, it is first melted, and, when cool, but still liquid, added to the mixture. When baking, very moderate and yet uniform heat is required. Large sponge cakes are best baked in a brick oven, but smaller ones can be success- fully managed in an iron one if the heat can be kept regular.

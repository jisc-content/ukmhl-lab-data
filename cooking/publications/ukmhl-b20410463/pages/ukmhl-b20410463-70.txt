(54) SOUP. Soup may be classed under four headsâ€”broth, thick soup, purees and clear soups. The base of nearly all is stock, but the materials of which the solid and thick parts are composed decide the quality of the stock to be used.

This depends for its food value principally on the stock, which must, therefore, be strong and well flavoured. Frequently there is served as another course the meat from which the broth has been prepared. Thick Soup, by which is meant something about the consistency of cream, is stock which is thickened by some foreign substance such as starch, cornflour, bread, grains, eggs, etc. This stock must be of good quality, for the thickening substance cannot be used in sufficient quantity to increase perceptibly the food value. Purees are thick soups, but the thickening is due to the substance of which the puree is composed, which is pulped by being passed through a sieve in fine atoms, becoming again part of the soup. A certain amount of starch or other binding material is needed, not to thicken, but to bind the solid and liquid parts of the soup together and prevent the heavy substance from settling at the

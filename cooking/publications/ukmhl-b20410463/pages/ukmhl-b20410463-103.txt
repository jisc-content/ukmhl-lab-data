(87) ICES. These may be classed into three divisions:— 1. Those with a base of sugar and water-syrup. 2. plain cream. 3. custard made of eggs and milk or eggs and cream. The first are known as water ices, the second and third include all varieties of cream ices. Water ices may be made from stock-syrup of 32° to which is added the special fruit juice, flavouring and colouring required, which should reduce the strength of the syrup to 24°. Or the fruit juice may be extracted from fresh fruit at the time of making the ices, the sugar added and the whole boiled fco the right degree, viz., 24°. If too much sugar is used, i.e., if the saccharometer registers over 24°, it must be reduced with fruit juice or water, or it will be difficult to freeze and too rich when finished, while if it registers below 24° it must be raised to that point by the addition of strong syrup or sugar and longer boiling, otherwise it will freeze hard and poor. Extreme accuracy on this point is essential to insure uniform success. Frequently whipped whites of eggs are added to these ices just before freezing, and greatly increase their mellow- ness and richness. Plain cream ice (creme glacee) is made from thick

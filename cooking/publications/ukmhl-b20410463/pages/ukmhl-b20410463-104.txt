This flavouring may be used in the form of fruit syrup, jam, or fresh fruit, and in the case of oranges and lemons is extracted from the zest and juice. If either jam or fresh fruit is used it must be tammied or sieved to perfectly remove seeds and skins. An immense variety of flavours may be used for these ices, which are the simplest and quickest made of all. The third class of ices is, perhaps, the most popular, as it is certainly the most troublesome. The base of rich custard must be made with great care to prevent any risk of the eggs curdling. The sugar must be perfectly dis- solved and the amount calculated with due regard to the acidity of the other ingredients. The materials must be smoothly blended and perfectly cold before putting them into the freezer. When a good recipe has been secured, adhere with great strictness to the proportions given, and if difl'erent ingredients are used from time to time let the balance of the different materials be strictly maintained. Any of these ices may be dished in rough masses, handed or served, or they may be moulded, tinted ac- cording to the shape or flavour, and turned out in large shapes to serve from, or in small ones for each person. Freezers are of many kinds, varying from the home- made arrangement of milk can and pail to the most costly and elaborate machinery. Those known generally as American freezers are most used, because, though the work of freezing is more tiring and longer than with some others, the cream when once frozen can be kept in a condition for serving for an indefinite time. Others which are much more easily managed and quicker in their action

(35) EGGS. Of the three kinds of eggs used in cookery, hens', ducks', and plovers', hen eggs are the most useful, most plentiful, and the cheapest. Most of those used in England are imported from Ireland and France, and they are now received so frequently and the methods of pre- serving are so well understood, that one does not often have to guard against staleness. Where, however, there is any doubt of them, they may be tested in various ways. Quite fresh eggs will sink in a strong brine, and as they become stale they remain suspended at different depths in the brine, until an absolutely stale egg will float. Successful preservation depends in a great measure upon the condition of the eggs at the time of preserving —when they should be quite fresh. Different methods of preserving all aim at the same thing, namely, at coat- ing the porous shell with some substance which will prevent the air entering and setting up decomposition. Ducks' eggs are larger and richer than hens' eggs, and in using them in place of the latter fewer will be required. The whites of duck eggs will not froth well. Plovers' eggs are generally used directly for the table, and not for ordinary cooking purposes. Although smaller than either of the others they require much longer cooking, generally not less than 7 minutes. When used as food, eggs should be cooked at a low temperature—about 160'' Fah., or if in the shell at about

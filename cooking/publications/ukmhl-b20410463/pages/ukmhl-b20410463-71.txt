SOUP. 55 bottom. Frequently the material of which the puree is formed is of such a nature as not to require the addition of meat, such as beans, peas, lentils, etc. ; others are improved by being made of second stock, while others require as good stock as can be obtained, there being little or no nutriment in the substance itself. At the same time, it must be observed that, except in the sick- room and in the very plainest housekeeping, soup is not regarded as a course to satisfy hunger, but rather as a preliminary or appetiser, and it is a great mistake so to increase the strength of soup as to present it in the form of highly concentrated nourishment. By so doing it may be made indigestible in a high degree, while in its original form it is one of the most easily digested forms of food. Clear Soup is stock freed from all the constituents which tend to make it cloudy, and the first essential point is the quality of the stock. The inferior kinds made largely from bone will not clear satisfactorily, nor would it be of any value if it did, for the process of clearing removes so much of the valuable properties contained in the stock that, unless it is good and strong before, the soup is not worth the labour expended on clearing it. Stock for clear soup, therefore, should be made of good stock meat and well flavoured with vegetables, herbs and seasonings. When cold, it must be perfectly freed from fat and sediment, both of which tend to prevent perfect clearing. This clear soup (consomme) has added to it certain garnishes and flavourings from which, or from the manner of preparing them, the special name is derived. In making all soups except clear soup, great attention should be paid to skimming during cooking, as this has

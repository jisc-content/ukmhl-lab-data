(72) SOUFFLES. Souffles are either steamed or baked, a similar mixture being used in either case. Steamed souffles are by far the most dehcate, but also the most difficult to cook, and therefore often set aside for the easier method of baking. One of the points upon which success chiefly depends is the thorough preparation beforehand of all utensils, as when the actual cooking begins there should be no waiting. First prepare the mould in which a souffle is to be steamed. It should be fairly, but better not quite, new. If long in use, tin becomes discoloured, and eggs have a marvellous faculty for attracting to themselves both colour and flavour. A souffle tin must be kept for one purpose only, and the same tin not used for both baking and steaming, or the steamed souffles cannot be depended upon to turn out of the mould. For steaming purposes a plain "Charlotte" mould is best. It should be very thickly buttered, especially in the joining of the tin, the butter used being free from salt or water. The upright sides of the mould must be surrounded outside by a band of paper, kept in place by a string round the edge, the band to reach not more than one inch down from the top of the mould, and being tied on just under the edge. On no account must it be deep enough to touch the water in the pan, and it should stand above the edge as high as the top of the pan in w^hich it is to be steamed.

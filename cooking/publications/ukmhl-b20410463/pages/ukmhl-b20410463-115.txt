TRUSSING POULTRY AND GAME, 99 liable to slip out from the feet before leaving the body. In that case a morsel of paper or cloth must be wrapped round each sinew and then twisted round the skewer when it will be found possible to pull them out. There is one sinew which must be left, for if sufficient strength is exercised to draw it out the flesh of the leg will be torn. All but this one, however, can be drawn and the leg in this way rendered much more tender ; these sinews, if left in, harden during cooking into stiff bone-like substances diffi- cult to separate from the flesh. When all are removed cut off the foot at the break in the leg. This drawing of the sinews is not done in the case of small birds where they are so fine as to be unobjection- able, but in all from the size of a pigeon upwards it is essential. In the case of boned fowls the sinews may be picked out after the bone is removed. In the case of boiled fowls the short piece of broken bone must be taken off at the joint. For roasting, this piece is left on till it is ready for serving as it prevents the skin shrinking up the leg. If the backbone is very bent break it with a sharp blow that it may stand flat and steady. Sprinkle the bird inside and out with salt and pepper. When it is to be stufl'ed place the force- meat inside the neck of fowls, turkeys, etc., and inside the body of ducks and geese, drawing the flap of skin at the neck over to the back and securing it with a stitch or a small skewer. Lay the bird with the breast upwards and twist the wings so that the points are laid across the back. Roast Fowls, etc.â€”Press the legs firmly downwards and against the sides of the body, run a skewer between the folded bones of the wings, then through the point of the thigh, pass it through the body and out at the corre-

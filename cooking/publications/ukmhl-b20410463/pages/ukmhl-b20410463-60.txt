44 PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. for the purpose. The thinner pieces should have even greater heat apphed than the thick ones, as the longer thin pieces are exposed to the fire the more dry and tasteless they will become, while the thicker pieces may be slightly withdrawn after thoroughly hardening the surface and cooked rather more slowly that the heat may penetrate to the centre. The frequent turning must, however, be continued, or the juices will reach the hardened outer fibres, soften them, and escape. If a double broiler is used the turning is easily managed, but with a single gridiron care must be taken not to puncture the meat by using a fork. Steak tongs are made for the purpose of lifting and turning broiled meat, but a spoon or spoon and knife will answer. A small rim of fat on the chop or steak will tend to keep the edge moist and baste the meat, but too much will cause flame to rise in continuous jets, making the surface smoky. If there is absolutely no fat on the piece to be broiled, morsels of finely chopped suet may occasionally be thrown into the fire, as the sudden spurt of flame from this source leaves a deposit of fat on the meat which improves the flavour, and, without softening the albumen, prevents its be- coming uneatably hard and dry. When chops and steaks are almost cooked a pufliness which appears as they heat through begins to subside, and this is a sign that the juices are beginning to dry and the meat is cooked. When cut, broiled meat should look red and moist, and gravy should run from it. If there be the slightest blue tint the meat is raw, more than under- done, but if the redness is gone and it looks brown it is overcooked and flavourless. A great deal of practice and experience and careful watching for signs is needed to ensure success in broiling, which is generally regarded as

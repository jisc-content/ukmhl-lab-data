lOI TRUSSING POULTRY AND GAME. too small and bony to pluck, and in this case the broken •end of the wing is caught on the skewer. All poultry and game for roasting should be dredged with flour before and after trussing, to dry it perfectly, as otherwise it does not crisp and brown so well. Unless poultry is to be boiled or stewed it should never be washed or wet in any way, as this renders the £esh sodden and the skin soft. Good wiping with clean 'cloths should be quite sufficient. With the exception of ducks and geese, all poultry ;and game require rather a large addition of fat during roasting, as the flesh is dry. Fat is applied either by basting with butter or dripping, by -barding with fat bacon, or by larding before and basting during cooking. The time required varies, as in other meat, according to age, size, etc. Chickens will cook in from twenty to thirty minutes; fowls take from thirty to sixty minutes when young and tender, the only condition in which they are fit to roast; turkeys take from one to two hours and «even more if exceptionally large. Game takes longer in proportion to its size than poultry, and all birds require better and more cooking than beef or mutton.

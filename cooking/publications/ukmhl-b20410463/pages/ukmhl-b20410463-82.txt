66 PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. great part of the daily food ; very fine white flour is less nourishing, and brown flour is to many people less digestible. Potatoes and rice are occasionally added to the wheat flour, and sometimes a little shortening, butter or lard, is rubbed in. Salt acts as a check to fermentation, and must therefore never be added to the yeast in the early stages of bread making ; it should be thoroughly mixed with the flour, and never dissolved in the yeast liquid. Water, milk, or a mixture of the two, is the liquid used for bread. The quantity required depends upon the nature and dryness of the flour, as a rule about h pt. of liquid to each pound. The temperature of the liquid is important—it must be luke-warm, never exceeding 98° Fah. as the utmost limit ; a safe rule is to take 1 part boiling water mixed with 2 parts cold. When yeast bread has to be made in two or three hours, 1 oz. of good German yeast must be used to about 3 lbs. of flour, but where longer time can be given to the rising, a much smaller proportion is sufficient. Tests for Yeast.—In addition to the test of colour and smell previously mentioned, the following tests may be used at the time of baking. First, crumble the yeast and work into it some moist sugar, if good the two will form a liquid in a few moments. A second test is to add a little flour to this liquid, and after mixing it in well, pour in a little luke-warm water, set in a warm place, and a froth will be seen on the surface in a short time. These tests are not indispensable, and may be omitted altogether when it is known the yeast is good. There are two chief methods of mixing dough. When small quantities of bread are made, the yeast and luke- warm liquid may be mixed and the whole of the flour moistened and kneaded at once. When very large

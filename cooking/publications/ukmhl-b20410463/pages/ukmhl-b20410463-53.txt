Of the other three methods, stewing may be applied to fairly large and solid pieces, but it is better for small and thin ones, while frying and broiling can only be used for steaks, chops, and similar cuts. Braising and Steaming are combinations and modifications of these methods. Roasting is cooking by the direct action of radiant heat, and roasted meat is, strictly speaking, meat which has been placed in such a position that the radiation of a fire affects the w^hole surface equally, while at the same time a current of fresh air passes round it. This com- bination of heat and air has the effect of drawing out and improving the flavour of the meat in a manner and degree quite unattainable by any other method of cook- ing.^,. The proper appliance for roasting is called a " hastener," and consists of two parts, one from its shape called a bottle-jack, contains machinery, w^hich when wound up causes the weight, i.e., the joint, to revolve, and exposes its whole surface to the fire ; the other a

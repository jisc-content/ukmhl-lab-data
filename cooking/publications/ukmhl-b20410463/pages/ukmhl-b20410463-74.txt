58 PRINCIPLES OP PRACTICAL COOKERY. and water has to be used, a small quantity of some meat essence should be employed, as the sediment from a joint hardly ever contains sufficient flavouring or nutri- ment to bear being diluted with water. When gravy is to be thickened the fat is drained off, a little flour is sprinkled on the sediment, the two are fried together and seasoned, and the stock is added gradually in the usual way. It must be under- stood that thickened gravy for a joint is only thick by comparison with thin, it must not be confounded with sauce or the much thicker gravy served with stews. Gravy for stews and ragouts may be made either before or after the meat is cooked—generally the former —and is prepared by blending flour and fat over the fire and adding stock or water by degrees till the desired consistency is reached. About one pint of liquid to one ounce of flour is a fair average allowance, less liquid or more flour giving a consistency more nearly approaching a sauce. When the stew is formed entirely of fresh meat, water may be used for the gravy. The process of stewing withdrawing more juice from the meat than either roasting or baking, it follows that the gravy is stronger and richer and the addition of meat stock is unnecessary. If, however, the meat has been previously cooked, a great deal of the flavour and juice has escaped or dried away, and without stock the gravy is poor and tasteless. Plain sauces may be variously classified as sweet and savoury, brown and white, thick and thin, hot and cold, etc. A large number start from the same base, i.e., roux, either white or brown; others have a special liquor pre- pared by cooking in the stock certain seasonings or flavourings ; others, again, have essences extracted from

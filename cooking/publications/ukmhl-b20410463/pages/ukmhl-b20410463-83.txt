BREAD MAKING. 67 quantities are being used, it is found better to adopt the method known as " setting a sponge ". The yeast and part of the Hquid are poured into a hole in the centre, a little flour stirred in till a thin batter-like mixture is formed; this, covered with flour, is left to work, till a froth breaks through the surface, then the remainder of the liquid is added and the whole kneaded together. Good kneading is necessary, that every grain of flour may be moistened and the yeast evenly distributed in the dough ; the right method of kneading also encloses air, which helps forward the process of fermentation. The next step is the rising; the dough is put in a warm place, free from draughts, till it has swollen to about twice its original size. The rising cannot be regulated by time, as temperature, condition of flour, and, above all, the quantity and quality of yeast used, are variable and important factors. Nothing, however, can make up for insuflicient rising before the bread goes into the oven ; not only lightness, but also flavour and appearance, depend largely upon this point. The brown colour of crust most admired can never be obtained from in- sufficiently raised dough. If allowed to rise too long, or kept in too warm a place, the result will probably be sour bread, as lactic and other fermentations are likely to be set up. If the dough becomes really hot, the yeast will be killed and the bread be heavy. When moulding, it is well to use as little dry flour as possible ; it is a mistake to work fresh flour into the dough shortly before baking, as both appearance and flavour are deteriorated. Ordinary loaf tins should be filled rather more than half full, and then set to rise till the dough is almost level with the top. Cottage loaves, etc., after moulding, must be allowed to rise a little, but not so much as tin

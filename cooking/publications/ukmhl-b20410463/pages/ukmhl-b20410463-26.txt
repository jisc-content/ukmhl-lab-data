GAS STOVES AND OVENS. By stoves, as distinguished from ovens, is meant the various arrangements for boihng, grilHng, toasting, etc., by gas. Although such different names are attached to these, and so many different ways of managing them are employed, the principle is the same in all. In modern stoves the burners are of the class known as Bunsen or atmospheric burners. These do not burn undiluted gas, as those used for lighting, but a mixture of gas and air, which gives very little light, and an intense heat, while the actual amount of gas burnt is much reduced. The mixture of air and gas takes place in the pipe, which is cut between the tap and the burner, the cut end next the tap being run for a short distance—perhaps one inch—inside a much larger pipe or cup, which im- mediately contracts to the ordinary sized pipe and ends in the burner. This short pipe from the cup to the burner being open is therefore always full of air. When the tap is turned, the pressure from the meter carries the gas into the cup, where it mixes with the air, and in this mixed condition is still forced forward to the burner, where it ignites. When lighting a Bunsen stove, it is essential that the tap be turned and the current of gas be forced through the pipe before the match is applied. If this rule is not observed, the light is often drawn backwards and the gas (lo)

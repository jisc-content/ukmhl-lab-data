SOUFFLES. 75 hot cover, it will fall less quickly and can be served in better condition. The time allowed for cooking a souffle must be care- fully watched. If cooked too slowly it will take longer—• that is easily remedied ; but if cooked too long or too quickly the eggs wdll curdle and the pudding crack and collapse. The sauces are usually served on the same dish, and if of a contrasting colour form the only garnish required. They must be poured round, never over the souffle. For baked souffles the same rules must be followed as to thoroughness of mixing and cooking the separate parts. They are usually baked in the dish in which they are to be served, which is often slipped inside another of silver or earthenware before being placed on the table. Have a very hot oven and avoid causing a draught by too frequently opening the door. The band of paper round the dish must be thickly buttered, and should be fastened jast inside the rim of the dish, not on the outside as in steaming or the butter will brown on the outside and make it quite unfit for the table. In some cases this band is dispensed with, if a rather large dish is used, which allows room for rising, the dry heat of the oven stiffens the edges more quickly and there is less risk of an overflow. In the case of baked souffles the sauce, if any, is served in a sauce-boat.

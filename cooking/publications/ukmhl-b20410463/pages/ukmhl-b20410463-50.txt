34 PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. are placed in boiling water. If they are so old as to require slower cooking, they are not fit for simple methods, and should be dressed by some more elaborate process, or used for soups. In boiling, salt will be needed with all, and sugar with those having a natural sweetness, such as peas. A small piece of common or carbonate of soda is often recommended as helping to keep the colour bright, but it is not required. Quick boiling with the lid off and careful skimming will keep the colour quite as it should be if the vegetables are in perfect condition and quite fresh to begin with. Some consider the soda renders the green vegetables more digestible and wholesome, but it is a debated point, and certainly soda does not improve the flavour. The first idea of using soda arose from the fact that it softens the water and all vegetables cook better in soft than in hard water, but the little it would be safe to use without fear of injuring the flavour would not be sufficient materially to affect the hardness of the water. It is wiser, where the water is very hard, to depend on boiling as a means of softening, and the water which is to be used may easily be boiled for some time without a cover before the vegetables are placed in it. Salt, which is essential with all vegetables, tends to harden w^ater, though the quantity used with vegetables will not affect it perceptibly. It is safer, however, knowing this, to add the salt after the vegetables have begun to soften; it will do its work of seasoning equally well as at the beginning, and the vegetables are then past being affected by the condition of the water. Many greens are improved by being cooked with a very little fat in the water, butter or bacon being the most suitable, of course avoiding smoked bacon.

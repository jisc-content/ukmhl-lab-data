2 PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. weaken, if it does not at once puncture, the metal, and when a hole is thus made the strainer is absolutely useless. They must be thoroughly dried or they soon rust and spoil. Sieves.—Wire sieves are most commonly made of brass wire. It is essential that all wire sieves should be kept in a dry place. Iron wire is sometimes used, but it is difficult to keep it quite free from trace of rust. Copper is occasionally used, but it so easily becomes dangerous by the formation of verdigris that it is best avoided for sieves. Hair sieves quickly wear out, and should be re- served for purposes that cannot as well be served by a fine wire one. In rubbing any material through a sieve a wooden spoon should be used, as a metal one wears out the sieve more quickly. Sieves must be washed with a good supply of water, scrub the wood-work with a brush, and carefully pick out with a skewer any bits of matter that may have lodged between the wood and wire. Jelly and Soup Strainers.^—These are of various materials. They can be bought ready-made of a kind of felt^ or they may be very satisfactorily made at home of white flannel, or a close woven tea-cloth may also be used for the purpose. The home-made flannel ones are to be preferred. They should be made a pointed shape, but not with a sharp point—rather rounded instead. The flannel should not be extremely closely woven in the first instance, for it always shrinks considerably by the hot liquids poured through it. To wash a jelly or soup strainer, first turn the bag inside out and scrape away as much refuse as possible with a metal spoon—avoid a knife, as it might cut the flannel—then wash in hot water, changing the water frequently. Never use soap ; and as a bag properly

GELATINE AND yELLY. 79 boiling, as there is always a risk that some undissolved morsel may still remain. Leaf gelatine is thin and trans- parent, and some kinds will dissolve quickly in hot liquid without any previous steeping. This is convenient and saves time, but some, especially those prepared by what is known as the ''acid process," cause milk to curdle when boiled with it, and none are quite free from an unpleasant odour and taste, suggestive of too much gelatine having been used. Isinglass has the same properties as gelatine, but is prepared from finer and more costly materials, and its average price is about double that of gelatine. It is principally used for sick-room cookery. Its stiffening power, its preparation and the method of using it, are practically the same as gelatine, but being of somewhat finer texture it softens more quickly. Jellies.â€”The proportion of gelatine used for jellies varies according to the temperature of the weather, and to the purpose for which the jelly is required. Ordinary table jelly in average weather requires one ounce of gelatine to one quart of liquid. In calculating the liquid, care must be taken to include all liquids, such as lemon or other fruit juice, also any wine or spirit that may be added after the clearing process. Allowance, too, must be made for sugar or any substance which w^ill become liquid during cooking. An ordinary sweet jelly should be just stiff enough to retain its shape when turned out of the mould, yet soft enough to shake and quiver with the movement of the dish or table, so that the brightness and clearness of the jelly is noticeable. It should also be soft enough to serve with very slight pressure of the spoon, if it has to be cut or bitten it is much too stiff. If, on the other hand, it is too soft, it will collapse or melt in the ordinary

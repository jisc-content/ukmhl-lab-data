SOUFFLES. 73 The top is closed by a piece of paper laid over the band, to prevent condensed steam dropping from the lid on the souffle. Both band and sheet of paper should be thickly buttered. The pan must have a tight-fitting lid, to pre- vent escape of steam. A white lined iron pan or a common iron pan is better than one of thinner material, which would allow any variation of heat to be too quickly felt. About one inch depth of water will be sufficient to steam the souffle; the cooking being slow, the evapora- tion is not great. Too much water causes the mould to float, and any movement during cooking may cause the mixture to become close and heavy. The pan must be sufiiciently large to allow a good margin round the mould to leave space for the steam to rise freely, for lifting the souffle in and out easily and without shaking, also to allow it to stand somewhat to the side, so that the fire or gas is not directly under the tin mould, but at the other side of the pan. To make the lid fit still more tightly, a sheet of paper may be first laid over the pan. The base of a souffle is usually starch of some de- scription, and the greatest care must be taken to have this thoroughly cooked and to keep the exact proportions of the materials mentioned in a reliable recipe. A large pan must be used, so that the whites of the eggs can be mixed in without unnecessary crushing and without having to turn it into a cold bowl. As soon as the mixture is ready, place it in the prepared mould, and cook at once. The eggs used should be of the freshest, and the whites must be beaten extremely stiff. Generally more whites than yolks are used. Any solid substance, such as fish, added to a souffle, must be wholly or partially cooked before, except in the case of oysters, which do not require cooking; and all solid materials

PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. 6 must be taken to avoid materials that would roughen the surface. Enamel pans, if discoloured or burnt, are scoured with salt and an old lemon skin, or with crushed egg shell. For bright metal, brass, tin, etc., many cleaning and polishing materials are sold ; but whatever is used, one point is of great importanceâ€”the insides of bright pans should be well washed in hot water and dried with a clean cloth after 'polishing. Pan lids need as much, if not more, attention than pans themselves; and when buying pans it is well to avoid those lids that cannot easily be kept clean. The common shape, with a straight piece of metal for rim, is to be preferred to the more expensive and elaborate lid where the bottom edge of the rim is wired and the metal turned back over it.

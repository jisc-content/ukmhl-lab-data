COOKS' STORES. and pieces too often wasted may be utilised if care- fully melted and added to the bath. These small quantities should be cut in pieces, melted down in a cool oven, and the fat strained. Larger quantities should, after being cut up, be placed in a pan, then covered with cold water and boiled till the water has evaporated, during which boiling constant and thorough skimming is necessary. When the water has all evaporated, the ''clarifying" is finished, but there still remains the process of melting or "rendering" the fat. This must be done very slowly and with exposure to only slight heat, otherwise the sudden rupture of the fat cells will cause the liquid fat to splash out from the pan, the result being wasteful, unpleasant and dangerous. During the process of melting, the fat should be frequently stirred, as if pieces are allowed to stick to the bottom of the pan they will burn and spoil the rest. As the pro- cess of melting nears its completion, this stirring is more and more necessary. When all the pieces have parted with their liquid fat and the tissues sink to the bottom of the pan, having become shrunken and of a golden-brown colour, the fat must be cooled, then strained. As fat will without burning reach a very high temperature—400" Fah. or more—it must be considerably cooled before being strained through a strainer having solder about it, or the solder may be melted. If poured into earthenware vessels while extremely hot, they will probably break. When cold, properly clarified fat will be found white, hard and without flavour. Its chief use is for frying. It is sometimes recommended for pastry and cakes, but it is too hard to be quite satisfactory for either purpose, re- quiring pounding or rolling into fine paper-like flakes before it can be manipulated, and even then not blending

89 ICES. require a second and somewhat elaborate machine if the ice is not to be served at once. The principle is the same in all cases. A metal receiver with a close-fitting lid holds the mixture to be frozen. This is set inside a larger vessel, generally of wood, which is supplied with a socket into which a cor- responding ball on the receiver fits, and is thus held in position. The space between the inner and outer vessel is packed with ice and salt (freezing mixture). An arrange- ment of cogs permits the inner vessel to rotate, while a fixed knife, generally of wood, scrapes the frozen mixture from the sides of the receiver, and allows the more liquid parts to reach the colder edges. When the cream is to be moulded a second process is inevitable. After being frozen in the ice machine the cream must be tightly packed in a mould with a tight- fitting lid, carefully protected against the entrance of liquid by having the edges covered with fat. It is then buried in a freezing mixture of ice and salt for three or four hours. Or it may be packed tightly in a mould and set in a charged ice cave for the same or a rather longer time. In the latter case the seal of fat is not required, as the salt and ice do not come into contact with the mould and there is no risk of the salt entering. Ice caves are metal boxes suspended inside a second larger and stronger box, the space between the two being filled with ice and salt so that the inner box is entirely surrounded with the freezing mixture. When the door is closed, the temperature can be maintained below freezing-point for many hours by occasionally with- drawing some of the liquid and adding more ice and salt. The ices are thus ready for serving at any moment. Such a machine is to be desired where ices are

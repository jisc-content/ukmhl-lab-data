SAUTE OF I.AM B CUTLETS AU NATUREL. 37. Saute of Lamb Cutlets au Naturel. PitKPAitE ihe best end of three necks of lamb for cutlets, taking »;reat care that you do not cut the fillets in sawing off the chine bone and in cutting off the tops of the ribs, so that when your cutlets are prepared they are all of the same size. A little matter, such as ordering your necks of lamb the day before you need them, will aid you in doing this ; for nothing is worse to prepare than necks of lamb which are too fresh, and which are taken from an animal that has only been dead a few hours. It is ab- solutely necessary to pay attention to this. Well, having prepared your lamb cutlets and trimmed them all of the same size, prepare a little clarified butter, and place sufficient of the same in a saute plate pan, or two saute" plate pans, and when needed dress them over a somewhat sharp fire. When done, add a little well-pre- pared brown sauce, or espagnol as the French call it, and sprinkle a little pepper and salt over the same. Dish on a border of well-prepared potatoes, and serve with a mushroom sauce; that is to say, a brown sauce in which mushrooms (champignons) have boiled for ten minutes, with a little pepper and salt added to them. When serving,, place the mushrooms in the centre and pour the sauce round with a little over the cutlets; not forgetting that portion used when the cutlets were done. This entree should be dressed a few minutes before required, and should be sent very hot to table. Note.—Dressed spinach, peas, beans, or macedoine roots can also be served instead of mushrooms, and you can glaze lhe cutlets instead of pouring the sauce over them.

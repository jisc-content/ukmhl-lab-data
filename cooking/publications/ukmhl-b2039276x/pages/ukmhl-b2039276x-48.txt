When strained, pour part of the sauce over the maccaroni and add to this a quarter of a pound of preserved cherries without stones. Garnish with the Napolitaine ragout in the centre, and pour the sauce round when you serve, with a little over the cr&ne of beef. Entrees of Veal. 51. Sweetbreads of Veal a la Monarque.

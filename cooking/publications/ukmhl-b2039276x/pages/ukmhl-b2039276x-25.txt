COMPOTE OF PIGEONS A LA RuVAL, strictly insisted upon use half veal; and further, in their season, you can make Creme of Pheasant, of Partridge and also of Grouse. 14. Entries of Pigeons. The reader will please to remember, and excuse my re- minding him or her, that my calculations apply to two entries, for it is now almost the universal custom in a dinner of four entrees only to serve two of each. 15. Compote of Pigeons a la Royal. Take six boned pigeons, and take also one pound of pork, sausage meat; into the sausage meat mix, when prepared, one spoonful of chopped truffles, one spoonful of chopped mushrooms, a few scollops of dressed tongue cut into dice shape, a little herbaceous mixture and pepper and salt, and two yolks of eggs, mix these together. Then divide the same into six equal parts, with which fill the boned pigeons; cut the feet off, and make them into a nice shape and braize them or dress them in the oven on a small saute" pan, or a small stewpan, with a little stock to keep them moist; they should be covered with a round of buttered paper. Prom twenty minutes to half an hour will dress them; then take them up and dry them with a cloth; glaze them, putting them back in the oven to set the glaze, which should be done twice over, and which will give them a very glossy appearance.

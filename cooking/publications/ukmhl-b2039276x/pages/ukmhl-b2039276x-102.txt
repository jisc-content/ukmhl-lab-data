Perhaps it may require a little more salt, or a little more vinegar, and also a little sugar; and if you think so, add them. When ready it should be passed through a jelly-bag kept expressly for aspic jelly, or through a napkin washed in warm water and spread over a kitchen basin, into which the aspic should be very gently poured; and when you have poured about half, let an assistant take hold of two corners of the napkin and your- self take hold of the other two corners, and raise the same a few inches above the basin into which you are straining the jelly; should it not prove quite so clear or brilliant as you could wish, let it again be placed in the napkin and strained once more. Serve the remainder the same, and when passed place it where it will be ready for use. Pill two quart plain moulds about three-parts full, one for cutting into croutons, one for chopping, and the re- mainder for borders. And if you pass this jelly through a napkin, when it is running brilliantly through the same make a loop of a piece of string, pass this round the ends of the napkin and hang up the napkin by this in a warm corner till all has run through.

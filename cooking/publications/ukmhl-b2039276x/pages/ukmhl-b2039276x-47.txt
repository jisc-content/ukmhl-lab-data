37 FRITOT OF CREME OF BEEF A L'lTALIAN. from the vegetables on which they were dressed into the brown sauce, letting the same boil till of the proper con- sistency and skimming off any grease they may show. The manner of preparing the olives for this entree is as follows : take a pint bottle of olives, pour them out into a basin, then with your small cooking knife peel off the fleshy part of the olives so to speak in one piece, keeping your knife as close to the olive stone as possible,â€”this is done to extract the stone; the olive should then assua.e its former shape, which it will do readily if you peel the olive skilfully. When all are done make them hot in their own licmor, strain and place in the centre of your fillets of beef, and at the last moment pour your sauce, very hot, round your enti6e and serve. 47. Creme of Fillet of Beef a la Moderne. Take a fillet of beef from a rump of beef, free the same from fat, cut it in lengths and scrape all the flesh from the sinews and skin; pound this in a clean marble mortar and pass through a wire sieve the same as for quenelle, then finish exactly the same as for Creme of Fowl (see No. 1), placing the same in plain dariole moulds, which should be buttered and one slice of truffle placed in each. Serve with a good espagnol sauce, taking care it is not too thick; but more like a demi glaze than otherwise, and which should have a little puree of good tomatoes stirred into it. This should fill sixteen dariole moulds. 48. Fritot of Creme of Beef a- l'ltalian. Made the same as Fritot of Creme. of Fowl. (See No. 3.)

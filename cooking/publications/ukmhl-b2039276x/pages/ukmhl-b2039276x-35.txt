FRITOT OF CREME OF LAMB. -5 The same as Pritot of Cr£me of Fowl. (See No. 3.) (having previously folded a bit of paper place it at the bot- tom of the stewpan). Add about a gill of water, put this on the fire, and when it is boiUng fix the dariole mould on this; cover the same and let gently simmer for a few minutes, then try its consistency, and in this you must be most par- ticular, for on it the success of your labour will depend. Proceed then as follows : when you think the cr@me of lamb in the dariole mould is done, try it with your middle finger, and if it feels somewhat of the same strength as a mould of jelly when you try it before turning out to serve, it will do; but if you consider it too firm to the touch add a little more cream; when it is going to be dressed, or prepared in small moulds, such as is the case when prepared in dariole moulds, it will admit of being a little more delicate, that is to say, the mixture will take a little more cream, and should not be so firm to the touch as when prepared in a single mould. You would require two loins of lamb to make two dishes, that is to say, two out of four entrees for a dinner of sixteen or eighteen persons The sauce should be made from the trimmings of the lamb, adding about a pint of good stock, also a bouquet of thyme and parsley, a little sliced carrot and turnip; this should stew slowly for three hours; then strain and mix into either a white or brown sauce, taking care that the sauce is not too thick and is free from grease. ■Garnish with peas, or macedoine, or mushrooms. Note.—One pint of water should be added to the stock for the sauce. 36. Fritot of Crgme of Lamb.

QUENELLES OF FOWL. in; then add one whole egg and stir this well in, and then another whole egg. Roll a little bit about the size of a wine-bottle cork in a dust of flour, and then place a teacup of water to boil in a small stewpan; when it boils place the piece of quenelle in the same and let it very gently simmer in this for about three minutes, and if it then appears firm and compact to the touch it will do. I have omitted to state that two or three spoonfuls of cream should be added'; it should be a firm but delicate sub- stance, and it can readily be made more firm by adding another yolk or two, and more delicate by adding a little more cream. "When to your satisfaction, mould the paste as follows: take two silver or plated tablespoons, and have a quart of boiling water in a jug or stew-pa nby your side, or in front of you, and having the quenelle n eat in a china basm, dip one of the spoons into the quenelle meat so as to fill the spoon (the spoon should be held sideways and dipped m at the side of the basin), then with a cheese-knife made hot in the water smooth, or make smooth, the quenelle in the spoon; then make the other spoon hot, and with the hot .poon remove the quenelle from the cold spoon; this, after a little practice can readily be done; place these, as you do each, on a buttered strip of paper, and proceed till you have done twenty, the number needed for two entrees. The strips of paper should be of the same size and length, and cut to hold five quenelles, and the quenelles shotdd be as near as possible of the same size and neatly made When the twenty are made, cut a few truffles into very thin slices, and with a suitable cutter cut twenty round pieces from these the size of a fourpenny-piece.

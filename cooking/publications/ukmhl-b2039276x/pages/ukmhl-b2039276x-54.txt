BOMBS OF FAT LIVERS A l/AMBROSIA. 44 63. Bombs of Fat Livers & 1'Ambrosia. Open two or three cans of fat livers (the smaller the tins the more likely they are to be firm), cut them up into small dice shape, about this size Â£; take half pint of espagnol sauce, make it hot, and let boil in this sauce about two ounces of glaze; when the same is dissolved put the fat livers which you have cut into dice into the sauce, and chop up about six truffles and place the same in the sauce also, add a little cayenne pepper and salt, and mix very lightly together. Then turn the same into a clean stewpan and place on the ice, or where it can soon become quite cold and set, as they say in kitchen parlance, which means to become tolerably firm. When it is so, make it into small round balls of'equal size, about one inch in diameter, The best way to do this is to divide it into equal parts on the pastry slab, or on the cover of a stockpot, or saute pan; then place them to become quite firm on some ice; They should be made with as smooth a surface as possible, and should be slightly flattened at the base. While getting nice and firm take about half a pint of bechamel sauce, or say about three parts of a pint; make this warm and add to it a little aspic, about one gill. Then have a little pounded ice in a pan, place in this the warm aspic jelly and beahemel sauce, which should be in a quart stewpan; stir this with a wooden spoon, and when well blended try a little of it in any small vessel, say a dariole mould, and place it upon the ice, or imbed it in ice, to thoroughly set (removing for a time the stewpan containing the larger quantity).

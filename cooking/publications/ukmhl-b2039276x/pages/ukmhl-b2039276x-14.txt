When you have nicely spread the mixture, take another sheet of paper and cut it the same size, butter this also and lay it upon the creme of fowl, then sprinkle with a little water from a brush and place the same in an oven moderately hot. It will only take a few minutes to cook, and it is wise to stand by and guard the same; look at it after a few minutes, and when it is nicely firm take from the oven. When cold, cut it into pear-shaped scollops, serve with scollops of tongue between the fillets, cut round, use same sauce and garni- ture as for the Cr8me of Fowl a la Moderne and make hot in broth before serving, glazing the tongue. 3. Pritot of Crgme of Fowl. Take sixteen tartlet tins, not too large, lightly butter the same and fill about three parts full of creme of fowl mixture (as per recipe No, 1), and place the same in the oven for a few minutes; when quite firm to the touch remove the same, and when cold dip each one into a lightly made batter and fry in clean lard of a light brown, taking care that your lard is nice and hot before you commence. The batter to dip the fowl in should be made as fol- lows : take one pound of the very finest flour, place this in a three-pint basin, add one yolk of an egg, one gill of salad oil, and half a pint of light coloured ale; puur about two-thirds of the ale into the basin containing the flour.

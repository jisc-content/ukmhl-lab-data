In offering this brochure on culinary art to the public, I fceg sincerely to state that my object has been to produce a small but very useful work; my conviction being that to place a large volume in the hands of many cooks only tends to confound and puzzle them, and to fill the minds of those who are seeking to follow cooking as a profession with alarming doubts of ever being able of succeeding in the same; while a small volume at a small price, containing a judicious selection of good dishes, would tempt many to peruse and to study the same. And, let me add, the Epicure, the Invalid, and the Dyspeptic can more readily look over and select from a small work than from a laree and bulky volume, which very frequently only tends to weary and confound. I have purposely excluded soups and fish, and the plain roast and boiled dishes from my little work, because they are limited in number and the heads of most es- tablishments, and also the persons in their employ, quite understand all about them. With these few remarks I send my little work forth to the world; but should what is here offered be accepted

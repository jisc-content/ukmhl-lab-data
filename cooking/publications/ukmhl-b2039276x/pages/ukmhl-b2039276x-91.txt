ESPAGNOL OR BROWN SAUCE. Si well-tinned stewpan holding eight quarts, rub about a quarter of a pound of butter over the bottom and place three slices of cut ham on the butter; cut the veal in slices, place these on the ham, and on these the beef, also cut in slices; add half a pint of water, and take care the cover of the stewpan fits tightly. Cover the stewpan and place on a red-hot part of the hot plate to what we call run down, which means, when the juice has come out of the meat and has run down to a kind of glaze and is nice and brown (be very careful not to burn it, to prevent which you must be very attentive.) It will take about one hour and a half to run down, when lift the lid and scrape off with an iron spoon a little from the bottom. If it has run down sufficiently you can readily do this; and by examining it, you can see how it is progressing and guard accordingly; when brown enough, take about five quarts of cold water, beat one white of egg into this and pour over the meat in the stewpan which you have been running down. Bring to boil as quickly as you can and well skim the same, adding one good-sized carrot, two medium size onions, and one small head of celery. Let boil as gently as possible for six hours. Then take a couple of pounds of butter, place it to slowly melt on the hot plate; when melted thoroughly, strain off the pure butter, leaving the sediment behind; strain it (the pure butter) into a two-quart stewpan and stir in sufficient flour to make a thickish kind of paste (say as thick as peas-pudding when the peas have been well mashed), and let this slowly cook on a cool part of the hot plate, or that part which is not too hot, for about half an hour, stirring the same with a wooden spoon frequently; G

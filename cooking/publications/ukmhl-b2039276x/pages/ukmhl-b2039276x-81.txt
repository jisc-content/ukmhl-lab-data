MINCED MUTTON AU GRATIN. 71 mix these together, seasoning the same with a little cayenne pepper and salt. Place a little more than half a pint of brown sauce in a stewpan, let boil till reduced one-third, having, when placing on the fire to boil, added two ounces of good glaze. When the sauce is ready, add your minced mutton, chopped mushrooms and chopped parsley, taking care the parsley has been previously dipped in boiling- water for a minute; when all are mixed nicely together, place in the larder or upon some ice to get cold. Then make half a pound of short paste, that is, half a pound of flour and three ounces of butter rubbed into the same, and mix with a little water into a rather stiff paste; cut this into a circular piece of paste after rolling out to a quarter of an inch in thickness; prick this with a fork over the surface and then bake the sameâ€”(half a pound of flour should make two). Then make the half of a half-quartern loaf into bread-crumbs, not using the crust; and now, if your minced mutton is quite firm, build this up into a sugar-loaf shape upon your round of short paste; smooth it nicely with a knife, dipping the same in hot water; when smooth, take one yolk of egg and one whole egg, add a little salt and mix well together, and with your egg-brush eizg over the surface of your pile of mutton, and well cover the same with bread-crumbs, patting the same with your hands and putting on as much as possible. Some give two coats of bread-crumbs to this dish, and I think it is best to do so; following the same plan as the first. Next dip a clean brush into some clarified butter, and run a little over the surface that has been coated with bread- crumbs, and place the same in a moderately-heated oven till it becomes a light yold colour, when pour round

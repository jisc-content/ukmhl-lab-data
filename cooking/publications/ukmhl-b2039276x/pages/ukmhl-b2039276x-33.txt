CREME OF PARTRIDGES A LA MODERNE. 23 cloves, and vegetables, and even eschalots to stew with the sauce; but for myself I prefer the natural flavour of the pheasant, and only use a little salt and cayenne pepper. In all ehand froids and salmis it will be well to use a little aspic in the sauce, and even to dip each piece in liquid aspic after it has been dipped in sauce and is cold. 29. Curry of Partridges, Made and served exactly the same as Curry of Pheasants. Be particular not to use too much curry powder, keeping the sauce of a mild soft flavour, unless your patrons prefer it otherwise, as some do. 30. Salmi of Partridges. The same as Salmi of Pheasants. (See No. 26.) 31. Quenelle of Partridges. Made the same as Quenelles of Fowl. (See No. 7.) 32. Fritot of Crgme of Partridges. The same as Fritot of Creme of Fowl. (See No. 3.) 33.

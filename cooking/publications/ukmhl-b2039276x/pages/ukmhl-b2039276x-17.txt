QUENELLES OF FOWL. 7 white part of a head of celery; cover with water and let boil slowly for three hours, skimming the same when it boils. Proceed to make a little panada in the following man- ner: place half-a-pint of white broth, or stock, in a two- quart stewpan, and put three ounces of fresh butter in this, and place on a hot-plate to boil; meantime weigh five ounces of the finest flour yon have (the finer the better), and sift the same through a flour sieve on to a piece of white paper, and when the white stock boils, with the butter in it, then stir in the flour; work it well over the fire till it will not stick to the finger when you touch it, and when you think the flour is sufficiently dressed (which will take about three minules), stir into this four yolks of eggs, stirrine acrain over the fire for a few minutes, when, with a wooden spoon, remove the same on to a china plate, covering it with a piece of buttered paper. Then thorovghhi pound your chicken in a clean marble mortar till very line, using a few spoonfuls of cream as vou do so; when very fine rub it through a wire sieve (kept in most kitchens for this purpose).

Having passed all through the sieve place the same on the scale and weigh it, and to each half pound of meat use four ounces of the panada you previously mnde and three ounces of butt' r; place these in the mortar and pound them altogether, adding a little salt and cayenne pepper. "When well pounded together, add two or three yolks of eggs and stir these well

61 SALADE OF LOBSTER A LA FRANCAISE. Now take the rough pieces from the plate, chop these up, adding a little oil and vinegar from the jar. Then take one of the silver dishes and press the salad evenly down in the centre of the dish, adding a little more small salad and lettuce if needed, and round this arrange the remainder of the cucumber, somewhat in the same manner as you placed it round one of the silver dishes, each piece slightly over- lapping the other. Next place the rough pieces of lobster in a pile in the centre, and round this commence to dish your lobster, using two of the tails first, letting one piece overlap the other till you have made several tiers, and using the rough pieces as you proceed, and also a little small salad. "When you think you have used half your lobster on one dish, finish the top neatly and roll into a ball a little small salad and place this on the top. Finish the other dish in the same way. A short time before serving, strain the remainder of the oil and vinegar into a basin, taste it and make it to your palate, adding a little cayenne pepper; then, with a table- spoon (silver or plated), place this dressing over the two salads, beginning at the top of each and sprinkling the coral which you have prepared over each. After which, put your mayonnaise sauce into two boats and send to 1 able with the lobster salads: one boat should be placed by the side of each. Note.—According to the old style, a Lobster Salad k la Franchise was prepared as I have here described it; but many cooks of the present time use mayonnaise sauce with a lobster salad,—hence my reason for sending mayonnaise iu boats. A little mayonnaise sauce is also used in building up the lobster.

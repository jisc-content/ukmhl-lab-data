Now roll out your puff-paste (the same kind as you used for the maids of honour) a little thicker than a halfpenny; the paste should be rolled out very even and level, and prove sufficient to cover over the whole of the baking sheet; then press it down tightly all round on the border where you put the yolks of eggs, and with your knife cut off the surplus paste round the edge of the baking sheet; then egg with yolk of eggs the whole surface on the baking sheet, dipping your brush iato water and mixing the yolks (by dipping your brush in a little water you can give a smooth surface or eco- all over the paste); when you have done so, with the back of your knife mark out the surface into oblona squares of three inches in length and one inch wide Â°in the centre of each make a little wreath with ihe point of your small knife, and bake in an oven not too hot. When done, a little pounded sugar should be sprinkled through the sugar dredger over the surface,

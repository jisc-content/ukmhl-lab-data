Then add your vegetables (after the lamb has stewed one hour), a little pepper and salt, and one half pint of good brown sauce, or failing this a little "ood gravy, and failing this a little more water; then thicken with a little roux or corn-flour, add a little colouring and boil slowly for another half hour. About one pint of sauce should be sufficient. I may add that this dish is generally served en famille, more than for company. 43. Breast of Lamb en Fritot Sauce Tomato.

Place these in a two-quart stewpan with about a pint and a half of water; stew or let simmer very gently for an hour and a half, then place in a kitchen basin and let remain till quite cold (if till the following day all the better).

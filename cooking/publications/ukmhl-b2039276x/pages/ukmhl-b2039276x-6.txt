iv PREFACE. with favour, in another edition the work could readily be enlarged. I offer on the following pages a selection of my numerous testimonials to show that it is a cook who has written this work—most cookery books being, I find, merely collections by the uninitiated in the art of cookery. And further let me add, Doctor Johnson once made a promise that lie would write a cookery book on philosophical principles; but what the learned Doctor failed to do the humble author of this slight brochure claims to have accomplished, not only on philosophical but philanthropical principles also; for never did invalid or dyspeptic have so many delicate dainties offered to their notice. As proof of what I state, let me refer them to the Cremes of Fowl, Cremes of Pheasants, Cremes of Lamb, Cremes of Beef, &c, and the variety offered in each instance; and again in the preparation of Beef-Tea, Mutton-Broth, and Chicken- Broth ; then again to Calf s-Foot Jelly, which, if made on the principle here evolved, contains for the invalid a world of good in itself, and I may add it is the same with every dish here offered. The epicure and the invalid are equally provided for; and I can only plead in conclusion, to test what I say,—partake of what is here offered, and I feel assured you will say the little work has been truly written on philosophical principles !

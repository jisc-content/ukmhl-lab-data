SAVOURY, OR ASPIC JELLY. 91 carrots, one head of celery, a dozen sprays of green thyme, and twenty-four sprays of parsley. Tie these last two items into a bouquet, place all in the stewpan, and then let your stock boil very gently for six hours; then strain it off through a soup-cloth, taking care that you have previously skimmed off any fat showing on the top of the same.

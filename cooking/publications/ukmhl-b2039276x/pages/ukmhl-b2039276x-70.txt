6c SALADE OF LOBSTER A LA FRANCAISE. towards you. Now take half your peeled cucumber, which should be even in shape, or made so with your small knife, and cut into pieces about the size and thickness of a half- penny. Place these uniformly round the outside of the eggs, overlapping each other slightly; then mix some of your small salad and lettuce together, and place these in the centre of the eggs, pressing the same down lightly, which should when finished be about one inch and a half thick ; on this place a little sliced beetroot. Finish your other dish or plate in a similar manner, placing the quarters of eggs evenly and touching each other round the inside of the dish. Then take your other half of cucumber, splitting it in two lengthways, cutting one half of this into thin slices about as thick as a sixpence, and place a slice next to each piece of eggâ€”they will look best if placed in a slanting direction uniformly between the pieces of egg all round the dish; then add salad as in the other "dish. Now take your lobsters out of the oil and vinegar, dry them with a cloth somewhat damp, and cut up the four tails, beginning at the end which was broken off the body; cut off the rough parts and cut the slices in a slanting direction, placing these on a china dish as you do them, letting each piece overlap the other as you place them on this dish. Next proceed to cut the claws into scollops of about the same size as those cut from the tads, placing any odd or rough pieces on a plate. When all the lobsters have been cut up and are arranged on the china dish mix the oil and vinegar in which the lobsters were placed well together, and put a little of this over the picees of lobster thus arranged ; do not put too much, but enough to nicely flavour and season the same.

2 CREME OF FOWL A LA MODERNE. a quenelle sieve; when the whole is. passed, place it back in the mortar, and then keep adding a little cream, about one gill or less at a time, and stir this into the fowl by rubbing the pestle round and round till yeu see that the fowl-meat and the cream blend nicely together; continue this opera- tion till you have used all or nearly all the cream. Then butter a plain dariole mould, or plain mould that holds a gill, and place about half a tablespoonful into the same to test it; then place a small stewpan on the hot-plate with about one gill of water, let it boil and place the dariole mould in this, having previously screwed a piece of clean white paper over the same; let it slowly simmer till the creme of fowl is set, that is to say, till it feels somewhat firm to the touchâ€”say as firm as quenelle, or a baked custard, but you must be very particular on this point: if you think it too firm, add a little more cream, but not too much, as you want it to turn out of the mould nicely and by no means to break, which would quite spoil them, and render all your labour abortive. Having now tested and found to your satisfaction, the next operation is to place the mixture in two plain cylinder moulds, which should be nicely buttered with clarified butter, and then ornamented with truffles according to your fancy. Sometimes the truffles are merely chopped fine and sprinkled into the mould, and sometimes a little chopped tongue is used, or a little ham will do for tins purpose. The moulds should hold about one-and-a-half pint each. Pill the moulds carefully with a silver spoon, and twist round the top, as it shows to you, a piece of buttered paper; then fold a sheet of paper several times and place it in a

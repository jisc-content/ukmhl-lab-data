SAUTE OF SHEEP'S KIDNEYS A L'lTALIAN. 41 55. Creme of Mutton a la Moderne. Take a loin of mutton with a fine fillet in the same; cut off the chump end, which will enable you to cut off the upper and undei fillets from the chine bone j then cut off all the meat from the chump, free these from fat or skin, and proceed exactly the same as for Creme of Fowl a la Moderne (see No. 1), either making them in two moulds or in sufficient dariole moulds to form two dishes (sixteen dariole moulds would do). Garnish with peas, or beans, or macedoine roots, and serve with an espagnol sauce or a bechamel sauce. 56. Saute" of Sheep's Kidneys a l'ltalian. Take sixteen sheep kidneys, skin them and cut them in two lengthways, and saute" them in a little clarified butter, having previously examined the same to see if they are of good quality. Then place them in a two-quart stewpan, add half a pint of espagnol sauce and half a pint of best stock; let them boil, and then very gently simmer for one hour, adding some muslirooin liquor and two glasses of Madeira wine. When nearly ready add the following: Chop a half-handful of parsley very fine mixed with a little green thyme, scald these, and add them to the kidneys. Next chop six fitie mushrooms—which should be dressed—add these also, then place a border of potato croquettes round the two entree dishes, and place the kidneys in the centre; serve very hot, pouring the sauce over them; the potato croquettes should be pre- pared the same as in No. 53.

DIPLOMATIQUE PUDDING. have been previously on the ice to get cold ; turn the mould round and round in your hands so as nicely to coat or chemise the mould with jelly; then orna- ment the same with preserved cherries, angelica, and chopped pistachio nuts, adding a little more jelly to fix your ornamental work as you. proceed. When your mould is ornamented, cut up, say three apricots, three slices of pine apple, and two dozen cherries which have been preserved; then take six sponge cakes, cut them in two lengthways, and spread a little apricot jam between each, cutting each into four pieces ; now examine your custard, and if satisfied with its con. sistence, place it on the hot plate for a minute or two, so as to have it of about the consistence of double cream; then sprinkle a little of your fruit at the bottom, and over the same place the sponge cakes which you have cut up; add a few ratafias, and pour over these about a gill of your prepared custard, taking care your mould is surrounded with ice ; when the custard is firmly set, proceed with another layer the same as the first, and so on till the mould is full. Serve the following sauce : boil a pot of currant jelly in an equal quantity of water very slowly, and when the jelly is dissolved, place a few stoned cherries (fresh or preserved) in the same, and put them to get cold on the ice; turn your pudding out of the mould the same as you would a mould of jelly by dipping the same in warm water, and pour the sauce round the base and serve. We shall now give a few Hot Cakes, which will be found most excellent removes, and which can be served hot in winter and cold in summer.

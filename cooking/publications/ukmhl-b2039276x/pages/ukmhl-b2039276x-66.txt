Dish the trout on an ornamental border of aspic jelly, place a little lettuce cut very fine in the centre, and on this your tartarre sauce; also a few croutons of aspic jelly round the base of the border, and some chopped very fine between each crouton. A. little tarragon and chervil can also be placed round the base of the border; and you can, if you please, dish them without the aid of aspic borders on the plain silver plate or dish, putting a little chopped aspic and using a few croutons of aspic as your fancy may direct round the salad. Note—Ornamental rice borders, about one inch high, are sometimes used to dish all kinds of cold entrees upon ; and in the full summer season they are preferable to aspic jelly borders,—as the aspic jelly is apt to become clammy; and I am bound to say, when properly prepared, they look extremely well. Be sure to use a little sliced cucumber in dishing this cold entiee, also a little oil and vinegar mixed in equal proportions and seasoned.

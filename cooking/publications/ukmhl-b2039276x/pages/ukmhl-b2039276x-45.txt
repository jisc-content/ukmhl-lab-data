Obtain the fillet of beef from a rump of beef (or two from two rumpsi, cut them into sixteen scollops of equal size, and pat them very gently with your cutlet chopper, irimming them neatly; then mark them in two cutlet pans with a little clarified butter under them, and with your butter brush place a little over the fillets also. After which prepare a sauce as follows: Open a tin of mush- rooms and put them into about a pint of brown sauce, and let boil for about half an hour, when the sauce should be of its original consistency; skim nicely and add a little pepper and salt, and place both in the larder till needed. The fillets of beef should be dressed over a sharp fire, and when done drain off the fat, add a little sauce and seasoning; dish on a border of mashed potatoes, place the mushrooms in the centre and pour sauce round the same and a little over them; serve very hot, and do not commence to cook them until a short time before dinner. Note.—And if time, make your sauce from the trim- mings of your two fillets with sufficient stock for the two entrees, adding an onion and a part of a carrot cut fine, taking care to use the juice from the mushrooms in the sauce, glazing the scollops if you like.

calf's-foot jelly. 88 hail- sieve. The feet will require watching a little, and if a little more water requires adding do so, and this is more than likely,—your guide should be to keep the feet covered with water about one inch. The stock, as it is termed, that comes from the feet should be placed where it will soon get cold. Six feet should make about five quarts of good stock, that is to say, a stock nice and stiff. The next day make as much jelly as you need, proceeding as follows: With an iron spoon remove the oil that settles on the top of the stock, then wash the same with warm water, and be most attentive in removing every particle of oil, using several waters. When quite clean, place two quarts of the first stock that you strained off in a stewpan, and with your smallest size cooking knife (made very sharp) peel very thin nine lemons, taking care to smell the same before peeling them—for you will find lemons sometimes as musty as musty eggs; and if so, would spoil your jelly. Care should be taken, when peeling or chipping the lemons, not to cut off any of the white part, which you will find has a bitter taste; let the peel drop into half a pint of syrup, which should be in a small kitchen pan by your side; when the nine lemons are peeled cut them in two lengthways and squeeze them into a pointed sieve, letting the same run into the basin containing the lemon peel and syrup; add these to your calf's-foot stock, adding a few coriander seeds, one piece of cinnamon about three inches long, four cloves and one pound of lump sugar; place your stewpan containing these ingredients on the fire, and when a little warm, crack eight nice fresh eggs into a basin, adding the shells also; add one gill of water to these, beat well together and mix with your warm

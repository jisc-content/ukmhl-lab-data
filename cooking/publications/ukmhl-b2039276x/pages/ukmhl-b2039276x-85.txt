RISSOLES OF FOWL A LA REINE. 75 reduced, strain it into a basin and place your fowl and toneue in this, taking care that it is not sloppy, or m other words, that there is only sufficient sauce to cause the fowl and tongue to adhere together, and to appear when cold nice and firm. Now take some trimmings of puff-paste, such as the remains of vol au vents or patty cases; add a handful of flour to this and roll the flour into it, which wdl take two or three rolls; when smooth, roll it out as thin as a bronze penny and as square as possible, and cut it into pieces three inches square; then take two yolks of eggs, add a few drops of water to these, and with your egg- brush lightly touch with the yolks of eggs the surface of the square pieces of paste before you; then mould with a dessertspoon the chicken and tongue into round pieces about the size of a walnut, placing each piece near the outer edge, so that the other part will overlap or cover that part where the chicken and tongue is; close the edges thoroughly, and then cut them into half circles with a patty cutter, taking care they are not too large. Then egg the upper surface and cover this with fresh-made bread- crumbs : some use broken vermicelli for this purpose, but bread-crumbs are best; fry them, when needed, in clean hogs' lard, taking care the same is not too hot, and fry them of a light gold colour, and be careful the paste, is well cooked. When finished, pick a handful of parsley from the stalks and dip it in water, taking care to squeeze all the water from the same, and place the same in a frying basket and then into the fat you have been using, and fry the same, taking care it is crisp before taking it from the fat. Garnish with this, and dish on a napkin. N0te.â€”Rissoles can be made from any kind of butcher's

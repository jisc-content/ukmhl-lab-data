BOMBS OF FAT LIVERS A L'AMBROSIA. 45 Now, you must give great attention to what is in the dariole mould, which, when set, should be really very firm, and if not so take a little of the gelatine you have in soak (say about one ounce), melt this and make it warm, and add to the bechamel sauce with the aspic jelly in it, and try it again in another dariole mould. When quite sure it is nice and firm, remelt that which you have in the dariole mould, and add it to what you first prepared; place it on the ice for a minute or two, and stir it gently to and fro with a small wooden spoon, and when it is beginning to set take a dessert-fork and place each bomb upon this on the flattened side or base. Then carefully dip each one into the sauce, let pait run off, and when nicely masked place them upon a clean dish, and keep masking others as quickly as possible. If you find your sauce too stiff, place the stewpan on the hot plate for a moment, which will soon cause its contents to partially melt ; then use your judgment, and bring the same again to the proper masking point, making use of the ice to aid you if you need it. I am bound to admit that this little matter of mashing requires great attention, but after a little practice there is not the least difficulty in the matter. When all are masked they should be very slightly ornamented with truffles, or simply chop three or four truffles rather fine and sprinkle over the top surface of each bomb. They should be kept as you dip them upon pounded ice, and for this purpose you should have a square tin dish of pounded ice by your side ; the best utensils you can use are saute plate pans, as they are ready conductors of the cold arising from the iceâ€”I mean to place the bombs upon.

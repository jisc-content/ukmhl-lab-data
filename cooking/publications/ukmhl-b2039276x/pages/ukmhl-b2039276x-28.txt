When done, place them on a separate tin and pour the bones, stock and vegetables into a stewpan, adding sufficient good stock to make a good sauce, which let simmer for another half hour; strain it off and mix into a sauce which, when finished, will make about three-parts of a pint of good sauce; add a little more wine if needed. Serve with a garniture of mushrooms or truffles, or a la Financiere, or with young peas, or asparagus points. A white sauce is sometimes used.

They should be dished on a border of quenelle or well-made mashed potatoes, the same as cutlets. The same can be served as a cold entree, which indeed it frequently is. The quails are then prepared as follows: the sauce should be nearly cold, and then should have a little melted aspic poured into the same, and when proper for masking dip each half of quail into this, and when quite cold dish them on chopped aspic jelly with croutons of aspic jelly round the quails and the garniture in the centre.

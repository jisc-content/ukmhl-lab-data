4.8 BOMBS OF FOWL A LA REINE. melted, and also a little aspic jelly; add enough to make the same, quite firm when coldâ€”about one pint and a half will be enough. Take about half a pint of this and place in the three chickens which you have cut up, also the tongue, truffles, and mushrooms, mix well together in a two-quart stewpan, and place this on the ice to become quite cold and firm; when so, make into balls the same size as for the Bombs a 1'Ambrosia, and when these have become quite firm, which they will soon do by placing them on the ice, take your other pint of sauce, giving strict attention to it that it will be quite firm when set, and prepare the same for mashing, dipping what you have prepared one at a time into the sauce and placing them neatly in your saute pan. You will require twenty- four, and let me add you will find your right hand the best and handiest means of dipping the bombs in the sauce. When your sauce is ready, dip them as quickly as you can; and should your sauce become set before you have finished them place the stewpan containing the same on the hot plate for a minute or two, then work your sauce rapidly for about the same time, and place it on the ice for a second or two, when you will be enabled again to proceed and finish the same. As you mask them, a few truffles chopped fine should be sprinkled over each one. They should be kept in ice as you do them, and when all are done take your small knife and remove any superfluous sauce that may be round the base, and finish each one by dipping the same in melted aspic jelly, and again place them on clean saute pans. They should be dished on silver plates in a pile, like cannon shot, with chopped aspic jelly round them and a few croutons cut from aspic jelly on

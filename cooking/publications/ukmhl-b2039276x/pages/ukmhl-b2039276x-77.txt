CREME OF VEAL AND FOWL A LA BONNE FEMME. 67 manner as the Creuie of Fowl a la Moderne, taking two very fine and large fowls, and a pound and a half of slices of veal (nice white veal). When prepared, take a medium size copper baking sheet well tinned; butter this and then line the sheet with paper, spreading it evenly over the surface of the baking sheet, and butter this also; and on this spread the crSme of fowl and veal (as evenly as possible) and of about the thickness of an old penny piece; then butter another sheet of paper and place this evenly over the top, and with a butter-brush sprinkle a little water all over the surface, and place in a rather sharp oven to set (about five minutes should do this). When it feels quite firm to the touch it will do; and let me here remark, all care should be taken to make it so. When cold cut it out into cutlet-shaped pieces, in fact with the same kind of cutter that is used for cutting into shape fillets of chicken, or of a cutter of the shape here shown Q which should be about three inches long and about one inch and a half wide in the centre. There should be twenty scollops, and as you cut them out arrange them neatly on a saute pan; then cut from a dressed tongue twenty scollops of the size of a two- shilling piece; place these also on another saute* pan, and mark them as thus far ready for use; and let me add, the trimmings from the fowl and from the slices of veal should as soon as possible have been placed on the fire} covered with cold water, and made to boil, nicely skimmed, and a little sliced carrot, onion, and celery, also a bouquet of parsley and green thyme placed in the same. Let me also add, the carcase of the fowl should be chopped up rather small, so as the more readily to extract the flavour from it.

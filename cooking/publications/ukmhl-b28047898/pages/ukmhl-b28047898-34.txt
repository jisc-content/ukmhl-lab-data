Make a good sweet milk and egg custard, and in it soalc some moderately thick slices of stale liread, and fry in “ ghee ’’ or butter to a light brown. Make a syrup of lemon juice and sugar; serve with the “ fry,” grating a little nutmeg and sifting a little white sugar over the whole. CoCOanut Pudding.—In n pie-dish mix half a pound of grated cocoanut; the same weight of white sifted sugar; two tablespooiifuls of fresh butter ; the whites of three or four eggs, whisked ; a tablespoonful of brandy, and a teaspoonful of either orange or rosewater. Bake in a moderate oven. Plantain or Banana Pudding.—In hot ashes roast a dozen of the fruit in their skins ; then peel and cut them in slices; add sugar to taste; lialf a wine-glass of lemon juice, a little lemon peel finely chopped, a glass of sherry, a few cloves, and a lump of butter. Confine this in ordinary pudding paste and boil. To be served with ri’i'am.

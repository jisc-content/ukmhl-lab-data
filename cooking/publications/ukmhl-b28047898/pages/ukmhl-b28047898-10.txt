ANGLO-INDIAN COOKERY. 2 window when feasible, that objectionable feature of English domestic life, to wit, the “smell of dinner,” will be ap])reciably ameliorated. To those of ns who have a weakness for the soft fresh bread of the Indian “ Eoti Walli,” the dryasdust London jirticle is an infliction. I find the only way to keep l)read from drying up altogether is to deposit it in an earthen }>an and cover the mouth with a clean damp cloth of several folds. Though butter, lard, and drij)ping are substitutes for “ ghee,” still, for Indian cookery there is nothing like this last. I intend giving a recipe for the making of “ghee,” and I very strongly advise its adoption when making up anything from this little book. The English servant, I find, is open to instruction. Ours, a raw country Essex girl, has learnt to boil rice as well as any old “ Thnnnikurchi ” or cook-boy out there, and I am hopeful of being able to entrust her with curries, &c., at no very distant date. Patience is a virtue and—everything.

•29 SWl^JETS. Cocoanut Tablots.—Extract the milk from two cocoa- nuts, and l)oil it to a syrup with two pounds of moist sugar. Scrape two more cocoanuts, which add to the syrup; also a pound of “ kussa-kussa,” or poppy-seed. Keep on a slow tire, till you find the mixture harden on being dropped in water. Butter a shallow tin, pour into it, and, before it cools, divide it off into squares with a knife. “Ulva” or “Hfflwa.” —Take a pound of “ soojee,” or semolina, and, with a little water, work it well, and set it by for the night. In the morning pour a little warm water on the mass, mash thoroughly with a strong wooden spoon, strain through a coarse cloth, and let the milk-like liquid thus extracted stand for half the day. Kow, with a spoon, carefully remove any clear water you may find standing.-on the surface of the extract. Have ready a teacupful of almond paste (make it yourself), two pounds of sugar, one pound of “ ghee ” or butter, and a phial of strong rose water (not “utthur” of roses). Melt the butter in a stewpan, pour in the “ soojee ” or semolina extract, keep it on a gentle fire, and stir constantly for five minutes. Now add the sugar, and continue boiling and stirring for another five minutes, when put in the almond paste, and go on boiling till the mass becomes translucent, assaying frequently, until you find that a small portion of the mixture, cooled on a plate, does not adhere to the knife when cut, this being a sign that it is done. When about half cooked, add the rose water to taste. (Some people prefer a few drops of rose essence, obtainable at the chemist.) Pour into small saucers, well buttered, and, when cool, wrap in tissue paper, ]<eeping iu a dry place.

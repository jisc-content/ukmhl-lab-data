PREFACE. Inasmuch as the demand for books on Anglo-Indian cookery and housekeeping still exists, in spite of the many excellent works already published on these subjects, I am induced to compile this little volume with a hope that it may prove acceptable to those Anglo-Indian ladies who are not too proud to sTipplement their experience with mine. It is my endeavour, therefore, to give in these pages the result of knowledge gained during twenty-three years of married life in India, and which, I sincerely trust, may be of service to those who, having finally quitted the East, may still hanker, now and again, after the fleshpots of the land of their exile. As I have resided in various j)arts of India, I submit I am in a position to strike a fair average, whereby my wrinkles and recipes may be acceptable to those whose lots may erewhile have been cast anywhere from Peshawur to Cape Comorin; from Kurrachee to Calcutta. My aim being to supply a cookery book for “ Old Indians ” in England, I have not, as a rule, given vernacular terms, weights, or quantities, endeavouring to adapt my instructions to the conditions ruling here, which ar(> somewhat different to those olffaining out yonder. I could give many more recipes on all culinary subjects

BY LEWIS CLEMENT, “ WiLDFOWLER.” Opinions of the Press. “An excellent work indeed, and full of capital illustrations, is ‘Modern Wildfowling; ’ to recommend it aright I should have, if I were clever enough, and it did not already exist, to invent the famous phrase, ‘ a book no gentleman’s library should be without.’ ’’—Truth, March 17,1881. “ This book deals not only with the various modes of approaching, or decoying, and killing wildfowl of all kinds, hut enters into minute details upon the construc- tion of punts, both single and double handed; sails; punt guns, muzzle-loading as well as breechloading; recoil apparatus; and shoulder guns of all patterns, with the varying loads required for different bores. In addition to this are several chapters devoted to a narration of the adventures of the author while in pursuit of wildfowl, both at home and abroad—which are very pleasant reading With the addition of a good index, sportsmen vEill have in this work a capital vacle nieci/m on the art of wildfowling.”—The Zodogist for November, 1880.

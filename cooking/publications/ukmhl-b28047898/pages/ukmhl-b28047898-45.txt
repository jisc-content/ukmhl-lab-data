37 PICKLES. PICKLES. Indian Onion Pickle.—Take two pounds of small white onions (the size of cherries), strip off the outer skins, and '])ut into a wide-mouthed jar with two tablespoonfuls of salt; place in the sun for a week, daily removing any water that may be secreted. Now add an ounce of sliced green ginger, two whole garlics, two table spoonfuls of moist sugar, and fill up with vinegar. Again place out in the sun, when you will find the onions to eat short and crisp, and be far preferable to the English-made article. Lime or Lemon Pickle.—Take two dozen limes or one dozen lemons; cut in four, but not quite through; intro- duce salt into the cuts, place on a flat dish, and set out in the sun for ten days. In an enamelled pan mix a table- spoonful of mustard seed, ditto of cummin seed, a quart of salad oil, and a quart of vinegar. Then throw in the fruit, two tablespoonfuls of sugar and chillie powder to taste. Stir and boil till the fruit is tender, and bottle when cool. Mango Pickle in Oil.—Take a dozen green mangoes, free of “ string ” and turpentine. Peel, stone, and cut in four. Place on a flat dish, plentifully sprinkle with salt.

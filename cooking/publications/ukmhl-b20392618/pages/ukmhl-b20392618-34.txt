THE invalid's OWN BOOK. 10 FLAVOUEED SODA WATER. Put into a tumbler glass some of the syrup made from any of the recipes for "Syrups" in this book, and pour on it a bottle of soda water. This is a convenient beverage, as the flavour can be varied so many ways. —♦— FRENCH BARLEY WATER. Take tAVO ounces of pearl barley, and boil it in half a gallon of water until tender, taking oflf the scum as it rises. Strain it through a fine sieve ; sweeten to the taste. Lemon-peel can be added, as also the juice of orange, lemon, or any other fruit. The remaining barley boiled to paste is also good. RICE WATER. Boil gently until quite soft in a quart of water three ounces of whole rice. Skim it as it boils. When the rice is as soft as paste, take it from the fire, and strain it through a fine hair sieve or cloth. Sweeten it to the taste with sugar or honey, which latter is the best in cases of colds; when a few apples boiled in it, or lemon-juice added, is an improvement. Rice water plain and iced is a valuable and agreeable drink in cases of diarrhoea.

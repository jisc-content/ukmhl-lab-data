THE invalid's OWN BOOK. SYRUP OF SAFFRON. Unravel half an ounce of English saffron, and put it into a pint of water or very light wine. Cover it, and let it stand near a fire, to be very hot, without boiling, for twelve hours. Strain off the liquor, and boil it with three pounds of loaf sugar until it is a rich syrup, keeping it well skimmed. When cold, bottle and cork it tio-ht. SYRUP OF LEMONS. Make a rich syrup with sugar and water; add the juice and rind of lemons to the taste whilst simmering; keep it skimmed. Bottle and cork it. It is better made fresh. It must be strained. SYRUP OF ORANGES. Make a rich syrup; add the juice of oranges and a small portion of the peel: a little of the peel of the Seville orange is an improvement. Strain it, and when cold bottle and cork it. —f-— Syrups can be made with the juice of any fruits in the same way as directed for mulberry syrup.

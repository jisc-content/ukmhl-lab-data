BROTHS. 79 SIPPETS. When the stomach cannot bear meat, toast some slices of bread, lay them on a hot plate, and pour hot meat gravy upon them. Add salt to the taste. MAEROW TOAST. Boiled marrow spread upon toast with a little salt added. This has never been known to fail in allaying vomiting proceeding from irritation after an emetic, or from other causes. And the effect is the same upon animals of the dog and cat speciesâ€”only given without the toast; but melted and poured down the throat when just warm, in the quantity of about half a tea-spoonful. SAVOURY RICE. Boil rice very light, as directed, and add some good meat gravy, warming all together. Add salt, and serve it hot. SAVOURY MACCARONI Boil maccaroni as directed, and add gravy the same as you would do to the savoury rice.

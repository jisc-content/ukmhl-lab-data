MEATS. 93 slightly skewer it, and put vegetables round it, tied on. Eoast it for two hours and twenty minutes; before it is done, remove the paper, so as to brown it. Serve it with any kind of plain vegetable. OX-TONGUE PICKLED. Set it on the fire in two gallons of cold water; when it boils, only simmer it for three hours; but the best way is to try with a fork if it is quite tender. A dried tongue requires at least to soak twenty-four hours before it is boiled. Before it is served, skin it. A tongue is best for an invahd fresh out of pickle. MEAT SANDWICHES. Grate some tongue, or meat that has been either roasted or boiled, and make it into sand- wiches of thin bread and butter, neatly cut. Mustard may be added, if allowed. EISH SANDWICHES Are made in the same manner, of any previously cooked fish grated, or in thin slices.

32 THE invalid's own BOOK. TREACLE WHEY. Add a large spoonful of treacle to a pint of boiling new milk or buttermilk (the latter is the best); add a sprig of rosemary if not disliked. When it is curdled sufficiently, strain it from the curd. J£ it is too sweet dilute it with water; but it will not curdle with a less quantity of treacle. VINEGAR WHEY. Curdle a pint of boiling milk with a small wine-glass of vinegar; then add black or red currant jelly, or a large spoonful of preserved tamarinds, or damsons. Strain off the whey from the curd. ♦ MUSTARD WHEY. Curdle half a pint of new milk by boiling in it an ounce of bruised mustard seeds. Strain off the whey, and flavour it to the taste. This is much used for dropsy. *

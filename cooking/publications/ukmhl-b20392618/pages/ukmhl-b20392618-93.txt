BROTHS. 69 F 3 BEEP TEA. Sprinkle with salt half a pound of rump steak, cut into slices, put into a large jug or basin, pour a pint of boiling water on it, and cover it; letting it stew for an hour on the hob. Put it all together into a pan, and boil it twenty minutes, and strain it. More water can be added afterwards. 4 GRAIN SOUP WITHOUT MEAT. Fry in dripping or butter some carrots, turnips, and onions cut in small pieces or dice. Add water and rice. Boil all together until the rice is quite tender, about an hour and a half. Add salt, pepper, and sweet herbs. Skim off the fat. Add some toasted bread cut in dice. FOWL TEA. Cut the skin and all the fat both outside and inside from a smali fowl after you have cut it up. Remove the liver, and the parts which adhere to the backbone. Put it into about a quart of water, with a pinch of salt, and let it stew by the fire in a covered jug from four or five hours, or more, and strain off the broth. An old fowl is the best. â™¦

SAGO (CYCAS CIRCINALIS) Is the produce of the sago palm tree of the tro- pics. It grows underneath the leaves upon the bark. It is supposed by some to be the hardened gum of the tree; but it is always found in the same granular form in which it is imported to this country. SEMOLINA Is made from the finest wheat flour. SUGAR (SACCHARUM). The sugar in general use is chiefly extracted from the sugar-cane, a plant native of the West Indies, but now introduced into other tropical climates. Sugar is also made from the extracted juice of beet-root, mangel wurzel, some species of palms, and from the maple tree. Each kind will form white or lump sugar after being sub- j ected to the necessary process.

THE invalid's OWN BOOK. EUSKS, OR TOPS AND BOTTOMS. To two eggs beaten add a pint of yeast and a little milk. Sift four pounds of flour, and set the paste to rise. Boil half a pound of butter in some milk, sufficient to make the dough stiff. Let it remain in the kneading trough till well risen. Knead it into loaves the size of small tea-cups, and bake them flat in a moderate oven. When nearly done, separate the tops from the bottoms; dry them in the oven a nice colour till crisp. BAKED CRUSTS. Pull into pieces the crumb of a new loaf. Put them in a baking plate, and set them in a mode- rate oven till crisp.

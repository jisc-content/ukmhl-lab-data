27 MILKS. APPLE MILK Is made the same way, but is improved by the addition of cinnamon or lemon-peel. BLACKBERRY MILK. Stew blackberries on a slow fire till soft. Rub them through a cullender; put the pulp back into the pan, and add gently some milk, thickened with flour and sugar. Mix all together, and sim- mer it to the consistence of porridge. ♦ ORANGE MILK, Beat three eggs with a small quantity of ca- pillaire, or orange syrup; add by degrees the juice of two large Seville oranges, and a pint of new milk cold; sweeten it to the taste, and flavour it with the rind of the oranges, which must be done very carefully, or it will be bitter. This must be made like custard, not allowed to boil, or it will curdle. ♦— FLOUR Mn.K. Rub a spoonful of flour into a few spoonfuls of milk; add more by degrees, until you have a pint; add a small pinch of salt; flavour and sweeten it to the taste.

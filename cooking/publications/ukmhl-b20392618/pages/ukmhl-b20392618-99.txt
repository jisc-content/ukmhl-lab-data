I BROTHS. 75 ESSENCE OF MEAT, OR GLAIZE. Put two pounds of meat, of any kind of bird or animal, into a bottle with neck sufficiently wide to admit it, and put it into a pan of water on the fire until it boils. Let it boil about a quarter of an hour, and strain it. If this is put into a skin, like a black pudding, it will keep a long time, and can be diluted at any time for broths, gravies, or soups. EEL BROTH. Simmer half a pound of eels with three pints of water, some parsley root or sweet herbs, peppercorns, and salt. When no more good can be obtained from the fish, strain it. Take off the fat. TENCH BROTH Is made the same way as the eel broth. They are both very nutritious. BARLEY BROTH. Wash a quarter of a pound of pearl barley, and boil it in a quart of water till it is as soft as pos- sible. Add a few sweet herbs, and a little salt. Strain it.

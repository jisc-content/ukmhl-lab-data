THE invalid's OWN BOOK. 44 FRENCH JELLIES. Let a layer of melted jelly cool in the bottom of your mould; tlien add a layer of any kind of fresh fruit, or soft dried fruit; then add an- other layer of jelly, and so on until the mould is filled. —♦— ORANGE JELLY. Make half a pint of thick syrup, to which has been added, before you set it on to boil, some lemon-peel, and peel of one or two sweet oranges, and half a Seville orange-peel; remove them before it becomes too bitter; skim it well; add the juice of six oranges, and the stock of half an ounce of isinglass or gelatine, dissolved as for other jellies. Pass it through a jelly-bag as before. In boiling jellies a small quantity of water added makes the scum rise better to skim off. LEMON JELLY Is made the same way, using the rind of a lemon peeled very thin, the juice squeezed of five large lemons, and two or three glasses of any kind of pale light wine or brandy ; and when lemons are not at hand, a few drops of essence of lemon, and a small quantity of citric acid powder, are good substitutes.

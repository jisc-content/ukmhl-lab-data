80 THE invalid's OWN BOOK. FOWL PANADA. Pound the meat of a fowl that has been boiled, but not quite done enough, in a mortar until it is in a fine paste. Add a little of the water in which it was boiled ; flavour with lemon, salt, and nut- meg, or other spice; and boil it a few minutes. —♦— CALF'S FOOT BAKED. Put two calf's feet into the oven with two pints of water, and the same quantity of new milk in a jar; cover it close, and bake it till quite soft. This is very easy of digestion.

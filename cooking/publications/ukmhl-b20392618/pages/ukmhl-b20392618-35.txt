11 WATERS. ALMOND WATEE. Blanch (that is, take the peels off) by immer- sion in hot water, five ounces of sweet almonds, and about two ounces of bitter, rather less than more. Pound them to a paste in a marble mor- tar with a little rose water, or orange-flower water, to prevent them oiling, oil of bitter almonds being poison. Make a pint and a half of syrup, to which add the almonds, and let the whole simmer very gently for twenty minutes, when strain it, and add water to the taste of the invalid, also the flavouring. —♦— ARROW-EOOT WATEE. Peel and quarter three or four apples, and boil them until soft in about a quart of water, with a little lemon-peel, or other flavour, taking care to remove it before it tastes too strong. Rub a table- spoonful of arrow-root in half a teacup of cold water until quite smooth; add by degrees another teacupful, still stirring and rubbing it with the back of the spoon; then pour it into the apple water, and let it all boil gently together a quarter of an hour. Pass it through a sieve. It can be taken either warm or cold. This drink without the apple is also good for diarrhoea.

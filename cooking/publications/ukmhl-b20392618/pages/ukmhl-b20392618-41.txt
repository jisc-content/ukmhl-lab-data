17 BEVERAGES. TREACLE BEER. Put into two quarts of boiling water one pound of treacle; stir them till well mixed; then add six or eight quarts of cold water, and a teacup- ful of yeast. Put it into a cask, cover it with a coarse cloth doubled several times, and it will be fit to drink in two or three days. It may also be bottled. After the first time of making, the bottoms of the beer will serve for yeast. If in- tended for keeping, and made in large quantities, add a handful of hops, and one of malt, and, when done working, stop it close. SODA-WATER POWDERS. One ounce of tartaric acid, one ounce of siiper- carbonate of soda in fine powder, but separately made into eighteen powders. When required, dissolve a powder of each in water, and add them together in a large glass. GINGER-BEER POWDERS Are made in the same way, adding a little powdered ginger; or the same effect is produced by addmg to the above soda-water powders when dissolved a few drops of essence of ginger. c I

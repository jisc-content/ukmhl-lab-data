Steep a pint of oatmeal in a quart of boiled milk over night. Next morning mix it with half a pound of beef suet shred fine; add salt and grated nutmeg ; add three eggs beaten, and a quarter of a pound of raisins stoned and chopped, and sugar to the taste. Tie it up, and boil it two hours, and serve with a simple sauce. —♦— PLAIN SUET PUDDING. Take six spoonfuls of flour, a pound of beef suet sliced fine, a tea-spoonful of ginger powder, a pinch of salt, and a quart of milk. Mix first, the eggs and flour with part of the milk thick, and the rest with the suet. Four eggs are an im- provement if allowed. Boil two hours, leaving the pudding room to swell in the bag, or it will be heavy. This pudding will agree when little or no other food will digest. —♦

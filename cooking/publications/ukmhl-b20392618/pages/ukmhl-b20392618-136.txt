112 THE invalid's OWN BOOK, RUM PUNCH (DUTCH RECIPE). One sour (Lemon). Two sweet (Sugar). Four strong (Rum). Eight weak (Water). ♦ EGG WINE. Add three table-spoonfuls of cold water to three eggs beaten. Put into a pan on the fire a glass and a half of wine, with some sugar and nut- meg, and when it boils pour it very slowly by degrees upon the eggs, stirring it briskly. Set it on the fire again for a minute, or a minute and a half, stirring it; but it must not boil. Take it off, and pour it from one vessel to another to froth it. Serve it in glasses^ with dry toast hot. ♦ ANOTHER May be made shortly by beating up an egg and adding a glass of wine or brandy, with sugar and nutmeg. This need not be put on a fire.

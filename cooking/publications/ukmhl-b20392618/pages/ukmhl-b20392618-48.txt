24 THE invalid's OWN BOOK. COMMON BUTTEEMILK, As churned from sour cream, is too well known to need a recipe. It is only those persons who live in the country that know the cooling and beneficial properties of buttermilk in allaying irritation in fevers, and assuaging thirst. —♦— BAELEY MILK. Rub with a spoon a small quantity of prepared barley in with a few tea-spoonfuls of new milk ; add more by degrees, and boil it till it is of a proper consistency on a slow fire; flavour and sweeten it to the taste. ♦— ISINGLASS MILK. Boil half an ounce of isinglass in a pint of new milk, with a little thin rind of lemon, or a bitter almond; strain it, and if it is too thick add more milk. Gelatine is a good substitute for isinglass. —♦— GUM-AEABIC MILK. Set some new milk to boil, and thicken it with powdered gum-arabic; flavour it with lemon-peel, or any other flavour, and sweeten it.

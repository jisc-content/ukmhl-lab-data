SOMERSETSHIRE FIRMITY. 51 SOMERSETSHIRE FIRMITY. Wash a quart of wheat, and boil it soft; add to it hj degrees two quarts of new milk, break- ing up the jelly in which the wheat is in when cold. Boil it till it is soft and mixed, and then add the yolks of a few eggs, well beaten, after cooling it. Add nutmeg, with sugar and a little ginger, if liked. Currants ought to be added, or chopped raisins; but they are omitted here as improper for invalids.

82 THE invalid's own book. WHITINGS ANOTHER WAY. Melt a small quantity of butter in a frying-pan. Flour lightly your whitings, and cook them gently in it, until they are sufficiently done. Sprinkle a little salt over them; do not let them be greasy. WHITINGS, WITH CRUIMBS. Dredge the whitings lightly with flour, then egg them with a brush, and dip them into grated bread. Fry them lightly in butter previously melted in the frying-pan, or in salad oil. SOLES OR FLOUNDERS IN CUTLETS. These may be done in any of the preceding ways; but they require rather longer time to cook. SMELTS OR SPARLINGS. Take a few large smelts, throw them into a stew-pan with a pinch of sugar, and the same of salt, with a little parsley-root or parsley. Keep them covered, and simmer them from five to ten minutes, according to the size of the smelts. The water in which they were boiled may be served with them. It should not be more than half a pint in quantity.

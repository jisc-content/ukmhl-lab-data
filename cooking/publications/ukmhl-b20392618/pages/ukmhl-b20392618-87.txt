63 PUDDINGS. VEAL SUET PUDDING. Pour two quarts of boiling milk upon the crumb of three jDenny rolls. Melt one pound of veal suet, and add that; add a few chopped raisins, and sugar to the taste, with half a nutmeg: three or four eggs may be added if allowed. Boil or bake it; if the latter, butter the dish. ANOTHER, OR DUMPLING. Make alight paste of a pint of milk, four eggs, a pound of suet, a little salt and nutmeg, two tea- spoonfuls of ginger powder, and some flour; form it into dumplings, and roll them in a little flour.

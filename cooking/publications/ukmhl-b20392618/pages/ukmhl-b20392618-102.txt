When it tastes sufficiently strong, add ' some jelly of white meat or poultry reduced. Season it to the taste, and clarify it. When you have made the aspic to your taste, add the whites of four or five eggs whisked light. Stir them on the fire constantly in the boiling aspic. When it becomes white it is near boil- ing ; cover it and set it by the side of the fire or on a stove. When it is quite clear, strain it through a jelly-bag with sweet jelly. If you wish it as jelly, and you do not find it when cold sufficiently stiff to turn out of a mould, add more calf's foot stock.

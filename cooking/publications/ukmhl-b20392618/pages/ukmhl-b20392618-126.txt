THE invalid's OWN BOOK. 102 BATH CAKES. Make the yolks of three eggs, a pint of warm milk, one spoonful of yeast, a quarter of a pound of butter, into a paste, with as much flour as will make it light; add a pinch of salt, and, if ap- proved, a little sugar. Let it stand an hour to rise, and bake it in tins. —♦— CODDENHAM BISCUITS. Rub an ounce of butter into a pound of flour, add a little salt, and beat it half an hour very hard with a rolling-pin, or a thick piece of wood. Take off separately the dough for each biscuit, and roll them as thin as possible. Prick them. Make the tins on which they are to be baked very hot, so as to half bake them before they go into the oven. —f-— TONBKIDGE WATER CAKES. One pound of flour, half a pound of butter, half a pound of sugar, two ounces of caraway seeds. Rub the butter first well into the flour. Bake these, like the Coddenham biscuits, as thin as pos- sible, and cut them the size of a tea-cup. Prick them, and make the baking sheets quite hot, as before.

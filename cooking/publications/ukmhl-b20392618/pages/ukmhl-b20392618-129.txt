105 BISCUITS. AMERICAN BISCUITS. Mix a quarter of a pound of butter with a pound of flour, a quarter of a pound of sugar, and half a pint of new milk warmed and poured gradually in. Melt half a tea-spoonful of salt of tartar in a tea-cupful of cold water; add it to the paste, and work it well. Roll it thin, and cut out the biscuits with a wine-glass. Bake imme- diately in a quick oven. —♦—- POTATO BISCUITS. Make a pound of flour into a paste, with half a pound of boiled potatoes rubbed through a sieve or cullender, a pinch of salt, and as much butter as will enable you to roll the paste out into rounds the size of a large saucer; and bake in a brisk oven. ♦ PATIENCE BISCUITS. Whip the whites of six eggs; add eight ounces of powdered sugar, and ten ounces of flour, and a lemon-peel rasped. Mix all with a wooden spoon. Slightly wax some baking sheets, and drop on the mixture in drops the size of a shilling when the tins are quite hot. Bake them in a brisk oven.

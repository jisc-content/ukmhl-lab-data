PLAIN COOKERY RECIPES. 88 Ground Rice Pudding. One and a half ounces ground rice. One pint milk. One or two eggs. Few drops of essence (lemon or vanilla). One ounce sugar. Break the ground rice to a smooth paste with a little of the milk. Boil the rest of the milk in a saucepan, then pour the boiling milk on to the ground rice. Put the milk and rice into a rinsed pan, bring to the boil, and cook about five minutes. Remove from the fire, add the sugar, and let the mixture cool a little. Beat the eggs, add the yolks to the rice, and mix well. Beat up the whites of the eggs stiffly, then mix lightly and thoroughly with the other ingredi- ents. Turn into a greased pie-dish, and bake in a moderate oven for about twenty minutes. Farola, Cornflour, Arrowroot* Prepare and cook in the same way as Ground Rice Pud- ding, using farola, cornflour, or arrowroot instead of ground rice. Barley Pudding* Three-quarters ounce barley. Half a pint milk. One egg. Half an ounce soft sugar. Wash the barley ; let it soak all night in cold water. Put it into a pan with the milk and sugar; simmer till quite soft (from half an hour to three-quarters of an hour). Break the egg, and beat it slightly with a fork in a pie-dish; add the barley and milk, stirring well together. Brown in an oven or before the fire.

BREAD, CAKES, BISCUITS Bread. To make a quartern loaf— Three and a half pounds flour. To every pound of flour one teaspoonful salt. One teaspoonful castor sugar. One and a half pints tepid water. One ounce yeast. Sieve the flour and salt into a large warm bowl. Cream the yeast and sugar together with a wooden spoon until liquid, and add the tepid water. Make a well in the centre of the flour, and strain in the yeast and water. Sprinkle a little of the flour over, cover the basin with a cloth, and set to rise in a warm place for twenty minutes till the surface is covered with bubbles. This is called “ setting the sponge.” Work in all the flour with the hand, adding more tepid water if necessary to make a firm, elastic dough, and knead thoroughly. Cover again with a cloth, and set to rise in a warm place for two hours. When well risen, knead the dough lightly on a floured board, and form into loaves. Put in a warm place to prove for fifteen minutes; then bake in a hot oven for thirty minutes to one hour, according to size of loaf. When ready, the bread will be well risen, will feel light, and when tapped underneath will sound hollow.

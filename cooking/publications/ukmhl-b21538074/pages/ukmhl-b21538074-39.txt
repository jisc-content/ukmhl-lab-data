MEAT. Roast Beef or Mutton, Beef or mutton for roasting should be well-hung from four to six days in summer, and from two to three weeks in dry, cold weather. Wipe, trim, and weigh the meat, and place it best side down in the roasting-tin. Place two or three tablespoonfuls of dripping on the meat, and in the under division of the tin put cold water to keep the heat of the oven moist. Put the meat into a hot oven at first; after it begins to brown the heat may be reduced and the cooking continued at a slower rate. Baste every fifteen to twenty minutes; and after the meat is half-cooked turn it, with the best side up. The time for cooking depends on the weight of the meat, twenty minutes for each pound and twenty minutes over being usually allowed. For a small roast of two or three pounds longer time in proportion is given. A roast of this size takes from one and a half to two hours. Dish on a suitable ashet, and serve with the usual accompaniments : with roast beef—gravy, Yorkshire pudding, horse-radish sauce; with roast mutton—gravy, baked potatoes, red-currant jelly. To make Gravy.—After dishing the roast, pour all the jclear dripping from the tin, keeping back all the brown sediment. To this add pinches of salt and pepper, and half a pint of good brown stock or water. Stir it over the fire till boiling, then strain it into a gravy dish or round the roast.

PLAIN COOKERY RECIPES. iSo Stewed Sweetbread. One heart sweetbread. Half a pint white stock or milk. One tablespoonful cream. One dessertspoonful arrow* root. Pepper and salt. Few drops of lemon juice. Soak the sweetbread in cold water and a little salt for one hour, then blanch it. Lift the sweetbread into a bowl of cold water, and with the fingers pull away any fat or gristle. Tie it into a piece of muslin, place in a stewpan, and cover with hot stock or milk. Simmer gently for one hour. When the sweetbread feels tender lift it on to a square of toast and keep it hot. Break the arrowroot to a smooth paste with a little cold stock, strain it into the stock in the pan, bring to the boil, and cook from four to five minutes. Add the cream, season nicely, and pour the sauce over the sweetbread. Invalid Fruit Tart. One penny sponge cake. One egg. One teaspoonful castor sugar. One gill milk. One large apple. Two tablespoonfuls water. One dessertspoonful sugar. Boil the two tablespoonfuls of water with the dessert- spoonful of sugar for five minutes, then put in the peeled and sliced apple. Cook till tender. Beat the apple smooth, and put it at the bottom of a greased pie-dish. Cut the sponge cake into thin slices, and place these on the stewed apple. Beat up the egg, add the teaspoonful of castor sugar and the milk, and pour over the sponge cake. Let the pudding stand for a few minutes, then bake in a moderate oven for about fifteen or twenty minutes until the custard is set.

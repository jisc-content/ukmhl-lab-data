MEAT. 6 or three minutes. Turn the mixture into the prepared tin; cover with a greased paper; bake in a steady oven for about thirty minutes. Turn the gateau on to a hot dish, and pour round brown or tomato sauce. Cold Meat Shape. Quarter-pound cold chicken veal, rabbit, or beef. One hard-boiled egg. One white and shell of egg. One teaspoonful chopped parsley. Three gills of stock. Half an ounce gelatine. Pepper and salt. Put the well-skimmed stock, gelatine, white and shell of egg into a saucepan. Stir over the fire until the gelatine is dissolved, then whisk until nearly boiling. Stop whisking and boil up the stock well. Let it settle a few minutes, then strain through muslin, and let it cool. Boil the egg hard, then cut into fancy shapes. Chop the parsley finely. Re- move any skin, fat, or gristle from the meat, and cut it into small dice. Rinse a plain tin with cold water, then cover the bottom of the tin with a little of the cold stock. When this is set, decorate with some pieces of egg and a little parsley. Cover the decoration with some stock, and let it set Mix the meat, seasonings, the rest of the parsley and egg chopped roughly, and put these ingredients into the tin. Fill to the top with the rest of the stock. Put in a cool place until set. Dip the tin through warm water; turn the shape on to a dish. Garnish with parsley, and serve. Note.â€”If the stock is jellied, the gelatine can be omitted. Shepherd's Pie. Haifa pound cold cooked meat. One small cooked onion. Half an ounce dripping. Quarter-ounce flour. One gill stock or water. One pound cooked potatoes. One tablespoonful milk. Pepper and salt.

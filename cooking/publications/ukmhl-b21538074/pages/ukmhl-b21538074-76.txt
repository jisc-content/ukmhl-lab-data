PLAIN COOKERY RECIPES. 72 Crush the potatoes first with a fork and then with a large wooden spoon, to be sure that no lumps remain. Add the butter, milk, salt, and pepper, and mash well in an iron pan over the fire till the butter has melted and mixed with the potatoes. Arrange neatly on a dish. Note.â€”Mashed potatoes are finest when made with freshly- boiled potatoes, still hot. New Potatoes* Potatoes. | Boiling water. One teaspoonful salt to one quart water. Cleanse and prepare the potatoes (see page 71). Place them in enough boiling water to cover them, and add the salt. Boil briskly for about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour till soft. Then dry at the side of the fire, as described for old potatoes. Steamed Potatoes* Scrub and peel the potatoes. Put them in a steamer, sprinkle with salt, cover with a lid, and place the steamer over a pan of boiling water, and cook the potatoes till tender. Potato Chips. Two or three potatoes. | Pan of deep fat. Scrub and peel the potatoes, and cut them into very thin slices. Keep for half an hour in cold water. Drain well on a cloth and dry. Have the fat smoking hot. Put the chips into a frying basket and cook till tender (about three min- utes). Lift up the basket and let the fat reheat for a few seconds. Put the potatoes into the fat again for a few seconds until they are crisp and brown. Drain thoroughly on paper.

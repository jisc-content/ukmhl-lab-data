PUDDINGS AND SWEET DISHES. 99 Vanilla Souffle One ounce butter. One ounce flour. One gill milk. One dessertspoonful of castor sugar. A little vanilla essence. Three yolks and four whites of eggs. Tie a fourfold band of paper round the outside of a plain souffle tin. The paper should be about three inches wide, and should be about two inches above the top of the souffle tin. Then grease both the tin and the paper with clarified butter. Separate the yolks from the whites of the eggs, and whip the whites very stiffly. Melt the butter in a saucepan. Add the flour and the milk, and stir briskly until the mix- ture is thick and leaves the sides of the pan clean. This sauce is called a panada. Add the sugar and the yolks one by one to the panada and beat well. Flavour with vanilla essence, then fold the stiffly-beaten whites into the mixture. Pour into the tin; cover with the greased paper; steam very gently for about forty minutes, or until the souffle feels firm to the touch. When cooked, lift the tin from the pan, take off the band of paper, let the souffle stand for a few seconds, then turn it carefully on to a hot dish. Pour round a custard or jam sauce. Marmalade and Vermicelli Pudding. Three ounces vermicelli. Three-quarters of a pint milk. Two small eggs. One tablespoonful marmalade. One ounce raisins. One ounce sugar. Cook the vermicelli and milk until tender (about twenty minutes); add the stoned raisins, beaten eggs, sugar, and marmalade. Turn into a greased bowl; cover with greased paper; steam gently about an hour. Turn out the pudding, and pour over marmalade sauce.

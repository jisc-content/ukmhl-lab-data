PUDDINGS AND SWEET DISHES, ioi Baked Lemon Podding. Trimmings of rough puff or short crust pastry. Three ounces castor sugar. Three eggs. Two lemons. Three ounces cake crumbs. Half a gill milk. Line and decorate the edges of a pie-dish with the pastry. Mix the yolks of the eggs and the sugar well, then add the sieved cake crumbs, the grated lemon rind, and the strained lemon juice. Whip the whites of the eggs very stiffly, and mix lightly with the other ingredients. Pour the mixture into the prepared pie-dish, and bake in a moderate oven for about forty minutes. General Favourite* Two sponge cakes. A little jam. Two eggs. One dessertspoonful sugar. Half a pint milk. Vanilla essence. Split the sponge cakes and spread them with jam. Cut them into neat pieces, and put them into a greased pie-dish. Beat up the yolks of the eggs with the sugar, and pour over them the hot milk. Strain the custard over the sponge cakes, place the pie-dish in a Yorkshire tin, and surround the dish with water: this is to prevent the custard boiling and curdling. Bake the pudding in a cool oven until the custard is set (about thirty minutes); then take the pudding out of the oven. Whip up the whites of the eggs stiffly, add to them very lightly two tablespoonfuls of castor sugar, place the meringue on the pudding, dredge with sugar, and put the pudding into a cool oven to set the white of egg. It will take about thirty minutes.

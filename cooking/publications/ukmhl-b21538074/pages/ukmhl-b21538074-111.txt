PUDDINGS AND SWEET DISHES. 107 Cornflour Shape* Two ounces cornflour. One dessertspoonful sugar. One pint milk. Flavouring. Put the milk into a rinsed pan to heat.

Add the sugar and flavouring, and turn into a wet china mould. When cold and firm turn out. Note.â€”The above proportions are used in making shapes of all farinaceous materials.

One pint milk. Two small eggs. One ounce castor sugar. Heat the milk, then sprinkle in the rice, and stir over the fire until the rice is cooked.

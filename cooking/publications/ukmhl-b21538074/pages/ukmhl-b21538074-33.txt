Place the plate over a pan containing boiling water, and put the lid over the plate. Cook in this way for about twenty minutes, till the fish is firm and white. Dish neatly on a small ashet, and pour the liquid over. Note.—If not for an invalid, the fillets may be dished with a good fish sauce poured over. Fried Herrings, Two herrings. | One ounce oatmeal. One ounce dripping. Cleanse and dry the herrings, cut off their fins, toss the herrings in the oatmeal in a sheet of kitchen paper till as much as possible has stuck to them. Heat the dripping in a frying-pan; fry the herrings for about five minutes. Note.—If desired, the herrings may be boned (see Baked Herring, page 30) and fried. Grilled Herring or Mackerel, One herring or mackerel. Half an ounce dripping or butter. Four sprigs of parsley. One pinch of salt. One pinch of pepper. Open the fish by cutting it down the front. Wash it well in cold water, and dry it with a cloth. Rub a hot gridiron with a greased paper, and lay the fish on it over a clear fire; when brown on one side turn over on the other. Wash the parsley in cold water, pick it off the stalks, dry it with a cloth, chop finely; mix with the butter on a plate, using a knife; add to it the salt and pepper. Put the fish on a hot plate, and spread the butter on the fish. Any other fish may be cooked in the same way with or without the parsley and butter.

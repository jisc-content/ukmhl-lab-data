147 SICK-ROOM COOKERY. Fish Souffle Four ounces of uncooked fish (cod, haddock, or whiting). One ounce flour. Half an ounce butter. Two small eggs. Half a gill of fish stock or milk. Half a gill cream. Pepper and salt. Squeeze of lemon juice. Wipe the fish and chop it finely. Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the flour and fish stock or milk, and cook until the sauce is thick. Pound the fish, the sauce, and the eggs in a mortar; then rub through a fine sieve. Season well, add the cream, and pour the mixture into a buttered souffle tin. Cover with a buttered paper, and steam very gently for about three-quarters of an hour. When firm, turn the souffle on to a hot dish, and coat it with a fish sauce. Mutton Chop Steamed* One mutton chop. Pinch of salt. A little butter. Choose a loin chop cut from well-hung mutton, wipe it, trim away most of the fat, and make it a good shape. Place the chop in a greased plate, cover it with greased paper and a pan lid. Put the plate over a stewpan of boiling water. Keep the water underneath fast boiling that there may be sufficient steam, and if it boils away add more. Cook the chop for about forty minutes, and turn it once while cooking. Serve the chop on a hot dish, and pour over it any juice that has run from it while cooking. Note.â€”Fillet of sole or whiting can be cooked in the same way. They will take from twenty to thirty minutes, and when done the fish looks quite white and loses its trans- parent appearance. Breasts of chicken and game can also be steamed. Time varies according to the thickness of the meat.

85 PASTRY, Flaky Pastry* Three-quarters pound flour. Pinch of salt. Half-pound butter. Cold water to bind. Wash the butter, dry it well in a floured cloth, and divide it into three equal-sized pieces. Sieve the flour and salt into a basin, and mix to an elastic dough with cold water; knead this till smooth on a floured board, and roll out into a strip. Take one portion of butter and spread it in small pats equally over two-thirds of the dough, fold in three, seal the edges, and turn the rough edges to the right hand. Roll out, and add second and third portions of butter in same way, then roll the pastry to the size required.

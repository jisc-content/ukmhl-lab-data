To every quart of soup break one ounce cornflour to a smooth paste with a little stock or sherry. Strain into the boiling soup, cook for five minutes, and serve. Gravy Soup. One pound lean juicy beef. One quart cold water. Blocks of carrot and turnip. One stick of celery. Pepper and salt. One ounce dripping. One ounce flour. One teaspoonful ketchup. Wipe the meat, and cut it down into small pieces; put it into a saucepan with the water and salt; bring it slowly to the boil, and skim. Add the vegetables and pepper, and simmer slowly for two hours. Strain through a hair sieve; when cool free from fat. Melt the butter, add the flour, and brown them carefully. Add the stock by degrees, boil well, and add the ketchup at the last. Giblet Three sets of giblets (either duck or chicken). One ounce ham. One carrot, turnip, and onion. Two sticks of celery. Soup.

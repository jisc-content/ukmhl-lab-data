One dessertspoonful sugar. Vanilla essence. Grease a pudding-bowl, and decorate with the prepared sultanas or raisins. Cut the bread and butter into small pieces, and put them into the bowl. Add the sugar and the rest of the sultanas. Beat up the eggs; add the hot milk and vanilla. Strain over the bread. Cover the pudding-bowl with buttered paper, and let it stand for fifteen minutes, so that the bread may swell and absorb some of the milk.

When cooked, turn the pudding on to a hot dish, and pour round custard sauce.

SOUPS. I5 Kidney Soup. One ox-kidney. Two ounces dripping. Two ounces flour. One quart stock. One quart water. Half a turnip. One carrot. One onion. One bunch of herbs (compris- ing a sprig of thyme, mar- joram, and parsley, and one bay leaf). One blade of mace. Half a teaspoonful of black peppercorns. Salt. Remove the skin, wash and dry the kidney, cut it in small pieces, keeping back all the core. Skin and scald the onion; dry and cut it in thin rings. Make the dripping smoking hot in a large deep pan; toss the kidney lightly in the flour, and fry to a good brown colour. Lift the pieces out, and fry the onion and remaining flour till well browned. Put back the pieces of kidney; add the stock, water, and salt; bring slowly to the boil, and skim carefully. Prepare the carrot and turnip; cut them in blocks; add to the soup with the herbs and the peppercorns; simmer for four or five hours. Strain through a sieve, and when cold remove all fat. Return the soup to the pan ; rinse the pieces of kidney, and add them to the soup. When hot serve in a tureen. Note.â€”Half an ox-kidney or three sheep-kidneys make one quart of soup. Ox-Tail Soup is made in the same way, but the tail must be jointed, freed from superfluous fat, blanched, and dried before frying. Serve pieces of tail and rounds of cooked carrot in the soup.

VEGETABLES AND SALADS, VEGETABLES. Potatoes Boiled in their Jackets. Scrub well, place in an iron pan with enough of water to cover them, and the salt (one teaspoonful to each quart of water). Bring to the boil, and boil slowly for about twenty minutes; try with a fork if they are soft. If so, pour away all the water; lift the lid partly off to allow the steam to escape. Place the pan beside the fire till the potatoes are dry, shaking it occasionally to prevent them from sticking to the pan. Remove the skins. Serve hot. Boiled Potatoes. Scrub well, and pare very thinly. Proceed as in the previous recipe. Baked Potatoes. Wash, wipe, and dry the potatoes. Place them in the oven. Turn occasionally, that they may be equally cooked. They are ready when they feel soft, and generally take about one and a half to two hours. Serve very hot. Mashed Potatoes. One pound boiled potatoes. Half a gill milk. Half an ounce butter. A small pinch of pepper. Half a teaspoonful salt.

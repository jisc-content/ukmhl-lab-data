PRELIMINARY. 8 esteemed, and for cutlets the best end of the neck is the most suitable. Excellent stew can be made from cheaper cuts—example, scrag end neck of mutton. Veal, being immature meat, must be eaten fresh, and it must also be thoroughly cooked. The best cut is the fillet. This is used for cutlets or for roasting, and though expensive it is economical, as there is little waste. The breast, neck, and shoulder are excellent for stews, and the head and knuckle are unequalled for stock. Lamb, like veal, is immature, therefore it must be well cooked. When it first comes into season, about February, it is divided into the forequarter, which includes the shoulder, ribs, and neck; and the hindquarter, which includes the leg and the loin. At this season lamb is expensive; later in the year it is divided into joints in the same way as mutton. Pork should be chosen with care. Nowadays, owing to the strict inspection of food, it is usually quite safe, and forms a pleasant variety in diet. Pork should never be eaten in summer. The leg and loin are suitable cuts for roasting, the legs are often salted for hams, and the sides for bacon. Pig’s head is excellent for brawn. Poultry.—Chickens and young fowls should be chosen for roasting, and older fowls are suitable for boiling. A young fowl should have a plump breast, soft legs, and pliable feet. Poultry is valuable as a food, as it gives variety in the diet, and is a nourishing and easily-digested form of animal food. Ducks are less digestible than chickens; the same points should be observed in their choice as in the choice of fowls. Fish*—Signs by which the freshness of fish can be ascer- tained are: (i) a fresh smell, (2) the flesh firm, (3) the eyes bright, (4) the gills red. 1.

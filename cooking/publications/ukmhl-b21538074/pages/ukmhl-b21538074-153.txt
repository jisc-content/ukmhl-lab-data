SICK-ROOM COOKERY, 149 Veal Quenelles. Four ounces of veal. Quarter of an ounce butter. Half an ounce flour. Half an egg. Pepper and salt. Quarter of a gill of stock. Remove all skin from the veal, cut it small, and pass twice through a mincing machine. Melt the butter in a sauce- pan, add the flour and stock, and cool until thick. Pound the veal, sauce, and half an egg in a mortar; then rub it through a fine wire sieve. Season well. Form into quenelles, using a dessert spoon. Put the quenelles into a greased frying- pan; pour into the pan sufficient boiling water almost to cover them. Put a buttered paper over, and poach gently for about twenty minutes, basting them occasionally. When firm, drain the quenelles on a cloth and dish them on a round of toasted bread. Garnish with parsley, and serve. Note.—Beef, mutton, or chicken quenelles may be made by the above recipe. Stewed One pigeon trussed for roast- ing. Half an ounce butter. Pigeon. Three gills hot brown stock. One teaspoonful arrowroot. Pepper and salt. Make the butter smoking hot and brown the pigeon in it, then pour over it the hot stock. Cook the pigeon very gently till tender (from one to one and a half hours). When cooked, serve the pigeon on hot dish and keep hot. Break the arrow- root to a smooth paste with a little cold water; add it to the stock. Stir till boiling, and cook thoroughly. Season well, and strain the sauce over the pigeon. Note.—Partridge can be prepared in the same way.

PLAIN COOKERY RECIPES. SOUPS. First Stock* This is the liquid in which fresh meat, bones, and vegetables have been cooked. First stock may be :— (a) BROWN STOCK. Two pounds shin or shoulder of beef. Small carrot. Small onion. Ten white peppercorns. Stick of celery, or one half- teaspoonful of celery seeds tied in muslin. Half a teaspoonful of salt. Two quarts of cold water. Measure the water into a strong pan; add salt. Wipe and cut the meat into small pieces, removing fat and skin, and add to the water. Scrape the bone well, remove the marrow, wash to remove fat, and put into the pan. Bring the stock slowly to boiling-point—about three-quarters of an hour. Remove any gray-looking scum; add the prepared vegetables cut into large pieces. Simmer the stock from three to four hours. Strain through a hair sieve. When cold skim thor- oughly. The stock is then ready for soups, etc. (b) WHITE STOCK. Proportion and preparation the same as for brown stock, only use knuckle of veal or bones and trimmings of chickens or rabbits instead of beef. For white stock omit the carrot.

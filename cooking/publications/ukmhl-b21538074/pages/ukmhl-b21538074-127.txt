BREAD, CAKES, BISCUITS. 123 Vienna Bread. One pound flour. One teaspoonful salt. One ounce butter. Half an ounce yeast. Half a pint milk. One egg. One teaspoonful castor sugar. Sieve flour and salt into a bowl, and rub in the butter. Cream the yeast and sugar until liquid. Add the tepid milk, and strain it into the middle of the flour; strain in also the beaten egg. Mix together to a smooth dough. Cover with a cloth, and put in a warm place till well risen (about one hour). Form into fancy shapes, place on a greased baking- sheet, and prove for about fifteen minutes. Bake in a quick oven for about twenty to thirty minutes. Brush over with clarified butter. Plain Plum Cake. Half-pound flour. Quarter-pound butter. Quarter-pound sugar. One teaspoonful of baking- powder. Half a teaspoonful allspice. Two ounces Valencia raisins. Two ounces currants. Two ounces peel. Two eggs. A little milk. Sieve the flour. Clean and prepare the fruit, and mix with it the spice and one teaspoonful of flour. Cream the butter and sugar; add the flour and the eggs by degrees, beating thoroughly. Add the fruit and the baking-powder mixed with the last spoonful of flour. The mixture should be of a consistency to drop easily from the spoon, so if necessary add a little milk. Turn into a prepared cake-tin. Place in a hot oven till risen. Moderate the heat, and bake steadily for about one and a half hours.

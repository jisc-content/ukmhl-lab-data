PLAIN COOKERY RECIPES. 30 Baked Herring. Two fresh herrings. Say one gill water. Say one gill vinegar. Six peppercorns. One blade of mace. Quarter teaspoonful salt. Cleanse and dry the herrings; cut off the heads, tails, and fins. Cut from the opening already made for cleaning down to the tail end; lay them on their backs, remove the bones; sprinkle the salt over them; roll them up, beginning at the tail end. Place them in a small pie-dish, with the pepper- corns and mace; pour over them enough vinegar and water to cover them ; bake in the oven for three-quarters of an hour. To Coat. Beaten egg, bread crumbs, and deep fat. Remove all skin and bones from the fish, and break it with two forks into small pieces. Mash the potatoes and mix with the fish; season well. Melt the butter in a small pan; add the fish and potatoes. Mix well together, and add sufficient egg to bind together. If any cold fish sauce can be had, it may be used in place of egg. Turn the mixture on to a slightly floured board and form into small cakes. Coat with egg and bread crumbs, place in a frying basket, and fry in deep fat till of a golden brown colour. Drain carefully, and dish on an ashet with a dish paper. Garnish with fried parsley. (See Fried Fish, page 27.) Fish Cakes. Half a pound cold fish. One ounce butter. Quarter a pound cold potatoes.

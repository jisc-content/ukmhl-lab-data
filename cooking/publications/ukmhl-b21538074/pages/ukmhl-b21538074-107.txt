PUDDINGS AND SWEET DISHES. 103 and the sugar well; add the eggs by degrees with the almonds, crumbs, the grated rind, and strained juice of lemon. Mix all the ingredients well. Spread the mixture over the jam; bake in a moderate oven for about an hour. Apple Fritters. Two apples. Batter. Two ounces flour. Pinch of salt. One tablespoonful salad oil. Sufficient tepid water to make the flour into a stiff batter. Stiffly-beaten white of one egg. Fat for frying the fritters. Sieve the flour and salt into a bowl. Make a well in the centre, and put in the salad oil; then with a wooden spoon stir in tepid water till a rather stiff batter is made. Beat well, and let it stand for about an hour. Peel the apples thinly, then cut them into slices, cutting across the core of the apple; with a small cutter remove the core from the slices of apple. Whip up the white of egg stiffly; mix it lightly into the prepared batter. Dip each slice of apple through the batter, then put them carefully into a pan of hot clarified fat. Fry the fritters to a golden brown, drain well, dust with castor sugar, and serve at once. The fat for frying batter should just be beginning to smoke, but should not be so hot as for frying fish, etc. Pancakes. Four ounces flour; pinch of salt. One egg. Half a pint of milk. For frying the pancakes about two tablespoonfuls of clari- fied fat. Sieve the flour and salt into a bowl. Make a well in the centre; drop in the egg and half the milk. Stir until smooth,

SICK-ROOM COOKERY. Ordinary Beef-tea* One pint cold water to one pound lean beef. For a small quantity, one quarter-pound beef, one gill water. Remove all the skin and fat; shred the meat, put it into a thick jar, basin, or jug; pour the cold water over it, stir, cover it tightly with a lid or with paper; let it stand half an hour. Place it (still covered) in a pan of cold water (to come half-way up the jar). Simmer this for two or three hours, then pour the beef-tea off. Remove any fat floating on it by passing small pieces of kitchen paper or blotting- paper lightly over it. If not wanted immediately, let it cool, and warm as much as is wanted at a time, as beef-tea spoils when kept warm. If salt is permitted by the doctor, add it when the beef and water are set to stand for half an hour. A larger quantity of meat takes longer in proportion to cook. Newly-killed beef is the best for beef-tea, as it contains more juice than beef that has been kept. After the beef-tea is made do not throw the meat away; it may be used for various cheap dishes for which chopped meat is wanted, or it may be added to the stockpot. Quickly made Beef-tea* One pound lean beef. One pint cold water. Pinch of salt. Wipe and scrape down the beef, and allow it to stand in the water as for ordinary beef-tea; then turn it into a pan,

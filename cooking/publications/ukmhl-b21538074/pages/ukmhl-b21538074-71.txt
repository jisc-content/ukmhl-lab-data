SAUCES. 67 Bread Sauce* Half an ounce butter. One gill freshly-made bread crumbs. Half a pint milk. One small onion. Two cloves. Six peppercorns. Put the milk, peppercorns, and onion stuck with cloves into a saucepan, and infuse at the side of the fire for fifteen minutes, then strain. Return the seasoned milk to the pan with the butter and bread crumbs. Stir till boiling and of a dropping con- sistency. Onion Sauce. One and a half ounces butter. One and a half ounces flour. Three gills meat boilings. One gill milk. Three onions. Pepper and salt. Skin the onions and boil till soft, drain, and rub through a sieve or chop finely. Prepare sauce in the same way as a white sauce; add the chopped onions. Tomato Sauce. Half an ounce butter. Half an ounce rice flour. Half a pint second stock or liquor from tinned toma- toes. One onion. Small piece of carrot. One ounce bacon. Four or five tomatoes. Pepper and salt. Prepare onion and carrot, and cut into slices. Put butter and bacon into a saucepan, and fry slightly. Add onion and carrot, then the tomatoes; bruise down with a spoon, and reduce the sauce for four or five minutes. This improves the flavour and colour. Stir in the rice flour, add the stock. Boil up, and skim if necessary. Season with salt and pepper.

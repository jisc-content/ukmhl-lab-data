FISH ■■ ■ »■ To boil Fish* Clean the fish thoroughly, removing scales, fins, tail, and eyes, handling it as little and as quickly as possible. Have sufficient water in a fish kettle to cover the fish ; add salt and vinegar to it in the proportion of one teaspoonful of salt and one teaspoonful of vinegar to one quart of water. When this is boiling put in the fish, draw the pan to the side of the fire, and cook the fish very gently without boiling. For a large fish, or a large cut of fish, allow ten minutes to each pound and ten minutes over. Cook a small fish till the flesh is firm and will leave the bone quite clean. Drain the fish on a draining-tray, or on a fish slice, dish on a folded napkin, and decorate with half-slices of lemon and sprigs of parsley. Serve with a sauce. Stuffed and Baked Cod. One pound slice of cod. Stuffing. Two tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs. One tablespoonful of chopped suet. Half a teaspoonful of chopped parsley. Pinch of powdered herbs. A little grated lemon rind. Pepper and salt. Beaten egg to bind.

59 MEAT. Mince. Half-pound cooked meat. Pepper and salt. About one gill heated stock. One teaspoonful ketchup or Harvey’s sauce. Fried sippets of bread. Remove skin and fat from the meat, and cut it into dice. Put it into a saucepan with the stock and seasonings, and allow it to reheat very thoroughly. Dish, and garnish with the fried bread. Note.—Mince is greatly improved by serving poached eggs laid on the top. Croquettes. Half-pound cooked meat. Half-ounce dripping. Half-ounce flour. One gill second stock. One teaspoonful of chopped parsley. One teaspoonful ketchup or Harvey’s sauce. Pepper and salt. To Coat the Croquettes. One beaten egg. Bundle of stale bread crumbs. Free the meat from fat and skin, and chop it finely. Chop the parsley. Make a sauce of the dripping, flour, and stock \ add to it the meat, parsley, and seasonings, and turn the mixture on to a plate to cool. When cold and firm divide into equal-sized portions, and form into round balls. Brush with beaten egg. Toss in the bread crumbs, and fry to a golden brown in smoking-hot fat. Dish, and garnish with fried parsley. (See Fried Fish, page 27.) Cold Meat Cutlets. Proportions and preparation of the mixture the same as for Croquettes, but form the mixture into the shape of cutlets before coating. When fried, serve on a small border of potato, and pour round brown or tomato sauce.

MEAT. 63 Potted Meat. Six ounces cooked meat. Four ounces clarified butter. Pinches of salt and pepper. Powdered allspice. Nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves. Put the butter into a saucepan over the fire; cook until a scum rises. Draw the pan from the fire. Skim the butter well, strain through muslin, and keep back any sediment. (The butter is clarified to remove the salt.) Remove all fat, skin, and gristle from the meat, and pass it twice through the mincing machine. Then pound the meat, seasoning, and two-thirds of the butter in a mortar. Place the meat into jars; make it smooth on the top. Run the rest of the clarified butter over the meat: this excludes the air. It will keep for some time. Note.—If liked, the meat can be rubbed through a wire sieve after it is pounded. Cold Meat Patties. One quarter - pound cooked meat. One quarter-ounce dripping. One quarter-ounce flour. Pepper and salt. Half a teaspoonful Harvey’s sauce. Rough puff pastry. One half-gill stock. Make the pastry. (See Rough Puff Pastry, page 82.) Remove all skin, fat, and gristle from the meat, and chop finely. Melt the dripping in a saucepan, add the flour, and cook until a good brown colour. Add the stock by degrees; season with salt. Bring to the boil, skim, and cook for a few minutes. Add the Harvey’s sauce and the prepared meat. Turn on to a plate to cool. Roll out the pastry to about one-eighth of an inch in thick- ness, and cut some rounds from it. Line eight patty-pans

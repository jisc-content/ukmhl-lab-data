PLAIN COOKERY RECIPES. x4 Second or Household Stock. Put the bones and meat from which first stock has been made into the stockpot. Cover with the same quantity of water; add half a teaspoonful of salt; bring to boiling-point and skim. Add pieces of fresh carrot, onion, turnip, and celery, and let the stock simmer. Into the household stock may be put trimmings of cooked or uncooked meat and poultry, and bones, which should be freed from fat or sauce. No bread, green vegetables, or starchy materials should be put into the stockpot. Simmer household stock from six to seven hours, adding more water when necessary. Strain into an earthenware vessel. Keep the stock uncovered. When cold skim well, and use for soup, sauces, gravies, etc. Fish Stock. Two pennyworth of fish trim- mings. One onion. A stick of celery. Six white peppercorns. One blade of mace. Salt. One quart of cold water. Thoroughly cleanse the trimmings, and put them into a saucepan with the water and salt. Bring slowly to the boil, and skim thoroughly. Add celery, peppercorns, and mace, and allow all to simmer for forty minutes, then strain. This stock can be used for fish soup or sauce. Note.—(i.) If better stock is desired, a haddock or a cod’s head can be used instead of fish trimmings. (2.) If fish stock is cooked too long, a bitter flavour is extracted from the bones.

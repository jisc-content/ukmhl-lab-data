PRELIMINARY. 11 Let us suppose that the housekeeper has at her disposal a knuckle of ham, the remains of a joint of mutton, some gravy, some cold potatoes, a quart of milk. A wholesome meal would result if she made lentil soup, using the ham bone and the vegetables; cottage pie from the cold mutton, gravy, and potatoes; and a milk pudding. This is a very simple example of the combination and economy of food; but whether the income be large or small, the food costly or simple, there should be equal care and attention exercised, so that waste may be avoided, and that the best result for the amount of money expended may be obtained.

When sufficiently cooked, carefully peel off the skin. Put the tongue on a board, stick a skewer into the root to hold it firm, then fasten a small piece of tape across the top of the tongue to keep it a good shape. When cold, trim and brush over with liquid glaze. Put a tongue frill round the root of the tongue, and garnish with some sprigs of parsley. Wash the pig’s head in tepid water.

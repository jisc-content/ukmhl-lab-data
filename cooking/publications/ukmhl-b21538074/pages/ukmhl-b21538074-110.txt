When the apple mixture is cold, pour it into a china mould. When set, turn out. Note.—Rhubarb jelly is prepared in the same way, but use one gill of water instead of half a pint for stewing it. Coffee Jelly* Half a pint strong coffee. Half an ounce gelatine. One dessertspoonful sugar. A few drops vanilla essence. Half a gill cream; flavouring; sugar. Cherries to decorate. Make the coffee, and strain through a muslin into a sauce- pan. Add the gelatine, cut in small pieces, and stir till it dissolves; add the sugar and flavouring; strain into a basin, and set aside till almost cold. Pour into a wet border mould and leave till firm. Turn out. Whip the cream stiffly, flavour, and pile it in the centre of the mould. Decorate with cherries cut in quarters. Lemon Sponge. Two lemons. Two ounces sugar. Half an ounce gelatine. Two whites of eggs. Half a pint water. Wipe the lemons, and peel the rind off very thinly; put it, with the water, sugar, and gelatine, into a saucepan, and stir over the fire until the sugar and gelatine are dissolved; then strain into a basin. Add to this the strained juice of the lemons and the whites of eggs, and whip until stiff; then pile roughly into a glass dish. Note.—If desired, the lemon sponge can be moulded, in which case it must not be so stiffly beaten.

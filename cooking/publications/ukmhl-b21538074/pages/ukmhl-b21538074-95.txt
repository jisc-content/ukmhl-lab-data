PUDDINGS AND SWEET DISHES. 91 and milk, and stir into the dry ingredients. Pour the mixture into a greased bowl; cover with a greased paper. Put the bowl into a stewpan with enough boiling water to come half- way up the bowl, and steam one and a half hours. Turn the pudding on to a hot dish, and pour round sweet melted-butter sauce. Sir Watkin Wynne Pudding* Six ounces bread crumbs. Three ounces suet. Three ounces sugar. Two eggs. One and a half tablespoonfuls marmalade. A little milk if necessary. Make the bread crumbs; shred and chop the suet finely. Mix all the dry ingredients in a bowl. Beat up the eggs, add the marmalade, and mix the liquid with the dry ingredients. The mixture should be rather moist as the bread crumbs swell, so add milk if necessary. Turn into a greased bowl, cover with a greased paper, and steam for about one and a half hours. Turn the pudding on to a hot dish, and pour round either marmalade or sweet melted-butter sauce. Plain Suet Pudding* Six ounces flour. Two ounces bread crumbs. Pinch of salt. Half a teaspoonful baking- powder. Four ounces suet. About one gill milk. Sieve the flour, salt, and baking-powder into a bowl; make the bread crumbs; shred and chop the suet finely. Mix all the dry ingredients together, add the milk, and mix well: the mixture should drop easily from a spoon. Turn it into a greased bowl, cover with a greased paper, and steam about one and a half hours. Note.â€”This pudding may be tied in a floured cloth and boiled for about two hours.

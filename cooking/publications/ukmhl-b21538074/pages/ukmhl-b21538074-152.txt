PLAIN COOKERY RECIPES. 148 Tripe. Wash and scrape the tripe thoroughly in several waters, removing fat and all discoloured parts. Put it into a deep pan, cover with cold water, bring to the boil, and rinse thoroughly. Repeat these processes till the tripe smells sweet; then cover with water, and simmer for eight to ten hours till the tripe is tender. Stewed Tripe. Half a pound well-boiled tripe. Half an ounce butter. Quarter an ounce flour. One gill tripe liquor. One gill milk. One boiled onion. Pepper and salt. Sippets of toast. Make a white sauce with the flour, butter, milk, and tripe liquor (see page 65). Cut the tripe into neat pieces and chop the onion. Add these to the sauce, season well, and simmer very gently about twenty minutes. Serve on a hot ashet, with the sippets of toast round. One or two tea- spoonfuls of cream added to the sauce makes it more nourishing. Chicken Panada. Quarter a pound breast of chicken. One teaspoonful cold water. One or two tablespoonfuls of cream. Salt. Wipe the meat and cut it in small pieces, and put it into a small basin with the water and a pinch of salt. Cover it over with greased paper, and steam it slowly from one to one and a half hours. Then put the contents of the basin into a mortar, pound well, and rub through a fine sieve. Put the sieved mixture into a pan, add the cream, and heat thoroughly, and pile the panada on a round of toast. Garnish with a sprig of parsley, and serve.

PUDDINGS AND SWEET DISHES. 105 For making jelly choose a strong, deep pan. Rinse the pan; put in the water, sherry, rind of lemon peeled very thinly, the strained lemon juice, sugar, cloves, gelatine, and the whites and well-washed shells of eggs. Place the pan over a strong heat, and whisk the jelly until almost boiling; then draw out the whisk, and boil the jelly steadily for a few minutes. Draw the pan to the side of the stove, cover the jelly with a plate, and let it stand for eight or ten minutes. Tie a clean coarse linen cloth firmly over the legs of a kitchen chair, resting the seat of the chair on the table. Place a bowl underneath the jelly cloth, and pour through the cloth a little boiling water: this is to warm the cloth to ensure the jelly running through. Empty the water from the bowl, place it again under the cloth, and pour the jelly on to the top of the cloth. When a little jelly has run into the bowl, lift it out, and slip a clean bowl in its place. Pour the jelly gently through the cloth again. Do this until the jelly in the bowl looks quite clear. Cover the chair over with a blanket, and let all the jelly drip through the cloth. When the jelly is cold, but still liquid, pour it into a mould first rinsed with cold water, and allow the jelly to set. When firm, dip the mould quickly through warm water, and turn •out the jelly. Note.—If preferred, one quarter-pint of lemon juice and one quarter-pint sherry can be used instead of one half-pint of lemon juice. Apple Jelly* One pound apples. One to two ounces sugar. Strip of lemon rind. Half a pint water. Half an ounce gelatine. Two tablespoonfuls water. Wipe, peel, and slice the apples into a lined pan; add the sugar, lemon rind, and half a pint of water, and stew till tender; then rub through a hair sieve. Dissolve the gelatine

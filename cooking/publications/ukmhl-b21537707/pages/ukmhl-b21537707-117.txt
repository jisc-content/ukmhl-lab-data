3i Cut the meat into small pieces, wash and peel the potatoes and cut them in dice, chop the onion up finely, mix them all together on a plate, with pepper and salt, and two tablespoonfuls of cold water. Put one pound of flour into a basin, rub the dripping into it, add the baking powder and sufficient water to make it into a stiff paste. Flour a board and put the paste on it; roll it out about a quarter of an inch thick. Cut the pastry into pieces six or seven inches square, and place a little of the meat and potato and onion in the centre of each; fold the pastry over the meat. Place on a baking sheet, brush over with a beaten-up egg, and bake from half to three-quarters of an hour. This is suffi- cient to make eight pasties. Curried Rabbit. Ingredients. One Rabbit. Quarter of a pound of Fat. Two Onions. One Apple. One tablespoonful of Curry Powder. Half pint of good Stock. One Lemon. Half a teaspoonful of Salt. Put the fat into a stewpan to melt; peel and chop up the onions, and drop them into the melted fat, and fry a light brown. Wash and dry the rabbit, and cut it in pieces of an equal size. When brown, strain the onions, and put the fat back into the stewpan, and put the pieces of rabbit in to fry for ten minutes : then add the curry powder and salt, and stir well over the fire for five minutes. After that time put in the fried onions, the chopped apple, and the stock, and let the whole simmer for two hours, then stir in the lemon juice. When done, arrange the rabbit neatly, and pour the sauce round it. Serve with boiled rice. Giblet Pie. Ingredients. Two sets of Giblets. Half a pound of Steak. Three-quarters of a pound of Flour.

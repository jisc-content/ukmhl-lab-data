28 A la Mode Beef. No. 2. Ingredients. One pound of Beef pieces or Ox Cheek. Half a Cowheel. Three good sized Onions. One Carrot. A bunch of Herbs. Two tablespoonfuls of Flour. Two quarts of Water.

For the first five minutes keep the oven very hot, then open the ventilator to allow the steam to escape, or the meat will be sodden. Baste the joint and turn it over occasionally; just before serving sprinkle a little salt over the joint. Make the gravy as for roast joint (see page 37). To Boil a Joint.

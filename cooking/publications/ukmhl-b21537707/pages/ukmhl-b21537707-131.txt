Toad-in-the-hole. No. 2. Ingredients. Half pound of Flour. Two Eggs. One and a half pound of Meat. Seasoning. One pint of Milk. Put the flour into a basin, make a hole in the centre and break in the eggs, having first ascertained that they are good ; stir in smoothly half the milk, beat it well, and add the rest of the milk.

Steak and Kidney Pudding. Ingredients. Six ounces of Suet. One pound of Flour One teaspoonful of Baking Powder. Seasoning. One pound and a half of Buttock Steak. Half a pound of Bullockâ€™s Kidney. Put the flour, baking powder, salt, and the suet chopped finely into a basin; rub them well together, add enough cold water to make it a paste. Cut the steak into slices, also the kidney, and season with pepper and salt. Roll the paste out and line a basin with it, reserving a piece for the top. Place the meat and kidney in the basin, and cover with the remainder of the paste, having put in a little water; join the paste together at the edges, and trim neatly. Wring the pudding-cloth out in boiling water, and tie over the top of the basin with the four corners over the top. Put the pudding into a saucepan of boiling water, and let it boil for two hours. Turn the pudding out of the basin on to a hot dish.

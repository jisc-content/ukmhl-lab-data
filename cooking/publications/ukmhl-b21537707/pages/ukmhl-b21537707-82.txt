VI To clean a Close Kitchen Range. The blackleading and polishing of the range, cleaning the hearthstone and fender, is done exactly as for the open range. The only difference is in the position of the flues and flue doors, and there is a drawer generally under the oven, which pull out and empty of the soot that falls into it from the sweeping of the flues. To lay and light the Fire. Having cleaned and well polished your range, proceed to light the fire. Put a few of the sifted cinders on the bottom of the grate, crumple up some newspaper and put it on the cinders, lay some sticks along the paper, and some more on the top of these across them ; set light to the paper; put a few pieces of coal on the sticks, taking care to leave a good draught. When this has caught light, and burnt up a little, add more coal and cinders. To clean Gas Stoves. Lift off the steel bars, wash the stove with hot water and soda with a flannel to remove the grease; then blacklead and polish as you did the kitchen range. Clean the steel bars with emery paper, and replace them. Clean the brass taps and fittings with bath-brickdust and a leather. If there are tiles to the stove, or hot plate, wash them with a flannel, hot water, and soda, and dry them with a clean cloth. To clean an Iron Saucepan. Put the saucepan into a large tub of hot water and soda, and wash it well inside and out. Scour the inside with sand and yellow soap, rubbing well with the hand, not a flannel. When the inside is quite bright and clean, rinse the saucepan in clean hot water, and dry it with a clean cloth. Do not forget to clean the lid in the same way. To clean Tin, Iron Enamelled and Steel Stewpans. Proceed as above, only tin and steel stewpans and saucepans must be scoured bright both inside and outside; and stains must be removed from the white enamel with salt mixed with the sand. The sand used in cleaning is white or silver sand.

vii To clean a Copper Stewpan. Wash the stewpan well in hot water and soda, scour the inside well with sand and salt mixed, double the quantity of sand to salt. Soap your hand well, dip it into the sand and salt, and scour the inside of the stewpan until all the stains are removed, and it is quite bright and clean. Rinse it well in warm water, dry the inside quickly, turn the pan over, and clean the copper outside in the same way, with your hand soaped and dipped in the sand and salt. Any stains on the outside copper may be removed by rubbing it with the half of a used lemon or a little vinegar. When thoroughly bright and clean inside and out, rinse it again in warm water and dry in front of the fire. To clean Kitchen Tables, Paste Boards, and all Kitchen Wooden Goods. Wash the table over with a flannel wrung out of hot water, but on no account use any soda, as this makes the wood a dirty, bad colour. Rub some soap on your scrubbing-brush, dip it in sand, and scrub the table well, following the grain of the wood. Be sure to rinse the table very thoroughly with hot water and a flannel to wash off all the sand, or your cooking will be gritty. Dry the table well with a clean cloth. These rules apply to paste-boards and all wooden things used in the kitchen. To clean Tins. Tins that are not much used can be cleaned with whitening and a leather; but cake tins and strainers, or any tins that are greasy or burnt, should be first washed in hot water and soda, then scoured clean with sand and soap, and rinsed. When dried, they should be polished with whitening mixed to a paste with a little cold water, and rubbed up with a leather. The whitening must be carefully taken out of corners and cracks with an old plate brush.* * Note.â€”These Scullery Lessons have been written and added to this edition of my Plain Cookery Recipes, by the special request of many of our pupils.

24 LESSON IV, Boiled Potatoes. Ingredients. One pound of Potatoes (4 or 6). One quart of Water (sufficient to cover) cold. Half teaspoonful of Salt Mode of Work.—Wash, scrub, and peel the potatoes thinly; put them into cold water as peeled. Add salt to water in the saucepan, and then add potatoes. Boil gently from twenty to forty minutes, according to age and size. When soft, drain off the water and leave potatoes to dry in the saucepan on the hob for about ten minutes. N.B.—The best way to cook a potato is to boil it in its skin, peeling it carefully when it is cooked. Steamed Potatoes. Ingredients. One pound of Potatoes. One teaspoonful of Salt. Mode of Work.—Sprinkle the peeled potatoes with salt, and place in a steamer over boiling water. This way of cooking them takes rather longer than boiling. Baked Potatoes. Ingredients.

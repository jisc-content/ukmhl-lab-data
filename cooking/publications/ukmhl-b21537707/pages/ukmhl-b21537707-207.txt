7 together, and add enough milk or the egg to bind them; spread this forcemeat over the veal; roll it up and tie it round with fine string, and either bake it or roast it. The gravy for veal should be thickened with a little flour. Stewed Brisket of Beef. TO BE EATEN HOT. Ingredients. Six pounds of Brisket of Beef. Water to cover. Two Carrots. One Turnip. Three Onions. Celery leaves. One Leek. Salt. Six Cloves. Six Allspice. Twelve Peppercorns. Parsley, and a bunch of Herbs. Scrape the meat quite clean; put it into a stew-pan, with enough hot water to cover it, and a good spoonful of salt. Let it boil up and skim it well. When quite clean of scum, add onions, carrots, turnip, celery, leek, the parsley and herbs tied together, the cloves, allspice and peppercorns. As the vegetables are only for seasoning they may be cut up roughly. Let all this simmer for four or five hours. When quite tender take out the meat and remove the flat bones. Serve very hot with a cupful of the liquor poured round the beef and chopped parsley sprinkled on the top of it. Sauce for same. Half pint of the liquor strained. One ounce of Butter. Half ounce of Flour. One tablespoonful of Mushroom Ketchup. One teaspoonful of made Mustard. Four Pickled Walnuts. Chopped Parsley. Melt the butter and flour together in a stew-pan ; stir in half a pint of the liquor strained, and let this boil for ten minutes, then add the mustard, ketchup, and walnuts cut up into small pieces and a little chopped parsley. Send this sauce up very hot in a sauce-boat to be handed with the brisket of beef. The rest of the liquor can be used as soup another day, but strain it before putting it away.

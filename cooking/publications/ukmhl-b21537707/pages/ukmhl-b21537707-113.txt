2 7 Grilled Fish. Mackerel, herring, pilchards, and dried salmon are generally grilled. The gridiron bars must be greased, and the fish peppered before it is put on. When it is done a little salt, and, if liked, a little butter is put on. Salmon is sometimes wrapped in greased writing paper to broil. A slice of salmon takes a quarter of an hour to broil. Wash the ox-cheek well, rub some salt over it, and cut it up into neat pieces about one inch square ; cut the meat off the bones of the cow-heel into neat pieces. Flour the pieces of ox-cheek and fry them in three ounces of dripping in a large saucepan; slice the carrots and onions, and put them with the bunch of herbs into the saucepan; add the pieces of cow-heel and the proper quantity of water, allowing one pint of water to every pound of meat. Put two tablespoonfuls of flour into a basin, mix it to a smooth paste with a little cold water; stir the paste smoothly into the saucepan, add pepper and salt to taste.

98 Yorkshire Tea-Cakes. Ingredients. Three-quarters of a pound of Flour. One and a half gills of Milk. One ounce of Fat. One Egg. Half an ounce of German Yeast. A teaspoonful of castor Sugar. Cream the sugar and the yeast; melt the fat in a saucepan; pour the milk on to it, and make it lukewarm ; pour this on to the yeast and sugar. Pour the yeast and milk through a strainer into the flour, add the egg beaten up, and mix well together. Flour a board and turn the dough on to it, beat it, and cut it into cakes. Grease some cake-tins and put the cakes in, and stand by the fire to rise for one hour, then bake them for a quarter of an hour. SAUCES. Brown Sauce. Ingredients. One small Carrot. One Onion. One ounce of Flour. One ounce of Butter or Fat. Half pint Stock or Water. Cut up the carrot and onion into thin slices, and fry them with the flour in the butter to a nice brown. Then stir in the stock or water, and boil well for ten minutes; if you use stock, the sauce will be brown enough; but if you use water, it will require to be coloured with a little burnt sugar.

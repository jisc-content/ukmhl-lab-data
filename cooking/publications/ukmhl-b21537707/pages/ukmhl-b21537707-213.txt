13 PUDDINGS AND SWEETS. Apple Cheese. Ingredients. Two pounds of Apples. One pound of loaf Sugar. The rind and juice of a Lemon. Peel and core the apples, grate the rind of a lemon and squeeze out the juice; cut up the apples in pieces, and cook them gently with the sugar and lemon until they are quite soft, then beat them till they are quite thick and smooth. Dip a mould in cold water, pour in the apple ; when cold turn it out, and it is ready for use. Custard or cream may be eaten with it. Apples and Custard. Ingredients. Two pounds of Apples. Half a pound of loaf Sugar. For the Custard. Three Eggs. Half a pint of Milk. One ounce of Castor Sugar. A slice of Lemon Peel. Peel and core the apples; cook them with the sugar in as little water as possible. When quite cooked put them into a pie-dish and pour the custard over them uncooked, put them into the oven till the custard is quite set. Serve hot or cold, with a little grated nutmeg on the top if liked. To make the custard, beat the eggs and sugar together, then stir in the milk; a slice of thinly-cut lemon-peel should be let stand in the milk to extract the flavour.

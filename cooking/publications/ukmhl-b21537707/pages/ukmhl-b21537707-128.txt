4 2 out rather larger than the pie-dish, about one-third of an inch thick; cut a strip off and wet the edge of the dish; place the strip round the dish, wet the edge again and press the remaining piece of pastry over the pie ; trim off the rough edges with a sharp knife. Make a hole in the pie to allow the steam to escape whilst baking; ornament the top of the pie with any device you like. Bake it tor two hours, putting it into the hottest part of the oven first to make the crust light, and then putting it in a cooler part to cook the meat thoroughly. If you like a better crust, use the following :— Rough Puff. Ingredients. Eight ounces of Flour. Six ounces of Butter. Salt. Half a tablespoonful of Lemon-juice. Put the butter and flour on a paste-board, chop up the butter in the flour, heap it all up on the board, make a well in the centre, put in the lemon-juice, and sprinkle the salt over. Take a full tablespoonful of cold water, and mix it slowly and lightly with your fingers into the flour and butter, adding more water if necessary, until you get a stiff paste. Roll this out, fold it over in half, turn it with the rough edges towards you, roll it and fold it again; repeat this twice more, so that it is rolled out and folded four times in all. It is now ready for use for a meat pie, apple tart, or tartlets. Poor Man’s Goose. Ingredients. Pig’s Fry or Ox Liver. Pieces of Bacon or Pork. Two Onions, Pepper, Salt, and Sage. One pound Potatoes. A cup of Water. Place the meat, seasoned with pepper, salt, and sage in a pie dish in alternate layers with the onions and potatoes sliced, taking care that the top layer is of potato, add a cup of water and bake.

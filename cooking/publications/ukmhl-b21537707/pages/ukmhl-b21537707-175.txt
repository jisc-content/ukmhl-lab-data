89 BREAD, CAKES, AND BISCUITS. Brandy Wafers. Ingredients. Six ounces of Treacle. Three ounces of Butter. Three and a half ounces of Flour. Five ounces of Sugar. Quarter of an ounce of ground Ginger. Melt the butter and treacle together, and stir in gradually the flour, sugar, and ginger; mix well together. Grease a baking tin and drop the mixture on to it in spoonfuls a little distance apart, and bake for a quarter of an hour. Bread. Ingredients. Three and a half pounds of Flour. One ounce of Yeast. One teaspoonful of Salt. One teaspoonful of castor Sugar. Put the yeast and sugar into a basin, and cream them to- gether with a wooden spoon till liquid ; add one pint and a half of tepid water. Put the flour into a large basin, make a well in the middle, and strain the yeast and water into it. Work in a little flour from the sides, and set it down to rise. This is called “ setting the sponge.” When it has stood for twenty minutes the surface will be covered with bubbles ; take it up, and work all the flour in with your hand. When it is smooth cover it up, and set to rise for two hours. After that time take it up, and knead it on a floured board for a quarter of an hour. This quantity will make two half-quartern loaves. Divide the dough, make it into smooth balls without any cracks. If the bread is to be baked in tins flour them, put in the dough, cut or prick the top, and set to rise for half an hour. For cottage loaves, divide each piece again in two, one rather larger than the other; make each into a ball, put the small one on the top of the large, and press the forefinger into the middle of the top. Put the bread into a hot oven (280°) for a quarter of an hour and then remove it to a cooler part (220°) for an hour and a half. When done stand it on its side to cool.

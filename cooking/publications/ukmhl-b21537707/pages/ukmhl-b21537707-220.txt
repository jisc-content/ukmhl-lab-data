20 twenty minutes; when cooked stir in the jam, set it in a mould, turn out when cold, and serve with cream or custard round it. Stewed Apples. Ingredients. Six Apples. One pint of Water. One ounce of Castor Sugar. Two or three pieces of Lemon'Peel. One teaspoonful of Cochineal. Boil the water and sugar to a syrup. Take six apples of about the same size, peel them, and core them with a cutter, taking care not to split them. Put them into a casserole with the syrup, lemon-peel and cochineal; let them cook gently for eight hoursâ€” you must be very careful not to let them boil. Send them to table cold in a glass or silver dish. The apples should be whole and the syrup clear. The lemon-peel must be taken out before serving. Tapioca Cream. Ingredients. Two ounces of Tapioca. Two ounces of Castor Sugar. Two Eggs. One pint of Milk. Grated Lemon Peel. Soak the tapioca in the cold milk for six hours; stir in the sugar and boil for twenty minutes; break the eggs, separate the whites from the yolks ; beat the yolks lightly together, stir in the lemon-peel, and when the tapioca is a little cool stir them well into it. Pour this mixture into a glass dish ; whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, spread them on the top of the tapioca, and serve cold. Either rice or sago can be used instead of tapioca.

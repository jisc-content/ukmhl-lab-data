74 Ox-Foot Jelly. Ingredients. One Ox-foot. One gill of Lemon-juice. Quarter of a pound of lump Sugar. Two whites and shells of Eggs. Spices. Three Cloves. Small piece Cinnamon. The peel of one Lemon. Well wash and cut the foot into three pieces, put them into a saucepan well covered with cold water â€¢ bring to the boil, and skim. Stew gently for eight hours; strain into a basin. When the jelly is cold carefully skim off the fat; dip a cloth in hot water and wipe off every particle of fat. Put the stock into a stewpan, with the rind and the juice of the lemon, sugar, spices, whites and shells of egg. Whisk over the fire till the jelly reaches boiling point, then partly cover it with the lid, and let it gently simmer for twenty minutes. Strain till clear through a kitchen cloth, then pour the jelly into a mould till set. Pancakes. Ingredients. Four ounces of Flour. One Egg. Half a pint of Milk. Salt. Sugar. One Lemon. Put the four ounces of flour into a basin, add the egg to it (having first ascertained that it is a good one), and pour in gradually one gill of the milk. Beat it well, and then add the rest of the milk. Strain the mixture into a jug; if possible it is better to let this mixture stand before frying it. Put a small frying-pan on the fire, put into it a piece of lard the size of a nut, let it get quite hot, then pour in sufficient batter to cover the bottom of the pan thinly ; when it has become a light brown on one side, toss it over to brown on the other side. Turn it out on a piece of kitchen paper, dredge sugar over it, and a squeeze of lemon-juice ; roll it up, and proceed in this manner till all the batter is used up. Sufficient for twelve or fourteen pancakes.

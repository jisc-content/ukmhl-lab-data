5Â» Savoury Meat Toast. Ingredients. Half a pound of cold Meat. Four ounces of Bread-crumbs. A teaspoonful of chopped Parsley. Half a teaspoonful of chopped Lemon-rind. Half a gill of white or brown Sauce. Two Eggs. Salt and Pepper, and Toasted Bread. Mince the meat very fine (any kind of meat will do, scraps of ham or tongue mixed will improve the flavour), mix it with the bread crumbs, parsley, lemon-rind and moisten with the sauce, add the yolk of the eggs, season with pepper and salt and stir over the fire until set. Have ready one or two slices of toasted bread, well trimmed of crust, put the mince on it in a heap, smooth over with a knife, beat up the white of one egg to a stiff froth, cover the top over with this, sprinkle with a few fried bread-crumbs, and bake in a moderately heated oven for about ten minutes. Serve very hot. VEGETABLES. Boiled Potatoes. As a general rule, it is more economical to boil potatoes in their skins.

Potatoes take longer to steam than to boil. They take an hour to bake,

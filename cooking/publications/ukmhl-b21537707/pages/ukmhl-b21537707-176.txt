go Unfermented Bread. Ingredients. One pound Flour. One and a half gill Water. One teaspoonful of Baking Powder. Half teaspoonful of Salt. Put the flour into a basin, add the baking-powder and salt, mix these well with the cold water; and bake in the oven for half an hour. One pound Wholemeal. Half-pint Water. One teaspoonful Baking Powder. Half teaspoonful Salt. Prepare as above. Buns. Ingredients. Three gills of Milk. One ounce of Yeast. One teaspoonful of castor Sugar. Half a pound of Flour. Rub the flour through a sieve into a basin—cream the yeast and sugar together in a small basin, and add to it the milk lukewarm, strain the milk with the yeast and sugar into the flour and beat them well together—cover the basin with paper and set this sponge to rise for about one hour. In another basin put: One pound and a quarter of Flour. Quarter of a pound of Fat. Two ounces of Candied Peel. Two Eggs. Quarter of a pound of Sultanas. Quarter of a pound of Sugar. When the sponge in the first basin has risen, beat in all these dry ingredients from the second basin, with the two eggs. Thoroughly mix and beat them for about five minutes. Then set this sponge to rise again for about one hour and a half; shape this mixture in spoonfuls like buns, and bake them on a greased tin for half an hour. When cooked, and while they are hot, brush them over with a little milk and sugar to glaze them.

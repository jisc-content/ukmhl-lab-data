5 ward children to answer most frequently, but avoid any appearance of unkindness or partiality. Draw from the class the most im- portant practical points of the lesson. The children will remember better what they tell you than what you tell them. Dish up, and dismiss the class in an orderly manner, two by two. Those who wish to buy any of the food cooked may remain behind—the others pass out quietly. Practice Class. The practice lesson follows a demonstration as soon as possible, and should be upon the same dishes, recipes for which will be in the children’s books. The best way to teach a practice class of eighteen pupils is to arrange four tables (8 ft. by 2 ft. 6 in. each) in an open square, six girls to work on the outside of three tables only, and the teacher to be inside the square formed by the tables. The fourth table is required as a dresser to hold materials and utensils. By this arrangement the pupils and the teacher always face each other. See that the children’s hands are washed and their hair tied back before they take their places. The children should be set to work in pairs, and taught to weigh out their own materials. The teacher should move around the class, never staying for long with one set of girls. She should see that the work is well and steadily done. Let the recipes for the lesson on the board be well written, expressed in good English, and correctly spelt.

I LESSONS IN SCULLERY WORK. To clean an Open Range. First of all rake out all the cinders and dust from the grate, taking out all the clinkers, or bad pieces of coal, that bum and cake on to the firebricks and sides of the grate and choke up the fire. The cinders should be sifted and kept for use. Take a sweep’s brush and sweep down all the soot from the flues and oven; take out the doors of the flues at the back of the stove, and the rings on the top of the oven, and with a flue-brush (like a large bottle- brush) sweep down all the soot into the flue at the far side of the oven ; pull out the long narrow door at the bottom of the oven. All the soot will be found fallen into the space underneath the oven; rake this well out with the iron raker. Having swept away all the soot from the flues of the oven and boiler, and raked it out of the spaces at the bottom of the oven and the boiler, replace all the flue shutters and soot doors and the rings on the top of the oven. Mix some powdered blacklead in a gallipot with a little water into a smooth thick liquid; put this on all over the stove from the top to the bottom with a round blacklead brush ; take another brush—rather a soft one—and brush the stove all over, and then polish it well with the third brush, which is a harder one. The bars of the grate are blackleaded and polished in the same way. The steel bars and knobs are all polished with emery paper, not too coarse, and the brass handles and bolts are polished with bath brickdust and a leather. To clean the hearth, wash it over first with a flannel, hot water, and a little soda to remove the grease. Rub the stone all over with hearthstone, and then wring the flannel out of the hot water and smooth the hearth over, rubbing lightly from left to right. Blacklead and polish the inside of the fender as you did the range, and clean the steel parts with emery paper. The fire-irons must be cleaned in the same manner.

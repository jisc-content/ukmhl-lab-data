INTRODUCTION. The Recipes in this little book are intended for the use of our Students who are training for the Plain Cookery Diploma granted by this Committee. They are put together as shortly as possible, giving just the materials and the mode of work only, because all matter relating to the “ reason why,” and the principles of which the recipes are but the outline, are given in full detail in the Demonstration Lessons of the Staff Teachers, notes of which are taken by the Pupils. I wish it to be clearly under- stood that these Artizan Recipes are not intended for the use of the poor people in their own homes, but for those who go out to teach the people. I have always worked upon the principle that the Teachers should be taught the best way of preparing each dish, knowing that those who are most thoroughly masters of their subject make the best Teachers, imparting instruction in the simplest and easiest manner, and adapting their lessons to the circumstances they find themselves placed in.

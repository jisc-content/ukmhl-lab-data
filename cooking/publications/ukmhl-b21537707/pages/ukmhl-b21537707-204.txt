4 FISH. Broiled Mackerel. Clean a fine large mackerel, wipe it on a dry cloth, cut it open down the back, lay it on a nice clean gridiron over a clear slow fire; when one side is done, turn it and cook the other. Mix a little finely-chopped parsley, pepper, and salt, with half an ounce of butter; when the fish is cooked, spread this butter on it, and serve very hot. Potted Shrimps. Ingredients. Shrimps. Salt. White Pepper. A very little pounded Mace and Cloves. Clarified Butter. Pick the shrimps ; sprinkle over them a little pepper and salt, and pounded mace and cloves. Press them into a pot and set them in the oven for ten minutes. When cold cover with clarified butter. Stewed Oysters. Ingredients. Two dozen Oysters. A few drops of Lemon Juice. One ounce of Butter. Half ounce of Flour. One gill of Cream or Milk. A little Salt. White Pepper. Stew the oysters in their own liquor; when they are just coming to the boil, skim them; take them up and beard them, and lay them on a dish. Strain the liquor; mix the butter and flour together in a stew-pan : add the liquor, cream, salt, pepper, and a few drops of lemon juice, and boil for five minutes to cook the flour. Tut the oysters in this sauce to get hot throughâ€”they must on no account boil. Serve in a dish with croutons of bread round.

7i Lemon Pudding. No. 2. Ingredients. Half a pound of Bread-crumbs. Quarter of a pound of Suet. Two ounces of Flour. Quarter of a pound of Moist Sugar. Two Lemons. Two Eggs. Two tablespoonfuls of Milk. Chop up the suet very fine, and rub it into the flour with your fingers, in a basin, then add the bread-crumbs and moist sugar, the grated rind and the juice of the two lemons. Break the two eggs in another basin, and beat well together with two tablespoonfuls of milk ; pour the milk and eggs on to the other ingredients, and mix well together. Grease a pint basin, pour in the mixture, cover it with a greased paper, and steam for four hours, then turn it out of the basin and serve. To steam any pudding, stand it in a saucepan with enough boiling water to come half-way up the basin; as the water boils away add more boiling water, and keep the lid on the saucepan to keep the steam in. Lemon Tartlets. Ingredients. Juice of two Lemons and the grated Peel of one. Five ounces of castor Sugar. Two teaspoonfuls of Corn Flour. Twelve Raisins. Cut the raisins in half, stone them and stew them in a little drop of water. Mix the corn-flour with the lemon-juice, stir in the rind and juice of the lemons, the sugar and the raisins, beat these well together. Line some patty-pans with a thin paste, fill them with mixture, cover them over with paste and bake for about ten minutes. Make the paste the same as for fruit pie. (See page 68.)

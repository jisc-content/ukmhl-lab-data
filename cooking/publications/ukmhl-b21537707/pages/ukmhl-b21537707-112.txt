26 Scolloped Fish. Ingredients. Cold cooked Fish of any kind. Bread-crumbs. Butter. Pepper and Salt. Fish Liquor.

Very Simple Water Souch£. Ingredients. Plaice, Dabs, or Flounders. Water. Salt. Parsley. Take plaice, dabs, or flounders, wash them clean, cut off the fms, and put the fish into a stewpan with just enough cold water to cover them; add a little salt and a good bunch of parsley; boil gently till the fish is cooked. Strain the liquor into a tureen, put in the fish and a teaspoonful of finely chopped parsley. Hand parsley and butter sauce. Water Souche (another way). Ingredients. Flounders or Dabs. One Onion. One small Carrot. Parsley. Salt. One gill of Milk. Thoroughly clean the fish, and put it into a saucepan with cold water—enough to cover it; add a little salt, the onion and carrot shredded, and a handful of parsley chopped finely. Boil gently till the fish is cooked, then add as much milk as will turn the water white, about one gill. Serve all together in a soup tureen.

86 Savoury Omelet. Ingredients. Two Eggs. One ounce of Butter. Salt, Pepper, and chopped Parsley. Break the eggs into a basin and beat lightly together, just enough to mix them thoroughly; sprinkle in the chopped parsley, pepper and salt. Have the butter quite hot in the omelet-pan, pour in the eggs, stir quickly to prevent the mixture from sticking or burning. As soon as the edges are set, fold it over towards the handle of pan with your spoon, cook lightly for a moment, turn it on to a hot dish and serve. About a teaspoonful of very finely-chopped parsley is enough ; and a morsel of shallot and grated ham may be added if liked. To Poach an Egg. Ingredients. One Egg. One pint of Water. One teaspoonful of Salt. Two or three drops of Lemon-juice. Put the water, salt and lemon-juice into a stewpan, and bring to the boil. Break the egg carefully into the boiling water. Keep the pan simmering till the white is quite set, about a minute and a half. Take it gently up with a slice, cut away the ragged edges, and serve on toast with slices of ham or bacon, or on spinach. Toast and Eggs. Ingredients. Two Eggs. Two ounces of Fresh Butter. Salt and Pepper. Break the eggs into a small stewpan, add the salt, pepper, and butter; set the stewpan over a moderate fire, and stir the eggs round with a wooden spoon, being careful to keep every particle in motion, until the whole has become a smooth and delicate thickish paste; have ready a convenient sized piece of toast, pour the eggs upon it, and serve immediately.

100 Melted Butter. Ingredients. One ounce of Butter. Half an ounce of Flour. One and a half gills of cold Water. Melt the butter in a saucepan over the fire, and stir in the flour; then add one and a half gills of cold water, stirring it to make it smooth, until it boils and thickens. It should boil well, to cook the flour; nothing is so nasty as to taste the raw flour in sauces. Sweet Melted Butter. Ingredients. One ounce of Butter. Half an ounce of Flour. One and a half gills of Milk. Half an ounce of Sugar. Melt the butter and flour together in a stewpan over the fire; stir in the milk by degrees, add the sugar, and stir till it boils and thickens; let it boil a few minutes to cook the flour. Pour round the pudding and serve. This sauce can be flavoured with a few drops of vanilla if liked. Orange Syrup. Ingredients. One pint of Orange-juice. One and a half pounds of castor Sugar. Boil these together slowly and skim as long as any scum rises. When cold bottle it off and cork it securely. Two tablespoonfuls of this syrup to quarter of a pint of melted butter makes a capital sauce for puddings. A teaspoonful will flavour custards, etc.

92 Pass the flour and ground ginger through a sieve into a basin ; shred the peel finely, and add it to the flour. Put the fat, treacle, and sugar into a stewpan to dissolve; beat the eggs in a small basin, then put the soda into another small basin; add to it the milk last. Mix the flour with the treacle, eggs, and milk, and well beat them. Turn the mixture into a greased cake-tin, and bake in a moderate oven for about one hour and a half. Ginger Nuts. Ingredients, Half pound Flour. One Egg. ** Quarter pound Sugar. Three ounces Butter (about). Half ounce to one ounce of Ground Ginger. Quarter pound Honey or Treacle. Cream the butter and sugar together, stir in the other ingre- dients, working it well until it forms a rather stiff batter. Drop on to a buttered tin, in quantities of about one teaspoonful, and bake for fifteen minutes. Lemon Jumbles. Ingredients. One Egg. Five ounces of castor Sugar. Three ounces of Butter. Fourteen ounces of Flour. Three teaspoonfuls of Milk. One teaspoonful of Cream of Tartar. Quarter of a teaspoonful of Carbonate of Soda. Juice of two Lemons and the grated rind of one. Cream the butter, sugar and egg well together, then stir in the milk, the lemon-juice, and rind. Mix the carbonate of soda and the cream of tartar into the flour, and stir it gradually into the other ingredients till you have a rather stiff paste; then roll it out rather thin, cut it out with a cutter or twist it into an S, and bake in slow oven about ten minutes.

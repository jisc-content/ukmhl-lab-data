12 Shred the vegetables and put them in a saucepan with the butter, which must be melted but not hot. Cook them over the fire, but do not let them brown. Then add the castor sugar, buy- leaf, and water, and boil for about ten minutes, until the vegetables are tender. Mix the flour and milk together, pour into the saucepan, and boil for a few minutes to cook the flour, stirring carefully. Take out the bay-leaf, add the salt, and the soup is ready. Penny Dinner Soup. Ingredients. Half-pound fine Oatmeal. One pound Lentils. One pound of mixed Vegetables (turnips, carrots, parsnips, One pound of mashed Potatoes. [leeks and celery). Pepper, Salt, dried Mint. One gallon of Water. The lentils should be soaked over night; these, with all the vegetables chopped up as fine as possible, should be put on first, and when nearly boiling, the oatmeal must be sprinkled in and stirred, so that it does not gather into lumps ; let this boil well for two hours, just at the last add the mashed potatoes and the mint. It is an improvement to stir in a lump of butter before serving, but this can be left out if preferred. FISH. Baked Fish. Butter a tin and put the fish on it, sprinkling a little pepper and salt over it. Butter a sheet of kitchen paper, and cover the fish closely over with it. Put this in the oven, and when the fish is cooked—it will take from ten minutes to half an hour, according to the size of the fish—take off the paper, put the fish on a dish, and sprinkle over it a little finely chopped parsley; then strain over it the liquor on the tin in which the fish was baked : this is the essence of the fish. Serve very hot. Almost all fish is nice cooked this way.

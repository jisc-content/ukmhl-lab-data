50 Cut up the tripe and blanch it; cut up the onions, and fry them with the herbs in two ounces of fat or butter, and stir in the ounce of flour. Rub one pound of tomatoes through a sieve, put this into the stewpan with the fried onions, add the tripe and a little salt, then let it all simmer gently for one hour, and serve. Veal Cake. Ingredients. One pound of Veal Cutlet. Three eggs. Half a pound of fat Bacon. Parsley, Pepper, and Salt. A little grated Lemon-rind. One gill of Stock. Boil the eggs hard, and cut them in slices. Chop up the parsley and mix with the grated lemon-rind, the pepper and salt. Line a plain round mould with the slices of egg on the bottom. Cut up the veal into neat pieces, and put it in the mould in alter- nate layers with the bacon cut up and the slices of egg, sprinkling each layer with the seasoning. When the mould is full, pour in the stock; should the stock not be consistent enough, add two sheets of French gelatine; make the stock from the bones and scraps of veal, flavour with soup vegetables ; cover over tightly with buttered paper, put a weight on the top, and bake in a slow oven for three or four hours. When quite cold, turn out and serve. Boiled Cowheel. Ingredients. One Cowheel. Water or Milk to cover it. Two tablespoonfuls of Flour. Chopped Onions. Pepper and Salt, and chopped Parsley.

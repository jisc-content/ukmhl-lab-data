Let this all boil for three hours, till reduced to two quarts, then strain it off; add one ounce of vermicelli to the liquor, and let it boil gently till it is cooked. Just before serving put in some nice pieces of the skate. The rest of the skate can be served separately with parsley and butter sauce. Spring Soup Maigre. Ingredients.

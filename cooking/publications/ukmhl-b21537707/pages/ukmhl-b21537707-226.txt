6 The teacher must be very, vigilant during the practical work. She must spur on slow pupils, find extra work for the quick girls, and help judiciously if necessary, so that all have finished at the same time, and that no food is spoilt. When all the dishes are prepared let the washing-up be done, each two girls washing-up and putting away all they have used, and then scrubbing their table. When all is tidy, briefly question on important points to be remembered, and write them on the blackboard. Then have all the dishes placed tidily on the table, and if anything has been made which takes long to cook, it should now be dished. Let those who do not want to buy pass out quietly, while those who do remain behind. Be punctual in beginning and ending the lesson. Let the children prepare and cook the dishes themselves, and show them that they are responsible. If a child cannot work independently in class, she will be unable to help at home. Choose dishes that can be begun and finished in the lesson. Insist upon perfect order, cleanliness, and quietness. Allow no child to leave her place without permission. Constant occupation for the whole class is a great means towards discipline. Be careful that your pupils stand in good positions : common faults are to cross the feet, and to stand with one shoulder higher than the other : this is important both for health and discipline. No waste of time or unnecessary talking should be allowed. Pupils should raise the hand if they wish to speak to the teacher; be on the alert to see the hands so that the pupils may not be tempted to disobey. If possible, learn the names of the pupils before you take the class. Know each by name, and be careful to address her by it. This is a very important point with regard to discipline and influence. Set a good example to the class by dressing in clean, neat, and plain clothes, and wearing no bracelets or other unnecessary ornaments.

RECIPES FOR PLAIN COOKERY. SOUPS. Fish Soup (White). Ingredients. Three pounds of Fish, bones and fins. Three quarts of cold Water. A teaspoonful of Salt. One Leek. One Onion. One Carrot. A good bunch of Parsley or Parsley roots. One Bay-leaf. One sprig of Thyme. Three or four sticks of Celery. Three Cloves. One small blade of Mace. One pint of Milk. One ounce of Fat or Butter. Three teaspoonfuls of Flour. Do not use herrings or mackerel for soup ; ling, conger, hake, or skate are best. Take three pounds of fish, bones and fins do very well, chop them up, wash them, put them into a saucepan with three quarts of cold water and a teaspoonful of salt; when it boils skim it well, and then add the vegetables, previously washed and cut up, also the cloves, mace, and herbs. Let this all boil gently for an hour and a half. Mix the flour into a smooth paste with a gill of milk, stir this into the soup, stir till it boils again to cook the flour, then add the rest of the milk and the butter or clarified fat, and when it has boiled for another ten minutes, strain it into a soup-tureen or basin into which you have previously put a teaspoonful of finely chopped parsley and a little cooked carrot nicely shredded. * High Class Recipes in the same form are now published.

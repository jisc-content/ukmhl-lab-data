Demonstration Lessons. Arrange the class so that all may see and be seen; near-sighted, deaf, and short girls to the front. Have all utensils and in- gredients on the table or close at hand, but keep a clear space immediately in front of your work, so that the- class can distinctly see all operations. Give prominence to the practical rather' than the theoretical part of the lesson. A child will learn more from seeing a poor speaker cook well than from seeing a good speaker cook badly. One of the most important points in demonstration is to avoid confusing the pupils by repeatedly doing a little towards one dish, then a little towards another, and mixing the verbal, instructions in the same way. An unskilful teacher will often teach nothing, and do actual harm to the minds of her pupils by this lack of system. Plan carefully, so that each dish is prepared in definite stages, and explained as clearly. If possible, never stop when dictating a recipe,' but give ingredients and method straight through; in any case do not begin to dictate a second recipe before the first is finished. When teaching dishes which must be dealt with alternately, write the recipes on the blackboard before the class meets, and refer to the written recipe as each part is reached, questioning so carefully at the end of the lesson that no confusion is possible. Owing to the difficulty of being at the same time clear, quick, and interesting, a demonstration lesson needs exceedingly care- ful arrangement and preparation. Search for facts and hints bearing directly upon the practical work. There is so much of variety and interest in cookery, that want of brightness and originality in demonstrating is inexcusable, besides being fatal to success. Very few dishes (never more than three) should be attempted at each lesson, or true teaching and discipline will be sacrificed.

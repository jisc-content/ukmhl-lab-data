13 Boiled Fish. Put a saucepan or fish-kettle of water on the fire to boil. Clean the fish thoroughly in cold water, and put it on to a strainer or dish. When the water is warm, put the fish in and some salt (there should be enough water to cover the fish). Let it simmer gently from twenty minutes to three-quarters of an hour, according to the size of the fish. Skim it occasionally. When we find the skin of the fish is cracking, we shall know that it is sufficiently boiled. Take it carefully out, place on a hot dish, and serve with melted butter or egg-sauce. Broiled Herrings (Mustard Sauce). Ingredients. Three Fresh Herrings. One ounce Flour. Half-pint Vinegar. Six whole Peppers. One Onion. One teaspoonful of Mustard. Cut the heads off the fish, wash them clean, dry them in a clean cloth, notch them across with your knife, flour them, and broil them. Take the heads and smash them up, boil them in vinegar with six whole peppers and one onion for a quarter of an hour, then strain them. Mix one ounce butter, half-ounce flour, and a teaspoonful of mustard; stir this into the vinegar till it thickens and is cooked. Pour the same over the herrings, and serve. To Broil Herrings and Cabbage. Ingredients. One Cabbage. One ounce Butter. Pepper and Salt. Red Herrings. Boil a cabbage till quite tender; strain it, and put it into a saucepan with one ounce of butter or fat, and a little pepper and salt; stir it that it does not burn, and chop it up with the spoon. Flour and broil some red herrings, put the cabbage on a dish, lay the fish on it, and serve very hot.

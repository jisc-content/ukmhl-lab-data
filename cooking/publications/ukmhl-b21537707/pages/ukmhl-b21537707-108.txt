24 To Steam Fish. In a small house, where you have not got a fish-steamer, fish can easily be steamed in a fish-kettle by putting a basin in, and standing the strainer on the basin with enough water to come half-way up the basin. As the water boils away, add more boiling water from the kettle. If you have only a saucepan and no fish- kettle, turn a pie-dish upside down in the saucepan and place the fish on the dish, anything just to raise the fish out of the water, and let it cook in the steam. One thing is quite necessary, and that is a tightly fitting cover to whatever you steam in, to keep the steam well round the fish, or it will not cook properly, but will get sodden and nasty. Fish takes rather longer to steam than to boil, and some kinds of fish take more cooking than others. When it begins to crack, and leaves the bone easily, it is cooked. Stewed Eels (White Sauce). Ingredients. One pound of Eels. Half-pint of Water. One ounce of Flour. One ounce of Butter. One teaspoonful of chopped Parsley. Cayenne Pepper and Salt. Cut the head off the eel, skin it from the head down, clean it well, cut it up into pieces two or three inches in length, and put it into a stewpan with half-pint of cold water ; when it boils, skim it well, and let it simmer for ten minutes. Mix one ounce of flour into a smooth paste with a little cold water, add a little cayenne pepper and salt, and stir this to the eels ; let it boil about five minutes longer to cook the flour. At the last, stir in one ounce of butter and a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, and serve, putting the pieces of fish in the centre of a dish, and pouring the sauce all around them.

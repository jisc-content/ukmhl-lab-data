37 ori the pieces of pork, lay two or three pieces on each round of paste, also some of the chopped up potatoes and onions. Close up the pasties and bake them for about three-quarters of an hour. If preferred, you can put all the pork and vegetables into the paste, tie it up in a floured cloth and boil for one or one and a half hours. This would be a pork roly-poly. Roast Joint. To roast a joint, have a well-made-up clear fire. Weigh your joint, and allow a quarter of an hour to each pound of meat, and one quarter of an hour over; white meats, such as veal or pork, take a little longer. Put the meat close to the fire for the first five minutes, to close up the pores and keep the gravy in, then draw it further away. Baste it often, and see that it does not burn. For the last quarter of an hour put the joint closer again to the fire, to brown the outside. When the meat is cooked, take it up on a hot dish, pour all the dripping from the pan into a basin for future use when cold. Pour about one gill of stock or hot water into the dripping-pan, scraping the brown particles off which adhere to the pan and which colour the gravy, pouring this round the joint, not over it, as that would sodden the meat. When the joint is cut, the juices will run out, and added to the stock already in the dish will make a good gravy. Roasting in a Stew Pan. Ingredients. A CalPs Heart. Two ounces of Dripping.

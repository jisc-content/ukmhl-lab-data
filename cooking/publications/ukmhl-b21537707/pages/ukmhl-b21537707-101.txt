17 Fish Pasties and Patties. Ingredients. One pound of Fish. Half pound of Potatoes. One teaspoonful of chopped Parsley. One teaspoonful of chopped Onion. A little Sweet Herbs. One pound of Flour. Five ounces of Fat. One teaspoonful of Baking-powder. First make the paste. Rub the fat well into the flour, then add the baking-powder, a pinch of salt, and enough cold water to mix it into a stiff paste. Flour a board and roll out the paste two or three times, then cut it out into round pieces with a saucepan-lid or a cutter. Cut up the fish and potatoes into small pieces and place a little fish and potato on each piece of paste, sprinkle over this a little of the chopped parsley, onion, herbs, pepper and salt, and a few drops of fish liquor. Wet round the edge of the paste with cold water, fold it over and pinch the two edges together in plaits. Put these pasties on a baking sheet into the oven and bake for about half an hour. The same ingredients will make patties. For these roll the paste out thin, line some patty-pans with it, fill them with the fish, potato, and seasoning as above, cover over neatly with paste and bake about half an hour. Fish Pie with Potato Crust. Ingredients. One pound of cold Fish. Pepper and Salt. One and a half pounds of cold Potatoes. One ounce of Dripping. Two tablespoonfuls of Milk. Rub the potatoes through a sieve, if you have one â€¢ if not, put them into a basin and break them up well with a fork. Melt the dripping with half the milk and stir into the potatoes. Break the fish up into small pieces, put it into a pie-dish, and sprinkle it with pepper and salt; add the rest of the milk or some fish liquor. Cover the pie-dish with the mashed potato, smooth it neatly with a knife dipped in hot water, mark it over with a fork, and bake it for three-quarters of an hour. c

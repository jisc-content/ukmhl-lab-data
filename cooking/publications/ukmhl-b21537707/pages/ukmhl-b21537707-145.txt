59 To Boil Rice. Ingredients. Half a pound of Patna. Quarter of a teaspoonful of Salt. Four quarts of boiling Water. Well wash the rice in cold water. Put it into four quarts of boiling water, with a quarter of a teaspoonful of salt, and let it boil fast for fifteen to twenty minutes. When it is quite tender, strain it into a colander, and take it to the sink. Turn the cold- water tap on to it for two or three seconds. Turn it into a clean dry stewpan by the side of the fire, with the lid half on, to dry and get hot. Shake it occasionally, to prevent it from burning. When dry, it is quite ready to serve. Cabbages, Greens, and Savoys. Greens, Savoys and Cabbages must be cooked in plenty of boiling water, with a tablespoonful of salt to every half-gallon. Boil them with the lid off; if the water is very hard, add sufficient carbonate of soda to cover a threepenny piece. Time required to cook them depends upon their age. The stalk should be split and the hard part removed. Haricot Beans. Ingredients. One pint of Beans. One ounce of Fat or Butter. One teaspoonful of chopped Parsley. Soak the beans over-night. Put them in a saucepan with three pints of cold water. When it boils let them simmer gently for two hours, then strain. Melt the fat in the saucepan, return the beans to the saucepan, and shake them in the fat; sprinkle in a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, and serve.

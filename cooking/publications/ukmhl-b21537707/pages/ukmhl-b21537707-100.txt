If you have no cold fish, but cook some on purpose to curry, boil it in one pint of water, and use this water to make the curry of. Serve the curry in a border of boiled rice. Dried Haddocks. These fish should be scalded before they are cooked. Put a dried haddock into a basin or a pie-dish, and pour boiling water over it. Let it soak in this for about five minutes, then take it out of the water and skin it; dry it in a clean cloth, put it on a buttered tin, cover it with buttered paper, and bake it in the oven for about ten minutes. When it is cooked, strain over it the liquor left on the tin in which it was baked; put a little piece of cold butter on it, and serve. Dried Haddock and Tomatoes. Ingredients. One dried Haddock.

Mode of Work.—Mix flour and salt together, add the fat, (melted) to the tepid water, mix with flour. Beat well and let it stand. Wash and fillet the plaice, remove black skin, dry well and leave in a cloth. Mix pepper, flour, and salt together and draw pieces of fish lightly through it. If batter too thick, add one tablespoonful of tepid water just before using it. Dip each piece of fish into the batter and fry in hot fat till golden brown. Drain on kitchen paper and serve hot, garnish with fried parsley. To fry is to boil in fat, so you must have enough fat to cover what you are frying. FRIED HERRINGS, MACKEREL AND PLAICE.

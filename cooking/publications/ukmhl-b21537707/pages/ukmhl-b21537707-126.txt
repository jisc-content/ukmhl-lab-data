40 Cut the meat into thin slices, peel the onion, cut the carrot into small pieces, season the pieces of meat with pepper and salt and put them into a large saucepan in layers, sprinkling the chopped vegetables on each layer, and pour in enough cold water to cover the meat; let it come to a boil, and then let it simmer one and a half hours. While it is doing so make the crust. Chop the suet very finely, put the flour, salt, and baking powder into a basin and mix well together, then rub in the suet, and add enough water to make it into a smooth, very stiff paste, then turn it out on to a floured board and roll it out to the size of the saucepan. Put this paste over the meat in the saucepan and let it simmer gently for one hour and a half. Do not let the paste be quite the size of the saucepan, as it will swell while cooking, and keep the lid on. When done turn out the meat and vegetables and place the crust, previously removed, over them. Sheep’s Head Boiled. Ingredients. One Sheep’s Head. Salt. One ounce of Rice. Ten Peppercorns.

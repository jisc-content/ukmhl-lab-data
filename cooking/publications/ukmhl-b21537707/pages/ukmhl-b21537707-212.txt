Vegetable Marrow Stuffed. Ingredients. One Marrow. Two ounces of cold Meat. One ounce of Breadcrumbs. One tablespoonful of chopped Parsley and Thyme. Pepper and Salt. A little Stock or Milk. Peel the marrow, cut in half lengthways, take out the seeds; soak the bread in stock or milk, mince the meat, and mix it with the soaked bread, parsley, and thyme; add pepper and salt, and fill each half of the marrow with this mixture; tie the two halves together. The marrow can now be either steamed and served with melted butter, or baked and served with brown sauce. It will take about an hour to cook; if b^ked, mix a little flour, pepper and salt, and shake over it, and baste it occasionally with dripping or butter.

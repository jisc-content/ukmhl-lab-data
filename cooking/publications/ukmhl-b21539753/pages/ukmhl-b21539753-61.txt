83 PASTRY baking is always heavy and tough. Roll pastry lightly ; heavy rolling presses out the air. To put a Cover on a Pie or Tart Roll out the pastry to an oval shape. Then reverse the pie dish, lay the paste over the under side and cut it round the edge. This will give a sufficiently large piece of paste to cover the pie when the ingredients are raised (as they should be) in the middle. Lay the cover in a cool place, roll out the remaining scraps, and cut them into strips of about an inch in width ; wet the edge of the pie dish, lay these round, then put in the dish whatever ingredients the pie or tart is composed of, heaping them well in the middle. Wet the edge of the pastry round the dish and lay the paste cover over. Trim round the edges of the pastry, holding the pie in your left hand and cutting from you. Make a hole in the centre of the paste over a meat pie, to let the gases from the meat escape. Make a small hole in either side of a tart, to let the steam escape. Meat pies may be decorated with paste leaves, but for a fruit tart the cover is left plain. Baking of Pastry The oven must be very hot when the pastry is put in, but when the pastry has risen well and is set, the oven should be kept at a moderate heat. Great heat during the whole time of baking would make the pies or tarts dry. They can finish cooking on the top of the stove if more convenient.

COOKERY FOR SMALL INâ€™COMES 42 roes. Fry them in a frying-pan in a little fat ; the roes are also fried. When cooked, place them on a hot dish, and fry in the same fat the onions cut into rings ; fry these a dark brown, almost black, but avoid burning tht m. Dish the herrings neatly with the onions and roes in heaps round them. Sprats These are best fried or baked, but they may be boiled. Fresh Haddock These may be boiled, baked, or roasted in a Dutch oven. They are excellent stuffed and cooked with bacon and potatoes, as directed for cod, hake, &c. Dried Haddock If very dry, soak in water for twenty minutes. If not so dry, for three minutes. Broil over a clear fire, or if the fire is not clear, in an ordinary oven, or cook in a frying-pan. Serve quite hot. Mackerel Mackerel may be boiled, baked, fried, broiled, or cooked in a Dutch oven. Boiled, caper, an- chovy, or any fish sauce is nice with it. Broiled or fried, mustard sauce is very good. When mackerel are broiled or fried they must be split open. Potted Mackerel Prepare these according to directions for potted herrings.

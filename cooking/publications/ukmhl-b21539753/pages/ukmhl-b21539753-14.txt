COOKERY FOR SMALL INCOMES 22 tied together with string, 1 quart of water, 1 pint of green peas, flour. Method.—Cut the mutton into pieces, and flour them, make the dripping hot in a frying-pan and fry the meat in it ; then put it in a saucepan with the herbs, the onion sliced, and the water, and simmer gentl}^ until tender. Take out the meat, and put in a pint of green peas, boil gently until cooked, and then re-heat the meat. Remove the bunch of herbs and serve. If peas are too expensive, put in a cupful of rice one hour before the meat is cooked. This dish will probably take two hours and a half to prepare. Stewed Shin of Beef Ingredients.—2 lbs. of shin of beef, 3 pints of water, 2 carrots, 2 turnips, 2 onions, 1 sprig of parsley, thyme, marjoram, and a bay leaf, tied together, a little celery (if possible), or a teaspoon- ful of celery seed tied in muslin, pepper and salt to taste, flour. Method.—Put the beef, whole or cut in pieces, into a saucepan or stewing jar with the vegetables cleansed and sliced, and the water, and stew from three to four hours (see rules for stewing). When cooked, thicken the gravy with flour, using rather more than two table-spoonfuls. Put the beef on to a hot dish, with the vegetables round it, and pour the gravy over it. This stew is richer and browner if the meat is floured and fried in dripping before it is stew^ed, and the vegetables also fried.

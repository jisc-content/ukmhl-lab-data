10 the rake scrape the bottom of the roaster and rake out the soot from the flues A' and A''*, and from both sides of the midfeather. A large dust-pan with a covered back is the best thing to collect the soot in. Place it in front of P and tilt it, with the front edge resting on the moulded skirting of the range, and then scrape the soot quietly into it to prevent it flying about; then cover the dust-pan all over with an old news- paper and take it so covered to the dust-bin and empty it. Replace the soot door P. Sixthly.—Take off the covers in the hot plate that are over the oven and the flue cover over and sweep and scrape the flue B' and under the oven, and do everything and proceed in the same way as described for the roaster. In cleaning the flues gi'eat care must be taken to remove all soot and dirt from every corner; failure to do this thnrouyhiy and properly is likely to spoil the cooking of a meal, and certainly to delay it beyond the appointed time. Be sure to replace all the movable parts and soot doors, and see that they are all closed tightly, other- wise the range will not work properly or it will smoke. N.B.—Be very careful when moving these pai'ts that they arc not allowed to fall, because being made of ra‘<t iron they might break, and a broken part will put the I’ange out of use until a new part can be obtained, which will not be for several days. Seventhly.—Open the doors of the roaster and the oven and draw out the shelves and carefully clean out and scrape off from the insides, sides, bottoms, and tops, and shelves all sugar, jam, gravy, or grease that may have boiled over, or become baked on, and any dust or soot that may have got in must be brushed out. Note.—For this scraping use only an old knife, to be kept for the purpose.

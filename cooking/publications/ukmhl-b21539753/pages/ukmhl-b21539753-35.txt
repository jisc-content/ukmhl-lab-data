FISH 43 Fried Sprats Sprats contain a great deal of oil, and therefore do not require any fat to fry them in. Sprinkle them with a little salt when they are in the frying- pan and follow directions for frying fish. Potted Sprats These are potted like herrings (see directions). To prepare Sprats as Anchovies Required.—For every peck of sprats, 2 lbs. of common salt, | lb. of bay salt, 4 ozs. of saltpetre, 2 ozs. of sal prunel. Method.—^The sprats must be perfectly fresh from the sea, but not washed or otherwise pre- pared. Pound the salts and other ingredients together, then put the sprats and salts in layers in stone jars, press them hard down and cover for six months. Bloaters These may be broiled over a clear fire, fried, or baked in the oven. They are best broiled. Home-made Bloaters In some seaside places herrings may be bought at very low prices, such as 100 for 6d. when the catches are large. It is then wise to make them into bloaters for future use. Scrape them, and draw them at the gills,* when all that is necessary will come away. Lay them in pans and completely cover them with salt. When wanted, soak them in * They must not be washed. D

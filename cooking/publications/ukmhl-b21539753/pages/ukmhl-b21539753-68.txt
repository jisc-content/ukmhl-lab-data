COOKERY FOR SMALL INCOMES 90 Treacle Tart Ingredients.—Pastry, treacle, bread crumbs, or coarse oatmeal. Method.—Line a tart or baking-tin with pastry, trimming it round the sides ; pour treacle over and sprinkle with bread crumbs or coarse oatmeal. Bake until the pastry is cooked. Paste Sandwiches Ingredients.—Pastry, apples, currants, sugar. Method.—Divide some paste into two parts ; roll them out thinly. With the one cover the bottom of a greased baking-tin, and cover it with apples peeled and finely sliced, and strew over these currants, which have been washed and dried, and moist sugar ; cover with the other piece of pastry, and bake in a moderately quick oven for about fifteen or twenty minutes ; then cut into squares. Mince Pies Ingredients.—Mincemeat, flaky crust. Method.—Roll out the pastry, reverse a large breakfast cup on it, or a small basin, and with a sharp knife cut into rounds. Keep the first rollings for the top of the pies, as the second will not be so light. Lay half the rounds on greased patty-pans, wet round the edges with water, lay a heap of mincemeat in the centre, put on the covers, and bake in a quick oven for fifteen or twenty minutes. If wished glazed, wet with a little water and sprinkle with crushed lump sugar a little time before the pastry is cooked.

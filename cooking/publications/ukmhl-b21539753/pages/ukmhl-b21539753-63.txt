PASTRY 85 Method.—Shred the suet and chop it very finely, put it into a bowl with the flour, add the baking powder and salt ; mix stiffly with cold water. Note.—When much suet is used, baking pow- der is not required. Baking powder is used to lighten the crust instead of fat. Another Crust for Boiled Puddings If suet is not available, use dripping, fat ren- dered down, or lard ; rubbing it into the flour until like fine bread crumbs. In other respects follow directions in foregoing recipe. Ten to One—A Cornish Pie Ingredients.—^Beef, mutton, pork, or any other suitable meat, potatoes, a little chopped parsley or powdered thyme, 2 or 3 onions, pepper and salt. Method.—Peel and slice the onions from the top to the bottom, peel and slice the potatoes. Cut the meat into neat pieces, well season them with pepper and salt, mix them with the onions and potatoes and parsley or thyme. The potatoes should be in the proportion of ten slices to one of meat. Fill a pie dish with the mixture and pour in a cupful of water, cover with a plain crust, and bake gently for two hours. When mushrooms are plentiful, they can be used instead of meat. Kidney and Potato Pie Make like ten to one, using ox-kidney instead of other meat.

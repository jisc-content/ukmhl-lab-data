92 COOKERY FOR SMALL INCOMES Method.—Cut the meat into very small pieces, put them in the water to soak for an hour, then simmer for three hours. Stir the beef tea well before pouring the tea away. Do not strain it, but keep back the pieces of beef with the sauce- pan lid. The tea must only simmer, never boil. Boiling hardens the albumen and fibrine—the nutritious properties of the tea—and makes them less digestible. The tea can be made in a stewing- jar in the oven, or the jar can be placed in a sauce- pan of boiling water. When the tea is cold, care- fully remove the fat before reheating. A stronger tea can be made by using three-quarters of a pound of meat to every pint of water. The meat from which the tea is made can be used in vegetable and meat pies, hashes, stews, and other dishes. Mutton Broth Ingredients.—1 lb. of mutton, 1 quart of water, 1 onion, half a teacupful of rice, pepper and salt. Method.—Cut the mutton in pieces, put them into cold water, add the onion, sliced, and simmer gently for three hours. When the broth has been cooking two hours, put in the rice, and season nicely with pepper and salt. Pearl barley is sometimes liked in mutton broth. Put it on with the mutton, as it requires longer cooking than rice. Barley Soup This is a most excellent and nutritious soup for invalids. The recipe will be found in chapter on soups.

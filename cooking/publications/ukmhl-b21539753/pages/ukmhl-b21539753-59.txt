81 COOKERY OF COLD MEAT pie, using some stock or gravy, if possible, instead of water. As the meat is already cooked, a gravy is necessary to make the pie savoury. Season the meat nicely, cover with a pie crust, and bake for three-quarters of an hour. Tomatoes or mush- rooms are nice in the pie. Fry them a little before using.

Remove them, slice the onion and apple from the top to the bottom, and put them into the dripping with the curry powder, and gently cook for half an hour ; then add the meat and water, and simmer gently until the meat is tender ; season with salt.

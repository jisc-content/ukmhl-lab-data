PUDDINGS 59 PUDDINGS Puddings that are to be boiled must be put into boiling water, the pudding must be under water, and the water kept boiling the whole time. The pudding basin or mould must be quite filled. Neglect of these rules will cause the water to soak into the pudding and spoil it. If puddings are boiled in basins, they must be well greased, and a scalded and floured cloth tied over the top. They are lighter if boiled in a cloth. It must be scalded and floured. Put a plate at the bottom of the saucepan to prevent the pudding sticking and burning. Plain puddings are good and wholesome foods for children. Suet Pudding Ingredients.—1 lb. of flour, 3, 4, or 6 ozs. of suet, 2 teaspoonfuls of baking powder, a little salt. Method.—Shred and chop the suet, and mix tvith the flour and baking powder, and add a little salt. Mix rather stiffly with water, and boil in a scalded and floured cloth for four hours. A richer pudding may be made by using more suet. Another Way Take the ingredients mentioned in the fore- going recipe and some scraps of stale bread, soak these in cold water and then squeeze as dry as possible, beat to crumbs with a fork ; add the bread to the flour and finish as directed for suet pudding.

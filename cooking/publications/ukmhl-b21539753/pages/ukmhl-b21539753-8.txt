COOKERY FOR SMALL INCOMES 16 Method.—Cut the rabbit into joints and well wash it. Cut the pork into slices, put them and the rabbit into a saucepan with the onions sliced from the top to the bottom, add pepper and salt, and cover with water. Simmer gently from half an hour to an hour and a half, according to the size or the rabbit. Thicken the gravy with flour, using one table-spoonful of flour to every pint of gravy. Stewed Rabbit and Potatoes Cook the rabbit as in foregoing recipe, adding 3 lbs. or more of sliced potatoes. No flour is required when potatoes are used. Rabbits and Rice Cook according to directions in foregoing recipes adding a cupful of rice instead of potatoes. Boiled Rabbit, Smothered in Onions Boil the rabbit according to the directions given for boiling meat, cooking a piece of pickled pork with it. It will take from half an hour to an hour and a half, according to its age, but old rabbits are better stewed. Serve it smothered in onion sauce (see sauces). Jugged Hare The foreign hares which can be bought in London and large towns at a low price make a nice and economical dish jugged. Required.—1 hare, some veal forcemeat, an onion stuck with 5 cloves, 1 bay leaf, 1 lb. of shin of beef, flour, dripping, pepper and salt.

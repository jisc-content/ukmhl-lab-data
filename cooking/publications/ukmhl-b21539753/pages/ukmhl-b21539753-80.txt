COOKERY FOR SMALL INCOMES 102 and pastry, or spread on bread instead of dripping for children. For those who cannot afford joints, and therefore have no dripping, it is a wise plan to buy scraps of fat from the butcher’s and melt down ; it is cheaper and better than lard. Melt down the fat with water in this way :— Cut up any fat into pieces half the size of a filbert nut, put them into a strong iron saucepan and cover with water. Boil very slowly until the fat is melted out of the pieces, and take great care that it does not get overheated and burn. Stir it every now and again from the bottom of the sauce- pan. When the fat is melted out, and looks clear, let it cool, and strain it through a strainer or cloth, and press the pieces of fat ; these do not quite melt away, but look brown and shrivelled. They are very nice eaten with bread and salt. When the fat is cold, it should be white and solid. Colouring for Gravies Ingredients. — 4 table-spoonfuls of brown sugar, a quarter of a pint of hot water. Method.—Put the sugar into an old iron sauce- pan, and stir over the fire until a very dark brown colour, almost black, but be careful it does not burn. Then add, off the fire, the water gradually. Stir until the sugar is dissolved, and then strain and put into a bottle. Use very little, or it will give a taste to the gravies. Peas Pudding Required.—1 quart of split peas, pepper and salt.

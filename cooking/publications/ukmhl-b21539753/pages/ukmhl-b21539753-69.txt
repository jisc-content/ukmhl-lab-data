91 PASTRY If no patty-pans are at hand, they can be made without, but the shape will not be so good. Mincemeat Ingredients.—| lb. of suet, 1 lb. of apples, 1 lb. of currants, | lb. of sugar, a little treacle. Method.—Chop the suet finely and chop the apples ; wash and dry the currants ; then mix all the ingredients together. A little beer will im- prove the flavour of the mincemeat. Note.—If a better mincemeat is liked, use with the above ingredients quarter pound of candied peel and the grated rind of two lemons. Apple Dumplings Ingredients.—Apples, pastry, sugar. Method.—Peel the apples, cut out the cores and fill with sugar. Do not roll out the pastry, but take pieces large enough to cover the apples and spread it smoothly over them, pressing it round with the fingers; wet the edges that they may join, put the dumplings on a greased baking-tin, and bake for about half an hour. SICK-ROOM COOKERY Beef Tea Ingredients.—\ lb. of meat to every pint of water. It is economy to buy beef, rump, or buttock steak, as tea made from these will be richer than from shin, which is more glutinous than juicy. G

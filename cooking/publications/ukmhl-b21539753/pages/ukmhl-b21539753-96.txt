16 It has been found by careful experiments that a man engaged in moderate work requii'es each day 4j ozs. “ Strength Producers ” and 15^ ozs. Heat and Energy Producers ” in order to maintain his strength and energy, and it is necessary that he should be supplied with food containing these substances in their proper proportion ; and in order that the fullest value may be obtained from them it is necessary that they should be supplied in a palatable and easily digestible form, as the flavour and taste help to stimulate the production of saliva and the juices of the stomach by means of which the food is digested. The best means of so preparing food you are now being taught by your teacher in your lessons in cookery. It is also advisable that the diet should be as varied as possible, that is, that the “ strength and heat and energy ” giving substances should be obtained from different sources. The table at pages 18-19 will give you the pro- portions in which these substances are contained in various foods. In it, for example, you will find that in such foods as beans, peas, lentils, cheese and oatmeal we have more strength-forming and heat and energy producing material than in meat, and that, at a much less cost, consequently they may with advantage be frequently substituted for meat. In fact If lbs. of oatmeal and a quart of milk contain all the nutriment required for one day by a man engaged in laborious work.* (Skim milk with a little sugar, or dripping or other kind of fat, could be substituted for new milk at a still lower cost.) It is well, however, that a little meat should be ■ Newsliolme and Scott.

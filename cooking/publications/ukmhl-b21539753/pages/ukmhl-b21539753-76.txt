COOKERY FOR SMALL INXOMES 98 JAMS Gather the fruit on a bright clear day, and use it as soon as possible. It must be quite sound. If gathered in wet or damp weather, the jam will become mouldy. As a general rule, allow three- quarters of a pound of sugar to one pound of fruit. The length of time jam takes to boil will vary according to the kind of fruit, and whether it is boiled quickly or slowly ; the more quickly it is boiled, the better it will be in colour and flavour. When a little will set on a plate, it will do. Use white or brown sugar, and when economy has to be considered, do not remove the scum ; it will boil down, and the jam be just as good, if not quite so clear as if removed. If the jam is for immediate use, half a pound of sugar to each pound of fruit may be used. Boil the fruit for half an hour alone, before adding the sugar. Stir always with a wooden spoon. Stir strawberries very carefully. Mash down raspberries. All jams are made in the same waj^ so recipes in detail are unnecessary' for ordinary fruits. Blackberry and Apple Jam Blackberries and apples make a nicer jam than blackberries alone. Peel the apples, core and slice them thinly, put them into a jmn with the black- berries and sugar (see preceding directions), and boil until the jam will set. It usually takes about three-quarters of an hour.

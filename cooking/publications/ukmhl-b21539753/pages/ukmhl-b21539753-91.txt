11 Under no circumstances whatever use one of the table knives. Wash off any grease or dirt from inside the oven and shelves with hot water and strong soda. It is most essential that this should be done after every cooking, or the next batch of food will be spoiled by the burnt flavour from the grease, etc. It is impossible to keep the roaster and oven too clean. When all this has been done black the stove with moist black lead and brush it, when dry, until it shines. Any bright steel parts of the range, the fender, and fire-irons should be kept bright with rotten- stone, which will not scratch, but when a spot, or rust, or marks which the l otten stone will not move emery cloth may be then used, but it must be of the very finest, otherwise the polish will give way to a series of scratches. To Clean Kitchen Utensils. Hair and Wire Sieves.—Wash these well with soda water, scrub them clean with a sieve brush, dry very well, and keep in a dry place. Paste Boards and Rolling Pins.—These must be scrubbed with hot water and soap; if stained rub with sand or salt. Do not use soda, it makes the wood yellow. Baking Tins.—Wash in hot soda water, rub them with sand till bright; rinse well and dry. Knives.-—Wash the steel, but never put the handles in water, it loosens them. When dry rub them till bright on a knife board with brickdust. Before putting away dust them well. Iron Saucepans.—Wash in hot water with soda in- side and out; be careful nothing is left sticking to the bottom. If anything has been burnt in the pan boil some strong soda and water in it, and when washing rub the inside with sand until clean, rinse and dry. The lids should be rinsed, dried, and then cleaned with whiting and polish.

A Brown Stew of Tripe Required.—2 lbs. of tripe, 4 or 5 onions, 1 quart of stock or pot liquor, flour, dripping. Method.—Peel and slice the onions from the top to the bottom.

Pour in the stock or pot liquor, well wash the tripe, cut it into slices, and add it to the onions ; simmer for an hour. Thicken with two table-spoonfuls of flour. A little lean bacon tried, and stewed with the tripe, makes a more savoury dish. Fried Bacon with Cabbage Ingredients.—Bacon, cabbage.

Put a table-spoonful of vinegar into the pan, give it a boil up, and pour over the bacon.

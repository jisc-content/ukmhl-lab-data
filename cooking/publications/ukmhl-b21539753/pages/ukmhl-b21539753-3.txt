11 GENERAL RULES FOR COOKING MEAT could not be made tender by other means. Shin of beef or ox cheek would be comparatively flavour- less if roasted, fried, or baked ; they would, in consequence of the gelatine they contain, become tough and horny. Stewed with vegetables they can be made deliciously tender. Take care .to stew meat until tender, but no longer. Guard against letting it go to rags. There is no reason why it should do this, for when tender the stew can be removed from the fire and re-heated when required, and it will be even better than when just prepared. Tough pieces of meat more quickly become tender if dipped in vinegar before they are stewed ; the acid causes the fibre of the meat to soften more readily. A brown jar, which can stand by the side of the fire or in the oven, is ex- cellent for stewing in. JOINTS OF MEAT PLAINLY D-RESSED BEEFâ€”Sirloin and Ribs are always roasted or baked.

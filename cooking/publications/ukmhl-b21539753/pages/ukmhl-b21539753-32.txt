COOKERY FOR SMALL INCOMES 40 beaten egg and bread crumbs. The use of egg and bread crumbs improves the appearance but adds to the expense of the dish. Cod, Ling, Hake, and Halibut These are all good, whether boiled or baked, but best baked. They may be stuffed with veal stuffing and cooked without paper, but with slices of bacon over them and potatoes round them. Cutlets of all these fish are good fried. Conger Eel This fish is very good, either boiled or baked. It is very good cooked as directed for cod, hake, &c., with bacon and potatoes, or tomatoes. Conger Eel Pie Ingredients.—Conger eel, flour, pepper and salt, a little powdered thyme, a little chopped parsley, a dessert-spoonful of vinegar. Method.—Cut the conger eel into neat pieces, flour them and fry them brown in a frying-pan (they may be used without frying, but the pie will not be so savoury), put them into a pie dish with a little dried and powdered thyme and some chopped parsley ; pour in some water and add the vinegar, pepper and salt ; cover with a pie crust and bake for an hour and a half. A few bits of fried bacon in the pie improve the flavour. Conger Eel Stewed Ingredients.—Conger eel, onions, flour, drip- ping, 2 or 3 cloves.

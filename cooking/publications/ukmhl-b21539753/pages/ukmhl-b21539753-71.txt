SICK-ROOM COOKERY 93 Gruel Ingredients.—1 dessert-spoonful of fine oat- meal, 1 breakfast-cupful of water. Method.—Put the water in a saucepan on the fire to boil. Mix the oatmeal very smoothly with cold water, stir it into boiling water, and stir and cook for ten minutes—longer, if time can be spared. The longer oatmeal is cooked, the more digestible it is. The gruel may be made with milk, if preferred, or milk and water. Sometimes a little salt is added, and sometimes sugar. Posset A posset for a cold is made by boiling a break- fast-cupful of milk. When boiling, pour in two table-spoonfuls of treacle. Boil up. The treacle curdles the milk. Strain the whey through muslin into a cup. As this posset is to promote perspira- tion, give it to the patient when in bed. A Cup of Arrowroot Ingredients.—A breakfast-cupful of milk, two teaspoonfuls of arrowroot. Method.—Put the milk in a saucepan on the fire to boil. Mix the arrowroot very smoothly in a basin with a little cold water ; stir it into the milk when boiling. When it thickens it is ready. It may be sweetened with a little sugar, and a little brandy may be added. Arrowroot alone is not nutritious, but with milk it makes an agreeable food.

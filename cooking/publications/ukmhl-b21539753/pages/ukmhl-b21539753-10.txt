COOKERY FOR SMALL INCOMES 18 with breast of mutton. Barley may be used instead of rice. Ccok it for one hour before the meat is put in. Sheep’s Head Required.—1 sheep’s head, carrots, turnips, onions, pepper and salt to taste. Method.—Cut away the nostrils if the butcher has not already done so, and soak the head in salt and water to remove the blood. Cut out the tongue and remove the brains, wash the head thoroughly, and tie it into shape with string. Put it and the tongue into a large saucepan, and well cover it with warm water. Simmer gently for an hour, then put in the vegetables, prepared and sliced ; continue cooking for about three hours longer. A quarter of an hour before the head is cooked, put in the brains tied in muslin ; when cooked, remove them and make them into brain sauce. Place the head on a hot dish, place the vegetables round it, and pour the sauce over the head. To make a more economical dish, suet, baking-powder, or yeast dumplings may be served with it, or a cupful of rice may be put in one hour before the meat is tender. Use more or less fresh vegetables according as they are plentiful. Pot-au-feu Required.—4, 5, or more lbs. of shoulder, sticking, or any cheap piece of beef, 1 quart or rather more of water to every pound of beef, 3 or 4 carrots, 3 onions, 2 turnips, some celery, a sprig of parsley, thyme, and marjoram, tied together

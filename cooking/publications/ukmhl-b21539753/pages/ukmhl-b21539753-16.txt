COOKERY FOR SMALL INCOMES 24 quarter of an hour longer, adding more water if necessary. Season nicely with pepper and salt. Bacon and Haricot Beans Cook the haricot beans as directed in the chapter on vegetables. Fry some rashers of bacon in a frying-pan. Heap the beans in the middle of a hot dish, place the bacon round them, and pour the fat from the pan over the beans. Sausages and Apples Put the sausages into a cold frying-pan with a little dripping, and heat slowly, as they are apt to burst if put into a hot pan. If they have bread in them, prick them with a fork. Fry with them some slices of apple which have been cored but not peeled. Sausages and Potatoes Proceed as in foregoing recipe, frying potatoes sliced instead of apples. Cold potatoes sliced may be used for this purpose. Macaroni and Pork Pie Ingredients.—i lb. macaroni, 1 lb. pork, 6 sage leaves, 1 onion, parsley. Method.—Break the macaroni and throw it into boiling water, boil for twenty minutes, then put into a pie dish with the pork cut small, the onion chopped, and the sage leaves powdered. Pour in a little of the water the macaroni was cooked in, or any stock, and season well with pepper and salt, cover with a pie crust, and bake for an hour.

15 2nd.—Heat and Energy producing (Ca7-honaceous) Substances are so called because they supply the necessary warmth to the body, and provide the force or energy required for the performance of the bodily duties. They are supplied both by animals and vegetables, and consist of fats, oils, starches and sugars. The fats and oils from animals are, fat of meat, butter, cream, suet, lard, dripping, &c., and from vegetables, olive oil, nut oil, &c. Starch foods are such as arrowroot, rice, sago, tapioca, potatoes, &c. Sugar is obtained from the sugar cane, beetroot, honey, fruits, &c. 3rd.—Salts. The most important of these are phosphate of lime, potash, common salt, and iron. They are necessary for the formation of bone, teeth, nails, &c., and the iron especially is needful to give rich- ness to the blood. Common salt, of course, is added to our food ; the others are supplied by the vegetables and fruit we consume. 4th.— Water. This is a very essential part of our dietary: without it our food could not be digested at all. It is also required for the formation of the blood, and as a carrier of waste materials from the system. Water is contained not only in the liquids we drink, but in all kinds of solid food. For instance, such vegetables as turnips and cabbages contain about fifteen ounces of water in each pound, and even bread contains more than one-third of its weight of water.

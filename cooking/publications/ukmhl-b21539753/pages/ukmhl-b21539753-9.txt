17 POULTRY, RABBITS, ETC. Method.—Cut up the hare, well flour it, and fry it in a frying-pan with the dripping. Fry also the shin of beef cut into slices. Put the beef and the hare into a stewing jar with the cloves, onions, and bay leaf ; add pepper and salt, and cover with water. Cook in a slow oven for four hours. Make some balls of veal forcemeat, first adding the liver of the hare, finely chopped, to it. Fry or bake these, and add to the hare half an hour before it is dished up. CHEAP MEAT DISHES Breast of Mutton Ingredients.—^Breast of mutton, carrots, tur- nips, onions, parsnips (if liked), pepper and salt to taste. Method.—^Allow a quart of water to every pound of meat and one pint over ; put it in a saucepan on the fire to boil. Cut the meat into large pieces ; prepare and slice the vegetables. When the water boils, put in the meat and vege- tables, and then simmer for about two hours. Add pepper and salt to taste. The quantity of vege- tables must be regulated by the price ; when they are plentiful, it is economy to use plenty ; when dear, use sufficient to flavour the broth, and cook haricot beans or rice with the mutton. Rice should be put in one hour before the meat is cooked. Haricot beans should be cooked before the meat is put in. The fat from the broth can be used on bread in place of butter. Dumplings may be used

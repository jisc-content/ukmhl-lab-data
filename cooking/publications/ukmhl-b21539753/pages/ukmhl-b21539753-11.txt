19 CHEAP MEAT DISHES with string, 2 ozs. of sago, 3 cloves, 1 cabbage, parsnips (if liked), pepper and salt. Method.—Make the meat into a nice shape and tie it securely with string. Put it into a large saucepan and add the water cold. Bring to the boil gradually ; skim it. Tie the celery, turnips, and carrots together. When the meat has sim- mered for two hours, put them in, add pepper and salt, and continue simmering for two hours longer ; then put in the cabbage, cleaned and trimmed ; it should be cut in two and tied together with string. When cooked, place the meat on a hot dish with the carrots and other vegetables (the herbs removed) round it. Serve the cabbage in a separate dish. The liquor may be made into soup by boiling the sago mentioned in the ingredients in it for twenty minutes. When it is possible, use leeks instead of onions. Irish Stew Required.—4 lbs. of potatoes, 1 lb. of any pieces of mutton or beef, 7 onions, pepper and salt. Method.—Peel and slice the onions and cut the meat into small pieces. Put a layer of meat in the bottom of the saucepan, then a layer of potatoes, and then a layer of onions ; season well with pepper and salt, and continue placing the ingre- dients in alternate layers. Pour in one pint of water and cook gently, stirring occasionally until the meat is tender, probably about an hour and a half ; but if the meat is very tough, it will require longer cooking.

THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. 428 For details respecting Culinary Processes, Utensils, Sauces, &c., referred to, see under their special heads. Serviettes—continued. Note.—Fold over one side of the Serviette so that the width is 17in.; let a narrow end he towards you, and double this end from you to meet the opposite side. Take the right hand top corner and bring it to the folded edge, Fig. 531. as shown in Fig. 531; the left hand top corner is then to he doubled over in the same way as indicated by the dotted line; this produces Fig. 532. Then fold the line A B over three times towards you, so that the last fold overlaps the top point of triangle G. Turn over the Serviette, and fold over the two top corners so that they meet in the centre of the lower edge (Fig. 533). Again turn over the Serviette, take the two lower points of the triangle, and tuck them neatly under the small fold at the top of the triangle (Fig. 534). This is the wrong side: the reverse is shown in the complete design (see Plate Serviettes—continued. “ Artistic Serviettes,” No. 2). This shape is sometimes used for folding note-paper when sending written messages. When time is an object the following pattern, which is really a simplified form of the other, will be found useful, as it is very quickly folded. Make the Serviette quite square. Have it open on the table, and fold it from you in half

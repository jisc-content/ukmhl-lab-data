THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. 413 For details respecting Culinary Processes, Utensils, Sauces, <bc., referred to, see under their special heads. Sea-kale—continued. the sauce to taste with salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg; when sufficiently thick, move it to the side of the fire and stir in the yolks of two eggs that have been beaten up uith the juice of a small lemon and strained. When the Sea-kale is cooked, drain it as much as possible, place it on a hot dish, pour the sauce over, and serve. Sea-kale Salad.—(1) Cut the Sea-kale into small pieces, put them in a basin, cover with cream and a small quantity of tarragon vinegar, place a cloth over the basin, and leave all night. On the following morning trim some nice fresh lettuces and endive, wash them well, and cut into quarters. Arrange them in a salad-bowl, pile the Sea-kale cream on the top, ornament tastefully with pieces of beetroot, and serve. (2) Chop some remains of cold boiled Sea-kale, and put it into a salad-bowl. Prepare a dressing with salad-oil and strained lemon-juice, and season it with salt and pepper; when well mixed, pour it over the Sea-kale, garnish with cut lemons, and serve with as little delay as possible. Stewed Sea-kale.—Wash the Sea-kale and trim it nicely. Boil it till tender, being careful to keep it nice and white, then drain it. Put it into a stewpan with sufficient rich, clear, well-seasoned brown gravy to cover it, and let it simmer very gently for twenty minutes. Serve on a hot dish. SEASONS.—Almost every kind of food has its parti- cular season—that is, the period of the year when it is at its prime. Produced out of season they may fetch higher prices, but however grateful they may be to the gourmet, there are few foods that do not lose flavour by being forced, or supplied out of season. A large variety of foods are in season all the year round, but this does not apply to the majority. The following list may be found of some use to the cook, although the best guide as to what is in season is a visit to the markets, remembering always that when foods are cheapest and most plentiful they are most frequently prime; when dear they are generally out of season. It may be taken for granted then, that when dear or cheap in season, they are scarce or plentiful and good ; but when dear out of season they are never cheap, and they need not necessarily be good; the chances are that they are not.

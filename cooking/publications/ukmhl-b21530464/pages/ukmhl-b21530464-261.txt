PICKLES. those you have pickled; throw a handful of salt among them, and set them by a slow fire; they will produce a great deal of liquor, which you must strain; and put to it four ounces of shalots, two cloves of garlick, a good deal of pepper, ginger, mace, cloves, and a few hay leaves— boil and skim very well. When cold, cork close. In two months boil it up again with a little fresh spice, and a stick of horse-radish, and it will then keep the year; which mushroom ketchup rarely does, if not boiled a second time. Walnut Ketchup, of the finest sort. Boil or simmer a gallon of the expressed juice of wal- nuts when they are tender, and skim it well; then put in two pounds of anchovies, hones and liquor, ditto of shalots, one ounce of cloves, ditto of mace, ditto of pep- per, and one clove of garlick. Let all simmer till the shalots sink: then put the liquor into a pan till cold; bottle, and divide the spice to each. Cork closely, and tie a bladder over. It will keep twenty years, and is not good the first. Be very careful to express the juice at home; for it is rarely unadulterated, if bought. Some people make liquor of the outside shell when the nut is ripe; but neither the flavour nor colour is then so fine. Cockle Ketchup. Open the cockles, scald them in their own liquor; add a little water when the liquor settles, if you have not enough; strain through a cloth, then season with every savoury spice; and if for brown sauce, add port, anchovies, and garlick—if for white, omit these, and put a glass of sherry, lemon-juice and peel, mace, nutmeg, and white pepper. If for brown, burn a bit of sugar for colouring. It is better to have cockles enough than to add water; and they are cheap.

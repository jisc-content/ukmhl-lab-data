xxxviii OBSERVATIONS FOR THE ranee prevails on necessary subjects, among those who are not backward in frivolous ones. It is very necessary for. a woman to be informed of theprices and goodness of all articles in common use, and of the best times, as well as places, for purchasing them. Sheshould also be acquainted with the comparative prices of provisions, in order that she may l)e able to substitute those that are most reasonable, when they will answer as well for others of the same kind, but which are more costly. A false notion of economy leads many to purchase, as bargains, what is not wanted, and sometimes never is used. Were this error avoided, more money would remain for other purposes. It is not un- usual among lower dealers to put off a larger quantity of goods, by assurances that they are advancing in price; and’many who supply fancy articles are so successful in persuasion, that pur- chasers not unfrequently go far beyond their original intentjon, even to their own future disquiet. Some things are better for keeping, and, being in constant consumption, should be laid in accordingly; such as paper, soap, and candles. Of these, more hereafter. To give unvarying rules cannot be attempted; for people ought to form their conduct on their circumstances; but it is presumed that a judicious arrangement, according to them, will be found equally advantageous to all. The minutiae of management must be regulated by every one’s fortune and rank ; some ladies, not deficient in "either, charge themselves with giving out, once in a month, to a superintending servant, such quantities of household articles as by observation and calculation they know to be sufficient, reserving for their own key the large stock of things usually laid in for very large fa- milies in the country. Should there be several more visitors than usual, they can easily account for increase of consumption, and vice versa. Such a degree of judgment will be respectable even in the eyes of domestics, if they are not interested in the ignorance of their employers; and if they are, their services will not compensate for want of honesty. When young ladies marry, they frequently continue their own maiefs in the capacity of liouse-keeper,s who, as they may be more attached to their interest than strangers, become very valuable servants. To such, the economical observations in this work will be as useful as the cookety; and it is recoin- mendable in them to be strictly observant of both, which, in the course of a year or two, will make them familiar in the practice. It is much to be feared, that for the waste of many of the good things that God has given for our use, not abuse, the mis- tress and servants of great houses will hereafter be called to a strict accouut. Some part of every person’s fortune should be devoted to charity: by which “ a pious woman will build up her house before God, while she that is foolish (i. e. lends nothing to the lord,) pulls it down with her hands.” No one can comolain

Fresh butter ought to smell like a nosegay, and be of an equal colour all through : if sour in smell it has not been sufficiently washed ; if veiny and open, it is probably mixed with staler or an infe- rior sort.

The Dartford sort is thought highly of ; and it is desirable to have a fine large kind, but people differ in their opinion of which is best. The black are very juicy ; but do not answer so well for boiling, as their legs partake of their colour. They should he fed as nearly as possible at the same hour and place. Potatoes boiled, unskinned, in a little water, and then cut, and either wet with skimmed milk or not, form one of the best foods. Turkies and fowls thrive amazingly on them. The milk must not be sour. The best age for setting a hen, is from two to five years ; and you should remark which hens make the best brooders, and keep those to laying who are giddy and careless of their young. In justice to the animal creation, however, it must be observed, there are but few instances of bad parents for the time their nursing is necessary. Hens sit twenty days. Convenient places should be provided for their laying, as these will be proper for sit- ting likewise. If the hen-house is not secured from ver- min, the eggs will be sucked, and the fowls destroyed. Those hens are usually preferred which have tufts of feathers on their heads ; those that crow are not looked upon as profitable.

On looking through them against the sun or a candle, if fresh, eggs will be pretty clear. If they shake they are not fresh.

Feathers. In towns, poultry being usually sold ready picked, the feathers, which may occasionally come in in small quan- tities. are neglected ; but orders should be given to put them into a tub free from damp, and as they dry to

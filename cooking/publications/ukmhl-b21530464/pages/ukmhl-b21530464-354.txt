292 DOMESTIC COOKERY. and by this attention, and removing bad layers and care- less nurses, you will have a chance of a good stock. Let the hens lay some time before you set them, which should be done from the end of February to the begin- ning of May. While hens are laying, feed them well, and sometimes with oats. Broods of chickens are hatched all through the sum- mer, but those that come out very late require much care till they have gained some strength. If the eggs of any other sort are put under a hen with some of her own, observe to add her own as many days t after the others, as there is a difference in the length of their sitting.

But hens must not be disturbed whilee sitting; for if frightened, they sometimes forsake their nests. Wormwood and rue should be planted plentifully about their houses: boil some of the former, and sprin- kle it about the floor; which should be of smooth earth, not paved.

When some of the chickens are hatched long-before the others, it may be necessary to keep them in a basket of wool till the others come forth. The day after they

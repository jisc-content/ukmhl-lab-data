SWEET DISHES. 223 Welch Rabbit. Toast a slice of bread on both sides, and butter it; toast a slice of Gloucester cheese on one side, and lay that next the bread, and toast the other with a sala- mander; rub mustard over, and serve very hot, and covered. Cheese Toast. Mix some fine butter, made mustard, and salt, into a mass; spread it on fresh-made thin toasts, and grate or scrape Gloucester cheese upon them. Anchovy Toast. Bone and skin six or eight anchovies; pound them to a mass with an ounce of fine butter till the colour is equal, and then spread it on toast or rusks. Another way.â€”Cut thin slices of bread into any form, and fry them in clarified butter. Wash three anchovies split, pound them in a mortar with some fresh butter, rub them through a hair-sieve, and spread on the toast when cold. Then quarter and wash some anchovies, and lay them on the toast. Garnish with parsley or pickles. To poach Eggs. Set a stew-pan of water on the fire; when boiling, slip an egg, previously broken into a cup, into the water; when the white looks done enough, slide an egg- slice under the egg, and lay it on toast and butter, or spinach. As soon as enough are done, serve hot. If not fresh-laid, they will not poach well, and without breaking. Trim the ragged parts of the whites, and make them look round. Buttered Eggs. Beat four or five eggs, yolk and white together, put a quarter of a pound of butter in a basin, and then put that in boiling water, stir it till melted, then pour that butter and the eggs into a sauce-pan; keep a basm m your hand, just hold the sauce-pan in the other over

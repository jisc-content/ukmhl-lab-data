Blue.—Let the calico be washed clean and dried ; then mix some of Scot’s liquid blue in as much water as will be sufficient to cover the things to be dyed, and put some starch to it to give a light stiffness. Dry a bit to see whether the colour is deep enough ; then set the linen, &c. into it, and wash it ; then dry the articles singly, and mangle or callender them. To dye Gloves to look like York tan or Limerick, according to the deepness of the dye. Put some saffron into a pint of water boiling hot, and let it infuse all night ; next morning wet the leather over with a brush. The tops should be sewn close to prevent the colour from getting in. To dye White Gloves a beautiful Purple. Boil four ounces of logwood, and two ounces of roche alum, in three pints of soft water till half wasted. Let it stand to be cold, after straining. Let the gloves be nicely mended ; then with a brush do over them, and when dry repeat it. Twice is sufficient, unless the co- lour is to be very dark. When dry, rub off the loose dye with a coarse cloth. Beat up the white of an egg, and with a spunge rub it over the leather. The dye will stain the hands, but wetting them with vinegar will take it off, before they are washed. A Liquor to wash Old Deeds, §c. on Paper or Parch- ment when the writing is obliterated, or when sunk, to make it legible. Take five or six galls, bruise them, and put them into a pint of strong white wine ; let it stand in the sun two days. Then dip a brush into the wine, and wash the part of the writing which is sunk ; and by the colour you will see whether it is strong enough of the galls. < To prevent the Pot in Sheep. Keen them in the Dens till the dew is off the grass.

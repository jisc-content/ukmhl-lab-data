PRESERVES. 249 spoonfuls of orange-flower water, and a tea-cupful of the best brandy. Lemonade, to be made a day before wanted. Pare two dozen of tolerably sized lemons as thin as possible, put eight of the rinds into three quarts of hot, not boiling water, and cover it over for three or four hours. Rub some fine sugar on the lemons to attract the essence, and put it into a china bowl, into which squeeze the juice of the lemons. To it add one pound and a half of fine sugar, then put the water to the above, and three quarts of milk made boiling hot; mix, and pour through a jelly-bag till perfectly clear. Another way.â€”Pare a number of lemons according to the quantity you are likely to want ; on the peels pour hot water, but more juice will be necessary than you need use the peels of. While infusing, boil sugar and water to a good syrup with the white of an egg whipt lip ; when it boils, pour a little cold water into it ; set it on again, and when it boils up take the pan off, and set it to settle. If there is any scum, take it off, and pour it clear from the sediment to the water the peels were infused in, and the lemon-juice ; stir and taste it, and add as much more water as shall be necessary to make a very rich lemonade. Wet a jelly bag, and squeeze it dry, then strain the liquor, which is uncom- monly fine. Lemonade that has the favour and appearance of Jelly. Pare two Seville oranges and six lemons as thin as possible, and steep them four hours in a quart of hot water. Boil a pound and a quarter of loaf sugar in three pints of water, and skim it. Add the two liquors to the juice of six China oranges, and twelve lemons ; stir the whole well, and run it through a jelly-bag till clear. Then add a little orange-water, if you like the flavour, and, if wanted, more sugar. It will keep well if corked.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 264 American Flour Requires almost twice as much water to make it into bread as is used for English flour, and therefore it is more profitable ; for a stone of the American, which weighs fourteen pounds, will make twenty-one pounds and a half of bread, but the best sort of English flour produces only eighteen pounds and a half. The Reverend Mr Hagget's economical Bread. Only the coarse flake-bran is to be removed from the flour; of this take five pounds, and boil it in rather more than four gallons of water; so that when perfectly smooth, you may have three gallons and three quarts of bran-water clear. With this knead fifty-six pounds of the flour, adding salt and yeast in the same way and proportions as for other bread. When ready to bake, divide it into loaves, and bake them two hours and a half. Thus made, flour will imbibe three quarts more of bran-water than of plain ; so that it not only produces a more nutritious substantial food, but makes an increase of one-fifth of the usual quantity of bread, which is a saving of one dayâ€™s consumption out of six ; and if this was adopted throughout the kingdom, it would make a saving of ten millions sterling a year, when wheat was at the price it stood in the scarcity, reckoning the con- sumption to be two hundred thousand bushels a day. The same quantity of flour which, kneaded with wa- ter, produces sixty-nine pounds eight ounces of bread, will, in the above way, make eighty-tliree pounds eight ounces, and gain fourteen pounds. At the ordinary price of flour four millions would be saved. When ten days old, if put into the oven for twenty minutes, this bread will appear quite new again. Rice and ivheat Bread. Simmer a pound of rice in two quarts of water till it becomes perfectly soft; when it is of a proper warmth,

SOUPS. 115 put any sort of spice you like, and three large onions. When the meat is done to rags, strain it off, and put it into a very cold place. When cold, take off the cake of fat (which will make crusts for servants’ pies,) put the «oup into a doubled-bottomed tin sauce-pan, and set it on a pretty quick fire, but don’t let it burn. It must boil fast and uncovered, and be stirred constantly, for eight hours. Put it into a pan, and let it stand in a cold place a day, then pour it into a round soup china-dish, and set the dish into a stew-pan of boiliug water on a stove, and let it boil, and be now and then stirred, till the soup is thick and ropy; then it is enough. Pour it into the little round part at the bottom of cups or basins turned upside down, to form cakes ; and when cold, turn them out on flannel to dry. Keep them in tin canisters. When they are to be used, melt them in boiling water ; and if you wish the flavour of herbs, or any thing else, boil it first, strain off the water, and melt the soup in it. This is very convenient in the country, or at sea, where fresh meat is not always at hand; as by this means a basin of soup may be made in five minutes. Melt half a pound of butter into a stew-pan, shake it round, and throw in six middling onions sliced.

Stew till extremely tender; then take out the flat hones, and remove all the fat from the soup. Either serve that and the meat in a tureen; or the soup alone, and the meat on a dish, gar- nished with some vegetables. The following sauce is much admired, served with the beef:â€”Take half a pint of the soup, and mix it with a spoonful of ketchup, a glass of port wine, a tea-spoonful of made mustard, a little flour, a bit of butter, and salt; boil all together a few minutes, then pour it round the meat. Chop ca- pers, walnuts, red cabbage, pickled cucumbers, and chives or parsley, small, and put in separate heaps over it. To press Beef. Salt a bit of brisket, thin part of the flank, or the tops of the ribs, with salt and saltpetre five days, then boil it gently till extremely tender: put it under a great weight or in a cheese-press, till perfectly cold. It eats excellently cold, and for sandwiches. To make Hunters' Beef. To a round of beef that weighs twenty-five pounds, take three ounces of saltpetre, three ounces of the coar- sest sugar, an ounce of cloves, a nutmeg, half an ounce of allspice, and three handfuls of common salt, all in the finest powder. The beef should hang two or three days: then rub the above well into it, and turn and rub it every day for two or three weeks. The bone must be taken out at first. When to be dressed, dip it into cold water, to take off the loose spice, bind it up tight with tape, and put it into a pan with a tea-cupful of water at the bot- tom, cover the top of the meat with shred suet, and the pan with a brown crust and paper, and bake it five or six hours. When cold, take off the paste and tape.

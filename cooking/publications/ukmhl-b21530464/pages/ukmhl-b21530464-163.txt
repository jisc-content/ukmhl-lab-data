GAME, &C. 101 and roast them about ten minutes. Serve with a good gravy, in the dish. To dress Plovers. Roast the green ones in the same way as woodcocks and quails (see above,) without drawing; and serve on a toast. Grey plovers may be either roasted, or stewed with gravy, herbs, and spice. Plovers' Eggs Are a nice and fashionable dish. Boil them ten mi- nutes, and serve either hot or cold on a napkin. To roast Ortolans. Pick and singe, but do not draw them. Tie on a bird-spit, and roast them. Some persons like bacon in slices tied between them, but the taste of it spoils the flavour of the ortolan. Cover them with crumbs of bread. Guinea and Pea Fowl Eat much like pheasants. Dress them in the same way (seepage 98.) Hares, If properly taken care of, will keep a great time: and even when the cook fancies them past eating, maybe in the highest perfection; which if eaten when fresh-killed they are not. As they are usually paunclied in the field, the cook cannot prevent this; but the hare keeps longer, and eats much better, if not opened for four or five days, or according to the weather. If paunched, as soon as a hare comes in, it should bo wiped quite dry, the heart and liver taken out, and the liver scalded to keep for the stuffing. Repeat this wip- ing every day; mix pepper and ginger, and rub on the inside; and put a large piece of charcoal into it. If the spice is applied early, it will prevent that musty taste which long keeping in the damp occasions, and which also affects the stuffing.

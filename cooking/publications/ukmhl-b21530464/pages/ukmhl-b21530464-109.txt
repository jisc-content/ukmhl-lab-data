BEEF. 47 To dress Ox-cheek another way. Soak half a head three hours, and clean with plenty of water. Take the meat off the bones, and put it into a pan with a large onion, a bunch of sweet herbs, some bruised allspice, pepper, and salt. Lay the bones on the top; pour-on two or three quarts }f water, and cover the pan close with brown paper, or i dish that will fit close. Let it stand eight or ten hourg tn a slow oven; or simmer it by the side of the fire, or m a hot hearth. When done tender put the meat into i clean pan, and let it get cold. Take the cake of fat off, and warm the head in pieces in the soup. Put what vegetables you choose. Marrow-hones. Cover the top with floured cloth; boil them, and serve with dry toast. Tripe May be served in a tureen, stewed with milk and onion till tender. Melted butter for sauce. Or fry it in small bits dipped in butter. Or stew the thin part, cut into hits, in gravy; thicken with flour and butter, and add a little ketchup. Or fricassee it with white sauce. Soused Tripe. Boil the tripe, but not quite tender; then put it into lalt and water, which must be changed every day till it is all used. When you dress the tripe, dip it into a batter of flour and eggs, and fry it of a good brown. Ox-feet, or Cow-heels, May be dressed in various ways, and are very nutritious in all. Boil them; and serve in a napkin, with melted but- ter, mustard, and a large spoonful of vinegar. Or boil them very tender, and serve them as a brown fricassee: the liquor will do to make jelly sweet or relish- ing, and likewise to give richness to soups or gravies.

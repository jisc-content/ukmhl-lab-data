POULTRY. 93 large spoonfuls of cream, to the stew. Salt to 3’our taste. When serving, squeeze in a little lemon. Slices of underdone veal, or rabbit, turkey, &c. make excellent currie.

Roll each piece in a mixture of a large spoonful of flour, and half an ounce of currie-powder. Slice two or three onions; and fry them in butter, of a light brown : then add the meat, and fry all together till the meat begins to brown. Put it all into a stew-pan, and pour boiling water euough just to cover it. Simmer very gently two or three°hours. If too thick, put more water half an hour before serving. If the meat has been dressed before, a little broth will be better than water: but the currie is richer when made of fresh meat. To braise Chickens. Bone them, and fill them with forcemeat. Lay the bones, and any other poultry trimmings, into a stew- pan, and the chickens on them.

Cover the chickens with slices of bacon, and then white paper; cover the whole close, and put them on a slow stove for two hours.

Serve with a brown fricassee of mushrooms. Before glazing, put the chicken into an oven fora few minutes, to give a little colour. jDucks roasted. Serve with a fine gravy : and stuff one with sage and

SICK COOKERY. 311 minutes to cleanse, then put on it a quart of water, sim- mer an hour; when half done, put into it a bit of fresh lemon-peel, and one bit of sugar. If likely to be too thick, you may put another quarter of a pint of water. Lemon-juice may be added if chosen. Lemon Water, a delightful Drink. Put two slices of lemon thinly pared into a tea-pot, a little bit of the peel, and a bit of sugar, or a large spoon • ful of capillaire; pour in a pint of boiling water, and stop it close two hours. Apple Water. Cut two large apples in slices, and pour a quart of boiling water on them; or on roasted apples; strain in two or three hours, and sweeten lightly. Itaspbcrry Vinegar Water. (See page 250.) This is one of the most delightful drinks that can be made. Whey. That of cheese is a very wholesome drink, especially when the cows are in fresh herbage. While Wine Whey. Put half a pint of new milk on the fire; the moment it boils up, pour in as much sound raisin wine as will completely turn it, and it looks clear; let it boil up, then set the sauce-pan aside till the curd subsides, and do not stir it. Pour the whey off, and add to it half a pint of ’ boiling water, and a bit of white sugar. Thus you will have a whey perfectly cleared of milky particles, and as weak as you choose to make it. Vinegar and Icemen Wheys. Pour into boiling milk as much vinegar or lemon- juice as will make a small quantity quite clear, dilute with hot water to an agreeable smart acid, and put a bit or two of sugar. This is less heating than if made of wine ; and if only to excite perspiration, answers as well.

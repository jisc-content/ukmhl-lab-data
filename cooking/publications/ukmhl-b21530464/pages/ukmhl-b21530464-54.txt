lii OBSERVATIONS FOR THE the four quarters are thus removed, take off the merrythought from a, and the neck-bones; these last by putting in the knife at c, and pressing it under the long broad part of the bone in the line c, b; then lift it up, and break it off from the part that sticks to the breast. 1 he next things is,' to divide the breast from the carcase, by cutting through the tender ribs, close to the breast, right down to the tail. Then lay the back upwards, put your knife into the bone half-way from the neck to the rump, and, on raising the lower end, it will separate readily. Turn the rump from you, and very neat- ly take off the two sidesmen, and the whole will be done. As each part is taken off, it should be turned neatly on the dish, and care should be taken that what is left goes properly from table. ' i> The breast and wings are looked upon as the best parts, but the legs are most juicy in young fowls. After all, more advan- tage will be gained by observing those who carve well, and a little practice, than by any written directions whatever. A Pheasant.—The bird In the annexed engraving is as trussed for the spit, with its head under one of its wings. When the skew- ers are taken out, and the bird served, the following is the way to carve it:— Fix your fork in the cen- tre of the breast; slice it down in the lines a, 6; take off the leg on one side in the dotted line 6, d; then cut off the wing on the same side, in the line c, d. Separate the leg and wing on the other side, and then cut off the slices of breast you divided be- fore. Be careful >>ow y~'J

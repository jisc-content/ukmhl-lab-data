They may be stuffed with a fine forcemeat made with veal, bacon, &c. and then they will eat excellently. If a high flavour is ap- proved of, add mace, allspice, and a little Cayenne, be- fore baking.

Game ought not to be thrown away even when it has been kept a very long time; for when it seems to be spoiled it may often be made fit for eating, by nicely cleaning it, and washing with vinegar and water. If there is danger of birds not keeping, draw', crop and pick them; then wash in tw'o or three waters, and rub them with salt. Have ready a large sauce-pan of boil- ing water, and plunge them into it one by one; drawing them up and down by the legs, that the water may pass through them. Let them stay five or six minutes in ; then hang them up in a cold place. When drained, pepper and salt the insides well. Before roasting, wash them well. The most delicate birds, even grouse, may be pre- served thus. Those that live by suction cannot be done this way, as they are never drawn; and perhaps the heat might make them worse, as the w’ater could not pass through them; but they bear being high. Lumps of charcoal put about birds and meat will preserve them from taint, and restore what is spoiling. • Pheasants and Partridges. Roast them as turkey; and serve with a fine gravy

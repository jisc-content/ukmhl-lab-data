DIRECTIONS TO SERVANTS. 527 locks and finger-plates of doors. When the plate is quite dry, it must be rubbed bright with leather. This is a very nice mode. In many plate-powders there is a mixture of quicksilver, which is very injurious; and, among other disadvantages, it makes silver so brittle, that from a fall it will break. To dean Looking-glasses. Remove the lly-stains, and other soil, by a damp rag; then polish with woollen cloth and powder blue. To preserve Gilding, and dean it. It is not possible to prevent flies from staining the gilding without covering it; before which, blow off the light dust, and pass a feather or clean brush over it: then with stripes of paper cover the frames of your glasses, and donâ€™t remove it till the flies are gone. Linen takes off the gilding, and deadens its bright- ness ; it should therefore never be used for wiping it. Some means should be used to destroy the flies, as they injure furniture of every kind, and the paper like- wise. Bottles hung about with sugar and vinegar, or beer, will attract them ; or fly-water put into little shells placed about the room, but out of the reach of children. To dean Paint. Never use a cloth, but take off the dust with a little long-haired brush, after blowing off the loose parts with the bellows. With care, paint will look well for a length of time. When soiled, dip a sponge or a hit of flannel into soda and water, wash it off quickly, and dry imme- diately, or the strength of the soda will eat out the colour. When wainscot requires scouring, it should be done from the top downwards, and the soda be prevented from running on the unclean part as much as possible, or marks will be made which will appear after the whole is finished. One person should dry with old linen as fast as tne other has scoured off the dirt and washed the soua off.

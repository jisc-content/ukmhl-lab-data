DOMESTIC COOKERY. 134 To make Sprats taste like Anchovies. Salt them well, and let the salt drain from them. In twenty-four hours wipe them dry, but donâ€™t wash them. Mix. four ounces of common salt, an ounce of bay salt, an ounce of saltpetre, a quarter of an ounce of sal pru- nel, and half a tea-spoonful of cochineal; all in the finest powder. Sprinkle it among three quarts of the fish, and pack them in two stone jars. Keep in a cold place, fastened down with a bladder. These are pleasant on bread and butter; but use the best for sauce. Forcemeat, Whether in the form of stuffing-balls, or for patties, makes a considerable part of good cooking, by the fla- vour it imparts to whatsoever dish it is added, if pro- perly made. Exact rules for the quantity cannot easily be given; but the following observations may be useful, and habit will soon give knowledge in mixing it to the taste. At many tables, where every thing else is well done, it is common to find very bad stuffing. According to what it is wanted for, should be the se- lection from the following list, observing that of the most pungent articles, least must be used. No one fla- vour should predominate greatly; yet, if several dishes be served the same day, there should be a marked va- riety in the taste of the forcemeat, as well as of the gra- vies. It should be consistent enough to cut with a knife, but not dry and heavy. Forcemeat Ingredients. Cold fowl or veal. Scraped ham. Fat bacon. Beef-suet. Crumbs of bread. Parsley. Oysters. Anchovy.

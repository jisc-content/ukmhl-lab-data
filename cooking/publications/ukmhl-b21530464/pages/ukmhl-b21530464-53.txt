li MISTRESS OF A FAMILY. This ivav can only be practised when the hare is young; if old. do not divide it down, which will require a strong arm, but put the knife between the leg and back, and give it a little turn inwards at the joint, which you must endeavour to hit, and not to break by force. When both legs are taken off, there is a fine collop on each side the back; then divide the back into as many pieces as you please, and take oil^ the shoulders, which are by inanv preferred, and are called the sportsmans pieces. When every one is helped, cut off the head, put vour knife between the upper and lower jaw, and divide them, which will enable you to lay the upper Hat on your plate. then put the point of the knife into the centre, and cut the ).cad into two. The ears and brams may be helped then to those WCarve*Rabbits as directed the latter way for hare: cutting the back into two pieces, which, with the legs, are the prime. A Fowl. A boiled fowl’s legs are bent inwards, and tucked into the belly; but, before it is served, the skewers are to be removed. Lay the fowl on your plate, and place the joints, as cut off, on the dish. Take the wing off in the direction of a tab, only dividing the joint with your knife. and then with your fork lift up the pinion, and draw the wing towards the legs, and the muscles will separate in a more com- plete form than if cut. Slip the koitebetwern the lcSa'" body, and cut to the bone; then with the fork turn the leg back, and the ioint will civ« way if the bird is not old. VS hen

164 DOMESTIC COOKERY. a large stewpan of boiling water; make the dough into balls, the size of a middling apple; throw them in, and boil twenty minutes. If you doubt when done enough, stick a clean fork into one, and if it come out clear, it is done. The way to eat them is to tear them apart on the top with two forks, for they become heavy by their own steam. Eat immediately with meat, or sugar and but- ter, or salt. A Charlotte. Cut as many very thin slices of white bread as will cover the bottom and line the sides of a baking-dish, but first rub it thick with butter. Put apples, in thin slices, into the dish, in layers, till full, strewing sugar between, and bits of butter. In tbe mean time, soak as many thin slices of bread as will cover the ^vliole, in warm milk, over which lay a plate, and a weight to keep the bread close on the apple. Bake slowly three hours. To a middling-sized dish use half a pound of butter in the whole. Common Pancakes. Make a light batter of eggs, Hour, and milk. Fry in a small pan, in hot dripping or lard. Salt, or nutmeg, and ginger, may be added. Sugar and lemon should be served to eat with them. Or, when eggs are scarce, make the batter with flour, and small beer, ginger, &c.; or clean snow, with flour, and a very little milk, will serve as well as egg. Fine Pancakes, fried without Butter or Lard. Beat six fresh eggs extremely well; mix, when strain- ed, with a pint of cream, four ounces of sugar, a glass of wine, half a nutmeg grated, and as much flour as will make it almost as thick as ordinary pancake batter, but not quite. Heat the frying-pan tolerably hot, wipe it with a clean cloth; then pour in the batter, to make thin pancakes.

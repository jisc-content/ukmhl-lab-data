BEEF. 37 pungency of the several sorts; let there be a good hand- ful together. Garnish with carrots, turnips, or truffles and morels, or pickles of different colours, cut small, and laid in little heaps separate; chopped parsley, chives, beet-root, &c. If, when done, the gravy is too much to fill the dish, take only a part to season for serving, but the less water the better; and to increase the richness, add a few beef-bones and shanks of mutton in stewing. A spoonful or two of made mustard is a great im- provement to the gravy. Rump roasted is excellent; but in the country it is generally sold whole with the edgebone, or cut across instead of lengthways as in London, where one piece is for boiling, and the rump for stewing or roasting. This must be attended to, the whole being too large to dress together. Stewed Rump another way. Half roast it; then put it into a large pot with three pints of wTater, one of small-beer, one of port wine, some salt, three or four spoonfuls of vinegar, two of ketchup, a bunch of sweet herbs of various kinds (such asburnet, tarragon, parsley, thyme, basil, savoury, pen- nyroyal, marjoram, knotted marjoram, and a leaf or two of sage,) some onions, cloves, and Cayenne ; cover it close, and simmer till quite tender; two or three hours will do it. When done lay it into a deep dish, set it over hot water, and cover it close. Skim the gravy ; put in a few pickled mushrooms, truffles, morels, and oysters if agreeable, but it is very good without; thicken the gravy with flour and butter, and heat it with the above, and pour over the beef. Forcemeat-balls of veal, anchovies, bacon, suet, herbs, spice, bread, and eggs, to bind, are a great improvement. To stew Brisket of Beef. Put the part that has the hard fat into a stew-pot

Strain off the liquor from the oysters, and throw them into cold water to take off the grit, while you simmer the liquor with a bit of mace and lemon-peel; then put the oysters in, stew them a few minutes, and a little cream if you have it, and some butter rubbed in a bit of flour; let them boil up once ; and have rump-steaks, well seasoned and broiled, ready for throwing the oys- ter-sauce over, the moment you are to serve.

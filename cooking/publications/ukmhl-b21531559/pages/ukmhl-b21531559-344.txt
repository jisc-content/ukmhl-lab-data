^96 DOMESTIC COOKERY. WHITE LEMON-CREAM Is made the same as the above ; only put the whites of the eggs in lieu of the yolks, whisking it extremely well to froth. VANILLA CREAM. Boil half a stick of vanilla in a quarter of a pint of new milk until it has a very high flavour; have ready a jelly of an ounce of isinglass to a pint of water, which mix with the milk, and a pint and a quarter of fine cream; sweeten with fine sugar unbroken, and stir till nearly cold ; then dip a mould into cold water, and pour the whole into it. Make it the day before it is wanted. IMPERIAL CREAM. Boil a quart of cream with the thin rind of a lemon, then stir it till nearly cold; have ready in a dish or bowl that you are to serve in, the juice of three lemons strained with as much sugar as will sweeten the cream ; which pour into the dish from a large tea-pot, holding it high, and moving it about to mix with the juice. It should be made at least six hours before it be served, and will be still better if a day. ALMOND CREAM. Beat four ounces of sweet almonds, and a few bitter, in a mortar, with a tea-spoonful of water to prevent oiling, both having been blanched. Put the paste to a quart of cream, and add the juice of three lemons sweetened ; beat it up with a whisk to a froth, which take off on the shallow part of a sieve 5 fill glasses with some of the liquor and the froth.

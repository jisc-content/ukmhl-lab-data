I’OKK. 113 hams as long as they will bear, before you put them into the pickle 5 and sprinkle them with coarse sugar m a pan, from which they must drain. Rub the hams &c., well with the pickle, and pack them in close ■ putting as much as the pan will hold, so that the pickle may cover them. The pickle is not to be boiled hrst. A small ham may lie fourteen days, a large one three weeks j a tongue tw'elve days, and beef in pro- portion to its size. They will elit well out of the pickle without drying. When they are to be dried, let each piece be drained over the pan : and when it "will drop no longer, take a clean sponge and dry it thoroughly. Six or eight hours will smoke them, and there should be only a little saw-dust and w'et straw burnt to do this 3 but if jjut into a baker’s chimney, sew them in coarse cloth, and hang them a week.

If long hung, put the ham into water a night 3 and let it lie either in a hole dug in the earth, or on damp stones sprinkled with water, tw'o or three days, to mellow3 covering it with a hea\*y tub, to keep vermin from it. Wash well, and put it into a boiler with plenty of w'ater ■ let it simmer four, five, or six hours, according to the size. When done enough, if before the time of serving, cover it with a clean cloth doubled, and keep the dish hot over boiling water. Take off the skin, and stre^v raspings over the ham.

Preserve the skin as whole as possible, to keep over the ham when cold, which will j)revent its drying,-. y O EXCELLENT BACON. 13i\ ide the hog, and take the chine out: it is common to remove the spare-ribs, but the bacon,will be pre- served better from being rusty if they are left in. Salt the bacon six days, then drain it from that first pickle : mix as much salt as you judge proper w ith eight ounces of bay-salt, three ounces of saltpetre, and a pound of coarse sugar, to each hog; but first cut off the hams,, L 3

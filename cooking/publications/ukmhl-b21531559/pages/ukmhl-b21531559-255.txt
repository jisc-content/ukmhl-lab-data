SAVOURY PIKS. "07 asparagus cut small and heaped upon the top, and a white sauce round. In fact, a clever cook, by em- ploying different flavouring ingredients, either sweet or savoury, may make endless dishes of brioche. It should not, however, predominate, as is the case at some tables. It is advisable to make only a small quantity at a time, w'bere the consumption of the family is not great, because it will not keep long. S.WOURY PIES.

There are few articles of cookery more generally liked than relishing pies, if properly made; and they may be made so of a great variety of things. Some are best eaten when cold, and, in that case, there .should be no suet put into the forcemeat that is used with them. If the pie is either made of meat that will take more dressing, to make it extremely tender, than the baking of the crust will allow; or if it is to be served in an earthen pie form ; observe the follow- ing preparation : Take three pounds of the veiny piece of beef (for instance) that has fat and lean ; wash it; and season it with salt, pepper, mace, and allspice, in fine powder, rubbing them well in. Set it by the side of a slow fire, in a stew-pot that will just hold it; put to it a piece of butter, of about the weight of two ounces, and cover it quite close; let it just simmer in its owm steam till it begins to shrink. When it is cold, add more seasoning, forcemeat, and eggs, and, if it is in a dish, put some gravy to it before baking; but if it is only in crust, don't put the gravy till after it is cold and in jelly, as has been described in page 177. Forcemeat may be put both tinder and over the meat, if preferred to balls.

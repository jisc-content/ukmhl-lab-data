Mix the juice of three Seville oranges, three eggs well beaten, a pint of cream, a little nutmeg and cin- namon, and sweeten to your taste.

Set one pint and a half of thin cream over the fire, leaving out a tea-cupful, put in six or eight bitter almonds, and oz. isinglass, previously dissolved in a bason with boiling water enough to cover it; simmer for three quarters of an hour, or till the isinglass is all dissolved. Mix smoothly into the cold cream a table- spoonful of ground rice, pour it into the hot cream, stirring all the time, and let it simmer gently till it thickens sufficiently. Flavour with two table-spoons- ful of orange-flower, or rose-water, or whatever may be preferred. Strain through a coarse hair sieve, and keep stirring till nearly cold, when pour it into cups which have been dipped into cold water. Let these stand in a cool place j when firm, turn them out on a dish, stick them with blanched almonds sliced, and garnish with preserved cucumber, citron, or any pre- serve you like; when about to serve, pour a little cold cream into the dish.

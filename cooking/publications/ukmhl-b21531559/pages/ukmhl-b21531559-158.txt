DOMESTIC COOKERY. J14 Rub the salts well in, and turn it every day for a month. Drain, and smoke it a few days j or dry with- out, by hanging in the kitchen, not near the fire. THE MANNER OF CURING WILTSHIRE BACON. Sprinkle each flitch with salt, and let the blood drain olT for twenty-four hours: then mix a pound a-nd a half of coarse sugar, the same quantity of bay-salt, not quite so much as half a pound of saltpetre, and a pound of common salt; and rub this well on the bacon, turning it every day for a month : then hang it to dry, and afterw-ards smoke it ten days. This quantiy of salts is sufficient for the whole hog. MUTTON. OBSERVATIONS ON KEEPING AND DRESSING MUTTON. Take away the pipe that runs along the bone of the inside of a chine of mutton 5 and if to be kept a great time, rub the part close round the tail with salt, after first cutting out the kernel. The kernel in the fat on the thick part of the leg should be taken out by the butcher, for it taints first there. The chine and rib-bones should be wiped every day; and the bloody part of the neck be cut off, to preserve it. The brisket changes first in the breast ; and, if it is to be kept, it is best to rub it with a little salt, should the weather be hot. Every kernel should be taken out of all sorts of meat as soon as brought in; then wipe dry. For roasting, it should hang as long as it will keep, the hind-quarter especially, but not so long as to taint; for, whatever fashion may authorize, putrid juices ought not to be taken into the stomach. Mutton for boiling will not look of a good colour if It has hung long. Great care should be taken to preserve by paper the fat of w hat is roasted.

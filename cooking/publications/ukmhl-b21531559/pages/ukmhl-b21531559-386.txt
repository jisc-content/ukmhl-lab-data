DOMESTIC COOKEKY. 338 TO PRESERVE STRAWBERRIES IN WINE. Put a quantity of the finest large strawberries into a gooseberry-bottle, and strew in three large spoons of fine sugar; fill up with Madeira wine, or fine sherry. A RICH WAV OF PRESERVING STRAWBERRIES. In picking the strawberries reserve the largest kinds; then boil the smaller ones, allowing three quarters of a pound of fine sugar to a pound of fruit; stir it while boiling, and make it into jam. Then make a fine syrup of sugar, and boil the largest strawberries in it, taking great care that they should be kept sepa- rate, and not break. Take them out, and put them into small preserving-pots ; then boil the syrup and jam together until it is very rich, or make it into a jelly by straining it, and pour it on the strawberries when nearly cold. STRAWBERRY JAM. Gather fine scarlet strawberries, just ripe, bruise, and put them into a preserving pan, with about a fifth part of red currant juice ; strew over nearly their weight of sifted lump sugar, and boil quickly fifteen minutes. TO DRY CHERRIES WITH SUGAR. Stone six pounds of Kentish; put them into a pre- serving-pan, with two pounds of loaf sugar pounded and strewed among them; simmer till they begin to shrivel; then strain them from the juice; lay them on a hot hearth, or in an oven, when either is cool enough to dry without baking them. The same syrup will do another six pounds of fruit.

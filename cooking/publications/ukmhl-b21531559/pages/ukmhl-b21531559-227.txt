PART V. ♦ SAUCES, &c. A VERY GOOD SAUCE, ESPECIALLY TO HIDE THE BAD COLOUR OF FOWLS. Cut the livers, slices of lemon in dice, scalded parsley and hard eggs: add salt, and mix them with butter, boil them up, and pour over the fowls. This will do for roast rabbit. WHITE SAUCE FOR FRICASSEE OF FOWLS, RABBITS, WHITE MEAT, FISH, OR VEGETABLES. It is seldom necessary to buy meat for this favourite sauce, as the proportion of that flavour is but small. The water that has boiled fowls, veal, or rabbit 3 or a little broth, that may be in the house j or the feet and necks of chicken, or raw or dressed veal, will suffice. Stew with a little water any of these, with a bit of • lemon-peel, some sliced onion, some white pepper- I corns, a little pounded mace, or nutmeg, and a bunch of sw'eet herbs, until the flavour be good, then strain it, and add a little good cream, a piece of butter, and a little flour: salt to your taste. A squeeze of lemon tniay be added after the sauce is taken off the fire, shaking it well. Yolk of egg is often used in fricassee, d but if you have any cream it is better j and the former I is apt to curdle.

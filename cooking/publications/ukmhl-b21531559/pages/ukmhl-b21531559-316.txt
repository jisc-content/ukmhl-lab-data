DOMKSTIC COOKKRY. 268 TO STEW RED CABBAGE. Slice a small, or half a large, red cabbage, wash and put it into a sauce-pan with pepper, salt, no water but what hangs about it, and a piece of butter. Stew till quite tender ; and when going to serve, add two or three spoonsful of vinegar, and give one boil over the fire. Serve it for cold meat, or with sausages on it. Another way.—Shred the cabbage, wash it, and put it over a slow fire, with slices of onion, pepper, and salt, and a little plain gravy. When quite tender, and a few minutes before serving, add a bit of butter rubbed with flour, and two or three spoonsful of vinegar, and boil up.

Let it stew covered three hours. When it is very tender add a little more broth, salt, pepper, and a table-spoonful of pounded sugar. Mix these well, and boil them till all the liquor is wasted ; then put it into the dish, and lay fried sausages on it. MUSHROOMS.

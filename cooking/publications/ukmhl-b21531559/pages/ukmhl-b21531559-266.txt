218 DOMESTIC COOKERY A VOL-AU-VENT. The Brioche paste is the best adapted for this pur- pose , bake it with a piece of bread, to preserve the shape, or round a mould, and pour into it a rich mix- ture of boned chicken, sweetbreads cut in pieces, cocksâ€™-combs, &c., previously stewed in rich white sauce; make a little of the paste into small balls, or bean-shaped pieces, boil them in the gravy, and lay them on the top with leaves and flowers of the crust baked. VOL-AU-VENT OF VEAL. Cut veal into thin pieces the size of half-a-crown, beat them, and fry them a pale brown j make some forcemeat and egg balls, fry the former, put the whole into a rich brown gravy, and serve it up. VEGETABLE PIE. Scald and blanch some broad beans ; cut young carrots, turnips, artichoke-bottoms, mushrooms, peas, onions, lettuce, parsley, celery, or any of them you have ; make the whole into a nice stew, with some good veal-gravy. Bake a crust over a dish, with a little lining round the edge, and a cup turned up to keep it from sinking. When baked, open the lid, and pour in the stew. PARSLEY PIE. Lay a fowl, or a few bones of the scrag of veal, seasoned, into a dish ; scald a colander-full of picked parsley in milk ; season it; and add it to the fowl or meat, with a tea-cupful of any sort of good broth, or weak gravy. When it is baked, pour it into a quarter of a pint of cream scalded, with the size of a walnut of butter, and a bit of flour. Shake it round, to mix with the gravy already in.

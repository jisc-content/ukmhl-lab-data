63 M EAT. ^’'eal and mutton should have a little paper put over the fat to preserve it. If not fat enough to allow for basting, a little good dripping answers as well as butter. The cook should be careful not to run the spit through the best parts ; and should observe that it be well cleaned before and at the time of serving, or a black stain appears on the meat. In many joints the spit will pass into the bones, and run along them for some distanc;e, so as not to injure the prime of the meat: and the cook should have leaden skewers to balance it ■with ; for want of which, ignorant servants are often troubled at the time of serving. In roasting meat it is a very good way to put a little salt and water into the dripping pan, and haste for a little while with this, before using its own fat or dripping. ^Vhen dry, dust it with Hour, and baste as usual. Salting meat before it is put to roast draws out the gravy • it should only be sprinkled w'hen almost done. Time, distance, basting often, and a clear fire of a proper size for what is required, are the first articles of a good cook’s attention in roasting. Old meats do not require so much dressing as voung; not that they are sooner done, but they can be eaten with the gravy more in. A piece of writing paper should be twisted round the bone at the knuckle of a leg or shoulder of lamb, mutton, or venison, when roasted, before they are served. When you wdsh fried things to look as well as pos- sible, do them twice over with egg and crumbs. Bread that is not stale enough to grate quite fine will not look well. The fat you fry in must always be boiling hot the moment the fish, meat, &c., are put in, and kept so till finished j a small quantity never fries well. To keep meat hot.—It is best to take it up when done, though the company may not be come 5 set the dish over a pan of boiling water, put a deep cover over it so as not to touch the meat, and then throw a cloth over that. This way will not dr\' up the gra\w. G 2

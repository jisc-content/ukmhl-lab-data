DOMESTIC COOKERY. 188 GOOSEBERRY SAUCE. Cut off the tops and tails of a breakfast-cupful of gooseberries ; scald them a few minutes, then stir them into melted butter.—Or: mash the gooseberries after they are scalded, sweeten to taste, and serve, without butter. CUCUMBER SAUCE. Pare the cucumbers, slice, and cut them in small pieces, stew them in thin broth or melted butter; when boiled tender enough, press them through a sieve into melted butter, stir, and heat it up. This may be seasoned with mace, nutmeg, lemon-peel, and finely grated ham. But a dish of stewed cucumbers answers the purpose. LEMON SAUCE. Cut thin slices of lemon into very small dice, and put them into melted butter ■, give it one boil, and pour it over boiled fowls. CARRIER SAUCE FOR MUTTON. Chop six shalots fine ; and boil them up with a gill of gravy, a spoonful of vinegar, some pepper and salt. Serve in a boat. QUEEN Mary’s sauce for a shoulder of mutton. Let a well-fed shoulder hang till tender. When three parts roasted, put a soup-plate under it, with three spoonsful of hot water, the same of port, a shalot, an anchovy chopped fine, and a little pepper ; baste the meat with this, and the gravy that drops from it. When the mutton is taken up, turn the in- side upwards, score it various ways, pour the gravy over, and cover it with a quantity of fried crumbs of bread.

120 DOMKSTIC COOKFRY. MUTTON STKAKS should be cut from a loin or steak that has hung ; if a neck, the bones should not be long. They should be broiled on a clear fire, seasoned when half done, and often turned ; take them up into a very hot dish, rub a bit of butter on each, and serve hot and hot the moment they are done. STEAKS OF MUTTON, OR LAMB, AND CUCUMBERS, Quarter cucumbers, and lay them into a deep dish, sprinkle them Avith salt, and pour vinegar over them. Fry the chops of a fine brown, and put them into a stew-pan j drain the cucumbers, and put over the steaks 5 add some sliced onions, pepper, and salt; pour hot water or weak broth on them j stew and skim well. MUTTON STEAKS MAINTENON. Half fry, stew them while hot with herbs, crumbs, and seasoning ; put them in paper immediately, and finish on the gridiron. Be careful the paper does not catch : rub a bit of butter on it first to prevent that. MUTTON SAUSAGES. Take a pound of the rawest part of a leg of mutton that has been either roasted or boiled j chop it ex- tremely small, and season it with pepper, salt, mace, and nutmeg; add to it six ounces of beef-suet, some sweet herbs, two anchovies, and a pint of oysters, all chopped A^ery small ; a quarter of a pound of grated bread, some of the anchovy-liquor, and the yolks and whites of tAvo eggs well beaten. Put it all, Avhen Avell mixed, into a little pot j and use it by rolling it into balls, or sausage-shape, and frying. If approved, a little shalot may be added, or garlick, Avhich is a great improvement. TO DRESS MUTTON RUMPS AND KIDNEY.

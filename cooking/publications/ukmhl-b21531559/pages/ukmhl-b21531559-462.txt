414 DOMESTIC COOKEKY. RICE CAUDLE. When the water boils, pour into it some grated rice mixed with a little cold water; when of a proper con- sistence, add sugar, lemon-peel, and cinnamon, and a glass of brandy to a quart. Boil all smooth. Another.—Soak some Carolina rice in water an hour, strain it, and put two spoonsful of the rice into a pint and a quarter of milk j simmer till it will pulp through a sieve, then put the pulp and milk into the sauce-pan, with a bruised clove and a bit of white sugar. Sim- mer ten minutes j if too thick, add a spoonful or two of milk, and serve with thin toast. TO MULL WINE. Boil some spice in a little water till the flavour is gained, then add an equal quantity of port, some sugar and nutmeg j boil together, and serve with toast. Another way.—Boil a bit of cinnamon and some grated nutmeg a few minutes, in a large cupful of water j then pour to it a pint of port wine, and add sugar to your taste : heat it up and it will be ready. Or it may be made of good British wine. TO MAKE COFFEE. Put two ounces of fresh ground coffee, of the best quality, into a coffee-pot, and pour eight coffee-cups of boiling water on it j let it boil six minutes, pour out a cupful two or three times, and return it again ; then put two or three isinglass chips into it, and pour one large spoonful of boiling water on it; boil it five minutes more, and set the pot by the fire to keep hot for ten minutes, and you will have coffee of a beautiful clearness. Fine cream should always be served with coffee, and either pounded sugar-candy, or fine Lisbon sugar.

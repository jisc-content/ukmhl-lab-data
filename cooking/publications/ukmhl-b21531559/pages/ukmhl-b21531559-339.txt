Boil a quart of new milk with a large piece of cin- namon ; thicken it with flour of rice, first wetted with cold milk, and sweeten to your taste. Pour it into a dish; and when cold cut it into the shape of a star, or any other shape you please. Take out the spare rice, and fill the iijtervals with boiled custard.

Put the fruit into a stone jar, and some good Lisbon sugar; set the jar on a stove, or in a sauce-pan of water over the fire; if the former, a large spoonful of water should be added to the fruit. When it is done enough to pulp, press it through a colander; have ready a sufficient quantity of new milk, and a tea-cup of raw cream, boiled together; or an egg instead of the latter, and left to be cold ; then sweeten it pretty well with fine Lisbon sugar, and mix the pulp by degrees with it.

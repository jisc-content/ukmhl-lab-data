303 SWKET DISHES. mix with a tea-cupful of water, in which a bit of beet- root has been boiled, and run it through the bag when all the rest is run out j and this is to garnish the other jelly, being cooled on a plate ; but this is a matter of choice. This jelly has a very fine high colour and flavour. ORANGE JELLY.

Have ready a quart of isinglass jelly made with two ounces; put to it the syrup, and boil it once up; strain off the jelly, and let it stand to settle as above, before it is put into the mould. • FRUIT IN JELLY. Put into a basin half a pint of clear calf’s-foot jelly; and when it has become stiff, lay in three fine peaches, and a bunch of grapes with the stalk upwards : over which put a few vine-leaves, and fill up the bowl with jelly. Let it stand till next day, and then set the bowl in hot water up to the brim for a minute j then turn it out carefully on a dish. HARTSHORN JELLY. Simmer eight ounces of hartshorn shavings with two quarts of water to one 5 strain it, and boil it with the rinds of four China oranges and two lemons pared thin; when cold, add the juice of both, half a pound of sugar, and the whites of six eggs beaten to a froth : let the jelly have three or four boils without stirring, and strain it through a jelly bag. 2 D 2

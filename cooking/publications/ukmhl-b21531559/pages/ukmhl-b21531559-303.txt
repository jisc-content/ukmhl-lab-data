255 I’ASTKY. rOTATOE TASTY, Boil, peel, and mash potatoes as fine as possible; mix them with salt, pepper, and a good bit of butter. Make a paste; roll it out thin like a large puff, and put in the potatoe ; fold over one half, pinching the edges. Bake in a moderate oven. CHEAP AND E.XCELLENT CUSTARDS. Boil three pints of new milk, with a bit of lemon- peel, a bit of cinnamon, two or three bay-leaves, and sweeten it. Meanwhile rub down smooth a large spoonful of rice-flour into a cup of cold milk, and mix with it two yolks of eggs well beaten. Take a bason of the boiling milk, and mix with the cold, and then pour that to the boiling j stirring it one way till it begins to thicken, and is just going to boil up ; then pour it into a pan, stir it sometime, add a large spoon- ful of peach-water, two tea-spoonsful of brandy, or a little ratafia. Marbles boiled in custard, or any thing likely to burn, will, by shaking them in the sauce-pan, jirevent it from catching. RICHER CUSTARD. Boil a pint of milk with lemon-peel and cinnamon ; mix a pint of cream, and the yolks of five eggs w'ell beaten ; when the milk tastes of the seasoning, sweeten it enough for the whole; pour it into the cream, stirring it well; then give the custard a simmer till of a proper thickness. Don’t let it boil; stir the whole time one way ; season as above. If to be extremely rich, put no milk, but a quart of cream to the eggs. z 2

133 POULTRY. TO TRUSS GEESE AND DUCKS. Having j)icked and stubbed the goose clean, cut the feet off at the joint, and the pinion off at the first Joint. Then cut off the neck almost close to the back ; but leave the skin of the neck long enough to turn over the back. l*ull out the throat and tie a knot at the end. With the middle finger loosen the liver and other matters at the breast end, and cut it o[)en between the vent and the rump. Having done this, draw out all the entrails, excepting the soul. \\â€™ipe it out clean with a wet cloth, and beat the breast-bone flat with a rolling-{)in. Tut a skewer into the wing, and draw the legs close u]). Put the skewer through the middle of the leg, and through the body, and the same on the other side. Put another skewer in the small of the leg, tuck it close down to the sidesman, run it through, and do the same on the other side. Cut off the end of the vent, and make a hole large enough for the passage of the rump, as by that means it will much better keep in the seasoning. Ducks are trussed in the same manner, except that the feet must be left on, and turned close to the legs. TO TRUSS PIGEONS. When picked, take off the neck close to the back, then take out the crop, cut off the vent, and draw out the guts and gizzard, but leave the liver, for a pigeon has no gall. If they are to be roasted, cut off the toes, cut a slit in one of the legs, and put the other through it. Draw the leg tight to the pinion, put a skewer through the pinions, legs, and body, and with the handle of the knife brea^ the breast flat. Clean the gizzard, put it under one of the pinions, and turn the points on the back. If you intend to make a pie of them, cut the feet off at the joint, turn the legs, and stick them in the sides close to the pinions. If they are to be stewed or boiled, they must be done in the same manner. N

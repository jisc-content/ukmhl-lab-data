DIRECTIONS FOR CARVINO. 23 for a large party, if you cut the slices clown from pinion to pinion, without making wings, there will be more prime pieces. A Cod’s head.—Fish in general requires very little carving, the fleshy parts being those principally es- teemed. A cod’s head and shoulders, when in season, and properly boiled, is a very genteel and handsome dish. ^V'hen cut, it should be clone with a fish-trowel, and the parts about the back-bone on the shoulders are the most firm and the best. I'ake off a piece quite down to the bone, in the direction a, b, c, d, putting in the spoon at a, c, and with each slice of fish give a piece of the sound, which lies underneath the back- bone and lines it, the meat of which is thin, and a little darker-coloured than the 'nody of the fish itself; this may be got by passing a knife or spoon under- neath, in the direction d,/". About the head are many delicate parts, and a great deal of the jelly kind. The jelly parts lie about the jaw bones, and the firm parts within the head. Some are fond of the palate, and others the tongue, which likewise may be got by putting a spoon into the mouth. Aitch-bone of Beef.—Cut off a slice an inch thick all the length from a to b, in the figure opposite the last page, and then help. The soft fat which resembles marrow lies at the back of the bone, below c; the firm fat must be cut in horizontal slices at the edge of the meat d. It is proper to ask what is preferred, as tastes differ. The skewer that keeps the meat properly together when boiling is here shewn at a. This should be drawn out before it is served up j or, if it is neces- sar)' to leave the skewer in, put a silver one.

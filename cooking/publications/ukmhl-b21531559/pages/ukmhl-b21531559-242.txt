They will not be fit to eat for some months, but are then finely flavoured, and by many preferred to capers. TO MAKE MUSTARD. Mix the best Durham flour of mustard by degrees with boiling water to a proper thickness, rubbing it perfectly smooth; add a little salt, and keep it in a small jar close covered, and put only as much into the glass as will be used soon, which should be w’iped daily round the edges. ANOTHER WAY, FOR IMMEDIATE USE, Mix the mustard with new milk by degrees, to be quite smooth, and add a little raw cream. It is much softer this w'ay, is not bitter, and will keep well. The patent mustard is by many preferred, and it is perhaps as cheap, being always ready; and if the pots are returned, three-pence is allowed for each.

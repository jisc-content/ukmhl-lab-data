SWEETMEATS. 3^5 skin through into four quarters, take off the white of the peel, and pare the other portion very thin. Put them -on the fire with as much water as will cover them ; boil till they are quite tender. Press the juice through a sieve, cut and drain the chips, and, when the sugar boils, put in both, and, after it has boiled about ten minutes, the grated portion also ; let it then boil quickly, till it becomes a jelly. Be careful to keep stirring all the time it is on the fire. ANOTHER WAY. Provide yourself with whatever quantity you wish to preserve of the clearest Seville oranges that can be procured ; cut them in halves, and take out all the pulp and juice, which put into a basin, having pre- viously carefully removed all the seeds and white skin. Boil the rinds in hard water till they are quite soft, changing the water two or three times while boiling â–  then pound them in a marble mortar, having, done which, put them into a preserving-pan with the juice and pulp, and add to it double its weight of sugar. Set the whole over a slow tire, boil it for about half an hour, or a little more, and then put it into a jar, and cover it with a piece of paper steeped in brandy. QUINCE .MARMALADE. Pare and quarter quinces, weigh an equal quantity of sugar; to four pounds of the latter put a quart of water, boil and skim, and have ready against four pounds of quinces are tolerably tender by the follow- ing mode : lay them into a stone jar, with a tea-cup of water at the bottom, and pack them with a little sugar strewed between ; cover the jar close, and set it on a stove or cool oven, and let them soften till the colour becomes red, then pour the fruit-syrup and a quart of quince juice into a preserving-pan, and boil all together till the maraialade be completed, breaking the lumps of fruit with the preserving-ladle.

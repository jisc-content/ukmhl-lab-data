PART VII. VEGETABLES. OBSERVATIONS ON DRESSING VEGETABLES. Vegetables should be carefully cleaned from in- sects, and nicely washed. Boil them in plenty of water, and drain them the moment they are done enough. If overboiled, they lose their beauty and crispness. Bad cooks sometimes dress them with meatj which is wrong, except carrots with boiling beef. TO BOIL vegetables GREEN. Be sure the water boils when you put them in. Make them boil very fast. Donâ€™t cover, but watch them ; and if the water has not slackened, you may be sure they are done when they begin to sink. Then take them out immediately, or the colour will change. Hard water, especially if chalybeate, spoils the colour of such vegetables as should be gieen. To boil them green in hard water, put a tea-spoonful of salt of wormwood into the water when it boilsj before the vegetables are put in.

DOMKSTIC COOKERY. 42^ ORGEAT. Beat two ounces of almonds with a tea-spoonful of orange - flower water, and a bitter almond or two j then pour a quart of milk and water to the paste. Sweeten with sugar, or capillaire. This is a fine drink for those who have a tender chest â– , and in the gout it is highly useful, and, with the addition of half an ounce of gum arabic, has been found to allay the pain- fulness of the attendant heat. Half a glass of brandy may be added if thought too cooling in the latter com- plaints, and the glass of orgeat may be put into a basin of warm water. Another orgeat, for company, is in page 350. ORANGEADE, OR LEMONADE. Squeeze the juice j pour boiling water on a little of the peel, and cover close. Boil water and sugar to a thin syrup, and skim it. When all are cold, mix the juice, the infusion, and the syrup, with as much more water as will make a rich sherbet j strain through a jelly-bag. Or squeeze the juice, and strain it, and add water and capillaire. EGG WINE. Beat an egg, mixw'ith it a spoonful of cold water ; set on the fire a glass of white wine, half a glass of Avater, sugar, and nutmeg. When it boils pour a little of it to the egg by degrees till the whole be in, stirring it wellj then return the whole into the sauce-pan, put it on a gentle fire, stir it one way for not more than a minute} for if it boil, or the egg be stale, it will curdle. Serve with toast. Egg wine may be made as above, without warming the egg, and it is then lighter on the stomach, though not so pleasant to the taste.

151 G AM TO ROAST HARE. After it is skinned, let it be extremely well washed and then soaked an hour or two in water: and if old, lard it 5 which will make it tender, as also will letting it lie in vinegar. If, however, it is put into vinegar, it should be exceedingly well washed in water after- wards. Put a large relishing stuffing into the belly, and then sew it up. Baste it well with milk till half done, and afterwards with butter. If the blood has settled in the neck, soaking the part in warm water, and putting it to the fire warm, will remove it; especially if you also nick the skin here and there with a small knife, to let it out. The hare should be kept at a dis- tance from the fire at first. Serve with a fine froth, rich grav'y, melted butter, and currant-jelly sauce; th.; gravy in the dish. For stuffing use the liver, an an- chovy, some fat bacon, a little suet, herbs, pepper, salt, nutmeg, a little onion, crumbs of bread, and an egg to bind it all. The ears must be nicely cleaned and singed. They are reckoned a dainty. For the manner of trussing a hare, see plate IX. TO JUG AN OLD HARE. After cleaning and skinning, cut it up; and season it with pepper, salt, allspice, pounded mace, and a little nutmeg. Put it into a jar with an onion, a clove or two, a bunch of sweet herbs, a piece of coarse beef, and the carcase-bones over all. Tie the jar down with a bladder, and leather, or strong paper; and put it into a sauce-pan of water up to the neck, but no higher. Keep the water boiling five hours. When it is to be served, boil the gravy up with a piece of butter and flour ; and if the meat gets cold, warm it in this, but not to boil. BROILED AND HASHED HAKE. The flavour of broiled hare is particularly fine : the legs or wings must be seasoned first; rub with cold butter, and serve very hot.â€”The other parts, Avarmed with gravy and a little stuffing, may be served separately.

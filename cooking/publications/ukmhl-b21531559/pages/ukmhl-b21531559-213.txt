165 SOUPS. g-ood beef-broth made the day before, and stewed till the meat is done to rags. Add cream, vermicelli, and almonds, as will be directed in the ne.\t receipt, and a roll. AN EXCELLENT WHITE SOUP. Take a scrag of mutton, a knuckle of veal after cutting off as much meat as will make collops, two or three shank-bones of mutton nicely cleaned, and a quarter of a pound of very fine undrest lean gammon of bacon, with a bunch of sweet herbs, apiece of fresh lemon-peel, two or three onions, three blades of mace, and a dessert-spoonful of white pepjier 3 boil all in three quarts of water, till the meat falls quite to pieces. Next day take off the fat, clear the jelly from the sedi- ment, and put it into a sauce-pan of the nicest tin. If maccaroni is used, it should be added soon enough to get perfectly tender, after soaking in cold water. V'ermicelli may be added after the thickening, as it re- quires less time to do. Have ready the thickening, which is to be made as follows ;â€”Blanch a quarter of a pound of sweet almonds, and beat them to a paste in a marble mortar, with a spoonful of water to pre- vent their oiling; mince a large slice of drest veal or chicken, and beat with it a piece of stale white bread 3 add all this to a pint of thick cream, a bit of fresh lemon-peel, and a blade of mace, in the finest powder. Boil it a few minutes 3 add to it a pint of soup, and strain and pulp it through a coarse sieve : this thick- ening is then fit for putting to the rest, which should boil for half an hour afterwards. A PLAINER WHITE SOUP. Tw'o or three pints of soup may be made of a small knuckle of veal, with seasoning as directed in the last article 3 and both served together, with the addition of a quarter of a pint of good milk. Two spoonsful of creiun, and a little ground rice, will give it a proper thickness.

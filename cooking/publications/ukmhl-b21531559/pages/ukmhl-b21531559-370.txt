DOMESTIC COOKERY. 322 TO CLARIFY SUGAR FOR SWEETMEATS. Break as much as required in large lumps, and put a pound to half a pint of water, in a bowl, and it will dissolve better than when broken small. Set it over the fire, and the well-whipt white of an egg j let it boil up, and, when ready to run over, pour a little cold water in it to give it a check j but when it rises a second time, take it oflF the fire, and set it by in the pan for a quarter of an hour, during which the foul- ness will sink to the bottom, and leave a black scum on the top, which take off gently with a skimmer, and pour the syrup into a vessel very quickly from the sediment. TO CANDY ANY SORT OF FRUIT. When finished in the syrup, put a layer into a new sieve, and dip it suddenly into hot water, to take off the syrup that hangs about it; put it on a napkin before the fire to drain, and then do some more in the sieve. Have ready sifted double-refined sugar, which sift over the fruit on all sides till quite white. Set it on the shallow end of sieves in a lightly-warm oven, and turn it two or three times. It must not be cold till dry. Watch it carefully, and it will be beautiful. TO PREPARE BARBERRIES FOR TARTLETS. Pick barberries that have no stones from the stalks, and to every pound weigh three quarters of a pound of lump-sugar; put the fruit into a,stone jar, and either set it on a hot hearth or in a sauce-pan of waten and let them simmer very slowly till soft; put them and the sugar into a preserving-pan, and boil them gently fifteen minutes. Use no metal but silver. BARBERRIES IN BUNCHES. Have ready bits of flat white wood, three inches long, and a quarter of an inch wide. Tie the stalks

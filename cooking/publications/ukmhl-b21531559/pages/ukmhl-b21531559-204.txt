DOMESTIC COOKERY. 156 colour of the soup. Soup made thus will have a finer flavour; though it will not make quite so good an ap- pearance as if the meat were not browned. Thickening for soup is made of bread raspings. Biscuit crumbs are also good, and, where biscuits are much consumed, the crumbs ought to be saved for the purpose ; particularly for delicate soup. The thickening most commonly used is made of flour rubbed in butter, or fat skimmings. Flour or meal is easily coloured, by being spread on a plate, and placed in a Dutch oven before the fire. Turn it with a spoon, and let it remain until it has obtained the colour you wish. Keep it covered close, for use. Potatoe flour, a table-spoonful, mixed smooth in a cup of water, will give a nice thickness to soup. Barley and oatmeal, also Indian corn meal, may be used in the same quantity. This thickening should be put in after that scumming has taken place which the vegetables have made necessary. But the French mode of thick- ening soup is superior to any of the above. (See Roux.) Meat for soup should never be drowned at first in water, but put into the kettle with a very small quantity, and a piece of butter, merely to keep the meat from burning until the juices are extracted ; by this means a single pound will afford better and richer soup than treble the quantity saturated with cold water. GENERAL DIRECTIONS RESPECTING SOUPS AND GRAVIES. When there is any fear of gravy-meat being spoiled before it be wanted, season well and fry it lightly, which will preserve it two days longer ; but the gravy is best when the juices are fresh. When soups or gravies are to be put by let them be changed every day into fresh scalded pans. Whatever has vegetables boiled in it is apt to turn sour sooner than the juices of meat. Never keep any gravy, &c., in metal. When fat remains on any soup a tea-cupful of flour and water mixed quite smooth, and boiled in, will take it off.

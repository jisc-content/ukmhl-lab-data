DOMESTIC COOKEKY. 88 peel, a few cloves, a blade of mace, 2 or 3 onions, white pepper, salt, and a little allspice. Simmer very slowly, keeping it covered close. When done, take out the meat, skim off the fat, strain and thicken the gravy, add the juice of a lemon and a glass of white wine, and pour it hot over the veal, holding back the sediment.

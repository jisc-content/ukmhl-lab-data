DOMKSTIC COOKEBY. 394 Anolher way.—Make a rich custard without sugar, boiling lemon-peel in it. When cold, sift a good deal of sugar over the whole, and brown the top with a salamander. SACK CREAM. Boil a pint of raw cream, the yolk of an egg well beaten, two or three spoonsful of white wine, sugar, and lemon-peel; stir it over a gentle fire, till it be as thick as rich cream, and afterwards till cold; then serve it in glasses, with long pieces of dry toast. BRANDY CREAM. Boil two dozen of almonds blanched, and pounded bitter almonds, in a little milk. When cold, add to it the yolks of five eggs beaten well in a little cream, sweeten, and put to it two glasses of the best brandy ; and when well mixed, pour to it a quart of thin cream j set it over the fire, but don’t let it boil; stir one way till it thickens, then pour into cups, or low glasses, when cold it will be ready. A ratafia-drop may be put in each, if you choose it. If you wish it to keep, scald the cream previously. A very fine ITALIAN CREAM. Whip together a quart of very thick scalded cream, a quart of raw cream, the grated rind of four lemons, and the strained juice, with ten ounces of white pow- dered sugar, one hour; then add half a pint of sweet wine, and continue to whisk it until it becomes quite solid. Lay a piece of muslin in a sieve, and lade the cream upon it with a spoon. In twenty hours turn it carefully out, but mind that it does not break, and garnish it \\ ith a wreath of flowers.

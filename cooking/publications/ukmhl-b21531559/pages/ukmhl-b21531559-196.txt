148 DOMESTIC COOKERY. A VERY CHEAP WAY OF POTTING BIRDS. Prepare them as directed in the last receipt; and when baked and grown cold, cut them into projier pieces for helping, pack them close into a large potting- })ot, and (if possible) leave no spaces to receive the butter. Cover them with butter, and one-third part less will be wanted than when the birds are done whole.â€”The butter that has covered potted things will serve for basting, or for paste for meat pies. TO CLARIFY BUTTER FOR POTTED THINGS. Put it into a sauce-boat, and set that over the fire in a stew-pan that has a little water in. When melted, take care not to pour the milky parts over the potted things : they will sink to the bottom. TO POT MOOR GAME. Pick, singe, and wash the birds nicely: then dry them ; and season, inside and out, pretty high, with pepper, mace, nutmeg, allspice, and salt. Pack them in as small a pot as will hold them, cover them with butter, and bake in a very slow oven. When cold, take off the butter, dry them from tbe gravj% and put one bird into each pot, which should just fit. Add as much more butter as will cover them, but take care that it does not oil. The best way to melt it is by warming it in a bason set in a bowl of hot water. GROUSE. Roast them like fowls ; but the head is to be twisted under the wing. They must not be overdone. Serve with a rich gravy in the dish, and bread-sauce. The sauce for wild fowl, as will be described hereafter under the head of Sauces, may be used instead of common gravy. TO ROAST WILD FOWL. The flavour is best preserved without stuffing. Put pepper, salt, and a piece of butter, into each.

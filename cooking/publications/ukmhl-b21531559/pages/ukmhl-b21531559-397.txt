PRESERVES. 349 supar, and half a pint of water, and, when it has been boiled and well scummed, add the rind of a lemon, and four ounces of scraped ginger. When the syrup is very thick, take it off the fire, and when cold, wipe the cucumbers dry, and put them into the syrup. The syrap should be boiled once in two or three days, for a fortnight, and you may add more to it if necessary. When you pour the syrup upon the cucumbers, be sure that it is cold. Cover close, and keep in a dry place. AUM.\CK PRESERVE. Put into a pan four dozen split plums, t\vo dozen apples, and two dozen pears, pared thin and cored. Boil them without water. When well blended to- gether, and the stones taken out, stir in three pounds of sugar, and boil them an hour. Put it into shallow pans or soup-plates, and dry in the sun or a cool oven. TO KEEP LEMON-JUICE. Buy the fruit when cheap, keep it in a cool place two or three days, if too unripe to squeeze readily ; cut the peel off some, and roll them under your hand to make them part with the juice more readily ; others you may leave unpared for grating, when the pulp shall be taken out and dried. Squeeze the juice into a China basin ; then strain it through some muslin, which will not permit the least to pulp to pass. Have ready half and quarter ounce phials perfectly dry ; fill them with the juice so near the top as only to admit half a tea-spoonful of sweet oil into each ; or a little more, if for larger bottles. Cork the bottles, and set them upright in a cool place. When you want lemon-juice, open such a sized bottle as you shall use in two or three days j wind some clean cotton round a skewer, and dipping it in, the oil be attracted; and when all shall be removed, the iuice will be as fine as when first bottled.

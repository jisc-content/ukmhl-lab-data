DIRECTIONS TO SERVANTS. 443 warm water, and a brush, wash them with a very large sponge and clean water. Both times, observe to leave no spot untouched ; and clean straight up and down, not crossing from board to board ; then dry with clean cloths, rubbing hard up and down in the same way. The tioors should not be often wetted, but very thoroughly when donej and once a week dry-rub bed with hot sand, and a heavy brush the right way of the boards. The sides of stairs or passages on which are carpets, or floor cloth, should be washed with sponge instead of linen or flannel, and the edges will not be soiled. Different sponges should be kept for the two above uses ; and those and the brushes should be well washed when done with, and kept in day places. TO EXTRACT OIL FROM BOARDS OR STONE. Make a strong lye of pearl-ashes and soft water ; and add as much unslacked lime as it will take up; stir it together, and then let it settle a few minutes ; bottle it, and stop close ; have ready some water to lower it as used, and scour the part with it. If the liquor should lie long on the boards, it will draw out the colour of them ; therefore do it with care and expedi- tion. TO CLEAN STONE STAIRS AND HALLS. Boil a pound of pipe-makersâ€™ clay, with a quart of water, a quart of small beer, and put in a bit of stone- blue. Wash with this mixture, and when dry rub the stones with flannel and a brush. TO BLACKEN THE FRONTS OF STONE CHIMNEY-PIECES. Mix oil-varnish with lamp-black, and a little spirit of turpentine to thin it to the consistence of paint.

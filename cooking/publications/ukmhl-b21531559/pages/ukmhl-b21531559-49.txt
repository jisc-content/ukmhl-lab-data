MISCELL'ANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. 19 Soap should be cut with a wire or twine, in pieces that will make a long square when first brought in, and kept out of the air two or three weeks 3 for if it dry quick, it will crack, and when wet, break. Put it on a shelf, leaving a space between, and let it grow hard gradually. Thus, it will save a full third in the consumption. Some of the lemons and oranges used for juice should be pared first to preserve the peel dryj some should be halved, and when squeezed, the pulp cut out, and the outsides dried for grating. If for boiling in any liquid, the first way is best. When these fruits are cheap, a proper quantity should be bought and pre- pared as above directed, especially by those who live in the country, where they cannot always be had 3 and they are perpetually wanted in cookery. When whites of eggs are used for jelly, or other purposes, contrive to have pudding, custard, &c., to employ the yolks also. Should you not w'ant them for several hours, beat them up with a little water, and put them in a cool place, or they will be hardened and useless. It was a mistake of old, to think that the Avhites made cakes and puddings heavy 3 on the con- trary, if beaten long and separately, they contribute greatly to give lightness, are an advantage to paste, and make a pretty dish beaten wdth fruit, to set in cream, &c. If copper utensils be used in the kitchen, the cook should be charged to be very careful not to let the tin be rubbed off 3 and to have them fresh done when the least defect ajipears, and never to put by any soup.

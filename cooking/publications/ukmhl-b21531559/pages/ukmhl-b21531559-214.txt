166 DOMESTIC COOKERY. MACCAHONI SOUP. Boil a pound of the best maccaroni in a quart of good stock till quite tender ; then take out half, and put it into another stew-pot.

Serve it with the crust of a French roll cut into the size of a shilling. A PEPPER-POT, TO BE SERVED IN A TUREEN. To three quarts of water put vegetables according to the season ; in summer, peas, lettuce, and spinach j in winter, carrots, turnips, celery, and onions in both. Cut small, and stew with two pounds of neck of mutton, or a fowl, and a pound of pickled pork, in three quarts of water, till quite tender. On first boiling, skim.

Some people choose very small suet dumplings boiled with it. Should any fat rise, skim nicely, and put half a cup of water with a little flour.

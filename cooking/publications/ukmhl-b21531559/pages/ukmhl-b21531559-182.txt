DOMESTIC COOKERY. 1?.4 TO TRUSS PHEASANTS, PARTRIDGES, &C. Having picked them very clean, cut a slit at the back of the neck, take out the crop, loosen the liver, and gut the breast with the fore finger; then cut olF â–  the vent, and draw them. Cut off the pinion at the first joint, and wipe out the inside with the pinion you have cut off. Beat the breast-bone flat with a rolling-pin, put a skewer in the pinion, and bring the middle of the legs close. Then run the skewer through the legs, body, and the other pin, twist the head, and put it on the end of the skewer, with the bill fronting the breast. Put another skewer into the sidesman, and put the legs close on each side of the apron, and then run the skewer through all. If you wish the cock pheasant to have a handsome appearance on the table, leave the beautiful feathers on the head, and cover them gently with paper to prevent their being injured by the heat of the fire. You may likewise save the long feathers in the tail to stick in the rump when roasted. If they are for boiling, put the legs in the same manner as in trussing a fowl. All kinds of moor-game must be trussed in the same manner. TO TRUSS WILD FOWL. Having picked them clean, cut off the neck close to the back, and, with your middle finger, loosen the liver and guts next the breast. Cut off the pinions at the first joint, then cut a slit between the vent and the rump, and draw them clean. Clean them projierly with the long feathers on the wing, cut off the nails, and turn the feet close to the legs. Put a skewer in the pinion, pull the legs close to the breast, and run the skewer through the legs, body, and the other pinion. First cut off the vent, and then put the rumj) through it. These directions are to be followed in trussing every kincj of wild fowl. TO TRUSS WOODCOCKS AND SNIPES. All these birds are remarkably tender to pick, es- pecially if they should not happen to be quite fresh.

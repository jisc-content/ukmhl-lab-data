Take a lean piece of beef; rub it well with treacle or brown sugar, and let it be turned often. In three days wipe it, and salt it with common salt and salt- petre beaten fine : rub these well in, and turn it every day for a fortnight. Roll it ti^ht in a coarse cloth, and press it under a large w'eight; hang it to dry in a wood-smoke, but turn it upside down every day. Boil it ui pump-water, and press it; it will gra*e or cut into shivers, like Dutch beef. BEEF A-LA-aiODE. Choose a piece of thick flank of a fine heifer or ox.

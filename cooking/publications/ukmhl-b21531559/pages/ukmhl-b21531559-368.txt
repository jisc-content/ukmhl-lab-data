When in a hard cake, wipe it very dry, fold it in fine paper, and then in a linen bag, and keep in a dry but not hot place. When used scrape it fine, and it will make a fine crust, either with or without butter. SWEETMEATS. observations on sweetmeats. Sweetmeats should be kept carefully from the air, and in a very dry place. Unless they have a very small proportion of sugar, a warm one does not hurt; but, when not properly boiled, that is, long enough, but not quick, heat makes them ferment; and damp causes them to grow mouldy. They should be looked at two or three times in the first two months, that they may be gently boiled again, if not likely to keep. It is necessary to observe that the boiling of sugar, more or less, constitutes the chief art of the confec- tioner, and those who are not practised in this know- ledge, and only preserve in a plain way for family use, are not aware that, in two or three minutes, a syi'up over the fire will pass from one gradation to another, called by the confectioners degrees of boiling, of which there are six, and those subdivided. But I am not versed in the minutiae, and only make the observ- ation to guard against under-boiling, which prevents sweetmeats from keepings and quick boiling and long, which brings them to a candy. Attention, without much practice, will enable a person to do any of the following sorts of sweet- meats, &c., and they are as many as will be wanted in a private family; the higher articles of preserved fruits maybe bought at less expense than they can be made.

310 DOMKSTIC COOKERY. CDRRANT OR RASPBERRY WATER ICE. The juice of these, or any other sort of fruit, being gained by squeezing, sweetened and mixed with water, will be ready for iceing. ICE CREAMS. Mix the juice of the fruits with as much sugar as will be wanted, before you add cream, which should be of a middling richness. BROWN BREAD ICE. Grate as fine as possible stale brown bread, soak a small proportion in cream two or three hours, sweeten and ice it. ICE PUNCH, AS USED IN ITALY. Make a rich sherbet, and grate a piece of sugar on a lemon or citron for flavour; then beat the whites of five or six eggs to a froth, and by degrees stir it into the sherbet; add rum and ice, and serve in glasses. ICE RATAFIA CREAM. Blanch a quarter of an ounce of bitter almonds, and beat them with a tea-spoonful of water in a mar- ble mortar; then rub with the paste two ounces of lump-sugar, and simmer ten minutes with a tea-cupful of cream, which add to a quart more of cream, and having strained, ice it.

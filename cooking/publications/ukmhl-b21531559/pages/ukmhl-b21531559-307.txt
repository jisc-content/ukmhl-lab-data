PASTKY. 259 Anotner way.—Blanch and pound four ounces of filinonds, with a little oraiige-Hower, or rose-water j then stir in the yolks of six and whites of three eggs, Avell beaten, five ounces of butter warmed, the peel of a lemon grated, and a little of the juice ; sweeten with fine Lisbon sugar, When well mixed, bake in a deli- cate paste, in small pans. Another way.—Press the whey from as much curd as will make two dozen small cheesecakes ; then put it on the back of a sieve, and with half an ounce of butter rub it through with the back of a spoon ; put to it six yolks, and three whites of eggs, and a few bitter almonds pounded with as much sugar ns will make the curd properly sweet: mix with it the rind of a lemon grated, and a glass of brandy. Put a puff-paste into the pans, and ten minutes will bake them. DOUGH NUTS. Rub a quarter of a pound of butter into a pound of flour, then add five ounces of sugar, two eggs, about a dessert - spoonful of yeast, and sufficient milk to make it into a stiff paste. Let it stand to rise, then roll it out, and cut it into shapes with a paste cutter, and boil the pieces in lard, till they are of a nice brown colour. A TIPSY CAKE. Put a sponge cake into a deep china or glass dish, pour round it some white wine (raisin is very suitable,) and a wine glass of brandy. Let the cake soak up the wine, and then strew sifted sugar over it, and pour in the dish a rich thick custard. Ornament the top of the cake by sticking a light flower in the centre, or bits of clear currant jelly, or blanch and split some sweet almonds, and stick them thickly over the cake.

MEAT. 69 twenty-four hours in winter, and double that time in summer, before being killed. TO SALT BEEF OR PORK FOR E.ATING IMMEDIATELY. The piece should not weigh more than 5 or 6 pounds. Salt it very thoroughly just before you put it into the pot; take a coarse cloth, flour it well, put the meat in, and fold it up close. Put it into a pot of boiling water, and boil it as long as you would any other salt beef of the same size, and it will be as salt as if done four or five days. Great attention is requisite in salting meat; and in the country, where large quantities are cured, this is of particular importance. Beef and pork should be well sprinkled, and a few hours afterwards hung to drain, before it is rubbed with salt; which method, by cleansing the meat from the blood, serves to keep it from tasting strong. It should be turned every day ; and if w'anted soon, should be rubbed as often. A salting-tub or lead may be used, and a cover to fit close. Those who use a good deal of salt meat will find it answer well to boil up the pickle, skim it, and when cold, pour it over meat that has been sprinkled and drained. TO SALT BEEF RED; WHICH IS EXTREMELY GOOD TO EAT FRESH FROM THE PICKLE, OR TO HANG TO DRY. Choose a piece of beef with as little bone as you can (the flank is most proper), sprinkle it and let it drain a day ; then rub it with common salt, saltpetre, and you may add a few grains of cochineal, all in fine, and bay-salt, but only a small proportion of the saltpetre, powder. Bub the pickle every day into the meat for a week, then only turn it. It will be excellent in eight days. In sixteen drain it from the pickle ; and let it be smoked at the oven-mouth when heated w ith wood, or send it to the bakerâ€™s. A few days will smoke it. A little of the coarsest sugar may be added to the sidt. It eats well, boiled tender with greens or carrots. If to be grated as Dutch, then cut a lean bit, boil it till extremely tender, and while hot put it under a press.

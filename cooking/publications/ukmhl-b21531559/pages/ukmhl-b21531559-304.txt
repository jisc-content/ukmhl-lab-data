256 DOMESTIC COOKERY. RAKED CUSTARD. Boil one pint of creaiD, half a pint of milk j with mace, cinnamon, and lemon-peel, a little of each. When cold, mix the yolks of three eggs ; sweeten and make your cups of paste nearly full. Bake them ten minutes. LEMON CUSTARDS. Beat the yolks of eight eggs till they are as white as milk j then put to them a pint of boiling water, the rinds of two lemons grated, and the juice sweet- ened to your taste. Stir it on the fire till thick enough ; then add a large glass of rich wine, and half a glass of brandy ; give the whole one scald, and put it in cups, to be eaten cold. ALMOND CUSTARD. Blanch and beat four ounces of almonds fine with a spoonful of water; beat together a pint of cream and two spoonsful of rose-water, and put them to the yolks of four eggs, and as much sugar as will make it pretty sweet; then add the almonds ; stir the whole iDixture over a slow' fire till it becomes of a proper thickness ; but be careful not to allow it to boil. Pour it into cups. CHEESECAKES. Strain the whey from the curd of two quarts of milk; when rather dry, crumble it through a coarse sieve, and mix with six ounces of fresh butter, one ounce of pounded blanched almonds, a little orange- flower water, half a glass of raisin wine, a grated biscuit, four ounces of currants, some nutmeg, and cinnamon, in fine powder, and beat all the above with three eggs, and half a pint of cream, till quite light; then fill the pattypans three parts full.

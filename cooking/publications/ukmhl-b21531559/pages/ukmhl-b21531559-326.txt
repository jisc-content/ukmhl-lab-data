DOMKSTIC COOKKRY. O-C PICKLED LEMONS. They should be small, and with thick rind j rub them with a piece of flannel; then slit them half down in four quarters, but not through to the pulp: fill the slits with salt hard pressed in, set them upright in a pan for four or five days, until the salt melts; turn them thrice a day in tbeir own liquid, until tender; make enough pickle to cover them, of rape vinegar, the brine of the lemons, Jamaica pepper, and ginger ; boil and skim it; wdien cold, put it to the lemons, with two ounces of mustard-seed, and two cloves of garlic to six lemons. When the lemons are used the pickle will be useful in fish or other sauces. OLIVES Are of three kinds, Italian, Spanish, and French, of different sizes and flavour; each sort should be firm, though some are most fleshy. Preserve tliem from the air. PICKLED ONIONS. In the month of September, choose the small white round onions, take off the brown skin, have ready a very nice tin stew-pan of boiling water, throw in as many onions as will cover the top; as soon as they look clear on the outside, take them up as quick as possible with a slice, and lay them on a clean cloth; cover them close with another, and scald some more, and so on. Let them lie to be cold', then put them in a jar, or glass or wide-mouthed bottles, and pour over them the best white wine vinegar, just hot but not boiling. When cold cover them. Should the outer skin shrivel, peel it off. Ihey must look quite clear.

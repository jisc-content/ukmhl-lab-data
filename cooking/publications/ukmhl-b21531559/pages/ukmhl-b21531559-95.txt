55 FISH. OYSTF.RS. To feed Oysters. Put them into the water, and wash them with a birch-besom till quite clean; then lay them bottom- downwards into a pan, sprinkle with flour or oatmeal and salt, and cover with water. Do the same every day, and they will fatten. The water should be pretty salt. To stew Oysters. Open and separate the liquor from them, then wash them from the grit; strain the liquor, and put with the oysters a bit of mace and lemon-peel, and a few white peppers. Simmer them very gently, and put some cream, and a little flour and butter. Serv'e with sippets. Boiled Oysters eat well. Let the shells be nicely cleaned first 5 and serve in them, to eat with cold butter. To scollop Oysters. Put them with crumbs of bread, pepper, salt, nut- meg, and a bit of butter, into scollop-shells or saucers, and bake before the fire in a Dutch oven. Or, put oysters into scollop-shells, and set them on a gridiron over a good clear fire 5 let them stew till they are done enough, then have ready some crumbs of bread rubbed in a clean napkin, fill the shells, and set them before a good fire, and baste them well with butter. Let them be of a fine brown colour, keeping them turning, to be brown all over alike. A tin oven does them best before the fire. They eat much the best done this way, though many people stew oysters first in a saucepan, with a blade of mace, thickened with a piece of butter, and fill the shells, and then cover them with crumbs, and brown them with a hot iron : but the bread has not the fine taste of the former. Fried Oysters to garnish boiled Fish. Make a batter of flour, milk, and eggs, season it a

FISH. 39 twelve bay-leaves, six blades of mace, and a quarter of an ounce of black pep[)er. When the salmon is boiled enough, drain it and put it on a clean cloth, then put more salmon into the kettle, and pour the liquor upon it, and so on till all is done. After this, if the pickle be not smartly flavoured with the vinegar and salt, add more, and boil it quick three quarters of an hour. \^â€™hen all is cold, pack the fish in something deep, and let there be enough of pickle to plentifully cover. Preserve it from the air. The liquor must be drained from the fish, and occasionally boiled and skimmed. Salmon collared. Split such a part of the fish as may be sufficient to make a handsome roll, wash and wipe it, and, having mixed salt, white pepper, pounded mace and Jamaica pepper, in quantity to season it very high, rub it inside and out well. Then roll it tight and bandage it, put as much water and one-third vinegar as w'ill cover it, wdth bay-leaves, salt, and both sorts of pepper. Cover close, and simmer till done enough. Drain and boil quick the liquor, and put on when cold. Serve with fennel. It is an elegant dish, and extremely good. COD. Some people boil the cod whole; but a large head and shoulders contain all the fish that is proper to help, the thinner parts being overdone and tasteless, before the thick are ready. But the whole fish m.ay be pur- chased at times more reasonably j and the lower half, if sprinkled and hung up, will be in high perfection one or two days. Or it may be made salter, and served with egg-sauce, potatoes, and parsnips. Cod when small is usually very cheap. If boiled quite fresh it is watery; but eats excellenlly if salted and hung up for a day to give it firmness, then stuffed and broiled, or boiled. Cod's Head and Shoulders will eat much finer by hfiving a little salt rubbed down the bone, and along the thick part, even if to be eaten the same day. F. 2

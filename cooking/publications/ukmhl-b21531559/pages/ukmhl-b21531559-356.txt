DOMESTIC COOKERY. 308 TO BUTTER ORANGES, TO BE EATEN HOT. Grate off a little of the outside rind of four Seville oranges, and cut a round hole at the blunt end opposite the stalk, large enough to take out the pulp, and seeds, and juice ; then pick the seeds and skin from the pulp ; rub the oranges with a little salt, and lay them in water for a short time. You are to save the bits cut out. Set the fruit on to boil in fresh water till they are tender, shifting the water to take out the bitter- ness. In the mean time make a thin syrup with fine sugar, and put the oranges into it, and boil them up ; tufning them round, that each part may partake of the syrup, as there need not be enough to cover them, and let them remain in it hot till they are to be served. About half an hour before you want them put some sugar to the pulp, and set over the fire ; mix it well and let it boil j then add a spoonful of white wine for every orange, give it a boil; and then put in a bit of fresh butter, and stir over the fire to thicken ; fill the oranges with it, and serve them with some of the syrup in a dish. Put the bits on the top. WINE ROLL. Soak a penny French roll in raisin wine till it will hold no more ; put it in the dish, and pour round it a pistard or cream, sugar, and lemon-juice. Just before it be served, sprinkle over it some nonpareil comfits; or stick a few blanched slit almonds into it. Sponge biscuits may be used instead of the roll.

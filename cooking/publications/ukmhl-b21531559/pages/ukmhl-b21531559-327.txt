^79 PICKLES. TO PICKLE CUCUMBERS AND ONIONS SLICED. Cut them in slices, and sprinkle salt over them : next day drain them for five or six hours : then put them into a stone jar, pour boiling vinegar over them, and keep them in a warm place. The slices should be thick. Repeat the boiling vinegar, and stop them up again instantly; and so on till green; the last time put pepper and ginger. Keep in small stone jars.

Set them near the fire, covered with plenty of vine- leaves ; if they do not become a tolerably good green, pour the vinegar into another jar, set it over the hot hearth, and when it boils, pour it over them again, covering with fresh leaves ; and thus do till they are of as good a colour as you wish :—but as it is now known that the very fine green pickles are made so by using brass or bell-metal vessels, which, when vinegar IS put into them, become highly poisonous, few people like to eat them.

It must be well skimmed while boiling. Let them soak six days ; then change the brine, and let them stand six more ; then drain them, and pour over them in the jar a pickle of the best white wine vinegar, with a good quantity of pepper, pimento, ginger, mace, cloves, mustard-seed, and horse-radish ; all boiled together, but cold.

235 PLâ€™UUINGS cold, four ounces of sugar, the yolks of four beaten eggs, and a glass of white wine. Pound the apricots in a mortar with some or all of the kernels; mix then the fruit and other ingredients together; put a paste round a dish, and bake the pudding half an hour. BAKED GOOSEBERRY PUDDING. Stew gooseberries in a jar over a hot hearth, or in a sauce-pan of water till they will pulp. Take a pint of the juice pressed through a coarse sieve, and beat it with three yolks and whites of eggs beaten and strained, one ounce and a half of butter; sweeten it well, and put a crust round the dish. A few crumbs of roll should be mixed with the above to give a little consistence, or four ounces of Naples biscuits. A GREEN-BEAN PUDDING. Roil and blanch old beans, beat them in a mortar, with very little pepper and salt, some cream, and the yolk of an egg. A little spinach-juice will give a a finer colour, but it is as good without. Roil it in a basin that will just hold it, an hour ; and pour parsley and butter over. Serve bacon to eat with it. SHELFORD PUDDING. Mix three quarters of a pound of currants or raisins, one pound of suet, one pound of flour, six eggs, a little good milk, some lemon-peel, a little salt. Roil it in a melon-shape six hours. \ BRANDY PUDDING. Line a mould with jar-raisins stoned, or dried cherries, then with thin slices of French roll, next to which put ratafias, or maccaroons; then the fruit.

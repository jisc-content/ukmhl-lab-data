163 SOUPS. AXOTIIER. Put 1 lb, fresh butter, 1*2 onions, 6 eschalots, some sweet and knotted marjoram, sweet basil, lemon thyme, a little suet, pepper, cloves, mace, 3 carrots, a large head of celery, previously fried, a shin of beef, and a hock of ham, into 4 quarts of water, and let it stew slowly until the juices of the meat are ex- tracted. Strain and put it by. When to be used thicken with vermicelli or rice. Skin and cut up a chicken, stew in good gravy, and add it to the souj), with a wine-glassful of soy, a pint of white wine, the juice of two lemons, and 'Z table-spoonsful of chili vinegar. Before you thicken the soup, put in 4 good table-spoonsful.of curry powder mixed smoothly in cold water. MOCK TURTLE SOUP. Take a calfs head with the skin on, and about two pounds of very delicate pickled pork, the part, with- out bones, that is chiefly fat. 'J’he head must be very well cleaned and soaked j wash the salt from the pork and soak it likewise in lukewarm water; put both into a soup-kettle, with two onions, a bundle of sw'eet herbs, two sticks of celery, pepper, and pounded mace; fill the kettle with water, and boil very gently till the meat is tender; take out the head ami the pork, separate the meat from the bones, and return the latter into the soup. Let it stew for some hours longer : when cold take off the fat, strain the soup, and thicken it; add half or three-ciuarters of a pint of white wine, the juice of a lemon, or two glasses of Harvey’s sauce ; cut the meat of half the head into pieces and that of the pork also, and warm it up in the soup, together with egg-balls, and forcemeat ditto. The pork will be found a most acceptable addition, improving the flavour of the soup, and affording a substitute for the fat of the turtle. Half a calf’s-head is quite suffi- cient to make mock-turtle soup for a party 5 but as it cannot always be had with the skin on, the receipt is given for the whole.

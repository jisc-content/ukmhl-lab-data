DOMESTIC COOKERY. 180 SAUCE FOR WILD FOWL. Simmer a tea-cupful of port-wine, the same quantity of good meat gravy, a little shalot, a little pepper, salt, a grate of nuliueg, and a bit of mace, for ten minutes ; put in a bit of butter and flour, give it all one boil, and pour it through the birds. In general they are not stuffed as tame, but may be done so if liked. ORANGE GRAVY SAUCE, FOR GAME, AND WILD FOWL. Prepare a pint of clear good veal broth; put into it an onion, 12 leaves of basil, a large piece of orange or lemon-peel, and let it boil slowly ten minutes; then strain, and put it back into the sauce-pan, with the juice of either a Seville orange or lemon, ^ a tea- spoonful of salt, the same of pepper, and a glass of port. Serve quite hot. A little Cayenne may be added, unless it is the practice to introduce it into cuts in the breast of the birds, at table. ANOTHER FOR THE SAME, OR FOR DUCKS. Serve a rich gravy in the dish : cut the breast into slices, but donâ€™t take them off; cut a lemon, and put pepper and salt on it j then squeeze it on the breast, and pour a spoonful of graA^y over before you help. AN EXCELLENT SAUCE FOR CARP, OR BOILED TURKEY. Rub half a pound of butter with a tea-spoonful of flour, put to it a little water, melt it, and add near a quarter of a pint of thick cream, and half an anchovy chopped fine, not washed : set it over the fire ; and as it boils up, add a large spoonful of real India soy. If that does not give it a fine colour, put a little more. Turn it into the sauce-tureen, and put some salt and half a lemon : stir it Avell to hinder it from curdling.

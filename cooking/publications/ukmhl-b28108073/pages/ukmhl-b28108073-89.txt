77 MEATS. first-rate fruit pie, sucli as lie liacl often tasted at her father’s table. Well, the cookery book was duly consulted, and every- thing was done as directed—that is to say, everything down to the bottom of the page where the last words were “ two teacupfuls,” the first word on the next page being “ wine,” followed by “ a lemon sliced, the peel of a lemon grated, and a little cinnamon.” Now, as mischief would have it, the two leaves stuck together, and the first words on the third page, referring to a meat pie, were “ good gravy, a tablespoonful of chopped shalots and mush- rooms, a teaspoonful of chopped sweet herbs, two of salt, and one of mixed cayenne, cloves and piments.” Well this rather startled the young lady, but her notions of things in general were altogether rather vague, and she had often heard her mother say that fine cookery consisted chiefly in the harmonious blending of apparently incompatible ingredients. So the pie was made according to these directions, and it certainly was a dainty dish to set before her husband and his guests. And when the pie was opened, and tasted, there was something like a scene. It ended in a contrite confession, and the young lady did not venture upon pastry again for some time after.

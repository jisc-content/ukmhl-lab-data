ADDITIONS AND EMENDATIONS. 270 fine pineapple rum, stir, and set fire to it. Keep ladling the mixture until the flame begins to subside; then add a quartern of arrack and a wineglassful of dry curagao, and ladle out. Very nice, hut rather insidious. Some use whisky and gin instead of cognac and arrack. I prefer it as here directed. WINE AND EGG PUNCH. Extract half an ounce of finest gunpowder tea in a quartern of boiling water ; after four or five minutes' drawing, pour the infusion off the leaves, and add the tea to three quarterns of boiling water, in which half a grated nutmeg, a hit of cinna- mon, and five or six cloves, all placed in a muslin hag, have been extracted some ten minutes or so. Beat eight fresh eggs up with half a pound of powdered sugar candy; add a bottle and half of sound white French or Rhine wine, with constant beating; add the boiling water, keep beating the whole over a brisk fire until the foam just begins to rise, when remove quickly from the fire, and keep on beating with the whisk whilst you add a quartern of best old arrack or pine- apple rum. Note.—Some authorities advise to use the whites of the eggs alone, others the yolks alone.—See “Egg Rum Punch.” PLEASANT REFRESHMENT IN HOT WEATHER. Pick and wash a quarter of a pound of currants, put them in water, and let them just come to the boil; then pour off the water, put the currants into a suitably sized bowl, add a pound of powdered plain biscuits, a quarter of a pound of powdered sugar-candy, two or three drops of essence of lemon, a few slices of a fresh lemon, three bottles of sweet Edinburgh ale and four of iced ginger-beer; stir, and ladle out into tumblers with a teaspoon in each. In default of Edinburgh ale, Yarmouth ale will do, or the sweetest mild ale you can get. GINGERED EGG FLIP FOR EIGHT. Take half a gallon of good mild ale, one ounce of pow- dered ginger, half a pound of sugar-candy powdered fine, arid eight fresh eggs; break the eggs into a large jug, and beat

Every farmer breeds larger or smaller flocks, from twenty upwards; some contenting themselves with getting a large number of goose eggs hatched by hens (I have lately heard that they have introduced the incubator in some parts) and selling the young broods,, eight or ten days old, to people who make it their special business to prepare the birds for fattening by sending them to feed in the clover and stubble fields—the same as is done in Yorkshire—till they are fit for the final cramming process. Others work this business as a rural industry on a large scale, devoting to it extensive fields, turned into artificial meadows for the specific purpose of goose pasture. In summer the birds are fattened chiefly for the fresh-meat market, in late autumn for salting. The Alsatian goose is very inferior in size and weight to the Tolosan bird.

SALADS. 183 be pulled when wanted. If it is wished to keep the salad fresh the root should be stuck into moist sand in the cellar. The firm heads of lettuce barely ever harbour grit, or flies, or slugs within their folds, still they ought to be pulled asunder, and carefully examined and wiped if necessary. Leaves with much grit or mould on them, or invaded by flies, slugs or insects should be throwm away, at least the part affected. Per- fectly dry fresh leaves will take kindly to the oil in the dressing, washed leaves much less so. The water on the washed leaves of course cannot but reduce the strength of the vinegar, and as it is necessarily an indeterminate quantity, it puts you out in your reckoning. All green salads are the better for being kept a few hours in the cellar before being prepared for the bowl. Never put knife to your green salad, except just to remove the lower part of the stalk. Pull and pluck the leaves to suitable pieces with your fingers; the touch of the knife tends to injure the delicacay of the salad, more particularly its appearance when mixed in the bowl. The substitution of wiping for washing is not such a very unheard of innovation as it may look to many. Many friends in Germany and England have taken to it on my strong recommendationâ€”nay, even in France, where they are wonderfully conservative in culinary matters.

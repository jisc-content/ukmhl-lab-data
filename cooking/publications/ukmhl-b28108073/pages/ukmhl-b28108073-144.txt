After fifteen to twenty minutes boiling lay in the carp, sprinkle a teaspoonful of fine salt over it—according to requirement—add half a lemon in slices, removing the peel and the pips, three or four finely chopped shalots fried a light yellow, a quarter of a pound of butter, and the vinegar with the blood; cover the pan close, and let it boil another fifteen minutes of so, when the fish will be well done. Take the fish out of the pan, and lay it in a dish on the hot-plate. Thicken the sauce with crumbled gingerbread, add a quartern of port wine, rub through a tamis, and pour one half over the fish, the other half into a sauce-boat.

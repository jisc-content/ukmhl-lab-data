TEA. 213 The only wholesome beverage in childhood is milk, neat or diluted more or less largely with good potable water/ Strong black coffee is an excellent antidote in poisoning with opium, also in cases where strong tea, particularly gieen, has been indulged in to excess. Excessive indulgence in strong coffee cannot but be injurious to health. One small cup mixed with an equal portion of boiling milk for breakfast, and one small cup after dinner, should not be exceeded. B.—TEA. The tea which I knew in the days of my childhood and youth was the Overland or Caravan Tea, imported from China into Siberia over Kiachta. Gunpowder and Pekoe were then the sorts chiefly used in Russia and Northern Germany. As this caravan tea had not been subjected to the action of the sea air, it retained its full aroma, and was—in my recollection at least—very superior in flavour and strength to any of even the choicest teas of the present time. But it was also extravagantly high-priced then, and simply an article of luxury, altogether beyond the reach of any but the well-to-do classes; and even by them it was used but sparingly. It was then generally flavoured with vanilla or canella.

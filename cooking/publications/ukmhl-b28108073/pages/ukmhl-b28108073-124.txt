112 POULTilY AND GAME. In terminating this half-digression anent the dyspeptic offspring of Master Close's culinary genius, I crave permission to tell a little apologue which I r iad many years ago in a collection of German poems. The Prince of Midnight—Death—once upon a time summoned the two houses of his Black Parliament, that he might appoint a new prime minister, the then holder of the office—Yellow Jack, if I remember rightly—wishing to retire. Numerous candidates presented themselves, among others the Plague, who proudly referred in proof of her superior qualifications to the prayer in the Litany. This seemed conclusive, and the dread king was on the point of bestowing the coveted high office upon the distinguished claimant, when a new candidate rose, who boasted that he was the largest purveyor to the universal shambles. “ Who are you, then ?” queried the puzzled king, who could not remember having ever seen him before. “A cook, sire," was the reply, given with the proud emphasis of conscious merit. I have a notion he was a pastrycook from Strasburg, and his name was Close. The capercailzie, or cock of the wood, also known as wood grouse and mountain cock (Tetrao urogallus), ought to rank high in the list of game fowl. But I am afraid it is not appreciated in England. In my long experience I have but rarely seen it on an English table, and, I am sorry to add, not always properly done.

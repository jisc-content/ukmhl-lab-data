To housekeepers who are not above taking valuable hints as to the preparation of food, to those who look upon eating and drinking as the chief ends of life, and to all and sundry who like useful information none the less becouse it is lightened with genial gossip and spiced with sparkling anecdotes ‘ Philosophy in the Kitchen ’ is a book we can recommend.” —Spectator. “ Sets forth the conclusion with regard to meat and drink of one who has had many opportunities, and has used them wisely and well. He is a prophet to whom the dyspetic may listen on occasion with with pleasure, and of whom the haughtiest plain cook may learn cer- tain virtues of practice. His remarks on the distillation of coffee are such as should be read in every kitchen.”—Athenaum. “ Full of useful and sensible advice to cooks and their accomplices ; and receipt after receipt, blended with anecdotes new and old, take this volume out of the usual run of cookery-books.”—Chemist and Druggist.

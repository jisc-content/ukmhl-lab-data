274 ADDITIONS AND EMENDATIONS. substituted for lump sugar (strawberry, for instance, and curagao). In most cases where lump sugar is indicated it is prefer- able, as a rule, to substitute saturated syrup, prepared accord- ing to instructions on page 248. Regarding the proportion of sugar in liqueurs, this varies with the nature of the liqueur. Thus, for instance, whilst a quarter of a pound of lump sugar is held sufficient for cloves or cinnamon, a full pound is required for walnuts. The subjoined few recipes will, I think, suffice to show the general process of making liqueurs. CLOVES. Put in the bottle two drams of cloves, and half an ounce of coriander seeds, both coarsely powdered; with twenty-five to thirty dried black cherries, pour in one and a half imperial pint of best pale Trench brandy (or kirschwasser), and cork tight. Expose to the rays of the sun from twenty to thirty days, as directed, or place the bottle for the same period near a warm stove. So soon as the cloves, &c., have been sufficiently extracted place half a pound of best refined lump sugar in small pieces in a suitable saucepan, with half a pint of water, boil and skim, then let the syrup cool, and when cold add the brandy extract gradually, with constant stirring; then strain through a muslin bag or, better still, pass through filtering paper. Fill in small bottles, and cork or stopper tight. CINNAMON. Two drams best Ceylon cinnamon (Canella) in powder. A quarter of a pound of sugar. Same process of prepara- tion as under “ Cloves.” A fortnight’s extraction is amply sufficient. COMPOUND CLOVES. Half an ounce each of fennel, aniseed, coriander, and juniper berries, a dram of cinnamon (Canella), and a dozen of cloves. Pound coarsely, and expose in a large bottle with three pints of best French brandy, four weeks to the heat of the sun, or the warmth of a stove. Then boil half a pound

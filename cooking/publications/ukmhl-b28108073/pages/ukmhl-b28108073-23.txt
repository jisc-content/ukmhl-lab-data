11 THE FOOD OF MAN. In an excellent little treatise on Household Manage- ment and Cookery, which should be in every house- hold of this realm—high and humble—my old friend Tegetmeier adopts the division of food into albumenoid and oleaginous—the former as resembling white of egg in many properties, the latter as resembling oil in being combustible. My friend Tegetmeier is unto me a Gamaliel. I crave his kind permission here to transfer to my pages a few general remarks and comments of his on the subject—not by way of an audacious crib, but simply because I consider them most apposite, and feel that I could not express them more simply and clearly:— “The most important albumenoid articles of our food,” says M. Tegetmeier, “ are the solid parts of the flesh of animals, the curd of milk, which when dried becomes cheese; the albumen of eggs, gelatin, the gluten of flour, and the curdy matter that forms a large portion of many seeds, as peas, beans, &c. “ The most important of the oleaginous foods are fats, oils, starch, sugar, gum, and the softer and more digestible fibres of plants. “ Many of the articles used as food do not contain a proper proportion of these two kinds of substances, and in economical cooking it is desirable that the defects in one article of diet should be supplied by using it with some other which contains that which is wanting in the first.

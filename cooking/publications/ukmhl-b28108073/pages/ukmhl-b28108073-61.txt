49 PANTRY, LARDER AND CELLAR. Vegetables should be procured fresh every day, as most of them lose by keeping, and others can be kept better by the greengrocer than in your cellar or larder.

These hanks should be suspended free in a cool and airy place, to let them dry thoroughly. Should frost set in, all you have to do is to gather them in a heap and let them lie there without troubling about them. They will keep well till April, and even May.

The meat will do for roast, stew, or pastry. Whenever a piece is taken out, the fat has to be re-melted and poured on again. E

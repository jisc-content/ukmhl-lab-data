2 PRELIMINARY REMARKS. also, somewhat ambitiously, perhaps, to stand for the fruit in the humble pudding which I diffidently venture to set before the public; whilst the anecdotes and small talk interspersed here and there, will, I hope, be in- dulgently permitted to pass for the peel and spices. It may be well, also, to frankly disclaim all pre- tensions on my part to lecture ex cathedra on the fine- art science of kitchening even within the restricted limits indicated, though I may occasionally seem to adopt the lecturing style, as the nature of the subject, indeed, requires. I am not a professed chef’ but simply an earnest observant amateur, who thinks, maybe without sufficient reason, that he may add a hint or two to the vast store of culinary precepts. A distinguished organ of the Press declared quite recently that “ if a cookery book contain but one workable recipe which was not so before, all the rest may be leather and prunelle, and yet the book worth its price.” Why not hope then that a few of my hints may be found workable ? This little book is of necessity essentially fragmentary and limited in scope and extent. It can, therefore, but lightly touch upon a few branches of the vast subject of foods and drinks and their preparation, whilst leaving many others nearly altogether unnoticed.

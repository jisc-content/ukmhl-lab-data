SALADS. 194 touch on a few of them. However, the dressing is pretty nearly the same for all. Herring Salad may be made in the simplest way as follows :â€”Take six salted Hutch herrings, which you may easily procure at a German provision shop. Gut, skin, and wash them, and lay them three or four hours in cold water. Bone them, and cut them into small pieces. Have at least two soft roes among them, mix these with the quantity of vinegar required for the salad, and work the mixture through a tamis. Add the proper proportion of oil, ground pepper, and a glass of Burgundy or Bordeaux wine. Boil a pound of Hutch salad potatoes in the skin, peel them and cut them into slices while hot. If the slices seem too large,- cut every one of them in four. Chop four ounces of shalots very fine, with one ounce each of tarragon and capers. Pare six sour apples, and cut them into small cubic pieces, removing the core, &c. Mix all these ingredients together with the herrings in a bowl, and pour the dressing over them. Stir thoroughly with a wooden spoon and fork. Some lay the herrings from six to eight hours in milk, which certainly makes them more mellow. A pound of roast veal cut into small cubic pieces is often added along with the potatoes, or two pounds in lieu of them. Also a few anchovies, up to half a dozen, and lampreys cut into pieces about an inch long. Preserved

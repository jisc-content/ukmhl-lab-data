217 TEA. Branch of the United Grand Junction Ebenezer Tem- perance Association, some of the ladies were drowning themselves in tea, one disposing of no less than nine breakfast cups and a half, which made her “ swell visibly” before Mr. Weller’s eyes. But these were Temperance People, and it may reasonably be supposed that the beverage was rather weak. Still I cannot but think excessive indulgence in tea, strong or weak, must be hurtful to health. Dr. Smith, in his great work on “ Foods,” says that excellent tea, both in body and aroma, may be prepared by simply putting the leaves into ordinary cold water, in a covered vessel, and keeping this over a gentle fire until the water boils, when the tea is ready for use. I have tried this plan, and have found it answer well, though I did not think at first it would. The most convenient way is to boil the water with the leaves in it by gas or a spirit-lamp on the table. Whilst I am finishing this paragraph, a lady tells me that one of the great rules in tea making is to calculate the quantity required to a nicety, and never to exceed that quantity. If your guests should wish for an additional cup or so, it is easy to make a fresh supply. This seems more rational, at all events, than the common way of pouring fresh relays of boiling water over the exhausted tea leaves in the pot, even with the addition of another spoonful or so of dry leaves.

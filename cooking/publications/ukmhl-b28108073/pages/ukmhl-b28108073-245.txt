ADDITIONS AND EMENDATIONS. Page 10.—Flesh Formers and Fat Formers. The rigorous division of foods into flesh formers and fat formers had, up to a comparatively late period, many uncom- promising champions who would insist upon drawing a hard- and-fast line of distinction between the two. The leaders of the profession are, however, now a considerable shade less absolute in their views upon this subject, and it is freely and fully admitted by most of them that no hard-and-fast line can be drawn, and that flesh formers and fat formers may be more or less largely interchangeable. Still, as the question has a vital bearing upon what may be termed the “science of food”—i.e., the rational selection of a proper diet, and as there are still not a few generalising theorists who continue confused and confusing in their pre- conceived notions of flesh-forming and fat-forming foods, and are constantly devising more or less ingenious—or absurd— systems warranted to “ cure ” obesity—systems based mostly, with charming simplicity, upon the practicably total exclusion from the patient’s dietary of all fats, oils, sugar, starch, gum, alcohol, &c., combined with the administration of certain nostrums that have conveniently, though not rationally, attributed to them the power of “stopping the formation of fat ”! Such theories may be taken to rest mostly upon strange conceptions of the mysterious chemistry of life, the complex operations of which will very likely continue for a long time to come to elude our most patient, minutest research. Without presuming to advise upon this important point of

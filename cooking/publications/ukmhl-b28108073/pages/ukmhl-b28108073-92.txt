80 PROCESSES OF COOKING. water, place tlie saucepan on the fire, and raise the heat slowly to the boiling point. Remove it now at once to a much more moderately heated part, and let it simmer on until the joint is properly cooked—as in this case, both the meat and the broth are eaten, there cannot possibly be much real loss of nutritive matter.* Where, on the other hand, it is desired to retain the largest practicable proportion of gravy in the meat, the joint is put for about fifteen minutes in boiling water. The exudation of the juices proceeds chiefly from the cut ends of the soft fibres, and ceases as soon as these ends have become hardened from the coagulation of the albumen. Now albumen coagulates at a temperature very much below the boiling point of water (at 120°). A quarter of an hour’s immersion in boiling water, is there- fore, amply sufficient to prevent—or nearly so—further exudation of nutritive juices. But the contact with boiling Avater must not be continued beyond fifteen minutes, after which the saucepan has to be drawn * Anent the boiling of hams, Mr. Tegetmeier tells us that at the large ham and beef shops in London, where the meat is generally very tender, the hams are always placed in cold Avater in a copper, under which a small fire is made, which raises the water very gradually to the boiling point. The moment this is accomplished the fire is raked out, the copper covered over, and the hams are allowed to remain in the Avater until it is nearly cold. In this manner they are several hours in cooking, and never are per- mitted to reach the boiling point. This mode of cooking makes the flesh exceedingly tender, and guards against loss of fat.

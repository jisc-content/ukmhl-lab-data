FISH AND SHELLFISH. 131 &c., in the jar; tie over with oiled parchment paper, and keep in a cool place. In eight to ten days the herrings are ready for eating. Many years ago poor dear Charles Sala showed me how to cook a bloater to perfection by a new system, professedly invented by him, which I may say I found excellent. Only it has the trifling drawback of being a trifle expensive. It is easy to do : You take a large soup plate and pour a quartern of the best whisky into it; you then lay two fine bloaters on the plate, set fire to the spirit, and turn the bloaters over and over again in the burning whisky. When the spirit is consumed, the herrings are done to perfection. A good dish, but not economical, at least not in the United Kingdom, where the duty on spirits fluctuates between ten and twelve shillings a gallon. Another dear friend of mine, who I am happy to say is still to the fore, Horwitz, the famous chess-player and artist, is equally great in fish cooking. I learnt much from him on that special line of the art, more par- ticularly the proper way of preparing carp a lapolonctise, i.e., with beer sauce, as follows:â€” Clean and wash your carps (fresh killed, if practic- able), scale and split them, and cut them in pieces, reserving the blood in a wineglassful of fresh vinegar. To three or four pounds weight of carp take four carrots, half a turnip, two or three parsley roots, a quarter K 2

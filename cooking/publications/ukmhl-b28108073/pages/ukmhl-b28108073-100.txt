After use, always scour your pan (as indeed should be done to all pots and pans, &c., used in cooking pro- cesses) thoroughly, wipe it quite dry, and hang it up in a place free from humidity. Before using it again, set it on the fire with cold water. When the water is hot, wash the pan well, and wdpe it quite dry. I have but too often seen fryingpans—and stewpans, too, for the matter of that—put away unwashed ; and I have seen omelets and pancakes done in pans lately used to do herrings, or bloaters, or sprats, or some other strong- scented delicacy.

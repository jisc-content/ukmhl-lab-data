82 PROCESSES OF COOKING. done, strain the gravy through a strainer, skim off the fat, and add a spoonful of Worcester sauce and a squeeze of lemon to the skimmed gravy. I have a notion this will be found a tasty dish, and a simple way of disposing profitably of the scraps of cold boiled mutton. Stewing is a modification of boiling, which M. Tegetmeier and other high authorities on the science and art of cooking consider more advantageous and economical than the latter process. I incline much to the same opinionâ€”except always, of course, in the matter of boiled leg of mutton, as expatiated upon above. In stewing, the meat should, if possible, be placed in an earthen vessel, with a small quantity of liquid, as a rule, and exposed to the long continued action of a very moderate heat, which naturally tends to soften the fibres, and to make the flesh of old animals, and tough, sinewy joints, easy to chew and digest, thus enabling a good cook to turn the coarsest and cheapest meat into savoury and nutritious food, very little, if indeed at all, inferior to prime joints. Braising is simply a modification of stewing, which has been sufficiently described under Boiling. The processes of Roasting and Baking have been incidentally touched upon already; still, a few words may be added here in reference to the former.

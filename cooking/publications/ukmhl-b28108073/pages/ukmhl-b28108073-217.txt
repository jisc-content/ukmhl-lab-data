COFFEE. 205 gradation I reject altogether, as the aroma passes off from the instant the chestnut-brown is reached. It is the strongest objection I have to the continental practice. In my own roasting I even stop short of the pronounced chestnut-brown. My beans lose eighteen per cent. —Tausenau’s practice stops at sixteen per cent, loss. Adapt the size of your cylinder to the quantity of coffee you have to roast at a time; I need hardly add that there should always be sufficient room left for the beans to swell and move freely about. Grinding is another important element in the pre- paration of good coffee. The finer the mill grinds, the stronger is the infusion, and accordingly the more economical the process. Coarse-ground beans will yield only eighty per cent., nay, as low as sixty-five or sixty per cent, of infusion of the same strength as fine ground beans will produce. In the East they generally pound the fresh-roasted beans to a fine powder in a marble mortar with a wooden pestle. Brillat Savarin found by actual experiment that the pounded coffee gave a superior liquid to that produced from the ground coffee. However, grinding is more expeditious, and with a fine mill the result is almost equally satis- factory. Always pass your beans fresh and hot from the roaster to the mill, and grind without delay.

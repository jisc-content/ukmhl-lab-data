15 QUALITIES REQUIRED IN A GOOD COOK. A wise economy is a splendid quality in a cook. Without it, even the highest culinary genius may come rather over-expensive. Only it must be intelligent economy. What is generallyknown as attempted cheese- paring is truly naught but extravagance of the worst possible kind, and in the most openly foolish disguise. Never go in for that sort of seeming saving which consists in the use of cheap materials, such, for instance, as rancid butter or mutton fat for pastry and frying; or inferior— miscalled cheap—meat, fish, poultry, vegetables, fruit, &c. You will always find the best articles the cheapest in the end. Let your economy be quantitative not qualitative. Take it for granted that a little of what is really good will go a longer way than a great deal of inferior trash. I have more than once seen a pair of excellent soles reduced to naught in value by frying in mutton fat, trusting the fat to drain off after, but for- getting that the delicacy of flavour in the fish could not well be expected to resist the action of the tallow. Shun cream and puff box, with an elegant assortment, occasionally, of dirty socks and stockings and pocket handkerchiefs, dish clouts, and other abominations. I have seen the kitchen knives reposing in the same box side by side with the dinner sets. I will not pursue the subject; it is unsavory in the extreme. I will only add that, in my opinion, the cook who has no method, system, and order in the arrangement of her kitchen, larder, pantry, and cellar, robs herself with her eyes open of a notable portion of most precious time, lost in hunting after things when they are wanted.

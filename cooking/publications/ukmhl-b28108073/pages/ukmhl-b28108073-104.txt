PROCESSES OF COOKING. 92 before cooking is not followed in any other country is, perhaps, a little too absolute. In my early days I have often seen our own cook salt and pickle fat joints of beef and pork. I remember she never would use saltpetre either for simple salting or full pickling. I cannot call to mind at this distance of time what she used for a substitute, or how she managed to pre- serve the colour of the meat. But I remember quite well her favourite pickle.

This mixture was boiled half an hour, with careful skimming, allowed to cool, and when quite cold poured over the pickling flesh. The quan- tities here given were calculated for ten pounds of beef or pork. The meat was left eight to ten days in this pickle. For use, it was set on the fire in boiling water, to prevent the escape of the juices. The same pickle, boiled and skimmed again, was used once or twice more. To my recollection, she never salted or pickled any but fat meat. A few words on Extracts of Meat, and on the so- called Carne pura, or flesh-meal, or meat-powder.

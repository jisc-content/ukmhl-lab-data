12 THE FOOD OF MAN. “For example, rice and potatoes consist chiefly of starch, and of themselves are bad foods unless com- bined with fatty and albumenoid matters; therefore we endeavour to use rice in puddings with milk, eggs, and butter, which supply all that is wanting, and it thus becomes a valuable article of food. Potatoes are most useful and economical if eaten with milk, fat meats; alone they are barely able to support life and cannot sustain health and strength. Beans, which are chiefly albumenoid, are eaten with bacon. Bread, which is wanting in fat, with butter or bacon, &c.” The principal object of good cooking is to aid and augment, not to impair and diminish the nutritive action and power of the food to be cooked. Nutrition should always be our chief consideration—superior tastiness of our meals is comparatively of secondary importance. Unhappily, insufficiency of means but too often compels more or less serious modifications of the application of this great principle. The poor cannot command the most nutritive diet; but with a little knowledge of the properties of the various articles of food within their reach, even the poor may be able to feed tolerably well, and maintain the body in health and strength. Cookery that combines nutritiveness and tastiness with economy may be held to achieve the highest desideratum in this important branch of practical Sociology.

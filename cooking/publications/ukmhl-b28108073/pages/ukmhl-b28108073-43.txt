PANTRY, LARDER AND CELLAR. 31 overcome. I think I need hardly mention that in oven roasting, just the same as before an open fire, a strong heat has to be applied at first, to be reduced after. The perfect range of the future will, I believe, be the gas range—when it shall have received all the improve- ments of which it is capable, and when electricity shall have replaced gas for lighting purposes, and shall thus have very considerably reduced its present extravagant price. It will then certainly be one of the most economical ways of cooking, as it is the most easily and cleanly managed, the heat being under perfect control. Even as it is, it can be turned to profitable use in many ways; for instance, using rows of concentric rings, two, three, or four of them, with Bunsen burners ; every ring with separate gas tap, so as to extend or contract at pleasure the surface of flame, to adapt it to the size of the pots or pans used.* * Many years ago, eheu! I used to do a deal of kitchening with the renowned Madame Boileau, a first-rate Parisian purveyor of certain delicate dishes—she “did” for Clericals: n’est ce pas tout dire?—such as matchless sturgeon and salmon steaks, rognons sautes au vin de Madhre, field lark and field fare pies, and most delicious pastry. The kitchen apparatus was calculated for charcoal, coal and gas. A deal of her frying, stewing, boiling, &c., was done on such concentric gas rings, generally with a Rose burner in the centre. All the raw vegetable offal that would not do for the stock pot, or could not be turned to profitable account in some other way, was put into a special hot closet to dry it, for the purpose of being used as fuel along with coal—a truly economical way of disposing of it.

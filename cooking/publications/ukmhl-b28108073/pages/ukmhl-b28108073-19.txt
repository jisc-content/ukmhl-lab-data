PART I. THE FOOD OF MAK This little book is not intended, of course, for a physiological or chemical essay. Still, a few general propositions and remarks, by way of introduction to this part, may not be deemed altogether out of place here. All material life may be said to move in an everlast- ing round of incessant changes, from the inorganic to the organic; from the vegetable to the animal division of nature, and back again, in endless rotation through time—and eternity. All living organic beings—animals and plants alike— have to live in a certain measure upon air and water. The plant feeds besides upon the soil on which it grows, drawing from it all the other elements it requires for its sustenance and development. The animal, again, feeds, in addition, on the plant directly or indirectly, incorporating, proximately or ulti- mately, in its own structure the elements diawn by the latter from the earth, the water, and the air.

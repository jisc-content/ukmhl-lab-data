PREFACE TO THE NEW EDITION. The favourable reception so graciously accorded to this humble contribution to gastronomic literature encourages me to venture upon a second edition ;â€”in which it will be found, I hope, I have endeavoured, to the best of my ability, to correct and supplement, as far as practicable within the scope and intention of the work, the more serious defects and shortcomings indulgently pointed out by many kind critics and correspondents, to all of whom I beg to tender my warmest thanks. The absence of an index has been generally con- demned, and justly so, I admit, as it certainly could not but detract from the practical usefulness of the book. The omission, it will be found, is fully supplied in this second edition. THE AUTHOR. December, 1886.

83 PROCESSES OF COOKING. In so far as small joints are concerned, roasting is certainly not the least wasteful process of cooking, nor even always the most satisfactory in its product. The heat being less evenly and gently applied, as a rule, in roasting before a free fire, the outside is apt to become overdone before the inside is sufficiently cooked, and the waste of the juices extracted is greater than in boil- ing. And this loss cannot well be guarded against by the action of boiling water, as this might injuriously affect the roasting. In my earlier days I have seen joints dipped a few minutes in boiling fat, to prevent exudation of the juice from the cut ends. I am afraid, however, there are practical difficulties here that cannot be disregarded. The only way which is left open is to bring the joint, protected by a Dutch oven or screen, quite near a sharp, brisk fire at first to induce coagula- tion of the albumen all over the surface, then to remove it to a proper distance for roasting. However, this answers the purpose only imperfectly at best. Now Roasting happens to be the favourite process of cooking meat in this countryâ€”and there is certainly no other land in the world where the process is so thoroughly understood as a rule, and so perfectly performed. I have known first-class French chefs iail in the roasting a leg of mutton, for instance, before an open fire, in the way in which a second rate English plain cook will brilliantly achieve he task, and think nothing of it.

48 PROVISIONS AND REQUISITES IN KITCHEN, In my time I have seen fresh joints plunged into boiling fat, packed in straw, sewn up in canvas bags, and suspended in the same way in airy cellars, where they would keep for months. I also remember that we used to strew fresh killed venison all over with coarsely- pounded charcoal, pepper, ginger, and pimento (but no salt, as we knew this would simply extract the best juices), sew it up in strong canvas, and place it some six or seven feet deep in the ground, shovelling the earth back over it, and leaving it for three to four weeks, or even longer, undisturbed.

It was then wiped dry inside and outside, anointed all over with fresh butter or lard, and roasted before a clear brisk fire. It was delicious. In an old recipe, dated from the end of the fourteenth century, burying tainted venison in the earth for three or four days is recommended as an infallible means to remove the taint.* * Another way I remember of keeping venison, pork, and wild boar—particularly rather oldish animals—for several months: The joints to be preserved are cut into roasting pieces, over which a little coarsely-pounded charcoal and pepper is sprinkled. The flesh is incised with a sharp pointed knife, and fat bacon slips, about half an inch thick, are pressed into the incisions, along with a few slialots, cloves, and grains of pepper. The joints thus pre- pared are now given an incipient roasting in the oven, suspended

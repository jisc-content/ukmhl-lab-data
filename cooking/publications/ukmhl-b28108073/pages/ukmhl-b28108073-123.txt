POULTRY AND GAME. Ill palate, is certainly a much sounder article of food, and has, at least, this great advantage in its favour, that it is not the product of an artificially created disease, entail- ing cruel suffering upon an unhappy race of most useful birds. An excellent substitute for goose-liver tureen may be made with pig’s liver, in the following way :— Take a good-sized pig’s liver, immerse it five or six minutes in hot water, chop it fine, and rub it through a tamis. Cut half a pound of bacon into very small cubes; boil another half pound, and chop it: add the whole of the bacon to the liver, along with six soft-boiled and pulped onions, passed through a tamis, half a pound of pared and chopped truffles, a quarter pound chopped mushrooms, a teaspoon and a half fine salt, one white pepper, and one mixed spice; add also a quartern of red Burgundy or port, and boil the whole to a thickish consistency. Pour it into a suitable mould lined with bacon, and bake it from one and a half to two hours in a moderately heated oven. When baked put weights on, which will cause a good deal of fat to gather on the top. This fat must not be removed; but should any gravy make its appearance, it may be poured off with proper care. I have seen this substitute more than once on breakfast tables in London and other parts, where it passed unsuspected for the genuine article.

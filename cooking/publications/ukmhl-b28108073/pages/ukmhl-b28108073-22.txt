10 THE FOOD OF MAN. sulphur, iron and manganese; sulphuric, hydrochloric, phosphoric, and fluoric acids, &c. The daily waste of all these has to be supplied in the food. It would lead us too far here to discuss the various classifications of food. The usual division into two principal classes is amply sufficient for the purpose we have here in view. These two principal classes are—(1) the so-called flesh forming or nitrogenous foods; and (2) the heat gene- rating or carbonaceous foods, so termed after the two chief purposes for which food is required by the body, viz., to generate heat—which is even the more urgent and the more essential of the two, as the withdrawal or inordinate reduction of the source of heat is incompatible with the continuance of life, and leads to its rapid extinction— and to replace the materials consumed in the chemico- physiological organic processes, if I may be permitted so to express it, incessantly going on in the body. The division of foods into heat generators and flesh formers is, however, by no means sharply defined, as both mutually partake, in a certain sense and to some extent, of one another’s nature, since the renewal of flesh by nitrogenous foods is attended with evolution of heat, and the generation of heat by carbonaceous foods may be attended with the production of flesh in the form of fat.

I cannot speak positively upon the point, but I believe the fact to be so, as hard water, whilst fully extracting the volatile aromatic principle from the ground or powdered coffee, is not quite so well calculated as soft water in the comparatively short time of contact to extract equally the other, perhaps less desirable elements. Always keep your coffee biggin or cafetiere or other apparatus, &c., scrupulously clean for every fresh infu- sion—and heat them thoroughly with boiling water each time before use. Strong coffee is, in my humble opinion, a better and safer stimulant than tea; it makes also a better food with boiling milk than the latter, and is accordingly more suitable for breakfast. A small cup—a demi tasse —neat, or with a modicum of cognac or old Jamaica rum, after dinner is certainly calculated to aid digestion. Quality not quantity should be the presiding rule in the use of coffee. Strong coffee taken before meals I hold to be injurious. Gold coffee diluted rather largely with milk and water is an excellent drink in summer and winter, and a much better and safer stimulant for the brain than alcoholic beverages. Young children should not have coffee given them nor, for the matter of that, tea either, whether green or black, strong or weak.

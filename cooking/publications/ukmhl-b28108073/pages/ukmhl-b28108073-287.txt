ADDITIONS AND EMENDATIONS. 275 of sugar in a pint of water, skim, let cool, and add the contents of the bottle to the cold syrup. Strain or filter, and fill in bottles. CURASAO. Take a quarter of a pound of orange peel, and immerse it in water, to facilitate the separation of the outer yellow rind from the white. Cut the yellow rind into small pieces, which add to the brandy (a pint and a half) in the bottle. Cork tight, and keep a fortnight near a warm stove, or three weeks in the cellar, shaking the contents at least once every day.

When the sugar is dissolved, filter through filtering paper, and fill in bottles. STRAWBERRY. Gather a pint of fresh, small, wild strawberries, and put them in a large bottle, with twenty ounces of powdered white sugar-candy, and fill up to the cork with fine old cognac or kirschwasser ; put in the cork or stopper tight, and place the bottle every day in the sun for about two months.

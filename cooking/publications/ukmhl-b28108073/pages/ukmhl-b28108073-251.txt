Mr. Harry Draper writes that tarragon for vinegar should be used dry, and advises a trial both ways, which, he says, will soon show the difference in favour of the dry leaves. Well, I have tried, but with the opposite result. Perhaps I did not do the thing properly, and my non-success certainly need not prevent others from acting upon Mr. Draper’s advice. Page 63—Pepsin. This most valuable digester should be procured only from manufacturers of the very highest repute. Besides the well- known pepsin pills, the acid glycerate of pepsin in a most excellent and efficient form in which to administer this truly invaluable digestive agent. Page 64. Curried Sweetbreads.—A lady sends me the following recipe :—Boil the sweetbreads for about a quarter of an hour. Let them cool; when cold cut them in slices about half an inch thick, and put them in a stew-pan with some good stock. Stew them gently for one hour, with two or three good-sized onions sliced and fried in butter. How work two ounces of fresh butter with one tablespoonful each of currie powder and flour into a paste, which stir into the gravy, and let the whole remain for another half hour. Serve piping hot with boiled rice. Page 65—Old Rice and New. “ Why must the Carolina rice be old V writes a friend to me. The reason simply is that new rice is inferior in quality to old. It is less digestible, and is apt to cause indigestion, diarrhoea and rheumatism. The gathered grain needs a certain time for after-ripening—say six months at the very least'—before it is fit for eating, Indian authorities advise a much longer delay, and discountenance the use of rice for the table till fully three years after gathering. Old rice is better suited for curries, as it does not burst and mash half so readily as the new grain. It is also held by some authorities that arrack should always be made from old rice.

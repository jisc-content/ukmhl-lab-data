PROCESSES OF COOKING. 87 Eggs fried in a pan are more or less apt to be in- digestible—generally more so; which is hardly to bo wondered at, seeing that the process tends to thoroughly coagulate and harden the albumen. In frying fish, more especially the dainty whitebait, tender sole, and others of the same delicate nature, always use—if you possibly can afford it—good butter, pure lard, oi sweet salad oil. Beef dripping will do a la rigueur; but mutton fat will not—at least not for fine palates: though I confess I know a gentleman who always fries his fish in mutton fat. But then he is a splendid cook —one out of a thousand; and I have reason to know that he uses only the fat of young sheep, which he pre- pares by keeping it in fresh water for twelve hours, then chopping it fine, and boiling it with a small cupful of milk over a gentle fire—in an open pan—with fre- quent stirring, until the fat looks quite clear. This is the German way of rendering mutton fat. Under any circumstances, good sound mutton fat is vastly prefer- able to bad butter and to the fatty abominations that are palmed upon the public as “ butter.” I will venture be numerous small nodules of flour not wetted. The air imprisoned therein when poured into the pan expands quickly, and converts each nodule into a bubble, so that your pancake is like fried froth. Try it.” [I have tried—and I must say I never tasted such wondrously light pancakes before.] “Of course I need not tell you that the temperature of the pan is of the greatest importance.”

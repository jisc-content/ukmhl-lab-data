33 SAUCES. 79. Biiown Eoux. Melt some butter very slowly, stir into it browned flourâ€” which, is easily made by laying a quantity of fine flour on a dish before the fire, or in a moderate oven, till it is of a fine even brown, not too dark; add as much to the butter as will make it the thickness of paste, stirring well with a wooden spoon for fifteen or twenty minutes till it is of a yellowish brown colour. This must be done gradually, with care and patience j if the fire is too hot it will become bitter and spoil everything it is put into ; when cold it should be thick enough to cut with a knife. It will keep a fortnight. 80. White Eoux. Melt some good fresh butter slowly and stir into it the best sifted flour till like a thin firm paste; stir it well over a slow fire for a quarter of an hour, talcing care it does not brown. This is used for thickening white sauces. Pour it into jars to keep for use. 81. Clear Gravy of Veal for Sauces. Lay in the bottom of a stew a small slice of fat bacon j on that place four pounds of leg of veal, a slice of raw ham, two onions, two carrots, and some parsley j add three spoonfuls of stock, cover it close, set it upon a slow fire, till it becomes dry and brown. Take the greatest care it does not burn, and move the pan round frequently that it may not colour more in one part than another. Pour in four quarts of stock, and let it simmer for half an hour, and strain through a lawn sieve. It should bo a fine amber colour, and as clear as possible. n

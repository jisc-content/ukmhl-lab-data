MEAT, POULTRY, GAME. 95 a bit of butter the size of a large walnut rubbed in a little flour, two yolks of eggs, half a glass of gravy, two spoonfuls of good broth, a few drops of vinegar, some whole pepper, and salt. Thicken your sauce on the fire without letting it boil, lest the eggs should turn. Take the paper and bacon off your chickens, place them on a dish, and pour the sauce hot over them. 251. Capilotade of Chicken. Cut up two chickens that have been either roasted or boiled previously, skin them, and put them into a stew- pan, with a piece of butter rolled in flour, set them on the file for a few minutes, then pour a brown Italienne over (see Sauces), and let them simmer a quarter of an hour over a slow fire. Take care the sauce does not stick to the pan. Add to the sauce either capers or minced gherkins. Fry some thin slices of bread of a light-brown, glaze; then arrange them round the dish, with the chicken in the centre, and pour the sauce over. 252. Matelotte de Petits Poulets. Cut up your chickens as for a fricassee, legs and wings, pinions, and the breasts and backs, into two, put them into boiling water on the fire for two or three minutes, then place them in a stew-pan with a slice or two of ham, a ladleful of mixed veal gravy and cullis, a bunch of onions and parsley, a little sweet basil, half a shallot, some pepper and salt; stew all together gently for an hour. Then strain the sauce, add some more cullis, a few button mushrooms or sliced truffles, a squeeze of orange or lemon-juice; dish the chicken, pour the sauce over

HINTS ON COOKERY. n TyAINTY DISHES,” by Lady Harriet St. Clair* AJ was translated into German by her husband, Count Minister, who also wrote a Preface to the German Edition. That preface is more particularly applicable to the condition of Cookery in Germany, but the fol- lowing extracts from it have a general application, and will, it is believed, prove interesting to English readers. Attention to Household Affairs. If auyone should feel surprised that a titled lady should write a cookery-book, or even feel disposed to make merry of the matter, let him look around and observe the wives and young ladies of the aristocratic circles and of the middle class. I am afraid that the attentive observer would then perceive that the innate sense of domesticity as compared with years gone by has much declined, and that an interest in practical and useful everyday matters is very seldom to be found. He will also see how necessary, how profitable, it is to direct the attention of women and physicians to the household and the kitchen. * Lady Harriet Elizabeth St. Clair, sister of the fourth Earl of Rosslyn, was born June 26, 1S31, married Count Munster (German Ambassador to the Court of St, James’s) August 22, 1865, and died November 29,1867, at Derneburg, in Hanover, and was buried there by her own desire.

XVII HINTS ON COOKERY. Anyone who has had the good fortune to possess a wife who understood how to lend to the material aspects of life a spiritual interest, and who has had the nameless misfortune of losing such a wife, will know how impor- tant it is, how full of blessings it is, when intelligent and clever women occupy themselves thoroughly with house- hold affairs, when such things interest them, and enable them to deliver a proper decision in respect of them. Comparison of the Cookery of European Nations. If the various culinary arrangements of different nations be regarded, the French school is the one gene- rally considered as the best, and in a certain sense this is also true, because considerable care is taken in reference to the materials used, and even more in the preparation. Sauces are used to make everything piquante and tasty. The Frenchman says, you can eat your grandmotherâ€™s slippers with a good sauce. The Italian School of Cookery does not stand on the same eminence as the French, but it is far better than is usually admitted. The Italians are especially renowned for their skill in using oil for confections, for macaroni, ices, chocolate, etc. The Russian system is also not by any means bad. The Kussian cook is endowed with much talent, espe- cially in the baking of pastries, the preparation of fish, and the peculiar kinds of fruit confectionaries. The last item is particularly well understood in Russia. The English kitchen, however, delights me the most, as the most rational and healthiest, precisely as the Englishman is in everything regarding practical life and true civilization at least a hundred years in advance of every other nation. b

Pick the strawberries from their stalks and rub them through a sieve ; then take fine pounded sugar and mix with the pulp till it is smooth and the thickness of cream ; add a little lemon-juice to freshen it and give it more the flavour of fresh-picked strawberries. 630. Peach Water-Ice. Take fresh peaches and rub them through a hair-sieve ; to whatever quantity of pulp you have add the same of clarified sugar, half as much water, and lemon-juice sufficient to make it as near the original flavour of the fruit as possible. 631. Cherry Water-Ice. Take good fresh Duke cherries, and pick them from their stalks ; then pound them in a mortar and break the kernels; lay them on a sieve, drain the juice from the pulp ; then add to the quantity of juice you have half as much water, pouring it over the pulp in the sieve to get out what juice may remain, and the same quantity of clari- fied sugar; pass the juice through the sieve again, and add a small quantity of lemon-juice.

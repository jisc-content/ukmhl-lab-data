SAUCES. 23 45. German Sauce for Boiled Beef. Take six ordinary sized potatoes, boil them in salt and water, skin them and let them cool, grate them with a sugar-grater; add the yolks of six hard-boiled eggs, mix them well together ; then take four spoonfuls of fine olive oil and two of vinegar, and pass all through a hair sieve ; add a little finely-minced parsley. This sauce should be pretty thick, but if it appears too much so, more vinegar may be added. This is enough for a large quantity. 46. Mustard Sauce. A teacupful of mustard to be put into a dish with a tablespoonful of sugar, one of olive-oil, and a little salt; to be well mixed with the yolk of a hard-boiled egg rubbed down; add as much vinegar as will make it suf- ficiently liquid, and strain it through a sieve. 47. Sauce a la Tartare. Chop one onion, two shallots, a little parsley and tar- ragon, and a few capers, very fine ; two yolks of eggs boiled hard, rubbed down, and dissolved by a little drop of water. Mix all these well together, and add a spoonful of tarragon and one of plain vinegar; beat it well with a wooden spoon, adding by degrees a spoonful of olive-oil and mustard to your taste. This is a very good receipt, and is excellent with broiled fowl, or grouse, or eels, or salmon, and with cold meat of all kinds. 43. Sauce A la Kavigote. Take capers, burnet, chervil, tarragon, a few stalks of celery, and two balm leaves; pick and wash them; also

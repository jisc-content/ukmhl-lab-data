338 ADDITIONAL RECEIPTS. of good strong tin, and have round the inside edge of the box a rim so that a flat piece of tin can be laid on it as a lid, and soldered to the outside edge. The boxe3 must be first boiled in potash and water, and then well rinsed in clean hot water. Care must be taken that all the vege- tables used are young, and perfectly fresh ; as for fruits, they must be preserved in bottles, as their acid acting on the metal would give them an unpleasant taste. The best vegetables for preserving are peas, French beans, broad beans, young carrots, cauliflower and asparagus. With the exception of the peas and asparagus they should be half boiled, with as little water as possible, and not much salt, as that can always be added when they are cooked. Peas should be shelled and boiled in a little broth without any salt, not longer than a quarter of an hour, and asparagus should only be washed clean and closely packed in the boxes. Vegetables are to be laid in the boxes while they are still hot; they are not to be filled fuller than half a little fingerâ€™s breadth from the top ; you are then to pour over each some of the liquor they were boiled in, and in the case of the asparagus plain boiling water, leaving still about as much room as two straws would take between the top and the lid, or the boxes could not be soldered, which they are now ready for, and which is the most important part of the whole process, for if they are not made perfectly air- tight all your labour will have been in vain, so you should take care to have a trustworthy tinsmith in attendance, and let him wait till you have quite finished, that he may be at hand to close with solder any little aperture which may be discovered in the course of boiling, and which will be seen by small air-bubbles rising from the spot continu- ously to the top of the water. When the boxes are per- fectly soldered, place them in a large kettle or pan of

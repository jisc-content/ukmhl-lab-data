This quantity makes a good large cake, the size of an ordinary baking-sheet. 70. Another Butter Cake. Three pounds of warmed and sifted flour, three-quarters of a pound of slowly melted and clarified butter, a quarter of a pound of sifted sugar, three eggs, one ounce of washed yeast, three small teaspoonfuls of salt, two of powdered mace, and nearly a pint of warm milk. Then for the out- side of the cake, three-quarters of a pound of coarsely broken sugar, a quarter of a pound of butter, an ounce of cinnamon, and a small cup of rose-water. Make a hollow in the flour, put in all the ingredients, mix quickly with a knife, and then with the hand flatten and roll it out to about the thickness of the little finger ; let it rise for an hour and a half, then strew the top with the sugar and cinna- mon, stick bits of butter all over it, bake from ten to fifteen minutes, taking care it does not get too dark a colour, and sprinkle it with the rose-water. The eggs may be left out, and half a pound of well-washed currants are also often added. This is a favourite German cake, made on all great occasions, such as weddings, christenings, etc. At Christmas and Easter, not the poorest peasant is with- out one, and the very servants in your house would revolt if at these times it was not given to them. It is a curi- ous sight then to see a village baker’s—everybody bring- ing their cake to be baked.

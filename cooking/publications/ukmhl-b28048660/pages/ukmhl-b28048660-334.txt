306 DAIRY— CHEESE, BUTTER, ETC. « 851. Irish Cream Cheese. Let twelve quarts of new milk stand two or three days until it is quite thick; skim it, and tie up the cream in a linen cloth wet with salt and water; hang it up to drain; when it has done dripping, open the cloth and put the cheese on a deep plate, with a wet cloth under it, arranged so that you can turn the cheese till it is dry ; then put it on another plate without a cloth, and cover it with nettles fresh every day till you think it fit for use. In warm weather the cream thickens and the cheese ripens quicker than in cold. This is particularly good. 852. Cream for Butter Should he kept constantly stirred—i. e. three or four times a-day—and changed from one tub to another every day. To prevent milk or butter tasting of turnips or cabbages, the best way is to pour a quart of boiling water on two ounces of saltpetre; when dissolved and cold, bottle and cork it for use; put two large spoonfuls of this to every four gallons of milk immediately it is brought in, stirring it well; a piece of saltpetre about the size of a walnut may also be put in the cream- pot, and stirred at least once a-day. This method, if regularly attended to, has been found very effectual; but turnips should never be given to milking-cows raw. If steamed with hay they impart a much less disagree- able flavour to the milk. Charcoal put into the milk- pan is said to be a good remedy.

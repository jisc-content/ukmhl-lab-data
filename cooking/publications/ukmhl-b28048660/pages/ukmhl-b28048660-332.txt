304 COOKERY FOR THE SICK AND POOR. 845. For a Weak Digestion. Beat up in a basin a fresli-laid egg, add six tablespoon* luls of cold water, then two of potato-flour; mix it thoroughly with the water and egg, and pour as much boiling water over it as will make into a jelly, stirring it well. This is useful in all cases of stomachic debility; it is light, wholesome, and nourishing. It may be eaten for breakfast with the addition of a little milk and sugar. 846. Lait de Poule Is simply the yolk of an egg well beat, then carefully adding to it by degrees boiling water, stirring it all the time to prevent its curdling. It should be sweetened with sugar-candy. For a cold, a spoonful of wine or rum may be added to it, or it may be made with beef-tea instead of water, which makes it very nourishing. 847. Cordial for the Weak. Add a pint of wine to a quart of barley-gruel; boil it down to one-third; add lemon-peel or any seasoning preferred. A teacupful taken several times a-day is very strengthening. 848. Cordial for an Invalid. Half a pint of the best French brandy, boiled with as much coarse brown sugar as the brandy will imbibe, till it becomes about the consistency of treacle. Boiling the brandy takes away its heating qualities; and this receipt, taken frequently in small quantities, has been found of the greatest use to consumptive persons.

Horseradish Sauce. Grate a stalk of horseradish very fine ; to each table- spoonful of this add a teaspoonful of mustard, one of white sugar, and a little salt; add vinegar, a teaspoonful at a time, working it well till it comes to a proper consistency. The yolk of a hard-boiled egg worked in is considered an improvement by some cooks. For roast beef. 130. Sauce Appetissante.

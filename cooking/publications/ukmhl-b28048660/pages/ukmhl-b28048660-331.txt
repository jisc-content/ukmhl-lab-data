Brandy Mixture. A gill of brandy, the same quantity of cinnamon water, beaten up with the yolks of two eggs and half an ounce of pounded sugar.

A tablespoonful of cream, the white of a very fresh egg, and a tablespoonful of brandy; whip first the egg nearly to a froth, then the cream with the egg; add the brandy by degrees, and mix well â€¢ do not let it stand after it is made.

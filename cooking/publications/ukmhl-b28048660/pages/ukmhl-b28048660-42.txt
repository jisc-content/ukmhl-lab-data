14 SOUPS. Then take some lettuces, some parsley, young leeks, and celery ; chop them small and fry them in brown butter, drain them, and add them to your soup. A small piece of bacon may be used to season it. 25. White Soup Maigre. Take a large handful of chervil, four heads of celery, two onions, three lettuces, a little sorrel, thyme, and tarragon; boil these in a quart of water upon the stove till quite stewed down. About a quarter of an hour before dinner take it off and strain it from the herbs, and let it stand till it is cool ; then add to it a pint of good cream, thickened with the yolks of three eggs; stir it well in, and put it on the fire to heat, but do not let it boil. Green peas or asparagus, sorrel or rice, may be added. 26. Another Soup Maigre. Six cucumbers, four lettuces, two onions, a good handful of spinach, a sprig of mint, and a pint of shelled peas, a small piece of ham, and a quarter of a pound of butter; put these into two quarts of water and boil for four hours, and then pass it all through a sieve. When done, put in a pint of green peas well boiled, and a few slices of cucum- ber or any other vegetable you like. The vegetables should be well washed, and the cucumbers and lettuces cut before being put itt.

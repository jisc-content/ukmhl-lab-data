Crystallised Fruits May also be made, when preserved, by first draining them thoroughly from the syrup ; cover them with clarified sugar ; boil a minute or two; drain them on sieves, placing them so that they cannot touch each other; dust them over with coarsely-powdered sugar; when dry on one side, then powder the other; repeat this, and when quite dry put them away in boxes. 768. To Preserve Apricots. Choose ripe apricots ; take the stone out at one end, so that they may look whole ; prick them all over with the point of a knife, and lay them in a shallow stew-pan, taking care they do not touch each other ; add a little clarified sugar to them, but not enough to cover them ; let them boil gently up ; take the pan off, and when the apricots are cold turn them in the pan, and boil them up again ; repeat this twice more, taking care to let them get cold between each turning. When they have, after the last boil-up, stood twelve hours, drain them ; put into each a kernel which you have previously blanched, dust them over with pounded sugar, lay them on tins, and put them into a cool oven to dry. Next day turn them on a sieve, let them get perfectly dry

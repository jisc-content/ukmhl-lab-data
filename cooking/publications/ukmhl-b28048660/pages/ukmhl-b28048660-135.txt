Cut two rabbits or leverets in pieces, trim and put them into a stew-pan with some butter, salt, and pepper; some parsley, shallot, and mushrooms all minced. Pass them over the fire for a quarter of an hour, squeeze a lemon over them, and serve. 281. To Roast Game. No game can be good that is not carefully roasted and thoroughly well basted. It is more tender if cooked imme- diately than if kept a night; burying it, in the ground for a few hours if required to eat immediately makes it more tender; about three days is the best time to keep it. Ducks should be roasted but a short time, and basted â€¢with their own drippings, a little butter, and port wine. Partridges will require about twenty minutes, grouse twenty-five, snipe and woodcocks fifteen; the latter should have buttered paper over them till they are nearly done, it is better than bacon, which spoils their flavour ; a hare requires about an hour, and should be basted with cream and dredged with flour. 282. To Roast Grouse. Two brace of birds will require a pound of fresh butter to baste them; the butter should be put in a basin and allowed to melt before the fire. The birds should not be placed too near the fire at first, and should be basted soon after they are put down, and this should be con- tinued without intermission till they are ready to serve. If you wish to serve them English fashion with a gravy, you must make it from grouse, as all meat gravy would

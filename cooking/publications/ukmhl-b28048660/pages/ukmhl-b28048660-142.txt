Boil the rabbit well; pick the meat from the bones; pound it very fine in a mortar with a small piece of butter; add a little good gravy, a little parsley, and sweet herbs ; season with pepper and salt; add a few bread-crumbs and three eggs; beat it up well. You may cook them in cups or timbale moulds. Butter and flour them first. Put in the boudins, and steam them about three-quarters of an hour. Turn them out, and serve with a rich bechamel. If you have rabbits enough, use only the white meat. 299. Quenelles of Chicken. Take the breast of a fowl and scrape all the meat from the sinews, the same quantity of suet and shred it very fine. Put it in the mortar and pound as smooth as pos- sible ; then take the crumb of a penny roll, wet it in milk, add it to the meat in the mortar, and pound a little more ; rub it through a fine sieve, return it to the mortar, and mix it thoroughly, first with one whole egg, and then with the white of another; season it with salt and pepper to taste, take it out with a tablespoon, smooth it over the top, and put each into a stew-pan with as much broth or water as will cover them. Ten minutes is sufficient to cook them. Serve with a bechamel sauce. 300. Quenelles aux Truffes.

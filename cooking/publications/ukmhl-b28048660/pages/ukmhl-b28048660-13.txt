PREFACE. IX bound to say were very good. First came wbat is called “ Hiihner Suppe”—this was very like soup a la Heine, only with a great deal of chicken cut up in it; next followed Caviar, after which Steinbut (turbot) with oyster sauce; then “Kinder filet naif Triitfeln” (Filet de Bceuf aux Truffes). Up to this point there is nothing very peculiar, but now comes a quite national course : “ Stecli Ruben mit Kastanien ” (turnips with chestnuts) —and here the writer must remark that they are not the turnips usually eaten in England and Scotland, but what are called Swedes, and which in Germany are a favourite vegetable; “ Rothen Kohl mit Kastanien ” (red cabbage with chestnuts); “ Pomeranische Ganse-Brust ” (smoked geese breasts); and “ Leber-Wurst” (a sausage made of pigs’ liver). These remarkable plats were succeeded by Lobster en Aspic, then “Plum-pudding” a VAnglaise, a roast turkey following, and wound up with a large cake and ice. The next day’s dinner began with “ Nachge- machte Schildkroten-suppe ” (mock turtle-soup); Petits pates of lobster; then—horribile dicta!—salmon, quite out of season, succeeded by “ Ente mit Triiffeln ” (ducks with truffles). And now again come the startling dishes —“Kohl mit Austern” (cabbage with oysters!)—it makes one shudder to think of it, but was in fact so good that the writer asked for, and obtained, the receipt from her hostess, and it will be found in the Appendix, No. 24; stewed lentils (“ Linsen ”) and four different kinds of sausages — Leber-Wurst, Frankfurter Brat- Wurst—which are very like Oxfoi’d sausages; Blut- Wurst—almost identical with black puddings; and Knack-Wurst—not unlike white puddings. These were followed by “ Rehbraten ” (roedeer) with different kinds of compotes and salads. Riz a la Malte and dessert brought the dinner to a coiiclusion.

PREFACE. XII “ The drivers must each have a bottle of beer; and if any old men are among them, a dram of brandy; but above everything, be careful not to give them too much; also two good thick slices of brown bread, with apiece of ham-sausage or meat between them, or else a piece of cheese. If you have apples, a basketful should also be given them. Bread, meat, and water ought also to be taken for the dogs : for “ the merciful man is merciful also to his beast.” In some places, the luncheon may be served in a forester’s or farmer’s house, and then the table must be properly covered, and hot dishes, such as cutlets, sausages, and potatoes, added to it.” If an English household would submit to be fed like a German one there is no doubt it would cost the heads of houses much less ; and with their Milch Suppens, Gries Suppens, Bier Suppens, and an endless variety of others, as well as vegetables cooked with fruits, and dressed in all imaginable ways, they look as well fed, healthy, and fully more cheerful than the English consumer of beefsteaks and porter. An English poor family might take many a hint from their German neighbours, and not only satisfy, but gratify, their appetites at a very small cost. The Scotch are much more like the Germans, and their soups, porridge, and cakes have great affinity with the “Briihen Suppen ” and “ Ivuchen ” of this country. The collector hopes that some of the receipts now offered may find favour with the British public, and that the critics who have been so kind to the “Dainty Dishes ” already pub- lished, will not be less lenient to those emanating from a foreign land.

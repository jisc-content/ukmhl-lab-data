SOUPS. fâ€” GOUPS, properly so called, are made from stock which ^ may he made some days beforehand; and this, by the addition of different vegetables, or very often the same merely cut in another shape, or the flavour varied by herbs, becomes Soupa a la Julienne, Printanierc, Pru- noise, etc. etc. For the making of stock, and its subse- quent metamorphosis into these various soups, there are so many directions given in divers excellent French cookery-books that it would be superfluous to introduce them here : the following receipts would be therefore more correctly termed Broths, as they inquire to be fresh-made, and have each an individual character of them own. 1. Pot au Feu. Put in a saucepan six lbs. of beef (bones included) cut into two or three pieces; three-quarters of a lb. of mixed vegetables, such as onions, carrots, turnips, leeks, white cabbage, and celery with its leaves left on. all cut in good-sized pieces ; three small spoonfuls of salt, one of pepper, and one of sugar; add eight pints of water ; let it boil gently three hours ; remove the fat; add crusts of roll or slices of bread, either previously toasted or plain, and serve.

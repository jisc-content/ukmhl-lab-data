352 ADDITIONAL RECEIPTS. 71. Currant Juice. Press ripe currants, and let them stand four or five days, then squeeze and strain out the juice, pour it into bottles, and set them in the sun for a day or two, which makes it clear; now weigh the juice, and to each pound allow a pound of sugar ; boil the sugar till it flies off the spoon in bubbles the size of a pea, pour the juice into it, let it boil up once, skim it carefully, pour it into warm bottles, cork, and rosin the tops of them, and keep in a cool place. 72. Cherry Juice. Choose Maydukes, take off their stalks, bruise them with their stones, put them in a large bowl, and let them stand twenty-four hours ; strain off the juice, add to each pound one of sugar, and boil the same as in the preceding receipt for currants. Mulberries, strawberries, and raspberries may be done in the same way. 73. Pine-Apple Juice. One or more pine-apples may be washed, peeled with a sharp knife very thin, cut into thin slices, and laid in a glazed jar, with finely powdered refined sugar strewed be- tween each layer. To a pound of the fruit from one to two pounds of sugar is allowed ; the sugar must be strewed about one finger thick between each layer of pine-apple. In about two days it will have drawn nearly the juice out; it is then to be strained and poured into small bottles, well corked and sealed, and kept in a cold place. If the slices of pine-apple are again strewed with sugar, they can be kept for making pine-apple cup. All these juices are ex- cellent for making ices in winter, or as pudding sauce, and make, with water or soda-water, cooling pleasant drinks.

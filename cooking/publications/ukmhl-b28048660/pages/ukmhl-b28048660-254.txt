Boil a pint of cream and the same of milk, into which throw a pinch of salt and some sugar; when the cream boils, throw three spoonfuls of the best green tea into it ; give it a boil; add the yolks of ten very fresh eggs ; keep constantly stirring it on the fire till the cream becomes thick, but mind that the eggs are not over-done; then add some melted isinglass; pass it through a tammy, and put it in the mould, which set in ice. When you wish to make the cream more delicate, let it get cold, and before you put the isinglass in, set it in a vessel over ice, and whip it when quite frozen; add some cold melted isinglass. This method requires less isinglass, and the cream is lighter. 622. Orange-Flower Cream. Boil half a pint of cream with a handful of fresh orange- flowers, and let the cream cool; strain and mix with a pint of thick cream; keep whipping it over ice till it is quite thick; add half an ounce of melted isinglass; put it into a mould and surround it with ice.

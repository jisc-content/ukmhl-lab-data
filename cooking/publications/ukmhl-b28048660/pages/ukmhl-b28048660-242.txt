Burnt Cream. Make a rich custard of cream and eggs, boiling lemon- peel in it, hut no sugar. When cold, pour it over the gateau de pommes, sift a good deal of sugar over, and brown the top with a salamander. 588. Apples A la Portugaise. Take eight or nine of the best and largest apples, peel and core them, put them in a pewter dish with a little water, set the dish in the oven, fill the core with sugar. When they are baked enough, serve with either lemon, orange, apricot, or pine-apple marmalade poured over them. 589. Apples with Cream. Pare the apples and cut them in four, take out the core, put them to stew with a little water and sugar in a saucepan. When they begin to fall take them off the fire. In another pan put four yolks of eggs, a spoonful of flour, a pint of good cream, and a little sugar. Set the pan upon a slow fire, and keep stirring the cream continually, taking care it does not boil for fear of curdling it. When done enough, add a glass of madeira or sherry. Arrange the apples in the dish, and pour the sauce over.

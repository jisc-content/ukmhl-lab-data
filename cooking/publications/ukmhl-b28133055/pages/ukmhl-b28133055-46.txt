20 THE CURRY COOK’S ASSISTANT. No. 15.—TRIPE CURRY. Take about two lbs. of good, thick part of the tripe, cut them in about four inches square, or not at all, dip it in hot water, not boiling, but nearly so. Then take out and scrape off all the black stuff, and clean it as white as a white table- cloth, and boil it tender as you boil for “Tripe Fri- cassee.” When cool cut it in half-inch squares, slightly pepper it. Place a stew-pan on fire, and put in a lump of butter. When hot add the tripe, fry it to a brownish gold colour, then take out and put in a plate till required. Now add the Curry stuffs, as No. 4, into the stew-pan on the fire, and turn it over and over till nice and brown. Now add the tripe you fried, and half-pint of good gravy, and let it simmer gently on slow fire. When serving add a tablespoon of cream and few drops of lemon. Some nice spices and a pinch of cayenne pepper should be added when frying the Curry Powders. This is a very nice Curry. By- the-by, the gravy you boil the tripe in should be boiled with other bones, vegetables, etc., and add ,to the Curry instead of other gravy.

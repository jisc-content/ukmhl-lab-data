THE CURRY COOK’S ASSISTANT. 73 No. 58.—TOMATO CURRY. For a pound of young or green tomato, ingre- dients same as for Potato Curry, No. 35, or for Brown Curry same as No. 4, Madras Curry. Treat it same as the Cabbage Curry. But I recommend that tomatoes should be made Brown Curry— tastes nice. Tomato curried is better than all the vegetables if it is properly made. Ripe tomato not nice when curried, only for salads.

56 THE CURRY COOK’S ASSISTANT. No. 44a.—MINT CHUTNEY. J lb. Mint. i oz. Cayenne. 1 lb. Salt. | lb. Raisins. 2 oz. Ginger. J lb. Brown Sugar. 1 oz. Garlic. § Bottle Vinegar to grind the above, 2 Bottle Vinegar, hot, to pour over. Mode.—Grind or pound the above by adding the cold vinegar by degrees to soften. When nice and smooth, put into a bowl and pour over the hot vinegar. When cool, bottle it in tart fruit bottles, and cork well. N.B.—I can give dozens of recipes for chutney. I am afraid it is no use telling in this book, because the ingredients cannot be procured fresh, as mangoes, pineapples, lavi-lavi, blinga, tamarind, ripe chillies, chutnies, etc., etc. The above is a recipe I tried in Newera Eliya, Ceylon, where fresh mint can be had in any quantity of first class, same as in England and Scotland.

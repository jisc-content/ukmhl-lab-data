THE CURRY COOK’S ASSISTANT. 41 No. 31.—FISH CURRY (Salmon). The fish Curry is made several different ways in Ceylon and India, as brown or yellow Curry, but similar to fish moley, hard-boiled egg Curry, No. 22, and the potato Curry, No. 35 ; but you must add a spoonful of chopped ham or corned beef, and use lemon juice, not vinegar. The fish Curry (brown) can be made same as Madras Curry, No. 4. But proceed to make the Curry Sauce, No. 26, then add the fish. As soon as the fish is tender, the Curry is ready. Don’t add any butter to fish Curries. The native cooks use the coriander, saffron, chillies, etc., without roasting them in the frying- pan.—See “Home-made Curry Powder,” No. 1, but grinding it without roasting.

14 THE curry cook’s assistant. No. 9.—SNIPE CURRY. Dress four snipes as for serving on toast; then cut in halves, pepper and salt it, roll it in little (or sprinkle with) flour, and fry it in a large spoon of butter or lard, quarter done or nearly half done. Keep it to a side. Now take a good stew-pan, put on fire, melt a spoonful of butter, and fry a large onion, sliced ; put in I Tablespoon Coriander. I Dessertspoon Rice Powder. A pinch of Cumin Powder. A pinch of Saffron and Spices. Let all these fry gently in the butter, then add half-pint of good gravy, salt to taste, and let this stand on a hot oven simmering gently till required. Five minutes before serving, add the fried snipes, with a few drops of lemon juice, and send to table. Do not let it be too juicy, but the half-pint of gravy should be reduced to a quarter-pint. Cay- enne pepper should be added if preferred hot Curries. Snipe should only be heated through, and not quite overdone. This Curry nice with rice, toast, etc. etc. Can almost be treated as an entree.

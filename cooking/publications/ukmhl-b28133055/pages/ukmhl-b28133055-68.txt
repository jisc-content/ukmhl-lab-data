42 THE CURRY COOK’S ASSISTANT. No. 32.—FISH CURRY (Various). Salmon. Fresh Herrings. Haddocks. Lobsters. Soles. Crabs. Whiting. Oysters. Codfish. Prawns. Whitebait. Shrimps, etc. The above Fish Curries can be made same as Salmon Curry, No. 31, egg Curry (yellow), fish moley, Madras Curry, No. 4, but great care must be taken not to be burned. The soles and whiting are not nice when curried, and the oysters should be used without the liquor. Prawns and shrimps are celebrated Curries if they are freshly caught and properly prepared. Tamarind used for Fish Curries (brown) are very nice—better than lime (lemon) juice or vinegar.

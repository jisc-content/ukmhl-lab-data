PREFACE OF MY FIRST EDITION. XVll “ people were very kind, but he supposed the Ceylon'servants were a novelty.” It is, to say the least, highly creditable to San- tiagoe that, with many duties to perform, and these amid the distracting influences of our Western civili- zation, he should have compiled this useful little guide to the art of Curry cooking. The spirit of Brillat- Savarin and of Soyer is stronger than the ephemeral attractions of an exhibition. Let us hope San- tiagoe’s enterprise will be more lasting than these; that it will achieve its aim in popularizing Ceylon Curries in this country; and that his “ Book on Curries ” will pass through many editions, and bring him the “ little fortune ” he deserves.

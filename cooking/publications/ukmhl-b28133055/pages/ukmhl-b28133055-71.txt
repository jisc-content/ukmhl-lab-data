THE CURRY COOK’S ASSISTANT. 45 No. 35.—POTATO CURRY. For One Pound of Good Potatoes (peeled). Cut them in half-inch squares; put them into a clean stew-pan with an eggspoon of saffron ; one large onion, sliced; one large spoon of chopped ham or corned beef (salt to taste); three parts of a pint of milk. Mix well together; put in a bay leaf; set on fire, and let it simmer till the potatoes are tender. If the three-quarters pint of milk is not sufficient to tender the potatoes, add some good gravy (stock), but not brown stock. When serving, add a quarter pint of milk and a dessert- spoon or more of cream, and let it simmer. When simmering add a few drops of lemon juice, and send to table with boiled rice. But a Brown Curry must accompany the above Curry.

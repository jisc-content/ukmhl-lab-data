THE CURRY COOK’S ASSISTANT. No. 3.—BEEP CURRY (Ceylon). For a Pound of Good Beef (I mean lean). I Tablespoon Coriander Powder and x of Rice Powder. i Eggspoon Saffron Powder and Pinch of Cumin Powder. I Pint good Milk or Gravy. 1 Large Onion or few small ones. 2 Young green Chillies (Capsicum). A bit of Cinnamon (if you like spices) ; Salt to taste. N.B.—In Ceylon all the Curry stuffs are freshly grinded. Cocoanut Juice, Curry Leaves, etc., are used. This is a very delicious Curry to eat with rice boiled or bread toasted. Mode.—Cut the meat in half-inch squares and put into a clean stew-pan with the onions sliced, the chillies in quarters ; then add all the Curry Powder, etc. Mix well with a wooden spoon and add three parts of a pint of milk or gravy; then salt to taste. Set on slow fire for 15 to 20 minutes ; soon as the meat is tender (but not over- done), then add the other quarter of milk and a few drops of lemon juice. Just heat it again and send to table in a vegetable dish with boiled rice separate. If you add gravy to this Curry then you must put in two tablespoons of cream before sending to table.

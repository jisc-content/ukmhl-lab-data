THE CURRY COOK’S ASSISTANT. 11 No. 6.—BEEF CURRY (Dry). Same ingredients as for Madras Curry, No. 4, and prepare the same way, but do not add any milk. Add about four tablespoons of good gravy when preparing, but add two tablespoons of cream five minutes before serving. (If I say dry, not very dry, but second to it; add few drops of lemon when sending to table.) This Curry must be put on very slow fire, a hot oven will do; if so, you must look every five minutes in case it burns. This Curry can be eaten with rice, boiled potatoes, or toast if wished. Some dry Curries are done in a frying-pan within ten minutes, only the onions and Curry stuffs should be browned, and the meat mixed with it. N.B.—Must use a wooden spoon to all Curries when browning the Onion and Curry Stuffs, etc. ; better than a plated one.

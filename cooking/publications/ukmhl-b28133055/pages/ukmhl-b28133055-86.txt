60 THE CURRY COOK’S ASSISTANT. No. 48.—HOW TO MAKE RICE POWDER. Take a pound of good rice, and pick out all the black and other things from it. And now place a frying-pan on fire ; soon as it gets hot put in the rice, and keep on turning till you find it nice and brown colour; then put on a plate to get cool; then pound this in a stone-made mortar or pounder (very fine), and bottle it, well corked. Use a table- spoon to brown Curries.

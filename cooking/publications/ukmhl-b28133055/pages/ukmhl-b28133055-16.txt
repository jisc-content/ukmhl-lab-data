X INTRODUCTION RY J. L. SHAND, ESQ. Because so many of them are pensioners, says the student of finance. Because so many of them are Curry eaters, says the student of hygiene. All human nature requires to be occasionally stimulated, and a mild Curry acts upon the torpid liver, reacts upon the digestive organs, and pro- vides the necessary stimulant without injurious consequences. It is a remarkable fact that nearly all Curry- eating nations are abstainers from strong drinks. Daniel Santiagoe’s English may occasionally pro- voke a smile, but it is “English as she is spoken” by several millions of Her Majesty’s subjects, and its originality often lends it force. Were excuse necessary it would be found in this, that Daniel Santiagoe is a domestic servant to whom English is a foreign tongue. JOHN LOUDOUN SHAND. 24, Rood Lane, London, E.C.

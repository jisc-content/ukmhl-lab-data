28 THE CURRY COOK’S ASSISTANT. o. 22.—EGG CURRY (Brown). Boil the eggs same as No. 21, and put in cold water till wanted. Now prepare Curry sauce (brown) as No. 26, pour over the eggs cut in halves, as egg Curry (yellow). Egg Curries always called in Ceylon “a rest-house Curry,” because in several rest-houses in Ceylon usually not many visitors pass that way, beside these rest-house keepers cannot get fresh beef, etc. They always have plenty of eggs, fowls, native vegetables, etc., but egg Curry only can be made quick. When a gentleman is going from one planting district to another, a box cooly or a horse-keeper (groom) runs in front to a certain place, by order of his master. When he gets into the rest-house, the rest-house keeper knows that a gentleman is coming. At once he will order to kill a chicken and grill it in Scotch form ? and boil two eggs; when this is doing the kitchen mate * will squeeze half of a cocoanut, with little water mix some saffron, salt green chillie, Maidive fish, etc., now * Kitchen mate is a boy kept under the cook to do all the washing, etc., etc.

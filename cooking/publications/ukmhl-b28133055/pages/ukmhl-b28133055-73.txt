THE CURRY COOK’S ASSISTANT. 47 No. 37.—BEAN CURRY. For a Pound of French Beans. Cut up the beans one inch long and prepare same as the cabbage Curry. The same ingredients will do and must accompany a meat Curry to table. These Curries may only be gleeced, if you please, or can serve plain, but the gleece gives a nice smell and good taste. Any Curry can be gleeced. If you wish to make Curry of broad beans, must take off the thicker skin and weigh a pound ; but broad beans are not a useful bean for Curry, but only better as a vegetable by cooking it in a jar with butter and mint.—See Vegetables for Table, as No. 53.

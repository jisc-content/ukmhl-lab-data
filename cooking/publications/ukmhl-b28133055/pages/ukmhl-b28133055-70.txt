44 THE curry cookâ€™s assistant. No. 34. VEGETABLE CURRIES (Various). With reference to above, the potato, knol khol, turnips, carrots, parsnips, vegetable marrow, cucum- ber, beans, etc., can be made same way as potato Curry, No. 35 ; but cabbage, spinach, turnip tops (young shoots), Brussels sprouts, can be made same way as potato Curry, with same ingredients, but the cabbage, Brussels sprouts, etc., take little more time to tenderly boil; therefore extra gravy, milk, butter, and extra spoon of ham or corned beef. Onions should be added for greens. The more good gravy you add the better the Curry. As far as I have seen, there is not many English vegetables can be Curried, but in India and Ceylon there is numberless vegetables, greens, grasses, etc., can be Curried.

PREFACE BY AUTHOR. Xlll Powder. Some Curry Powders tastes of acid, flour, and other mixtures, which I believe is un- wholesome in every means. The Tamils use tamarind for the acid taste. To every brown Curries the Singalese use Gorakka * (a sour fruit), slightly dried, and lime juice to their yellow Curries. There is much different taste between a Singalese Curry and a Tamil Curry—the taste just differs the same as a Madras beef Curry, No. 4, and. a potato Curry (vegetable). The Curries should be treated, same as a ordinary entree. If one article you had too much, it will spoil the whole Curry. If the meat over done, no taste in it. If you have all Curry stuffs, etc., at hand, could make a Curry Sauce in ten minutes the longest, and can warm up any meat for table in it (I mean the brown). The white Curry Sauce is not suitable, unless for a vegetable or fish. I could give several other recipes to Curries, but the above said sixty will be quite sufficient. If you carefully tried the above said Curries will be found most economical. A Madras woman can beat any other Indian * For Fish Curries, but not fresh fish—the fresh fish could be given acid taste from lemon, or tamarind, or vinegar.

50 THE CURRY COOK’S ASSISTANT. No. 40.—DEVILLED MEAT (Various). Same ingredients as for biscuits, No. 39, but meat must be cut two inches long and added to the stew-pan soon as the onions are fried. Give it stirring for some while by turning the pieces of meat in it. By-the-bye, the fresh meat should be fried a little brown, because fresh meat devilled always tough unless the meat is undercut. Extra spoons of gravy should be added to devilled meats. Cuttings from cold joints are nice devilled; but fresh beef ought to be of tender part (as I said before, undercut). Fowl, duck, mutton, turkey, geese can be done in same way (I mean from joints roasted beforehand) ; but you must reduce or exceed the ingredients for the amount of weight. The quantities given for devilled biscuits are suffi- cient for 1 lb., or less of meat. Be careful not to burn.—See Devilled Biscuits.

THE CURRY COOK’S ASSISTANT. 32 No. 25.—FRIED EGGS FOR CURRIES. Beat up the eggs same as for savoury omelet, but omit the sweet herbs, add chopped ham, salt, pepper, dash of flour, and pinch of cayenne, and fry in butter or lard (same as omelets, or in small cakes). Send to table with the Curry and rice in separate dish. The above dish (usually the native way) not used in gentlemen’s houses, but I recom- mend it to be tried.

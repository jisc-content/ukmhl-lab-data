e8 the curry cook’s assistant. No. 13. MUTTON CURRY. For One Pound Mutton (without Fat). Ingredients same as for Madras Curry, No. 4 but not the. quantity. Only three parts should be taken of each; the Curry stuffs need not be fried as for Madras Curries, but cut the mutton in half- inch squares, put into a stew-pan, and then add the Curry stuffs (powders?), spices, etc., and add a tablespoon of cream when serving, as well as a few drops lemon juice. Curries made from mutton are not so nice as if made from tender part of beef, but in India and Ceylon several castes do not touch beef—they call themselves high caste people, and bear numerous names— they always eat mutton, fowl, vegetable, etc. The Brahman caste never eat any meat of any sort; still they eat the pure juice of beef—as milk, ghee,* butter, and another kind of medicine made out of the flesh of the ox, called in Tamil “ paroong kayam.” j * Ghee is only melted butter, much used in India, most by- Bengali. t Natives of India says it is a very useful medicine, but I myself know too little history about it, but has a nasty smell.

THE CURRY COOK’S ASSISTANT. 19 No. 14.—PARTRIDGE CURRY. I have nothing to say for this Curry, because you can imitate the pigeon Curry; anyhow you must put in strong gravy, as partridge does not taste nice if curried. If you have any partridge left from dinner, the next day you may Curry it same as pigeon, but don’t let it simmer too long over the oven. Any kind of game (birds ?) can be made same as the pigeon.

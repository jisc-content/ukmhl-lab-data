THE CURRY COOK’S ASSISTANT. 61 No. 49.—MUSHROOMS CURRIED AND SERVED ON TOAST. Pick out half-pound of fresh and good mush- rooms; sprinkle with little pepper and salt. Now prepare Curry sauce as for Snipe Curry. Fry the mushrooms in a dessertspoon of butter, and add to the Curry sauce; let it simmer gently for five minutes, then serve on hot toast. A nice dish for lunch or supper. When eating, a dash of cayenne and mushroom ketchup may be a nice taste. Try the above.

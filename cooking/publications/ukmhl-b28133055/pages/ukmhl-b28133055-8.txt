NOTE ABOUT “CURRIES” IN “SATURDAY REVIEW,” OCTOBER 22, 1887. Everybody who likes Curry, and who can get it (the pamphlet, not the Curry), should invest in a little pamphlet by “Daniel Santiagoe, son of Francis Daniel, butler and fiddler, of Colombo, Ceylon, and the Ceylon Court, Royal Jubilee Exhibition, Liverpool.” It is written in delightful pigeon-English (or whatever other bird may be more appro- priate to Ceylon’s isle), is quite unpretentious, avows the author’s very legitimate, and, indeed, laudable desire to “make a small fortune” by its sale, and contains admirable receipts. Mr. Santiagoe is much less cynical than the apocryphal Mrs. Glasse. He says, after recommend- ing the more excellent way of the Curry Stone, “The best and easy way is to buy from your respected grocers, which, I should say, ought to be of two colours—one is brown and the other is yellow, and the red is cayenne pepper (if required, hot curries).” He is a little plaintive about mulligatawny. “Why English people always spell this word wrong ? Everybody knows this—mollagoo, ‘ pepper ; ’ tanney, ‘ water.’ ” So the reformers who call it “ mulligatunny ” are just as bad as we devotees of mumpsimus and mulligatawny ourselves. We note with special pleasure a receipt for ‘ ‘ chicken moley ”—evidently the same genus as that “mollet” which puzzled Mrs. Clarke. And all the pre- scriptions are interesting. “ Maidive fish ” seems to take the place of “ Bombay duck” in these southern regions, and the number of Vege- table Curries is particularly noteworthy. Nobody need think from the specimens we have given that Mr. Santiagoe is unintelligible. His English may be “pigeon,” but it is a much more easily digestible tongue than the high and mighty gobble-gobble of some of our own professors of style and matter.

PREFACE BY AUTHOR. XIV woman in Curry cooking. In several gentry’s houses in Madras, etc., they keep a woman to make Curries and prepare vegetables for table— we call her “ Thanney Kareyitchi ”—besides the cook and kitchen matey. The Madras Curry always the best, much dif- ferent than a Bengal or Bombay Curry, to my opinion. D. SANTIAGOE. International Exhibition, Glasgow, 1888.

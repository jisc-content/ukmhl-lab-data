THE CURRY COOK’S ASSISTANT. 65 yolks of eggs, mustard, sugar, salt, butter. When nice and smooth add the milk or cream. After mixed add the vinegar, and mix well and keep separate. When sending to table just pour the sauce all over the salad with a spoon. Let it stand for two minutes and serve. The above can be made with or without meat, and also with lettuce if at hand. Several other salads could be made as learned cooks have written in the cooks’ books; but the above I tried myself in one of my former masters’ bungalows in Ceylon and in England. V

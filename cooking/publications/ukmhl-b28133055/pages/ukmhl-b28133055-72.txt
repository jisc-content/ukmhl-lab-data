46 THE CURRY COOK’S ASSISTANT. No. 36.—CABBAGE CURRY. Take half of a small cabbage, and cut it with a sharp knife as big as you cutting a lettuce for a salad ; wash it thoroughly clean ; put into a stew- pan with a pint of gravy, and boil it till half done. Now take it off the fire; add an eggspoonful of saffron powder ; two large spoons of chopped ham, etc. ; a pinch of cayenne (if required hot); one large onion, sliced; salt to taste. Mix well; set on fire. More gravy or milk should be added, till the cabbage is soft as usual form.

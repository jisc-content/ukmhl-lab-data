THE CURRY COOK’S ASSISTANT. 31 No. 24.—EGG CURRY (Poached). Prepare Curry sauce, brown or yellow, as Nos. 26, 27. When serving just let the Curry sauce simmer gently Now break the eggs carefully and put in the Curry sauce, each separately. Same as poaching eggs in a frying-pan. The pan must be a wide stew-pan. When dishing you must carefully take the yolks without breaking them and pour over the gravy, and send to table with boiled rice ; and thin slices of ham should be handed round with this Curry and rice. Don’t forget the sam- ball for every Curry, as well as fried red herring.

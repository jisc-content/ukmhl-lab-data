Divide the sauce equally among the three dishes, pouring it over the cauliflowers to cover them smoothly, and sprinkle on the top of each two ounces of grated Parmesan. Put the dishes in the hot oven for about fifteen minutes to brown, and serve hot. This dish can be served with meat, or sent up as a separate vegetable course. Roast Pheasants. Proceed to spit the birds as directed on page 37 for fowls and chickens. Put them in the roaster, previously heated for ten minutes, with two table-spoonfuls of beef dripping. Baste well, and start the turnspit. Allow five minutes with the gas full on, basting liberally, then turn the gas to half full on for fifteen minutes, and turn it again full on for ten minutes. Do not baste during the last five minutes. Serve with what gravy has fallen from the birds added to a pint of good clear beef gravy (see page 57). A sprig of watercress should be put on each plate, and bread sauce handed round as well as gravy.

When boiling, stir into it two ounces of fresh butter, and add gradually four ounces of freshly-made bread crumbs. Reduce the gas to half full on, simmer for twenty minutes, pick out the shallot and cloves, and pour in a quarter of a pint of cream, add a pinch of salt and a little white pepper, mix well, boil for five minutes more, and serve. Note.—Pheasants can have a piece of bacon about four or five inches square tied on the breast to keep them moist.

Batter for Frying.—Apple fritters, kromeskies, and various other things, are fried in batter, made as follows :— Put four ounces of sifted flour in a basin. Make a hole in the middle, and pour in rather more than a quarter of a pint of water; add a pinch of salt. Mix these together, add gradually two yolks of eggs and two table-spoonfuls of oil. Mix well until quite smooth ; it should be thick enough to coat a spoon to the thickness of a quarter of an inch. If too thick, add a little water; twenty minutes before using, whisk the whites of the eggs until very firm, mix them in, and the batter is ready for use. If this batter is used for sweet things, such as apple fritters, use very little salt, but it should never be quite without salt. The batter is always better if made several hours before it is wanted, as it gets then much lighter than if used at once. Crofitons and Croustades.—Croutons make a pretty garnish for many dishes, and are easily made. Cut bread, fairly stale, in slices about three-eighths of an inch thick and free from crust; stamp it into pretty shapes with pastry cutters. Heat the fat as for frying fish, and put the frying basket in it. The fat being hot and still, put the croutons in the basket and fry them a golden brown, drain them on a hot cloth, and use them as soon as they are dry. Croutons for soups are made by cutting bread in slices as di- rected above, and dividing the slices in small dice. Fry these in the same manner, drain very thoroughly on a hot cloth, and serve on a small plate covered with a lace paper. Croustades are made thicker, half an inch if a pure'e is to be spread on them, and as much as an inch and a half if the middle is to be scooped out as for croustades of chicken, cups for plovers’ eggs, etc. In this case, cut the croustades with a round or oval pastry cutter, and, using a smaller one,

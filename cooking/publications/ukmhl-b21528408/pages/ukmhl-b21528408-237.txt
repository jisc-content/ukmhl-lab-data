L UNC H EONS—No VEMBER. 223 Victoria Sandwiches. Take four eggs, half a pound of fresh butter, half a pound of fine sifted flour, and half a pound of castor sugar. Beat the butter to a cream with a wooden spoon in a basin, gradually add the flour, the sugar, and a pinch of salt. Whisk the eggs briskly in a separate basin, add them gradually, and beat all together for ten minutes. Pour the mixture in a baking-tin or two, making it about a quarter of an inch thick. Light the gas in the oven of the kitchener for ten minutes, put in the tins, reduce the gas to three-quarter full on, and bake for twenty minutes. Turn the pastry out, let it cool. Spread on half of it a layer of any jam free from stones, and warmed to make it spread more easily. Put the other half of the pastry over, and divide it in pieces about three inches long by one and a half wide. These can be either sprinkled with a little castor sugar or covered with icing sugar, and put in the warm oven to set, or even glazed with icing. If icing is used (see page 80), it should be coloured according to the jam in the sandwiches, pink if the jam is strawberry or raspberry, or a delicate green for greengage jam. Keep the sandwiches on a pastry-rack in a warm place until the icing is set. Arrange them standing round a dish, each overlapping the other. These are useful also for cold suppers or five o’clock tea. Prepare two quarts of mussels as in the recipe for sole normande (see page 219), doing one quart at a time, for if all are put in at once they will be too much piled up to cook evenly. As they open and are done, take them out NOVEMBER. Mussels a la Mariniere. Civet of Hare. Fried Salsifis. Pears in Syrup. Moules a la Mariniere. Civet de Li6vre. Salsifis Frits. Compote de Poires.

Home Dinnersâ€”March. 135 sifted flour, fry without discolouring for five minutes, add three pints of good white fish-stock, the beards of the oysters, and their liquor strained. Stir all these gently until the soup boils, then reduce the gas to half full on, and simmer for half an hour, skimming carefully. Strain the soup, and return it to the stewpan, which has been rinsed and wiped. Beat three yolks of eggs with a quarter of a pint of cream, and a tea-spoonful of anchovy sauce, add this gradually to the soup, stirring to mix it well. Heat it tho- roughly, but do not allow it to boil. Have ready some boiling water in a saucepan over the gas turned three- quarter full on. Put a strainer or wire-basket in this, and when the water boils again with the basket in it, just lift the basket above the water, put the oysters in, and plunge them in the boiling water for half a minute at the most. Put the oysters in the hot soup-tureen, and pour the soup over them. Serve with a royal custard, made like that on page 66, but coloured a bright red with a few drops of car- mine, and cut it in small fancy shapes. Or serve the soup with small fried croutons on a separate plate. Fillets of Sole in Aspic. Wash and skin a fine sole, fillet it. For this make an incision down the middle of the fish along the back-bone. Then, holding the knife nearly flat on the fish, slip it between the flesh and the bone all the way down, make another cut just inside the edge of the sole, and lift off the fillet. Having removed the four fillets in the same way, put them on the table and bat them flat with a knife dipped in cold water. Put a little salt and a few drops of lemon juice on each fillet, lay them on a buttered baking-tin and cover them with a buttered paper. Light the gas in the oven for ten minutes. Put the fillets in to cook for eight or ten minutes, according to their thickness. When they look white and opaque they are done. Put them aside to cool

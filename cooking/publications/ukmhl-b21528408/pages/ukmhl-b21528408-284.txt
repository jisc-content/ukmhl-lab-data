270 The Art of Cooking by Gas. of butter and rub it in the flour, add a tea-spoonful of salt. Put in a small basin three-quarters of an ounce of French yeast, and a tea-spoonful of Demerara sugar, work these together until smooth and creamy, add half a pint of milk. Pour these gradually into the flour, working it into a smooth dough quickly and lightly. Cover the dough and leave it in a warm place to rise for an hour. Heat the oven of the Charing Cross kitchener or the Parisienne roaster for fifteen minutes. Divide the dough into twelve pieces, and form these into fancy rolls without handling them too much. Arrange them on a lightly-floured baking sheet, brush them over with a little water, and bake them for twenty minutes with the gas three-quarter full on. These are good hot or cold. Wheaten Biscuits. Rub six ounces of butter into a pound of wheat meal, add a tea-spoonful of salt, and work with very little water into a short paste. Roll it out to the thick- ness of a quarter of an inch, stamp it with a round pastry cutter three inches in diameter, and put the biscuits on a baking-sheet. Light the gas in the Parisienne roaster or the oven of the kitchener for ten minutes, and bake the biscuits for ten to twelve minutes. For sweet biscuits, put only half a tea-spoonful of salt, and add two ounces and a half of castor sugar. The recipe for these biscuits was given to me by a gentleman who invented them for his own use, and they will prove invaluable to people whose digestion is trouble- some. They are excellent, and can be eaten unsweetened with meat, etc., instead of bread. Sweetened they are great favourites with children, and are, of course, far more whole- some and digestible than the ordinary biscuits. Oatmeal biscuits can be made in the same way by using medium oatmeal instead of wheat.

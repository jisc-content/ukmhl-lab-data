Put the fish on a very hot dish, and garnish with fried parsley and sliced lemon. Send up with it a lemon cut in halves. An oval silver or plated dish looks best to serve the sole on. Galantine. Bone a fine young fowl. The simplest way to do this is to split the bird open down the back, and, with a small sharp knife, cut out all the bones from the inside, not for- getting to remove the sinews from the legs, and taking care not to break through the skin. The best way, however, is to bone the fowl from the neck without cutting the skin at all. This is more satisfactory but requires practice, and written directions would be of little use in teaching it. See- ing it done would be far more to the purpose, and indeed it is the only real way of learning how to bone. The fowl being boned, fill it with a forcemeat as below, press it to- gether with the hands to make it a good shape, and roll it in a buttered cloth, giving it the shape of a short thick sausage ; tie it tightly at both ends. Put three quarts of light stock in the braising-pan, add the bones of the fowl, broken small, an onion stuck with two cloves, a carrot and a small turnip peeled and quartered, a little celery, a bunch of herbs, and six peppercorns. Set this over the gas turned three-quarter full on and boil up. Skim, put in the galantine, and bring again to boiling-point, reduce the gas to half full on, and simmer for two hours, skimming occasionally. Take the galantine out, unpack it, wash the cloth and wring it dry. Tie the galantine tightly in it as before, put it between two dishes with a weight on the top and let it cool. In the mean- time, strain the stock, remove the fat from it, and use it for making an aspic jelly (see page 70), adding gelatine in the proportion of three ounces to the quart in wder to obtain a very stiff jelly. Pour the jelly on a baking-tin to the depth

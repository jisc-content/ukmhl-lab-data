Breakfasts—November. 263 and so on until the terrine is full, making the top layer of forcemeat, cover with very thin slices of fat bacon, and put on the top a large bay-leaf. Pour in gently half a pint of good beef gravy and a wine-glassful of port wine. Cover with the lid. Make a strip of paste with a little flour and the white of an egg, and lute the edge of the cover with this, so that no steam may escape. Put the braising-pan on the fire with enough water in it to. come about two inches up the- side of the terrine (this can be tried beforehand to ascertain the quantity). Boil up over the gas turned full on, put in the terrine, reduce the gas to three-quarter full on, and bring to boiling-point again, then reduce the gas to half- full on, cover the pan and put on the braising-burner turned barely half full on, simmer very gently for three hours. Or stand the terrine in a pan of boiling water and bake in the oven for the same time. In the meantime, put the bones of the hare to stew with a pound of beef, the rind of the bacon and ham—well scraped and washed—the trimmings of the veal and pork, one quart of water, vegetables, and herbs (see “ Gravies,” page 57). Simmer these gently for two hours, remove the fat, and strain the gravy. Put it in a saucepan, and boil it without a cover over the gas turned three-quarter full on until it is reduced to about three-quarters of a pint, skim it carefully, set it aside to cool. The terrine being done, take it out, leave it to cool for half an hour, remove the paste from the edge, lift the cover, and fill up with the gravy, which is cool, but not cold. Cover again immediately, and gum a band of paper or tinfoil over the edges to exclude the air. Put the terrine away in a cool place for at least twenty- four hours before it is used.

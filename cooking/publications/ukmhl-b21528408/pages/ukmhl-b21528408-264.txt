Or when they are boiled, shell them quite hot, stand each egg upright on a croustade prepared as directed on page 50 ; put these on a hot dish, pour over them a Madeira or Perigueux sauce, and serve hot. Thus prepared the eggs are also suitable for luncheon or dinner. This delicious fish is but little known inland, and I can only suppose that its very delicacy prevents it from travel- ling safely, for at seaside places it is often exceedingly plentiful. I can say from personal experience that pout caught in the afternoon and eaten at dinner is far more tasty than if they are kept until the next morning, even in a cool place. When eaten quite fresh they are much more delicate than the whiting, and the flesh is of a beautiful pearly white. The fish should be cleaned as soon as prac- ticable after they are caught, and if possible washed in sea water. Skin and wipe them, flour them lightly, brush them with beaten egg, and cover them with bread-crumbs, fry in hot fat. Drain thoroughly on a hot cloth, garnish with fried parsley, and serve hot at once with quartered lemons. Melted butter or ravigote sauce may be sent up with these. They are also excellent au gratin (see “Sole au Gratin,” page 143 ) or filleted and fried like the ordinary whiting. I may here remark that whole whiting are very usually fried with the tail passed through the eye-holes. I cannot think this a good plan, and have already recommended to fillet them (see page 184), for when a whole one is served to each person the quantity of bones, etc., left on the plate JUNE.

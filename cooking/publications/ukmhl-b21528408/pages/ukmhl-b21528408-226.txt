The Art of Cooking by Gas. 2 1 2 Chicken Fricassee. Choose for this dish a fine young fowl, rather fleshy than fat. Divide it in neat joints, taking care to break the skin as little as possible. Cut the pinions from the wings, and the thighs from the legs; divide the neck, the breast, and the back in two pieces each. Trim all the joints neatly, and rub them with lemon-juice, taking care not to peel off the skin. Melt an ounce of butter in a stewpan over the gas, turned three-quarter full on, and mix smoothly with it an ounce of flour; cook this for five minutes without discolour- ing, add a pint of white stock, a salt-spoonful of pepper, a bunch of herbs, a little chive, and two cloves. Mix well; add the pieces of chicken. Butter a piece of paper and cover the stewpan with it, and put on the lid a little on one side, so that it does not quite cover the pan. Reduce the gas to half full on, and occasionally give the saucepan a gentle shake. Prepare twelve very small onions by peeling them and throwing them in boiling water to which a pinch of salt has been added. Boil them for five minutes, strain them, and lay them in cold water. Clean two dozen button mushrooms by cutting off the tip of the stalks and throwing them in a basin of cold water. Wash them quickly to remove any grit that may be adhering to them. Drain them ; put in a stewpan a table-spoonful of water, one ot lemon-juice, and a salt-spoonful of salt. Peel the mush- rooms thinly and throw them one by one in the stewpan, shake it so that they may get well rolled in the salt and lemon-juice, which will whiten them. When they are all in, add an ounce of butter, turn the gas on under the pan and boil for five minutes, shaking the pan repeatedly to cook the mushrooms evenly. Turn them out with their liquor in a basin, and cover them with a piece of buttered paper to prevent them from discolouring.

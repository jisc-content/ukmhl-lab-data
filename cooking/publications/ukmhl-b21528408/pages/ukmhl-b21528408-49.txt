General Directions—Roasting. 35 fifteen minutes full on again, making a total of one hour. Mutton.-—Saw the knuckle-bone off within two inches of the meat, and trim off the pieces of skin at the loin end with a sharp knife. Spit the joint as directed, start the turnspit, and, supposing the joint to weigh eight pounds, allow ten minutes after the meat is put in with the gas full on, fifty minutes with the gas three-quarter full on, and twenty minutes full on at the last, making a total of one hour and twenty minutes. Excellent gravy can be made from the knuckle- bone and trimmings ; for directions see “ Gravies,” page 57. A small joint of mutton, such as a cut from the neck, weighing about three pounds, will take forty minutes. Allow five minutes with the gas full on, half an hour with it half- full on. and turn it again full on for five minutes at the last to brown the joint. Being fatter than a leg it will require less basting, except just at the beginning. Lamb will take rather longer than mutton to roast, as the heat must be slow in order not to dry up the meat, and at the same time it must be very thoroughly done. Full directions are given on page 73 for roasting a fore-quarter of lamb, and on page 149 for roasting a leg of lamb. Veal.—This requires very careful cooking, and when either put before a fire or baked in an oven is often burnt and dried up, its delicate juices being very readily affected by too fierce a heat, whilst, unless thoroughly done, it will be both unpalatable and indigestible. Choose a piece of the fillet of veal weighing about eight pounds. Remove the bone, and wipe the joint. Make a forcemeat as below, and fill the place of the bone with it; put some also under the flap ; draw this round, and bind it tightly so as to make the joint compact and round. Fasten with skewers over the side in which the forcemeat has been put the piece of skin which the butcher has sent with the joint; this will have the double advantage of keeping the forcemeat

Breakfasts. 233 Coffee. If the improved coffee-urn described on page 29 is in use, the coffee will be made as follows :â€”Pour a quart of cold water in the lower recipient and light the gas under it. Screw on the upper reservoir, and put in it four ounces of freshly-roasted coffee which has been ground whilst hot. Let the water boil up until it forces its way through the coffee and fills the reservoir. Stir gently with a spoon while it rises, and as soon as the reservoir is full turn down the gas quite low, continue stirring and the coffee will gradually be drawn back into the lower vessel by the vacuum thus created. When only the grounds remain in the upper cup, turn on the gas again and let the coffee come up a second time, stirring as before and taking care to turn the gas out as soon as the reservoir is full. Let it sink through again and the coffee is made. Unscrew the top reservoir and put it aside ; put on the loose cover. Stand a cup under the tap and pour out the coffee If more than one lot of coffee is required, the upper reservoir can be emptied and washed at once, the necessary quantity of freshly-ground coffee put in, and the operation repeated as many times as desired. If the coffee used is not freshly roasted, weigh the necessary quantity, put it in an iron ladle and warm it, taking care not to burn it, over the gas three-quarter full on, to develop the aroma, grind it whilst hot and use at once. Larger or smaller quantities can be made in the same manner,, always observing the proportions of two ounces of coffee to a pint of water. The usual size coffee- urn will hold two quarts of coffee. To make coffee in the French percolator, put the coffee, freshly roasted and ground as above, in the upper part, and pour boiling water slowly over it, a little at a time, until the requisite quantity is obtained, keeping the percolator in a warm place while the coffee runs through it. If the coffee is not served at the table in the same vessel, the coffee-pot

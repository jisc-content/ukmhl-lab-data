26o The Art of Cooking by Gas. refer to the water souchet, which is nothing more than the fish served in the very plain liquor in which it has been boiled. This might be suitable for an invalid requiring very plain food; that is, if the invalid could be reconciled to the look of it, but I do not see how small fish floating about in a sort of portable aquarium, filled with more or less pellucid water, can be considered an elegant and appetizing dish. The dab is too delicate to be boiled, and the best way to deal with it is to fry it crisply like a sole or whiting, and serve it garnished with fried parsley and slices of lemon. (See page 46, “ Directions for Frying P'ish.”) Melted butter, anchovy sauce, ravigote, or bearnaise, are all suitable to serve with this fish, and will be found under their respective headings. Dabs are also excellent au gratin (see “ Sole au Gratin,” page 143), reckoning three or four dabs as the equivalent of one sole. Should they be at all likely to be muddy, put them, after they are cleansed, in salt and water, with a table-spoonful of vinegar to each quart of water, for an hour before cooking them. Broiled Sausages. Excellent sausages of various kinds can be obtained from good poulterers and other shops, but if it is necessary to prepare them at home, the following recipe will be found useful:—Mince finely half a pound of lean fresh pork and half a pound of fat bacon, both quite free from skin and gristle; add two ounces of bread, which has been soaked in milk and squeezed nearly dry. Pound these well together with a tea-spoonful of pepper, a tea-spoonful of salt, a tea- spoonful of powdered sage, a pinch of powdered mace, one of powdered allspice, and one of cloves. When quite smooth, put it in sausage skins, and divide it in six sausages of equal length. Prick these in several places with a larding- needle; light the gas in the grillcr for three minutes. Wipe

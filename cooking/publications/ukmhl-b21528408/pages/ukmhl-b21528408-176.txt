The Art of Cooking by Gas. 162 hot dish. Drain the turnips; arrange them round the mutton. Put half a pint of the mutton liquor in a small saucepan over the gas, turned full on; boil it up for three minutes ; while dishing up the mutton and turnips, skim it; pour it in the dish. Serve with caper sauce in a boat. If this dish is prepared at a time of the year when turnips are fully grown cut them in quarters, boil them for an hour, strain them, rub them through a sieve, and warm them in a stewpan with an ounce of butter, a pinch of salt, and a very little pepper. The liquor in which the mutton has been boiled makes good white stock for soups. The knuckle and trimmings will yield half a pint of good gravy. The fat is useful for frying. Caper Sauce.â€”Make half a pint of melted butter as directed on page x 15, but use, instead of hot water or milk, the same quantity of liquor in which the mutton has been boiled, and put in two tea-spoonfuls of French vinegar instead of lemon juice; add a table-spoonful of capers either whole or chopped up, and serve. The capers left whole look better in the sauce, but, if chopped up, they yield more flavour. Potatoes Browned. Boil three pounds of medium-sized potatoes, allowing five minutes less than usual to prevent them from breaking. Drain and peel them ; cut them in halves. Dissolve two ounces of butter in a stewpan, add a little pepper and salt, dip the potatoes in, roll them in brown bread-crumbs, and put them on a baking-tin under the griller for ten or twelve minutes. In the present instance, the fish having been grilled, the griller will be very hot, and the potatoes can be put in as soon as the grid and pan have been removed. But if the griller has not been in use, light the gas for five minutes before putting the potatoes under it. When done

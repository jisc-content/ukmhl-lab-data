The nougats, if put in a tin box with a thick layer of paper at the bottom, and some paper between them, will keep well for a few days, and can at any time be filled up with cream, preserved fruit, or even ice ; so that they are a very useful as well as a pretty dish. Keep them in a cool dry place. Cheese Straws. Grate eight ounces of Parmesan cheese. Put it in a basin and sift into it eight ounces of fine flour. Mix well together, rub in eight ounces of butter ; then break, one at a time, four eggs in the basin, mixing each egg well in before adding the next one. Add half a salt-spoonful of cayenne pepper and a little salt. No exact quantity can be given for this last, cheeses varying greatly in degree of salt- ness. Flour a pastry board and turn the paste out on it. Roll out carefully and evenly to thickness of straw. With two round pastry cutters, one smaller than the other, cut some rings, and with a sharp knife divide the rest of the paste into straws three inches long; the trimmings and edges can be rolled again and cut until all is used up. Put the straws and rings on a wet baking-tin into the hot oven of the kitchener, with the gas turned three-quarter full on, for about ten minutes. They should be a pretty light brown when done. Dish by putting five or six straws through each ring. These can be kept for a few days in a cool place, and warmed for a few minutes when wanted. MENU FOR OCTOBER. Twenty-four Gnats. POTAGE. SOUP.

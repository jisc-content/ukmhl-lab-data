Tomato Soup Cut a rasher of bacon in small pieces ; put it in a stew- pan with an ounce of butter, a sliced carrot, an onion stuck with two cloves, a bunch of herbs, and a stick or two of celery. Set the pan over the gas, turned three-quarter full on, and fry the vegetables, etc., a bright brown ; add two pounds of tomatoes cut in quarters, and three pints of stock, a tea-spoonful of salt, and six peppercorns. Simmer over the gas turned half-full on for half an hour. Rub the soup through a sieve into a basin, rinse and wipe the stewpan. Return the soup to it, and if it is liked rather thick, add to it a dessert-spoonful of crushed tapioca. Turn the gas three-quarter full on, bring the soup just to boiling-point, and serve. Send up fried dice of bread on a plate with it. Carefully wipe the mullet, but do not wash it, trim off the fins, and take out the eyes. Leave the trails in. Score the fish with five or six slanting cuts on both sides; lay them in a deep dish with four table-spoonfuls of Lucca oil, an onion cut in thin slices, a sprig of parsley, a salt-spoonful of salt, and a pinch of pepper. This quantity is sufficient for three medium-sized mullets. Leave them for two hours in this marinade, turning them once over. Heat the griller for five minutes, wipe the grid and pan. Lift the fish out of the marinade, taking care that no onion or parsley adheres Red Mullet Grilled,

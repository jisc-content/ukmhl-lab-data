General Directionsâ€”Grilling. 49 and put it in the bread crumbs; cover it with these, and roll it well in without touching it at first with the hands. When the bread crumbs are adhering to it all round, it will be dry enough to handle, and must be lightly patted into good shape with the fingers and knife, and put on a dish ready for frying. Sweetbreads, chicken and lobster cutlets, potato cro- quettes, are all treated in the same way. It is a great con- venience that they can be prepared and covered with egg and bread crumbs some hours before they are required for frying, as this leaves the cook free to attend to other things, knowing well that the frying and draining will occupy but a few minutes. Lamb cutlets should have a little pepper and salt sprinkled on each side, be dipped in clarified butter, rolled in bread crumbs, then be brushed over with the egg and receive a second coat of bread crumbs. These are, of course, not to be fried, but grilled. Fish fried whole or in fillets should be well washed, thoroughly dried with a cloth, then passed in flour to which a little pepper and salt has been added, and egg and bread- crumbed at once. It must not be floured and put by, but floured and covered with egg and bread crumbs immediately. It can then remain until wanted.

It does not require such a high temperature as fish or croquettes, so the gas can be lowered to hardly half full on. It makes a great hissing and spluttering on going into the fat on account of the moisture which clings to it. Dry E

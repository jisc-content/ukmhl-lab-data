Luncheons—Ma y. 201 Asparagus for Omelet.—The green asparagus with long slender stalks is best for this purpose. Cleanse about four dozen sticks of asparagus, cutting off the end of the stalks, and boil them for twenty minutes in water with a little salt added to it. Drain them, cut all the tender part in pieces half an inch long; there ought to be enough to fill a half-pint measure. Melt an ounce of butter in a stewpan, and mix smoothly with it half an ounce of flour ; add half a pint of white stock; mix well, and when smooth, boil over the gas, turned three-quarter full on, to reduce the sauce until quite creamy-looking; add a little pepper and a very-little salt if necessary.

Add three-quarters of a pint of stock, mix well and boil up, skim, and boil for five minutes. Strain the sauce, rinse and wipe the stewpan. Put in the duck, a bunch of herbs, a very little fresh sage, and an onion stuck with two cloves. As soon as these are nearly boiling, reduce the gas to half full on, and simmer for half an hour. Add twenty-four small young turnips (prepared as below), and simmer again until the turnips are done; they will take about fifteen minutes, being already half cooked. Prick them with a larding-needle ; if it goes through easily they are done. Remove the string, put the

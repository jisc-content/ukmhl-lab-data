Fill the coffee roaster up to the centre rod, not more, to allow for swelling and shaking. Light the burners under the roaster and set it going. In a few minutes take up the roaster, shake it well, and put it back ; take it up again several times, opening it occasionally to see that the coffee is roasting evenly and not too quickly. When different coffees are roasted for blending, they should be roasted separately, as the time required varies according to the different sorts. Thus, Mocha will take from twelve to fifteen minutes to roast, whilst Plantation coffee wants nearly thirty minutes. Experience only will tell the cook when the coffee is done, as it will then have acquired a rich brown colour and a fully-developed aroma. Turn the coffee out into a colander, and shake out the husks. It is then ready for use; and the sooner it is used the better it will be, as coffee loses its aroma rapidly. Roasted coffee, if kept at all, should be kept in a tightly-corked bottle. If it has been kept a few days, its aroma can be revived and improved by warming the berries thoroughly in an iron ladle or shallow pan over the gas, taking care not to burn them. Grind while hot and use at once. (For coffee making see “Breakfasts,” page 233).

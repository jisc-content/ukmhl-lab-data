General Directionsâ€”Baking. 6i in the case of sorrel and spinach, in order to prepare them for chopping up. Macaroni and rice are similarly treated to remove the impurities from the surface, and prepare them for cooking in stock or rnilk. Almonds and pistachio nuts are also blanched, in order to remove their skin before using them. Baking. Baking can be done in the Parisienne roaster, the Charing Cross kitchener, and other kitcheners of a similar type, the temperature of which may be raised as high as 500 and 600 degrees, if necessary; but for most baking opera- tions a much more moderate temperature will be sufficient. Asbestos-lined baking sheets are provided, which prevent the heat from striking too fiercely from under, and steel plates which, fitting the upper shelf of the Charing Cross kitchener, reverberate the heat and ensure uniform baking. Full directions are given further on for the baking of bread and cakes, which require the greatest heat. The meat and game put in raised pies, or pies in dishes, should be partly cooked and cooled before it is put in, or the pastry will be done before the contents. Fruit, on the contrary, can be put in raw. In baking, especially puff pastry and souffles, the glass front is of very great help to the cook, for it is well known that opening the door of an oven is detrimental to fine pastry in process of baking. In fact, the mere slamming of an oven door is often sufficient to make puff paste drop flat and lose its lightness on the spot, so that nothing will make it rise again. Baked custards and milk puddings will require a more moderate oven than pastry, and a longer time in baking, for if they are baked too quickly the milk will turn watery in the dish, while the top will burn. A well-baked custard should present a creamy, golden appearance, cut firm, and leave the dish dry. For meringues, and such deli- cate things, the oven must be still cooler, so as not to make them turn colour. Macaroons only want the oven just hot,

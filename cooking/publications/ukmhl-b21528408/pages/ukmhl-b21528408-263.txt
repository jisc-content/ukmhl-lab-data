Breakfasts—Ma y. 249 have been dipped in the butter; they are then grilled and finished as above. Potted Ham. Pick all the meat left on a ham which no longer pre- sents good enough an appearance to be sent to the table or the sideboard; carefully remove all skin and gristle, and separate the fat from the lean. Weigh the lean, and sup- posing a pound of it is obtained, add to it a quarter of a pound of fat. If there is not enough fat, add a little butter to make up the requisite quantity. Pass the lean and fat together through a mincing-machine, then pound them thoroughly in a mortar, adding gradually a salt-spoonful of cayenne pepper and a tea-spoonful of powdered mace. When quite smooth, put it in small china jars, press it well down, and .cover it with an eighth of an inch of clarified butter. To Clarify Butter.—Dissolve it in a small saucepan over the gas turned three-quarter full on, and as it boils up, remove the scum which rises; when this is all taken off, and the butter looks clear, turn out the gas, let the butter stand for a’minute or two, and pour it off carefully so as not to disturb the sediment which may fall at the bottom. Tongue can be potted in the same manner as ham. Chicken, turkey, and game, can be treated similarly, but ham, tongue, or bacon, must be added to them. The proportions are—for ope pound, half a pound of fowl or game, a quarter of a pound of lean cooked ham, bacon, or tongue, a quarter of a pound of fat or butter. Work and season as above, adding a very little salt if necessary. Plovers’ Eggs. Put six fresh plovers’ eggs in boiling water, and boil them for eight minutes, take them out, and put them in cold water. When quite cold, arrange them neatly in a little moss basket, and serve.

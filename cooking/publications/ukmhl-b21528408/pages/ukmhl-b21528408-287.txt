They can be served either plain or garnished with cream, like meringues. For this, spread a spoonful of whipped and flavoured cream (see page 73) on the underside of one biscuit and press another against it. These are very pretty for dessert or five oâ€™clock tea. Macaroons. Put eight ounces of sweet almonds, to which six or eight bitter ones have been added, in a saucepan of boiling water, boil them for five minutes, drain them ; put them in a rough clean cloth and rub to detach the skins. Pick out the almonds, quite clean and free from skins, wipe them, put them in a mortar. Whisk two whites of eggs in a basin with a pinch of salt; they need not be stiff, but only well broken and frothy. Sift ten ounces of sugar through a fine sieve; have this and the whites of eggs ready. Pound the almonds, gradually adding a little white of egg, a little sugar, and so on until all is reduced to a paste; this paste must be soft, but not enough to spread, when dropped on the slab from a spoon. Flavour it while working with a little essence of vanilla, orange-flower water, or rind of lemon finely grated. Put the paste in a forcing-bag with plain pipe end, squeeze it out on a baking-sheet covered with a piece of white paper, making rounds two inches wide and rather more than a quarter of an inch thick. Dust with icing sugar, and having lighted the gas in the oven of the kitchener for five minutes previously, put in the macaroons and bake for ten or twelve minutes-. As soon as they are a light golden brown, take them out, lay them on the table, face downwards, and brush the paper with a little water at the back of each to detach them. Put them on a pastry- rack to cool until quite dry and crisp. S

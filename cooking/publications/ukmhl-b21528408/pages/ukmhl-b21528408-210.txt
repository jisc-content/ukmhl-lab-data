Melt an ounce of butter in a saucepan over the gas turned three- quarter full on, add the shallot and a wine-glassful of French vinegar, stir until the butter looks quite clear. Add an ounce of flour, and stir again until it has acquired a bright brown colour, put in half a pint of stock and a good pinch of pepper, bring up to boiling-point, skim, reduce the gas to half full on, and simmer for twenty minutes, add a table- spoonful of chopped-up gherkin and a table-spoonful of chopped-up parsley, which has been washed like the shallot, turn the gas full on again. Boil up and skim ; taste to ascertain if any salt is required, and serve. If salt was put in when the stock was made, there will probably be no need to put any in the sauce. This sauce is good with almost any kind of cold meat warmed up. It is also useful with grilled meat and fowl. Boiled Marrow-bones.

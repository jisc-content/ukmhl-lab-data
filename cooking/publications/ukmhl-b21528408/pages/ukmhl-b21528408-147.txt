Put three-quarters of a pint of good brown sauce in the saucepan, with two table-spoonfuls of sherry or Madeira, a little cayenne pepper, and a salt-spoonful of sugar. Let it boil until reduced to half a pint, skimming well while it boils. Strain it, add the rind, set the saucepan in the bain marie for ten minutes, or reduce the gas to half full on to keep the sauce hot without boiling. Squeeze and strain the juice of the orange, and just before serving, add this juice to the sauce. Pine-Apple Cream. Cut half a pound of preserved pine-apple in small pieces. Put half this quantity, with a table-spoonful of castor sugar and the liquor from the pine-apple, in a small saucepan, add a tea-spoonful of lemon-juice. Set this over the gas turned three-quarter full on, and boil for ten minutes. Put an ounce of the best French gelatine in a stewpan, with a wine-glassful of water, and set it over the gas turned half full on to dissolve. Whip a pint of cream until quite stiff with a table-spoonful of castor sugar. In hot weather it will be best to stand the basin on ice. Mix in the fresh pieces of pine-apple, and also those which have been stewed in syrup, taking care that these and their syrup are nearly cold. Strain in the gelatine. Mix all these ingre- dients. Have ready a mould ornamented with red jelly, or some preserved fruit held in place with a little jelly (see page 121). This should be done beforehand, and kept ready in a cold place so that the jelly is quite set. Pour the cream in and stir it gently for a few minutes so as to prevent the pieces of pine-apple from setting all in one place. Leave the cream in a cold room, or on ice until wanted. Dip the mould quickly in hot water, wipe all moisture, and turn out on a dish.

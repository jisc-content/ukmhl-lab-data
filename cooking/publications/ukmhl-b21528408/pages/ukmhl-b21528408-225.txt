L UNCHEONS—A UG US T. 2 I I vinegar, and a dessert-spoonful of tarragon or chili vinegar, add four table-spoonfuls of Lucca oil, beat lightly with a fork, and when quite smooth pour it on the salad, mix well, and keep it in a cool place until wanted. Crystallized Currants. Take equal parts of fine red currants and white currants in bunches, say one pound of each, see that they are quite free from grit and remove any that are damaged. Beat two whites of eggs with half a pint of cold water in a basin, dip the bunches one by one in this, and put them on a sieve to drain for a few minutes. Roll them in fine sifted sugar. Dry them on a large sheet of paper or a sieve, so that they do not touch each other. The sugar crystallizes round the currants and looks very pretty. When quite dry, pile them up in four parts on a dish, alternating the colours. AUGUST. Fried Roach and Dace. Chicken Fricassee. Grilled Tomatoes. Greengages with Cream. Friture de Riviere. Fricassee de Poulet. Tomates Grillees. Reines Claude a la Creme. Fried Roach and Dace. Cleanse and wash carefully some freshly-caught roach and dace, dry them, flour them lightly, cover them with egg and bread-crumbs, and fry as directed for smelt and gudgeon. (See page no.) Serve with brown bread-and- butter and quartered lemons. These fish taken in running water are a great deal better than their reputation, and little deserve the contemptuous name of “ coarse fish ” applied to them without distinction. Crisply fried, as soon as practicable after they are caught, they form a very dainty and appetizing dish. Loach, bleak, and other small river fish, can be treated in the same manner.

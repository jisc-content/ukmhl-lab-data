Farce for Quails.—Cut in small pieces one pound of raw lean veal, half pound of calf’s liver, and half a pound of fat bacon. Put these in a stewpan with two ounces of butter, an onion chopped up small, a little parsley and thyme, two bay leaves, a little pepper and salt. Turn on the gas and fry these things for five or six minutes, shaking them well together. Turn them out into a mortar and pound them while hot, then rub them through a wire sieve. Bind this mixture with the yolk of two raw eggs and add a dozen button mushrooms, well washed, peeled, and chopped up finely, two or three truffles if possible, also chopped up finely. When well mixed and smooth the farce is ready, and the quails can be filled with it by means of a forcing-bag and plain pipe. Should the farce be too stiff to be worked easily, a little, very little, aspic jelly can be added to it.

Put this over the gas turned nearly full on, and whisk briskly until it boils ; then let it boil, without stirring it any more, for five minutes. Reduce

This bird is prepared and- roasted like the woodcock (see page 117), but requires a shorter time in cooking ; ten minutes will be sufficient for snipe, and they want plentiful basting lest they should get dry. Eaten rather underdone and moist they are a very dainty morsel; overdone and dry they are not worth eating. Serve them on toast garnished with watercress, or with savoury toast, like plovers (see page 178). Apple Charlotte. Pare, core, and slice three pounds of fine cooking apples. Put them in a stewpan with two ounces of sugar, an ounce of butter, and the yellow rind of a lemon finely chopped up. Set the pan over the gas turned half-full on, and stew the apples until tender; they take more or less according to their kind. When they are reduced to a pulp, rub them through a sieve. Line a straight mould with bread free from crust; for this, cut eight wedge-shaped pieces for the bottom of the mould, and enough straight pieces an inch and a half broad to stand all round the mould. Dissolve two ounces of butter; dip the wedge-shaped pieces in it, and arrange them at the bottom to cover it. Dip the straight pieces, and put them round the mould, each overlapping the other a little. Pour the apple puree in this. Put a round of bread, also dipped in buttdr, on the top. Light the gas in the oven for ten minutes; put in the mould, cover it with a plate, and bake for three-quarters of an hour with the gas three- quarter full on. Just before turning it out, warm half a pound of apricot marmalade in a small saucepan. Turn out the charlotte carefully on a hot dish, and glaze with the marmalade. Serve at once.

See that they are in the middle of the spit; drive the skewers in the two end birds, and with a piece of string fasten the two middle ones to them so that they will not slip when turning. The roaster having been heated for ten minutes, leave the gas full on for five minutes after the partridges are put in, turn it to half full on [ox fifteen minutes, and full on again for six or seven minutes to brown the birds. They want basting plentifully with good beef dripping, especially if they are neither barded nor larded. To bard them, cut a thin piece of fat bacon (in French, barde) about three and a half inches long and two and a half broad, make a few slits in it, and tie it on the breast of the bird (see Fig. 24). The bacon should be removed when the gas is turned on full for browning. If the birds are to be larded, cut the thin fat bacon into

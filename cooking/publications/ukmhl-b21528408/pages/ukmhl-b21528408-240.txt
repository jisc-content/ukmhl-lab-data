226 The Art of Cooking by Gas. weighing about two pounds. Put in a basin two quarts of cold water, a tea-spoonful of salt, and a wine-glassful of vinegar. Scrape the black skin off the salsifis, cut them in three-inch lengths, .and throw them in the water to keep them white. Leave them in for an hour. Chop finely three ounces of beef suet, put it in a stewpan over the gas turned three-quarter full on, and melt it without discolouring ; add two quarts of water, two table-spoonfuls of vinegar, and a salt-spoonful of salt. Stir, and mix well together. Drain the salsifis and wipe them, put them in the stewpan. Cover them with the lid, put a little on one side so as to leave a small space of the pan uncovered, turn the gas to half full on. Simmer for three-quarters of an hour. Drain them well, and wipe them lightly in a cloth. Dip them in frying- batter (see page 50), and fry in hot fat. When they are all fried and drained on a hot cloth, pile them up on a dish, sprinkle a little fine salt over them, and put a bunch of fried parsley at the top. These are also very good for garnishing fish when smelt are not obtainable for frying. Stewed Pears with Pistachio Cream. If the pears are wanted white they should be stewed in an enamelled stewpan ; but they are more generally served coloured red, and can be then done in a block tin or tinned saucepan. Put a pint and a half of water in the pan with twelve ounces of loaf sugar, a little piece of cinnamon, and a few drops of carmine. Turn the gas three-quarter full on, and boil up the syrup, skim it. Pare thinly six sound pears, small enough not to have to be divided in halves, cut off the stalks and put the pears in the saucepan. There should be only just room to lift the pears conveniently in and out, and 'they should be covered with the syrup. Reduce the gas to half full on, and simmer until they are tender. No actual time can be given as pears vary according to their kind.

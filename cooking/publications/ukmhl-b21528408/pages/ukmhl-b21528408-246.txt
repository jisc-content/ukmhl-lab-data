232 The Art of Cooking by Gas. Pound the parings of the pine-apple with the same quantity of apricot marmalade.

The cake can be replaced by pieces of bread cut out of a tin loaf, fried a golden brown, drained thoroughly,, and iced in the same manner as above. BREAKFASTS. For the preparation of the breakfasts given here, a griller, an oven, and four rings will be necessary. A kitchener of the Charing Cross type will best fulfil these conditions. For breakfasts, however, consisting of only one dish of grilled meat or fish, with eggs or omelets and toast, a smaller apparatus, such as the little Connaught Kitchener, and the two grillers will be amply sufficient. Tea. To make a quart of tea take a three-pint teapot, fill it with boiling water, and let it stand a few minutes to get thoroughly hot. Pour out the water and put in nine heaped tea-spoonfuls of tea (that is, about an ounce and a half), pour in a quart of boiling water, cover the teapot for three or four minutes-, and the tea is ready. The water used in making tea must not be kept boiling for any length of time, but the kettle having been filled with cold water and brought up to boiling-point over the gas turned full on, the water must be used as soon as it is boiling.

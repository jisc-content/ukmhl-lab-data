123 HOME DINNERS. We now come to a class of dinners more specially de- signed for home use, and in the working out of which a Charing Cross kitchener, such as described on page io, and a Parisienne roaster (see page 7), will do all that is required. These dinners are intended for a number of six to twelve persons, the initial quantities given for six, and easily extended in the same proportions to suit ten, twelve, or even fifteen guests. The quantities given will perhaps strike one as somewhat large in proportion to those given in the foregoing recipes for twenty-four guests ; but it must be borne in mind that the dishes being fewer a larger quantity of each will be necessary for each person. Thus a man who in the course of the Christmas dinner has partaken of soup, fish, and entrees, and has “a lively sense of future flavours,” will only want a slice, two or three ounces at the most, of roast beef. But the same man will eat probably half a pound of meat or more if he makes his entire dinner “off” the joint, potatoes and vegetables being almost the sole accompaniment. By grouping round this joint such dishes as give variety to the daily pabulum, and taking note of the average quantity required by a family gifted with excellent appetites, a result has been arrived at which will be found a very reliable guide in ordering quantities for any given number.

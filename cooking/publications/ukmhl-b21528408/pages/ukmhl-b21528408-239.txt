L UNCHEONS—NO VEMBER. 225 dozen small onions prepared as for stewed rabbit (see page 217), and simmer until the onions are done (about twenty minutes more). In the meantime peel twenty-four button mushrooms and throw them in a pint of cold water, with a dessert-spoonful of French vinegar added to it. When they are all peeled, drain them, put them in boiling water with a pinch of salt, and boil them for five minutes, drain them again, add them to the sauce, simmer for five minutes longer. Take out the pieces of hare, pile them up in good order on a very hot dish, put the onions and mushrooms round with a spoon, and keep hot in the oven. Add the blood to the sauce, turn the gas full on, boil up, and skim, pour the sauce over the hare through a strainer, garnish with fried croutons, and serve. I have ventured to give this French version of a jugged hare instead of the usual recipe, as it seems to me that, done in this way, the hare keeps its flavour better than when it is stewed for long hours. I hardly like to say a word against such an old and favourite dish, but there is no disguising the fact that the best part of the jugged hare is the gravy, which is very rich and tasty, especially when made with port wine. I think, however, that it is quite possible to obtain, by the method I have given, an excellent gravy without reducing the meat to a tasteless pulp. When it is considered that the process to which jugged hare is usually submitted is exactly that followed in stewing down meat for stock and gravy, that is, simmering it for three, four, or five hours (authorities differ), it becomes obvious that, be the gravy ever so good, the meat itself cannot retain much flavour and nourishment. There is a point where perfection is reached, to go beyond that point is to spoil the meat for, as French cooks graphically say, it “ kills ” the flavour of it. Fried Salsifis or Scorzoneras.

ii4 The Art of Cooking by Gas. page 34 ; but for the present number of guests fifteen pounds will be a better size, as it must be borne in mind that there is a good deal of bone and fat in a piece of sirloin, and that if the joint is only just large enough, some of the cuts from it will not look well. The time for cooking this will be as follows:—Ten minutes with the gas full on to heat the roaster, ten minutes after the meat has been put in with the gas still full on, to close the pores of the meat. Then turn the gas down to barely half full on for one hour and a half (ninety minutes), so that the heat penetrates very gradually, the joint being thick. Turn the gas up to three-quarter full on for thirty minutes, and finish with it full on for twenty minutes more. This makes up two hours and a half, and the meat will be found then well done and full of juice. Baste liberally, especially at the beginning, with good beef dripping. Lift the joint on to a very hot dish, and garnish with horseradish finely shredded. Remove the fat from the gravy in the dripping pan, and pour in half a pint of boiling beef gravy (see page 57), add a pinch of salt, mix thoroughly, and pour the gravy in the well of the dish. When the meat is carved, the gravy from it will run into this, making up a quantity amply sufficient for all the guests. Horseradish Sauce.—Soak, and scrape the horseradish very finely. Mix two raw yolks of eggs with a table-spoonful of French vinegar, add a pinch of salt, a little white pepper, and four table-spoonfuls of scraped horseradish. Then mix in gradually a pint of whipped cream. Put the sauce in a saucepan of the bain-marie and warm, but do not boil it. Tliis sauce is also very good served cold with cold beef. Boiled Potatoes. Take six pounds of potatoes, choosing them as nearly as possible of equal size. Wash and scrub them thoroughly. Put them in a saucepan with enough cold water to cover them. Set them over the gas turned three-quarter full on

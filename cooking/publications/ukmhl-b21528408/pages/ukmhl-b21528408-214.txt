Make a paste as for choux h. la creme (see page 79), put it in a forcing-bag with plain pipe end, squeeze it out on a baking-tin in lengths of four inches, and rather more than an inch wide. Beat up an egg and brush the eclairs over with it. The oven having been heated for ten minutes, put in the eclairs, reduce the gas to three-quarter full on, and bake for twenty-five to thirty minutes. They must look a light brown. Put them on a pastry-rack, or a coarse sieve, to get cold.

Ice with coffee icing, and when quite dry, pile up on a dish covered with a lace paper. Coffee Icing.—Mix half a pound of icing sugar with two table-spoonfuls of strong coffee, stir well together, warm through, and use. The best way to proceed is to have the icing in the saucepan by the side of the eclairs, and holding each one over the pan pour the icing over it with a spoon, so that it spreads evenly and quickly, returning them at once to the rack which is standing on a dish.

Dinners for the Four Seasonsâ€”Christmas. 107 water at least once in every twelve hours. Keep the pan in a warm place. At night it can be set on one of the ring burners turned down to a very low flame. This is quite safe, as the gas cannot go out of its own accord, and dur- ing the last twelve hours the water should be kept rather warmer. Prepare the stock in the following manner Take three pounds of gravy beef, three pounds of knuckle of veal, half a pound raw ham quite free from fat. Put these in four quarts of cold water with a dessert-spoonful of salt over the gas turned half full on, and skim carefully until boiling-point is reached. Put in three carrots, one turnip, a large head of celery, three onions, with three cloves stuck in each onion, a handful of parsley well picked and washed, one table-spoonful each of marjoram and basil, a dessert-spoonful of thyme, two bay-leaves, a dessert- spoonful of salt, and thirty peppercorns. Skim again as long as any scum rises, and simmer gently for four hours. Strain this and put it away to cool. In this liquor well freed from fat, put the turtle and simmer very gently for twelve hours. It is well to reserve a pint of the liquor, and pour this in from time to time as the stock reduces, skimming again if required. The turtle being done, strain off the stock and clarify it (see page 65). Mix three dessert-spoonfuls of the best arrowroot with a quarter of a pint of sherry and a very little cayenne pepper, and, when smooth, pour it through a strainer into the soup, set it over the gas turned three-quarter full on, and stir until the soup boils again. Cut the turtle in pieces about an inch and a half square. Warm these for five minutes in the soup, put them in the hot soup tureen, pour the soup over them, and just before serving, squeeze in through a strainer a dessert-spoonful of lemon-juice. Hand round cayenne pepper, and lemons cut in quarters. This soup is lengthy to make with an ordinary kitchener,

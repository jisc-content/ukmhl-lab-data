Cut half a dozen croutons to the shape of cocks’ combs, ready for frying; heat the fat on the frying-burner. Prepare also for frying half a dozen smelt. (See “Fried Smelt,” page 110.) Melt an ounce of butter in a stewpan, and mix smoothly with it an ounce of flour; add to it half a pint of good fish stock, and, the sole being done, take the dish out of the oven and pour the liquor from it into the sauce, being care- ful not to disturb the sole. Put the fish in the oven, with the gas only half full on, to keep warm. Boil up the sauce, and skim it. Mix the yolk of an egg in a basin with a tea- spoonful of lemon-juice, add this to the sauce, gradually stirring to make it smooth ; reduce the gas to half full on, and put in the mussels and mushrooms. Just warm them through; taste the sauce in case it wants a little more salt or pepper. Arrange the mussels and mushrooms round the sole, and pour the sauce over through a strainer.

Oysters can be used along with the mussels, or in place of them; to prepare them, beard them, put them in a small strainer or wire-basket, plunge them in boiling water just for a minute, drain, and add them to the sauce.

The Art of Cooking by Gas. 12 be infinitely superior in point of appearance and taste to anything baked in a close oven. Note.â€”It is not advisable to bake a pie at the same time as meat is being roasted, because the steam and fatty vapours from the meat are detrimental to the pastry, and make it heavy. The best way of proceeding when joint and pie are required for the same meal is to bake the pie first, then roast the joint. When the joint is sent up to the table, clear out the dripping pan, and wipe the grease that may have fallen on the grids, then put in the pie, and in a few minutes it will be quite hot and crisp. The door of the kitchener can be fitted with a thick plate of glass to enable the cook to see inside the roasting or baking chamber without opening the door. This is very useful, and perfectly safe. On the top of the roasting and baking chamber are placed the griller and boiling burners. The burners of the griller are arranged in two lines placed above the grid instead of under. The advantage of this is obvious. The gravy and fat from the meat drop into the pan and cannot burn ; the unpleasant smell of burnt fat and its deterioration are thus entirely avoided. This is a great consideration, for the smell of burnt fat, especially the mutton fat from chops, is positively nauseating, and once it begins to spread it soon pervades the whole house. The griller has two grids fitting in the same pan ; one for steaks, cutlets, etc., the other for fish. The work of the griller being performed by radiant heat, bread placed in it can be as quickly and as well toasted as it would be in front of a clear red fire. There are four or five rings of burners, according to the size of the hot-plate. These burners are set deeply enough to prevent the flames from touching the underpart of the cooking utensils even when turned full on. The hot-plate of Fig. 4 has on the left side a large burner which is specially designed to give a sharp radiant heat for frying

Home Dinners—December. 183 Welsh Rarebit. Cut two slices of bread half an inch thick, and toast them on both sides in the griller. Butter on both sides. Dissolve one ounce of butter in a small stewpan over the gas turned three-quarter full on. Cut half a pound of good Cheddar cheese in very thin slices, and stir it in until it is all melted. Add two table-spoonfuls of cream, a salt-spoon- ful of made mustard, and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper. Lay the toast on a very hot dish (a hot-water dish is the best); divide it in small square pieces, and pour the mixture over it. Turn the gas full on in the griller, and put the dish in the place of the pan and grid for a minute or two. Serve at once with very hot plates, for, unless this dish is eaten “ piping ” hot, it is worthless. DECEMBER. Lentil Soup. Fried Whiting. Irish Stew. Brussels Sprouts. Roast Teal. Vanilla Souffld.

Wash and pick half a pint of split lentils. Put them in a stewpan with a pinch of salt and enough cold water to cover them. Set this over the gas, turned three-quarter full on, and let it come up to boiling-point; then reduce the gas to half full on and simmer for two hours. In the meantime, prepare a quart of stock, by putting it, free from fat, in a stewpan with an onion stuck with two cloves, a carrot, a stick of celery, and a bunch of herbs. When the lentils are soft, strain them, and rub them through a wire sieve into a basin, moistening them with the stock. Pick out the cloves and the bunch of herbs; rub the carrot and the onion through with the lentils. Return the puree to the stewpan,

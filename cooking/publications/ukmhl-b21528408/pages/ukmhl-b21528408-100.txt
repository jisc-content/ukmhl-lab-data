86 The Art of Cooking by Gas. brown bread should be of the best and freshest kind, the whitebait having the property of bringing out its flavour, so that inferior butter would be very unpleasantly notice- able. Devilled whitebait is made by sprinkling the whitebait with black or red pepper after it has been fried once and drained, and before plunging it into fat for the second time. Three quarts would not be sufficient for two courses of whitebait; and when two such courses are required, allow for the second course half the quantity needed for the first. This will generally be found ample, unless whitebait is the only fish served, in which case the quantity must be in- creased. Beef fat only should be used for frying whitebait, being for that purpose greatly superior to anything else. (See page 45, “ Directions for Clarifying Fat for Frying.”) Plovers’ Eggs in Aspic. Boil twenty-four plovers’ eggs for ten minutes, by putting them in boiling water over the gas turned three-quarter full on. When done, put them in cold water to set. Prepare two quarts of aspic jelly according to the directions given on page 70. Line some small plain dariole moulds by pouring a little jelly in them and turning them about on broken ice until a thin layer of jelly covers all the inside of the mould. Cut some very thin-strips of cooked beetroot and pickled gherkins, and stamp some stars, crescents, etc., with a vegetable cutter. Arrange some of these at the bottom of each mould—say a star of beetroot surrounded by smaller stars of gherkin, or a star and a crescent, etc.— picking up the little shapes with the point of a trussing needle. Put a little jelly on these, and let it set. Arrange the strips of beetroot in a slanting position round the moulds, fixing them with a little jelly. When set, arrange the strips

Icing for Choux.â€”Put in a slewpan one pound of icing sugar, four table-spoonfuls of warm water, and flavour with a table-spoonful of maraschino, kirsch, or noyau. Stir this over the gas turned low, so as just to warm it, and use at once. If vanilla is not used for flavouring the cream, orange- flower water can be substituted, and the icing flavoured with the same. The icing can be coloured a delicate pink, or green, by adding to it, before using, a few drops of carmine or sap green. Gelee a la Russe. To make two quarts of jelly, peel eight lemons very thinly, taking only the yellow rind off. Squeeze and strain the juice. Melt a pound of loaf sugar in two quarts of water over the gas turned full on, add the lemon-juice and rind, a small piece of cinnamon, six cloves, and three ounces of the best French gelatine. Whisk together until it boils up, turn the gas out, and let the jelly rest for half an hour. Pour a quart of boiling water through a jelly bag, remove the basin and replace it by another. Pour the jelly in the bag and see if it comes through quite clear. If not, take it up and pour it through again until quite limpid. Add half a pint of liquor (kirsch is the best to use for this purpose, being colourless) and a wine-glassful of brandy. This jelly can be all one colour, or can be divided in two, or even three, differently-coloured layers, thus : one part coloured with a very little carmine, one with sap green, and the third left colourless. Have ready some broken ice in a large pan. Put one-third of the jelly, coloured as directed above, in a basin. Stand the basin on the ice, and whip briskly until quite firm and frothy. Take three moulds, and pour in each enough jelly to fill it about one-third. Put the moulds on

Put the pie on a hot dish, garnish with parsley, prawns, and sliced lemon, and serve at once. This pie is also excellent cold. If served cold it must be made at least twelve hours before it is eaten. To fill the Pie.—Skin and bone two or three whiting so that they yield about a pound of flesh. Pound this with half a pound of butter and half a pound of panade {see page 195). Add a pinch of pepper, a salt-spoonful of salt, and a salt-spoonful of grated nutmeg. Beat two yolks of eggs with a quarter of a pint of fish stock {see below), add these to the farce and mix well. Next prepare two pounds of salmon, by removing the skin and bone, and divide the flesh in slices half an inch thick and about two inches long. Pepper and salt these on both sides. Melt two ounces of butter in a saute pan over the gas, turned three-quarter full on, put in the pieces of salmon and cook them for five minutes, turning them over to do them evenly. Drain them and let them cool. Spread a layer of farce at the bottom of the pie, and arrange over it a layer of sliced salmon ; put on another layer of farce and another of salmon, and so on to the top, finishing with a layer of farce. (A couple of truffles are a great improvement, and should be put in thin slices on each layer of salmon.) Cover the pie as directed above, and bake. Make a good fish stock as directed on page 56, using in the present instance the heads and bones of the whitings, the bones of the salmon, and also the bones of the soles and shells of the lobster left from the previous dish. Allow a quart of water to simmer these in. This quantity will yield a pint and a half of good stock, which having been well skimmed and strained, will be divided as follows :— 1. For the farce.—Melt one ounce of butter over the gas

L UNCHEONSâ€”/UNE. 207 Fresli Fruit Tartlets. Prepare a puff paste (see page no), and having given it six turns, roll it out to the thickness of a penny piece. Line a dozen buttered patty-pans with it, and prick a few holes in the middle of each to prevent the pastry from puffing up. Light the gas in the oven of the kitchener for fifteen minutes before the tartlets are ready to put in, and when they are in, reduce the gas a little. Bake for twenty minutes. In the meantime, pick free from stalks enough strawberries to allow five or six to each tartlet according to their size. They should be ripe, but quite firm and unbroken, and as even in size as practicable. Put them in a basin and sprinkle a little fine sifted sugar over them. Make a syrup by dissolving eight ounces of loaf sugar in a pint of water. Boil this over the gas turned three-quarter full on until it is reduced to half a pint. Skim it, add a little carmine to colour the syrup a deep clear red. Pour the syrup gently through a strainer over the strawberries and let them stand for a few minutes. The tartlets being done, take them out and put them on a pastry-rack. Pick the strawberries out one by one, and arrange them round the tartlets, five or six in each, leaving the centre free. Put a spoonful of syrup in each tartlet. Whip stiffly a quarter of a pint of cream, with a dessert-spoonful of castor sugar, and with a forcing-bag and rose pipe, squeeze out a little in the middle of each tartlet. Serve at once. These tartlets can also be served cold, in which case it is best to allow them to cool before the fruit and syrup, also cold, are put in. The cream can be omitted and replaced by a strawberry. Instead of strawberries, raspberries, cur- rants, or cherries, can be used, the last named having been carefully stoned.

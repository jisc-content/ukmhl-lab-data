Melt two ounces of butter in a small saucepan over the gas turned only half full on, and mix with it two ounces of fine sifted flour very smoothly; add gradually half a pint of milk, stirring until smooth. Turn the gas to three-quarter full on, and bring the mixture to boiling point, or it will taste pasty. When it leaves the sides of the saucepan easily • it is done. Turn it out into a basin to cool. Break four eggs, separating the yolks from the whites, and grate four ounces of Parmesan cheese ; also prepare two'dozen little paper cases by oiling them outside and drying them in the warm oven until they are quite stiff. When the mixture is cold stir into it the four yolks of eggs, one at a time, add the cheese gradually, mix well; whisk the whites of egg till very stiff, and stir them lightly in. Put the mixture in a forcing- bag with plain pipe end, and half fill the little cases ; put them on a baking sheet in the oven of the kitchener, which has been lighted for ten minutes, and bake for twelve to fifteen minutes. Send to the table at once. This mixture can be baked also in one large mould for a luncheon dish, but it would want then thirty to thirty-five minutes’ baking, the top being covered with a piece of buttered paper when half done to prevent its browning too rapidly.

Home Dinners—May. *5* Rhubarb Tart. Peel the rhubarb and cut in two-inch lengths. Put it in the pie-dish, adding twelve ounces of sugar to each pound of rhubarb, and a little yellow rind of lemon grated. Pile up the rhubarb dome-shape in the middle. Cover with short crust (see below). Light the gas in the oven for ten minutes, put the tart in on an asbestos baking sheet, and bake it for twenty to thirty minutes, according to size. A pie contained in a dish seven by five and a half inches, and two and a half inches deep, will take twenty minutes. A pie contained in dish nine by seven inches, and three inches deep, will take thirty minutes.

Cut a strip of this pastry, and line the edge of the dish with it. Wet it with a little cold water. Roll out the rest of the paste and cover the dish with it. Press the edges together. Cut the paste smoothly round, cutting rather under the edge of the dish, as the pastry shrinks in baking. Ornament the edge with a pastry-cutter, or simply with a knife. Baked Custard. Put a pint of new milk with an inch of vanilla pod in an enamelled saucepan. Set it over the gas turned half full on, and let it infuse for twenty minutes. Strain it and let it cool. Break three eggs in a basin, with a tiny pinch of salt, and a table-spoonful of castor sugar. Beat the eggs well, and add gradually the flavoured milk, which is only just tepid. Line and ornament the edge of a dish with short crust (.sw previous recipe). Pour in the custard through

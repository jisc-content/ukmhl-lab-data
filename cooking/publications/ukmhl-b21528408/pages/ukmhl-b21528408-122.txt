io8 The Art or Cooking by Gas. but the use of a thoroughly reliable gas kitchener enables the cook to quicken and simplify the process considerably. For instance, the turtle having to soak for three days and nights, during which the water must be kept lukewarm, and requiring warmer water during the last twelve hours, it is obvious that it could be boiled for a very short time only on the same day. It must be then turned out in a pan, and the boiling resumed on the following day. Then comes the clarifying and finishing of the soup, all of which could not be crowded into one day. But by the use of gas the work can be done as follows :â€” Let the turtle be soaked as directed, and on the evening of the third day leave it in the pan of warm water, just re- newed, over the gas turned down low, or in the oven with only the flash lights on. The water will keep warm, and the turtle will be ready for cooking by the next morning, which should be that of the day before it is wanted, the stock for it having been made over-night and freed from fat. Thus it will be easy to give the turtle twelve hours cooking right off, say from eight in the morning to eight in the evening. Remove the soup from the gas, strain it, and put it away to cool until the morning of the dinner, the turtle having been washed with a little warm water to remove any herbs that might cling to it. In the morning, clarify the soup, and just before wanted, finish as directed, the pieces of turtle being only put in when the soup is boiling up for the last time. The vegetables, herbs, etc., used for flavouring the soup, the meat used in making the stock as well as that used in clarifying the soup, go to the stock-pot and will make very good secondary stock.

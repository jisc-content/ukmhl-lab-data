IO The Art of Cooking by Gas. Joints cooked in ovens or before a fire often lose as much as thirty-five per cent.; the loss of weight in joints cooked in the Parisienne roaster is only, on the average, ten to twelve per cent, with thoroughly done meat. The front of the lid of the roaster is fitted with two panes of glass, which enable the cook to see the joint with- out opening the roaster, thus avoiding loss of heat. This glass is sufficiently thick, and as it is put in loosely to allow for expansion, it will last for years without cracking. The Parisienne roaster can also be used for baking bread or pastry if desired; for this purpose the spit is re- moved and a grid substituted, which rests on bearers at both ends of the roaster, allowing the heat to circulate freely to all parts of the apparatus. On this grid, supporting asbestos-lined baking sheets, loaf-tins, pie-dishes, etc., can be placed (see Fig. 3). Charing Cross Kitchener. The Charing Cross kitchener (Fig. 4) combines all that is necessary to meet the requirements of an average family, that is roasting, grilling, boiling, frying, and the baking of pastry, puddings, and bread. It is provided with a governor which, once adjusted, will maintain the flames so as to give constantly any required temperature. In point of roasting, it is similar to the Parisienne roaster, the meat being cooked by the radiant heat of rows of regulated luminous burners arranged round the sides and back of the roasting chamber, which is lined with white enamel. It is amply supplied with fresh air, constantly renewed. The meat, which is either hung from a hook or placed on a grid, is stationary instead of revolving, and must be turned once or twice during roasting to prevent the juices from settling in one part of it and leaving the others dry. A joint cooked in this kitchener will want rather more basting than that roasted in the Parisienne, but it will be

Dinners for the Four Seasonsâ€”April. 75 tea-spoon, a small bunch of fresh tarragon, and the same of chervil. Put the salad in the bowl, sprinkling some of the chopped herbs among the leaves, cut some slices of beet- root and stamp them into pretty shapes with a vegetable cutter ; add these to the salad. For the dressing : Put in a basin a dessert-spoonful of table salt, or celery salt, a tea- spoonful of white pepper, a dessert-spoonful of tarragon vinegar, and a table-spoonful of French vinegar. Stir until the salt is quite dissolved, then add a quarter of a pint of the best Lucca oil, stirring round quickly until the oil and vinegar are thoroughly mixed. (Two table-spoonfuls of cream, or the yolk of a new-laid egg can be added, but are not indispensable.) On no account must sugar be put in salad. When the dressing is quite smooth pour it on the salad and toss lightly so that the dressing is evenly dis- tributed, and serve. The proverb which says salad wants a madman to mix it, had better be considered as an exploded notion, for if the salad is too violently shaken it will be bruised and spoiled. Green Peas. Shell enough freshly-gathered peas to fill two quart measures. If not required for immediate use put them in a basin and cover them with a damp cloth; however, do not shell them any sooner than is absolutely necessary. Put in a saucepan three quarts of water and a dessert-spoonful of salt, a'whole onion, a lettuce, and a sprig of mint, tied together. Set the saucepan on the gas turned full on, and bring quickly to boiling-point. Put the peas in and cook them for twenty-five to thirty minutes. Remove the onion, lettuce, and mint, strain the peas (not throwing away the water in which they have boiled, as it will be useful for making green pea soup. Put the peas in a hot dish, with two ounces of fresh butter cut in small pieces and distributed all over, sprinkle a salt-spoonful of white pepper over all, and serve.

228 The Art of Cooking by Gas. Stewed Eels. Skin and cleanse an eel weighing about two pounds, re- move the second skin as directed for fried eels (j^page 171). Trim off the side fins with scissors, and cut the fish in three-inch lengths. Put it in a stewpan with a quart of boiling water to which a table-spoonful of vinegar has been added, and boil it for five minutes. Drain it well. Melt an ounce of butter in a stewpan, and mix smoothly with it an ounce of flour, cook it without discolouring for five minutes over the gas turned three-quarter full on, add half a pint of good fish stock, and a quarter of a pint of French white wine, a bunch of herbs, two dozen small mushrooms prepared as for chicken fricassee (see page 212), a salt-spoon- ful of salt, and one of pepper.

Pour the sauce over the eels, and serve with or without a garnish of fried croutons. The mushrooms can be omitted if not ob- tainable, and replaced by a tea-spoonful of ketchup; only this has the disadvantage of slightly colouring the sauce, which should be kept as white as practicable.

Prime steak can be cut from the rump, from the top of the ribs, or from the under-cut of the sirloin, and it is a

The pieces of cheese are best made by cutting a slice of cheese a quarter of an inch thick and, with a plain round vegetable cutter, stamping out pieces barely half an inch in diameter. Wet the edges of the profiterolles with a little water, and press them together over the cheese. Put them in the frying basket, and fry in hot fat. Take them out as soon as they have attained a golden brown colour. Drain them for a minute on a hot cloth, roll them qufckly in grated cheese, and serve. JULY. Crdcy Soup. Grilled Perch.

Scrape and wash some very red carrots, cut them in pieces, taking only the reddest part and rejecting the middle, which is paler. Put half a pound of the carrots in a stewpan with a quart of boiling water, boil them for ten minutes over the gas turned three-quarter’, full on. Strain them. Melt in the stewpan three ounces of fresh butter, add one small onion sliced, the white part of two leeks, and the carrots. Shake these well over the gas for five minutes, add three pints of good white stock, a tea-spoonful of salt, six pepper- corns, a bunch of herbs, and a piece of sugar the size of a small Spanish nut. Skim carefully until boiling-point is reached. Reduce the gas to half full on, and simmer for two hours. The carrots being quite tender, rub the soup through a wire-sieve into a basin. Put it again in the stewpan, which has been rinsed and wiped. Add a table- spoonful of crushed tapioca, and leave the soup to simmer

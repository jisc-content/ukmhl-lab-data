Breakfasts—December. 265 add a good pinch of pepper, boil up the vinegar over the gas, and pour it also over the fish. Serve at once. Game Pie. Prepare the pastry as for raised salmon pie (^page 137). Bone two pheasants. Mince a pound and a half of veal and a pound and a half of bacon, both free from skin, bone, and gristle, pound them well together with a tea-spoonful of salt, a tea-spoonful of freshly-ground pepper, a salt-spoonful of powdered thyme, one of grated nutmeg, four crushed cloves, and a powdered bay-leaf. Cut half a pound of tongue in small dice, slice finely two or three truffles and a dozen mushrooms prepared as directed on page 212. Blanch a quarter of a pound of pistachio nuts in boiling water for five minutes, and rub them in a cloth to remove the skins. The pie mould being lined with the pastry, take half a pound of the farce, spread it flat on the table, put on it some of the tongue, truffles, mushrooms, and pistachios, roll it up, and put it inside one of the pheasants; repeat this operation for the other. Make a layer of farce about half an inch thick at the bottom of the pie, spread some of the tongue, truffles, etc., on it. Put the two birds over this, side by side, and fill the spaces all round and between with some more farce, put the rest of the tongue, truffles, etc., over the birds, and cover with the rest of the farce, with which the parings of the truffles, finely minced, have been mixed. Cover as directed for salmon pie (see page 137), leaving a half-inch hole in the centre of the cover. Light the gas in the oven of the kitchener for fifteen minutes, put in the pie, reduce the gas to half full on, and bake for three hours. Take out the pie, and, when nearly cold, fill it with gravy through the hole at the top. Put it away in a cool place for at least twenty-four hours, before cutting it open. Gravy for Game Pie.—Break the carcases of the birds, and put them in a stewpan with the trimmings of the veal

5 Intro d uction. simmering, to the bright sharp heat needed for roasting, grilling, and frying; while for baking purposes all inter- mediate grades of heat can be produced at any moment by the mere turning of a handle. No hot-water apparatus is attached to the kitcheners. The usual system of putting the boiler at the back of the kitchen fire is a very defective one, and a fruitful source of inconvenience. The warmth and damp kept up by the steam and small leakages from the boiler encourage colonies of crickets and black beetles, and as these insects cannot live without water, cutting off their supply is the only effectual means of getting rid of them. When a good and constant supply of hot water is required, the use of a Boiling Stream Therma, or instantaneous water- heater, fixed over the scullery sink, or any other convenient position, is very much recommended. This will heat any quantity of water, from a jugful to a cisternful, and to any temperature, from lukewarm to boiling-point. (See page 30.) The principal kinds of apparatus in use at the present time for cooking by gas can be divided into two classes— viz., (1), those in which the gas-flames are of a luminous type (that is to say, are similar to the burners used for lighting rooms, but on a smaller scale); and (2), those fitted with burners generally called “atmospheric flames,” in which the gas is largely diluted with air before being burnt. The products of combustion from luminous flames are only steam and carbonic acid, and are no more hurtful than the products from good gas-burners used in lighting rooms, f be products of combustion from the atmospheric burners are steam, carbonic acid, and carbonic oxide—a most dangerous and poisonous gas, generally attended by a very noxious smell, although it is in itself inodorous, and requiring very thorough ventilation to carry it away safely. Moreover, the taste of the meat cooked in ovens heated by blue flames is not so good as that of meat roasted by the

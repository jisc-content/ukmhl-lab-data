It is then boiled for five minutes to loosen the skin and bones, and these being re- moved, the fish is broken in small flakes and put in a saucepan, Lucca oil being gradually added to it, and the fish worked with a wooden spoon until quite creamy-looking. Cream is then added in proportion of half a pint to a pound of fish, and lastly, a bead of garlic very finely chopped up, and a little cayenne pepper.

General Directions—Stocks. 55 The meat used in clarifying the best clear stock (see page 65) is also a valuable addition to the stock-pot. The bones and trimmings of cooked and uncooked joints, used of course quite sweet, the necks, legs, and livers of fowls, the scraped rind of ham and bacon, all go to enrich and flavour stock. The following are the principal stocks used in the making of soups and sauces :— Brown Stock.—Break small three pounds of bones, say from a roast joint of beef, and the legs, neck, and carcase of a fowl, and cut the liver in small pieces. Put these in the stock-pot with two quarts of cold water, a dozen peppercorns, and a salt-spoonful of salt. Set the pot on the gas turned half full on, and skim until the water boils. In the mean- time slice two onions, two carrots, and one turnip, add a little celery, a bunch of herbs (parsley, thyme, marjoram, and a bay-leaf), fry these in an ounce of butter or dripping until brown, add them to the stock. Put a spoonful or two of the stock in the saucepan to remove anything that may cling to the sides, and pour this back again into the stock- pot ; skim again until the stock is quite free from scum, then put on the lid and simmer gently for four hours. Strain, and set aside to cool. Remove the fat, pour out carefully to avoid disturbing the little sediment which is sure to settle at the bottom of the basin, and use. This stock will not be so clear as that made from fresh meat for clear soup, but for pure'es, etc., it is tasty and excellent. If, however, it is wanted clear, as for making aspic jelly, clarify like the con- somme (see page 65). White Stock is best made from the bones of veal, fowls, and rabbits, and is differently treated in this respect, that the vegetables must not be fried, so as not to colour the stock. To four pounds of veal bones, or three pounds of bones, and the carcase of a fowl or rabbit, add two onions (one of which has two cloves stuck in it), one

Home Dinnersâ€”July. 163 arrange them round a hot dish, each one slightly overlapping the other, and serve at once. Roast Quails. The birds being picked and trussed, draw them or not, according to taste. Warm one ounce of fresh butter. Brush the quails over with it. Put over the breast of each bird a fresh vine leaf that has been carefully washed and wiped dry. Over this put a thin slice of fat bacon about two inches square, and tie it on with string. Put the birds side by side on the spit in the hot roaster and roast them for twelve minutes, basting them well. Fry in hot fat six slices of bread free from crust, and cut two inches and a half long by one and a half inch broad. Drain these on a hot cloth. Put them on the hot dish and lay one bird on each. Garnish with watercress. Serve with good clear beef gravy in a sauce-boat and browned bread-crumbs on a small plate covered with a lace paper. Beignets Souffles. Make a paste like for choux a la creme (see page 79). Have a deep pan of fat hot and ready for frying over the gas turned three-quarter full on. Put the paste in a forcing- bag ; squeeze it through a plain pipe with large opening. As it comes out, cut it with a sharp knife in buttons the size of a small walnut, and let them drop in the hot fat. They will swell in cooking to the size of an egg. When they are a golden brown, lift them out and drain them; continue until all the paste has been fried in the same manner. Dish up very hot, with fine sifted sugar strewed over them and serve at once. They will be all the lighter if the paste, once made, is allowed to rest for a couple of hours before it is used. These beignets are also good cold.

274 The Art of Cooking by Gas. Pound Cake. Take a pound of fresh butter, a pound of fine flour, and a pound of loaf sugar. Put the flour on a baking-tin in the oven of the kitchener with only the flash-lights on to warm. Rub off the yellow rind of two lemons with the sugar, then pound it finely. Break eight eggs, whites and yolks separately in two basins. Beat the butter to a cream with a wooden spoon. Add the sugar to it and work smoothly. Beat lightly the yolks of eggs with a wine- glassful of brandy ; stir them in gradually with the butter until quite smooth. Whisk the whites of eggs till very stiff, sift the flour, add it and the whites of eggs, in alternate spoonfuls, to the other ingredients, until all is mixed in and smooth. Butter a cake-mould and line it with buttered paper, put in the mixture, and having lighted the gas in the oven of the kitchener for ten minutes previously, put in the cake and bake for an hour. The gas may want reducing a little if the cake appears to brown too quickly. Fruit can be added to this cake in the following pro- portions :â€”A quarter of a pound of candied peel cut in small dice, a quarter of a pound of dried cherries divided in halves, a quarter of a pound of sultanas, and a quarter of a pound of almonds blanched and chopped up. If these are put in the cake they should be mixed in the butter, etc., before the flour and whites of eggs are put in. The cake will take longer to bake. The gas should be reduced to half full on after the cake is put in, and an hour and a half allowed for baking. The above quantity will make a large cake, or can be diviclAl in smaller ones, in which case, of course, they would take less time to bake, according to their size. Sponge Cake. Butter a fancy cake-mould and strew it with sifted sugar. Keep it in readiness. Prepare a paste as for finger biscuits (see page 272), pour the mixture in the mould, only half-filling

Home Dinnersâ€”September. i 7 3 and add four ounces of Demerara sugar. Cover the fruit with the rest of the paste rolled out. Press the edges well to- gether; tie a clean pudding-cloth over the pudding with strong string ; then take the four corners of the pudding-cloth and tie them together. Plunge the pudding in a large sauce- pan of boiling water, set over the gas turned three-quarter full on, and boil for an hour and a half.

Put in a small saucepan half a pint of boiling water and a wine-glassful of French vinegar; add a pinch of salt, six peppercorns, and three bay-leaves. Set this over the gas turned full on, and as soon as it boils, skim and strain it over the roes. Cover the dish with a buttered paper, and

i5Â° The Art of Cooking by Gas. leg securely and start the turnspit. Keep the gas full for five minutes, basting well at starting, reduce the gas to barely half full, and cook at the rate of five pounds an hour. Thus a five-pound leg will take five minutes with the gas full on, forty-five minutes with it half full on, and ten minutes with the gas full on again at the last to brown. -Serve with its own gravy, free from fat, and added to a quarter of a pint of good mutton gravy. On no account must the gravy be poured over the meat. Send mint sauce (see page 74) up with the lamb. New Potatoes (Boiled). See page 76. Three pounds of potatoes will amply serve six persons. Asparagus. Ascertain that the asparagus is fresh. If it is, the heads will be straight and stiff, and the cut white and moist. If it has turned brown and limp, the asparagus is stale. Allow twelve heads to each person. Scrape and wash the asparagus, and trim it in equal lengths, tie it in small bundles, lay it in cold water for an hour to keep it white and firm. Put enough cold water in an oblong saucepan to cover the asparagus, add a salt-spoonful of salt to each quart of water. Put the pan on the gas turned three-quarter full on, and when boiling, skim it; put the asparagus in, and as soon as the water boils again, reduce the gas a little and simmer for twenty-five to thirty minutes, according to the size of the heads. Lift them out carefully, drain and untie them. Lay them in a hot dish on a piece of toast made in the griller, and serve with melted butter. Special pans are made for boiling asparagus, which have a strainer like a fish-kettle. These are very convenient, and allow the cook to lift and drain the asparagus without fear of breaking it.

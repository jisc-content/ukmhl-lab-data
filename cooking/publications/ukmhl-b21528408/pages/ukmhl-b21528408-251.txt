Breakfastsâ€”Januar y. 237 so as to keep light; cut each slice as it is buttered in four quarters. Pile up in a hot dish and serve at once. It is a mistake to pile up the slices before cutting through them, it makes the butter run down from one to another until it reaches the dish, where it looks oily and unsightly. It is as well to mention that the practice of holding a piece of toast over a basin of boiling water before buttering it, is most detrimental, and should never be resorted to; it makes the toast heavy and sodden, and takes from it that very crispness which is its chief attraction. Crumpets. Toast these in the griller for two minutes and a half on each side, butter them, and cut them across in halves as soon as they are buttered. Do not wait until they are all done and piled up before cutting through them or they will be heavy, and the butter will run down in the dish. Serve very hot, piled up on a hot-water dish. Muffins. Draw the point of a knife all round the muffins so as to divide the two edges, but without cutting right through ; toast them in the griller three minutes on each side. Pull them apart, butter the inside of each half, put them together again, cut them across in halves, and pile up on a hot-water dish. Serve at once. SEASONABLE BREAKFAST DISHES. JANUARY.

General Directions—Roasting. 41 middle of the roaster, and keep the gas full on for five minutes, basting with good beef dripping; then lower the gas to half full on, and cook for half an hour, basting occa- sionally ; turn the gas full on for ten minutes. Serve with gravy and apple sauce (see page 126) in tureens. The forcemeats given for goose are suitable for ducks, reckoning for one duck half the quantity given for a goose. If a pair of ducks are roasted, a different forcemeat may be used for each to suit all tastes. Sucking-Pig.—Choose a sucking-pig about three weeks old ; wipe it thoroughly, stuff it with a forcemeat, sew the slit securely; heat the roaster for ten minutes ; rub the pig all over with fresh Lucca oil, and spit it securely in the middle of the roaster. Start the turnspit; allow five minutes with the gas full on, then turn it to half full on for two hours; baste constantly with good Lucca oil, which is better than anything else for this purpose. Turn the gas full on for twenty or twenty-five minutes to brown, and stop basting five minutes before taking up the pig. Turn out the gas and stop the motor. Lift the pig out, and put it on a hot dish ; cut off its head and remove the brain. Split the pig down the back, and lay the two halves back to back in the dish, with the head at the top. Have ready some good beef or veal gravy; rub the brain through a wire sieve into it; add a little cayenne pepper, salt, and a squeeze of lemon. Warm for a minute or two, if necessary. Send up also apple sauce in a boat, and currants on a plate with the pig. Forcemeat for Sucking-Pig.—Pass through a sausage machine a pound of fresh pork, a pound of veal, and half a pound of calfs liver; add a shallot, finely chopped up, a tea-spoonful of powdered sage, one of thyme, and a salt- spoonful of grated nutmeg. Season with a tea-spoonful of salt and a salt-spoonful of pepper. Butter six slices of bread, cut from a tin loaf and free from crust; spread on

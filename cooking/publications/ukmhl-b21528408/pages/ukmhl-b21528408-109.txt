Take three partridges and two wild rabbits. Put them in a large saucepan or pot with three and a half quarts of cold stock (see page 55), two carrots, and one onion stuck with four cloves; a bunch of herbs (parsley, marjoram, thyme, and a bay-leaf tied together), a dessert spoonful of salt, thirty peppercorns. Set this on the gas turned half- full on, and bring slowly to boiling point. Skim carefully. When free from scum, simmer for three hours. Strain the soup and let it get cold, putting back the partridges and rabbits in it to cool. When they are partly cooled, take them out and remove all the flesh from the bones. Pass it through a sausage machine, or .pound it in a mortar, adding to it six ounces of bread soaked in half a pint of the liquor. Rub all this through a sieve, and put it in a saucepan with the rest of liquor, reserving four ounces of flesh for the quenelles {see below). Warm over the gas turned half full on, stirring to mix it well, taking care it does not boil. The soup can be prepared at leisure, but the pounded meat should not be put in the liquor longer than is neces- sary to mix it well, and warm it just before serving.

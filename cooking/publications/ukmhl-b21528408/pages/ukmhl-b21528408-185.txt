Home Dinners—September. 171 Fried Eels. Sauce Ravigote. Skin and cleanse an eel weighing about two pounds. Put three quarts of water in a saucepan over the gas turned three-quarter full on. When it boils, put in the eel, turn out the gas, cover the saucepan, leave it for three or four minutes. Take out the eel and wipe it carefully ; this will remove the inner oily skin, and make the fish more digestible. Trim it and cut it in pieces three inches long. Put a pint of water and a wine-glassful of white wine in a stewpan, add a carrot and an onion sliced, four peppercorns, and a pinch of salt. Set this over the gas turned three-quarter full on and boil up; put the pieces of eel in, and as soon as it boils again reduce the gas to half full on. Simmer for half an hour, occasionally shaking the pan. Turn out the gas, and let the eel cool in the liquor for twenty minutes. Take it out, wipe it lightly, and leave it to get quite cold. Put the liquor over the gas again, and simmer it for twenty minutes ; strain it and reserve it for the sauce. Whisk two eggs briskly with a table-spoonful of oil and one of cold water. Roll the cold pieces of eel lightly in flour, dip them in the beaten egg, cover them with bread-crumbs, and fry in hot fat, and drain them on a hot cloth. Dish up and ornament with crisply-fried parsley. Ravigote Sauce.—Put the strained liquor from the eels in a small saucepan over the gas turned three-quarter full on. Chop up finely a handful of herbs : chervil, tarragon, burnet, chives, mustard and cress. Add these to the stock and boil up again. Mix in a stewpan aji ounce of butter and one of flour smoothly; pour the stock and herbs on this with one hand, stirring well with the other. Add an anchovy, washed, dried, and chopped small, a gherkin also chopped up, and a dessert-spoonful of capers, a little pepper and salt, and serve hot without boiling again. This sauce can also be made with any fish stock. Made

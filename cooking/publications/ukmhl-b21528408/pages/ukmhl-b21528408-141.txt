Home Dinnersâ€”January. 127 half full on, and stew gently for two hours to two hours and a half according to the thickness of the celery. Add a little stock occasionally as the liquor reduces by boiling. When a fork or skewer passes through it easily it is done. Drain and wipe each piece carefully. Lay them on a hot dish, three side by side, two over these, and one on the top. Pour over them a good brown sauce. The liquor in which they have simmered is a good flavouring for soup. Pancakes. Put in a basin one pound of sifted flour, with a pinch of salt. Break and mix in gradually three whole eggs.

Put another piece of fat in the pan and melt it, pour in just enough batter to cover thinly the bottom of the pan (about three-quarters of a soup ladleful). Fry for three minutes, occasionally loosening the edges with a fork, so that they do not stick to the pan and burn. When the pancake slips easily in the pan, toss it and cook the other side for two minutes.

Turn the pancake out on the dish, dredge it with castor sugar, and roll it up in a long thin roll. Make the rest of the pancakes in the same manner. When they are all done and rolled up, dredge the the outside with icing sugar, turn the gas full on in the

Put it in a stewpan with an ounce of butter, a salt-spoonful of salt and a pinch of pepper. Set the stewpan over the gas turned half full on, and stew gently for three-quarters of an hour. Rub the sorrel through a wire-sieve and return it to the stewpan with a quart of light white stock. Turn the gas three-quarter full on, and boil up ; skim, add a quarter of a pint of very good milk or cream. Beat two yolks of eggs in a basin, turn out the gas under the stewpan, and stir the eggs in. Serve at once. Hand round small dice of fried bread on a plate. This is essentially a summer soup. It makes a pleasant change, and is both tasty and wholesome. Pick all the flesh from the tail and claws of a large lobster or two medium sized ones. Take out the coral, wash it well, dry it in the oven or under the griller, rub it through a wire sieve, and put it aside for use. Crush the shell and put it in half a pint of stock. Set the saucepan over the gas turned three-quarter full on and simmer for half an hour to extract the flavour. Cut up two large onions and put them in a stewpan with an ounce of butter over the Curried Lobster,

L unch eons—December . 227 When they feel soft and yielding, they are done. Take them out and let them cool, turn the gas up under the saucepan, boil the syrup until reduced to barely half the quantity, skim it well, strain it, and put it aside to cool. The pears being cool, core them with an apple corer pushed in at the end opposite to the stalk, but not right through so as not to spoil the shape ; or, if more convenient, scoop the core out with a vegetable scoop. Fill the pears with pistachio cream made as below, and when ready to serve, stand them on a glass dish five round and one above in the middle, stick in each an inch of angelica to represent the stalk, pour the syrup over them, and serve at once. Pistachio Cream.—Put a quarter of a pound of pistachio nuts in a small saucepan of cold water, put over the gas turned three-quarter full on and boil up. Drain the pis- tachios, rub them in a cloth to remove the skins. Pick them out and pound them in a mortar with a little orange flower water. Turn them out in a basin, add to them a quarter of a pint of whipped cream, a table-spoonful of fine sifted sugar, and, if necessary, a few drops of sap green. Fill the cavity of the pears with this cream by the aid of a forcing-bag and plain pipe. If the pears used are too large for stewing whole, cut them in halves, and stew as above. Scoop out the core so as to make a round place in the middle of each half and squeeze the cream on this, through a rose pipe; this is very pretty. Arrange them round the dish, each half slightly overlapping the next. Pour the syrup in the middle, not on the pears. DECEMBER. Stewed Eels. Grilled Steak with Potatoes Sou- fflees.

General Directions—Grilling. 43 tender and juicy cutlet or a piece of fillet steak carefully trimmed and done to a turn in the griller; whilst to a hungry man, whose appetite has been sharpened by keen air, a porter-house or rump steak cooked by the same pro- cess, and accompanied by the dainty pommes soufflees and the piquant tomatoes, or perhaps the homely but savoury onions, will indeed be a feast. It has been mentioned that it is well to have two grids fitting in the same pan, one being used for meat and birds, the other for fish. These must be kept very dry and free from rust. When about to use the griller, light the burners, and heat the griller for two or three minutes; then wipe the grid with a rough cloth, and rub it with a little fat to pre- vent the meat from sticking to the bars. While cooking, turn it over two or three times with a pair of steak-tongs, which are preferable to the use of a fork, as they do not prick the meat. One pound of steak cut an inch thick will take twenty minutes; if done more quickly, it will be dried up outside without being well done inside. (See “ Grilled Steak,” page 228.) Loin chops take from hvelve to fifteen minutes, according to size and thickness; neck cutlets, five or six minutes; and lamb cutlets, not more than four minutes. Pork chops, on the contrary, which require slow and very thorough cooking, will take twenty minutes. Generally speaking, when the meat feels soft and spongy between the tongs, it wants a little more cooking ; but as soon as it feels firm and looks a rich brown, it is done. A spring chicken, split and grilled, will cook in thirty minutes; pigeons done in the same way, twenty minutes; small birds, such as snipe, plovers, etc., cooked whole, from eight to ten minutes. For salmon steaks cut about an inch thick, allow twenty minutes, with the gas three-quarter full on ; medium-sized split mackerel, the same time ; a salmon-trout weighing about two pounds, thirty minutes; kippered herrings, ten

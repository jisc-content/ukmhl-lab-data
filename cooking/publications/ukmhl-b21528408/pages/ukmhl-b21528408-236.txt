The Art of Cooking by Gas. 222 full on and boil for five minutes, keeping the spinach well under water with a wooden spoon. Drain it, wash it quickly in cold water, so that it does not discolour. If left to cool by itself it would turn yellow. Spread it on a board and look it carefully over to remove any little straw, twigs, etc., that might be left in undetected at the first washing. Gather it together again and chop it for five minutes; rub it through a wire sieve to make it smooth. The stewpan having been rinsed and wiped, melt in it an ounce of butter, and mix smoothly with it half an ounce of flour. Stir this over the gas three-quarter full on for three minutes, put in the spinach, being careful to scrape off that which adheres to the under part of the sieve. Add gradually a quarter of a pint of good gravy, a pinch of pepper and a little salt if necessary. Keep stirring the spinach briskly round so that it does not stick and burn. In five minutes turn out the gas, add an ounce of butter or a quarter of a pint of cream. Mix well and serve with poached eggs, as directed below, or with fried croutons cut to pretty shapes. Poached Eggs.â€”Put a quart of water in a rather shallow stewpan with a wine-glassful of French vinegar and a tea- spoonful of salt. Set this over the gas turned three-quarter full on and bring to boiling point. Break six fresh eggs, one by one in the water, holding them just above the water to drop them, as if they fall from a height they may break. Keep them well apart from each other. Cover the stewpan, and let the water boil again. In four or five minutes at the most the eggs will be set and done. Lift them out with a slice, trim the white a good round shape with a knife or a plain pastry cutter. Sprinkle a pinch of salt and one of pepper on the top, arrange them on the spinach, and serve at once. If an egg-poacher is used, the water must be boiling with the poacher in it, before the eggs are, put in.

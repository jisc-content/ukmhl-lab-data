Turnips for Garnishing Duck.—Peel twenty-four young turnips. Wash and drain them, boil them for five minutes in water to which a little salt has been added; drain them again. Put an ounce of butter in a stewpan, add the turnips and fry them, shaking the pan to colour them evenly; eight minutes will be quite sufficient for young turnips. Full-grown turnips can be treated in the same manner, but they should be cut in pieces the size and shape of pigeons’ eggs, and fried for ten minutes.

Beat the seasoning lightly with a fork and pour it in. Toss the potatoes well in it, but not roughly, to keep them unbroken. Keep the salad for an hour in a cool place, and stir it once more before serving. A couple of truffles

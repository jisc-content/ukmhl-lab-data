134 The Art of Cooking by Gas. Scotch Woodcock. Cut two large slices of stale bread, remove the crust, toast and butter the bread on both sides. Soak in cold water six or eight anchovies, according to their size. Wash, bone, and scrape them thoroughly; dry and pound them with the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, and two ounces of fr'esh butter, colour with a little lobster butter (see “ Lobster Sauce ”), or a few drops of carmine. Add a very little cayenne pepper, and rub the whole through a sieve. Spread this mixture on one of the pieces of toast, and put the other piece over. Press them together. Cut through the middle lengthwise, and divide each half in pieces about one inch wide. Dish these round, one overlapping the other. Warm two ounces of butter in a saucepan over the gas turned half-full- on, mix a quarter of a pint of cream with two raw yolks of eggs well-beaten, add this to the butter with a pinch of salt, and a little cayenne pepper. Stir until thick and creamy-looking, but do not let the sauce boil; pour it through a strainer over the toast, and serve hot. MARCH. Diver de Care me. Potage aux Hnitre;. Filets de Sole en Aspic.

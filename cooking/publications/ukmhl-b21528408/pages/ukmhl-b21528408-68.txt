54 The Art of Cooking by Gas. no fear that the pot will boil too fast at any time, as it would on a fire when that fire is replenished with coals, or cease boiling altogether when these coals have burned away more quickly than the cook anticipated. The absolute regularity of heat obtained by the use of gas goes far in making the soup not only good, but bright. Stocks. As stocks are indispensable for carrying out properly most culinary operations, a careful cook should never be without stock of some kind, which, except in the very hottest weather, can always be kept for at least a day or two. This will not add materially to expense, but, on the contrary, will be the, means of getting the utmost nourishment and usefulness from the articles of food employed, provided that the materials used are quite sweet and free from taint. A few directions are given here for the various stocks referred to in the composition of the dishes described here- after. The liquor in which salt beef, ham, or to?igue, has been boiled, if not too salt, comes in best for purees, pea soup, lentil soup, potato soup, etc. The liquor from a boiled fowl or rabbit, being white and inclined to gelatine, is useful for such white sauces as chaud- froid, bechamel, etc. The carcase of the bird, when sent down from the table, should be broken small, and simmered in the liquor for an hour, and this liquor strained and set aside for use. If but little flesh is left on the bones, it should be put in along with them ; but if, say, the flesh of half a fowl is left, pick it carefully off the bones and set it aside for croquettes, mayonnaise, or curry. The liquor from boiled fish can be treated in the same manner, the skin, head, and bones of the fish being put to boil in the liquor, then strained off. Any fish that remains is used in croquettes, brandade, or kedgeree.

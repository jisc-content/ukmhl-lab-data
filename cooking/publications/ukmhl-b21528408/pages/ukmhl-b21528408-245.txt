Divide it in three or four pieces for greater convenience, roll each piece out to an eighth of an inch thick, cut it in strips half an inch broad and three inches long ; rub a very little flour on each side of these to prevent them from sticking together. Put three pints of water in a stewpan, add a tea-spoonful of salt and a pinch of pepper. Turn the gas three-quarter full on and boil up, put in the nouilles, a few at a time, with the left hand, while stirring with a wooden spoon held in the other. When they have boiled for five minutes, turn them out in a strainer or colander, wash them in cold water, and lay them on a sieve to drain. Melt an ounce of butter in a stewpan, put in the nouilles, sprinkle in an ounce and a half of grated Parmesan or Gruyere; stir well, add a very little cayenne pepper, two table-spoonfuls of good gravy, and a quarter of a pound of cooked ham or tongue divided in small dice. Just warm through, pile up the nouilles on a hot dish, and pour a tomato sauce (see page 73) round them. Macaroni also can be dressed in the above fashion, and, on the other hand, nouilles can be served a la Napolitaine (see page 192) or au gratin, like macaroni (see page 101). Pine-Apple Croustades. Cut ten or twelve slices, half an inch thick, from a sponge-cake (see page 247) or a savarin (see page 77). Stamp them into rounds two and a half inches broad. Strew them thickly with icing-sugar, and put them on a baking-tin in the warm oven to set. Divide a fine preserved pine-apple in slices of the same thickness and size ; lay these in a deep dish, and reserve the parings for the sauce. Put the syrup in a saucepan with a table-spoonful of brandy and one of maraschino; boil up, skim, pour the syrup through a strainer over the pine-apple; let it stand for ten minutes in a warm place. Dish up, with one slice of pine-apple and one of cake alternately standing round the dish.

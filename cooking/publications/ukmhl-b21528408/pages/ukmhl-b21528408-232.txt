The Art of Cooking by Gas. 2 I 8 looks quite thick and firm. Divide it among the mushrooms, smooth over, cover it with brown bread-crumbs, and bake for twenty minutes in the oven of the kitchener, which Iras been heated for ten minutes previously, reducing the gas to three-quarter full on when the mushrooms are put in. Prepare six round croutons half an inch thick and two inches and a half across, fry them in hot fat, and drain them. Put three mushrooms on each crouton, two or three drops of lemon-juice on each mushroom, and serve at once. Sweet Omelet. Break six very fresh eggs, yolks and whites in separate basins. Add three ounces of castor sugar to the yolks, a pinch of salt, and a pinch of yellow lemon-rind very finely chopped ; mix well without beating. Put an ounce of sugar with the whites, whisk them until quite stiff, then stir them lightly with the yolks. In the meantime, melt half an ounce of fresh butter in the omelet-pan over the gas turned three- quarter full on. Put a dish in the oven, previously lighted for five minutes, and spread on the middle of it half a pound of apricot marmalade, or any other jam to taste. Put the eggs in the pan and tilt it gently, so that the omelet ■will assume a half-moon shape ; as soon as it is set slip it on to the dish. Sprinkle a little icing sugar over it, and leave it in the oven for about six minutes; when it has risen and looks brown and glazed, it is ready, and must be taken to the table without a moment’s delay. If the oven is in use when the omelet is made, it can be put under the griller, previously heated for five minutes, the grid and pan being removed and the dish put in their place. The sweet omelet can also be made like the omelet with herbs, but the herbs and seasoning are omitted; a table-spoonful of sugar added to the eggs while whisking, and the jam instead of being put in the dish under the omelet is put in the omelet itself before it is folded over.

Peel some rather small onions, enough to have hall an ounce of them, slice them, throw them in boiling water and boil them for five minutes ; drain them. Melt an ounce of butter in a stewpan, over the gas turned three-quarter full on, add the onions and fry them a bright brown. Pour in half a pint of bechamel sauce (see page 251), stir smoothly together, slice the eggs thinly with a knife dipped in hot water, re- serving the yolk of one egg. Mix the eggs well with the sauce, taste to ascertain if any pepper or salt is wanted, then turn out the contents of the stewpan on a hot dish which will stand fire, sprinkle a dessert-spoonful of brown bread- crumbs on the top and put the dish under the griller for ten minutes. Rub the yolk of egg through a sieve and sprinkle it over the dish; do the same with a dessert-spoonful of finely chopped-up parsley and serve at once. When a salmon, or piece of salmon, has been served for dinner, pick carefully from the bones all the fish that is left, chop it up quite small, and having about a pound and a half of fish, put the bones and trimmings in half a pint of milk over the gas turned three-quarter full on, simmer for twenty minutes and strain. Proceed as for lobster croquettes (see page 208). If the fish is not of a very good colour, add a very little coral butter (see page 84), or, failing this, a few drops of carmine; but, of course, the salmon having a colour of its own does not want so much colouring as lobster, which is white. The colour of the fish and sauce together should not be deeper than that of the fish alone. Having prepared MAY. Croquettes of Salmon. Broiled Kidneys. Potted Ham. Plovers’ Eggs.

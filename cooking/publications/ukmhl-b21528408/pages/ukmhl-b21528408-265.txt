Besides, the fish is apt to be unevenly cooked, the outer part of it being so much more exposed to the hot fat than the inner side, which is curled on itself. It is'very prefer- able, if the fish are fried whole, to fry them straight and dish them side by side. The carver can then slip the fish-carver along the backbone and lift off half the fish at once, so that each person need only have to deal with a few stray bones instead of with a complete specimen of ichthyological osteology. Chicken Bechamel. Cut off all the meat left on a cold fowl or pair of fowls, and divide it in very small pieces. Have about a pound of this. Melt an ounce of butter in a stewpan over the gas turned three-quarter full on, and mix smoothly with it an ounce of flour, fry for three minutes without discolouring, add three-quarters of a pint of well-flavoured white stock, and stir until the sauce boils, skim it, add a quarter of a pint of cream, pepper and salt if necessary, and a pinch of grated nutmeg. Put in the chicken, and stir gently over the gas half full on, to warm through. It can then be served piled up on a hot dish and ornamented with fried croutons, but it also looks very pretty if put in silver or plated shells, allowing one shell to each person. A little finely-chopped parsley or a pinch of lobster coral can be sprinkled on the top. This is useful as a luncheon dish, and also to fill a vol au vent (see page 194). Scrambled Eggs with Peas. Prepare the eggs as directed on page 1S8. Melt half an ounce of butter in a stewpan, add half a pint of plainly boiled peas-(^<? page 75), sprinkle in a tea-spoonful of flour, a pinch of salt, one of pepper, and one of castor sugar. Mix well for five minutes, add the peas to the eggs, stirring them well in, and serve garnished with fried croutons.

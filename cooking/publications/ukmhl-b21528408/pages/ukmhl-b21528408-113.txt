Dinners for the Four Seasons—October. 99 brown, take them out with a slice and put them aside in a deep dish. Lay six pigeons in the butter, and turn them once or twice over so that they get evenly browned, take them out and lay them aside with the bacon. Put four ounces of flour in the pan and mix it smoothly with the butter until it is a rich brown. Add a quart of good stock, a dessert-spoonful of salt, a tea-spoonful of pepper.

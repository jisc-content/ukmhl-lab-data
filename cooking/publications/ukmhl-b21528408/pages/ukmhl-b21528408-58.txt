In all cases put a little butter on the meat or fish that is being grilled to keep it moist. Keep the griller very clean and free from rust. Frying. A special burner giving off very sharp heat is provided, both on the Charing Cross kitchener and the Bruxelles hot-plate, for the purpose of frying. Frying includes two dis- tinct processes : (i) that which is done in the usual shallow frying pan, and is suitable for omelets, sweet and savoury, pancakes, etc. ; and (2) the frying of fish, croquettes, and other delicacies, which can only be done successfully by plunging in very hot fat the various articles of food to be fried. For the former process only just enough butter or fat to cover the bottom of the shallow pan is used, care being taken that the pan is perfectly clean and free from rust. For the latter purpose use a pan about nine inches broad and four inches deep, which is a good convenient size, except for very large soles, etc., when the oval pan and strainer will be preferable; and, for small articles, a wire basket which fits the inside of the pan so as to be easily lifted in and out (see Fig. 22). Three pounds of fat, or three pints of oil, if preferred, will be found sufficient for a pan of the size indicated. This quantity, which no doubt will seem large to those accustomed to use a small piece of butter in a shallow frying pan, is. in reality, much more economical; for, if clarified after use and kept in a cool place, it will serve over and over again until it begins to acquire a brown tint and a slightly burnt smell, when it is no longer fit for use. A separate quantity of fat should be kept for frying sweet things, such as beignets souffles, apple fritters, etc., for, though, of course, no salt must ever be put in frying fat, it may retain a savoury taste which would be quite out of place in a sweet dish.

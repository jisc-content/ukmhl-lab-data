198 The Art op Cooking by Gas. mussels, oysters, etc., are all good for this dish ; in fact, the more variety is introduced the better. Everything ex- cept oysters must be cooked beforehand. Cut the liver and brain in slices an inch thick, dip them in frying batter, and fry them in hot fat. Divide the artichoke bottoms in round pieces the size of a halfpenny with a vegetable cutter, and fry them in the same manner. Beard the oysters and fry them also in batter, and finish by frying parsley for garnishing. Drain everything thoroughly on a hot cloth. Sprinkle a little fine salt on each of the articles. Pile up the larger slices in the middle of the dish, arrange the oysters and artichoke bottoms in little groups around, and crown with a bunch of crisp parsley. Serve hot. If mussels are used, they should be cooked as directed for those used in garnishing the Sole Normande (see page 219). Their liquor and the liquor and beards of the oysters will be useful for flavouring fish stock. Pigeons Spread Eagle. (Poor Man's Sauce.) Take three young fat pigeons. Split them down the back, take out their livers, and spread them on the table, bat them flat without breaking the bones any more than possible, twist the wings up on each side of the breast.

Dip a brush in the butter and brush the pigeons all over, upper and under side, and divide the seasoning amongst them, cover- ing the breast smoothly with it. Then brush them over with beaten egg, and cover them with bread-crumbs, hand- ling them carefully so as not to disturb the seasoning. Light the gas for five minutes in the griller, wipe the pan

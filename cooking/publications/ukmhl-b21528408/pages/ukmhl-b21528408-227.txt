L UNCHEONS—A UGUST. 213 When the chicken has been simmering for thirty-five minutes, add the onions, the mushrooms and their liquor, to it; stir carefully to mix the contents of the pan, and cook for twenty minutes more. Dish the pieces of chicken in the following order :— In the middle of the dish put the two pieces of the back side by side ; on these the pinions and the two pieces of the neck ; on the top, the two pieces of breast. Keep all this a good square shape, and lean against it, standing round the sides, the two legs, the thighs, and the wings. Arrange the onions and mushrooms in little bunches between the joints, and put a fine well-shaped mushroom at the top. Put the dish in the oven to keep warm. Beat lightly three yolks of eggs with a tea-spoonful of lemon-juice and a spoonful or two of the sauce, then gradually pour the mixture in the sauce, stirring to make it smooth and creamy; taste it to ascertain whether it is salt enough, as no other salt has been put in than that used in cooking the mushrooms. Pour the sauce through a strainer over the fricassee so that it is evenly covered, and serve hot. The point to be aimed at in a fricassee being to keep it perfectly white and creamy it is well to omit the liver, which might colour the sauce. But this need not be wasted, as chicken livers are always useful for farces, etc. A fine cray- fish placed on the top and four smaller ones round the sides give a very elegant look to the fricassee, or it can be gar- nished more simply with fried croutons round the dish, and a little lobster coral sprinkled on the top. Grilled Tomatoes. Cut a dozen fine tomatoes in halves. Put on each half a pinch of pepper and salt mixed together, a pinch of finely-chopped up parsley, and a piece of butter the size of a Spanish nut. Heat the griller for five minutes, wipe the grid and pan, and rub the bars with a little butter.

Dinners for the Four Seasons—April. 67 a short thick fish, and weighing about six pounds ; scale and cleanse it carefully. Put in the kettle enough cold water to cover the fish, adding to each quart of water two table- spoonfuls of French vinegar and a dessert-spoonful of salt, a carrot, an onion, and a turnip sliced, a few sticks of celery, a leek, a bunch of herbs (parsley, thyme, and a bay leaf or two), and eight or ten peppercorns. Put this over the gas and boil up, skimming carefully; when boiling and free from scum, put the fish on the strainer and plunge it in the kettle; some scum will presently rise and must be removed. ,As the water begins to boil again reduce the height of the gas, so that the fish only simmers, for if cooked too quickly the outside will break and the inside will not be done. Allow for thick fish, ten minutes to each pound ; for thin fish, eight minutes, reckoning from the time the water boils again. So the piece of salmon mentioned above as weighing six pounds will take an hour’s gentle simmering. When ready to serve, see if any more scum has risen to the surface, and having taken this off, turn the gas out, lift the strainer out with the fish on it, drain it well by resting for a minute or two crosswise on the kettle and slide carefully on to a very hot dish covered with a neatly-folded serviette, garnish with green curly parsley, prawns, and slices of lemon. Serve with sauce hollandaise, and send a dish of sliced cucumber up to the table with it. Sauce Hollandaise. The real Dutch sauce is nothing more than the best fresh butter obtainable, heated until liquid. Put the butter in an enamelled saucepan, and set it on the gas turned half-full on, so that it does not melt too quickly and does not boil. When half melted remove the saucepan from the fire; it will retain enough heat to finish melting the butter; stir gently with a wooden spoon until quite melted and smooth, remove any scum that may rise to the surface,

Bread-and-Butter Pudding. Butter six slices of bread, free from crust. Make a custard with a pint of milk and two eggs, as directed for Baked Custard (see page 151). Put two table-spoonfuls of picked currants, raisins, sultanas or dried cherries in a deep dish, arrange the slices of bread-and-butter in layers, and pour the custard over the whole so that the bread may be evenly soaked; strew a spoonful more of the fruit on the top. Light the gas in the oven for ten minutes, put in the pudding, reduce the gas to half full on, and bake for twenty-five minutes. APRIL. Fritto Misto. Pigeons Spread Eagle. Poor Man’s Sauce.

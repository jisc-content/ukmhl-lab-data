Dinners for the Four Seasons—Christmas. 113 more than two inches long, and cooked for an hour in half a pint of weak stock to which a pinch of sugar has been added ; turnips treated in the same manner and cooked for half an hour; mushrooms, blanched for ten minutes in boiling water, with a little salt. Bake twenty-four chestnuts for twenty minutes, having cut a little piece off the point to prevent bursting, then peel them. Cut twenty-four pieces of rather lean bacon the same size and shape as the carrots and turnips, and fry them in a little butter. All these things can, and indeed should, be prepared beforehand in the manner indicated, and put aside until wanted. Sausages a la Chipolata.—These little sausages, which give their name to the dish, are best made at home. Cut up one pound of fresh pork and one pound of bacon. Be sure there is no bone, skin, or gristle left in. Add pepper, salt, a little pounded sage, allspice, and cloves—one tea-spoonful of each, pass the meat twice through a sausage machine, and fill with it very carefully washed sausage skins about three- quarters of an inch in diameter, divide in little sausages not more than two inches long. Prick these in two or three places with a larding needle, put them in a shallow frying- pan with a little butter, to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pan, and cook for twelve to fifteen minutes, turning them well about to cook them evenly. These will be prepared beforehand, but should only be fried just when wanted. When about to serve the turkey put a quart of good brown sauce (see page 73) in one of the saucepans of the bain-marie, with a wine-glassful of Madeira. Put in the vegetables and warm for ten minutes. Put the turkey on a hot dish, arrange the garnish and sausages round it, tammy the sauce, pour half of it over the garnish, and send the rest up to table in a sauce-boat. Roast Sirloin of Beef. Directions for roasting a twelve-pound joint are given on 1

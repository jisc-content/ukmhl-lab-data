Old potatoes and dried vegetables, such as haricot beans, peas, and lentils, should be put in cold water. Salt must always be added ; and in the case of green vegetables, half a tea-spoonful of carbonate of soda is useful in preserving the colour. But though this is quite harmless, many prefer to omit it; and the great point to observe is that green vegetables shall not boil too fast. Many vegetables are simply boiled, and eaten with only the addition of pepper and salt and a little butter; others are more elaborately dressed. But in all cases they must be thoroughly drained before they are prepared for the table, or they will look unsightly and taste washy. Old potatoes should always be boiled in their skins, like new potatoes, if their flavour is to be fully developed. By peeling the potatoes before boiling them, that part is removed which lies just under the skin, and contains the most flavour and nourishment; moreover, the skin, if left on. protects the potato, and prevents it from boiling away. Indeed, according to Dr. Letheby, when potatoes are boiled in their skins, “ the waste is only three per cent., or half an ounce in a pound; whereas if they are peeled first, it is not less than fourteen per cent., or from two to three ounces in the pound.” (Vide Letheby on “ Food,” page 24.) Blanching or Barboiling.—In many instances vegetables such as onions, and other articles of food such as bacon, un- dergo a partial boiling before being put in the sauce or stock in which they are to be cooked. This is called blanching, and is done by putting the vegetables, etc., in boiling water and boiling them for a few minutes, according to directions. The object of this is generally to make onions, shallots, bacon, etc., milder in taste and more digestible. It is also done

Skim, add the anchovies and a little pounded lobster coral, or, failing this, a few drops of carmine, and a very little cayenne pepper, last of all add a tea-spoonful of lemon juice, stir it well in, strain the sauce, and serve it in a tureen. The pike can also be prepared in the same manner and grilled instead of roasted, in which case it must be carefully turned over once or twice, and kept well basted while grill- ing. It can also be roasted or grilled without being larded, but the larding is a great improvement. If plainly roasted it should not be scaled. Stewed Rabbit. Cut a rabbit in small neat pieces, as much as possible all of a size, cutting through the thighs at the thickest part; carefully look for sharp or broken bones, which are dan- gerous and must be removed. Cut half a pound of rather lean bacon in pieces half an inch square and an inch long. Throw these in boiling water over the gas three-quarter full on, boil for five minutes, strain, and wash them in cold water, and wipe them lightly with a cloth. Melt an ounce of butter in a stewpan over the gas turned three-quarter full on, put in the bacon and fry it a light brown. Take it out and put it on a plate in the warm oven. Put the pieces of rabbit in the stewpan, and eook them for ten minutes, turning them now and then so that they may get evenly coloured. Sprinkle in two table-spoonfuls of Hour, and stir to mix smoothly, then put in the bacon, a bunch of herbs, half a pint of good stock, and a quarter of a pint of French white wine, a salt-spoonful of salt, and a pinch of pepper.

The. apples ought not to be set quite upright, but inclined a little on one side so that the ornamentation is displayed to better advantage. Put the remaining apple on the top, and ornament it in the same manner. In the mean- time turn the gas full on under the stewpan containing the syrup, skim it, and colour it with a little saffron, boil up, and pour it through a strainer round the rice. All tins must be done quickly so that the apples do not get cold. Croustades of Anchovies. Prepare six round croutons, two inches in diameter, fried in hot fat and well drained. Bone and wash six anchovies. Boil two eggs for five minutes, throw them in cold water until quite cold and set, shell them, cut them open, and pound the yolks with the anchovies and three ounces of fresh butter, add a very little cayenne pepper, and colour with a few drops of carmine. Rub the whites of the eggs through a wire sieve, and have the same bulk of chopped up chervil. Sprinkle the egg and chervil alternately on the croutons. Put the anchovy puree in a forcing-bag with a rose pipe, and squeeze a piece the size of a walnut on each crouton. Keep cool until wanted. Onion Soup. Sole au Gratin. Fricandeau. Sorrel.

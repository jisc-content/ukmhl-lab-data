When the pie is nearly done, put the pint of stock that is left and half a wine-glassful of sherry or Madeira in a small saucepan over the gas turned full on. If truffles have been used in making the pie, add the parings to the stock. Boil without a lid until the gravy is reduced to half the quantity, skimming it carefully. Stir in a tea-spoonful of lemon juice, strain the gravy, and let it cool for a minute or two. Pour it in the pie through a funnel, and serve. If the pie is eaten cold, the gravy need only be put in lukewarm half an hour after the pie has been removed from the oven. Potato Cakes. Boil three pounds of potatoes. Peel them, rub them through a wire sieve into a basin, add a salt-spoonful of salt and a pinch of pepper, two ounces of dissolved butter, and about a quarter of a pint of milk poured in gradually. The mixture must be soft, yet firm enough to keep in shape. Beat a yolk of egg and stir it in. Light the gas in the griller, and remove the grid and pan. Butter a baking-tin, and divide the potatoes in pieces rather larger than an egg. Pat these into round cakes barely half an inch thick. Lay them on the baking-tin with a piece of butter on each. Put the tin under the griller. When the cakes begin to turn colour (in about five minutes), turn them over, put another little piece of butter on each and a pinch of brown bread- crumbs. In five minutes more they will be ready. Arrange them round a dish, each overlapping the other, and sprinkle a little finely chopped-up parsley on them.

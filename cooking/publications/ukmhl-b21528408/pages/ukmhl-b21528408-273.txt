Farced Eggs and Tomato Sauce. Boil six eggs for ten minutes, and put them in cold water until cold. Shell them; cut them in halves length- wise. Remove the yolks, put them in a basin with their own weight in butter and work them together with a wooden spoon, or pound them with the butter in a mortar, gradually adding two whole raw eggs, which have been lightly beaten, just enough to mix yolk and white, a table-spoonful of chopped-up parsley, a salt-spoonful of salt, and a pinch of pepper. The farce being quite smooth, put enough of it in each half egg to represent a whole yolk ; round and smooth it with a palette knife dipped in water. Butter thinly a fire- proof porcelain dish, spread the rest of the farce on it, and arrange the eggs neatly over this. Warm two ounces of butter in a saucepan and put a spoonful of it on each egg, light the gas in the griller for three minutes, remove the grid and pan, put the dish in their place and warm thoroughly for five or six minutes, or put the eggs in the hot oven for the same time. They should only be slightly browned. Serve hot with a tomato sauce in a tureen. OCTOBER. Thames Dabs. Limandes de la Tamise. Broiled Sausages. Saucisses Grille'es. Poached Eggs. CEufs Poches.

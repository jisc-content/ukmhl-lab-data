58 The Art of Cooking by Gas. skin and fat, or the bones and lean trimmings of a large joint; cut the meat in small pieces, and break the bones also in small pieces. Put in a stewpan a small sliced onion, a sliced carrot, a sprig of parsley, a sprig of thyme, and a bay leaf, tied together; put the bones and meat on these, and pour over them a quarter of a pint of water, just enough to keep them moist. Cover the stewpan, and set it on the gas turned on nearly full. When the whole begins to look brown and dry, reduce the gas to half full on, add a quarter of a pint of hot water (without disturbing the contents of the saucepan), and remove what little fat there may be. The gravy ought to look a deep clear brown. In five minutes more put in three-quarters of a pint of hot water, to make up the requisite quantity, allowing for boiling away. Add a pinch of salt and four crushed peppercorns; turn the gas three-quarter full on, and bring to boiling point; skim carefully, lower the gas again, and simmer gently for two hours. Strain the gravy, and set it aside, if not wanted for immediate use. It only requires warming, and can be served alone, or variously flavoured for poultry, game, etc. Mutton gravy is made in the same manner. The knuckle and trimmings of an uncooked leg of mutton will yield half a pint of good gravy, which can be reserved for other dishes, a well-roasted leg of mutton being usually very rich in gravy. Veal gravy is also obtained by the same process, using either the bones and trimmings of joints, or a pound of the knuckle, which is gelatinous, and makes rich gravy. The carcases and trimmings of cooked fowls, those of boned fowls and turkeys, the giblets, etc., will supply the gravy for poultry. For game, beef gravy is the best, and, whenever practi- cable, should have, added to it, a fumet or flavouring of the game it is to be served with. (See “ Roast Grouse.”)

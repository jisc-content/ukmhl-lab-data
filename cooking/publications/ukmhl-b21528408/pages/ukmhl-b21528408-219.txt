205 L UNCHEONS—-JUNE. Lamb Cutlets with Jardiniere. Allow two cutlets to each person, trim them, by chop- ping off the backbone, scrape off the skin and fat on the cutlet bone, and chop it off within an inch of the meat. For twelve cutlets, dissolve two ounces of butter, dip the cutlets in on both sides. Sprinkle a little pepper and salt on them, and cover them with bread-crumbs. Having lit the gas in the griller for five minutes, wipe the pan and grid, put the cutlets on the grid, and put it back in its place. . Reduce the gas to three-quarter full on, and grill for five minutes, turning them over two or three times with the tongs. Should they be rather thick, one minute longer may be necessary, but if they are overdone they are spoiled. Try them by pinching them between the steak tongs; if they feel soft and spongy, they want more cooking, but as soon as they feel firm, they are done, and must be taken out and served; every moment lost in waiting detracts from their excellence. Pile up the vegetables composing the jardiniere garnish in the centre of a hot dish. Stand the cutets upright all round. Slip a little paper frill on each bone, and away with them to the table as quickly as possible. Jardiniere Garnish.—Peelsome young turnips and carrots, cut them with a vegetable scoop in little balls the size of a small Spanish nut. Have three ounces of each, put them in separate saucepans, each containing a pint of boiling water and a salt-spoonful of salt, simmer them over the gas half full on until tender, they will take about twenty minutes. Ascer- tain that they are done by pricking with a larding-needle, they must be soft, but not broken. Boil three ounces of green asparagus as directed for omelet with asparagus tops (see page 201), three ounces of peas (see page 75), and three ounces of French beans (see page 168). Drain all the veget- ables, and cut the French beans in pieces half an inch square. Melt an ounce of butter in a stewpan, mix smoothly with

Sole Normande. Clean a fine sole and take off the dark skin. Make an incision along the back-bone from head to tail on the side from which the skin has been removed ; then, holding the knife in a slanting position, draw it gently along the slit so as to loosen the flesh from the bone a little on both sides ; this will keep the fish flat while cooking. Butter an oval dish large enough to take the sole and leave a little margin all round; the dish can be either silver or silver-plated, enamelled iron, or fire-proof earthenware. Chop very finely six or eight small onions which have been boiled for ten minutes and drained; sprinkle them over the dish. Pepper and salt the fish on both sides, lay it in the dish and pour a quarter of a pint of French white wine on it, cover it with a buttered paper, put it in the oven, previously lighted for ten minutes, reduce the gas to three-quarter full on, and cook the fish for about twenty minutes. Ascertain that it is done by lifting gently the flesh from the backbone with the point of a knife ; if the bone looks at all red, or even pink, the sole is not done. No precise time can be given, as the thickness of the fish varies a good deal. When it is done the flesh looks firm and opaque, and the backbone quite white. While the sole is cooking, prepare the following things :—Cleanse thoroughly from grit a quart of mussels, by scraping and washing them in several waters. Put them in a stewpan with a small sliced onion, a sprig or two of parsley, a salt-spoonful of pepper, and a quarter of a pint of white wine. Cover the pan and shake it over the gas, turned three-quarter full on. Watch the mussels, and remove at once those which open, they are done ; take them

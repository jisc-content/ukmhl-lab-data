i7° The Art of Cooking by Gas. a little mace, a tea-spoonful of salt, and eight peppercorns. Set this over .the gas turned half full on, and bring slowly to boiling-point, skimming diligently. Simmer for three hours. Strain the soup; put it aside to cool, and remove the fat. If the soup is wanted clear, clarify it as directed on page 65, using half a pound of scraped beef and two whites of eggs for the above quantity, which by simmering will have reduced to about three pints. Return the soup to the stew- pan, with a wine-glassful of sherry or Madeira, in which a dessert-spoonful of arrowroot has been smoothly mixed ; turn the gas three-quarter full on, and heat the soup. Cut the meat in pieces about an inch square, or stamp it in rounds of the same diameter; put it in. Taste the soup, and, if necessary, add a little salt and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper, and just before serving add a tea-spoonful of strained lemon juice. Serve with lemons cut in quarters and cayenne pepper handed round. Thick mock turtle is prepared in the same way, but when the stock is ready for use—that is to say, strained, cooled, and free from fat—put it in a stewpan to heat. Melt an ounce of butter in a small saucepan over the gas turned three-quarter full on. Mix smoothly with it an ounce of fine sifted flour, and fry it to a bright brown ; take a quarter of a pint of hot- stock from the stewpan, and mix it with the flour and butter; add, if liked, a dessert-spoonful of mush- room ketchup and a wine-glassful of sherry or Madeira, and gradually pour the thickening in the soup ; stir it well in, skim, add a tea-spoonful of strained lemon juice, and serve very hot. If calf’s head is prepared in warm weather, it is better to stew the bones as soon as they are removed from the head, for fear they should get tainted; the liquor thus obtained can then be added to that in which the head itself is boiled, and the soup finished as directed.

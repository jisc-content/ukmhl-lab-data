When they are done, turn them out on a pastry- rack to cool. Prepare an icing (see page 80), flavour it with maraschino, kirsch, or cura^oa, according to taste, colour it a delicate pink or green with a few drops of carmine or sap- green ; cover the madeleines with it and return them to the pastry-rack until quite set and dry. THey can also be served without the icing, but their appearance is greatly im- proved by it. They are useful for dessert, luncheon, and five oâ€™clock tea. ringer Biscuits. Put the yolks of six very fresh eggs in a basin with eight ounces of castor sugar and the yellow rind of a lemon peeled off as thinly as possible, then chopped up very finely. Beat lightly with a wooden spoon for a few minutes to mix well. Whisk the whites of the eggs with a pinch of salt until very stiff. Gradually add to the yolks the whites and four ounces of flour, thoroughly dry and sifted. Do this by stirring in lightly a little white of egg, a little flour, then more white of egg, and so on, until all is used. This must be done quickly, while the whites are quite stiff. Put the mixture in a forcing-bag with a plain pipe end, and squeeze it out on a baking-tin covered with a sheet of white paper. Make each biscuit about three inches and a half long by one inch wide, and leave a space of an inch and a half between them to allow for swelling ; dust them with icing sugar. The gas having been lighted for five minutes in the oven of the kitchener, put in the biscuits, reduce the gas a little and bake for ten minutes. They must only take the lightest buff colour. When done take them out and lay them on

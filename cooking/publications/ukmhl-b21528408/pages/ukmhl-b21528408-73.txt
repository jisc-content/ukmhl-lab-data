General Directions—Gravies. 59 These gravies and stocks being made and used sepa- rately, will enable the cook to vary the sauces by keeping each flavour distinct. Nothing is more cloying and more fatiguing to the palate than a certain set of average flavours, introduced in all dishes without discrimination and without change. Note.—There are twenty-four average ladlefuls in a pint of gravy. This is useful to remember when making gravy for a given number of persons. Glaze is clear gravy boiled down to the consistency of a thick syrup. As it will keep for some time, cooks can always have a supply at hand, keeping it in small covered jars. The trimmings from uncooked meat, the bones of roast joints, the meat with which soup has been clarified, can all be used for glaze. If it is made from fresh meat, the preference should be given to shin of beef, knuckle of veal, and the shanks of mutton, as they contain much gela- tine, which thickens the glaze. This should be treated as for beef gravy, strained, and set aside to cool. When the fat has been removed, boil the glaze rather fast over the gas (turned full on), taking care to stir it with a wooden spoon until it coats the spoon like cream. Turn it out into small jars, and keep ready for use. When wanted, place the jar in the bain-marie to dissolve the glaze, and apply it to joints, fowls, etc., with a brush, taking care that the things it is applied to are quite dry. Put it aside to set, or dry it in the hot oven when the joint is to be served hot; or again dissolve a little of it in a sauce to strengthen and improve it. A pint of clear gravy will not yield much more than a table-spoonful of glaze. No salt should be put in stock that is to be reduced for glaze. The boiling and dressing of vegetables is an extensive subject, and many pages would be required to deal with it exhaustively. Only general rules will be given here, and the dressing of most of the “ leading ” vegetables will be

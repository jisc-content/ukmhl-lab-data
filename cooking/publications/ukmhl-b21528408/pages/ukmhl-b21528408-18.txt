The Art of Cooking by Gas. 4 made, it is so spoiled by baking in defective ovens that it is neither palatable nor digestible, both of which it should be. A well-baked fruit pie is a very useful dish for a family; while the more delicate kinds of pastry—patties, bouche'es, vol-au-vent, tartlets, etc.—are amongst the daintiest articles of food, and should be within the reach of all. Pure home- made bread is invaluable, but if baked in the oven of an ordinary kitchener seldom turns out successfully, so that comparatively few people care to run the risk of making it. If we consider the culinary operations carried on on the hot plate of the ordinary kitchener, such as boiling, braising, soup-making, etc., we find that the cook must always keep up a good fire if any heat is to be obtained ; whilst the only means of checking the boiling is to put the saucepan “ on one side ”: that is to say, removing it far enough from the centre of heat that it shall receive only part of it, and that on one side. The process may answer for quite small sauce- pans, but in the case of larger vessels—say one containing a braised turkey, or a ham, or a large piece of fish—the result must be unsatisfactory; for, even allowing for the circulation of water in the braising pan, induced by the one-sided boiling, the pan must be occasionally turned round to ensure even cooking ; and it comes to this, that only half the turkey, etc., is cooking at one time, while the other half is just kept warm. A man might just as well hope to keep himself dry by opening half an umbrella over his head and protecting alternately his left and right shoulder. To avoid these defects, the points to be kept in view in choosing cooking apparatus are :—ist, to secure a plentiful supply of fresh air having access to all parts of the kitcheners, roasters, etc. ; 2nd, to have the source, or sources, of heat under perfect and independent control. Gas is the most suitable fuel for cooking purposes, and, when properly regulated, can be kept at any height, from the lowest flame necessary to obtain a gentle

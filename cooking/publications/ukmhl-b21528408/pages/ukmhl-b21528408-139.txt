Put it again in the pan, this time with boiling water and a tea-spoonful of salt; simmer it for twelve minutes. 1 urn it out in a colander, drain it well, cover it with a cloth, and keep it in the oven for an hour. It will then look snowy white, and each grain will be separate from the others. Scallops in Shells. Open two dozen scallops, beard them, chop them up finely, add to them a slice of bread free from crust, soaked in gravy and squeezed to remove the superfluous moisture. Mix well together. Wash and cleanse thoroughly six of the best shells of the scallops ; dry them, and butter the inside of them. Divide the mixture amongst the shells. Melt an ounce of butter in a saucepan, mix in an ounce of flour smoothly. Pour in through a strainer, a quarter of a pint of hot milk, in which the beards and liquor of the scallops and half a shallot have been simmered for a quarter of an hour. Add a table-spoonful of French white wine, and stir the sauce till it boils. Turn the gas low. Add two yolks of eggs beaten with a tea-spoonful of lemon juice, and a little cayenne pepper. Strain the sauce over the scallops so as to cover them, and sprinkle a few brown bread-crumbs over them. Put the scallops on a baking-tin in the oven, pre- viously heated for ten minutes, and bake them for twenty minutes. Sprinkle upon each a little chopped-up parsley, and serve hot. The best shells should be washed, dried, and kept for use when silver or china shells are not available. (See “ Chicken Bechamel.”) Roast Sucking Pig.

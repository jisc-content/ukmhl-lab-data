General Directions—Boiling, 51 cut an inner circle or oval about a quarter of an inch deep and a quarter of an inch distant from the edge; fry the croustades and drain them, scoop out the middle and the soft inside, leaving the bottom half an inch thick, and fill with pure'e or ragout as directed (see page 258), or stand the eggs upright in the croustades (see page 250). Brown Bread Crumbs.—Dry in the warm oven the crust of a loaf from which the crumb has been taken for making white bread crumbs or pulled bread, or any crust left from cutting croutons, sandwiches, etc. When quite crisp put the pieces of crust in a clean dry cloth, fold it over, and roll the crust into crumbs with a rolling-pin. Pass these through a wire sieve and keep them in a covered jar in a dry place. Boiling. The process of boiling varies greatly, according to the articles to be boiled, and the main point to be considered is whether it is desired to keep in the nourishment and flavour, as in boiling beef, ham, fish, etc., for the table, or to extract that nourishment and flavour, as in soup, broth, and stock making. In the former case, the water must be boiling before the cooking is begun ; in the latter, it should be cold. When a ham, for instance, is to be boiled, the gas must be lighted, and the braising pan filled with as much water as will cover the ham. This water being heated until it boils, the ham will be put in, and as this will have the effect of stopping the boiling, the gas must be left full on until the water begins to boil again ; it should then be turned down a little, so as to just keep the water simmering ; if the water boils too fast, the ham will be hard. In all instances, the meat boiled, if it is to be served cold, should be left to cool in its own liquor ; and as nothing should ever be left to cool in a metal vessel, it must be turned out into a deep basin with the liquor, and put aside until wanted. The meat treated in this way will be more tender

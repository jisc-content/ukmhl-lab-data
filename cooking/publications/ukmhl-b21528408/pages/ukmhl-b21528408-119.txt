Dinners for the Four Seasonsâ€”October. 105 on it in little oval mounds about the size of an egg. Six eggs ought to give twenty-four of these, each piece being half a meringue. Dust them with a little icing sugar, put them in the oven, reduce the gas to barely half on, and leave them for an hour, looking at them occasionally to see that they do not turn colour too quickly ; they ought to take only the faintest brown tinge. Take them out, and, with a small spoon, scoop out a little of the inside. Put them back in the oven to dry. When quite dry turn them out on to a pastry-rack to cool. When cold place a table- spoonful of whipped cream, sweetened and flavoured with vanilla, on one half, and put the other half on. They can be also filled with a puree of fruit, with apricot marmalade, or with creme patissiere. Double this quantity will serve twenty-four people. These form a pretty dish, and are simple to make.

When the almonds are quite dry, put half a pint of salad oil in a shallow frying- pan over the gas, turned three-quarter full on, and when it is boiling put in the almonds and fry them to a pale golden brown. Strain them. Spread a clean rough cloth on the

239 Brea kfa s tsâ€”Janua r y. this dry pickle for three or four days, according to the warmth of the weather. Turn them daily, rubbing well with the pickle each time for a few minutes. When ready to boil the head, put over the gas turned three-quarter full on a braising-pan or other large vessel with three quarts of water in it. Add half a pint of white wine or a quarter of a pint of sherry or Madeira, two onions and two carrots peeled and quartered, a bunch of herbs, and four cloves. Boil up and skim. Wipe the head thoroughly. Put it in the braising-pan, the two halves side by side, add the ears, see that the water covers all. Bring up again to boiling- point, skim carefully, reduce the gas to half full on, and simmer until tender; a small head will take rather less than five hours, a large one nearly six. When the meat comes away readily from the bones, and the skin is quite soft and yielding under the finger, the head is done. Skim again, take the head out and bone it entirely, taking the utmost care not to leave any broken bones in the meat. Cut it all up in small pieces. Skin the tongue, and cut it up in the same manner. Divide the ears in narrow strips. Put all these ready on a dish. Put all the bones back in the liquor, and turn the gas three-quarter full on under the braising- pan, boil without a cover for half an hour to reduce the liquor. Arrange all the meat in layers in a plain round mould, sprinkling between each layer a little pepper and salt and a very little nutmeg. Pour in about half a pint of the reduced liquor. Put on the top a small flat plate or a piece of tin fitting the inside of the mould, and put a weight over it. Put the brawn away to cool, and when quite cold turn it out on a cold dish, and garnish with sprigs of fresh green parsley. Omelet with Herbs. Break six eggs in a basin, add to them a salt-spoonful of salt, one of pepper, a dessert-spoonful of finely chopped-up parsley and, if liked, a very little finely chopped-up chive.

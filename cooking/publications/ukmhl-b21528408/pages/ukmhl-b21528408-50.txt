36 The Art of Cooking by Gas. in place and preventing it from getting dry. Put the spit through the thickest part of the meat from skin to skin, so that the open sides of the meat shall be facing the rows of burners when in the roaster. Put the joint in the roaster, which has been previously heated for ten minutes, and put two large spoonfuls of beef dripping in the pan for basting. Start the turnspit, and keep the gas full on for ten minutes, baste the joint well, then reduce the flames to not more than half full. Being all meat it wants cooking very slowly, to allow the heat to penetrate through the meat without drying the outside. Let the joint cook for an hour, basting it now and then; remove the skin which has been skewered on, to allow the meat to get evenly coloured. Continue cooking for half an hour more, then turn the gas full on for twe?ity minutes to brown the meat well, making a total of two hours, irrespective of the ten minutes for heating the roaster. The forcemeat for roast veal is made as follows :—Chop finely half a pound of suet, free from skin and fibre; mix with it half a pound of bread crumbs, made by rubbing the bread through a wire sieve, the yellow rind of half a small lemon, grated, a tea-spoonful of salt, and half a tea-spoonful of white pepper, marjoram and thyme, half a tea-spoonful of each, a very little mace, and a table-spoonful of chopped parsley. Beat two yolks of eggs together, and mix them with the dry ingredients to make a stiff paste (or use one egg and a little milk); when well mixed and quite smooth, it is ready for use. For directions for veal gravy see page 58. Sauce piquante, sauce Robert, or tomato sauce are all suitable to send to the table with veal. Pork.—Score the skin of a leg of pork round, at intervals of a quarter of an inch, beginning at the knuckle. It can be stuffed with the forcemeat given hereafter, or sage and onion may be sent to the table separately if more agreeable.

74 The Art or- Cooking by Gas. and, having again basted the meat, leave it to cook for two hours, occasionally looking at it through the glass of (he lid, which need only be opened when the meat requires basting. Twenty minutes before it is done turn the gas on nearly full to finish browning the meat. This makes up two hours and a half, irrespective of the ten minutes allowed for heating the roaster. If using a kitchener of the Charing Cross type, allow the same time, but baste more frequently, and turn the meat over once or twice to ensure even roasting.

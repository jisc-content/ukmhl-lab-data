206 The Art of Cooking by Gas. it half an ounce of flour, cook it for three minutes over the gas turned three-quarter full on, add a quarter of a pint of mutton gravy, a pinch of pepper, one of sugar, and one of salt, mix well, put in the vegetables, reduce the gas to half full on, and just warm through, stirring gently so as not to break the vegetables. Pile them up on a hot dish as directed above, and stand the cutlets round them. The trimmings of the vegetables go to the stockpot for flavouring stock. Fried Artichokes. Take three fresh young artichokes, cut off the stalks, re- move the lower leaves, and pare the bottoms as for boiling; then, holding the artichoke in one hand, and the knife in the other, seize hold of five or six leaves, and cut down, so that part of the bottom comes away with them. Throw these pieces in a basin of water to which vinegar has been added in the proportion of two table-spoonfuls to a quart. The middle leaves will cling too closely together to be divided, and must be lifted out bodily; remove the choke very care- fully so that none is left. Each artichoke will yield ten or twelve pieces, according to size. Trim off the topsof theleaves, wipe the artichokes, and season them with a little pepper and salt. Dip them in frying batter, coating them all over evenly, and fry in hot fat. As the artichokes have to be cooked, they must not be fried too quickly, or they will be brown outside before the inside is done. So, having heated the fat, test it by throwing in a piece of bread-crumb. The fat must only just bubble without making much noise. Put in the artichokes, a few pieces at a time, not to cool the fat too much. Move them about with a slice, and when they look a nice brown lift them out, and drain them on a hot cloth. Fry the rest in the same manner and, last of all, a bunch of parsley, picked, washed, and dried. Pile up the pieces of artichokes on a hot dish, and put the crisp parsley at the top.

Dinners for the Four Seasonsâ€”October, iot through a wire sieve into a basin. Put in a stewpan four ounces of butter, a quarter of a pint of milk, a dessert- spoonful of salt, and a tea-spoonful of white pepper. Mix these over the gas turned half full on, and when hot add the potatoes. Turn the gas lower. Stir in, one at a time, four raw yolks of eggs. It must make a rather stiff paste. Do not cover it, or let it boil. When it has acquired the neces- sary consistency, turn it out on a dish, and leave it to get cold. Flour the pastry slab, cut the potatoes in pieces, and with a large palette knife shape them like small apples and pears, touching them as little as possible with the hands. Cover them with egg and bread-crumbs (see page 48), fry them in hot fat, drain them on a hot cloth, and stick in each about an inch of parsley stalk. These little golden apples and pears are very pretty and appetising. Serve hot. Cauliflower au Gratin. Take six fine cauliflowers of medium size. Remove all the leaves, and trim off the stalks. Put the cauliflowers, head downwards, in a bucket or pan of water to which has been added a handful of salt and half a tumbler of vinegar. This will make them firm and white, and draw out any insects there might be in them. Having soaked them for an hour, drain them, and put them in a large pan of boiling water over the gas turned three-quarter full on. Skim carefully. In fifteen to twenty minutes, according to size, they will be done ; take them out and drain them thoroughly, and taking three dishes that will stand fire, divide the cauli- flowers among these, putting the flowers uppermost, raised and rounded in the middle to represent as much as possible a head of cauliflower in each. For the sauce melt four ounces of butter in a stewpan over the gas, mix in two ounces of flour, and when smooth add a quart of milk, half a salt-spoonful of cayenne pepper, very little salt. Bring this to boiling point, constantly

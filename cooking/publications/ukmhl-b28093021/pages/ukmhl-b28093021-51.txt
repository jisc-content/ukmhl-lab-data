47 are to be opaque add a little milk to the water. Place the moulds in a charged souffle ice cave, or, failing this, pack them carefully into a tin large enough to hold the mould or moulds, and allowing sufficient room for the ice (crushed ice) and salt to surround it or them. Allow about three hours for freezing. Great care must be taken to prevent any salt water pene- trating into the moulds, or the ice which is to be served in them will be spoilt. When ready un- mould them care- fully. 57.—SORBETS. The word “sorbet” derives its origin from sherbet ; thus, sorbet originally im- plied an effervescing cooling drink, this being identical with the Oriental sherbet. It was sherbet, we are told, that gave delight to the feasts of Saladin, which shows that the article was associated with all the romance and luxury of Moslem life. We may thus take it for granted that the word sorbet is of Arctic origin, which signifies a beverage frozen into a semi- solid state. Nearly all sorbets and punches contain a small proportion of alcohol in the form of liqueur, spirit, or wine. This may be omitted, but the flavour and character of the ice is thereby spoilt, or at least im- perfect. I woifld, therefore, recommend that a small quantity of the alcoholic liquors be employed in accordance with the directions given in the recipes.

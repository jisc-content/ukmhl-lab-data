32 mix when the former is cold. Freeze as usual, and mould. Note.—A little saffron or saffron ex- tract may be added to the mixture SO' as to gave it a nice yellow tint.

J lemon. About 2 oz. sugar. i pint custard cream (No. 3). I pint double cream (sweetened). Method.—Cut the peaches in halves, take out the stones, break them and re- move the kernels ; put these with the halves of peaches into a copper pan with about a gill of water and enough sugar to taste (2-3 oz.) ; add the lemon rind (cut very thin) and the juice. Cook till the fruit is quite tender, then rub through a fine hair sieve. When the puree is cold, add it to the vanilla custard (No. 3 for- mula). Whisk up the fresh cream, and add likewise. Freeze, and mould it, or dress the ice rough on a pile on a folded napkin, garnish with ice wafers, and serve. A few drops of carmine may be added to the mixture, if liked, so as to give it a pink tint. 28.—THE GLACE A LA CREME. (Tea Cream Ice.)

9 o chino, and freeze; then work in a gill of white cream. Fill the lined mould with this, place some more biscuits on the top, and pack the mould into a charged ice cabinet for about two’ hours, or if no ice cabinet is available, wrap the mould care- fully in several sheets of paper, stand in a pail, and surround with crushed ice and freezing salt; cover it with a tin lid and heap on plenty of crushed ioe and salt; cover all over with a thick cloth and leave for two' hours. When required to serve, remove the ioe, wipe the outside of the mould, dip it for a few seconds into cold water, and turn out on to' a suitable dish. Have ready in a forcing bag with a star tube some whipped cream, and pipe some star shapes neatly over the top of the charlotte ; sprinkle over a few chopped pistachio' nuts and serve at once. 129.—DENISES GLACES. (Ice Cream Sandwiches.) This is a most convenient and dainty way of serving almost any kind of ice. The ice wafers manufactured by Messrs. Peek, Frean and Co. are best adapted for this dish. These wafer's being quite plain and of delicate, light make, the true flavour of the ice is in no way impaired. When the ice cream or water ice is suf- ficiently frozen to' allow it being spread, cover a number of ice wafers with a layer of the ice; place a wafer on the top of each like a sandwich. Pack them in a charged ice pail or cave, place a paper between each layer, and keep thus till required for table. Messrs. Peek, Frean and Co. supply a most useful ice cream sandwich suitable for this purpose.

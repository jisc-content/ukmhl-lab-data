12 Seven or eight pounds of ice to one pound of salt are considered the correct propor- tions to use. It is a great mistake to> use more salt than one pound to eight pounds of ice. Some will add more salt, with a view of making the contents of the freez- ing pot freeze more quickly. This will, of course, be effective for a time, but very shortly after the ice will become reduced to water, and the freezing operation must then come to a standstill. The following are the directions for preparing the freezing pot ready for freezing creams, fruit syrups, pulps, etc. : Crush or pound the ice, put a layer of ice at the bottom of the freezing tub (see illus- tration), sprinkle over some salt, then place the freezing pot in the centre ; see that the lid of the pot is put on securely. The reason of my recommending the freezing pot to be fixed on the top of a layer of ice is because it will revolve much more easily and more quickly. Continue to' fill the sides of the pot and pail or tub with crushed ice and salt in alter- native layers. After the freezing pot has been turned for a short time, some of the ice around it will sink, when the tub or pail must be replenished with more crushed ice and salt. When this is done wipe AMERICAN FREEZER.

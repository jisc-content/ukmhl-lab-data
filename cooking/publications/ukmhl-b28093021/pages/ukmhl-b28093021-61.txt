57 80.—COUPES FRAPPEES A LA CAPUCINE. Ingredients. \ lb. Genoese cake. 4 oz. roasted split almonds. \ pint of vanilla custard. i J gills cream. £ gill coffee (strong). 1 glass Maraschino. 2 table-spoonfuls of Benedictine or Curasao. Method.—Trim the cake so as to> free it from brown crust, and cut the white part into very small dice. Put these in a small basin, pour over the two kinds of liqueur and the coffee (which should be made tepid) ; cover, and let it stand for about an hour. Whip up the cream, and mix it with one-third of the vanilla cus- tard. Add this to the soaked cake, chop finely a few of the almonds, and incor- porate them with the above. Keep the preparation well covered on the ice for about two hours. To serve, nearly fill eight to ten goblets or other suitable stem glasses with the prepared iced custard, then fill completely each glass with cus- tard and whipped (slightly sweetened) cream. Cover the top of each with halves of roasted almonds, which must be neatly arranged. Dish up, insert a cigarette wafer in the centre of each, and send to table. 81.—PUNCH A LA NICOISE.

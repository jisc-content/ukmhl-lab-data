72 107.—SOUFFLfi GLAC6 A LA DUMAS. Ingredients. 6 oz. loaf sugar. J pint water. 8 yolks of eggs. 2 whole eggs. \ gill double cream. A wineglassful Maraschino liqueur. Grated chocolate. Ice and freezing salt. Method.—Put the sugar in a copper pan or sugar-boiler, add to it about half a pint of water, and boil it to thick syrup and remove the scum. Whisk the eggs, yolks and whites, in a basin for about ten minutes, then pour in the hot syrup. Mix thoroughly, and pour into a copper egg- bowl ; stand it over a brisk tire, and whisk the mixture until it becomes of the consistency of cream; add the double cream and whisk a little longer. Allow it to cool, and fill into a plated souffle dish, lining- it with a paper band to come about an inch above the rim so as to prevent the souffle from running over. Place the dish in a round tin (a large cake tin will be found the most suitable for this purpose), fasten it with a tight-fitting lid. Line the bottom of a pail with crushed ice mixed with freezing salt; place the tin on this, pack the sides of the pail with ice and salt, and put some on the top ; freeze thus for about three hours. To serve, take out the tin, wipe it, re- move the lid, take out the souffle, remove the paper band, place the dish on another dish with a folded napkin. Sprinkle the top with grated chocolate, and send to table immediately.

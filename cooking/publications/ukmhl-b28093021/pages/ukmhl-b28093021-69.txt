Cut eight small oranges in halves, cross- wise, squeeze out the juice very gently so as not to break the rind, and, in a like manner, by means of a teaspoon, remove as much as possible of the interior of each orange. Strain the orange juice, and add to it the strained juice of three lemons and if gills of syrup. Freeze this in the usual manner. When sufficiently frozen fill each or as many halves of oranges as possible. Cover the top of each with an “ Omelette Souffle ” mixture. This must be done verv carefully indeed, so as to completely cover the ice. Bake them in a very quick oven, just long enough to’ brown the sur- face. Place each in a wineglass, dish up, and send to table immediately. 98.—VARIOUS PARFAITS. Quite a large number of parfaits can be prepared by adopting the process de- scribed in No. 93 as a basis, omitting, of course, the nougat or almond rock ; in- stead of this, add any desired ingredient with which you wish to’ flavour the parfait, and which take the name of the parfait. As examples, the following may be found useful changes: — Parfait an Kir sell (flavoured with Kirschwasser). Parfait a la Violette (flavoured with crushed crystallized violets). Parfait aux Peches (flavoured with peach pulp). Parfait aux Abricots (flavoured with apricot pulp). Parfait Panache (any two> kinds mixed in layers). Parfait au Mar as quin (flavoured with Maraschino). E

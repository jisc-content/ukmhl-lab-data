machine is used the process is practically the same as above described. When icing mousses, souffles, sorbets, granites, coffee, etc., the process of freezing is somewhat different ; but in such cases I will give the needful directions when deal- ing with the respective recipes of these dishes. When the mixture above described has frozen sufficiently firm, the water should be drawn off from the pail or tub, and when it is desired to keep it for some time longer in the pot before moulding or serv- ing it, more ice (crushed ice) should be put in the tub. Very little salt should be used when refilling. In lifting the lid off the freezing pot, great care must be taken so as not to get any salt into the mixture, for if the least quantity of salt should get into it, the whole of the ice mixture is likely to be- come spoilt. FREEZING WITHOUT ICE. The following ingredients can be used with very fair success for freezing where ice is scarce or unobtainable. Although dearer to> use than ice and salt, it will be found most useful by those who are un- able to get ice : â€” Take 2 parts of sulphate of soda, 1 part of muriate of ammonia, 1 part of nitrate of potash. Pound separately each ingre- dient in a mortar, and mix with water ; 4 ounces of the above mixed with about 1 gallon of water will make a good freez- ing mixture. THE ACTION OF FREEZING. Ice, being colder than water, has to re- ceive heat in order to melt into water. Crush some ice and mix it with coarse

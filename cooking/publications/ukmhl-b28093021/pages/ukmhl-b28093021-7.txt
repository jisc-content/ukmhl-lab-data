PREFACE. This little Manual, which was already proved most useful by its former editions, will doubtless in its revised form maintain its popularity as a guide book for preparing frozen dainties. The book has met the test of hundreds of ex- perienced cooks and received their hearty approval. The authorâ€™s claim that it would fill a want felt by the confectionery branch of the trade has been fully realised. Most cookery books contain recipes for ices (reliable and otherwise); but only in a very few instances has this subject been assigned a separate volume. The present edition, besides being revised and improved, contains a number of new ways of preparing ices for table, as well as several new illustrations. The art of making ices has always been one or the most fascinating branches in cookery, and in compiling the various recipes in this book the author has endeavoured to exercise every possible care to meet the present-day requirements of cooks and caterers, so as to provide for the actual needs of those who are desirous of cultivating this useful and essential branch, which justly belongs to the pleasures of the table.

74 i gill cream. 4 eggs. J oz. gelatine. i small glass Maraschino (this can he left out if desired). Red currant jelly. A few drops carmine or cochineal. Method.â€”Mix the cornflour with the sugar in a stew-pan, stir in the milk, add i oz. of butter and the vanilla pod. Stir this over a slow fire until it comes to a boil; continue to- stir over the fire until the mixture detaches easily from the stew-pan. Let it cool, and remove the vanilla pod (this may be ag-ain used if taken care of). Pick the- strawberries, and put them through a hair sieve. Stir the pulp into* the above before it is quite cold; add also the remainder of the butter. Stir in the yolks of eggs and the cream, and whisk over the fire until the eggs begin to set. Dissolve the gela- tine in a little water, add to> it a table- spoonful of red currant jelly and a few drops of liquid carmine or cochineal; strain this with the mixture; whisk the whites of eggs to a stiff froth, and add likewise; the Maraschino should now be added. Fill a silver-plated souffle dish with this preparation; keep it in a case well charged with ice. Dissolve about two table-spoonfuls red currant jelly, and when nearly cold pour it over the top of the souffle to- form a layer. It is well to fasten a paper band round the souffle case, so that it comes about an inch above the rim; this should be removed before send- ing it to' the table.

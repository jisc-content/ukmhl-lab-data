The freezing of ices is no longer a secret process, for this operation can now be seen at almost every street corner. I deem it, however, essential to give a few practical hints on the process of freezing, because the mere fact of seeing somebody turning the freezing pot does not teach one the needful and proper methods necessary for making successful ices.

In this the best re- sults are obtained by the use of rough ice and so-called freezing salt (coarse salt).

34 31.—CREME AU CAFE GLACEE. (Coffee Cream Ice.) Ingredients. i \ oz. freshly-ground good coffee. 3 oz. sugar. i pint vanilla custard cream (No. 2 or 3). \ gill double cream. 1 glass Kirsch. Method.—Make a strong decoction of the coffee by pouring \ pint of boiling water over the ground coffee. Let it infuse well for half an hour, then strain, add the sugar, and let cool. Mix it with the prepared vanilla cream. Whip the cream, and add, together with the Kirsch liqueur. Freeze in the usual way, mould, or serve in glasses. 32.—ANOTHER WAY. Sweeten a pint of very strong coffee with 4 oz. of sugar. When cold add ij pints of good fresh cream, lightly whisked, and freeze. This ice is im- proved if the coffee is first partially frozen and the whipped cream is added after- wards. WATER ICES. So-called water ices are mostly pre- pared from the juices of ripe fruits, mixed with the needful proportion of syrup. In making these it must be borne in mind that if the mixture is made too sweet there will be a difficulty in the freezing, and as the sweetness of the various kinds of fruit differs, great and special care must be taken in mixing syrup with fruit pulps or fruit juices. In order to test the correct consistency of syrup, the use of a saccharometer is strongly advised.

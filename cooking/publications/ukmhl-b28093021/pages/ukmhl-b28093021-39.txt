35 Syrups can, with advantage, be used for cream and mixed ices, ice puddings, mousses, souffles, sorbets, granites, etc. ; in fact, with all mixtures or drinks that are to be frozen where syrup is used these remarks are applicable. In such cases where fresh fruit is not obtainable jam is often used, and as all jams are made with sugar, it is essential that this be taken into consideration when mixing the syrup. 33.—SYRUP FOR WATER ICES.—No. 1. Ingredients. 2 lb. loaf sugar. i pint water. Method.—Put the sugar into a copper sugar-boiler, add the water, and let it stand till dissolved ; then place it on the fire, which must be bright and clear (not smoky). Allow it to boil ; remove the scum that rises to the surface, and boil it till it registers 220 deg. Fahr. on the saccharometer. Senn’s saccharometer is advised for this purpose, because it is most reliable in giving the correct degrees the syrup has reached in boiling. This instrument can be used for testing the heat of fat, or for registering the oven heat, as well as for sugar boiling, for it registers up to' 382 deg. Every degree, from boiling water to the degree of caramel, is marked in plain letters against the figures, denoting the exact state of heat. Senn's saccharometer is made in a solid brass casing, and is unbreakable ; price 7s. 6d. It can be obtained from the Food and Cookery Publishing Agency, or any first-class ironmonger.

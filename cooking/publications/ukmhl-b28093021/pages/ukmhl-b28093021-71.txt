Add the cream, well whipped, to' the mixture when cool, and fill the mould. Cover with a piece of paper close up to the lid, so as to her- metically seal the mould, bury it in a pail of crushed ice and freezing salt; let it remain thus for at least two hours. When required for serving, immerse the mould in cold water, wipe well, remove the lid, turn out on a dish covered with a folded napkin or dish paper, remove the paper lining, and serve quickly. 101.—MOUSSE A L’ANANAS.

i5 salt. Place in it a mould or glass shape filled with plain or coloured water. Cover it, and put more ice and salt on top. In a short time the salt will cause the ice to melt, and cause the liquid in the mould to freeze into a solid mass. In this manner the shape used for dressing ices upon, referred to elsewhere, are prepared. The operation is simple, and requires but little experience. USEFUL HINTS AND RULES ON ICE- MAKING. Before dealing with the individual re- cipes for making ices I shall give the following simple rules and hints, which should be strictly observed by those who desire to benefit by the recipes and in- structions given on the subject—• 1. Do not put hot or warm mixtures into the freezing pot, as by so doing much of the ice will get wasted. 2. Be careful in weighing and measur- ing the various ingredients required. Use the exact proportions stated in each recipe. 3. Keep a quantity of syrup on hand. If kept in corked bottles it will keep good for a long period, and will always be ready when wanted. 4. In adding sweetening ingredients, sugar or syrups, remember that too much sugar will prevent the ice mixture from getting firm, whilst too little sugar will cause it to freeze too hard. 5. Avoid, as much as possible, the use of tin or copper utensils in the manu- facture of ices, because, by their use, an objectionable flavour is often introduced, and the ices are apt to get discoloured. 6. Keep the mixtures to be frozen out

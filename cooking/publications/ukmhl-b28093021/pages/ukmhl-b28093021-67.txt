63 Chocolate or tea may be served in exactly the same manner, but no liqueur should then be added. PARFAITS, MOUSSES, AND SOUFFLES. 93.—PARFAIT AU NOUGAT. Ingredients. i\ gills syrup. i in. vanilla pod. 5 yolks of eggs. i quart cream. 4 oz. almond nougat or French almond rock, the former should be usedwhenpossible. Method.—Boil the syrup and vanilla in a copper sugar-pan till it registers 240 deg. on Senn's saccharo- meter. Remove the vanilla, and pour the syrup slowly over five well- beaten yolks of eggs. Whisk the pre- paration in an egg-bowl over boiling water until it has the consistency of thick cream. Remove it from the fire, and whisk till cold. Whip the cream, and crush finely the nougat or almond rock ; this is best done by means of a rolling- pin. Mix this and the cream into the first preparation, and stir for some minutes over the ice. Fill a three-pint parfait or bombe mould (lined with paper) with the preparation. Place in salted ice, fix on the lid, cementing the joints with butter, cover with paper, and place a good layer of salt and crushed ice on top. Allow to freeze thus for about hours.

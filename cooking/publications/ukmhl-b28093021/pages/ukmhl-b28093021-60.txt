Note.—A large number of delicious sorbets and g'ranites (or “ granitos,” as they are sometimes called) may be pre- pared without being either elaborate or expensive by using various kinds of fruit in season, adapting a formula for blend- ing and proportions in the foregoing re- cipes, all of which will be found workable. An ingeniously - minded cook should, therefore, have no difficulty in producing a constant change in these preparations, especially during summer, when they are so much appreciated.

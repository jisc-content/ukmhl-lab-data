102 three quarts of water. Add the juice of four lemons, sugar to taste, strain, and stand the jug in the ice box. 161.—BACCHUS CUP. Pour into a clean jug one bottle of champagne, one pint of sherry, \ pint of brandy, one wineglassful of noyeau, a few balm leaves, 4 oz. castor sugar, a large piece of clear ice. Let the mixture stand for a little while, then, just before serving, add two> bottles of seltzer or potash water, and serve. This cup is delicious, but rather expensive. 162.—WHISKY PUNCH. Take half a pound of loaf sugar, and with it rub off the rinds of three lemons ; put into' a basin, and pour over this a quart of boiling water. When the sugar is dissolved, pour all into the punch bowl. Now add the juice of the three lemons, passed through a strainer. When cold, add a bottle of Scotch whisky. Pack the bowl in a large vessel or bath surrounded with ice ; let the punch stand thus for at least one hour before it is served.

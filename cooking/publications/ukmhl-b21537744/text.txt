F the making of Cookery Books, we are told. there is no end, but the comparative worthless- ness of their contents for practical domestic purposes is no doubt the reason why there is still as great u demand as ever for a thoroughly reliable and up-to-date volume The little book 1 now offer to the public, claims to be the best, cheapest, and most useful Culinary Handbook yet produced, and I venture to think its contents will fully justify this assertion. A large proportion of the recipes are my own com- pilation, and all alike have been carefully revised and repeatedly tested. Every recipe has been arranged with a view to practical usefulness, and may be confidently recom- mended for ease of preparation, daintiness, and economy. Those who once use the “ Ideae Cookery Book," will afterwards use no other, not because their years haVe been shortened by bad cooking and unwholesome fofid, but bec^pse'thgy recognise in it all the qualities it claims to possess, afMvare able by its aid to realiseV.

If fruit is to be added do not make the cake very soft, or currants, &c., will be liable to sink, but they are less likely to do so if previously rubbed in flour. Always grease cake tins with lard as the cakes will be less liable to burn than if the tins are rubbed with butter. Do not open the oven door for at least twenty minutes after cakes are put in, and then do it very gently as a sudden action will tend to make a cake sink in the middle. i. Madeira Cake.

5i V. CAKES. A few hints about Cakes. Unless otherwise specified the general rule in making cakes is to cream the butter and sugar together, then add the eggs, then flour and baking powder (mix the baking powder with the flour) and then add fruit or other ingredients and beat well. If fruit is to be added do not make the cake very soft, or currants, &c., will be liable to sink, but they are less likely to do so if previously rubbed in flour. Always grease cake tins with lard as the cakes will be less liable to burn than if the tins are rubbed with butter. Do not open the oven door for at least twenty minutes after cakes are put in, and then do it very gently as a sudden action will tend to make a cake sink in the middle. i. Madeira Cake.

White Sauce. 2 tablespoonsful flour. 1 pint milk. Mix the flour with a little milk, and then add the rest of milk. Put in a pan and boil until it is the thickness required. Strain if necessary. This is used for fowls, rabbits, &c. 6. Mint Sauce. Chop some mint very finely, and place in a sauce-boat. Add a dessertspoonful of sugar, and enough vinegar to cover it well. Do not make this sauce long before it is required, as the mint will turn yellow. 7. Onion Sauce. Peel the onions, and boil till tender, squeeze the water from them and chop them. Add them to white sauce (recipe given), boil all up once and serve.

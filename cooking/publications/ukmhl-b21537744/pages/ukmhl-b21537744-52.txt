48 6o. Custard Pudding. Seat 2 eggs well and add them to i pint of milk and sweeten to taste, adding a little grated nutmeg. Place all in a dish and bake slowly for about an hour. Be careful not to let the mixture boil, or the pudding will not be quite so nice. 61. Stewed Pears. 8 large pears. 5-oz. loaf sugar. 6 cloves. J-pint water. Peel the pears, halve them, and remove the cores and leave the stalks on. Put them into a lined saucepan with the above ingredients, and let them simmer very gently until tender, which will be in 3 or 4 hours. As each one is done, carefully lift out without breaking on to a glass dish. Boil up the syrup 2 or 3 minutes, cool a little and pour over the pears. Add a few drops of cochineal to improve the colour. Do not let the fruit boil, but gently simmer. 62. Harrogate Pudding. Take about a pound of any kind of red fruit and stew it (with sugar to taste) in a pan until tender. Line a basin or mould with slices of bread about half-an- inch thick. Strain the fruit into the mould and cover with bread. Pour as much juice over the whole as will completely saturate the bread. Put a heavy plate on the top for at least 2 hours. Turn out on to a dish and pour any remaining juice round.

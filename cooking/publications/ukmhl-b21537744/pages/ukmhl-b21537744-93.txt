Take some cake tins and take out the bottoms and line with the warm paste, Three parts fill with minced pork and put a cover about 1 inch thick on the top. Make a hole in the centre and decorate. Place in a fairly hot oven and bake about 2 hours. Brush with yolk of egg just before they are cooked. When the pies are cold, pour into the hole in the top some gelatine, which has been previously dissolved in boiling water. If better pastry is required, add more lard, or use butter instead. 6. Recipe for Keeping Eggs. Take a large stew pot, or deep bowl, and put a layer of common salt in the bottom. Then insert a few eggs with the thin end downwards, and in such a way that they do not touch each other. Then put another layer of salt on the top, and repeat the process until the pot is full, having salt as the top layer. Tie down very tightly, and whenever an egg is taken out take care to tie down again. Be sure the eggs are fresh, and have not been much shaken, a^d they will keep good for months.

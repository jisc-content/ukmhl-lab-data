TABLE OF RULES FOR THE CONVERSION OF METRIC INTO BRITISH WEIGHTS. To convert grammes into grains.—Multiply by 154 ; cancel the last figure of the pro duct, the result is the true equivalent if the cancelled figure he taken as representing tenths of a grain. Thus 4 grammes equal 81'0 6 grains— 4 x 154 = 61-06. To convert grains into grammes.—Multiply by 65; place a period before the last three figures of the product, and read the figures on the left as grammes, those on the right as milligrammes. Thus 31 grains equal 2 grammes, '015 milligrammes— * 31 x 65 = 2-015. To convert cubic centimetres into fluid drachms.—Multiply by 28, and cut the two last figures off the product. Thus :— 100 X 28 = 28(00).

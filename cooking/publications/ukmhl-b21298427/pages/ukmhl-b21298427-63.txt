Take of common salt 8 parts, chloride of lime 3 parts; mix. Kreasote (Creosote). Dr. Ure remarks:—If we, in ope- rating upon pyroligneous acid, dissolve effloresced sulphate of soda in it to saturation, at the temperature of 267° Eahr., kreasote separates and floats upon the surface, it is then decanted and left in repose for some days, during which it deposits a fresh portion of salt ana vinegar; it is next saturated (while still hot) with potassa carbonate; it is now distilled along with a portion of water, a pale oily liquid passes over; this is rectified with phosphoric acid. Kreasote, if perfectly soluable in potash and acetic acid of the density T070, and if its colour be unaffected by exposure to atmospheric contact, may be considered as sufficiently pure for ordinary pharmaceutical purposes.

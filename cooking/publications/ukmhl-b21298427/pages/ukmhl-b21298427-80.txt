72 THE CHEMISTS AND Pap bath 4 parts of nitric acid of the sp. gr. T4, and 1 part of good brown sugar; as soon as the fumes cease to arise remove the heat, and set the acid aside to crys- tallize. By the above process 1 cwt. of sugar and 480 pounds by weight of nitric acid, should produce about 140 pounds of oxalic acid; the addition of a small portion of sulphuric acid is said to increase the product. A chemically pure oxalic acid for testing purposes may be obtained by precipitating a solution of binoxalate of potash with a solu- tion of acetate of lead, washing with distilled water, decomposing with dilute sulphuric acid, and evaporating to form crystals.

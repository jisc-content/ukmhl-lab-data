THE CHEMISTS AID DRUGGISTS’ COMPENDIUM. A. Abernethy’s Pills. Take of mercurial pill mass 36 grains, compound extract of colocynth 24 grains. Make into twelve pills. Acetic Acid [Liebig’s process). Take of acetate of soda pure, thoroughly dried and powdered, 3 parts, place this in a large glass retort, and pour over it 907 parts concen- trated pure sidphuric acid. A portion of the acetic acid is sent over by the heat engendered by the mixture of the ingre- dients. The heat of a sand-bath must now be applied, and the resulting distillate carefully rectified. Acetic Acid, Camphorated. Powder half an ounce of camphor with a few drops of spirits of wine : dissolve in 64 ounces of acetic acid. Acid Solution (Hollar's).

It is made as follows:—Take of rectified spirit of wine 3 parts, sulphuric acid 1 part, both by weight; mix. Aconitine (Liegois’ process). Macerate for eight days the coarsely powdered root in sufficient rectified spirit acidu- lated with sulphuric acid; express; distil off the greater part of the spirit and allow the liquor to cool. Remove from the surface the floating oil and resin, continue the evaporation till a syrupy consistency is obtained. Wash B

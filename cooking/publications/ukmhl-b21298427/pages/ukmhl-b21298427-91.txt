Take of nitric acid 3 fluid ounees, sulphuric acid 3 fluid ounces, best carded cotton a" sufficiency. The cotton wool should be pulled into light flat tufts, and spread ready for immersion. The acids are to be mixed in ajar standing in a deep dish of hot water; when the temperature of the acids is at 150° Pah., the cotton is to be immersed rapidly, a tuft at a time, each piece being pressed down in the solvent with a glass rod. The mass of cotton, at the end of ten minutes, is to be lifted by means of glass rods and plunged into cold water; stir the cotton through the water (which must be changed repeatedly) for a few hours, wring out, and separate the mass into light tufts for drying. It will be found to dissolve in the pro- portion of 5 grains to the ounce of a mixture of equal parts of ether and alcohol.

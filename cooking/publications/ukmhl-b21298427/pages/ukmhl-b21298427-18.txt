Commercial crystallised alumini- um sulphate, sulphuric acid, and potassium chlorate, in the proportion of one molecule of the two former to two of the latter, are mixed with water to the consistence of a thin paste, warmed for half an horn- on a water bath, allowed to cool completely, and treated with alcohol in excess. Upon filtering and neutralising with barium hydrate, barium sulphate, and some aluminium hydrate are precipitated, and barium chlorate remains in solution. The alcohol is distilled off", and the filtrate on evaporation yields crystals of pure barium chlorate. It must be observed that the aluminium sulphate and sulphuric acid are in slight excess.

PREPACE. want of sucli a work as the following manual is designed to be has long been very generally felt by Pharmaceutists; and therefore I trust any apology for this endeavour to supply that want will be unnecessary. Science makes her advances with such rapid and lengthy strides, that the acknowledged text book of to-day is to- morrow thrown aside as obsolete; and this is especially true in reference to the science-art of Pharmacy. The last few years have been productive of many useful improvements, many important inventions, and many startling discoveries, in «onnection with this art, which have yet no other record than the passing notice of the periodical Press. In compiling the following collection of Receipts and Processes in Pharmacy and its allied arts, I have therefore aimed at giving a special prominence to those of most recent date, but not to the exclusion of those which, though less novel, will not be considered less valuable. In all cases where I could proceed with certainty, I have given the names of the originators of the processes quoted. It is with pleasure that I acknowledge the valuable assistance I have derived from the works of Liebig, Watts, Muspratt, Ure, Squire, and A. J. Cooley; and also from the pages of the Pharmaceutical Journal, the Chemist and Druggist, the Chemical JVews, and the Specifications relating to Medicine, Surgery, Dentistry, Veterinary Preparations, &c. in the archives of Her Majesty’s Commissioners of Patents. Former experience assures me that this Work will meet with a favour proportionate to its merits ; but if it fulfils the object for which it is intended, viz., to economise the time, and to ease the labours of the practitioner of pharmacy, I shall consider my care well repaid.

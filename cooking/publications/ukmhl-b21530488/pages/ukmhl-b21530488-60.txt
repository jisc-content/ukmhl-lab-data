The next things is, to divide the breast from llie ciircase, by cutting tlirough the tender ribs, close to the breast, right down to the tail. Then lay the back upwards, put your knife into the bone half-way from the neck to the rump, and, on raising the lower end, it will separate rcauily. 'I'urn tlie rump from you, and very neat- ly take off the two sidesmen, and tlie whole will be done. As each part is tiken off, it should be turned neatly on the dish, and care should be taken iliat what is left gO(s properly from table. The breast and wings are looked upon as the best parts, but the legs are most juicy in young fowls. After all, more advan- tage will be gained by observing those who carve well, and a little practice, than by any written directions whatever. A Pheasant.—The bird in tlie annexed engraving is as trussed for the spit, with its head under one of its wings. W hen the skew- ers are taken out, and the bird served, the following is the way to carv e it;— Fix your fork in tlie cen- tre of the breast; slice it down in the lines o, b .- take off the leg on onseide in the dotted line 6, d : then cut oft' the wing on the same side, in the line c, d. Separate the leg and wing on the other side, and then cut oft' the slices of breast you divided be- fore. Be carelnl hovryou

DOMESTIC COOKKRV. 3U A baked Soup. Put a pound of any kind of meat cut in slices ; two onions, two carrots, ditto ; tw'o ounces of rice, a pint of split peas, or whole ones if previously soaked, pep- per and salt, into an earthen jug or pan, and pour one gallon of water. Cover it very close, and bake it with the bread. The cook should be charged to save the boiling of every piece of meat, ham, tongue, &c. however salt; as it is easy to use only a part of that, and the rest of fresh water, and, by the addition of more vegetables, the bones of the meat used in the family, the pieces of meat tliat come from table on the plates, and rice, Scotch barley, or oatmeal, there will be some gallons of nu- tritious soup two or three times a week. The bits of meat should be only warmed in the soup, and remain whole ; the bones, &c. boiled till they yield their nou- rishment. If the things are ready to put in the boiler as soon as the meat is served, it will save lighting fire, and second cooking. Take turnips, carrots, leeks, potatoes, the outer leaves of lettuce, celery, or any sort of vegetable that is at hand; cut them small, and throw in with the thick part of peas, after they have been pulped for soup, and grits, or coarse oatmeal, which have been used for gruel. Should the soup be poor of meat, the long boiling of the bones, and different vegetables, will afford better nourishment than the laborious poor can obtain ; espe- cially as they are rarely tolerable cooks, and have not fuel to do justice to what they buy. But in every fa- mily there is some superfluity ; and if it be prepared with cleanliness and care, the benefit will be very great to the receiver, and the satisfaction no less to the giver. 1 found, in the time of scarcity, ten or fifteen gallons of soup could be dealt out weekly, at an expense not worth mentioning, though the vegetables were bought.

A leg of pork, or of lamb, takes the full allowance of twenty minutes, above a quarter of an hour to a pound. In roasting, beef of ten pounds wilt take above two hours and a half; twenty pounds will take three hours and three quarters. A neck of mutton will take an hour and a half, if kept at a proper distance. A chine of pork, two hours. The meat should he put at a good distance from the fire, and brought gradually nearer when the inner part becomes hot, which will prevent its being scorched while j^t raw. Meat should he much basted; and whei;,ue.irly done, floured to make it look frothed. A eal and mutton should have a little paper put over the fat to preserve it. If not fat enough to allow for basting, .a little good dripping answers as well as butter. The cook should be careful not to run the spit through the best p.arts ; and should observe that it be well cleaned before and at the time of serving, or a black stain appears on the meat. In many Joints the spit w-ill pass into the bones, and run along them for some distance, so as not to injure the prime of the meat: and the cook should hare leaden skewers to balance it with; for want of which, ignorant servants are often troubled at the time of serving. In roasting meat i( is a very good way to put a little salt and water into the dripping-]>an, and h.aste for a little while with this, before using its own fat or drip- ping. When dry, dust it with flour, and baste as usual. Salting meat before it is put to roast draws out the gr.avy: it should only be sprinkled when almost done. lime, distance, basting often, and ^ clear fire of a proper size for what is required, are the first articles of a good cook’s attention in roasting. Old meats do not require so much dressing as young;

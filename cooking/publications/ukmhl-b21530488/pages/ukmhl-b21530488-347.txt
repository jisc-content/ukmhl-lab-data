WINES, &c. 275 . C^artf Wine. Boil fifteen gallons of water, with forty-five pounds of sugar, skira it, when cool put a little to a quarter of a pint of yeast, and so by degrees add a little more. In an hour pour the small quantity to the large, pour the liquor on clary-flowers, picked in the dry; the quan- tity for the above is twelve quarts. Those who gather from their own garden may not have sufficient to put in at once, and may add as they can get them, keeping account of each quart. When it ceases to hiss, and the flowers are all in, stop it up for four months. Rack it off, empty the barrel of the dregs, and adding a gallon of the best brandy, stop it up, and let it stand six or eight weeks, then bottle it. Jiorceilent Raisin Wine. To evei7 g.illon of spring water, put eight pounds of fresh Smyrnas in a large tub; stir it thoroughly every day for a month ; then press the raisins in a horse-hair bag, as dry as possible; put the liquor into a cask; and when it has done hissing, pour in a bottle of the best brandy; stop it close for twelve months; then rack it off, but without the dregs; filter them through a bag of flan- nel of three or four folds; add the clear to the quantity, and pour one or two quarts of brandy, according to the size of the vessel. Stop it up, and at the end of three years, you may either bottle it, or drink it from the cask. Raisin wine would be extremely good, if made rich of the fruit, and kept long, which improves the flavour greatly. Raistn Wine, utiiJt Cyder. Put two hundred weight of Malaga raisins into a cask, and pour upon them a hogshead of good sound cyder that is not rough; stir it well two or three days; stop it, and let it stand six months; then rack into a cask tliat it will fill, and put in a gallon of the best brandy.

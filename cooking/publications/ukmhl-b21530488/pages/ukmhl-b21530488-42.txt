xxxiv OBSERVATIONS FOR THB hope of raising their oSspring above their own situalitm be well-founded. The cultivation of the understanding and disposition, how- ever, is not here alluded tOj for a judicious Improvement of both, united to firm and early-taught religious principles, would enable the happy possessor of these advants^cs to act well on all occasions: nor would young ladies find domestic knowledges burthen, or inconsistent with higher attainments, if the rudiments of it were inculcated at a tender age, when activity is so pleasing. If employment be tiresome to a healthy child, the fault must be traced to habits which, from many cau- ses, are not at present favourable to the future conduct of wo- men. It frequently happens, that before impressions of duty are made on the mind, ornamental education commences; and It ever after takes the lead: thus, what should be only the embellishment, becomes the main business of life.

Were a young woman brought to relish home society, and the calm delights of agreeable occu- pation, before she entered into the delusive scenes of pleasure, presented by the theatre and other dissipations, it is probable she would soon make a comparison much in favour of the for- mer, especially if restraint did not give to the latter additional relish. If we carry on our observations to married life, we shall find a love of employment to be the source of unnumher^ plea- sures. To attend to the nursing, and at least early instruction of children, and rear a healthy progeny in the ways of piety and usefulness: to preside over the family and regulate the in- come allotted to its maintenance; to make home the sweet re- fuge of a husband fatigued by intercourse with a jarring world: to be his enlightened.companion and the chosen friend of his heart: these, these, are womanâ€™s duties I and delightful ones they are.

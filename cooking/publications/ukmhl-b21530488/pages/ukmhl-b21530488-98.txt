DOIIESTIC COOKERY. 26 Spotted, tlie meat is stale and bad. The kidney turns fir.st in the loin, and the suet will not then he firm. Alutton.—Choose this hy the fineness of its grain, good colour, and firm white fat. It is not the better for being young; if of a good breed and well fed, it is better for age; but this only holds with wether-mutton; the flesh of the ewe is paler, and the te.xture finer. Ram-mutton is very strong-flavoured, the flesh is of a deep red, and the fat is spongy. Lamb.—Observe the neck of a fore-quarter; if the vein is bluish, it is fresh ; if it has a green or yellow cast, it is stale. In the hind-quarter, if there is a faint smell under the kidney, and the knuckb is limp, the meat is stale. If the eyes are sunk, the head is not fresh. Grass-lamb comes into season in April or May, and continues till August. House-lamb may be had in gie.-it towns almost all the year, but is in highest per- fection in December and Januarv.

M'hen fresh, the flesh will be smooth and coo ; if clammy, it is tainted. What is called measlv pork IS very unwholesome; and may be known by the fat being full of kernels, which in good pork is never the case. Pork fed at still-houses does not answer foi curing any way, the fat being spongv. Dairy-fed pork is the best. " ‘ AWi.-If the rind is thin, the fat firm, and of a red tinge, the lean tender, of a good colour, and adhering to the bone, )-oii may conclude it good, and not old. If n7ty //r««.s.-Stick a sharp knife under the bone • if it comes out with a pleasant smell, the ham is good ; but It the knife is daubed and has a bad scent, do not buy

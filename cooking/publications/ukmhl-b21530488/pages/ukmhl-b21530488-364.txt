O()0 DOMESTIC COOKERY. aud by ibis atteulioii, and removing bad layers and care- less nurses, you will Lave a chance of a good stock. Let the hens lay some time before you set them, which should be done from the end of February to the begin- ning of May. While hens are laying, feed them well, and sometimes with oats. Broods of chickens are hatched all through the sum- mer, but those that come out very late require much care tiO they have gained some strength. If the eggs of any other sort are put under a hen with some of her own, observe to add her own as many days after the others, as there is a difference in the length of their sitting.

But hens must nut be disturbed while sitting; for if frightened, they sometimes forsake their nests. Wormwood and rue should be planted plentifully about their houses: boil some of the former, and sprin- kle it about the TToor; which should be of smooth earth, not paved.

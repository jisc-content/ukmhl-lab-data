PRESERVES. 245 To kerp Codlins far several months. Gather codlins at Midsummer of a middling size, put them into an earthen pan, pour boiling water over them, and cover the pan with cabbage-leaves. Keep them by the fire till they would peel, but don’t peel them; then pour the water off till both are quite cold. Place the codlins then in a stone jar with a smallish mouth, and pour on them the water that scalded them. Cover the pot with blad<ler wetted, and tied very close, and then over it coarse paper tied .again. It is best to keep them in small jars, such as will be used at once when opened.

Fill wide-mouthed bottles ; put the corks loosely in, and set the bottles up to the neck in water in a boiler. When the fruit looks scalded, take them out; and when perfectly cold, cork close, and rosin the top. Dig a trench in a part of the garden least used sufficiently deep for all the bottles to stand, and let the. earth be thrown over, to cover them a foot and a half. When a frost comes on, a little fresh litter from the stable will prevent the ground from hardening so that the fruit cannot be dug up. Or, scald as above; when cold, fill the bottles with cold water, cork them, and keep them in a damp or dry place; they will not be spoiled. Another roay.—In the size and preparation as above; when done, have boiling water ready, either in a boiler •or large kettle; and into it put as much roach-alum as will, when dissolved, harden the water, which you will taste by a little roughness ; if there be too much it will spoil the fruit. Put as many gooseberries into a large sieve as will lie at the bottom without covering one another. Hold the sieve in the water till the fruit be-

FISH. 3 They are caught in the Tliames and some other large rivers. ^Mullets.—Tile sea are preferred to the river mullets, and the red to the grey. They should be very firm.— Their season is August. ' Gudgeons.—They are chosen by the same rules as other fish. They are taken in running streams ; come in about midsummer, and are to be had for five or six months. Eels.—There is a greater difference in the goodness of eels than of any other fish. The true silver-eel (so called from the bright colour of the belly) is caught in the Thames. The Dutch eels sold at Billingsgate are very bad ; those taken iu great floods are generally good, but in ponds they have usually a strong rank flavour. Except the middle of summer, they are always in season. Lobsters.—If they have not been long taken, the claws will have a strong motion when you put your fin- ger on the eyes and press them. The heaviest are the best, and it is preferable to boil them at home. When you buy them ready-boiled, try whether their tails are stifif and pull up with a spring ; otherwise that part will be flabb3'. The oock lobster is known by the narrow back part of his tail, and the two uppermost fins within it are stiff and hard ; but those of the hen are soft, and the tail broader. The male, though generally smaller, has the highest flavour, the flesh is finner, and the colour when boiled is a deeper red. Crabs.—The heaviest are best, and those of a mid- . dling size are sweetest. If light they are watery; when in perfection the joints of the legs are stiff, and the body lias a very agreeable smell. The eyes look dead and loose when stale. Prawns and Skrmps.—When fresh they have a sweet flavour, are firm and stiff, and the colour is bright.—

MUTTON. 79 To roll Loin of Mutton. Hang the mutton till tender; bone it; and lay a sea- soning of pepper, allspice, mace, nutmeg, and a few cloves, all in tine powder, over it. Next day prepare a stuffing as for hare; beat the meat, and cover it with the stuffing; roll it up tight, and tie it. Half-bake it in a slow oven; let it grow cold; take off the fat, and put the gravy into a stew-pan; flour the meat, and put it in likewise; stew it till almost ready; and add a glass of port wine, some ketchup, an anchovy, and a little lemon- pickle, half an^hour before serving; serve it in the gravy, and with jelly-sauce. A few fresh mushrooms are a great improvement; but if to eat like hare, do not use these nor the lemon-pickle. Mutton Ham. Choose a fine grained leg of wether-mutton, of twelve or fourteen pounds weight; let it be cut ham-shape, and hang two days. Then put into a stew-pan half a pound of bay-salt, the same of common salt, two ounces of saltpetre, and half a pound of coarse sugar, all in pow- der; mix, and make it quite hot; then rub it well into the ham. Let it be turned in the liquor every day; at the end of four days put two ounces more of common salt; in twelve days take it out, dry it, and hang it up in wood-smoke, a week. It is to be used in slices with stewed cabbage, mashed potatoes, or eggs. Mutton Collops. Take a loin of mutton that has been well bung; and cut from the part next the leg, some collops very thin. Take out the sinews. Season the collops with salt, pep- per, and mace; and strew over them shred parsley, thyme, and two or three shalots: fry them in butter till half-done; add half a pint of gravy, a little juice of le- mon, and a piece of butter rubbed in flour; and simmer the whole very gently five minutes. They should bo served immediately, or they will be hard.

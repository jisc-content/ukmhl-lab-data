An ounce of black pepper, and the same quantity of allspice, in fine pow- der, added to the above, will give still more flavour. Cover it with bran when wiped: and smoko it from three to four weeks, as you approve ; the latter will make it harder and give it more of the tlavour of West- phalia. Sew hams in hessings (that is, coarse wrap- pers,) if to be smoked where there is a strong fire. A method of giving a still higher favour.—Sprinkle the ham with salt, after it has hung two or three days; let it drain; make a pickle of a quart of strong beer, half a pound Of treacle, an ounce of coriander seeds, two ounces of juniper-berries, an ounce of pepper, the same quantity of allspice, an ounce of saltpetre, half an ounce of sal-prunel, a handful of common salt, and a head of shalot, all pounded or cut fine. Boil these all together a few minutes, and pour them over the ham: this quan- tity is for one of ten pounds.

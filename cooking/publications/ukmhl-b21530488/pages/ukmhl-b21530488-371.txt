SICK COOKKaT, 299 PART XII. COOKKRY FOR THE SICK, AND FOR THE POOR. SICK COOKERY. General Remarks. The following pages will contain cookery for the sick; it being of more consequence to support those whose bad .appetite will not allow them to take the necessary nou- rishment, than to stimulate that of persons in health. It may not be unnecessary to advise that a choice be made of the things most likely to agree with the patient; that a change be provided ; that some one at least be always ready; that not too much of those be made at once, which are not likely to keep, as invalids require variety ; and that they should succeeil each other m dif- ferent forms and flavours. A dear Broth that will keep long. Put the mouse round of beef, a knuckle bone of veal, and a few shanks of mutton, into a deep pan, and cover close with a dish or coarse crust; bake till the beef is done enough for eating, with onl> as much water as will cover. When cold, cover it close in a cool place. AVHien to be used, give what flavour may be approved. A quick made Drotlt. Take a bone or two of a neck or loin of mutton, take off the fat and skin, set it on the fire in a small tin sauce- pan that has a cover, with three quarters of a pint of water, the meat being first beaten, and cut in thin bits; put a bit of thyme and parsley, and, if approved, a slice of onion. Let it boil very quick, skim it nicely, take off the cover, if likely to be too weak ; else cove- it. Half an hour U sufficient for the whole process.

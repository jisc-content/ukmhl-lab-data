24 DOMESTIC COOKERY, Oyster Loaves. Open them, and save the liquor; wash them in it; then strain it through a sieve, and put a little of it into a tosser, with a bit of butter and hour, white pepper, a scrape of nutmeg, and a little cream. Stew them, and cut in dice; put them into rolls sold for the purpose. Oyster Patties. See Patties. To pickle Oysters. Wash four dozen of the largest oysters you can get in their own liquor, wipe them dry, strain the liquor off, adding to it a desert-spoonful of pepper, two blades of mace, a table-spoonful of salt, if the liquor be not very salt, three of white wine, and four of vinegar.—Simmer the oysters a few minutes in the liquor, then put them in small jars, and boil the pickle up, skim it, and when cold, pour over the oysters: cover close. Another way to pickle Oysters. Open the number you intend to pickle, put them into A sauce-pan with their own liquor for ten minutes, sim- mer them very gently; then put them into a jar, one by one, that none of the grit may stick to them, and cover them when cold with the pickle thus made.—Boil the liquor with a bit of mace, lemon-peel, and black pep- pers, and to every hundred put two spoonfuls of the best undistilled vinegar. They should be kept in small jars, and tied close with bladder, for the air will spoil them. Note.—Directions for making Fish Pies will be. fourul under the head Pies.

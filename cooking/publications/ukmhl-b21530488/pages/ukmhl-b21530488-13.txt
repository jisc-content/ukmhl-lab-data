As the following directions were intended for the conduct of the families of the Authoressâ€™s own daugh- ters, and for the arrangement of their table, so as to unite a good figure with proper economy, she has avoided all excessive luxury, such as essence of ham, and that wasteful expenditure of large quantities of meat for gravy, which so greatly contributes to keep up the price, and is no less injurious to those who eat, than to those whose penury obliges them to abstain. Many receipts are given for things, which being in daily use, the mode of preparing them may be supposed too well known to require a place in a cookery-book ; yet how rarely do we meet with fine melted butter, good toast and water, or well-made coffee !

In that expecta- tion it is given to the Public; and as she will receive from it no emolument, so she trusts it will escape with- out censure.

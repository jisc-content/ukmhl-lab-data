Gra'^ for it should be put into a boat, and not into the dish (unless there is none in the venison,) and made thus: Cut off the fat from two or three pounds of a loin of old mutton, and set in steaks on a gridiron for a few minutes just to brown one side; put them into a sauce-pan with a quart of water, cover quite close for an hour, and simmer it gently ; then uncover it, and stew till the gravy is reduced to a pint.

Grate white bread, and boil it with port wine, water, and a large stick of cinnamon; and when quite smooth take out the cinnamon and add sugar. Claret may be used for it. Make the jelly-sauce thus.

Set it in a stew-pan that will only just hold it, with some mutton of beef gravy not strong, half a pint ot port wine, and some pepper and allspice. Simmer

ON THE EXTRAVAGANT USE OF 46 they are equally faulty with ours in allowing a great deal of heat to be lost by radiation. In some parts of America and in Canada this is probably not regarded as a matter of any moment, because the coldness of the climate renders such a stove useful for the purpose of warmth ; but it is a question whether it would not he invariably preferable to disregard the question of warmth, and to construct a cooking apparatus on the most economical system for cooking only, leaving the provision for warming to be given by other means when really required. Upon this point European practice is generally defective. Figs. 45 and 46 represent cooking stoves of Norwegian manu- facture, which resemble the American in system so far as being closed, but they have not the same striking origi- nality. Gas Cooking Stoves. A few years since many persons entertained the idea that the gas in use for lighting would become a substitute for coal in the preparation of food, but their expectation is very far from having been realized. There was some- thing novel and striking in the idea of one being able to obtain a supply of heat instantaneously, merely by apply- ing a match, and of discontinuing the heat as suddenly by turning a tap. Gas was used in ovens for cooking joints and baking, a row of gas jets being provided all round the bottom, with hooks or shelves to carry the joints, and dripping-pans below. Gas was also made to burn in a sheet of flame for broiling or toasting, and it might have succeeded in supplanting coal to an enormous extent if there had not been an insuperable difficulty, and that was the expense. Let those who are partially dis- posed say what they may, carburetted hydrogen gas used for heat, cannot for a moment compare in economy with

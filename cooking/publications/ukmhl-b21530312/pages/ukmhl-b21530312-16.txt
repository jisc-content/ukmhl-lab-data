2 ON THE EXTRAVAGANT USE OF not to be squandered, and the conveniences which are provided for using it are consequently such as to render our reckless waste absolutely impossible. We have in- deed had instruction very near at hand; and if we have not hitherto profited by it, and have offered no encourage- ment to any one desirous of reforming our habits, this has probably arisen from a want of interest on a subject that is not understood, and from our extreme unreadiness to emancipate ourselves from a custom which a long course of years, or which centuries have engrained.

This was one whom Gibbon called “ the soldier, philosopher, and states- man, Thompson,” but who will be remembered as the economist, philanthropist, and man of science, Benjamin Thompson, Count of Rumford. In Munich, Count Rum- ford was able to prepare a substantial soup dinner for a thousand poor persons at a cost of fourpence-halfpenny for fuel.

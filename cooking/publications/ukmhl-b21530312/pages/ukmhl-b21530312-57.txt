43 FUEL IN COOKING. in the modes of heating the ovens, boiler, and hot-plate; and if such a system may appeal successfully to the under- standing, either of the reader who considers the sub- ject for the first time, or of those whose occupation makes them familiar with the details of existing practice, it can hardly appear doubtful that the particular amelioiations here described ought gradually to become adopted, and the present imperfect methods fall into utter disuse. A further direction in which economy may be effected is by the partial adoption of Count Rumford s system of using several fire-places, each small, and constructed to be used very economically. Any such system as that shown in Fig. 1 requires an advocate possessing a peculiar amount of enthusiasm ; but if servants would not tolerate it, it may nevertheless be perfectly practicable to apply the principle within lesser limits. In Fig. 42, for instance, is shown a system by which the two ovens on the left may be prepared for roasting or baking, by means of a small fire made specially beneath the lower one, the other fire- place being used for constant purposes. This allows of the regular fire-place being smaller, and therefore of con- suming constantly less coal than when it must be of suffi- cient capacity for heating the ovens as well as the hot- plate and boiler. The boiler in this case is imbedded behind the tiles on the right, and is supposed to be heated by the surplus heat which escapes from the fire along the flues of the hot plate. In Fig. 43 is another adaptation of the principle, where the fire in the centre is used primarily to heat the hot-plate, and to give heat to the hot closets below it, and in which sufficient surplus heat is provided to warm the ovens on the left, and to heat the water in the boiler sufficient for common pur- poses, which may be to 150 degrees. If the ovens were actually required for baking or roasting, and if the water

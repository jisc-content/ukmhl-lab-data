26 ON THE EXTRAVAGANT USE OF water run off occasionally. A waste steam-pipe provided with a safety-valve is made to pass from the top of the boiler into the chimney, that the steam may escape as soon as it has attained anything beyond a very low pressure. Most frequently cooking by steam is avoided, and the boiler is then perhaps, devoted to another purpose, gene- rally considered of greater importance, viz. the providing a large quantity of hot water for use in a warm bath, and for general household purposes. As comparatively few persons beyond those whose business it is to understand such matters know what the simple process is by which large-quantites of hot water are provided at a considerable distance from a fire, a short description of it may not be without its use. In the first place the boiler, which may be anywhere, but for convenienceâ€™ sake is often the one attached to the kitchen apparatus, is made perfectly close, the cover being firmly cemented and fastened, and never removed except for the purpose of cleaning the boiler. There are two round holes made in the boiler, one in the top, the other at or near to the bottom, and to these holes pipes are attached, which ascend in some convenient way to the ceiling of the chamber, and thence to a cistern, made generally of sufficient capacity to hold from seventy to two hundred gallons of water, and which is fixed in some convenient position in the floor above, or on an upper story. The pipe which passes from the top of the boiler, is called the ascending circulating pipe; the pipe which returns from the cistern to the bottom of the boilei is called the descending circulating pipe, and the cistern is called the liot-water circulating cistern. The cistern, pipes, and boiler, are kept supplied with water fiom a cold water cistern which is necessarily provided on a somewhat higher level and a small regulating cistern furnished with a ball tap and fixed contiguous to the hot-water cistern,

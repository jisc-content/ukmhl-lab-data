fuel in cooking. 41 bricks, with a certain number of metal rings and covers arranged in two rows. The heat of the fire is supposed to pass in separate currents under the whole of these covers, instead of under the whole surface of a metal plate as at present, and it only becomes necessary to have cooking utensils to fit the various apertures, or apertures to fit the cooking utensils, for a portion of Count Rumfordâ€™s most valuable teaching to be at once adapted for modern use. By removing a metal cover, a utensil can be im- mersed at once in the hot air, and if a double cover for the vessel itself be used, such as Count Rumford recom- mended, and if proper arrangements be made for com- pelling the hot air to pass under the bottom of the vessel and around the body of it, as indicated in the section Fig. 40, it will be heated by a careful and economical method, and allow exceedingly little heat to be given into the kitchen, instead of by the present crude system of simply standing the vessel on a hot iron plate, which, besides communicating the heat indirectly, allows both hot-plate surface and cooking utensil to radiate heat con- stantly to waste. If only a little heat should be wanted, the vessel would be placed upon a hot metal cover instead of being immersed in the hot air, and if it be considered that the number of covers represent as many vessels as could be used at one time, it appears inevitable that the substitution of such a system for the hot-plate, would simply be largely represented by coal in the cellar instead of coal in the fire. By the adoption of such a system, with the other modifications already suggested, the general use of a fire of smaller dimensions would of course become indispensable.

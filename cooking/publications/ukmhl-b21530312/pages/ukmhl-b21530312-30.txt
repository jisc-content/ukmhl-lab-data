16 ON THE EXTRAVAGANT USE OF from whichever of the three happened to be in use; and whenever it was required to raise the water to the boiling point the burning of a few chips of wood or a small quantity of coal in a fire-place arranged below the boiler was found to suffice for that purpose. Fig. 6 shows a vertical section of one of the fire-places containing a large vessel, and Figs. 4 and 5 show the fire pot and grate, Fig. 7 shows a horizontal section of the brickwork containing thirteen small fire-places with the branch flue from each, the boiler on the left, and the four vertical flues; and Fig. 8 gives a perspective view from above, with a section of the vertical flues. It requires a careful consideration of this most original system to see clearly what is the nature and exact extent of its intrinsic merits. The aspect of a number of cooking utensils, each with its distinct fire-place, and a separate convenience for roasting, is certainly a curious one, but a little consideration will suffice to show that the system was very different in actual practice to what it may appear at first sight. Under ordinary circumstances, one, two or three fire-places only would be used, whether for boiling water, for stewing, for preparing soup, or for cooking by steam, and these fire-places would of course be those situated on the left side, the heat escaping from which along the flues would be used to heat the water in the boiler behind. If but little cooking were wanted, but one small fire only would be lighted. This would be used first for boiling water, and subsequently for cooking. When the demands became greater, another fire could be lighted, and so on, the three fire-places communicating with the boiler being in all probability as much as was generally required for family use. If a large quantity of hot water was wanted this was obtained b) supplementing the waste heat from the cooking utensils by a small fire

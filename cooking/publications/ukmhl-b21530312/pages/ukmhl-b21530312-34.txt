20 ON THE EXTRAVAGANT USE OF The mode Count Rumford adopted of using the roaster, was as follows. It was first prepared for use by means of a gentle fire. The water-dish was inserted with the metal grate and joint upon it, and during the operation of cooking, the oven door was opened three or four times for the purpose of basting or turning the joint, and the damper in the steam tube was opened just suffi- cient to let the steam escape. A quarter of an hour before the joint was ready for the table, the blow-pipes were opened, and the steam-tube was opened as wide as pos- sible. A brisk fire was then made by adding a few pieces of wood. The blow-pipes became exceedingly hot, and a rush of very hot air into the roaster, rapidly browned the surface of the joint, and made it in appearance, all that could possibly be desired. Count Rumford found that by this process, a joint of meat weighed more when cooked, that it tasted of better quality, and that the rejected por- tions were much less in quantity than when prepared under the more exhaustive process of the open fire. Figs. 17 and 18, shows the roaster as it was fixed with the face of it level with the wall, and with certain arrange- ments for economising the heat. The fire-place is shown at some little distance below the bottom of the roaster, the object of the precaution being to prevent the iron- work from becoming quickly destroyed. The heat from the fire passed round each side of the roaster to the top and down the back, by means of a flue, to some distance below the bottom and then into the chimney, the object of the descending current being both to heat the back of the roaster and to check the escape of the hot air. The door was either made double, or with a wooden face to it for the purpose of confining the heat. For large establishments, two, three, or four roasting ovens were provided, all of which were heated by a single fire.

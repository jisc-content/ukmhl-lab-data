23 FUEL IN COOKING. resist tramways, and resisted railways, and every other innovation upon the prevailing practices of the time as long as the new systems had not become generally under- stood and appreciated. It may be most useful in this chapter, not to attempt any elaborate arguments in favor of the closed fire, but to examine the present me- thods in use, and to indicate what is the nature of the improvements that could probably be effected without violently disturbing existing usage. Fig. 19 represents the most common sort of open kitchen range used in the Home Counties of England, in which the large fire is used to roast and boil, a boiler placed at the back and on one side of the fire, is used to supply hot water, a winding cheek is used to expand or contract the fire-place as desired, and an oven is provided for baking. The mode of heating this oven is peculiar. A thick lump of iron is cast upon one side of it, as shown in Fig. 20. The fire lies against this lump, and against the side of the oven, and the flame of the fire in playing over the side of the oven and around the lump heats those parts considerably, and the whole of the oven becomes fairly but rather unequally heated on the prin- ciple of conduction. Fig. 21 represents a kitchen range of a much better kind, in which a current of hot air from the fire is allowed to pass round the oven to the bottom, to spread below the oven, and thence escape to the chimney by a flue arranged behind, as shown in Fig. 22. Fig. 23 represents an arrangement for a large family, of which it may be said, that it is eminently in accordance with some old-fashioned English notions of plentifulness and cheerfulness. There is the large open range with smoke- jack and spit; a boiler with a flue underneath it, heated by a current of hot air from the immense fire ; a separate

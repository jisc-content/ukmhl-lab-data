36 ON THE EXTRAVAGANT USE OF consuming principle by furnishing a receptacle to contain coal for the day’s supply, making a fire on the top and raising the fuel from below to be gradually consumed, on exactly the same principle as by the Cutler’s and Arnott’s grates, with which the public have of late years been familiar. The moderately and steadily burning fire of great heating power, which is never cooled by a quantity of fresh fuel being thrown on the top to smother it for a time, and which, compared with the ordinary means of using coal, is not productive of smoke and soot, affords peculiar means of adding to strict economy and conve- nience. This fire may of course he open or closed at pleasure. The brick bottom becomes superfluous.

Nevertheless, the advantages of the system were fully recognised by all who took any interest in the matter, and though the principle has been left for some years in abeyance, it is one that should unquestion- ably be revived. There is no difficulty whatever in the very simple machinery being brought to such a degree of perfection, that any shadow of an objection would be removed, and, as our servant-maids have succeeded in becoming accustomed to the use of the kitchener within a few years, it would surely be unreasonable to despair of their adapting themselves to a new method of supply- ing the fuel.

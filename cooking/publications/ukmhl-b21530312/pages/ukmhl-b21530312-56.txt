42 ON THE EXTRAVAGANT USE OF On other Means of improving the Kitchener. It now remains to be considered whether or not there is any further suggestion that could be made for rendering the kitchener a more economical and generally acceptable article of daily use. The suggestions already considered relating to the ventilation, the improvement of the fire- place, by making it less deep, by using a brick bottom and a closed door, by using a slow-combustion principle, or by adopting the principle of preventing smoke on the well- known plan of lighting a fire at the top of a body of coal, and raising fresh fuel from below; the improved method of heating the hot-plate and oven, by raising the oven, so that the bottom of it may be about on a level with the hot-plate ; the use of double doors to the ovens, or of doors lined with white glazed tiles for confining the heat, and, lastly, the substitution for the hot-plate of a system by which the various cooking utensils, protected by double covers, could be actually immersed in the hot currents of air which pass from the fireâ€”these suggestions appear to be unquestionably calculated to transform the kitchener, in a great measure, from a dashing and improvident ser- vant into one that bears some evidence of possessing a regard for economy and care ; and if another suggestion may deserve equal prominence, it is, that as much as possible of the heated metal surface should be discarded, and be substituted by glazed bricks, or by brickwork covered with glazed tiles. In Figs. 34 to 41, the various suggestions which have been made are supposed to be combined. Figs. 38 and 41 show two fire-places, the first on a small, the second on a much larger scale, in both of which heated metal is rejected as much as possible, and a tile surface substituted. The fire may be open or not at pleasure; economy is strictly provided for

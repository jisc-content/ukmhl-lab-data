FUEL IN COOKING. 47 the solid fuel from which that gas is made. It is not a question of comparing coal used extravagantly and gas used economically. Both should be used with care if a proper comparison is to be made. But even with our extravagant method of using coal, gas has not held its ground, and this is due not merely to the expense incurred in producing the gas, but to the fact that the rejected part of the coal used in making the gas, is exactly that from which we obtain nearly all our heat, viz. the carbon which the gas companies leave in the form of coke. When the ingenuity of man can succeed in readily converting a whole body of coal into inflammable gas, we may enter- tain the hope of such gas competing successfully with the coal itself, but probably not otherwise. Gas is used to some extent for cooking in many large establishments, and in some hotels, dining-rooms and clubs. Chops and steaks are sometimes broiled over rows of gas jets instead of over a common fire, and, for family use, gas has some- times been introduced to supersede the use of charcoal stoves by some such arrangement as is shown in Fig. 47. The author has alluded to this and other matters from a desire to make his information as complete as possible, and he only trusts that some substantial good may result from his attempt to awaken interest in this much neglec- ted department of domestic economy.

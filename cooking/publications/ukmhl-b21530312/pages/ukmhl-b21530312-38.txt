24 ON THE EXTRAVAGANT USE OF arrangement of ovens, the fire for which, being close, may easily be economical; a hot-plate heated by a closed fire, and some small separate fire-places for burning charcoal. What a different world this would be, if the plentifulness of which such a sketch is significative pervaded every coun- try upon it! These open ranges have long been giving way in favor of the “ kitchener ” principle, which may be supposed to unite the advantages of the open range and hot-plate, and which is particularly valuable from its reproducing some of the suggestions strongly urged by Count Rumford. Fig. 24 represents a kitchener of the most simple con- struction. The top forms a hot-plate, an oven is on one side, and a boiler on the other. The fire-place above the kitchener is fitted round with glazed tiles, and an iron frame fixed across, called a plate-rack, adds to the general convenience. Higher up, the chimney is closed, but it is provided with a door, which is opened on certain occa- sions. The mode of heating the oven is the same as in Fig. 22, viz. by a current of air from the fire passing round it and up the back, as shown in the section, Fig. 25. Count Rumford’s roasting-dish, Fig. 14, is used. A pro- vision is made to let vapor escape from the oven by an open- ing in the top of the oven, which is regulated by a small handle, and fresh air is allowed to enter the oven through a tube below it, or through two or three small slits near the bottom of the oven door. The boiler is sometimes heated in the same way as the oven, viz. by a current of hot air from the fire passing round it and up the back, in which case the whole of the top metal surface of the kitchener forms a “ hot-plate ” for cooking. In other cases, the boiler is heated differently. It is made to inclose the fire behind and on one side, as shown in Fig. 26. The flue is dispensed with, and the top of the boiler

44 ON THE EXTRAVAGANT USE OF in the capacious boiler were required to be boiling hot, small fires made underneath the ovens and the boiler would most rapidly give all that was required, and, when the requirement ceased, the fires would of course be allowed to cease also. Particular regard deserves to be paid to this system, for there can be no doubt that the use of one principal and of two supplementary fires affords great scope for economy over anything that can be effected when a single fire is used capable of acting for all pur- poses. In the preceding suggestions as much has probably been advanced in the way of improvement as need satisfy the most exacting, and certainly as much as is likely to find extensive acceptance at the present period. That the suggestions are valuable, and would lead, if properly adopted, to nothing less than a reduction of our con- sumption to a third, or perhaps even a fourth of what it now is, is not only perfectly true, but the fact is one which should excite no surprise. Our present kitchen fire-places are so abominably wasteful—far worse to everyone’s know- ledge than our means of warming by open grates or by other contrivances—that it only requires for the various sources of waste to be clearly pointed out, together with the evident means of avoiding them, for the truth to be made clear. That even more could, under certain circum- stances, be accomplished, and that Count Rumford actually did accomplish more, there can be no doubt; but in small things as in great, no real progress is made except by degrees, and whatever may be accomplished at the present time, it cannot but be that a further advance will one day be possible, when economy in fuel is more scrupulously considered, and when the homes where our domestic ser- vants receive their early training are bettei fitted to develop their industry, truthfulness, and intelligent care.

ON THE EXTRAVAGANT USE OF 18 conclusion that no less than nine-tenths of the fuel com- monly consumed could be saved. And truly, compared with Count Rumford’s careful and artistic system, our present common methods appear very much like throwing a pail of water to fill a tea-cup. In the various public establishments where Count Rumford’s system became adopted, there were certain modifications relating particularly to the boiling of water, and the preparation of soup in large quantities, particulars of which are given in his essays. In Figs. 9, 10 and 11 is shown an outline of his arrangements at the House of Correction, and Military Academy at Munich. Figs. 12 and 13 give sketches of other useful cooking utensils in- troduced by Count Rumford, and Figs. 14 to 18 are given to explain his system of roasting meat in ovens which did not succeed at that time in overcoming prejudice in England, but which now possesses particular interest from its having become generally understood, and adopted some fifty years after his death. The Count’s antagonism to the open range was heightened when he contemplated the smoke-jack, which he considered upon economical grounds, to be a most preposterous contrivance. He thought an open fire was wasteful and objectionable enough in any case, but the idea of a fire being made of extra power for the express purpose of sending much heated air up the chimney, so that the current might turn the wheel of the jack, that the wheel might turn the loaded spit in front of the fire, appeared to him the climax of absurdity, especially when he reflected that a piece of machinery, on the principle of the clock, constructed to be wound up occasionally, as in the bottle-jack at present in use, would effect all that was required. It was a chance circumstance at Munich, which revealed to him the possibility of meat being cooked in an oven without the disagreeable flavor,

15 FUEL IN COOKING. another door, termed a stopper, was provided, through which fuel could be introduced to the fire-place. To the smaller utensils this convenience for supplying fuel was not provided, and the operation was performed from above on temporarily removing the utensil for that purpose. In every fire-place there was a small flue, which compelled the smoke and heat to pass round every portion of the utensil before their escape, and their exit was further checked by a damper in the escape flue, which was regulated so as to allow no heat to pass away as long as it could be safely retained. The utensil became in fact immersed in a sort of hot air bath; and to complete the arrangement, each cover was made double, with a hollow space between the two parts filled with air, which, acting as a non-conductor, most materially checked the escape of heat. By another device, an extra cover of wood, was carefully constructed and attached to the metal one. A small tube passing vertically through the middle of the cover afforded means, when necessary, for the escape of steam. A cooking utensil with its double cover is shown in the figures 2 and 3. The flues from the different utensils passed hori- zontally into four main vertical flues formed in the brick- work at back, by which the smoke escaped finally into the chimney. Above the brickwork, and in the centre of it, against the wall, was a hearth on which a fire could be made when required. For roasting, two roasting ovens were built in the wall to the right of the projecting brickwork. Both ovens were heated by one fire, which of course was never kept alight more than was absolutely necessary. For hot water a boiler was provided within the body of brickwork itself, on the left side behind, as shown in the figures 1, 7, and 8. This was heated by the smoke and hot air which escaped from the three fire-places nearest to it, or

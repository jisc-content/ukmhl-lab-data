FUEL IN COOKING. 25 appears to be an actual part of the hot-plate. There, is a great advantage in this system, for the only current of air from the fire is that used for heating the oven, and not only is the boiler sufficiently heated by mere contact with the fire on two sides, but it is readily capable of supplying steam if necessary for cooking, no further provision being required than a properly-constructed tin steam-kettle, which is simply placed over the boiler, on the boiler cover being removed. The arrangement is a more economical one than that of heating the boiler by a flue; but there is a certain loss of hot-plate surface, a matter of no mo- ment in many small families. Fig. 27 represents a kitchener on a larger scale with an oven on each side, both heated by currents of hot air passing round them as already described, and a boiler behind the fire heated by a third current of hot air, pass- ing from the fire directly underneath the boiler, and up the back of it into the chimney. The arrangement of flues for the ovens and boiler with the means for checking the escape of the hot air, are shown in the figures 28 to 32. The boiler in this case when constructed of the shape shown in the section Fig. 32, is competent to pro- vide steam for cooking. Two or three steam-kettles are fixed in some contiguous position, and a pipe passing from the top of the boiler supplies the steam to them as desired, admission being given by means of a metal tap. Very frequently a hot cupboard, constructed of tin or iron, is also heated by steam, and is put below the kettles as shown to the left in Fig. 23. The cupboard is made double. The steam passes between the inner and outer case, and along the hollow part of the shelf, and, as it condenses, it escapes by a pipe provided from the bottom of the cup- board, into a neighbouring drain; or a tap is sometimes provided below the cupboard for the purpose of letting the

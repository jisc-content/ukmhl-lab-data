FUEL IN COOKING. 37 kitchener have invariably been put below the hot-plate, and a current of air from the fire passing between the oven and hot-plate, has been designed to heat both, as shown by the sections Figs. 25 and 28. This current of air is made then to descend against the outer side of the oven, and to pass underneath it, there to spread and to escape by a flue arranged behind the oven into the chimney. Waste of fuel and an absence of efficiency result from this arrangement. The descent of air for the purpose of heat- ing the oven causes the fire to cling, as it were, to the top of the oven in its passage from the fire, and to heat the hot- plate insufficiently, unless a fire is made of considerable power. The oven, too, is found to be hotter at top than at the bottom. An attempt has been made to rectify the inconvenience by a more complicated system of flues, a description of which would probably be considered too technical for this essay, but a preferable method, wherever it can be adopted, is for the ovens to be situated above the hot-plate, and one on each side of it, as shown in Figs. 38 and 41. The current of hot air from the fire passes then under the hot-plate, under the oven, up each side of the oven, over the top of it, and it should also be advantageously made to descend behind it before escaping into the chimney, for the purpose of heating the back of the oven, and checking the rapid escape of the hot air, as in the system adopted by Count Rumford for heating his roaster, shown in Fig. 17. When the size of a fire- place does not present sufficient width for the hot-plate and for the oven or ovens placed above it, the old system must necessarily be adopted. The oven might further be improved by the adoption of Count Rumfordâ€™s admirable system of using a double door with an empty space between the two parts, the inner and outer plate being separated when fastened together by

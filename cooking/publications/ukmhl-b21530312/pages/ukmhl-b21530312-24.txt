ON THE EXTRAVAGANT USE OF 10 Protestant,’’ and how, five years later, when he was lying dangerously ill at Naples, a number of the poor set apart, of their own accord, an hour each evening to pray for him, after they had finished their work at the Military Work- house ; and further, how, after an absence of fifteen months, he gave a fete in the English garden to eighteen hundred poor persons, at which thirty thousand of the inhabitants of Munich were said to have been present. Soon after this last event he was created a Count, the name to his title being taken from the remote province of his birth. In 1796, he had the difficulty of maintaining peace when Europe was all in arms, and two years later he was deputed ambassador to London. This position, it was found, could not be held by a British subject, and his friend and benefactor, the elector, dying just at that period, Count Rumford foresaw what his altered position would be in the Bavarian Court, and he returned to Munich only to arrange certain private and public affairs. He then settled in London for some years, with the express object of publishing his essays and introducing the econo- mical methods of preparing food, with which he had become so familiar during his singular investigations and experience. His connection with the Royal Society and the Royal Institution gave him opportunities to read papers relating to his researches, and influence and authority for introducing his novel schemes, tie published essays relating to his different undertakings at Munich, and soon introduced his arrangements for cooking at the Foundling Hospital, where he succeeded in roasting a hundred and twelve pounds of meat in ovens at a cost of fourpence. He also introduced them in the kitchen of the Royal Institution, and in the Heriot Hospital, Edin- burgh. His successes in this country, however, chiefly concerned the management of fuel in private dwellings.

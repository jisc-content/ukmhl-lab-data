11 fuel in cooking. Against the old English kitchen range, he set himself most strongly, remarking that more fuel was frequently consumed in it to boil a tea-kettle than with pioper management would suffice to cook a dinner for fifty men, and he proposed therefore to substitute for our national mode of roasting, a system of cooking joints in ovens, which he had perfected in Bavaria. This system he con- sidered to furnish a superior means of roasting, irrespec- tive of the question of economy, and he overcame prejudice sufficiently to introduce several hundreds of his roasters for private use. They have now long been forgotten, but the system he adopted has been revived of late years, and become used in all the modern kitcheners, though hardly a person is to be found who knows that Count Rumford was its originator. The Count introduced many articles of striking utility for cooking by the poor, and he particu- larly turned his attention to the improvement of the large open fire-places, uncomfortable for warmth and prolific in smoke, which were then universal in this country. One of his essays was devoted to this subject, and it was upon this that he naturally met with the fullest success. In the kitchen he had to argue in favour of economy and scientific methods, and found few that took any intelligent interest; but in the question of warming apartments, personal comfort was concerned, and the Count gained assistance in his efforts from the smoke and want of warmth with which his listeners or readers were often un- pleasantly familiar. Though he took no patents for his contrivances, and his efforts were entirely gratuitous, he found great difficulty in exciting any public interest, which caused him great disappointment. He paid a visit to Ireland, where he was cordially received, and he could not help contrasting the fact with the indifference his proposi- tions met with in a certain wealthier country.

40 ON THE EXTKAVAGANT USE OF should be made to check the escape of the heat at the earliest moment. The Hot-plate. This most distinctive portion of the kitchener is highly valued in consequence of the facility which it affords for cooking at a greater or less rate of speed over the whole of its surface. It is heated as already explained, by cur- rents of hot air from the fire, which pass directly beneath it. But though the hot-plate offers a very superior method of cooking to the old crude system of the open range, a little consideration will suffice to show that it is suscep- tible of considerable improvement, or rather, it should per- haps be said, that it is susceptible of a modification which would render it, in all probability, as superior to what is now used as that is superior to the open fire. The disadvantage of the hot-plate is, that it is always heated to a greater or less degree, whether required for use or not, and that a considerable surface of heated metal is consequently diffu- sing heat during the entire day, while only a portion of that entire surface, and that during certain portions of the day, is actually turned to account. This considera- tion suffices at once to show what a large scope there is for economy, for if the various cooking operations could be conducted without a hot-metal surface, always sending a great portion of its heat to cause inconvenience and waste, the gain would be very great. Thanks to the excel- lence of Count Rumfordâ€™s teaching, there is no occasion to travel far to find a remedy. Figs. 38 to 40, represent a sytem of heating various cooking vessels, by which as little heat as possible is given into the kitchen, and the heat of the fire is used with strict economy. Instead of a large heated surface over which vessels can be placed indis- criminately, a surface is shown of glazed tiles or glazed

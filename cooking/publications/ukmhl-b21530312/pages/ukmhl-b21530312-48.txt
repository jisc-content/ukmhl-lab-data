ON THE EXTRAVAGANT USE OF 34 On the Fire-place of the Kitchener. The most important part of the kitchener, with respect to economy, is the fire-place. It is usually made of a cubical form, measuring some ten or twelve inches each way, with a metal grating at bottom, movable covers at top, and a door in front, to cover some three or four inches of the fire below the top surface. This door is closed whenever heat is required for the ovens or the hot- plate. On other occasions it should be left open, so as to avoid any unnecessary consumption of coal. The first point readily susceptible of improvement relates to the depth of the fire. It is not necessary that it should he so deep as ten or twelve inches. The only advantage of a deep fire is, that it enables a joint to he roasted in front, but this is an advantage of scarcely any practical value. For it to be available, the door must be left open, and then the ovens and hot-plate are imperfectly heated. Besides, the roasting of joints is now invariably done in the ovens, so that the only real use of the front fire is for toasting bread, and for certain other small pur- poses of cooking, for which a less depth would he found amply sufficient. The hot-plate and the ovens receive their heat entirely from the upper portion of the burning fuel. The boiler may be most perfectly heated by the shallower fire, and if, therefore, the depth were made some six or eight inches instead of ten or twelve, the advan- tages would be, that there would be less heat given to the inconvenience of the persons present, and less waste of coal. Some years ago, the writerâ€™s firm encountered the evil of the deep fire by making the bottom grate to he wound up and down, so that the fire might be used deep or shallow at pleasure. This arrangement shown in Fig. 27, is very much better than to use a fire that is

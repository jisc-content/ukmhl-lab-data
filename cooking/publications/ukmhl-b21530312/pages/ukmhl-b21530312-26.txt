ON THE EXTEAVAGANT USE OF 12 When he had completed the publication of his essays, Count Rumford, desirous of rest from his arduous labors, went to reside in France. He travelled in Switzerland and Italy in company of the widow of the celebrated Lavoisier, whom he subsequently married, and formed his residence at Auteuil, near to Paris. The union is said not to have been a fortunate one, and to have ended in a separation. The Count remained at Auteuil, receiving only certain particular scientific friends who belonged to the French Academy, of which body he was an Associate; and in 1814 he died, rather suddenly, at the age of sixty. His attached friend, Cuvier, then secretary to the Academy, rendered him the eulogistic honor paid by that body on the decease of a member. It has been said that Rumford was influenced in his labors rather by the calculations of the able adminis- trator than by the sympathies of the philanthropist,* and that his preferences were for a country like China, where the people are governed by the learned ; but that this judg- ment is not trustworthy is evident enough from his essays, where the true nature of the man reveals itself in the most unmistakable manner. That he was an able administrator is undoubtedly true, and it is equally true that he was not an unreasoning philanthropist, but that the man who could devote himself for years to ameliorate the condition of the lower classes, and who could effect all that he did without permitting anything but kind treat- ment, not even the slightest chastisement of a child, and who could turn from the scientific researches of the study * “ Rumford a fait beaucoup de bien aux homines, mais ce fut sans les aimer et sans les estimer. Dirige dans ses operations plutfit par les calculs d’un administrateur que par les mouvements d’un philanthrope, il jugeait les hommes comme un planteur juge les esclaves.’'—Biographie Universelle. Never surely was judgment more at fault.

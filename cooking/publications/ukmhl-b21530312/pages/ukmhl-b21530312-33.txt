19 FUEL IN COOKING. which from the want of a simple precaution, had been found to be peculiar in meat so prepared, and this led him to make a special study of the question with results as useful as those which followed any of his investiga- tions. His experiments satisfied him that the peculiar taint of baked meat, was due simply to the fact, of melted fat from the meat being allowed to fall on a very hot surface, becoming burnt and infecting the enclosed air. This evil he avoided by the construction of a water-dish, which, as subsequently made, consisted of a tin dish in two parts, as Figs. 14 and 15, one part fitting on the other, so as to leave a space between the two. Into the hollow space, water was introduced, which slowly evapo- rated, and kept the heat of the metal below that of boil- ing water. A metal grating placed above the dish sup- ported the joint, and as long as water was in the dish it was found that the meat was as totally free from taint, as when cooked before an open fire. Count Rumford was not the man to do things by halves. Without having any tendency to indulge in epicurean habits, his sense of taste was keen. He concluded from his observations, that the open fire used for roasting afforded too fierce a process, and that a slower system would less exhaust the meat of its juices, and be both more perfect and more economical. He therefore arranged his roasting ovens for a slower process, and introduced certain details which gave them additional value. To the top of the roaster he attached a metal tube, which could be opened more or less, at pleasure, and which was led into the chimney for the purpose of allowing steam from the oven to pass away whenever necessary. Below the roaster he arranged two tubes, termed “ blow pipes,” which opened into the room with movable covers attached, and entered the roaster behind, as shown in the figures 17 and 18. c 2

FUEL IN COOKING. 33 mentary composition, is susceptible of so much improve- ment with respect to economy, considered of course in connection with perfect efficiency, that if one of its fea- tures after another were carefully examined and con- sidered, and if everything possible were done by way of amelioration, it would inevitably end in being transformed into an article that could hardly be said to bear any re- semblance to its original. Waste of heat may now be readily traced to four causes. Firstly. To the too free admission of air to the fire, which promotes rapid combustion, but greatly reduces the temperature of the air 'which passes round the flues. Secondly. To the exposure of a large surface of hot metal which, instead of confining and economising the heat, radiates it to waste. Thirdly. To the rapid draught which is permitted by the flues to the chimney, which carries off the warm air instead of its being properly retained and utilised. Fourthly. To the use of a single fire for all purposes, small or great. It is not possible to adapt a single fire so that its consumption shall be in exact proportion to the amount of work required to be done at any hour. A cer- tain amount of waste must inevitably occur even when the most careful provisions are made to insure economy; and, practically, this waste is considerably augmented, owing to the neglect of servants. The various means which can be adopted for effecting economy may be considered under the heads of 1. The Fire-place. 2. The Ovens. 3. The Boiler. 4. The Dampers. 5. The Hot-plate. 6. Other means. D

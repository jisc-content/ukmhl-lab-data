FUEL IN COOKING. 39 point, so that they actually allow the heat to escape to waste by the boiler flue at the very time it ought to he diverted for the purpose of heating other portions ol the apparatus. The reason why power has been given them so to misuse the kitchener, is that a rapid draught into the chimney is required at the time of lighting the fire, that the whole concern may be put into working order as rapidly as possible. This is obtained by opening the damper of the boiler flue. After this object is gained, the damper should be nearly closed, and upon no account left open more than is necessary to keep the water up to a certain temperature. It may be opened for a few minutes when necessary to make water boil, and should then be closed again, or nearly so. There is no point so apt to be neglected, and which so much requires atten- tion, as the damper to the boiler flue when arranged in the manner described. If the various improvements al- ready indicated with respect to the fire-place were carried out, there would not be such a liability as at present to waste of fuel and heat from the recklessness of servants, for however neglectful they might be, the draught could not become anything like as powerful as it frequently is at present; but the only thoroughly effectual remedy is to remove from the servants the possibility of obtaining a very rapid draught by allowing no direct communication with the chimney, and making the hot air take a more circuitous passage for heating the boiler, as indicated in the description to Fig. 40. The Dampers. No damper should be open more than is strictly neces- sary to allow the smoke and gases from the fire to escape. If desired to heat an oven quickly, the damper belonging to it may be opened for a short time, hut it

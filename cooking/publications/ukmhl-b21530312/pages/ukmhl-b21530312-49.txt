35 FUEL IN COOKING. always a deep one, but it could not be so economical as a fixed shallow fire always burning close to the hot-plate. A further suggestion is that the bottom on which the fire rests, should be of fire-brick, pierced with a number of holes for the dust to fall through, and not of iron. The fire- brick may be flat as shown in Fig. 34, or of an elliptical form. Just as in the case of the fire-grates, the fire-brick proves most effectual in retaining the heat, in promoting a more perfect combustion of the coal, and in checking by its limited apertures, the unnecessary entrance of air from below, and the descent of coal or combustible matter from the fire. A third suggestion is to use the fire on the slow-com- bustion principle, by closing the fire in front, allowing a small supply of air to enter the fire through some holes in the door, and checking the entrance of air through the brick or iron grate by means of a regulator which could be arranged at the ash-pit as shown in Fig. 38. It was a saying of Count Rumford, that any air which entered a kitchen fire, and which was not required for combustion, was a thief which stole the heat, and escaped with it up the chimney, and his remark aptly indicates the scru- pulous care which should be used in availing ourselves as largely as possible of so important a means of economising fuel. The difficulty is that the open fire becomes dis- pensed with as long as it is used on a slow-combustion principle, but, with a door made to open and fire-bars behind, this is a matter of no moment, as the fire could then be used either open or closed as desired, and the alternative would act most beneficially, by enabling ser- vants to become gradually accustomed to the use of a closed fire. A fourth suggestion which experience has repeatedly proved to be of the highest value, is to adopt the smoke- d 2

IX PREFACE. had been a profitable thing for men to study the subject of improvements, the present writer would never have bad to urge bis questions upon the public. He would long since have been anticipated. It certainly ought not to be so. It is to be hoped that the difficulties which attend the introduction of improvements will gradually diminish; but, as matters stand at present, it is an unquestionable fact that successful tradesmen do not generally care about improvements. They find it sufficient to be on the look out to observe which way the wind is blowing. A person who relies upon bis skill has not a chance, and the one most suitable to initiate a reform is either such a man as Count Rumford, who from deliberate choice devoted himself gratuitously with that object, or the manufacturer who makes himself specially conversant, who, happily, inde- pendent of such means for his subsistence, feels a pleasure in devoting himself to those questions of general utility which may afford him the readiest opportunity of proving useful, and who can afford to exercise, with some sort of philosophical resignation, the patience which is necessary for effecting a slight change for the better in any portion of the worldâ€™s affairs. 49, Great Marlborough Street, London, February 16, 1869.

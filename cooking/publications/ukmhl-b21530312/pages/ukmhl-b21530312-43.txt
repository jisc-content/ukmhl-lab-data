29 FUEL IN COOKING. great deal of heat; and this difficulty cannot be avoided while the presence is permitted ol a large surface of highly-heated metal. In the second place, from the chimney being closed above, a mixture--pf scents arising from cooking operations pervades the apartment, and these scents may frequently be carried up stairs by a current of air to the inconvenience of the inmates, or may even find their way through the ceiling and floor boards into the room above. In the third place, more expense is incuried for repairs in the kitchener than with the old kind of range; and this is due to the fact that the constant use of a semi-closed fire, by which a powerful heat is engen- dered, is liable to wear out with comparative rapidity the parts which come in contact with the fire. And, lastly, an objection may justly be made with respect to economy; for, whatever may be the conveniences of the kitchener, it can hardly be supposed that a contrivance which throws off so powerful a heat can be strictly economical, and, what is equally true, but to a casual observer is not equally apparent, is that the amount of hot air which is carried off by the flues, often in a great measure from careless management, is such as to put out of the question any idea of there being strict economy. The fire may be much smaller than in the open range; but this does not prevent it burning with greater rapidity. Heat of the Kitchener. With respect to the first difficulty, certain palliatives to the heat of the kitchener may be found, first, in using a metal screen before the fire, as shown in Fig. 36, which, when turned up so as to hide the fire, greatly lessens the heat radiated in front of it; and, secondly, by using Count Rumfordâ€™s double doors to the ovens, which, by

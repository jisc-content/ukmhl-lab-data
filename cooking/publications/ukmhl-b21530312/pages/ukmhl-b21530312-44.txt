ON THE EXTRAVAGANT USE OF 30 confining the heat within, greatly prevents its injurious escape ; but the most important assistance may be gained by avoiding metal as much as possible, and substituting for it tiles. This would involve a considerable modifi- cation of the kitchenerâ€”a matter that will be considered further on. Ventilation of the Kitchen. The second difficulty mentioned relates to the venti- lation of the kitchen. It has been already explained that a door is provided above the kitchener which opens into the chimney. If this door were always open, much of both cooking smell and heat would escape; but it is found that to open the door so interferes with the draught of the flues, that the cooking operations become impeded, and the door must perforce be closed at the very time ventilation is most required. Sometimes an Arnott venti- lator is put into the chimney below the ceiling, which allows air from the room to escape freely; but even then it is often necessary to allow the ventilator to be only a little open, so as to diminish the current of air escaping. What the author conceives to be a most excellent arrange- ment is one described by him in his work on Ventilation, which consists of a funnel of the shape shown in Fig. 35, which is fixed over the fire-place, with the flat tube carried to above the height where the small flues enter the chimney. The effect of this arrangement is, that a constant ascent of air from the kitchen is permitted which the tube precludes from interfering with the proper action of the flues. There are cases, however, where this remedy would not suffice to remove all inconvenience, and a modification of certain constructional arrangements in the dwelling could alone effect it. What is to be done, for instance, in a

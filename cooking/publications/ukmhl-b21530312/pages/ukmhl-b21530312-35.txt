21 FUEL IN COOKING. Count Rumford’s scientific system, not only throws much into the shade our own methods, whether old- fashioned or modern, but it also compares most favor- ably with the systems adopted in other countries where economy in fuel is attended to more strictly than it is with us. In America, and on the continent of Europe gene- rally, our lavish system of using a powerful fire, and wasting large quantities of heat is avoided, but Count Rumford’s careful provisions for preventing loss of heat by radiation are not followed. There is in fact no proba- bility of economy in the use of fuel for cooking purposes, having been carried out so completely since his time.

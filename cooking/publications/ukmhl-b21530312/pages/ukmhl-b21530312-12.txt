We are now recklessly, almost criminally, extravagant. Other nations are not so. The causes are not far to seek. Only let us resolutely 1 educe the heat radiated to waste in the kitchen apaitment, and the hot air sent rapidly away up the chimney, and the whole state of things becomes changed. Consumption may easily be reduced to a half, a third, or even a fourth. Count Rumford reduced it to less than a fifth, and if in the face of such a fact we have gone on in Â°ur extiavagant habits, this is simply because the difficulties which have to be encountered are altogether of another natuie than those which concern the public exposition of an improved system, and of the advantages attending it. Many may suppose that a manufacturer has it com- pletely within his power to bring an improved system into use. They are most entirely mistaken.

To bring about a change in any matter, there are generally years of uphill work, in which money has to be sunk instead of being made, and this does not suit the keen- siglited man of business. If this were not so, if it really

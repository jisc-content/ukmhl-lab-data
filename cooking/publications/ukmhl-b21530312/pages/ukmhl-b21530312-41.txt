FUEL IN COOKING. 27 is used to regulate the supply, and to make it perpetual as long as water can be obtained from the cold-watei cistern. As soon as a fire is lighted, the whole being propeily charged with water, circulation begins. The water in the boiler rises as it becomes heated and ascends the uppei pipe, cooler water from the lower pipe taking its place. As the heating process continues, the hot water ascends to the circulating cistern, and a rapid circulation of water ensues from the boiler to the cistern and back by the de- scending pipe to the boiler until the watei, both m the pipes and cistern, attains a high temperature. In the boiler and ascending pipe the water is of course hottest. In the return pipe it is coolest. The hot water is diawn off either by a branch from the boiler, or by branches from the liot-water cistern, or from one of the circulating pipes. One branch may pass to a warm bath; other branches may supply hot water at various points, such as to wash- hand basins, to a shower-bath, to a scullery, &c. In some cases the principle of circulation is extended, so that the current of hot water may have to find its way through a series, or a coil of pipes, for the purpose of giving heat to a hall or a conservatory before it finds its way back to the boiler. Some provision is necessarily made, so that the circulation may be thus extended or not at pleasure. All these arrangements, shown in Fig. 33, do not, of course, particularly concern the kitchener. The principles of hot water circulation, whether for heating buildings or for providing hot water in large quantities, are applied in much the same manner; and they concern the kitchener only with respect to the facility which it offers for such additional conveniences to be applied. The same con- veniences can be used with the open range, though not to the same extent, inasmuch as a much more sluggish cir-

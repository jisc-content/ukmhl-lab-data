45 FUEL IN COOKING. American Cooking Stoves. There are some contrivances chiefly imitated from foreign manufacture which increased intercourse with other nations has brought forward of late years, and which appear to deserve some words of comment. Fig. 44 re- presents an American cooking stove called the Excelsior, which was brought to the Exhibition of 1851 by Mr. Lyman D. Burch, an American manufacturer, and was subsequently sold in this country as a regular article of commerce. It was entirely closed, was of cast iron, and though it consisted of some thirty parts, was arranged to be put together in a remarkably ingenious fashion, the amount of labor required being most incredibly small. The stove had two ovens—a large and a small one—and the top formed a hot-plate, upon which water was boiled in a large tin vessel, various covers being made movable to provide every necessary facility. When the fire was lighted, the smoke was allowed to escape at once into the smoke-pipe provided for it; but as soon as the fire was well made, a damper closed the ready access to the chim- ney, and the heat was made by a most ingenious arrange- ment of flues to pass completely round the internal casings of both ovens before it could escape into the chimney. This, like so many other American contrivances, exhibited a freshness and a strength of inventive faculty that was really marvellous to those who could appreciate it. It was for some time imported ; but at a later period various cooking stoves, copied from American manufacture, be- came produced in this country, and they are now used to a certain extent. With respect to economy, the Ameri- can stoves are much better than the cooking contrivances we have been accustomed to, as they greatly economise the heat which we allow to escape by the chimney; hut

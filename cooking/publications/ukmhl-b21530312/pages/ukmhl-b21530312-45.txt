31 FUEL IN COOKING. house where the general supply of air by outer doors and by windows is totally insufficient to replace that which passes away by the chimneys when fires are in use ? As the house becomes in some degree exhausted of air, it is absolutely impossible to prevent the ascent of the less rarefied air from the kitchen department by every possible medium of access, and a powerful draught when the dooi or doors of communication are opened. The air thus ascending necessarily furnishes evidence of what is going on below ; and any attempt to remedy the inconvenience in the kitchen itself is about as likely to be entirely successful as are the efforts of a person who is looking industriously for an article he has no wish to find. The only clear and sensible remedy for such a state of things is to avoid a rarefied atmosphere above. Sufficient air must be allowed to enter a house to replace what escapes, or the inevitable consequence is that the atmosphere feels oppressive as compared with the external air; that there are down currents in chimneys; that there are smoky chimneys, and, of course, draughts of air from other portions of the dwelling which are more freely pro- vided. Many persons, when they feel a draught of air at a door or window, invariably try to improve matters by putting baize round the door, or by having the casement more carefully fitted, not reflecting that they can only succeed thereby in making matters worse than before; for, as long as an open fire is in use, air must be had, and if it cannot came in by the usual means it will descend the chimney. To attempt to exclude air under such cir- cumstances appears like smothering up a man who is gasping for breath. It is not in the slightest degree diffi- cult to prevent draughts. Indeed, a house might have a fire burning in every room, and yet there be no perceptible draught. To find a remedy we must turn away from the

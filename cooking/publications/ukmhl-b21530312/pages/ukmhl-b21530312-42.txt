28 ON THE EXTRAVAGANT USE OE culation is obtained by the use of an open fire; and they can, of course, be used in connection with a boiler where- ever it is placed, though then a fire must be made ex- pressly, whereas the kitchener may always enable a warm bath to be had at a few minutesâ€™ notice. It cannot be denied that such an arrangement gives a look of admirable completeness, and that the boiler appears generally to be better devoted to this purpose than in providing steam for cooking. Some have indeed sought to make the kitchener answer both purposes by using two boilers; but this leads to complication, and increases the possibility of an ex- cessive consumption. The only practicable means of making one boiler answer the double purpose of supplying steam for cooking and heating water for a bath is to use the boiler for steam purposes only, and to connect the boiler by means of a pipe with a hot water cistern, wdiich pipe should enter the cistern, and be wound round within it in the form of a coil stopped at the end to prevent any communication with the water in the cistern. Care should be taken that no condensed steam lodge in the coil, but that it should drip back into the boiler. This method of heating the water by steam, instead of by circu- lation, is rather adapted for the use of a small family than for anything on an extensive scale. Whether or not the kitchener be used with any of these additions, it must fairly be admitted that it is a very clean and complete contrivance. It has succeeded in making a good impression; and, most important of all, it satisfies the servant maids, who appear to have become attached to it as they have become familiar with its working. But it has drawbacks which are inherent to it as at present con- structed, and which will not probably be found to require the exercise of any considerable amount of science to be effectually overcome. In the first place, it gives out a

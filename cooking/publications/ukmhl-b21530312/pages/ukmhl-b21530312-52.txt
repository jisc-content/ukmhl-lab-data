ON THE EXTRAVAGANT USE OF 38 some non-conducting and incombustible material. A treble effect is gained by such a system. The oven is more regularly heated, fuel is economised, and less heat is given where its presence may occasion discomfort. But it is possible to improve on Count Rumfords system, by availing ourselves of the facilities we now possess of lining the outer surface of the doors with white tiles, which are admirable non-conductors, and always look clean and cheerful. The Boiler. There could hardly be a more economical system of heating the boiler than the one shown in Fig. 26, where no current of air is diverted for the purpose, but the contact of the boiler with the fire at back and on one side, suffices not only to heat the water, but to produce steam for cooking. This system is only adapted, however, for cook- ing on a comparatively small scale. When the demands are greater two ovens are required, and the whole of the top surface is required for use as a hot-plate. The boiler is then placed behind the fire, and is generally of the shape shown in Fig. 32. It is heated partly by contact with the fire, and partly by a current of hot air, which is allowed to pass from the fire under the boiler and up the back of it into the chimney. The flue constructed under the boiler gives the most direct escape for air from the fire. Its draught is, therefore, very powerful, and it becomes absolutely necessary that it should be checked by means of the damper shown in the figure, both for the purpose of pre- venting the wasteful escape of the heat and unnecessoiy combustion of the fuel, and to enable a great portion of the hot air to find its way round the other flues for the purpose of heating the ovens and hot-plate. Careless sei~ vants are in the habit of neglecting this most essential

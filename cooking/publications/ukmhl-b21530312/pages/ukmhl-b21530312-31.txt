17 FUEL IN COOKING. made temporarily below the boiler, and when roasting had to be performed, the necessary fire was of course made for that particular purpose. When the requirements were above the average further fire-places were set at work, and, on rare occasions, the whole might be in operation. Now, it will be at once evident that a remarkable amount of economy must have been effected by each fire-place being most carefully arranged to economise heat, and by the number of fire-places set at work being exactly proportioned to the work required at any time to be done. Instead of a waggon and a pair of horses, to which our insular system of cooking may be likened, always at work carrying now an article of trifling weight, occasionally something more, very often carrying nothing, here were a number of ready servants, one, two, three or more of which could be had at a few minutesâ€™ notice, and, except when absolutely wanted, consuming nothing at all. For the purpose of ascertaining the comparative cost of cooking with an open and with a closed fire, Count Rumford made certain experiments. He found that a large boiler containing twenty-eight gallons of water re- quired sixty-two and a half lbs. of wood to boil the water and to keep it boiling for two hours when an open fire was used. With a closed fire-place it required only thirteen and a half lbs. He experimented with a copper saucepan used in an open fire-place, and again in such an enclosed fire-place as is shown in Fig. 1. In the one case he consumed eleven and a half lbs. of wood, and in the other one and three-quarter lbs. He discovered that at least seven-eighths of the heat commonly produced were lost, and that speaking generally five times as much heat was required with an open fire-place as it was when the fire-place was closed, and on taking the various sources of economy into consideration, he ultimately came to the c

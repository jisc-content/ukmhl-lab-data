Cooking of Crimped Salmon. 193 the crisp brittle quality of the flakes which the flesh offers after crimping, are wholly unknown wherever the salmon has to be carried by a transit exceeding in length a duration of twenty-four hours. Perhaps I ought to add, lest a doubt should exist in the mind of any one, that crimping Crimping of thus done, that is, eight hours after re- fnfl™°s no moval from the water, inflicts no pain pa-i"- whatever on the fish ; were it otherwise I would not sanction it for any consideration whatever. To cook crimped salmon in perfection, a slice should be plunged into an ample saucepan of boiling salted water, and allowed to boil six or seven minutes only. The quantity of water in the fish-kettle should of course be sufficient in relation to the salmon put therein, not to cease boiling in consequence; and on removing the slices when the time is up, they should not be exposed more than is necessary even to the action of the steam arising from the kettle. This may appear almost an unnecessary refinement: I can vouch for the fact that exposure to the current of steam for a few seconds lessens materially the crisp- ness of the crimped fish. Closely related to the baking of fish is another mode of cooking it, which is applicable Roasting to nearly every variety, and which has the advantage of retaining all the nutritive material, while the juices and the characteristic flavour are preserved in a manner not attained by any other process. It is rarely practised, because any other N

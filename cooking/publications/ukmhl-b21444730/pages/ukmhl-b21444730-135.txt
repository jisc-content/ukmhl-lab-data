Process of Frying. ittj to be fried is coagulated, so that the juices with their flavours, etc., are at once lodged up within, and nothing can escape. The bath should therefore contain quantity sufficient to permit the complete immersion of the portion to be fried, and also be hot enough to effect this result in an instant, after which, and during the short time requisite to cook the interior, the heat is often slightly lowered with advantage. The fish or other material employed emerges when done, with a surface to which a little oil adheres, but this will drain off owing to its extreme fluidity when hot, if left on a napkin slanting a minute or two before the fireâ€”better still, on white blotting- paper ; and thus it may be served absolutely free from grease. The film of egg often applied to the surface of an object to be fried, is in the same manner instantly coagulated and forms an impermeable case ; while the fine bread crumbs adhering to it take a bright yellow colour, being slightly charred or toasted by the high temperature they are exposed to. In order to be free from grease when served the Avoid bread or biscuit crumbs should be very grease; fine, adhering by means of a very thin layer of egg previously applied by the brush. If the crumbs are coarse and the egg is used too abundantly, grease will adhere to the surface or be absorbed by it; thus a thick indigestible case covers the fish, a con- dition in which, unhappily, it commonly appears at table, even in the better class of hotels in this country.

PREFACE TO THE NINTH EDITION During the last few years several large editions of this book have been called for, and much new matter has been added to three or four of them. The last edition has, however, been exhausted, and the work is out of print. I propose in this, my final edition, to bring the subject up to the present date, and to utter my last words respecting it. For scientific research, never ceasing to progress, has naturally added something to our knowledge of the digestive processes, as well as of the value to man of certain food-principles from which his body derives nutrition. The art of cooking also has, like other arts, been sedulously cultivated by a few, leading to improve- ments in appliances and in the methods to be adopted for the preparation of a wholesome and agreeable diet. Moreover, the selection of food and the pre- paration of it for the table are far more widely understood and appreciated now than they were when the little volume first appeared nearly twenty years ago.

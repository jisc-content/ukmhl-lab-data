In some fish, where the fat is large in quantity (herring, mackerel, salmon, etc.), the water is correspondingly diminished. It should be stated that this estimate has been based solely on the leading and most important facts afforded by a chemical analysis, without reference to other considerations of minor importance referred to below.* * It is well known that there are some restorative qualities contained in animal flesh, which, although not at present fully appreciated by chemical analysis, have a value of no mean order, demonstrated chiefly by empirical observation. The invigorating effect of a small quantity of beef-tea, in a person suffering from inanition, may be cited in illustration ; the solid matter resulting from its evaporation being insignificant in quantity when compared with the support afforded. Now, the product obtained by dealing with fish, in the same manner as we treat beef in order to obtain " beef-tea," is gi-eatly inferior

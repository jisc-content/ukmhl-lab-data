The thick Constmc- sides of the Aladdin oven are made of indurated and incombustible papier mdch^, or of a wood pulp, desiccated, which is practically almost the same thing, one of the best non-conductors of heat known, with a thin metallic lining; the interior cavity available for cooking, which is divided by movable horizontal partitions for different dishes, measuring from a foot to a foot and a half in every direction, in the sizes at present mostly used. The heat is supplied to the oven by means of an oil lamp below, or by gas ; in either case the amount supplied being always under the control of the cook.

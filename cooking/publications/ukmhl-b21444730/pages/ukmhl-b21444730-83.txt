The Legumes: Simple Cookery. 75 a large dish, and may be eaten with salt and pepper. It will be greatly improved at small Y^j.;Qjjg cost by the addition of a bit of butter, methods of or of melted butter with parsley, or if an onion or two have been sliced and stewed with the haricots. A better dish still may be made by putting all or part, after boiling, into a shallow frying-pan, and lightly frying for a few minutes with a little lard and some sliced onions. With a few slices of bacon added, a comparatively luxurious and highly nutritive meal may be made. But there is still in the saucepan, after boiling the haricots, a residue of small value, which the French peasant's wife, who turns everything to account, utilizes in a manner quite incomprehensible to the Englishwoman. The water in which dried haricots have stewed, and also that in which green French beans have been boiled, contains a proportion of nutritive matter. The Frenchwoman preserves this liquor carefully, cuts and fries some onions, adds to it these and some thick slices of bread, a little salt and pepper, with a potherb or two from the corner of the garden, and thus serves hot an agreeable and useful crotlte aii pot. It ought to be added that the haricots so largely used by the work- ing classes throughout Europe are not precisely either "red" or "white," but some cheaper local varieties, known as haricots dii pays. These are now supplied here at about twopence a pound, and in large quantity might be obtained at a somewhat cheaper rate, their quality as food being not inferior to other kinds.

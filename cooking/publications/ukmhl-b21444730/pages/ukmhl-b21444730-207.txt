Fish Soitps Excellent. 199 two or three small portions each, boil for a few minutes in some of the stock, add a little fresh green chervil and parsley chopped, not too finely, and serve all together in a tureen. If the soup is preferred somewhat thicker in body than this receipt produces, let it be made tq thicken so by adding some farinaceous matter in small quantity, as crhne die riz, or, if preferred, a table- spoonful of white rotix (that is, a little flour well mixed with butter in a stewpan over the fire, cooked, but not allowed to brown) ; either addition is un- doubtedly an improvement. It is, in my opinion, undesirable to clarify fish soups; if other garnish is desired, quenelles -j-g gamish of whiting may be substituted for the fillets ; and some of them may have a little coral (spawn of the lobster) added to furnish flavour and colour. A further change may be made by adding fillets of other fish, or a few shell-fish, and a few small balls of seasoning, similar to that used for veal and poultry.

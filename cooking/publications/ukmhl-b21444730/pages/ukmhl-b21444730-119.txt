Slow Cookmg; for a Ham. 111 soon to the boiling point, maintaining this for five minutes only, no more. Then withdraw the pot from the fire so that the stock may gradually cool to a temperature about 170°, but not exceed- Temperature ing that. Keep it thus 12 hours. For never to . exceed 170°. this purpose it is best to place it over a gas ring, which is easily regulated ; and to have a thermometer which ranges up to 212°, the boiling point, precisely like a "bath thermometer," that is, with a tin receptacle at the lower end guarding the bulb, only that the bottom of the receptacle should be cut away for kitchen use, otherwise organic matter would lodge there, soon decompose, and become noxious.* Suppose at the end of this time that by means of the thermometer, and by adjustment of the gas, that the temperature has been steadily maintained, pre- paration must be made for leaving it for the night, so that the temperature shall not henceforth exceed 150°; on the other hand, it shall not fall below 130°. With a little observation, it is easy to ascertain how much gas suffices to do this during the night; and a small quantity of fresh stock to fully cover the ham is added the last thing. The cover of the pot being always on, the loss by evaporation is very small ; but towards the close of the process, the stock may be allowed to diminish one-third or so of the original quantity. * Negretti & Zambra, Regent Street, supply these made as described.

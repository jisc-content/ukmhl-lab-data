The meat will temperature ; "simmer- be in better condition at table if the pot is removed a little from the fire, so that a temperature of six or eight degrees below boiling is sustained for the usual period of time required, which, of course, varies according to the size of the joint. This is what is understood by the term "sim- mering." Maintaining the water in a state of con- stant ebullition involves a large waste of fuel, and does not raise the temperature, either of the liquid or the meat a single degree.

Let me say that such experiments have been made many years ago, I believe thirty or forty. At least twelve or fifteen years have elapsed since it was repeated by myself in both boiled and roasted meats in order to

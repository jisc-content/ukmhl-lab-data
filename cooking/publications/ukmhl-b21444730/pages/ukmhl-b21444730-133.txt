Broiling mid Frying. 125 split chicken, the bladebone, or even a small shoulder of mutton—all of which may be thus served in per- fection by a competent hand. Still, it is not quite so widely appreciated as it deserves to be in the preparation of many a small dish of ^^^jj^^jg j-^^ fish, fowl, and meat, or " a bone," to say many little nothing of a grilled mushroom, either alone, or as an accompaniment to any of them. And it may be worth while, perhaps, remarking that the sauce par excellence for broils is mushroom ketch- up ; and the garnish cool lettuce, watercress, or endive. Lastly, Frying.—Cooking by immersion in oil or melted fat at temperatures greatly exceeding that of boiling water, and popularly known as frying. This process is rarely understood, and is generally very imperfectly practised by the ordinary English cook. The products of our frying-pan are often greasy, and there- fore for many persons indigestible, the rationale shallow form of the pan being unsuited °^ Process, for the process of cooking at a high temperature in oil, that is, at a heat of about 350° to 390° Fahr., that of boiling water being 212°. This high tempe- rature produces results, which are equivalent indeed to quick roasting, when the article to be cooked is immersed in the nearly boiling fat. Frying, as gene- rally conducted, is rather a combination of broiling and toasting or scorching ; and the use of the deep pan or bath of heated oil or dripping, which is

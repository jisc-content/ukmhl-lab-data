Definition of Cookery. 93 First, in order to illustrate what I mean by prin- ciples, I will define cookery as almost coo^ery, a invariably implying a process of render- P^°^J^?j°^ ino" various foods, whether animal or food attrac- vegetable, which cannot be agreeably or nutritious safely eaten in their natural state, attrac- heat, tive, digestible, and nutritious, by the application of heat through different means or media, and at greatly differing degrees of temperature, I shall briefly consider, first, the process of cooking food through the medium of water, . ° Various employed at a temperature of 212° Fahr., methods used as {a) boiling; by the steam only of boiling water, as {U) steaming; afterwards as [c) stewing and braising, in which lower temperatures than boiling are adopted, while the process is con- tinued for a much longer period. Secondly, will follow the process of cooking food in dry heated air, as in {a) baking; or by radiation of heat from a clear fire, as in {F) roasting; or on a grill above it, commonly known as ic) broiling. Lastly, the process of cooking by immersion in oil at a much higher temperature than can be obtained by any boiling in water, which is " frying." First, the cooking of meat by means of boiling water, although this is really effected in By means the interior of the portion or joint con- ^a^gr^^'^ siderably under the boiling temperature, "boiling." Water "boils" when heated to 212° Fahr. at the sea- level ; but to attain the best results from cookery,

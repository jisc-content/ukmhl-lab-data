Experiments on Temperature. 97 ascertain by personal observation that in each case meat could be well cooked at the temperature named. During the last winter, 1897-98, I have repeated these experiments very carefully, expressly for this edition, taking note of the exact result on each of the trials, twenty-four in number. They are as follows:— No. How Name of joint. Time of Temp. hours. Fahr.

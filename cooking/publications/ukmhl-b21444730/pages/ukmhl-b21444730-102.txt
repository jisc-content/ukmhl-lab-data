94 Food and Feeding. a much lower temperature may be employed, as we shall learn hereafter; " boiled meat" being, in fact, never really boiled throughout. It should also be remembered that the heat obtained by the act of boiling varies in proportion to the elevation of the spot above the level just named, at which the process takes place. Thus, water boils at a temperature several degrees lower for every thousand feet of elevation ; therefore in mountain climbing, it is quite possible to reach a height at which water boils when not sufficiently hot even to cook an egg efficiently, which can be done at i8oÂ°. Now, in the culinary treatment of flesh of all kinds Two modes and of fish, by water, the object to be portion of flesh it is desired to extract as much of the soluble portions as possible, as for the purpose of making soup or beef-tea, the course pursued will be directly opposite to that which is necessary when the object is to prepare the portion for a dish to be consumed at the table. In the latter case, we desire to retain all the nutritive and sapid qualities of the meat within the portion, leaving none in the water used for cooking. In the former case, we leave the flesh, if possible, exhausted of flavour and nourishing juices, nearly all of which we desire to find in the water employed. The principle relied on to accomplish our aim in each case is based on the fact that the albumen, of thus cooking meat; attained by the process must first be distinctly apprehended. If from a given

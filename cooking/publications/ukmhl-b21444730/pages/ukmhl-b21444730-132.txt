A clear and smokeless fire is often not to be had without considerable delay and pre- paration, and then must be exclusively devoted to the grill as long as this is required, to the exclusion of other processes, except those which are to be conducted on the adjacent hot plate. The object is to seal the surface of the meat by heat at first, not permitting the temperature of the interior to rise to a higher point than just suffices to render it tender, as it becomes filled and expanded by its own juices, which are yielded abundantly in the form of rich red gravy when the meat is cut by the consumer a few minutes afterwards. Hence the morsel, plump and rounded by the action of the heat, must not be touched by a fork, the perforations thus made permitting the rich natural juices of the meat to escape, but be turned when necessary with a pair of light tongs.

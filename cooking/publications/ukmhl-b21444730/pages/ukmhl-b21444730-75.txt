Inadequate Supply of Fish. 67 Lastly, those who are interested in the national supply of food must lament that, while ^ Our fish Great Britain possesses perhaps the best supply opportunities in the world for securing a ^^S^ected. large and cheap supply of fish, she fails to attain it, and procures so little only, that it is to the great majority of the inhabitants an expensive luxury. Fish is a food of great value ; nevertheless it ought in this country to be one of the cheapest aliments, since production and growth cost absolutely nothing, only the expenses of catching, and of a short transport being incurred. This is a question which must sooner or later be solved by the public themselves, unless some persons in the trade, more enterprising than those who now pursue it, will abandon existing con- ventional rules and habits, and venture on the assuredly safe and profitable enterprise of supplying fish, good and fresh, at prices far lower than those which it is agreed shall rule at present.* * Something has been done to meet the wants of fish consumers by the fish dealers at the docks of Grimsby, Lincolnshire, to afford a regular, prompt, and cheap supply of fresh fish to families in London, and also in the country for those who reside at no great distance from a railway station. The result I believe to be tolerably satisfactory; but, with enterprise, it might be rendered more so. For a regular and varied kitchen supply— and I believe a weekly fish-dinner is a welcome as well as a wholesome change for the " servants' hall"—it may be depended on as fresh in quality and reasonable in price. But for " live salmon " or a choice turbot, as well as for " the pick of the market" in soles and other fish, a town fishmonger of the highest repute should be always applied to.

Vegetable Foods, the Cereals. 43 lOO'O the art of cultivating the first-named was acquired, the cereals appeared as improvements on the seed- bearing grasses, and now conspicuously take the first place, as containing nearly all the elements necessary to life, and being therefore the most largely con- sumed. Wheat and its congeners, which rank highest in quality, had been distinguished, in the form of bread, as " the staff of life," long before the physiological demonstration of the fact had been attained. Wheat, oats, rye and barley, maize and rice, are the chief members of this group, wheat containing most of the nitrogenous or flesh-forming material, besides abundance of starch, a very small amount of fat, together with sufficient saline and mineral elements.

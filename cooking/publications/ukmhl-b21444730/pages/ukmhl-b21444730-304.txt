Take six pounds of shin of beef; the bone to be broken into small fragments and set, together with the meat cut up fine or minced, to stand two hours in a gallon of water, at about 90° to 100°, occasionally stirring. Then drain off all the liquor; sepa- rate all the meat and set this aside. The bones are now to be placed in a saucepan with another gallon of water over the fire and well boiled for six hours, supplying loss from evaporation afterwards by adding sufficient water to make up the gallon. The two liquors may then be mixed and used as a stock to be incorporated with a puree of haricots or split peas, etc., and thickened by six pounds of fine or medium Scotch oatmeal. Meantime fry in a pound of lard, onions, celery, and carrots sufficient, sliced, all of which, together with the meat, are to be set aside, well rubbed down, and stirred into the soup at the end of the process. The pttree is to be made of twenty pounds of split peas or the same of haricots or lentils, alone or mixed, which have been soaked twenty-four hours in cold water, and slowly simmered until tender, requiring therefore about four hours more. Lastly, the oatmeal is to be mixed smooth in a little cold water, and added by degrees to two gallons of hot water. Bring to the boil and simmer for an hour. Add slowly, thoroughly incorporating all the preceding ingredients

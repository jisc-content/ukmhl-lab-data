SWEETMEATS. The following recipes for making sweetmeats are given because they do not require any special apparatus. For sweet making proper, a sugar-boiling thermometer, aluminium saucepans, special moulds, etc., are necessary. The simple sweatmeats here given want only the best quality sugar, paste colours instead of liquid colours, and a few essences and flavourings. The recipe given for fondants is the foundation for most sweets. ICED ALMONDS. Beat the white of 1 egg with sufficient finely sifted icing sugar to make it thick (using at least 4 oz.). Colour half of this pink, and leave the other half white. Blanch some Jordan almonds and dip each one in the mixture till well and roughly coated. Set them in a cool oven on a baking-sheet, taking care they do not colour. CHOCOLATE CARAMELS. 4 lb. grated chocolate. 1 breakfastcupful brown sugar. | breakfastcupful milk. 2 tablespoonsfid treacle. 1 oz. butter. Boil all the ingredients together till it thickens. After 20 to 30 minutes boiling, drop a little into cold water, and if it sets, the mixture is ready. Pour into well buttered dishes, and cut into squares when it begins to set. Coffee caramels are made by using coffee essence and cream (about 1 gill) instead of the grated chocolate. COCOA-NUT KISSES. 1 lb. loaf sugar. ^ oz. butter, f gill water. Desiccated cocoa-nut. Boil the sugar and water together till it becomes spun sugar, when a spoon is dipped in and the sugar dropped from it. Add the butter with the pan off the fire, keep it off and stir the mixture against the sides of the saucepan till it becomes cloudy. Then add the cocoa-nut and take it quickly out of the saucepan with a spoon, putting small pieces on to paper. It dries and hardens very quickly. If desired to have it coloured, mix in the colouring before adding the butter. For cocoa-uut ice, press the mixture firmly into a box or straight mould,

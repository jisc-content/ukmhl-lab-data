PREFACE. / XVI may meet with the approval of worried housekeepers ; all recipes mentioned in the menus will be found in the body of the book. We have appended French names wherever possible, but we naturally could not translate some of the old-fashioned Jewish titles. We do not pretend to claim originality for our GOO recipes, but we guarantee that all have been tested and tried, and can, with care, be carried out by the amateur as well as by the professed cook. MAY HENRY. Spring, 1902.

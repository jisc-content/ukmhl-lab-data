CREAM AND WATER ICES. *-C-* â€” HINTS ON ICE MAKING. Ices can be made in a milk-can stood in an ordinary pail, if no proper freezer is obtainable. The can must not be quite filled, as the mixture expands as it freezes. The lid must fit tightly to keep the salt freezing mixture out. The lid must also be removed occasionally and the mixture stirred from the sides to the middle to insure the whole mass being equally frozen. Stand the filled milk-can in a pail, and pack it round with ice and salt, in the proportion of twice as much ice as salt. About 6 lbs. of rough ice are required to 1 pint of the mixture to be frozen. Cover the pail to prevent the ice melting too rapidly. APRICOT ICE Creme Glacee aux CREAM. A bricots. 1 lb. fresh apricols. Juice of 2 lemons. 10 oz. castor sugar.

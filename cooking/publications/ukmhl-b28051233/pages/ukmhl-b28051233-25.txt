GOOD STOCK. Equal quantities of shin of beef and knuckle of veal. Allow 1 pint of cold water to each lb. of meat, and 1 pint over to allow for boiling away. Cut the meat off the bones and into small pieces and chop up the bones. Put all into a pan with the cold water and bring gradually to the boil, add ^ tea- spoonful salt, skim, and then add vegetables:â€”1 large carrot, 1 onion, 2 leeks, ^ turnip, ^ head of celery, and some parsley. Also 2 cloves, a few peppercorns, some thyme, and a bay- leaf. Let all boil slowly at least G hours. Strain it through a fine hair - sieve and leave it in a cold place over - night. To clarify it, remove the fat from the surface, and pour the stock carefully into a clean saucepan after removing any im- purities that have settled at the bottom. Dissolve it by gentle heat. Add the whisked whites of 2 eggs and their shells washed and crushed up and ^ lb. lean raw beef finely chopped, to each quart; and also a few vegetables to revive the flavour. Whisk quickly until a scum forms and then leave the stock partly un- covered, to simmer very gently for 1 hour. There will be a thick scum on the top now. Pass the soup once, or twice, if necessary, through a cloth, but be careful not to press the cloth in any way, as this would cloud the stock, If not sufficiently flavoured, boil it up with a few peppercorns; the addition of pepper would spoil the clearness. Cut the meat into small pieces, and break up the bones. Put all into a pan with the cold water, and bring to the boil slowly. Skim thoroughly, add the rest of the ingredients, and simmer for 4 hours. Pour through a fine sieve, and remove the fat when cold, The bones may be boiled again for second stock. GOOD WHITE STOCK. 4 lbs. shin of veal. 1 onion. 1 blade mace. 2 quarts water. A fowl, and any poultry bones. A few stalks of celery.

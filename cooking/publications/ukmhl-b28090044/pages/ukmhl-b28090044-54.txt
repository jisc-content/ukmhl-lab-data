Scrape them and cook them, then trim, slice, and otherwise prepare them. Young carrots take from twenty to thirty minutes to cook, according to age and size ; old carrots will take at least an hour’s cooking; whilst large and very old ones, towards the end of their season, may take quite two hours. Carrots need attention, for if overboiled they lose flavour, still they must be cooked till tender. Old carrots when they must be used for an entree, should be cooked whole, then sliced, quartered, or trimmed when tender, and carefully re-heated in sauce or stock to taste. la maitre d'hotel.—Choose your carrots as much of a size as possible, wash and wipe them well, then parboil them for ten minutes in fast boiling water.

Let them cook thus for fifteen to twenty minutes, according to size, until tender, then serve very hot. d la menag'ere.—Wash and well rub a bunch of young carrots, and blanch them as before.

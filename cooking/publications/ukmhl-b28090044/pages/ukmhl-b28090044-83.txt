(Remember that the water in which lentils are boiled, is, like haricot liquor, an excellent foundation for vegetable stock.) Fry a good-sized onion cut in rings in butter till tender, then in the same pan fry half a teaspoonful of mild curry powder for a minute or two, then add three tomatoes, peeled and sliced (canned ones will do), and a heaped teaspoonful of creme de riz (or rice flour), a teaspoonful of curry paste, and half a pint of stock, or preferably cocoanut or almond milk (pour boiling water on the nut, cover the basin, and leave it to infuse till perfectly cold and strongly flavoured, then wring out every drop of liquid and use ; take -ioz. of nut to half a pint of water), add the liquid slowly, stirring it all the time to keep it smooth, then stir in the lentils carefully, with a lump of sugar, the juice of half a lemon, and loz. of butter and let it all stew together till quite thick. Serve in a wall of well-boiled Patna rice. Lentils may also be cooked by any method recommended for haricots.

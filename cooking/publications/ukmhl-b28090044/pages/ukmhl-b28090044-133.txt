For mayonnaise, put into a basin one raw egg yolk, an eggspoonful of mustard (either French or English, or lialf of each), and a pinch each of salt and white pepper; mix this all with a deli- cately clean wooden spoon (a special spoon should always be kept for salad-mixing), adding, drop by drop, enough good oil to bring it all to the consistency of butter, and, lastly, add a teaspoonful or so of best vinegar, plain or flavoured. This will make about half a pint of sauce, and will take up about one-third of a pint of oil. There are, of course, many different forms of mayonnaise, but these have been given with the fancy salads to which they belong. Never, if possible, let a mayonnaise salad stand after it is mixed, or the vegetables will get soppy and sodden ; whilst exposure to the air will give the dressing a most unpleasant, rank flavour.

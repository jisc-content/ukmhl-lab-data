If you are i;sing canned vegetables of any kind, turn them, directly the tin is opened, into a sieve or colander and let the water from the tap run on to them for some time, to remove all trace of the “ tin ” flavour such vegetables almost always acquire. Root vegetables, such as carrots, parsnips, beetroots and potatoes, should be stored in layers of sand (having the latter thick enough to prevent their touching each other in any way) just as they are lifted from the ground.

Formerly in London the onion seller with his long, neatly plaited “ ropes ” of silvery onions, was a common and welcome sight to thrifty house- wives.

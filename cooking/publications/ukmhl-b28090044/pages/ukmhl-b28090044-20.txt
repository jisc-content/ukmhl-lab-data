8 VEGETABLES. These are naturally only for the ordinary boiled vegetables. For more uncommon kinds and dishes. o the proper time will be indicated in the recipes. All green vegetables should be gathered before sunrise or after sunset, as if gathered with the sun on them tliey go stale very soon, and lose their fresh, crisp flavour. Also remember that any cold vegetables make delicious toasts if minced, stirred till hot with butter, cream, or stock, piled on hot buttered toast, well dusted with grated cheese and set in the oven for a minute or two till the cheese is browned. Artichokes (Artichauts).â€”Of these there are three kinds, the Globe, the Jerusalem or sunflower {gira- sole), and the latest addition, the Japanese artichoke, or Stachys tuberifera, introduced and first grown in this country, I believe, by Sir Henry Thompson.

To boil it plainly (as it is most usually seen in this country), the artichoke must first be well soaked in salt and water to remove all insects ; then cut off the stalk close under the head, take off the hard leaves just at. the bottom of the globe, and trim off the sharp tops of the rest.

VEGETABLES. 64 somewhat on the age and the kind of greens, but fifteen to twenty minutes is a fair average. Greens are also excellent if cooked in any way advised for spinach, especially au gratin. Herbs.—Of these there are a great variety, far more being in use formerly than are now acknow- ledged. It is a great pity the use of these is neglected, as by them were obtained the flavours we all admire in foreign cookery, and try to reproduce by the lavish use of cruet sauces of various kinds, which, however, never give the same delicate aroma or savour as the natural herbs do. The herbs in most frequent use are basil (excellent in connection with tomatoes in any shape), chervil, chives, cress, fennel, marjoram, mint, sage, savoury, thyme, and tarragon. To these may be added bay leaves and horseradish, though these are scarcely herbs. Of course herbs are best used fresh, but as this is impossible all the year round, the best plan is to pick them when in perfection, and dry them slowly on sheets of white paper, either in the sun or in very gentle heat, and then powder them finely, putting each sort up sepa- rately in wide-mouthed, closely-stoppered bottles, each labelled with the name of the particular herb. This is both a thriftier and cleaner way of saving them than the old-fashioned method of hanging them in bundles from the kitchen ceiling A tea- spoonful of dried herbs equals a dessertspoonful of fresh ones, measured after they are minced. M. Gouffc recommends the preparation of a special herb mixture for use in stuffings, stews, &c., and the .advice of so noted a chef is not to be despised. “ Pound

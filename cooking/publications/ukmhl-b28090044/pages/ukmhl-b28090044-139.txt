VEGETABLES 127 and leave it at the side of the stove for five minutes or so till the sauce and the cabbage are well blended. Slaw, cold.—For this choose a good, firm head of cabbage, remove the outside and faded leaves, and shred it finely as before; steep it for an hour or so in very cold or iced water, then drain well, and serve either with a French oil and vinegar dressing, or with the hot sauce recommended for hot slaw, only using double the quantities there given and making the sauce in the usual way, and pouring it over the raw shred cabbage instead of mixing it all over the fire. Sorrel {Oseille).—This is such a wholesome vegetable that it is a great pity it is not more commonly used in this country. Abroad veal is seldom seen unless accom- panied by a puree of sorrel. It is best cooked with butter, preparing it thus: Pick it over well, nip off the stalks, and, if thick, tear the midrib from the leaves, tearing these also into shreds if large ; then well wash it in several waters, finally leaving it in a colander under a running tap for a little ; then drain, shake off most of the moisture, and put it in a pan with a dust of sugar and loz. of butter for each quart of picked sorrel, the moisture adhering to the latter being sufficient to cook it, with the butter. Let it cook till well reduced (it reduces a great deal), and when quite tender dust in a little fine flour, stir this over the fire till well mixed, when it must be all rubbed through a sieve, reheated, and blended with a little more butter or some cream, or some good veal gravy, and, if liked, a little more sugar.

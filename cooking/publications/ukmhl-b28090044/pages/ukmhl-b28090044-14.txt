But in nine cases out of ten they are over-steeped, over-boiled, and lastly im- properly and insufficiently drained, with the results only too unpleasantly familiar to most of us. In cooking vegetables of all kinds certain points demand attention (which too frequently they do not receive), and the first of these is cleanliness. All root vegetables, such as potatoes, carrots, etc., require to be well scrubbed and then thoroughly rinsed in fresh clean water, before being peeled, or otherwise prepared for the pot. All vegetables which may contain insects, such as cauli- flowers, cabbages, etc., should be thoroughly soaked in well salted water, and then well rinsed. Seakale, salsify, and celery need special attention in washing to get rid of sand and gravel between the stalks, in consequence of the way they are earthed up. When thoroughly cleansed by washing, etc., remove all withered and discoloured leaves, and any trace of decay or discolouration. Potatoes unless new (when they only require to be well scrubbed with a coarse cloth) should be peeled very thinly. Turnips, on the contrary, should be thickly peeled, as their rind is hard and wooden. Carrots, unless very old, merely require scraping; the same rule applies to salsify, whilst scorzanera, like beetroot, should not be peeled till cooked. All root vegetables peeled or scraped before cooking should be thrown into cold water till wanted, and in the case of white vegetables, such as artichokes, celery, cardoons, salsify, etc., this cold water should be noticeably salted

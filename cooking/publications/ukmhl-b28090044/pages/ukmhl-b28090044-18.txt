VEGETABLES. 6 either hot or cold, and the jardiniere. For the hot macedoine, take equal quantities of carrots and turnips cut into balls or olives with a scoop, French beans cut into lozenges, peas, fresh flageolets, and asparagus points or sprue cut to the size of peas ; cook these all separately in salted water, adding to this a little sugar in the case of carrots, turnips, and peas. When ready (mind they are not over done), drain well, mix them and serve; or else toss them in a very little melted butter or appropriate sauce, according to what they are to accompany. Or, cut some carrots, potatoes and turnips to match some small pickling or silver onions (having equal parts of each), boil these separately, and, when cooked and drained, toss them all together in a saucepan with a good pat of butter, till glazed, and keep hot till Avanted. These macedoines may be served mixed, or each kind in a separate little heap, as preferred. It is not necessary to have all, or indeed any, of the vegetables given above, for you may use any sorts you think most suitable, only bearing in mind that for a macedoine there must be at least three kinds. If to be served cold cook the A^egetables as above plainly, and leave them, when thoroughly drained, till cold, when they are mixed together with either an oil or vinegar dressing or mayonnaise sauce. A little fresh liquid aspic may be added in this case, so that they will dish rockily. The difference between a jardiniere and a macedoine garnish lies chiefly (generally) in the way the vegetables are cut, and indeed the names are interchangeable Avith most chefs, though a jardiniere is always a hot garnish, Avhereas, as said above, the macedoine may be served hot or cold.

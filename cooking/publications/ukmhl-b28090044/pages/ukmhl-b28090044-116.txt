Test them with a skewer, and as soon as this pierces them easily they are ready; now strain the water off them at once (if left in the water after this point they are apt to burst), shake the saucepan lightly, and set it at the side of the stove, remove the lid, replace it by a folded clean cloth or napkin, and let them stand for five minutes or so, by which time, if the potatoes are of a good kind, they will be quite dry and floury. Now take them up, peel them quickly, and send to the table at once. If preferred they may be served unpeeled, or “ in their jackets ” as it is called, which is the Irish, and certainly the best, way of serving them. The reason for giving potatoes plenty of water to cook in is that all starchy things, as they are, need plenty of room to swell in, and if crushed together in a small quantity of water, are very apt to burst. When potatoes are old they must be peeled before cooking, and, moreover, must have the “ eyes ” and bruises cut out of them. In this case fill the saucepan with cold salted water, trim and peel the potatoes, dropping each as done into the pan 5 now just bring this all to the boil, and let it all simmer for twenty minutes or more, according to size, then strain oft’ the water and either finish as before, or strain, shake oft any moisture left on them, and serve at once as they are. In Ireland potatoes are always cooked in their jackets, and for this purpose are put on in an iron pot, with a good supply of salted water, and boiled till the skins crack .•

VEGETABLES. 101 sprays of mint, or half a head of lettuce tied up together; add white pepper and salt to taste; let this cook till the onion is very faintly coloured, when you add the peas, a small teaspoonful of sugar, and as much water, or stock, as will float them ; half a pint is suthcient for one and a half pints of peas. Now let them stew very gently till the peas are perfectly tender (young peas take half an hour thus), then remove the lettuce, onions, and parsley, thicken the liquid with a little white roux (or ^oz. each of butter and flour simmered together till perfectly smooth and well blended), shake the saucepan well to mix all this thoroughly, add, if necessary, a tiny dust of caster sugar, and serve. French cooks often stir in at the last the yolk of an egg beaten up with a little milk, instead of the Hour and butter thickening. They also put in the onion whole, for the convenience of lifting it out. Peas cooked in this way are known as Petits pois a la Franfaise, or a la Bourgeoise. Peas en puree.—This is the best form of cooking old peas. Boil them as described above, preferably in the pea pod water, till tender enough to sieve, then add a tablespoonful of cream, ^-oz. or so of butter, a little freshly ground black pepper, salt, and a dust of sugar, and use either as a mould or forced out with a pipe and bag. salad.—Cold boiled peas may be utilised as an extremely pleasant salad, either by themselves, or in conjunction with young carrots, &c., and either a French dressing, or a good mayonnaise sauce. Thus treated they are an effective addition to a dish of lamb cutlets en Bellevue or en Chaufroix.

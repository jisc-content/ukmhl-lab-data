Cold cooked hops make a deli- cious salad if left on ice, and then served with'a French or mayonnaise dressing. Hops, fried. — Scrape the shoots a little, well wash, and three-parts boil them in acidulated salted water, then drain, sprinkle with salt, and leave till perfectly cold. Then flour them, dip in beaten egg and fresh breadcrumbs, and fry a golden brown in boiling fat. Serve plain, sprinkled with salt, or with any sauce to taste, handed separately. Horseradish (Raifort).—This is chiefly used as a condiment or a garnish, but is seldom if ever cooked. For garnish choose a young tender root, scrub it well, and scrape it down finely into tiny shavings. It is also added to various sauces as described else- where. It may be kept fresh for a considerable time by burying it in sand in a cool place. Or, again, it may be sliced, and these slices dried very slowly in a slack oven, or before the fire, till fit to pound, after which the result is sifted, bottled, and labelled as mentioned for dried herbs. Accidents have happened before now from inexperienced cooks mistaking monk’s-hood or aconite root for horse- radish with deadly effect, therefore the former should never be allowed to grow anywhere near the latter. Cooks should also know that there is a marked difi’e- rence usually in the roots, the aconite being cone- shaped, tapering rapidly to a point, whereas the horseradish root is like a cylinder, long and of even size for a considerable part of its length.

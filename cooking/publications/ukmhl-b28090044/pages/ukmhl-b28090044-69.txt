VEGETABLES. 57 blended (or take an equivalent amount of white roux) and moisten with about a gill of milk or single cream, season to taste with salt and Avhite pepper, then stir in the yolks and whites of two eggs beaten separately, and lastly the grains cut from four or five ears of cold boiled (or canned) Indian corn, and bake twenty minutes in a shallow piedish. Corn, Indian, omelet.—Grate the grains from six boiled cobs, and mix this pulp with three eggs whipped as for an omelet, and finish in the usual way, after seasoning it to taste with salt, pepper, and minced parsley. stewed.—Grate enough uncooked green corn to make a heaping cupful, add one quarter of a cupful of new milk, a dust of flour, pepper and salt to taste, and a teaspoonful of butter.^ Bring it slowly to the boil, lifting it off directly that point is reached, and serve. Cold cooked or canned corn may be served thus, but should be added to the boiling milk, &c., and only just stirred over the fire till perfectly hot, without further cooking. oysters.—Pour off the liquid from a can of Indian corn, and mash the corn finely in a mortar, dredging it, as you pound, with wheat flour. Now mix in two well-beaten eggs, gradually, beating it all thoroughly, and seasoning it with a saltspoonful of salt and a little essence of anchovy. Shape the mixture quenelle fashion, with two small teaspoons, into little oval cakes, one inch thick, and fry a golden brown in plenty of hot fat (half butter, half lard, being considered the best friture). This is an American recipe.

Price i6/6 The storing of the small quantity of Vegetables that must be kept in every well organised Household (such, for instance, as Carrots, Turnips, Onions, &c.) is a troublesome matter. The articles are ordinarily all crowded together, becoming stale, or decaying, to the detriment of the rest of the provisions. It is to obviate this unwholesome method that the Hygienic Vegetable Rack has been devised; it takes up very little room and can be stood on the floor or hung on the wall. There are four separate bins which enables the vegetables to be kept apart, all the dust &c., falls to the ground and can be swept up, whilst the open wire reveals any single article which may have become unfit for use, thereby ensuring its instant removal.

Lima {butter beans).—These are, when fresh and young, cooked whole, in plain salted water, then drained and served with a pat of butter, a squeeze of lemon juice, white pepper, and salt. But when dried, soak, say, a breakfast cupful of the beans for two ^o four hours (some cooks soak them all night), then drain well and cook in plenty of boiling salted water till tender, which they should be in an hour. Then turn them out on to a hot vegetable dish with some morsels of butter, toss them together till this is melted, and serve hot. These beans are usually ■chosen for the well-known American dish of baked beans and pork. For this you soak a pint of the beans overnight, and boil them next day for about three- quarters of an hour in a pint of salted water, then lift them out when the skin breaks easily, drain them well, put half into a pipkin (in xVmerica a proper bean-pot is used), lay on this about ^Ib. of salt pork after scoring the rind well, cover it with the rest of the beans, sprinkle with salt and pepper, then pour over them a tablespoonful of molasses and enough salted water to cover them, put the lid on closely, and bake in a slow oven for six to eight hours. The white haricot beans may also be used for this, but then use white sugar instead of the molasses, and bake for nearly double the time.

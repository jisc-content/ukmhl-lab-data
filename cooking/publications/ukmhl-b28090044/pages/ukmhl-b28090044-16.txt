VEGETABLES. 4 sink pipe, no subsequent rinsing will remove the smell this, however, is a mistake, as, if poured down the sink directly it is strained off the cabbage, whilst still boiling hot, it will cause no inconvenience ; though to make doubly sure a jugful of hot water may be poureil after it. All vegetables that may have a bitter flavour, sucli as turnip-tops, greens, etc., should be either blanched {i.e. put on in cold water which is brought thoroughly to the boil, then poured off, the vegetables being at once re-covered with absolutely boiling water), or when half-boiled the water may be poured off and replaced in the same way. This methed of cooking applies most especially to such things as turnip-tops, endive, dandelion, or cabbage, which are occasionally most unpleasantly acrid. But, if the bull may be forgiven, boiled vegetables are best when not boiled at all, but simply steamed. It is easy enough to do this, especially if the very useful little “ Eapid ” steamer, procurable for a few pence at most good ironmongers, be amongst the kitchen utensils. For steaming, salt the water as usual, and add to it a good bouquet of herbs (parsley, green onions, bay leaf, etc.), then lay the vegetables carefully trimmed, washed and dried, on the little steamer, and steam them steadily till cooked, when they are lifted out, well drained, and served on a very hot vegetable dish. Treated in this way, the commonest “ greens ” will be a revelation to most people. A point to remember is that age and condition affect the time of cooking very mueh. A stale, half withered vegetable takes twdce as long to dress properly, even granting it can be brought back to decent condition.

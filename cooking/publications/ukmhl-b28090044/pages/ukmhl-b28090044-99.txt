VEGETABLES. !S7 are mostly used in the preparation of (/u7iibo or okra soup. When procurable green, and young, they may be cooked in several vays, after the first boiling. Boiled okras.—Fov this well wash, drain, and trim the okras neatly at both ends, then plunge them in fast boiling salted water, and let them cook for fifteen minutes or so till tender ; now drain and serve them with cream, tomato, veloutth or any sauce to taste.

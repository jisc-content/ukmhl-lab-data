When cauliflowers are small or ill-grown, cook them as above, then arrange them head down in a pudding basin of suitable size (previously scalded out with boiling water), arranging the florets neatly, press them gently into shape, tlien lay the dish on top of the basin, reverse the latter quickly, and remove it; the cauliflower should turn out in a compact tidy head. When served thus the sauce sent up with it may be poured over as well as round it, for cauli- flowers needing such treatment are seldom of a good colour.

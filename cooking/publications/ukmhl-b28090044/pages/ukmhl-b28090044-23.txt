VEGETABLES. 11 preparation is this : Trim the artichokes as before, and boil for twenty minutes in salted and acidulated water ; the stamens and small inner leaves should now lift out easily, then with a silver spoon remove the choke, fill the cavity thus left with any farce to taste, introducing a little also between the leaves, and tie each up closely to keep in the stuffing, place them close together on a baking tin, pour sufficient olive oil over them to insure each being properly moistened, and bake for about half an hour, then remove the strings and serve. If you make a d'uxelles (equal quantities of onion and shallots, minced, with double the quantity of raw minced mushrooms, seasoned with pepper and salt and some finely minced parsley, all fried together in butter), add to this a little bacon minced (say a small slice for each artichoke), and use for the farce, the artichokes will be a la barigoule ; if you mince some washed and boned anchovies with a shallot or two (according to quantity), and a very little powdered thyme, pepper, and salt, a few freshly made breadcrumbs, and a few drops of oil to moisten it all, and use this as the stuffing, they become d VItalienne ; if you mince three well cleansed large fresh mushrooms, and mix it with a slice or so of ham also minced, half a small onion fried and minced, |oz. grated cheese, a full teaspoonful of mixed and finely minced herbs, with the crumb of a French roll previously soaked in milk or stock, and a tiny dust of grated nutmeg, and use this for the farce, they become A. a la Parmesane ; in short any dainty forcemeat can be used in this way and served as A. far CIS.

VEGETABLES. 25 lengthways, and treated exactly as described for fried aubergines. Basil (Basilic).—A favourite seasoning herb on the continent, where it generally is connected with tomatoes, whose flavour it is supposed greatly to enhance. In this country it is chiefly used amongst the herbs added to turtle, mock turtle, and other gelatinous soups. Basil vinegar, (made like tarragon vinegar) is often added to salad dressings. Bay Leaf (Feuille de laurier).—These are much used for flavouring, and generally appear in the bouquet garni. Best used fresh, but if gathered in the summer, tied in bunches, and hung up in a warm dry place in a paper bag to keep off the dust, they are very useful. A very good extract may be made, when leaves are plentiful, by packing them pretty tightly in a bottle and pouring on to them sufficient rectified spirit to cover them well; let this stand ten days, then bottle off and seal. This gives a nice flavour, but must be used carefully, or it may give a slightly resinous taste. Beans.—Of these there are, in this country at least, really only two kinds of fresh beans, the broad bean and the haricot bean, the last being divided into two varieties, the dwarf or French bean, and the scarlet runner. Besides these there are the dried beans, the flageolets, the haricot or Soissons beans, the Lima or butter bean (very good fresh, but seldom or ever seen in that state in this country), and the South American black bean, also known as frijoles. Broad' Beans (Feves de marais).—These must never be cooked when old, as they are then fit for nothing

VEGETABLES. ()7 Kohl-Rabi {Chou-rave). Tliis vegetable, also known as the turnip-rooted cabbage, is excellent, though little used. It should be cut young, when it is like, but more delicate than, the turnip. It may be cooked like a turnip, or is particularly good cut into balls, cones, or small egg-shapes, three-parts boiled in acidulated salted water, and finished off in butter, being served at once with a dust of salt and freshly- ground black pepper. It is also good if mashed like turnip, mixed with a little flour to make it thick enough to roll, shaped into balls in your well-floured hands, egged and breadcrumbed, and fried a golden brown in hot fat. Laver.—This seaweed grows on many parts of the coast, and is particularly good stewed. It is in con- dition in late autumn or winter. Wash it in cold water till thoroughly free from sand, grit, &c., adding a pinch of bicarbonate of soda to the last rinsing water, and letting it steep in water for some hours to remove the bitterness. Now stew it very gently in either rain water or milk till tender, and of the consistency of mucilage, when it may be Served at once ; or can be strained and finished off like spinach ; or when boiled to a dark green colour it may be lightly seasoned with salt, and when cold stored away in closely-covered earthenware pots, when it will keep from fifteen to thirty days in a cool place. It will then only need,re-heating with a pat of butter, a squeeze of lemon juice, and a little white pepper. Laver has many local names, such as dulse, sloke (in Scotland), stoke (Ireland), or ribbon weed. Leeks {Poireaux).—Well boil and wash the leeks, F 2

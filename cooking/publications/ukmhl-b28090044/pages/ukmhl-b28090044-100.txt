VEGETABLES. 8S to taste. As a garnish, the olive is usually served as a ragout, thus : Stone the olives and set them in a pan with enough good stock and light French wine (in equal parts) to cover them, just bring.this to the boil again, then simmer gently till tender. This makes a delicious sauce for fillets or tournedos of beef, and is the proper sauce for salmi of duck, wild or tame. Save for salmi, brown sauce and a little sherrv may replace the stock and the French wine. Olives, mock.—Choose small unripe green plums, and stone them with a column cutter. Put them into a jar with vine leaves between them, dust with a little fennel seed, a good amount of salt, and a tiny pinch of powdered alum, pour over them sufficient boiling oil to cover them, and when cold tie down. If plums prepared thus are stuffed with fillets of anchovy or sardine, packed in jars, and covered with good spiced vinegar, they make a by no means to be despised version of olives farcies. Onions (Oignons).—These, unlike other vegetables, need no cleansing beyond the removal of the stalk and top ends, and of one or two of the outer skins. But they do need blanching, a point often overlooked by our cooks, and hence the accusation of coarseness often brought against this vegetable. As soon as they are trimmed, blanch them by putting them on in slightly salted cold water, and as soon as this boils up strain it off, and if to be served plain boiled, finish boiling the onions in fresh salted boiling water till cooked, which will take, for large Spanish onions, from two to three hours, smaller ones of course taking proportionately less.

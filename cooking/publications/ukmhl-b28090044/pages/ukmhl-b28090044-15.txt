Unless specially directed to the contrary, put all vegetables on in salted boiling water ; boil root vegetables in a covered pan, and green vegetables of all kinds, whether foliage, stalks, seeds, or pods, in an uncovered pan. Many cooks advise tlie addition of a little soda to the boiling water, whilst others actually put in a copper penny to ensure the vivid colour of all green vegetables, but this is neither whole- some, nor necessary. If young vegetables are chosen (and even on economic grounds no other should be used), and if an untinned, uncovered pan (from which the steam can easily escape) be chosen, and plenty of boiling water be allowed, there will be no difficulty about the colour. To salt the water one or two full tablespoonfuls or a ^oz. to loz. of salt to each gallon of water, is the right allowance, to which may be added, for green vegetables, one-third this amount of sugar, to enhance the flavour. Peas especially are improved l)v this addition. The more water used in boiling V O cabbages, greens, etc., the less offensive will be the odour given out by them. A piece of bread tied up in a muslin bag and boiled with the cabbage is said to be a remedy against the smell, but this cannot be relied on. After about fifteen minutes boiling this crust should be removed and burnt at once. Unless the water in which the cabbage was boiled is wanted for vegetable stock (remember it forms a basis for two or three French soups, notably sowpe aux choux au, /romagre), it should be poured away at once, whilst still hot.

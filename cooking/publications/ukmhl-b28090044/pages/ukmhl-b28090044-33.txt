When nicely browned on both sides send to table on a hot dish, sprinkled with a little salt, and freshly ground black pepper. stuffed.—Scoop the centre of the fruit out and fill it with any nice mince (such as you would use for stuffed tomatoes), raising it in a dofiie shape and scattering it with browned sifted breadcrumbs, bake for twenty-five to thirty minutes. Or, peel and halve the aubergines, remove the centre, and mince this finely with some chives, parsley, the pulp of a tomato or two (according to the number cooked), minced parsley, the yolk of one or more hard-boiled eggs, some well-washed and boned anchovies minced, a little grated Parmesan cheese, and some crumb of bread scalded either in boiling stock or seasoned boiling water, and squeezed fairly dry. Stuff the aubergine with this mixture, dust with sifted and browned crumbs, sprinkle with oil, set in a baking tin with a little oil and water in it, and bake in the oven.

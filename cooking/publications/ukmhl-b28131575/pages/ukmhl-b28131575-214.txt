OPINIONS OF THE PRESS. :o: COURT JOURNAL. “ Massey & Son’s ‘ Comprehensive Pudding Book,’ published by Simpkin, Marshall & Co., contains the Recipes for making one thousand puddings. The idea is unique of its kind, and doubtless in the economical home it will be a treasure, and in the grandest, worth being bought to be sent down stairs. A thousand puddings! The thousand and one nights of Arabian origin are as nothing to excite the imagination in comparison with thi^.feast of the thought. A thousand puddings! The sensation of the world would be to have a banquet at which the thousand puddings here enumerated were all served up at once.” COURT CIRCULAR. “ Beautiful designs in sugar work, treated with great spirit and skill. They appear to be accomplished cooks.” GLOWORM. “ Massey & Son’s ‘ Biscuit, Ice, and Compote Book,’ the work just pub- lished by Messrs. Massey, will be a source of delight to a large portion of the public. The work is elegantly ‘ got up,’ and its contents admirably arranged. The work has evidently been carefully compiled, and should find a place in every household.” WEEKLY TIMES. “ One thousand recipes for puddings comprised in two hundred pages may certainly be called a ‘ Comprehensive Pudding Book.’ • Steamed puddings, boiled puddings, and puddings baked and fried, may, by the help of these recipes, be obtained in wonderful variety, and those who are fond of a continuous change of diet may have a new pudding every day for three years. The necessary sauces for the thousand puddings are also given, and altogether this is the most complete book of the kind we have ever seen.”

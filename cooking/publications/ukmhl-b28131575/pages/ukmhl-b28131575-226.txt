E. M. BAGOT’S PURE EXTRACT OF MEAT {BY APPOINTMENT TO THE ADMIRALTY), PEEPARED WITHOUT THE AID OE AHT CHEMICALS WHATEVER. EXTRACT from “ THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL.” April 15, 1876. BAGOT’S EXTRACT OE MEAT. We have had before us recently samples of Bagot’s Australian Extract of Meat, together with certificates of analyses, and reports and results of trials by the late Dr. Parkes. The abundance of authentic evidence from the great public establishments and hos- pitals in which it has been tried, dispenses with the necessity of further analyses. It results from these documents that this extract has, in the opinion of many eminent experts and practical autho- rities, great and peculiar advantages, especially in superiority of fiavour, greater nutritious value, absence of excessive saltiness, and relative cheapness. It certainly makes excellent beef-tea; and, from the above qualities, it has been specially ordered for use in the recent Arctic expedition, and is generally largely favoured in the public institutions and by the officers of the public services who have tested it. The samples forwarded to us by Messrs. Ledger and Co., Lant Street, who are the chief agents, are very satisfactory in fiavour and quality, and the body of evidence on all heads in ita favour is conclusive as to its merits.” N.B.—Samples forwarded on application.

APPENDIX. SCOTCH HAGGIS. As some of our Scotch friends have been particularly dis- appointed that our book does not contain an “ haggis,” and even affirmed that it was not “ comprehensive ” without it, we took the subject into serious consideration, and ultimately came to the conclusion that an haggis is a 'pudding, and as such demands a place in our “ Comprehensive Pudding Book.” Make the haggis-bag perfectly clean, and parboil the pluck; boil the liver well so that it will grate; mince the pluck and two pounds of beef very small, grate about half of the liver, mince three-quarters of a pound of suet and some onions small, mix these well together with a handful or two of dried meal, spread it on a table, and season well with pepper, salt, and mixed spice; mix with about a quart of good gravy, and put into the bag, but be sure to press out all the wind before you sew it quite close. If you think the bag is too thin, put it into a cloth, to prevent it from bm’sting. If it is a large haggis, it will take about two hours boiling. OSWEGO BAKED PUDDING. Poudmg cuit aufour d VOsvjego.

Souchong, ‘‘small plant.” Twankey is the name of a small river in the region where it is bought; and Congou is from a term signifying “ labour ” from the great care required in its pre- paration. In pressing the best green Tea a most extraordinary effect is produced which certainly proves the purity of the Tea and the power of hydraulics. Pure uncoloured green Tea is really of a brown colour, but after being subjected to a pressure of loo or 196 tons (but I suppose a score or two of tons, more or less, does not much signify) the virgin green of the leaf is brought to the surface, and the quarter pound block of Tea is a pure bright green. I will now, in as few words as possible, explain how myself and brothers, trading under the title of “ The Brothers Massey,” came to be connected with this Tea as agents. We were established in a business facing Battersea Park, and in 1873 exhibited at the International Exhibition, South Kensington, some beautiful speci- mens of our work in “ Pastilglacion,” our new combination of Sugar work, which I am happy to say stood unrivalled there by either English or foreign artists, and has continued to be unrivalled ever since. Near to our case, in the East Quadrant of that rather wilderness of a building, stood a case of Solid Tea, which, as exhibitors, we saw a good deal of—we tried it ourselves, and were so struck with the result of the trial that we took the local agency lor it; and in the course of twelve months we had successfully overcome the prejudice which all new articles excite, and made a good trade of it.

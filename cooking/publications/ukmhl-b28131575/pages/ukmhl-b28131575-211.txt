TO H O XJ S E HL E E E K. S - MASSEY & SON’S BISCUIT, ICE, & COMPOTE BOOK, IS! OR 11SM Owing to the great success of onr first publication, ‘‘ The Comprehensive Pudding Book,’’ we have been induced to publish ‘^The Biscuit, Ice, and Compote Book,” which may truly be said to contain the very essence of confectionery. Biscuits, Ices, and Compotes are all the modern housekeeper is expected to do: our work enters upon these subjects, and to the fullest extent; it contains new receipts, and many good old ones, never before PUBLISHED. As to bon-bons, candies, comfits, &c., they are cheaper to buy than to make at home, therefore they are always BOUGHT ; under these circumstances it is mere waste of money to buy a large, cumbersome, and expensive book on confectionery. Our object in the present pub- lication (as in our last) has been to fill the work with MATTER, and not to lengthen the book and price with mere words. This principle, we have reason to believe, is fully appreciated by our readers, as the recipes, being written in a concise style, do not confuse them by their verbosity; while it materially tends to produce a cheap and PERFECT book.

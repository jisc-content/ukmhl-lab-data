SPECIAL NOTICE .—It is most important that all the Soups are prepared with boiling water only, salt being previously added to it, and boil gently according to Directions given with each Soup. Analytical Report of the “LAUCET,” May 13, 1876. “These Soups are sold in the dry state, the Consomme in tablets, the others either in small grains or in cakes with vegetables. They are wonderfully cheap, and the accounts we have received of their manufacture and rapidly increasing consumption are so interesting that we have thought it right to submit them to a somewhat careful examination. The basis of the soup is meat extract, but the meat is mixed with vegetables during extraction and before concentration. The concentrated extract is either sold in the dry state, or is granulated V7ith Semolina, Tapioca, &c., &c. It is only necessary to boil one of these preparations with water for a few minutes and a soup of excellent quality is obtained at a cost of not more than Ijd. per head. We have analysed several samples and our results confirm the accuracy of the published statements. The Soups are, we think, likely to be very generally useful, pai-ticularly in the summer, when all unnecessary cooking should be avoided as much as possible. They arc* indeed sure to be as popular in the kitchen as in the dining-room.

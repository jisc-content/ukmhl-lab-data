IX PREFACE ROYAL PHILHARMONIC THEATRE. After which we exhibited a wedding and twelfth cake at THE INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION, 1873 ; the tweKth cake, surmounted by a perfect transformation fairy scene, was the only specimen of this class of work in either the English or Foreign Courts, and for which we received the MEDAL. We then modelled a scene from the Happy Lancia which was exhibited for a long time at the ROYAL COURT THEATRE; after which we took in hand the rather formidable task of making a set of eight ball supper stands, for the season 1874, on the same principle as the set we used at the Earl of Fife’s in 1863, when the PRINCE AND PRINCESS OF WALES were entertained there at the Braemar gathering. These last are greatly improved, each stand is worth about ten guineas, and represents a scene from one of the popular French operas, thus displaying our work in several varieties of scenery, and great diversity and richness of costumes and accessories. They consist of:— 1. —La Fille de Madame Angot [Lecocq). The Jardin de Calypso ^in Paris, illuminated. The quarrel between Mademoiselle Lange and Clairette. 2. —Grenevieve de Brabant {Offenbach). Exterior of the Duke’s Place—Drogan Serenading the Duchess. 3. —La Grrande Duchesse {Offenbach). A Eichly Fur- nished Boudoir. The Duchess and Fritz tete-d-Ute.

PREFACE. When we first published our “Comprehensive Pudding Book,” of ONE THOUSAND PUDDINGS, we had a due sense of the importance and utility to the Profession of the work we took in hand, but were hardly prepared for the large sale which followed, after the first struggle for publicity which all new works have to pass through was successfully overcome. The advantages of such a work are obvious to any prac- tical mind, when we state that, although no cookery book yet published contains many more than forty or fifty pud- dings, we present above one thousand to select from daily; these puddings, besides many original novelties of our own, have been compiled with great care and labour from the best new and old works of English, Ereneh, Grerman, Rus- sian, Spanish, Italian, and other culinary authors, and are classified for easy reference into SIXTEEN DIVISIONS, which comprise almost every hot or cold, sweet or savoury, pudding. From the plain steamed, boiled, or baked pud- dings, to the elegant ice puddings, delicate fritter, light souffle and cheese fondue puddings ; and from the patri- cian boudin to the plebeian black and white puddings of humble life, every one has its place.

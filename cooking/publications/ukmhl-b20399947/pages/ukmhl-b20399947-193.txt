SAVOURIES 181 sprig of chervil which has been dipped into mayonnaise. Cut hard-boiled eggs in quarters and lay round the toma- toes, and garnish with chopped aspic and chervil leaves placed at equal distances on it, or arranged in a wreath of the chopped aspic. Tomatoes, Baked.—Cut some tomatoes in halves ; sprinkle them with breadcrumbs, salt, pepper, and little bits of butter. Place them in a baking pan with the cut side upwards, and bake in an oven for an hour. Serve with curled parsley. Tomatoes, Fricasseed.—Wash some tomatoes, and cut them in two, but do not peel them. Put them into a pan with half a teaspoonful of butter. Season them with pepper and salt, and flour them. Cover with a plate, and cook them for ten minutes, stirring them once. Pour in half a teacupful of cream just as they are done. Let them boil up, and dish them while hot. Turnip Turnovers.—Peel a number of turnips and cut in thin slices ; pepper and salt them; put in a small bit of bacon. Koll out any scraps of pastry there may be, fill with the mixture, turn over and bake. May be eaten hot or cold. Vegetable Marrow a TEspagnole.—Slice a Spanish onion and two good-sized tomatoes and fry them in about half an ounce of butter. Then cut a vegetable marrow into neat square pieces; add a little hot stock and peppered salt. Let all simmer together till the marrow is cooked, and serve very hot. Vegetable Marrow a I'ltalienne.—Take a couple of vegetable marrows as nearly the same size as possible, slice them as thin as a cucumber is sliced, dry them on a cloth, and fry them in very hot butter, with pepper and salt, and serve. The fat must be very hot as they are cooked in a minute. A little Parmesan cheese shaken over them whilst frying is an improvement.

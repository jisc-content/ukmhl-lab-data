243 MENUS " Montrez-moi ton menu et je te montrerai ton coeur." ''Dishes alike delightful and digestible." The Caterer some time ago had a paper respecting which was right, " bill of fare " or menu. Now they neither mean quite the same thing. The menu is the fare, the bill of fare tells what the fare consists of; the menu is the " lay- out," the bill of fare is the itemised description of the " lay out." People meet and discuss the menu, but they do not discuss the bill of fare. Nevertheless, either word may be chosen with propriety; Tmnu is thought to be the smartest of the two, and is generally preferred to head the dinner list. The origin of having menus, it is said, emanates from Germany. There is a story that the Duke of Brunswick, when sitting at one of those sumptuous feasts connected with the German E-eichstag, was noticed to look attentively at a long slip of paper by the side of his plate ; and when his neighbour, Couat Montford, asked what he was so intently studying, the duke answered, " the master of the kitchen " had drawn up for him and his stomach's benefit a list of all the dishes, just to enable him to reserve his apetite for the best things. The other guests were so well pleased with this idea that the habit of writing out bills of fare instantly spread in Germany. This dinner took place at Regensburg, in 1541. It may not be out of place to remark that cuisine also has a double sense, meaning both cooking and kitchen. La cuisine is the kitchen, but when it is said that any- body is famed for the excellence of the cuisine it implies cooking.

9 THE LARDER To have a perfect larder it should be tiled with glazed tiles or slates, so that it can be sluiced down constantly; but, of course, tiled larders are not often to be found. There should be plenty of strong iron hooks in the ceiling, and separate wire safes for vegetables and fruits. The hooks should be placed at sufficient distances apart to prevent the hanging meat or poultry from touch- ing, and everything on the shelves should stand on dishes with wire covers over them to keep the contents free from the depredations of mice and flies, the latter of which are such scourges that often the meat and other condiments get tainted and fly-blown from them. The Crimean plan to catch the flies is about the best I know of. Half fill a tumbler with strong soapsuds, cover the top with a piece of paper well smeared with treacle or honey, and in the centre make a small hole just large enough for the flies to crawl in; the gas from the soapsuds draws them down and the glass soon becomes thick with them. The larder floor is best made of bricks, and should be washed twice a week at least and dusted with sanitas powder; it is also well to have one of the sanitas perforated boxes hung up, as it keeps the atmosphere pure and free from the smells which emanate from raw meat. Besides, if the atmosphere of the larder in which meat is kept is impure, it is well known that severe gastric poisoning is the result. Meat, poultry, game, and various kinds of fish become poisonous by their own decomposition when kept too long, and as an article in the Hospital says : "It does not seem to be generally understood that meat and other articles that are usually stored in pantries and larders give off exhalations, which settle down upon walls, floors, ceilings, and any tables or vessels that may be present, and also, at the same time, charge the larder with concentrated poison !" It is therefore most necessary to keep meat and other things perfectly wholesome, that the floors, walls, and ceilings, as well as tables, shelves, and utensils, should be kept scrupulously clean, and whitewashed with quicklime once a year, and that fresh air should be admitted night and day.

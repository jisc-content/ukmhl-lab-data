To clarify butter, place it in an enamelled pan, and stand it in another pan containing boiling water. When the butter has become perfectly liquefied, remove the scum from the top. Then leave the butter to get perfectly cold and firm, when it can be taken out and the butter-milk, water, etc., will be found at the bottom of the pan, and any foreign matter may be scraped oft.

The hair sieve should be cleaned with a small wash brush to brush out any of the curd that might remain sticking to it. The skimming dish should be well scalded to remove any cream that may adhere to it. Butter keeps better on a cool dry dish than in water. Where butter is too salt it should be washed in clean

123 FISH Turbot a la Normande.—Butter a fire-proof china fish dish, strew it with chopped onions. Season the turbot with pepper and salt; lay it on the dish, and cover it with sauterne or chablis, and bake. When done, add a little white sauce to the liquor, reduce it, and add the yolk of an egg. Put a few cooked mushrooms and half a dozen oysters round the turbot, pour the sauce over, and make hot again in the oven without browning it. Turbot a la Koyal.—Prepare a turbot in the usual mode, and dish it up with a circle of fried smelts round it. Then garnish si:^ hdteleis with small flat quenelles, breadcrumbed and fried a pale colour ; then put on each a small ring of fillet of sole piqued with gherkins, and on that place a truffle and then a crayfish. Serve in a sauceboat, champagne sauce mixed with a little butter, a little anchovy, sliced truffles, and some oysters boiled in their own liquor. White Bait.—In season, July, August, and September. This delicate little fish requires great care to dress it well. Do not touch them with the hands, but throw them from your dish or basket into a cloth, with three or four handfuls of flour, and shake them well, doing a few at a time. Then put them into the frying basket, and immerse it into a pan of boiling fat for about a minute and a half; then turn them out reversed on to a sieve to drain, and cover with kitchen paper. After drying them for a minute or two before the fire sprinkle a little salt on them, and send them at once to table. To devil them after they are cooked, place them in the frying basket again and plunge into the fat, and make it reboil for a minute till they are crisp; turn them out and dust them quickly with cayenne, tossing them lightly together, and serve at once.

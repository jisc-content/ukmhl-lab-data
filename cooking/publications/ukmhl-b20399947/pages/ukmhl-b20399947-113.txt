SOUP MAKING 101 included) cut into two or three pieces; three-quarters of a pound of mixed vegetables, such as onions, carrots, turnips, leeks, white cabbage, etc., celery with its leaves left on, all cut in good-sized pieces, three small spoonfuls of salt, one of pepper and one of sugar ; add eight pints of water, let it boil gently three hours, remove the fat, add crusts of roll or slices of bread, either previously toasted or plain, and serve. Potage a la Cussy.—Slice and fry six Spanish onions in butter, with a dredge of castor sugar till they are of a pale gold colour. Then put them into a stewpan with as much boiling milk as will make the required quantity of soup, and after it has come to the boil, season with pepper and salt, let it simmer for half an hour, pass the soup through a sieve, and serve with little croictons of fried bread, dipped into grated Parmesan cheese. Royal Soup.—Mix the yolks of six eggs, with rather less than one gill of cold water and a pinch of salt; strain the mixture and divide it into three equal parts; colour one with some cochineal, the other with spinach greening, and leave the third plain. Put them into three small plain moulds, previously buttered, and set these in a pan of hot water, place on the fire to boil just long enough to set the mixture. When the water in the saucepan has become quite cold turn out the contents of each mould on to a wet napkin, and you will have three small cakes of firm custard, respectively green, red, and yellow. Cut them into small dice and, handling them in the gentlest possible manner, spread them out on a plate to be kept till wanted. At the time of serving put a clear and well-flavoured consomme into the soup tureen; slip in carefully the custard dice and serve at once. Scotch Broth.—Take some middle cutlets from neck of mutton; trim them ; then take the trimmings and put them into a stewpan, with some of the scraps and small pieces of knuckle of veal; moisten well with good boiling broth, and season with some sticks of celery, leeks, parsley, a very large onion stuck with two cloves, a few slices of turnip cut into dice, and one or two carrots also cut into dice. Let this broth boil gently for three hours, season with salt and pepper, and skim off the fat, When it becomes a good flavour

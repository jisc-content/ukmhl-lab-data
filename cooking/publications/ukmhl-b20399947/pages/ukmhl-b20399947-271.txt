MENUS 259 Picnic Dishes It is always a little difficult to cater for a picnic party, so perhaps a few ideas on the subject may not be out of place here. It is a good plan to have two or three small hampers, instead of those very large ones which offer so many difficulties in getting to the trysting point. Hampers should always have straps or handles. One hamper ought to be put aside for the crockery and cutlery, all of which should be plenteously wrapped up in newspapers to prevent breakage. Small brioche rolls filled with force-meat or salmon salads are very desirable. These are hollowed out inside, and then the force-meat is filled in. After filling they can be masked with chaudfroid sauce or mayonnaise aspic. Mayonnaise dressing is best carried in a soda-water bottle. Kaised game pies, boiled and roast chicken cut up in joints, cold stewed beef, all kinds of sandwiches, tongue, slices of ham, pickled salmon, galantine of veal, rolls stuffed with cucumber and salmon, salad, and dressing in a bottle, cold cabinet pudding, tartlets, fruit turnovers, fruits of all kinds, cakes, biscuits, iced tea, soda water, claret, sherry and bottled beer, bread, butter, and the cruets not forgotten, constitute a really good picnic.

INTRODUCTION vii I must conclude these few introductory remarks by impressing on my readers that it is the duty of a cook, according to the celebrated De la Regni^res, to be always able to exemplify the truth of that proverb so characteristic of a nation of cooks, " Uapp^tit vient en mangeant" ; and by mentioning that this volume has been written with the hope of helping gentle- women in their homes. The recipes are culled from several foreign gastronomic works and private MSS., recipes given me by foreign chefs and from other sources. I have not gone into plain so much as fancy cookery, as there are so many good cookery books which treat of simple joints, etc. Having some thousands of cookery recipes foreign and otherwise, well indexed, I shall be pleased to hear from my readers who may desire recipes of dishes not given here.

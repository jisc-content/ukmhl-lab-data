62 THE housewife's REFEREE LAUNDHY HINTS A teaspoonful of kerosene in a quart of starch will prevent irons sticking. Equal parts of ammonia and turpentine will remove paint marks, if it is often applied. To set delicate colours in embroidered handkerchiefs soak them ten minutes before washing in a pail of water, in which a dessertspoonful of turpentine has been stirred.

An ironing stove where several (say, six or eight) irons are required hot at the same time is very useful and quite inexpensive. A capital

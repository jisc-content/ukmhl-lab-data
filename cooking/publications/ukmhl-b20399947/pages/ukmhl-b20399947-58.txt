46 THE HOUSEWlFE^S KEFEREB on them, and for what they are to be used. For instance, on the glass cloths: Initial or Name. 1864. No. 12. Pantry. Glass. I think for the best sheets, towels, pillow slips, table cloths, and table napkins an embroidered monogram is nicest. Pasted on to the middle of each shelf I have the name of the sorts written on a piece of foolscap paper, such as on the towel shelf, " Towels "; on that for the servants, " Servants' towels," and so on. The very top shelf I keep for old linen for mending and patching, or for rags, as the case may be. Little bags of muslin filled with lavender make a linen cupboard smell sweet and they give the linen a pleasant perfume. I will just add to this little article the number of linen re- quisite in an ordinary-sized house :â€” Linen sheets for double beds, linen sheets for single beds, fine twilled longcloth sheets for double beds, fine twilled longcloth sheets for small beds (there are many people who object to linen sheets, and it is well to have both and ask visitors which they prefer), calico sheets for servants, fine linen pillow-slips, longcloth pillow-slips for servants, linen shams for pillows and sheets with frills or lace, and embroidered with monogram, damask table- cloths of all sizes, kitchen table-cloths, table-napkins, breakfast napkins (smaller), round towels for kitchen and pantry, fancy diaper towels, huckaback towels, servants' towels, bath towels, servants' toilet covers,* fine dusters for bric-a-brac, common dusters, glass cloths, tea cloths, kitchen, pantry and plate cloths, lamp cloths, basin cloths, slop cloths, house cloths, kitchen rubbers, knife cloths, dish cloths. * Toilet covers for the best rooms are seldom used now. Art muslins with fringes to match are mostly used where there is no marble top to the toilet tables.

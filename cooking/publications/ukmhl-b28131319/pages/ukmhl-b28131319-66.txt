Ingeedients.—30 large mangoes; dried chillies 8 oz. ; garlic 8 oz. ; bazaar salt 8 oz. ; green ginger 8 oz.; raisins or plums 1 lb.; brown sugar 1 lb.; mustard 4 oz.; vinegar about 2 bottles. Mode.—Clean and slice the mangoes and ■ginger, take the stalks off the chillies ; clean the garlic, plums and mustard ; pound the salt, soak all the above in a deep bowl or tureen for 12 hours, or all night; in the morning grind it as finely as possible on a curry stone, that has been well washed and wiped. Care should be taken that water does not mix with it, nor should it be touched with the hands—only wooden spoons should be used, to put it on the stone, remove it, &c., when all is ground mix in the sugar. The size of your mangoes must regulate the quantity of vinegar :—when quite done the chutney must be as consistent as made mustard. t-J ;

Put in with them a small onion, and if the onion is found to turn blackish, throw away the whole, it being proof that there is among them a false or poisonous mushroom. Stir them with a silver spoon, and keep on the lid of the pan closely, unless when you are stirring. If the spoon turns black the mush- rooms should not be eaten. After they have come to a boil take them off the fire, di’ain them, and when cool chop them small. To a pint or more of the minced mushrooms allow six or seven eggs. Beat the eggs till very light and thick (omitting the whites of two}, and then mix in gradually the mushi’ooms, stilling the whole very hard. Put three ounces of fresh butter into a hot omelet-jian or a small frying- pan, place it over the fire, and stir the butter as it melts. When it has boiled hard put in the omelet mixture, and as it fries stir it till it begins to set. Do not turn the omelet, but brown the top by holding close above it a red- pot shovel. AVlien done drain off the butter, fold over or double the omelet, and serve it up immediately on a hot dish.

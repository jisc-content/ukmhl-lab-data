NOTE TO THE NEW EDITION. P. II. L. Having found the first issue of my “ Cookery FOR THE Million” appreciated by the Public and my endeavours to produce a useful collection of practical recipes successful, I am tempted to repubhsh it with the addition of as many recipes as originally appeared. Some of the new ones are original, others have been contributed by some of my friends for which kindness I am thankful, and others have been selected from Cookery books which have been already publish- ed. A few'’ mistakes may have inadvertently crept in, these I trust the Public will excuse considering the difficulties under which I have labored in getting up this compilation. I may add that no less than twenty-three of the original recipes that appeared in my last edition have been reproduced verbatim in a recent edition [^of another Cookery Book pubhshed at Madras. May 1886.

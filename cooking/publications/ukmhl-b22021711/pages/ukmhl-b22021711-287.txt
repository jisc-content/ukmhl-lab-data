QUAGGA, ZEBRA, AND ASS. 269 the ass kind, which are sometimes kept in parks for their beauty, and occasionally driven in car- riages. However, as those persons who know them best say that they are generally wicked, treacherous, obstinate, and fickle in their dispo- sition, I think the less a lady has to do with them the better. After saying so much with regard to animals used for riding and drawing, I must not omit to mention asses. Most persons residing in the country keep one or two of these useful animals, in order that they may be ready to do any kind of work that their proud rival, the horse, is unfit for. It is scarcely possible to imagine two animals bearing considerable resemblance to each other in form, more unlike in character and constitution. The horse, as an able writer on the subject says, “ is proud, fiery, and impetuous; nice in his taste; and delicate in his constitution. The ass, on the contrary, is humble, patient, and contented with scanty and coarse food, which other cattle reject. He bears, with patience and fortitude, the most cruel treatment: yet he is more susceptible of strong attachment than the horse; has, appa- rently, more prudence and reflection; and is ca- pable of a degree of education which would not be anticipated from the forlorn and dejected ap- pearance which coarse food and harsh treatment have rendered habitual to him.”

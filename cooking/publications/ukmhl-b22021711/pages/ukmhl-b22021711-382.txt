BOOK IV. RURAL WALKS. 364 It is, indeed, better that married people should have separate occupations during a part of the day; but they should never have separate in- terests, and they should always study to have as many subjects in common as possible. But I am forgetting that you have still two objects of natural history to be explained, which ex- cited your attention during your walk. The first is the piece of stone that was picked up, and which, from the numerous particles it contains, was pro- bably a piece of Granite, that is to say, if shining particles were mixed with others of a different nature; and it will be an amusement to you, if you have any mineralogical specimens, to endea- vour to find out what it is by comparing it with them; or, if you have not, to take it with you the first time you go to a town where there is a museum. The curious appearance you noticed in the clouds you will find, by consulting a book on meteorology, was of the kind called Cirrus, or, popularly, mareâ€™s tail, and that it is said to in- dicate the approach of windy weather. It would be useless to multiply instances of the mode in which an interest may be created in country walks: but what I have said will be suf- ficient to show that, though we may complain of the monotony of a country life, there are a , thousand sources of interest in it within our reach, if we will only give ourselves the trouble to observe them.

I am very glad to find that you have laid out your flower-garden, and that you begin to feel an interest in the cultivation of your flowers. I do not at all agree with you, however, in thinking that this is merely because gardening has with you, as yet, the charm of novelty; on the con- trary, I am quite sure that as you become better acquainted with the subject, you will find your interest in your garden increase; as gardening is one of those happy arts in which there is always some not quite certain change to look forward to, and to be anxious about. Landscape-gardening is, however, the highest branch of the art, and it is the more necessary that you should study it, as, from the view you have sent me of your house, it appears to me that the general aspect of your park is at present very monotonous.

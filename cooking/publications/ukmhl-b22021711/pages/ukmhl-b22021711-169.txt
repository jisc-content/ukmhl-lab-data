151 HARDY PERENNIALS. and seeds every year. Perennials are of two kinds: those that die down to the ground every autumn and send up fresh stems from the root the fol- lowing spring; and those which remain green all the year, as, for example, the pinks and carna- tions. Besides these kinds there are other sorts of perennials, as, for example, those that have tu- berous roots, such as the dahlia. Bulbs are also perennials ; but of these I have already spoken. Most kinds of perennials are propagated by dividing the roots; but, in the case of the dahlia, ranunculus, and anemone, care must be taken to choose only those portions of the tubers that have buds or eyes, as they are called, as otherwise the tuber, though it will send out fibrous roots, will never produce a stem; and, in dividing fibrous- rooted plants, care must be taken that the divided part is furnished with buds. Almost all kinds of perennials may also be propagated by cuttings; and those of pinks and carnations are called pip- ings, because, instead of being cut, they are pulled asunder at a joint, and this gives the se- parated parts a hollow appearance like small pipes. Tubers are frequently taken up every autumn; and those of the ranunculus and anemone are replanted in November or January, the former season being much to be preferred. The tubers of the dahlia are generally taken up in November, and replanted in May or June.

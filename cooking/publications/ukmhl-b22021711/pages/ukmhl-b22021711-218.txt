200 BOOK II. THE GARDEN. LETTER X. LAYING OUT A KITCHEN-GARDEN.—MAKING GRAVEL WALKS. BOX EDGINGS. CROPS OF CULINARY VEGETABLES. CUCUMBERS, MELONS, AND MUSHROOMS. I had not intended saying any thing about the kitchen-garden, as it hardly comes within a lady’s province; but as you tell me you are so much annoyed by your old gardener never having the things you want when you want them, that you think of farming a small kitchen-garden near the house, I shall be very happy to give you my ad- vice as to what appears to me to be the best method of doing so. Every kitchen-garden ought, if possible, to be either square or oblong, for the convenience of planting the beds, and you will find a garden of one acre in extent quite as much as you will be able to manage. I would advise you to have it surrounded by a wall about ten feet high for fruit trees; and in front of this wall there should be a border ten or twelve feet wide; beyond which should be a gravel walk four feet wide, leaving a square or oblong plot of ground in the centre for culinary vegetables. This central plot may either have a main walk up the centre.

By the Marquis De Custine. Translated from the French. 2d Edition. 3 vols. post 8vo. 31s. 6rf. clotn. “ We are inclined to think —and it is a painful reflection—that Mons. De Custine's remark- able volumes contain a more accurate account of the state and condition of Russia than any other work of recent date, without exception. The author has manifestly penetrated through that superficial glitter and gorgeous array which have blinded the eyes of too many travellers to the imperfections and defects of this great empire, and has shewn it as it really is. , To do this in the case of Russia requires many and favourable opportunities of observation, con- siderable shrewdness, and a courage and determination not easily to be daunted; all which Mons. De Custine has proved himself to have possessed in an eminent degree; and the re “ ult is, a work which those who are desirous to know Russia as it really is, and not as it would fain impose itself on the world to be, would do well to consult. We promise our readers equal surprise and pleasure from the perusal of his very clever book.”—Gentleman’s Magazine. DE LA BECHE.—REPORT ON THE GEOLOGY OF CORNWALL, DEVON, AND WEST SOMERSET.

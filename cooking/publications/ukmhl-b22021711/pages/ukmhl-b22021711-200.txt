182 BOOK II. THE GARDEN. when they attain a tolerable size in pots, the flower-buds are very apt to fall off without ex- panding. The best mode of growing camellias is, therefore, to plant them in the free soil of a con- servatory, taking care that some creeping plant is trained along the rafters over their heads, as they do not like to be exposed to too much sun, unless they have also a great deal of air, and are fre- quently and regularly watered. The soil for ca- mellias should be peat mixed with a little sandy loam. The temperature of the camellia house should be from 50° to 60° during the whole of the growing season; but, when the flower-buds have formed, the glasses are generally taken off during the rest of the summer. Early in autumn, however, when the flower-buds begin to swell, the glasses should be put on and the house kept warm, the plants being regularly watered morning and evening, as, if the watering be neg- lected a single day, or if stagnant water be suf- fered to remain about the roots, the flower-buds will be sure to drop off without expanding. Ca- mellias do not require frequent repotting. Small camellias are generally shifted only once in two years, and large ones, that is, those above five feet high, not oftener than once in three or four years. The time for shifting camellias is just when they have done flowering, before they are beginning to send out their young shoots. Great

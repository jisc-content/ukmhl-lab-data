Fruits keep best when laid separately, so as not to touch each other; and sometimes pears may be kept by packing them in fern, and grapes by packing them in jars in saw- dust.

I may here mention that when sweet chestnuts are sent to the table, they ought always to be boiled first, and roasted afterwards ; as, if they are roasted without previously boiling, it is scarcely possible to cook them sufficiently to make them wholesome. After they have been boiled, before they are put down to roast, care must be taken to prick the skins; as, if this is neglected, the chestnuts will fly about in all directions as soon as the outer skin becomes parched.

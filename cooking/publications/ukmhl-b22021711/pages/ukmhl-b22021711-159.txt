On the side next your room, if there are to be beds under the windows, there should be spaces left in them which should be gra- velled, so that you may throw the window open, and not only walk out on gravel, but walk round the garden on gravel also. This you will find a great convenience if the weather should be wet, though you must not mind going upon the grass, if you are to be a real gardener, and to attend to the flowers in the regular beds. With regard to the beds near the house, I would have a Lonicera flexuosa trained over each window, on account of its delightful fragrance in summer; for a similar reason I would have Chimonanthus fragrans against the walls between the windows, and mignonnette and violets in the beds. I think nothing can be more delightful than to throw open your window, and to inhale a re- freshing odour from growing flowers when they are swept over by a balmy breeze, particularly after a slight shower; and, for this purpose, I would strongly recommend you to plant flowers near your windows which have a refreshing, but not a heavy, scent. The flowers of the evergreen magnolia, and those of the orange, have an op- pressive fragrance, as have those of the heliotrope and the tuberose; but those of the mignonnette, the lemon-scented verbena, the rose, the violet.

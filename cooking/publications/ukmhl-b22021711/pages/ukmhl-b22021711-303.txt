MANAGEMENT OF CALVES. 285 There are many opinions about the length of time that a cow should be suffered to be dry before calving ; some farmers advising the cows to be let dry two months, and others milking them till within a fortnight of the time of calving. As far as my own experience goes, the latter plan is the best, as I have observed that, when cows have been dry a long time, they are very subject to in- flammation in the udder when they are again milked, instead of the contrary being the case, as is commonly supposed. When a cow is to be let dry, a little milk is left in the udder every time of milking, and in about a week or ten days the se- cretion of milk will cease. The first milk after calving is called biestings, and is so very different in quality from the other milk, that it should not be mixed with it. It is of a yellow colour and a glutinous nature, and, though it is used in some places for making pud- dings and custards without eggs, it ought always to be reserved for the calf, to whose use nature has especially assigned it. When calves are al- lowed to suck their mothersâ€™ milk for the first four or five days after they are calved, they have seldom any thing the matter with them; but, when they are fed with the milk of other cows, they gene- rally require castor oil and other medicines. Calves, when they are to be reared, are generally fed principally on milk for the first thirteen weeks, after which they are fed partly with hay tea,

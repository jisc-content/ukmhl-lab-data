Another point to be attended to in the manage- ment of a greenhouse is, keeping the plants as near as possible to the glass, as, unless this be done, the plants will become what gardeners call “ drawn up,” and unnaturally tall and slender, from the efforts they make to reach the light. As I have frequently mentioned repotting, I may as well tell you here the best mode of per- forming the operation. The pot to which the plant is to be removed should always have been previously washed quite clean, and be perfectly dry. Some bits of broken pots, called pot- sherds, should then be put at the bottom of the pot, the quantity varying from three or four pieces, so as just to cover the hole, to a mass an inch in depth, depending upon the nature of the plant. If the plant has not been in a pot before, the roots are then placed just above the potsherds, and the earth is filled in, the plant being occasionally shaken so as to allow the earth to get amongst its roots. The soil in the pot is next consolidated, by shaking it and then lifting it up and setting it down again with a jerk, the soil being rendered firm and neat round the rim of the pot by means of a broad smooth piece of stick shaped some- what like a table-knife, and called a potting-stick.

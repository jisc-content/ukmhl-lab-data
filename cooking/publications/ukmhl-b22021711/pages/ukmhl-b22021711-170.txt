This used to be accounted for by supposing that plants threw out excrementitious matter, which, after a few years, poisoned the soil in which they grew ; but it is now supposed that, as every plant re- quires peculiar earths for its nourishment, they must be removed when they have exhausted all the particular kind of earth they want which grows within their reach. It is rather difficult to explain this without entering into long details; but it will be sufficient for our present purpose merely to state the fact, that plants do require their roots to have a constant supply of fresh earth; and, to meet this wTant, nature has provided that the roots of trees, and of all plants that are intended to remain for several years in the soil, elongate themselves every year, so as to be con- tinually able to obtain a fresh supply of nourish- ment. In gardens, however, the constant dig- ging that is going on for the culture of annual plants is unfavourable to the elongation of the roots of the perennials, and consequently it is ab- solutely necessary that those plants should oc- casionally be taken up and replanted. The season for taking up and replanting perennial plants is either in autumn, after they have done growing, or in spring, before they begin to shoot; and, if the soil about the roots looks black and wet, or, as

Many plans have been devised for feeding phea- sants in the woods, but none are better than those of Mr. Waterton at Walton Hall. At that most interesting place, which may be called the para- dise of birds, Mr. Waterton has formed clumps of hollies, by planting twenty or more in a circle, and then making an inner circle, containing ten or fifteen trees, and scattering the food for the birds between the two circles, or in the centre of the inner one.

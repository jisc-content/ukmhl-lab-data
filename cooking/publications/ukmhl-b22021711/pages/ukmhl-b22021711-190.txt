BOOK II. THE GARDEN. 172 in the latter case the flue should go round at the front and return at the back, being about twenty inches high and twelve inches wide. The heat of a greenhouse of this nature need never be more than 50° in the day, and it may be allowed to sink even as low as 35° at night, the object being merely to keep out the frost. The heath house, like the Australian house, requires to be as transparent, and as thoroughly ventilated, as possible. A heathery, however, is generally a span-roofed house with a walk down the centre, and shelves for the plants on each side. It is usually heated by hot water, the pipes for conveying which are placed in the centre of the house. The width of the house should be about ten feet, and the height in the centre of the span should never exceed nine, as it is of great im- portance to have the plants as near the glass as possible. The floor of the house should stand one foot above the level of the ground; and, where expense is not an object, the house is sometimes built on arches to insure perfect dryness. All the windows are made to move in every possible direction, so as to admit of a current of air through the house, whenever the state of the atmosphere will permit it. The conservatory differs from all the other kinds of greenhouse, in the plants growing in the soil, instead of being in pots and placed on shelves.

BRIOCHES. 89 the manufacture of either rusks or cakes; and yet that cakes are most important articles in the country, where there are no shops to send to, at which they can be procured when wanted. I con- fess that this is a serious omission, and I hasten to repair it to the best of my ability, by sending you a few receipts for cakes, which, I have no doubt, you will find useful. As I have already given some receipts for French cookery, the first cake I shall describe will be a Brioche. Take a pound of fine flour, divide it into three parts, to one of which put a table-spoonful of yeast, mixed with warm water into a light batter, then set it before a fire if the weather is cold, and let it rise half an hour. In warm weather it need not be put to the fire, as it will rise immediately. Mix the rest of the flour with a quarter of an ounce of salt, three eggs, a quarter of a pound of butter, and enough warm water to make it into a stiff dough. Knead it well, and then add the portion that was previously prepared. Knead the whole well together, and then wrap the dough in a white napkin, and leave it for seven or eight hours. Then divide the dough into pieces, as if for buns, and make them into the usual half-twisted form of a brioche, using a little warm milk to moisten them if necessary. Then wash them over with eggs, and put them in the oven.

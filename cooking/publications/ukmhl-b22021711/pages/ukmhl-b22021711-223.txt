PERMANENT CROPS. 205 cut off and used for the table; but those that spring after Midsummer should be suffered to ex- pand their leaves, in order that they may elaborate their sap, and thus strengthen the roots. Sea-kale is planted in beds in the same manner as asparagus, when the plants are a year old. The first year the plants will require little care, ex- cept cutting down their flower stems whenever they appear; but the second year, each plant must be covered with river-sand, and then have a sea-kale pot turned over it, on which must be heaped stable dung fifteen or twenty inches high, in order that the heat may make the young shoots grow rapidly, and thus make them tender and succulent. Artichokes, tart-rhubarb, and horseradish, are other permanent crops found in kitchen-gardens, but they do not require any particular care in their culture. The temporary crops in kitchen-gardens re- quire a constant change, as it is found from ex- perience that the same crop cannot be grown on the same ground for two years in succession, without becoming of an inferior quality; and thus it is found necessary to fix what is called the rotation of crops, and to arrange that in each compartment a fresh crop shall be grown every year, as different as possible from the one that grew in it the year before. Thus, onions may be

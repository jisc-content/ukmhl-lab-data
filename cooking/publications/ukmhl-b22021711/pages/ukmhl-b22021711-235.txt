217 PEACH, PLUM, FIG, ETC. Apricots are trained somewhat horizontally, and they bear not only on the shoots of the last year, but on close spurs formed by the two yearsâ€™ old wood. Apricot trees are very apt to have large limbs die off without any apparent cause ; but this may be prevented by covering all the principal limbs in October with hay bands, and letting them remain on till all danger is over from frost. Apricot trees hould be five and twenty feet apart on the wall, as they spread rapidly, and do not bear cutting in. The fruit should be thinned in May, or the beginning of June. Plum trees will bear a little manure being laid on the surface in autumn, and slightly forked in in spring. They are trained horizontally, and they bear on what are called spurs; that is, short rugged-looking little branches, jutting out from shoots two Or three years old, and which will con- tinue fruitful for several years. Plum trees, therefore, require very little pruning; and, in fact, as they are apt to gum when they are wounded, they should be very seldom touched with a knife. Cherry trees resemble plum trees in their cul- ture, and, when grown against a wall, most of the kinds are trained horizontally, and their branches kept six or eight inches apart. The morello cherry ;is, however, an exception to this rule, as it re- quires pruning and training, like the peach. Fig trees should never be pruned, except to

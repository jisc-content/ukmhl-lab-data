HEATH HOUSE, CONSERVATORY, ETC. 173 It is also more lofty and architectural than a greenhouse, and generally of much greater extent. It is frequently attached to the house, and so contrived that it can be entered from one of the living-rooms. The temperature of the conserva- tory is generally rather warmer than that of the greenhouse, as it is kept at 60° during the day, and seldom allowed to fall lower than 40° at night. The orangery is a still more architectural- looking building than the conservatory, and it has an opaque roof. It is used only for preserving orange trees and other plants that remain in a dormant state during the winter, and it requires no more heat than is absolutely essential to keep out the frost. The camellia house is generally formed like a common greenhouse, but so contrived as to allow the whole of the sashes to be taken off during the summer. The plants are kept on stone shelves, raised one above another; and there is generally no walk at the back. Of the culture of the plants in the Australian house I have already spoken; and of those in the greenhouse I need only detail the management during the winter months, as your greenhouse will, I suppose, be in the reserve ground, and will be only used to preserve those plants during winter which you have kept in other more con- spicuous situations during the summer months.

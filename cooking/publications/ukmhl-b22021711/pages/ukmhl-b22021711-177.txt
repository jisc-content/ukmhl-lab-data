159 COLD FRAME. Sometimes greenhouse plants which are left in the open ground are preserved from the frost by coverings of wicker-work like beehives being put over them, or tin hoops over which mats have been stretched; or, where the plants are small, a flower-pot may be turned over them, or a hand- glass used for the same purpose. It is seldom, however, worth while to take much pains to pre- serve greenhouse plants that have flowered in the open air. The ordinary way is to make abun- dance of cuttings in autumn ; to strike them in a hotbed, and then, after hardening them by de- grees, to preserve them in a small greenhouse, or in a cold pit, till the time for planting out next year.

Broccoli and cauliflowers, particularly the latter, require too much care in their culture for me to advise you to have any thing to do with them. Peas and beans should be grown in an open sunny situation, and in a soil that is tolerably rich, but not freshly manured. Some persons sow their early peas in November and December, but very little is gained by so doing; and, if the winter should be severe, the crop is sometimes lost.

Kidneybeans are of two quite distinct kinds. The dwarf kidneybeans are annuals, which should

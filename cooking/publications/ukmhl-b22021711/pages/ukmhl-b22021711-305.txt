MANAGEMENT OF PIGS. 287 of heat and cold being alike prejudicial to them ; and the house in which they are kept should have a paved floor, and no litter. Wherever there are cows and a garden, pigs should be kept; as skim-milk and buttermilk, with the refuse of a garden, are almost sufficient to maintain a pig. Pigs are unlike most other ani- mals, as they really seem never to thrive when they are kept clean, and they fatten soonest on sour food. Sows are very apt to destroy their young when they are littered with long straw, as the pigs sometimes hide themselves in it, and are trodden upon accidentally by their mother; and at other times she appears annoyed by the rustling of the straw, and to become so excited at it as to devour her young in a species of frenzy. A sow ought, therefore, to be littered with short straw when she is expected to produce young; and in many places the young pigs are taken from their mother till they are three or four days old, and only allowed to be with her when they want food. Pigs are greedy creatures, and, when there are several together, the master pig generally puts his foot in the trough while feeding, so as to prevent any other pig coming near him till he has done. Young pigs are generally weaned when they are six or seven weeks old; and, when they are killed at this age or sooner, they are termed sucking-pigs, and are generally roasted whole.

CULTURE IN CONSERVATORY. 179 pipes that warm the house. The consequence of this arrangement is, that the beds on each side the middle walk are so planted as to have their highest shrubs in the centre, shelving down to those of lower growth on each side; and hence the centre is generally planted with tall camel- lias, acacias, metrosideros, eucalyptus, &c.; while near the walk are placed oleanders, myrtles, fuchsias of different kinds, together with choro- zemas, and many of the other most ornamental New Holland plants ; and up the pillars that support the roof are trained kennedyas, big- nonias, ipomoeas, and passion-flowers in great va- riety. Clianthus punlceus and Polygala oppositi- folia ought to find a place in every conservatory; and a plant of Wistaria sinensis may be trained under the rafters so as to afford shade to the ca- mellias ; as, under shelter, the wistaria will flower twice in the year, and its flowers will yield a de- lightful, though very delicate, fragrance. As it is of the greatest importance to the health of the plants to have the soil in a conservatory well drained, many persons form the beds by exca- vating pits of the proper size, about two feet and a half deep, and put at the bottom a layer of brick- bats, stones, and other materials for drainage, about six inches thick. On this is deposited a thin layer of coarse rough gravel; and on that another layer of rich mould, which should be about two feet thick in * 2

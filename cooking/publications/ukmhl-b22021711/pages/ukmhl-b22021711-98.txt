After boiling two minutes add a spoonful of prepared isinglass, and turn it out, as you would any other cream. Send it to table with a little raspberry or currant syrup.” For impromptu Cheesecakes. “ Take a quarter of a pound of butter, and the same quantity of pounded lump sugar, two eggs well beaten, and the juice of a lemon, with the grated rind. Beat the butter into a cream, and mix the whole well together. Then put some light puff paste in pattypans, and drop a little of the mixture into each.” Another way of making cheesecakes is to take, of butter, sugar, and sweet almonds, each a quarter of a pound, the yolks of four eggs, with the white of two, and the grated rind of a lemon. Blancmange may be made quickly by boiling, or rather simmering, two ounces of isinglass in three pints of milk till it is dissolved, which will be in about half an hour.

When the vines are in flower and the fruit setting, the house should be kept close, and the pipes or flues fre- quently sprinkled with water; as a hot dry air makes the calyx shrivel up before the pollen has reached the ovary, and, when this is the case, the grapes will be small and frequently without stones. It would take too much space to explain to you the other methods of training and pruning, and I need only say that the long method, which is the only one except the spur system in general use, consists in cutting out the old wood every second year, and supplying its place with wood of the previous season’s growth. You will thus see that the principal points to be attended to in the culture of the vine are: — 1. To prune the plants so as to prevent them from forming too much wood, but not to cut too

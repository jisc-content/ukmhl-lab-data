CUTTINGS AND PIPINGS. BUDDING. 243 air. When a cutting is made, most of the leaves are removed, as the evaporation from them is greater than the plant can support while it is without roots. Cuttings of succulent plants are generally laid upon a shelf to dry before they are put into the ground, as if this is not done the wounded part is apt to become rotten, and decays. Cuttings are generally struck either in sand or very light earth, in order that the young roots may meet with as little obstruction as possible. Pipings are cuttings of pinks and carnations, but pulled asunder at a joint instead of being divided with a knife. Budding is taking off a cutting of a single eye, and inserting it in another tree called the stock. This operation is generally performed in July or August. In the first place, a slit is made on each side and above and below a leaf which has a healthy bud in its axil, that is, just between the foot-stalk of the leaf and the branch on which it grows. The bark of the branch containing the bud and the leaf is then detached from the branch, by passing under it the bone handle of the budding- knife, which is made flat and thin on purpose, and raising it gradually up. If the bark has been raised carefully and properly, there will generally be a little bit of wood just under the bud, which must be carefully taken out, so that not the smallest particle of wood is left on the under side

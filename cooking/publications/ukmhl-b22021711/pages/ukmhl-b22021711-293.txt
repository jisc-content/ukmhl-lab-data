MANAGEMENT OF COWS. 27 5 LETTER XIV. QUADRUPEDS KEPT TOR SUPPLYING POOD. COWS, CALVES, GOATS, PIGS, RABBITS, AND DEER. I am very glad, my dear Annie, to hear such favourable accounts of your garden, and to find, by the enquiries you are beginning to make, that you really are taking a lively interest in country affairs. You say you are getting quite fond of your dairy ; but that you cannot understand how it is that your cows produce so much less milk in the morning than they do at night, when there are exactly twelve hours between the milkings in both cases; as they are milked first at five in the morning, and again at five in the afternoon. I have no doubt from what you say, that your cows are kept in the cow-house during the night, and only turned out during the day, as this would account for the difference in the quantity of milk. But such a mode of management, though it saves trouble to the dairy-maid, who finds it much easier to milk the cows in the cow-house than in the open field, is bad for both the cows and the dairy ; as the cows, after feeding on grass all day, cannot of course relish dry food at night, and whenever they fast unnaturally very little milk is secreted.

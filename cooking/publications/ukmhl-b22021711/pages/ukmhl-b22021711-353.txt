335 ORNAMENTAL DUCKS. The widgeon, Mr. Waterton tells us, “is a much more familiar bird than either the pochard or the teal. While these congregate on the water, beyond the reach of man, the widgeon appears to have divested itself of the timidity observable in all other species of wild-fowl, and approaches very near to our habitations.” The widgeon has such a shrill cry, that it is sometimes called the whistling duck. The American widgeon is the constant atten- dant on the canvass-back duck, so celebrated in the United States for its excellence as an article of food. These ducks have been introduced into England, but they do not thrive in this country probably for want of a species of Vallisneria on which they feed in their native land. The best way of managing them would be, to give them plenty of grain, particularly wheat, of which they are remarkably fond ; though, probably, buck-wheat would answer the purpose, and would be much more economical. The Vallisneria, also, on which they feed, might be introduced into England, though it would require to be grown in running water. The eider duck is very scarce on ornamental pieces of water, though it is abundant in the North, particularly on the Eern Islands off the coast of Northumberland, and especially on St. Cuthbert’s rock; and hence it is sometimes called St. Cuth- bert’s duck. It was long supposed that the eider

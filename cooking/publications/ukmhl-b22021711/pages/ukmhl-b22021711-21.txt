3 INTRODUCTION. the week after. I need not enter into the details of my troubles in preparing for this well-remem- bered dinner. Meat was out of the question; and though I was enabled, by having recourse to the poultry-yard and the dovecot, to give my fatherâ€™s friends enough to eat, no one but a young housekeeper in a similar situation can have any idea of what I suffered. The lesson, however, was not lost upon me; and you may easily ima- gine that ever afterwards I took care to have a cooked piece of hung beef, or ham, or some simi- lar substantial article of food in the house, that I might be provided for a similar occurrence. The recollection of what I underwent while buying my experience makes me anxious to spare you, my dear Annie, the pain of a similar ordeal; particularly as it is more disagreeable for a young newly married woman to feel in house- keeping difficulties than a single one ; as it makes you fear your husband had a higher opinion of you than you deserve. In your situation the difficulty is increased by your husband not having lived at the Manor-House since the death of his parents, when he was only ten years old; so that he can have no idea of the petty troubles you will be exposed to. Under these circumstances I will do my best to clear the path that lies before you, and to teach you how to enjoy rationally a country life.

136 BOOK II. THE GARDEN. lines need only to be measured, and pieces of string stretched from pegs put in at the proper distances, so as to form straight lines, oblongs, squares, tri- angles, or diamonds. If a circle is to be traced, it is done by getting a piece of string half the length of the diameter of the circle, with a piece of stick tied to each end. One stick is then driven into the ground in the centre of the circle, and a line is traced with the stick at the other extremity of the string, which is drawn out quite tight. An oval is made by tracing two circles, the circumscribing line of one of which just touches the centre of the other; short lines are afterwards made at the top and bottom, and the central lines are obliterated. A square only requires a peg at each corner, with a chalked string drawn from peg to peg; and an oblong, or parallelogram, is made by joining two common squares, and taking off the corners if re- quired. A heart-shaped pattern (fig. 8.) is made by drawing a straight line from a to b, and then fixing a peg with a string tied to it, half < the length of the straight line, and another peg at the end, exactly in the middle of the line, and drawing half a circle with it; then taking a peg with a string half the length of the other, and another peg tied

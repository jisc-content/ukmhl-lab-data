This, if it still continues bitter, should undergo the same process again; the firm sediment will then be good stiff barm, from which all floating water should be poured. Whether this substance, or the yeast from the brewery, be employed it should always be mixed with three or four ta- ble-spoonfuls of fresh bran, and a pint of warm water, and then be strained through a hair sieve.

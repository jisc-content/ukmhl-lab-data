The study of natural history is, indeed, I think, more fitted than any other to open our minds to a proper knowledge of the wisdom and goodness of God; and the more we study it the more firmly we shall be convinced that nothing has been made in vain, and that everything has been most admirably suited to the station which it is designed to fill. The curious fungus you will find, by comparing it with the Encyclopedia of Plants, is Nidularia campanulata, which the Scotch call “ Siller Cups.” There is a popular superstition in Scotland re- specting these pretty little cups, which says that if you find them alone you will have as much money as they contain little balls. These balls are, however, cases containing the sporules, or seeds, of the fungus. I now come to the flower which I have sup- posed to have attracted your attention, and you will find, upon a minute examination, that it has a corolla divided into two distinct parts, the upper one standing up like a hood or helmet, and the lower one hanging down like a pouting under lip.

ARBORETUM. ROSE-GARDEN. TURF. 199 colours which some of the exotic trees will take in autumn give them a splendid appearance, when they are backed by other trees with verdant fo- liage. The rose-garden will be a very beautiful object if skilfully arranged; and, by thus forming your park into a succession of scenes, you will not only increase its beauty in the eyes of strangers, but add very materially to your owTn enjoyments by increasing the objects of interest within your reach. I do not suppose you will have any occasion to renovate the turf in any part of your park; .but, if you should, the best way is to get a mix- ture of the seeds of several sorts of grasses, such as the fox-tail meadow grass (Alopecurus pra- tensis), the sweet-scented vernal grass (Anthox- anthum odoraium), the crested dogâ€™s-tail grass ( Cynosurus cristatus), and other valuable kinds. If ever you find a patch of grass has become bare have an iron rake drawn over the ground two or three times, so as to loosen it, and then sow a few seeds of the grasses I have mentioned, when the ground is in a tolerably moist state from rain. This will generally be sufficient; but if it should not, as the seed of the fox-tail meadow grass is very often bad, you have only to add a little seed of the common white clover, and the ground will appear green in a few days.

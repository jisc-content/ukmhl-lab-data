ARRANGEMENT OF COLOURS. 139 a layer of rich marly soil, in which the bulbs should be planted. Dahlias, hollyhocks, and other tall-growing, showy-flowered plants, should have similar beds prepared for them, but the soil should be made very rich by the addition of the remains of an old hotbed, or some other kind of half-rotten animal manure. You will observe, that when I give directions for planting the beds in any of the plans I send you, I merely say what may be done, and not what is ab- solutely necessary. Indeed, it will be better for you to vary the flowers as much as possible, accord- ing to your own taste, provided you take care that the plants are, as nearly as you can contrive it, of the same height, or that they rise gradually, and that you contrast the colours well.

ARTIFICIAL YEAST. 59 stopper, which should be opened when the bread has been in a little time, in order that the vapour from the bread may escape. It is from not at- tending to this, that home-baked bread is so fre- quently heavy. You ask me how to make Yeast. It may be made by putting a teacupful of split peas into a basin and pouring about a pint of boiling water over them. A cloth is then put over the basin, and it is set near the fire to keep warm. In about twelve hours it will begin to ferment, and a kind of scum will rise, which may be used as yeast. This is called Turkish yeast; but a better method is practised by the Americans, which is as follows: — Take as much hops as may be held between the thumb and finger, put them with a few slices of apples into a quart of water, and boil the whole for about fifteen or twenty minutes. Then strain the liquid, and when it is lukewarm stir in a little flour with three or four table-spoonfuls of treacle so as to make a thin paste; then set the whole in a warm place, and in a few hours the fermentation will be sufficiently strong to allow enough flour and water to be added to make a proper sponge for bread. If you have a small quantity of yeast it may be increased in the following manner: — Take one pound of fine flour, and mix it to the thick- ness of gruel with boiling water ; add half a pound of brown sugar, mixing the whole well together.

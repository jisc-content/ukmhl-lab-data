TEMPORARY CROPS. 207 be sown in drills about two feet apart, the first or second week in May ; but the scarlet runners are perennials, and the seed should be sown two or three inches asunder, and very lightly covered ; and the rows should at least be three feet apart. The plants will require sticks like peas. Potatoes are propagated by what are called sets, that is, pieces into which the tuber is cut, each of which contains a bud or eye. Before they are planted, the ground should be trenched, and rotten dung dug into it. The early potatoes are planted in March, and the late ones in May or June. When the potatoes are to be planted, a garden line is stretched across the beds, and holes are made along it with a dibber, about six inches deep, and nine inches or a foot apart. The sets are then put into the ground, one in each hole, with the eye upwards, and the earth firmly pressed down on them. When the plants come up, they are frequently hoed and earthed up; and as soon as they come into blossom some cultivators cut off the tops, to prevent the formation of the seed. The Jerusalem artichoke is propagated by sets, like the potato ; and the turnip, the carrot, and the parsnep are propagated by seed sown in drills about March. Red beet is cultivated in the same manner, and plants that are sown in March will have roots

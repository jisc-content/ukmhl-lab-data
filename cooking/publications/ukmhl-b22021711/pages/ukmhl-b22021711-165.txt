147 HARDY ANNUALS. is customary to put a piece of stick into the ground, with the name of the seeds written upon it, to mark the place; or, if you prefer it, you can write the name on a card, or a bit of pasteboard, and stick it in a notch or cleft cut in the stick. When the seeds have come up, which, in the spring, is generally from a fortnight to six weeks after sowing, according to their nature, the seed- lings may be thinned out, and the supernumerary plants either transplanted or thrown away. If the seedlings are to be transplanted, care should be taken not to break or injure the roots, and a little hole should be made with a stick for each seedling in the place to which it is to be removed; the earth being pressed close to the root at the bottom of the hole before the rest of the hole is filled in, as, if any hollow place is left round the root it is sure to decay instead of growing. Seed- ling hardy annuals are, however, very seldom worth the trouble of transplanting. Many per- sons turn a flower-pot over every patch of seeds from the idea that it will make them come up sooner, and protect them from the birds. It is, however, a very bad plan, as air and light are particularly necessary to seedling plants; and when they are even partially deprived of these important agents, they become drawn up with weak slender stems, and thin discoloured leaves. Some annuals, such as the mignonette and the

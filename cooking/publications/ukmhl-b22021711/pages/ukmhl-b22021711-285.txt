267 CHOICE OF A CAEEIAGE. smooth river. Carriages, such as those we have now in use, are, as no doubt you know, quite a recent invention. You remember the celebrated letter of Henry IV., in which he says, “ I cannot come to you to-day, because my wife is using my coach; ” and even in the time of Charles II. there were but fifty coaches in London and West- minster. Now it would be rather difficult to count them, and it would even be a more tedious task than I should like to undertake to enumerate their kinds. I shall, therefore, content myself with mentioning the points that are of most im- portance in selecting a carriage. The first thing to be examined is, whether it possesses proper elasticity; and this is gene- rally tried by having the carriage shaken on its springs, and observing whether it appears rigid or yielding to the vibrations of the motion. All carriages ought to be built of ash, which is at once the most elastic and the toughest of our English woods ; but, as it is rather expensive, cheaper woods are sometimes substituted. It is also known that the narrower the tread of a car- riage is, that is, the shorter the axletrees are, the easier will be the draught. The springs should then be examined, as the carriage runs lighter and is easier when the plates of the springs are of equal thickness, though the largest plate is frequently made much thicker than the rest.

When it begins to rise in bubbles, more water and flour is added, and it is again left to ferment, and then more flour with a little salt is added to make the dough.

When yeast is used, the usual proportion is half a pint of brewer’s yeast mixed with a pint of warm water, to twenty-four pounds of flour. In the Magazine of Domestic Economy, it is stated that “ the yeast of home-brewed beer is much to be preferred; but it is very bitter in the first instance, and would flavour a large batch of bread; therefore, it should be washed in a con-

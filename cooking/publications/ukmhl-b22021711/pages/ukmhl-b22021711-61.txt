When the malt has been sufficiently mashed, the wort is drawn off by the spigot, and it will be found that the eighteen gallons of water have only yielded about thirteen gallons of wort, and sometimes not so much. A new kind of mashing-tub (fig. 4.) has been invented which has a false bottom pierced with holes, through which the wort filters, instead of being drawn off by the spigot; and, by an improvement on this, the hot water is poured through a tube Fie-4• Mash-tub- into the part of the mashing-tub which is below the false bottom, and suffered to rise up through the malt. After the ale wort has been drawn off, more water is heated to 175° and put to the malt, to make the beer, if any should be required. While the malt is being mashed, the proper quantity of hops should be steeped in water, having been first well rubbed and separated; and when the wort is drawn off they should be added to it, and the whole put into the copper to be boiled. During the boiling the whole should be frequently stirred, to prevent the hops from either floating at the top or settling to

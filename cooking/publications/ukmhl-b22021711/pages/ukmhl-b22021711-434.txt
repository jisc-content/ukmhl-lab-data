An entirely New Edition, corrected throughout, enlarged, and improved. 1 very thick vol. 8vo., illustrated with Maps and Plans, 50*. cloth; or 55*. strongly half- bound in Russia, with flexible back. “ Without exaggeration one of the most wonderful compilations of the age. The power of continuous labour, the wide range of inquiry, and the power of artistical finish, which have been brought into play by this work, are probably unrivalled in the history of literature . . . Compared u-ith all previous attempts to compile a commercial dictionary, Mr. McCulloch’s appears as the realisation of an idea which former projectors had conceived too vaguely to be able to carry into execution. It is superior to them all, quite as much for the spirit of judicious selection brought by the author to his task, as for any other quality. The great merit of the worh is, that, while omittingnothing of essential importance, it contains nothing that is useless or merely cumbrous . . . The success of the earlier editions of Mr .McCulloch’s Dictionary is, after all, the best proof of its merit; the facts attending it prove that the mercantile, political, and literary public were in want of such a worh, and that they were satisfied with the manner in which Mr. M'Culloch had performed his task. No reader can rise from the perusal of any one of the larger articles without feeling that no previous writer has concentrated so much valuable information within so small a compass, or conveyed his inform- ation in so agreeable a style. And the remark is equally applicable to all the numerous articles of which this crammed volume is composed .... It is, indeed, invaluable as a booh ofreference to the merchant, the insurance-agent, the statesman, and the journalist; and its articles, from the care and talent with which they are executed, are as well calculated to supply the wants of the patient inquirer as of the hurried man of business. Mr. M'Culloch occupies a high place amongst the authors of the dap as a hard-headed original thinker in political economy; a still higher, as one of the most zealous and successful labourers in rendering that science popular ; but, of all his publications, his Commercial Dictionary is the one least likely to encounter the rivalry of a work of superior or even equal value.” Abridged from The Spectator.

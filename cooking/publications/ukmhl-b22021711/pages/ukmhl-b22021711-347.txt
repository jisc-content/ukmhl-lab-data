BLACK SWAN. 329 be rendered incapable of flying while they are strangers to the place, and I would trust to kind treatment to make them wish to stay with me when we became better acquainted. The black swan is a native of Australia, and it is so common in that country, that it gives its name to the Swan River. In a wild state, it is generally seen floating on lakes or rivers, in long lines formed by eight or ten or more swans swim- ming in a single file; and when alarmed they rise all together and fly off, uttering wild but not un- musical screams, retaining in the air the same position as that they occupied in the water. You must, however, take care, if you put a black swan on the same water with the white ones that they do not injure it. Some years ago, two white swans on the water in the Regent’s Park pursued a black one with the greatest ferocity; and, according to Mr. Yarrell, from whom I have taken this account, one of them having succeeded in grasping the black swan’s neck between the man- dibles of its beak, shook it violently. The black swan with difficulty extricated itself from this murderous grasp, hurried on shore, tottered from the water’s edge a few paces, and then fell to die. The white swans did not attempt to pursue it, but continued sailing up and down the water with every feather on end, and seeming proud of their conquest.

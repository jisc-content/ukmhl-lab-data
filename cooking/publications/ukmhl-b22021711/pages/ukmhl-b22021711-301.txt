FEEDING OF COWS. 283 there is a pond they generally go into it till they come to deep water before they drink; and this habit is good for their feet. There should also be either an open shed, or at least one large tree, in the field, to afiord shade for the cows while they are chewing the cud; and they should never be changed suddenly from a very poor pas- ture to a very rich one, or the reverse. When cows are first taken up from grass in autumn, they should be fed on cut grass, mixed occasionally with a few carrots ; and they should be turned out in the daytime, but not till after nine or ten oâ€™clock in the morning, and taken up before the dew falls at night. By degrees hay should be mingled with their food, and the quantity of this should be gradually increased while that of the grass is diminished; some carrots cut in tolerably thick slices and a few grains being given occasionally, till the cows have be- come accustomed to their dry food. There are few' points in the management of cows of greater difficulty than that of enabling them to bear the transition from grass to dry food without losing their flesh, or the quantity of their milk being diminished. The one is, indeed, generally dependent on the other, as no cow will yield a proper quantity of milk unless she is in good con- dition ; and many cows refuse their food altogether when they are first taken up for the winter, as they none of them like dry food so well as grass.

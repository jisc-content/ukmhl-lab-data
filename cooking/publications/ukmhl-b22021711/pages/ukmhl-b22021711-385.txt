TARGET. BOWS AND BOWSTRINGS. 367 foreign yew was preferred to British, as being more elastic.

Bows are of different lengths, but those for ladies are gene- rally about five feet long; while men, on the contrary, generally choose a bow of their own height. The strength of a bow is calculated by the weight that it requires to be suspended to the bowstring, when the bow is strung, to draw the string to the length of an arrow from the bow, and this is called the bow’s weight. Fifty pounds is the standard weight of a man’s bow, and it re- quires a very strong man to draw a bow of sixty pounds’ weight; but bows for ladies and children are from two to thirty pounds’ weight. The bow handle, that is, the part which is nearly in the centre of the bow, is usually covered with velvet, in order to give a firm hold without hurting the hands; and this handle is placed, not exactly in the centre, but below it, so as to shorten the lower branch, as the strain upon that part is gene- rally considered greater than on the other, and on this account, also, the lower part of the bow is generally the thickest and the strongest. The two ends of the bow are tipped with horn, and notches are made in these tippings to receive the bowstring. The best bowstrings are made of Italian hemp, dressed with gum or Indian glue to

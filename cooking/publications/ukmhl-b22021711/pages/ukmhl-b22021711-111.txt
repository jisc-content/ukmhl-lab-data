CAKES. RATAFIA DROPS. MACAROONS. 93 add the other ingredients. Bake in a tin lined with paper well buttered. For Ratafia drops. Blanch and beat four ounces of bitter and two ounces of sweet almonds with a little rose-water, a pound of sifted sugar, the whites of two eggs well beaten, and a table- spoonful of flour. Drop this mixture so as to form balls about the size of a nutmeg, and bake them on wafer paper. For Macaroons. Blanch four ounces of almonds, and pound with four spoonfuls of orange-flower water; whisk the whites of four eggs to a froth, then mix it, and a pound of sugar sifted, with the almonds, to a paste ; and, laying a sheet of wafer- paper on a tin, put it on in different little cakes, the shape of macaroons. The last receipt of this kind which I shall give you, is for a cake called Gateau dJAvranches. Grate one pound of loaf sugar to a fine powder, and add it to the yolks of fourteen eggs. Beat them well together for half an hour, and then add the juice of two lemons, some orange-flower water, and half a pound of potato flour. In the meantime another person must beat the whites of the fourteen eggs for half an hour or more till they look like snow, as, should any liquid remain, it will spoil the cake completely. Put this snow to the yolks, and beat the whole together for ten minutes; then pour the whole quickly into a mould that has been well buttered

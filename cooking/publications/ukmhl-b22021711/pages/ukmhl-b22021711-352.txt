334 BOOK III. DOMESTIC ANIMALS. The gadwall, or grey duck, is an ornamental bird; but it is of little use to have it in pleasure- grounds, as it is so shy, and so fond of hiding itself among thick weeds and long grass, that the pair in the Zoological Societyâ€™s gardens are scarcely ever seen. The pintail duck, or sea pheasant, though also shy in its native habitats, is more easily tamed, and is well deserving of being kept on ornamental pieces of water, not only from the beauty of its plumage, but from the singular appearance pro- duced by its long tail when it is swimming on the water. This bird has a singular patch of green on its wings, and yellow feet. It is very difficult to get it to breed. The teal is the smallest of the British ducks, and one of the prettiest. Its breast is spotted with black tinged with purple, and it has a rich dark-brown mark on its head, encircling the eye and spreading down the back of the neck. The teal bears confinement well, and it breeds regu- larly every year in the gardens of the Zoological Society. The eggs are white tinged with buff, and generally about an inch and a half in length. The nest is formed of decayed vegetable matter, lined with down and feathers, and contains eight or ten eggs. The teal feeds on grass and water plants, and also on various kinds of insects ; but, when kept in this country all the year, during the winter it requires grain.

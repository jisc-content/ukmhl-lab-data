BOOK III. DOMESTIC ANIMALS. 304 hens lay better and the chickens grow faster, care being taken that the earthen pans or wooden troughs in which it is contained are always kept perfectly clean, and that they are daily scoured with boiling water to prevent them from ac- quiring a sour taste. The boiled food is always given in the feeding-house, but after eating it the fowls are turned into the yard to cater for them- selves if they feel inclined, and many persons advise a piece of bullockâ€™s liver or something of the kind to be thrown in the yard, as far from the hen-house as possible, to breed maggots, as they are particularly nourishing to young chickens, who will devour them greedily. It is also well to have a lump of chalk or some lime rubbish in a corner of the poultry-yard, that the laying hens may find it out, and peck some of it when they feel inclined. You will observe that I have not given any directions for cramming fowls, as I am quite sure you would not suffer any creatures under your control to be subjected to such treatment. Poultry are particularly liable to be attacked by body vermin, and, while they are annoyed by these torments, they will never feed properly. It is, therefore, of the greatest importance that the places in which they are kept should be perfectly clean, and that they should have abundance of sand, in which they can wallow whenever they feel inclined.

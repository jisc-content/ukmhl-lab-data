MUSHROOMS. 213 ready for the table. Care should be taken in gathering them to twist them up by the roots* as* if they are cut off* the root* which is left in the ground* will decay* and be injurious to the young plants. Mushrooms may be made to grow in lawns* by procuring some bricks of mushroom spawn* and* after breaking them into pieces about an inch or two inches square* burying these pieces by raising a little of the turf wherever the mush- rooms are wished to grow, and placing the spawn under it. This should be done in April or May; and, if the lawn be afterwards rolled, no other care will be requisite until September* when the mush- rooms will be ready for gathering.

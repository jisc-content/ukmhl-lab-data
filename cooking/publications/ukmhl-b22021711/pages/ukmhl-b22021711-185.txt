Most gardeners repot, or shift, as they call it, all their bark-stove plants about the middle or end of April; but this is too indiscriminate a practice, and, therefore, only those should be repotted that appear to want such an operation. One of the greatest difficulties attending the culture of plants in a bark stove is, guarding against the ravages of the immense number of in- sects that are engendered by the heat; and one of the most troublesome of these is the active little mite called by gardeners the red spider {A*earns telarius). This little pest breeds in the bark, and when first hatched it is so small as to be scarcely perceptible; particularly as it is of a pale green, nearly the colour of the under side of the leaf, to which it fixes itself, and there spins a web.

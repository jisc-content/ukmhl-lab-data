THE HOUSE. half a pound of currants, a quarter of a pound of suet shred very fine, a quarter of a pound of moist sugar, half a pound of mashed potatoes, a quarter of a pound of carrots boiled and beaten smooth, and one ounce of lemon-peel. Mix all well to- gether the night before the pudding is wanted, and boil it four hours.” It is singular enough that two other receipts have been sent me, by different friends, something similar to this, which I give be- low, that you may choose which you like best. “ Take of flour, suet chopped fine, currants, raisins, and grated carrot, half a pound of each; mix the ingredients well together, without any liquid, and boil five hours. A little grated lemon- peel may be added, and the pudding should be served with sweet sauce poured over it.” The other receipt is as follows:—“ Take of grated bread, mashed potatoes, grated carrot, chopped suet, currants, and sugar, each a quarter of a pound, two eggs beaten up with a little salt, and a little grated nutmeg and lemon-peel, with a very little powdered cinnamon to flavour it. The ingredients should be mixed well together, and boiled in a tin mould for two hours.” The following is still more recherche, and it is called Sir Joseph Brookes’s Plum pudding. “ Take the crumb of a twopenny loaf, six ounces of suet, two apples grated, three ounces of sugar, the rind of a lemon grated, a little candied orange, half a pound of currants, two table-spoonfuls of flour.

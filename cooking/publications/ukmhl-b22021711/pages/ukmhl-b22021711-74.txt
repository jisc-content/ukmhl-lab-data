Rub the tins with a very little butter, and let them be warm when you lay the cakes on them; cover with a thin cloth, and let them rise on the hearth about twenty or thirty minutes; bake them in a brisk oven. This makes very good buns, with a little good moist sugar, and a few caraway seeds or dried currants. Both the Sally Luns and the milk cakes may be washed over with the white of an egg, before they are put in the oven. For Oat cakes.

Set it before the fire to rise, and when it bubbles up bake the crumpets

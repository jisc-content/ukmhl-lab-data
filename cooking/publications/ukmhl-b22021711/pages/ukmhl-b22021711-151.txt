AUTUMNAL FLOWEKS. 133 best, and they will only require turning out of the pots without breaking the ball, into the places prepared for them. If you think there are too many white beds, you can substitute Sanvitalia procumbens, the flowers of which are yellow, for No. 8., but the seeds must have been sown the previous autumn to bring it forward, as otherwise it will not flower till late in the summer; and Bartonia aurea, the flowers of which are of a golden yellow, may be planted instead of No. 12. Cladanthus arabicus, formerly called A'nthemis arabica, which has yel- low flowers, may be planted in No. 8., if Sanvitalia cannot be obtained.

You will, however, easily recognise gravel or chalk; if the soil be red, it is probably, if loose, a sand, and if close, a marl; a peaty soil is black and loose; and a clay may be known by water standing in little pools after rain, without running off. This is one of the worst soils for gardening purposes; but it may be improved by mixing it with sand. I shall now give you a list of half-hardy plants for autumn, as most of the annuals will begin to look shabby in July or the beginning of August. No. 1. Verbena Melmdres, bright scarlet; No. 2. GEnothera Drummondi, yellow; No. 3. Lobelia bicolor, blue; No. 4. Calceolaria rugosa, pegged k 3

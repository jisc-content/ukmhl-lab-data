It is true that the year 1845 appears hitherto to have been very un- favourable for gold fish, as a great many have died, even in ponds, where they are generally much more healthy than when kept in rooms. In one instance, also, I have been informed that nearly twenty have died in the marble basin of a fountain, where fish had been kept for years with an average of not more than two or three deaths in a year.

In many cases, however, the cause of death is evidently a plant nearly allied to the green scum formed on stagnant water. This plant, which is called Achyla prolifera, consists principally of threads so exceedingly fine as to be imperceptible to the naked eye, and probably arises from the

It has been the object of the editor to combine science with practice, a knowledge of principles with the ordinary details and daily recurring duties of domestic life. In some departments of the work Mr. Webster has been assisted by a lady whose qualifications are beyond dispute, and the result of their united labours is the production of a volume which e.vhausts the subject, and defies all competition. The work is richly illustrated with woodcuts, adding greatly to its value. We strongly recommend every lady, and all others who are concerned in the management of domestic affairs, to make themselves familiar with Mr. Webster's volume, which must speedily be regarded as an indispensable book of reference to every housekeeper."

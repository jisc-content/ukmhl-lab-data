169 DRY STOVE. DAMP STOVE. gardener. Mesembryanthemums, which are also kept in a dry stove, require the same treatment as the Cacti. The orchidaceous plants grown in a damp stove are all epiphytes, which, in their natural state, grow either on the branches of trees, or on exposed rocks. The former of these are found in their wild state with their roots hanging down in the air, and growing in dense forests, where shade, moisture, and excessive heat are essential to their existence. Most of these plants, in a state of culture, are grown in the husks of cocoa-nuts, half filled with moss, from which the roots hang down, or they are tied wuth wire to pieces of wood hung from the rafters. The wood generally preferred for this purpose in England is the robinia, or false acacia, on account of the roughness of its bark, and the softness of its wood: and moss is generally put between the epi- phyte and log so as to make it quite compact. Some genera of orchideous plants, such as Dendrobium, Epidendrum, and Cattleya, are always grown in pots, which are filled with turfy peat, chopped moss, and lime rubbish. Others, such as Stanhopea and Catasetum, should be grown in baskets half filled with moss, or in a curious kind of frame, made of pieces of turf fastened between four upright pegs of wood; as the flowers of these plants come from their roots.

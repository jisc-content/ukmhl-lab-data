MUFFINS, AND CRUMPETS. BISCUITS. 57 on a hot stove, or a girdle. For muffins, take three pounds of flour, and roll the dough into balls, and let them rise before putting them on the iron plate. When the muffins begin to bake they will spread into the proper shape; and when one side is done they should be turned on the other sidtf. The crumpets do not require turning. Water is often used instead of milk. Potato crumpets are made by adding to three pounds of mealy potatoes boiled and rubbed through a coarse sieve, half a pound of flour, an egg, a little salt, and a spoonful of yeast. I shall now give you two or three receipts for biscuits. For Butter biscuits. Warm two ounces of butter in as much skimmed milk as will make a pound of flour into a stiff paste, knead it well, and beat it with a paste roller; roll it out thin, cut the paste into round cakes with a glass, and prick them with a fork. Six minutes will bake them. Stamped biscuits are made by rubbing a quarter of a pound of butter into a pound of flour, then mix- ing it with cold water and a teaspoonful of yeast into a paste. Knead it till it is quite smooth; then cover it on the board with a basin for half an hour, and afterwards make it into balls, stamping each with the print. Abernethy biscuits may be made by adding cara- way seeds and a very little sugar to the above.

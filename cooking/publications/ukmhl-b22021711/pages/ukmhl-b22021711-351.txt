ORNAMENTAL DUCKS. 333 prefers the neighbourhood of a river to that of the sea. The voice of this bird when flying is said to resemble the tone of a clarinet; but in a state of confinement it bears more resemblance to the cry of a peacock. The shoveller, or broad-bill, is a fowl occa- sionally kept on ponds in pleasure-grounds. In a wild state it inhabits marshes and the muddy shores of lakes and rivers, and is generally con- sidered only a winter visiter to this country, though some remain every year to breed. They feed principally on insects, and are so fond of flies, that one of the common names of this species in France is canard gohe-mouche. The English name of shoveller alludes to the broad beak, each mandible of which is bordered with close-set rows of teeth resembling those of a weaverâ€™s reed, and which fitting into each other form a kind of sieve. With this beak the sho- veller digs up the soft mud, and, letting its watery particles escape, retains the very small worms and other insects which constitute the principal food of the bird. These ducks being very ornamental and curious, many attempts have been made to keep them on the ornamental pieces of water in the London parks and gardens, but hitherto with- out success; for I am told, on the authority of our excellent friend Captain Mangles, that, though they may appear healthy for a time, they are very apt to die off suddenly without any apparent cause.

THE GARDEN. ries, which is performed with the young, or un- ripened wood, and this is called herbaceous graft- ing, because the parts of the stem with which it is performed are as succulent as the stems of herba- ceous plants. In this kind of grafting, the shoot of the stock is broken off about two inches below the point, and all the leaves are taken off ex- cept two, one on each side, which are left to draw up the sap. The stock is then split with a very sharp knife between the leaves left on it; and, the base of the scion having been cut into a wedge- shape, it is fixed into the cleft made in the stock, which is bound tightly up with strips of cere- cloth, or coarse cotton cloth covered with grafting wax, made of equal parts of turpentine, beesâ€™ wax and rosin, with a little tallow, melted together. Inarching bears considerable resemblance to layering, as it is performed without separating the part which is to form the new plant. A branch is bent from a living plant and partly cut through, and, the tongue thus formed being introduced into a slit made in another plant, the two are bound closely together. It is obvious that this mode of grafting, which is called inarching, can only be practised with plants in pots, as it requires the two plants that are to be united to be brought close together, and to remain so till the graft has taken effect. You must observe that, in all kinds of grafting

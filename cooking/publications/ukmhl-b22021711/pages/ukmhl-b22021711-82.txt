THE HOUSE. these vegetables may be cut in slices and fried in butter, and then stewed till tender in the soup, which should have been previously thickened with a little butter worked up with flour. On other occasions, the soup may be varied by adding mac- caroni, rice, or vermicelli, or, in fact, any thing else usually added to soups; or partridges or gib- lets may be stewed in it, according to circum- stances. The receipt for this excellent stock is taken from Dr. Hunter’s Receipts in Modern Cookery; and the following is another from the same work, of much richer quality, but which I have also tried and found excellent: — Take beef, mutton, and veal, of each equal parts. Cut the meat into small pieces, and put it into a deep saucepan with a close cover; the beef at the bottom, then the mutton, with a piece of lean bacon, some whole pepper black and white, a large onion in slices, and a bundle of sweet herbs. Over these put the veal. Cover up close, and put the pan over a slow fire for ten minutes, shak- ing it now and then. After this pour on as much boiling water as will a little more than cover the meat. Stew gently for the space of eight hours, then put in two anchovies chopped, and season with salt to the taste. Strain off and preserve for use. If properly made this gravy will become a rich jelly, which will keep good a long time, and a piece of which may be cut out occasionally.

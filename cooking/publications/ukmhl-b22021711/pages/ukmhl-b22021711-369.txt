MANAGEMENT OF SILK-WORMS. 351 day. After changing its skin a third time, the silk-worm becomes of a flesh colour, and eats so greedily that it should be kept supplied with a succession of leaves all day long. After the next change the silk-worm eats abundantly night and day, and should be kept warm. It now begins to get restless, and instead of eating is continually stretching out its head as though it were in search of something; its body will have become trans- parent, of a clear pearly hue, with bands of gold colour. Little bits of wood should now be fixed on the shelves in such a way as to give the in- sects a feeling of security; and they will imme- diately begin to make their cocoons, which they will complete in from four to seven days. When the insects have done working, the cocoons are taken from the sticks, and a few being selected to breed from, the rest are prepared for unwind- ing. The insects enclosed are first killed, either by putting them in bags and enclosing them for half an hour in an oven heated to 88Â°; or by putting them in sieves, and, after covering them closely with a woollen cloth, placing the sieves over boiling water or boiling spirits of any kind. The insects being killed, the loose or floss silk is removed from the cocoons, and they are put by handfuls into basins of hot water, which has been heated almost to the boiling point; and the co- coons are stirred round in it for a few minutes

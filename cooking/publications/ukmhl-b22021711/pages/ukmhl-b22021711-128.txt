When all is prepared, the morning’s new milk, together with the cream from the last night’s milking, is put into a narrow, but deep, circular pan, and the liquid rennet put to it. As soon as the curd is formed, it is very care- fully removed from the pan, without breaking it, if possible, and laid on a deep circular sieve; where it is slightly pressed, in order that the whey may drain from it. It is then put into the cheese- vat, which should be ten inches and a half deep, and eight inches and a quarter over, with a move- able hoop of wood on the top, over which a piece of flat board is generally laid. As soon as the cheese has acquired a sufficient consistency, it is removed from the vat and firmly bound round with a clean cloth, which is changed every day, and the cheese bound tighter and tighter, till at last it becomes sufficiently firm to stand alone. Every time the cloth is changed, the cheese is wiped at the top and bottom and turned, so that each end may be equally level. When it has become sufficiently firm to support itself without the cloth, the cheese is removed to the cheese- room ; but it still requires to be turned twice a day, and brushed, for about three months.

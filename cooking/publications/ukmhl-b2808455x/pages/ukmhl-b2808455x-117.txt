113 PLAIN COOKING mix with it a little salt, pepper, and mustard, and about a teaspoonful of castor sugar, also vinegar according to the amount of horse- radish, and a good quantity of cream. Stir them well together so that they are about the consistency of double cream. Do not put too much vinegar. If preferred, the sauce can be warmed to serve with the hot joint by placing it in a jar in a saucepan of warm water, gently stirring until it is well heated; but on no account let it boil. 227. Chestnut Sauce Split the chestnuts, and throw into boiling water, in which there is a little salt; when sufficiently cooked remove the husks. Then boil in milk until tender enough to rub through a sieve ; season with salt, pepper, and mace, and warm up again with either milk or cream. It takes very little cream, which is far pre- ferable. 228. Celery Sauce This sauce is very nice with boiled turkey or fowls. It can be prepared beforehand, so that there is nothing to do but to warm it up. After the celery is washed, cut it into pieces.

PLAIN COOKING *54 almonds, with which thoroughly stick the cake when it is sufficiently soaked. Have ready a good custard to place round the cake—not pouring any over it—and put a few ratafias or crystallised cherries on the custard. 318. Tipsy Cake with Jam For this cake you require small sponge cakes, which must also be stale. Cut them in halves, and place jam between each half. Pour over some sherry and brandy, and let soak. Make a custard and pour over them, and grate a little nutmeg lightly on the top. 319. Trifle Line a trifle or deep glass dish with sponge cakes, macaroons, savoy fingers, and ratafias. Spread over this a cover of jam or jams, as several kinds, such as apricot and strawberry, blend well together. Then thoroughly soak with wine and brandy, or any kind of spirit you fancy. Cover with boiled custard, and then put the whipped cream—which must be prepared over night—lightly on the top, garnishing with strips of angelica, blanched almonds, and a few crystallised cherries or other fruit cut small.

46 PLAIN COOKING lamb needs more cooking. Well baste, and when nearly done, put nearer the fire and brown up. Allow at least half an hour to the pound, and serve with mint sauce. A salad of lettuce or cucumber is a great acquisition. 89. Roast Pore Quarter of Lamb Cook very slowly until the meat is tho- roughly well done, basting the while, and well brown before serving. A piece of butter, lemon, and cayenne pepper should be taken to table with this dish to place between the shoulder and the ribs when the shoulder is cut off. Should you not be a very expert carver, it is better to have the shoulder cut off before it reaches table. Serve with mint sauce. 90. Roast Veal Fillet of veal is usually selected for roasting, but the breast and shoulder make a very delicious dish. Introduce some forcemeat; and also make some forcemeat balls to serve round. Well baste, and cook very gently until nearly done; then brown up. Veal should be well cooked, or it is unwholesome. Boiled or grilled bacon or pickled pork should always accompany this dish. Garnish with lemon.

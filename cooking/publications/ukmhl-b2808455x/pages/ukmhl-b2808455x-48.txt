Serve some of the liquor in which the joint has been cooked ; also the carrots. Make some caper sauce, and serve in a tureen. A little veal added to the liquor makes a nice white stock. 84. To Boil Half a Leg of Mutton When you do not require a large joint, the leg may be cut in halves. To retain the gravy, make a paste of flour and water, and cover the cut end; or a suet crust may be used and served with the joint. Tie in a cloth so as to secure the crust. Put in cold water, with a little salt and an onion pierced with a clove. The carrots and turnips may be cooked separately, ac- cording to taste. Be careful not to boil, but simmer gently for about three hours. v 85. Shoulder of Mutton H; The favourite way of cooking a shoulder of mutton is to bake it with surrounding potatoes. Put some dripping over the joint, and a dust- ing of flour. When the dripping has melted, introduce the potatoes—if they are very large cut them in halves,—and cook in a moderate oven. Onion sauce should always be served

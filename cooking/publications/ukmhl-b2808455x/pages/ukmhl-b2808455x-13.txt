PLAIN COOKING. 1. The Stock Pot Of course the stock pot is the base of all soups, and of much else in cookery; but unless the establishment be large, I advise that stock be made from time to time in a capacious saucepan. I have known the stock pot to degenerate into an unwholesome stodge of refuse. To make a good, jellied stock, take a pound and a half of knuckle of veal, well chopped, and a pound of shin of beef. Add any bacon or meat trimmings convenient, but no game bonesâ€”their flavour is pervasive. Put from three to four quarts of water to the meat indicated, celery, carrots, a little turnip, onions, parsley, and mixed herbs, pepper and salt. Boil, then simmer four or five hours. Then boil up quickly and strain. B

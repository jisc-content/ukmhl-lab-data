PLAIN COOKING 95 Have ready some mince of any kind of meat well seasoned, and in a nice rich gravy. Fill the rings, while still hot, with the mince, and garnish with fried parsley. When frying the rings, fry some small pieces of bread to place on the top of the mince as covers. 188. To Poach Eggs For poaching eggs it is always better to reserve a pan exclusively; and a steel pan will be found preferable to an enamelled pan. You must first break your eggs separately into a cup, and should there be one among them which has spread, reserve it for cooking purposes ; one spoiled egg ruins an entire dish. Have ready a pan of boiling water, then place in it a small piece of salt; a few drops of vinegar may be added, but it is far preferable to cook them without. Then place the eggs in the pan, and skim off the scum as it arises. The eggs ought to come out thoroughly covered with white, showing no yoke at all. 189. Oeufs sur le plat A welcome addition to the breakfast-table is made by serving eggs on the dish on which they have been cooked. It is also very simple.

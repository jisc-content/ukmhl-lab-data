74 PLAIN COOKING cook this dish quicker ; it ruins it. Put plenty of water or stock, as the steam from them is a great aid in cooking the potatoes. 146. Veal and Ham Pie The fillet of veal is the best part from which to make a pie. There is no waste. It is much better to partially cook the veal before adding the crust. Cut the veal into pieces as you would for cutlets, and put them in the pie- dish with water or stock to cover them well. Simmer gently in the oven, covering with a dish or plate to prevent the meat browning. Sprinkle some flour, mixed herbs, pepper, and salt; add forcemeat balls, which should be placed in at the same time as some rolled bacon or pieces of ham and hard-boiled eggs cut in pieces, and a sprinkling of flour to thicken the gravy. When cold, put the crust on and bake gently. 147. Pigeon Pie Halve the pigeons and cut off the feet. Place them in a pie-dish with some nicely cut pieces of rump steak, covering with a good stock, and dust in a few savoury herbs, pepper, and salt, Place in the oven, and partially cook.

PLAIN COOKING 128 has been added, also a pinch of salt. Let the water be boiling, and cook from twenty to thirty minutes. Strain and serve with white sauce. 257. Turnips Peel the turnips very thickly, for the outside is inclined to be rough. Should there be any that are woody in the centre, discard them (unless for flavouring purposes). If you mash them, one woody turnip will spoil the whole dish. Cut the turnips in halves or quarters, and put them into boiling water with a little salt, and boil from thirty to forty minutes. 258. Mashed Turnips In mashing turnips, the great thing is to have ready a hot basin. First strain off the turnips, and let them drain in the colander. When thoroughly well drained, place them in the basin and well beat them with a rolling- pin until they are quite smooth, adding to them butter, pepper, and salt. A little milk may also be used, but they are preferable mashed without, if possible.

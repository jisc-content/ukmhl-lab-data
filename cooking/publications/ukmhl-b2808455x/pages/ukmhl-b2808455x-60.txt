56 PLAIN COOKING baste with milk until cooked. Do not neglect the basting. 115. Jugged Hare Disjoint the hare and flour each joint, and fry in butter with an onion or two, according to size. Place in a stew jar, covering with stock. Put in a muslin bag some peppercorns, allspice and herbs, so that they can be re- moved before serving. Put the jar in the oven, and let it remain for quite four hours, then add a tumbler of port wine; and when quite heated again place the hare upon a dish. Make a thickening of flour and a little ketchup, and boil up and pour over the hare. Garnish with forcemeat balls, and serve with red cur- rant jelly. 116. Jugged Rabbit Having jointed your rabbit, put it in a frying pan with a little butter and some slices of onion and mixed herbs. When the rabbit is sufficiently browned, place it in an earthen- ware fire-proof jar in the oven, just covering it with water to prevent burning. When nearly cooked, add about a pint of claret, and make a thickening in the usual way of flour sauce, etc.

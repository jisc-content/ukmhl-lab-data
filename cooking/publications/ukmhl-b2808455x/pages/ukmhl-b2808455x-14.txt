PLAIN COOKING 10 SOUPS 2. Mutton Broth Disjoint, and thoroughly cleanse in water the scrag end of a neck of mutton. Place the meat in a saucepan, allowing one pint of water (or a little more) to each pound. Onions, carrots, and a turnip are required for flavour- ing, not forgetting a bunch of sweet herbs, some celery, and pearl barley. Let the in- gredients stew gently for two or three hours. Just before serving sprinkle over the soup a little parsley chopped to extreme fine- ness. 3. Scotch Broth This is most acceptable in cold weather, but seasonable at any time. It should be prepared overnight, so that the fat may be skimmed before the completing ingredients are added. The middle of the neck of mutton is best. Cut it into chops, place in a stewpan with onions and turnips, and stew till quite tender. Remove the chops from the stock; add some pearl barley, and when nearly cooked replace the chops. Serve with a sprinkling of pars- ley. It is most essential to skim the stock.

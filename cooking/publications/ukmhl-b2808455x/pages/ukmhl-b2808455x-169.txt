Sauces for Puddings A very simple way of making wine sauce is to boil together for a few minutes a quarter of a pound of loaf sugar in a quarter of a pint of water until slightly thickened; then add three tablespoonsful of sherry, brandy, or rum, and one tablespoonful of very finely grated lemon- peel. Take either arrowroot or cornflour, and mix with milk and a little grated lemon-peel. Boil some milk and pour over, well stirring. Put altogether in the saucepan, and boil up, stirring the same way the whole while, adding a little brandy or sherry, and castor sugar. Beat to a cream equal quantities of fresh butter and brown sugar, adding thereto a few drops of lemon juice and a little grated nut- meg, flavouring with either wine, rum, or brandy. THE END

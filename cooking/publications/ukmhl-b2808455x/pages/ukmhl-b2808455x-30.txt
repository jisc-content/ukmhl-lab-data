PLAIN COOKING 26 39. Scallops of Cod au Gratin Well butter the scallop shells, and scatter a few bread-crumbs in each; then some flakes of fish. Make a white sauce, adding to it ground mace, cayenne pepper, and a little grated lemon peel. Put a little over the fish ; then add more bread-crumbs and some finely grated cheese. Superadd little dabs of butter, bake a nice brown, and serve very hot. 40. Codâ€™s Roe Fried Boil the roe in water with a little vinegar and salt for fifteen or twenty minutes. Let it get cold, then cut in slices and roll in egg and bread-crumbs, or batter, and fry. 41. Boiled Turbot Soak the fish in salt and water for some hours before cooking. Then rub it with lemon, and place in hot water. Gradually boil, removing all scum as it arises. Let the fish simmer very gently, and never let it boil until cooked. This you can test by the flesh readily leaving the bone. Drain well and serve on a napkin, garnished with lemon and parsley. Lobster or shrimp sauce should accompany this dish.

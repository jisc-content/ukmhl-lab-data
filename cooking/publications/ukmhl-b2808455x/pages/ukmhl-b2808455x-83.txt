79 PLAIN COOKING hours. Make a thickening of flour and a little more curry powder, and serve on a very hot dish, garnished with rice. 157. Fried Liver and Bacon Be careful that the bacon is not too leanâ€” the fat should flavour the liver. Fry the bacon, and arrange on the dish. Cut the liver in thin slices, and flour them, and place in the frying-pan. If there be not enough fat from the bacon, more should have been added, and allowed to get hot. When the liver is cooked, place it on the dish with the bacon, pour the fat out of the frying-pan, and have ready some gravy, which boil up in the pan, and strain over. Liver should not be over- cooked, or it will become tough. 158. Toad in the Hole Make a batter, and place it in a well-greased tin or dish. Take some chops, so small that they shall not require longer cooking than the batter; cut slightly through the fat of the chops to let the dripping out, and place them in the batter, with a dusting of pepper and salt.

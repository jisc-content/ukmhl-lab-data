PLAIN COOKING 102 poured over—about a teaspoonful of salt, some pepper, and a very slight pinch of mustard, a tablespoonful of vinegar, and between two and three of salad oil. Beat all well together till the ingredients are thoroughly well mixed, then gradually put the leaves in, breaking them as you do so. Thoroughly well stir, and serve at once, for a salad should be eaten as soon as made, though it does not matter how long the dressing is prepared. Chopped onion is a great improvement, also a little fresh tarragon when it can be obtained, or a few drops of tarragon vinegar. Always keep the oil in the dark and cool, and it is better not to remove the paper from the bottle. 203. Potato Salad Cold potatoes may be used up by making them into a salad—a delicious one. You mix the same ingredients as for a plain salad, with the exception that you require a little more vinegar, for the potatoes absorb more than the lettuce. Also you should add some finely- minced parsley to the dressing. Cut the potatoes into slices (not too thick), and then thoroughly mix. Potato salad needs more onion than plain salad.

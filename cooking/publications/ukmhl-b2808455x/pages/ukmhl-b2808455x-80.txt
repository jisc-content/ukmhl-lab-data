76 PLAIN COOKING Make a nice light suet paste, and cover with it. Have ready a saucepan of boiling water, into which plunge the pudding, having pre- viously dipped the cloth in boiling water. On no account refill a saucepan with any other than boiling water, as it will harden the crust. Avoid taking the lid off the saucepan as much as possible. 150. Rabbit Pie Disjoint the rabbit, and soak in warm water to whiten the meat. Arrange the joints care- fully in a pie-dish with slices of fat pickled pork, and cook for a little while. Then add some forcemeat balls, a little ground mace, pepper, salt, and hard-boiled eggs cut in slices. Let this get cold, then place the crust in position, and bake gently. 151. Brown Sweetbreads Cut the sweetbreads into slices, and simmer them gently in milk and water, with a flavour- ing of lemon-peel, mace, pepper, and salt. When quite tender, strain them off and fry in egg and bread-crumbs until a nice brown. Peas make a pleasant addition served round the dish. Brown gravy should be poured over.

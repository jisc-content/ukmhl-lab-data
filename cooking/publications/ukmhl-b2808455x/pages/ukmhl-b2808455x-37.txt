33 PLAIN COOKING about an inch and a half long and half an inch wide. Great care must be taken not to break the flakes or leave jagged edges to the little pieces, which may be fried in a whitebait basket, egged, and rolled in very fine bread- crumbs, or fried in the ordinary way. Serve very hot, with fried parsley round, lemon, brown bread and butter. This is a very nice way of serving fish to invalids. 58. Salt Fish Before cooking, soak for two or three hours in cold water, occasionally changing it. Put in cold water, and serve with egg sauce. Boiled parsnips generally accompany this dish. 59. Fresh Herrings Soused Place the herrings (after they are cleansed and the heads removed), in vinegar and water, with peppercorns, spice, and a bay leaf. Cook in the oven. Let the fish cool in the liquor in which they have been cooked. 60. Fresh Herrings Grilled Well cleanse, but do not have the fish cut open, as it is very delicate and liable to break.

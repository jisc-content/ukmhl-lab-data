4i PLAIN COOKING 77. Oyster Patties Remove the beards; strain the liquor, and pour into a saucepan, and simmer the oysters for about five minutes, but do not let them boil, as that would harden them. Take them out and cut into small pieces, and replace in the stew- pan with their liquor ; add a small quantity of anchovy essence, a squeeze of lemon, pepper and salt, and a piece of butter mixed with flour. Let the whole boil for about ten minutes to a quarter of an hour, stirring all the while. Then squeeze in a half lemon, and add a little powdered mace, then fill the patty cases, and serve very hot. Patty cases may be obtained from a good confectioner. 78. Devilled Oysters Oysters cooked in this way do not take long to cook. Be careful not to lose any of their juice whilst opening and removing the beard, as they have to be cooked in the shell with the juice. Place under the oyster in each shell a small piece of butter, cayenne, and a squeeze of lemon, and on the top a small piece of butter to each shell, then cook quickly either in the oven or under a gas grid. Serve very hot, accompanied by brown bread and butter and lemon. D

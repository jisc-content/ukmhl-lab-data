PLAIN COOKING 57 Serve on a very hot dish. If a few forcemeat balls are served round the dish, and a few pieces of toasted bacon, this will quite take the place of jugged hare, and is much more economical. 117. Baked Rabbits Take away the liver, heart, etc., which reserve for gravy. With a little gravy beef, or any stock you may have, make an ordinary forcemeat stuffing, with which fill the rabbits, sewing up the opening. In placing them in the tin to bake, be sure and put in a little cold water, so that they shall not become dry. Well flour them, add plenty of dripping, and keep well basting. The time of cooking de- pends of course on the heat of the oven and the size of the rabbits. Before serving take out the liver, and chop not too finely, and place over the rabbit, which must be disjointed before sending to table. Then cover with the sauce that has been made from the stock, adding a glass of port or sherry to the thicken- ing. There need be no wine used in the gravy, but with the wine-gravy and bread sauce the dish can very well pass for hare. 118. Boiled Rabbit A rabbit looks better disjointed for serving E

Soak them in salt and water for five or six days, frequently stirring them with a wooden spoon; then place them upon an old sieve or tray to dry. Be sure they are thoroughly dry, or else they will become mouldy. In the case of walnuts, the vinegar and spice should be placed upon them hot; though it may be allowed to go cold should the pickle not be required for immediate eating. 211. To Pickle Onions In pickling onions a little Demerara sugar makes an immense difference. Peel the onions or eschalots; rub them well in a dry clean cloth, and place them in the bottle or jar, sprinkling each layer with salt and a little sugar. Boil the vinegar and spice, and let it remain until cold; then pour over the onions. Cover with brown paper, and tie firmly down. In about a fortnight they will be fit for use, though they will retain their crispness any length of time if they are kept air- tight, and the vinegar is allowed to get entirely cold before its introduction to the onions.

69 PLAIN COOKING soak for a short time in salt and water, and then place in the saucepan, in which you have previously put the amount of stock adequate to the stew required, a layer of potatoes and onions, and a sprinkling of sweet herbs and parsley, then the meat with pepper and salt, and cover again with another layer of potatoes and onions, and simmer for an hour or two according to the quantity of meat. Do not let the stew boil, and do not frequently remove the lid, for by so doing you let out the steam and harden the meat. 137. Lancashire Hot-Pot You need an earthenware stew jar to make the hot-pot in the oven. Well line the jar with potatoes, onions, and a small quantity of chopped parsley, and add to it the meat which has been well trimmed, a few mixed herbs, and some water. Place another layer of potatoes on the top of the meat, not forgetting a few slices of onion. Put into the oven, and let it stew gently for two or three hours. Do not remove the lid of the jar while cooking. The lean part of the neck of mutton is most service- able for this dish, though the shin of beef may be used, in which case add a few carrots.

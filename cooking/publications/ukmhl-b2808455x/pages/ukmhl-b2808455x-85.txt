PLAIN COOKING 81 have too many, as they boil away in the cooking. Be sure in cooking tripe never to use a saucepan or stewpan that has ever burned in the boiling, for it is bound to do the same thing again with milk cooking. Well cover the tripe with milk, and carefully watch. As the milk boils away, replenish, and stir gently as you put in the fresh milk. Pepper and salt should, of course, be added to the tripe when the onions are put in. Let them stew for at least three hours, if not for longer ; and just before serving make a thickening of flour, butter, pepper, salt, and milk, and then boil carefully, stirring the while. Do not on any account thicken until ready to serve. 162. Pried Tripe Tripe can be used as a breakfast dish when fried. Scald it for twenty minutes, and let it get cold; then cut in slices, and dip in egg and bread-crumb, or a stiff batter, and drop into boiling fat, and fry a crisp brown. Well drain, and place on a dish-paper with some fried parsley and rolled bacon. Cooked tomatoes also make a pleasant addition to this dish. 163.

PLAIN COOKING 163 stewpan, with the finely-pared rind of a lemon, a small piece of whole cinnamon, a pinch of salt, and a couple of cloves, also a little dried saffron, and half a pound of loaf sugar. Beat well together the whites of two eggs and their shells, which add and boil up, stirring all the while, until the whites of the eggs set thickly on the top. Then put in what flavouring you prefer, sherry, rum, or brandy, and stir, but do not boil again. Have the jelly bags ready near the fire, and let drip into a basin; then pour into moulds previously rinsed in cold water. One bullockâ€™s foot prepared in the same way will answer the purpose. 344. Mince Meat A very simple way of making mincemeat is to finely chop one pound of suet, one pound of muscatel raisins (which are better stoned at home than bought ready done), one pound of currants, one pound of apples, one pound of sultanas, and a pound of Demerara sugar. Grate the rinds of two lemons and an orange, and add the juice of both the lemons and the orange grated; nutmeg and allspice. Stir thoroughly, adding to it rum and brandy until of a sufficient moisture, then place in jars, and tie down tightly until required for use. This

PLAIN COOKING 75 Add some rolled bacon or slices of bam and hard-boiled eggs. Scald the feet, and make an opening in the crust, into which place them. 148. Giblet Pie Giblet pie makes a very palatable dish, whether served hot or cold. The giblets need thoroughly cleansing and soaking in salt and water. After the giblets are thoroughly cleansed, place them in a saucepan with some savoury herbs, pepper, etc., and let them gently simmer for a couple of hours, adding either some skirt of beef or beef steak. Let them get thoroughly cold, then place in a pie- dish, add some pieces of bacon and one or two hard-boiled eggs, and then place the crust upon the pie. The time necessary to cook the pie will be sufficient to cook the bacon. If eaten hot, a dripping crust will be found quite sufficient. 149. Giblet Pudding A very economical and tasty dish can be made by using giblets in a pudding. After the giblets have been well washed and cleansed, place them in a pudding basin, adding to them water, sweet herbs, onions, pepper, salt, etc.

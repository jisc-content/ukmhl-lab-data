72 PLAIN COOKING not forget to shake the stewpan continually, whether the meat be raw or cookedâ€”it burns so easily, and then the dish is spoiled. Never let the ragout boil; only simmer. Careless cooking is the secret of most tough and tasteless stews. 142. Ragout of Rabbit Disjoint the rabbit, and fry with onions; then place in a stewpan, covering with stock or water; a carrot finely sliced, celery, pep- per, salt, and a sprinkling of herbs. When partially cooked, add some slices of either pickled pork or bacon. When cooked, arrange on a dish, garnishing with the rabbit or pork. Make a thickening of flour sauce and a squeeze of lemon. Boil up and pour over the rabbit. 143. Italian Cutlets Cut fillet of beef into small pieces, and have ready some finely-grated bread-crumbs, to which has been added a shalot and some minced parsley and a little pepper and salt. Place them into a pan of boiling fat, and fry until they are a nice brown. They may be served either with or without gravy. Cold under-done beef will serve the purpose equally.

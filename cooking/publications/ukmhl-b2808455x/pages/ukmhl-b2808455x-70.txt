66 PLAIN COOKING a saucepan with a good-sized piece of butter, a dusting of flour, and pepper and salt. Well shake the saucepan till the kidneys have browned, then add a little water, and let them simmer for about twenty minutes, and you will find them deliciously tender, a nice rich gravy coming from them. Then place round the dish some shoes of bacon which have been previously grilled. Tomatoes baked and served with the bacon and kidneys make a very effective dish. 133. Stewed Pigeons and Kidneys Cut the pigeons in halves, and put them in a saucepan or stewpan. Just cover them with water or stock, pepper, salt, etc., to keep them simmering. When nearly cooked, add to them some sheepâ€™s kidneys, cut in halves, or some ox kidney, cut into small pieces. When making the thickening, the addition of a few mushrooms gives a nice flavour, or a few tomatoes, previously cooked and served round the dish, have the double effect of making the dish look nicer, and also go much farther. If you cannot obtain fresh mushrooms, there are some very excellent bottled.

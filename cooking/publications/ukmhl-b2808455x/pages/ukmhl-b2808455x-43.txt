Then place the fish, which must have previously been pulled into flakes with two forks (not steel); add to it the remaining sauce from the fish, and spice to taste.

Fish Pie au Gratin Take a nice-sized lemon sole, and fillet it yourself, or see that your fishmonger sends the bones with itâ€”you need them for stock. Well butter the dish, and line the sides with a little mashed potato. Cut your fillets in halves and roll them, stand them upright in the dish. Add your stock, which should be made thus : Simmer the bones very gently in milk, to which has been added a small onion pierced with a clove, a little mace, nutmeg, and a thin shred of lemon-peel. When the stock is ready, strain it into the dish; cover with grated bread-crumbs. Then grate the cheese on to the bread-crumbs. Put little pieces of butter on the top, and bake a nice brown. When cooked this way, you cannot tell the lemon soles from the Dover soles.

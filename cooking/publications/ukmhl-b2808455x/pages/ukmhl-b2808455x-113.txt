109 PLAIN COOKING manner :â€”Pull tlie remains of rolls or bread into pieces, and let them soak a while in warm milk and water. Carefully squeeze them so that the pieces do not lose their shape, which should be as rocky as possible. Place in a tin, and bake in a moderate oven until a nice brown. 217. Macaroni Cheese Boil a quarter of a pound of macaroni in half a pint of milk until quite tender, seasoning with pepper, salt, and cayenne; sprinkle it with a piece of butter, some grated cheese, and a few bread-crumbs. Take up and put into a fire-proof dish, adding more cheese, bread- crumbs, and butter, and either brown in front of a fire or under a gas grill. 218. Sage and Onion Stuffing Do not boil the onions. Let them scald in boiling water for ten or fifteen minutes. Then grate them finely, adding a little sage (which must be scalded if fresh), pepper and salt, and a little bread-crumb. Be sparing with the sage, for it tends to make the stuffing bitter and unpalatable. For ducks or geese the stuffing may be mixed with eggs.

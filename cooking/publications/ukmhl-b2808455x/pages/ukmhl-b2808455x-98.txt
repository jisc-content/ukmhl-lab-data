PLAIN COOKING 94 rasher or two of bacon. These will easily cook on the griller of a gas stove, and take only about ten minutes, as the splitting of the sausages equalises the time required for the cooking of the cutlets. The bacon takes even less time. A few tomatoes will cook in the oven while the other things are on the grill, and served round the dish make a very nice garnishing, as well as adding a great relish to the dish. 186. Another Grill A piece of the fillet of steak also makes an excellent breakfast dish, served with sausages and kidneys. The kidneys can either be grilled with the steak, or stewed according to oneâ€™s fancy, and a few mushrooms give a great piquancy to the dish. Should you stew the kidneys the mushrooms may stew in the same jar or saucepan, and be either served on the same dish as the steak, or in a tureen as a sauce. 187. A Supper Dish A very charming and appetising supper dish can be made in the following manner : Out some thick slices of stale bread into rings with a pastry cutter, and scoop out the middle. Fry them in fat a light brown, and well drain them.

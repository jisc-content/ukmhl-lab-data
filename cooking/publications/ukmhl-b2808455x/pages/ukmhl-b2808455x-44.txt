40 PLAIN COOKING 74. Scollops of Lobster Carefully dissect the remnants of the fish, and have ready some well-buttered scollop shells, into which you have placed a few finely- grated bread-crumbs, to which add the lobster, some butter, pepper, salt, and a little ground mace, not forgetting a little grated lemon- peel. Cover well over with more grated bread- crumbs, and a liberal allowance of butter, and bake in a brisk oven, and serve in the shells. 75. Mayonnaise of Lobster Be sure the salad is thoroughly well dried. Rub the bowl lightly with garlic. Then place in the salad and the lobster cut in pieces. Pour over the Mayonnaise sauce and mix. Garnish with some more salad, hard-boiled eggs cut in slices, beetroot, capers or olives. 76. Scolloped Oysters Be sure the liquor is preserved when the oysters are opened, and that the beard is removed. Well butter the scollop shells, and place in them some bread-crumbs, then the oysters and a little of the liquor, which should be strained. To each shell add a squeeze of lemon and a little cayenne pepper. Cover well with bread-crumbs and small nobs of butter ; bake in the oven, and serve very hot.

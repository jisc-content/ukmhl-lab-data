58 PLAIN COOKING at table; but that, of course, is a matter of taste. Before boiling, soak in warm water, to which a little salt has been added. You need pickled pork with rabbit, and that will take longer to cook. Having soaked it in cold water, put it in the saucepan with an onion pierced with a clove. Let the rabbit go into boiling water with the pork, then pull to the side and simmer gently until cooked. In serving, smother in onion sauce ; of course, serving the pork on another dish. Mashed turnips make a very agreeable accompani- ment to this dish. 119. Plain Stewed Rabbit Have the rabbit disjointed, and well soak in warm salt and water. Thoroughly rinse it, and then place in a stewpan or saucepan with a few slices of pickled pork. If you should have any white stock, well cover with it; if not, use water. Put in a small bunch of herbs, onions, carrot, and one small turnip. Let all simmer for about an hour, then make a thickening of flour, pepper, salt, and a pinch of mace, with the addition of a little finely-chopped parsley and a small piece of butter. Then boil up and serve.

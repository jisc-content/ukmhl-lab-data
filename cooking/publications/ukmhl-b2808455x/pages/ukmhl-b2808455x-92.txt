88 PLAIN COOKING mace, and a little grated nutmeg. Make a thickening of flour, butter, and milk, and when the slices of meat are thoroughly warmed, pour a little of the stock on the thickening, and let it gently boil. Then serve over the slices of mutton. You have still the bone and the remainder of the stock, of which to make another dish—either hash or Irish stew. 173. Minced Veal A simple and economical way of using up cold veal is to mince it. The addition of poached eggs serve two purposes—to make it go further, and also to embellish the dish. Mince the veal minutely, and in mincing, add on a little lemon-peel, finely grated, some mace, and nutmeg. Should you be making your mince from the remains of boiled veal, you will have your stock ready, with the exception of a little onion, which may be chopped with the veal; if from roast veal, you must put the bones on to stew, with just enough water to cover them, adding onion, sweet herbs, mace, etc. After it is well boiled up, strain off, and put it to cool. Make a thickening, in the ordinary way, of flour, pepper, salt; and serve with sippets of toast and bacon.

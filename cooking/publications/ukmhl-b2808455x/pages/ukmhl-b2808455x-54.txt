PLAIN COOKING 50 roll, and put it to cook in cold water. Boil, then allow to simmer gently till cooked. Then take it up and let it go cold before removing the string. This makes a nice breakfast or supper dish. 99. Roast Fowls Fowls may either be stuffed with forcemeat, or with parsley finely chopped, a little bread- crumb and savoury herbs well mixed with a piece of butter ; or they may be cooked with- out. They need well basting and gentle cooking, averaging about an hour. Rolled or boiled bacon, bread sauce, and a good gravy, either with or without wine, should be served with them. 100. Boiled Fowl and Pickled Pork Well soak the pork and put it on in cold water. When it boils introduce the fowl, and continue to simmer gently. Unless the fowl is old or very large it should be well cooked in three- quarters of an hour or an hour. Serve with either lemon sauce or parsley butter, some of which pour over the fowl, and the remainder serve in a sauce boat.

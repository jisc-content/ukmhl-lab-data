PLAIN COOKING *9 pan of boiling milk and water, with an onion, and simmer until all can be rubbed through a sieve. Replace in cold milk, and when about to boil, pour upon the following thickening, and boil up :â€”cornflour, butter, pepper, salt, a very little grated lemon peel, and a pinch of mace. 22. Lentil Soup Let the lentils soak for an hour or two before putting them into the saucepan with a thin stock. (This soup can be made with water.) Add a bunch of herbs, onions, celery and carrots, pepper and salt, with a good seasoning of pepper, and when cooked to a pulp, rub through a sieve. If you are making this soup with water, add a piece of butter. 23. Vermicelli Soup For this soup you need a good thick clear stock, such as you make for gravy beef, of beef and veal. When the stock is about to boil, throw in the vermicelli, and let all boil well, stirring all the time. The vermicelli should cook no more than five minutes, or it will become a paste, and the soup will be ruined.

In French cookery or confectionery language the word glace has a three-fold meaning : anything coated or masked with sauce, aspic, jelly, meat glaze, sugar, or syrup, is called glace ; but the course known as glaces in this instance refers to sweet fruit pulp or juice, creams, or other sweet mixtures, which are by means of artificial freezing rendered nto semi-liquid or solid ice. There are several varieties of ices ; those known as cream and water ices are the most popular; whilst Souffles, Mousses, Parfaits, Sorbets, Bombes, Pouding glacis, and Pouding soufflSs, being somewhat more compli- cated, are termed compound ices or iced preparations. The names of the most popular ordinary ices are as follows :— Glace d la cr^me d’abricot — a la cr^me d'amande — ala crdme d'ananas — de crdme au cacao — au chocolat — crdme de framboises — au marasquin — au moka Apricot cream ice Almond cream ice Pineapple cream ice Cocoa cream ice Chocolate ice Raspberry cream ice Maraschino cream ice Coffee cream ice

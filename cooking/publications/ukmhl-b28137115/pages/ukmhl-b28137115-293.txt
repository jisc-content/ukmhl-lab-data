PLAIN AND SAVOURY OMELETS. 289 Omelettes—Omelets, An omelet is usually defined as a dish consisting of beaten and seasoned eggs, fried in butter over a quick fire, and shaped like a cushion. There are three varieties of omelets : the plain (simple and compound), the stuffed (puree), and the puffed (souffle omelets). An almost endless variety of omelets can be prepared either plain, compound, savoury or sweet, because the addition of a special ingredient often brings about a new name. As a savoury, the so-called omelettes fines herbes are the most favoured, the fine herbs being mainly represented by chopped parsley. A number of other omelets besides the savoury kinds are introduced in this register, most of which make admirable breakfast or lunch dishes. A little sauce or gravy is frequently served with an omelet, and should be poured round the base of the dish and not over the omelet.

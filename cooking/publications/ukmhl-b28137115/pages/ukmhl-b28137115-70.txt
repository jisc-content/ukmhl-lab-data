THE MENU BOOK. 66 PART II. HORS-D’CEUVRE—APPETISERS. The hors-d’oeuvre course, which forms the so-called prelude to a complete dinner, has of late become very popular. A very large variety of little dishes, both plain and dressed, can be served under this heading. These dishes to the thoughtful cook present one of the best opportunities for showing his or her skill and originality in combination and garnish. Such dishes must, however, be strictly con- fined to such colour and such material as will harmonise with the other dishes on the menu. Usually one or two plain and one dressed hors-d’oeuvre are served at a dinner, this being a matter of taste left to the maitre d’hotel or to the chef. Whatever the hors-d’oeuvre may consist of, let it be remembered that these httle side dishes are intended to stimulate and not satisfy the appetite, i.e., they must be tempting and smart in appearance, and the portions must be very small, so as not to impair the enjoyment of the remainder of the meal. These dishes are frequently placed on the table before the guests enter the dining-room ; and, when dressed in a pretty and dainty manner, they add greatly to the effective decoration of a table.

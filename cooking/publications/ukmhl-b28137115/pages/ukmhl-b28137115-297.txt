ROT I—ROAST. 293 PART XI. ROTl—ROAST. The dishes served under this heading form the second service of a dinner, and are known as the Roast, Rote, or Roti course. On the Continent the large joints of butchers’ meat are preferred as relev^ (remove), while in England, especially when that course is omitted, they are prepared as Roast. The essential part about this course is that the meat, poultry or game is roasted (cooked) before the fire on the spit, or else in the oven and is served with a nicely flavoured rich gravy. When a remove (joint) is served, the Roast consists of birds, game or poultry. When game is out of season, capons, poularde, turkey, duckling, duck, pigeon, guinea- fowl, etc., etc., are served instead. Game and poultry should be accompanied with the necessary bread sauce^ brown (fried) breadcrumbs, croutes of bread, garnished with watercress, chipped or other fried potatoes ; and a seasonable salad also forms a usual accompaniment with roast birds. Roast joints are not again mentioned here, because these have already been exhaustively treated in the part headed Releves—Removes.

PART XII. SALADES—SALADS. The variety of salads is almost endless : raw herbs or plants (salad plants) known as acetarious or succulent plants, hot or cold cooked vegetables, cold fish, shell fish, cooked poultry, game, and meat, and even fruits, in- differently mixed or blended together, form salads. It would, therefore, seem that almost everything edible can be converted into a salad. In a typical plain salad cabbage or cos lettuce forms the foundation, whilst the Russian salad, or salade Russe, is regarded as the most recherchd of dressed salads. Green or plain salads are unquestionably the most popular. The secret of these salads is, of course, the dressing, so that salad-making and salad-mixing is an art, and the complete mastery of it is granted to but few. With a little knowledge of how to please the palate, with careful and judicious use of seasoning materials, it is, however, possible for everyone to achieve fair success in this branch of the culinary art

lOI THE FISH COURSE. is cooked in various ways—boiled, steamed, baked, fried, stewed, and grilled. Almost every kind of fish gains in importance if served with a well-made sauce. When two fish are served at a dinner, the boiled or whole—i.e., solid—fish should be served before the fried, stewed or braised. Plain boiled potatoes or so-called fish potatoes, which are of marble shapes, sprinkled with chopped parsley, should be handed round with all solid fish cooked au natural, whilst boiled or grilled salmon should in all cases be accompanied by a dish of sliced cucumber, plainly dressed.

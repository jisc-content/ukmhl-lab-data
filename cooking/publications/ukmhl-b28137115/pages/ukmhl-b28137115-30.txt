THE MENU BOOK. 26 Dessert. Dessert. LUNCHEON MENUS. Menus des Dejeuners h la Fourchette. The French have two kinds of dejeuners : one is called "cl la Tasse,” being a plain breakfast, and the other " d la fourchette," which is equivalent to an English luncheon. The word “ lunch,” or luncheon,” is said to be derived from the Welsh llwne, which is a derivation of lump. In bygone days lunch or luncheon meant simply a lump of bread and cheese taken between meals, “ a frugal bit ” ; but now the lunch, more especially among the upper classes, has become a fashionable meal, and one quite as important as the dinner of former times. Few meals offer better opportunities for combining smart little dishes at comparatively small expense than the lunch or luncheon. There are plenty of dainty dishes which can be prepared with httle trouble, suitable as luncheon dishes, that can with advantage be brought within the scope of high-class cookery. The menus given below show what kinds of dishes are suitable for such repasts. SPECIMEN MENUS FOR SET LUNCHEONS. English.

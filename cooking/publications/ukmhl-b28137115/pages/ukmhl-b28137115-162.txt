THE MENU BOOK. 158 The great secret in entrees in general lies undoubtedly in the sauces used for their preparation or their accom paniment. All sauces should serve the purpose of liquid seasonings, and as such they must be rich and carefully prepared. Compound or long process sauces, foundation sauces and their offsprings, play a most important part in the entrees themselves, as well as in their relation to the dishes which precede and follow them ; their character, flavour, and colour must, of course, be studied so as to harmonise with the rest of the dishes selected for the same meal, more particularly so in the case of Dinner Entrees.

Hot Sweets generally consist of Puddings, Souffles, Croutes of Fruit, Fritters (Beignets), Savarins, Omelettes, Pancakes, etc., etc. ; whilst the Cold Sweets are usually composed of Jellies, Chartreuse of Fruits, Bordures, Tourtes, Fruit Pies, Bavarois, Cream Compotes, Macedoines, Trifles, Charlottes, Fancy Gateaux and Pastry, Frozen Puddings, Iced Creams and Puddings, Souffles, Ices, Plombieres, and various kinds of sweet- meats. Bon-bons, etc. 3. Savouries or Entremets Savoureux. These are commonly known as “ After-Dinner Savouries ” ; the dishes selected may be hot or cold, but they are more often served hot than cold. They must always be dressed in very small portions, and, above all, daintily. The most popular savouries are Cheese Savouries, Egg Savouries, and those made from Smoked Fish. Note.—Olives, Salted Almonds, Grisini (salted bread sticks), etc., are usually partaken and served just before the Sweet Entremets, their special object being to cleanse the palate. PART XIII.

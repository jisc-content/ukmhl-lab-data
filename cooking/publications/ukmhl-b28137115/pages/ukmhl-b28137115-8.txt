PREFACE. 4 those who can cook or superintend cooking to draft menus with greater ease, and to give each dish its proper French name. The adoption of French names in menus has become fashionable because most of the typical French dishes have become fully naturaUsed in the kitchens and on the tables of this country. It therefore becomes the duty of all persons interested in culinary matters to know how to describe them in correct French. The author can hardly expect that this book will bring about a revolution in the customs of gastronomy, but he does hope that its use will be the means of intro- ducing greater variety into the daily menus, and, if possible, economy in the preparation of dishes. Hence its mission should, if for no other purpose, prove practical and useful to such who avoid ordinary cookery books and fight shy of scientific culinary treatises. If such an aim is achieved the authorâ€™s efforts will be amply rewarded. The present, enlarged, edition contains a special chapter on the Art of Menu Compilation, as well as over 2,500 additional dishes. C. HERMAN SENN.

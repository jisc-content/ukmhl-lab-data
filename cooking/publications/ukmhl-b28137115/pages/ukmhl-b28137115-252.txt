248 THE MENU BOOK. PART VIII. RELEVES—REMOVES. (Grosses Pieces.) These are, as a rule, solid joints, such as saddle of lamb or mutton, loins of veal or mutton, legs of mutton or lamb, fricandeau of veal, fillets (whole), sirloin or ribs of beef, venison, deer, wild boar, ham, etc., and are roasted, braised or broiled, as the case may be. Boiled turkey, large fowls, capons, etc., are also at times served under this heading. Some kind of vegetable is usually sent with this course as an accompaniment or garnish. On the Continent, and occasionally in England, these dishes are often served after hors-d’oeuvre or after fish. It is, however, considered more correct to serve the remove after the entree course.

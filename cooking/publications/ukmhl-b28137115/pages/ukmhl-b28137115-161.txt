PART VII. THE ENTREE COURSE. Dishes following the fish course or preceding the Remove, when such is served, are called entrees ; which, being translated into English, means “ entrance.” Hence the dishes served under this heading are considered by the epicure as the first of the essential dishes of a correct dinner, and rightly so, because there may be dinners without hors-d’oeuvre, and even without soup, or without a remove or releve, but there can be no proper dinner without an entree course. Entrees are generally defined as “ dressed dishes,” or ” made dishes.” A dish bearing the name ” entree ” is, as a general rule, composed of more than one ingredient, and there should always be a distinction from roast or boiled meat served with a vegetable or other garnish and an entree. When two entrees are chosen in a dinner, the first should be the lighter of the two. All entrees should be made in fancy style, so as to avoid carving ; for entrees should not be carved or served from the sideboard. During Lent (mi-careme) dishes known as fish entrees, excepting in the case of cold dishes, are usually allowable as entrees.

PART V. S A U C E 5. The importance of sauce in cookery is so w^ell known that I need not offer any excuse for including the definitions of all the standard sauces and the most popular of other liquid seasonings in this book. In almost every instance some kind of sauce is named along with, or as an ingredient in, the preparation of dishes. Again, the blending of two or more sauces is frequently recommended, so that we have given the names of these, together with a condensed description of the kinds most frequently required. It is needless to add that the blending of a sauce, its flavour and colour, has much to do with the success of any dish with which it is served, whilst the harmonising effect, or the want of it, may make or spoil a dish listed on a menu.

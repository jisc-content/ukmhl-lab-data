So different from ordinary sandwiches, which often are far from being palatable or appetising. Lemco toast-sandwiches are nutritious, wholesome, and digestible, and always a welcome change. For ladies desiring a hasty mid-day meal, for sportsmen, travellers, and for business men who need a hurried snack in the office, Lemco sandwiches are just the thing. Mothers should let their children have Lemco toast-sandwiches for breakfast, for the evening meal, for school-luncheon. Lemco is a digestive as well as a food, and enhances enormously the nutritive value of other foods eaten with it. LEMCO, Thames House, London, E.C.

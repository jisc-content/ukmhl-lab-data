DOMESTIC COOKERY. 136 then to the pulp of the vegetables, and liquor, put a quart of fresh water, pepper, and salt, and boil all together about an hour. Have ready some suet dumplings, the size of a walnut: and before you put the soup into the tureen, put them into it. The suet must not be shred too fine; and take care that it is quite fresh. Beef and Cabbage Soup, as in Scotland. Put a rump, or brisket of beef, of ten or twelve pounds, into ten quarts of water, some carrots, turnips, whole onions, and black pepper, tied in a bit of muslin, and six good-sized cabbages in quarters. Stew slowly six hours, or until the meat be quite tender. Serve the beef in a soup-dish, with the soup and vegetables. All the vegetables are sometimes omitted except the cabbage. Scotch Leek Soup. Put the water that has boiled a leg of mutton into a stewpot, with a quantity of chopped leeks, and pepper and salt; simmer them an hour; then mix some oatmeal with a little cold water quite smooth, pour it into the soup, set it on a slow part of the fire, and let it simmer gently; but take care that it does not burn. Scotch Cockle Leekie. Stew a large fowl, a marrow-bone, and two or three pounds of beef, with two or three Scotch pints of water, and the white ends of two or three dozen of leeks, cut in pieces, until well flavoured. Just before serving, add half a pound of prunes, which, and the fowl, dish with the soup j but not the meat or marrow-bone. The latter, when put to boil, must be divided, and the marrow-bone left uncovered. Another. Put seven pounds of the upper end of a leg of beef, and an old fowl, in a pot, with water enough to cover it, the white parts of two or three dozen of leeks half boiled and sliced, and a pound of prunes. Stew till the meat he tender, skimming it well.

417 GENERAL REMARKS ON DINNERS. sweet tilings may form the second appearance without great expense. The Bills of Fare which have been given from page 404 to 415 may be modified at discretion. In some houses, one dish at a time is sent up with tlie vegetables or sauces proper to it, and this in succes- sion, hot and hot. In others, a course of Soups and Fish; then Meats and Boiled Fowls, Turkey, &c., Made Dishes and Game follow ; and lastly, Sweet Dishes : but these are not the common modes. It is worthy observation here, that common cooks do not think of sending up such articles as are in ihe house unless ordered; though, by so doing, the addition of a collared or pickled thing, some Fritters, fried Patties, or quick-made Dumplings, would be useful when there happen to be accidental visiters : and at all times it is right to better the appearance of the table rather than let things spoil below', by which the expense of a family is more increased than can be easily imagined. Vege- tables are put on the side-table at large dinners, as like- wise sauces, and servants bring them round: but some inconveniences attend this plan; and, Avhen there are not many to wait, delay is occasioned, besides that by awkwardness the clothes of the company may be spoiled. If the table is of a due size, the articles alluded to will not fill it too much. Note.â€”Any of the following things may be served as a relish, with the cheese, after dinner.

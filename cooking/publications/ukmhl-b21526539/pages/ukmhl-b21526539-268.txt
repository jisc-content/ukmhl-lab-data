186: DOMESTIC COOKERY. By the time it returns from the oven, have ready a gravy of knuckle of veal, or a bit of the scrag, with some shank-bones of mutton, seasoned with herbs, onion,, mace, and white pepper. If it is to be eaten hot, you may add truffles, morels, mushrooms, &c., but not if to be eaten cold. If it is made in a dish, put as much gravy as will fill it; but in a raised crust, the gravy must be nicely strained, and then put in cold as jelly. To make the jelly clear, you may give it a boil with the whites of two eggs, after taking away the meat, and then run it through a fine lawn sieve.

Put a good deal of butter over them, and bake them cither with or without crust; if the latter, a cover to the dish must fit close to keep in the steam. It will keep long. Gravy-jelly may be added when to be served. Staffordshire Goose Pies Are made with birds prepared and seasoned as above. A goose is to be outward, succeeded by a turkey, duck, fowd, and then lesser birds, tongue, or forcemeat. (Forcemeat may fill up the spaces between the crust and fowds, and be omitted within.) The crust should be ornamented; and the top have a flower or knob, by wdiich to lift it, as it must not be cut, but be kept to cover the pie. A smaller and less expensive pie may be made with- out the goose and turkey. Duck Pie. Bone a full-growm young-duck and a fowd : wash them, and season with pepper and salt, and a small proportion

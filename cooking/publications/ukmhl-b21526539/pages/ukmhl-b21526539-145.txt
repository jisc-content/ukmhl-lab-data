VEAL. 63 Cutlets Maintenon. Cut slices about three-quarters of au inch thick, beat them until a rolling-pin, and wet them on both sides with egg; dip them into a seasoning of bread-crumbs, pars- lej% thyme, knotted marjoram, pepper, salt, and a little nutmeg grated : then put them into papers folded over, and broil them; and have in a boat melted butter, with a little mushroom ketchup. Cutlets another ivay. Prepare as above, and fry them; lay them into a dish, and keep them hot; dredge a little flour, and put a bit of butter into the pan ; brown it, then pour a little boil- ing water into it, and boil quick; season with pepper, salt, and ketchup, and pour over them. Or prepare as before, and dress the cutlets in a Dutch oven ; pour over them melted butter and mushrooms. Or pepper, salt, and broil them, especially neck steaks. They are excellent with herbs. Veal Collops. Cut long thin collops, beat them well, and lay on them a bit of thin bacon of the same size, and spread forcemeat on that, seasoned high, and also a little, garlic and cay- enne. Roll them up tight about the size of two fingers, but no more than two or three inches long; jnit a very small skewer to fasten each firmly ; rub egg over; fiy them of a fine brown, and pour a rich brown gravy over. To dress Collops quick. Cut them as thin as paper with a very sharp knife, and in small bits. Throw the skin, and any odd bits of the veal, into a little water, with a dust of pepper and salt; set them on the fire while you beat the collops; and dip them into a seasoning of herbs, bread, pepper, salt, and a scrape of nutmeg, but first wet them in egg. Then put a bit of butter into a frying-pan, and give the collops a very quick fry; for as they are so thin, two minutes will do them on both sides : put tliem into a hot dish before the fire; then strain and thicken the gravy.

MUTTON. *75 with which haste it frequently for twenty-four hours; and without washing off the lic^uor, paper and roast as by the last receipt. Baste with butter and wine, &c., and serve with gravy prepared as before, and jelly-sauce. Shoulder of Mutton roasted. Serv'e onion sauce to eat with it; or Queen Mai-yâ€™s sauce, for which see Sauces. To steio Shoulder of Mutton ivith Oysters. Hang it some days, then salt it well for two days; bone it, and sprinkle it with pepper and a bit of mace pounded: lay some oysters over it, and roll the meat up tight and tie it. Stew it in a small quantity of water, with an onion and a few peppercorns, till quite tender. Have ready a little good gravy, and some oysters stewed in it; thicken this with flour and butter, and pour over the mutton when the tape is taken off. The stewpan should be kept close covered. Neck of Mutton Is particularly useful, as so many dishes may be made of it; but it is not advantageous for the family. The bones should be cut short, which the butchers will not do, unless particularly desired. The best end of the neck may be boiled, and served with turnips ; or roasted; or dressed in steaks, in pies, a-la-Turc, or harrico. Tlie scrag may be stewed in broth; or with a small quantity of water, some small onions, a few peppercorns, and a little rice, and served together. Or put into a pie. When a neck is to be boiled to look particularly nice, saw down the chine-bone, strip the ribs half-way down, and chop off the ends of the bones about four inches. The skin should not be taken off till boiled, and then the fat will look whiter. When there is more fat to the neck or loin of mutton than is agreeable to eat with the lean, it makes an un- commonly good suet-pudding, or crust for a meat-pie, if cut very fine.

PRESERVES. 29T PRESERVES, &C. Observations on Preserves. Preserves should be kept carefully from the air, and in a very dry ])lace. Unless they have a very small proportion of sugar, a warm one does not hurt; but when not properly boiled (that is, long enough, but not quick), heat makes them ferment; and damp causes them to grow mouldy. They should be looked at two or three times in the first two months, that they may be gently boiled again, if not likely to keep. It is necessary to observe that the boiling of sugar more or less constitutes the chief art of tbe confectioner; and those who are not practised in this knowledge, and only preserve in a plain way for family use, are not aware that in two or three minutes a syrup over the fire will pass from one gradation to another, called by the con- fectioners degrees of boiling, of which there are six, and those subdivided. But I am not versed in the minutiae, and only make the observation to guard against under- boiling, which prevents preserves from keeping; and quiek boiling, and long, which brings them to candy. Attention, without much practice, will enable a person to do any of the following sorts of preserves, &c., and they are as much as is wanted in a private family; the higlier articles of preserved fruits may be bought at less expense than made. Jellies of fruit made with equal quantity of sugar, that is, a pound to a pint, require no very long boiling. A pan should be kept for the purpose of preserving; of double bloek-tin, with a bow-handle opposite the straight one for safety, will do very well: and if ])ut by nicely cleaned in a dry place, w'hen done with, will last for several years. Those of eopper or brass are im- proper, as the tinning wears out by the scraping of the sweetmeat-ladle. Tliere is a new sort of iron with a strong tinning, whieh promises to wear long. Sieves and spoons should be kept likewise for sweet things. Preserves keep best in drawers that are not connected

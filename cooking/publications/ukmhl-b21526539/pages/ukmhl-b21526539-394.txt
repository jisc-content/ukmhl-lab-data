DOMESTIC COOKERY. 312 hearth, till the juice will run from it: then take away a quarter of a pint from even' pound of fruit: boil and bruise it half an hour, then put in the weight of the fruit in sugar, and adding the same quantity of currant-juice, boil it to a strong jelly. The raspberry-juice will serve to put into brandy, or may be boiled Mith its weight in sugar for making the jelly for raspberry-ice, or cream. To preserve Cucumbers. Choose the greenest and most perfect green turk cu- cumbers, and cut them in pieces, and some small ones of the same sort to preserve wliole. Put them in brine in a jar, with a cabbage-leaf or two over them. Then simmer them over the fire in water with a little salt in it. Take out the seeds, and put them into cold water two or three days, to soak out the salt. Make a syrup of a pound of refined sugar and a half-pint of spring- water; boil and skim it: then put in the thin rind of a lemon, and an ounce of white ginger from which the outside has been scraped. When the syrup is tolerably thick, take it off; let it grow cold, and put the cucum- bers, nicely wiped, into it. Boil them up; and repeat the boiling every three days for about a fortnight. To preserve Greengages. Choose the largest when they begin to soften; split them without paring, and stew a part of the sugar which you have previously weighed an equal quantity of. Blanch the kernels with a small sharp knife. Next day pour the syrup from the fruit, and boil it with the other sugar, six or eight minutes, very gently; skim, and add the plums and kernels. Simmer till clear, taking off any scum that rises; put the fruit singly into small pots, and pour the syrup and kernels to it. If you would candy it, do not add the syrup, but observe the directions that will be given for candying fruit: some may be done each way.

DAIRY. 359 tubs wbicb have afterwards been in cold water. Pour water on it, and let it lie to acquire some hardness before you work it; then change the water, and beat it with flat boards so perfectly, that not the least taste of the buttermilk remain, and tliat tlie water, which must be often changed shall be quite clear in colour. Then work some salt into it, weigh, and make it into forms; throw them into cold water, in an earthen pan and cover of the queenâ€™s ware. You will then have very nice and cool butter in the hottest weather. It requires more working in hot than in cold weather; but it neither should be left with a particle of buttermilk, or a sour taste, as is sometimes done. To 'preserve Butter. Take two parts of the best common salt, one part good loaf-sugar, and one part saltpetre; beat them well together. To sixteen ounces of butter thoroughly cleansed from the milk, put one ounce of this compo- sition ; work it well, and pot down when become firm and cold. The butter thus preserved is the better for keeping, and should not be used under a month. This article should be kept from the air, and is best in pots of the best glazed eartb, that will hold from ten to fourteen pounds each. To preserve Butter for Winter, the best way. When the butter has been prepared as above directed, take two parts of the best common salt, one part of yood loaf sugar, and one part of saltpetre, beaten and blended well together. Of this composition put one ounce to sixteen ounces of butter, and work it well together in a mass. Press it into the pans after the,butter is become cool; for friction, though it be not touched by the hands, will soften it. The pans should hold ten or twelve pounds each. On the top put some salt; and when that is turned to brine, if not enough to cover the butter en- tirely, add some strong salt and water. It requires only then to be covered from the dust.

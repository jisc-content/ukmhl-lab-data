PIES. m PART VI. PIES, PASTRY, PUDDINGS, FRITTERS, &c. PIES. Observations on Pies. There are few articles of cookery more generally liked than relishing pies, if properly made ; and they may be made so of a great variety of things. Some are best eaten when cold, and in that case there should be no suet put into the forcemeat that is used with them. If the pie is either made of meat that will take more dress- ing, to make it extremely tender, than the baking of the crust will allow, or if it is to be served in an earthen- pie form, observe the following preparation :â€” Take three pounds of the veiny piece of beef (for in- stance) that has fat and lean ; wash it, and season it with salt, pepper, m^ce, and allspice, in fine powder, rubbing them well in. Set it by the side of a slow fire, in a stewpot that will just hold it; put to it a piece of butter of about the weight of two ounces, and cover it quite close; let it just simmer in its own steam till it begins to shrink. When it is cold, add more seasoning, ' forcemeat, and eggs : and if it is in a dish, put some gravy to it before taking; but if it is only in crust, do not put the gravy till after it is cold and in jelly, as has been described in pages 147 and 148. Forcemeat may ^ be put both under and over the meat, if preferred to balls. Heating the oven properly is very material in baking. : Light paste requires it to be moderately hot; if too i ! quick, it will be burned and not rise well; if too slow, i 1 it will be soddened, not rise, and want colour.

If turned only two hours before wanted, it is very light; but those who like it harder may have it so, by making it earlier, and squeezing it. Cream, milk, or a wliip of cream, sugar, wine, and lemon, to be put in the dish, or into a glass bowl, to serve with the curd. Another xoay. To four quarts of new milk warmed, put from a pint to a quart of buttermilk strained, according to its sour- ness ; keep the pan covered until the curd be of firmness to cut three or four times across with a saucer, as the whey leaves it; put it into a shape, and fill up until it be solid enough to take the form. Serve with cream plain, or mixed with sugar, wine, and lemon. A Curd Star. Set a quart of new milk upon the fire with two or three blades of mace; and when ready to boil, put to it the yolks and whites of nine eggs well beaten, and as much salt as will lie upon a small knifeâ€™s point. Let it boil till the whey is clear; then drain it in a thin cloth, or hair-sieve; season it with sugar, and a little cinnamon, rose-water, orange-flower water, or white wine, to your taste; and put into a star form or any other. Let it stand some hours before you turn it into a dish; then put round it thick cream or custard. Blanc-mange, or Blamange. Boil two ounces of isinglass in three half-pints of water half an hour; strain it to a pint and a half of cream, sweeten it, and add some peach-w'ater, or a few bitter almonds; let it boil once up, and put it into what forms you please. If not to be very stiff, a little less isinglass will do. Observe to let the blamange settle before you turn it into the forms, or the blacks will remain at tlie bottom of them, and be on the top of tlie blamange when taken out of the moulds.

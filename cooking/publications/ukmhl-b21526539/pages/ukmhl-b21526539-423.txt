Over half a bushel of pale ground malt pour as much hot (not boiling) water as will just cover it. In forty- eight hours, drain olf the liquor entirely, but without squeezing the grains; put the former into a large sweet- taeat pan, or saucepan, that there may he room to boil as quick as possible, without boiling over; w'hen it be- gins to thicken, stir constantly. It must be as thick as treacle. A dessert-spoonful thrice a day. To preserve Yest. When you have plenty of yest, begin to save it in the following manner : whisk it until it becomes thin, then take a new large wooden dish, w'ash it very nicely, and when quite dry lay a layer of yest over the inside with a soft brush; let it dry, then put another layer in the same manner, and so do until you have a sufficient quantity, observing that each coat dry thoroughly before another be added. It may be put on tw’o or three inches thick, and will keep several months ; when to be used, cut a piece out; stir it in warm water. If to be used for brewing, keep it by dipping large handsful of birch tied together; and when dry repeat the dipping once. You may thus do as many as you please; but take care that no dust comes to them, or the vessel in which it has been prepared. When the W'ort is set to wmrk, throw into it one of these bunches, and it will do as well as with fresh yest; but if mixed with a small quantity first, and then added to the whole, it will work sooner.

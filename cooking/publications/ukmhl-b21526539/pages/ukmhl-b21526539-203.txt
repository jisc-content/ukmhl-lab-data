GAME. 121 To-pot Woodcocks. Pluck and draw six woodcocks, skew'cr their bills through their thighs, put their legs through each other, and their feet on their breasts. Season with pepper, salt, and mace. Put them into a deep pot, with a pound of butter on them. Bake them in a moderate oven, and I not too much. Draw the gravy from them, then put t them into potting-pots. Take all the clear butter from ! the gravy, and put it upon them. Fill up the pots with I clarified butter. Keep them in a dry place. Snipes I may be done in the same manner. 1 Ruffs and Rees Are skewered as quails; put bars of bacon over them, and roast them about ten minutes. Serve with a good gravy in the dish. To dress Plovers. Roast the green ones in the same way as woodcocks and quails (see above), without drawing; and serve on a toast. Gray plovers may be either roasted or stewed with gravy, herbs, and spice. Plovers^ Eggs Are a nice and fashionable dish. Boil them ten minutes, and serve either hot or cold : the former on a napkin j the latter on moss. To roast Ortolans. Pick and singe, but do not draw them. Tie on a bird- spit and roast them. Some persons like bacon in slices tied between them, but the taste of it spoils the flavour of the ortolan. Cover them with crumbs of bread. Melted butter, with a little grated nutmeg, for sauce. Guinea and Pea Fowl Taste much like pheasant, if jjroperly hung; dress and serve the same way. Their eggs are delicate, and must boil one minute and a half.

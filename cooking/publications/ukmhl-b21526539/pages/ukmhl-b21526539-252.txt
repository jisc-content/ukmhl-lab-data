DOMESTIC COOKERY. 170 not enough; strain through a cloth, then season with every savoury spice; and if for brown sauce, add port, anchovies and garlicâ€”if for white, omit these, and put a glass of sherry, lemon-juice and peel, mace, nutmeg, and white pepper. If for brown, burn a bit of sugar for colouring. This is excellent in made dishes, or for fish sauce. Lemon Ketchup, or Pickle. Cut three large juicy lemons across the top, and stuff salt into them ; set them upright in a dish before the fire, and turn them every day. When they become drj', roast tliem in a Dutch oven until they are brown. Boil a quart of vinegar, with a quarter of a pound of ancho- vies, without the bones and scales (but do not w^ash them,) four blades of mace, half a nutmeg sliced, and a spoonful of white pepper ; boil gently ten minutes; then pour it, boiling-hot, on the lemons, in a stone jar, and cover close. Let it stand six weeks, then put it into quarter-pint flat bottles. It is excellent for made dishes, and the lemon eats w'ell. PICKLES. Rules to be observed with Pickles. Avoid as mucli as possible the use of metal vessels in preparing them. Acids dissolve tlie lead that is in the tinning of saucepans, and corrode copper and brass; consequently, if kept in such, for any length of time, they become highly poisonous. When it is necessary to hoil vinegar, do it in a stone jar on a stove. Glazed jars should never be used for pickles, as salt and vinegar dis- solve the lead which is in the glaze. Pickles should be kept from the air ; exposure to it makes them soft. A wooden spoon, with holes in it, should be tied to each jar. Small jars should be occa- sionally replenished from the large ones, to prevent the frequent opening of the latter. For greening pickles, see Young Cucumbers.

113 POULTRY. Slice two or three onions, and fry them in butter, of a light brown; then add the meat, and fry altogether till the meat begins to brown. Put it all into a stewpan, and pour boiling water enough just to cover it. Simmer very gently two or three hours. If too thick, put more w'ater half an hour before serving. If the meat has been dressed before, a little broth will be better than water; but the currie is richer when made of fresh meat. To braise Chickens. Bone, and fill them with forcemeat. Lay the bones, and any other poultry trimmings, into a stewpan, and the chickens on them. Put to them a few onions, a faggot of herbs, three blades of mace, a pint of stock, and a glass or two of sherry. Cover the chickens with slices of bacon, and then white paper; cover the whole close, and put them on a slow stove for two hours. Then take them up, strain the braise, and skim off the fat carefully; set it on to boil very quick to a glaze, and do the chickens over it with a brush. Serve with a brown fricassee of mushrooms. Before glazing, put the chicken into an oven for a few minutes, to give a little colour. Ducks roasted. Stuff one with sage and onion, a dessert-spoonful of crumbs, a bit of butter, and pepper and salt; let the other be unseasoned. They should be done to a turn, and go up finely frothed, with a rich gravy in the dish. To boil Ducks. Choose a fine fat duck ; salt it two days, then boil it slowly in a cloth. Serve it with onion sauce, but melt the butter with milk instead of water. To stew Ducks. Half roast a duck ; put it into a stewpan with a pint of beef-gravy, a few leaves of sage and mint cut small, pepper and salt, and a small bit of onion shred as fine 1

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 132 pint and a half of young peas, and a little parsley. Put these, with half a pound of fresh butter, into a saucepan, to stew in their own liquor, near a gentle fire, half an hour; then pour two quarts of boiling water to the vege- tables, and stew them two hours; rub down a little flour into a tea-cupful of water, boil it with the rest fifteen or twenty minutes, and serve it. Very small suet dumplings, boiled in water, and added to this and the following soups, in the tureen, are an improvement. Another umy. Peel and slice six large onions, six potatoes, six car- rots, and four turnips; fry them in half a pound of butter, and pour on them four quarts of boiling water. Toast a crust of bread as brown and hard as possible, but do not burn it; put that, some celer}', sweet herbs, white pepper, and salt, to the above; stew it all gently four hours, then strain it through a coarse cloth: have ready sliced carrot, celery, and a little turnip, and add to your liking; and stew them tender in the soup. If approved, you may add an anchov}', and a spoonful of ketchup. Herb Soup. Clean and cut small six Silesia or cabbage lettuces, a large handful of spinach, purslain, white beet-leaves, a few young onions, and a little parsley. Take the seeds out of three large cucumbers, cut the cucumbers in slices, and, with half a pint of spinach-juice, add to the above. Put the vegetables into a stewpan, witli half a pound of butter; stir round till the latter melts ; cover close, and set the ])an over a very gentle fire for two hours.

Let the soup simmer an hour: put in some asparagus tops, boiled and cut in bits; and if it be not of a prOi{)er consistence, or there appear any fat on the top, mix a tea-spoonful of flour with half a cup of cold water, and add it half an hour before serving.

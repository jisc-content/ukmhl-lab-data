DOMESTIC COOKERY. 140 Soup maigre. Melt half a pound of butter in a stewpan, shake it round, and throw in six middling onions sliced. Shake the pan well for two or three minutes; then put to it five heads of celery, two handsful of spinach, two cab- bage-lettuces cut small, and some parsley. Shake the pan well for ten minutes; then put in two quarts of water, some crusts of bread, a tea-spoonful of beaten pepper, three or four blades of mace; and if you have any white beet-leaves, add a large handful of them cut small. Boil gently an hour. Just before serving, beat in two yolks of eggs, and a large spoonful of vinegar. Another. Flour and fry a quart of green peas, four onions sliced, the coarse stalks of celery, a carrot, a turnip, and a parsnip; then pour on them three quarts of water. Let it simmer till the whole will pulp through a sieve. Then boil in it the best of the celery cut thin, and a piece of butter rubbed in flour. To stew Beefâ€™s Cheek. Clean and soak well half an ox-head, and a large heel take the meat from the bones, and put it into a coarse pan with three onions shced, and fried brown, without becoming burnt, in butter and flour, a bunch of sweet herbs; of allspice, pepper, and salt, a large spoonful each. Lay the bones close on the meat, and pour on three quarts of water. Cover the pan with a coarse brown paper, tie closely, and let it stand in the oven ten hours; or put it by the side of the fire, in a covered pot. When done, take off the bones, and pour the soup and meat into a pan: when to be used, take off the fat, and having warmed the soup, cut little bits of the meat to come up or not, as may be chosen. A little celery, carrot, and turnip may be boiled in a basin of it in a very short time, if minced small; and the flavour will be improved.

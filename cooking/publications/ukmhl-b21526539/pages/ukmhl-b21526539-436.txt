DOMESTIC COOKERY. 354 making must be a principal cause of the difference in flavour; besides, there is much in the size and manner of keeping. Cheese made on the same ground, of new, skimmed, or mixed milk, will differ greatly, not in richness onl}', but also in taste. Those who direct a dairy in a gentle- manâ€™s family should consider in which way it can be managed to the best advantage. Even with few cows, cheese of value may be made from a tolerable pasture, by taking the whole of two meals of milk, and propor- tioning the thickness of the vat to the quantity, rather than having a wide and flat one, as the former will be most mellow. The addition of a pound of fresh-made butter, of a good quality, will cause the cheese made on poor land to be of a very different quality from that usually produced by it. A few cheeses thus made, when the weather is not extremely hot, and when the cows are in full feed, will be very advantageous for the use of the parlour. Cheese for common family use will be very well produced by two meals of skim, and one of new milk ; or, in good land, by the skim-milk only. Butter likewise should be made, and potted down for winter-use, but not to interfere with the cheese, as above, which will not take much time. To jjrepare Rennet to turn the Milk.

Let it drain a few hours; then sew it up with two good handsful of salt in it, or stretch it on a stick well salted; or keep it in the salt wet, and soak a bit, which will do over and over by fresh water.

101 POULTRY, GAME, &C. carrots, and trimmings, or fi'esh meat bones you have, and a pint and a half of water, or the same quantity of stock, which you will find directed under the head of Soups and Gravies. Over the meat lay a sheet of rvhite paper: according to what the meat is, add seasoning. Cover the pan close, and set it over a slow stove ; it will require two or three hours, as its size and quality may direct. Then put the meat and gravy into a colander to drain, and keep it quite hot; skim the gravy carefully, and boil it as quick as you can, till it thickens; then, M'ith a brush kept for the purpose, do over the meat, and if that has been lardered, put it into the oven for a few minuteSi This is called glazing, and is much in use for made-dishes. The glaze should be a clear yellow broMm; a glass of sherry may be put to it before it is set to thicken over the fire. (See To braise Chickens, p. 113.) To glaze, icithout braising. Fowls or meat may be dressed in any way chosen, without bacon, and a gravy, boiled to a glaze, brushed over, as above. Hams, tongues, and stewed beef, to eat cold, are thus done. Whether by giving the appearance of French cookery to our good old English dishes any advantage be gained in look or flavour, every one must judge for himself; but ham and tongue, in the opinion of many, are best when served as formerly. To force Fowls, ^c.. Is to stuff any part with forcemeat, and is usually put between the skin and the flesh. To lard Meat, Fowls, Sweetbreads, §»c. Have ready larding pins of different sizes, and accord- ing to the article to be done, cut slices of bacon into bits of a proper length, quite smooth, and put into a larding pin to suit it, with which pierce the skin and a very little of the meat, leaving the bacon in, and the two ends of equal length outwards. Lard in rows, the size vou think fit.

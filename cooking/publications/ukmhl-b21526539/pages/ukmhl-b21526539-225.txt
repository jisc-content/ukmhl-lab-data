GRAVIES. 143 and some flour and flutter; and season as may fle liked, if not fligh enough. Oyster Soup. Take two quarts of fish stock, as directed in page 141 : heat the yolks of ten hard eggs, and the hard part of two quarts of oysters, in a mortar, and add this to the stock. Simmer it all for half an hour; then strain it olf, and put it and the oysters (cleared of the beards, and nicely washed) into the soup. Simmer five minutes: have ready the yolks of six raw eggs well beaten, and add them to the soup. Stir it all well one way, on the side of the fire, till it is thick and smooth, but do not let it boil. Serve with a roll moistened in the soup. Another Oyster Soup, as made at Oystermouth, in South Wales. Make a rich mutton broth, with two large onions, three blades of mace, and black pepper. When strained, pour it on a hundred and fifty oysters, without the beards, and a bit of butter rolled in flour. Simmer gently a quarter of an hour, and serve with a roll. GRAVIES. Observations on Gravies, in addition to those given in common with Soups. As gravy meat is an article of considerable expense in many families where a large table is not kept, every hint which may tend to diminish superfluities, without de- creasing the flavour of the dishes, must be acceptable to a good economist. Gravy may be made quite as good of the skirts of beef, kidney, or milt, or of the liver of a fat ox, as of any other kind of meat, if cut in pieces, fried with onions, and seasoned with herbs and spices, as other gravies. Gravy may also be made of the knuckle of dressed mut- ton, if much be not required. The bones and pieces of meat cut off to make joints appear well, called trimmings, as likewise those of fowls.

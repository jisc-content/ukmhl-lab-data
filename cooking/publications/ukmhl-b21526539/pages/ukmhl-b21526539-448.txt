DOMESTIC COOKERY. 366 water, till they have a little strength to bear it, which in very cold weather they cannot do so well. They should be put under cover, especially in a wet season ; for though water is the natural element of ducks, yet they are apt to be killed by the cramp before they are covered with feathers to defend them. Ducks should be accustomed to feed and rest at one place, which would prevent their straggling too far to lay. Places near the water to lay in are advantageous ; and these might be small wooden houses, with a parti- tion, in the middle, and a door at each end. They eat any thing; and when to be fattened, must have plenty, however coarse, and in three weeks they will be fat. Geese Require little expense, as they chiefly support them- selves on commons or in lanes, where they can get water. The largest are esteemed best, as also are the white and gray. The pied and dark-coloured are not so good. Thirty days are generally the time the goose sits, hut in warm weather she will sometimes hatch sooner. Give them plenty of food, such as scalded bran and light oats; and as soon as the goslings are hatched, keep them housed for eight or ten days, and feed them with barley- meal, bran, curds, &c. For green geese, begin to fatten them at six or seven weeks old, and feed them as above. Stubble geese require no fattening if they have the run of good tields. Turkeys Are very tender when young. As soon as hatched, put three peppercorns down their throats. Great care is necessary to their well-being, because the hen is so careless, that she Avill walk about with one chick, and leave the remainder, or even tread upon and kill them. Turkeys are violent eaters; and must therefore be left to take charge of themselves in general, except one good feed a day. The hen sits twenty-five or thirty days; and the young ones must be kept warm, as the

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 86 Mix, finely pounded, four ounces of saltpetre, a pound of coarse sugar, and two ounces of sal-prunella. The pork having been well sprinkled with common salt, and left to drain twenty-four hours, wipe it quite drv, then rub in the above salts, mixed with four pounds of large salt, laying the pieces into the pan or tub. In two days rub each piece well with the pickle, and pack as closely as possible. Place large pebbles on the pork to prevent it from swimming in the liquor which the salt will produce. If kept from the air, it will continue good a whole year.

Salt it eight or ten days, turning it daily, but do not rub it after the first. When to be dressed weigh it: let it lie half an hour in cold water to make it white : allow a quarter of an hour for every pound, and half an hour over from the time it boils up : skim it as soon as it boils, and frequently after; but do not boil it fast, or it will be hard. Allow water enough. Save some of it to make peas-soup. Some boil it in a very nice cloth, floured; which gives a very delicate look. Serve peas- pudding and turnips with it.

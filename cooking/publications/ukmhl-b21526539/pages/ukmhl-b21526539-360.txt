DOMESTIC COOKERY. 218 Another. Mix half a quarter of a pint of ratafia, the same quan- tity of mountain wine, the juice of three lemons, a pint of rich cream, and three ounces of fine sugar. Beat with a whisk, and put it into glasses. Clouted Cream. String four blades of mace on a thread ; put them to a gill of new milk, and six spoonsful of rose-water; sim- mer a few minutes: then by degrees stir this liquor strained into the yolks of two new eggs well beaten. Stir the whole into a quart oi very good cream, and set it over the fire ; stir it till hot, but not boiling-hot; pour â€™ it into a deep dish, and let it stand twenty-four hours. Serve it in a cream dish, to eat with fruits. Many people prefer it without any flavour but that of cream ; in which case use a quart of new milk and the cream, or do it as the Devonshire scalded cream. When done enough, a round mark will appear on the surface of the cream, the size of the. bottom of the pan it is done in, which in the country they call the ring; and when that is seen, remove the pan from the fire. Oryiamented Custard as used in France. Put a rich custard into a shallow dish: ^yhen it shall have become cold, lay on it, in any shape you please, the beaten whites of two new-laid eggs in a firm froth, and over that sift refined sugar. Put it into an oven to be- come a fine lisjht brown. A Froth to set on Cream, Custard, or Trifle, which looh^ and eats well. Sweeten half a pound of the pulp of damsons or any other sort of scalded fruit, put to it the whites of four eggs beaten, and beat the pulp with them until it will stand as high as you choose ; and being put on the cream, &c., with a spoon, it will take any form: it should be rough, to imitate a rock.

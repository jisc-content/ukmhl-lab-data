374 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chicken Panada. Boil a chicken till about three parts readj^, in a quart of water; take off the skin, cut the white meat off when cold, and put into a marble mortar; pound it to a paste with a little of the water it was boiled in, season with a little salt, a grate of nutmeg, and the least bit of lemon- peel. Boil gently for a few minutes to the consistency you like: it should be such as you can drink, though tolerably thick. This conveys great nourishment in small compass. Sippets, lohen the stomach loill not receive meat. On an extremely hot plate put two or three sippets of bread, and pour over them some gravy from beef, mutton, or veal, with which no butter has been mixed. Sprinkle a little salt over. Eggs. An egg broken into a cup of tea, or beaten and mixed with a basin of milk, makes a breakfast more supporting than tea solely. An egg divided, and the yolk and wdiite beaten sepa- rately, then 'mixed with a glass of wnne, will afford two very wholesome draughts, and prove lighter than when taken together. Eggs very little, boiled, or poached, taken in small quantity, convey much nourishment; the yolk only, when dressed, should be eaten by invalids. A great Restorative. Bake two calf’s feet in two pints of w'ater, and the same quantity of new milk, in a jar close-covered, three hours and a half. When cold, remove the fat. Give a large tea-cupful the first and last thing. What- ever flavour is approved, give it by baking in it lemon- peel, cinnamon, or mace. Add sugar after. Another. Simmer six sheep’s trottei's, two blades of mace, a little cinnamon, lemon-peel, a few' hartshorn-shavings.

Ill POULTRY. a few sweet herbs chopped, two ounces of heef-suet, a tea-spoonful of lemon-peel minced quite fine, an anchovy, salt, pepper, and a very little cayenne. Beat all in a mortar, with a tea-cupful of crumbs, and the yolks and whites of three eggs. Stuflf the inside of the fowl, and draw the legs and wings inward; tie the neck and rump close. Stew the fowl in a white gravy; when it is done through, and tender, add a large cupful of cream, and a hit of butter and flour; give it one boil, and serve ; the last thing, add the squeeze of a lemon. Rather more than half boil, in a small quantity of water : let them cool; then cut up; and put to simmer in a little gravy made of the liquor they are boiled in, and a hit of veal or mutton, onion, mace, and lemon- peel, some w'hite pepper, and a hunch of sweet herbs. When quite tender, keep them hot while you thicken the sauce in the following manner; strain it off, and put it back into the saucepan with a little salt, a scrape of nutmeg, and a bit of flour and butter; give it one boil; and when you are going to serve, heat up the yolk of an egg, add half a pint of cream, and stir them over the fire, but do not let it boil. It will be quite as good with- out the egg. The gravy may be made (without any other meat) of the necks, feet, small wing-bones, gizzards, and livers; which are called the trimmings of the fowds. A beautiful and excellent way of dressing Fowls. Wlien nicely clean, and free from every feather and plug, singe them. Bone, and draw inwards the leg and pinion of the wing. Stuff Avith sausage-meat, and tie the neck and vent. Roast, and serve with gravy in the dish, and bread-sauce in a tureen. If the fowls are young, and properly kept, they are equal to turkey. If the quantity of forcemeat he thought too much, one fowl may he put within the other. Fricassee of Chickens.

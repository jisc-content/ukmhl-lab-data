DOMESTIC COOKERY. 34 or to clarify. If there be more suet than ■will be used ■while fresh, throw it into pickle, made in the ]>roportion of a quarter of a pound of salt to a quart of cold water, and it will he as good afterwards for any use, when soaked a little. Dripping, or clarified suet, will baste every thing as well as butter, except fowls and game; and for kitchen pies nothing else should be used. The fat of a neck or loin of mutton makes a far lighter and much richer pud- ding than suet. If the weather permit, meat eats much better for hanging a day before it is salted. Meats become more tender, and consequently more digestible, as well as better flavoured, by hanging ; but veal and lamb will not bear it so long as the flesh of older animals. All meats should he well washed, and cleaned with a brush kept for the purpose, before they are dressed. If for boiling, the colour wiU be better for soaking an hour or two; but if to be roasted, let it be dried, after washing. Boiling in a well-floured cloth will make meat white. Cloths for this jiurpose should be carefully washed, and boiled in clean water between each using, and not suf- fered to hang in a damp place, which would give a bad flavour to the meat. The same observe of tapes and pudding-cloths. All kitchen utensils should be kept in the nicest order, and in a conspicuous part of the oftices. Particular care must be taken that the pot is well skimmed the moment it boils, otherwise the foulness will be dispersed over the meat. The more soups or broth are skimmed, the better and cleaner they will be. Meats boiled quick will be hard. Vegetables should never be dressed with meat, except carrots or parsneps with boiled beef. The length of time for roasting and boiling must be determined by the size and solidity of the joint, the strength of the fire, and its nearness to it in roasting : in boiling, by the regular though slow progress it makes.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 348 Ratafia. Blanch two ounces of peach and apricot kernels, bruise and put them into a bottle, and fill nearly up with brandy. Dissolve half a pound of white sugar- candy in a cup of cold water, and add to the brandy after it has stood a month on the kernels, and they are strained off; then filter through paper, and bottle for nse.

Then squeeze the lemon-juice upon the sugar; and with a bruiser press the sugar and the juice particu- larly well together, for a great deal of the richness and fine flavour of the punch depends on this rubbing and mixing process being thoroughly performed. Then mix this up verij well with boiling water, (soft water is best,) till the whole is rather cool. When this mixture (which is now called the sherbet) is to your taste, take brandy and rum in equal quantities, and put them to it, mixing the whole xcell together again. The quantity of liquor must be according to your taste : two good

145 GRAVIES. Clear Gravy. Slice beef thin; broil a part of it over a very clear quick fire, just enough to give colour to the gravy, but not to dress it; put that and the raw into a very nicely tinned stewpan, with two onions, a clove or two, whole black pepper, berries of allspice, and a bunch of sweet herbs; cover it with hot water, give it one boil, and skim it well two or three times: then cover it, and sim- mer till quite strong.

Add an equal quantity of good veal or mutton broth, and cream. Let it boil gently one hour, stirring it all the time; strain it through a soup- strainer. A Gravy without Meat. Put a glass of small beer, a glass of water, some pep- per, salt, lemon-peel grated, a bruised clove or two, and a spoonful of walnut-pickle or mushroom-ketchup into a basin.

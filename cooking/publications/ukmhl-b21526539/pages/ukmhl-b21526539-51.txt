xliii MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. holes. Fenders, and tin linings of llower-pots, &c., should he painted every year or two. Vegetables soon sour, and corrode metals and glazed red ware, by which a strong poison is produced. Some years ago, the death of several gentlemen was occa- sioned at Salt-hill, by the cook sending a ragout to the table which she had kept from the preceding day in a copper vessel badly tinned. Vinegar, by its acidity, does the same, the glazing being of lead or arsenic. To cool liquors in hot weather, dip a cloth in cold water, and wrap it round the bottle two or three times, then place it in the sun; renew the process once or twice. The best way of scalding fruits, or boiling vinegar, is in a stone jar, or on a hot iron hearth; or by putting the vessel into a saucepan of water, called a w'ater-bath. If chocolate, coffee, jelly, gruel, bark, &c., be suffered to boil over the strength is lost. The cook should be encouraged to be carefiil of coals and cinders: for the latter there is a new contrivance to sift, without dispersing the dust of the ashes, by means of a covered tin bucket. Small coal wetted makes the strongest fire for the back, but must remain untouched until it cake. Cinders lightly wet give a gi'cat degree of heat, and are better than coal for furnaces, ironing-stoves, and ovens. The cook should be charged to take care of jelly-bags, tapes for the collared things, &c., which, if not perfectly scalded and kept dry, give an unpleasant flavour when next used.

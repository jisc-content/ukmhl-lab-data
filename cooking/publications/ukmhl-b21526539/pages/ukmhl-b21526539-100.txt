DOMESTIC COOKERY. 20 blades of mace, two large nutmegs, a quarter of an ounce of pepper, and an ounce of common salt. As you season each, lay it in an earthen pan as nearly fitted to hold the herrings as possible. Lay over them a pound of butter, cover with a white and several brown papers; tie down close, and bake three hours in a moderately- quick oven. When a little cooled, drain the liquor from the fish, and lay them round a pottiug-pot or char-pan, the backs upwards, as close as they will lie without breaking, and finish packing them in the centre. Take the bowl of a large spoon, and smooth the sirrface, that there may not be cavities to absorb the butter, which must not be put on till the following day; then let it be half an inch thick. The gravy makes the finest addition to soups, or made dishes, in small proportions. The head should lie over the fish when baked. Her- rings thus dressed, and served in the hot gravy, make a dish of the finest flavour imaginable. Herrings are very good jrotted like mackerel. See p. 16. To dress Red Herrings. Choose them that are large and moist, cut them open, 'and pour some boiling small beer over them to soak half an hour ; drain them dry, and make them just hot through before the fire, then rub some cold butter over them, and serve. Egg-sauce, or buttered eggs, and mashed potatoes should be sent rq:> with them. Instead of butter, a little sweet oil will add to the richness, but it must be dropped on while before the fire, and in the smallest quantity. Baked Herrings and Sprats. Wash and drain without wiping them; season with allspice in fine powder, salt, and a few whole cloves; lay them in a pan with plenty of black pepper, an onion, and a few bay-leaves. Add half vinegar and half small beer enough to cover them. Put paper over the pan, and bake in a slow oven. If you like, throw saltpetre over them the night before, to make them look red. Gut, but do not open them.

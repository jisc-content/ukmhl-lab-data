43 BEEF. Garnish with carrots, turnips, or truffles and morels, or pickles of different colours, cut small and laid in little heaps separate; chopped parsley, chives, beet-root, &c. If, when done, the gravy is too much to fill the dish, take only a part to season for serving, hut the less water the better; and to increase the richness, add a few beef bones and shanks of mutton in stewing. A spoonful or tn^o of made mustard is a great im- provement of the gravy. Steived Rump another loay. Half roast it; then put it into a large pot with three pints of water, one of small heer, one of port wine, some salt, three or four spoonsful of vinegar, two of ketchup, a bunch of sweet herbs of various kinds, (such as burnet, tarragon, parsley, thyme, basil, savory, pennyroyal, marjoram, knotted marjoram, and a leaf or two of sage,) some onions, cloves, and cayenne : cover it close, and simmer till quite tender : two or three hours will do it. When done, lay it into a deep dish, set it over hot water, and cover it close. Skim the gravy; put in a few pickled mushrooms, truffles, morels, and oysters, if i agreeable, (the truffles and morels having been pre- ! viously boiled in some of the liquor,) but it is very good I without; thicken the gravy with flour and butter, and I heat it with the above, and pour over the beef. Force- I meat balls of veal, anchovies, bacon, suet, herbs, spice, 3 bread, and eggs, to bind, are a great improvement. Rump of Beef roasted. If of a well-fed ox, and hung till tender, this is one of the most juicy and best flavoured of all the joints of beef. It is generally sold in the country undivided from the edgebone : or cut across, and not lengthways as in London, which makes it too large for one dressing, and neither fit for boiling nor roasting. Beef Rump en Matelotte. Cut a beef rump in pieces, which parboil, and then stew in broth without seasoning; when about half done.

103 POULTllY, GAME, &C. PART III. POULTRY, GAME, &c. To choose Poultry^ Game, ^c. A Turkey Cock.-—If young, it has a smooth black leg, ■with a short spur. If fresh, the eyes full and bright, and the feet supple and moist. If stale, the eyes ■will be sunk, and the feet dry. Hen-Turkey is known by the same rules; but if old, her legs will be red and rough. Fowls.—If a cock is young, his spurs will be short; but take care to see they have not been cut or pared, which is a trick often practised. His comb should be a bright red. If fresh, the vent vAll be close and dark. Pullets are best just before they begin to lay, and yet are full of egg : if old hens, their combs and legs will be rough; if young, they will be smooth. A good capon has a thick belly and a large rump : there is a particular fat at his breast, and the comb is very pale. Black- legged fowls are most juicy, therefore to be preferred for roasting Geese.—The. bill and feet of a young one will be yel- low, and there will be but few hairs upon them; if old, they will be red: if fresh, the feet will be pliable; if stale, dry and stiff. Those that are thick in the breast, moderately fat, and the fat a good colour, are the best. Geese are called green till three or four months old. Green geese should be scalded; a stubble goose should be picked dry. Ducks.—Choose them by the same rules, of having supple feet, and by their being hard and thick on the breast and belly. The feet of a tame duck are thick.

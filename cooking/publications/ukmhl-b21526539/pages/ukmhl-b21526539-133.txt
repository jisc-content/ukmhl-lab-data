BEEF. 51 To dress the same, called Sanders. Mince beef or mutton small, with onion, pepj^er, and salt; add a little grav)", put it into scallop-shells or sau- cers, making them three parts full, and fill them up with potatoes ; mash with a little cream, put a bit of butter on the top, and brown them in an oven, or before the fire, or with a salamander. To dress the same, called Cecils. Mince any kind of meat, crumbs of bread, a good deal of onion, some anchovies, lemon-peel, salt, nutmeg, chop- ped parsley, pepper, and a bit of butter warm, and mix them over a fire for a few minutes; when cool enough, make them up into balls of the size and shape of a tur- keyâ€™s egg, with an egg; sprinkle them with fine crumbs, and then fry them of a yellow brown; and serve with gravy as before directed for Beef Olives. To mince Beef. Shred the underdone part fine, with some of the fat; put it into a small stewpan, with some onion or shalot, (a very little will do,) a little water, pepper, and salt; boil it till the onion is quite soft: then put some, of the gravy of the meat to it, and the mince. A few minutes will dress it, but do not let it boil. Have a small hot dish Avith sippets of bread ready, and pour the mince into it, but first mix a large spoonful of vinegar with it. If shalot vinegar is used, there will be no need of the onion nor the raAv shalot. To hash Beef. Uo it the same as in the last receipt, only the meat is to be in slices, and you may add a spoonful of Avalnut liquor or ketchup. Observe, that it is owing to boiling hashes or minces that they get hard. All sorts of stews, or meat dressed a second time, should be only simmered; and this last only hot through.

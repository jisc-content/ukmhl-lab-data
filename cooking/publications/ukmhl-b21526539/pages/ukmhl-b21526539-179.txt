Keep it four weeks, turning it every day. Drain it, and throw bran over it; then hang it in a chimney where wood is burnt, and turn it sometimes for ten days. Another way. Hang the ham, and sprinkle it with salt as above; then rub it eveiy day with the following, in fine powder : half a pound of common salt, the same quantity of bay- salt, two ounces of saltpetre, and two ounces of black pepper, mixed with a pound and a half of treacle.

Cover it with bran when wiped ; and smoke it from three to four weeks, as you a])prove : the latter will make it harder, and give it more of the flavour of Westphalia.

Sprinkle the ham with salt, after it has hung two or three days; let it drain; make a pickle of a quart of strong beer, half a pound of treacle, an ounce of co- riander-seeds, two ounces of juniper-berries, an ounce of pepper, the same quantity of allspice, an ounce of salt- petre, half an ounce of sal-prunel, a handful of common II

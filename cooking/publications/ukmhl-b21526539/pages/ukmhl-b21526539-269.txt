PIES. 187 of mace and allspice in the finest powder. Put the fowl within the duck, and in the former a calfâ€™s tongue, pickled red, boiled very tender and peeled. Press the whole close; the skins of the legs should he drawn in- wards, that the body of the fowls may be quite smooth. If approved, the space between the sides of the crust may he filled with a fine forcemeat, made according to the second receipt given for making forcemeat in page 164. Bake it in a slow oven, either in a raised crust, or pie- dish, with a thick crust ornamented. The cook should begin to bone any bird by first taking out the breast-bone; when she will have sufficient space to remove the liack with a sharp small knife, and then the leg-bones. The skin must be preserved whole; and the meat of the leg be pushed inwards. Giblet Pie. After very nicely cleaning goose or duck giblets, stew them with a small quantity of water, onion, black pepper, and a bunch of sweet herbs, till nearly done. Let them grow cold; and if not enough to fill the dish, lay a beef, veal, or two or three mutton steaks, at bottom. Put the liquor of the stew to bake with the above; and when the pie is baked, pour into it a large tea-cupful of cream. Sliced potatoes added to it eat extremely well. Rabbit Pie. Cut two rabbits, and a pound of fat and lean pork that has lain a week or two in pickle, into small bits; lay them, when seasoned with pepper and salt, into a dish. Parboil the livers, and beat them in a mortar, with their weight of fat bacon and bearded oysters, some pepper, salt, mace, and sweet herbs, chopped fine. Make this into small balls, and distribute in the dish with some arti- choke bottoms cut in dice. Grate half a small nutmeg over, and add half a pint of port, and the same of water. Cover with a tolerably thick crust; and bake it an hour, in a quick, hut not violently heated, oven.

Twelve bushels of malt to the hogshead for beer (or fourteen if you wish it of a very good body), eight for ale; for either, pour the whole quantity of water hot, but not boiling, on at once, and let it infuse three hours close covered ; mash it in the first half hour, and let it stand the remainder of the time. Run it on the hops previously infused in water; for strong beer, three- quarters of a pound to a bushel; if for ale, half a pound. Boil them with the wort two hours from the time at begins to boil. Cool a pailful to add two quarts of yest to, which will prepare it for putting to the rest when ready next day; but if possible put together the same night. Tun as usual. Cover the bunghole with paper when the beer has done working ; and when it is to be stopped, have ready a pound and a half of hops dried before the fire, put them into the bunghole, and fasten it up. Let it stand twelve months in casks, and twelve in bottles, before it be drunk. It will keep, and be very fine, eight or ten years. It should be brewed the begin- ning of March. Great care must be taken that the bottles are perfectly prepared, and that the corks are of the best sort. The ale will be ready in three or four months ; and, if the vent-peg be never removed, it will have spirit and strength to the very last. Allow two gallons of w'ater at first for waste. After the beer or ale is run from the grains, pour a hogshead and a half for the twelve bushels, and a hogs- head of water if eight were brewed ; mash, and let stand, and then boil, &c.

XXXVl MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. kept in its proper place, applied to its proper use, and mended, when the nature of the accident will allow, as soon as broken. If the economy of time w^as duly considered, the use- ful affairs transacted before amusements were allowed, and a regular plan of employment was daily laid down, a great deal might be done without hurry or fatigue; and it would be a most pleasant retrospect at the end of the year, were it possible to enumerate all the valu- able accpiirements made, and the good actions per- formed, by an active woman. If the subject of servants be thought ill-timed in a book upon family arrangement, it must be by those who do not recollect that the regularity and good manage- ment of the heads wdll be insufficient, if not seconded by those who are to execute orders. It behoves every person to be extremely careful w horn he takes into his service; to be very minute in investigating the cliarac- ter he receives, and equally cautious and scrupulously just in giving one to others. Were this attended to, many bad people would be incapacitated for doing mis- chief, by abusing the trust reposed in them. It may be fairly asserted, that the robbery, or waste, which is but a milder epithet for the unfaithfulness of a servant, will be laid to the charge of that master or mistress, who, knowing, or having well-founded suspicions, of such faults, is prevailed upon by false jiit)', or entreaty, to slide him into another jdace. There arc, however, some w ho are unfortunately capricious, and often refuse to give a character, because they are displeased that a servant leaves their service: but this is unpardonable, and an absolute robbery, servants having no inheritance.

222 DOMESTIC COOKERY. A George Pudding. Boil very tender a handful of whole rich in a small quantity of milk, with a large piece of lemon-peel. Let it drain; then mix with it a dozen of good-sized apples, boiled to a pulp as dry as possible ; add a glass of white- wine, the yolks of five eggs, two ounces of orange and citron cut thin ; make it pretty sweet. Line a mould or basin with a very good paste; heat the five whites of the fggs to a very strong froth, and mix with the other ingre- dients; fill the mould, and bake it of a fine brown colour. Serve it with the bottom upwards, with the following sauce: two glasses of wine, a spoonful of sugar, the yolks of two eggs, and a bit of butter as large as a wal- nut ; simmer without boiling, and jrour to and from the saucepan, till of a proper thickness; and put in the dish. An excellent plain Potato Pudding. Take eight ounces of boiled potatoes, two ounces of butter, the yolks and whites of two eggs, a quarter of a pint of cream, one spoonful of white wine, a morsel of salt, the juice and rind of a lemon ; beat all to froth; sugar to taste. A crust or not, as you like. Bake it. If wanted richer, put three ounces more butter, sweet- meats and almonds, and another egg. Potato Pudding with Meat. Boil potatoes all fit to mash; rub through a colander, and make into a thick batter with milk and two eggs. Lay some seasoned steaks in a dish, then some batter ; and over the last layer pour the remainder of the batter. Bake a fine brown. An exceedinghj good Potato Suet-Pudding. To a pound of mashed potatoes, while hot, add four ounces of suet and two ounces of Hour, a little salt, and as much milk as will give it the consistence of common suet-pudding. Put it into a dish, or roll it into dump- lings, and bake of a fine brown.

SWEET DISHES AND SWEETMEATS. 27 r An excellent Trifle. Lay macaroons and ratafia-drops over the bottom of your dish, and pour in as much raisin-wine as they will suck up; which when they have done, pour on them cold rich custard made with more eggs than directed in the foregoing pages, and some rice-flour. It must stand two or three inches thick; on that put a layer of rasp- berry jam, and cover the whole with a very high whip made the day before, of rich cream, the whites of two w'ell-beaten eggs, sugar, lemon-peel and raisin wine, well beat with a whisk kept only to whip syllabubs and creams.

Lay it over the apples with a spoon ; and then put on it a whip made the day before, as for other trifles. Chantilly Cake, or Cake Trifle. Bake a rice-cake in a mould. When cold, cut it round about two inches from the edge with a sharp knife, taking care not to perforate the bottom.

Boil a quart of new milk with a large piece of cinna- mon ; thicken it with flour of rice, first wetted with cold milk; and sweeten to your taste. Pour it into a dish; and when cold cut it into the shape of a star, or any

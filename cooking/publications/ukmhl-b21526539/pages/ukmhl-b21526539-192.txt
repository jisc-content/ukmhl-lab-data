DOMESTIC COOKERY. 110 the crust before serving, and garnish with hard eggÂ«, boiled onions, and Indian pickle. Fowls roasted. Serve with egg-sauce, bread-sauce, or parsley and butter in tureens; or garnished with sausages, or scalded parsley. A large barn-door fowl, well hung, should be stuffed in the crop with sausage-meat; and served with gravy in the dish, and with bread-sauce. The head should be turned under the wing, as a turkey. Foivls broiled. Split them down the back; pepper, salt, and broil. Serve with mushroom-sauce. Another way. Cut a large fowl into four quarters, put them on a bird-spit, and tie that on another spit, and half roast; or half roast the whole fowl, and finish on the gridiron, which will make it less dry than if wholly broiled. The fowl that is not cut before roasted must be split down the back after. Davenport Fowls. Hang young fowls a night.; take the livers, hearts, and tenderest parts of the gizzards, the last being previously boiled, shred .very small, with half a handful of young clary, an anchovy to each fowl, an onion, and the yolks of four eggs boiled hard, with pepper, salt and mace, to your taste. Stuff the fowls with this, and sew up the vents and necks quite close, that the w'ater may not get in. Boil them in salt and water till almost done; then drain them, and put them into a stewpan with butter enough to brown them. Serve with a good deal of melted butter, with either soy or ketchup in it.

Bone, singe, and wash a young fowl; make a force- meat of four ounces of veal, two ounces of scraped lean of ham, two ounces of fat bacon, two hard yolks of eggs,

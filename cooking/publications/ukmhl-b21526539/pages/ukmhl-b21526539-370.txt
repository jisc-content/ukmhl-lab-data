DOMESTIC COOKERY. 288 but not boiled to mash, dry it on the shallow end of a sieve before the fire, and either serve it dry', or put it in the middle of a dish, and pour the gravy round, having heated it. Carrole of Rice. Take some well-picked rice, wash it well, and boil it five minutes in water, strain it, and put it into a ;-,tew- pan with a bit of butter, a good slice of ham, and an onion. Stew it over a very gentle fire till tender : have ready a mould lined with very thin slices of bacon: mix the yolks of two or three eggs with the rice, and then line the bacon with it about half an inch thick; put into it a ragout of chicken, rabbit, veal, or of anything else. Fill up the mould, and cover it close with rice. Bake it in a quick oven an hour, turn it over, and send it to table in a good gravy, or curry-sauce. Casserol, or Rice Edging, see page 162. Sabnagundy Is a beautiful small dish, if in nice shape, and if the colours of the ingredients are varied. For this purpose chop separately the white part of cold chicken or veal, yolks of eggs boiled hard, the whites of eggs, parsley, half a dozen anchovies, beet-root, red pickled cabbage, ham and grated tongue, or anything wxll flavoured, and of a good colour. Some people like a small proportion of onion, but it may be better omitted. A saucer, large tea-cup, or any other base, must be put into a small dish; then make rows round it wide at bottom, and growing smaller towards the top; choosing such of the ingredients for each row as will most vary the colours. At the top a little sprig of curled parsley may be stuck in ; or without anything on the dish, the sabnagundy may be laid in rows, or put into the half whites of eggs, which may be made to stand upright by cutting oflâ€˜ a little bit at the round end. In the latter case, each half- egg has but one ingredient. Curled butter and parsley may be put as garnish between.

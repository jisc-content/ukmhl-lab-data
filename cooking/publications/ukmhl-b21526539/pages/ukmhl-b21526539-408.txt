DOMESTIC COOKERY. 326- of seeds, two spoonsful of yest, and the same of milk and water. Note.—Milk alone causes cake and bread soon to dry. Common Bread Cake. Take the quantity of a quartern loaf from the dough, w’hen making white bread, and knead w^ell into it two ounces of butter, two of Lisbon sugar, and eight of cur- rants. Warm the butter in a tea-cupful of good milk. By the addition of an ounce of butter or sugar, or an egg or two, you may make the cake the better. A tea- cupful of raw cream improves it much. It.is best to. bake it in a pan, rather than as a loaf, the outside being less hard. Queen Cake. Mix a pound of dried flour, the same of sifted sugar, ^nd of washed clean currants. Wash a pound of butter in rose-water, beat it well, then mix with it eisht egffs, yolks and whites beaten separately, and put in the dry- ingredients by degrees beat the whole an hour ; butter little tins, tea cups or saucers, and bake the batter in, filling only half. Sift a little fine sugar over just as you put into the oven. Another way. Beat eight ounces of butter, and mix with two well- beaten eggs strained; mix eight ounces of dried flour, and the same of lump-sugar, and the grated rind of a lemon ; then add the whole together, and beat full half an hour with a silver spoon. Butter small pattypans, half fill, and bake tw'enty minutes in a quick oven. Swiss Cake. Blanch and pound six ounces of sweet, and two of bitter almonds, adding by degrees six ounces of lump sugar, and then the yolks of seven and the whites of five fresh eggs, beaten separately, and to the last moment, with a spoonful of rose-water ; when w'ell incorporated, put in the whole of another egg, with a spoonful more of rose-water, and beat the cake ten minutes.

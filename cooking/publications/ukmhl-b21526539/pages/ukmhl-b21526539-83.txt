3 FISH. and the red to the grey. They should he very firm.— Their season is August. Gudgeons.—They are chosen by the same rules as other fish. They are taken in running streams; come in about Midsummer, and are to he had for five or six months. Trout and Qrarjling are excellent fish, and taken in running streams; but the latter is to be found in only a few counties. In season chiefly in the summer months. Eels.—There is a greater diflerence in the goodness of eels than of any other fish. The true silver-eel (so called from the bright colour of the belly) is caught in the Thames. The Dutch eels sold at Billingsgate are very bad; those taken in great floods are generally good, but those in ponds have usually a strong, rank flavour. Except the middle of summer, they are always in season. Flounders.—They should be thick, firm, and have their eyes bright. They very soon become flabby and bad. They are both sea and river fish. The Thames produces the best. They are in season from January to March, and from July to September. Lobsters.—If they have not been long taken, the claws will have a strong motion when you put your finger on the eyes and press them. The heaviest are the best, and it is preferable to boil them at home. When you buy them ready boiled, try whether their tails are stiff, and pull up with a spring; if otherwise, they are not fresh. The cock-lobster is known by the narrow back part of his tail, and the two uppermost fins within it are stiff and hard; but those of the hen are soft, and the tail broader. The male, though generally smaller, has the highest flavour, the flesh is firmer, and the colour when boiled is a deeper red. Crabs.—The heaviest are best, and those of a mid- dling size are sweetest. If light, they are watery: when in perfection, the joints of the legs are stiff', and the body has a very agreeable smell. The eyes look dead and loose when stale.

362 DOMESTIC COOKERY. POULTRY-YARD. Management of Fowls. I n order to have fine fowls, it is necessary to choose a good breed, and have proper cafe taken of them. The Dartford sort is thought highly of; and it is desirable to have a fine large kind, but people differ in their opinion of which is best. The black are very juicy, but do not answer so well for boiling, as their legs partake of their colour. They should be fed as nearly as pos- sible at the same hour and place. Potatoes boiled un- skinned, in a little water, and then cut, and either w'et with skimmed milk or not, form one of the best foods. Turkeys and fowls thrive amazingly on them. The milk must not be sour. The best age for setting a hen is from two to five years; and you should remark which hens make the best breeders, and keep those to laying who are giddy and careless of their young. In justice to the animal creation, however, it must be observed, there are but few instances of bad parents for the time their nursing is necessary. Hens sit twenty days. Convenient places should be provided for their laying, as these will be proper for sitting likewise. If the hen-house is not secured from vermin, the eggs will be sucked and the fowls destroyed. Tliose hens are usually preferred which have tufts of feathers on their heads; those that crow are not looked upon as profitable. Some fine young fowls should be reared every year, to keep up a stock of good breeders; and by this attention, and removing bad layers and careless nurses, you will have a chmice of a good stock. Let tlie hens lay, some time before you set them, which should be done from the end of February to the beginning of May. While hens are laying, feed them well, and sometimes wfith oats. Broods of chickens are hatched all through the sum- mer, but those that come out very late require much care till they have gained some strength.

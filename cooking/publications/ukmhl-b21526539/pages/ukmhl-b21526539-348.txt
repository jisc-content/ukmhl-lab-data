Shake it, that it do not burn, and serve. Souffle of Rice and Apple. Blanch Carolina Rice, strain it, and set it to boil in milk, with lemon-peel, and a bit of cinnamon. Let it boil till the rice is dry; then cool it, and raise a rim three inches high round the dish, having egged the dish where it is put, to make it stick. Then egg the rice all over. Fill the dish half-way up with the marmalade of apples : have ready the whites of four eggs, beaten to a fine froth, and put "them over the marmalade : then sift fine sugar over it, and set it in the oven, which should be warm enough to give it a beautiful colour.

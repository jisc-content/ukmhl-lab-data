182 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Beefsteak Pie. Take beef-steaks that have been well hung; heal them gently with a circular steak-beater : season w'ith pepper, salt, and a little shalot minced very fine. Roll each slice with a good piece of fat, and fill your dish. Put some crust on the edge, and only an inch below it; and a cup of water or broth in the dish.

Lay over the whole some very thin slices of ham, and fill up the dish with w'ater; cover; and when it is taken out of the oven, pour in at the top, through a funnel, some

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 104 and inclining to dusky yellow; a wild one has the feet reddish, and smaller than the tame. They should be picked dry. Ducklings must he scalded. Pigeons should be very fresh; when they look flabby about the vent, and that part is discoloured, they are stale. The feet should be supple; if old, the feet are harsh. The tame ones are larger than the wild, and are thought best by some persons; they should be fat and tender; but many are deceived in their size, because a full crop is as large as the whole body of a small pigeon.

There are three sorts; the gray, green, and bastard plover, or lapwing. p[are or Rabbit.—If the claws are hlunt and rugged, the ears dry and tough, and the haunch thick, it is old ; hut if the claws are smooth and sharp, the ears easily tear, and the cleft in the lip is not much spread, it is young. If fresh and newly killed, the body w-ill be stiff, and, in hares, the flesh pale. But they keep a good •while by proper care; and are best when rather begin- ning to turn, if the inside is preserved from being musty.

If young, the bill is of a dark colour, and the legs yellowish; if fresh, the vent will be firm; but this part will look greenish if stale. Pheasants.—The cock-bird is accounted best, except when the hen is with egg. If young, he has short blunt

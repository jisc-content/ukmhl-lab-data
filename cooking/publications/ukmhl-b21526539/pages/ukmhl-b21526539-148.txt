To pot Veal or Chicken with Ham. Pound some cold veal or white of chicken, seasoned as directed in the last article, and put layers of it with layers of ham pounded, or rather shred; press each down, and cover with butter. This eats excellently; and, turned out whole, makes a pretty corner-dish for a second course : or it may be sliced. Veal Cake. Boil six or eight eggs hard; cut the yolks in two, and lay some of the pieces in the bottom of the pot; shake in a little chopped parsley, some slices of veal and ham, add then eggs again; shaking in after each some chopped parsley, with pepper and salt, till the pot is full. Then put in water enough to cover it, and lay on it about an ounce of butter; tie it over with a double paper, and bake it about an hour. Then press it close together with a spoon, and let it stand till cold. It may be put into a small mould; and then it will turn out beautifully for a supper or side dish. Chartreuse. Line a copper mould with fat bacon, lay sliced carrots and turnips round the edges, then cover with a force- meat, and put in a fricassee of veal or fowl. Cover the top of the mould with a paste, bake it an hour, and serve it turned out upon a dish. Marble Veal.

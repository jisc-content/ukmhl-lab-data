Epaule d’Agneau au nature 1.—Shoulder of Lamb dressed plain. Bone a small fat shoulder of lamb, leaving only au inch and a half of the knuckle. IMince a little of the fat with some white pepper and salt, and lay it on the inner side. With a large needle and coarse thread, gather together the circumference of the meat; press it flat, and fasten the little bone as a handle in its proper jflace. Then lay at the bottom of a casserole a large sliced onion, half a lemon, without any of the peel, three small carrots, cut lengthways, and one clove ; on these lay the lamb; and round the lamb put strips of bacon about the size of your finger ; throw in a little parsley,, and cover the meat with veal broth. Set the pan on a very slow fire, and place wood embers on the lid. Sim- mer two hours. Keep the meat hot while the gravy is strained, and add to it a little veloute: boil very quick, and throw it over the lamb. Note.—At the same time another little dish may be prepared with the lamb; uhich will also add to its richness.

PIES. 181 must be added, when the goodness of the shells is ob- tained ; give a boil or two, and pour into the dish s:trained ; strew some crumbs, and put a paste over all; bake slowly, but only till the paste be done. A remarkably fine Fish Pie. Boil two pounds of small eels; having cut the fins quite close, pick the flesh off, and throw the bones into the liquor with a little mace, pepper, salt, and slice of onion; boil till quite rich and strain it. Make force- meat of the flesh, an anchovy, parsley, lemon-peel, salt, pepper, and crumbs, and four ounces of butter warmed, and lay it at the bottom of the dish. Take the flesh of soles, small cod, or dressed turbot, and lay them on the forcemeat, having rubbed it with salt and pepper: pour the gravy over, and bake. Observe to take off the skin and fins, if cod or soles. Pilchard and Leek Pie. Clean and skin the white part of some large leeks; scald in milk and water, and put them in layers into a dish, and between the layers, two or three salted pil- chards which have been soaked for some hours the day before. Cover the whole with a good plain crust. When the pie is taken out of the oven, lift up the side crust with a knife, and empty out all the liquor; then pour in half a pint of scalded cream. Oyster Pie. As you open the oysters separate them from the liquor, which strain; parboil them after taking off the beards. Parboil sweetbreads, and cutting them in slices, lay them and the oysters in layers, season very lightly with salt, pepper, and mace. Then put half a tea-cup of liquor, and the same of gravy. Bake in a slow oven; and before you serve, put a tea-cup of cream, a little more oyster liquor, and a cup of while gravy, all warmed, but not boiled.

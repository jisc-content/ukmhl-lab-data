DOMESTIC COOKERY. 280 Observe, feet for all jellies are boiled so long by the people who sell them, that they are less nutritious; they should be only scalded, to take off the hair. The liquor will require greater care in removing the fat ; but the jelly will be far stronger, and of course allow more water. Note.—Jelly is equally good made of cow-heels nicely cleaned ; and as they bear a less price than those of calves, and make a stronger jelly, this observation may be useful. Another loay. Boil four quarts of water with three calf’s feet, or two cow-heels, that have been only scalded, till half wasted ; take the jelly from the fat and sediment; mix with it the juice of a Seville orange and twelve lemons; the peels of three ditto, the whites and shells of twelve eggs, brown sugar to taste, near a pint of raisin wine, one ounce of coriander-seeds, a quarter of an ounce of allspice, a bit of cinnamon, and six cloves, all bruised, after having previously mixed them cold. The jelly should boil fifteen minutes without stirring; then clear it through a flannel bag. While running, take a little jelly, and mix with a tea-cupful of water in wliich a bit of beet-root has been boiled, and run it through the bag when all the rest is run out; and this is to garnish the other jelly, being cooled on a plate; but this is matter of choice. This jelly has a very fine high colour and flavour. Fruit in Jelly. Put into a basin half a pint of clear calf’s-foot jelly ; and when it has become stiff, lay in three fine peaches, and a bunch of grapes wdth the stalk upwards; over which put a few vine-leaves, and fill up the bowl with jelly. Let it stand till next day, and then set the bowl in hot water up to tlic brim for a minute ; tlien turn it out carefully on a dish. Orange Jelly. Grate the rind of tvvo Seville and two China oranges,

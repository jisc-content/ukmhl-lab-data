DOMESTIC COOKERY. 58 butter poured over it.â€”You may pot some of it, or dress in any of the ways hereafter directed for dressing veal. Knuckle of Veal. As few people like boiled veal, it may be well to leave the knuckle small, by taking off some cutlets, or coUops, before it be dressed ; and as the knuckle will keep longer than the fdlet, it is best not to cut off the slices till wanted. Break the bones, to make it take less room; wash it well; and put it into a saucepan with three onions, a blade of mace or two, and a few peppercorns; cover it with water, and simmer it till quite ready. In the mean time some macaroni should be boiled with it if ap- proved, or rice, or a little rice-flour, to give it a small degree of thickness; but do not put too much.

no DOMESTIC COOKERY. Pickled Onions. In tlie montli of September, choose the small white round onions, take off the brown skin, have ready a very nice tin stewpan of boiling water, throw in as many onions as will cover the top; as soon as they look clear on the outside, take them up as quick as possible with a slice, and lay them on a clean cloth ; cover them close with another, and scald some more, and so on. Let them lie to he cold, then put them in a jar or wide- mouthed glass bottles, and pour over them the best white-wine vinegar, just hot, but not boiling. When cold, cover them. Should the outer skin shrivel, peel it off. They must look quite clear. To pickle red Cabbage. Slice it into a colander, and sprinkle each layer with salt; let it drain two days, then put it into a jar, and pour boiling vinegar enough to cover, and put a few slices of red beet-root. Choose the purple red cabbage. Those who like the flavour of spice will boil it with the vine- gar. Cauliflower cut in branches, and thrown in after being salted, will look of a beautiful red. Pickled Lemons. They should be small, and with thick rinds': rub them with a piece of flannel; then slit them half down in four quarters, but not through to the pulp : fill the slits with salt hard pressed in, set them upright in a pan for four or five days, until the salt melts; turn them thrice a day in their own liquor, until tender; make enough pickle to cover them, of rape-vinegar, the brine of the lemons, Jamaica pepper, and ginger; boil and skim it; when cold, put it to the lemons, with two ounces of mustard-seed, and two cloves of garlic to six lemons. When the lemons are used, the pickle will be useful in fish or other sauces. Olives. They are of three kinds,â€”the French, Spanish, and Italian. They differ in taste and appearance, and must be chosen accordingly as each is preferred.

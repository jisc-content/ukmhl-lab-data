If the butter be strong that is used in puddings, they will not taste well, whatever good things be added. A small pinch of salt improves the flavour of all mix- tures, even when the other ingredients are sweet. Well-made raisin wine will serve, in most cases, when wine is ordered for puddings. As the goodness of boiled puddings greatly depends upon keeping the water from the ingredients, the cook should take care to have moulds and basins in readiness that will exactly hold the quantity directed. Puddings of bread or flour are much better if all the ingredients be mixed (except the eggs) three hours before boiling or baking ; and they should be well stirred just before they are put into the oven or saucepan. When butter is ordered to be put warm into puddings, the addition of a little milk or wine will prevent its oiling. Half an hour should be allowed for boiling a bread pudding in a half-pint basin, and so on in proportion. A mealy potato, grated wdiile hot, and beaten well with a spoonful of milk, will add greatly to the lightness of plum puddings, whether boiled or baked. Almond Pudding. Beat half a pound of sweet and a few bitter almonds with a spoonful of water 3 then mix four ounces of but- ter, four eggs, two spoonsful of cream, warm with the butter, one of brandy, a little nutmeg, and sugar to taste. Butter some cups, half fill, and bake the puddings. Serve with pudding-sauce. Another.

Wlien well mixed, bake it half an hour, with paste round the dish.

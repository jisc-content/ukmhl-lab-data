35 MEATS. as well as by the above observations; for if the cook, when told to prevent the copper from boiling quick, lets it stop from boiling entirely, the usual time will be in- sufficient, and the meat will be underdone. The time must be reckoned from the instant when the water boils . . . Weigh the meat, and allow for all solid joints a quarter of an hour for every pound, and some minutes (from ten to twenty) over, according as the family like it done. A ham of twenty pounds will take four hours and a half, and others in proportion. Hams should be put into boiling water if not over dry, and only simmer the whole time. A tongue, if dry, takes four hours slow boiling, after soaking; a tongue, out of pickle, from two hours and a half to three hours, or more if very large; it must be judged by feeling whether it is very tender. A leg of pork or of lamb takes the allowance of twenty minutes, above a quarter of an hour to a pound. A neck of mutton will take an hour and a half, if kept at a proper distance. A chine of pork two hours. The meat should be put a good distance from the fire, and brought gradually nearer when the inner part be- comes hot, which will prevent its being scorched while yet raw. All meats should be much basted; when done, draw the spit very near to the fire, sprinkle with salt, and flour it well, that the meat may go up well frothed. Beef of ten pounds will take above two hours and a half; twenty pounds will take three hours and three- quarters. In roasting meat it is a very good way to put a little salt and water into the dripping-pan, and baste for a little while with this, before using its owm fat or dripping. When dry, dust it with flour, and baste as usual. Salting meat, when first put down, draws out the grav\\ Such as is not very fat should have some paper put over to preserve it.

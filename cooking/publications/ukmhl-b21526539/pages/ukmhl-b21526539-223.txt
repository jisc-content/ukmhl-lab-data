Skin an old fowl, cut it down the back, from which re- move the rump and the brown parts adhering to the bones. Wash the fowl, and put it into three pints of water, with two blades of mace, and a spoonful of washed rice: let it boil up, skim it nicely twice, then stop the saucepan close, and simmer three hours.

Simmer an hour and a half, closely covered, and then strain it off for use. If for brown soup, first fry the fish brown in butter, and then do as above. It will not keep more than two or three days.

Eel Soup. Take three pounds of small eels ; put to them two quarts of water, a crust of bread, three blades of mace, some whole pepper, an onion, and a bunch of sweet herbs ; cover them close, and stew till the fish is quite broken; then strain it off.

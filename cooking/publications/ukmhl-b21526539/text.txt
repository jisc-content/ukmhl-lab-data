Haa. lsuaNjdU.R^ FIFTY-EIGHTH EDITION, . CORRECTED} AND AUGMENTED WITH A NEW CHAPTER ON FRENCH COOKERY. ** This isTcally one of the most practically useful books of any which we have seen on the subject. The Lady who lias written it has not studied how to form expensive articles for luxurious tables, but to combine ele(;ance witli economy ; she has given her directions in a plain sensible manner, that eveiy body can understand, and these are not confined merely to cookerv, but are cxter.dcd to a valid y of objects in use in families ; by which means the utility of the book U very much increased indeed.”—British Critic.

IS 0^0,Schelly ADVERTISEMENT. ylS the following directions were intended for the con- duct of the fariiilies of the authoress's oivn daughters, and for the arrangement of iheir table, so as to unite a good figure with proper economy, she has avoided, all excessive luxury, such as essence of ham, and that wasteful expenditure of large quantities of meat for gravy, 'ichich so grea,tly contributes to keep up the price, and is no less injurious to those who eat than to those whose penury obliges them to abstavi. Many receipts are given for things which, being in daily use, the mode of preparing them may be suprposed too well- linoivn to require a place in d cookery-book, yet ive rarely meet ivith butter properly melted, good toast-and- water, or well-made coffee. She makes no apology for minuteness m some articles, or for leaving others un- noticed, because she does not write for professed cooks. This little icork would, have been a treasure to herself ivhen she first set out in life, and she therefore hopes it may prove useful to others. In that expectation it is given to the public ; ami as she will receive from it no EMOLUMENT,* so she trusts it will escape without censure. * The authoress, Mus. Rlndei.i,, sister of the Eminent Jeweller on Ludgate-hill, was, afterwards, induced to accept the sum of Two Taoiisand Guineas, from the publisher.DIRECTIONS TO THE BINDER.

In every rank, those deserve the greatest praise who best acquit themselves of the duties which their station requires. Indeed, this line of conduct is not a matter of choice but of necessity, if we would maintain the dig- nity of our character as rational beings. In the variety of female acquirements, though do- mestic occupations stand not so high in esteem as they formerly did, yet, when neglected, they produce much human misery. There was a time when ladies knew nothing beyond their own family concerns; but in the present day there are many who know nothing about them. Each of these extremes should be avoided; but is there no way to unite in the female character cultiva- tion of talents, and habits of usefulness ? Happily there are still great numbers in every situation, whose exam- ple proves that this is possible. Instances may be found of ladies in the higher walks of life, who condescend to examine the accounts of their house-steward; and, by overlooking and wisely directing tbe e.xpenditure of that part of their husband’s income which falls under their own inspection, avoid the inconveniences of embarrassed circumstances. How much more necessaiy, then, is domestic knowledge in those whose limited fortunesMISCELIANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. XXVI press on tlieir attention considerations of the strictest economy! There ought to be a material difference in the degree of care which a person of a large and inde- pendent estate bestows on money-concerns, and that of a person in confined circumstances: yet both may very commendably employ some portion of their time and thoughts on this subject. The custom of the times tends in some measure to abolish the distinctions of rank; and the education given to young people is nearly the same in all; but though the leisure of the higher may be well devoted to different accomplish- ments, the pursuits of those in a middle line, if less ornamental, would better secure their own happiness and that of others connected with them. We sometimes bring up children in a manner calculated rather to fit them for the station W'e wish, than that which it is likely they will actually possess; and it is in all cases worth the while of parents to consider whether the expectation or hope of raising their offspring above their own situa- tion be well founded. The cultivation of the understanding and disposition, how'ever, is not here alluded to; for a judicious im- provement of both, united to firm and early-taught religious principles, would enable the happy possessor of these advantages to act well on all occasions; nor would young ladies find domestic knowledge a burden, or inconsistent with higher attainments, if the rudiments of it were inculcated at a tender age, when activity is so pleasing. If employment be tiresome to a liealthy child, the fault must be traced to habits which, from many causes, arc not at present favourable to the,future con- dition of women. It frequently happens, that beforeMISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. XXVU impressions of duty are made, on the mind, ornamental education commences; and it ever after takes the lead: thus, what should be only the embellishment becomes the main business of life. There is no opportunity of attaining a knowledge of family management at school; and during vacations all subjects that might interfere with amusement are avoided. When a girl, whose family moves in the higher ranks of life, returns to reside at her father’s house after com' pleting her education, her introduction to the gay world, and a continued course of pleasures, persuade her at once that she was born to be the ornament of fashion- able circles, rather than to sioop (as she would conceive it) to undertake the arrangement of a family, though by that means she might in various ways augment the satisfaction and comfort of her parents. On the other hand, persons of an inferior sphere, and especially in the lower order of middling life, are almost always anxious to give their cliildren such advantages of edu- cation as themselves did not possess. Whether their indulgence be productive of the happiness so kindly aimed at, must be judged by the effects, which are not very favourable, if what has been taught has not pro- duced humility in herself, and increased gratitude and respect to the authors of her being. Were a young woman brought to relish home society, and the calm delights of agreeable occupation, before she entered into the delusive scenes of pleasure, presented by the theatre and other dissipations, it is probalde she would soon make a comparison much in favour of the former, especially if restraint did not give to the latter addi- tional relish. If we carry on qur observations to married life, we shallKxvm MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. find a life of employment to be the source of unnumbered pleasures. To attend to the nursing, and, at least, early instruction of children, and rear a healthy progeny in the ways of piety and usefulness; to preside over the family, and regulate the income allotted to its mainte- nance: to make home the sweet refuge of a husband, fatigued by intercourse with a jarring world: to be his enlightened companion and the chosen friend of his heart: these, these are woman’s duties!—and delightful ones they are, if haply she be married to a man whose soul can duly estimate her worth, and who will brins: his share to the common stock of felicity. Of such a woman, one may truly say, ‘ Happy the man who can call her his wife ! Blessed are the children who call her mother!’ When we thus observe her, exercising her activity and best abilities in appropriate cares and increasing excellence, are we not ready to say, she is the agent for good of that benevolent Being who placed her on earth to fulfil such sacred obligations, not to waste the talents committed to her charge? When it is thus evident that the high intellectual at- tainments may find exercise in the multifarious occupa- tions of the daughter, the wife, the mother, and the mistress of the house, can any one urge that the female mind is contracted by domestic employ ? It is, however, a great comfort that the duties of life are within the reach of humbler abilities, and that she whose chief aim is to fulfil them, will rarely ever fail to acquit herself well. United with, and jierhaps crowning all the vir- tues of the female character, is that well-directed duc- tility of mind, wliich occasionally bends its attention to the smaller objects of life, knowing them to be often scarcely less essential than the greater.X.XIX MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. Hence the direction of a table is no inconsiderable branch of a lady’s concern, as it involves judgment in expenditure, respectability of appearance, and the com- fort of her husband and those who partake their hospi- tality. The mode of covering the table differs in taste. It is not the multiplicity of things, but the choice, the dressing, and the neat, pleasing look of the whole, which gives respectability to her who presides. Too much or too little dinners are extremes not uncom- mon : the latter is in appearance and reality the effort of poverty or penuriousness to be genteel; and the former, if constantly given, may endanger the circum- stances of those who are not affluent. Generally speaking, dinners are far less sumptuous than formerly, when half-a-dozen dishes were supplied for what one now costs; consequently, those whose fortunes are not great, and who wish to make a genteel appearance without extravagance, regulate their table accordingly. Perhaps there are few incidents in which the respec- tability of a man is more immediately felt, than the style of dinner to which he accidentally may bring home a visitor. Every one is to live as he can afford, and the meal of the tradesman ought not to emulate the enter- tainments of the higher classes; but if two or three dishes are well served, with the usual sauces, the table-lineij clean, the small sideboard neatly laid, and all that is necessary be at hand, the expectation of the husband and friend will be gratified, because no irregularity of domestic arrangement will disturb the social intercourse. The same observation holds good on a larger scale. InXXX MISCEI.LANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. all situations of life, the entertainment should be no less suited to the station than to the fortune of the enter- tainer, and to the number and rank of those in^'ited. The manner of carving is not only a verj' necessary branch of information, to enable a lady to do the ho- nours of her table, but makes a considerable difference in the consumption of a family: and though in large parties she is so much assisted as to render this know- ledge apparently of less consequence, yet she must at times feel the deficiency; and should not fail to ac- quaint herself with an attainment, the advantage of which is evident every day. Indeed, as fashions are so fleeting, it is more than probable that, before the end of this century, great at- tention to guests may be again the mode, as it was in the commencement of the last. Some people haggle meat so much as not to be able to help half-a-dozen persons decently from a large tongue, or a sirloin of beef; and the dish goes away vfith the appearance of having been gnawed by dogs. If the daughters of the family were to take the head of the table under the direction of their mother, they would fulfil its duties with grace, in the same easy manner as an early prac- tice in other domestic affairs gradually fits them for their own future houses. Habit alone can make good carvers; but some principal directions are hereafter given, with a reference to the annexed plates. The mistress of a family should always remember that the welfare and good management of the house depend on the eye of the superior; and, consequently, that nothing is too tinfling for her notice, whereby wnxste may be avoided.XXXI MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. ■ If a lady has never been accustomed, while single, to think of family management, let her not upon that ac- count fear that she cannot attain it; she may consult others who are more experienced, and acquaint herself with the necessary quantities of the several articles of family expenditure, in proportion to the number it con- sists of, the proper prices to pay, &c. &c. A minute account of the annual income, and the times of payment, should be taken in writing; likewise an esti- mate of the supposed amount of each article of expense; and those who are early accustomed to calculations on domestic articles, will acquire so accurate a knowledge of what their establishment requires, as will give them the happy medium between prodigality and parsimony, without acquiring the character of meanness. Perhaps few branches of female education are so useful as great readiness at figures. Accounts should be regularly kept, and not the smallest article omitted to be entered; and if balanced every week and month, &c., the income and outgoings will be ascertained with facility, and their proportions to each other be duly ob- served. Some people fix on stated sums to he appro- priated to each different article, and keep the money in separate purses; as house, clothes, pocket, education of children, &c. Whichever way accounts be entered, a certain mode should be adopted, and strictly adhered to. Many women are unfortunately ignorant of the state of their husband’s income; and others are only made acquainted with it, when some speculative project, or profitable transaction, leads them to make a false esti- mate of what can be afforded; and it too often happensxxxu MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. that both parties, far from consulting each other, squan- der money in ways that they would even wish to forget; whereas marriage should he a state of mutual and per- fect confidence, and similarity of pursuits, which would secure that happiness it was intended to bestow. There are so many valuable women who excel as wives, that it is a fair inference there would be few ex- travagant ones, were they consulted by their husbands on subjects that concern the mutual interest of both parties. Within the knowledge of the writer of these pages, many families have been reduced to poverty by the want of openness in the man on the subject of his affairs; and though on these occasions the Avomen Avere blamed, it has afterAvards appeared that they never Avere allowed a voice of inquiry, or suffered to reason upon Avhat sometimes appeared to them imprudent.

Some excuse Avas offered; to Avhich she replied,— ‘ Such is the sum I have allotted to house-keeping: should it be exceeded one Aveek, the next must repay it. The General Avill have no public day this Aveek.’ The fault Avas never repeated.

Ready money sliould be paid for all such things as come not into weekly bills, and even for them a check is necessary. The best places for purchasing should he attended to. In some articles a discount of five per cent, is allowed for ready money, in London, and other large cities; and those who thus pay are usually best served. Under the idea of buying cheap, many go to new shops ; but it is safest to deal with people of established credit, wlio do not dispose of goods by underselling. To make tradesmen wait for their money injures them greatly, besides that a higher price must be paid; and in long bills, articles never bought are often charged. Perhaps the irregularity and failure of payment may have much evil influence on the jirice of various articles, and may contribute to the destruction of many families, from the highest to the lowest. Tims regularly conducted, the exact state of money affairs will be known rvith ease; for it is the delay of payment tliat occasions confusion. A commonplace-book should be always at hand, in which to enter such hints of useful knowledge, and other observations, as are given ])y sensible, experienced people. Want of attention to what is advised, or supposing things too minute to be worth liearing, are the causes why so much ignorance prevails on necessary subjects, among those who are not backward in frivolous ones. It is very necessary for a woman to be informed of the prices and goodness of all articles in common use, and of the best times, as well as places, for purchasing them. She should also be accpiainted with the compa- rative ]>rices of provisions, in order that she may be able to substitute those that are most reasonable, when they cXXXIV MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. will answer as well, for others of the same kind, Init which are more costly. A false notion of economy leads many to purchase, as bargains, what is not wanted, and sometimes never is used. Were this error avoided, more money would remain for other purposes. It is not unusual among lower dealers to put off a large quantity of goods, hy assurances that they are advancing in price; and many who supply faney articles are so successfid in persuasion, that purchasers not imfrequentlv go far beyond their original intention, even to their own future disquiet. Some things are better for keeping, and, being in constant consumption, should be laid in accordingly ; such as paper, soap, and candles. Of these, more here- after. To give unvarying rules cannot be attempted, for people ought to form their conduct on their circum- stances ; but it is presumed that a judicious arrange- ment, according to them, will be found equally advan- tageous to all. The minutinc of management must be regulated by every one’s fortune and rank. Some ladies, not deficient in either, charge themselves with giving out, once in a month, to a superintending servant, such quantities of household articles as by observation and calculation they know to be sufficient, reserving for their own key the large stock of things usually laid in for very large families in the country. Should there be several more visitors than usual, they can easily account for in- crease of consumption, and vice versa. Such a degree of judgment will be respectable even in the eye of do- mestics, if they are not interested in the ignorance of their employers ; and if they are, their services will not compensate for want of honesty.MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. XXXV ^\Tien young ladies marry, they frequently continue their own maid in the capacity of housekeeper; who, as they may be more attached to their interest than strangers, become very valuable servants. To such, the economical observations in this work will be as useful as the cookery ; and it is recommendable in them to be strictly observant of both, which, in the coiuse of a year or two, will make tbcnr familiar in the practice. It is much to be feared, that for the waste of many of the good things that God has given for our use, not abuse, the mistress and servants of great houses wdll hereafter be called to a strict account. Some part of every person’s fortune should be de- voted to charity; by which ‘ a pious woman will build up her house before God, while she that is foolish ( i. e., who lends nothing to the Lord) pulls it down with her hands.’ No one can complain of the want of gifts to the poor in this land ;—but there is a mode of relief w'hich would add greatly to their comfort, and which being prepared from superfluity, and such materials as are often thrown away, the expense would not be felt. In the latter part of this work some hints for preparing the above are given. By good hours, especially early breakfast, a family is more regular, and much time is saved. If orders be given soon in the morning, there will be more time to execute them ; and servants, by doing their work with ease, will be more equal to it, and fewer will be neces- sary. It is worthy of notice that the general expense will be reduced, and much time saved, if everything beXXXVl MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. kept in its proper place, applied to its proper use, and mended, when the nature of the accident will allow, as soon as broken. If the economy of time w^as duly considered, the use- ful affairs transacted before amusements were allowed, and a regular plan of employment was daily laid down, a great deal might be done without hurry or fatigue; and it would be a most pleasant retrospect at the end of the year, were it possible to enumerate all the valu- able accpiirements made, and the good actions per- formed, by an active woman. If the subject of servants be thought ill-timed in a book upon family arrangement, it must be by those who do not recollect that the regularity and good manage- ment of the heads wdll be insufficient, if not seconded by those who are to execute orders. It behoves every person to be extremely careful w horn he takes into his service; to be very minute in investigating the cliarac- ter he receives, and equally cautious and scrupulously just in giving one to others. Were this attended to, many bad people would be incapacitated for doing mis- chief, by abusing the trust reposed in them. It may be fairly asserted, that the robbery, or waste, which is but a milder epithet for the unfaithfulness of a servant, will be laid to the charge of that master or mistress, who, knowing, or having well-founded suspicions, of such faults, is prevailed upon by false jiit)', or entreaty, to slide him into another jdace. There arc, however, some w ho are unfortunately capricious, and often refuse to give a character, because they are displeased that a servant leaves their service: but this is unpardonable, and an absolute robbery, servants having no inheritance.MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. xxxvn ami depending on their fair name for employment. To refuse eountenance to the evil, and to encourage the good servant, are actions due to society at large; and such as are honest, frugal, and attentive to their duties, should be liberally rewarded, which would encourage merit, and inspire servants with zeal to acquit them- selves well. It may be proper to observe, that a retributive justice usually marks persons in that station, sooner or later, even in this world. The extravagant and idle in servi- tude are ill prepared for the industry and sobriety on w'hich their own future welfare so essentially depends. Their faults, and the attendant punishment, come home when they have children of their own; and sometimes much sooner. They wdll see their owm folly and wicked- ness peiqietuated in their offspring, whom they must not expect to be better than the example and instruction given by themselves. It was the observation of a sensible and experienced woman, that she could always read the fate of her ser- vants who married : those who had been faithful and industrious in her service, continued their good habits in their own families, and became respectable members of the community; those who were the contrary never were successful, and not unfrequently were reduced to the parish. A proper ipiantity of household articles should be always ready, and more bought in before the others be consumed, to prevent inconvenience, especially in the country. A bill of parcels and receipt should be required, evenXXXVlll MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. if the money be paid at the time of purchase; and, to avoid mistakes, let the goods he compared with these when brought home. Though'it is very disagreeable to suspect any one’s honesty, and perhaps mistakes have been unintentional, yet it is prudent to weigh meat, sugars, &c., when brought in, and compare with the charge. The butcher should be ordered to send the weight with the meat, and the cook to file these checks, to be examined when the weekly bill shall be delivered. Much trouble and irregularity are saved when there is company, if servants are required to prepare the table and sideboard in similar order daily. All things likely to be wanted should be in readiness: sugars of different qualities kept broken, currants washed, picked, and perfectly dry; spices pounded, and kept in very small bottles, closely corked; not more than will be used in four or five weeks should be pounded at a time. Much less is necessary than when boiled whole in gravies, &c. Where noonings or suppers are served, (and in every house some preparation is necessary for accidental vi- sitors,) care should be taken to have such things in readiness as are proper for either; a list of several will be subjoined, a change of which may be agreeable, and, if duly managed, will lie attended with little expense and much convenience. A ticket should be exchanged by the cook for every loaf of bread, which, when returned, will show the num- ber to be paid for; as tallies may be altered, unless one is kept by each party. Those who arc served with brewer’s beer, or anyMISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. XXXIX other articles not paid for weekly or on delivery, should keep a book for entering the dates; which will not only serve to prevent overcharges, but will show the whole year’s consumption at one view. An inventory of furniture, linen, and china should be kept, and the things examined by it twice a year, or oftener if there be a change of servants j into each of whose care the articles used by him or her should be intrusted, w’ith a list, as is done with plate. Tickets of parchment with the family name, numbered, and speci- fying what bed it belongs to, should be sewed on each feather-bed, bolster, pillow, and blanket. Knives, forks, and house-cloths are"; often deficient; these accidents might be obviated, if an article at the head of every list required the former shoidd be produced whole or broken, and the marked part of the linen,, though all the others should be worn out. The inducement to take care of glass is in some measure removed, by the increased price given for old flint glass.—Those who wish for trifle- dishes, butter-stands, &c., at a lower charge than cut glass, may buy them made in moulds, of which there is great variety that look extremely well, if not placed near the more beautiful articles. The price of starch depends upon that of flour: the best w'ill keep good in a dry warm room for some years; therefore, when bread is cheap it may be bought to ad- vantage, and covered close. Sugars being an article of considerable expense in all families, the purchase demands particular attention. The cheapest does not go so far as that more refined; and there is a difference even in the degree of sweetness. The white should be chosen that is close, heavy, andxl MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. shining. The best sort of brown has a bright gravelly look, and it is often to be bought pure as imported. East India sugars are finer for the price, but not so strong, consequently unfit for wines and sweetmeats, hut do well for common purposes, if good of their kind. To prepare white sugar, pounded, rolling it with a bot- tle, and sifting, wastes less than a mortar. Candles made in cool weather are best; and when their price, and that of soap, which rise and fall toge- ther, is likely to be higher, it will be prudent to lay in the stock of both. This information the chandler can always give; they are better for keeping eight or ten months, and will not injure for two years, if properly placed in the cool; and there are few articles that better deserve care in buying, and allowing a due quantity of, according to the size of the family. Paper, by keeping, improves in quality; and if bought by half or whole reams from large dealers will be much cheaper than purchased by the quire. Many well-meaning servants are ignorant of the best means of managing, and thereby waste as much as would maintain a small family, besides causing the mis- tress of the house much chagrin by their irregularity; and many families, from a want of metliod, have the appearance of chance rather than of regular system. To avoid this, the following hints may be useful as well as economical:— Every article should be kept in that place best suited to it, as much waste may thereby be avoided, viz.; Vegetables wdll keep best on a stone lloor, if the air be excluded.—Meat in a cold dry place.—Sugar and sweetmeats require a dry place; so does salt.—Candlesxli MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. cold, but not damp.—Dried meats, hams, &c., the same. ■—All sorts of seed for puddings, salop, rice, &c., should be close covered, to preserve from insects ; hut that will not prevent it, if long kept. Bread is so heavy an article of expense that all waste should he guarded against; and having it cut in the room will tend much to prevent it. Since the scarcity in 1795 and 1800, that custom has been much adopted. It should not he cut until a day old. Earthen pans and covers keep it best. Straw to lay apples on should he quite dry, to prevent a musty taste. Large pears should he tied up by the stalk. Basil, savory, or knotted marjoram, or London thyme, to he used when herbs are ordered ; hut with discretion, as they are very pungent. The best means to preserve blankets from moths is to fold and lay them under the feather-beds that are in use; and they should he shaken occasionally. When soiled, they ^should he washed, not scoured. Soda, by softening the water, saves a gi’eat deal of soap. It should he melted in a large jug of water, some of which pour into the tubs and boiler; and when the latter becomes weak, add more. The new improvement in soft soap is, if jiroperly used, a saving of nearly half in quantity; and though sometliing dearer than the hard, reduces the price of washing considerably. Many good laundresses advise soaping linen in warm water the night previous to washing, as facilitating the operation, with less friction. Soap should he cut with a wire or twine, in pieces that will make a long square, when first brought in, and keptMISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. xlii out of the air two or three weeks ; for if it dry quick, it will crack, and, when wet, break. Put it on a shelf, leaving a space between, and let it grow hard gradually. Thus, it will save a full-third in the consumption. Some of the lemons and oranges used for juice should be pared first to preserve the peel dry; some should be halved, and when squeezed, the pulp cut out, and the outsides dried for grating. If for boiling in any liquid, the first way is best. When these fruits are cheap, a proper quantity should be bought and prepared as above directed, especially by those who live in the country, where they cannot always be had ; and they are perpe- tually wanted in cookery. When w'hites of eggs are used for jelly, or other pur- poses, contrive to have pudding, custard, &c., to employ the yolks also. Should you not want them for several hours, beat them up with a httle water, and put them in a cool place, or they will be hardened and useless. It was a mistake of old, to think that the wliites made cakes and puddings heavy ; on the contrary, if beaten long and separately, they contribute greatly to give light- ness, are an advantage to paste, and make a pretty dish, beaten with fruit, to set in cream, &c. If copper utensils be used in the kitchen, the cook should be charged to be very careful not to let the tin be rubbed off, and to have them fresh done when the least defect appears, and never to put by any sou]), gravy, &c., in them, or any metal utensil; stone and earthen vessels should be provided for those purposes, as like- wise jilcnty of common dishes, that the table-set may not be useil to put by cold meat. Tin vessels, if kept damp, soon rust, which causesxliii MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. holes. Fenders, and tin linings of llower-pots, &c., should he painted every year or two. Vegetables soon sour, and corrode metals and glazed red ware, by which a strong poison is produced. Some years ago, the death of several gentlemen was occa- sioned at Salt-hill, by the cook sending a ragout to the table which she had kept from the preceding day in a copper vessel badly tinned. Vinegar, by its acidity, does the same, the glazing being of lead or arsenic. To cool liquors in hot weather, dip a cloth in cold water, and wrap it round the bottle two or three times, then place it in the sun; renew the process once or twice. The best way of scalding fruits, or boiling vinegar, is in a stone jar, or on a hot iron hearth; or by putting the vessel into a saucepan of water, called a w'ater-bath. If chocolate, coffee, jelly, gruel, bark, &c., be suffered to boil over the strength is lost. The cook should be encouraged to be carefiil of coals and cinders: for the latter there is a new contrivance to sift, without dispersing the dust of the ashes, by means of a covered tin bucket. Small coal wetted makes the strongest fire for the back, but must remain untouched until it cake. Cinders lightly wet give a gi'cat degree of heat, and are better than coal for furnaces, ironing-stoves, and ovens. The cook should be charged to take care of jelly-bags, tapes for the collared things, &c., which, if not perfectly scalded and kept dry, give an unpleasant flavour when next used.MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. xliv Cold water thrown on cast-iron, when hot, will cause it to crack. In the following, and indeed all other receipts, though the quantities may be as accurately directed as possible, yet much must be left to the discretion of the person who uses them. The different tastes of people require more or less of the flavour of spices, salt, garlic, butter, &c., which can never be ordered by general rules; and if the cook has not a good taste, and attention to that of her employers, not all the ingi'edients which nature and art can furnish will give exquisite flavour to her dishes. The proper articles should be at hand, and she must proportion them until the true zest be obtained, and a variety of flavour be given to the different dishes served at the same time. Those who require maigi'e dishes will find abundance in this little work; and where they are not strictly so, by suet or bacon being directed into stuffings, the cook must use Imtter instead; and where meat gra\-ies (or stock, as they are called) are ordered, those made of fish must be adopted.DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING. The carving-knife for a lady should be light, and of a middling size and fine edge. Strength is less required than address in the manner of using it; and to facilitate this, the cook should give orders to the butcher to divide ihe joints of the hones of all carcass-joints of mutton, lamb, and veal (such as neck, breast, and loin) ; which may then be easily cut into thin slices attached to the adjoining bones. If the whole of the meat belonging to each bone should be too thick, a small slice may be taken off between every two bones. The more fleshy joints (as fillet of veal, leg or saddle of mutton, and beef) are to be helped in thin slices, neatly cut and smooth. Observe to let the knife pass down to the bone in the mutton and beef joints. The dish should not be too far off the carver; as it gives an awkward appearance, and makes the task more difficult. Attention is to be paid to help every one to a part of such articles as are considered the best. In helping fish, take care not to break the flakes ; which in cod and very fresh salmon are large, and con- tribute much to the beauty of its appearance. A fish- knife, not being sharp, divides it best on this account. Help a part of the roe, milt, or liver, to each person. The heads of carp, part of those of cod and salmon, sounds of cod, and fins of turbot, are likewise esteemed niceties, and are to be attended to accordingly. In cutting up any wild-fowl, duck, goose, or turkey.xlvi DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING. for a large party, if you cut the slices down from pinion to pinion, without making wings, there will he more prime pieces. A Cod's Head.—Fish in general requires very little carving, the fleshy parts being those principally esteemed. A cod’s head and shoulders, when in season and properly- boiled, is a very genteel and handsome dish. "\Mien cut, it should be done with a fish-trowel, and the parts about the back-bone on the shoulders are the most firm and the best. Take off a piece quite down to the bone, in the direction a, b, c, d, putting in the spoon at a, c, and with each slice of fish give a piece of the sound, which lies underneath the back-bone and lines it, the meat of which is thin, and a little darker coloured than the body of the fish itself: this may be got by passing a knife or spoon underneath, in the direction d, f. About the head are many delicate parts, and a great deal of the jelly kind. The jelly part lies about the jaw-bones, and the firm parts within the head. Some are fond of the palate, and others the tongue, which likewise may be got by putting a spoon into the mouth. Edgehone of Beef.—Cut oft' a slice an inch thick all the length from a to h, in the figure opposite, and then help. The soft fat which resembles marrow lies at the back of the bone, below c; the firm fat must be cut in horizontal slices at the edge of the meat d. It is proper to ask which is preferred, as tastes dift'er. The skewer that keeps the meat properly together when boiling, is here shown at a. This should be drawn out before it is served up; or if it is necessai^ to leave the skewer in, put a silver one. Sirloin of Beif may be begun either at the cud, or byxlvii DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING. cutting into the middle. It is usual to inquire wliether the outside or the inside is preferred. For the outside, the slice should be cut down to the hones ; and the same with every following helping. Slice the inside likewise, and give with each piece some of the soft fat. The inside done as follows eats excellently : have ready some shalot-xdnegar boihng-hot j mince the meat large, and a good deal of the fat; sprinkle it with salt, and pour the shalot-vinegar and the gravy on it. Help with a spoon as quick as possible on hot plates. Round or Buttock of Beef is cut in the same way as fillet of veal in the next article. It should be kept even all over. When helping the fat, observe not to hack it, but cut it smooth. A deep slice should be cut off the beef before you begin to help, as directed above for the edge-bone. Fillet of Veal.—In an ox this part is round of beef. Ask whether the brown outside be liked, otherwise help the next slice. The bone is taken out, and the meat tied close, before dressing, which makes the fillet very solid. It should be cut thin and very smooth. A stuffing is put into the flap, which completely covers it; you must cut deep into this, and help a thin slice, as likewise of fat. From carelessness in not covering the latter with paper, it is sometimes dried up, to the great disappointment of the carver. Breast of Veal.—One part (whicli is called the bris- ket) is thicket, and has gristles; put your knife about four .inches from the edge of this, and cut through it, which will separate the ribs from the brisket. Ask which is chosen, and help accordingly. Calfs Head has a great deal of meat upon it, if pro-DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING. xlviii perly managed. Cut slices from a to b, in the figure opposite page xlvi., letting the knife go close to the bone. In the fleshy part, at the neck end c, there lies the throat sweetbread, which you should help a slice of from c to d with the other part. Many like the eye; which you must cut out with the point of your knife, and di\'ide in two. If the jaw-hone be taken off, there will be found some fine lean. Under the head is the palate, which is reckoned a nicety; the lady of the house should be acquainted with all things that are thought so, that she may distribute them among her guests. Shoulder of Midlon.—This is a very good joint, and by many preferred to the leg; it being very full of gravy, if properly roasted, and produces many nice bits. The figure represents it as laid in the dish with its back uppermost. When it is first cut it should be in the hollow part of it, in the direction of a, h, and the knife should be passed deep to the bone. The prime part of the fat lies on the outer edge, and is to be cut out in thin slices in the direction e. If many are at table, and the hollow part cut in the line a, b, is eaten, some very- good and delicate slices may be cut out on each side the ridge of the blade-bone in the direction c, d. The line between these two dotted lines is that in the direction of which the edge or ridge of the blade-bone lies, and can- not be cut across. Ley of Mutton.—A leg of wether mutton (which is tlie best flavoured) may be known by a round lump of fat at the edge of the broadest part, as at a. The best part is in the midway, at b, between the knuckle and fiirther end. Begin to help there by cutting thin deep slices to c. If the outside is not fat enough, help someDIRKCTIONS FOR CARVING. xlix from the side of the broad end in slices from e to /’. This part is most juicy; but many prefer the knuckle, which in fine mutton will be very tender thoug-h dry. There are very fine slices in the. back of the leg: turn it up, and cut the broad end; not in the direction you did the other side, but longwise. To cut out the cramp-bone, take hold of the shank with your left hand, and cut down to the thigh-bone at d; then pass the knife under the cramp-bone in the direction d, g. A fore Quarter of Lamb.—Separate the shoulder from the scoven (which is the breast and ribs), by pass- ing the knife under in the direction of a, b, c, d, in the figure opposite the last page; keeping it towards you horizontally, to prevent cutting the meat too much off the bones. If grass lamb, the shoulder being large, put it into another dish. Squeeze the juice of half a Seville orange (or lemon) on the other part, and sprinkle a little salt and pepper. Then separate the gristly part from the ribs in the line, e, c; and help either from that or from the ribs, as may be chosen. Haunch of Venison.—Cut down to the bone in the line a, b, c, in the figure opposite, to let out the gravy : then turn the broad end of the haunch towards you, put in the knife at b, and cut as deep as you can to the end of the haunch d; then help in thin slices, observing to give some fat to each person. There is more fat (which is a favourite part) on the left side of c and d than on the other; and those w'ho help must take care to jiro- portion it, as likewise the gravy, according to the num- ber of the company. Haunch of Mutton is the leg and part of the loin, (1DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING. 1 cut SO as to resemble haunch of venison, and is to be helped at table in the same manner. Saddle of Mutton.—Cut long thin slices from the tail to the end, beginning close to the back-bone. If a large joint, the slice may be divided. Cut some fat from the sides. Ham may be cut three ways ; the common method is, to begin in the middle, by long slices fi-om a to b, from the centre througli. the thick fat. This brings to the prime at first; which is likewise accomplished by cutting a small round hole on the top of the ham as at c, and with a sharp knife .enlarging that by cutting successive thin circles : this preserves the gravy, and keeps the meat moist. Tlie last and most saving way is, to begin at the hock end (which many are most fond of), and proceed on- wards. Ham that is used for pies, &c., should be cut from tlie under side, first taking off a thick slice. Slicking Pig.—The cook usually divides the body before it is sent to table, and garnishes the dish with the jaws and ears. The first thing is to separate a shoulder from the carcass on one side, and then the leg, according to the direction given by the dotted line a, h, c. The rilis are then to be divided into about two helpings ; and an ear or jaw presented with them, and plenty of sauce. Tlie joints may either be divided into two each, or pieces may lie cut from them. The ribs are reckoned the finest part; but some people prefer the neck end, between the shoulders. Goose.—Cut off the apron in the circular line a, b, c.li DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING. in the figure opposite the last page; and pour into the body a glass of port wine, and a large tea-spoonful of mustard, first mixed at the sideboard. Turn the neck end of the goose towards you, and cut the whole breast in long slices from one wing to another; but only remove them as you help each person, unless the company is so large as to recpiire the legs likewise. This way gives more prime hits than by making w’ings. Take off the leg by putting the fork into the small end of the bone, pressing it to the body, and, having passed the knife at d, turn the leg back, and, if a young bird, it will easily separate. To take off the wing, put your fork into the small end of the pinion, and press it close to the body ; then put in the knife at d, and divide the joint, taking it down in the direction c/, e. Nothing but practice will enable people to hit the joint exactly at the first trial. When the leg and wing of one side are done, go on to the other ; but it is not often necessary to cut up the whole goose, unless the company be very large. There are two side-bones, by the wing, which may be cut off; as like- wise the back and lower side-bones ; but the best pieces are the breast and the thighs, after being divided from the drum-sticks. Hare.—The best way of cutting it up is, to put thb point of the knife under the shoulder at a, in the figure opposite, and so cut all the way down to the rump, on one side of the back-bone, in the line a, b. Do the same on the other side, so that the whole hare will be divided into three parts. Cut the baek into four, which, with the legs, is the part most esteemed. The shoulder must lie cut off in a circular line, as c, (/, a: lay the pieces neatly on the dish as you cut (1 2DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING. lii them; and then help tlie company, giving some pudding and gravy to every person. This vay can only he practised when tlie hare is young : if old, do not divide it down, whieh will require a strong arm ; but put the knife between the leg and back and give it a little turn inwards at the joint; which you must endea- vour to hit, and not to break by force. When both legs are taken off, there is a fine collop on each side the hack ; then divide the hack into as many pieces as you jilease, and take off the shoulders, which are by many jireferred, and are called the sportsman’s pieces. ^Vhen every one is helped cut off' the head ; put your knife between the upper and lower jaw, and divide them, which will enable you to lay the upper fiat on your plate ; then put the point of the knife into the centre, and cut the head into two. The ears and brains may be helped then to those who like them. Carve Rabbits as directed the latter way for hare ; cutting the hack into two pieces, which, with the legs, are the prime. A Fold.—A boiled fowl’s legs are bent inwards, and tucked into the belly ; but, before it is served, the skewers are to he removed. Lay the fowl on your plate ; and place the joints, as cut off', on the dish. Take the wing off' in the direetion of a to b, in the annexed engraving, only dividing the joint with your knife ; and then with j^our i'ork lift up the ])inion, and draw the wings towards the legs, and the muscles will separate in a more com- ])lete form than if cut. Slip the knife between the leg and body, and cut to the hone ; then with the fork turn the leg hack, and the joint M ill give way it the bird is not old. ^\'hcn the four quarters arc thus removed.DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING. liii take off the merrythought from a, ami the neckhoiies ; these last by putting in tlie knife at c, and pressing it under the long broad part of the hone in tlie line c, l>; then lift it up, and break it oft’ from the part that stieks to the breast. The next thing is to divide the breast from the carcass, by cutting through the tender ribs close to the breast, quite down to the tail. Then lay the back upwards, put your knife into the bone half-way from the neck to the rump, and on raising tlie lower end it will separate readily. Turn the rump from you, and very neatly take off the two sidesmen, and the whole will be done. As each part is taken off, it should be turned neatly on the dish; and care should be taken that what is left goes properly from table. The breast and wings are looked upon as the best parts; but the legs are most juicy, in young fowls. After all, more advantage will be gained by observing those who carve well, and a little practice, than by any written directions whatever. A Pheasant.—The bird in the annexed engraving is as trussed for the spit, with its head under one of its wings. When the skewers arc taken out, and the bird served, the following is the way to carve it. Fix your fork in the centre of the breast; slice it down in the line a, h; take off' the leg on one side in the dotted line h, d; then cut off’ the wing on the same side in the line c, d. Separate the leg and wing on the other side, and then cut oft’ the slices of breast you divided before. Be careful how you take off the wings ; for if you should cut too near the neck as at you will hit on the neck bone, from which the wing must he separated. Cut off the merrythought in the line f, (j,DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING. liv by passing the knife under it towards the neck. Cut the other parts as in a fowl. The breast, wings, and merrythought are the most esteemed; but the leg has a high flavour. Partridgespartridge is here represented as just taken from the spit; but before it is served up, the skewers must be withdrawn. It is cut up in the same manner as a fowl. The wings must be taken otf in the line a, b, and the merrythought in the line c, d. The prime parts of a partridge are the wings, breast, and merrythought ■, but the bird being small, the two latter are not often divided. The wing is considered as the liest, and the tip of it is reckoned the most delicate morsel of the whole. Pigeons.—Cut them in half, either from top to bot- tom, or across. The lower part is generally thought the best; but the fairest way is to cut fr'om the neck to a, figure 7, rather than from c to h, by a, which is the most fashionable. The figure represents the back of the jiigeon; and the direction of the knife is in the line c, b, by{a, if done the last w'ay.Fl/itf 1i B' k 'V •r - r .•- ‘I 5 '“*'tS ■•i« ♦ • » M# <». ^•* ■V »■ » /' r 4 •■ c '1 AU.TIate m1FlMeW.FI.rltf V. i I > i I i 1 i ‘ I , : j1rhurvi. \1 'll 1r/dfrl'/f.Ti<itf miT P <1 K >• •I . ’ 7^- r • /■ \ 1 . r ■«» I u L r t li f i cricitc u h'li/iJut h>r Jjo/liiii/ LDOMESTIC COOKERY. PART I. FISH. To choose Fish. In every sort, stiffness, and redness of the gills, and brightness of the eyes, are invariable signs of freshness : thickness of flesh generally marks the good condition of all fish. Turbot shonld be thick, and the belly of a yellowish wl'iite: if of a bluish cast, or thin, they are bad. They are in season the greatest part of the summer. Salmon.—If new, and in season, the flesh is of a fine red, (the gills particularly,) the scales bright, and the whole fish stiff. When in greatest perfection, there is a whiteness between the flakes, which gives great firm- ness i by keeping, this melts down, and the fish is more rich. The Thames salmon bears the highest price; that caught in the Severn is next in goodness, and is even preferred by some. Small heads and thick in the neck are best. Cod.—The gills should be very red; the fish should be very thick at the neck, the flesh white and firm, and the eyes fresh. When flabby, they are not good. They are in season from the beginning of October till the end of April. Shale, if good, is very white and thick. If too fresh, they eat tough, but must not be kept above two days. B2 DOMESTIC COOKEIIY. Herrings.—If good, their gills are of a fine red, and the eyes bright; as is likewise the whole fish, which must be stiff and firm. Choose sprats by the same rules. Soles.—If good, they are thick, and the belly is of a cream-colour : if this is of a bluish cast and flabby, they are not fresh. They are in the market almost the whole year, but are in the highest perfection about Mid- summer. Whitings.—The firmness of the body and fins is to he looked to, as in herrings; their high season is during the first three months of the year, hut they may he had during a great part of it. Mackarel.—Choose as whitings. Their season is May, June, and July. They are so tender a fish, that they carry and keep worse than any other. Pike.—For freshness observe the above marks. The best are taken in rivers : they are a very dry fish, and are much indebted to stuffing and sauce. Carp live some time out of water, and may therefore get wasted: it is best to kill them as soon as caught, to prevent this; hut if too many are taken from the stew for present use, they may he fed with bread and kept in a large tub. The same signs of freshness attend them as other fish. Tench.—They are a fine-flavoured fresh-water fish, aud shoidd he killed and dressed as soon as caught.— Wlien they are to he bought, examine whether the gills are red and hard to open, the eyes bright, and the body stiff. The tench has a slimy matter about it, the clear- ness and brightness of which show freshness. The season is July, August, and September. Perch.—Take the general rules given to distinguish the freshness of other fish. They are not so delicate as carp and tench. Smelts, if good, have a fine silvery hue, are very firm, and have a refreshing smell like cucumbers newly cut. —They arc caught in the Thames and some other large rivers. Mullets.—The sea are preferred to the river mullets^3 FISH. and the red to the grey. They should he very firm.— Their season is August. Gudgeons.—They are chosen by the same rules as other fish. They are taken in running streams; come in about Midsummer, and are to he had for five or six months. Trout and Qrarjling are excellent fish, and taken in running streams; but the latter is to be found in only a few counties. In season chiefly in the summer months. Eels.—There is a greater diflerence in the goodness of eels than of any other fish. The true silver-eel (so called from the bright colour of the belly) is caught in the Thames. The Dutch eels sold at Billingsgate are very bad; those taken in great floods are generally good, but those in ponds have usually a strong, rank flavour. Except the middle of summer, they are always in season. Flounders.—They should be thick, firm, and have their eyes bright. They very soon become flabby and bad. They are both sea and river fish. The Thames produces the best. They are in season from January to March, and from July to September. Lobsters.—If they have not been long taken, the claws will have a strong motion when you put your finger on the eyes and press them. The heaviest are the best, and it is preferable to boil them at home. When you buy them ready boiled, try whether their tails are stiff, and pull up with a spring; if otherwise, they are not fresh. The cock-lobster is known by the narrow back part of his tail, and the two uppermost fins within it are stiff and hard; but those of the hen are soft, and the tail broader. The male, though generally smaller, has the highest flavour, the flesh is firmer, and the colour when boiled is a deeper red. Crabs.—The heaviest are best, and those of a mid- dling size are sweetest. If light, they are watery: when in perfection, the joints of the legs are stiff', and the body has a very agreeable smell. The eyes look dead and loose when stale.4 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Praxons and Shrimps.—When fresh they have a sweet flavour, are firm and stiff, and the colour is bright. Oysters.—There are several kinds; the Pyfleet, Col- chester, and Milford are much the best. The native Milton are fine, being white and fat; but others may be made to possess both these qualities in some degree by proper feeding. When the fish is alive and strong, the shell closes on the knife. They should be eaten as opened, the flavour becoming poor otherwise. The rock oyster is largest, but usually has a coarse flavour if eaten raw. OBSERVATIONS ON DRESSING FISH. If the fishmonger does not clean it, fish is seldom very nicely done. Common cooks are apt not to slit the fish low enough, by which, and not thoroughly washing the blood, &c., from the bone, a very disgusting mass is left within, and mistaken for liver; but fishmongers in great towns wash it beyond what is necessary for cleaning, and by perpetual watering diminish the flavour. Salt should be put into the w’ater in which all fish is boiled; and cod is rendered firmer by the addition of two or three spoonsful of vinegar. Cod, haddock, and whiting eat firmer if a little salt be put into their gills, and they be hung up a few hours before dressing. Care must be taken to preserve the roe, melt, and liver whole; to let them be sufficiently dressed; and to place them conspicuously when served. The sound ad- hering to the bone must be left there, but very carefully cleaned. Fish that is to be boiled must be put on the fire in cold hard water: when it boils, skim with the greatest care; throw in a little cup of cold water to check the extreme of heat, then keep it simmering only, lest the outside break before the thick and inner be done. The cover should be kept on the kettle, to ]irevent any dust or soot falling on the fish, the good colour of which is important. Crimped fish should be put into boiling water, and simmered a few minutes.5 FISH. To judge if a large fish be sufficiently boiled, draw up the fish-plate, and with a thin knife try if the fish easily divides from the bone in the thick parts, which it will when done enough. Keep it hot, not by letting it sod- den in the water, but by laying the fish-plate crossways on the kettle, and covering with a thick cloth. If left in the water after it is ready, fish loses its firmness, and becomes woolly. Serve fish on a napkin. The dish looks more complete if fried fish be served round the boiled, alternately placed with the roe or melt, and handsomely garnished. Observe, great care is necessary to drain the water from the boiled fish, that the dryness and colour of the fried around it may not be lessened. To fry Fish.—Having nicely cleaned and washed it, dry it completely : dip it in yolks of eggs beaten, and then in a dish of stale white bread-crumbs; if you wish it to look in the highest perfection, repeat the egg and crumbs, and instantly plunge it into a thick-bottomed frying-pan, in which have ready a sufficient quantity of dripping or lard, boiliny-hot, to cover the fish. Let it gently boil until it becomes a beautiful yellow brown, and is done enough; if the latter, before the colour be obtained, the pan must be drawn to a cooler part of the fire to finish. Turn a large dish upside down, lay a sheet of cap paper on it, and carefully place the fish upon it before the fire, and put another sheet over, that all the grease may be absorbed. The crumbs should ap- pear distinct. As the frying liquor must not be suffered to become black, it will serve again with a little fresh. But it gives a bad colour; oil is the best thing to fry in, if the expense be no objection. Frying-pans suited to the sizes of fish, and oblong instead of round, will be found particularly useful, as much waste of lard will be prevented. Fish will look better when fried, if, after cleaning and drying, they be floured, and laid some minutes before the fire to take off the damp. To broil Fish.—After cleaning and washing, dry it6 DOMESTIC COOKERY. well, and wrap it in a floured cloth. Season with salt and pepper ; flour, and put on a gridiron that is very clean, the bars of which, when hot, should he rubbed with a hit of suet, to prevent the fish from sticking. It must he broiled on a very clear fire, that it may not taste smoky; and not too near, that it may not he scorched. Fish being universally liked, the dressing and appear- ance of it, and the goodness of the sauces, demand great attention. The proper garnish is sliced lemon, pickled barberries, horse-radish, a fringe of crusted parsley, or crimped parsley. To crimp Parsley.—When washed and cleared of the large stalks, throw it again into clean water; make the dripping which fried the fish' boil up, and throw the parsley out of the water into the pan, and it will instantly crisp without losing its colour. Take it out with a slice, and let it stand before the fire a minute or two, while the fish is being dished. Those who know how to purchase fish may, by taking more at a time than they want for one day, often get it cheap ; and such kinds as will pot or pickle, or keep by being sprinkled with salt and hung up, or by being fried ■will serve for stewing the next day, may then be bought with advantage. Fresh-water fish has often a muddy smell and taste; to take off which, soak it in strong salt and water after- it is nicely cleaned : or if of a size to bear it, scald it in the same; then dry and dress it. To dress a Turtle. The night before dressing a turtle, hang it up by the hinder legs, and without giving time for it to draw in its neck, cut off its head. Early next moming have ready a boiler of hot watei'. With a sharp knife take off the fins next the head at the joint, which, if properly hit, will allow them to separate from the body without cut-. ting. The hinder fins, when cut at the joint, will, by a little twist, come uft’ immediately.FISH. 1 Next divide the callapash, or back shell, from the callapee, the belly shell, at about two inches round the latter, which is some of the prime of the turtle. Take out the entrails with particular care, lest the gall should be broken, and throw them into a tub of cold water: \vhen well washed, open the guts from end to end with a small penknife, and draw them through a woollen cloth often, to cleanse them, then put them in fresh cold water. The belly shell must be cut in pieces the size of the palm of the hand, and the lungs, kidneys, &c., cleared from the back shell: put the shells and fins into scalding water, until the scales can be scraped off with a knife, and all file meat can be taken clear off. Be sure to keep the different parts of the turtle separate, that they may be proportioned out afterwards. The green fat cut in pieces the size of an inch and a half square; simmer the fins, only in as much water as will cover them, till tender; then add the water, strained, to a quantity of very rich broth of veal, to which put a pound of butter rubbed down w ith as much fine flour as shall give due thickness; stir it over the fire ten minutes; having put in the entrails, cut in small pieces, six hours to stew before dinner; add to the soup green onions and all sorts of seasoning herbs,' chopped small; pepper, salt, and cayenne to your taste, not extremely hot, and the juice of one or two lemons, according to the size of the turtle, which, if fifty pounds’ weight, will require two bottles of madeira : let all this seasoning be simmered six hours, some of the coarse and white parts two hours, and a proportion of the green fat one hour. Put round the back shell a paste of flour and water about two inches high, to keep in the meat; then fill it three parts with the remainder of the coarse, the part that resembles veal, the green fat, &c., and some of the thin soup and additional seasoning ; bake it. To prepare small eggs for serving in the soup and shell, unless there be any in the turtle, see ‘ Little eggs for Turtle,’ under the head Sauces.8 DOMESTIC COOKERY. STURGEON. To dress fresh Sturgeon. Cut slices an inch thick, rub egg over them, then sprinkle with crumbs of bread, parsley, pepper, salt: fold them in paper, and broil gently. Sauce; liutter, anchovy, and soy. To roast Sturgeon. Put a piece on a lark-spit, then tie it on a large spit; haste it constantly with butter, and serve with a good brown gravy, an anchovy, a squeeze of Seville orange or lemon, and a glass of sherry boiled up, and poured into the dish. Another. Put a piece of butter, rolled in flour, into a stewpan, with four cloves, a bunch of sweet herbs, two onions, some pepper and salt, half a pint of water, and a glass of vinegar. Stir it over the fire till it boils; then let it become lukewarm, and steep the fish in it an hour or two. Butter a paper well, tie it round, and roast it without letting the spit run through. Serve with sorrel aud anchovy sauce. Three or four pounds of sturgeon would make a handsome dish. An excellent Imitation of pickled Sturgeon. Take a fine large turkey, but not old; pick it very nicely, singe, and make it extremely clean: bone and wash it, and tie it across and across ■with a bit of mat- string washed clean. Put into a very nice tin saucepan a quart of water, a quart of vinegar, a quart of white (but not sweet) wine, and a very large handful of salt; boil and skim it well. When become cold, put the turkey into the liquor, and simmer it very gently, closely covered, until it be quite ready; tighten the strings, and lay a dish with a weight of two pounds upon it. Boil the liquor half an hour; and when both are cold, put the turkey into it. This will keep some months, and eats more delicately than sturgeon ; vinegar, oil, and sugar, are usually eaten with it. If more vinegar or saltFISH. 9 should he wanted, add when cold. Send fennel over it to table. TURBOT. If necessary, turbot will keep a couple of days, or more, in perfection, if a very little salt be sprinkled over it, and it be hung in a very cool place. To boil Turbot, The turbot-kettle must be of a proper size, and in the nicest order. Set the fish in cold water sufficient to cover it completely, throw a handful of salt and a glass of vinegar into it, and let it gradually boil. When thick, the fish is apt to be unequally done; to prevent which, cut a slit down the back of two inches, close to the bone, and the same on the belly side, with a small sharp knife. Be very careful that there fall no blacks; but skim it well and preserve the beauty of the colour. Serve it garnished with a complete fringe of curled parsley, lemon and horse-radish. The sauce must be the finest lobster, anchovy butter, and plain butter, served plentifully in separate tm-eens. SALMON, To boil Salmon. Let it be put on in cold water, unless the fish be split; then in warm. If underdone it is very unwholesome. Shrimp or anchovy sauce. To broil Salmon. Cut slices an inch thick, and season with pepper and salt; lay each slice in white paper, well buttered, twist the ends of the paper, and broil the slices over a slow fire six or eight minutes. Serve in the paper with an- chovy sauce. To dry Salmon. Cut the fish down, take out the inside and roe. Rub the whole with common salt after scaling it; let it hang twenty-four hours to drain. Pound three or four ounces of saltpetre, according to the size of the fish, two ounces10 DOMESTIC COOKERY. of bay salt, and two ounces of coarse sugar; rub these, when mixed well, into the salmon, and lay it on a large dish or tray two days, then rub it well with common salt, and in twenty-four hours more it will be fit to dry : wipe it well after draining. Hang it either in a wood chimney, or in a dry place, keeping it open with two small sticks. Dried salmon is eaten broiled in paper, and only just warmed through; egg sauce and mashed potatoes with it; or it may be boiled, especially the bit next the head. To dress dried Salmon. Cut in slices, and broil in buttered paper. Egg sauce. If served at breakfast, omit the sauce. Some like it broiled wdthout paper; if so, a very few minutes will do it. An excellent Dish of dried Salmon. Pull some into flakes; have ready some eggs boiled hard and chopped large; put both into half a pint of thin cream, and two or three ounces of butter rubbed with a tea-spoonful of flour; skim it, and stir till boiling- ^lot; make a wall of mashed potatoes round the inner edge of a dish, and pom’ the above into it. To pickle Salmon. Boil as before directed, take the fish out, and boil the hquor with bay-leaves, peppercorns and salt: add vine- gar, -when cold, and pour it over the fish. Another way. After scaling and cleaning, split the salmon, and divide it into such pieces as you choose, lay it in the kettle to fill the bottom, and as much water as will cover it; to three quarts put a pint of vinegar, a handful of salt, twelve bay-leaves, six blades of mace, and a quar- ter of an ounce of black pepper. When the salmon is boiled enough, drain it and put it on a clean cloth, then put more salmon into the kettle, and ]iour the liquor upon it, and so on till all is done. After this, if the pickle be not smartly flavoured with tlie vinegar and salt, add more, and boil it quick three-quarters of an hour. When all is cold, pack the fish in somethingFISH. 11 deep, and let there be enough of pickle to plentifully cover. Preserve it from the air. The liquor must be drained from the fish, and occasionally boiled and skimmed. An easy way to pickle a piece of Salmon already boiled. To some of the liquor in which it was dressed add a fourth part of vinegar, four bay-leaves, a dessert-spoon- ful of black peppercorns, and some salt; boil it half an hour, and pour it cold over the fish, which should not be eaten under four days. In many parts of Wales, salmon is cleaned and boiled as soon as caught, and sent up cold. It is extremely good, eaten with pepper and vinegar. To pot Salmon. Take a large piece, scale and wipe, but do not wash it; salt very well, let it lie till the salt is melted and drained from it, then season with beaten mace, cloves, and whole pepper; lay in a few bay-leaves, put it close into a pan, cover it over with butter, and bake it; when well done, drain it from the gravy, put it into the pots to keep, and when cold, cover it with clarified butter. In this manner any firm fish may be done. Collared Salmon. Split such a part of the fish as may be sufficient to make a handsome roll, wash and wipe it, and having mixed salt, white pepper, pounded mace, and Jamaica pepper, in quantity to season it very high, rub it inside and out well. Then roll it tight and bandage it, put as much water and one-third vinegar as will cover it, with bay-leaves, salt, and both sorts of pepi>er. Cover close, and simmer till done enough. Drain and boil quick the liquor, and put on when cold. Serve with fennel. Itis- an elegant dish, and extremely good. COD. Some people boil the w’hole fish at once ; but a large head and shoulders contain all the fish that is proper to help, the thinner parts being overdone and tasteless12 DOMESTIC COOKERY. before the thick are ready. But the whole fish may he purchased at times more reasonably; and the Imver half, if sprinkled and hung up, will be in high perfection one or two days. Or it may be made salter and served with egg-sauce, potatoes and parsneps. Cod, when small, is usually very cheap. If boiled quite fresh it is watery; but eats excellently if salted and hung up for a day, to give it firmness, then stuffed, and broiled, or boiled. Cod's Head and Shoulders Will eat much finer by having a little salt rubbed down tlie bone, and along the thick part, even if it be eaten the same day. Tie it up, and put it on the fire in cold water w'hich will completely cover it; throw a handful of salt into it. Great care must be taken to serve it without the smallest speck of black or scum. Garnish with a large quantity of double parsley, lemon, horse- radish, and the milt, roe, and liver, and fried smelts if approved. If wdth smelts, be careful that no w'ater hangs about the fishj or the beauty of the smelts will be taken off, as well as their flavour. Serve with plenty of oyster or shrimp sauce, and anchovy butter. Crimped Cod. Boil or fry ; if the former, it must be put into boiling W'ater, and served like other boiled fish on a napkin. Stewed Cod. Lay two or three thick slices of cod in a pan, wdth half a pint of weak white wine (not siveet), six ounces of butter, some oysters and their liquor, three blades of mace, salt and pepper, and a few crumbs of bread; stew, and slightly thicken with flour before serving. Boiled Cod Sounds. Soak them in warm w'ater half an hour, then scrape and clean; and if to be dressed white, boil them in milk and water: when tender, serve them in a napkin, with egg-sauce. The salt must not be much soakedFISH. 13 out, unless for fricassee. Dress cod tongues in the same way. Cod Sounds to look like small Chickens. A good maigre-day dish. Wash three large sounds nicely, and boil in milk and water, but not too tender; when cold, put a forcemeat of chopped oysters, crumbs of bread, a bit of butter, nutmeg, pepper, salt, and the yolks of two eggs; spread it thin over the sounds, and roll up each in tlie form of a chicken, skewering it; then lard them as you Avould chickens, dust a little flour over, and roast them in a tin oven slowly. When done enough, pour over them a fine oyster-sauce. Serve for side or corner dish at the first course. To broil Cod Sounds. Scald in hot water, rub well Avitb salt, pull off the dirty skin, and put them to simmer till tender: take them out, flour and broil. AVhile this is doing, season a little brown gra^'y Avith pepper, salt, a tea-s])oonful of soy, and a little mustard: give it a boil Avith a bit of flour and butter, and pour it over the sounds. Cod Sou7ids Ragout. Prepare as above; then steAv them in Avhite gravy seasoned; cream, butter, and a little bit of flour added before you serve, gently boiling it up. A bit of lemon- peel, nutmeg, and the least pounded mace, should give the flavour. Scallops of Cod. Beat some cold cod Avith the yolk of an egg, a few shrimps, a little butter, salt, and pepper, fill the shells more than three parts, and streAV bread-crumbs over; then drip a little butter, Avarmed Avithout boiling. Currie of Cod Should be made of sliced cod, that has either been crimped or sprinkled a day to make it firm. Fry it of a fine brown, Avith sliced onions; and steAV it Avith a good Avhite gravy, a little currie-poAvder, a bit of butterDOMESTIC COOKERY. 14 and flour, three or four spoonsful of rich cream, salt, and cayenne, if the powder he not hot enough. To dress Salt Cod or Ling. Soak and clean the piece you mean to dress, then lay it all night in water, with a glass of vinegar. Boil it enough, then break it into flakes on the dish ; pour over it parsneps boiled, beaten in a mortar, and then boil up with cream and a large piece of butter rubbed with a bit of flour. It may be served as above ivith egg-sauce instead of the parsnep, and the root sent up whole; or the fish may be boiled and sent up without flaking, and sauces as above. Cod that has been dressed eats well done like dried salmon, with eggs, cream, &c. To dress Salt Fish that has been boiled; an excellent dish. Break it into flakes, and put it into a pan wdth sauce thus made : beat boiled parsneps in a mortar, then add to it a cup of cream, and a good piece of butter rolled in flour, a little white pepper, and half a tea-spoonful of mustard, all boiled together; keep the fish no longer on the fire than to become hot, but not boil. SOLES. If boiled, they must be served with great care, to look perfectly white, and should be much covered with parsley. The roe or melt of soles must not be taken out. If to he fried, see p. 5. Soles that have been fried eat good cold with oil, vinegar, salt, and mustard; or cut into large dice, in a bowl with salad. Or they are fit for stewing; to do which, see Stewed Carp, p. 22. Soles another leaij. Take two or three soles, divide them from the baek- bone, and take off the head, fins, and tail. Sprinkle the inside with salt, roll them up tight from the tail-end upwards, and fasten with small skewers. If large or middling, put half a fish in each roll; small do notFISH. 15 answer. Dip them into yolks of eggs, and cover them with crumbs. Do the egg over them again, and then put more crumbs; and fry them a beautiful colour in lard, or for fast-day, in clarified butter. Garnish with dried or fried parsley. Shrimp-sauce. Soles in the Portuguese way. Take one large, or two small: if large, cut the fish in two •, if small they need only be split. The bones being taken out, put the fish into a pan with a bit of butter and some lemon-juice ■, give it a fry, then lay the fish on a dish, and spread a forcemeat over each piece and roll it round, fastening the roll with a few small skewers. Lay the rolls into a small earthen pan, beat an egg and wet them, then strew crumbs over; and put the remain- der of the egg, with a little meat gravy, a spoonful of caper-liquor, an anchovy chopped fine, and some parsley chopped, into the bottom of the pan; cover it close, and bake in a slow oven till the fish are done enough. Then place the rolls in a dish for serving, and cover it to keep them hot till the baked gravy is skimmed; if not enough, a little fresh, flavoured as above, must be prepared and added to it. The heads of the fish are to be left on one side of the split part, and kept on the outer side of the roll; and when served the heads are to be turned towards each other in the dish. Garnish with fried or dried parsley. The Stuffing for the above. Pound cold beef, mutton, or veal, a little; then add some fat bacon that has been lightly fried, cut small, some onion, a little garlic or shalot, parsley, anchovy, pepper, salt, and nutmeg ; pound all fine with a few crumbs, and bind it with two or three yolks of eggs. MACKEREL. Boil and serve with butter and fennel. To broil them, split and sprinkle with herbs, pepper.i6 DOMESTIC COOKERY. and salt; or stuff with the same, crumbs and chopped fennel. Collared, as Eel, p. 24. Potted; clean, season, and bake them in a pan with spice, bay-leaves, and some butter; when cold, lay them in a potting pot, and cover with butter. Pickled : boil them, then boil some of the liquor, a few peppers, hay-leaves, and some vinegar; when cold, pour it over them. Pickled Mackerel called Caveach. Clean and divide them ; then cut each side into tlu-ee, or, leaving them undivided, cut each side into five or six pieces. To six large mackerel, take near an ounce of pepper, two nutmegs, a little mace, four cloves, and a handful of salt, all in the finest powder ; mix, and making holes in each bit of fish, thrust the seasoning into them, rub each piece with some of it; then fry them brown in oil; let them stand till cold, then put them into a stone jar, and cover with vinegar ; if to keep long, pour oil on the top. Thus done, they may be preserved for months. HADDOCK. Sprinkle with salt a few hours, and boil or broil, with or withont the following stuffing :— Take equal parts of fat bacon, beef suet, and fresh butter, some parsley, thyme, and savoury; a little onion, and a few leaves of scented marjoram shred fine; an anchovy or two ; a little salt and nutmeg, and some pep- per. Oysters will be an improvement, with or without anchovies; add crumbs, and an egg to bind. To stew Haddock. Take off the heads and fins, when well washed, and, with an onion, some sweet herbs, whole pepper, a spoon- ful or two of vinegar, and some water, make a gravy, which, when done, pour on the haddocks cut in large ])ieces, having previously sewed up in each a stuffing made as follows ;—boil the livers, and mix with ciTunbsFISH. n of bread, an anchovy, suet, cayenne, salt, nutmeg, and a shalot minced; bind it with an egg. Stew the fish slowly until done enough, then thicken the gravy with a large piece of butter rolled in flour, and put to it one spoonful of mushroom ketchup. To dry Haddock. Choose them of two or three pounds weight: take out the gills, eyes, and entrails, and remove the blood from the back-bone. Wipe them dry, and put some salt into the bodies and eyes. Lay them on a board for a night; then hang them up in a dry place, and after three or four days they will be fit to eat; skin and rub them with egg, and strew crumbs over them. Lay them before the fire, and baste with butter until brown enough. Serve with egg-sauce. Whitings, if large, are excellent this way; and it will prove an accommodation in the country, where there is no regular supply of fish. To cure Finnan Haddock. Choose those that are of a middling size, and as fresh as possible; take off their heads, split up, wipe nicely, and sprinkle lightly with salt. Lay them with a mode- rate heat upon them for twelve hours, then hang them up to drain three hours, and then tie them, two and two, on a string, and suspend,them over some peats that have been so much burnt as not to smoke strongly, and at a dis- tance that may not heat the fish, which, thus smoked two hours, will be fit for use. They are served at breakfast in Scotland to eat with bread and butter, either cold or just warmed through, and moistened with one or two drops of sweet oil. The Scotch dish, called Cropped Heads, Parboil the roe of haddocks or cod; mix it with double its quantity of pounded hard biscuit, salt, pepper, and a beaten egg; stufl’ haddocks’ heads with this mi.x- ture, and fry them in beef dripping. Prepare a sauce of beef gravy, added to fried onions and flour, a tea' cBOMESTIC COOKERY. IS cupful of ketchup, the same of pickled mussels, and add' to the heads; simmer fifteen minutes. If a larger dish be wanting, serve two boiled haddocks in the middle. ' - Tliornhack and Skate Should be hung one day at least before they are dressed; and may be served either boiled, or fried in crumbs, being first dipped in egg. Crimped Skate. Boil and send up in a napkin; or fry as above. 31aids Should likewise be hung up one day at least. They maybe broiled or fried; or if of a tolerable size, the' middle may be boiled, and the fins fried. They should be dipped in egg, and covered with crumbs. Red 3Iullet. It is called the sea-woodcock. Clean, but do not open or wash the inside, fold in oil-paper, and gently bake in a small dish. iNIake a sauce of the liquor that comes frorh the fish, with a piece of butter, a little flour, a little essence of anchovy, and a glass of sherry. Give it a boil; and serve in a boat, a;nd the fish in the paper-case it was dressed in. FLOUNDERS. Let them be rubbed with salt inside and out, and lie: two hours to give them some firmness. Boil, if so chosen ; but they are better fried, for which observe the. usual directions. Serve garnished with fried parsley. Sauce, anchovy and butter. Wafer Souchij. Stew two or three flounders, some parsley leaves and roots, thirty peppercorns, and a quart of water, till the fish are boiled to pieces; pulp them through a sieve. > Set over the fire the ])ulpecl fish, the liquor that boiled them,: some perch, tench, or flounders, and some fresh leaves and roots of parsley; simmer all till done enough.19 FISH. then serve in a deep dish. Slices of bread and butter are to be sent to table to eat with the Souchy. An excellent ivay of dressing a large Plaice, especially if there be a roe. Sprinkle with salt, and keep twenty-four hours; then wash and wipe it dry, wet over with egg, cover Avith crumbs of bread ; make some lard of fine dripping, and tw'o large spoonsful of vinegar, boiling hot; lay the fish in, and fry it a fine colour, drain it from the fat, and serve it with fried parsley round, and anchovy-sauce. You may dip the fish in vinegar, and not put it into the pan. HERRINGS AND SPRATS. To smoke Herrings. Clean, and lay them in salt with a little saltpetre one night; then hang them on a stick, through the eyes, in a row. Have ready an old cask, in w'hich put some sawdust, and in the midst of it a heater red-hot; fix the stick over the smoke, and let them remain twenty-four hours. Fried Herrings. Serve them of a light brown, Avith onions sliced and fried round them; or Avithout onions. Broiled Herrings. Flour them first, and do of a good colour; plain butter for sauce. Potted Herrings which much resemble Char. "When in high season, choose a dozen of the finest heiTings, clean and remove every scale: Avash them twice over, drying them Avith fresh cloths each time. Rub into them, in fine powder, one ounce of Jamaica pepper, ditto saltpetre, ditto common salt; lay them on a board, Avhich raise on one side a little, that the fish mav drain for twelve hours. Then, Avith clean cloths, Avipe off the spice and salt, and season Avitli the folloAving-, in the finest poAvdcr: forty-eight cloves, tAvelve large c 2DOMESTIC COOKERY. 20 blades of mace, two large nutmegs, a quarter of an ounce of pepper, and an ounce of common salt. As you season each, lay it in an earthen pan as nearly fitted to hold the herrings as possible. Lay over them a pound of butter, cover with a white and several brown papers; tie down close, and bake three hours in a moderately- quick oven. When a little cooled, drain the liquor from the fish, and lay them round a pottiug-pot or char-pan, the backs upwards, as close as they will lie without breaking, and finish packing them in the centre. Take the bowl of a large spoon, and smooth the sirrface, that there may not be cavities to absorb the butter, which must not be put on till the following day; then let it be half an inch thick. The gravy makes the finest addition to soups, or made dishes, in small proportions. The head should lie over the fish when baked. Her- rings thus dressed, and served in the hot gravy, make a dish of the finest flavour imaginable. Herrings are very good jrotted like mackerel. See p. 16. To dress Red Herrings. Choose them that are large and moist, cut them open, 'and pour some boiling small beer over them to soak half an hour ; drain them dry, and make them just hot through before the fire, then rub some cold butter over them, and serve. Egg-sauce, or buttered eggs, and mashed potatoes should be sent rq:> with them. Instead of butter, a little sweet oil will add to the richness, but it must be dropped on while before the fire, and in the smallest quantity. Baked Herrings and Sprats. Wash and drain without wiping them; season with allspice in fine powder, salt, and a few whole cloves; lay them in a pan with plenty of black pepper, an onion, and a few bay-leaves. Add half vinegar and half small beer enough to cover them. Put paper over the pan, and bake in a slow oven. If you like, throw saltpetre over them the night before, to make them look red. Gut, but do not open them.21 USH. To broil Sprats. When cleaned, they should be fastened in rows by a skewer run through the heads, and then broiled, and served hot and hot. To fry Smelts. They should not be washed more than is necessary to clean them. Dry them in a cloth; then lightly flour them, but shake it off. Dip them into plenty of egg, then into bread-crumbs grated fine, and plunge them into a good pan of boiling lard; let them continue gently boiling, and a few minutes will make them a bright yellow-brown. Take care not to take oft’ the light roughness of the crumbs, or their beauty will be lost. To dress Pipers. Boil or bake them with a pudding well seasoned.—If baked, put a large cup of rich broth into the dish; and when done, take that, some essence of anchovy, and a squeeze of lemon, and boil them up together for sauce. To dress Pike. Scale it, and open as near the throat as you can, and, after well cleaning, stuff it with the following; grated bread, herbs, anchovies, oysters, suet, salt, pepper, mace, half a pint of cream, four yolks of eggs; mix all over the fire till it thickens, then put it into the fish, and sew it up. Boil or bake; if the latter, bits of butter should be put over it, and half a pint of rich broth in the dish ; and, when the fish is ready, take the gravy out of the dish, add a dessert-spoonful of essence of anchovy, the same of soy, and a squeeze of lemon, to some butter rolled in flour, and boiling it up, pour into the dish. Note.—If, in helping a pike, the back and belly are slit up and each slice gently drawn downwards, there will be fewer bones given. Boiled Carp. Serve on a napkin, with the sauce which you will find directed for it under the following article..DOMESTIC COOKERY. 22 Stewed Carp, Scale and clean, take care of the roe, &c. Lay the fish in a stewpan, with a rich beef-gravy, an onion, eight cloves, a dessert-spoonful of Jamaica pepper, the same of black, a fourth part of the quantity of gravy, of port (cider may do); simmer close covered; when nearly done, add two anchovies chopped fine, a dessert- spoonful of made mustard, some fine walnut ketchup, and a bit of butter rolled in flour : shake it, and let the gravy boil a few minutes, then add a spoonful of soy. Serve with sippets of fried bread, the roe fried, and a good deal of horse-radisb and lemon. Baked Carp, Clean a large carp : put stuffing as for soles, dressed in the Portuguese w'ay. Sew it up; brush it all over with yolk of egg, and put plenty of crumbs; then drop oiled butter over to baste it; place the carp in a deep earthen dish, a pint of stock (or, if fast-day, fish-stock), a few sliced onions, some bay-leaves, a faggot of herbs (such as basil, thyme, parsley, and both sorts of marjo- ram, and treble the quantity of parsley), half a pint of port wine, and six anchovies. Cover over the pan, and bake it an hour. Let it be done before it is wanted. Pour the liquor from it, and keep the fish hot while you heat up the liquor with a good piece of butter rolled in flour, a tea-spoonful of made mustard, a little cayenne, and a spoonful of soy. Serve the fish on the dish, gar- nished with lemon, parsley, horse-radish, and the milt or roe, and put the gravy into the sauce-tureen. Perch and Tench. Put them into cold water, boil them carefully, and serve with melted butter and soy. Perch are most deli- cate fish. They may be either fried or stewed, but in stewing they do not preserve so good -a flavour. Tivut and. Grayling May be either boiled or fried. Scale, gut, and well wash; then dry them, and lay them separately on a2S FISH. board before the fire. . If for frying, they must be floured. Serve with crimped parsley and plain butter. Perch and Tench may be done the same way. Trout a-la-Genevois. Clean the fish very well; put it into your stewpai^, adding half champaigue and half moselle, or rhenish, or sherry wine. Season it with pepper, salt, an onion, a few cloves stuck in it, and a small bunch of parsley and thyme : put in it a crust of French bread; set it on a quick fire. When the fish is done take the bread Out, bruise it, and then thicken the sauce; add flour and a little butter, and let it boil up. See that your sauce is of a proper tliickness. Lay your fish on tlie dish, and •pour the sauce over it. Serve it with sliced lemon and fried bread, Char, At a distance from the lakes where caught, is only eaten potted’ the process of which is the same that is given to pot herrings; but the proportion of butter for the former is eight pounds to every dozen of fish ; they are longer baked, and the proportion of mace rather greater. Char fried is delicious, as is also another Al- pine fish, called gwyniad, caught in the lake of Bala, in North Wales. EELS. Spitchcock EeU. Take one or two large eels, leave the skin on, cut ■them into pieces three inches long, open ’them on the belly-side, and clean them nicely : wipe them dry, and then wet them with beaten egg, and strew over on both sides chopped parsley, pepper, salt, a very little sage, ‘and a bit of mace pounded fine and mi,\ed with the sea- soning. Rub the gridiron with suet, and broil the fish •of a fine colour. • Serve with anchovy and butter for sauce.24 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Fried Eels. If small, they should be curled round and fried, being first dipped into egg and crumbs of bread. Boiled Eels. The small ones are best this way: simmer them in a small quantity of water, with a good deal of parsley, which should be served up with them and the liquor. Serve chopped parsley and butter for sauce. Eel Broth, verxj nourishing for the Sick. Do as above; but stew two hours, and add an onion and peppercorns : salt to taste. Collared Eel. Bone a large eel, but do not skin it: mix pepper, salt, mace, allspice, and a clove or tw'o, in the finest powder, and rub over the whole inside; roll it tight, and bind with a coarse tape. Boil it in salt and water, and two bay-leaves, till enough, then add vinegar, and when cold, keep the collar in pickle. Serve it either whole or in slices. Chopped sage, parsley, and a little thyme, knotted marjoram, and savory, mixed with the spices, greatly improve the taste. Eels stewed as carp are a very fine dish. To stew Lamprey, as at Worcester. After cleaning the fish carefully, remove the cartilage which runs down the back, and season with a small quantity of cloves, mace, nutmeg, pepper, and allspice ; put it into a small stewpot, with as much strong beef, gravy, and madeira or sherry, in equal quantities, as will cover it. Cover close: stew till tender, then take out the lamprey and keep hot, while you boil up the liquor with two or three anchovies chopped, and some flour and butter; strain the gravy through a sieve, and add lemon-juice, and some made mustard. Serve with sippets of bread and horse-radish. When there is sjiawn, it must be fried and put round. Note.—Cider will do in common instead of white wine.25 FISH. To pot Lamprey, as at Worcester. Leave the skin on, but remove the cartilage and a string on each side of it down the back. Wash and clean the fish very nicely in several waters, and wipe them. To a dozen of tolerable size use two ounces of white pepper, salt in proportion, six blades of mace, a dozen of cloves, all in fine powder, but do not season until the fish shall have drained all night. Lay them in a stone pot one hy one, and curled round; the spices and salt being sprinkled in and about them. Clarify two pounds of butter, and half a pound of the finest beef-suet, pour it on the fish, and lay thick paper over to keep in the steam. Bake three hours in a moderate oven. Look often at them, and as the oil works up, take it clear off. They will thus, in the storepot, keep till spring. Put into pots for serving as wanted ; observing to take off the old butter, and having warmed the fish in the oven, cover with fresh butter only. Excellent Fish Cake. Hieres en Provence. Take any sort of dressed fish (the remains of a turbot do well), cut the meat from the hones, put them, the head and fins, over the fire, with a pint of water, an onion, herbs, pepper, and salt to stew for gravy. Mince the meat, put to it a third part of crumbs of bread, a little minced onion, parsley, pepper, salt, and the least bit of mace: mix well, and make it into a cake with white of an egg, and a little melted hutter; cover it with raspings; and fry it a pale brown, keeping a plate on the top while doing. Then lay it in a stewpan, with the fish gravy, and stew it gently a quarter of an hour; turn it twice, but with great care not to break it: cover it closely r while stewing. I Cake of dressed meat, done in the same way, is re- ) markably good. || Court Bouillon, in which any kind of fresh Fish may ^ he done. I Choose a kettle that will only suit the size of the fish, s'26 DOMESTIC COOKERY. into which put two parts water, one of light, not sweet, white wine, a good piece of butter, some stewed onions and carrots, pepper, salt, two or three cloves, and a good hunch of sweet herbs; simmer a quarter of an hour, let it become cold, then boil the fish therein. Serve with an- chovy-sauce, and a squeeze of lemon. I.OBSTERS, SHRIMPS, AND CRAY-FISH. To pot Lobsters. Half boil them, pick out the meat, cut it into small hits, season with mace, white pepper, nutmeg, and salt, press close into a pot, and cover with butter; bake half an hour; put the spawn in. When cold, take the lobster out, and put it into the pots, with a little of the button Beat the other butter in a mortar, with some of the spawn; then mix that coloured butter with as much as will be sufficient to cover the pots, and strain it. Cay- enne may be added, if approved. Another ivay to pot Lobsters, as at Wood’s HoteL Half boil; take out the meat as whole as you cau; split the tail and remove the gut; if the inside be not watery, add it. Season with mace, nutmeg, white pep- per, salt, and a clove or two, in the finest powder. Lay a little fine butter at the bottom of the pan, and the lob- ster smooth over it, with bay-leaves between; cover it with butter, and bake gently. When done, pour the whole on the bottom of a sieve, and with a fork lay the pieces into potting-pots, some of each sort, with the sea- soning about it. When cold, pour clarified butter over, but not hot. It will be ready for eating next day ; and if highly-seasoned, and thick-covered with butter, will •keep some time. Potted lobster may be eaten cold, or as a fricassee, with cream-sauce: it then looks very nicely, and eats excellently, especially if there is sjiawn. Mackerel, Herrings, and Trout, are good potted as •nbove.FISH. 21 Stewed Lobsters, a very hiyh relish. Pick the lobster, put the berries into a dish that has a lamp, and rub them down with a bit of butter, two spoonsfiil of any sort of gravy, one of soy, or walnut- ketchup, a little salt and cayenne, and a spoonful of port •, stew the lobster cut into bits with the gravy as above. Lobster Pudding. Divide the body in two, and having cleared the back shell, and dressed the meat of the whole' as for patties, lay it in the shell hot, cover with crumbs of bread, and brown with a salamander. If the lobsters be small, use two. Rissoles of Lobster. Chop the flesh of a large lobster, or two small ones, and mix with it a very little lemon-peel, pepper, salt, nutmeg, or mace, a little butter, cream, ^.nd a very few crumbs of stale bread. Roll the mass, and cover it in small quantities, the size of sausages, with a light puff’ paste. Rub them over with the finest yolk of egg, and dip them in the finest crumbs of bread. Fry a fine yel- low brown, and serve them with crisped parsley. Buttered Lobsters. Pick the meat out, cut it, and warm with a little weak brown gravy, nutmeg, salt,’’ pepper, and butter, with a little flour. If done white, a little white gravy and cream. To roast Lobsters. ‘When half boiled, and while hot, rub the shell with 'butter, and lay it before the fire. Continue basting it with butter till it has a fine froth. Melted Rutter, cay- enne, and salt, are eaten with the above. Currie of Lobsters or Praions. Scald, and take them from the shells, and lay into a pan with a small piece of mace, three or four spoonsful of veal gravy, and four of cream; rub smooth one or28 DOMESTIC COOKERY. two tea-spoonsful of cunie-powder, a tea-spoonful of flour, and an ounce of butter : simmer an hour; squeeze half a lemon in, and add salt. Prawns and Cray-fish in jelly, a beautiful dish Make a savoury fish-jelly, and put some into the bot- tom of a deep small dish; when cold, lay the cray-fish upon it with their backs downwards, and pour more jelly over them. Turn out when cold. To butter Prawns and Shrimps. Take them out of the shells, and warm them wdth a little good gravy, a bit of butter and flour, a scrape of nutmeg, salt, and pepper; simmer a minute or two, stirring the w'hile, and serve with sippets; or with a cream-sauce instead of brown. To pot Shrimps. When boiled, take them out of their shells, and season them with salt, white pepper, and a very little mace and cloves. Press them into a pot, lay a little butter over them, and bake in a slow oven for ten minutes. When cold, cover with clarified butter. CRABS. Hot Crab. Pick the meat out of a crab, clear the shell from the head, then put the meat with a little nutmeg, salt, pep- per, a bit of butter, crumbs of bread, and three spoons- ful of vinegar, into the shell again, and set before the fire. You may brow'ii it with a salamander. Dry toast should be served to eat it upon. Observe to remove the lady, as it is called. Dressed Crab cold. Empty the shells, and mix the flesh with oil, vinegar, salt, and a little white pepper and cayenne; then put the mixture into a large shell, and serve. Very little oil is necessary.29 FISH, OYSTERS. To feed Oysters. Put them into water, and wash them wdth a birch besom till quite clean; then lay them bottom downwards into a pan, sprinkle with flour or oatmeal and salt, and cover with water. Do the same every day, and they will soon fatten. The water should be pretty salt. To steio Oysters, Open, and separate the liquor from them, then wash them from the grit: strain the liquor and put with the oysters a bit of mace and lemon-peel, and a few white peppers. Simmer them very gently, and put some cream, and a little flour and butter. Serve with sippets. The beards should be removed. They require a very few minutes. Boiled Oysters Eat well. Let the shells be nicely cleaned first, and serve in them, to eat with cold butter. To scollop Oysters. Put them with crumbs of bread, pepper, salt, nutmeg, and a bit of butter, into scollop-shells, or saucers ; put bits of butter over, and bake before the fire in a Dutch oven. Oyster Fritters. Do in the foregoing way, but the oysters must he of a choice sort, and served as a small dish by themselves. Fried Oysters, to garnish boiled Fish. Make a batter of flour, milk, and eggs, season it a very little, dip the oysters into it, and fry them a fine yellow-brown. Take off the beards previously. A little nutmeg should be put into the seasoning, and a few crumbs of bread into the flour. Oyster Sauce.—See Sauces. Oyster Loaves. Open the oysters, and save the liquor; wash them in it; then strain it through a sieve, and put a little of it30. DOMESTIC. COOKERY. into a tosser, with a bit of butter and flour, white pepper, a scrape of nutmeg, and a little cream. Stew them, and cut in dice; put them into rolls sold for the purjiose, and made hot in the oven in readiness. Oyster Patties.—See Patties. To -pickle Oysters. Wash four dozen of the largest oysters you can get in ■ their own liquor, wipe them dr^, strain the liquor off, adding to it a dessert-spoonful of pepper, two blades of mace, a table-spoonful of salt (if the liquor be not very salt), three of white wine, and four of vinegar.—Simmer the oysters a few minutes in the liquor, then put them in small jars, and boil the pickle up, skim it, and when cold, pour over the oysters ; cover close. Another way to pickle Oysters. Open the number you intend to pickle, put them into a saucepan with their own liquor for ten minutes, simmer them very gently; then put them into a jar, one by one, that none of the grit may stick to them, and cover them, when cold, with the pickle thus made.—Boil tlie liquor AVith a bit of mace, lemon-peel, and black peppers, and to every hundred put two spoonsful of the best undistilled vinegar. They should be kept in small jars, and tied close with bladder, for the air will spoil them. Note.—Directions for making Fish Pies and Fish Soups will be found under their respective heads. PART II. MEATS. To choose Meats. Venison.—If the fat be clear, bright and thick, and the cleft of the haunch smooth and close, it.is young; but if the cleft is wide and tough, it is old. To judge of its sweetness, run a very sharp narrow knife into the shoulder or haunch, and you will know by the scent. Few people31; MEATS. like it when it has much of the haut-gout; but it bears keeping better than any sort of meat; and if eaten fresh killed, it is not so good as mutton. Beef.—If the flesh of ox-beef be good, it will have a fine smooth open grain, he of a good red, and feel ten- der. The fat should look white rather than yellow ; for; when that is of a deep colour, the meat is seldom good : beef fed by oil-cakes is in general so, and the flesh is flabby. The grain of cow-beef is closer, and the fat whiter than that of ox-beef; but the lean is not of so bright a red. The grain of bull-beef is coarser and closer still, the fat hard and skinny, the lean of a deep red, and it has a stronger scent. Ox-beef is the reverse. Ox-beef is the richest and largest; but in small families, and to some tastes, heifer-beef is preferred, if finely fed. In old meat, a streak of horn runs between the fat and lean of the sirloin and rihs : the harder this is the older • and the flesh is not finely-flavoured. Veal.—The flesh of a bull-calf is firmest, but not so vvhite. The fillet of the cow-calf is generally preferred for the udder. The whitest is not the most juicy, having., become so by frequent bleeding and licking chalk. Choose the meat of which the kidney is well covered with white thick fat. If the bloody vein in the shoulder looks blue, or of a bright red, it is newly killed ; but any other co- lour shows it to be stale. The other parts should be dry and white ; if clammy or spotted, the meat is stale and bad. The kidney turns first, and the suet will not then. he firm. Mutton.—Choose this by the fineness of its grain, good colour, and firm white fat. It is not the better for being young: for if of a good breed and well fed, it is better for age; but this only holds with wether mutton. The flesh of the ewe is paler, and the texture finer; but the meat is not so rich or well flavoured, nor is the gravy so fine. Ram-mutton is very strong flavoured, the flesh is of a deep red, and the fat is spongy.—Wether is dis- tinguished likewise by a knob of fat on the leg, where, in ewe mutton, is the udder.DOMESTIC COOKERY. 32 Lamb.—Observe the neck of a fore-quarter; if the vein is bluish, it is fresh; if it has a green or yellow cast it is stale. In the hind quarter, if there is a faint smell under the kidney, and the knuckle is limp, the meat is stale. If the eyes be sunk, the head is not fresh. , Grass lamb comes into season in April or May, and con- tinues till August, House-lamb may be had in great towns almost all the year, but is in highest perfection in December and January. Pork.—Pinch the lean, and if young it will break. If the rind is tough, thick, and cannot easily be impressed by the finger, it is old. A thin rind is a merit in all pork; and pigs that are short ^n the legs and bodies, and have thickness in the neck, and not long heads and ears, are always to be preferred. When fresh, the flesh will be smooth and dry; if clammy, it is tainted. What is called measly pork is very unwholesome, and may be known by the fat being full of kernels, which in good pork is never the case. Pork fed at still-houses does not answer for curing in any way, the fat being spongy. Dairy-pork is the best. Bacon.—If the rind be thin, the fat firm, and of a red tinge, the lean tender, of a good colour, and adhering to the bone, you may conclude it good and not old. If there are yellow streaks in it, it is becoming, if not already, rusty. Hams.—Stick a shaiqi knife under the bone; if it comes out with a pleasant smell, the ham is good; but if the knife is daubed and has a bad scent do not buy it. Hams short in the hock are best, and long-legged pigs are not to be chosen for any preparation of pork. Braion.—The homy part of the young brawn will feel moderately tender, and the flavour will be better than the old, the rind of which will be hard. Observations on purchasing, keeping, and dressing Meat. The flesh of cattle killed when not perfectly clear of food soon spoils. They should fast twenty-four hours inMEATS. 33 ■winter, and double tliat time in summer, before they arc killed. In every sort of provisions, the best of the kind goes farthest, cuts out to greatest advantage, and affords most nourishment. Round of beef, fdlet of veal, and leg of mutton, are joints that bear a higher price; but as they have more solid meat, they deserve the preference. It is ■worth notice, however, that those joints which are infe- rior may be dressed as palatably; and being cheaper they ought to be bought in turn; for when they are weighed with the prime pieces, the price of these is lower. In loins of meat, the long pipe that runs by the bone should be taken out, as it is apt to taint; as also the kernels of beef. Rumps and edgebones of beef are often bruised by the blows the drovers give the beasts, and the part that has been struck always taints ; there- fore do not purchase these joints if bruised. All meat should be carefully examined and wiped with a dry cloth as soon as it comes in; and if flies have blown upon it, the part must be cut off. This should be daily observed until it be dressed, as it not only tends to preserve the meat long in perfection, but prevents that musty flavour too often perceived in the outer slices, when brought to table. In the country, where meat is often carried a great distance, it should be well covered with a cloth, over which fresh cabbage-leaves would keep it cool. These cautions are more needful, as in some families great loss is sustained by the spoiling of meat. The fly may in some measure be prevented by dusting upon the parts most likely to be attacked pepper and ginger mixed, after loiping, which should never be omitted. Pieces of charcoal laid about meat preserve it from putrefaction, and recover what is spoiling. All legs and shoulders of meat should hang with the knuckle down- wards, which will cause the gravy to be retained. When sirloins of beef, or loins of veal or mutton, come in, part of the suet may be cut off for puddings, DDOMESTIC COOKERY. 34 or to clarify. If there be more suet than ■will be used ■while fresh, throw it into pickle, made in the ]>roportion of a quarter of a pound of salt to a quart of cold water, and it will he as good afterwards for any use, when soaked a little. Dripping, or clarified suet, will baste every thing as well as butter, except fowls and game; and for kitchen pies nothing else should be used. The fat of a neck or loin of mutton makes a far lighter and much richer pud- ding than suet. If the weather permit, meat eats much better for hanging a day before it is salted. Meats become more tender, and consequently more digestible, as well as better flavoured, by hanging ; but veal and lamb will not bear it so long as the flesh of older animals. All meats should he well washed, and cleaned with a brush kept for the purpose, before they are dressed. If for boiling, the colour wiU be better for soaking an hour or two; but if to be roasted, let it be dried, after washing. Boiling in a well-floured cloth will make meat white. Cloths for this jiurpose should be carefully washed, and boiled in clean water between each using, and not suf- fered to hang in a damp place, which would give a bad flavour to the meat. The same observe of tapes and pudding-cloths. All kitchen utensils should be kept in the nicest order, and in a conspicuous part of the oftices. Particular care must be taken that the pot is well skimmed the moment it boils, otherwise the foulness will be dispersed over the meat. The more soups or broth are skimmed, the better and cleaner they will be. Meats boiled quick will be hard. Vegetables should never be dressed with meat, except carrots or parsneps with boiled beef. The length of time for roasting and boiling must be determined by the size and solidity of the joint, the strength of the fire, and its nearness to it in roasting : in boiling, by the regular though slow progress it makes.35 MEATS. as well as by the above observations; for if the cook, when told to prevent the copper from boiling quick, lets it stop from boiling entirely, the usual time will be in- sufficient, and the meat will be underdone. The time must be reckoned from the instant when the water boils . . . Weigh the meat, and allow for all solid joints a quarter of an hour for every pound, and some minutes (from ten to twenty) over, according as the family like it done. A ham of twenty pounds will take four hours and a half, and others in proportion. Hams should be put into boiling water if not over dry, and only simmer the whole time. A tongue, if dry, takes four hours slow boiling, after soaking; a tongue, out of pickle, from two hours and a half to three hours, or more if very large; it must be judged by feeling whether it is very tender. A leg of pork or of lamb takes the allowance of twenty minutes, above a quarter of an hour to a pound. A neck of mutton will take an hour and a half, if kept at a proper distance. A chine of pork two hours. The meat should be put a good distance from the fire, and brought gradually nearer when the inner part be- comes hot, which will prevent its being scorched while yet raw. All meats should be much basted; when done, draw the spit very near to the fire, sprinkle with salt, and flour it well, that the meat may go up well frothed. Beef of ten pounds will take above two hours and a half; twenty pounds will take three hours and three- quarters. In roasting meat it is a very good way to put a little salt and water into the dripping-pan, and baste for a little while with this, before using its owm fat or dripping. When dry, dust it with flour, and baste as usual. Salting meat, when first put down, draws out the grav\\ Such as is not very fat should have some paper put over to preserve it.DOMESTIC COOKERY. 36 Old meats do not require so much dressing as youna;; not that they are sooner done, but they can be eaten with the gravy more in. In preparing meat for roasting, the cook must be careful that the spit be wiped before it is used, and at the time of serving, or its mark will appear in a black stain. She must avoid running the spit through the prime parts. In some joints, as necks, it may enter two bones from the end, run at the back until it comes to nearly the other end, and the prime of the meat will not be pierced. Leaden skewers of ditferent weights should be in readi- ness, for w^ant of which unskilful servants are often at a loss at the time of spitting. Cradle-spits answer best; they may be bought of different sizes. The joints of all necks and loins should be nicked before they are dressed. Time, distance, basting often, and a clear fire of a proper size for wdiat is required, are the first points of a good cook’s attention in roasting. A piece of writing-pajier should be twisted round the bone at the knuckle of a leg or shoulder of lamb, mutton, or venison, when roasted, before they are served. Meat and vegetables which the frost has touched should be soaked in cold water two or three hours before used, or more if they are much iced. Putting them to the fire, or into warm w’ater, till thawed, makes it impos- sible for any degree of heat to dress them afterwards. When you wish fried things to look as well as pos- sible, do them twice over with egg and crumbs. Bread that is not stale enough to grate quite fine will not look well. The fat you fry in must always be boiling-hot the moment the meat is put in, and kept so till finished; a small quantity never fries well. To keep meat hot.—It is best to take it up when done, though the company may not be come ; set the dish over a ])an of boiling rvater, put a deep tin cover over it so as not to touch the meat, and then throw a cloth over that. This w ay dries the gravy less than hot hearths of iron ; but in w hatever way the heat be preserved, it is a very36* VENISON. 1. Haunch. 2. Neck. 3. Shoulder. 4. Breast. BEEF. Hind Quarter. 1.

IVENISON. 37 essential article in serving a dinner, and every requisite should be allowed for that purpose. VENISON. To keep Venison. Keep it in a cold place, wash it with milk and water, and dry it with clean cloths till not the least damp re- mains, then dust pounded ginger over every part, which, as well as pepper, is a good preventive against the fly. By thus managing and watching, venison will hang a fortnight. When to be used, wash it with a little luke- warm water, and dry it. To dress Venison. A haunch of buck will take three hours and a half or three-quarters’ roasting; doe, only three hours and a quarter. Venison should be rather under than over done. Spread a sheet of white paper with butter, and put it over the fat, first sprinkling it with a little salt; then lay a coarse paste on strong paper, and cover the haunch; tie it with fine packthread, and set it at a distance from the fire, which must be a good one. Baste it often ; ten minutes before serving take off the paste, draw the meat nearer the fire, and baste it with butter and a good deal, of flour, to make it froth up well. Gravy for it should be put into a boat, and not into the dish, (unless there is none in the venison,) and made thus : Cut off the fat from two or three pounds of a loin of old mutton, and set in steaks on a gridiron for a few minutes, just to brown one side; put them into a sauce- pan with a quart of water, cover quite close for an hour, auLsimmer it gently; then uncover it, and stew till the gr.-vy is reduced to a pint. Season with salt only. Currant-jelly sauce must be served in a boat. Formerly, pap-sauce was eaten with venison; which, as some still like it, it may be necessary to direct. Grate white bread, and boil it with port wine, water, and a large stick of cinnamon; and when quite smooth,DOMESTIC COOKERY. 38 take out the cinnamon and add sugar. Claret may be used instead of port. Make the jelly-sauce thus. Beat some currant-jelly and a spoonful or two of port-wine, and set it over the fire till melted. Where jelly runs short, put more wine, and several lumps of refined sugar to the jelly, and let it boil up. Serve with French beans. Neck and Shoidder of Venison. Roast with paste as directed above, and the same sauce. To stew a shoulder of Venison. Let the meat hang till you judge proper to dress it: then take out the bone, heat the meat with a rolling-pin, lay some slices of mutton fat, that have been soaked and stewed tender in port wine, among it, sprinkle a little pepper and allspice over it in fine powder, roll it up tight, and tie it. Set it in a stewpan that will only just hold it, with some mutton or beef gravy not strong, half a pint of port wine, and some pepper and allspice. Sim- mer it close covered, and as slow as you can, for three or four hours, until quite tender; take oif the tape, set the meat on a dish, and strain the gravy over it. Serve with currant-jelly sauce. This is the best way to dress this joint, unless it is very fat, and then it should be roasted, if it has hung long enough to make it tolerably tender. The bone should be stewed with it. Breast of Venison. Do it as the shoulder, or make it into a small pasty; in the latter case, hake it with a good mutton gravy in a pan the day before ; and season with pepper, salt, and some Jamaica pepper, when you put the crust on. Hashed Venison Should be warmed wdth its own gra^7, or some without seasoning, as before; and only warmed through, not boiled. If there is no fat left, cut some slices of mutton fat, set it on the fire with a little port wine and sugar,39 BEEF. siramer till dry; then put to the hash, and it will eat as well as the fat of the venison. For Venison Pasty, look under the head Pastry ; as likewise an excellent imitation. BEEF. To keep Beef. The butcher should take out the kernels in the neck- pieces where the shoulder clod is taken off; two from each round of beef; one in the middle, which is called the pope’s eye; the other from the flap : there is also one in the thick flank, in the middle of the fat. If these are not taken out, especially in the summer, salt 'W'ill be of no use for keeping the meat s^yeet. There is another kernel between the rump and the edgebone. As the butchers seldom attend to this matter, the cook should take out the kernels; and then rub the salt well into such heef as is for boiling, and slightly sprinkle that which is for roasting, if in summer. To salt Beef or Pork for eating immediately. The piece should not weigh more than five or six pounds. Salt it thoroughly just before you put it into the pot; take a coarse cloth, flour it well, put the meat in, and fold it up close. Put it into a pot of boiling water, and boil it as long as you would any other salt beef of the same size, and it will be as salt as if done four or five days. Great attention is requisite in salting meat; and in the country where large quantities are cured, this is of particular importance. Beef and pork, after being examined and wiped as before directed, should be well sprinkled, and a few hours afterwards hung to drain be- fore it is rubbed with the salt: which method, hy cleans- ing the meat from the blood, prevents its tasting strong. It should be turned every day ; and. if wanted soon, should be rubbed with the pickle as often. A salting tub or lead may be used, and a cover to fit close. Those who use a good deal of salt meat will find it answ'er well40 DOMESTIC COOKERY. to boil up the pickle, skim it, and, -when cold, pour it over the next quantity of meat, after it has been sprinkled and drained. To salt Beef red; which is extremely good to eat fresh from the Pickle, or to hang to dry. Choose a piece of beef with as little bone as you can, (the flank is most proper,) sprinkle it, and let it drain a day; then rub it with common salt, saltpetre,' and bay- salt, but only a small proportion of the saltpetre, and you may add a few grains of cochineal, all in fine powder. Rub the pickle every day into the meat for a week, then only turn it. It will be excellent in eight days. In sixteen, drain it from the pickle; and let it be smoked at the oven’s mouth when heated with wood, or send it to the baker’s. A few days will smoke it. A little of the coarsest sugar may be added to the salt. It eats well boiled tender with greens or carrots. If to be grated as Dutch, then cut a lean bit, boil it till extremely tender, and while hot put it under a press. When cold, fold it in a sheet of paper, and it will keep in a dry place two or three months, ready for serving on bread and butter. To 'preserve any Beef, Mutton, or Venison for a length of time, without salt. After the foregoing cautions of examining and wiping, put the meat into a pan, and pour a good deal of treacle over it, in which turn it twice daily, observing that every part partakes of the treacle. Cover the pan with a piece of cheese-cloth, tie it down, and keep it in a cool place. When to be used, wash it well. The Dutch way to salt Beef. Take a lean piece of beef, rub it well with treacle or brown sugar, and turn it often. In three days wipe it, and salt it with common salt and saltpetre beaten fine; rub these well in, and turn it every day for a fortnight. Roll it tight in a coarse cloth, and press it under a heavyBEEF. 41 ■weight; hang to dry in w’ood smoke, but turn it upside do'wn every day. Boil it in pump-water, and press it: it will grate or cut into shivers, like Dutch beef. To twelve pounds of beef, the proportion of common salt is one pound. Beef Escarlot, to eat cold. Rub eight or ten pounds of a brisket with a pound of common salt, eight ounces of coarse sugar, two ounces of bay-salt, and one ditto of saltpetre, all in fine powder. Rub and turn it every day for a fortnight; boil slowly till tender; lay a weight upon it until cold. Beef d-la-mode. Choose a piece of thick flank of a fine heifer or ox. Cut into long slices, an inch thick, some fat bacon, but quite free from rust: dip them into vinegar, and then into a seasoning ready prepared of salt, black pepper, allspice and a clove, all in fine powder, with parsley, chives, thyme, savory, and knotted marjoram, shred as small as possible and well mixed. With a sharp knife makes holes deep enough to let in the larding ; then rub the beef over with the seasoning, and bind it up tight with tape. Set it in a well-tinned pan over a fire, or rather stove ; three or four onions must be fried brown and put to the beef, with two or three carrots, one tur- nip, a head or two of celery, and a small quantity of water ; let it simmer gently ten or twelve hours, or till extremely tender, turning the meat twice. Strain the gravy into a pan, remove the fat, keep the beef covered, then put them together, and add a glass of port wine. Take off the tape, and serve with the vege- tables ; or you may strain them off, and send them up cut into dice for garnish. Onions roasted, and then stewed with the gravy, are a great improvement. A tea-cupful of vinegar should be stewed with the beef. Beef d-la-royale. Take all the bones out of eight pounds of brisket of beef: make holes in it about an inch asunder; and fill42 DOMESTIC COOKERY. one with fat bacon, a second with parsley, a third with oysters, and so on, each being chopped and seasoned with pepper, salt, nutmeg, and cloves. When com- pletely stuffed, lay it into a pan, dredge it well with flour, pour upon it half a pint of port, and the same of broth. Bake it three hours, and then skim off the fat; put the meat into a dish, strain the gravy over, and gar- nish with pickles. A Fricandeau of Beef. Take a nice bit of lean beefj lard it with bacon sea- soned with pepper, salt, cloves, mace, and allspice. Put it into a stewpan with a pint of broth, a glass of white wine, a bundle of parsley, all sorts of sweet herbs, a clove of garlic, a shalot or two, four cloves, pepper and salt. When the meat is become tender, cover it close; skim the sauce well, and strain it; set it on the fire, and let it boil till it is reduced to a glaze. Glaze the larded side with this, and serve the meat on sorrel-sauce. To stew a Rump of Beef. Wash it well; and season it high mth pepper, cay- enne, salt, allspice, three cloves, and a blade of mace, all in fine powder. Bind it up tight, and lay it into a pot that will just hold it; resting it on two or three ozier twigs, to prevent the meat from sticking. Fry three large onions sliced, and put them to it, with tliree carrots, two turnips, a shalot, four cloves, a blade of mace, and some celery. Cover the meat with good beef- broth, or weak gravy. Simmer it as gently as possible for several hours till quite tender. Clear off the fat; and add to the gravy half a pint of port wine, a glass of vinegar, and a large spoonful of ketchup; simmer half an hour, and serve in a deep dish. Half a pint of table beer may be added. The herbs to be used should be burnet, tarragon, parsley, thyme, basil, savory, mar- joram, pennyroyal, knotted marjoram, and some chives if you can get them ; but observe to proportion the quantities to the pungency of the several sorts: let there be a good handful altogether.43 BEEF. Garnish with carrots, turnips, or truffles and morels, or pickles of different colours, cut small and laid in little heaps separate; chopped parsley, chives, beet-root, &c. If, when done, the gravy is too much to fill the dish, take only a part to season for serving, hut the less water the better; and to increase the richness, add a few beef bones and shanks of mutton in stewing. A spoonful or tn^o of made mustard is a great im- provement of the gravy. Steived Rump another loay. Half roast it; then put it into a large pot with three pints of water, one of small heer, one of port wine, some salt, three or four spoonsful of vinegar, two of ketchup, a bunch of sweet herbs of various kinds, (such as burnet, tarragon, parsley, thyme, basil, savory, pennyroyal, marjoram, knotted marjoram, and a leaf or two of sage,) some onions, cloves, and cayenne : cover it close, and simmer till quite tender : two or three hours will do it. When done, lay it into a deep dish, set it over hot water, and cover it close. Skim the gravy; put in a few pickled mushrooms, truffles, morels, and oysters, if i agreeable, (the truffles and morels having been pre- ! viously boiled in some of the liquor,) but it is very good I without; thicken the gravy with flour and butter, and I heat it with the above, and pour over the beef. Force- I meat balls of veal, anchovies, bacon, suet, herbs, spice, 3 bread, and eggs, to bind, are a great improvement. Rump of Beef roasted. If of a well-fed ox, and hung till tender, this is one of the most juicy and best flavoured of all the joints of beef. It is generally sold in the country undivided from the edgebone : or cut across, and not lengthways as in London, which makes it too large for one dressing, and neither fit for boiling nor roasting. Beef Rump en Matelotte. Cut a beef rump in pieces, which parboil, and then stew in broth without seasoning; when about half done.44 DOMESTIC COOKERY. stir a little butter with a spoonful of flour, over the fire, till brown, and moisten it with a spoonful of the broth : then put in the beef with a dozen of large parboiled onions, a glass of sherry, a bunch of parsley, a laurel- leaf, a bunch of sweet herbs, pepper and salt. Stew until the rump and onions are done, skim well, and put an anchovy and a spoonful of capers, cut small, into the sauce, give a boil, and serve the rump in the middle of the dish, and the onions round it. A beef rump will take four hours dressing. To stew Brisket of Beef. Put the part which has the hard fat into a stewpot with a small quantity of water: let it boil up, and skim it thoroughly: then add carrots, turnips, onions, celery, and a few peppercorns. Stew it extremely tender; then take out the flat bones, and remove all the fat fi-ora the soup. Either serve that and the meat in a tureen ; or the soup alone, and the meat on a dish, garnished with some vegetables. Small suet dumplings are a great im- provement in the soup. The following sauce is much admired, and served with the beef:—Take half a pint of the soup, and mix it with a spoonful of ketchup, a glass of port wine, a tea-spoonful of made mustard, a little flour, a bit of butter and salt; boil all together a few minutes, then pour it round the meat. Chop capers, walnuts, red cabbage, pickled cucumbers, and chives or parsley, small, and put in separate heaps over it. To press Beef Salt a bit of brisket, thin part of the flank, or the tops of the ribs, with salt and saltpetre, five days, then boil it gently till extremely tender; put it under a great weight, or in a cheese-press, till perfectly cold. It eats excellently cold, and for sandwiches. To make HunteBs Beef. To a round of beef that weighs twenty-five pounds, take three ounces of saltpetre, three ounces of the coarsest sugar, an ounce of cloves, a nutmeg, half an45 BEEF. ounce of allspice, and three hanclsful of common salt, all in the finest powder. The beef should hang two or three days : then rub the above well into it, and turn and rub it every day for two or three weeks. The bone must be taken out at first. When to be dressed, dip it into cold water, to take off the loose spice, bind it up tight with tape, and put it into a pan with a tea-cupful of water at the bottom, cover the top of the meat with shred suet, and the pan w ith a browm crust and paper, and bake it five or six hours. When cold, take off the paste and tape. The gravy is very fine ; and a little of it adds greatly to the flavour of any hash, soup, &c. Both the gravy and the beef will keep some time. The meat should be cut with a very sharp knife, and quite smooth, to prevent w'aste. An excellent mode of dressing Beef. Hang three ribs three or four days; take out the bones from the whole length, sprinkle it with salt, roll the meat tight, and roast it. Nothing can look nicer; but it requires long dressing. The above done with spices, &c., and baked as hunter’s beef, is excellent. To collar Beef. Choose the thin end of the flank of fine mellow' beef, but not too fat; lay it into a dish with salt and saltpetre, turn and rub it every day for a week, and keep it cool. Then take out every bone and gristle, remove the skin of the inside part, and cover it thick with the following seasoning cut small: a large handful of parsley, the same of sage, some thyme, marjoram, and pennyroyal, pepper, salt, and allspice. Roll the meat up as tight as possible, and bind it; then boil it gently for seven or eight hours. A cloth must be put round before the tape. Put the beef under a good weight while hot, without undoing it; the shape will then be oval. Part of a breast of veal rolled in with the beef looks and eats very well.46 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Beefsteaks Should he cut from a rump that has hung a few days. Broil them over a very clear or charcoal fire : put into the dish a little minced shalot, and a table-spoonful of ketchup; and rub a bit of butter on the steak the moment of serving. It should be turned often, that the gravy may not be drawn out on either side. This dish requires to be eaten so hot and fresh done, that it is not in perfection if served with anything else. Pepper and salt should be added when taking it off the fire. Beefsteaks and Oyster Sauce. Strain off the liquor from the oysters, and throw them into cold water to take off the grit, while you simmer the liquor with a bit of mace and lemon-peel; then put the oysters in ; stew them a few minutes ; add a little cream if you have it; and some butter rubbed iu a bit of flour; let them boil up once, and have rump-steaks, well seasoned and broiled, ready for throwing the oyster- sauce over the moment you are to serve. Staffordshire Beefsteaks. Beat them a little with a rolling-pin, flour and season, then fry with sliced onion of a fine light brown ; lay the steaks into a stewpan, and pour as much boiling water over them as will serve for sauce; stew them very gently half an hour, and add a spoonful of ketchup, or walnut-liquor, before you serve. Italian Beefsteaks. Cut a fine large steak from a rump that has been well hung, or it will do from any tender part: beat it, and season with pepper, salt, and onion; lay it iu an iron stewpan that has a cover to fit quite close, and set it by the side of the fire without water. Take care it does not burn, but it must have a strong heat; in two or three hours it will be quite tender, and then serve with its own gravy.47 BEEF. Rolled Beefsteaks. Beat some well-hung rump-steaks, till tender, with a cleaver; make a forcemeat of the breast of a fowl, half a pound of veal, half the same of ham or gammon, fat and lean, the kidney of a loin of veal, and a sweetbread, all cut very small; a few truffles and morels stewed and cut, a shalot or two, some parsley, a little thyme, some grated lemon-peel, the yolks of two eggs, half a nutmeg, and a quarter of a pint of cream; mix these well to- gether, and stir over the fire for ten minutes; lay the forcemeat on the stakes, roll them up, and skewer them tight: fry them a fine brown; take them from the fat, and stew them a quarter of an hour with a pint of beef- gravy, a spoonful of port, two ditto of ketchup, and a few fresh or pickled mushrooms. Take up the steaks, cut them in two, serve them with the cut side upper- most, and the gravy round, having carefully skimmed it. Garnish with lemon. Beefsteaks of underdone Meat. Cut them an inch and a half thick, with a good deal of fat; lay them on the gridiron over a quick fire, turn often, and as soon as brown lay them on a very hot dish that has been rubbed with shalot, and put in some of the gravy of the meat, and a spoonful of ketchup. When taken off the fire, put salt and pepper. If seasoned while broiling, the meat will be hardened, and the juices wasted. The steaks may he served on chopped cabbage, warmed with butter, pepper, and salt. Or the steaks as before, and the cabbage in a separate dish, with sliced fried potatoes. Beef-collops. Cut thin slices of beef from the rump, or any other tender part, and divide them into pieces three inches long; beat them with the blade of a knife, and flour them. Fry the collops quick in butter two minutes; then lay them into a small stewpan, and cover them with a pint of gravy; add a bit of butter rubbed in48 DOMESTIC COOKERY. flour, pepper, salt, the least bit of shalot shred as fine as possible, half a walnut, four small pickled cucumbers, and a tea-spoonful of capers cut small. Take care that it does not boil; and serve the stew in a very hot covered dish. Beef-Palates. Simmer them in water several hours, till they will peel; then cut the palates into slices, or leave them whole, as you choose; and stew them in a rich gra\'y till as tender as possible. Before you serve, season them with cayenne, salt, and ketchup. If the gravy was drawn clear, give it a boil with some butter and flour. If to he served white, boil them in milk, and stew them in fricassee-sauce; adding cream, butter, flour, and mushroom-powder, and a little pounded mace. To pickle Beef Palates. Clean four fine palates, simmer them in a quart of water, skim them well, then put as much mace, cloves, pepper, and sweet herbs, as shall make them high, in which boil them until perfectly tender, which will be about five hours; take the skin off, cut them into small pieces, and let them cool, being covered. Make a pickle sufficient to cover them, with equal parts of white Mnne and vinegar, the spices before used, and some salt: when cold, strain, and pour the liquor on the palates, with a little fresh spice, and four or five bay-leaves; cover very close, and keep for use. They eat deliciousl}\ To pot Beef. Take two pounds of lean beef, rub it with saltpetre, and let it lie one night; then salt with common salt and cover it with water four days in a small pan. Dry it with a cloth, and season with black pepper ; lay it into as small a pan as will hold it, cover it with coarse paste, and bake it five hours in a very cool oven. Put no li- quor in. When cold, pick out the strings and fat; beat theBEEF. 49 meat very fine with a quarter of a pound of fine butter, just warmed, but not oiled, and as ranch of the gravy as wll make it into paste; put it into very small pots, and cover them with melted butter. Another loay. Rub three pounds of beef with two ounces of the brownest sugar, and a quarter of an ounce of saltpetre ; let it lie forty-eight hours; wash it clean, and dry it; season with pepper, salt, mace, and twelve cloves; lay it in an earthen jrot, with four ounces of butter put over it in pieces. Bake it three hours ; then cut off the hard outside and beat it in a mortar; add seasoning to your taste. Melt four ounces of fine butter in that and the gravy which comes from the beef, and beat with the beef as fine as possible. Put it into pots; cover deep with clarified butter, and keep it in a cool, dry place, and it will be long good. Another icay. Take beef that has been dressed, either boiled or roasted; beat it in a mortar with some pepper, salt, a few cloves, grated nutmeg, and a little fine butter, just warm. To dress the Inside of a cold Sirloin of Beef. Cut out all the meat, and a little fat into pieces as thick as your finger, and two inches long : dredge them with flour; and fry in butter of a nice brown : drain the butter from the meat, and toss it up in a rich gravy, sea- soned with pepper, salt, anchovy, and shalot. Do not let it boil on any aceount. Before you serve, add two spoonsful of vinegar. Garnish with crimped parsley. To dress the Inside of a Sirloin of Beef to taste like Hare. Take the inside of a large sirloin that has hung; beat it a little; soak it in a glass of port, ditto of vinegar, E50 DOMESTIC COOKERY. twenty-fouT hours. Have ready a good stuffing as for hare; do not spread, but put it into the middle of the beef, and roll it up tight. Roast it on a hanging spit, and baste it with a glass of wine and vinegar, mixed with a tea-spoonful of Jamaica pepper, and a clove or two, in finest powder, until it is all dried up ; then baste with butter. Serve with a rich gravy in the dish, and melted butter, and currant-jelly sauce in tureens. The inside of the sirloin may be sometimes bought of the butchers who salt beef for shipping, that part being always first removed. Another way to dress the Inside of a Sirloin. Cut it out in one piece, if not used at table; stew^ it with good broth or gravy, a little spice, and a table- spoonful of walnut ketchup. Serve with chopped pickles. This makes a very genteel corner-dish. Fricassee of cold Roast Beef Cut very thin slices of under-done beef, shred a hand- ful of parsley very small, cut an onion into quarters, and put altogether into a stewpan, with a piece of butter and some strong broth; season with salt and pepper, and simmer very gently a quarter of an hour: then mix into it the yolks of two eggs, a glass of port wine, and a spoonful of vinegar; stir it quick over the fire a minute or two, rub the dish with shalot, and turn the fricassee into it. To dress cold Beef that is underdone, called Beef Olives. Cut slices half an inch thick, and four inches square; lay on them a forcemeat of crumbs of bread, shalot, a little suet or fat, pepper and salt. Roll them, and fasten with a small skewer: put them into a stewpan with some gravy made of beef bones, or the gravy of the meat, and a spoonful or two of MTiter, and stew them till tender. Fresh meat will do.BEEF. 51 To dress the same, called Sanders. Mince beef or mutton small, with onion, pepj^er, and salt; add a little grav)", put it into scallop-shells or sau- cers, making them three parts full, and fill them up with potatoes ; mash with a little cream, put a bit of butter on the top, and brown them in an oven, or before the fire, or with a salamander. To dress the same, called Cecils. Mince any kind of meat, crumbs of bread, a good deal of onion, some anchovies, lemon-peel, salt, nutmeg, chop- ped parsley, pepper, and a bit of butter warm, and mix them over a fire for a few minutes; when cool enough, make them up into balls of the size and shape of a tur- key’s egg, with an egg; sprinkle them with fine crumbs, and then fry them of a yellow brown; and serve with gravy as before directed for Beef Olives. To mince Beef. Shred the underdone part fine, with some of the fat; put it into a small stewpan, with some onion or shalot, (a very little will do,) a little water, pepper, and salt; boil it till the onion is quite soft: then put some, of the gravy of the meat to it, and the mince. A few minutes will dress it, but do not let it boil. Have a small hot dish Avith sippets of bread ready, and pour the mince into it, but first mix a large spoonful of vinegar with it. If shalot vinegar is used, there will be no need of the onion nor the raAv shalot. To hash Beef. Uo it the same as in the last receipt, only the meat is to be in slices, and you may add a spoonful of Avalnut liquor or ketchup. Observe, that it is owing to boiling hashes or minces that they get hard. All sorts of stews, or meat dressed a second time, should be only simmered; and this last only hot through.DOMESTIC COOKERY. 52 Beef eL-la-vinaigretle. Cut a slice of underdone boiled beef three inches thick, and a little fat ■, stew it in half a pint of water, a glass of white (not sweet) wine, a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion, and a bay-leaf- season it with three cloves pounded, and pepper, till the liquor is nearly wasted away, turning it once. When cold, serve it. Strain off the gravy, and mix it with a little vinegar for sauce. Round of Beef Should be carefully salted, and rubbed with the pickle for eight or ten days; if to remain longer, only turn it. The bone should be cut out first, and the beef skewered, and tied up to make it quite round. It may be stuffed with parsley, if approved; in which case the holes to ad- mit the parsley must be made with a sharp-pointed knife, and the parsley coarsely cut and stuffed in tight. As soon as the beef boils it should be skimmed, and after- wards kept boiling very gently. JVelsh Beef. Take a round of beef, and rub into it two ounces of powdered saltpetre. After standing six hours, season xvell w-ith pepper, salt, and a little allspice pounded. Let the beef stand sixteen days in the brine, turning it fre- quently. After washing it well with the pickle, put it into an earthen vessel, and bake it in an oven, with a great deal of beef suet over and under it. Cover it with a coarse paste, and let it remain six or eight hours in tlie oven. When sufficiently done, pour the gravy from the beef, and let it stand till cold. It will keep two months, and all the time retain its goodness. To roast Tongue and Udder. After cleaning the tongue well, salt it with common salt and saltpetre three days; then boil it, and likewise a fine young udder with some fat to it, (but separately from the tongue,) till both are tolerably tender; let tliem become cold ; then tie the thick part of one to tlie thin53 BEEF. part of the other, and roast the tongue and the udder together. Serve them with good gravy, and currant-jelly sauce. A few cloves should be stuck in the udder. This is an excellent dish. To cure Tongues. Some persons like neat’s tongues cured with the whole root on, in which case they look much larger, but have not any other advantage, the latter being too hard to cut pleasantly when salted. If the root is to be removed, cut it off near the gullet, but without taking away the fat that is under the tongue. The root must be soaked in salt and water a night, and extremely well cleaned before it be dressed, when it is very good stewed with gravy; or may be salted two days and used for peas-soup. Having left the fat and a little of the kernel under the tongue, sprinkle it with salt and let it drain until next day. Then, for each tongue mix a large spoonful of common salt, the same quantity of coarse sugar, and half as much saltpetre: rub it well in, and do so every day for a week ; then add another large spoonful of salt. If rubbed daily, a tongue will be ready in ten days •, but if only turned in the })ickle, it will not be too salt in four or five weeks, but should not be kept longer. When to be dried, write the date of the day on parchment, and tie it on. Smoke three days, or hang them in a dry place without smoking. When to be dressed, boil the tongue extremely tender allow five hours, and if done sooner it is easily kept hot. The longer it is kept after smoking, the higher will be the flavour; if hard, it may require soaking four or five hours; but in the estimation of many persons, they are best dressed out of the pickle. Another ivay. Clean as above; for two tongues allow an ounce of saltpetre, and an ounce of sal-prunella; with which rub them daily. The third day, cover them with common salt; turn them every day for three weeks, then dryDOMESTIC COOKERY. 54 them and rub over them bran, and smoke them. In ten days they will be fit to cat. Keep in a cool dry place. To stew Tongue. Salt a tongue with saltpetre and common salt for a week, turning it every day. Boil it tender enough to peel: when done, stew it in a moderately strong gravy; season with soy, mushroom ketchup, cayenne, pounded cloves, and salt if necessary. Serve with trufiles, morels, and mushrooms stewed in gravy. In both this receipt and the next, the roots must be taken off the tongues before salting, but some fat must be left. An excellent loay of preparing Tongues to eat cold. Season with common salt and saltpetre, brown sugar, a little bay-salt, pepper, cloves, mace, and allspice, in fine powder, for a fortnight: then take away the pickle,' put the tongue into a small pan, and lay some butter on it; cover it with brown crust, and bake slowly till so tender that a straw would go through it. The thin part of tongues, if hung up to dry, grates like hung beef, and also makes a fine addition to the flavour of omelets. Beef-heart. Wash it carefully; stuff"as hare; and serve with rich gravy, and currant-jelly sauce. Hash with the same, and port wine. Stewed Ox-Cheek, plain. Soak and cleanse a fine cheek the day before it is to be eaten; put it into a stewpot that will cover close, with three quarts of water ; simmer it after it has first boiled up and been well skimmed. In two hours put plenty of carrots, leeks, two or three turnips, a bunch of sweet herbs, some whole pepper, and four ounces of all- spice. Skim it often ; when the meat is tender, take it out, and cover it close, to keep it from becoming black ;BEEF. 55 let the soup get cold, take off the cake of fat, and serve the soup separate, or with the meat. It should be of a fine brown; which might be done by burnt sugar; or by frying some onions quite brown with flour, and simmer- ing them with it. This last way improves the flavour of all soups and gravies of the brown kind. If vegetables are not approved in the soup, they may be taken out, and a small roll be toasted, or bread fried, and added. Ce- lery is a great addition, and should always be served. When it is not to be got, the seed of it gives quite as good a flavour, boiled in and strained off. To dress an Ox-Cheek another way. Soak half a head three hours, and clean it with plenty of water. Take the meat off the bones, and put it into a pan with a large onion, a bunch of sweet herbs, some bruised allspice, pepper, and salt. Lay the bones on the top; pour on three pints of water, and cover the pan close with brown paper, or a dish that will fit close. Let it stand eight or ten hours in a slow oven; or simmer it by the side of the fire, or on a hot hearth. When done tender, put the meat into a clean pan, and let it get cold. Take the cake of fat off, and warm the head in pieces in the soup, adding truffles, morels, and forcemeat-balls. Put what vegetables you choose. Marrow Bones. If too long to serve undivided, saw them in two; cover the open end with cloth thickly floured and tied close. Boil, and serve with very hot toast. The marrow makes good puddings. See Puddings. Tripe May be served in a tureen, stewed tender witli milk and onions ; or fried in bits dipped in batter. In both the above ways, serve melted butter for sauce. Or cut the thin part in oblong bits and stew in gravy; thicken •with butter rolled in a very little flour, and add a spoon-DOMESTIC COOKERY. 56 fill of mushroom ketchup. Or boil it tender in milk, and serve in white sauce. Soused Tripe. Boil the tripe, but not quite tender; then put it into salt and water, Avhich must be changed every day till it is all used. When you dress the tripe, dip it into batter of flour and eggs, and fry it of a good brown. Ox-feet, or Cow-heels, Being common and cheap, are not highly esteemed; but they contain much nutriment, and may be dressed vari- ous ways :— Soak them well; boil, and serve in a napkin, with the following sauce, in a boat: Thick melted butter, a large spoonful of vinegar, a ladle of mustard, and the same of salt. Or boil, and then stew them in a brown gravy. Or cut the heel in four jiarts, dip each in egg, flour, and fry them in butter. Or fry, and serve with onions fried, and put round them: sauce as above. Or bake for mock turtle. (See that article.) The water in which they are boiled will make equally good jellies, either relishing or sweet, with that of calves’ feet, if duly ]irepared; and at a far less expense. This jelly gives great additional richness likewise to soups and gravies, as will be hereafter specified. Suet. This necessary article is often very scarce, from the great demand; and, as it soon becomes tainted, care is especially required to prcseiwe it in perfection. Let it be examined as soon as it comes in, and every bit of kidney and kernel, or skin, be taken out; separate the solid parts from the skinny and loose; use the latter first, and lay the other, when wiped dry, into a jar, and cover it with salt and water. It will keep thus for a month or two, for stuffing, puddings, «S:c., but should be soaked first in plain water.VEAL. 57 Dripping is the fat wliich leaves the meat in roasting, and is used to fry fish; it likewise makes good pie-crust for kitchen use. Where much meat is dressed, the sale of it to the poor makes a very profitable business to the cook in many families. Thus, what is bought in at a high price becomes of no advantage to the purchaser. Bubble and Squeak. « Boil, chop, and fiy, with a little butter, pepper, and salt, some cabbage, and lay on it slices of underdone beef lightly fried. VEAL. To keep Veal. The first part that turns bad of a leg of veal is where the udder is skewered back. The skewer should be taken out, and both that and the whole of the meat wiped every day, by which means it will keep good three or four days in hot weather, if the larder be a good one. Take care to cut out the pipe that runs along the chine of a loin of veal, as you do of beef, to hinder it from tainting. The skirt of the breast of veal is likewise to be taken oft’; and the inside of the breast wiped and scraped, and sprinkled w'itb a little salt. If veal is in danger of not keeping, wash it thoroughly, and boil the joint ten minutes, putting it into the pot when the water is boiling hot; then put it into a very cool larder. Or it may be plunged into cold water till cool, and then wiped and put by. Leg of Veal. Let the fillet be cut large or small, as best suits the number of your company. Take out the bone, fill the space with a fine stuffing, and let it be skewered quite round ; and send the large side uppermost. When half roasted, if not before,put a paper over the fat; and take care to allow a sufficient time, and put it a good distance from the fire, as the meat is very solid; serve with meltedDOMESTIC COOKERY. 58 butter poured over it.—You may pot some of it, or dress in any of the ways hereafter directed for dressing veal. Knuckle of Veal. As few people like boiled veal, it may be well to leave the knuckle small, by taking off some cutlets, or coUops, before it be dressed ; and as the knuckle will keep longer than the fdlet, it is best not to cut off the slices till wanted. Break the bones, to make it take less room; wash it well; and put it into a saucepan with three onions, a blade of mace or two, and a few peppercorns; cover it with water, and simmer it till quite ready. In the mean time some macaroni should be boiled with it if ap- proved, or rice, or a little rice-flour, to give it a small degree of thickness; but do not put too much. Before it is served, add half a pint of milk and cream, and let it come up either with or without the meat. The meat may be served in the soup, or on a separate dish. If the latter, it may be covered with onion-sauce. Bacon and some greens are usually eaten with boiled veal. Put chopped parsley for garnish. Or fry the. knuckle with sliced onions and butter to a good brown; and have ready peas, lettuce, onion, and a cucumber or two, stewed in a small quantity of water an hour; then add these to the veal; and stew it till the meat is tender enough to eat, but not overdone. Throw in pepper, salt, and a bit of shred mint, and serve all together. Shoulder of Veal. Cut off the knuckle for a stew or gravy. Roast the other part with a stuffing; you may lard it. Serve with melted butter. The blade-bone, with a good deal of meat left on, eats extremely well with mushroom or oyster sauce, or mushr room ketchup in butter. Forced Veal. Hang a small shoulder of veal two days ; wash, dry, and bone it. Have ready a forcemeat made of thirty59 VEAL. 03'sters, (each cut in four,) four ounces of fat and lean bacon, or ham shredded, two ounces of fresh butter, two ounces of crumbs of bread, a dozen of chives, a little parsley, and a small sprig of dried knotted marjoram, minced extremely fine, a dessert-spoonful of salt, and a tea-spoonful of white sugar, mixed up with two eggs. Roll this in the veal, which tie up so close as to prevent the seasoning being lost. Lard the veal, and wrap it in a large sheet of paper, well buttered; fix it in a small cradle spit; and, allowing tsventy minutes for every pound, keep it at a proper distance to become gradually hot through, and by degrees bring it nearer to the fire. When vvuthin twenty minutes of being ready, take off the paper, flour the meat lightly, and make it a light brown ; then glaze it, and serve with a rich gravy in the dish. Neck of Veal. Cut off the scrag to boil, and cover it with onion- sauce. It should be boiled in milk and water. Parsley and butter may be served with it, instead of onion-sauce. Or it may be stewed with whole rice, small onions, and peppercorns, with a very little water. Or boiled and eaten with bacon and greens. The best end may be either roasted, broiled as steaks, or made into pies. As it is a dry joint, larding is a great improvement, if roasted. Neck of Veal a-la-braise. Lard the best end with bacon rolled in parsley chopped fine, salt, pepper, and nutmeg: put it into a tosser, and cover it with water. Put to it the scrag-end, a little lean bacon or ham, an onion, two carrots, two heads of celer}', and about a glass of Madeira wine. Stew it quick two hours, or till it is tender, but not too much. Strain off the liquor; mix a little flour and butter in a stewpan till i brown, and lay the veal in this, the upper side to the I bottom of the ]>an. Let it be over the fire till it gets coloured; then lay it into the dish, stir some of the liquor 1 in, and boil it up, skim it nicely, and squeeze orange or I lemon juice into it, and serve with the meat.60" DOMESTIC COOKERY. Breast of Veal. Before roasted, if large, the two ends may he taken olf and fried to stew, or the whole may be roasted. But- ter should be poured over it. If any be left, cut the pieces into handsome sizes, put them into a stewpan, and pour some broth over them; or if you have no broth, a little water will do ; add a bunch of herbs, a blade or two of mace, some pepper, and an anchovy; stew till the meat is tender, thicken with butter and flour, and add a little ketchup ; or the whole breast may be stewed, after cutting off the two ends. Serve the sweetbread whole upon it; which may either be stewed or parboiled^and then covered with crumbs, herbs, pepper, and salt, and browned in a Dutch oven. If you have a few mushrooms, truffles, and morels, stew them with it, and serve. Boiled breast of veal, smothered wth onion-sauce, is an excellent dish, if not old nor too fat. To collar a Breast of Veal. Bone it, take off the thick skin and gristle, and beat the meat with a rolling-pin. Season it with herbs chop- ped very fine, mixed with salt, pepper, and mace. Lay some thick slices of fine ham; or roll into it tw-o or three calves’ tongues of a fine red, boiled first an hour or two, and skinned. Bind it up tight in a cloth, and tape it. Set it over a slow fire to simmer in a small quantity of water, till it is quite tender; this will take some hours. Lay it on the dresser, with a board and w'eight on it, till quite cold. Pigs’ and calves’ feet boiled, and taken from the bones, may be put in or round it. The different colours laid in layers look well when cut; and you may put in yolks of eggs boiled, beet-root, grated ham, and chopped parsle)*, in different parts. When it is cold, take off the tape and pour over it the liquor, which must be boiled up twice a week, or it will not keep.VEAL. 61 Collared Veal, to eat Hot. Bone a piece of the breast, and lay a forcemeat over it of herbs, bread, an anchovy, a spoonful or two of scraped ham, a very little mace, white pepper, and chop- ped chives; then roll, bind it up tight, and stew it in water or weak broth. Let the colour be preserved, and serve it in veal gravy, or fricassee sauce, with mushrooms, and artichoke bottoms. To make a Currie, Cut part of a breast of veal into pieces about three inches long, and two wide; fry them in butter of a light brown, with an onion chopped line. While hot, rub them well over with two table-spoonsful of currie-powder. Put into a stewpan, and add some good veal-broth, pepper, salt, and an ounce of butter, and stew very slowly till the meat is quite tender. A fresh chillie (when it can be had) eaten with the Currie, is a great improvement to the flavour ; or capsi- cum, fresh or pickled, may be substituted ; or put lemon- juice, or the liquor of Indian pickle, to make it rather acid. Fish, fowl, and all kinds of flesh, are occasionally made into curries. Chump of Veal h-la-dauhe. Cut off the chump end of the loin ; take out the edge- bone; stuff the hollow with good forcemeat, tie it up tight, and lay it in a stewpan with the bone you took out, a small faggot of herbs and anchovy, two blades of mace, a few white peppers, and a pint of good veal-broth. Co- ver the veal with slices of fat bacon, and lay a sheet of white paper over it. Cover the pan close, simmer it two hours, then take out the bacon and glaze the veal. Serve it on mushrooms, or with sorrel sauce, or what else you please. Veal-rolls of either cold Meat or fresh. Cut thin slices ; and spread on them a fine seasoning of a very few crumbs, a little chopped bacon or scraped62 DOMESTIC COOKERY. ham, and a little suet, parslej^ and shalot, (or, instead of the parsley and shalot, some fresh mushrooms stewed and minced,) pepper, salt, and a small piece of pounded mace. This stuffing may either fill up the roll like a sausage, or be rolled with the meat. In either case, tie it up very tight, and stew very slowly in a gravy and a glass of sherry. Serve it when tender, after skimming it nicely. Harrico of Veal. Take the best end of a small neck; cut the bones short, hut leave it whole; then put it into a stewpan just covered with brown gravy; and when it is nearly done, have ready a pint of boiled peas, six cucumbers pared and sliced, and two cabbage-lettuces cut into quar- ters, all stewed in a little good broth ; put them to the veal, and let them simmer ten minutes. When the veal is in the dish, pour the sauce and vegetables over it, and lay the lettuce with forcemeat balls round it. A Dunelm of cold Veal or Fowl. Stew a few small mushrooms in their own liquor and a bit of butter, a quarter of an hour ■, mince them very small, and add them (with their liquor) to minced veal, with also a little peppier and salt, some cream, and a bit of butter rubbed in less than half a tea-spoonful of flour. Simmer three or four minutes, and serve on thin sippets of bread. Minced Veal. Cut cold veal as fine as possible, but do not chop it; put to it a very little lemon-peel shred, two grates of nutmeg, some salt, and four or five spoonsful of either a little weak broth, milk, or water; simmer these gently with the meat, but take care not to let it boil; and add a bit of butter rubbed in flour. Put sippets of thin toasted bread, cut into a three-cornered shape, round the dish. Fried crumbs of bread lightly strewed over, or served in little heaps on the meat, arc an improve- ment to the look and flavour; a little shred of shalot may occasionally be added.VEAL. 63 Cutlets Maintenon. Cut slices about three-quarters of au inch thick, beat them until a rolling-pin, and wet them on both sides with egg; dip them into a seasoning of bread-crumbs, pars- lej% thyme, knotted marjoram, pepper, salt, and a little nutmeg grated : then put them into papers folded over, and broil them; and have in a boat melted butter, with a little mushroom ketchup. Cutlets another ivay. Prepare as above, and fry them; lay them into a dish, and keep them hot; dredge a little flour, and put a bit of butter into the pan ; brown it, then pour a little boil- ing water into it, and boil quick; season with pepper, salt, and ketchup, and pour over them. Or prepare as before, and dress the cutlets in a Dutch oven ; pour over them melted butter and mushrooms. Or pepper, salt, and broil them, especially neck steaks. They are excellent with herbs. Veal Collops. Cut long thin collops, beat them well, and lay on them a bit of thin bacon of the same size, and spread forcemeat on that, seasoned high, and also a little, garlic and cay- enne. Roll them up tight about the size of two fingers, but no more than two or three inches long; jnit a very small skewer to fasten each firmly ; rub egg over; fiy them of a fine brown, and pour a rich brown gravy over. To dress Collops quick. Cut them as thin as paper with a very sharp knife, and in small bits. Throw the skin, and any odd bits of the veal, into a little water, with a dust of pepper and salt; set them on the fire while you beat the collops; and dip them into a seasoning of herbs, bread, pepper, salt, and a scrape of nutmeg, but first wet them in egg. Then put a bit of butter into a frying-pan, and give the collops a very quick fry; for as they are so thin, two minutes will do them on both sides : put tliem into a hot dish before the fire; then strain and thicken the gravy.64 DOMESTIC COOKERY. give it a boil in tbe frying-pan, and pour it over the col- lops. A little ketchup is an improvement. Another way.—Fry them in butter, only seasoned with salt and pepper ; then simmer them in gravy, either white or brown, with bits of bacon served with them. If white, add lemon-peel and mace, and some cream. Scotch Collops. Cut veal into thin bits about three inches over, and rather round ; beat with a rolling-pin, and grate a little nutmeg over them; dip into the yolk of an egg, and fry them in a little butter of a fine brown; pour the butter off 3 and have ready warm, to pour upon them, half a pint of gravy, a little bit of butter rubbed into a little flour, a yolk of egg, two large spoonsful of cream, and a bit of salt. Do not boil the sauce, but stir it till of a fine thickness to serve with the collops. Scallops of cold Veal or Chicken. Mince the meat extremely small: and set it over the fire with a scrape of nutmeg, a little pepper and salt, and a little cream for a few' minutes; then put it into the scallop-shells, and fill them with crumhs of bread, over which put some bits of butter, and brow'n them before the fire. Either veal or chicken looks and eats well, prepared in this way, and lightly covered w'ith crumbs of bread fried 3 or these may be put on in little heaps. Fricandeau of Veal. Cut a large piece from the fat side of the leg, about nine inches long, and half as thick and broad : beat it with the rolling-pin 3 take off the skin, and trim off the rough edges. Lard the top and sides 3 and cover it with fat bacon, and then with white paper. Lay it into the stewpan with any pieces of undressed veal or mutton, four onions, a carrot sliced, a faggot of sweet herbs, four blades of mace, four bay-leaves, a pint of good veal or mutton brotli, and four or five ounces of lean ham or gammon. Cover the pan close, and let it stew' slowly65 VEAL. three hours ; then take up the meat, remove all the fat from the gravy, and boil it quick to a glaze. Keep the fricandeau quite hot, and then glaze it; and serve with the remainder of the glaze in the dish, and sorrel-sauce in a sauce-tureen; or endive sauce. A cheaper, but equally good, Fricandeau of Veal. With a sharp knife cut the lean part of a large neck from the best end, scooping it from the bones the length of your band, and prepare it the same way as in the last receipt; the meat of three or four bones only will be necessartq and they udll make the gravy; but if the prime part of the leg is cut off, it spoils the whole. Fricandeau another loay. Take two large round sweetbreads, and prepare them as you would veal; make a rich gravy with truffles, morels, mushrooms, and artichoke-bottoms, and serve it round. If the fricandeau lie a few hours in cold water before it be dressed, it will be much whiter, and eat shorter. Veal Olives. Cut long thin slices, beat them, lay on them thin slices of fat bacon, and over these a layer of forcemeat, sea- soned high with some shred shalot and cayenne. Roll them tight, about the size of two fingers, but not more than two or three inches long; fasten them round with a small skewer, rub egg over them, and fry them of a light brown. Serve with browm gravy, in which boil some mushrooms, pickled or fresh. Garnish with balls fried. To pot Veal. Cold fillet makes the finest potted veal; or you may do it as follows:—Season a large slice of the fillet before it is dressed with some mace, peppercorns, and two or three cloves; lay it close into a potting-pan that will but just hold it, fill it up with water, and bake it three hours; then pound it quite small in a mortar, and add salt to your taste: put a little gravy to it, in pounding, that has been pDOMESTIC COOKERY. 6G baked, if to be eaten soon ; otherwise, only a little butter just melted. When done, cover it over with butter. Potted things keep best in very small pots. To pot Veal or Chicken with Ham. Pound some cold veal or white of chicken, seasoned as directed in the last article, and put layers of it with layers of ham pounded, or rather shred; press each down, and cover with butter. This eats excellently; and, turned out whole, makes a pretty corner-dish for a second course : or it may be sliced. Veal Cake. Boil six or eight eggs hard; cut the yolks in two, and lay some of the pieces in the bottom of the pot; shake in a little chopped parsley, some slices of veal and ham, add then eggs again; shaking in after each some chopped parsley, with pepper and salt, till the pot is full. Then put in water enough to cover it, and lay on it about an ounce of butter; tie it over with a double paper, and bake it about an hour. Then press it close together with a spoon, and let it stand till cold. It may be put into a small mould; and then it will turn out beautifully for a supper or side dish. Chartreuse. Line a copper mould with fat bacon, lay sliced carrots and turnips round the edges, then cover with a force- meat, and put in a fricassee of veal or fowl. Cover the top of the mould with a paste, bake it an hour, and serve it turned out upon a dish. Marble Veal. Boil tender, skin, and cut, a dried neat’s tongue in thin sUces, and beat as tine as possible wdth half a pound of butter, and some mace pounded. Have ready some of a roasted hllet of veal, beaten with butter, and sea- soned with white pepper and salt; of this put a thick layer in a large potting-pot, then put the tongue in, in rough, irregular lumps, not to touch each other; fill up67 VEAL. the pot with veal, and press down quite close. Pour clarified butter thick over; keep in a dry, cool place, and serve in thin slices, keeping back the butter. Gar- nish with parsley. An excellent Dish of Veal that has been roasted. From a joint not overdone cut thin slices, remove the skin and gristle, put some sliced onions and a shalot over the fire with a piece of butter and some flour, fry and shake them. Put in some veal gravy, and a bunch of sweet herbs ; simmer ten minutes; strain off the gravy, and put it to the veal, with some parsley chopped small, and a little grated lemon-peel and nutmeg ; let it simmer one minute, then add the yolks of two eggs, beaten up with two spoonsful of cream, and a very little pepper, and stir over the fire one way, until the same be thick and smooth; squeeze a little lemon-juice in, and serve. To boil Calf’s Head. Clean it very nicely, and soak it in water, that it may look very white ; take out the tongue to salt, and the brains to make a little dish. Boil the head extremely tender ; then strew it over wfith crumbs and chopped pars- ley, and bromr them; or, if liked better, leave one side plain. Bacon and greens are to be served to eat with it. The brains should be soaked in cold water, then boiled; and then mixed wfith melted butter, scalded sage chopped, pepper, and salt, with or without the tongue, w'hich should be Very tender. If any of the head is left, it may be hashed next day, and a few slices of bacon just warmed and put round. Cold calf’s head eats well if grilled. To hash Calf’s Head. When half boiled, cut off the meat in slices, half an inch thick, and two or three inches long : brown some butter, flour, and sliced onion, and throw in the slices wfith some good gravy, truffles, and morels; give it one boil and skim it well, and set it in a moderate heat to simmer till very tender. Season wfith pepper, salt, and F 2DOMESTIC COOKERY. G8 cayenne, at first; and ten minutes before serving throw in some shred parsley, and a very small bit of tarragon and knotted marjoram cut as fine as possible ; just be- fore you serve, add the squeeze of a lemon. Garnish with forcemeat-balls, and bits of bacon rolled round. Another way.—Boil the head almost enough, and take the meat of the best side neatly off the bone with a sharp knife; lay this into a small dish, wash it over with the yolks of two eggs, and cover it with crumbs, a few herbs nicely shred, a little pepper and salt, and a grate of nut- meg, all mixed together first. Set the dish before the fire, and keep turning it now and then, that all parts of the head may be equally brown. In the mean time slice the remainder of the head and the tongue, but first peel the tongue; put a pint of good gravy into a pan, with an onion, a small bunch of herbs, (consisting of parsley, basil, savory, tarragon, knotted marjoram, and a little thyme,) a little salt and cayenne, a shalot, a glass of sherry, and a little oyster liquor. Boil this for a few minutes, and strain it upon the meat, w’hich should be dredged with some flour. Add some mushrooms, either fresh or pickled, a few truffles and morels, and two spoonsful of ketchup; then beat up half the brains, and put this to the rest with a bit of butter and flour. Simmer the whole. Beat the other part of the brains with shred lemon- peel, a little nutmeg and mace, some parsley shred, and an egg. Then fry it in little cakes of a beautiful yellow- browm. Dip some oysters into the yolk of an egg, and do the same; and also some relishing forcemeat-balls made as for mock-turtle. Garnish with these and small bits of bacon j ust made hot before the fire. Calf’s Head fricasseed. Clean and half-boil a head ; cut the meat into small bits, and put it into a tosser, with a little gravy made of the bones, some of the water it was boiled in, a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion, and a blade of mace. If you have any young cockerels in tlie house, use the combs; but first boil them tender, and blanch them ; or a sweet-VEAL. 69 bread will do as well, cut in pretty large dice. Season the gi'avy with a little pepper, nutmeg, and salt, rub down some flour and butter, and give all a boil together ; then take out the herbs and onion, and add. a little cup of cream, but do not boil it in. Serve with small bits of bacon rolled round, and balls. To collar Calf 's Head. Scald the skin of a fine head, clean it nicely, and take out the brains. Boil it tender enough to remove the bones ; then have ready a good quantity of chopped pars- ley, mace, nutmeg, salt, and white pepper, mixed well: season it high with these: lay the parsley in a thick layer, then a quantity of thick slices of fine ham, or a beautifully-coloured tongue skinned, and then the yolks of six nice yellow eggs stuck here and there about. Roll the head quite close, and tie it up as tight as you can. Boil it till the tape slackens, and then lay a weight on it (without removing the bandage) till quite cold. Keep it in a pickle of the liquor, vinegar and salt. A cloth must be put under the tape, as for other collars. Calfs Head stewed. Half boil a very small head with the skin on, cut the flesh in triangular bits, and stew with a brown, but not very rich sauce; serve with forcemeat-balls and mush- rooms, and season with salt, mushroom powder, and a very little cayenne. Calf's Brains May be dressed as follows, and are a pretty and good dish ; — Care must be taken not to cut them in dividing the head; clean particularly nice, and remove all the large fibres and skin; soak them in several warm waters; blanch them, then soak them in lemon juice, in which a bit of chervil has been steeped three hours. Dry them well; dip them in butter and fry them; and serve with the following ;—make hot a ladleful of glaze, some extremely small onions, browned in butter, arti-70 DOMESTIC COOKERY. choke bottoms divided in half, and some mushroom buttons, and serve round the brains; or, after preparing as above, serve in a rich white acidulated sauce with lemon-juice. Calves’ Feet fricasseed. Boil tender two feet in a shallow pan, observing not to break them; throw them into cold water for an hour; divide, and lay them in a little weak veal broth, and simmer them half an hour, with a blade of mace and a bit of lemon-peel; which take out when you add half a tea-cup of cream, and a bit of flour and butter. Or serve them plain boiled, with parsley and butter. Another imy,for a Corner Dish. Boil a large foot tender, split it in half, roll it in warmed butter, then in fine crumbs; then again in butter and crumbs ■, boil it a fine brown, and serve in brown gravy and with pickles. Kidney. Chop veal-kidney, and some of the fat; likewise a little leek or onion, pepper, and salt; roll it up with an egg into balls, and fry them. Calf’s Heart. Stutf and roast the same as beef heart; or, being sliced and seasoned, make it into a pudding as directed for steak or kidney pudding. Calf’s Liver. Slice it, season with pepper and salt, and broil nicely; rub a bit of cold butter on it, and serve hot and hot, with small slices of fat bacon, or on frying herbs, as dressed in Staftbrdshire. (See Vegetables.) Calf’s Liver roasted. Wash and wipe it: then cut a long^ole in it and stuff it with crumbs of bread, chopped anchovy, Iierbs, a good deal of fat bacon, onion, salt, pepper, a bit of butter, and an egg; sew the liver up; then lard it, or71 VEAL. wrap it in a veal-caul, and roast it. Serve wuth good brown gravy and currant-jelly. To dress Liver and Lights. Half-boil an equal quantity of each, then cut them in a middling-size mince, put to it a spoonful or two of the water that boiled it, a bit of butter, flour, salt, and pepper; simmer ten minutes, and serve hot. Siveetbreads, For every mode of dressing, should be prepared by half-boiling, and then putting them in cold water. This, called blanching, makes them whiter and thicker, as well as firmer. To serve plain. Do as above; wet with egg, and sprinkle crumbs, salt, pepper, and chopped parsle}^, and finish dressing in a Dutch oven. Serve with melted butter, with or without a little mushroom ketchup. Sweetbreads roasted. Parboil twm large ones; when cold, lard them with bacon, and roast them in a Dutch oven. For sauce, plain butter and mushroom ketchup. Siveetbreads d-la-daube. Blanch two or three of the largest sweetbreads, lard them with small pieces of bacon. Put them into a stew- pan, w'ith some good veal gravy, a little browning, and the juice of half a lemon ; stew them till quite tender, and just before serving thicken with flour and butter: serve with their gravy, with bunches of boiled celery round. Sweetbreads steioed. After blanching, stuff them with a forcemeat of fowl, fat and lean bacon, an anchovy, nutmeg, lemon-peel, parsley, and a very little cayenne and thyme; when well mixed, add the yolks of two eggs, and fill the sweet- breads. h’astcn them together witl^ splinter-skewers.'72 DOMESTIC COOKERY. and lay them in a pan, with slices of veal over, and bacon under them : season with pepper and salt, mace, cloves, herbs, and sliced onion. Cover close over the fire ten minutes, then add a quart of broth, and stew gently two hours. Take out the sweetbreads, strain and skim the broth, and boil it to half a pint; warm the sweetbreads in it; and serve with lemon round. Sweetbreads fricasseed white. Blanch and slice them: thicken some veal gravy with flour and butter, mixed, a little cream, a little mushroom powder, and add white pepper, nutmeg and grated le- mon-peel ; stew these ingredients together a little, then simmer the sweetbreads twenty minutes. When taken off the fire, add a little salt and lemon-peel; stir well, and serve. Sweetbreads fricasseed brenon. Cut them about the size of a walnut, flour, and fry them of a fine brown; pour to them a good beef gravy, seasoned with salt, pepper, cayenne, and allspice: sim- mer till tender. Thicken with flour and butter. Morels, truffles, and mushrooms may be added, and mushroom ketchup. Sweetbreads, if not served as a separate dish, make a great addition to ragout and fricassees of other meat, cut in slices, or very large dice, with or without tniflles, &c. Likewise, in French or calf’s head pie, &c. Of calf’s feet a delicate and nourishing fricassee is made. The liquor in which they are boiled is used to make- jelly. MUTTON. Observations on Mutton. Take away the pipe that runs along the bone of the inside of a chine of mutton; and if to be kept a long time, rub the part close round the tail witli salt, after first cutting out the kernel. Wipe it, as well as all other meats, daily, but do not take them into a warm kitchen to do it.HUTTON. IS The kernel in the fat on the thick part of the leg should be taken out by the butcher, for it taints first there. The bloody part of the neck shoidd be cut off when first brought in. The brisket changes first in the breast; and if it is to be kept, it is best to rub it with a little salt, should the weather be hot. Every kernel should be taken out of all sorts of meat as soon as brought in : then wipe diy. For roasting, mutton should hang as long as it will keep, the hind-quarters especially, but not so long as to taint; for, whatever fashion may authorize, putrid juices ought not to be taken into the stomach; Imt, by due care and a good larder, meat may be hung long, to the great improvement of its flavour. Mutton for boiling will not look of a good colour if it has hung long. Great care should be taken to preserve by paper the fat of what is roasted. Leg of Mutton. If roasted, serve to eat with it currant-jelly, or onion sauce, salad, and potatoes. Boiled Leg of Mutton. It should soak two hours in cold water, and be boiled in a cloth. Serve with caper sauce, mashed turnips, greens, and carrots. Or, for a small family, two dress- ings may be made thus;—cut off a fillet, as of veal, to roast, with or without stuffing. The knuckle may be stewed with rice or barley for broth; or thus— Mutton d-la-Turc. Wash it nicely in water, and then soak it in vinegar, and without drying, put it into a stewpan with a close cover, laying some skewers in the bottom to prevent the meat from sticking ; put in a bunch of sweet herbs, three middling-sized onions, and as much water as you think will make the stew of a due consistence, a blade of mace, and a few peppercorns. Let it simmer very slowly, and take care the rice does not burn. When74 DOMESTIC COOKERY. the meat is ver}^ tender, take out the onions, herbs, and spice, and heat up in it an ounce of butter, and some salt. Another mode of dividing a Leg of Mutton. Turn the outside of the leg upwards, and, with a small long knife, gently raise up the skin as far as the knuckle, and about six or seven inches wide; and cut two or three slices, either for cutlets or a small pie; mind to leave it smooth, and fasten the skin down wdth small skewers. To dress Haunch of Mutton. Keep it as long as it can be preserved sweet by the different modes directed; let it be washed with warm milk and water, or vinegar, if necessarj'; but when to be dressed, observe to wash it well, lest the outside should have a bad flavour from keeping. Put a paste of coarse flour on strong j^aper, and fold the haunch in j set it in a cradle-spit at a great distance from the fire, and allow proportionable time for the paste; do not take it off till about thirty-five or forty minutes before serving, and then baste it continually. Bring the haunch nearer to the fire before you take off the paste, and froth it up as you would venison. A gravy must be made of a pound and a half of loin of old mutton, simmered in a pint of water to half, and no seasoning but salt: brown it with a little burnt sugar, and send it up in a dish : but there should be a good deal of gravy in the meat; for though long at the fire, the distance and covering will prevent its roasting out. Serve with currant-jelly sauce. Haunch of Blutton to imitate Venison. Choose a hind-quarter of the finest-fed fat mutton; cut it venison-fashion; hang it as long as it will keep; wash it nicely, then lay it in a pan with the back down- wards ; pour on it a bottle of port, mixed with twenty cloves in finest jiowder, and half an ounce of pimento;MUTTON. *75 with which haste it frequently for twenty-four hours; and without washing off the lic^uor, paper and roast as by the last receipt. Baste with butter and wine, &c., and serve with gravy prepared as before, and jelly-sauce. Shoulder of Mutton roasted. Serv'e onion sauce to eat with it; or Queen Mai-y’s sauce, for which see Sauces. To steio Shoulder of Mutton ivith Oysters. Hang it some days, then salt it well for two days; bone it, and sprinkle it with pepper and a bit of mace pounded: lay some oysters over it, and roll the meat up tight and tie it. Stew it in a small quantity of water, with an onion and a few peppercorns, till quite tender. Have ready a little good gravy, and some oysters stewed in it; thicken this with flour and butter, and pour over the mutton when the tape is taken off. The stewpan should be kept close covered. Neck of Mutton Is particularly useful, as so many dishes may be made of it; but it is not advantageous for the family. The bones should be cut short, which the butchers will not do, unless particularly desired. The best end of the neck may be boiled, and served with turnips ; or roasted; or dressed in steaks, in pies, a-la-Turc, or harrico. Tlie scrag may be stewed in broth; or with a small quantity of water, some small onions, a few peppercorns, and a little rice, and served together. Or put into a pie. When a neck is to be boiled to look particularly nice, saw down the chine-bone, strip the ribs half-way down, and chop off the ends of the bones about four inches. The skin should not be taken off till boiled, and then the fat will look whiter. When there is more fat to the neck or loin of mutton than is agreeable to eat with the lean, it makes an un- commonly good suet-pudding, or crust for a meat-pie, if cut very fine.DOMESTIC COOKERY. 76 To roast a Saddle of Multon. Let it be well kept first. Raise the skin, and then skewer it on again; take it oft' a quarter of an hour be- fore serving, sprinkle it with some salt, baste it, and dredge it well with ftour. The rump should be split, and skew'ered back on each side. The joint may be large or small according to the company : it is the most elegant if the latter. Being broad, it requires a high and strong fire. Fillet of Mutton glazed. Take off the chump end of the loin, butter some paper, and put over it, and then paste as for venison; roast it tw'o hours. Do not let it be the least brown. Have ready some French beans boiled, and drained on a sieve ; and while the mutton is being glazed, give them one heat up in the gravy, and lay them on the dish with the meat over them. Harrico. Take off some of the fat, and cut the middle or best end of the neck into rather thin steaks; ftour and fry them in their owm fat of a fine light brown, but not enough for eating. Then put them into a dish while you fiy the carrots, turnips, and onions, the carrots and turnips in dice, the onions sliced: but they must only be warmed, not browned, or you need not fry them. Then lay the steaks at the bottom of a stewpan, the vegetables over them, and pour as much boiling water as wdll just cover them : give one boil, skim well, and then set the pan on the side of the fire to simmer gently till the meat is tender. In three or four hours skim them; and add pepper, salt, and a spoonful of ketchup. To hash Mutton. ' Cut thin slices of dressed mutton, fat and lean; ftour them; have ready a little onion boiled in two or three spoonsful of water; add to it a little gravy and the meat seasoned, and make the hash hot, but not to boil. Serve in a covered dish. Instead of onion, a clove, a spoonfulMUTTOX. 77 of currant-jelly, and half a glass of port -wine, -will give an agreeable flavour of venison, if the meat be fine. Pickled cucumber, or-walnut, cut small, warm in it for change. Serve on sippets of bread. Breast of Mutton. Cut off the superfluous fat, and roast; and serve the meat with stewed cucumbers ; or to eat cold covered with chopped parsley. Or half-boil, and then grill it before the fire; in which case cover it with crumbs and herbs, and serve with caper-sauce. Or if boned, take off a good deal of the fat, and cover it with bread, herbs, and season- ing; then roll and boil till tender: pour over it chopped walnuts in butter. Or make it into a pie. To collar a Breast of Mutton. Bone it, and rub it with the yolk of an egg; strew over it a little grated lemon-peel, pepper and salt; then mix a tea-cupful of -capers, two anchovies, a handful of parsley, a few sweet herbs, all minced fine, and the ■crumb of a penny loaf grated, which spread over the mutton: roll it very tight, boil it two hours, and when cold unbind the tape, and put it into a pickle of strong salt and water one pint, and vinegar half a pint. Loin of Mutton Roasted: if cut lengthwise as a saddle, some think it eats better. Or for steaks, pies, or broth. To roll Loin of Mutton. Hang the mutton till tender: bone it; and lay a sea- soning of pepper, allspice, mace, nutmeg, and a few cloves, all in fine powder, over it. Next day prepare a stuffing as for hare; beat the meat, and cover it with the stuffing; roll it up tight and tie it. Half-bake it in a slow oven; let it grow cold; take off tlie fat, and put the gravy into a stew-pan; flour the meat, and put it in likewise; stew it till almost ready; and add a glass of port wine, some ketchup, and anchovy, and a little lemon pickle, half an hour before serving; serve it inDOMESTIC COOKERY. 78 the. gravy, and with jelly sauce. A few fresh mush- rooms are a great imjjrovement; but if to eat like hare, do not use these, nor the lemon-pickle. Mutton Ham. Choose a fine-grained leg of wether-mutton, of twelve or fourteen pounds weight; let it be cut ham shape, and hang two days. Then put into a stew-pan half a pound of hay-salt, the same of common salt, two ounces of saltpetre, and half a pound of coarse sugar, all in powder; mix, and make it quite hot; then rub it well into the ham. Let it be turned in the liquor every day ; at the end of four days put two ounces more of common salt; in twelve days take it out, dry it, and hang it up in wood-smoke a week. It is to be used in slices, with stewed cabbage, mashed potatoes, or eggs ; or for break- fast relish. Mutton Collops. Take a loin of mutton that has been well hung; and cut from the part next the leg some collops very thin. Take out the sinews. Season the collops with salt, pepper, and mace; and strew over them shred parsley, thyme, and two or three shalots; fi-y them in butter till half done; add half a pint of gravy, a little juice of lemon, and a piece of butter rubbed in flour; and sim- mer the whole very gently five minutes. They should be served immediately, or they will be hard. Mutton Cutlets in the Portuguese way. Cut chops, and half-fry them with sliced shalot or onion, chopped parsley, and two bay-leaves; season with pepper and salt; then lay a forcemeat on a piece of white paper, put the cho]) on it, and twist the paper up, leaving a hole for the end of the bones to go through. Broil on a gentle fire. Serve with sauce Robart; or, as the seasoning makes the cutlets high, a little gravy.

Steaks of Mutton or Lamb, and Cucumbers. Quarter cucumbers, and lay them into a deep dish, sprinkle them with salt; and pour vinegar over them. Fry the chops of a fine brown, and put them into a stewpan ; drain the cucumbers and put over the steaks; add some sliced onions, pepper and salt; pour hot water or w'eak broth on them ; stew and skim well. If the gravy be not thick enough, put in a bit of butter rolled in a little Hour. Mutton Steaks Maintenon. Half-fry; stew them while hot, with herbs, crumbs, and seasoning; put them in paper immediately, and finish on the gridiron. Be careful the paper does not catch: rub a bit of butter on it first, to prevent that. Serve in the paper, and send up plain butter in a boat. To dress Mutton Rumps and Kidneys. Stew six rumps in some good mutton-gravy . half an hour; then take them up, and let them stand to cool. Clear the gravy from the fat; and put into it four ounces of boiled rice, an onion stuck with cloves, and a blade of mace; boil them till the rice is thick. Wash the rumps ■with yolks of eggs well beaten; and strew over them crumbs of bread, a little pepper and salt, chopped parsley and thyme, and grated lemon-peel. Fry in butter of a fine brown. While the rumps are stewing, lard the kidneys, and put them to roast in a Dutch oven. When the rumps are fried, the grease must be drained before they are put on the dish, and the pan being cleared likewise from the fat, warm the rice in it. Lay the lat- ter on the dish; the rumps put round on the rice, the narrow ends towards the middle, and the kidneys between. Garnish with hard eggs cut in half, the white being left: on; or with different coloured pickles.DOMESTIC COOKERY. so Scotch Hatch Patch.

Joint it at every bone: mix a small nutmeg grated with a little salt and pepper, crumbs, and herbs; dip the steaks into the yolks of three eggs, and sprinkle the above mixture all over them. Then place the steaks together as they were before they were cut asunder, tie them, and fasten them on a small spit. Roast them at a quick fire; set a dish under, and baste them with a good piece of butter, and the liquor that comes from the meat; but throw some more of the above seasoning over.

The loin fried in steaks and served round, garnished with dried or fried parsley : spinach to eat with it: or dressed separately, or roasted. A hind-cpiarter of lamb is rarely roasted, but if fat and young it is infinitely more juicy and well-flavoured than the fore-cjuarter, or either joint dressed separately. Fore-quarter of Lamb. Roast it, either whole or in separate parts. If left to be cold, chopped parsley should be sprinkled over it. The neck ancl breast together are called a scoven. Breast of Lamb and Cucumbers.

Fry them of a beautiful brown; when to be served, throw over them a good quantity of crumbs of bread fried, and crimped parsley; the receipt for doing which of a fine colour will be given under the head of Vegetables. M Litton or lamb steaks, seasoned and broiled in but- tered papers either with crumbs and herbs, or Avithout, are a genteel dish, and eat well. Sauce for them, called sauce Robart, will be found in the list of Sauces. House-lamb Steaks, white. Stew them in milk and water till very tender, with a bit of lemon-peel, a little salt, some pepper and mace. Have ready some veal gravy, and put the steaks into it; mix some mushroom powder, a cup of cream, and the least bit of flour; shake the steaks in this liquor, stir' it, and let it get quite hot, but not boil. Just before you take it up, put in a few white mushrooms. This is a good substitute W'hen poultry is very dear. House-lamb Steaks, brown.

Cut the steaks from the loin, and fry them : the spi- nach is to be stewed and put into the dish first, and then the cutlets round it. Lamb’s Head and Hinge. Tliis part is best from a house-lamb; but any, if soaked in cold water, will be .white. Boil the head separately till very tender. Have ready the liver and lights three parts boiled and cut small •, stew them in a little of the water in which they were boiled, season and thicken with flour and butter, and serve the mince round the head. Lamb’s Fry. Serve it fried of a beautiful colour, and with a good deal of dried or fried parsley over it. Melted butter in a tureen. Lamb’s Sweetbreads.

Put this over the fire, and stir it well till it is hot, and looks white; but do not let it boil, or it will curdle. Then put it in the fry, and shake it about near the fire for a minute or two. Serve in a very hot dish and cover. Fricassee of Lamh-stones and Siveeibreads, another way. Have ready some lamb-stones blanched, parboiled, and sliced.

Then place the edge of one steak on another with the small bone upward, all round the potatoes. An Indian Burdwan Stew. Cut up in slices ready-dressed lamb or veal, or in joints a fowl; put it into a stewpan with two sjioonsful of anchovy essence, three ditto of white wine, an ounce of butter rubbed in flour, an onion sliced thin, and a little cayenne. Cover very close, stew till perfectly tender; squeeze a lime, or lemon, over it in the dish. Kice may be served as with currie.85 FORK. PORK. Bacon hogs and porkers are differently cut up. Porkers are not so old as hogs; their flesh is whiter, less rich, and not so tender. It is divided into four quarters. The fore-quarter has the spring, or fore-leg, the fore-loin, or neck, and the belly-piece. The hind- quarter has the leg and loin. The w'ay to dress the joints will he hereafter given. The hog is kept to a larger size ; if it become extremely fat, it is not so con- venient in the family of a gentleman as to farmers. The chine of a hog, or its backbone, is cut down on each side the whole length, and is a prime part, either salted and boiled, or roasted. It will afford three or four- dressings, according to the size of the animal, and to the quantity that may be required. The sides of the hog are made into bacon : the inside being cut out, with very little meat attached to the bone. On each side there is a large spare-rib, (which is usually divided into two,) one blade bone, and a sweet bone. The bacon is the whole outside, and contains the fore-leg, the hind-leg or ham, and the intermediate parts, which, all together, is called a flitch, or side of bacon. If the ham be not taken off, it is called the gammon. There are also griskins. Hog’s lard is the inner fat. Pickled pork is made of the flesh of the hog, as well as of the younger pig; that of the latter does not keep so long in salt as the former. The bacon hog is sometimes scalded, sometimes singed; the porker is always scalded. The feet of pork make various good dishes, and should he cut off before the legs are cured. Observe the same of the ears. The flesh of young pork is generally hard: if half boiled before it be roasted, this inconvenience would be obviated. To •pickle Pork. The following proportions are for the middle parts of a ■pretty large hog, the hams and shoulders being cut out.DOMESTIC COOKERY. 86 Mix, finely pounded, four ounces of saltpetre, a pound of coarse sugar, and two ounces of sal-prunella. The pork having been well sprinkled with common salt, and left to drain twenty-four hours, wipe it quite drv, then rub in the above salts, mixed with four pounds of large salt, laying the pieces into the pan or tub. In two days rub each piece well with the pickle, and pack as closely as possible. Place large pebbles on the pork to prevent it from swimming in the liquor which the salt will produce. If kept from the air, it will continue good a whole year. Tlie meat of young porkers eats deliciously pickled, but it takes the salt so readily, that it wiU not be long in perfection : it requires only a little salt, and a small pro- portion of saltpetre, if to be eaten soon. N.B. The sal-prunella makes the fat look very clear. To roast a Leg of Pork. Choose a small leg of fine young pork : cut a slit in the knuckle with a sharp knife; and fill the space with sage and onion chopped, and a little pepper and salt. When half-done, score the skin in slices, but do not cut deeper than the outer rind. Apple-sauce and potatoes should be served to eat with it. To boil a Leg of Pork. Salt it eight or ten days, turning it daily, but do not rub it after the first. When to be dressed weigh it: let it lie half an hour in cold water to make it white : allow a quarter of an hour for every pound, and half an hour over from the time it boils up : skim it as soon as it boils, and frequently after; but do not boil it fast, or it will be hard. Allow water enough. Save some of it to make peas-soup. Some boil it in a very nice cloth, floured; which gives a very delicate look. Serve peas- pudding and turnips with it. Loin and Neck of Pork May be roasted, and served with the same accompani-PORK. 87 ments as the leg; used for steaks, or boiled. It eats excellently in the following way :— Simmer the best end of either of the joints till nearly fit to eat; strip off the skin, put it in a little cradle spit, wet it all over with yolks of eggs, and thickly cover it with bread-crumbs; stuffing-herbs and chives chopped fine, pepper and salt mixed. About a quarter of an hour will make it a beautiful colour. If convenient thus to dress a piece that has been lightly salted a few days, leave out the salt in seasoning. Shoulders and Breasts of Pork. Put them into pickle, or salt the shoulder as a ham, cut accordingly. When very nice, they may be roasted. Rolled Neck of Pork. Bone it, put a forcemeat of chopped sage, a very few crumbs of bread, salt, pepper, and two or three berries of allspice, over the inside; then roll the meat as tight as you can, and roast it slowly, and at a good distance at first from the fire. To parboil it before the herbs are put on, will be an improvement. Spring or Forehand of Pork. Cut out the bone; sprinkle salt, pepper, and sage dried, over the inside; but first warm a little butter to baste it and then flour it; roll the pork tight, and tie it; then roast by a hanging jack. About two hours will do it. Sparerih Should be basted with a very little butter and a little flour, and then sprinkled with dried sage crumbled. Apple-sauce and potatoes for roasted pork. Pork Grishin Is usually very hard : the best way to prevent this is to put it into as much cold water as will cover it, and let it boil up; then instantly take it ofl’, and put it into a DutchDOMESTIC COOKERY. 88 oven : a very few minutes will do it. Remember to rub butter over it, and then flour it, before you put it to the fire. Lay it in a dish on melted butter and mustard. It should be seasoned with pepper and salt before roasting. Blade-bone of Pork Is taken from the bacon-hog; the less meat left on it, in moderation, the better. It is to be broiled; and when just done, pepper and salt it. Put to it a piece of butter, j and a tea-spoonful of mustard; and serve it covered, j quickly. This is a Somersetshire dish. To dress Pork as Lamb. Kill a young pig of four or five months; dress the : fore-quarters trussed with the shank-bone close, having taken off the skin. Serve with mint-sauce and salad. The other parts will make delicate pickled pork, steaks, or pies. Pork-steaks. Cut them from a loin or neck, and of middling thick- ness ; heat the lean part with a broad knife; pepper and | broil them, turning them often : when nearly done, put on salt, rub a bit of butter over, and serve the moment. they are taken off the fire, a few at a time. To scald a sucking Pig. The moment the pig is killed, put it into cold water for a few minutes: then rub it over with a little resin, beaten extremely small, and put it into a pail of scald- ing water half a minute; take it out, lay it on a table, and pull off the hair as quickly as possible: if any part does not come off, put it in again. When quite clean, wash it well with warm water, and then in two or three j cold waters, that no flavour of the resin may remain. | Take off all the feet at the first joint; make a slit down I the belly, and take out the entrails: put the liver, heart, ' and lights, to the feet. Wash the pig well in cold water, < dry it thoroughly, and fold it in a wet cloth to keep it from the air.FORK. 89 To roast a Sucking Pig. If you can get it when just killed, this is of great ad- vantage. Let it be scalded, which the dealers usually do; then put some sage, a large piece of stalish white bread, salt, and pepper, into the belly, and sew it up. Observe to skewer the legs hack, or the under part will not crisp. Lay it to a brisk fire till thoroughly dry; then have ready some butter in a dry cloth, and rub the pig with it in every part. Dredge as much flour over as wll possibly he, and do not touch it .again till ready to serve; then scrape off the flour very carefully with a blunt knife, rub the pig Avell with a buttered cloth, and take off the head while at the fire: take out the brains, and mi.\ them with the gravy that comes from the pig. Then take it up, and, without withdrawing the spit, cut it down the hack and belly, lay it into the dish, and chop the sage and bread quickly as fine as you can, and mi.v them Avith a large quantity of fine melted butter that has A'ery little Hour. Put the sauce into the dish after the pig has been split doAvn the back, and garnished with the ears and the two jaAvs : take off the upper part of the head doAvn to the snout. In Devonshire it is served Avhole, if very small; the head only being cut off to garnish as above. It will require from an hour to an hour and a half to roast. Pettitoes. Boil them, the liver, and the heart, in a small quantity of Avater, very gently; then cut the meat fine, and sim- mer it Avith a little of the Avater and the feet split, till the feet are quite tender; thicken Avith a bit of butter, a little flour, a spoonful of cream, and a little salt and pepper ; give it a boil up, pour it over a fcAv sippets of bread, and put the feet on the mince. To make excellent mock Brawn. Split and nicely clean a hog’s head; take out the brains, cut off the cars, and rub a good deal of salt into90 DOMESTIC COOKERY. the head; let it drain twenty-four hours; then lay upon it two ounces of saltpetre, and the same of common salt; in three days’ time lay the head and salt into a pan, with just water to cover it, for two days more. Wash it well; and boil until the bones will come out; remove them, and chop the meat, as quick as possible, in pieces of an inch long ; but first take the skin care- fi-dly off the head and the tongue; the latter cut in bits as above. Season with pepper and salt. Put the skin of one side of the head into a small long pan, press the chopped head and tongue into it, and lay the skin of the other side of the head over, and press it down. When cold, it will turn out, and make a kind of brawn. The head may probably be too fat, in which case prepare a few bits of lean jiork with the head. Boil two ounces of salt, a pint of vinegar, and a quart of the liquor, and, Avhen cold, pom' it over the head. The ears are to be boiled longer than the head, cut in thin strips, and di- vided about it, the hair being nicely removed. Re-boil the pickle often. Another mock Brawn, Boil a pair of neat’s feet very tender ; take the meat off, and have ready the belly-piece of pork, salted with common salt and saltpetre for a week. Boil this almost enough; take out the bones, and roll the feet and the pork together. Then roll it very tight with a strong cloth and coarse tape. Boil it till very tender, then hang it up in the cloth till cold ; after which keep it in a sousing liquor, as is directed in the next page. To collar Pig's Head. Scour the head and ears nicely; take off the hair and snout, and take out the eyes and the brains; lay it into water one night; then drain, salt it extremely well with common salt and saltpetre, and let it lie five days. Boil it enough to take out the bones; then lay it on a dresser, turning the thick end of one side of the head towards the thin end of the other, to make the roll of equal size; sprinkle it well with salt and white pepper, and roll it91 PORK. with the ears; and if you approve, put the pig’s feet round the outside when boned, or the thin parts of two cow-heels. Put it into a cloth, bind with a broad tape, and boil it till quite tender; then put a good weight upon it, and do not take off the covering till cold. If you choose it to be more like brawn, salt it longer, let the proportion of saltpetre be greater, and put in also some pieces of lean pork; and then cover it with cow- heel to look like the horn. This may be kept either in or out of pickle of salt and water boiled, with vinegar; and is a very convenient thin" to have in the house. O If likely to spoil, slice and fry it either with or with- out butter. To keep Braion, the Cambridge loay. To two gallons of water put one pound of wheat-bran, and a pound of salt; boil one hour; when cold, strain it, and keep the brawn in it. In ten or twelve days fresh pickle will be required. If, by length of carriage or neglect, the brawn be kept too long out of pickle, make as above, and having rubbed it well with salt, and washed with some of the pickle, it will be quite restored to its former goodness. An excellent Sauce for Brawn, or Pig’s Feet and Ears. Boil a quarter of a peck of wheat-bran, a sprig of bay, and a sprig of rosemary in two gallons of water, with four ounces of salt in it, for half an hour. Strain it, and let it get cold. To roast a Porker’s Head, Choose a fine young head, clean it well, remove the eyes and snout, and put bread and sage as for pig; sew it up tight, and on a string, or hanging jack, roast it as a pig, and serve with the same sauce. To prepare Pig’s Cheek for boiling. Cut off the snout, and clean the head; divide it, and take out the eyes and the brains; sprinkle the head with92 DOMESTIC COOKERY. salt, and let it drain twenty-four hours. Salt it with common salt and saltpetre: let it lie eight or ten days if to he dressed without stewing with peas, hut less if to he dressed with peas; and it must be washed first, and then simmered till all is tender. Serve with greens and carrots. To force Hogs^ Ears. Parboil two pair of ears, or take some that have been soused: make a forcemeat of an anchovy, a little finely minced veal, some sage, parsley, a quarter of a pound of suet chopped, bread-crumbs, pepper, and only a little salt. Mix all these with the yolks of two eggs; raise the skin of the upper side of the ears, and stuff them with the above. Fry the ears in fresh butter, of a fine colour; then pour away the fat, and drain them : make ready half a pint of rich gravy, wdth a glass of fine sherry, three tea-spoonsful of made mustard, a little bit of flour and butter, a small onion whole, and a little pepper or cayenne. Put these, with the ears, into a stewpan, and cover it close; stew it gently for half an hour, shaking the pan often. When done enough, take out the onion, place the ears carefully in a dish, and pour the sauce over them. If a larger dish is wanted, the meat from two feet may be taken from the bones, and added to the above. Pigs’’ Feet and Ears soiised. Clean carefully, soak them some hours, then boil them tender; and having prejiared a pickle of some of the liquor that they were boiled in, and a quarter part of vinegar and salt, boiled, pour over them cold. When to be dressed, dry them, cut the feet in two, slice the ears and fry them. Serve with butter, mustard, and vinegar, in a boat. They may be dipped in batter, or only floured.

Take feet and ears that have been boiled, but not kept ill pickle wherein was vinegar; boil them tender93 PORK. in milk, cut the feet into neat hits, and the ears into strips of half an inch wide: wipe them, and simmer in veal hroth, with a bit of onion, mace, and lemon-peel. Before you serve, add a little cream, flour, and butter; boil up, and then salt. Jelly of Pigs’ Feet and Ears. Clean and prepare as in the last article, then boil them in a very small quantity of water till every hone can be taken out; throw in half a handful of chopped sage, the same of parsley, and a seasoning of pepper, salt, and mace in fine powder; simmer till the herbs are scalded, then pour the whole into a melon-form. Pigs’ Harslet. Wash and dry some liver, sweetbreads, and fat and lean bits of pork, heating the latter with a rolling-pin to make it tender: season with pepper, salt, sage, and a little onion shred fine; when mixed, put all into a caul, and fasten it up tight with a needle and thread. Roast it on a hanging jack, or by a string. Or serve in slices, with parsley for a fry. Serve with a sauce of port wine and water, and mus- tard, just boiled up, arid put into a dish. To make Black Puddings. The blood must be stirred with salt till cold. Put a quart of it, or rather more, to a quart of whole grits, to soak one night; and soak the crumb of a quartern loaf in rather more than two quarts of new milk made hot. In the mean time prepare the guts by washing, turning, and scraping, with salt and water, and changing the water several times. Chop fine a little winter-savory and thyme, a good quantity of pennyroyal, pepper, and salt, a few cloves, some allspice, ginger, and nutmeg; mix these with three pounds of beef-suet, and six eggs well beaten and strained; and then heat the bread, grits, &c., all up with the seasoning: when well mixed, have ready some hog’s fat cut into large bits; and as you fill the skins, put it in at proper distances. Tie in links94 DOMESTIC COOKERY. only half filled; and boil in a large kettle, pricking them as they swell, or they will burst. When boiled, lay them between clean cloths till cold, and hang them up in the kitchen. When to he used, scald them a few minutes in water, wipe, and put them into a Dutch oven. If there are not skins enough, put the stuffing into basins, and boil it covered with flour cloths ; and slice and fry it when used. Another way. Soak all night a quart of bruised grits in as much boiling hot milk as will swell them and leave half a pint of liquid. Chop a good quantity of pennyroyal, some savory and thyme; salt, pepper, and allspice finely pow^dered. Mix the above with a quart of the blood, prepared as before directed; then half fill the skins, after they have been cleaned thoroughly, and put as much of the leaf (that is, the inward fat) of the pig as will make it pretty rich. Boil as before directed. A small quantity of leeks, finely shred and well mixed, is a great improvement. Another way. Boil a quart of half-grits in as much milk as will swell them to the utmost; then drain them, and add a quart of blood, a pint of rich cream, a pound of suet, some mace, nutmeg, allspice, and four cloves, all in fine- powder ; two pounds of the hog’s leaf cut into dice, two leeks, a handful of parsley, ten leaves of sage, a large handful of pennyroyal, and a sprig of thyme and knotted marjoram, all minced fine; eight eggs u-ell beaten, half a pound of bread crumbs that have been scalded with a pint of milk, pepper and salt. Half fill the skins, which must first be cleaned with the greatest care, turned several times, and soaked in several waters, and last in rose-water. Tie the skins in links, boil, and prick them with a clean fork, to prevent their bursting. Cover them with a clean cloth till cold.PORK. 95 Excellent Hogs' Pudding, without Blood. Boil a quart of grits in as much milk as will swell them; then add to them a pint of rich cream, a pound of the liver half boiled, and minced fine, half a pound of beef-suet, two blades of mace, a nutmeg, six cloves, a dessert spoonful of white pepper, the same quantity of allspice, a large spoonful of salt, all in finest powder, a large handful of parsley, ten leaves of sage, a large handful of pennyroyal, a sprig of thyme, of knotted marjoram, and of winter-savory, two leeks, and half a fea-spoonful of shalot, or garlic, all mixed fine; eight eggs well beaten, half a pound of crumbs of bread that have been scalded in milk, and two pounds and a half of the hog’s fat; mix well, and add, if wanting, milk to make the stuflSng of a due thickness. Fill and boil as before directed. Another and plainer way, exceedingly good. Half boil the lights, kidneys, and heart; then chop them small, and mix with a proportion of fat, grits boiled in milk, pepper, salt, and pimenta, in finest powder; and fill the skins when nicely cleaned. Pennyroyal and a small proportion of leek will improve the mixture, according to some tastes. White Hogs' Puddings. When the skins have been soaked and cleaned as be- fore directed, rinse and soak them all night in rose- W'ater, and put into them the following filling : mix half a pound of blanched almonds cut into seven or eight bits, with a pound of grated bread, two pounds of beef marrow or suet, a pound of currants, some beaten cin- namon, cloves, mace, and nutmeg, a quart of cream, the yolks of six and whites of two eggs, a little orange- flower water, a little fine Lisbon sugar, and some lemon- peel and citron sliced, and half fill the skins. To know whether sweet enough, warm a little in a panikin. In boiling, much care must be taken to prevent the pud- dings from bursting. Prick them with a small fork as96 DOMESTIC COOKERY. they rise, and boil them in milk and water. Lay them in a table-cloth till cold. Hogs' Lard Should be carefully melted in a jar put into a kettle of water and boiled: run it into bladders that have been extremely well cleaned. The smaller they are the better the lard keeps; as, after the air reaches it, it becomes rank. Put in a sprig of rosemary when melting. This being a most useful article for frying fish, it should be prepared with care. Mixed with butter, it makes fine crust. To dry Hogs' Cheeks. Cut out the snout, remove the brains, and split the head, taking off the upper bone, to make the chawl a good shape ; rub it well with salt; next day take away the brine, and salt it again the following day; cover the head with half an ounce of saltpetre, two ounces of bay- salt, a little common salt, and four ounces of coarse sugar. Let the head be often turned; and after ten days, smoke it for a week like bacon, in a bit of thin cloth. To cure Hams. Hang them a day or two ; then sprinkle them with a little salt, and drain them another day; pound an ounce and a half of saltpetre, the same quantity of bay-salt, half an ounce of sal-prunella, and a pound of the coarsest sugar. Mix these well: rub them into each ham every day for four days, and turn it. If a small one, turn it every day for three w^eeks; if a large one, a week longer; but do not rub after four days. Before you dry it, drain and cover wdth bran. Smoke it ten days. Another xoay. Choose the leg of a hog that is fat and well fed; hang and sprinkle it as above; if large, put to it a pound of bay-salt, four ounces of saltpetre, a jiound of the coarsest sugar, and a handful of common salt, all in fine powder.PORK, 97 and rub it thoroughly. Lay the rind downwards, and cover the fleshy parts with the salts. Baste it as often as you can with the pickle; the more the better. Keep it four weeks, turning it every day. Drain it, and throw bran over it; then hang it in a chimney where wood is burnt, and turn it sometimes for ten days. Another way. Hang the ham, and sprinkle it with salt as above; then rub it eveiy day with the following, in fine powder : half a pound of common salt, the same quantity of bay- salt, two ounces of saltpetre, and two ounces of black pepper, mixed with a pound and a half of treacle. Turn it twice a day in the pickle, for three weeks. Lay it into a pail of water for one night, wipe it quite dry, and smoke it two or three weeks. Another way, that gives a higher flavour. When the weather will permit, hang the ham three days; mix an ounce of saltpetre with a cpiarter of a pound of bay-salt, the same quantity of common salt, and also of coarse sugar, and a quart of strong beer; boil them together, and pour them immediately upon the ham; turn it twice a day in the pickle for three weeks. An ounce of black pepper, and the same quantity of all- spice, in fine powder, added to the above, will give still more flavour. Cover it with bran when wiped ; and smoke it from three to four weeks, as you a])prove : the latter will make it harder, and give it more of the flavour of Westphalia. Sew hams in hessings (that is, coarse wrappers). Let it be smoked by wood, or over smother- ing smoke, made by wet straw and horse-litter. A method of giving a still higher flavour. Sprinkle the ham with salt, after it has hung two or three days; let it drain; make a pickle of a quart of strong beer, half a pound of treacle, an ounce of co- riander-seeds, two ounces of juniper-berries, an ounce of pepper, the same quantity of allspice, an ounce of salt- petre, half an ounce of sal-prunel, a handful of common II98 DOMESTIC COOKERY. salt, and a head of shalot, all pounded or cut fine. Boil these all together a few minutes, and pour them over the ham: this quantity is for one of ten pounds. Rub and turn it every day for a fortnight; then sew it up in a thin linen hag, and smoke it three weeks. Take care to drain it from the pickle, and rub it in bran before drying. To make a Pickle that will keep for years, for Hams, Tongues, or Beef, if boiled and skimmed between each parcel of them. To two gallons of spring water put two pounds of coarse sugar, two pounds of bay and two pounds and a half of common salt, and half a pound of saltpetre, in a deep earthen glazed pan that will hold four gallons, and with a cover that will fit close. Keep the beef or hams as long as they will bear, before you put them into the pickle; and sprinkle them with coarse sugar in a pan, from which they must drain. Rub the hams, &c., w^ell with the pickle, and pack them in close; putting as much as the pan will hold, so that the pickle may cover them. The pickle is not to be boiled at first. A small ham may lie fourteen days, a large one three weeks; a tongue twelve days, and beef in proportion to its size. They will eat well out of the pickle without drying. When they are to be dried, let each piece be drained over the pan ; and when it will drop no longer, take a clean sponge and dry it thoroughly. Six or eight hours will smoke them, and there should be only a little saw- dust and wet straw burnt to do this; but if put into a baker’s chimney, sew them in a coarse cloth, and hang them a week. Add two pounds of common salt and two pints of water every time you boil the liquor. To dress Hams. If long hung, and very hard, put the ham into water a night, and then let it lie either in a hole dug in the earth, or on stones sprinkled with water, two or three days, to mellow; covering it with a heavy tub to keep99 PORK. vermin from it. In either case, let it be put into a linen bag, and carefully covered. Wash and brush it well; put it into a boiler of water, and let it simmer from three hours and a half to five hours, according to its size. It is best to allow time enough, as it is easy to take up the ham when done, and keep it hot over boiling water, covered closely. Take oft’ the skin as whole as you can, as it keeps the cold ham moist. Stew raspings over the ham, and garnish with carrot sliced. It should be carefully pared, before boiling, to remove the rusty parts. If some cloves, bay and laurel leaves, and a bunch of herbs be boiled with a ham, it will have a fine flavour. If to be braised, cover it well with meat in slices, over and under, and put in roots and spices. The water, with which it is to be completely covered, to dress it, will be an excellent addition for brown sauce or soups, instead of plain water. The manner of curing W~iltshire Bacon. Sprinkle each flitch with salt, and let the blood drain off for twenty-four hours. Then mix a pound and a half of coarse sugar, the same quantity of bay-salt, six ounces of saltpetre, and four pounds of coarse salt; rub this well on the bacon, turning and wetting it in every part, daily, for a month ; then hang it to dry, and after- wards smoke it ten days. The above quantity of salt is sufficient for a whole hoff, of about seven or eight score. V./ 7 O Another %oay. Take off all the inside fat of a side of a well-fed hog, lay it on a long board or dresser, rub it well with com- mon salt, and let it lie a day, that the blood may drain from it. Beat fine a pound of bay-salt and four ounces of saltpetre, and mix. these with two pounds of the coarsest sugar, and a quarter of a peck of common coarse Salt. Lay the pork on some tray that will hold the pickle; or, if you have not that convenience, the side may be divided into two, after the ham is taken off, and100 DOMESTIC COOKERY. then a large pan will contain it. Rub the salt well into the pork, lay the skin downwards, and baste it every day with the pickle for a fortnight; then drain it dry, hang it over wood, smoke a few days, and keep it after- wards in a dry hut not hot place. Hams and bacon should hang clear of every thing, and not touch a wall. Observe to wipe the blood from the pork before it be put into the pickle. If kept in the kitchen, or in a damp place, it W'ill become rusty. If bacon and hams are put into a bag of coarse hessings while smoking, they w'ill be preserved from the soot of the chimney j after which they should be covered wth coarse paper, and kept from the air. In the vicinity of the sea, or in any damp situations, bacon does not keep well; it will in that case be found convenient to keep the pork in pickle, and dry such a piece, fresh and fresh, as shall be used in a month or two. The pickle must comjiletely cover the meat, w’hich should be pressed dowm by very large pebbles. S.\USAGES, &c. Veal Sausages. Chop equal quantities of lean veal and fat bacon, a handful of sage, a little salt and pepper, and a few an- chovies, beat all in a mortar; and when used, roll and fry it, and serve it with fried sippets, or on stewed vege- tables, or on white collops. Mutton Sausages. Take a pound of the rawest part of the leg of mutton that has been either roasted or boiled; chop it extremely small, and season it w'ith pepper, salt, mace, and nut- meg : add to it six ounces of beef-suet, some sweet herbs, two anchovies, and a pint of oysters, all chopped very small; a quarter of a pound of grated bread, some of the | anchovy-liquor, and the yolks and whites of tw'o eggs | well beaten. Put it all, when well mixed, into a little f pot, and use it by rolling it into balls, or sausage-shape, I101 SAUSAGES. and frjdng. If approved a little shalot may be added, or garlic, which is a great improvement. Pork Sausages. Chop fat and lean pork together; season it with sage, pepper, and salt, and you may add two or three berries of allspice; half Jill hog’s guts that have been soaked and made extremely clean : or the meat may be kept in a very small pan closely covered; and so rolled and dusted with a very little flour before it is fried. Serve on stewed red cabbage; or mashed potatoes put in a form, browned with a salamander, and garnished with the above. They must be pricked with a fork before they are dressed, or they will burst. An excellent Sausage to eat cold.. Season fat and lean pork with some salt, saltpetre, black pepper, and allspice, all in fine powder, and rub into the meat; the sixth day cut it small, and mix with it some shred shalot or garlic, as fine as possible. Have ready an ox-gut that has been scoured, salted, and soaked well, and fill it with the above stuffing; tie up the ends, and hang it to smoke as you w’ould hams, but first wrap it in a fold or two of old muslin. It must be high-dried. Some eat it without boiling, but others like it boiled first. The skin should be tied in difi’erent places, so as to make each link about eight or nine inches long. Spadburifs Oxford Sausages. Chop a pound and a half of pork, and the same of veal, cleared of skin and sinews; add three-quarters of a pound of beef suet; mince and mix them; steep the crumb of a penny-loaf in water, and mix it with the meat, with also a little dried sage, pepper, and salt. Portuguese Sausages. From the back and loins of a fine tw'o-year-old porker cut all the fat and lean into pieces about an inch square. Season with Spanish or red pepper, black pepper, salt,102 DOMESTIC COOKERY. and garlic, beat all fine together; then cover the mixture with any sort of wfine which is not sweet, adding more as the former is absorbed, for eight days. Fill the largest skins you can get with the meat, fat and lean alternately, occasionally adding some of the w'ine. Tie up in links, and hang them in a room w'here they will not get damp, or become too dry, and they will keep twelve months. They are served boiled or fried, to eat with white meat as a relish. j Sausages of cold Veal, Turkey, or Fowl. \ Of either of the above minces three spoonsful, two | ditto of suet, one ditto of gTated bread, one ditto of '| ham, a little parsley,, lemon-thyme, and chives. Mix these with a little pepper, salt, and a small bit of pounded mace, the yolk of an egg, and half a tea-spoon- ful of flour. Roll and fry to garnish a fricassee, or j minced veal. 1 Rissoles. j Chop the white part of a chicken that has been dressed, 1 or any white meat; add a very little lemon-peel, onion, ] white pepper, salt, nutmeg, and mace; mix all wfith a little butter, and a spoonful of cream; wrap the mince i up in a thin puff-paste in the form of sausages, rub them over with the yolk of egg, and cover them with crumbs of bread grated very fine. Fry of a light brown, and serve them in crimped parsley. They may be done without paste, but must be mixed with an egg to bind, the mince, and be wetted w’ith another on the surface, as they require more crumbs. Croquets may be made of the same ingredients as rissoles, but rolled into a thin paste of flour and water, and fried.103 POULTllY, GAME, &C. PART III. POULTRY, GAME, &c. To choose Poultry^ Game, ^c. A Turkey Cock.-—If young, it has a smooth black leg, ■with a short spur. If fresh, the eyes full and bright, and the feet supple and moist. If stale, the eyes ■will be sunk, and the feet dry. Hen-Turkey is known by the same rules; but if old, her legs will be red and rough. Fowls.—If a cock is young, his spurs will be short; but take care to see they have not been cut or pared, which is a trick often practised. His comb should be a bright red. If fresh, the vent vAll be close and dark. Pullets are best just before they begin to lay, and yet are full of egg : if old hens, their combs and legs will be rough; if young, they will be smooth. A good capon has a thick belly and a large rump : there is a particular fat at his breast, and the comb is very pale. Black- legged fowls are most juicy, therefore to be preferred for roasting Geese.—The. bill and feet of a young one will be yel- low, and there will be but few hairs upon them; if old, they will be red: if fresh, the feet will be pliable; if stale, dry and stiff. Those that are thick in the breast, moderately fat, and the fat a good colour, are the best. Geese are called green till three or four months old. Green geese should be scalded; a stubble goose should be picked dry. Ducks.—Choose them by the same rules, of having supple feet, and by their being hard and thick on the breast and belly. The feet of a tame duck are thick.DOMESTIC COOKERY. 104 and inclining to dusky yellow; a wild one has the feet reddish, and smaller than the tame. They should be picked dry. Ducklings must he scalded. Pigeons should be very fresh; when they look flabby about the vent, and that part is discoloured, they are stale. The feet should be supple; if old, the feet are harsh. The tame ones are larger than the wild, and are thought best by some persons; they should be fat and tender; but many are deceived in their size, because a full crop is as large as the whole body of a small pigeon. The flesh of the wood pigeon is dark-coloured : if pro- perly kept, the flavour is equal to teal. Plovers.—Choose those that feel hard at the vent, which shows they are fresh. In other respects choose them by the same marks as other fowl. When stale, the feet are dry. They will keep sweet a long time, and are better for hanging. There are three sorts; the gray, green, and bastard plover, or lapwing. p[are or Rabbit.—If the claws are hlunt and rugged, the ears dry and tough, and the haunch thick, it is old ; hut if the claws are smooth and sharp, the ears easily tear, and the cleft in the lip is not much spread, it is young. If fresh and newly killed, the body w-ill be stiff, and, in hares, the flesh pale. But they keep a good •while by proper care; and are best when rather begin- ning to turn, if the inside is preserved from being musty. To know a real leveret, you should look for a knob, or small bone, near the foot on its fore-leg; if there is none, it is a hare. Partridges.—They are in season in autumn. If young, the bill is of a dark colour, and the legs yellowish; if fresh, the vent will be firm; but this part will look greenish if stale. Pheasants.—The cock-bird is accounted best, except when the hen is with egg. If young, he has short blunt105 POULTRY, GAME, &C. General Directions for Poultry and Game. All poultry should be very carefully picked, every plug be removed, and the hair nicely singed off with white paper. Contrary to the usual custom, all poultry should he drawn as soon as killed, or at least as soon as bought •, which prevents the disagreeable flavour so often per- ceived in chickens. The cook must, in doing this, he careful not to crack the gall-bladder, for then no washing will remove the bitterness. Ignorant cooks sometimes draw fow'ls by cutting a hole in their side, but it should be done through the vent, and that being cut off, a string should fasten the rump close to the front part. Fowls for boiling should soak an hour or two in skim- milk. When trussed and singed, flour them well, tie them in a cloth ; put them in cold water, and set them over a slow fire; cover the saucepan close, and let them simmer; as soon as the scum rises, remove it carefully, cover them close up again, and boil them gently twenty minutes; take them off the fire, and the steam will suffi- ciently finish them, if kept in. All poultry requires thorough washing, but above all pigeons, lest the corn on which they feed should remain in the crop: they should not be picked till going to be dressed. Pigeons and ducks may be dressed as soon as killed. In dressing wild-fowl, be careful to keep a clear, brisk fire. Let them be done of a bright brown, but not much roasted, or the fine flavour will be destroyed. They, as well as tame birds, require to he continually basted, and to be sent up beautifully frothed. Tame fowls require more roasting, being longer in heating through. A large fowl will take three-quarters of an hour, a middling one half an hour; and a very small one, or a chicken, twenty minutes. The fire must be quick and clear before any fowls are put down. A capon will require from half an hour to thirty-five minutes; a goose an hour; wild ducks a quarter of anDOMESTIC COOKERY. 106 hour, widgeons the same; pheasants half an hour; a small turkey, stuffed, an hour and a quarter; a large one longer in proportion, observing that the stuffing keeps it back; turkey poults twenty minutes; grouse a quarter of an hour; quails ten minutes ; w'oodcocks twenty minutes; partridges from twenty to twenty-five minutes. A hare wdll take an hour; the hind part requires most heat, and that should be attended to, as it is common for the thick part of the thigh to be underdone, as well as the shoulders. The blood stagnated round the neck and shoulders is not easily removed : to do this, put those parts into a pan of lukewarm water; before dressing, rub and squeeze it out. Pigs and geese require a brisk fire and quick turning. The former will take from an hour to an hour and a half to roast, according to the size, and an iron pig-plate should be hung on the bar, to prevent the middle of the pig from being ready before the thicker parts. A strip of paper, tw'o inches wide, to cover the wdiole length of the breast of the goose, will prevent that being dried up before the more solid parts be ready. Directions hoxu to blanch, braise, glaze, force, and lard. To blanch. Put the artiele in. cold water over the fire, and when it boils up, take it out and plunge it into cold water, and let it remain until cold. This gives plumpness and whiteness. Tongues, palates, &c., are said to be blanched, when, after long boiling, the skin can be peeled ofi; and the latter will become thicker by being put into cold water as above. To braise. Put the meat you woidd braise into a new stewpan, and cover it with thick slices of fat bacon; then lay round it six or eight onions, a faggot of sweet herbs, some celery, and^if to be brown, some thick slices of101 POULTRY, GAME, &C. carrots, and trimmings, or fi'esh meat bones you have, and a pint and a half of water, or the same quantity of stock, which you will find directed under the head of Soups and Gravies. Over the meat lay a sheet of rvhite paper: according to what the meat is, add seasoning. Cover the pan close, and set it over a slow stove ; it will require two or three hours, as its size and quality may direct. Then put the meat and gravy into a colander to drain, and keep it quite hot; skim the gravy carefully, and boil it as quick as you can, till it thickens; then, M'ith a brush kept for the purpose, do over the meat, and if that has been lardered, put it into the oven for a few minuteSi This is called glazing, and is much in use for made-dishes. The glaze should be a clear yellow broMm; a glass of sherry may be put to it before it is set to thicken over the fire. (See To braise Chickens, p. 113.) To glaze, icithout braising. Fowls or meat may be dressed in any way chosen, without bacon, and a gravy, boiled to a glaze, brushed over, as above. Hams, tongues, and stewed beef, to eat cold, are thus done. Whether by giving the appearance of French cookery to our good old English dishes any advantage be gained in look or flavour, every one must judge for himself; but ham and tongue, in the opinion of many, are best when served as formerly. To force Fowls, ^c.. Is to stuff any part with forcemeat, and is usually put between the skin and the flesh. To lard Meat, Fowls, Sweetbreads, §»c. Have ready larding pins of different sizes, and accord- ing to the article to be done, cut slices of bacon into bits of a proper length, quite smooth, and put into a larding pin to suit it, with which pierce the skin and a very little of the meat, leaving the bacon in, and the two ends of equal length outwards. Lard in rows, the size vou think fit.DOMESTIC COOKERY. 108 POULTRY. To boil Turkey. Hen birds are the best for boiling. Make a stuffing of bread, herbs, some beef-suet, a little shred ham, a little shred lemon-peel, an anchovy, a hit of butter, salt, pep- per, and nutmeg, mixed with an egg; put this into the crop, and tie it close. Boil the turkey in a floured cloth. Against the time when it shall be ready, prepare a fine oyster-sauce, very thick of the butter, and pour over it. (See that article, and another kind of sauce for boiled turkey, among the Sauces.) Put the turkey in cold water ; skim often; cover close: if a young one of moderate size, boil half an hour, take it off, and the steam will finish it to greater perfection in a few minutes than longer boiling. To roast Turkey. The head should he cut oft’, except in turkey poults; and in drawing take care not to tear the fiver, nor let the gall touch it. Put a stuffing of sausage-meat; or if sausages are to be served in the dish, a bread stuffing: in either a very little shred shalot is an improvement. As this makes a large addition to the size of the bird, observe that the heat of the fire is constantly to that part, for the breast is often not done enough. A little strip of .paper should be put on the bone, to hinder it from scorching while the other parts roast. Baste well, and froth it up. Serve with gravy in the dish, and plenty of bread-sauce in a sauce-tureen. Add a few crumbs and a beaten egg to the stuffing of sausage-meat. The sinews of the legs should be drawn, whichever way it is dressed ; this is done by first breaking them between a door and a door-case just above the joint that unites the thigh and leg. Pulled Turkey. Divide the meat of the breast by pulling instead of cutting; then warm it in a spoonful or two of white gravy, and a little cream, grated nutmeg, salt, and a little flour and butter; do not boil it. The leg should be sea-109 POULTRY. soned, scored and broiled, and put into the dish with the above round it. Cold chicken does as well. An mcomparable Relish, or Devil, of Turkey. On the rump, gizzard, and a drum-stick, put salt, pepper, and cayenne. Let them be broiled, and brought back as hot as possible; cut them in small pieces, pour over a ladle of mustard, ditto of melted butter, a spoon- ful of soy, ditto of lemon-juice, and some of the gravy out of the dish ; mix quickly, and hand round. To boil Fowls. Flour them, and put them into boiling water. For • time, and other particulars, see general directions for dressing poultry. Choose those that are not black-legged for boiling. Serve with parsley and butter; oyster, lemon, liver, or celery sauce. If for dinner, ham, tongue, or bacon, is usually served to eat with them ; as likewise greens, or young cabbages. To steio a Foiol with Rice. Stew the fowl very slowly in some clear mutton-broth well-skimmed, and seasoned with onion, mace, pepper, and salt. About half an hour before it is ready, put in a quarter of a pint of rice well washed and soaked. Sim- mer till tender; then strain it from the broth, and put tlie rice on a sieve before the fire. Keep the fowl hot, •lay it in the middle of the dish, and the rice round it without the broth. The broth will be very nice to eat as such; but the less liquor the fowl is done with the better. Gravy, or parsley and butter for sauce. Pilaw. Boil rice as for currie. Line a pie-dish with ham or lean bacon, sliced very thin. Cut up a fowl in joints, or part of a breast of veal in pieces, season with pepper and salt, and put to the ham with two large onions stuck with cloves; then fill up the dish with the rice. Lay a common paste over, and bake one hour in a quick oven, having first put a quarter of a pint of gravy in. Take offDOMESTIC COOKERY. 110 the crust before serving, and garnish with hard egg«, boiled onions, and Indian pickle. Fowls roasted. Serve with egg-sauce, bread-sauce, or parsley and butter in tureens; or garnished with sausages, or scalded parsley. A large barn-door fowl, well hung, should be stuffed in the crop with sausage-meat; and served with gravy in the dish, and with bread-sauce. The head should be turned under the wing, as a turkey. Foivls broiled. Split them down the back; pepper, salt, and broil. Serve with mushroom-sauce. Another way. Cut a large fowl into four quarters, put them on a bird-spit, and tie that on another spit, and half roast; or half roast the whole fowl, and finish on the gridiron, which will make it less dry than if wholly broiled. The fowl that is not cut before roasted must be split down the back after. Davenport Fowls. Hang young fowls a night.; take the livers, hearts, and tenderest parts of the gizzards, the last being previously boiled, shred .very small, with half a handful of young clary, an anchovy to each fowl, an onion, and the yolks of four eggs boiled hard, with pepper, salt and mace, to your taste. Stuff the fowls with this, and sew up the vents and necks quite close, that the w'ater may not get in. Boil them in salt and water till almost done; then drain them, and put them into a stewpan with butter enough to brown them. Serve with a good deal of melted butter, with either soy or ketchup in it. A nice way to dress a Fowl for a small dish. Bone, singe, and wash a young fowl; make a force- meat of four ounces of veal, two ounces of scraped lean of ham, two ounces of fat bacon, two hard yolks of eggs,Ill POULTRY. a few sweet herbs chopped, two ounces of heef-suet, a tea-spoonful of lemon-peel minced quite fine, an anchovy, salt, pepper, and a very little cayenne. Beat all in a mortar, with a tea-cupful of crumbs, and the yolks and whites of three eggs. Stuflf the inside of the fowl, and draw the legs and wings inward; tie the neck and rump close. Stew the fowl in a white gravy; when it is done through, and tender, add a large cupful of cream, and a hit of butter and flour; give it one boil, and serve ; the last thing, add the squeeze of a lemon. Rather more than half boil, in a small quantity of water : let them cool; then cut up; and put to simmer in a little gravy made of the liquor they are boiled in, and a hit of veal or mutton, onion, mace, and lemon- peel, some w'hite pepper, and a hunch of sweet herbs. When quite tender, keep them hot while you thicken the sauce in the following manner; strain it off, and put it back into the saucepan with a little salt, a scrape of nutmeg, and a bit of flour and butter; give it one boil; and when you are going to serve, heat up the yolk of an egg, add half a pint of cream, and stir them over the fire, but do not let it boil. It will be quite as good with- out the egg. The gravy may be made (without any other meat) of the necks, feet, small wing-bones, gizzards, and livers; which are called the trimmings of the fowds. A beautiful and excellent way of dressing Fowls. Wlien nicely clean, and free from every feather and plug, singe them. Bone, and draw inwards the leg and pinion of the wing. Stuff Avith sausage-meat, and tie the neck and vent. Roast, and serve with gravy in the dish, and bread-sauce in a tureen. If the fowls are young, and properly kept, they are equal to turkey. If the quantity of forcemeat he thought too much, one fowl may he put within the other. Fricassee of Chickens.DOMESTIC COOKERY. 112 To pull Chickens. Take of the skin, and pull the flesh off the bone of a cold fowl, in as large pieces as you can : dredge it with flour, and fry it of a nice brown in butter. Drain the butter from it; and then simmer the flesh in a good gravy, well seasoned, and thickened with a little flour and butter. Add the juice of half a lemon. Another way. Cut off the legs, and the whole back of a dressed chicken ; if under-done the better. Pull all the white part into little flakes free from skin; toss it up with a little cream thickened with a piece of butter mixed with flour, half a blade of mace in powder, white pepper, salt, and a squeeze of lemon. Cut off the neck end of the chicken; and broil the back and sidesmen in one piece, and the two legs seasoned. Put the hash in the middle, with the back on it; and the two legs at the end. Chicken Currie. Cut up the chickens raw, slice onions, and fry both in butter with great care, of a fine light brown ; or if you use chickens that have been dressed, fry only the onions. Lay the joints, cut into two or three pieces each, into a stewpan, with a veal or mutton gravy, and a clove or two of garlic. Simmer till the chicken is quite tender. Half an hour before you serve it, rub smooth a spoonful or two of currie-powder, a spoonful of flour, and an ounce of butter; and add this, with four large spoonsful of cream to the stew. Salt to your taste. When serv- mg, squeeze in a little lemon. Slices of under-done veal or rabbit, turkey, &c., make excellent currie. A dish of rice, boiled dry, must be served. For direc- tions to do this, see the article Rice. Another, more easily made. Cut up a chicken or young rabbit; if chicken, take oft the skin. Roll each piece in a mixture of a large spoonful of flour, and half an ounce of currie-powder.113 POULTRY. Slice two or three onions, and fry them in butter, of a light brown; then add the meat, and fry altogether till the meat begins to brown. Put it all into a stewpan, and pour boiling water enough just to cover it. Simmer very gently two or three hours. If too thick, put more w'ater half an hour before serving. If the meat has been dressed before, a little broth will be better than water; but the currie is richer when made of fresh meat. To braise Chickens. Bone, and fill them with forcemeat. Lay the bones, and any other poultry trimmings, into a stewpan, and the chickens on them. Put to them a few onions, a faggot of herbs, three blades of mace, a pint of stock, and a glass or two of sherry. Cover the chickens with slices of bacon, and then white paper; cover the whole close, and put them on a slow stove for two hours. Then take them up, strain the braise, and skim off the fat carefully; set it on to boil very quick to a glaze, and do the chickens over it with a brush. Serve with a brown fricassee of mushrooms. Before glazing, put the chicken into an oven for a few minutes, to give a little colour. Ducks roasted. Stuff one with sage and onion, a dessert-spoonful of crumbs, a bit of butter, and pepper and salt; let the other be unseasoned. They should be done to a turn, and go up finely frothed, with a rich gravy in the dish. To boil Ducks. Choose a fine fat duck ; salt it two days, then boil it slowly in a cloth. Serve it with onion sauce, but melt the butter with milk instead of water. To stew Ducks. Half roast a duck ; put it into a stewpan with a pint of beef-gravy, a few leaves of sage and mint cut small, pepper and salt, and a small bit of onion shred as fine 1114 DOMESTIC COOKERY. as possible. Simmer a quarter of an hour, and skim clean; then add near a quart of green peas. Cover close, and simmer near half an hour longer. Put in a piece of butter and a little flour, and give it one boil ; then serve in one dish. To hash Ducks. Cut a cold duck into joints; and warm it, without boiling, in gravy, a glass of port wine, a tea-spoonful of made mustard, and a little butter and flour. To roast Goose. After it is prepared (see Directions for Poultry'), let it be well washed and dried, and a seasoning put in of onion, sage, and pepper and salt. Fasten it tight at the neck and rump, and then roast. Put it first at a dis- tance from the fire, and by degrees draw it nearer.. A slip of paper should be skewered on the breast-bone. Baste it very well. When the breast is rising, take ofi" the paper; and be careful to serve it before the breast falls, or it will be spoiled by coming flatted to table. Let a good gravy be sent in the dish. Apple sauce for a stubble goose, gooseberry sauce for a green one. A glass of port, a ladle of mustard, and some salt, put into the goose when the apron is cut ofiF, give an additional flavour to the old goose. To steiv Giblets. Do them as will be directed for giblet pie, until the gizzards are perfectly tender: season them with salt and pepper, and a very small piece of mace. Before serving, give them one boil and a cup of cream, and a piece of butter rubbed in a tea-spoonful of flour. Each gizzard and liver divided into four, the neck into three, and the wings into two. Pigeons May be dressed in such a variety of ways, that they are most usefid birds. See Directions for Poultry, for cleaning, &c.POULTRY. 115 Roast Pigeons Should be stuffed with parsley, either cut or whole, and seasoned within. Serve with parsley and buttei-. Peas or asparagus should be dressed to eat with them. Pigeons left from dinner may be either stewed ten minutes in a good gravy, with forcemeat balls ready fried; or made into a pie: if the latter, let a beef-steak be stewed tender in a little water, and put both at the bottom of the dish, the 2^igeons next, and cover them with a piece of fat bacon to keep them moist; season as usual, and add the yolks of eggs boiled hard. The crust in this case must be thin, tlvat it may not require long baking. To stexo Pigeons. Take care that they are quite fresh, and carefully cropped, drawn, and washed; then soak them half an hour. In the mean time, cut a hard white cabbage in slices (as if for pickling) into water: drain it, and then boil it in milk and water; drain it again, and lay some of it at the bottom of a stewpan. Put the pigeons upon it, but first season them well with pejiper and salt; and cover them with the remainder of the cabbage. y\^dd a little broth, and stew gently till the jiigeons are tender; then jiut among them two or three sfjoonsful of cream, and a jfiece of butter and flour, for thickening. After a boil or two, serve the birds in the middle, and the cab- bage jfiaced round them. Another loay. Stew the birds in a good brown gravy, either stuffed or not; and seasoned high with spice and mushrooms fresh, or a little ketchup. To hr oil Pigeons. After cleaning, split down the backs, pepper and salt them, and broil them very nicely ; pour over them either stewed or jfickled mushrooms in melted butter, and serve as hot as possible. I 2116 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Wood Pigeons. Let them hang to be tender; roast and serve with a rich gravy. They must not be roasted so much as the common pigeons. To pickle Pigeons. Bone and turn them inside out, lard the inside, and season with a little allspice and salt, in fine powder; then turn them again, and tie the neck and rump with thread. Put them into boiling water: let them boil a minute or two to plump: take them out and dry them ^ well; then put them boiling hot into the pickle, which i must be made of equal quantities of white wdne and I white w'ine vinegar, with white pepper and allspice, ! sliced ginger and nutmeg, and two or three bay-leaves. I When it boils up, put the pigeons in. If they are | small, a quarter of an hour will do them; but they will ; take twenty minutes if large. Then take them out, ‘ wipe them, and let them cool. When the pickle is cold, take the fat off from it, and put them in again. Keep them in a sto?ie jar, tied down with a bladder to keep out the air. Instead of larding, put into some a stuffing made of hard yolks of eggs and marrow' in equal quantities, with i sweet herbs, pepper, salt, and mace. Serve with some ! of the pickle. Pigeons in jelly: a beautiful dish. Save some of the liquor in wdiich a knuckle of veal has been boiled: or boil a calf’s or a neat’s foot: put the broth into a pan with a blade of mace, a bunch of sw'eet herbs, some white pepper, lemon-peel, a slice of lean bacon, and the pigeons. The heads and feet must be left on, but the nails must be clipped close. Bake them, and let them stand to be cold. Season them as you like, before baking. When done, take them out of the liquor, cover them close to preserve the colour, and clear the jelly by boiling with the wdiites of two eggs; then strain it through a thick cloth dipped in boilingm POULTRY. ■water, and put into a sieve. The fat must be perfectly removed before it be cleared. Put the jelly over and round them rough. They must be trussed, and the neck propped up with skewers, to appear in a natural state, before they are baked. Another ivaij. Pick two very nice pigeons; and make them look as well as possible by singeing, washing, and cleaning the heads well. Leave the heads and the feet on, but the nails must be clipped close to the claws. Roast them of a very nice brown; and when done, put a little sprig of myrtle into the bill of each. Have ready a savoury jelly, as before, and with it half fill a bowl of such a size as shall be proper to turn down on the dish you mean it to be served in. When the jelly and the birds are cold, see that no gravy hangs to the birds, and then lay them upside down in the jelly. Before the rest of it begins to set, pour it over the birds, so as to be three inches above the feet. This should be done full twenty-four hours before serving. This dish has a very handsome appearance in the middle range of a second course; or, when served with the jelly roughed large, it makes a side or corner thing, its size being then less. The head should be kept up as if alive, by tying the neck with some thread, and the legs bent as if the pigeon sat upon them. To pot Pigeons. Let them be quite fresh, clean them carefully, and season them with salt and pepper; lay them close in a small deep pan; for the smaller the surface, and the closer they are ]>acked, the less butter will be wanted. Cover them with butter, then with very thick paper tied down, and bake them. When cold, put them dry into pots that will hold two or three in each; and pour butter over them, using that which was baked as part. Observe that the butter should be pretty thick over them, if they are to be kept. If pigeons were boned,DOMESTIC COOKERY. 118 and then put in an oval form into the pot, they would lie closer, and require less butter. They may he stuffed ■with a fine forcemeat made with veal, bacon, &c., and then they will eat e.Ycellently. If a high flavour is ap- proved of, add mace, allspice, and a little cayenne, before baking. Larks and other small Birds. Draw and spit them on a bird-spit; tie this on another spit, and roast them. Baste gently with butter, and strew bread-crumbs upon them till half done; brown and serve with fried crumbs round. GAME, &c. To keep Game, ^-c. Game ought not to be thrown away even when it has been kept a very long time; for when it seems to be spoiled, it may often be made fit for eating, by nicely cleaning it, and washing with vinegar and water. If there is danger of birds not keeping, draw, crop, and pick them; then wash in two or three waters, and rub them w'ith salt. Have ready a large saucepan of boiling water, and plunge them into it one by one; drawing them up and down by the legs, that the water may pass through them. Let them stay five or six minutes in; then hang them up in a cold place. When drained, pepper and salt the inside well. Before roasting, wash them w'ell. The most delicate birds, even grouse, may be pre- served thus. Those that live by suction cannot be done this w'ay, as they are never drawn; and perhaps the heat might make them worse, as the water eould not pass through them; but they bear being high. Lumps of charcoal put about birds and meat wull pre- serve them from taint, and restore what is spoiling. To clariftj Butler for potted Things. Put it into a sauce-boat, and set that over the fire in a stewpan that has a little water in it. When melted,GAME. 119 take care not to pour the milky parts over the potted things : they will sink to the bottom. Pheasants and Partridges. Roast them as a turkey; and serve with a fine gravy (into which put a very small bit of garlic) and bread- sauce. When cold, they may be made into excellent patties, but tbeir flavour should not be overpowered by lemon. For the manner of trussing a pheasant or par- tridge, see Plate IX. To pot Partridge. Clean them nicely; and season with mace, allspice, white pepper, and salt, in fine powder. Rub every part well; then lay the breast downwards in a pan, and pack the birds as close as you possibly can. Put a good deal of butter on them; then cover the pan with a coarse flour paste and a paper over, tie it close, and bake. When cold, put the birds into pots, and cover them with butter. A verij cheap wag of potting Birds. Prepare them as directed in the last receipt; and when baked and grown cold, cut them into proper pieces for helping; pack them close into a large pot- ting-pan, and (if possible) leave no spaces to receive the butter. Cover them with butter, and one-third part less will be wanted than when the birds are done whole. The butter that has covered potted things will serve for basting, or for paste for meat pies. To pot Moor Game. Pick, singe, and wash the birds nicely ; then dry them; and season, inside and out, pretty high, with pepper, mace, nutmeg, allspice, and salt. Pack them in as small a pot as will hold them, cover them witli l)utter, and bake in a very slow oven. When cold, take oft' the butter, dry them from the gravy, and put one bird into each pot, which should just fit. Add as much moreDOMESTIC COOKERY. 120 butter as will cover them, but take care that it does not oil. The best way to melt it is by warming it in a basin set in a bowl of hot water. . Grouse. Roast them like fowls, but the head is to be twisted under the wing. They must not be over-done. Serve with a rich gravy in the dish, and bread-sauce. The sauce for wild fowl, as will be described hereafter under the head of Sauces, may be used instead of common gi-avy. To roast Wild Fowl. The flavour is best preserved without stuffing. Put pepper, salt, and a piece of butter into each. Wild fowl require much less dressing than tame; they should be served of a fine colour, and well frothed up. A rich brown gravy should be sent in the dish; and when the breast is cut into slices, before taking off the bone, a squeeze of lemon, with pepper and salt, is a great improvement to the flavour. To take off the fishy taste which wild fowl sometimes have, put an onion, salt, and hot water into the drip- ping-pan, and baste them for the first ten minutes with this; then take away the pan, and baste constantly with butter. Wild Ducks, Teal, Widgeons, Dun-Birds, 8^'C., Should be taken up with the gravy in. Baste them with hutter; and sprinkle a little salt before they are taken up, put a good gravy upon them, and serve with shalot- sauce in a boat. Woodcocks, Snipes, and Quails, Keep good several days. Roast them without drawing, and serve on toast. Butter only should be eaten with them, as gravy takes off from the fine flavour. The thigh and back .are esteemed the most. In helping, the lady must be careful to remove first a small bitter bag from the trail. For the manner of trussing a woodcock or snipe, see Plate IX.GAME. 121 To-pot Woodcocks. Pluck and draw six woodcocks, skew'cr their bills through their thighs, put their legs through each other, and their feet on their breasts. Season with pepper, salt, and mace. Put them into a deep pot, with a pound of butter on them. Bake them in a moderate oven, and I not too much. Draw the gravy from them, then put t them into potting-pots. Take all the clear butter from ! the gravy, and put it upon them. Fill up the pots with I clarified butter. Keep them in a dry place. Snipes I may be done in the same manner. 1 Ruffs and Rees Are skewered as quails; put bars of bacon over them, and roast them about ten minutes. Serve with a good gravy in the dish. To dress Plovers. Roast the green ones in the same way as woodcocks and quails (see above), without drawing; and serve on a toast. Gray plovers may be either roasted or stewed with gravy, herbs, and spice. Plovers^ Eggs Are a nice and fashionable dish. Boil them ten minutes, and serve either hot or cold : the former on a napkin j the latter on moss. To roast Ortolans. Pick and singe, but do not draw them. Tie on a bird- spit and roast them. Some persons like bacon in slices tied between them, but the taste of it spoils the flavour of the ortolan. Cover them with crumbs of bread. Melted butter, with a little grated nutmeg, for sauce. Guinea and Pea Fowl Taste much like pheasant, if jjroperly hung; dress and serve the same way. Their eggs are delicate, and must boil one minute and a half.122 DOMESTIC COOKEIiy. Hares, If properly taken care of, will keep a considerable time, and even v^hen the cook fancies them past eating maybe in the highest perfection; which they cannot lie if eaten when fresh killed. As they are usually paunched in the field, the cook cannot prevent this; but the hare keeps longer, and eats much better, if not opened for four or five days, or according to the weather. If paunched, as soon as a hare comes in it should be wiped cphte dry, the heart and liver taken out, and the liver scalded to keep for the stuffing. Repeat this wiping every day; mix pepper and ginger, and rub on the in- side ; and put a large piece of charcoal into it. If the spice is applied early, it will prevent that musty taste which long keeping in the damp occasions, and which also affects the stuffing. An old hare should be kept as long as possible, if to be roasted. It must also be well soaked. To roast Hare. After it is skinned let it be extremely w'ell washed, and then soaked an hour or two in water; and if old. lard it, which will make it tender, as also will letting it lie in vinegar. If, however, it is put into vinegar, it should be exceedingly well washed in water afterwards. Put a large relishing stuffing into the belly, and then sew it up. Baste it well with milk till half done, and after- wards with butter. If the blood has settled in the neck, soaking the part in warm water, and putting it to the fire warm, will remove it; especially if you also nick the skin here and there ■with a small loiife to let it out. The hare should be kept at a distance from the fire at first. Serve with a fine froth, rich gravy, melted butter, and currant-jelly sauce; the gravy in the dish. For stuffing use the liver, an anchovy, some fat bacon, a little suet, herbs, pepper, salt, nutmeg, a little onion, crumbs of bread, and an egg to bind it all. The ears must be nicelyGAME. 123 cleaned and singed, and made crisp. They are reckoned a dainty. For the manner of trussing a hare, see Plate IX. The proper stuffing is directed under the article Force- meat. To jug an old Hare. i After cleaning and skinning, cut it up; and season it i with pepper, salt, allspice, pounded mace, and a little I nutmeg. Put it into a jar Avith an onion, a clove or two, 1 a bunch of sweet herbs, a piece of coarse beef, and the I carcass-bones over all. Tie the jar down with a bladder, \ and leather or strong paper; and put it into a saucepan I of water up to the neck, but no higher. Keep the water j boiling five hours. When it is to be served, boil the j gravy up with a piece of butter and flour; and if the i meat gets cold, warm it in this, but not to boil. Force- i meat balls may be served, but are not necessary. Broiled and hashed Hare. The flavour of broiled hare is particularly fine; the legs or wings must be seasoned first; rub with cold butter, and serve very hot. The other parts, warmed with gravy and a little stuff- ing, may be served separately. To pot Hare, For which an old one does well, as likewise for soup and pie. After seasoning it, bake it with butter. When cold, take the meat from the bones, and beat it in a mortar. If not high enough, add salt, mace, pepper, and a piece of the finest fresh butter melted in a spoonful or two of the gravy that came from the hare. When well mixed, put it into small pots, and cover Avith butter. The legs and back should be baked at the bottom of the jar, to keep them moist, and the bones Im put over them. Rabbits May be dressed various ways, as follows :— Roasted with stuffing and gravy, like hare,[or without124 DOMESTIC COOKERY. stuffing; with sauce of the liver and parsley chopped in melted butter, pepper, and salt; or larded. For the manner of trussing a rabbit for either roasting or boiling, see Plate IX. Boiled and smothered with onion-sauce : the butter to be melted with milk instead of water. Fried in joints, with dried or fried parsley. The same liver-sauce, this way also. Fricasseed, as before directed for chickens. In a pie, as chicken, with forcemeat, &c. In this way they are excellent when young. Potted. \To make a Rabbit taste much like Hare. Choose one that is young, but full-grown ; hang it in the skin three or four days; then skin it; and lay it, without washing, in a seasoning of black pepper and all- spice in a very fine powder, a glass of port wine, and the same quantity of vinegar. Baste it occasionally for forty hours; then stuff it, and roast it as a hare, and with the same sauce. Do not wash off the liquor that it was soaked in. To pot Rabbits. Cut up two or three young but full-grown ones, and take the leg-bones off at the thigh ; pack them as closely as possible in a small pan, after seasoning them with pep- per, mace, ca)^enne, salt, allspice, all in verj' fine powder. Make the top as smooth as you can. Keep out the heads and the carcasses, but take off the meat about the neck. Put a good deal of butter, and bake the whole gently. Keep it two days in the pan; then shift it into small pots, adding butter. The livers also should be added, as they eat well.125 SOUPS AND GRAVIES. PART IV. SOUPS AND GRAVIES. General directions respecting Soups and Gravies. When there is any fear of gravy meat being spoiled before it be wanted, season well, and fry it lightly, which will preserve it two days longer; but the gravy is best when the juices are fresh. When soups or gravies are to be put by, let them be changed every day into fresh scalded pans. Whatever has vegetables boiled in it is apt to turn sour sooner than the juices of meat. Never keep any gravy, &c., in metal. When fat remains on any soup, a tea-cupful of flour and water mixed quite smooth, and boiled in, will take it ofl‘. If richness or greater consistency be wanted, a good lump of butter mixed with flour, and boiled in the soup, will give either of these qualities. Long boiling is necessary to give the full flavour of the ingredients, therefore time should be allow'ed for soups and gravies; and they are best if made the day before they are wanted. Soups and gravies are far better when the meat is put at the bottom of the pan, and stewed, and the herbs, roots, &c., with butter, than when water is put to the meat at first; and the gravy that is drawn from the meat should be almost dried up before the water is put to it. Do not use the sediments of gravies, &c., that have stood to be cold. When onions are strong, hoil a turnip with them, if for sauce; this will make them mild. If soups or gravies are too weak, do not cover them in boiling, that the watery particles may evaporate. If colour be wanting, fry some onions, with flour, of126 DOMESTIC COOKERY. a good brown (but do not burn), and add to the soup; or put a piece of bread, toasted as hard and brown as possible, but not blackened. Or melt some fine white sugar in an iron ladle till it becomes brown, pour upon it boiling water, and stir it; give it a boil, and keep it for use in a bottle. The shank bones of mutton should be saved; and after soaking and brushing may be added to give rich- ness to gravies or soups. They are also particularly nourishing for sick persons. A clear jelly of Cow-heels is very useful to keep in the house, being a great improvement to soups and gravies. Trudies and morels thicken soups and sauces, and give them a fine flavour. Wash half an ounce of each carefully, then simmer them a few minutes in water, and add them with the liquor, to boil in the sauce, &c., till tender. Marrow-bones, after the marrow has been taken out for puddings, or roast beef-bones, make fine pea-soup. The water in which meat has been boiled makes ex- cellent, soups for the poor by the addition of vegetables. SOUPS, &c. Colouring of Soups or Gravies. Put four ounces of lump sugar, a gill of water, and half an ounce of the finest butter into a small tosser, and set it over a gentle fire. Stir it with a wooden spoon, till of a bright brown. Then add half a pint of water; boil, skim, and when cold bottle and cork it close. Add to soup or gravy as much of this as will give a proper colour. A clear brown Stock for Gravy-Soup or Gravy. Put a knuckle of veal, a pound of lean beef, and a pound of the lean of a gammon of bacon, all sliced, into a stewpan,wdth two or three scraped carrots, two onions, two turnips, two heads of celery sliced, and two quarts of water. Stew the meat quite tender, but do not let it brown. When thus prepared, it will serve either tor127 SOUPS-. soup, or brown or white gravy; if for brown gravy, put some of the above colouring, and boil a few minutes. Mock Turtle. Bespeak a calf’s head with the skin on, cut it in half, and clean it well; then half boil it, take all the meat off in square bits, break the bones of the head, and boil them in some veal and beef broth to add to the ricluiess. Fry some shalot in butter, and dredge in flour enough to thicken the gravy; stir this into the browning, and give it one or tw^o boils; skim it carefully, and then put in the head ■, put in also a pint of Madeira wine, and sim- mer till the meat is quite tender. About ten minutes before you serve, put in some basil, tarragon, chives, pai'sley, Cayenne pepper, and salt to your taste; also two spoonsful fof mushroom ketchup, and one of soy. Squeeze the juice of a lemon into the tureen, and pour the soup upon it. Forcemeat balls and small eggs. A cheaper ivaij to prepare Mock Turtle. Prepare half a calf’s head, without the skin as above: when the meat is cut off, break the bones and put them into a saucepan with some gravy made of beef and veal bones, and seasoned with fried onions, herbs, mace, and pepper. Have ready two or three ox-palates boiled so tender as to blanch, and cut into small pieces; to w hich a cow-heel, likewise cut into pieces, is a great improve- ment. Brown some butter, flour, and onion, and pour the gravy to it; then add the meats as above, and stew. Half a pint of sherry, an anchovy, two spoonsful of walnut-ketchup, the same of mushroom-ketchup, and some chopped herbs as before. Balls, &c. Another waij. Put into a pan a knuckle of veal, two fine cow'-heels, two onions, a few cloves, peppers, berries of allspice, mace, and sweet herbs; cover them with water, then tie a thick paper over the pan, and set it in an oven for three hours. When cold, take off the fat very nicely; cut the meat and feet into bits an inch and a half square;128 DOMESTIC COOKERY. remove the bones and coarse parts; and then put the rest on to warm, with a large spoonful of w^alnut and one of mushroom-ketchup, half a pint of sherrj' or Madeira wine, a little mushroom-powder, and the jelly of the meat. When hot, if it wants any more seasoning, add some; and serve with hard eggs, forcemeat balls, a squeeze of lemon, and a spoonful of soy. This is a very easy way, and the dish is excellent. Another ivay. Stew a pound and a half of scrag of mutton, with from three pints of water to a quart; then set the broth on, with a calf's-foot and a cow-heel, cover the stew- pan tight, and simmer till you can get otf the meat from the bones in proper bits. Set it on again with the broth, a quarter of a pint of Madeira wine or sherry, a large onion, half a tea-spoonful of Cayenne pepper, a bit of lemon-peel, two anchovies, some sweet herbs, eighteen oysters cut into pieces and then chopped fine, a tea- spoonful of salt, a little nutmeg, and the liquor of the oysters; cover it tight, and simmer three-quarters of an hour. Serve with forcemeat-balls, and hard eggs in the tureen. An excellent and very cheap mock-turtle may be made of two or three cow-heels baked with two pounds and a half of gravy-beef, herbs, &c., as above, with cow-heels and veal. An excellent Soup. Take a scrag of knuckle of veal, slices of undressed gammon of bacon, onions, mace, and a small quantity of water; simmer till very strong; and lower it with a good beef-broth made the day before, and stewed till the meat is done to rags. Add cream, vermicelli, and almonds, as will be directed in the next receipt, and a roll. An excellent white Soup. Take a scrag of mutton, a knuckle of veal, after cut- ting olf as much meat as will make collops, two or three shank-bones of mutton nicely cleaned, and a quarter of129 SOUPS. a pound of very fine undressed lean gammon of bacon ; with a bunch of sweet herbs, a piece of fresh lemon- peel, two or three onions, three blades of mace, and a dessert-spoonful of white pepper; boil all in three quarts of water, till the meat falls quite to pieces. Next day take off the fat, clear the jelly from the sediment, and put it into a saucepan of the nicest tin. If macaroni is nsed, it should be added soon enough to get perfectly tender, after soaking in cold water. Vermicelli may be added after the thickening, as it requires less time to do. Have ready the thickening, which is to be made as follows:— Blanch a quarter of a ponnd of sweet almonds, and beat them to a paste in a marble mortar, with a spoonfnl of water to prevent their oiling; mince a large slice of dressed veal or chicken, and beat it with a piece of stale white bread : add all this to a pint of thick cream, a bit of fresh lemon-peel, and a blade of mace, in the finest powder. Boil it a few rainntes; add to it a pint of soup, and strain and pulp it through a coarse sieve: this thickening is then fit for putting to the rest, which should boil for half an hour afterwards. A 'plainer white Soup. Two or three pints of sonp may be made of a small knuckle of veal, with seasoning, as directed in the last article; and both served together, with the addition of a quarter of a pint of good milk. Two spoonsful of cream, and a little ground rice, will give it a proper thickness. Giblet Soup. Scald and clean three or four sets of goose or duck giblets; set them to stew, with a pound or two of gravy- beef, scrag of mutton, or the bone of a knuckle of veal, an ox-tail, or some shanks of mutton, with three onions, a large bunch of sweet herbs, a tea-spoonful of white pepper, and a large spoonful of salt. Put five pints of water, and simmer till the gizzards (which must be each m four pieces) are quite tender; skim nicely, and add K130 DOMESTIC COOKERY, quarter of a pint of cream, two tea-spoonsful of mush- room powder, and an ounce of butter mixed with a dessert-spoonful of flour. Let it boil a few minutes, and serve with the giblets. It may be seasoned, instead of cream, with two glasses of sherry or madeira, a large spoonful of ketchup, and some cayenne. When in the tureen, add salt. Partridge Soup. Skin two old birds, and cut them into pieces, with three or four slices of ham, a stick of celery, and three large onions cut into slices. Fry them all in butter till brown, but take care not to burn them. Then put them into a stewpan, wdth five pints of boiling water, a few peppercorns, a shank or two of mutton, and a little salt. Stew it gently two hours; then strain it through a sieve, and put it again into a stewpan, with some stewed celery and fried bread; when it is near boiling, skim it, pour it into a tureen, and serve it uji hot. Grouse Soup Is made in the same way, only using one onion; adding Jamaica pepper, and half a dozen of cloves, but no celery. Macaroni Soup. Boil a pound of the best macaroni in a quart of eood stock till quite tender; then take out half, and put it into another stewpot. To the remainder add some more stock, and boil it till you can pulp all the maca- roni through a fine sieve. Then add together that, the two liquors, a pint or more of cream boiling hot, the macaroni that was first taken out, and half a pound of grated Parmesan cheese; make it hot, but do not let it boil. Serve it with the crust of a French roll cut into pieces the size of a shilling. A Pepper-pot to be served in a Tureen. To three quarts of water put vegetables according to the season; in summer, peas, lettuce, and spinach; in131 SOUPS. winter, carrots, turnips, celery, and onions in both. Cut small, and stew with two pounds of neck of mutton, or a fowl, and a pound of pickled pork, in three quarts of water, till quite tender. On first boiling, skim. Half an hour before serving, add a lobster or crab, cleared from the bones. Season with salt and cayenne. A small quantity of rice should be put in with the meat. Some people choose very small suet dumplings boiled with it. Should any fat rise, skim nicely, and put half a cup of water with a little flour. Pepper-pot may be made of various things, and is understood to be a due proportion of fish, flesh, fowl, vegetables, and pulse. Gravy Soup. Wash and soak a leg of beef; break the bone, and set it on the fire with a gallon of water, a large bunch of sweet herbs, two large onions, sliced, and fried a fine brown, (but not burnt,) two blades of mace, three cloves, twenty berries of allspice, and forty black peppers. Stew till the soup is as rich as you choose; then take out the meat, which will be fit for the servants’ table, with a little of the gravy. Next day take off the cake of fat; which will serve for basting, or for common pie- crust. Have ready such vegetables as you choose to serve. Cut carrots, turnips, and celery small, and sim- mer till tender; some people do not like them to be sent to table, only the flavour of them. Boil vermicelli a quarter of an hour, and add to it a large spoonful of soy, and one of mushroom-ketchup. A French roll should be made hot, put into the soup till moist through, and served in the tureen. The soup must be strained after the meat is removed. Vegetable Soup. Pare and slice five or six cucumbers; and add to these the inside of as many cos-lettuces, a sprig or two of mint, two or three onions, some pepper and salt, aDOMESTIC COOKERY. 132 pint and a half of young peas, and a little parsley. Put these, with half a pound of fresh butter, into a saucepan, to stew in their own liquor, near a gentle fire, half an hour; then pour two quarts of boiling water to the vege- tables, and stew them two hours; rub down a little flour into a tea-cupful of water, boil it with the rest fifteen or twenty minutes, and serve it. Very small suet dumplings, boiled in water, and added to this and the following soups, in the tureen, are an improvement. Another umy. Peel and slice six large onions, six potatoes, six car- rots, and four turnips; fry them in half a pound of butter, and pour on them four quarts of boiling water. Toast a crust of bread as brown and hard as possible, but do not burn it; put that, some celer}', sweet herbs, white pepper, and salt, to the above; stew it all gently four hours, then strain it through a coarse cloth: have ready sliced carrot, celery, and a little turnip, and add to your liking; and stew them tender in the soup. If approved, you may add an anchov}', and a spoonful of ketchup. Herb Soup. Clean and cut small six Silesia or cabbage lettuces, a large handful of spinach, purslain, white beet-leaves, a few young onions, and a little parsley. Take the seeds out of three large cucumbers, cut the cucumbers in slices, and, with half a pint of spinach-juice, add to the above. Put the vegetables into a stewpan, witli half a pound of butter; stir round till the latter melts ; cover close, and set the ])an over a very gentle fire for two hours. Then pour in boiling water, until of a proper thickness ; season with pepper and salt. Let the soup simmer an hour: put in some asparagus tops, boiled and cut in bits; and if it be not of a prOi{)er consistence, or there appear any fat on the top, mix a tea-spoonful of flour with half a cup of cold water, and add it half an hour before serving.133 SOUPS. A French roll quartered, fried bread, or suet dumplings, may be put into the soup. Tur?iip Soup. Take off a knuckle of veal all the meat that can be made into cutlets, &c., and set the remainder on to stew, with an onion, a bunch of herbs, a blade of mace, some whole pepper, and five pints of water: cover it close; and let it do on a slow fire, four or five, hours at least. Strain it, and set it by till next day; then take the fat and sediment from the jelly, and simmer it with turnips cut into small dice till tender, seasoning it with salt and pepper. Before serving, rub down half a spoonful of flour with half a pint of good cream, and the size of a walnut of butter, and boil a few minutes. Let a small roll simmer in the soup till Avet through, and serve this with it. It should be as thick as middling cream. Old Peas Soup. Save the water in Avhich beef or pork has been boiled; and, if too salt, put as much fresh water to it; or use fresh w'ater entirely, Avith roast-beef bones, a ham or gammon bone, or an anchovy or two. Simmer these with some good Avhole or split peas; the smaller the quantity of Avater, at first, the better. Simmer till the peas Avill pulp through a colander; then set the pulp, and some of the liquor that boiled the peas, Avith two carrots, a turnip, a leek, and a stick of celery cut into bits, to stCAV till all is quite tender. When ready, put fried bread cut into dice, dried mint rubbed fine, pepper, and (if Avanted) salt, into the tureen ; and pour the soup in. If for maigre days, instead of bones, &c., four ounces of butter Avill make it equally rich. Green Peas Soup. In shelling the peas, divide the old from the young; put the old ones, Avith an ounce of butter, a pint of water, the outside leaves of a lettuce or two, tAvo onions, pepper, and salt, to steAV till you can pulp the peas; and Avhen134 DOMESTIC COOKERY. you have done so, put to the liquor that stewed them some more water, the hearts and tender stalks of the lettuces, the young peas, a handful of spinach cut small, and salt and pepper to relish properly, and stew till quite soft. If the soup is too thin, or not rich enough, either of these faults may be removed by adding an ounce or two of , butter, mixed with a spoonful of rice or wheat flour, and boiled with it half an hour. Before serving, boil some green mint, shred fine, in the soup. i When there is plenty of vegetables, no meat is neces- sary : but if meat be preferred, a pig’s foot or ham-bone, , &c., may be boiled with the old peas, which is called the stock. More butter than is mentioned above may be used with advantage, if the soup is required to be very rich. When peas first come in, or are very young, the stock may be made of the shells, washed, and boiled, till they will pulp with the above; more thickening will then be wanted. Use spring water for fresh peas soup. j Another, as used in Italy. t Boil three pints of full-grown peas in five pints of | water, until tender enough to pulp through a coarse I sieve; then put the pulp, a cos-lettuce, two good-sized j cucumbers sliced, and a pint of young peas, into the I liquor: stew gently, until the vegetables become ex- tremely tender; then add pepper and salt to your taste, chopped mint, and two ounces of butter rubbed in a spoonful of flour, and boil ten minutes. Dried Green Peas Soup, quite equal to that made of fried Peas. Set on three half pints of split green peas, a quart of soft water, and two ounces of fresh butter; let them gently simmer until they will entirely pass through a colander. Have ready half a pint of spinach-juice and a lettuce, and put with the peas as much water as will make the soup, when boiled, a proper thickness. Let it simmer till •ready -; then remove the lettuce, and add some asparagus-135 SOUPS. heads; or if you have none, two leaves of spinach cut t as small as middling-sized peas; and, with two ounces of butter and a little flour, boil the soup twenty minutes. Young peas may be substituted to great advantage for the asparagus, when they come into season; and the soup being made of the dry split peas will be a great convenience, should the crop be small. Season with pepper and salt, and a good-sized knob of white sugar. Carrot Soup. Put some beef-bones, with four quarts of the liquor in which a leg of mutton or beef has been boiled, tvvo large onions, a turnip, pepper, and salt, into a saucepan, and stew for three hours. Ilave ready six large carrots scraped and cut thin; strain the soup on them, and stew them till soft enough to pulp through a hair-sieve or coarse cloth; then boil the pulp with the soup, which is to be as thick as peas soup. If too thick, add some broth; if the contrary, add a little flour rubbed down ! with two spoonsful of the soup. Use two wooden spoons to rub the carrots through. Make the soup the day before it is to be used. Pulp only the red part of the carrot, and not the yellow. Season with salt, cayenne, and three knobs of white sugar. Onion Soup. Into the water that has boiled a leg or neck of mutton, put carrots, turnips, and (if you have one) a shank-bone, and simmer two hours. Strain it on six onions, first sliced and fried of a light brown ; simmer three hours, skim it carefully, and serve. Put into it a little roll, small dumplings, or fried bread. Spinach Soup. Shred two handsful of spinach, a turnip, two onions, a bead of celeiy, two carrots, and a little thyme and parsley. Put all into a stewpot, with a bit of butter the size of a walnut, and a pint of broth, or the water in which meat has been boiled; stew till the vegetables are quite tender; work them through a coarse cloth or sieve with a spoon:DOMESTIC COOKERY. 136 then to the pulp of the vegetables, and liquor, put a quart of fresh water, pepper, and salt, and boil all together about an hour. Have ready some suet dumplings, the size of a walnut: and before you put the soup into the tureen, put them into it. The suet must not be shred too fine; and take care that it is quite fresh. Beef and Cabbage Soup, as in Scotland. Put a rump, or brisket of beef, of ten or twelve pounds, into ten quarts of water, some carrots, turnips, whole onions, and black pepper, tied in a bit of muslin, and six good-sized cabbages in quarters. Stew slowly six hours, or until the meat be quite tender. Serve the beef in a soup-dish, with the soup and vegetables. All the vegetables are sometimes omitted except the cabbage. Scotch Leek Soup. Put the water that has boiled a leg of mutton into a stewpot, with a quantity of chopped leeks, and pepper and salt; simmer them an hour; then mix some oatmeal with a little cold water quite smooth, pour it into the soup, set it on a slow part of the fire, and let it simmer gently; but take care that it does not burn. Scotch Cockle Leekie. Stew a large fowl, a marrow-bone, and two or three pounds of beef, with two or three Scotch pints of water, and the white ends of two or three dozen of leeks, cut in pieces, until well flavoured. Just before serving, add half a pound of prunes, which, and the fowl, dish with the soup j but not the meat or marrow-bone. The latter, when put to boil, must be divided, and the marrow-bone left uncovered. Another. Put seven pounds of the upper end of a leg of beef, and an old fowl, in a pot, with water enough to cover it, the white parts of two or three dozen of leeks half boiled and sliced, and a pound of prunes. Stew till the meat he tender, skimming it well.SOUPS. 131 Scotch Barley Broth. Set on the fire two ounces of pearl barley, with three ■ Scotch pints of salt water; when it boils, skim it, and I add what quantity of salt beef or fresh brisket you : choose, and a marrow-bone, with a good quantity of I leeks, cabbages, or savoys, and let it simmer four or 1 five hours. Or you may use turnips, onions, and grated 1 carrots. Scotch Mutton Broth. Soak a neck of mutton in water for an hour; cut off the scrag, and put it into a stewpan with two quarts of water. As soon as it boils, skim it well, and then sim- mer it an hour and a half ■, then take the best end of the mutton, cut it into pieces (two bones in each), take some of the fat off, and put as many as you think proper: skim the moment the fresh meat boils up, and every quarter of an hour afterwards. Have ready four or five carrots, the same number of turnips, and three onions, all cut, but not small; and put them in soon enough to get quite tender: add four large spoonsful of Scotch barley, first wetted with cold water. The meat should stew three hours. Salt to taste, and serve all together. Twenty minutes before serving, put in some chopped parsley and some salt. It is an excellent winter-dish. Hare Soup. Take an old hare that is good for nothing else, cut it into pieces, and lay it at the bottom of a soup-pot, with a pound and a half of lean beef, two or three shank- hones of mutton well cleaned, a slice of lean bacon or ham, an onion, and a bunch of sweet herbs; pour on it two quarts of boiling water; cover the pot into which you put these with bladder and paper, and set it in a kettle of water. Simmer it till the hare is stewed to pieces; strain off the liquor, and give it one boil, with an anchovy cut into pieces; and add a spoonful of soy, a little cayenne and salt. A few fine forcemeat-balls138 DOMESTIC COOKERY. fried of a good brown, or small suet dumplings, should be served in the tureen. Ox-Tail Soup. Two or three ox-tails w'ill make it stronger than a large quantity of meat without these, and form a verj' nourishing soup. Make it like gravy-soup, and give it what flavour or thickening you like. Hessian Soup and Ragout. Clean the root of a neat’s tongue very nicely, and half an ox’s head, with salt and water, and soak them after- wards in water only. Then stew them in five or six: quarts of water, till tolerably tender. Let the soup stand to be cold; take ofif the fat, which will make good paste for hot meat-pies, or wall do to baste. Put to the soup a pint of split peas, or a quart of whole ones, tw'elve carrots, six turnips, six potatoes, six large onions, a bunch of sweet herbs, and two heads of celery. Sim- mer them without the meat, till the vegetables are done enough to pulp wdth the peas through a sieve j and the soup will then be about the thickness of cream. Season it with pepper, salt, mace, allspice, a clove or two, and a little cayenne, all in fine pow-der. If the peas are bad, the soup may not be thick enough; then boil it in a slice of roll, and put it through a colander; or add a little rice flour, mixing it by degrees. For the Ragout, cut the nicest part of the head, the kernels, and part of the fat of the root of the tongue, into small thick pieces. Rub these with some of the above seasoning, and put them into a quart of the liquor, kejit out for that purpose before the vegetables were added; flour well, and simmer them till nicely tender. Then jait a little mushroom and ■walnut-ketchup, a little soy, a glass of port wine, and a tea-spoonful of made mustard; and boil all up together before served. If for company, serve with small eggs and forcemeat-balls. This ■way furnishes an excellent soup and a ragout atSOUPS. 139 a small expense, and they are not common. The other part Avill warm for the family. So7ip d-la-Sap. Boil half a pound of grated raw potatoes, a pound of beef sliced thin, a pint of grey peas, an onion, and three ounces of rice, in six pints of water, to five; strain it through a colander; then pulp the peas to it, and turn it into a saucepan again with two heads of celery sliced. Stew it tender, and add pepper and salt; and when you serve, add also fried bread. Portable Soup. Boil one or two knuckles of veal, one or two shins of beef, and three pounds of beef, in as much water only as will cover them. Take the marrow out of the hones: put any sort of spice you like, and three large onions. •When the meat is done to rags, strain it off, and put it into a very cold place. When cold, take off the cake of fat (which will make crusts for servants’ pies), put the soup into a double-bottomed tin saucepan, and set it on a pretty quick fire, but do not let it burn. It must boil fast and uncovered, and be stirred constantly, for eight hours. Put it into a pan, and let it stand in a cold place a day; then pour it into a round soup china-dish, and set the dish into a stewpan of boiling water on a stove, and let it boil, and be now and then stirred, till the soup is thick and ropy; then it is done enough. Pour it into the little round part at the bottom of cups or basins turned upside down to form cakes; and when cold, turn them out on flannel to dry. Keep them in tin canisters. When they are to be used, melt them in boiling water; and if you wish the flavour of herbs, or anything else, boil it first, strain off the water, and melt the soup in it. This is very convenient in the country, or at sea, where fresh meat is not always at hand •, as by this ^eans a basin of soup may be made in five minutes.DOMESTIC COOKERY. 140 Soup maigre. Melt half a pound of butter in a stewpan, shake it round, and throw in six middling onions sliced. Shake the pan well for two or three minutes; then put to it five heads of celery, two handsful of spinach, two cab- bage-lettuces cut small, and some parsley. Shake the pan well for ten minutes; then put in two quarts of water, some crusts of bread, a tea-spoonful of beaten pepper, three or four blades of mace; and if you have any white beet-leaves, add a large handful of them cut small. Boil gently an hour. Just before serving, beat in two yolks of eggs, and a large spoonful of vinegar. Another. Flour and fry a quart of green peas, four onions sliced, the coarse stalks of celery, a carrot, a turnip, and a parsnip; then pour on them three quarts of water. Let it simmer till the whole will pulp through a sieve. Then boil in it the best of the celery cut thin, and a piece of butter rubbed in flour. To stew Beef’s Cheek. Clean and soak well half an ox-head, and a large heel take the meat from the bones, and put it into a coarse pan with three onions shced, and fried brown, without becoming burnt, in butter and flour, a bunch of sweet herbs; of allspice, pepper, and salt, a large spoonful each. Lay the bones close on the meat, and pour on three quarts of water. Cover the pan with a coarse brown paper, tie closely, and let it stand in the oven ten hours; or put it by the side of the fire, in a covered pot. When done, take off the bones, and pour the soup and meat into a pan: when to be used, take off the fat, and having warmed the soup, cut little bits of the meat to come up or not, as may be chosen. A little celery, carrot, and turnip may be boiled in a basin of it in a very short time, if minced small; and the flavour will be improved.141 SOUPS. T>fithout endangering its turning sour, by being put in at first, as meat does not ferment so soon as vegetables. Chicken Broth. Skin an old fowl, cut it down the back, from which re- move the rump and the brown parts adhering to the bones. Wash the fowl, and put it into three pints of water, with two blades of mace, and a spoonful of washed rice: let it boil up, skim it nicely twice, then stop the saucepan close, and simmer three hours. The flavour of parsley, &c., may be given. Veal Broth. Make as above, of the scrag end of neck of veal: a pound to a pint will make it pretty good. Stock for brown or white Fish Soups. Take a pound of skate, four or five flounders, and two pounds of eels. Clean them well, and cut them into pieces; cover them with water, and season them with mace, pepper, salt, an onion stuck with cloves, a head of celery, two parsley-roots sliced, and a bunch of sweet herhs. Simmer an hour and a half, closely covered, and then strain it off for use. If for brown soup, first fry the fish brown in butter, and then do as above. It will not keep more than two or three days. The gravy from potted herrings, or hunter’s beef, gives the most delicious flavour to soups; and in families where fish soups are much used, the former would be found a valuable preparation, if for that purpose only. Eel Soup. Take three pounds of small eels ; put to them two quarts of water, a crust of bread, three blades of mace, some whole pepper, an onion, and a bunch of sweet herbs ; cover them close, and stew till the fish is quite broken; then strain it off. Toast some bread, cut it into dice, and pour the soup on it boiling. A piece of carrot may be put in at first. The soup will be as rich as if made of meat. A quarter of a pint of rich cream,DOMESTIC COOKERY. 142 with a tea-spoonful of flour rubhed smooth in it, is a great improvement. Skate Soup. Make it of the stock directed for fish soup, with an ounce of vermicelli boiled in it, a little before it is served. Then add half a pint of cream, beaten with the yolks of two eggs. Stir it near, but not on the fire. Serve it with a small French roll made hot in a Dutch oven, and then soaked in the soup an hour. Excellent Lobster Soup. Take the meat from the claws, bodies, and tails of six small lobsters; take away the brown fur, and the bag in the head; beat the fins, chine, and small claws, in a mortar. Boil it very gently in two quarts of water, MUth the crumb of a French roll, some ground white pepper, salt, two anchovies, a large onion, sweet herbs, and a bit of lemon-peel, till you have extracted the goodness of them all. Strain it off. Beat the spawn in a mortar, with a bit of butter, a quarter of a nutmeg, and a tea- spoonful of flour: mix it with a quart of cream. Cut the tails into pieces, and give them a boil up with the cream and soup. Serve with forcemeat-balls made of the remainder of the lobster, mace, pepper, salt, a few crumbs, and an egg or two. Let the balls be made up with a bit of flour, and heated in the soup. Crayfish or Prawn Soup. Boil six whitings, and a large eel, (or the eel and lialf a thornback, well cleaned,) with as much water as will cover them; skim them clean; and put in whole pepjier, mace, ginger, parsley, an onion, a little thyme, and three cloves. Boil to a mash. Pick a sufficient num- ber of crayfish, or prawns ; pound the shells and a little roll; but first boil them with a little water, vinegar, salt, and herbs: put this liquor over the shells in a sieve : then pour the other soup clear from the sediment. Chop a lobster, and add this to it, with a quart of good beef- gravy ; and also the tails of the crayfish, or the prawns.GRAVIES. 143 and some flour and flutter; and season as may fle liked, if not fligh enough. Oyster Soup. Take two quarts of fish stock, as directed in page 141 : heat the yolks of ten hard eggs, and the hard part of two quarts of oysters, in a mortar, and add this to the stock. Simmer it all for half an hour; then strain it olf, and put it and the oysters (cleared of the beards, and nicely washed) into the soup. Simmer five minutes: have ready the yolks of six raw eggs well beaten, and add them to the soup. Stir it all well one way, on the side of the fire, till it is thick and smooth, but do not let it boil. Serve with a roll moistened in the soup. Another Oyster Soup, as made at Oystermouth, in South Wales. Make a rich mutton broth, with two large onions, three blades of mace, and black pepper. When strained, pour it on a hundred and fifty oysters, without the beards, and a bit of butter rolled in flour. Simmer gently a quarter of an hour, and serve with a roll. GRAVIES. Observations on Gravies, in addition to those given in common with Soups. As gravy meat is an article of considerable expense in many families where a large table is not kept, every hint which may tend to diminish superfluities, without de- creasing the flavour of the dishes, must be acceptable to a good economist. Gravy may be made quite as good of the skirts of beef, kidney, or milt, or of the liver of a fat ox, as of any other kind of meat, if cut in pieces, fried with onions, and seasoned with herbs and spices, as other gravies. Gravy may also be made of the knuckle of dressed mut- ton, if much be not required. The bones and pieces of meat cut off to make joints appear well, called trimmings, as likewise those of fowls.DOMESTIC COOKERY. 144 may be made by a skilful cook to answer the same pur- pose. All the shank-bones of legs and shoulders of mutton should be thrown into water, and, after good soaking and brushing, be long boiled; the water in which they are done will add greatly to the richness of gravy, as does the jelly of cow-heels. The latter must lie all night in water, which causes the jelly to be of a good colour. When boiled three hours, and become cold, let the fat be carefully taken off; and when apparently quite clear, lay some white paper upon it, rubbing it close with a spoon, which will remove every particle of grease, and it will be as pure as the jelly of a calf’s foot. Tarragon and knotted marjoram, by some called Lon- don thyme, give the flavour of French cookery, and are a great improvement to gravies; but should be added caily a short time before serving. Truffles and morels thicken and improve the flavour of gravies and soups ; half an ounce being carefully washed of each, simmer them in a pint of water, and add the whole. To make Gravy that will keep a xoeek. Cut lean beef thin, put it into a frying-pan without any butter or fat, and set it on a fire covered, but take care it does not burn: let it stay till all the gravy that comes cut of the meat is dried up into it again, often shaking it: put as much water as will cover the meat, and let that stew away. Then put to the meat a small quantity of water, herbs, onions, spice, and a bit of lean ham : simmer till it is rich, and keep it in a cool place. Do not take off the fat till going to be used. Another way. Lay meat at the bottom of a stcnqian, with two or three ounces of butter, and herbs and roots strewed over it: cover close, and set it on a slow part of the stove. When the gravy is drawn out, shake it into the'meat, and let it remain till nearly dried up again; then add as much water as required.145 GRAVIES. Clear Gravy. Slice beef thin; broil a part of it over a very clear quick fire, just enough to give colour to the gravy, but not to dress it; put that and the raw into a very nicely tinned stewpan, with two onions, a clove or two, whole black pepper, berries of allspice, and a bunch of sweet herbs; cover it with hot water, give it one boil, and skim it well two or three times: then cover it, and sim- mer till quite strong. Cullis, or brown Gravy. Lay over the bottom of a stewpan as much lean veal as will cover it an inch thick j then cover the veal with thin slices of undressed gammon, two or three onions, two or three bay-leaves, some sweet herbs, two blades of mace, and three cloves. Cover the stewpan, and set it over a slow fire; but when the juices come out, let the fire be a little quicker. When tlie meat is of a fine brown, fill the pan with good beef broth, boil and skim it, then simmer an hour : add a little water, mixed with as much flour as will make it properly thick: boil it half an hour, and strain it. This will keep a week. Bechamel, or white Gravy. Cut lean veal into small slices, and the same quantity of lean bacon or ham ; put them into a stewpan with a good piece of butter, an onion, a blade of mace, a few mushroom-buttons, a bit of thyme, and a bay-leaf; fry the whole over a very slow fire, but not to brown it; thicken it with flour. Add an equal quantity of good veal or mutton broth, and cream. Let it boil gently one hour, stirring it all the time; strain it through a soup- strainer. A Gravy without Meat. Put a glass of small beer, a glass of water, some pep- per, salt, lemon-peel grated, a bruised clove or two, and a spoonful of walnut-pickle or mushroom-ketchup into a basin. Slice an onion, flour and fry it in a piece of butter till it is brown. Then turn all the above into a LDOMESTIC COOKERY. 146 small tosser "witli the onion, and simmer it covered twenty minutes. Strain it off for use, and when cold, take off the fat. A rich Gravy. Cut beef into thin slices, according to the quantity wanted: slice onions thin, and flour both; frj- them of a light pale brown, but do not on any account suffer them to get black : put them into a stewpan, pour boiling water on the browning in the frying-pan, boil it up and pour on the meat. Put to it a bunch of parsley, rhyme, and savory, a small bit of knotted marjoram, the same of tarragon, some mace, berries of allspice, whole black peppers, a clove or two, and a bit of ham, or gammon of bacon. Simmer till you have extracted all the juices of the meat; and be sure to skim the mo- ment it boils, and often after. If for a hare, or stewed fish, anchovy should be added. Gravy for a Foivl %vhen there is no Meat to make it of. Wash the feet nicely, and cut them and the neck small: simmer them with a little bread browned, a slice of onion, a bit of parsley and thyme, some pepper and salt, and the liver and gizzard, in half a pint of water, till half wasted. Take out the liver, bruise it, and strain the liquor to it. Then thicken it w'ith flour and butter, and add a tea-spoonful of mushroom ketchup, and it will be very good. Veal Gravy. Make it as directed for Cullis, (page 145,) but leave out the spice, herbs, and flour. It should be drawn very slowly i and, if for white dishes, do not let the meat. brown. A less ex'pensivc Veal Gravy. When all the meat has been taken from a knuckle of; ■veal, divide the bones, and lay them, and a pound of the scrag of a neck, in a stew'pot; and, if you like it, an ounce of lean bacon, a bunch of parsley, a little tliyme.GRAVIES. :]47 a bit of lemon-peel, and a dessert spoonful of pepper: add as much water as will cover them. Boil and skim it nicely; stop the pot down close, and let it simmer as slowly as possible three hours. Strain off, and let it stand till cold; then skim it, and take the jelly from the sediment. Pound some mace fine, and boil with two spoonsful of water, and add to the gravy. If cream is to be })ut to it, do not add the salt until the gi'avy comes off the fire. A cheap and pood, Gravy. Fry three onions in butter a nice brown; toast a large slice of bread a considerable time, till quite hard and very brown, but not burnt. Set these, and any bit of meat, or bone of a leg of mutton, &c., and some herbs, on the fire, with water in proportion, and stew till the gravy is thick and rich; add salt and pepper; strain oft', and keep cool. Gravy to make Mutton eat like Venison. Pick a very stale woodcock or snipe, cut it in pieces, (but first take out the bag from the entrails,) and sim- mer with as much unseasoned meat-gravy as you will want. Strain it, and serve in the dish. Strong Fish Gravy. Skin two or three eels, or some flounders; gut and wash them very clean; cut them into small pieces, and put into a saucepan. Cover them with water, and add a little crust of bread toasted brown, two blades of mace some whole pepper, sweet herbs, a piece of lemon-peel, an anchovy or two, and a tea-spoonful of horseradish. Cover close and simmer add a bit of butter and flour .and boil with the above. Savoury Jelly to put into cold Meat Pies. Make it of a small bare knuckle of leg or shoulder veal, or a piece of scrag of that or mutton ; or if the pie be of fowl or rabbit, the carcasses, necks, and heads, added to any piece of meat, will be suflicient, observing L 2148 EOMESTIC COOKERY. to give consistence by cow-heel, or shanks of mutton. Put the meat, a slice of lean ham or bacon, a fagot of different herbs, two blades of mace, an onion or two, a small bit of lemon-peel, a tea-spoonful of Jamaica pep- per bruised, the same of whole pepper, and three pints of water, in a stewpot that shuts very close. As soon as it boils, skim it well, and let it simmer very slowly till (|uite strong; strain it, and when cold, lake off the fat with a spoon first, and then, to remove every particle of grease, lay a clean piece of cap or blotting paper on it. When cold, if not clear, boil it a few minutes with the whites of two eggs, (but do not add the sediment,) and pour it through a nice sieve, with a napkin in it, wdiich has been dipped in boiling water, to prevent waste. Jelly to cover cold Fish. Clean a skate, and put it into three quarts of water, with a calf’s foot or cow-heel, a stick of horseradish, an onion, three blades of mace, some white pepper, a piece of lemon-peel, and a good slice of lean gammon. Stew until it will jelly: strain it off: when cold,remove every bit of fat; take it up from the sediment, and boil it wfith a glass of sherry, the wdiites of four or five eggs, and a piece of lemon. Boil without stirring ; and after a few minutes set it by to stand half an hour, and strain it through a bag or sieve, with a cloth in it. Cover the fish with it, when cold, lightly roughed. PART V. SAUCES, FORCEMEATS, VINEGARS, KETCHUPS, PICKLES, &c. A very good Sauce, especially to hide the had colour of Fowls. Cut the livers, slices of lemon in dice, scalded parsley, and hard eggs; add salt, and mix them with butter; boil them up, and pour over the fowls. This will do for roast rabbit.149 SAUCES. White Sauce for Fricassee of Fowls, Rabbits, White Meat, Fish, or Vegetables. It is seldom necessary to buy meat for this favourite sauce, as the proportion of that flavour is but small. The water that has boiled fowls, veal, or rabbit; or a little broth, that may be in the house; or the feet and necks of chickens, or raw or dressed veal, will suSice. Stew with a little water any of these, with a bit of lemon- peel, some sliced onion, some white peppercorns, a little pounded mace or nutmeg, and a bunch of sweet herbs, until the flavour be good; then strain it, and add a little good cream, a piece of butter, and a little flour : salt to your taste. A squeeze of lemon may be added after the sauce is taken oflF the fire, shaking it well. Yolk of egg is often used in fricassee; but if you have any cream, it is better, as the former is apt to curdle. A very good Sauce for boiled Chickens. Take the eggs and necks, with a small bit of the scrag of veal or mutton j put them into a saucepan with two blades of mace, a few white peppercorns, an anchovy, a head of celery sliced, a bunch of sweet herbs, and a small bit of lemon-peel. Bod these in a quart of water to half a pint. Strain, and thicken it with a quarter of a pound of butter and some flour; boil it five minutes; then put in two spoonsful of mushrooms; and having beaten iqr the yolks of two eggs with a tea-cup of cream, put it into your sauce, and keep shaking it one way over the fire till it is near boiling : then put it into a sauce- tureen. Lemon white Sauce for boiled Fowls. Put the j)eel of a small lemon, cut very thin, into a pint of sweet rich cream, with a sprig of lemon-thyme, and ten white peppercorns. Simmer gently till it tastes well of the lemon : then strain it •, and thicken it with a quarter of a pound of butter, and a dessert-spoonful of flour rubbed in it. Boil it up ; then pour the juice of the lemon strained into it, stirring it well. Dish theDOMESTIC COOKERY. 150 chickens, and then mix a little white gravy, quite hot, with the cream, but do not boil them together; add salt to your taste. Another xohite Sauce for boiled Fowls. Boil a large blade of mace, two cloves, and fifteen peppercorns, in half a pint of soft water, until the flavour be obtained; strain it off", put it into a saucepan, with four anchovies chopped fine, a quarter of a pound of butter rolled in flour, and half a pint of cream. Boil, and stir well, two minutes. Put some in a tureen, and the remainder in the dish. A Sauce for roast Foiols. Put into a small stewpan two slices of ham, a clove of garlic, a laurel-leaf, and sliced onions; add a little good gravy, a sprig of knotted marjoram, and a spoonful of tarragon vinegar : simmer slowly an hour; strain off, and put into the dish or a boat. Sauce for Fold of any sort. Boil some veal-gravy, pepper, salt, the juice of a Seville orange and a lemon, and a quarter as much of port wine as of gravy; and pour it into the dish or a boat. Sauce for cold Fold or Partridge. Rub down in a mortar the yolks of two eggs boiled hard, an anchovy, two dessert-spoonsful of oil, three of vinegar, a shalot, cayenne, if approved, and a tea-spoon- ful of mustard. All should be pounded before the oil is added. Then strain it. Shalot-viuegar, instead of shalot, eats well •, but then omit one spoonful of the common vinegar. Salt to your taste. 'A very fine Mushroom Sauce for Fowls or Rabbits. Wash and j)ick a pint of young mushrooms, and rub them with salt, to take off the tender skin. Put them into a saucepan with a little salt, some nutmeg, a blade of mace, a jjint of cream, and a good piece of butter151 SAUCES. rubbed in flour. Boil them up and stir them till done; then pour it round the chickens, &c. Garnish with lemon. If you cannot get fresh mushrooms, use pickled ones, done white, with a little mushroom-powder with the cream, &c. Sauce for Wild Fowl. Simmer a tea-cupful of port wine, the same quantity of good meat gravy, a little shalot, a little pepper, salt, a grate of nutmeg, and a bit of mace, for ten minutes: put in a bit of butter and flour, give it all one boil, and pour it through the birds. In general they are not stufied, but may be done so if liked. Another for the same, or for Ducks. Serve a rich gravy in the dish ; cut the breast into slices, but do not take them oft’; cut a lemon, and put pepper and salt on it; then squeeze it on the breast, and pour a spoonful of gravy over it before you help. An excellent Sauce for boiled Carp or boiled Turkey. Rub balf a pound of butter with a tea-spoonful of flour, put to it a little water, melt it, and add near a quarter of a pint of thick cream, and half an anchovy chopped fine, not washed ; set it over the fire ; and as it boils up, add a large spoonful of real India soy. If that does not give it a fine colour, put a little more. Turn it into the sauce-tureen, and put some salt and half a lemon : stir it well, to prevent its curdling. Green Sauce for Green Geese or Ducklinys. Mix a quarter of a pint of sorrel-juice, a glass of white wine, some scalded gooseberries, some white sugar, and a bit of butter. Boil them up, and serve in a boat. Liver Sauce. Chop boiled liver of rabbits or fowls, and do it as directed for lemon sauce, (page 149,) with a very little 4DOMESTIC COOKERY. 152 pepper and salt and some parsley; add these to some melted butter, using milk or cream instead of water. Effff Sauce. Boil the eggs hard, and cut them into small pieces ; then put them to melted butter. Onion Sauce. Peel onions, and boil them tender: squeeze the water from them ; then chop them, and add to them butter that has been melted rich and smooth, as will be hereafter directed, but with a little good milk instead of water; boil it up once, and serve it for boiled rabbits, partridges, scrag or knuckle of veal, or roast mutton. A turnip boiled with the onions makes them milder. Clear Shalot Sauce. Put a few chopped shalots into a little gravy, boiled clear, and near half as much vinegar; season with pep- per and salt; boil half an hour. To make Parsley Sauce, lohen Parsley-leaves are not to be had. Tie up a little bruised parsley-seed in a bit of clean muslin, and boil it ten minutes in some water. Use this water to melt the butter; and throw into it a little boiled spinach, minced, to look like parsley. Bread Sauce. Boil a large onion, cut into four, with some black peppers and milk, till the onion is quite a pap. Pour the milk strained on grated white stale bread, and cover it. In an hour put it into a saucepan, with a good piece of butter mixed with a little Hour : boil the whole up together, and serve. Dutch Sauce, for Meat, Fowl, or Fish. Put six spoonsful of water, and four of vinegar, into a saucepan; warm, and thicken it witli the yolks of two eggs. Make it quite hot, but do not boil it; stir it, or153 SAUCES. shake the pan all the time; squeeze in the juice of half a lemon, and strain it through a sieve. Sauce Robart, for Rumps or Steaks. Put a piece of butter, the size of an egg, into a sauce- pan, set it over the fire, and when browning throw in a handful of sliced onions cut small; fry them brown, but do not let them burn; add half a spoonful of flour, shake the onions in it, and give it another fry : then put four spoonsful of gravy, and some pepper and salt, and boil it gently ten minutes : when cold, skim off the fat; add a tea-spoonful of made mustard, a spoonful of vinegar, and the juice of half a lemon; boil it all, and pour it round the steaks. They should be of a fine yellow brown, and garnished with fried parsley and lemon. Benton Sauce, for hot or cold roast Beef. Grate, or scrape very fine, some horseradish, a little made mustard, some pounded white sugar, and four large spoonsful of vinegar. Serve in a saucer. Sauce for Fish Pies, ivhere Cream is not ordered. Take equal quantities of white wine, (not sweet,) vine- gar, oyster-liquor, and mushroom-ketchup; boil them up with an anchovy j strain, and pour it through a fun- nel into the pie, after it is baked. Another. Chop an anchovy small, and boil it up with three spoonsful of gravy, a quarter of a pint of cream, and a bit of butter and flour. Add to the pie when baked. Tomata Sauce for hot or cold Meats. Put tomatas, when perfectly ripe, into an earthen jar, and set it in an oven, when the bread is drawn, till they are quite soft; then separate the skins from the pulp, and mi.x this with capsicum-vinegar, and a few cloves of garlic pounded, which must both be proportioned to the quantity of fruit. Add powdered ginger and salt to your taste. Some white-wine vinegar and cayenne may beDOMESTIC COOKERY. 154 used instead of capsicum-vinegar. Keep the mixture in small wide-mouthed bottles, well corked and in a dry cool place. Apple Sauce for Goose and Roast Pork. Pare, core, and slice some apples; and put them in a stone jar, into a saucepan of water, or on a hot hearth. If on a hearth, let a spoonful or two of water be put in, to hinder them from burning. When they are done, bruise them to a mash, and put to them a piece of butter the size of a nutmeg, and a little brown sugar. Serve it in a sauce tureen. The old Currant Sauce for Venison. Boil an ounce of dried currants in half a pint of water a few minutes; then add a small tea-cupful of bread- crumbs, six cloves, a glass of port wine, and a bit of butter. Stir it till the whole is smooth. Lemon Sauce. Cut thin slices of lemon into very small dice, and put them into melted butter; give it one boil, and pour it over boiled fowls. Carrier Sauce for Mutton. Chop six shalots fine ; and boil them up with a gill of gravy, a spoonful of vinegar, some pepper and salt. Serve in a boat. Queen Marfs Sauce for a Shoulder of Mutton. Let a well-fed shoulder hang till tender. When three parts roasted, put a soup-plate under it, with three spoonsful of hot water, the same of port, a shalot, an anchovy chopped fine, and a little pepper; baste the meat with this, andthd gravy that drops from it. When the mutton is taken up, turn the inside upwards, score it various ways, pour the gravy over, and cover it with a quantity of fried crumbs of bread. Sauce for Lamb. Mix two ounces of butter with two spoonsful of shredSAUCES. 155 parsley, a slialot, and two spoonsful of crumbs of bread; put it into a tosser with two spoonsful of good broth, and as much white wine; simmer ten minutes; season with pepper and salt, and when to be put into the dish, add the juice of a small lemon. Sauce for Veal, or any Meat. Boil an unwashed anchovy, cut small, with a cup of grav)', a glass of port, a shalot minced, and the juice of half a small lemon ; strain, and mix in the dish with the gravy of the meat. Sorrel Sauce for Fricandeau, or roast Veal. Wash three handsful of sorrel; put it into a silver saucepan, or a very new block-tin one, with an ounce of butter, and a little salt. Let it stew, covered, till the leaves have no form; and serve. Ham Sauce. "When a ham is almost done with, pick all the meat clean from the bone, leaving out any rusty part, and all the fat: beat the meat and the hone to a mash with a rolling-pin; put it into a saucepan, with three spoons- ful of gravy; set it over a slow fire, and stir it all the time, or it will stick to the bottom. When it has been on some time, put to it a small bundle of sweet herbs, some pepper, and half a pint of beef gravy ; cover it up and let it stew over a gentle fire. When it has a good flavour of the herbs, strain off the gravy. A little of this is an improvement to all gravies. Save the gravy that runs from hams for the same purpose. Caper Sauce. Cut them once, and put them to melted butter, in which give them one boil up. An excellent substitute for Caper Sauce. Boil, slowly, some parsley, that it may not become a had colour; cut it, hut do not chop fine; put it to meltedDOMESTIC COOKERY. 156 butter, with a dessert-spoonful of vinegar, and a tea- spoonful of salt. Boil, and serve. Capers, when their liquor is exhausted, may be kept by adding fresh vinegar that has been scalded and become cold. Keep them always from the air, which makes them soft. Nasturtiums for Capers. Keep them a few days after they are gathered; then pour boiling vinegar over them, and, when cold, cover. They will not be fit to eat for some months ; but are then finely flavoured, and by many preferred to capers. Sauce Piquante. Put an ounce or two of butter, with two shred onions, a carrot, a parsnip, a little thyme, laurel, basil, two cloves, two shalots, a clove of garlic, and some parsley, into a stewpan; turn the whole over the fire till it becomes brow'n ; then shake in some flour, and moisten it with some broth and a spoonful of vinegar. Let it boil over a slow fire; skim and strain it; then add pepper and salt; and serve with any dish you would wish to be heightened. Sauce Piquante to serve cold. With salad, cut very fine, mince half a clove of garlic and two shalots; add mustard,sweet oil, a little vinegar, salt, and pepper. A very fine Fish Sauce. Put into a very nice tin-saucepan a pint of fine port wine, a gill of mountain, half a pint of fine walnut- ketchup, twelve anchovies, and the liquor that belongs to them, a gill of walnut-pickle, the rind and juice of a large lemon, four or five slialots, some cayenne to taste, three ounces of scraped horseradish, three blades of mace, and two tea-spoonsful of made mustard : boil it all gently, till the rawness goes off; then put it into small bottles for use. Cork them very close, and seal the top.SAUCES. 157 Another. Chop twenty-four anchovies, not washed, and ten sha lots, and scrape three spoonsful of horseradish; which, with ten blades of mace, twelve cloves, two sliced lemons, half a pint of anchovy liquor, a quart of hock or Rhenish wine, and a pint of water, boil to a quart; then strain off; and w'hen cold, add three large spoonsful of walnut-ketchup, and put into small bottles well corked. Fish Sauce without Butter. Simmer very gently a quarter of a pint of vinegar and half a pint of water, (which must not be hard,) with an onion, half a handful of scraped horseradish, and the following spices lightly bruised; four cloves, two blades of mace, and half a tea-spoonful of black pepper. When the onion is quite tender, chop it small with two an- chovies, and set the whole on the fire to boil for a few minutes, with a spoonful of ketchup. In the mean time have ready and well beaten the yolks of three fresh eggs ; strain them, mix the liquor by degrees with them, and when well mixed, set the saucepan over a gentle fire, keeping the basin in one hand, into which toss the sauce to and fro, and shake the saucepan over the fire, that the eggs may not curdle. Do not boil them, only let the sauce be hot enough to give it the thickness of melted butter. Fish Sauce d-la-Craster. Thicken a quarter of a pound of butter with flour, and brown it; then put to it a pound of the best anchovies, cut small, six blades of pounded mace, ten cloves, forty berries of black pepper and allspice, a few small onions, a fagot of sweet herbs, (namely, savory, thyme, basil, and knotted marjoram,) and a little parsley and sliced horseradish; on these pour half a pint of the best sherry, and a pint and a half of strong gravy. Simmer all gently for twenty minutes; then strain it through a sieve, and bottle it for use. The way of using it is, to boil some of it in the butter while melting.158 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Oyster Sauce. Save the liquor in opening the oysters; and boil it ■with the beards, a bit of mace and lemon-peel. In the mean time throw the oysters into cold water, and drain it off. Strain the liquor, and put it into a saucepan with them, and as much butter, mixed with a little milk, as will make sauce enough; hut first rub a little flour with it. Set them over the fire, and stir all the time; and when the butter has boiled once or twice, take them off and keep the saucepan near the fire, but not on it; for if done too much, the oysters will be hard. Squeeze a little lemon-juice, and serve. If for company, a little cream is a great improvement. Observe, the oysters will thin the sauce, so put butter accordingly. Cockles make excellent sauce done as above, ob- serving to clean them from any sand that may be in the shells. Lobster Sauce, Pound the spa'wn, and two anchovies; pour on them two spoonsful of gravy; strain all into some butter, melted as will be hereafter directed; then put in the meat of the lobster: give it all one boil, and add a squeeze of lemon. Another xoay. Leave out the anchovies and gravy; and do it as above, either with or without a little salt and ketchup, as you like. Many prefer the flavour of the lobster and salt only. Shrimj) Sauce. If the shrimps are not picked at home, pour a little water over them to wash them; put them to butter melted thick and smooth: give them one boil, and add the juice of a lemon. [Anchovy Sauce. Chop one or two anchovies without washing; putSAUCES. 159 them to some flour and butter, and a little drop of water: stir it over the fire till it boils once or twice. When the anchovies are good they will be dissolved; and the colour and flavour much better than by the usual way. To melt Butter; ivhichis rarely well done, though a very essential article. Mix, in the proportion of a tea-spoonful of flour to four ounces of the best butter, on a trencher. Put it into a small saucepan, and two or three table-spoonsful of hot water; boil quick a minute, shaking it one way all the time. Milk used instead of water requires rather less butter, and looks whiter. An excellent Currie Powder. Reduce to the finest powder six ounces and a half of coriander seeds, one ounce and a half of cumin seeds, a quarter of an ounce of cardamom seeds, three ounces of turmeric, and half an ounce of ginger, after being cleared of the outsides. Put each sort before the fire to dry; then mix thoroughly. When quite cold, put together twenty drops of oil of cinnamon, ten drops of oil of cloves, and ten drops of oil of nutmeg; and mixing them well, rub by degrees the whole of the powder in a mortar. Keep it in a bottle closely stopped; and have enough for twice using in a small one. To make Mustard. Mix the best Durham flour of mustard, by degrees, with boiling water to a proper thickness, rubbing it per- fectly smooth : add a little salt, and keep it in a small jar close covered, and put only as much into the glass as will be used soon; which should be wiped daily round the edges. Another way, for immediate use. Mix the mustard with new milk by degrees, to be quite ■smooth, and add a little raw cream. It is much softer this way, if not better, and will keep well.DOMESTIC COOKERY. 160 The patent mustard is by many preferred, and it is perhaps as cheap, being always ready; and if the pots are returned, three-pence is allowed for each. A tea-spoonful of sugar to half a pint of mustard is a great improvement, and softens it. Kitchen Pepper. Mix in the finest powder, one ounce of ginger; of cinnamon, black pepper, nutmeg, and Jamaica pepper, half an ounce each; ten cloves, and six ounces of salt. Keep it in a bottle. It is an agreeable addition to any brown sauces or soups. Spice in powder, kept in small bottles close-stopped, goes much farther than when used whole. It must be dried before pounded; and should be done in quantities that may be w'anted in three or four months. Nutmeg need not be done, but the others should be kept in sepa- rate bottles, with a little label on each. To drtj Mushrooms. Wipe them clean; and of the large take out the brown, and peel off the skin. Lay them on paper to dry in a cool oven, and keep them in paper bags, in a dry place. When used, simmer them in the gravy, and they w'ill swell to near their former size: to simmer them in their own liquor till it dry up into them, shaking the pan, then drying on tin plates is a good way, with spice or not, as above, before made into powder. Tie down with bladder; and keep in a drj' place, or in paper. Mushroom Poxoder. Wash half a peck of large mushrooms w-hile quite fresh, and free them from dirt and grit with flannel; scrape out the black part clean, and do not use any that are worm-eaten; put them into a stewpan over the fire without water, with two large onions, some cloves, a quarter of an ounce of mace, and two spoons- ful of wliite pepper, all in powder; simmer a»d shakeSAUCES. 161 them till all the liquor be dried up, but be careful they do not burn. Lay them on tins or sieves, in a slow orven till they are dry enough to heat to powder, then put the powder in small bottles, corked and tied closely, and keep in a dry place. A tea-spoonful will give a very fine flavour to any soup or gravy, or any sauce; and it is to he added just before serving, and one boil given to it after it is put in. To pot Mushrooms, to keep a quarter of a year. Choose large buttons, or such whose inside is not yet the least brown; peel and wipe out the fur of the larger ones; and to every two quarts put half a drachm of pounded mace, two drachms of white pepper, and six or eight cloves in powder: set them over the fire; shake and let the liquor dry up into them. Then put to them two ounces of butter, and stew them in it till they be fit for eating; pour the butter from them, and let them become cold. Pack them close into a pot, making the surface as even as possible; add some butter lukewarm, and then lay a bit of white paper over them, and pour clarified suet upon it to exclude the air. To choose Anchovies. They are preserved in barrels with bay-salt. No other fish has the fine flavour of the anchovy. The best look red and mellow, and the bones moist and oily; the flesh should be high-flavoured, the liquor reddish, and have a fine smell. When the liquor becomes dry, put in a little beef brine. To make Essence of Anchovies. Take two dozen of anchovies, chop them, and without the bone, but with some of their own liquor strained, add to them sixteen large spoonsful of water; boil gently till dissolved, which will be in a few minutes; when cold, strain and bottle it. The quicker the process, the finer will be the colour. MDOMESTIC COOKERY, 162 To make Sprats taste like Anchovies. Salt them well, and let the salt drain from them. In twenty-four hours wipe them dry, hut do not wash them. Mix four ounces of common salt, an ounce of bay-salt,, an ounce of saltpetre, a quarter of an ounce of sal- prunella, and half a tea-spoonful of cochineal, all in the finest powder. Sprinkle it among three quarts of the fish, and pack them in two stone jars. Keep in a cold place ; fasten down with a bladder. These are pleasant on bread and butter •, but use the best for sauce. Browning, to colour and flavour Made dishes. Beat to powder four ounces of double-refined sugar, put it into a very nice iron frying-pan, with one ounce of fine fresh butter, mix it well over a clear fire, and when it begins to froth hold it up higher; when of a very fine dark brown, pour in a small quantity of a pint of port, and the whole by very slow degrees, stirring all the time. Put to the above half an ounce of Jamaica and the same of black pepper, six cloves of shalots peeled, three blades of mace bruised, three spoonsful of mushroom and the same of walnut ketchup, some salt, and the finely-pared rind of a lemon; boil gently fifteen minutes, pour it into a basin till cold, take off the scum, and bottle for use. Casserol, or Rice Edged, for a Currie or Fricassee. After soaking and picking fine Carolina rice, boil it iu water and a little salt, until tender, but not to a mash ; drain, and put it round the inner edge of the dish, to the height of two inches ; smooth it with the back of a spoon, and wash it over with yolk of egg, and put it into the oven for three or four minutes, then serve the meat in the middle. FORCEMEATS. Forcemeats, whether in the form of stuffing-balls or patties, make a considerable part of good cooking, byFORCEMEATS. 163 tlie flavour they impart to 'whatsoever dish they are added if properly made. Exact rules for the quantities cannot easily be given ; but the following observations may be useful, and habit will soon give knowledge in mixing them to the taste. At many tables, where everything else is well done, it is common to find very bad stuffing. According to what it is wanted for should be the selection from the following list, observing that of the most pungent articles least must he used. No one fla- vour should predominate greatly ; yet if several dishes be served the same day, there should be a marked variety in the tastes of the forcemeat, as well as of the gravies. A general fault is, that the tastes of lemon-peel and thyme overcome all others, therefore they should only be used in small quantities. They should be consistent enough to cut with a knife, but not dry and heavy. Herbs are a very essential ingredient; and it is the copious but judicious use of them that chiefly gives the . cookery of tbe French its superior flavour. Forcemeat Ingredients.

The first column contains the articles of which the forcemeat may be made, without any striking flavour; and to those may be added some of the different ingre- dients of the second column to vary the taste. Forcemeat, to force Foxols or Meat. Shred a little ham or gammon, some cold veal or fowl, some beef-suet, a small quantity of onion, some parsley, very little lemon-peel, salt, nutmeg, or pounded mace, and either white pepper or cayenne, and bread- crumbs. Pound it in a mortar, and bind it with one or two eggs, beaten or strained. For forcemeat patties, the mixture as above. Forcemeat for Hare, or any thing in imitation of it. The scalded liver, an anchovy, some fat bacon, a little suet, some parsley, thyme, knotted marjoram, a little shalot, and either onion or chives, all chopped fine, crumbs of bread, pepper, and nutmeg, beat in a mortar with an egg. Forcemeats for mackerel, pike, haddock, and soles, will be found by reference to those articles. For cold savoury Pies. Substitute the fat of bacon for suet, and make as for fowls, adding the livers if the pie be of chicken or rab- bit. Or mix the livers with the fat and lean of fresh pork, and add to it a few crumbs, mace, jiepper, salt,VINEGARS. 165 cayenne, a leaf of dried sage, pounded and incorporated with the other ingredients, and egg. Very fine Forcemeat-halls, for Fish, Soups, or Fish, stewed on maigre days. Beat the flesh and soft parts of a middling lobster, half an anchovy, a large piece of boiled celery, the yolk of a hard egg, a little cayenne, mace, salt, and white pepper, with two table-spoonsful of bread crumbs, one ditto of oyster-liquor, two ounces of butter warmed, and two eggs long beaten : make into balls, and fry of a fine brown in butter. Forcemeat for Turtle, as at the ‘ Bush,' Bristol. A pound of fine fresh suet, one ounce of ready-dressed veal or chicken, chopped fine, crumbs of bread, a little shalot or onion, salt, white pepper, nutmeg, mace, penny- royal, parsley, and lemon-thyme, finely shred : beat as many fresh eggs, yolks and whites separately, as will make the above ingredients into a moist paste : roll into small balls, and boil them in fresh lard, putting them in just as it boils up. When of a light brown, take them out, and drain them before the fire. If the suet be moist or stale, a great many more eggs will be necessary. Balls made this way are remarkably light; but being greasy, some people prefer them with less suet and eggs. Little Eggs for Turtle. Beat three hard yolks of eggs in a mortar, and make into a paste with the yolk of a raw one, roll it into small balls, and throw them into boiling water for two minutes to harden. VINEGARS. As this is so necessary an article in a family, and one on which such great profit is made, it is economical to have a barrel or two always preparing, from such mate- rials as may occur. If the raisins of which wine has been made are ready, that kind might be made; if great plenty of gooseberries166 DOMESTIC COOKERY. makes them eheap, that sort : or if neither, then sugar- vinegar ; so that the cask may not remain empty to grow musty, but as one quantity is bottled off another might be set to do. Wine Vinegar. The raisins must not be pressed, but drained from the liquor : lay them in a tub, in a heap, to heat. In three or four days add fifteen gallons of water to ever)" hundred ■weight. Let the mash be well beaten, and stirred often, for forty-eight hours ; then strain, and press them in a hair bag. Put the liquor into a barrel, with a toast covered with yest. Mind that the cask be full, and set over a tub to work. When it ceases to ferment, cover the bung-hole with a piece of slate. Keep it in a warm place. Gooseberry Vinegar. Boil spring water; and when cold, put to every three quarts a quart of bruised gooseberries in a large tub. Let them remain sixty hours, stirring often; then strain through a hair bag, and to each gallon of liquor add a pound of the coarsest sugar. Put it into a barrel, and a toast and yest; cover the bung-hole with a bit of slate, &c., as above. Set the barrel in the sun, observing that the cask be well painted, and the iron hoops all firm. The greater quantity of sugar and fruit, the stronger the vinegar; and as this is particularly useful for pickles, it might be well to make it of double the strength for that purpose. Sugar Vinegar. To every gallon of spring water put two pounds of the very coarsest sugar; boil and skim thoroughly; then put one quart of cold water to every gallon of hot. When cool, put into it a toast spread with yest. Stir it nine days ; then barrel, and set it in a ])lacc where the sun will lie on it, with a bit of slate on the bung-hole. Observe the caution about the barrel, as above. Make in March; it will be ready in six months.167 VINEGARS. When sufficiently sour it may be bottled, or may be used from the cask with a wooden spigot and faucet; but the former will be most advantageous. Vinegar made of Malt. Pour ten gallons of boiling water on a bushel of malt.; stir it well; let it infuse the usual time, and draw the wort off as in brewing •, but neither boil nor put hops. Work it with yest; and in two days tun it, and put tlie barrel in the sun, with a bit of glass over the bung-hole. Observe, that as there must be enough to fill the cask, some little quantity of water must be allowed for waste. It must be brewed in February, and will be excellent in July, and fit for pickles. Camp Vinegar. Slice a large head of garlic, and put it into a wide- mouthed bottle, with half an ounce of cayenne, two tea-spoonsful of real soy, two of walnut ketchup, four anchovies chopped, a pint of vinegar, and enough cochineal to give it the colour of lavender drops. Let it stand six weeks; then strain off quite clear, and keep in small bottles sealed up. Another Camp Vinegar. Infuse in a quart of the best white-wine vinegar a quarter of a pint of walnut ketchup, the same quantity of mushroom ketchup, and also the same quantity of soy, half an ounce of cayenne, four heads of garlic, ten sbalots, two ounces of black and two ounces of white pepper, the same quantity of pimento and ginger, one ounce of nutmeg, and three blades of mace, with ten cloves, in a wide-mouthed two-quart bottle •, and cover very closely with cork, leather, and bladder. Let it re- main near the fire a montli, shaking it frequently. When any is taken out, put in as much fresh vinegar. This is not only a very fine sauce, but a great preservative against infectious diseases, if taken freely,168 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Cucumber Vinegar. Pare and slice fifteen large cucumbers, and put them in a stone jar, with three pints of vinegar, four large onions sliced, two or three shalots, a little garlic, two large spoonsful of salt, three tea-spoonsful of pepper, and half a tea-spoonful of cayenne. After standing four days, give the whole a boil: when cold, strain, and filter the liquor through paper. Keep in small bottles, to add to salad, or take with meat. Shalot Vinegar. Split six or eight shalots; put them into a quart bottle, and fill it up with vinegar; shake often; stop it, and in a month it will be fit for use. Vinaigrette for cold Foivl, or Meat. Chop mint, parsley, and shalot; mix with salt, oil, and vinegar. Serve in a boat. KETCHUPS. Pontac Ketchup for Fish. Put ripe elderberries, picked from the stalk, into a stone jar, with as much strong vinegar as will cover them. Bake with the bread ; and, while hot, strain. Boil the liquor with a sufficient quantity of cloves, mace, peppercorns, and shalots, to give it a fine flavour. When that is obtained, put in half a pound of the finest ancho- vies to every quart of liquor : stir, and boil only until dissolved. When cold, put it into pint bottles, and tie double bladders over each cork. The same method should be observed for preserving all ketchups. Mushroom Ketchup. Take the largest broad mushrooms, break them into an earthen pan, strew salt over, and stir them now and then for three days. Then let them stand for twelve, till there is a thick scum over : strain, and boil the liquor Avith Jamaica and black peppers, mace, ginger, a clove or two, and some mustard-seed. When cold, bottle it,KETCHUPS. 169 and secure the corks as above, leaving the spice in. At the end of three months, strain the liquor, and boil with fresh spice, which put into the bottles; and in a cool place it will keep two or three years. Mushroom Ketchup, another way. Take a stewpan full of the large flap mushrooms, that are not worm-eaten, and the skins and fringe of those you have pickled ; throw a handful of salt among them, and set them by a slow fire : they will produce a great deal of liquor, which you must strain; and put to it four ounces of shalots, two cloves of garlic, a good deal of pepper, ginger, mace, cloves, and a few bay-leaves; boil slowly, and skim very well. When cold, bottle, and cork close. In two months boil it up again with a little fresh spice, and a stick of horseradish, and it will then keep a year; which mushroom ketchup rarely does, if not boiled a second time. Walnut Ketchup, of the finest quality. Boil or simmer a gallon of the expressed juice of wal- nuts when they are tender, and skim it well; then put in two pounds of anchovies, bones and liquor, ditto of shalots, one ounce of cloves, ditto of mace, ditto of pep- per, and one clove of garlic. Let all simmer till the shalots sink -, then put the liquor into a pan till cold; bottle, and divide the spice to each. Cork closely, and tie bladder over. It will keep twenty years in the greatest perfection, but is not fit for use the first year. Be very careful to express the juice at home ; for it is generally adulterated,, if bought. Some people make liquor of the outside shell, when the nut is ripe ; but neither the flavour nor colour is then so fine ; and the shells being generally taken off by dirty hands, there is much objection to this mode. Cockle Ketchup. Open the cockles, scald them in their own liquor; add a little water, when the liquor settles, if you haveDOMESTIC COOKERY. 170 not enough; strain through a cloth, then season with every savoury spice; and if for brown sauce, add port, anchovies and garlic—if for white, omit these, and put a glass of sherry, lemon-juice and peel, mace, nutmeg, and white pepper. If for brown, burn a bit of sugar for colouring. This is excellent in made dishes, or for fish sauce. Lemon Ketchup, or Pickle. Cut three large juicy lemons across the top, and stuff salt into them ; set them upright in a dish before the fire, and turn them every day. When they become drj', roast tliem in a Dutch oven until they are brown. Boil a quart of vinegar, with a quarter of a pound of ancho- vies, without the bones and scales (but do not w^ash them,) four blades of mace, half a nutmeg sliced, and a spoonful of white pepper ; boil gently ten minutes; then pour it, boiling-hot, on the lemons, in a stone jar, and cover close. Let it stand six weeks, then put it into quarter-pint flat bottles. It is excellent for made dishes, and the lemon eats w'ell. PICKLES. Rules to be observed with Pickles. Avoid as mucli as possible the use of metal vessels in preparing them. Acids dissolve tlie lead that is in the tinning of saucepans, and corrode copper and brass; consequently, if kept in such, for any length of time, they become highly poisonous. When it is necessary to hoil vinegar, do it in a stone jar on a stove. Glazed jars should never be used for pickles, as salt and vinegar dis- solve the lead which is in the glaze. Pickles should be kept from the air ; exposure to it makes them soft. A wooden spoon, with holes in it, should be tied to each jar. Small jars should be occa- sionally replenished from the large ones, to prevent the frequent opening of the latter. For greening pickles, see Young Cucumbers.171 PICKLES. India Pic.kle, Lay a pound of white ginger in water one night; then scrape, slice, and lay it in salt in a pan till the other in- gredients shall he ready. Peel, slice, and salt a pound of garlic three days ; then put it in the sun to dry. Salt, and dry long pepper in the same way. Prepare various vegetables thus : — Quarter small white cabbages, salt three days, squeeze, and set them in the sun to dry. Cauliflowers cut in their branches ; take off the green from radishes ; cut celery in three-inch lengths; ditto young French beans whole, after being stringed; like- "wise shoots of elder, which will look like bamboo. Ap- ples and cucumbers, choose of the least seedy sort; cut them in slices, or quarters if not too large. All must be salted, drained, and dried in the sun, except the latter; over which you must pour boiling vinegar, and in twelve 'hours drain them, but no salt must be used. Put the spice, garlic, a quarter of a pound of mus^- tard-seed, and as much vinegar as you think enough for the quantity you are to pickle, into a large stone jar, and one ounce of turmeric to be ready against the vegetables shall be dried. When they are ready, observe the fol- lowing directions :—Put some of them into a two-quart stone jar, and pour over them one quart of boiling vine- gar. Next day take out those vegetables; and when drained, put them into a large stock jar, and boiling the vinegar, pour it over some more of the vegetables; let them lie a night, and do as above. Thus proceed till you have cleansed each set from the dust which must in- evitably fall on them by being so long in doing; tlien, to every gallon of vinegar put two ounces of flour of mustard, mixing, by degrees, with a little of it boiling- hot. The whole of the vinegar should have been pre- viously scalded, but set to be cool before it was put to the spice. Stop the jar tight. This pickle -will not be ready for a year; but you may172 DOMESTIC COOKERY. make a small jar for eating in a fortnight, only by giving the cauliflower one scald in water, after salting and dry- ing as above, but without the preparative vinegar; then pour the vinegar, that has the spice and garlic, boiling- hot over. If at any time it be found that the vegetables have not swelled properly, boiling the pickle, and pour- ing it over them hot, will plump them. To pickle Cucumbers and Onions sliced. To every dozen of cucumbers put three large onions ; cut both in thick slices, and sprinkle salt over them; next day drain them for five or six hours; then put them into a stone jar, pour boiling vinegar over them, and keep them in a warm place. Repeat the boiling vinegar, and stop them up again instantly; and so on till green : the last time, put pepper and ginger. Keep in small stone jars. To pickle young Cucumbers. Choose nice young gherkins: spread them on dishes; salt them, and let them lie a week. Drain them; and,. putting them in a jar, pour boiling vinegar over them. Set them near the fire, covered with plenty of vine- leaves ; if they do not become a tolerably good green, pour the vinegar into another jar, set it over the hot: hearth, and when it boils, pour it over them again, co- vering with fresh leaves; and thus do till they are of as> good a colour as you wish;—but as it is now knowni that the very fine green pickles are made so by using; brass or bell-metal vessels, which, when vinegar is putt into them, become highly poisonous, few people like to eat them. To preserve the flavour of Cucumbers for Winter Salad,, and as a Sauce for cold Meat. Pare and slice, as for eating, eight large cucumbers;, season well with pepper and salt; put them into a stone> jar with two or three small onions, and as many shalots.- Pour on a quart of boiling vinegar. Cover close, and letPICKLES. 113 it stand four days; then strain the vinegar through a sieve. Put it into four-ounce phials, and some whole black pepper in each. Seal down the corks. The slices of cucumbers will keep in a jar closely co- vered with bladders, without vinegar, and give a very agreeable flavour to hashes. An excellent, and not common Pickle, called Salade. Fill a pint stone jar with equal quantities of onions, cucumbers, and sour apples, all cut into very thin slices, shaking in, as you go on, a tea-spoonful of salt, and three parts of a tea-spoonful of cayenne. Pour in a wine-glass of soy, the same of white-wine, and fill up the jar with vinegar. It will be fit for use the same day. English Bamboo. Cut the large young shoots of elder, w'hich put out in the middle of May (the middle stalks are most tender;) peel off the outward peel or skin, and lay them in salt and water, very strong, one night. Dry them, piece by piece, in cloth. Have in readiness a pickle thus made and boiled : to a quart of vinegar put an ounce of white pepper, an ounce of sliced ginger, a little mace and pi- mento, and pour boiling on the elder-shoots, in a stone jar; stop close, and set by the fire two hours, turning the jar often, to keep it scalding hot. If not green when cold, strain off the liquor, and pour boiling-hot again; keep it hot as before. Or, if you intend to make India pickle, the above shoots are a great improvement to it; in which case you need only pour boiling vinegar and mustard-seed on them; and keep them till your jar of pickles shall be ready to receive them. The cluster of elder flowers, before it opens, makes a delicious pickle to eat with boiled mutton. It is prepared by only pouring vinegar over. Melon Mangoes. There is a particular sort for this purpose, which the gardeners know. Cut a square small piece out of one side, and through that take out the seeds, and mix with174 DOMESTIC COOKERY. them mustard-seed and shred garlie; stuff the melon as full as the space will allow, and replace the square piece. Bind it up with small new packthread. Boil a good quantity of vinegar, to allow' for w'asting, with pep- per, salt, ginger, and pour boiling-hot over the mangoes four successive days; the last, put flour of mustard and scraped horseradish into the vinegar, just as.it boils up. Stop close. Observe that there is plenty of vinegar. All pickles are spoiled if not w'ell covered. Mangoes should be done soon after they are gathered. Large cucumbers, called green turley, prepared as mangoes, are excellent, and come sooner into eating. Mark, the greater number of times boiling vinegar is poured over either sort, the sooner it wdll be ready. 7b pickle Walnuts. When they will bear a pin to go into them, put a brine of salt and water, boiled, and strong enough to bear an egg on it, being quite cold first. It must be well skimmed while boiling. Let them soak six days; then change the. brine, let them stand six more; then drain them, and pour over them in a jar a pickle of the best white-w'ine vinegar, with a good quantity of pepper, pimento, ginger, mace, cloves, mustard-seed, and horse- radish ; all boiled together, but cold. To every hun- dred of w’alnuts put six spoonsful of mustard seed and tw'o or three heads of garlic or shalot, but the latter is least strong. Thus done, they w'ill be good for several years, if close covered. The air w'ill soften them. They will not be fit to eat under six months. When the walnuts are used, boil up the pickle with half a pound of anchovies to a gallon, and a tea-spoonful of cayenne, and you will have a very good ketchup. Another way. But them into a jar, cover them wdth the best vine- gar cold, let them stand four months; then pour off the pickle, and boil as much fresh vinegar as will cover the175 PICKLES. ■walnuts, adding to every three quarts of vinegar one quarter-pound of best Durham mustard, a stick of horse- radish sliced, one half ounce of black pepper, one half- ounce of cloves, one ounce of ginger, one half-ounce of allspice, and a good handful of salt; pour the whole, boiling-hot, upon the walnuts, and cover them close: they will be fit for use in three or four months, and will keep three years. You may add two ounces of garlic or shalot, but not boiled in the vinegar. Of the pickle in which the walnuts stood for the first four months you may make excellent ketchup. An excellent way to pickle Mushrooms, to preserve the flavour. Buttons must be rubbed with a bit of flannel and salt, and from the larger take out the red inside; for when they are black they will not do, being too old. Throw a little salt over, and put them into a stewpan with some mace and pepper ; as the liquor comes out, shake them well, and keep them over a gentle fire till all of it be dried into them again ; then put as much vinegar into the pan as will cover them, give it one warm, and turn all into a glass or stone jar. They will keep two years, and are delicious. To pickle French Beans. Gather them before they become stringy; and without taking off the ends, put them into a very strong brine, until they become yellow; drain the liquor from them, and wipe them dry with a cloth. Put them into a stone jar by the fire, and pour boiling vinegar upon them every twenty-four hours, preventing the escape of the steam: in four or five days they will become green. Do samphire the same way. To pickle Nasturtiums. Gather them young ; lay them in salt and water one night. Drain : then cover them with hot vinegar, boiled with a little black and Jamaica pepper. A couple of capsicums put into the jar will be a great improvement.no DOMESTIC COOKERY. Pickled Onions. In tlie montli of September, choose the small white round onions, take off the brown skin, have ready a very nice tin stewpan of boiling water, throw in as many onions as will cover the top; as soon as they look clear on the outside, take them up as quick as possible with a slice, and lay them on a clean cloth ; cover them close with another, and scald some more, and so on. Let them lie to he cold, then put them in a jar or wide- mouthed glass bottles, and pour over them the best white-wine vinegar, just hot, but not boiling. When cold, cover them. Should the outer skin shrivel, peel it off. They must look quite clear. To pickle red Cabbage. Slice it into a colander, and sprinkle each layer with salt; let it drain two days, then put it into a jar, and pour boiling vinegar enough to cover, and put a few slices of red beet-root. Choose the purple red cabbage. Those who like the flavour of spice will boil it with the vine- gar. Cauliflower cut in branches, and thrown in after being salted, will look of a beautiful red. Pickled Lemons. They should be small, and with thick rinds': rub them with a piece of flannel; then slit them half down in four quarters, but not through to the pulp : fill the slits with salt hard pressed in, set them upright in a pan for four or five days, until the salt melts; turn them thrice a day in their own liquor, until tender; make enough pickle to cover them, of rape-vinegar, the brine of the lemons, Jamaica pepper, and ginger; boil and skim it; when cold, put it to the lemons, with two ounces of mustard-seed, and two cloves of garlic to six lemons. When the lemons are used, the pickle will be useful in fish or other sauces. Olives. They are of three kinds,—the French, Spanish, and Italian. They differ in taste and appearance, and must be chosen accordingly as each is preferred.PIES. m PART VI. PIES, PASTRY, PUDDINGS, FRITTERS, &c. PIES. Observations on Pies. There are few articles of cookery more generally liked than relishing pies, if properly made ; and they may be made so of a great variety of things. Some are best eaten when cold, and in that case there should be no suet put into the forcemeat that is used with them. If the pie is either made of meat that will take more dress- ing, to make it extremely tender, than the baking of the crust will allow, or if it is to be served in an earthen- pie form, observe the following preparation :— Take three pounds of the veiny piece of beef (for in- stance) that has fat and lean ; wash it, and season it with salt, pepper, m^ce, and allspice, in fine powder, rubbing them well in. Set it by the side of a slow fire, in a stewpot that will just hold it; put to it a piece of butter of about the weight of two ounces, and cover it quite close; let it just simmer in its own steam till it begins to shrink. When it is cold, add more seasoning, ' forcemeat, and eggs : and if it is in a dish, put some gravy to it before taking; but if it is only in crust, do not put the gravy till after it is cold and in jelly, as has been described in pages 147 and 148. Forcemeat may ^ be put both under and over the meat, if preferred to balls. Heating the oven properly is very material in baking. : Light paste requires it to be moderately hot; if too i ! quick, it will be burned and not rise well; if too slow, i 1 it will be soddened, not rise, and want colour. Nns DOMESTIC COOKERY. Raised pies must be put into a quick oven, or the crust will fall. The cook should accurately know the proper heat for each article, as opening the door, to observe their progress, lets in the air, and often spoils them. Cakes or tarts which are returned into the oven, after icing, require heat enough to harden only. Raised Crust for Meal. Pies, or Fowls, §-c. Boil water with a little fine lard, and an equal quantity of fresh dripping, or of butter, but not much of either. While hot, mix this with as much flour as you will ■want, making the paste as stiff as you can to be smooth, which you will make it by good kneading and beating it witli the rolling-pin. When quite smooth, put a lump into a cloth, or under a jian, to soak till near cold. Those who have not a good hand at raising crust may do thus: Roll the paste of a proper thickness, and cut out the top and bottom of the pie, then a long piece for the sides. Cement the bottom to the sides with egg,, bringing the former rather farther out, and pinching both together: put egg between the edges of the paste • to make it adhere at the sides. Fill your pie and put on the cover and pinch it and the side crust together.. The same mode of uniting the paste is to be observed 1 if the sides are pressed into a tin form, in which the paste must be baked, after it shall be filled and covered;, but in the latter case, the tin should be buttered, andll carefully taken off when done enough: and as the form i usually makes the sides of a lighter colour than is pro-- per, the paste should be put into tlie oven again for ai quarter of an hour. With a feather put egg over at. first. Perigord Pie. Make a forcemeat chielly of green truffles, a small quantity of basil, thyme, parsley, knotted marjoram, the liver of any kind of game, (if of woodcocks, that,179 PIES. and the entrails, except the little bag,) a small quantity of fat bacon, a few crumbs, the flesh of wild or tame fowls, pepper, and salt. Lard the breasts of pheasants, partridges, woodcocks, moor-game, or whatever birds you have, with bacon of difl'erent sizes: cut the legs and wings from the backs, and divide the backs. Season them all with white pepper, a little Jamaica pepper, mace, and salt. Make a thick raised crust to receive the above articles; it is thought better than a dish: but either will do. Line it closely with slices of fine, fresh, fat bacon; then cover it with stuffing, and put the dif- ferent parts of the game lightly on it, with whole green truffles, and pieces of stuffing among and over it; ob- serving not to crowd the articles, so as to cause them to be under-baked. Over the whole lay slices of fat bacon, and then a cover of thick common crust. Bake it slowly, according to the size of the pie, which will require a long time. Some are made with a pheasant in the middle, whole; and the other game cut up and put round it. Eel Pie. Cut the eels in lengths of two or three inches, after skinning them; season with pepper and salt, and place in the dish, with some bits of butter, and a little water; and cover it with paste. Middle-sized eels do best. Cod Pie. Take a piece of the middle of a small cod, and salt it well one night; next day wash it: season with pepper, salt, and a very little nutmeg, mixed; place in a dish, and put some butter on it, and a little good broth of any kind into the dish. Cover it with a crust; and when done, add a sauce of a spoonful of broth, a quarter of a pint of cream, a little flour and butter, a grate of lemon and nutmeg, and give it one boil. Oysters may be added. Mackerel will do -well, but do not salt them till used. Parsley picked and put in may be used instead of oysters. N 2DOMESTIC COOKERY. 180 An incomparable Ling Pie. Wash and soak the salt out of a piece of the thin part; hoil it slowly; remove the skin, and put layers of the fish and hard egg shced; add chopped parsley, with two ounces of butter in bits among it, till the dish is nearly full. Put in a seasoning made of a large tea cupful of gravy, with pounded mace and white pepper. Lay over it a good puff-paste; and when that is sufficiently baked, put in a cup of hot cream. Sole Pie. Split some soles from the bone, and cut the fins close; season with a mixture of salt, pepper, a little nutmeg, and pounded mace, and put them in layers with oysters: they eat excellently. A pair of middling-sized ones will do, and half a hundred of oysters. Put in the dish the oyster-liquor, two or three spoonsful of broth, and some butter. When the pie comes home, pour in a cup- ful of thick cream, boiled up with a tea-spoonful of flour. Shrimp Pie. Pick a quart of shrimps ; if they are very salt, season them with only mace and a clove or two. Mince two or three anchovies; mix these with the spice, and then season the shrimps. Put some butter at the bottom of the dish, and over the shrimps, with a glass of sharp white wine. The paste must be hght and thin. They do not take long baking. Lobster Pie. Boil two lobsters, or three small, take out the tails, cut them in two, take out the gut, cut each in four pieces, and lay in a small dish, then put in the meat of the claws, and that you have picked out of the body; pick out the furry parts from the latter, and take out the lady; the spawn, beat in a mortar; likewise all the shells; set them on to stew with some water, two or three spoonsful of vinegar, pepper, salt, and some pounded mace; a large piece of butter, rolled in flour,PIES. 181 must be added, when the goodness of the shells is ob- tained ; give a boil or two, and pour into the dish s:trained ; strew some crumbs, and put a paste over all; bake slowly, but only till the paste be done. A remarkably fine Fish Pie. Boil two pounds of small eels; having cut the fins quite close, pick the flesh off, and throw the bones into the liquor with a little mace, pepper, salt, and slice of onion; boil till quite rich and strain it. Make force- meat of the flesh, an anchovy, parsley, lemon-peel, salt, pepper, and crumbs, and four ounces of butter warmed, and lay it at the bottom of the dish. Take the flesh of soles, small cod, or dressed turbot, and lay them on the forcemeat, having rubbed it with salt and pepper: pour the gravy over, and bake. Observe to take off the skin and fins, if cod or soles. Pilchard and Leek Pie. Clean and skin the white part of some large leeks; scald in milk and water, and put them in layers into a dish, and between the layers, two or three salted pil- chards which have been soaked for some hours the day before. Cover the whole with a good plain crust. When the pie is taken out of the oven, lift up the side crust with a knife, and empty out all the liquor; then pour in half a pint of scalded cream. Oyster Pie. As you open the oysters separate them from the liquor, which strain; parboil them after taking off the beards. Parboil sweetbreads, and cutting them in slices, lay them and the oysters in layers, season very lightly with salt, pepper, and mace. Then put half a tea-cup of liquor, and the same of gravy. Bake in a slow oven; and before you serve, put a tea-cup of cream, a little more oyster liquor, and a cup of while gravy, all warmed, but not boiled.182 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Beefsteak Pie. Take beef-steaks that have been well hung; heal them gently with a circular steak-beater : season w'ith pepper, salt, and a little shalot minced very fine. Roll each slice with a good piece of fat, and fill your dish. Put some crust on the edge, and only an inch below it; and a cup of water or broth in the dish. Cover with rather a thick crust, and set in a moderate oven. Beefsteak and Oyster Pie. Prepare the steaks as above, without rolling; and put layers of them and of oysters. Stew the liquor and beards of the latter, with a bit of lemon-peel, mace, and a sprig of parsley. When the pie is baked, boil with the above three spoonsful of cream, and an ounce of butter rubbed in flour; Strain it, and put into the dish. Veal Pie. Take some of the middle or scrag of a small neck; season it; and either put to it, or not, a few slices of lean bacon or ham. If it is wanted of a high relish, add mace, cayenne, and nutmeg, to the salt and pepper, and also forcemeat and eggs; and, if you choose, add truffles, morels, mushrooms, sweetbreads cut into small bits, and cocks’-combs blanched, if liked. Have a rich gravy ready, to pour in after baking.—It will be very good without any of the latter additions. A rich Veal Pie. Cut steaks from a neck or breast of veal; season them with pepper, salt, nutmeg, and a very little clove in powder. Slice two sweetbreads, and season them in the same manner. Lay a puft' paste on the ledge of the dish; then put the meat, yolks of hard eggs, the sweet- breads, and some oysters, up to the top of the dish. Lay over the whole some very thin slices of ham, and fill up the dish with w'ater; cover; and when it is taken out of the oven, pour in at the top, through a funnel, some183 TIES. veal gravy and rich cream warmed together. Lay a paper over the crust, that it may not be too brown. Veal (or Chicken) and Parsley Pie. Cut some slices from the leg or neck of veal; if the leg, from about the knuckle. Season them with salt; scald some parsley that is picked from the stems, and squeeze it dry; cut it a little, and lay it at the bottom of the dish; then put the meat, and so on, in layers. Fill the dish w'ith new milk, hut not so high as to touch the crust. Cover it; and when baked, pour out a little of the milk, and put in half a pint of good scalded cream. Chicken may be cut up skinned, and made in the same way. Cold Veal or Chicken Pie. Lay a crust into a shallow tart-dish, and fdhit with the following mixture :—shred cold veal or fowl, and half the quantity of ham, mostly lean; put to it a little cream; season it with wliite pepper, salt, a grate or two of nutmeg, and a hit of garlic or shalot minced as fine as possible. Cover with crust, and turn it out of the dish when baked: or bake the crust with a piece of bread to keep it hollow, and warm the mince with a little cream, and pour in. Veal-Olive Pie. iMakc the olives as directed in page 65; put them round and round the dish, making the middle highest. Fill it up almost with water, and cover it. Add gravy, cream, flour, and mushroom powder, when baked. Calps-head Pie. Stew a knuckle of veal till fit for eating, with two onions, a few isinglass shavings, a bunch of herbs, a blade of mace, and a few peppercorns, in three pints of water: keep the broth for the pie. Take off a bit of the meat for the balls, and let the other be eaten, but simmer the bones in tlie broth till it is very good. Half- boil the head, and cut it into square bits; put a layer of ham at the bottom ; then some head, first fat, then184 DOMESTIC COOKERY. lean, with balls and hard eggs cut in half, and so on till the dish he full; but be particularly careful not to place the pieces close, or the pie will be too solid, and there will be no space for the jelly. The meat must be first pretty well seasoned with pepper and salt, and a scrape or two of nutmeg. Put a little water and a little gravy into the dish, and cover it with a tolerably thick crust; bake it in a slow oven, and when done, pour into it as much gravy as it can possibly hold, and do not cut it till perfectly cold ; in doing which, observe to use a very sharp knife, and first cut out a large bit, going down to the bottom of the dish ; and when done thus, thinner slices can be cut; the different colours and the clear jelly have a beautiful marbled appearance. A small pie may be made to eat hot, which, with high seasoning, oysters, mushrooms, truffles, morels, &c., has a very good appearance. The cold pie will keep many days. Slices make a pretty side-dish. Instead of isinglass, use a calf’s-foot, or a cow-heel, if the jelly is not likely to be stiff enough. The pickled tongues of former calves’-heads may be cut in, to vary the colour, instead of, or besides, ham. Excellent Pork Pies to eat cold. Raise common boiled crust into either a round or oval form, as you choose; have ready the trimmings and small bits of pork cut off when a hog is killed; and if these are not enough, take the meat off a sweet bone. Beat it well with a rolling-pin; season with pepper and salt, and keep the fat and lean separate. Put it in layers, quite close up to the top ; lay on the lid; cut the edge smooth round, and pinch it; bake in a slow soaking oven, as the meat is very solid. Directions for raising the crust will be given hereafter. The pork may be put into a common dish, with a very plain crust, and be quite as good. Observe to put no bone or water into pork-pie; the outside of the pieces will be hard, unless they are cut small and pressed close.185 PIES. I Mutton Pie. Cut steaks from a neck or loin of mutton that has (i hung; beat them, and remove some of the fat. Season * with salt, pepper, and a little onion ; put a little water t at the bottom of the dish, and a little paste on the edge; then cover with a moderately thick paste. Or raise small pies, and breaking each bone in two to shorten it, season, and cover it over, pinching the edge. When they come out, pour into each a spoonful of gravy made of a bit of mutton. Squab Pie. Cut apples as for other pies, and lay them in rows ^ with mutton chops ; shred onion, and sprinkle it among i them, and also some sugar. Lamb Pie. jk Make it of the loin, neck, or breast; the breast of house-lamb is one of the most delicate things that can be eaten. It should be very lightly seasoned with pep- per and salt, the bone taken out, but not the gristles; and a small quantity of jelly gravy be put in hot; but the pie should not be cut till cold. Put two spoonsful of water before baking. Grass-Lamb makes an excellent pie, and may either be boned or not, but not to bone is perhaps the best. Season with only pepper and salt; put two spoonsful of water before baking, and as much gravy when it comes from the oven. Note.—Meat pies being fat, it is best to let out the gravy on one side, and put it in again by a funnel, at the centre, and a little may be added. Chicken Pie. Cut up two young fowls, season with white pepper, salt, a little mace, and nutmeg, all in the finest powder ; likewise a little cayenne. Put the chicken, slices of ham, or fresh gammon of bacon, forcemeat-balls, and hard eggs, by turns, in layers. If it is to be baked in a dish, put a little water; but none if in a raised crust.186: DOMESTIC COOKERY. By the time it returns from the oven, have ready a gravy of knuckle of veal, or a bit of the scrag, with some shank-bones of mutton, seasoned with herbs, onion,, mace, and white pepper. If it is to be eaten hot, you may add truffles, morels, mushrooms, &c., but not if to be eaten cold. If it is made in a dish, put as much gravy as will fill it; but in a raised crust, the gravy must be nicely strained, and then put in cold as jelly. To make the jelly clear, you may give it a boil with the whites of two eggs, after taking away the meat, and then run it through a fine lawn sieve. Rabbits, if young and in flesh, do as well: their legs should be cut short, and the breast-bones must not go in, but will help to make the gravy. Green Goose Pie. . Bone two young green geese, of a good size; but first take away every plug, and singe them nicely. Wash them clean; and season them high with salt, pepper, mace, and allspice. Put one inside the other, and press them as close as you can, drawing the legs inwards. Put a good deal of butter over them, and bake them cither with or without crust; if the latter, a cover to the dish must fit close to keep in the steam. It will keep long. Gravy-jelly may be added when to be served. Staffordshire Goose Pies Are made with birds prepared and seasoned as above. A goose is to be outward, succeeded by a turkey, duck, fowd, and then lesser birds, tongue, or forcemeat. (Forcemeat may fill up the spaces between the crust and fowds, and be omitted within.) The crust should be ornamented; and the top have a flower or knob, by wdiich to lift it, as it must not be cut, but be kept to cover the pie. A smaller and less expensive pie may be made with- out the goose and turkey. Duck Pie. Bone a full-growm young-duck and a fowd : wash them, and season with pepper and salt, and a small proportionPIES. 187 of mace and allspice in the finest powder. Put the fowl within the duck, and in the former a calf’s tongue, pickled red, boiled very tender and peeled. Press the whole close; the skins of the legs should he drawn in- wards, that the body of the fowls may be quite smooth. If approved, the space between the sides of the crust may he filled with a fine forcemeat, made according to the second receipt given for making forcemeat in page 164. Bake it in a slow oven, either in a raised crust, or pie- dish, with a thick crust ornamented. The cook should begin to bone any bird by first taking out the breast-bone; when she will have sufficient space to remove the liack with a sharp small knife, and then the leg-bones. The skin must be preserved whole; and the meat of the leg be pushed inwards. Giblet Pie. After very nicely cleaning goose or duck giblets, stew them with a small quantity of water, onion, black pepper, and a bunch of sweet herbs, till nearly done. Let them grow cold; and if not enough to fill the dish, lay a beef, veal, or two or three mutton steaks, at bottom. Put the liquor of the stew to bake with the above; and when the pie is baked, pour into it a large tea-cupful of cream. Sliced potatoes added to it eat extremely well. Rabbit Pie. Cut two rabbits, and a pound of fat and lean pork that has lain a week or two in pickle, into small bits; lay them, when seasoned with pepper and salt, into a dish. Parboil the livers, and beat them in a mortar, with their weight of fat bacon and bearded oysters, some pepper, salt, mace, and sweet herbs, chopped fine. Make this into small balls, and distribute in the dish with some arti- choke bottoms cut in dice. Grate half a small nutmeg over, and add half a pint of port, and the same of water. Cover with a tolerably thick crust; and bake it an hour, in a quick, hut not violently heated, oven.188 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Note.—All pies made of white meats or fowls are improved by a layer of fine sausage-meat, if that flavour be approved. Pigeon Pie. Rub the pigeons with pepper and salt, inside and out; in the latter put a bit of butter, and if approved, some parsley chopjied with the livers, and a little of the same seasoning. Lay a beef-steak at the bottom of the dish, and the birds on it; between every two, a hard egg. Put a cup of water in the dish ; and if you have any ham in the house, lay a bit on each pigeon : it is a great improve- ment to the flavour. Observe, when ham is cut for gravy or pies, to take the under part rather than the prime. Season the gizzards, and two joints of the wings, and put them in the centre of the pie; and over them, in a hole made in the crust, three feet nicely cleaned, to show what pie it is. Partridge Pie. Pick and singe four partridges; cut off the legs at the knee; season with pepper, salt, chopped parsley, thyme, and mushrooms. Lay a veal steak, and a slice of ham, at the bottom of the dish ; put the partridges in, and half a pint of good broth. Put puif paste on the ledge of the dish, and cover with the same; brush it over with egg, and bake an hour. Hare Pie, to eat cold. Season the hare after it is cut up ; and bake it, with eggs and forcemeat, in a raised crust, or dish. hen it is to be served, cut oft’ the lid, and cover it with jelly- gravy, as in page 148. A French Pie. Lay a puff paste round the ledge of the dish, and put in either veal in slices, rabbits or chickens jointed; with forcemcat-balls, sweetbreads cut in pieces, artichoke bot- toms, and a few truffles.PIES. 189 Vegetable Pie. ^ Scald and blanch some broad beans: cut young car- rots, turnips, artichoke-bottoms, mushrooms, onions, lettuces, parsley, celery, and add peas; or use any of them you may have. Make them into a nice stew, with a little good veal gravy; season with pepper and salt; bake a crust over a dish, with a little lining round the edge, and a cup turned bottom upwards to prevent it sinking. When baked, pour the stew into the dish, and lay the crust over it. Winter vegetables may be used, at that season, in the same way. A cup of cream is a great improvement. Macaroni Pie. Swell four ounces of pipe macaroni in milk, with a large onion. Put a layer at the bottom of a pie-dish, with some bits of butter and scraped Gloucester cheese sprinkled lightly over. Cover the whole with a well- seasoned beef-steak, then some more macaroni, then a fowl, cut in joints and seasoned; and then another beef- steak ; cover the whole with macaroni, pieces of butter, and grated cheese, instead of crust. Bake in a slow oven. Parsley Pie. Lay a fowl, or a few bones of the scrag of veal, sea- soned, into a dish; scald a colander full of picked parsley in milk; season it; and add it to the fowl or meat, with a tea-cupful of any sort of good broth, or weak gravy. AVhen it is baked, pour into it a quarter of a pint of cream scalded, with the size of a walnut of butter, and a bit of flour. Shake it round, to mi.v with the gravy already in. Lettuces, white mustard leaves, or spinach, may be added to the parsley, and scalded before put in. Turnip Pie. Season mutton-chops with salt and pepper, reserving the ends of the neck-bones to lay over the turnips, which must be cut into small dice, and put on the steaks.il90 DOMESTIC qOOKERY. Put two or tliree good spoonsful of milk in. You may- add sliced onions. Cover with a crust. Potatoe Pie. Skin some potatoes, and cut them into slices : season them ; and also some mutton, beef, pork, or veal. Put layers of them and of the meat. An Herb Pie. Pick two handsful of parsley from the stems, half the quantity of spinach, two lettuces, some mustard and cress, a few leaves of borage, and white beet leaves; -wash, and boil them a little; then drain and press out the water : cut them small: mix, and lay them in a dish; sprinkle with some salt; mix a batter of flour, two eggs well beaten, a pint of cream, and half a pint of milk, and pour it on the herbs; cover with a good crust, and bake. PASTRY. Observations on Pastry. An adept in pastry never leaves any part of it adhering to the board or dish used in making. The best thing to make it upon is a slab of marble or slate ; which sub- stances cause less waste, being cold and smooth. The coolest part of the house, and of the day, should he chosen for the process: the hands should he previously washed in very hot water; and the less they touch the paste the better and lighter it will prove: nor should it he rolled much. In whatever way paste be made, wetting it much will Tender it tough. Salt butter of the best quality makes a fine flaky crust: for sweet things, wash it. Remarks on using freserved Fridts in Pastry. Preserved fruits are usually too dry when put into paste that requires long baking: those that have been done with their full proportion of sugar require no baking: the crust for them should be baked in a tinPASTRY. t shape, and the fruit afterwards added, add a cover may ,he baked on croquant tins. For fresh fruits short crust is very suitable. ^ Tarts may sometimes be iced. Rich Puff Paste. Puffs may be made of any sort of fruit, but it should be prepared first with sugar. Weigh an equal quantity of j butter with as much fine flour as you judge necessary : mix, with a silver spoon, a little of the former with the latter, and wet it with as little water as will make into a stiff paste. Roll it out, ‘and put all the butter over it in slices, turn* in the ends, and roll it thin ; do this twice, and touch it no more than can be avoided. The butter may be added at twice; and to those who are not accustomed to make paste, it may be better to do so. A quicker oven than for short crust. Lay a paper over to keep it from scorching. A less rich Paste. Weigh a pound of flour, and a quarter of a pound of butter, rub them together, and mi.x into a paste with a little w'ater, and an egg w'ell beaten. Roll and fold it three or four times. Another. Rub extremely fine one ])ound of dried flour, six ounces of butter, and a spoonful of white sugar; work up the whole into a stiff paste w'ith as little hot water as possible. Crust for^ Venison Pasty. To a quarter of a peck of fine flour use two pounds and a half of butter, and four eggs: mix into paste with warm water, and work it smooth, and to a good consist- ence. Put a paste round the inside, but not to the bottom of the dish ; and let the cover be pretty thick, to bear the long continuance in the oven.DOMESTIC COOKERY. 192 Transparent Crust for Tarts. Beat an egg till it be quite thin; have ready twelve ounces of the purest well-washed butter, without salt, melted without being oiled ; and when cool mix the egg with it, and stir it into a pound of fine flour well dried. Make the paste very thin; line the pattypans as quickly as you can; and when putting the tarts into the oven, brush them over with water, and sift sugar on them. If they are baked in a lightly-heated oven, they will look beautiful. Paste Royal for Pattypans. Mix a pound of flour with half a pound of butter, two ounces of sugar sifted, and four well-beaten eggs. Flaky Paste. Wet half a pound of the finest flour, dried before the fire, with as much water as will make it into a hard stiff paste: roll it one way. Divide six ounces of butter into little bits, and put it on the paste, with a knife, at three different times; and be careful always to roll it the same way. Croquant Paste for covering Preserves. Dissolve a drachm of sugar in as much cold water as will make four ounces of flour into a paste : knead and beat it as smooth as possible. Roll it to the size of the croquant form, and about a quarter of an inch thick. Rub the form with beef-suet, and lay it on the paste j and press it so closely as to cut the pattern completely through. Then lay it on a tin to bake. With a bunch of white feathers do over the paste with the white of an egg beaten, and sift fine sugar on it. Bake it in a slow oven; and gently remove the paste from the tin while yet warm, and lay it over the fruit it is to cover. The same cover will serve many times, if kept in a dry place. Rich Paste for Sweets. Boil a quarter of a pound of ground rice in the smallest quantity of water : strain from it all the193 PASTRY. moisture as •well as you can ; beat it in a mortar with half an ounce of butter, and one egg well beaten, and it will make an excellent paste for tarts, &c. Rice Paste for relishing things. Clean and put some rice, with an onion, and a little water and milk, or milk only, into a saucepan, and simmer till it swell. Put seasoned chops into a disli, and cover it with the rice; by the addition of an egg, the rice will adhere better. Rabbits fricasseed, and covered thus, are very good. Potato Paste. Pound boiled potatoes very fine, and add, while warm, a sufficiency of butter to make the mash hold together, or you may mix witli it an egg : then, before it gets cold, flour the board pretty well, to prevent it from sticking, and roll it to the thickness wanted. If it is become quite cold before it be put on the dish, it will be apt to crack. Raised Crust for Custards or Fruit. Put four ounces of butter into a saucepan with water, and when it boils pour it into as much flour as you choose ; knead and beat it till smooth; cover it, as at page 178. Raise it; and if for custard, put a paper within, to keep out the sides till half done, then fill with a cold mixture of milk, egg, sugar, and a little peach- water, lemon-peel, or nutmeg. By cold is meant, that the egg is not to be warmed, but the milk should be warmed by itself—not to spoil the crust. The above butter will make a great deal of raised crust, which must not be rich, or it will be difficult to prevent the sides from falling. Excellent short Crust. Make two ounces of white sugar, pounded and sifted, quite dry ; then mix it with a pound of flour well dried, rub into it three ounces of butter, so fine as not to be seen ; into some cream put the yolks of two eggs, beaten, uDOMESTIC COOKERY. 194 RDd mix tlie above into a smooth paste; roll it thin, and bake it in a moderate oven. Another. Mix with a pound of fine flour dried, an ounce of sugar pounded and sifted ; then crumble three ounces of butter in it, till it looks all like flour, and, with a gill of boiling cream, work it up to a fine paste. Another, not sweet, but rich. Rub six ounces of butter in eight ounces of fine flour ; mix it into a stiffish paste, with as little water as pos- sible; beat it well and roll it thin. This, as well as the former, is proper for tarts of fresh or preserved fruits. -Bake in a moderate oven. A verrj fine Crust for Orange Cheesecakes or Sweetmeats, when to be particularly nice. Dry a pound of the finest flour, mix with it three ounces of refined sugar; then work half a pound of butter with your hand till it come to froth; put the flour into it by degrees, and work into it, well beaten and strained, the yolks of three and whites of two eggs. If too limber, put some flour and sugar, to make it fit to roll. Line your pattypans, and fill. A little above fifteen minutes will bake them. Against they come out, have ready some refined sugar beat up with the white of an egg, as thick as you can ; ice them all over, set them in the oven to harden, and serve cold^ Use fresh butter. Light Paste for Tarts and Cheesecakes. Beat the white of an egg to a strong froth; then mix it with as much water as will make three-quarters of a pound of fine flour into a very stiff paste : roll it very thin, then lay the third part of half a pound of butter upon it in little bits ; dredge it with some flour left out at first, and roll it up tight. Roll it out again, and put the same proportion of butter; and so proceed till all be worked up.195 PASTHY. Icing for Tarts. Beat the yolk of an egg and some melted butter well together, wash the tarts with a feather, and sift sugar over as you put them into the oven. Or beat white of egg, wash the paste, and sift white sugar. To prepare Venison for Pasty. Take the bones out, then season and beat the meat, lay it into a stone jar in large pieces, pour upon it some plain drawn beef-gravy, but not a strong one; lay the bones on the top, then set the jar in a water-bath, that is, a saucepan of water over the fire; simmer three or four hours, then leave it in a cold place till next day. Remove the cake of fat, lay the meat in handsome pieces on the dish; if not sufficiently seasoned, add more pepper, salt, and pimento, as necessary. Put some of the gravy, and keep the remainder for the time of serving. If the venison be thus prepared, it will not require so much time to bake, or such a very thick crust as is usual, and by which the under part is seldom done through. Venison Pasty. A shoulder boned makes a good pasty, but it must be beaten and seasoned, and the want of fat supplied hy that of a fine well-hung loin of mutton, steeped twenty-four hours in equal parts of rape, vinegar, and port. The shoulder being sinewy, it will be of advantage to rub it well with sugar for two or three days ; and when to be used wipe it perfectly clean from it and the wine. A mistake used to prevail, that venison could not be baked too much; but as above directed, three or four hours in a slow oven will be sufiScient to make it tender, and the flavour w'ill be preserved. Either in shoulder or side the meat must be cut in pieces, and laid with fat between, that it may be proportioned to each person, without breaking up the pasty to find it. Lay some 0 2DOMESTIC COOKERV. 196 pepper and salt at the bottom of the dish, and some butter, then the meat nicely packed, that it may be suf- ficiently done, but not lie hollow, to harden at the edges. The venison bones should be boiled with some fine old mutton ; of this gravy put half a pint cold into the dish ; then lay butter on the venison, and cover as well as line the sides with a thick crust, but do not put one under the meat. Keep the remainder of the gravy till the pasty comes from the oven ; put it into the middle by a funnel, quite hot, and shake the dish to mix well. It should be seasoned with pepper and salt. To make a Pasty of Beef or Mutton, to eat as well as Venison. Bone a small rump or piece of sirloin of beef, or a fat loin of mutton, after hanging several days. Beat it very well with a rolling-pin : then rub ten pounds of meat with four ounces of sugar, and pour over it a glass of port, and the same of vinegar. Let it lie five days and nights; wash and wipe the meat very dry, and season it veiy high with pepper, Jamaica pepper, nut- meg, and salt. Lay it in your dish, and to ten pounds jmt one pound or near of butter; spread it over the meat. Put a crust round the edges and cover with a thick one, or it will be overdone before the meat be soaked; it must be done in a slow oven. Set the bones in a pan in the oven, with no more water than will cover them, and one glass of port, a little pepper and salt, that you may have a little rich gravy to add to the pasty when drawn. Note.—Sugar gives a greater shortness and better flavour to meats than salt, too great a quantity of which hardens; and it is quite as great a preservative, except from the fly. Apple Pie. Pare and core the fruit, having wiped the outside ; which, with the cores, boil with a little water till it tastes well; strain, and put a little sugar, and a bit of197 PASTRY. bruised cinnamon, and simmer again. In the mean time place the apples in a dish, a j)aste being put round the edge; when one layer is in, sprinkle half the sugar, shred lemon-peel, and squeeze some juice, or a glass of eider. If the apples have lost their spirit, put in the rest of the apples, sugar, and the liquor that you have boiled. Cover with paste. You may add some butter when cut, if eaten hot; or put quince-marmalade, orange-paste, or cloves, to flavour. Cherry Pie Should have a mixture of currants or raspberries, or both. Currant Pie With or without raspberries. Mince Pies. Of scraped beef or tongue, free from skin and strings, w’eigh 21b., 4lb. of suet picked and chopped, then add 61b. of currants nicely cleaned and perfectly dry, jar- raisins stoned and chopped 2lb., 3lb of chopped apples, the peel and juice of two lemons, a pint of sweet wine, a quarter of a pint of brandy; a nutmeg, a quarter of an ounce of cloves, ditto mace, ditto pimento, in finest powder; press the whole into a deep pan when well mixed, and keep it covered in a dry, cool place. Half the quantity is enough, unless for a very large family. Have citron, orange, and lemon peel ready, and jmt some of each in the pies when made. Mince Pies, without Meat. Of the best apples six pounds, pared, cored, and minced ; of fresh suet, and raisins stoned, each three pounds, likewise minced: to these add of mace and cin- namon, a quarter of an ounce each, and eight cloves, in finest powder, three pounds of the finest powder sugar, three-quarters of an ounce of salt, the rinds of four and juice of two lemons, half a pint of port, the same of brandy. Mix well, and put into a deep pan.198 DOMESTIC COOKEKY. Have ready washed and dried four pounds of currants, and add as you make the pies, with candied fruit. Lemon Mince Pies. Squeeze a large lemon, hoil the outside till tender enough to beat to a mash, add to it three large apples chopped, and four ounces of suet, half a pound of cur- rants, four ounces of sugar ; put the juice of the lemon, and candied fruit, as for other pies. Make a short crust, and fill the pattypans as usual. Egg Mince Pies. Boil six eggs hard, shred them small ; shred double the quantity of suet:'then put currants washed and picked, one pound, or more if the eggs are large ; the peel of one lemon shred very fine, and the juice, six spoonsful of sweet wine, mace, nutmeg, sugar, a very little salt; orange, lemon, and citron candied. Make a light paste for them. Tart de Mai. Put into a dish a light paste, then layers of all kinds of sweetmeats, butter, biscuits, and marrow'. Make a moderately rich custard, not very sweet, and seasoned with orange-flower w'ater; give it a scald, and pour over the whole. Half an hour w'ill bake it. Turn it out, to eat hot or cold. Pippin Tarts. Pare thin two Seville or China oranges, boil the peel tender, and shred it fine ; pare and core twenty apples, and put them in a stewpan, and as little water as pos- sible ; when half done, add half a pound of sugar, the orange-peel and juice; hoil till jrretty thick. When cold, put it into a shallow dish, or pattypans lined with paste, to turn out, and he eaten cold. Prime Tart. Give prunes a scald, take out the stones and break them; put the kernels into a little cranberry-juice, with199 PASTRY. the prunes and sugar; simmer; and when cold make a tart of the sweetmeat. To ■prepare Cranberries for Tarts. Simmer them in moist sugar, without breaking, twenty minutes; and let them become cold before used. A pint will require nearly three ounces of sugar. The Russian and American sorts are larger and better flavoured than those of this country. The juice, when expressed from the baked fruit, and Sweetened, makes a fine drink in fevers. Stewed with sugar, they eat excellently with bread. Orange Tart. Squeeze, pulp, and boil two Seville oranges tender, weigh them, and double of sugar: beat both together to a paste, and then add the juice and pulp of the fruit, and the size of a walnut of fresh butter, and heat all together. Choose a very shallow dish, line it with a light puff-crust, and lay the paste of orange in it. You may ice it. Orange Tartlets or Puffs. Line small pattypans; or roll paste, if for the latter. When baked, put in orange-marmalade made with apple- jelly. Lemon Tart. Pare, rather thick, the rinds of four lemons, which boil tender in two waters, and beat fine. Add to it four ounces of blanched almonds, cut thin, four ounces of lump sugar, the juice of the lemons, and a little grated peel. Simmer to a syrup ; when cold, turn it into a shallow tin tart-dish, lined with a rich thin puff-paste, and lay bars of the same over. As soon as the paste is baked, take it out. CocUin Tart. Scald the fruit as wdll be directed under that article; when ready, take off the thin skin, and lay them whole in a dish, put a little of the water that the apples were200 DOMESTIC COOKERY. boiled in at bottom, strew them over with lumii sugar or fine Lisbon; when cold, put a paste round the edges and over. You may wet it with white of egg, and strew sugar over, which looks well; or cut the lid in quarters, without touching the paste on the edge of the dish; and either put the broad end downwards, and make the point stand up, or remove the lid altogether. Pour a good custard over it when cold ; sift sugar over. Or line the bottom of a shallow dish with paste ; lay the apples in it, sw'ceten, and lay little twists of paste over in bars. Rhubarb Tart. Cut the stalks in lengths of four or five inches, and take off the thin skin. If you have a hot hearth, lay them in a dish, and put over a thin syrup of sugar and water, cover with another dish, and let it simmer very slowly an hour : or do them in a block-tin saucepan. When cold, make into a tart as codlin. When tender, the baking the crust will he sufficient. Another loaxj. Take the stalks from the leaves, and peel off the thin skin; cut them into pieces about an inch long, and as you do so sprinkle a little fine sugar into the basin. For a quart basin, heaped, take a pound of common lump sugar; hoil it in nearly half a pint of water to a thin syrup : when skimmed, put the rhubarb into it, and as it simmers, shake the pan often over the fire. It will turn yellow at first; but keep it very gently doing until it greens, and then take it oti’. When cold, lay it in the tart dish, with only as much s}Tup as will make it very moist. Put a light crust over it; and when that is baked, the tart will he done enough. Quarter the crust, and fill the dish with custard or cream. Raspberry Tart with Cream. Roll out some thin pull-paste, and lay it in a patty- pan of what size you choose; put in raspberries; strew over them fine sugar ; cover with a thin lid, and thenPASTRY. 201 I f bake. Cut it open, and have ready the following mix- I ture, warm : half a pint of cream, the yolks of two or three eggs well beaten, and a little sugar; and when this is added to the tart, return it to the oven for five or six minutes. Fried Patties. Mince a bit of cold veal and six oysters, mixed with a few crumbs of bread, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and a very small bit of lemon-peel; add the liquor of the oysters; warm all in a tosser, but do not boil; let it get cold ; have ready a good puff-paste, roll thin, and cut it in round or square hits ; put some of the above between two of them, twist the edges to keep in the gravy, and fry them of a fine brown. Tliis is a very good thing; and baked, is a fashionable dish. Wash all patties over with egg before baking. Oyster Patties. Put a fine puff-crust into small pattypans, and cover with paste, with a bit of bread in each; and against they are baked have ready the following to fill with, taking out the bread. Take off the beards of the oysters, cut the other parts in small bits, put them in a small tosser with a grate of nutmeg, the least white pepper and salt, a morsel of lemon-peel, cut so small that you can scarcely see it, a little cream, and a little of the oyster liquor. Simmer a few minutes before you fill. Observe to put a bit of crust into all patties, to keep them hollow while baking. Lobster Patties. Make w'ith the same seasoning, a little cream, and the smallest bit of butter. Podovies, or Beef Patties. Shred underdone dressed beef with a little fat, season with pepper, salt, and a little shalot or onion. Make a j)lain paste, roll it thin, and cut in shape like an appleDOMESTIC COOKERY. 202 puflF, fill it with mince, pincli the edges, and fry them of a nice brown. The paste should be made with a small quantity of butter, egg, and milk. Veal Patties. Mince some veal that is not quite done, with a little parsley, lemon-peel, a scrape of nutmeg, and a bit of salt; add a little cream and gravy just to moisten the meat; and if you have any ham, scrape a little, and add to it. Do not warm it till the patties are baked. Turkey Patties. Mince some of the white part, and with grated lemon, nutmeg, salt, a very little white pepper, cream, and a very little bit of butter warmed, fill the patties. A good Mince for Patties. Two ounces of ham, four of chicken or veal, one egg boiled hard, three cloves, a blade of mace, pepper, and salt, in fine powder. Just before you serve, warm the above with four spoonsful of rich gravy, the same of cream, and an ounce of butter. Fill as usual. Sweet Patties. Chop the meat of a boiled calf’s foot, of which you use the liquor for jelly, two apples, one ounce of orange and lemon peel candied, and some fresh peel and juice; mix with them half a nutmeg grated, the yolk of an egg, a spoonful of brandy, and four ounces of currants, washed and dried. Bake in small pattypans. Patties resembling Mince Pies. Chop the kidney and fat of cold veal, apple, orange, and lemon-peel candied, and fresh currants, a little wine, two or three cloves, a little brandy, and a bit of sugar. ^Bake as before. Apple Pnffs. Pare and core the fruit, and either stew them in a stone jar on a hot hearth, or bake them. When cold, mix the pulp of the apple with sugar and lemon-peel shred fine,PASTRY. 203 taking as little of the apple-juice as you can. Bake them in thin paste, in a quick oven; a quarter of an hour will do them, if small. Orange or quince marmalade is a great improvement. Cinnamon pounded, or orange- flower water, in change. Lemon Pvffs. Beat and sift a pound and a quarter of double-refined sugar; grate the rind of two large lemons, and mix it well with the sugar; then beat the whites of three new- laid eggs a gi-eat while, add them to the sugar and peel, and beat it for an hour; make it up in any shape you please, and bake it on paper put on tin plates, in a mo- derate oven. Do not remove the paper till cold. Oil- ing the paper will make it come oft' with ease. Cheese Puffs. Strain cheese-curd from the whey, and beat half a pint basin of it fine in a mortar, with a spoonful and a half of flour, three eggs, hut only one white, a spoonful of orange-flower water, a quarter of a nutmeg, and sugar to make it pretty sweet. Lay a little of this paste, in very small round cakes, on a tin plate. If the oven is hot, a quarter of an hour will bake them. Serve with pudding sauce. Excellent Light Puffs. . Mix two spoonsful of flour, a little grated lemon-peel, some nutmeg, half a spoonful of brandy, a little loaf- sugar, and one egg; then fry it enough, but not brown; beat it in a mortar with five eggs, whites and yolks; put .a quantity of lard in a frj’ing-pan, and when quite hot drop a dessert-s])oonful of batter at a time: turn as they brown. Serve them immediately with sweet sauce. Cheap and excellent Custards. Boil three pints of new milk, with a bit of lemon-peel, a bit of cinnamon, two or three bay leaves, and sweeten it. Meanwhile rub down smooth a large spoonful of rice-flour into a cup of cold milk, and mix with it two204 DOMESTIC COOKERY. yolks of eggs well beaten. Take a basin of the boiling milk, and mix with the cold, and then pour that to the boiling; stirring it one way till it begins to thicken, and is just going to boil up; and then pour it into a pan, stir it some time, add a large spoonful of peach-water, two tea-spoonsful of brandy, or a little ratafia. Marbles, boiled in custard, or any thing likely to bum, will, by shaking them in the saucepan, prevent it from catching. Rich Custard. Boil a pint of milk with lemon-peel and cinnamon; mix a pint of cream, and the yolks of five eggs well beaten; when the milk tastes of the seasoning, sweeten it enough for the whole; pour it into the cream, stirring it well; then give the custard a simmer till of a proper thickness. Do not let it boil; stir the whole time one way ; season as above. If to be extremely rich, put no milk, but a quart of cream to the eggs. Baked Custard. Boil one pint of cream, half a pint of milk, with mace, cinnamon, and lemon-peel, a little of each. When cold, mi.x the yolks of three eggs; sweeten, and make your cups or paste nearly full.

Boil a pint of cream, with some mace, cinnamon, and a little lemon-peel; strain it; and when cold, add it to the yolks of four, and whites of two eggs, a little orange- flower water, and sugar to your taste. A little nutmeg and two spoonsful of sweet wine may be added, if ap- proved. Mix well; and bake in cups. Lemon Custard. Beat the yolks of eight eggs till they are as white as milk; then put to them a pint of boiling water, the rinds of two lemons grated, and the juice sw’eetened to your taste. Stir it on the fire till thick enough : then add a205 PASTRY. I large glass of rich wine, and half a glass of brandy; give I the whole one scald, and put in cups to be eaten cold. i Orange Custard. I Boil very tender the rind of half a Seville orange; » beat it in a mortar to a paste ; put to it a spoonful of the i best brand}'^, the juice of a Seville orange, four ounces of S lump sugar, and the yolks of four eggs beaten. Beat ! all together ten minutes; and pour in, by degrees, a pint of boiling cream. Keep beating until the mixture be cold : then put into custard cups, and set them in a soup-dish of boiling water; let them stand until thick, then put preserved orange-peel, in slices, upOn the cus- tard. Serve either hot or cold. Almond Custard. Blanch and beat four ounces of almonds fine with a spoonful of water; beat a pint of cream with two spoons- ful of rose-water, and put them to the yolks of four eggs, and as much sugar as will make it pretty sweet; then add the almonds; stir it all over a slow fire till it is of a proper thickness, but do not boil. Pour it into cups. Cheesecakes. Strain the whey from the curd of two quarts of milk; when rather dry, crumble it through a coarse sieve, and mix with six ounces of fresh butter, one ounce of pounded blanched almonds, a little orange-flower water, half a glass of raisin wine, a grated biscuit, four ounces of currants, some nutmeg and cinnamon in fine powder, and beat all the above with three eggs, and half a pint of cream, till quite light; then fill the pattypans three parts full. A plainer sort. Turn three quarts of milk to curd, break it, and drain the whey : when dry, break it in a pan, with two ounces of butter, till perfectly smooth; put to it a pint and a half of thin cream or good milk, and add sugar, cinna- mon, nutmeg, and three ounces of currants.DOMESTIC COOKERY. 206 Cheesecakes another way. Mix the curd of three quarts of milk, a pound of cur- rants, twelve ounees of Lisbon sugar, a quarter of an ounce of cinnamon, ditto of nutmeg, the peel of one lemon, chopped so fine that it becomes a paste, the yolks of eight and whites of six eggs, a pint of scalding cream, and a glass of brandy. Put a light thin puff-paste in the pattypans, and three parts fill them. Lemon Cheesecakes. Mix four ounces of sifted lump sugar and four ounces of butter, and gently melt it; then add the yolks of two and the white of one egg, the rind of three lemons shred fine, and the juice of one and a half, one Savoy biscuit, some blanched almonds pounded, three spoonsful of brandy; mix well, and put in paste made as follows: eight ounces of flour, six ounces of butter ; two-thirds of which mix with the flour first; then wet it with six spoonsful of water, and roll the remainder in. Another way. Boil two large lemons, or three small ones, and after squeezing, pound them well together in a mortar, with four ounces of loaf sugar, the yolks of sLx eggs, and eight ounces of fresh butter. Fill the pattypans half full. Orange Cheesecakes. When you have blanched half a pound of almonds, beat them very fine, with orange-flower water, and half a pound of fine sugar beaten and sifted, a pound of butter that has been melted carefully without oiling, and which must be nearly cold before you use it; then beat the yolks of ten and whites of four eggs; pound two candied oranges, and a fresh one with the bitterness boiled out, in a mortar, till as tender as marmalade, without any lumps; and beat the whole together, and put into patty- pans. Bread CheesecakeSi Pour a pint of boiling cream on the crumb of a penny-PASTKT. 207 loaf; let it stand two hours. Mix half a pound of butter warm, with eight eggs and a grated nutmeg. Beat the whole in a mortar; then add half a pound of currants ' washed and dried, two ounces of sugar, a spoonful of ' wine, and the same of brandy. Potato Cheesecakes. Boil six ounces of potatoes, and four ounces of lemon- ' peel; beat the latter in a marble mortar, with four » ounces of sugar; then add the potatoes beaten, and four ) ounces of butter melted in a little cream. When well i mixed, let it stand to grow cold. Put crust in ])atty- pans, and rather more than half fill them. Bake in a quick oven half an hour; sifting some double-refined sugar on them when going to the oven. This quantity will make a dozen. Almond Cheesecakes. Blanch and pound four ounces of almonds, and a few bitter, with a spoonful of water ; then add four ounces of sugar, pounded, a spoonful of cream, and the whites of two eggs, well beaten ; mix all as quick as possible; put into very small pattypans, and bake in a pretty warm oven under twenty minutes. Another way. Blanch and pound four ounces of almonds, with a little orange-flower or rose water; then stir in the yolks of six and whites of three eggs well beaten, five ounces of butter warmed, the peel of a lemon grated, and a little of the juice; sweeten with fine Lisbon sugar. When well mixed, bake in a delicate paste, in small pans. Another way. Press the whey from as much curd as will make two dozen small ones; then put it on the back of a sieve, and with half an ounce of butter rub it through with the back of a spoon; put to it six yolks and three whites of eggs, and a few bitter almonds pounded, with as much sugar as will make the curd properly sweet: mix with208 DOMESTIC COOKERY. it the rind of a lemon grated, and a glass of brandy. Put a puff' paste into the pans, and ten minutes -will bake them. To prepare Fruit for Children : a far more loholesome loay than in Pies or Puddings. Put apples, sliced, or plums, currants, gooseberries, &c., into a stone jar ; and sprinkle among them as much Lisbon sugar as necessary. Set the jar in an oven, or on a hearth, with a tea-cupful of water, to prevent the fruit from burning ; or put the jar into a saucepan of water, till its contents be perfectly done. Slices of bread, or rice, may be put into the jar, or served to eat with the fruit. Potato Pasty. Boil, peel, and mash potatoes as fine as possible : mix them with salt, pepper, and a good bit of butter. Make a paste ; roll it out thin like a large puff, and put in the potato; fold over one half, pinching the edges. Bake in a moderate oven. Potato Wall, or Edging, to serve round Fricassee of Fish. Mash in a mortar as many potatoes as you may want, with a good piece of butter. Then, with the bowls of two silver spoons, raise a wall of it two inches and a half high, within the rim of the dish to be used. Let the upper part be a little thinner than the lower; smooth it; and after brushing it all over with egg, put it into the oven to become hot, and a little coloured. Before egging it, the outside may be ornamented with flowers, leaves, &c., by the small tin shapes used to cut paste. PUDDINGS. Observations on Puddings and PancaJies. The outside of a boiled pudding has sometimes a dis- agreeable taste, which arises from the cloth it is boiled in not being nicely washed and kept in* a dry place. It209 rUDDINGS. must be dipped in boiling water, squeezed dry, and floured before used. If the pudding be of bread, the cloth should be tied so as to allow for swelling; if of flour, tight. Basins or forms are much better than cloths for boiling puddings. The water should boil quick when the pudding is put in; and it should be moved about for a minute or two, that the ingredients may not separate. Very good puddings may be made without eggs; but they should have very little liquid in them, and must boil longer than puddings with eggs. Two or three spoonsful of fresh table-beer, or one of yest, will serve instead of eggs, as also will snow. Two large spoonsful of snow will supply the place of one egg, and make a pudding equally good. This is a useful piece of informa- tion, as snow generally falls in the season when eggs are dear. The sooner it is used after it falls the better; but it may be taken up from a clean spot, and kept in a cool place some hours, without losing its good qualities. Bottled malt liquors are also a good substitute for eggs: the sooner used after the cork is drawm the better. The yolks and wdiites, beaten long and separately, make the article they are put into much lighter. Eggs must be ahvays strained after beating. To avoid repetition, let be observed, that when pud- ding-sauce is ordered, wine, sugar, and very thick melted butter, boiled up together, is the sauce intended. All dishes in which puddings are baked must be lined an inch or two below the edge, as well as on it; and that part of the dish must be first rubbed with butter. If a pudding is to be turned out, the whole dish must be but- tered, and lined with paste. Tlie ingredients of puddings should not be put into the basin or dish till the minute they go into the water or oven. Great care is necessary to prevent rich crusts from becoming brown, which makes them rank. A piece of paper put over them will preserve the colour. Sago, and all sorts of seeds, should lie in water an p210 DOMESTIC COOKERY. hour before they are made into puddings, and be well washed ; the want of this caution causes an earthy taste. If the butter be strong that is used in puddings, they will not taste well, whatever good things be added. A small pinch of salt improves the flavour of all mix- tures, even when the other ingredients are sweet. Well-made raisin wine will serve, in most cases, when wine is ordered for puddings. As the goodness of boiled puddings greatly depends upon keeping the water from the ingredients, the cook should take care to have moulds and basins in readiness that will exactly hold the quantity directed. Puddings of bread or flour are much better if all the ingredients be mixed (except the eggs) three hours before boiling or baking ; and they should be well stirred just before they are put into the oven or saucepan. When butter is ordered to be put warm into puddings, the addition of a little milk or wine will prevent its oiling. Half an hour should be allowed for boiling a bread pudding in a half-pint basin, and so on in proportion. A mealy potato, grated wdiile hot, and beaten well with a spoonful of milk, will add greatly to the lightness of plum puddings, whether boiled or baked. Almond Pudding. Beat half a pound of sweet and a few bitter almonds with a spoonful of water 3 then mix four ounces of but- ter, four eggs, two spoonsful of cream, warm with the butter, one of brandy, a little nutmeg, and sugar to taste. Butter some cups, half fill, and bake the puddings. Serve with pudding-sauce. Another. Beat fine four ounces of almonds, four or five bitter ditto, with a little wine, yolks of six eggs, peel of two lemons grated, six ounces of melted butter, near a quart of cream, and juice of one lemon. Wlien well mixed, bake it half an hour, with paste round the dish.211 PUDDINGS. Small Almond Puddings.

Serve with pud- ding-sauce. Lemonade Pudding, to be eaten cold. With two ounces of white sugar, and the juice of two Seville oranges and two lemons, make a pint of lemonade with cold water. Pour it upon a French roll rasped: when it has soaked up all the liquor, stick it over with half an ounce of blanched almonds. Beat half a pound of currant jelly to a liquid, and pour over the whole. Sago Pudding.

Put it into a basin that will just hold it: tie a floured cloth tight over, and put it into a pot of Avater that is boiling very fast. Boil it four hours. Bread and Butter Pudding. Slice bread spread with butter, and lay it in a dish with currants between each layer; and sliced citron, orange or lemon, if to be very nice. Pour over an unboiled custard of milk, two or three eggs, a few pimentos, and a very little ratafia, two hours at least before it is to be baked; and lade it over to soak the bread.DOMESTIC COOKERY. 212 A paste round the edges makes all puddings look bet- ter, but is not necessary.

Half an hour will bake it. Another. Rather more than two table-spoonsful of the orange paste, mixed with six eggs, four ounces of sugar, and four ounces of butter, melted, will make a good-sized pudding, with a paste at the bottom of the dish. Bake twenty minutes. An e.xceedingly nice boiled Orange Pudding. On half a pound of crumbs of bread pour a pint of milk ; let it boil up : stir in two ounces of butter and one of marrow, keeping the pan over the fire until all is incorporated.

Tie it up in a floured cloth, and boil it forty-five minutes. Serve with sweet sauce. Baked Rice Pudding. Swell rice as above ; then add some more milk, an egir, sugar, allspice, and lemon-peel. Bake in a deep dish."^ Another for the family. Put into a very deep pan half a pound of rice washed and picked; two ounces of butter, four ounces of sugar, a few' allspice pounded, and tw'o quarts of milk. Less butter will do, or some suet. Bake in a slow oven. A Porcupi/ie Pudding. Boil half a pint of rice in new milk until perfectly tender, and not too dry; tlien add six eggs beaten, a spoonful of ratafia, as much sugar as shall he sufficient, and some grated fresh lemon ; mix well, and boil in a mould one hour and a half. Turn it on a hot dish, and stick it thick with almonds slit in six. Serve wdth a rich custard round. It is crpially good cold.222 DOMESTIC COOKERY. A George Pudding. Boil very tender a handful of whole rich in a small quantity of milk, with a large piece of lemon-peel. Let it drain; then mix with it a dozen of good-sized apples, boiled to a pulp as dry as possible ; add a glass of white- wine, the yolks of five eggs, two ounces of orange and citron cut thin ; make it pretty sweet. Line a mould or basin with a very good paste; heat the five whites of the fggs to a very strong froth, and mix with the other ingre- dients; fill the mould, and bake it of a fine brown colour. Serve it with the bottom upwards, with the following sauce: two glasses of wine, a spoonful of sugar, the yolks of two eggs, and a bit of butter as large as a wal- nut ; simmer without boiling, and jrour to and from the saucepan, till of a proper thickness; and put in the dish. An excellent plain Potato Pudding. Take eight ounces of boiled potatoes, two ounces of butter, the yolks and whites of two eggs, a quarter of a pint of cream, one spoonful of white wine, a morsel of salt, the juice and rind of a lemon ; beat all to froth; sugar to taste. A crust or not, as you like. Bake it. If wanted richer, put three ounces more butter, sweet- meats and almonds, and another egg. Potato Pudding with Meat. Boil potatoes all fit to mash; rub through a colander, and make into a thick batter with milk and two eggs. Lay some seasoned steaks in a dish, then some batter ; and over the last layer pour the remainder of the batter. Bake a fine brown. An exceedinghj good Potato Suet-Pudding. To a pound of mashed potatoes, while hot, add four ounces of suet and two ounces of Hour, a little salt, and as much milk as will give it the consistence of common suet-pudding. Put it into a dish, or roll it into dump- lings, and bake of a fine brown.223 PUDDINGS. , SteaJi or Kidney Pudding. If kidney, split and soak it, and season that or the meat. Make a paste, of suet, flour, and milk; roll, and line a basin with it: put the kidney or steaks in, cover with paste, and pinch round the edge. Cover with a cloth, and boil a considerable time. Beefsteak Pudding. Prepare some fine steaks as in page 46 ; roll them with fat between ; and if you approve, add a little^‘ shredded onion. Lay a paste of suet in a basin, and put in the rolls of steaks; cover the basin with a paste, and pinch the edges to keep the gravy in. Cover with a cloth tied close ; and let the pudding boil slowly, but for a length of time. Baked Beefsteak Pudding. Make a batter of milk, two eggs, and flour, or, which is much better, potatoes boiled and mashed through a colander; lay a little of it at the bottom of the dish : then put in the steaks prepared as above, and very well seasoned: pour the remainder of the batter over them, and bake it. Midton Pudding. Season with salt, pepper, and a bit of onion ; put one layer of steaks at the bottom of the dish, and pour a batter of potatoes, boiled and pressed through a colan- der, and mi.xed with milk and an egg, over them; then putting the rest of the steaks and batter, bake it. Batter with flour, instead of potatoes, eats well, but requires more egg, and is not so good. Another. Cut slices off a leg that has been underdone, and put them into a basin lined with a fine suet crust. Season with pepper, salt, and finely-shred onion or shalot. Marrow Pudding. Pour a quart of boiling cream upon the grated crumb of a penny-loaf; cover it over till cool; then mix withDOMESTIC COOKERY. 224 it eight ounces of blanched almonds, beaten fine with two spoonsful of rose-water, the yolks of six eggs, six ounces of shred candied lemon and citron, a pound of beef-marrow, half a pound of currants, the grated rind of half a lemon, two large spoonsful of brandy, and the same of sweet wine. Put a paste round the dish, and bake it thirty-five minutes. Sift sugar over when served. While heating the eggs put in a pinch of salt. Suet Pudding. Shred a pound of suet; mix with a pound and a quar- ter of flour, two eggs beaten separately, a little salt, and as little milk as will make it. Boil four hours. It eats well next day, cut in slices and broiled. The outward fat of loins or necks of mutton, finely shred, makes a more delicate pudding than suet; and both are far better for the purpose than butter, which causes the pudding to he black and close. Baked Suet Pudding. Boil a pint of milk : when become cold, stir it into eight ounces of flour, and six of shred suet; add two eggs, and a tea-spoonful of salt. If to be plum pudding, put in eight or ten ounces of stoned raisins, and omit the salt. Veal-Suet Pudding. Cut the crumb of a threepenny loaf into slices; boil and sweeten two quarts of new milk, and pour over it. When soaked, pour out a little of the milk; and mix with six eggs well beaten, and half a nutmeg. Lay the slices of bread into a dish; with layers of currants and veal-suet shred, a pound of each. Butter the dish well, and bake; or you may boil it in a basin if you prefer it. HimteVs Pudding. Mix a pound of suet, ditto flour, ditto cuiTants, ditto raisins, stoned and a little cut, the rind of half a lemon shred as fine as possible, six Jamaica peppers, in fine powder, four eggs, a glass of brandy, a little salt, and as little milk as will make it of a proper consistence; boil225 PUDDINGS. it in a floured cloth, or a melon-mould, eight or nine hours. Serve with sweet sauce. Add sometimes a spoonful of peach-water for change of flavour. This pudding will keep, after it is boiled, six months, if kept tied up in the same cloth, and hung up, folded in a sheet of cap-paper to preserve it from dust, being first cold. When to be used, it must boil a full hour. Plum Pudding. The same proportions of flour and suet, and half the quantity of fruit, with spice, lemon, a glass of wine, or not, and one egg, and milk, will make an excellent pud- ding, if long boiled. Another. Lay a pound of beef suet in lumps, the size of nut- megs, in a basin, half a pound of jar-raisins, a large spoonful of fine sugar, three eggs, a spoonful and a half of flour, and a glass of brandy. Tie a wet cloth, doubled and well floured, over the basin. Put it into a pot of water that boils very fast, and move it about for some minutes. Boil five or six hours. Another, very light. iMix grated bread, suet, and stoned raisins, four ounces each, with two well-beaten eggs, three or four spoonsful of milk, and a little salt. Boil four hours. A spoonful of brandy, sugar, and nutmeg, in melted but- ter, may be served as sauce. National Plum Pudding. Mix suet, jar-raisins, and currants, one pound each, four ounces of crumbs of bread, two table-spoonsful of sugar, one ditto of grated lemon-peel, half a nutmeg, a small blade of mace, a tea-spoonful of ginger, and six well-beaten eggs. Boil it five hours. Prune Pudding. Take a few spoonsful from a quart of milk, and mix into it by degrees four spoonsful of flour, two spoonsful of sifted ginger, a little salt, six yolks and three whites Q226 DOMESTIC COOKERY. of eggs; then add the remainder of the milk, and a pound of prunes or damsons. Tic it up in a cloth, •wetted and well floured, or put it in a basin that will exactly hold it. Boil it an hour; and pour over it melted butter and sugar. Custard Pudding. Mix by degrees a pint of good milk with a large spoonful of flour, the yolks of five eggs, some orange- flower water, and a little pounded cinnamon. Butter a basin that will exactly hold it, pour the batter in, and tie a flour-cloth over. Put in boiling water over the fire, and turn it about a few minutes to prevent the egg going to one side. Half an hour will boil it. Put currant-jelly on it, and serve with sweet sauce. Sponge Pudding. Butter a mould thickly, stick it all over with dried cherries, or the finest raisins. Fill the mould with small sponge cakes, three parts; soak them through with wine ; fill up the mould with a rich cold custard. Butter a paper, and put on the mould; then tie a floured cloth over it quite close, and boil it an hour. Turn out the pudding carefully, and pour some cold custard over it, and into the dish. Macaroni Pudding. Simmer an ounce or two of the pipe sort, in a pint of milk, and a hit of lemon and cinnamon, till tender; put it into a dish, with milk, two or three eggs, but only one white, sugar, nutmeg, a spoonful of peach-water, and half a glass of raisin wine. Bake with a paste round the edges. A layer of orange-marmalade, or raspbeiTy-jam in a macaroni pudding, for change, is a great improvement; in which case omit the almond-water, or ratafia, which you would otherwise flavour it with. Boiled Vermicelli Pudding. Stir very gently four ounces of vermicelli into a pint of new milk over the stove, until it be scalding hot, but227 PUDDINGS. not more; then pour it into a basin, and add to it one ounce of butter and two of sugar, while hot. When the above is nearly cold, mix in it, very gently, two w'ell- heaten eggs, aud immediately put it into a basin that will exactly hold it. Cover carefully with a floured cloth; and turning the basin the narrow end upwards, stir it round for ten minutes, and boil an hour. Serve the moment it is done, with pudding-sauce. Baked Vermicelli Pudding. Simmer four ounces of vermicelli in a pint of new milk ten minutes ; then put to it half a pint of cream, a tea-spoonful of pounded cinnamon, four ounces of butter warmed, the same of white sugar, and the yolks of four eggs, well beaten. Bake in a dish without a lining. Millet Pudding. Wash three spoonsful of the seed; put into the dish, with a crust round the edges ; pour over it as much new milk as will nearly fill the dish, two ounces of bntter Avarmed with it, sugar, shred lemon, and a little scrape of ginger and nutmeg. As you put it into the oven, stir in two eggs beaten, and a spoonful of shred suet. Carrot Pudding. Boil a large carrot tender; then bruise it in a marble mortar, and mix with it a spoonful of biscuit powder, or three or four little sweet biscuits without seeds, four yolks and two whites of eggs, a pint of cream either raw or scalded, a little ratafia, a large spoonful of orange or rose water, a quarter of a nutmeg, and two ounces of sugar. Bake it in a shallow dish lined with paste; and turn it out to serve, with a little sugar dusted over. Chestnut Pudding. Boil eighteen chestnuts in ivater for a quarter of an hour; blanch, peel, and pound them in a mortar, with some sweet wine and orange-flower Avater, till they become a thin paste. Mix the yolks of tweh'e and whites of six eggs Avell beaten, with three pints of cream, and half a pound of butter warmed in it; sweeten Q 2228 DOMESTIC COOKERY. to 5'our taste; and add some grated nutmeg, and a little salt. Put to this the chestnut paste, and stir over the fire till it is thick. Line a dish with puff paste, and pour the mixture into it, and bake it. If cream cannot be obtained, thieken three pints of new milk with the beaten yolks of two or three eggs, and a tea-spoonful of rice-flour. Quince Pudding. Scald some quinces till they are very tender; pare them, and scrape off all the pulp. Strew over them ginger, cinnamon, and as much sugar as will make them very sweet. To a pint of cream put the yolks of three or four eggs, and stir into it as much of the pulp as will make it of a proper thickness. Line a dish, and bake. White pears, plumbs, apricots, or other fruit, may be done in the same way. An excellent Apricot Pudding. Halve twelve large apricots, give them a scald till they are soft; meantime pour on the grated crumbs of a penny-loaf a pint of boiling cream; when half cold, four ounces of sugar, the yolks of four beaten eggs, and a glass of white wine. Pound the apricots in a mortar, with some or all of the kernels; mix then the frnit and other ingredients together; put a paste round a dish, and bake the pudding half an hour. Baked Gooseberry Pudding. Stew gooseberries in ajar over a hot hearth, or in a saucepan of water, till they will pulp. Take a pint of the juice pressed through a coarse sieve, and beat it with three yolks and whites of eggs beaten and strained, one ounce and a half of butter; sweeten it well, and put a crust round the dish. A few crumbs of roll should be mixed with the above to give a little consistence, or four ounces of Naples biscuit. Raspberries or currants may be used instead of goose- berries, and are equally good.I PUDDINGS. 229 A Green-hean Pudding. Boil and blanch old beans, beat them in a mortar, with very little pepper and salt, some cream, and the yolk of an egg. A little spinach-juice will give a finer colour, but it is as good without. Boil it in a basin that will just hold it, an hour: and pour parsley and butter over. Serve bacon to eat with it. A Tansy Pudding. Beat seven eggs, yolks and whites separately : add a pint of cream, near the same of spinach-juice, and a little tansy-juice gained by pounding in a stone mortar, a quarter of a pound of Naples biscuit, sugar to taste, a glass of white wine and some nutmeg. Set all in a saucepan, just to thicken, over the fire; then put it into a dish lined with paste, to turn out, and bake it. Coioslip Pudding. Cut and pound small the flowers of a peck of cows- lips, with eight ounces of grated Naples biscuit, and three pints of cream. Boil them; and when a little cooled, mix in sixteen eggs, with a little rose-water, and half a cup of milk, previously beaten with them. Sweeten, and bake in a lined or buttered dish. When baked, throw fine sugar over it, and serve hot. Shelford Pudding. Mix three quarters of a pound of currants or raisins, one pound of suet, one pound of flour, six eggs, a little good milk, some lernon-peel, a little salt. Boil it in a melon-shape six hours. Brandy Pudding. Line a mould with jar-raisins stoned, or dried cherries, then with thin slices of Frencli roll, next to which put ratafias, or macaroons ; then the fruit, rolls, and cakes, in succession, until the mould be full; sprinkling in at times two glasses of brandy. Beat four eggs, yolks and whites; put to a pint of milk or cream, lightly230 DOMESTIC COOKERY. sweetened, half a nutmeg, and the rind of half a lemon, finely grated. Let the liquid sink into the solid part; then flour a cloth, tie it tight over, and boil one hour ; keep the mould the right side up. Ser\-e with pudding- sauce. Buttermilk Pudding. Warm three quarts of new milk; turn it with a quart of buttermilk; drain the curd through a sieve; when dry, pound it in a marble mortar, with near half a pound of sugar, a lemon boiled tender, the crumb of a roll grated, a nutmeg grated, six bitter almonds, four ounces of warm butter, a tea-cupful of good cream, the yolks of five and whites of three eggs, a glass of sweet wine, and ditto of brandy. When well incorporated, bake in small cups or bowls well buttered; if the bottom be not broum, use a sala- mander ; but serve as quick as possible, and with pud- ding-sauce. Arroio-root Pudding. Mix a dessert-spoonful of the powder in two of cold milk; pour upon it a pint of boiling milk, in which have been dissolved four ounces of butter and two of sugar, stirring all the time. Add a little nutmeg and five eggs. Bake half an hour in a dish lined with paste. Turn it out. Preserved fruits of any kind, laid at the bottom, eat well. If to look clear, substitute water for milk. Curd Puddings. Turn two quarts of milk to curd, press the whey from it, rub through a sieve, and mix four ounces of butter, the crumb of a penny-loaf, two spoonsful of cream, half a nutmeg, a small quantity of sugar, and two spoonsful of white wine. Butter little cups, or small .pattypans, and fill them three parts. Orange-flower water is an improvement. Bake them with care. Serve with sweet sauce in a boat.231 I'UDDINGS. Boiled Curd Pudding. Rub the curd of two gallons of milk well drained through a sieve. l\Iix it with six eggs, a little cream, two spoonsful of orange-flower water, half a nutmeg, flour and crumbs of bread each three spoonsful, currants and raisins half a pound of each. Boil an hour in a thick well-floured cloth. A Dutch Curd Pudding. Beat half a pound of curd, and half a pound of butter to a cream; whip into it seven well-beaten eggs, half a pound of sugar, and the same of currants washed and picked, half a lemon grated, and half a nutmeg. Beat it to the moment of baking. Sift sugar over. Pippin Pudding. Coddle six pippins in vine leaves, covered with water, very gently, that the inside be done without breaking the skins. When soft, skin; with a tea-spoon take the pulp from the core. Press it through a colander; add two spoonsful of orange-flower water, three eggs beaten, a glass of raisin wine, a pint of scalded cream, sugar and nutmeg to taste. Lay a thin puff-paste at the bottom and sides of the dish; shred very thin lemon-peel as fine as possible, and put it into the dish; likewise lemon, orange and citron, in small slices, but not so thin as to dissolve in the baking. Yorkshire Pudding. Mix five spoonsful of flour, with a quart of milk, and three eggs well beaten. Butter the pan. When brown by baking under the meat, turn the other side upwards, and brown that. It should be made in a square pan, and cut into pieces to come to table. Set it over a chafing-dish at first, and stir it some minutes. A quick-made Pudding. Flour and suet half a pound each, four eggs, a quarter of a pint of new milk, a little mace and nutmeg, a quarter of a pound of raisins, ditto of currants; mix232 DOMESTIC COOKERT. M'dl, ami boil three-quarters of an hour with the cover of the pot on, or it will require longer. A Charlotte. Cut as many very thin slices of white bread as will cover the bottom and line the sides of a baking dish, but ■first rub it thick with butter. Put apples in thin slices into the dish, in layers, till full, strewing sugar between and bits of butter. In the mean time, soak as many thin slices of bread as will cover the whole, in warm milk, over which lay a plate, and a weight to keep the bread close on the apples. Bake slowly three hours. To a middling-sized dish use half a pound of butter in the whole. Russian Seed, or Ground Rice Pudding. Boil a large spoonful heaped, of either, in a pint of new milk, with lemon-peel and cinnamon. When cohl, add sugar, nutmeg, and two eggs well beaten. Bake with a crust round the dish. Cream Pudding. Boil a quart of cream, Avith a blade of mace, three cloves, and half a nutmeg grated; and let it stand to cool. Beat eight eggs, but only three whites; strain, and mix them with a spoonful of the finest flour, a quarter of a pound of almonds blanched, and beaten fine Avith a s])oonful of orange-floAver or rose Avater. Mix these by degrees in the cream, and stir all Avell together. Take a thick cloth, wet and flour it Avell; pour in the mixture, tie it close, and plunge it into boiling Avater. Keep it boiling, half an hour, very fast. When done, turn it carefully on a dish, strew fine sugar upon it, and serve pudding sauce round. A Welsh Pudding. Let half a pound of fine butter melt gently, beat with it the yolks of eight and Avhites of four eggs, mix in si.x ounces of loaf sugar, and the rind of a lemon grated.

Pick two handsful of parsley-leaves from the stems, half the quantity of spinach, two hearts of lettuces, a large handful of mustard and cress, a few leaves o-f white beet, and a small handful of chives : wash, and boil all together three minutes; drain the water from them, and mash very fine ; mix well, and add salt and pepper. Have ready a batter, made of an ounce of flour, a pint of thin cream, and two eggs ; stir it into the herbs, and cover the dish with a good crust. This pudding has much the flavour of omelet. A very pretty dish of Eggs. Break some eggs into a small tart-dish, without in- juring the yolks, or laying one over the other. Drop on them some warm butter, and lightly strew crumbs of bread. Put it in the oven until the whites be set; and serve with a wreath of parsley round the edge. DUMPLINGS. Oxford Dumplings. Of grated bread two ounces, currants and shred suet four ounces each, two large spoonsful of flour, a great deal of grated lemon-peel, a bit of sugar, and a little pimento in fine powder. Mix with two eggs and a little milk, into five dumplings, and fry of a fine yellow brown. Made ^ ith flour instead of bread, but half the quantity, they are excellent. Serve with sweet sauce. Suet Dumplings. iMake as pudding (page 208) ; and drop into boiling water, or into the boiling of beef: or you may boil them in a cloth. Apple, Currant, or Damson Dumplings, or Puddings. Make as above, and line a basin with the paste to- lerably thin: fill with the fruit, and‘cover it; tie a cloth over tight, and hoil,till»the fruit shall be done enough.DOMESTIC cookery. 234 Yest or Suffolk Dumplmgs. Make a very light dough with yest, as for bread, hut with milk instead of water, and put salt. Let it rise an hour before the fire. Tw'enty minutes before you are to serve, have ready a large stewpan of boiling water; make the dough into balls, the size of a middling apple ; throw them in, and boil twenty minutes. If you doubt when done enough, stick a clean fork into one, and if it come out clear, it is done. The way to eat them is, to tear them apart on the top with tw'o forks, for they become heavy by their own steam. Eat immediately with meat, or sugar and butter, or salt. Norfolk Dumplings. With a pint of milk, two well-beaten eggs, and a little salt, mix as much flour as will make a thick batter. Drop a spoonful at a time into a stewpan of boiling water. Three minutes will do them. Take them up in a sieve to drain; and serve quickly with cold butter. The water must not cease boiling while they are doing. PANCAKES. Common Pancakes. Make a light batter of eggs, flour, and milk. • Fry in a small pan, in hot dripping or lard. Salt, or nutmeg and ginger, may be added. Sugar and lemon should be served to eat with them. Or, wdien eggs are scarce, make the batter with flour, and small beer, ginger, &c. ; or clean snow, with flour, and a very little milk, will serve as well as eggs. Fine Pancakes, fried ivithout Butter or Lard. Beat six fresh eggs extremely well: mix, when strained, with a ])int of cream, four ounces of sugar, a glass of wine, half a nutmeg grated, the grated rind of a whole lemon, and as much flour as will make it almostFRITTERS. 235 as thick as ordinary pancake-butter, but not quite. Heat the frying-pan tolerably hot, wipe it with a clean 1 cloth; then pour in the batter, to make thin pancakes. Pancakes of Rice. Boil half a pound of rice to a jelly, in a small quan- tity of water ; when cold, mix it with a pint of cream, eight eggs, a bit of salt, and nutmeg ; stir in eight ounces of butter just warmed, and add as much flour as will make the batter thick enough. Fry in as little lard or dripping as possible. Irish Pancakes. Beat eight yolks and four whites of eggs, strain them into a pint of cream, put a grated nutmeg, and sugar to your taste: set three ounces of fresh butter on the fire, stir it, and as it warms pour it to the cream, which should be warm when the eggs are put to it: then mix smooth almost half a pound of flour. Fry the pancakes very thin; the first with a bit of butter, but not the others. Serve several on one another. New-England Pancakes. Mix a pint of cream, five spoonsful of fine flour, seven yolks and four whites of eggs, and a very little salt; fry them very thin in fresh butter, and between each strew sugar and cinnamon. Send up six or eight at once. Cream Pancakes. Mix the yolks of two well beaten eggs with a pint of cream, two ounces of sifted sugar, a little nutmeg, cin- namon, and mace. Rub the pan with a bit of butter; and fry the pancakes thin. FRITTERS. Make them of any of the batters directed for pan- cakes, by dropping a small quantity into the pan; or make the plainer sort, and put paired apples, sliced and cored, into the batter, and fry some of it with each slice. Currants, or sliced lemon, as thin as paper, make anDOMESTIC COOKERY. 236 agreeable change. — Fritters for company should be served on a folded napkin in the dish. Any sort of sweetmeat^ or ripe fruit, may be made into fritters. Oyster Fritters. See page 29. Spanish Fritters. Cut the crumb of a French roll into lengths, as thick as your finger, in what shape you will. Soak in some cream, nutmeg, sugar, pounded cinnamon, and an egg. When well soaked, fry of a nice brown ; and serve with butter, wine, and sugar-sauce. Potato Fritters. Boil two large potatoes, scrape them fine; beat four yolks and three whites of eggs, and add to the above one large spoonful of cream, another of sweet wine, a squeeze of lemon and a little nutmeg. Beat this batter half an hour at least. It will be extremely light. Put a good quantity of fine lard in a stewpan, and drop a spoonful of the batter at a time into it. Fry them; and serve as a sauce, a glass of white wine, the juice of a lemon, one dessert-spoonful of peach-leaf or almond water, and some white sugar, warmed together; not to be served in the dish. Another icay. Slice potatoes thin, clip them in a fine batter and fry. Serve with white sugar sifted over them. Lemon-peel, and a spoonful of orange-flower water, should be added to the batter. Buck-ioheat Fritters, called Backings. Mix three ounces of buck-wheat flour, with a teai cupful of warm milk, and a spoonful of yest; let it rise before the fire about an hour; then mix four eggs, well beaten, and as much milk as will make the batter the usual thickness for pancakes, and fry them the same.FRENCH COOKERY. 231 Pink-coloured Fritters. Boil a large beet-root until it is tender; beat it fine in a marble mortar. Add the yolks of four eggs, two spoonsful of flour, and three of cream, the juice and peel of half a lemon, half a nutmeg, and a glass of brandy. Mix all well together, and fry the fritters in butter. Garnish them with green sweetmeats, preserved apricots, or sprigs of myrtle. Plain Fritters. Grate the crumb of a penny loaf; put it into a pint of milk over the fire, and beat it very smooth : when cold, add the yolks of five eggs, three ounces of sifted sugar, and half a nutmeg.

Drop the batter into a frying-pan, with a little butter or fine lard. PART VII. FRENCH COOKERY. FISH. Une Granade. Scrape gently the flesh of a large whiting from the skin and bones; beat it in a mortar fifteen minutes: having scraped two ounces of the finest fat bacon, beat them together another fifteen minutes; then add a table- spoonful of chopped parsley, two ounces of butter, a small bit of garlic chopped to a mash, a blade of mace in powder, and the beaten yolks of two eggs, and pound a full half hour more: when to be used, mix well therein the freshDOMESTIC COOKERY. 23S s lieaten whites of two eggs, reserving a teaspoonfnl to he used as hereafter directed. Meantime take the hones and fins from four or five little red-mullet, without in- juring the skin, and cut them lengthways, an inch wide; do the same by a good-sized sole, having split, but not removed any of the skin. Then stew a small veal sweet- bread, a fresh artichoke bottom, eight oysters without the heard, and two truffles cut in bits, a quarter of an hour, in a little butter, and let it become cold. When all the above are in readiness, line a casserole of five or six inches in diameter, with long slices of fat bacon, placed quite close, in the centre of which lay four bits of carrot cut diamond shape, lengthways; cover the bacon with the strips of fish perfectly united, alternately putting the brown and white of the sole, and the red of the mullet next to the bacon, and on these half the force- meat : then put in the sweetbread, &c., which cover with the remainder of the forcemeat, smoothing it over wfith the back of a spoon wetted with the white of the egg before directed to be preserved. Lay on it a buttered paper, put the cover of the pan on, and bake twenty minutes. When done turn the granade on the lid to drain, carefully remove the bacon without breaking the skin of the fish, and serve very hot, with rich veal gravy round, not over it. The entrails of the mullet will give addi- tional flavour to the forcemeat. Where they cannot be had, the red part of lobsters used alternately with the brown and white of the sole, or mackerel, will look beautiful. A similar dish may be made by substituting the flesh of hare, the white part of partridge, and ham for the fish; the little ragout of sweetbread, &c., as before; and a forcemeat made of cold game, the liver of young fowls, the fat and lean of fine ham, eggs, butter, herbs, and spice as in the above.

Make the forcemeat of any dressed fish, crumbs of bread, the hard yolk of an egg, half a spoonful of boiled celery-root, half an anchovy, a spoonful of parsley, and half as much chervil, both finely minced, a little fat bacon or butter, and a raw egg, pepper and salt. When dressed, keep the fish hot, while the gravy it was baked in is warmed with a spoonful of caper vinegar, ?ind the same of the gherkin liquor, to serve round it, with a few sliced gherkins. Broiled Mackerel. Split them up the back, clean them very nicely, lay them whole on the gridiron, having rubbed them inside and out, with butter, warmed in a bit of muslin. When ready, put into each fish an ounce of butter rubbed in chopped chervil; when the butter is melted, dish them, spread open, very hot. Anguille Rotie.—Roasted Eel. Skin a large silver eel; lay on the inner side a force- meat of two ounces of crumbs of bread, one ounce of fat bacon, two large spoonsful of chopped parsley, four dried leaves of sage, pepper, salt, and pounded mace, and the yolk of aii egg. Roll the eel, beginning at the tail, taking- care that the seasoning come not too near the edges; fasten the roll tight with twine and small silver skewers (with which it may be served.) Over all lay the skin, having buttered it, and put it to the fire on a lark-spit: when nearly dressed, remove the skin, wet the fish all over with yolk of egg, and sift over it some fine raspings of bread. Serve the following sauce round itchop as small as possible two large spoonsful of capers, and two imwashed anchovies; ]>ut them in a saucepan with five ounces of blitter, two spoonsfid of water, boding hot, and240 DOMESTIC COOKERY. oDe of cape’r vinegar; shake the pan over the fire until all be completely mixed. Trout in White Sauce. Boil the fish gently in as much water and light white wine, in equal quantities, as will only cover them. Keep tiiem hot, when done, while you boil the liquor with a bit * of butter, and a little flour. Meantime have ready beaten two eggs, with a spoonful of cold water, and pour them and the sauce to and fro at a little distance above the stove, till they are of due thickness; and serve the fish in it, adding a little salt. Trout in Green Sauce. Beat in a mortar half an anchovy, a table-spoonfiil of capers, one each of chives and parsley, previously minced, a good lump of butter, and a dessert-spoonful of flour.

Then roll the meat round the bone, the end of which leave out at one ex- tremity, put over a thin slice of fat bacon, and having stuffed in the remainder of the forcemeat at the ends of the roll, bind up with twine. At the bottom of a small stewpan lay slices of turnip, onion, three inches of celery, and two large carrots cut lengthways, and the steaks over; add as much water, or beef broth, as shall half cover them; set the pan on a moderate stove, and some wood embers on the lid ; simmer slowly tw^o hours, then remove the twine, and placing the bones upw'ards, leaning on each other, strain the gravy over them. Queues de Veau.—Calves' Tails. Having nicely cleaned and soaked four calves’ tails, cut off the small ends, and blanch them. Dri^, flour, and fry them a fine brown in butter, drain the fat from them, and having ready a pint of weak broth, with a bunch of sweet herbs, chibols, tw'o bay-leaves, lialf a pint of mushrooms, pepper, and salt, boiled up and skimmed, wipe the sides of the casserole, put the tails in, and simmer very slowly until they are quite tender.

Have ready small onions, and peel to one size to send up in the dish. liis de Veau.—Sweetbreads. Skin and blanch three sweetbreads; boil till ready for eating ; dry, and browm with a salamander. Put over a little glaze, and serve with real gravy and glazed onions, or stewed mushrooms, round. Ris de Veau en Guises.—Sweetbreads in cases. Blanch three sweetbreads, and simmer in a strong well-flavoured gravy, till quite done. Have ready three243 FRENCH COOKERY. round pieces of white paper oiled, and lay them thereon; having left them lightly wetted with gi'avy, sprinkle over them the finest crumbs or raspings of bread, pepper, salt, and a very little nutmeg. Do them slowly on a grid- iron, and serve in the cases. Any of the vegetable sauces may be served to eat with them. Piecls de Veau en fricassee.—Calf’s Feet fricasseed. Soak two fine calf’s feet in cold water six hours ; then simmer in a sufficiency of milk and water to cover them completely, until the meat can be easily removed from the bones in nice pieces ; sprinkle with cmmbs of bread, pepper, and salt, having previously dipped them in yolk of egg: fry of a beautiful colour, and serve in fricassee- sauce.

Having prepared and blanched sweetbreads of veal, or lamb (if house-lamb better,) liver of lamb, and rabbits, truffles and mushrooms, simmer gently half au hour in rich veal broth ; then divide the several articles into fit bits for helping, and stew the whole till very tender. If, when finished, the gravy wants consistence, boil up in it a good piece of butter rubbed in flour; season it fifteen minutes before serving, with white pepper, salt, and nutmeg only. Have ready and hot fine force- meat balls, in which finely scraped ham, beef-suet, the breast of a fowl, or cold veal, are the principal in- gredients. It may be served in a tureen as soup, or in an orna- mented crust previously baked. If to be -white, beat as R 2DOMESTIC COOKERY. 244 many yolks of eggs as the quantity may require, and simmer in the ragout two minutes : it must not boil. Sometimes one or two whole pigeons, nicely prepared, form a part of this much-admired dish, which in one way or other is rarely omitted on well-covered tables. Calves' ears stuffed. The hair being scalded off the ears, after they have been cut quite close to the head, scald and clean them as well as possible; boil them quite tender, and blanch them in cold water. Observe that the gristle next the head be cut so smooth as to allow the ears to stand upright ; they may be boiled in white gravy instead of water, which will make them richer. When become cold, fill up the cavity with a finestufEng, either of calf’s liver, fat bacon, grated ham, bread soaked in cream or gravy, herbs, an unbeaten egg, a little salt, and a small piece of mace; or substitute cold chicken for the liver. Rub egg over the ears and stuffing, and fry of a beautiful light brown. Serve in brown or white gravy. If the calf be large, one foot will be sufficient for a corner dish. Another loaij. When prepared as above, boil them quite tender in gravy, and serve them in chervil sauce j or else boil chervil to a mash, put to it melted butter, pass it through a sieve, and add to it white sauce, or use the latter solely ; in which case put a little mushroom powder into it; the same forcemeat may be used, or the ears may be served without. They likewise eat well (served in white or brown gravy) cut into slices; in the latter case fry them before stewed in gravy. Cou de Mouton d la Sainte Menehould.—j\eck of Mut- ton d la Sainte Menehould. Order the narrow part of a neck of small mutton to be cut off before the sheep be divided, whicii leaves the two scrags united.

In the meantime boil the gravy, uncovered, very quickly, having strained it first, and serve in the dish : add salt. Serve in the dish endive, tomata, or spinach sauce. Hackee de Moulon, aux herbes fines.—Hashed Mutton tvith herbs. Put into a casserole a good piece of butter, some finely- minced shalot, parsley, and half a pint of mushrooms; boil them gently in the butter j then, by degrees, mix in a large spoonful of flour, half a pint of broth, and stew till the flavour of all be obtained : let it become a little cool, then mince some underdone mutton in it, without boiling. Rognons de Mouton.—Mutton Kidneys. With a verv’ sharp knife cut mutton kidneys in the thinnest possible slices ; flour, and fry quickly till they are quite crisp. While frying, add pepper and salt. Serve them in a good gravy, to which a bit of garlic has given a very slight flavour. Cotelettes aux Haricots—Mutton Steaks loith French Beans. ' Having dressed French beans as usual, drain the water from them, and simmer them with pepper and salt in a good piece of butter. A few minutes before serving add the beaten yolk of an egg, and shake the pan over the fire, but they must not boil. In the meantime have ready three mutton steaks, neatly trimmed, seasoned with pepper, salt, and a few crumbs, and nicely boiled or fried ; and serve them on the French beans. Blanquette d'Agneau.— White Fricassee of Lamb. Cut the best part of the brisket of small lamb into square pieces of four inches each; wash, dry, and flour.'246 DOMESTIC COOKEKY.

Take out thg bOne of a small shoulder of lamb; lard the under side with small lardons of bacon dipped in a mixture of cloves, mace, cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper, and salt, each in small proportions. Roll the meat neatly, and bind it with twine. Glaze it after braisins:; and serve it on cucumbers stewed with cream, seasoned as usual, or on mushroom-sauce. Epaule d’Agneau au nature 1.—Shoulder of Lamb dressed plain. Bone a small fat shoulder of lamb, leaving only au inch and a half of the knuckle. IMince a little of the fat with some white pepper and salt, and lay it on the inner side. With a large needle and coarse thread, gather together the circumference of the meat; press it flat, and fasten the little bone as a handle in its proper jflace. Then lay at the bottom of a casserole a large sliced onion, half a lemon, without any of the peel, three small carrots, cut lengthways, and one clove ; on these lay the lamb; and round the lamb put strips of bacon about the size of your finger ; throw in a little parsley,, and cover the meat with veal broth. Set the pan on a very slow fire, and place wood embers on the lid. Sim- mer two hours. Keep the meat hot while the gravy is strained, and add to it a little veloute: boil very quick, and throw it over the lamb. Note.—At the same time another little dish may be prepared with the lamb; uhich will also add to its richness. Cut off the meat from two calf’s feet as far down as where the toes commence, but without removing them.247 FRENCH COOKERY. or breaking the skin ; then roll the meat round the toes, but do not cover them. Tie it tight with strong twine, and simmer it three hours with the above. Remove the string when served. Lay it on tomata sauce. POULTRY, &c. Poulet aux Truffes.—Fowl \oith Truffles. Bone and skin a fine young fowl: take the odd bits of it, four ounces of green truffles, a small carrot, (both in thin slices,) with mace, pepper, and salt, and stuff the inside of it: tie it lightly, and lay it on slices of fat bacon; and lay over it a whole lemon sliced, after cutting off the rind. Put into a casserole a bay-leaf, two cloves, a small carrot, an onion, and as much water as will cover the fowl. Simmer, as slowly as possible, with embers over the pan, two hours, by which time the liquor will be much wasted; strain, and add to it half a pint of very strong gravy, and two ounces of sliced truffles : continue to stew gently three-quarters of an hour, and then serve altogether. To some tastes, mushrooms, substituted for truffles, might be more agreeable, with the addition of a little butter. Salade de Perdreaux.—Partridges in Salad. Bone two partridges, and put into them a few sliced truffles. Put them into a small casserole, with slices of lean ham under and over, some slices of lemon, and a small quantity of veal gravy, with which occasionally wet them. Serve them next day with clear jelly of veal, properly seasoned; and put round them, alternately, hard eggs, split, but left in the whites, lettuces, cut short and in quarters, and nasturtium flowers. Pupton of Pigeons. Lay a forcemeat, made very savoury, in a small dish like a paste lining, then put in layers, very thin slices of fat bacon, squab pigeons, sliced sweetbreads blanched, asparagus-tops, mushrooms, cockscombs, a palate or two boiled quite tender, and cut in slices, and the yolks ofDOMESTIC COOKERY. 248 four eggs boiled hard. Lay more forcemeat over the dish as a pie-crust; hake it, and turn it out to serve, with rich gravy in the dish. SOUPS. Soupe de Gibier.— Game Soup. Put into a soup-pot three pounds of gra\^'-beef sliced, two old partridges, an old pheasant, a knuckle of veal hare of meat, six carrots, four heads of celery, three cloves, a small bunch of fennel, and eight pints of water; let it hoil up; then carefully skim, and simmer it four hours.

Sovpe de Poisson.—Fish Soup. For a party of a dozen, clean and nicely wash twelve pounds of dace, roach, or any common fish; stew them with twelve large carrots, eight lettuces, a handful of leeks, si.x onions, and three handsful of sorrel, in as much water as will cover them, until the whole are done to a mash; strain it through a coarse cloth ; and boil the liquor, closely covered, one hour. Have ready some of the above-mentioned vegetables, cut small; flour, and boil them in butter; and simmer them in the soup half an hour, with pepper, salt, and a few cloves. Soften a rasped French roll in good hroth, and having mixed the yolks of six fresh eggs with a few crumhs, stir them into the soup, and pour the whole over the roll. Another. Clean and scale four or five pounds of any cheap fish, which, w’ith six or eight large carrots, i'our turnips, four leeks, and four onions, simmer in five pints of water, until the whole will strain through fine strong cloth. In the mean time have ready the pulp of old or fresh peas; and add them, and as much of the water that249 FRENCH COOKERY. boiled them, with four ounces of butter, pepper, and salt, as will make the soup of a proper consistence. Stir often ; and boil till readj' to serve. If green peas be in season, boil half a pint in the latter dressing. Pottage de Veaii.— Veal Pottage. Stew a knuckle of veal of four or five pounds in two quarts of water, with five carrots, one onion, and two blades of mace, till the meat be fit for eating. Keep it hot while the soup is boiled up with a large handful of minced chervil, a large spoonful of flour rubbed in two ounces of butter, sliced carrot, or young peas, pepper, and salt. Serve the meat in a dish of buttered rice. Note.—A cup of thick sour cream, put into the tureen first, and well mixed with meat soups, when going to be served, gives a fine flavour. To thicken or enrich white, or fish soups, pour them, boiling hot, on the beaten yolks of two or three fresh eggs. SAUCES, &c. Put into a casserole three ounces of butter, four large carrots, six middling onions, three roots of parsley sliced, a small sprig of thyme, three cloves, three bay-leaves, two pounds of roach, bream, or dace, cut small, with salt, pepper, and half a bottle of white but not sweet wdne, and nearly as much broth. Cover close, and sim- mer until the whole be mashed : strain it through a fine sieve. In another casserole stew a pint of mushrooms, a little parsley, and chibols, in half a pint of water, till the flavour of all be obtained: strain both liquors, and heat them together. Veloute, of which the French make so much use to heighten the tastes of soups and made dishes, may be well substituted by rich beef or veal broth, in which the above vegetables, the remains of a cold fowl, and a little spice, have formed the chief part, without the more expensiveDOMESTIC COOKERY. 250 articles. When cold, skim and strain, and reduce it by a second boiling. Another. Mince extremely small three or four green truffles; beat'them in butter a few minutes; add five spoonsful of veloute, and a soup-ladleful of beef-suet to thin it. Simmer over a temperate heat fifteen minutes, and then remove the fat. Put the sauce into a small vessel, and. keep it closely stopped in a saucepan of hot water, ready to add to the dishes requiring it. Sauce Toniate a V Italienne.— Tomata Sauce, in the Italian manner. ’Slice five or six onions and a dozen of tomatas into a stewpan, which, with a sprig of thyme, two bay-leaves, six pods of pimento, two tea-spoonsful of curry-powder, salt, a cup of rich gravy, simmer very gently until the whole will pulp through a colander: stir well, that the sauce may not burn. Sauce Toniate a la Frangoise.—Tomata Sauce, in the French manner. Simmer the fruit with a little broth, salt, and pepper, until it will pulp as above. If too thin, reduce it by boiling. A minute or two before serving, add a little veloute and a bit of butter, and give it one boil. Sauce aux Epinards.—Spinach Sauce. The stalks being removed, wash and drain the leaves; then, without water, stew till they will beat to a mash. Put in a good piece of butter and some milk; simmerj and stir over a slow fire till the sauce be of the consist^ ence of thick melted butter. Add a little pepper and salt while dressing. Endive Sauce and Sorrel Sauce make in the same way, omitting the pepper and salt; the green ends of the former being cut off. Sauce d’ Oujnon.—Onion Sauce. Boil onions in milk; beat them very fine; then boil251 FRENCH COOKERY. tliem in fine melted butter, using a little of the milk instead of water. Before serving, add a large spoonful of unspiced white-wine vinegar. Sauce de Cornichons.—Cucumber Sauce. Slice thin some middling-sized cucumbers, drain the liquor from them, and put them, with four onions, into a casserole, with a piece of butter; when sufficiently stewed to pulp through a colander, add a large tea- cupful of cream, a little flour and pepper. Boil twenty minutes, and when going to serve, put in salt. VEGETABLES. Pommes de terre (Potatoes) d la Modtre d’Hotel.. Cut boiled potatoes in thick slices, and simmer them in a few spoonsful of plain gravy, a bit of butter rubbed in a little flour, chopped parsley, pepper and salt. A most pleasant preparation of Potatoes. Dress mealy potatoes by steam ; press them through a colander; and with as much new milk as shall make the mixture very thin, salt, pepper, and a piece of butter, boil them a few minutes, stirring the while; which occa- sionally continue to do on a slow fire half an hour. Salade d'Haricots.—Salad of French Beans. Boil French beans as usual: when cold, mix with salad-liquor, but let the egg be unboiled. Artichauts.—Artichokes. Cut off the points of the leaves; boil as usual; remove some of the inner leaves circularly, and fill their place with a little relishing forcemeat, or thick melted butter, salt, and vinegar. Artichauts frits.—Fried Artichokes. Chip off about an inch and a half of the leaves, and with a sharp knife cut each artichoke in slices down- wards about the thickness of three-quarters of an inch: pick out the choke without injuring the bottom. Throw252 DOMESTIC COOKERY. them into a stcwpan half full of boiling-hot lard, and boil them until quite crisj/ and of a fine colour. Lav them on a sieve before the fire for about five minutes, and serve them piled up: they eat deliciously. The same liquor -will serve several times, if not suf- fered to become black. Salad-sauce, -svith chervil, parsley, chives, -nith or ■without anchovy, finely minced, make a most agreeable salad for cold meat, fish, or fowl. Fritters. Mix two eggs well-beaten and strained, with as much new milk and flour as shall make one thick pancake, which fry as pale as you can. Pound it in a mortar quite smooth, and add the yolks of four and whites of two eggs, one large spoonful of orange-flower water, or cin- namon-water, one ounce of blanched almonds, beaten to a paste, two ounces of white sugar, and a quarter of a small nutmeg. Pound it all till it become smooth batter. Have ready a large stewpan, half full of fine lard, quite hot, and drop the batter into it, the size of large nuts, until the surface be filled: as they brown, turn them; they will be very large: when done, remove them on clean paper in a dish before the fire, and do the remain- der. Serve as quickly as possible. They are- excellent. Plum Pudding. Mix six ounces of suet, seven ounces of grated bread, two ounces of sugar, half a pound of French plums, three well-beaten eggs, a small tea-cup of milk, and a dessert- spoonful of ratafia. Let it stand two hours, and boil it the same s]oace of time. Observe to stir it well the last thing.VEGETABLES. 253 PART VIII. VEGETABLES. Observations on dressing Vegetables. Vegetables should be carefully cleaned from insects, and nicely washed. Boil them in plenty of water, and drain them the moment they are done enough. If over- boiled, they lose their beauty and crispness. Bad cooks sometimes dress them with meat; which is wrong, except carrots with boiling beef. To boil Vegetables green. Be sure the water boils when you put them in. Make them boil very fast. Bo not cover, but watch them; and if the water has not slackened, you may be sure they are done when they begin to sink. Then take them out immediately, or the colour will change. Hard water, especially if chalybeate, spoils the colour of such vegeta- bles as should be green. To boil them green in hard water, put a tea-spoonful of salt of wormwood into the water when it boils before the vegetables are put in. 7’o keep green Peas. Shell, and put them into a kettle of water when it boils; give them two or three warms only, and pour them into a colander. When the water drains off, turn them out on a dresser covered with cloth, and pour them on another cloth to dry perfectly. Then bottle them in wide-mouthed bottles, leaving only room to pour clarified mutton-suet upon them an inch thick, and for the cork. Rosin it down; and keep it in a cellar, or in the earth, as will be directed for gooseberries under the head of Keeping for Winter.—When they arc to be used, boil them till tender, with a bit of butter, a spoonful of sugar, and a bit of mint.254 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Another way, as practised in the Emperor of Russia's kitchen. Shell, scald, and dry them as above; put them on tins, or earthen dishes, in a cool oven once or twice, to harden. Keep them in paper hags hung up in the kitchen. When they are to be used, let them lie an hour in water; then set them on with cold water and a bit of butter, and boil them till ready. Put a sprig of dried mint to boil with them. To boil green Peas. Wash after shelling them : boil with a spoonful of sugar in the watfer. -Serve with scalded mint chopped—^put a piece of butter to the peas after they are taken up. To steio green Peas. Put a quart of peas, a lettuce, and an onion, both sliced, a bit of butter, pepper, salt, and no more water than hangs round the lettuce after washing. Stew them tw'o hours very gently. When to be served, beat up an egg and stir it into them; or a bit of flour and butter. Some think a tea-spoouful of white powdered sugar is an improvement. Gravy may be added, but then there will be less of the flavour of the peas. Chop a bit of mint, and stew in them. To stew old Pea^. Steep them in water all night, if not fine boilers; otherwise only half an hour: put them into water enough just to cover them, with a good bit of butter, or a piece of beef or pork. Stew them very gently till the peas are soft, and the meat is tender: if it is not salt meat, add salt and a little pepper. Serve them round the meat. To boil Asparagus. Cut the white stalk off about six inches from the head; throw them into cold water, and after soaking, tie them in small bundles, and boil them rather quick: if overdone the heads will be broken. Toast a slice ofVEGETABLES. 255 bread very brown on both sides ; and when the aspara- gus is done, take it very carefully ujj, dip the toast quickly in the w'ater, and lay the asparagus upon it, leaving the white ends outwards each way; and pour melted butter over the toast and green parts. Asparac/us forced. Cut a piece out of the top of three French rolls; take out all the crumb; do not enlarge the opening, or the crust will not exactly fit again. Fry the rolls brown, in fresh butter: have ready a pint of cream, the yolks of six eggs well heaten, a little salt and nutmeg. Stir this mixture over a slow fire until it thickens. Boil a hundred of small asparagus ; save tops enough to stick the tops of the rolls with, cut the remainder of the green part of the grass small: put it into the cream, and fill the rolls with it hot. Before the rolls are fried, make a few holes in the pieces of crust cut off, and stick the tops in. This is for a side-dish in a second course. To dress Artichokes. Trim a few of the outside leaves off, and cut the stalk even. If young, half an hour will boil them. They are better for being gathered two or three days first. Serve them with melted butter in as many small cups as there are artichokes, to help with each, having clipped off’ the sharp points of the leaves. Artichoke Bottoms. If dried, they must be soaked, then stewed in weak scravy, and served with or without forcemeat in each. Or they may be boiled in milk, and served with cream- sauce; or added to ragouts, French pies, &c. Jerusalem Artichokes Must be taken up the moment they are done, or they will be too soft. They may be boiled plain, or served with white fricas- see-sauce.DOMESTIC COOKERY. 256 To stew Cucumbers. Slice them thick: or halve and divide them into two lengths ; strew some salt and pepper, and sliced onions; add a little broth, or a bit of butter. Simmer very slowly; and before serving, if no butter was in before, put some, and a little flour; or if there was butter in, only a little flour, unless it wants richness. Another loay. Slice the onions and cut the cucumbers large; flour them, and fry them in some butter; then pour on some good broth or gravy, and stew them till done enough. Skim off the fat. To stew Onions. Peel six large onions; fry gently of a fine brown, but do not blacken them ; then put them into a small stew- pan, with a little weak gravy, pepper, and salt; cover and stew two hours gently. They should be lightly floured at first. Roast Onions Should be done with atl the skins on. They eat well alone, with only salt and cold butter; or with roast potatoes, or with beet-root made into salad. To stexo Celery. Wash six heads, and strip off their outer leaves; either halve, or leave them whole, according to their size: cut into lengths of four inches. Put them into a stewpan with a cup of broth, or weak w'hite gravy: stew' till tender; then add two spoonsful of cream, and a little flour and butter, seasoned with pepper, salt, and nutmeg', and simmer all together. Celery is a great improvement to all soups and gravies. To boil Caulijlowers. Choose those that are close and white. Cut off the green leaves, and look carefully that there are no cater- pillars about the stalk. Soak an hour in cold water: then boil them in milk and water; and take care toVEGETABLES. 257 skim the saucepan, that not the least foulness may fall on the flower. It must be served very white, and rather crimp. Cauliflower in lehite Sauce. Half boil it; then cut it into handsome pieces, and lay them in a stewpan with a little broth, a bit of mace, a little salt, and a dust of white pepper; simmer half an hour; then put a little cream, butter, and flour; shake, and simmer a few minutes, and serve. To dress Caulifloioers and Parmesan. Boil a cauliflower; drain it on a sieve, and cut the stalks so that the flower will stand uj)right about two inches above the dish. Put it into a stewpan, with a little white sauce; let it stew till done enough, which will be but a few minutes; then dish it witli the sauce round, and put parmcsan grated over it. Brown it with a salamander. To dress Broccoli. Cut the heads with short stalks, and pare the tough skin off them. Tie tlie small shoots into bunches, and boil them a shorter time than the heads. Some salt must be put into the water. Serve with or without toast. Poached eggs eat well with broccoli. Broccoli and buttered ecjgs. Keep a handsome buneh for the middle, and have eight pieces to go round. Toast a piece of bread to fit the inner part of the dish or plate. Boil the broccoli. In the mean time have ready si,\ (or more) eggs beaten : put, for six, a quarter of a pound of fine butter into a saueepan, with a little salt. Stir it over the fire, and as it becomes warm, add the eggs, and shake the saucepan till the mixture is thick enough. Pour it on the hot toast, and lay the broccoli as above directed. Spinach Requires great care in washing and picking it. When that is done, throw it into a saucepan that will just hold s258- domestic COOKERY. it, sprinkle it with a little salt, and cover close. The pan must be set on the fire, and well shaken. When done, heat the spinach well with a small hit of hutter; it must come to table pretty dry; and looks well if pressed into a tin mould in the form of a large leaf, which is sold at the tin-shops. A spoonful of cream is an improvement. To dress Beans. Boil tender with a bunch of parsley, which must be chopped to serve with them. Bacon or pickled pork must be served to eat with, but not boiled with them. Fricasseed Windsor Beans. When grown large, but not mealy, boil, blanch, and lay them in a white sauce ready hot; just heat them through in it, and serve. If any are not of a fine green, do not use them for this dish. French Beans. String and cut them into four or eight; the last looks best. Lay them in salt and water; and when the sauce- pan boils, put them in with some salt. As soon as they are done, serve them immediately, to preserve the green colour. Or when half-done, drain the water off, and put them into two spoonsful of broth strained; and add a little cream, butter, and flour, to finish doing them. Sleeved Cabbage. When nicely washed, boil a cabbage in milk and water till half-done : then let it become dry. Cut it; and hav- ing seasoned with pepper and salt, put it to stew vith a bit of butter, and a spoonful or two of cream. To steio red Cabbage. Slice a small, or half a large, red cabbage; wash and put it into a saucepan with pepper, salt, no water but what hangs about it, and a piece of butter. Stew till quite tender; and when going to serve, add two or threeVEGETABLES. 259 spoonsful of vinegar, anti give one boil over the fire* Serve it for cold meat, or with sausages on it. Another xoay. Shred the cabbage ; w'ash it; and put it over a slow fire, with slices of onion, pepper, and salt, and a little plain gravy. When quite tender, and a few minutes before serving, add a bit of butter rubbed with flour, and two or three spoonsful of vinegar, and boil up. Another. Cut the cabbage very thin; and put it into the stew- pan with a small slice of ham, and half an ounce of butter, at the bottom, half a pint of broth, and a gill of vinegar. Let it stew covered three hours. When it is very tender, add a little more broth, salt, pepper, and a table-spoonful of piounded sugar. Mix these well, and boil them all till the liquor is wasted: then put it into the dish, and lay fried sausages on it. Steioed Tomatas. Put a dozen and a half tomatas in a stewpan, with two table-spoonsful of vinegar, a little salt, and pepper ; cover them close, and let them stew ten or twelve minutes. Mushrooms. ^ Cooks should be perfectly acquainted with the different sorts of things called by this name by ignorant people, as the death of many persons has been occasioned by carelessly using the poisonous kinds. The eatable mushrooms at first appear very small and of a round form, on a little stalk. They grow very fast, and the upper part and stalk are white. As the size increases, the under part gradually opens, and shows a fringed fur of a very fine salmon colour; which con- tinues more or less till the mushroom has gained some size, and then turns to a dark brown. These marks should be attended to, and likewise whether the skin can be easily parted from the edges and middle. Those s 2DOMESTIC COOKERY. 260 that have a white or yellow fur should be carefully avoided, though many of them have the same smell (but not so strong) as the right sort. To stew Mushrooms. The large buttons are best, and the small flaps while the fur is still red. Rub the large buttons with salt, and a bit of flannel; cut out the fur, and take off the skin from the others. Sprinkle them w'ith salt, and put into a stewpan with some peppercorns: simmer slowly till done; then put a small bit of butter and flour, and two spoonsful of cream; give them one boil, and serve with sippets of bread. To stew Sorrel for Fricandeau and roast Meat. I Wash the sorrel; and put it into a silver vessel, or stone jar, w'ith no more water than hangs to the leaves. Simmer it as slow as you can; and when done enough, put a bit of butter, and beat it w'ell. French Salad. Chop three anchovies, a shalot, and some parsley, small, put them into a bowd with two table-spoonsful of vinegar, one of oil, a little mustard, and salt. When well mixed, add by degrees some cold roast or boiled meat in very thin slices; put in a few at a time, not exceeding two or three inches long. Shake them in the seasoning, and then put more ; cover the bowl close, and let the salad be prepared three hours before it is to be eaten. Garnish wdtli parsley, and a few" slices of the fat. Lobster Salad. Make a salad, and put some of the red part of the lobster to it, cut. This forms a pretty contrast to the white and green of the vegetables. Do not put much oil, as shell fish absorb the sharpness of vinegar. Serve in a dish, not a bowl. Where salads are constantly used, if the ingredients are kept ready, much time and trouble will be saved.261 VEGETABLES. The following proportions make a most excellent salad: Four mustard-ladles of mustard. Four salt-ladles of salt. , Three dessert-spoonsful of essence of anchovies. Four ditto of the best mushroom-ketchup. Three ditto of the best sweet oil. Twelve ditto of vinegar ; and The yolks of three eggs boiled hard. When the salad vegetables are cleaned, and put into a bowl, pour over them a sufficient quantity of the above, and stir it well. A substitute for Egg in Salad. Rub down a dessert-spoonful of a mashed potato, with mustard and salt, and some cream, which answers for oil when that is not at hand; then add vinegar. Tomatas make excellent salad. To boil Potatoes. Set them on a fire, without paring them in cold water; let them half-boil; then throw some salt in, and a pint of cold water, and let them boil again till almost done. Pour off the water; and put a clean cloth over them and then the saucepan cover, and set them by the fire to steam till ready. Many persons yirefer steamers. Potatoes look best when the skin is peeled, not cut. Do new potatoes the same ; but be careful they are taken oft’in time, or they will be watery. Before dress- ing, rub off the skin with a cloth and salt, and then wash. To broil Potatoes. Parboil, then slice and broil them. Or parboil, and then set them whole on the gridiron over a very slow fire ; and when thoroughly done, send them up with their skins on. This last way is practised in many Irish families. To roast Potatoes. Half-hoil, take off the thin peel, and roast them of a beautiful brown.262 DOMESTIC COOKERY. To fry Potatoes. Take the skin off raw potatoes, slice and fry them, either in butter or thin hatter. To mash Potatoes. Boil the potatoes, peel them, and break them to paste ; then to two pounds of them, add a quarter of a pint of milk, a little salt, and two ounces of butter, and stir it all well over the fire. Either serve them in this manner, pr place them on the dish in a form, and then brown the top with a salamander ; or in scallops. Gale Cannon, as dressed in Ireland. Boil three large potatoes with the skins on; bruise them to meal, and mix them with three cabbages, boiled, jiressed from the water, and chopped; to which add half an ounce of butter, two spoonsful of cream, jiepper, and salt. Heat and stir it over the fire ; and send it to table in the shape of a cake, or in a mould. Carrots Require a good deal of boiling when old : when young, wipe off the skin after they are boiled: when old, boil them with the salt meat and scrape them first. To stew Carrots. Half-boil, then nicely scrape, and slice them into a stewpan. Put to them half a tea-cupfid of any weak broth, some pepper and salt, and half a cupful of cream : simmer them till they are very tender, but not broken. Before serving, rub a very little flour with a bit of butter, and warm up with them. If approved, chopped parsley may be added ten minutes before served. To mash Parsnips. Boil them tender; scrape, then mash them into a stewpan with a little cream, a good piece of butter, and pepper and salt. Fricassee of Parsnips. Boil in milk till they arc soft, Then cut them length-VEGETABLES. 266 Avays into bits two or three inches long ; and simmer in a white sauce, made of two spoonsful of broth, a bit gf mace, half a cupful of cream, a bit of butter, and some flour, pepper, and salt. To crisp Parsley. When picked and washed very clean, 'put it into a Dutch oven, or on a sheet of paper, and keeping it at a moderate distance from the fire, turn it till crisp. For another way, see page 6. To dress Chardoons. Cut them into pieces of six inches long, and put on a string; boil till tender, and have ready a piece of butter in a pan ; flour, fry them brown, and serve. Or tie them into bundles; and serve as asparagus ■ boiled, on toast, and pour butter over. Or boil, and then beat them up in fricassee-sauce. Or boil in salt and water, dry, then dip them into butter, and fry them. Serve with melted butter. Or stew in brown or white gravy ; add cayenne, ketchup, and salt. Thicken with a bit of butter, and flour. Beet-roots Make a very pleasant addition to winter-salad; of which they may agreeably form a full half, instead of being only used to ornament it. This root is cooling and very wholesome. It is extremely good boiled, and sliced with a small quantity of onions; or stewed with whole onions, large , or small, as follows : — Boil the beet tender with the skin on ; slice it into a stewpan with a little broth, and a spoonful of vinegar, simmer till the gravy is tinged witli the colour: then put it into a small dish, and make a round of the button- onions, first boiled till tender; takeoff theskin just before serving, and mind they are quite hot, and clear. Or roast three large onions, and peel off the outerDOMESTIC cookery. 264 skins till they look clear ; and serve the heet-root stewed round them. If beet-root is in the least broken before dressed, it parts with its colour, and looks ill. The leaves of white beet yield much juice for green or other soups; and eat much like spinach, if similarly dressed. A Vegetable Olio. Boil three heads of small, close cabbage, carrots, turnips, potatoes, and small onions; drain them from the water, and cut them in pieces. Mix all with two hands- ful of spinach-leaves, two ounces of butter, three spoons- ful of cream, salt and pepper, and stew them as closely covered as possible two hours ; then stir in a hit of butter rolled in flour, over a clear fire. In summer, peas, cucumbers, spinach, celery, lettuces, and young onions, may be dressed the same way. Frying Herbs, as dressed in Staffordshire. Clean and dry a good quantity of spinach-leaves, two large handsful of parsley, and a handful of green onions. Chop the parsley and onions, and sprinkle them among the spinach. Set them all on to stew, with some salt, and a bit of butter the size of a walnut: shake the pan when it begins to grow warm, and let it be closely covered over a close stove till done enough. It is served with slices of broiled calves’ liver, small rashers of bacon, and eggs fried; the latter on the herbs, the other in a separate dish. Sea Cale Must be boiled very white, and served on toast like asparagus. Laver. This is a plant that grows on the rocks near the sea in the West of England, and is sent in pots or casks boiled and prepared for dressing as follows :— Set some of it on a dish over a lamp, with a bit of265 VEGETABLES. butter, and the squeeze of a Seville orange: stir it till hot. It is eaten with roast meat, and is a great sweetener of the blood. It is seldom liked at first, but people become extremely fond of it by habit. Note.—As the air spoils it, the best mode of keeping it is to put it into jars covered with bladders, each con- taining a sufficient quantity for one week’s consumption. To f reserve several Vegetables to eat in the Winter. For French beans, pick them young, and throw into a little wooden keg, a layer of them three inches deep; then sprinkle them with salt, put another layer of beans, and do the same as high as you think proper, alternately with salt, but not too mueh of this. Lay over them a plate or cover of wood, that will go into the keg, and put a heavy stone on it. A pickle will rise from the beans and salt. If they are too salt, the soaking and boiling will not be sufficient to make them pleasant to the taste. When they are to be eaten, cut, soak, and boil them as if fresh. Carrots, Parnips, and Beet-roots should be kept in layers of dry sand for winter rise; and neither they nor potatoes should be cleared from the earth. Potatoes should be carefully kept from frost. Store-onions keep best hung up in a dry cold room. Parsley should be cut close to the stalks ; and dried in a warm room, or on tins in a very cool oven; it pre- serves its flavour and colour, and is very useful in winter. Artichoke-bottoms, slowly dried, should be kept in paper bags; and Trufles, Morels, Lemon-peel, &c., in a dry place, ticketed. Cauliflowers, cut when quite dry, with their leaves on, hung up by the stalk, will keep long ;n a cellar. They must lie in water two or three hours, and be boiled with a great deal of salt. Small close Cabbages, laid on a stone floor, before the frost sets in, will blanch and be very fine, after many weeks’ keeping, although the outer leaves be quite spoiled.266 DOMESTIC COOKERY. ' Substitutes for Garden Vegetables. Hop-tops, that grow in hedges, are good in the spring, boiled in little hunches, and served lik^e asparagus. Turnip-tops have a most pleasant bitter, and are an acceptable substitute for greens in a frosty spring; and are by many preferred with roast veal. • The tops of young green nettles may be used as above in spring, and are considered to be particularly whole- some. PART IX. SWEET DISHES, SWEETMEATS, PRE- SERVES, &c. SWEET DISHES AND SWEET.MEATS. Buttered Rice. Wash and pick some rice, drain, and put it ndth some new milk, enough just to swell it, over the fire; when tender, pour off the milk, and add a bit of butter, a little sugar, and pounded cinnamon. Shake it, that it do not burn, and serve. Souffle of Rice and Apple. Blanch Carolina Rice, strain it, and set it to boil in milk, with lemon-peel, and a bit of cinnamon. Let it boil till the rice is dry; then cool it, and raise a rim three inches high round the dish, having egged the dish where it is put, to make it stick. Then egg the rice all over. Fill the dish half-way up with the marmalade of apples : have ready the whites of four eggs, beaten to a fine froth, and put "them over the marmalade : then sift fine sugar over it, and set it in the oven, which should be warm enough to give it a beautiful colour.SWEET DISHES AND SWEETMEATS. 2G1 Snoiv-halls. Swell rice in milk, strain it olf, ami having pared and cored apples, put the rice round them, tying each up in ii cloth. Put a bit of lemon-peel, a clove, or cinnamon, in each, and boil them well. Butter may be served in the dish, or sent up cold. Lent Potatoes. Beat three or four ounces of almonds and three or four bitter, when blanched, putting a little orange-flower water to prevent oiling ; add eight ounces of butter, four eggs well beaten and strained, half a glass of raisin wine, and sugar to your taste. Beat all well till quite smooth, and grate in three Savoy biscuits. Make balls of the above with a little flour, the size of a chestnut; throw them into a stewpan of boiling lard, and boil them of a beau- tiful yellow brown. Drain them on a sieve. Serve sweet sauce in a boat, to eat with them. Puits d’’Amour. Cut a fine rich puff-paste rolled thin, with tin shapes made on purpose, one size less than another, in a pyra- midical form, and lay them so; then bake in a moderate oven, that the paste may be done sufficiently, but very pale. Lay different coloured sweetmeats on the edges. Spanish Puffs. hlix by degrees two ounces of flour in half a pint of new milk ; stir it over the fire till it becomes a stiffish paste : wdiile hot, pour it into a mortar, with the whole of four eggs well beaten. Beat the batter half an hour, and immediately drop a spoonful at a time on floured tin plates, and bake them in a quick oven. They may be served hot, with pudding-sauce in a dish, or cold; in the latter case, the side should be opened, and jelly or mar- malade put in. A very nice dish of Macaroni dressed sweet.

Lay them on a custard-dish, and pour a custard over them hot: serve cold. Vermicelli answers equally well, hut requires to be less done. Floating Island. Mix three half-pints of thin cream with a quarter of a pint of raisin-wine, a little lemon-juice, orange-flower water, and sugar: put into a dish for the middle of the table, and put on the cream a froth, as will be directed in page 2']8, which may be made of raspberry or currant- jelly. Another loaij. Scald a codlin before it be ripe; or any sharp apple ; pulp it through a sieve. Beat the w'hites of two eggs with sugar, and a spoonful of orange-flow'er water; mix in by degrees the pulp, and beat altogether until you have a large quantity of froth ; serve it on a raspberry cream ; or you may colour the froth with beet-root, raspberry, or currant-jell}^ and set it on a white cream, having given it the flavour of lemon, sugar, and wine, as above ; or put the froth on a custard. Flummery. Put three large handsful of very small white oatmeal to steep a day and night in cold w'ater ; then pour it off clear, and add as mtich more water, and let it stand the same time. Strain it through a fine hair-sieve, and boil it till it be as thick as hasty-pudding; stirring it well all the time. When first strained, put to it one large spoon- ful of white sugar, and two of orange flower-water. POur it into shallow dishes ; and serve to eat with w'ine, cider, milk, or cream and sugar. It is very good. French Flummery. Boil slowly two ounces of isinglass shavings in a quart of cream fifteen minutes. Stir all the time, and sweeten it with loaf sugar, not pounded, lest any dust should be in it; add a spoonful of rose-water, and the same of269 SWEET DISHES AND SWEETMEATS. orange-flower water. Strain it into a basin or form; and serve with baked pears round it. Dutch Flummenj. Boil two ounces of isinglass in three half-pints of water very gently half an hour; add a pint of white wine, the juice of tWee, and the thin rind of one lemon, and rub a few lumps of sugar on another lemon to ob- tain the essence, and with them add as much more sugar as shall make it sweet enough ; and having beaten the yolks of seven eggs, give them and the above, when mixed, one scald; stir all the time, and pour it into a basin ; stir it till half cold ; then let it settle, and put it into a melon shape. Rice Flummery. ‘ Boil with a pint of new milk, a hit of lemon-peel, and cinnamon; mix with a little cold milk as much rice-flour as will make the w'hole of a good consistence, sw'eeten, and add a spoonful of peach-water, or a hitter almond beaten; boil it, observing it do not burn ; pour it into a shape or pint basin, taking out the spice. When cold, turn the flummery into a dish, and serve with cream, milk, or custard round; or put a tea-cupful of cream into half a pint of new milk, a glass of white wine, half a lemon squeezed, and sugar. Somersetshire Frumenty. To a quart of ready-boiled wheat^put by degrees two quarts of new milk, breaking the jelly, and then four ounces of currants, picked clean, and washed ; stir them and boil till they are done. Beat the yolks of three eggs, and a little nutmeg, with two or three spoonsful of milk; add this to the wheat; stir them together while over the fire; then sweeten, and serve cold in a deep dish. Some persons like it best warm. Curds and Cream. Put three or four pints of milkinto a pan a little warm, and then add rennet or gallino. When the curd is come,270 DOMESTIC COOKERY. lade it with a saucer into an earthen shape, perforated, of any form you please. Fill it up as the whey drains off, without breaking or pressing the curd. If turned only two hours before wanted, it is very light; but those who like it harder may have it so, by making it earlier, and squeezing it. Cream, milk, or a wliip of cream, sugar, wine, and lemon, to be put in the dish, or into a glass bowl, to serve with the curd. Another xoay. To four quarts of new milk warmed, put from a pint to a quart of buttermilk strained, according to its sour- ness ; keep the pan covered until the curd be of firmness to cut three or four times across with a saucer, as the whey leaves it; put it into a shape, and fill up until it be solid enough to take the form. Serve with cream plain, or mixed with sugar, wine, and lemon. A Curd Star. Set a quart of new milk upon the fire with two or three blades of mace; and when ready to boil, put to it the yolks and whites of nine eggs well beaten, and as much salt as will lie upon a small knife’s point. Let it boil till the whey is clear; then drain it in a thin cloth, or hair-sieve; season it with sugar, and a little cinnamon, rose-water, orange-flower water, or white wine, to your taste; and put into a star form or any other. Let it stand some hours before you turn it into a dish; then put round it thick cream or custard. Blanc-mange, or Blamange. Boil two ounces of isinglass in three half-pints of water half an hour; strain it to a pint and a half of cream, sweeten it, and add some peach-w'ater, or a few bitter almonds; let it boil once up, and put it into what forms you please. If not to be very stiff, a little less isinglass will do. Observe to let the blamange settle before you turn it into the forms, or the blacks will remain at tlie bottom of them, and be on the top of tlie blamange when taken out of the moulds.SWEET DISHES AND SWEETMEATS. 27 r An excellent Trifle. Lay macaroons and ratafia-drops over the bottom of your dish, and pour in as much raisin-wine as they will suck up; which when they have done, pour on them cold rich custard made with more eggs than directed in the foregoing pages, and some rice-flour. It must stand two or three inches thick; on that put a layer of rasp- berry jam, and cover the whole with a very high whip made the day before, of rich cream, the whites of two w'ell-beaten eggs, sugar, lemon-peel and raisin wine, well beat with a whisk kept only to whip syllabubs and creams. If made the day before used, it has quite a dif- ferent taste, and is solid and far better. Goosebery or Apple Trifle. Scald such a quantity of either of these fruits, as, when pulped through a sieve, will make a thick layer at the bottom of your dish: if of apples, mix the rind of half a lemon grated fine; and to both as much sugar as will be pleasant. Mix half a pint of milk, half a pint of cream, and the yolk of one egg; give it a scald over the fire, and stir it all the time; do not let it boil; add a little sugar only, and let it grow cold. Lay it over the apples with a spoon ; and then put on it a whip made the day before, as for other trifles. Chantilly Cake, or Cake Trifle. Bake a rice-cake in a mould. When cold, cut it round about two inches from the edge with a sharp knife, taking care not to perforate the bottom. Put in a thick custard, and some tea-spoonsful of raspberry-jam, and then put on a high whip. An Indian Trifle. Boil a quart of new milk with a large piece of cinna- mon ; thicken it with flour of rice, first wetted with cold milk; and sweeten to your taste. Pour it into a dish; and when cold cut it into the shape of a star, or any272 DOMESTIC COOKERY. other shape you please. Take out the spare rice, and fill the intervals with boiled custard. Ornament with slit almonds and spots of currant-jelly. Gooseberry Fool. Put the fruit into a stone jar, and some good Lisbon sugar; set the jar on a stove; or in a saucepan of water over the fire; if the former, a large spoonful of water should be added to the fruit. When it is done enough to ])ulp, press it through a colander ; have ready a suffi- cient quantity of new milk, and a tea-cup of raw cream, boiled together, or an egg instead of the latter, and left to be cold; then sweeten pretty well with fine Lisbon sugar, and nii.x; the pulp by degrees with it. Apple Fool. Stew apples as directed for gooseberries, add then peel, and pulp them. Prepare the milk, &c., and mix as before. Orange Fool. Mix the juice of three Seville oranges, three eggs well beaten, a pint of cream, a little nutmeg and cinnamon, and sweeten to your taste. Set the whole over a slow fire, and stir it till it becomes as thick as good melted butter, but it must not be boiled ; then pour it into a dish for eating cold. An excellent substitute for Cream to eat icith Fruit. Beat the yolks of two new-laid eggs, and strain into a pint of new milk, with two knobs of white sugar; put it on a stove, and stir it one way till it becomes as thick as common cream. This also does to mix with tea. A Cream. Boil half a pint of cream, and half a pint of milk, with two bay-leaves, a bit of lemon-peel, a few almonds, beaten to a paste, with a drop of water, a little sugar, orange-flower water, and a tea-spoonful of flour, having been rubbed down with a little cold milk, and mixed273 SWEET DISHES AND SWEETMEATS. with the above. When cold, put a little lemon-juice to the cream, or serve it in cups and lemonade-glasses. . An excellent Cream. Whip up three-quarters of a pint of very rich cream to a strong froth, with some finely-scraped lemon-peel, a squeeze of the juice, half a glass of sweet wine, and sugar to make it pleasant, but not too sweet; lay it on a sieve, or in a form, and next day put it on a dish, and ornament it with very light puff paste biscuits, made in tin shapes the length of a finger, and about two thick, over which sugar may be strewed, or a little glaze with isinglass. Or you may use macaroons, to line the edges of the dish. Burnt Cream. Boil a pint of cream with a stick of cinnamon, and some lemon-peel; take it off the fire, and pour it very slowly into the yolks of four eggs, stirring till half-cold; sweeten and take out the spice, &c.; pour it into the dish; when cold, strew white pounded sugar over, and brown it with a salamander. Arwther icay. Make a rich custard without sugar, boiling lemon- peel in it. When cold, sift a good deal of sugar over the whole, and brown the top with a salamander. A very fine Italian Cream. Whip together a quart of very thiek scalded cream, a quart of raw cream, the grated rind of four lemons, and the strained juice, with ten ounces of white powdered sugar, one hour; then add half a pint of sweet wine, and continue to whisk it until it becomes quite solid. Lay a piece of muslin in a sieve, and lade the cream upon it with a spoon. In twenty hours turn it carefully out, but mind that it does not break, and garnish it with a wreath of flowers. Sack Cream. Boil a pint of raw cream, the yolk of an egg well TDOMESTIC COOKERY. 274 (beaieii, two or three spoonsful of wliite wine, sugar, and Jemon-peel; stir it over a gentle .fire till it be as thick as rich cream, and afterwards till cold; then serve it in glasses, with long pieces of dry toast. Brandy Cream. Boil two dozen of almonds blanched, and pounded bitter almonds, in a little milk. When cold add to it the yolks of five eggs beaten well in a little cream, sweeten, and put to it two glasses of the best brandy; and when well mixed pour to it a quart of thin cream : set it over the fire, but do not let it boil; stir one way till it thickens, then pour into cups or low glasses. When cold it will be ready. A ratafia-drop may be put in each, if you choose it. If you wish it to keep, scald the cream previously. Ratafia Cream. Boil three or four lairrel, peach, or nectarine leaves in a full pint of cream ; strain it; and when cold, add the yolks of three eggs beaten and strained, sugar, and a large spoonful of brandy stirred quick into it. Scald till thick, stirring it all the time. Another xoay. Mix half a quarter of a pint of ratafia, the same quantity of mountain wine, the juice of two or three lemons, a pint^of rich cream, and as much sugar as will make it pleasantly flavoured. Beat it with a whisk, and put it into glasses. This cream will keep eight or ten days. Lemon Cream. Take a pint of thick cream, and put to it the yolks of two eggs well beaten, four ounces of fine sugar, and the thin rind of a lemon ; boil it up, then stir it till almost cold; put the juice of a lemon in a dish, or bowl, and pour the cream upon it, stirring it till quite cold.

Pour it into jelly-glasses. A few lumps of sugar should be rubbed hard on the lemons before they are pared, or after, as the peel will be so thin as not to take all the essence, and the sugar will attract it, and give a better colour and flavour. White Lemon Cream Is made the same as the above; only put the whites of the eggs in lieu of the yolks, whisking it extremely well to froth. Vanilla Cream. Boil half a stick of vanilla in a quarter of a pint of new milk until it has a very high flavour ; have ready a jelly of an oun,ce of isinglass to a pint of w'ater, which mix with the milk, and a pint and quarter of fine cream; sweeten ivith fine sugar unbroken, and stir till nearly cold; then dip a mould into cold water, and pour the whole into it. Make it the day before it be wanted. Imperial Cream. Boil a quart of cream with the thin rind of a lemon, then stir it till nearly cold; have ready in a dish or bowl that you are to serve in, the juice of three lemons, strained with as much sugar as will sweeten the cream; -which pour into the dish from a large tea-pot, holding it high, and moving it about to mix with the jnjce. It should be at least six hours before it is served, and will be still better if a day. Almond Cream. Beat four ounces of sw'eet almonds, and a few bitter, both having been blanched, in a mortar, with a tea- spoonful of water to prevent oiling. Put the paste to a276 DOMESTIC COOKERY. quart of cream, and add the juice of three lemons sweetened : beat it up with a whisk to a froth, which take off on the shallow part of a sieve; fill glasses with some of the liquor and the froth. Snoiv Cream. Put to a quart of cream the whites of three eggs well beaten, four spoonsful of sweet wine, sugar to your taste, and a bit of lemon-peel; whip it to a froth, remove the peel, and serve in a dish. Coffee Cream, much admired. Boil a calf’s foot in water till it wastes to a pint of jelly, clear of sediment and fat. Make a tea-cup of very strong coffee ; clear it with a bit of isinglass to be perfectly bright; pour it to the jelly, and add a pint of very good cream, and as much fine Lisbon sugar as is pleasant; give one boil up, and pour into the dish. It should jelly, but not be stiff. Observe that your coffee be fresh. Chocolate Cream. Scrape into one quart of thick cream one ounce of the best chocolate, and a quarter of a pound of sugar; boil and mill it; when quite smooth, take it off, and leave it to be cold; then add the whites of nine eggs. Whisk; and take up the froth on sieves, as others are done; and serve the froth in glasses, to rise above some of the cream. Codlin Cream. Pare and core twenty good codlins; beat them in a mortar, with a pint of cream; strain it into a dish; and put sugar, hread-crumbs, and a glass of wine to it. Stir it well. Excellent Orange Cream. Boil the rind of a Seville orange very tender: beat it fine in a mortar; put to it a spoonful of the best brandy, the juice of a Seville orange, four ounces of loaf sugar, and the yolks of four eggs; beat all together for ten minutes; then, by gentle degrees, pour in a pint of boil-2'77 SWEET PISHES AND SWEETMEATS. ing cream ; beat till cold ; put into custard-cups set into a deep dish of boiling water, and let them stand till cold again. Pul at the top small strips of orange-paring cut thin, or preserved chips. Raspberry Cream. Mash the fruit gently, and let them drain; then sprinkle a little sugar over, and that will produce more juice; then put the juice to some cream, and sweeten it: after which, if you choose to lower it with some milk, it will not curdle; which it would, if put to the milk before the cream ; but it is best made of raspberry jelly, instead of jam, when the fresh fruit cannot be obtained. Another tvay. Boil one ounce of isinglass-shavings in three pints of cream and new milk mi.ved, for fifteen minutes, or until the former be melted; strain it through a hair-sieve into a basin; when cold put about half a pint of raspberry- juice, or syrup, to the milk and cream ; stir it till well incorporated; sweeten, and add a glass of brandy; whisk it about till three parts cold; then put it into a mould till quite cold. In summer, use the fresh juice ; in winter, syrup of raspberries. Spinach Cream. Beat the yolks of eight eggs with a wooden spoon or a whisk; sweeten them a good deal; and put to them a stick of cinnamon, a pint of rich cream, three-quarters of a pint of new milk; stir it w’ell; then add a quarter of a pint of spinach-juice; set it over a gentle stove, and stir it one way constantly till it is as thick as a hasty pudding. Put into a custard-dish some Naples biscuits, or preserved orange, in long slices, and pour the mixture over them. 11 is to be eaten cold ; and is a dish either for supper, or for a second course. Pistachio Cream. Blanch four ounces of pistachio nuts; beat them fine with a little rose-w'ater, and add the paste to a pint of cream; sweeten; let it just boil, and put it into glasses.DOMESTIC COOKERY. 218 Another. Mix half a quarter of a pint of ratafia, the same quan- tity of mountain wine, the juice of three lemons, a pint of rich cream, and three ounces of fine sugar. Beat with a whisk, and put it into glasses. Clouted Cream. String four blades of mace on a thread ; put them to a gill of new milk, and six spoonsful of rose-water; sim- mer a few minutes: then by degrees stir this liquor strained into the yolks of two new eggs well beaten. Stir the whole into a quart oi very good cream, and set it over the fire ; stir it till hot, but not boiling-hot; pour ’ it into a deep dish, and let it stand twenty-four hours. Serve it in a cream dish, to eat with fruits. Many people prefer it without any flavour but that of cream ; in which case use a quart of new milk and the cream, or do it as the Devonshire scalded cream. When done enough, a round mark will appear on the surface of the cream, the size of the. bottom of the pan it is done in, which in the country they call the ring; and when that is seen, remove the pan from the fire. Oryiamented Custard as used in France. Put a rich custard into a shallow dish: ^yhen it shall have become cold, lay on it, in any shape you please, the beaten whites of two new-laid eggs in a firm froth, and over that sift refined sugar. Put it into an oven to be- come a fine lisjht brown. A Froth to set on Cream, Custard, or Trifle, which looh^ and eats well. Sweeten half a pound of the pulp of damsons or any other sort of scalded fruit, put to it the whites of four eggs beaten, and beat the pulp with them until it will stand as high as you choose ; and being put on the cream, &c., with a spoon, it will take any form: it should be rough, to imitate a rock.SWEET DISHES AND SWEETMEATS. 219 A Carmel Cover for Sweetmeats. Dissolve eight ounces of double-refined sugar in three or four spoonsful of water, and three or four drops of lemon-juice ; then put it into a copper untinned skillet; when it boils to be thick, dip the handle of a spoon in it, and put that into a pint basin of water, squeeze the sugar from the spoon into it, and so on till you have all the sugar. Take a bit out of the water, and if it snaps and is brittle when cold, it is done enough ; but only let it he three parts cold, th'en pour the water from the sugar, and having a copper form oiled well, run the sugar on it, in the manner of a maze, and when cold you may put it on the dish it is to cover: hut if on trial the sugar is not brittle, pour off the water, and turn it into the skillet, and boil it again. It should look thick, like treacle, but of a bright light gold colour. It is a most elegant cover. Calf’s Feet Jelly. Boil two feet in two quarts and a pint of water till the feet are broken, and the water half w'asted ; strain it, and’ when cold, take off the fat, and remove the jelly from the sediment; then put it into a saucepan, with sugar, raisin wine, lemon juice to your taste, and some lemon- peel. When the flavour is rich, put to it the whites of five eggs well beaten, and their shells broken. Set the saucepan on the fire, hut do not stir the jelly after it hesins to warm. Let it boil twentv minutes after it rises to a head ; then pour it through a flannel jelly-bag, first dipping the hag in hot water to ]>revent waste, and squeezing it quite dry. Run the jelly through and through until clear ; then put it into glasses or forms. The following mode will greatly facilitate the clearing of jelly;—When the mixture has boiled twenty minutes, throw in a tea-cupful of cold water; let it boil five, minutes longer; then take the saucepan off the fire, covered close, and keep it half an hour; after which, it will be so clear as to need only once running through the bag, and much waste will be saved.DOMESTIC COOKERY. 280 Observe, feet for all jellies are boiled so long by the people who sell them, that they are less nutritious; they should be only scalded, to take off the hair. The liquor will require greater care in removing the fat ; but the jelly will be far stronger, and of course allow more water. Note.—Jelly is equally good made of cow-heels nicely cleaned ; and as they bear a less price than those of calves, and make a stronger jelly, this observation may be useful. Another loay. Boil four quarts of water with three calf’s feet, or two cow-heels, that have been only scalded, till half wasted ; take the jelly from the fat and sediment; mix with it the juice of a Seville orange and twelve lemons; the peels of three ditto, the whites and shells of twelve eggs, brown sugar to taste, near a pint of raisin wine, one ounce of coriander-seeds, a quarter of an ounce of allspice, a bit of cinnamon, and six cloves, all bruised, after having previously mixed them cold. The jelly should boil fifteen minutes without stirring; then clear it through a flannel bag. While running, take a little jelly, and mix with a tea-cupful of water in wliich a bit of beet-root has been boiled, and run it through the bag when all the rest is run out; and this is to garnish the other jelly, being cooled on a plate; but this is matter of choice. This jelly has a very fine high colour and flavour. Fruit in Jelly. Put into a basin half a pint of clear calf’s-foot jelly ; and when it has become stiff, lay in three fine peaches, and a bunch of grapes wdth the stalk upwards; over which put a few vine-leaves, and fill up the bowl with jelly. Let it stand till next day, and then set the bowl in hot water up to tlic brim for a minute ; tlien turn it out carefully on a dish. Orange Jelly. Grate the rind of tvvo Seville and two China oranges,281 SWEET DISHES AND SWEETMEATS. and two lemons; squeeze the juice of three of each, and strain, and add a quarter of a pound of lump sugar and a quarter of a pint of water, and boil till it almost candies. Have ready a quart of jelly made with two ounces of isinglass; put to it the syrup, and boil it once up ; strain off the jelly, and let it stand to settle as above, before it is put into the mould. Hartshorn Jelly. Simmer eight ounces of hartshorn shavings with two quarts of water to one; strain it and boil it with the rinds of four China oranges and two lemons pared thin; when cool, add the juice of both, half a pound of sugar, and the whites of six eggs beaten to a froth; let the jelly have three or four boils without stirring, and strain it through a jelly-bag. Cranberry Jelly. Make a very strong isinglass jelly. When cold, mix it with a double quantity of cranberry juice. Sweeten and boil it up; then strain it into a shape. The sugar must be good loaf, or the jelly will not be clear. Cranberry and Rice Jelly. Boil and press the fruit, strain the juice, and by de- grees mi.x into it as much ground rice as will, when boiled, thicken to a jelly ; boil it gently, stirring it, and sweeten to your taste. Put it in a basin or form, and serve to eat as the before-directed jelly, with milk or cream. Apple Jelly, to serve at table. Prepare twenty golden pippins; boil them in a pint and a half of water from the spring, till quite tender; then strain the liquor through a colander. To every pint put a pound of fine sugar ; add grated orange or lemon; then boil to a jelly. Another. Prepare apples as before by boiling and straining;DOMESTIC COOKERY. 282 have ready half an ounce of isinglass boiled in half a pint of water to a jelly; put this to the apple water, and apple strained as through a coarse sieve; add sugar, a little lemon-juice and peel; boil all together, and put into a dish. Take out the peel. Apples a la Cremone; a beautiful dish. Choose such apples as will look clear when dressed ; pare, and cut into pieces the form of a brick a sufficient quantity to weigh a pound and a half; strew over them a pound of good Lisbon sugar, and several long strips o£ lemon-peel, and cover them close in a bowl. Next day put the apples, piece by piece, into a small preserving- pan, with the sugar, &c., and two large spoonsful of strong cider. Simmer gently ; and as the pieces of apple be- come clear, take them out. When cold, build a wall with them on a small oval dish, and place the lemon-peel on the top; pour the syrup into the middle. Serve cream to eat with it. The peel of China orange, cut very thin, does as well as lemon. To scald Codlins. Wrap each in a vine-leaf, and pack them close in a nice saucepan ; and when full, pour as much water as will cover them. Set it over a gentle fire, and let them simmer slowly till done enough to take the thin skin off when cold. Place them in a dish, with or without milk, cream, or custard ; if the latter, there should be no ratafia. Dust fine sugar over the apples. Stewed Golden Pippins. Scoop out the core, pare them very thin, and as you do it, throw them in water. For every pound of fruit, make half a pound of single-refined sugar into syrup, with a pint of water; when skimmed, put the pippins in, and stew till clear; then grate lemon over, and serve; in the syrup. Be careful not to let them break. They are an elegant and good dish for a corner or dessert.283 SWEET DISHES AMD SWEETMEATS. Black Caps. Halve and core some fine large apples, put them in a shallow pan, strew white sugar over, and bake them. Boil a glass of wine, the same of water, and sweeten it for sauce. Another icay. Take off a slice from the stalk end of some apples, and core without paring them. Make ready as much sugar as may be sufficient to sweeten them, and mix it with some grated lemon, and a few cloves in fine powder.. Stuff the holes as close as possible with this, and turn the flat end down on tlie stewpan; set them on a very slow fire, with half of raisin wine, and the same of water; cover them close, and now and then baste them with the. liquor; when done enough, black the tops with a salamander. Stewed Pears. Pare and halve, or quarter large pears, according to their size; throw them into water, as the skin is taken off, before they are divided, to prevent their turning black. Pack them round a block-tin stewpan, and sprinkle as much sugar over as will make them pretty sweet, and add lemon-peel, a clove or-two, and some allspice cracked ; just cover them with water, and put some of the red liquor, as directed in page 286. Cover them close, and stew three or four hours; when tender, take them out, and pour the liquor from them. Baked Pears. These need not he of a fine sort; but some taste bet- ter than others, and often those that are least fit to eat raw. Wipe, but do not pare, and lay them on tin plates, and bake them in a slow oven. When enough to bear it, flatten them with a silver spoon. When done through, put them on a dish. They should be baked three or four times, and very gently.284 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Orange Butter. Boil six hard eggs, heat them in a mortar witli two ounces of fine sugar, three ounces of butter, and two ounces of blanched almonds beaten to a paste. Moisten with orange-flower water, and when all is mixed, rub it through a colander on a dish, and serve sweet biscuits between. Orange Posset. Boil the grated crumb of a penny-loaf in a pint of water, with the grated peel of a Seville orange, till the mixture be clear and thick: then add three ounces of sweet and one bitter almond, beaten with half a glass of brandy, half the juice of an orange, four ounces of sugar, and a pint of mountain wine. Serve in a China bowl. Wine Roll. Soak a penny French roll in raisin wdne till it will hold no more; put it in the dish, and pour round it a custard, or cream, sugar, and lemon juice. Just before it is served, sprinkle over it some nonpareil comfits ; or stick a few blanched slit almonds into it. Sponge biscuits may be used instead of the roll. To prepare Ice for Iceing. Get a few pounds of ice, break it almost to powder, throw a large handful and a half of rock salt among it. You must prepare it in a part of the house where as little of the warm air comes as you can possibly contrive. The ice and salt being in a bucket, put your cream into an iee-pot, and cover it; immerse it in the ice, and draw that round the pot, so as to touch every possible part. In a few minutes put a spatula or spoon in, and stir it well, removing the parts that ice round the edges to the centre. If the ice cream or water be in a form, shut the bottom close, and move the whole in the ice, as you cannot use a spoon to that without danger of waste.SWEET EISHES AND SWEETMEATS. 28S There should be holes in the bucket, to let off the ice as it thaws. Note.—When any fluid tends towards cold, the tnoviiTg it quickly accelerates the cold; and likewise, when any fluid is tending to heat, stirring it will facilitate its boiling. Ice Wafers. Rub some fine sugar on lemon or orange, to give the colour and flavour, then squeeze the juice of either on its respective peel; add water and sugar to make a fine sherbet, and strain it before it be put into the ice-pot. If orange, the greater proportion should be of the China juice, and only a little of Seville, and a small bit of the peel grated by the sugar. Currant or Raspberry-water Ice- The juice of these, or any other sort of fruit, being gained by squeezing, sweetened, and mixed with water, will be ready for iceing. Ice Creams. To a pound of preserved fruit, of any kind, add a quart of cream, the juice of two lemons, to thicken the flavour, and sugar to your taste. Rub the whole through a fine hair sieve; and to raspberry, or any other red fruit, add a little cochineal colouring, to give a better tint. Brown Bread Ice. Grate as fine as possible stale brown bread, soak a small proportion in cream two or three hours, sweeten, and ice it; but keep stirring, that the bread mav not sink. Ice Punch, as used in Italy. Make a rich sherbet, and grate a piece of sugar on a lemon or citron for flavour; then heat the whites of five or six eggs to a froth, and by degrees stir it into the sherbet: add ruin and ice, and serve in glasses.286 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Iced Ratijia Credm. Blanch a quarter of an ounce of bitter almonds, and beat them with a tea-spoonful of water in a marble mor- tar : then rub with the paste two ounces of lump sugar, and simmer ten minutes with a tea-cup of cream, which add to a quart more of cream, and having strained, ice it. Colourings to stain Jellies, Ices, or Cakes. For a beautiful red, boil fifteen grains of cochineal in the finest powder, with a dram and a half of cream of tartar, in half a pint of water, very slowly, half an hour. Add in boiling a bit of alum the size of a pea. Or use beet-root sliced, and some hquor poured over. For lohite, use almonds finely powdered, with a little drop of water; or use cream. For yellow, yolks of eggs or a hit of saffron steeped in the liquor, and squeezed. Likewise the flower of the crocus, which has no taste. For green, pound spinach leaves or beet leaves, ex- press the juice, and boil in a tea-cup in a saucepan of water to take off the rawness. London Syllabub. Put a pint and a half of port or white wine into a bowl, nutmeg grated, and a good deal of sugar, then milk into it near two quarts of milk, frothed up. If the wine be not rather sharp, it will require more for this quantity of milk. • In Devonshire, clouted cream is put on the top, and pounded cinnamon and sugar. Staffordshire Syllabub. Put a pint of cider, and a glass of brand}', sugar, and nutmeg, into a bowl, and milk into it; or pour warm milk from a large teapot some height into it. A very fine Somersetshire and Devonshire Syllabub. In a large China bowl put a pint of port, and a pintSWEET.T3ISHES .AND SWEETMEATS. 287 .'of sherry, or other white wine; sugar to taste. Milk the bowl full. In tvventy minutes’ time cover it pretty high with clouted cream ; grate over it nutmeg,, put pounded cinnamon, and nonpareil comfits. Devonshire Junket. Put warm milk into a bowl; turn it with rennet; then put some scalded cream, sugar, and cinnamon, on the top, without breaking the curd. Everlasting or Solid Syllabubs. ]\Iix a quart of thick raw cream, one pound of refined sugar, a pint and a half of fine i-aisin wine, in a deep pan; put to it the grated peel and the juice of three lemons. Beat or whisk it one way, half an hour; then put it on a sieve with a bit of thin muslin laid smooth dn the shallow end till next day. Put it in glasses. It will keep good, in a cool place, ten days. Lemon Honeycomb. Sweeten the juice of a lemon to your taste, and put it in the dish that you serve it in. Mix the white of an egg that is beaten with a pint of rich cream, and a little sugar; whisk it, and as the froth rises, put it on the lemon juice. Do it the day before it is to be used. Sago, Rice, Russian Seed, Tapioca, Vermicelli, or Macaroni Milk. Wash either of them well; simmer with milk; and add sugar, lemon-peel, nutmeg, &c. &c., as you like. A pretty Supper Dish. Boil a tea-cupful of rice, having first washed it iri milk till tender; strain off the milk, lay the rice in little heaps on a dish, strew them over some finely-powdered sugar and cinnamon, and put warm wnne and a little butter into the dish. Savoury Rice. Wash and pick some rice, stew it very gently in a small quantity of veal or rich mutton broth, with an onion, a blade of mace, pepper, and salt. When swelledDOMESTIC COOKERY. 288 but not boiled to mash, dry it on the shallow end of a sieve before the fire, and either serve it dry', or put it in the middle of a dish, and pour the gravy round, having heated it. Carrole of Rice. Take some well-picked rice, wash it well, and boil it five minutes in water, strain it, and put it into a ;-,tew- pan with a bit of butter, a good slice of ham, and an onion. Stew it over a very gentle fire till tender : have ready a mould lined with very thin slices of bacon: mix the yolks of two or three eggs with the rice, and then line the bacon with it about half an inch thick; put into it a ragout of chicken, rabbit, veal, or of anything else. Fill up the mould, and cover it close with rice. Bake it in a quick oven an hour, turn it over, and send it to table in a good gravy, or curry-sauce. Casserol, or Rice Edging, see page 162. Sabnagundy Is a beautiful small dish, if in nice shape, and if the colours of the ingredients are varied. For this purpose chop separately the white part of cold chicken or veal, yolks of eggs boiled hard, the whites of eggs, parsley, half a dozen anchovies, beet-root, red pickled cabbage, ham and grated tongue, or anything wxll flavoured, and of a good colour. Some people like a small proportion of onion, but it may be better omitted. A saucer, large tea-cup, or any other base, must be put into a small dish; then make rows round it wide at bottom, and growing smaller towards the top; choosing such of the ingredients for each row as will most vary the colours. At the top a little sprig of curled parsley may be stuck in ; or without anything on the dish, the sabnagundy may be laid in rows, or put into the half whites of eggs, which may be made to stand upright by cutting ofl‘ a little bit at the round end. In the latter case, each half- egg has but one ingredient. Curled butter and parsley may be put as garnish between.SWEET DISHES AND SWEETMEATS. 289 Macaroni^ as usually served. Boil it in milk, or a weak veal-broth, pretty well fla- voured with salt. When tender, put it into a dish with- out the liquor, and among it put some hits of hutter and grated cheese, and over the top grate more, and a little more butter. Set the dish into a Dutch oven a quarter of an hour, but do not let the top become hard. Another way. Wash it well, and simmer in half milk, and half broth of veal or mutton, till it is tender. To a spoonful of this liquor, put the yolk of an egg beaten in a spoonful of cream ; just make it hot to thicken but not boil: put it over the macaroni, and then grate fine old cheese all over, and bits of butter. Brown with the salamander. Another. Wash the macaroni, then simmer it in a little broth, with a little pounded mace and salt. When quite tender, take it out of the liquor, lay it in a dish, grate a good deal of cheese over, then cover that with bread grated fine. Warm some butter without oiling, and pour it from a boat through a little earthen colander all over the crumbs, then put the dish in a Dutch oven to roast the cheese, and brown the bread of a fine colour. The bread should be in separate crumbs, and look light. White Pot. Boil a quart of new milk, with two ounces of sugar, a tea-spoonful of pounded cinnamon, four tea-spoonsful of rose-water, and a little nutmeg, and mix, when cool, with four beaten eggs. Pour it over the crumb of a small loaf sliced in a dish. Let it soak two hours; then bake it half an hour with bits of butter scattered over. Rice White Pot. Boil a pound of cleaned rice in a quart of milk. Boil also a ])int of cream, three blades of mace, two large u290 DOMESTIC COOKERY. spoonsful of bread crumbs, four ounces of sugar, and some rose-water; when cool, beat it by degrees into four well-beaten eggs, and mix all together. Pour it into a deep dish, lay candied orange and lemon over, and bake in a slow oven. Omelet. Make a batter of eggs and milk, and a very little flour; put to it chopped parsley, green onions, or chives (the latter is best), or a very small quantity of shalot, a little pepper, salt, and a scrape or two of nutmeg. Make some butter boil in a small frying-pan, and pour the above batter into it; when one side is of a fine yellow brown, • turn it, and do the other. Double it when served. ; Some scraped lean ham, or grated tongue, put in at first, 1 is a very pleasant addition. Four eggs will make a pretty-sized omelet: but many cooks will use eight or ten. A small proportion of flour should be used. 1 If the taste be approved, a little tarragon gives a fine flavour. A good deal of parsley should be used. Ramakins and omelet, though usually served in the course, would be much better if they w'ere sent up after, that they might be eaten as hot as possible. Ramakins, \ Scrape a quarter of a pound of Cheshire, and ditto of Gloucester cheese, ditto of good fresh butter; then beat all in a mortar wdth the yolks of four eggs, and the inside of a small French roll boiled in cream till soft; mix the paste then w'ith the w'hites of the eggs previously beaten, and put into small paper pans made rather long than square, and bake in a Dutch oven till of a fine brown. They should be eaten quite hot. Some like the addition of a glass of white wine. The batter for ramakins is equally good over macaroni when boiled tender: or on stewed broccoli, celery, or cauliflower, a little of the gravy they have been stewedSWEET DISHES AND SWEETMEATS. .291 in being put in the dish with them, hut not enough to .make the vegetables swim. To 'prepare Barberries for Tartlets. Pick barberries, that have no stones, from the stalks, and to every pound weigh three-quarters of a pound of lump sugar; put the fruit into a stone ]^x, and either set it on a hot hearth, or in a saucepan of water, and let them simmer very slowly till soft: put them and the sugar into a preserving-pan, and boil them gently fifteen minutes. Use no metal but silver. Barberries in bunches. Have ready bits of flat white wood, three inches long and a quarter of an inch wide. Tie the stalks of the fruits on the sticks from loithin an inch of one end to beyond the other, so as to make them look handsome. Simmer them in some syrup two successive days, cover- ing them each time with it when cold. When they look clear they are simmered enough. The third day, do them like other candied fruit. Apricot Cheese. Weigh an equal quantity of pared fruit and sugar, wet the latter a very little, and let it boil quickly, or the colour w'ill be spoiled; blanch the kernels, and add to it. Twenty or thirty minutes will boil it. Put it in small pots or cups half-filled. Orange Marmalade. Rasp the oranges, cut out the pulp, then boil the rinds very tender, and beat fine in a marble mortar. Boil three pounds of loaf-sugar in a pint of water, skim it, and add a pound of the rind; boil fast till the syrup is very thick, hut stir it carefully; then put a pint of the pulp and juice, the seeds having been removed, and a pint of apple liquor; boil all gently until well jellied, wliich it will be in about half an hour. Put it into small pots. . d2DOMESTIC COOKERY. 292 Lemon Marmalade do in the same way: they are very good and elegant sweetmeats. Transparent Marmalade. Cut the palest Seville oranges in quarters; take the pulp out and put in a basin, pick out the seeds and skins. Let the outsides soak in water with a little salt all night, then boil them in a good quantity of spring Avater till tender: drain, and cut them in very thin slices, and put them to the pulp; and to every pound, a pound and a half of double refined sugar beaten fine; boil them together twenty minutes, but be careful not to break the slices. If not quite clear, simmer five or six minutes longer. It must be stirred all the time very gentlv. When cold, put it into glasses. To butter Oranges to be eaten hot. Grate off a little of the outside rind of four Seville oranges, and cut a round hole at the blunt end opposite the stalk, large enough to take out the pulp and seeds and juice; then pick the seeds and skin from the pulp; rub the oranges with a little salt, and lay them in water for a short time. You are to save the bits cut out. Set the fruit on to boil in fresb water till they are tender, shifting the water to take out the bitterness. In the mean time make a thin syrup with fine sugar, and put the oranges into it, and boil them up; turning them round, that each part may partake of the syrup, as there need not be enough to cover them, and let them remain in it hot till they are to be served. About half an hour before you want them put some sugar to the ])ulp, aud set over the fire; mix it well and let it boil; then add a spoonful of white wine for every orange, give it a boil, and then put in a bit of fresh butter, and stir over the fii-e to thicken; fill the oranges with it, and serve them with some of the syrup in the dish. Put the bits on the top.293 SWEET DISHES AND SWEETMEATS. To Jill preserved Oranges; a corner dish. For five take a pound of Naples biscuits, some blanched almonds, the jmlks of four eggs beaten, sugar to your taste, four ounces of butter warmed: grate the biscuits and mix with the above, and some orange-flower water. Fill preserved oranges, and bake in a very slow oven. If you like them frosted, sift sugar over them as soon as filled; otherMuse wipe them. Custard to fill will do as well; if so, you need not bake the oranges, but put it in when become cold. Whole Oranges carved. Cut on the rinds any shape you please with a pen- knife ; cut a bit off near and round the stalk, and with an apple-scoop take all the Jiulp carefully out; put them into salt and water two days, changing it daily; boil them an hour or more in fresh salt and water; drain them quite dry: let them stand a night more in plain water, and then another night in a thin syrup, in which boil them the next day a few minutes. Do this four days successively. Let them stand six or seven weeks, observing often whether they keep well; otherwise boil the syrup again. Then make a rich syrup. Buttered Orange-juice, a cold dish. Mix the juice of seven Seville oranges with four spoonsful of rose-water, and add the whole to the yolks of eight, and whites of four eggs, well beaten ; then strain the liquor to half a pound of sugar pounded, stir it over a gentle fire, and when it begins to thicken, put about the size of a small walnut of butter; keep it over the fire a few minutes longer; then pour it into a flat dish, and serve it to eat cold. If you have no silver saucepan, do it in a China basin in a saucepan of boiling water, the top of which will just receive the basin. Orange Chips. Cut oranges in halves, squeeze the juice through a294 DOMESTIC COOKERY. sieve; soak the peel in water; next day boil in tiie same till tender, drain them, and slice the peels, put them to the juice, weigh as much sugar, and put all together into a broad earthen dish, and put over the fire at a moderate distance, often stirring till the chips candy; then set them in a cool room to dry. They will not be so under three weeks. Orange Biscuits, or little Cakes. Boil whole Seville oranges, in two or three waters, till most of the bitterness is gone; cut them, and take out the pulp and juice ; then beat the outside very fine in a mortar, and put to it an equal weight of double-refined sugar, beaten and sifted. When extremely well mixed to a paste, spread it thin on China dishes, and set them in the sun, or before the fire; when half-dry, cut it into what fomr you please, turn the other side up, and dry that. Keep them in a box with layers of paper. They are for desserts; and are also useful as a sto- machic, to carry in the pocket on journeys, or for gentle- men when shooting, and for gouty stomachs. Oi'ange-Jlower Cakds. Put four ounces of the leaves of the flowers into cold water for an hour: drain, and put between napkins, and roll with a rolling-pin till they are bruised; then have, ready boiled a pound of sugar to add to it in a thick syrup, give them a simmer until the syrup adheres to the sides of the pan, drop in little cakes on a plate, and dry as before dhected. Lemon Drops. Grate three large lemons, with a large piece of double- refined sugar; then scrape the sugar into a plate, add half a tea-spoonfiil of flour, mix well, and beat it into a light paste with the white of an egg. Drop it upon white paper, and put the drops into a moderate oven on a. tin plate.295 SWEET DISHES AND SWEETMEATS. Barhei'ry Drops. The black tops must be cut otf; then roast the fruit before the fire, till soft enough to pulp with a silver spoon through a sieve into a China basin; then set the basin in a saucepan of water, the top of which will just fit it, or on a hot hearth, and stir it till it grows thick. When cold, put to every pint a pound and a half of sugar, the finest double-refined, pounded and sifted through a lawn sieve (which must be covered with a fine linen), to prevent its wasting while sifting. Beat the sugar and juice together three hours and a half if a large quantity, but two and a half for less; then drop it on sheets of white thick paper, the size of the drops sold in the shops. Some fruit is not so sour, and then less sugar is ne- cessary. To know if there be enough, mix till well incor- porated, and then drop; if it run, there is not enough sugar, and if there is too much, it will be rough. A dry room will suffice to dry them. No metal must touch the juice, but the point of the knife, just to take the drop off the end of the wooden spoon, and then as little as pos- sible. Ginger Drops : a good Stomachic. Beat two ounces of fresh candied orange in a mortar, with a little sugar, to a paste; then mix one ounce of powder of white ginger, with one pound of loaf-sugar,- Wet the sugar with a little water, and boil altogether to a candy, and drop it on paper the size of mint drops. Peppermint Drops. Pound and sift four ounces of double-refined sugar, beat it with the whites of two eggs till perfectly smooth; then add sixty drops of oil of peppermint, beat it well and drop on white paper, and dry at a distance from the fire. Ratafia Drops. Blanch and beat in a mortar four ounces of bitter, and two ounces of sweet almonds, with a little of a pound ofDOMESTIC COOKERY. 296 sugar sifted, and add the remainder of the sugar, and the whites of two eggs, making a paste; of which put little balls, the size of a nutmeg, on -wafer-paper, and bake gently on tin plates. Raspberry Cakes. Pick out any had raspberries that are among the fruit, weigh and boil what quantity you please, and when mashed, and the liquor is wasted, put to it sugar the weight of the fruit you first put into the pan; mix it well off the fire until perfectly dissolved, then put it on China plates, and dry it in the sun. As soon as the top part dries, cut with the cover of a canister into small cakes, turn them on fresh plates, and when dry, put them in boxes with layers of paper. China-orange Juice. A very useful thing to mix with water in Fevers, when the fresh juice cannot be pro- cured. Squeeze from the finest fruit a pint of juice strained through fine muslin, and gently simmer with three quar- ters of a pound of double-refined sugar twenty minutes: when cold, put in small bottles. Orgeat. Boil a quart of new milk with a stick of cinnamon, sweeten to your taste, and let it grow cold; then pour it by degrees to three ounces of almonds, and twenty hitter, that have been blanched and beaten to a paste, with a little water to prevent oiling : boil all together, and stir till cold, then add half a glass of brandy. Another way. Blanch and pound thi-ee-quarters of a pound of al- monds, and thirty bitter, with a spoonful of water. Stir in by degrees two pints of water, and three of milk, and strain the whole through a cloth. Dissolve half a pound of fine sugar in a pint of water, boil and skim it well; mix it with the other, as likewise two spoonsful of orange-flower water, and a tea-cupful of the best brandy.PRESERVES. 29T PRESERVES, &C. Observations on Preserves. Preserves should be kept carefully from the air, and in a very dry ])lace. Unless they have a very small proportion of sugar, a warm one does not hurt; but when not properly boiled (that is, long enough, but not quick), heat makes them ferment; and damp causes them to grow mouldy. They should be looked at two or three times in the first two months, that they may be gently boiled again, if not likely to keep. It is necessary to observe that the boiling of sugar more or less constitutes the chief art of tbe confectioner; and those who are not practised in this knowledge, and only preserve in a plain way for family use, are not aware that in two or three minutes a syrup over the fire will pass from one gradation to another, called by the con- fectioners degrees of boiling, of which there are six, and those subdivided. But I am not versed in the minutiae, and only make the observation to guard against under- boiling, which prevents preserves from keeping; and quiek boiling, and long, which brings them to candy. Attention, without much practice, will enable a person to do any of the following sorts of preserves, &c., and they are as much as is wanted in a private family; the higlier articles of preserved fruits may be bought at less expense than made. Jellies of fruit made with equal quantity of sugar, that is, a pound to a pint, require no very long boiling. A pan should be kept for the purpose of preserving; of double bloek-tin, with a bow-handle opposite the straight one for safety, will do very well: and if ])ut by nicely cleaned in a dry place, w'hen done with, will last for several years. Those of eopper or brass are im- proper, as the tinning wears out by the scraping of the sweetmeat-ladle. Tliere is a new sort of iron with a strong tinning, whieh promises to wear long. Sieves and spoons should be kept likewise for sweet things. Preserves keep best in drawers that are not connectedDOMESTIC COOKERY. ^9S with a wall. If there be the least damp, cover them only with paper clipped in brandy, laid cjuite close; putting a little fresh over in spring, to prevent insect mould. Dried sweetmeats, cakes, &c., should be kept in tin boxes, between layers of white paper, in a very dry, but not hot room. When any sweetmeats are directed to be dried in the sun or in a stove, it will be best in private families, where there is not a regular stove for the purpose, to put them in the sun on flag-stones, which reflect the heat, and place a garden glass over them to keep insects off; or if put into an oven, take care not to let it be too warm, and w'atch that they do properly and slowly. All fruits, for preserving, should be gathered in dry weather; but as this is not always practicable, much inconvenience may be obviated by boiling the fruit for jellies and jams long before the sugar is added. By so doing the watery particles will evaporate; and the pre- serve w’ill be better flavoured, by the sugar not being too long on the fire. To green Fruits for 'preserving or pickling. Take pippins, apricots, pears, plums, peaches, wdiile green for the first, or radish-pods, French beans for the latter, and cucumbers for both processes; and put them W'ith vine-leaves under and over, into a block-tin pre- serving-pan wdth spring-water to cover them, and then the tin cover to exclude all air. Set it on the side of a fire, and when they begin to simmer, take them off, pour off the water, and if not green, put fresh leaves when cold, and repeat the same. Take them out carefully with a slice: they are to be peeled, and then done according to the receipts for the several modes. To clarify Sugar for Sweetmeats. Break as much as ]-equired in large lunijis, and put a pound to half a pint of water, in a bowl, and it will dis- solve better than w'hen broken small. Set it over the Are, and the well-wdiipt white of an egg; let it boil up.PRESERVES. 299: and when ready to run over, pour a little cold water in to give it a check; but when it rises a second time, take it off the fire, and set it by in the pan, for a quarter of an hour, during which the foulness will sink to the bot- tom, and leave a black scum on the top, which take off- gently with a skimmer, and pour the syrup into a vessel very quickly from the sediment. To candy any sort of Fruit. When finished in the syrup put a layer into a new sieve, and dip it suddenly into hot water, to take off the syrup that hangs about it; put it on a napkin before the fire to drain, and then do some more in the sieve. Plave ready sifted double-refined sugar, which sift over the fruit on all sides till quite white. Set it on the shallow end of sieves in a lightly warm oven, and turn it two or three times. It must not be cold till dry. Watch it carefully, and it will be beautiful. Z’o keep Currants. The bottles being perfectly clean and dry, let the cur- rants be cut from the large stalks with the smallest bit of stalk to each, that the fruit not being wounded, no moisture may be among them. It is necessary to gather them when the weather is quite dry; and if the servant can he depended upon, it is best to cut them under the trees, and let them drop gently into the bottles. Stop up the bottles with cork and rosin, and put them into the trench in the garden with the neck downwards; sticks should be placed opposite to where each sort of fruit begins. Cherries and Damsons keep in the same way. Currants may be scalded, as directed for gooseberries, the first method. To keep Codlins for several Months. Gather codlins at Midsummer, of a middling size, put them into an earthen pan, and pour boiling water over them, and cover the pan with cabbage-leaves. Keep them by the fire till they >vould peel, but do not peel themDOMESTIC COOKERY, 300 then pour the water off till both are quite cold. Place the codlins then in a stone jar with a smallish mouth, and pour on them the water that scalded them. Cover the pot with bladder wetted, and tied very close, and then over it coarse paper tied again. It is best to keep them in small jars, such as will be used at once when opened. To keep Gooseberries. Before they become too large, let them be gathered, and take care not to cut them in taking off the stalks, and buds. Fill wide-mouthed bottles; put the corks loosely in, and set the bottles up to the neck in M'ater in a boiler. When the fruit looks scalded, take them out; and wlien perfectly cold, cork close, and rosin the top. i)ig a trench in a part of the garden least used, suffi- ciently deep for all the bottles to stand, and let the earth be thrown over, to cover them a foot and a half. When a frost comes on, a little fresh litter from the stable will prevent the ground from hardening, so that the fruit cannot be dug up. Or scald as above; when cold, fill the bottles with cold w'ater, cork them, and keep them in a damp or dry place; they will not be spoiled. Another ivay. In the size and preparation as above; when done, have boiling w^ater ready, either in a boiler or large kettle; and put into it as much roche-alum as will, when dissolved, harden the water, which you will taste by a little roughness ; if there be too much it will spoil the 'fruit. Put as many gooseberries into a large sieve as will lie at the bottom without covering one another. Hold the sieve in the water till the fruit begins to look scalded on the outside: then turn them gently out of the sieve on a cloth on the dresser, cover them with another cloth, and put some more to be scalded, and so on till all be finished. Observe not to put one quantity on another, or they will become too soft. The next day pick out any bad or broken ones, bottle the rest, andPRESERVES. 301 fill up the bottles with the alum-water in which they were scalded, wdiich must be kept in the bottles; for if left in the kettle, or in a glazed pan, it wdll spoil. Stop them close. The water must boil all the time the process is carry- ing on. Gooseberries done this way make as fine tarts as when fresh otf the trees. Another way. In dry weather, pick the gooseberries that are full growm, but not ripe; top and tail them, and put into open-mouthed bottles; gently cork them with new velvet corks; put them in the oven wdien the bread is drawn, and let them stand till shrunk a quarter part; take them out of the oven, and immediately beat the corks in tight, cut off the tops, and rosin down close ; set them in a diy place; and, if well secured from air, they will keep the year round. If gathered in the damp, or the gooseberries’ skins are the least cut in taking oft’ the stalks and buds, they will mould. The hairy sort only must be used for keeping, and do them before the seeds become large. Currants and damsons may be done the same. To keep Damsons for Winter Pies. Put them in small stone jars or wide-mouthed bottles; set them up to their necks in a boiler of cold water, and, lighting a fire under, scald them. Next day, when per- fectly cold, fill \ip with spring water : cover them. Another way. Boil one-third as much sugar as fruit wdth it, over a slow fire, till the juice adheres to the. fruit, and forms a jam. Keep it in small jars in a dry place. If too sweet, mix with it some of the fruit that is done Avithout sugar Another way. Choose steen-pots, if you can get them, which are of equal size top and bottom (they should hold eight or nine pounds), put the fruit in, about a quarter up, thenDOMESTIC cookery. 302 strew in a quarter of the sugar; then another quantity of fruit, and so till all of both are in. The proportion of sugar is to be three pounds to nine pounds of fruit. Set the jars in the oven, and bake the fruit quite through. When cold, put a piece of clean scraped stick into the middle of the jar, and let the upper part stand above the top; then pour melted mutton-suet over the top, full half an inch thick, having previously covered the fruit with white paper. Keep the jars in a cool dry place, and use the suet as a cover; which you will draw up by the stick, minding to leave a little forked branch to it to prevent its slipping out. To keep Grapes as in Switzerland. Fasten packthread lines near the ceiling of a cool but not damp room. Pick the grapes before they are dead ripe; cut out every one that is decayed, but do not let their juice touch those that remain; seal the extremity of the stalk to keep it from drying, and hang the bunches on the packthread. Pears may be kept in the same way. Grapes in Brandy. Take some close bunches, black or white, not over- ripe, and lay them in a jar. Put a good quantity of pounded white sugar-candy upon them, and fill up the jar with brandy. Tie them close down with a bladder, and keep in a dry place. Each grape should be pricked thrice. They make a beautiful middle dish in a winter dessert. To preserve Fruit for Tarts or Family Desserts. Cherries, plums of all sorts, and American apples, gather when ripe, and lay them in small jars that will hold a pound ; strew over each jar six ounces of good loaf-sugar pounded; cover with two bladders each, se- parately tied down ; then set the jars in a large stew-pan of water up to the neck, and let it boil three hours gently. Keep these and all other sorts of ft'uit free from damp.PRESERVES. 303 A beautiful Preserve of Apricots. When ripe, choose the finest apricots; pare them as thin as possible, and weigh them. Lay them in halves on dishes, with the hollow part upwards. Have ready an equal weight of good loaf-sugar finely pounded, and strew it over them; in the mean time break the stones, and blanch the kernels. When the fruit has laid twelve hours, put it, with the sugar and juice, and also the ker- nels, into a preserving pan. Let it simmer very gently till clear \ then take out the pieces of apricots singly as they become so; put them into small pots, and pour the syrup and kernels over them. The scum must be taken off at it rises. Cover with brandy-paper. To preserve Apricots in Jelly. Pare the fruit very thin, and stone it; weigh an equal quantity of sugar in fine powder, and strew over it. Next day boil very gently till they are clear, move them into a bowl, and pour the liquor over. The following day pour the liquor to a quart of codlin-liquor, made by boiling and straining, and a pound of fine sugar : let it boil quickly till it will jelly; put the fruit into it, asid give one boil; skim well, and put into small pots. To preserve Green Apricots. Lay vine or apricot leaves at the bottom of your pan, then fruit, and so alternately till full, the upper layer being thick with leaves; then fill with spring water, and cover down, that no steam may come out. Set the pan at a distance from the fire, that in four or five hours they may be only soft but not cracked. Make a thin syrup of some of the water, and drain the fruit. When both are cold, put the fruit into the pan, and the syrup to it: put the pan at a proper distance from the fire till the apricots green, but on no account boil or crack; rer move them very carefully into a pan with the syrup for two or three days; then pour off as much of it as will be necessary, and boil with more sugar to make a rich syrup, and put a little sliced ginger into it. When cold304 DOMESTIC COOKERY. and the thin syrup has all been drained from the fruit, pour the thick over it. The former will serve to sweeten pies. Apricots or Peaches in Brandy. Wipe, weigh, and pick the fruit, and have ready a quarter of the weight of fine sugar in fine powder. Put the fruit into an ice-pot that shuts very close; throw the sugar over it, and then cover the fruit with brandy. Between the top and cover of the pot, put a piece of double cap-paper. Set the pot into a saucepan of water till the brandy be as hot as you can jiossibly hear to put your finger in, but it must not boil. Put the fruit into a jar, and pour the brandy on it. When cold, put a blad- der over, and tie it down tight. To dry Apricots in half. Pare thin and halve four pounds of apricots, weighing them after; put them in a dish; strew among them three pounds of sugar in the finest powder. When it melts, set the fruit over a stove to do very gently; as each piece becomes tender, take it out, and put it into a China bowl. When all are done, and the boiling heat a little abated, pour the syrup over them. In a day or two remove the syrup, leaving only a little in each half. In a day or two more turn them, and so continue daily- till quite dry, in the sun or a warm place. Keep in boxes with layers of paper. Apricot Jam. Divide fine apricots that have become yellow, but are not over-ripe; lay the hollow part uppermost on China dishes, and strew over twelve ounces of sifted sugar to every pound of fruit. Let it lie until it becomes moist; then boil it twenty minutes, stirring it wfll. Blanch the kernels, and boil with the jam. To preserve Oranges or Lemons in Jelly. Cut a hole in the stalk part, the size of a shilling, and with a blunt small knife scrape out the pulp quite clear.PRESERVES. 305 without cutting the rind. Tie each separately in muslin, and lay them in spring-water two days, changing twice a day : in the last boil them tender on a slow lire. Ob- serve that there is enough at first to allow for wasting, as they must be covered to the last. To every pound of fruit, weigh two pounds of double-refined sugar, and one pint of water; boil the two latter together with the juice of the orange to a syrup, and clarify it, skim well, and let it stand to be cold ; then boil the fruit in the syrup half an hour; if not clear, do this daily till they are done. Pare and core some green pippins, and boil in water till it tastes strong of them; do not break them, only gently press them with the back of a spoon : strain the water through a jelly-bag till quite clear; then to every pint put a pound of double-refined sugar, the peel and juice of a lemon, and boil to a strong syrup. Drain off the syrup from the fruit, and turning each orange with the hole upwards in the jar, pour the apple jelly over it. The bits cut out must go through the same process with the fruit. Cover with brandy-paper. To keep Oranges or Lemons for Puddings, c^'c. When you squeeze the fruit, throw the outside in water, without the pulp; let them remain in the same a fortnight, adding no more; boil them therein till tender, strain it from them, and when they are tolerably dry, throw them into any jar of candy you may have re- maining from old sweetmeats; or if you have none, boil a small quantity of syrup of common loaf-sugar and water, and put over them; in a week or ten days boil them gently in it till they look clear, and that they may be covered with it in the jar. You may cut each half of the fruit in two, and they will occupy small space. To preserve Citrons. Throw them into water over night; boil until so tender that you can rim a straw through them. Cut them in half: remove the pulp, but do not touch the XDOMESTIC COOKERY. 306 rind; lay them in a china bowl for two or three days, covered with double-refined sugar (a pound to each citron of a moderate size.) Boil the sugar, fruit, and two or three spoonsful of water together for a quarter of an hour. Two days after, pour the syrup off, and boil it with one pound of sugar : skim, and pour it boiling- hot upon the eitrons. If the syrup be not rich enough, the boiling must be repeated. Soak tw'elve races of white ginger in w^ater three days, scrape them well, and boil them in a little thin syrup. When the preserving syrup is boiled the last time, add the ginger to the fruit. When cold, cover with paper and bladder. To ‘preserve Strawberries ivkole. Take equal weights of the fruit and double-refined sugar; lay the former in a large dish, and sprinkle half the sugar in fine powder over; give a gentle shake to the dish, that the sugar may touch the under side of the fruit. Next day make a thin,syrup wdth the remainder of the sugar, and, instead of water, allow one pint, of red currant juice to every pound of strawberries; in this simmer them until sufficiently jellied. Choose the largest scarlets, or others, when not dead ripe. In either of the above ways, they eat well served in thin cream, in glasses. To preserve Strawberries in Wine. Put a quantity of the finest large strawberries into a gooseberry-bottle, and strew in three large spoonsful of fine sugar; fill up with Madeira wine, or tine sherry. To dry Cherries with Sugar. Stone six pounds of Kentish; put them into a pre- serving-pan, with two pounds of loaf-sugar pounded and strewed among them; simmer till they begin to shrivel; then strain them from the juice; lay them on a hot hearth, or in an oven, when either is cool enough to dry without baking them. The same syrup will do another six pounds of fruit. \PRESERVES. 307' To dry Cherries without Sugar. Stone, and set them over the fire in the preserving- pan ; let them simmer in their own liquor, and shake them in the pan. Put them by in china common dishes ; next day give them another scald, and put them, when cold, on sieves, to dry, in an oven of attemperated heat as above. Twice heating, an hour each time, will do them. Put them in a box, with a paper between each layer. 2b dry Cherries the best way. To every five pounds of cherries stoned, weigh one of sugar double-refined. Put the fruit into the preserving- pan, with very little water, make both scalding hot ; take the fruit immediately out and dry them; put them into the pan again, strewing the sugar between each layer of cherries; let it stand to melt; then set the pan on the fire, and make it scalding hot as before; take it off, and repeat this thrice with the sugar. Drain them from the syrup: and lay them singly to dry on dishes, in the sun or on the stove. When dry, put them in a sieve, dip it into a pan of cold water, and draw it in- stantly out again, and pour them on a fine soft cloth ; dry them, and set them once more in the hot sun, or on a stove. Keep them in a box with layers of white paper, in a dry place. This way is the best to give plumpness to the fruit, as well as colour and flavour. Cherries in Brandy. Weigh the finest morellas, having cut off half the stalk; prick them with a new needle, and drop them into a jar or wide-mouthed bottle. Pound three-quarters the weight of sugar or white candy; strew over; fill up with brandy, and tie a bladder over. Rolled Cherries, ivhich taste as if done hi Brandy. To every three pounds of morclla cherries put one pound of double-refined sugar, sifted in layers, in a lar^-e stone jar, or small keg. Stop it perfectly close; andDOMESTIC COOKEHT. 308 roll tlie jar to and fro for a short time every day, for six weeks. Keep them in a cool place. Cherry Jam. To twelve pounds of Kentish or duke cherries, when ripe, weigh one pound of sugar ; break the stones of part, and blanch them; then put them to the fruit and sugar, and boil all gently till the jam comes clear from the pan. Pour it into china plates to come up dry to table. Keep in boxes with white paper between. Currant Jam, black, red, or lohite. Let the fruit be very ripe, pick it clean from the stalks, bruise it, and to every pound put three-quarters of a pound of loaf-sugar ; stir it well, and boil half an hour. Currant Jelly, red or black. Strip the fruit, and in a stone jar stew them in a saucepan of water, or by boiling it on the hot hearth: strain oft’ the liquor, and to every pint weigh a pound of loaf-sugar; put the latter in large lumps into it, in a stone or china vessel, till nearly dissolved ; then put it in a preserving-pan : simmer and skim as necessary. When it will jelly on a plate, put it in small jars or glasses. Currant Jelly or Jam, as made in Scotland. Strip what quantity of fruit you please; pound an equal quantity of lump-sugar, and set both over the fire. When done, pour the whole into a new sieve, and let the liquor run through without pressing. Then boil tliat and the currants separately for fifteen minutes, skim- ming and stirring it well. Apple Marmalade. Scald apples till they will pulp from the core: then take an equal weight of sugar in large luni])s, just dip them in water, and boiling it till it can be well skimmed, and is a thick syrup, put to it the pulp, and simmer it on a quick fire a quarter of an hour. Grate a little le- mon-peel before boiled, but if too much it will be bitter.PRESERVES. 309 Apple Jelly for preserving Fruits. Let apples be pared, quartered, and cored ; ])ut them into a stewpan, with as much water as will cover them; boil as fast as possible ; when the fruit is all in a mash, add a quart of water; boil half an hour more, and run through a jelly-bag. If in summer, codlins are best; in September, golden jennets, or winter-pippins. Red Apples in Jelly. Pare and core some well-shaped apples; pippins or golden rennets, if you have them, but others will do; throw them into water as you do them; put them into a preserving-pan, and with as little water as will only half cover them ; let them coddle, and when the lower side is done, turn them. Observe that they do not lie too close when first put in. Mix some pounded cochineal with the water, and boil with the fruit. When suf- ficiently done, take them out on the dish they are to be served in, the stalk downwards. Take the water, and make a rich jelly of it with loaf-sugar, boiling the thin rind and juice of a lemon. When come to a jelly, let it grow cold, and put it on and among the apples ; cut the peel of the lemon in narrow strips, and put across the eye of the apple. Observe that the colour be fine from the first, or the fruit will not afterwards gain it; and use as little of the cochineal as will serve, lest the syrup taste bitter. Dried Apples. Put them in a cool oven six or seven times, and flatten them by degrees, and gently, when soft enougli to bear it. If the oven be fbo hot, they will waste ; and at first it should be very cool. The biffin, the minshul crab, or any tart apples, are the sorts for drying. To preserve Siberian Crab Apples. Boil a pint of water and a pound and a half of refined310 DOMESTIC COOKERY. sugar to a fine clear syrup; skim it, and let it become cold. Pare the crabs; and to this quantity of syrup put a pound of fruit, and simmer slowly till tender. Carefully remove each apple separately, "and pour the syrup over when a little eooled, and add orange and lemon-peel boiled tender. To preserve Jarganel Pears most beautifully. Pare them very thin, and simmer in a thin svrup; let them lie a day or two. Make the syrup richer, and simmer again ; and repeat this till they are clear; then drain and dry them in the sun or a cool oven a very little time. They may be kejit in s3Yup, and dried as wanted, which makes them more moist and rich. ' Gooseberry Jam for Tarts. Put twelve pounds of the red hairy gooseberries, when ripe and gathered in dry weather, into a preserv- ing-pan, with a pint of currant-juice, drawn as for jelly ; let them boil pretty quick, and beat them wdth the spoon; when they begin to break, put to them six pounds of pure white Lisbon sugar, and simmer slowly to a jam. It requires long boiling, or it will not keep ; but it is an excellent and not expensive thing for tarts or puffs. Look at it in two or three days, and if the syrup and fruit separate, the whole must be boiled longer. Be careful it does not burn to the bottom. Another. Gather young gooseberries (the clear white or green sort) when ripe; top and tail, and weigh them; a pound to three-quarters of a pound of fine sugar, and half a pint of water; boil and skim the sugar and water; then put the fruit, and boil gently till clear: then break, and put into small pots. White Gooseberry Jam. Gather the finest white gooseberries, or green if you choose, when just ripe; top and tail them. To each pound put three-quarters of a pound of fine sugar, and half a pint of w'ater. Boil and clarify the sugar in thePRESERVES. 311 ■water as directed in page 298; then add the fruit; simmer gently till clear, then break it, and in a few minutes put the jam into small pots. Gooseberry Hops. Of the largest green walnut kind, take and cut the hud end in four quarters, leaving the stalk end whole; pick out the seeds, and with a strong needle and thread fasten five or six together, by running the thread through the bottoms, till they are of the size of a hop. Lay vine-leaves at the bottom of a tin preserving-pan, cover them with the hops, then a layer of leaves, and so on ; lay a good many on the top, then fill the pan with water. Stop it so close down that no steam can get out, set it by a slow fire till scalding hot, then take it off till cold, and so do, till, on opening while cold, the gooseberries are of a good green. Then drain them on sieves, and make a thin syrup of a pound of sugar to a pint of water; boil and skim it well : when half cold, put in the fruit; next day give it one boil; do this thrice. If the hops are to be dried, which way they eat best, and look well, they may be set to dry in a Aveek ; but if to be kept wet, make a sjTup in the above proportions, adding a slice of ginger in boiling: when skimmed and clear, give the gooseberries one boil, and when cold, pour it over them. If the first syrup be found too sour, a little sugar may be added and boiled in it, before the hops that are for drying have their last boil. The extra syrup will sei’ve for pies, or go towards other sweetmeats. Raspberry Jam. Weigh equal quantities of fruit and sugar; put the former in a preserving-pan, boil and break it, stir con- stantly, and let it boil very quickly. When most of the juice is wasted, add the sugar, and simmer half an hour. This way the jam is greatly superior in colour and fla- vour to that which is made by putting the sugar in at first. Another way. Put the fruit in a jar in a kettle of water, or on a hotDOMESTIC COOKERY. 312 hearth, till the juice will run from it: then take away a quarter of a pint from even' pound of fruit: boil and bruise it half an hour, then put in the weight of the fruit in sugar, and adding the same quantity of currant-juice, boil it to a strong jelly. The raspberry-juice will serve to put into brandy, or may be boiled Mith its weight in sugar for making the jelly for raspberry-ice, or cream. To preserve Cucumbers. Choose the greenest and most perfect green turk cu- cumbers, and cut them in pieces, and some small ones of the same sort to preserve wliole. Put them in brine in a jar, with a cabbage-leaf or two over them. Then simmer them over the fire in water with a little salt in it. Take out the seeds, and put them into cold water two or three days, to soak out the salt. Make a syrup of a pound of refined sugar and a half-pint of spring- water; boil and skim it: then put in the thin rind of a lemon, and an ounce of white ginger from which the outside has been scraped. When the syrup is tolerably thick, take it off; let it grow cold, and put the cucum- bers, nicely wiped, into it. Boil them up; and repeat the boiling every three days for about a fortnight. To preserve Greengages. Choose the largest when they begin to soften; split them without paring, and stew a part of the sugar which you have previously weighed an equal quantity of. Blanch the kernels with a small sharp knife. Next day pour the syrup from the fruit, and boil it with the other sugar, six or eight minutes, very gently; skim, and add the plums and kernels. Simmer till clear, taking off any scum that rises; put the fruit singly into small pots, and pour the syrup and kernels to it. If you would candy it, do not add the syrup, but observe the directions that will be given for candying fruit: some may be done each way.313 PKESERVES. Damson Cheese. Bake or koil the fruit in a stone jar in a saucepan of Avater, or on a hot hearth. Pour off some of the juice, and to every two pounds of fruit weigh half a pound of sugar. Set the fruit over a fire in a pan, let it boil quickly till it begin to look dry; take out the stones, and add the sugar, stir it well in, and simmer two hours slowly, then boil it quickly half an hour, till the sides of the pan candy; pour the jam then into potting-pans or dishes about an inch thick, so that it may cut firm. If the skins be disliked, then the juice is not to be taken out; but after the first process, the fruit is to be pulped through a very coarse sieve with the juice, and managed as above. The stones are to be cracked, or some of them, and the kernels boiled in the jam. All the juice may be left in, and boiled to evaporate, but do not add the sugar until it has done so. The above looks well in shapes. Mussel-flum Cheese. Weigh six pounds of the fruit, bake it in a stone jar, remove the stones, and take out the kernels, to put in. Pour half the juice on two pounds and a half of good Lisbon ; when melted, and simmered a few minutes, skim it, and add the fruit. Keep it doing very gently till the juice is much evaporated, taking care to stir it constantly lest it burn. Pour it into small moulds, patty-pans, or saucers. The remaining juice may serve to colour cream, or be added to a pie. Biscuits of Fruit. To the pulp of any scalded fruit put an equal weight of sugar sifted, beat it two hours, then put it into little white paper forms, dry in a cool oven, turn the next day, and in two or three days bo.x them. Quince Marmalade. Pare and quarter quinces, weigh an equal quantity of sugar; to four pounds of the latter put a quart of water, boil and skim, and have it ready against four pounds ofnOMESTIC COOKEUy. 314 quinces are tolerably tender by the following mode: lay them in a stone jar, with a tea-cup of water at the bot- tom, and pack them with a little sugar, strewed between ; cover the jar close, and set it on a stove or cool oven, and let them soften till the colour become red; then pour the fruit-syrup and a quart of quince-juice into a preserving-pan, and boil all together till the marmalade be completed, breaking the lumps of fruit with the pre- serving-ladle. I This fruit is so hard, that if it be not done as above, it ' requires a great deal of time. j Stewing quinces in a jar, and then squeezing them • through a cheese-cloth, is the best method of obtaining the juice to add as above; dip the cloth in boiling water first and wring it. To preserve loliole or half Quinces. Into two quarts of boiling w'ater put a quantity of the fairest golden pippins, in slices not very thin, and not pared, but wiped clean. Boil them very quick, close covered, till the water becomes a thick jelly ; then scald the quinces. To every pint of ])ippin-jelly put a pound of the finest sugar; boil it, and skim it clear. Put those ' quinces that are to be done whole into the syrup at I once, and let it boil very fast; and those that are to be in halves by themselves : skim it, and when the fruit is clear, put some of the syrup into a glass to try whether it jellies before taking off the fire. The quantity of quinces is to be a pound to a pound of sugar, and a pound of jelly already boiled with the sugar. Excellent Sweetmeats for Tarts, when Fruit is plentiful. Divide two pounds of apricots when just ripe, and take out and break the stones; put the kernels without their skins to the fruit; add to it three pounds of green- gage plums, and two pounds and a half of lump-sugar; simmer until the fruit be a clear jam. The sugar should be broken in large pieces, and just dipped in water, and added to the fruit over a slow fire. Observe that it does315 PRESERVES. not boil, and skim it well. If the sugar be clarified, it will make the jam better. Put it into small pots, in which all sweetmeats keep best. Aimack. Put into a pan four dozen split plums, two dozen apples, and two dozen pears, pared thin, and cored. Boil them without water. When well blended together, and the stones taken out, stir in three pounds of sugar, and boil them an hour. Put it into shallow pans or soup-plates, and dry in the sun or a cool oven. Magnum Bonum Plums : excellent as a Siveetmeat or in Tarts, though very had to eat raw. Prick them with a needle to prevent bursting, simmer them very gently in a thin syrup, put them in a china bowl, and when cold pour it over. Let them lie three daysthen make a syrup of three pounds of sugar to five of fruit, with no more water than hangs to large lumps of the sugar dipped quickly, and instantly brought out. Boil the plums in this fresh syrup, after draining the first from them. Do them very gently till they are clear, and the sjnup adheres to them. Put them one by one into small pots, and pour the liquor over. Those you may like to dry, keep a little of the syrup for, longer in the pan, and boil it quickly; then give the fruit one warm more, drain, and put them to dry on plates in a cool oven, 'These plums are apt to ferment, if not boiled in two syrups ; the former will sweeten pies, but will have too much acid to keep. You may reserve part of it, and add a little sugar, to do those that are to dry; for they will not require to be so sweet as if kept wet, and will eat very nicely if only boiled as much as those. Do not break them. One parcel may be done after another, and save much sugar. Candied Angelica. While the stalks are tender, cut them in lengths of three or four inches. Cover close, and boil with very316 DOMESTIC COOKERY. little water. Peel them, and boil again till green; then dry them with a cloth. Put a pound of sugar to a pound ■of the stalks in an earthen pan. Let it stand covered two days, and then boil the angelica till clear and green, and put it into a colander to drain. Strew as much pounded sugar over as will adhere to it, and let it dry, but not become hard, in a slack oven. To keep Lemon-juice. Buy the fruit when cheap, keep it in a cool place two or three days: if too unripe to squeeze readily, cut the peel off some, and roll them under your hand to make them part with the juice more readily : others you may leave unpared for grating, when the pulp shall be taken out and dried. Squeeze the juice into a china basin ; then strain it through some muslin which will not permit the least pulp to pass. Have ready half and quarter ounce phials, perfectly dry ; fill them with the juice so near the top as only to admit half a spoonful of sweet oil into each ; or a little more, if for larger bottles. Cork the bottles, and set them upright in a cool place. When you want lemon-juice, open such a sized bottle as you shall use in two or three days ; wind some clean cotton round a skewer, and dipping it in, the oil will be attracted; and when all shall be removed, the juice will be as fine as when first bottled. Hang the peels up to dry, then keep them from the dust. CHEESE, ANCHOVY TOAST, EGGS, &C. Stewed Cheese. Grate two ounces of cheese, put it into a basin, and mix with it a small tea-cup of cream, and an egg beaten and strained. Put into a small saucepan an ounce of butter, or less if the cheese be very fat; let it melt; then stir in the other ingredients, and boil until well incorpo- rated. Serve hot, either a little browned or not. Potted Cheese. Scrape and pound four ounces of Cheshire cheese with317 CHEESE. one ounce and a half of fine butter, a tea-spoonful of white sugar, a small bit of pounded mace, and a glass of white wine. Press it into a potting-pot. Des Fondis. Boil half a pint of milk, one ounce of butter, and a little bit of salt; then by degrees mix the liquor with a spoonful of flour, and stir it over the fire five minutes. Take it oft’, and mix it with half a pound of grated cheese, the yolks of eight eggs and whites of two, well beaten. When perfectly incorporated, add to it half a pint of cream, and the whites of six eggs, beaten to a froth. The batter should be as thick as cream. Make little paper trays, fill them three parts, and bake them in a very slow oven eighteen minutes. Fondue. Grate four ounces of Parmesan cheese, beat it in a mortar to a paste; then add a piece of butter, and beat it well: stir in the yolks of six eggs and a gill of cream. When the whole is perfectly mixed, add slowly the whites of the above eggs beaten till the moment of mixing, and four ounces of fine sifted sugar. The dish into which it is put should be of silver or block tin; ami be very deep, to allow for rising. Stir the mixture a few minutes after it is put into the oven. Roast Cheese, to come up after Dinner. Grate three ounces of fat Cheshire cheese, mix it with the yolks of two eggs, four ounces of grated bread, and three ounces of butter; beat the whole well in a mortar, with a dessert-spoonful of mustard, and a little salt and pepper. Toast some bread, cut it into proper pieces, lay the paste as above thick upon them, put them into a Dutch oven covered with a dish, till hot through, remove the dish, and let the cheese brown a little. Serve as hoL as possible. Welsh Rabbit. Toast a slice of bread on both sides, and butter it; toast a slice of Gloucester cheese on one side, and layDOMESTIC COOKERY. 318 that next the bread, and toast the other with a salaman- der: rub mustard over, and serve very hot, and covered. Cheese Toast. Mix some fine butter, made mustard, and salt into a mass; spread it on fresh-made thin toasts, and grate or scrape Gloucester cheese upon them. Anchovy Toast. Bone and skin six or eight anchovies; pound them to a mass with an ounce of fine butter till the colour is equal, and then spread it on toast or rusks. Another way. Cut thin slices of bread into any form, and fry them in clarified butter. Wash three anchovies split, pound them in a mortar with some fresh butter, rub them through a hair sieve, and spread on the toast when cold. Then quarter and wash some anchovies, and lay them on the toast. Garnish with parsley or pickles. To poach Eggs. Set a stewpan of water on the fire; when boiling, slip an egg, previously broken into a cup, into the water; when tlie white looks done enough, slide an egg slice under the egg, and lay it on toast and butter, or spinach. As soon as enough are done, serve hot. If not fresh laid, they will not poach well, and without breaking. Trim the ragged parts of the whites, and make them look round. Buttered Eggs. Beat four or five eggs, yolk and white together, put a quarter of a pound of butter in a basin, and then ])ut that in boiling water; stir it till melted, then pour that butter and the eggs into a saucepan; keep a basin in your hand, just hold the saucepan in the other over a slow part of the fire, shaking it one way, as it begins to warm; pour it into a basin and back, then hold it again over the fire, stirring it constantly in the saucepan, and319' CAKES. pouring it into the basin, more perfectly to mix the egg and butter, till they shall be hot without boiling. Serve on toasted bread; or in a basin, to eat with salt fish or red herrings. Scotch Eggs. Boil hard five pullets’ eggs, and without removing the white, cover completely with a fine relishing forcemeat, in wliich let scraped ham, or chopped anchovy, bear a due proportion. Fry of a beautiful yellow brown, and serve with a good gravy in the disli. Cold Butter Mav be served in various forms:—Sent up in small pats; —rolled in the form of a pine, making the roughness with the handle of a silver spoon;—done in crimping rollers, and curled ;—worked through a colander;—or scooped in shell-forms with the bowl of a tea-spoon. It may be served iir the centre or round grated beef or grated tongue ; or with anchovies, and garnished with curled parsley; or with alternate radishes, &c. PART X. CAKES, BREAD, &c. Observations on malung and baking Cakes. Currants should be very nicely washed, dried in a cloth, and then set before the fire. If damp, they will make cakes or puddings heavy. Before they are added, a dust of dry flour should be thrown among them, and a shake given to them, which causes the thing that they are put to to be lighter. Eggs should be very long beaten, whites and yolks apart, and always strained. Sugar should be rubbed to a powder on a clean board, and sifted through a very fine hair or lawm sieve. Lemon-peel should be ])ared very thin, and with a little sugar beaten in a marble mortar, to a paste; andDOMESTIC COOKERY. 320 then mixed with a little wine, or cream, so as to divide easily among the other ingredients. After all the articles are put into the pan, they should he thoroughly and long beaten, as the lightness of the cake depends much on their being well incorporated. Whether black or white plum-cakes, they require less butter and eggs for having yeast, and eat equally light and rich. If the leaven be only of flour, milk and water, and yeast, it becomes more tough, and is less easily di- vided, than if the butter be first put with those ingre- dients, and the dough afterwards set to rise by the fire. The heat of the oven is of great importance for cakes, especially those that are large. If not pretty quick, the hatter will not rise. Should you fear its catching, by being too quick, put some paper over the cake to pre- vent its being burnt. If not long enough lighted to have a body of heat, or it is become slack, the cake will be heavy. To know when it is soaked, take a hroad-bladed knife that is very bright, and plunge it into the very centre; draw it instantly out, and if the least stickiness adheres, put the cake immediately in, and shut up the oven. If the heat was sufficient to raise, but not to soak, I have, with great success, had fresh fuel quickly put in, and kept the cakes hot until the oven was fit to finish the soaking, and they turned out extremely well. But those who are emplo}'ed ought to be particularly careful that no mistake occurs from negligence when large cakes are to be baked. Bread and cakes -wetted with milk eat best when new; but become stale sooner than others. Cakes kept in drawers or wooden boxes have a dis- agreeable taste. Earthen pans and covers, or tin boxes, preserve them best. CAKES, &c. Iceing for Cakes. Eor a large one, beat and sift eight ounces of fine sugar put into a mortar, with four spoonsful of rose-.CAKES. 321 water, and the whites of two eggs beaten and strained; whisk it well, and when the cake is almost cold, dip a feather in the iceing and cover the cake well; set it in the oven to harden, but do not let it stay to discolour. Put the cake in a dry place. To ice a very large Cake. Beat the whites of twenty fresh eggs; then by degrees heat a pound of double-refined sugar sifted through a lawn sieve ; mix these w'ell in a deep earthen jjan ; add orange-flower water, and a piece of fresh lemon-peel; of the former enougli to flavour, and no more. Whisk it for three hours till the mixture is thick and white ; then with a thin broad bit of board spread it all over the top and sides, and set it in a cool oven, and an hour will harden it. A commo?i Cake. Mix three-quarters of a pound of flour with half a jioimd of butter, four ounces of sugar, four eggs, half an ounce of caraways, and a glass of raisin-wine. Beat it w'ell, and bake in a quick oven. Fine Lisbon sugar w'ill do. A very good common Cake. Rub eight ounces of butter in two pounds of dried flour; mix it with three spoonsful of yest, that is not bitter, to a paste. Let it rise an hour and a half; then mix in the yolks and whites of four eggs beaten apart, one pound of sugar, some milk to make it a proper thickness (about a pint will be sufficient), a glass of sweet-wine, the rind of a lemon, and a tea-spoonful of ginger. Add either a pound of currants, or some cara- ways, and beat well. An excellent Cake. Rub two pounds of dry fine flower, with one of butter washed in plain and rose w'ater; mix it with three spoonsful of yest in a little warm milk and water. Set it to rise an hour and a half before the fire; then beat into it two pounds of currants, one pound of sugar sifted, four ounces of almonds, six ounces of stojied raisins, Y322 DOMESTIC COOKERY. clioppetl fine, half a nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice and a few cloves, the peel of a lemon chopped as fine as pos- sible, a glass of wine, ditto of brandy, twelve yolks and whites of eggs beat separately and long, orange, citron, and lemon. Beat exceedingly well, and butter the pan. A quick oven. A very fine Cake. Wash two pounds and a half of fresh butter in water first, and then in rose-water, beat the butter to a cream; beat twenty eggs, yolks and whites separately, half an hour each. Have ready two pounds and a half of the finest flour, well dried, and kept hot, likewise a pound and a half of sugar, pounded and sifted, one ounce of spice in finest powder, three pounds of currants nicely cleaned and dry, half a pound of almonds blanched, and three-quarters of a pound of sweetmeats cut not too thin. Let all be kept by the fire, mix all the dry ingre- dients; pour the eggs strained to the butter; mix half a pint of sweet wine with a large glass of brand)", pour it to the butter and eggs, mix well, then have all the dry things put in by degrees; beat them very thoroughly; you can hardly do it too much. Plaving half a pound of stoned jar-raisins chopped as fine as possible, mix them carefully, so that there should be no lumps, and add a tea-cupful of orange-flower water. Beat the ingre- dients together a full hour at least. Have a hoop w^ell buttered, or if you have none, a tin or copper cake-pan; take a white paper, doubled and buttered, and put in the pan round the edge : if the cake batter, fill it more than three parts, for space should be allowed for rising. Bake in a quick oven. It will require three hours. Rout Drop-Cakes. Mix two pounds of flour, one ditto butter, one ditto sugar, one ditto currants, clean and dry; then wet into a stiff paste, with two eggs, a large spoonful of orange- flower water, ditto rose-water, ditto sweet wine, ditto brandy, drop on a tin plate floured: a very short time .bakes them.CAKES. 323 Flat Cakes, that will keep long in the house good. Mix two pounds of flour, one pound of sugar, and one ounce of caraways, w'ith four or five eggs, and a few spoonsful of water, to make a stiff paste; roll it thin, and cut it into any shape. Bake on tins lightly floured. While baking, boil a pound of sugar in a pint of water to a tbin syrup ; while both are hot, dip each cake into it, and put them on tins into the oven to dry for a short time; and when the oven is cooler still, return them there again, and let them stay four or five hours. Little white Cakes. Dry half a pound of flour, rub into it a very little pounded sugar, one ounce of butter, one egg, a few ca- raways, and as much milk and water as to make a paste; roll it thin, and cut it with the top of a canister or glass. Bake fifteen minutes on tin plates. Little short Cakes. Rub into a pound of dry flour four ounces of butter, four ounces of white jiowdered sugar, one egg and a spoonful or two of thin cream to make it into a paste. When mixed, put currants into one half, and caraways into the rest. Cut them as before, and bake on tins. Marlborough Cakes. Beat eight eggs and a pound of pounded sugar three quarters of an hour ; then by degrees mix in twelve ounces of fine flower well dried ; add two ounces of ca- raway seeds, and bake in soup plates, or tin pans, in a brisk oven. Plum Cake. Mix thoroughly a quarter of a peck of fine flour, well dried, with a pound of dry and sifted loaf-sugar, three pounds of cinrants washed and very dry, half a pound of raisins stoned and chopped, a quarter of an ounce of mace and cloves, twenty Jamaica pe])pers, a grated nutmeg, the peel of a lemon cut as fine as possible, and ■half a pound of almonds blanched and beaten withDOMESTIC COOKERY. 324 orange-flower water. Melt two pounds of butter in a pint and a quarter of cream, but not hot; put to it n pint of sweet wine, a glass of brandy, the whites and yolks of twelve eggs beaten apart, and half a pint of good yest. Strain this liquid by degrees into the dry ingredients, beating them together a full hour, then butter the hoop, or pan, and bake it. As you put the batter into the hoop, or pan, throw in plenty of citron, lemon, and orange candy. If you ice the cake, take half a pound of double- refined sugar sifted, and put a little with the white of an egg, beat it well, and by degrees pour in the re- mainder. It must be whisked near an hour, with the addition of a little orange-flower water, but mind not to put much. When the cake is done, pour the iceing over, and return it to the oven for fifteen minutes: but if the oven be warm, keep it near the mouth, and the door open, lest the colour be spoiled. Another. Flour dried, and currants washed and iiicked, four pounds; sugar pounded and sifted, one pound and a half; six orange, lemon, and citron peels, cut in shces: mix these. Beat ten eggs, yolks and whites separately : then melt a pound and a lialf of butter and a pint of cream; when lukewarm, put to it half a pint of ale-yest, near half a pint of sweet wine, and the eggs; then strain the liquid to the dry ingredients, beat them well, and add of cloves, mace, cinnamon, and nutmeg, half an ounce each. Butter the pan, and put it into a quick oven. Three hours will bake it. Very good common Plum Cakes. Mix five ounces of butter in three pounds of dry flour, and five ounces of fine Lisbon sugar; add six ounces of currants, washed and dried, and some pimento, finely powdered. Put three spoonsful of yest into a Win- chester pint of new milk warmed, and mix into a lightCAKES. 325 dough with the above. Make it into twelve cakes, and bake on a flour tin half an hour. Little Plum Cakes to keep long. Dry one pound of flour, and mix with six ounces of finely pounded sugar; beat six ounces of butter to a cream, and add to three eggs well beaten, half a pound of currants washed and nicely dried, and the flour and sugar; beat all for some time, then dredge flour on tin plates, and drop the batter on them the size of a walnut. If properly mixed, it will be a stiff paste. Bake in a brisk oven. A good Pound Cake. Beat a pound of butter to a cream, and mix with it the whites and yolks of eight eggs beaten apart. Have ready warm by the fire, a pound of flour, and the same of sifted sugar; mix them and a few cloves, a little nut- meg and cinnamon, in fine powder together; then by degrees work the dry ingredients into the butter and eggs. When well beaten, add a glass of wine and some caraways. It must be beaten a full hour. Butter a pan, and hake it a full hour in a quick oven. The above proportions, leaving out four ounces of the butter, and the same of sugar, make a less luscious cake, and to most tastes a more pleasant one. A cheap Seed Cake. Mix a quarter of a peck of flour with half a pound of sugar, a quarter of an ounce of allspice, and a little ginger; melt three-quarters of a pound of butter with half a pint of milk ; when just warm, put to it a quarter of a pint of yest, and work up to a good dough. Let it stand before the fire a few minutes before it goes to the oven ; add seeds, or currants; bake an hour and a half. Another. Mix a pound and a half of flour, and a pound of com- mon lump-sugar, eight eggs beaten separately, an ounceDOMESTIC COOKERY. 326- of seeds, two spoonsful of yest, and the same of milk and water. Note.—Milk alone causes cake and bread soon to dry. Common Bread Cake. Take the quantity of a quartern loaf from the dough, w’hen making white bread, and knead w^ell into it two ounces of butter, two of Lisbon sugar, and eight of cur- rants. Warm the butter in a tea-cupful of good milk. By the addition of an ounce of butter or sugar, or an egg or two, you may make the cake the better. A tea- cupful of raw cream improves it much. It.is best to. bake it in a pan, rather than as a loaf, the outside being less hard. Queen Cake. Mix a pound of dried flour, the same of sifted sugar, ^nd of washed clean currants. Wash a pound of butter in rose-water, beat it well, then mix with it eisht egffs, yolks and whites beaten separately, and put in the dry- ingredients by degrees beat the whole an hour ; butter little tins, tea cups or saucers, and bake the batter in, filling only half. Sift a little fine sugar over just as you put into the oven. Another way. Beat eight ounces of butter, and mix with two well- beaten eggs strained; mix eight ounces of dried flour, and the same of lump-sugar, and the grated rind of a lemon ; then add the whole together, and beat full half an hour with a silver spoon. Butter small pattypans, half fill, and bake tw'enty minutes in a quick oven. Swiss Cake. Blanch and pound six ounces of sweet, and two of bitter almonds, adding by degrees six ounces of lump sugar, and then the yolks of seven and the whites of five fresh eggs, beaten separately, and to the last moment, with a spoonful of rose-water ; when w'ell incorporated, put in the whole of another egg, with a spoonful more of rose-water, and beat the cake ten minutes.CAKES. 327 Bake it in a large tart-disli, well buttered, with an iron plate over, on which place some hot wood embers; but though the heat above must exceed that below, be careful not to make the cake black. Three-quarters of an hour in a moderate oven will be sufficient, and the iron plate must be removed exactly fifteen minutes before taking the dish out of the oven. It is excellent, hot or cold. Swiss Afternoon Cakes. Mix four ounces of fine flour, two ounces of sifted sugar, the grated peel of a lemon, and half a pound of butter, to a paste, with the white of an egg, and a suf- ficient quantity of milk. Roll it thin, cut into biscuits, and brush them over with the yolk of an egg, over which sift fine sugar; bake them on tins. Spanish Cake. Put twelve eggs, cleared of the trails, into a large cho- colate pot, and mill them to a froth. Mix by degrees three-quarters of a pound of double-refined sugar, one pound of flour dried, and half a pound of almonds beaten to a paste w'ith orange-flower water; to which add four spoonsful of rose-water, a glass of mountain-wine, and half an ounce of pounded cinnamon. When all the in- gredients are in the pot, mill them three-quarters of an hour. Butter a pan, and bake in a slow oven. Portugal Cakes. Mix a pound of fine dried flour with the same of sifted loaf-sugar: rub into it a pound of fresh butter till it resembles crumbled bread. Then add two spoonsful of rose-water, twm of white-wine, and ten eggs; whisk it well, and add eight ounces of currants. Butter small tin pans, and half fill. Shrewsbury Cakes. Sift one pound of sugar, some pounded cinnamon, ?ind a nutmeg grated, into three pounds of flour, the finest sort; add a.little rose-water‘to three eggs, well32S DOMESTIC COOKERY. beaten, and mix these with the flour, &c.; then pour into it as much butter melted as will make it a good thickness to roll out. Mould it well, and roll thin, and cut it into such shapes as you like. Tunbridge Cakes. Rub six ounces of butter quite fine into a pound of flour, then mix six ounces of sugar, beat and strain two eggs, and make with the above into a paste. Roll it very thin and cut with the top of a glass; prick them with a fork, and cover with carraways, or wash with the white of an egg, and dust a little white sugar over. Rice Cake. Mix ten ounces of ground rice, three ounces of flour, eight ounces of pounded sugar; then sift by degrees into eight yolks and six whites of eggs, and the peel of a lemon shred so fine that it is quite mashed; mix the whole well in a tin stewpan over a very slow fire with a whisk, then put it immediately into the oven in the same, and bake forty minutes. Another. Beat twelve yolks and six whites of eggs with the peels of two lemons grated. Mix one pound of flour of rice, eight ounces of flour, and one pound of sugar pounded and sifted; then beat it well with the eggs by degrees, for an hour, with a wooden spoon. Butter a pan well, and put it in at the oven-mouth. A gentle oven will bake it in an hour and a half. Water Cakes. Dry three pounds of fine flour, and rub into it one pound of sugar sifted, one pound of butter, and one ounce of caraway-seed. Make it into a paste w ith three- quarters of a pint of boiling new milk, roll very thin, and cut into the size you choose; jmnch full of holes, and bake on tin plates in a cool oven.CAKES. S29 Sponge Cakes. Weigh ten eggs, and their weight in very fine sugar, and that of six in flour; beat the yolks with the floury and the w'hites alone, to a very stiff broth ; then by de- grees mix the wdiites and the flour with the other ingre- dients, and beat them well half an hour. Bake in a quick oven an hour. Another, without Butler. Dry one pound of flour, and one and a quarter of sugar; beat seven eggs, yolks and whites apart; grate a lemon, and, wdth a spoonful of brandy, beat, the whole togretlier wdth vour hand for an hour.

Mix a paste of flour, a little bit of butter, and milk; roll as thin as possible, and bake on a back-stone over the fire, or on a hot hearth. Another sort, as Biscuits. Rub into a pound of flour six ounces of butter, and three large spoonsful of yest, and make into a paste, with a sufficient quantity of new milk; make into biscuits, and prick them with a clean fork. Another sort. Melt six or seven ounces of butter, with a sufficiency of new milk warmed to make seven pounds of flour into astifi’paste; roll thin, and make into biscuits.DOMESTJC COOKERY. 330 A Biscuit Cake. One pound of flour, five eggs, well beaten and strained, eight ounces of sugar, a little rose or orange-flower water; beat the whole thoroughly, and bake one hour. Macaroons, Blanch four ounces of almonds, and pound with four spoonsful of orange-flower water; whisk the whites of four eggs to a froth, then mix it, and a pound of sugar, sifted, with the almonds, to a jjaste; and laying a sheet of wafer-paper on a tin, put it on in different little cakes, the shape of macaroons. Wafers. Dry the flour well which you intend to use, mix a little pounded sugar and finely-pounded mace with it; then make it into a thick batter with cream: butter the wafer-irons; let them be hot: put a tea-spoonful of the batter into them, so bake them carefully, and roll them oft’ the iron with a stick. Crack-nuts. Mix eight ounces of flour, and eight ounces of sugar; melt four ounces of butter, in two spoonsful of raisin wine: then, with four eggs heaten and strained, make into a paste; add caraways, roll out as thin as paper, cut with the top of a glass, w^ash with the white of an egg, and dust sugar over. Cracknels. Mix with a quart of flour half a nutmeg grated, the yolks of four eggs beaten, with four spoonsful of rose- water, into a stiff paste, with cold water; then roll in a pound of butter, and make them into a cracknel-shape; put them into a kettle of boiling water, and boil them till they swim, then take out, and put them into cold water; when hardened, lay them out to dry, and bake them on tiq plates.331' CAKES, ETC. , Krmgles. Beat well the yolks of eight and whites of two eggs, and mix with four ounces of butter just warmed, and with this knead a pound of flour and four ounces of sugar to a paste. Roll into thick biscuits; prick them, and bake on tin plates. A good plain Bun, that may be eaten with or without toasting and butter. Rub four ounces of butter into two pounds of flour, four ounces of sugar, a nutmeg, or not, as you like; a few Jamaica peppers; a dessert-spoonful of caraways; put a spoonful or two of cream into a cup of yest, and as much good milk as wdll make the above into a light paste. Set it to rise by a fire till the oven be ready. They will quickly bake on tins. Richer Buns. Mix one pound and a half of dried flour with half a pound of sugar; melt a pound and two ounces of butter in a little warm water; add six spoonsful of rose-water, and knead the above into a light dough, with half a pint of yest; then mix five ounces of caraway-comfits in, and put some on them. Madeira Buns. Beat eight ounces of butter to a cream, to which add two eggs long beaten. Have ready fourteen ounces of flour, six ounces of lump-sugar sifted, half a nutmeg, a tea-spoonful of sifted ginger, and a large spoonful of caraw'ay seeds, and, after mixing, work them well into the butter; beat it half an hour; then add a large wine- glass of sherry. Bake in tin patty-pans, in a moderately quick oven. Gingerbread. Mix with two pounds of flour half a pound of treacle, three-quarters of an ounce of caraways, one ounce of ginger finely sifted, and eight ounces of butter. Roll the paste into what form you please, and bake332 DOMESTIC COOKERY, on tins, after having worked it very much, and kept it to rise. If you like sweetmeats, add orange candied; it may he added in small bits. Another sort. To three-quarters of a pound of treacle beat one egg strained; mix four ounces of brown sugar, half aiv ounce of ginger sifted; of cloves, mace, allspice, and nutmeg, a quarter of an ounce, beaten as fine as pos- sible ; coriander and caraway seeds, each a quarter of an ounce: melt one pound of butter, and mix with the above; and add as much flour as will knead into a pretty stiff paste; then roll it out, and cut into cakes. Bake on tin plates in a quick oven. A little time will bake them. Of some, drops may be made. A good plain sort. Mix three pounds of flour with half a pound of butter, four ounces of brown sugar, half an ounce of pounded ginger; then make into a paste with one pound and a quarter of treacle warm. A good sort, xoithout butter. Mix two pounds of treacle; of orange, lemon, and citron, and candied ginger, each four ounces, all thinly sliced; one ounce of coriander seeds, one ounce of cara- ways, and one ounce of beaten ginger, in as much flour as will make a soft ]iaste; lay it in cakes on tin plates, and bake it in a quick oven. Keep it dry in a covered earthen vessel, and it will be good for some months. Rusks. Beat seven eggs well, and mix with half a pint of new milk, in which have been melted four ounces of butter; add to it a quarter of a pint of yest, and three ounces of sugar, and put them, by degrees, into as much flour as will make a very light paste, rather like a batter, and let it rise before the fire half an hour; then addBREAD. 333 some TDore flour to make it a little stiffer, but not stiff. Work it well, and divide it into small loaves, or cakes, about five or six inches wide, and flatten them. When baked, and cold, slice them the thickness of rusks, and put them in the oven to brown a little. Note.—The cakes, when first baked, eat deliciously buttered for tea; or, with caraways, to eat cold. To viake lest. Thicken two quarts of water with fine flour, about three spoonsful : boil half an hour, sweeten with near half a pound of brown sugar; when near cold, put into it four spoonsful of fresh yest in a jug, shake it well together, and let it stand one day to ferment near the lire, without being covered. There will be a thin liquor on the top, which must be poured off; shake the remain- der, and cork it up for use. Take always four spoonsful of the old to ferment the next quantity, keeping it always in succession. A half-peck loaf will require about a gill. Another xcaij. Boil one pound of potatoes to a mash ; when half cold, add a cupful of yest, and mix it well. It will be ready for use in two or three hours, and keeps well. Use double the quantity of this to what you do of beer-yest. To take off the bitter of yest, put bran into a sieve, and pour it through, having first mixed a little warm water with it. BREAD. Let flour be kejit four or five weeks before it is begun to bake with. Put half a bushel of good flour into a trough or kneading-tub ; mix with it between four and five quarts of warm water, and a pint and a half of good yest; put it into the flour, and stir it well with your hands till it becomes tough. Let it rise about an hour and twenty minutes, or less if it rises fast; then, beforeDOMESTIC COOKERY. 334 it falls, add four quarts more of warm water, and half a pound of salt; work it well, and cover it with a cloth. Put the fire then into the oven ; and by the time it is warm enough, the dough will be ready. Make the loaves about five pounds each ; sweep out the oven verj' clean and quick, and put in the bread ; shut it up close, and two hours and a half will bake it. In summer the water should be milk-warm, in winter a little more, and in frosty weather as hot as you can well bear your hand in, but not scalding, or the whole will be spoiled. If baked in tins, the crust will be very nice. The oven should be round, not long; the roof from twenty to twenty-four inches high, the mouth small, and the door of iron to shut close. This construction will save firing and time, and bake better than long and high-roofed ovens. Rolls, muffins, or any sort of bread, may be made to taste new when two or three days old, by dipping them uncut into water, and baking afresh or toasting. American Flour Hequires almost twice as much water to make it into bread as is used for English flour, and therefore it is more profitable; for a stone of the American, which weighs fourteen pounds, will make twenty-one pounds and a half of bread; but the best sort of English flour produces only eighteen pounds and a half. The Rev. Mr. Hacjget's Economical Bread. Only the coarse flake bran to be removed from the flour : of this take five pounds, and boil it in rather more than four gallons of water, so that when per- fectly smooth, you may have three gallons and three quarts of bran-water clear. With this knead fifty-six pounds of the flour, adding salt and yest in the same way and proportions as for other bread. When ready to bake, divide it into loaves, and bake them two hours and a half.BREAD. 335 Thus made, flour will imbibe three-quarters more of bran-water than of plain; so that it not only produces a more nutritious substantial food, but makes an increase of one-fifth of the usual quantity of bread, which is a saving of one day’s consumption out of six; and if this was adopted throughout the kingdom, it would make a saving of ten millions sterling a year, when wheat was at the price it stood in the scarcity, reckoning the con- sumption to be two hundred thousand bushels a day. The same quantity of flour, which, kneaded with water, produces sixty-nine pounds eight ounces of bread, will in the above way make eighty-three pounds eight ounces, and gain fourteen pounds. At the ordinary price of flour, four millions w'ould be saved. When ten days old, if put into the oven for twenty minutes, this bread w'ill appear quite new again. Ricc-and- Wheat Bread. ■ Simmer a pound of rice in two quarts of water till it becomes perfectly soft; when it is of a proper warmth, mix it extremely well with four pounds of flour, and yest and salt as for other bread; of yest about four large spoonsful; knead it extremely well; then set it to rise before the fire. Some of the flour should be reserved to make up the loaves. The whole expense, including baking, will not exceed three shillings, for which eight pounds and a half of exceeding good bread will be pro- duced. If the rice should require more water, it must be added, as some rice swells more than o.ther. French Bread. With a quarter of a peck of fine flour mix the yolks of three and whites of two eggs, beaten and strained, a little salt, half a pint of good yest that is not bitter, and as much milk, made a little warm, as will work into a thin light dough. Stir it about, but do not knead it. Have ready three quart wooden dishes, divide the dough among them, set to rise, then turn them out into the oven, which must be quick. Rasp when done.DOMESTIC COOKERY. 336 To discover whether Bread has been adulterated with Whiting or Chalk. Mix it with lemon-juice, or strong vinegar, and if this puts it into a state of fermentation, you may be certain it has a mixture of alkaline particles; and these are sometimes in large quantities in bakers’ bread. To detect Bones, Jalap, Ashes, in Bread. Slice a large loaf very thin, the crumb only : set it over the fire with water, and let it boil gently a long time; take it off, and pour the water into a vessel; let it stand till near cold; then pour it gently out, and in the sedi- ment will be seen the ingredients which have been mixed. The alum will be dissolved in the water, and may be extracted from it. If jalap has been used, it will form a thick film at the top, and the heavy ingredients will sink to the bottom. Excellent Rolls. Warm one ounce of butter in half a pint of milk, put to it a spoonful and a half of yest of small beer, and a little salt. Put two pounds of flour into a pan, and mix in the above. Let it rise an hour; knead it well; make into seven rolls, and bake in a quick oven. If made in cakes three inches thick, sliced and but- tered, they resemble Sally Lunns, as made at Bath. The foregoing receipt, with the addition of a little saffron, boiled in half a tea-cupful of milk, makes them remarkably good. ' French Rolls. Rub an ounce of butter into a pound of flour: mix one egg beaten, a little yest that is not bitter, and as much milk as will make a dough of a middling stiff- ness. Beat it well, but do not knead; let it rise, and bake on tins. Brentford Rolls. Mix with two pounds of flour a little salt, two ounces of sifted sugar, four ounces of butter, and two eggsBREAD. 337 beaten with two spoonsful of yest, and about a pint of milk. Knead the dough w'ell, and set it to rise before the fire. Make twelve rolls, butter tin plates, and set them before the fire to rise, till they become of a proper size; then bake half an hour. Potato Rolls. Boil three pounds of potatoes, bruise and work them with two ounces of butter, and as much milk as will make them ]>ass through a colander. Take half or three- quarters of a pint of yest, and half a pint of warm water, mix with the potatoes, then pour the whole upon five pounds of flour, and add some salt. Knead it well: if not of a proper consistence, put a little more milk and water warm; let it stand before the fire an hour to rise ; w'ork it well, and make into rolls. Bake about half an hour in an oven not quite so hot as for bread. They eat w^ell toasted and buttered. Dluffins. Mix tw’o pounds of flour with two eggs, two ounces of butter melted in a pint of milk, and four or five spoonsful of yest; beat it thoroughly, and set it to rise two or three hours. Bake on a hot earth, in flat cakes. AVhen done on one side, turn them. Note.—Muffins, rolls, or bread, if stale, may be made to taste new, by dipping in cold water, and toasting, or heating in an oven, or Dutch oven, till the outside be crisp. Yorkshire Cakes. Take two pounds of flour, and mix with it four ounces of butter melted in a pint of good milk, three spoonsful of yest, and tw'o eggs; beat all well together, and let it rise ; then knead it, and make into cakes: let them rise on tins before you bake, which do in a slow oven. Another sort is made as above, leaving out the butter. The first sort is shorter, the last lighter. Hard Biscuits. Warm two ounces of butter in as much skimmed zDOMESTIC COOKERY. 338 milk as will make a pound of flour into a very stiff paste, beat it with a rolling-pin, and work it very smooth. Roll it thin, and cut it into round biscuits ; prick them full of holes with a fork. About six minutes will bake them. Plain and very Crisp Biscuits. Make a pound of flour, the yolk of an egg, and some milk, into a very stitf paste; beat it well, and knead till quite smooth: roll very thin, and cut into biscuits. Bake them in a slow oven till quite dry and crisp. Oliver’s Biscuits. Mix a large spoonful of yest in two spoonsful of new milk put into a pound and a half of flour, and let it rise half an hour. Melt two ounces of butter and half an ounce of wliite sugar in as much milk as shall make the flour into a dough. Roll it out thin, cut into biscuits, prick it Avell, and bake in a middling hot oven. PART XI. HOME-BREWERY, WINES, &c. To brew very fine Welsh Ale. Pour forty-two gallons of water hot, but not quite boil- ing, on eight bushels of malt; cover and let it stand three hours. In the mean time infuse four pounds of hops in a little hot water, and put the WcTter and hops into the tub, and run the wort upon them, and boil them together three hours. Strain off the hops, and keep for the small beer. Let the wort stand in a high tub till cool enough to receive the yest, of which put two quarts of ale, or, if you cannot get it, of small-beer yest. Mix it thoroughly and often. When the wort has done working, the second or third day, the yest will ratlrer sink than rise in the middle: remove it then, and tun■HOME-BREWERY. 339 file ale; as it works out pour a quart in at a time, and gently, to prevent the fermentation from continuing too long, which weakens the liquor. Put a bit of paper over the bunghole two or three days before stopping up. Strong Beer or Ale. Twelve bushels of malt to the hogshead for beer (or fourteen if you wish it of a very good body), eight for ale; for either, pour the whole quantity of water hot, but not boiling, on at once, and let it infuse three hours close covered ; mash it in the first half hour, and let it stand the remainder of the time. Run it on the hops previously infused in water; for strong beer, three- quarters of a pound to a bushel; if for ale, half a pound. Boil them with the wort two hours from the time at begins to boil. Cool a pailful to add two quarts of yest to, which will prepare it for putting to the rest when ready next day; but if possible put together the same night. Tun as usual. Cover the bunghole with paper when the beer has done working ; and when it is to be stopped, have ready a pound and a half of hops dried before the fire, put them into the bunghole, and fasten it up. Let it stand twelve months in casks, and twelve in bottles, before it be drunk. It will keep, and be very fine, eight or ten years. It should be brewed the begin- ning of March. Great care must be taken that the bottles are perfectly prepared, and that the corks are of the best sort. The ale will be ready in three or four months ; and, if the vent-peg be never removed, it will have spirit and strength to the very last. Allow two gallons of w'ater at first for waste. After the beer or ale is run from the grains, pour a hogshead and a half for the twelve bushels, and a hogs- head of water if eight were brewed ; mash, and let stand, and then boil, &c. Use some of the hops for this table- beer that were boiled for the strona;. When thunder or hot weather causes beer to turn sour.340 DOMESTIC COOKERY. a tea-spoonful, or more, if required, of salt of wormwood put into the jug will rectify it. Let it be drawn just before it is drunk, or it will taste flat. Excellent Table Beer. On three bushels of malt pour of hot water the third of the quantity you are to use, which is to be thirty-nine gallons : cover it warm half an hour, then mash, and let it stand two hours and a half more, then set it to drain. When dry, add half the remaining water, mash, and let it stand half an hour, run that into another tub, and pour the rest of the water on the malt, stir it well, and cover it, letting it infuse a full hour. Run that off, and mi.x all together. A pound and a half of hops should be infused in water, as in the former receipt, and be put into the tub for the first running. Boil the hops with the wort an hour from the time it first boils. Strain off and cool. If the whole be not cool enough that day to add to the yest, a pail or two of wort may be prepared, and a quart of yest put to it over night. Before tunning, all the wort should be added together, and thoroughly mixed with the ladepail. When the wort ceases to work, put a bit of paper on the- bunghole for three days, when it may safely be fastened close. In three or four weeks the beer will be fit for drinking. Note.—Servants should be directed to put a cork into every barrel as soon as the cock is taken out, and to fasten in the vent-peg, the air causing casks to become musty. To refine Beer, Ale, Wine, or Cyder. Put two ounces of isinglass-shavings to soak in a quart of the liquor that you want to clear, beat it with a whisk every day till dissolved. Draw off^ a third part of the cask, and mix the above with it; likewise a quarter of an ounce of pearl-ashes, one ounce of salt of tartar calcined, and one ounce of burnt alum powdered. Stir it well, then return the liquor into the cask, and stir itWINES. 341 •with a clean stick. Stop it up, and in a few days it will be fine. Extract of Malt for Coughs. Over half a bushel of pale ground malt pour as much hot (not boiling) water as will just cover it. In forty- eight hours, drain olf the liquor entirely, but without squeezing the grains; put the former into a large sweet- taeat pan, or saucepan, that there may he room to boil as quick as possible, without boiling over; w'hen it be- gins to thicken, stir constantly. It must be as thick as treacle. A dessert-spoonful thrice a day. To preserve Yest. When you have plenty of yest, begin to save it in the following manner : whisk it until it becomes thin, then take a new large wooden dish, w'ash it very nicely, and when quite dry lay a layer of yest over the inside with a soft brush; let it dry, then put another layer in the same manner, and so do until you have a sufficient quantity, observing that each coat dry thoroughly before another be added. It may be put on tw’o or three inches thick, and will keep several months ; when to be used, cut a piece out; stir it in warm water. If to be used for brewing, keep it by dipping large handsful of birch tied together; and when dry repeat the dipping once. You may thus do as many as you please; but take care that no dust comes to them, or the vessel in which it has been prepared. When the W'ort is set to wmrk, throw into it one of these bunches, and it will do as well as with fresh yest; but if mixed with a small quantity first, and then added to the whole, it will work sooner. Remarks on English Wines. English wines would be found particularly useful, now foreign are so high priced ; and they may be made at a <juarter of the expense. If carefully made, and kept three or four years, a proportionable strength being given.DOMESTIC COOKERY. 342 they would answer the purpose of foreign wines for health, and cause a very considerable reduction in the expenditure. A rich and pleasant Wine. Take new cyder from the press, mix it with as much honey as will support an egg, boil gently fifteen minutes, but not in an iron, brass, or copper pot. Skim it well: when cool, let it be tunned, but do not quite fill. In March following bottle it, and it will be fit to drink in six weeks, but will be less sweet if kept longer in the cask. You will have a rich and strong wine, and it will keep well. This will serve for any culinary purjmses which sack or sweet wine is directed for. Honey is a fine ingredient to assist, and render pa- latable, new crabbed austere cyder. Raspberry Wine. To every quart of well-picked raspberries put a quart of water; bruise, and let them stand two days ; strain otf the liquor, and to every gallon put three pounds of lump-sugar; when dissolved, put the liquor in a barrel, and when fine, which will be in about two months, bottle it, and to each bottle put a spoonful of brandy, or a glass of wine. Raspberry or Currant Wine. To every three pints of fruit, carefully cleared from mouldy or bad, put one quart of water; bruise the former. In twenty-four hours strain the liquor, and put to every quart a pound of sugar, of good middling quality of Ifis- bon. If for white currants, use lump-sugar. It is best to put the fruit, &c., in a large pan; and when in three or four days the scum rises, take that off before the liquor he put into the barrel. Those who make from their own gardens may not have sufficiency to fill the barrel at once; the wine will not be hurt if made in the pan, in the above pro- portions, and added as the fruit ripens, and can beI WINES. 343 gathered in dry weather. Keep an account of what is put in each time. Another loay. Put five quarts of currants, and a pint of raspberries, to every two gallons of water; let them soak a night; then squeeze and break them well. Next day rub them well on a fine wire sieve, till all the juice is obtained, washing the skins again with some of the water; then to every gallon put four pounds of very good Lisbon sugar, but not white, Avhich is often adulterated ; tun it immediately, and lay the bung lightly on. Do not use any thing to work it. In two or three days put a bottle of brandy to every four gallons; bung it close, but leave the peg out at top a few days ; keep it three years, and it will be a very fine agreeable wine; four years would make it still better. Black Currant Wine, very fine. To every three quarts of juice, put the same of water unboiled; and to every three quarts of the liquor, add three pounds of very pure moist sugar. Put it into a cask, reserving a little for filling up. Put the cask in a warm dry room, and the liquor will ferment of itself. Skim off the refuse, when the fermentation shall be over, and fill up with the reserved liquor. When it has ceased working, pour three quarts of brandy to forty quarts of wine. Bung it close for nine months, then bottle it, and drain the thick part through a jelly-bag until it be clear, and bottle that. Keep it ten or twelve months. Excellent Ginger Wine. Put into a very nice boiler ten gallons of water, fifteen pounds of lump-sugar, with the whites of six or eight eggs well beaten and strained; mix all well while cold; when the liquor boils, skim it well; put in half a pound of common white ginger bruised, boil it twenty minutes. Have ready the very thin rinds of seven lemons, and pour the liquor on them; when cool, tun it with two spoonsful of yest; put a quart of the liquor to t^yp344 BOMESTIC COOKERY. ounces of isinglass-shavings, -while warm, whish it well three or four times, and pour all together into the barrel. Next day stop it up ; in three weeks bottle, and in three months it wdll be a delicious and refreshing liquor; and though very cool, perfectly safe. Another. Boil nine quarts of water with six pounds of lump- sugar, the rinds of two or three lemons very thinly pared, with two ounces of bruised w’hite ginger, half an hour; skim. Put three-quarters of a pound of raisins into the cask; when the liquor is lukewarm, tun it wdth the juice of two lemons strained, and a spoonful and a half of yest. Stir it dail)'^, then put in half a pint of brandy, and half an ounce of isinglass-shavings : stop it up, and bottle it in six or seven -weeks. Do not put the lemon-peel in the barrel. Excellent Cowslip Wine. To every gallon of water, weigh three pounds of lump- sugar, boil the quantity half an hour, taking off the scum as it rises. When cool enough, put to it a crust of toasted bread dipped in thick yest, let the liquor ferment in the tub thirty-six hours; then into the cask put for every gallon the peel of two and rind of one lemon, and both of one Seville orange, and one gallon of cow-slip- pips, then pour on them the liquor. It must be carefully stirred every day for a week; then to every five gallons put in a bottle of brandy. Let the cask be close stopped, and stand only six weeks before you bottle off. Observe to use the best corks. Elder Wine. To every quart of berries put two quarts of water, hoil half an hour, run the liquor and break the fruit through a hair sieve; then to every quart of juice put three- quarters of a pound of Lisbon sugar, coarse, but not the very coarsest. Boil the whole a quarter of an hour, w-ith some Jamaica peppers, ginger, and a few cloves. Pour -it into a tub, and when of a proper warmth, into theWINES. 345 barrel, with toast and yest to work, which there is more difficulty to make it do than most other liquors. When it ceases to hiss, put a quart of brandy to eight gallons, and stop up. Bottle in the Spring or at Christmas. The liquor must be in a warm place to make it work. White Elder Wine, very much like Frontiniac. Boil eighteen pounds of white powder sugar, with six gallons of water, and two whites of eggs well beaten; then; skim it, and put in a quarter of a peck of elder- flowers from the tree that bears ivhile berries; do not keep them on the lire. When near cold, stir it, and put in six spoonsful of lemon-juice, four or five of yest, and beat well into the liquor; stir it every day; put six pounds of the best raisins, stoned, into the cask, and tun the wine. Stop it close, and bottle in six months. When well kept, this wine will pass for Frontiniac. Clary Wine. Boil fifteen gallons of water, with forty-five pounds of sugar, skim it, when cool put a little to a quarter of a pint of yest, and so by degrees add a little more. In an hour pour the small quantity to the large, pour the liquor on clary-flowers, picked in the dry; the quantity for the above is twelve quarts. Those who gather from their own garden may not have sufficient to put in at once, and may add as they can get them, keeping ac- count of each quart. When it ceases to hiss, and the flowers are all in, stop it up for four months. Rack it off, empty the barrel of the dregs, and adding a gallon of the best brandy, stop it up, and let it stand six or eight weeks, then bottle it. Excellent Raisin Wine. To every gallon of spring water, put eight pounds of fresh Smyrnas in a large tub; stir it thoroughly every day for a month; then press the raisins in a horse-hair bag as dry as possible ; put the liquor into a cask; and when it has done hissing, pour in a bottle of the best346 DOMESTIC COOKERT. ■brandy; stop it close for twelve months ; then rack It off, but without the dregs ; filter them through a bag of flannel of three or four folds; add the clear to the quan- tity, and pour one or two quarts of brandy, according to the size of the vessel. Stop it up, and at the end of three years, you may either bottle it, or drink it from the cask. Raisin wine would be extremely good, if made rich of the fruit, and kept long, which improves the flavom' greatly. Raisin Wine %vith Cyder. Put two hundred weight of Malaga raisins into a cask, and pour upon them a hogshead of good sound cyder that is not rough; stir it well two or three days; stop it, and let it stand six months : then rack into a cask that it will fill, and put in a gallon of the best brandy. If raisin wine be much used, it would answer well to keep a cask always for it, and bottle off one year’s w'ine just in time to make the next, which, allowing the six months of infusion, would make the wine to be eighteen months old. In cyder counties this way is very econo- mical ; and even if not thought strong enough, the addi- tion of another quarter of a hundred of raisins would be sufficient, and the wine w^ould still be verj' cheap. When the raisins are pressed through a horse-hair bag, they will either produce a good spirit by distillation, and must be sent to a chemist who will do it (but if for that purpose they must be very little pressed) : or they will make excellent vinegar, on which article see page 166. The stalks should be picked out for the above, and may be thrown into any cask of vinegar that is making; being very acid. Raisin Wine without Cyder. On four hundredweight of Malagas pour one hogs- head of spring-water, stir well daily for fourteen daj-s, then squeeze the raisins in a horse-hair bag in a press, and tun the liquor; wdien it ceases to hiss, stop it close. In six months rack it off into another cask, or into a■WINES, ETC. 347 tub, aucl after clearing out the sediment, return it into the same, but do not wash it: add a gallon of the best brandy, stop it close, and in six months bottle it. Take care of the pressed fruit, for the uses of which refer to the preceding receipt. Sack Mead. To every gallon of water put four pounds of honey, and boil it three quarters of an hour, taking care to skim it. To every gallon add an ounce of hops; then boil it half an hour, and let it stand till next day: put it into your cask, and to thirteen gallons of the liquor add a quart of brandy. Let it be lightly stopped till the fer- mentation is over, and then stop it very close. If you make a large cask, keep it a year in cask. Cowslip Mead. Put thirty pounds of honey into fifteen gallons of water, and boil till one gallon is wasted : skim it, take it off the fire, and have ready a dozen and a half of lemons quartered ; pour a gallon of the liquor boiling-hot upon them ; put the remainder of the liquor into a tub, with seven pecks of cowslip-pips; let them remain there all night, and then put the liquor and the lemons to eight spoonsful of ncAv yest, and a handful of sweet-brier: stir all well together, and let it work for three or four days. Strain it, and put into the cask: let it stand six months, and then bottle it for keeping. Imperial. Put two ounces of cream of tartar, and the juice and paring of two lemons, into a stone jar: pour on them seven quarts of boiling water, stir and cover close. When cold, sweeten with loaf-sugar, and straining it, bottle and cork it tight. This is a very pleasant liquor, and very wholesome; but from the latter consideration was at one time drunk in such quantities as to become injurious. Add, in bot- tling, half a pint of rum to the whole quantity.DOMESTIC COOKERY. 348 Ratafia. Blanch two ounces of peach and apricot kernels, bruise and put them into a bottle, and fill nearly up with brandy. Dissolve half a pound of white sugar- candy in a cup of cold water, and add to the brandy after it has stood a month on the kernels, and they are strained off; then filter through paper, and bottle for nse. The leaves of peaches and nectarines, when the trees are cut in the spring, being distilled, are an excel- lent substitute for ratafia in puddings. Raspberry Brandy. Pick fine dry fruit, put into a stone jar, and the jar into a kettle of water or on a hot hearth, till the juice will run; strain, and to every pint add half a pound of sugar, give one boil, and skim it; when cold, put equal quantities of juice and brandy, shake well and bottle. Some people prefer it stronger of the brandy. An excellent method of making Punch. Take two large fresh lemons with rough skins, quite ripe, and some large lumps of double-refined sugar. Rub the sugar over the lemons till it has absorbed all the yellow parts of the skins. Then put into the bowl these lumps, and as much more as the juice of the lemons may be supposed to require; for no certain weight can be mentioned, as the acidity of a lemon cannot be known till tried, and therefore this must be determined by the taste. Then squeeze the lemon-juice upon the sugar; and with a bruiser press the sugar and the juice particu- larly well together, for a great deal of the richness and fine flavour of the punch depends on this rubbing and mixing process being thoroughly performed. Then mix this up verij well with boiling water, (soft water is best,) till the whole is rather cool. When this mixture (which is now called the sherbet) is to your taste, take brandy and rum in equal quantities, and put them to it, mixing the whole xcell together again. The quantity of liquor must be according to your taste : two good■WINES, ETC. 34 lemons are generally enough to make four quarts of punch, including a quart of liquor, -with half a pound of sugar; but this depends much on taste, and on the strength of the spirit. As the pulp is disagreeable to some persons, the sher- bet may he strained before the liquor is put in. Some strain the lemon before they put it to the sugar, which is improper; as when the pulp and sugar are w’ell mixed together, it adds much to the richness of the punch. When only rum is used, about half a pint of porter will soften the punch ; and even w'hen both rum and brandy are used, the porter gives a richness, and to some a very pleasant flavour. This receipt has never been in j;rint before, but is greatly admired amongst the writer’s friends. It is im- possible to take too much pains in all the processes of mixing, and in minding to do them extremely leelly that all the different articles may be most thoroughly in- corporated together. Verder, or Milk Punch. Pare si.x oranges, and six lemons, as thin as you can, grate them after with sugar to get the flavour. Steep the peels in a bottle of rum or brandy stopped close twenty-four hours. Squeeze the fruit on two pounds of sugar, add to it four quarts of water, and one of new milk, boiling-hot; stir the rum into the above, and run it through a jelly-bag till perfectly clear. Bottle, and cork close immediately. Norfolk Punch. In twenty quarts of French brandy, put the peels of thirty lemons and thirty oranges, pared so thin that not the least of the white is left. Infuse twelve hours. Have ready thirty quarts of cold water that has boiled; put to it fifteen pounds of double-refined sugar; and, wdien well mixed, pour it upon the brandy and peels, adding the juice of the oranges and of twenty-four lemons; mix well; then strain through a very fine hair sieve, into a very clean barrel that has held spirits, and put tw'oDOIVJESTIC COOKERY. 350 (quarts of new milk. Stir, and tlien bung it close; let it stand six weeks in a warm cellar; bottle the liquor for use, observing great care that the bottles are perfectly clean and dry, and the corks of the best quality, and well put in. This liquor will keep many years and is im- proved by age. Another xoay. Pare six lemons and three Seville oranges very thin, squeeze the juice into a large tea-pot, put to it two quarts of brandy, one of white wine, and one of milk, and one pound and a quarter of sugar. Let it be mixed, and then covered for twenty-four hours ; strain through a jelly-bag till clear, then bottle it. White Currant Shrub. Strip the fruit, and prepare it in a jar as for jelly; strain the juice, of which put two quarts to one gallon of rum, and two pounds of lump-sugar; strain through a jelly-bag. Lemonade to he made a day before loanted. Pare two dozen of tolerably-sized lemons as thin as possible, put eight of the rinds into three quarts of hot, not boiling, water, and cover it over for three or four hours. Rub some fine sugar on the lemons to attract the essence, and put it into a China bowl, into which squeeze the juice of the lemons. To it add one pound and a half of fine sugar, then put the water to the above, and three quarts of milk made boiling-hot; mix, and pour through a jelly bag till perfectly clear. Another icay. Pare, a number of lemons according to the quantity you are likely to want; on the peels pour hot water, but more juice will be necessary than you need use the peels of. While infusing, boil sugar and water to a good syrup with the white of an egg whipt up; when it boils, pour a little cold water into it; set it on again, and when it boils up, take the pan oft’, and set it to settle. If thereDAIRY. is any scum, take it off, and pour it clear from the sedi- ment to the water the peels were infused in, and the lemon-juice; stir and taste it, and add as much more water as shall he necessary to make a very rich lemonade. Wet a jelly-bag, and scpieeze it dry, then strain the li- quor, which is uncommonly fine. Lemonade that has the Jlavour and appearance of Jelly. Pare two Seville oranges and six lemons as thin as possible, and steep them four hours in a quart of hot water. Boil a pound and a quarter of loaf-sugar in three pints of water, and skim it. Add the two liquors to the juice of six China oranges, and twelve lemons; stir the W'hole well, and run it through a jelly-hag till clear. Then add a little orange-water, if you like the flavour, and, if wanted, more sugar. It will keep well if corked. Raspberry Vinegar. Put a pound of fine fruit into a China bowl, and pour upon it a quart of the best white-wine vinegar; next day strain the liquor on a pound of fresh raspberries; and the following day do the same, but do not squeeze the fruit, only drain the liquor as dry as you cau from it. PART XII. DAIRY AND POULTRY. DAIRY. The servants of each country are generally acquainted with the best mode of managing the butter and cheese of that country, but the following hints may not be un- acceptable, to give information to the mistress. On the Management of Coxes, ^c. Cows should he carefully treated; if their teats are sore, they should be soaked in warm water twice a day;DOMESTIC COOKERY. 352 and either be dressed with soft ointment, or done with spirits and water. If the former, great cleanliness is ne- cessary. The milk, at these times, should he given to the pigs. When the milk is brought into the dairy, it should be strained and emptied into clean pans immediately in. winter, but not till cool in summer. White ware is pre- ferable, as the red is porous, and cannot be so thoroughly scalded. The greatest possible attention must be paid to clean- liness ill a dairy; all the utensils, shelves, dressers, and the floor, should be kept with tlie most perfect neatness, and cold water thrown over every part very often. There should be shutters to keep out the sun and the hot air. Meat hung in a dairy will spoil milk. The cows should be milked at a regular and early hour, and the udders emptied, or the quantity will de- crease. The quantity of milk depends on many causes, as the goodness, breed, and health of the cow, the pas- ture, the length of time from calving, the having plenty of clean water in the field she feeds in, &c. A change of pasture will tend to increase it. People who attend properly to the dairy will feed the cows particularly well two or three weeks before they calve, which makes the milk more abundant after. In gentlemen’s dairies more attention is paid to the size and beauty of the cows than to their produce, which dairymen look most to. For making cheese, the cows should calve from Lady- day to May, that the large quantity of milk may come into use about the same time; but in gentlemen’s fami- lies, one or two should calve in August or September, for a supply in winter. In good pastures, the average produce of a dairy is about three gallons a day each cow, from Lady-day to Michaelmas, and from thence to Christmas, one gallon a day. Cows will be profitable' milkers to fourteen or fifteen years of age, if of a proper breed. When a calf is to be reared, it should be taken from the cow in a week at furthest, or it will cause greatDAIRY. 353 trouble in rearing, because it will be difficult to make it take milk in a pan. Take it from the cow in the morn- ing, and keep it without food till the next morning; and then, being hungry, it will drink without difficulty. Skimmed milk and fresh whey, just as warm as new milk, should he given twice a day in such quantity as is required. If milk runs short, smooth gruel mixed with milk will do. At first let the calf he out only by day, and feed it at night and morning. When the family is absent, or there is not a great call for cream, a careful dairy-maid seizes the opportunity to provide for the winter-store; she should have a book to keep an account, or get some one to write down for her the produce of every week, and set down what butter she pots. The weight the pot will hold should be marked on each in making at the pottery. In another part of the book should be stated the poultry reared, and the weekly consumption. Observations respecting Cheese. This well-known article differs according to the pas- ture in which the cows feed. Various modes of prepar- ing may effect a great deal; and it will be bad or good of its kind, by being in unskilful hands, or the contrary; but much will still depend on the former circumstance. The same land rarely makes very fine butter and remark- ably fine cheese; yet due care may give one pretty good, where the other excels in quality. When one is not as fine as the other, attention and change of method may amend the inferior. There is usually, however, too much prejudice in the minds of dairy-people, to make them give up an old custom for one newly recommended. This calls for the eye of the superior. A gentleman has been at the expense of pro- curing cattle from every county noted for good cheese, and it is affirmed that the Cheshire, double Gloucester, North Wiltshire, Chedder, and many other sorts, are so excellent as not to discredit their names. As the cows are all on one estate, it should seem that the mode of 2 ADOMESTIC COOKERY. 354 making must be a principal cause of the difference in flavour; besides, there is much in the size and manner of keeping. Cheese made on the same ground, of new, skimmed, or mixed milk, will differ greatly, not in richness onl}', but also in taste. Those who direct a dairy in a gentle- man’s family should consider in which way it can be managed to the best advantage. Even with few cows, cheese of value may be made from a tolerable pasture, by taking the whole of two meals of milk, and propor- tioning the thickness of the vat to the quantity, rather than having a wide and flat one, as the former will be most mellow. The addition of a pound of fresh-made butter, of a good quality, will cause the cheese made on poor land to be of a very different quality from that usually produced by it. A few cheeses thus made, when the weather is not extremely hot, and when the cows are in full feed, will be very advantageous for the use of the parlour. Cheese for common family use will be very well produced by two meals of skim, and one of new milk ; or, in good land, by the skim-milk only. Butter likewise should be made, and potted down for winter-use, but not to interfere with the cheese, as above, which will not take much time. To jjrepare Rennet to turn the Milk. Take out the stomach of a calf as soon as killed, and scour it inside and out with salt, after it is cleared of the curd always found in it. Let it drain a few hours; then sew it up with two good handsful of salt in it, or stretch it on a stick well salted; or keep it in the salt wet, and soak a bit, which will do over and over by fresh water. Another way. Clean the maw as above; next day take two quarts of fresh spring w'ater, and put into it a handful of haw- thorn-tops, a handful of sweet-brier, a handful of rose- leaves, a stick of cinnamon, forty cloves, four blades of mace, a sprig of knotted marjoram, and twm large spoons- ful of salt. Let them boil gently to three pints of water;355 DAIRY. strain it off; and when only milk-w'arm, pour it on the veil (that is, the maw). Slice a lemon into it; let it stand two days; strain it again, and bottle it for use. It will keep good at least twelve months, and has a very fine flavour. You may add any sweet aromatic herbs to the above. It must he pretty salt, but not brine. A little Avill do for turning. Salt the veil again for a week or two, and dry it stretched on sticks crossed, and it will be nearly as strong as ever. Do not keep it in a hot place when dry. To make Cheese. Put the milk into a large tub, warming a part till it is 'of a degree of heat quite equal to new; if too hot, the cheese will be tough. Put in as much rennet as will turn it, and cover it over. Let it stand till completely turned; then strike the curd down several times with the skimming-dish, and let it separate, still covering it. There are two modes of breaking the curd ; and there will be a difference in the taste of the cheese, according as either is observed; one is, to gather it with the hands very gently towards the side of the tub, letting the whey pass through the fingers till it is cleared, and lading it off as it collects. The other is, to get the whey from it by early breaking the curd; the last method deprives it of many of its oily particles, and is therefore less proper. Put the vat on a ladder over the tub, and fill it with curd by the skimmer: press the curd close with your hand, and add more as it sinks; and it must be finally left two inches above the edge. Before the vat is filled, the clieese-cloth must be laid at the bottom; and when full, drawn smooth over on all sides. There are two modes of salting cheese; one by mixing it in the curd while in the tub after the whey is out; and the other by putting it in the vat, and crumbling the curd all to pieces with it, after the first squeezing with the hands has dried it. The first method appears best on some accounts, but not on all, and therefore the custom of the country must direct. Put a board under 2 A 2DOMESTIC COOKERY. 356 and over the vat, and place it in the press: in two hours turn it out, and put a fresh cheese-cloth; press it again for eight or nine hours; then salt it all over, and turn it again in the vat, and let it stand in the press fourteen or sixteen hours ; observing to put the cheeses last made undermost. Before putting them the last time into the vat, pare the edges if they do not look smooth. The vat should have holes at the sides and at bottom to let all the whey pass through. Put on clean boards, and change and scald them. To preserve Cheese sound. Wash in warm whey, when you have any, and wipe it once a month, and keep it on a rack. If you want to ripen it, a damp cellar will bring it forward. When a whole cheese is cut, the larger quantity should be spread w'ith butter inside, and the outside Aviped, to presen’e it. To keep those in daily use moist, let a clean cloth be wrung out from cold water, and wrap round them Avhen carried from table. Dry cheese may be used to advan- tage to grate for serving with macaroni or eating with- out. These observations are made ■with a vie'w to make the above articles less expensive, as in most families where much is used there is Avaste. To make Sage Cheese. Bruise the tops of young red sage in a mortar, with some leaves of spinach, and squeeze the juice; mix it with the rennet in the milk, more or less according as you like for colour and taste. When the curd is come, break it gently, and put it in with the skimmer, till it is pressed tw'o inches above the vat. Press it eight or ten hours. Salt it, and turn every day. Cream Cheese. I Put five quarts of strippings, that is, the last of the > milk, into a pan, with two spoonsful of rennet. When ' the curd is come, strike it down tw^o or three times with the skimming-dish just to break it. Let it stand two hours, then spread a cheese-cloth on a sieve, put theDAIRY. 35T curd on it, and let the whey drain; break the curd a little with your hand, and put it into a vat with a two- pound weight upon it. Let it stand twelve hours, take it out, and bind a fillet round. Turn every day till dry, from one board to another; cover them with nettles, or clean dock-leaves, and put between two pewter-plates to ripen. If the weather be warm, it will be ready in three weeks. Another. Have ready a kettle of boiling water, put five quarts of new milk into a pan, and five pints of cold water, and five of hot; when of a proper heat, put in as much rennet as will bring it in twenty minutes; likewise a bit of sugar. When come, strike the skimmer three or four times down, and leave it on the curd. In an hour or two lade it into the vat without touching it; put a two- pound weight on it when the whey has run from it, and the vat is full. Another sort. Put as much salt to three pints of raw cream as shall season it; stir it well, and pour it into a sieve in which you have folded a cheese- cloth three or four times, and laid at the bottom. When it hardens, cover it with nettles on a pewter plate. Rush Cream-Cheese. To a quart of fresh cream put a pint of new milk warm enough to make the cream a jiroper warmth, a bit of sugar, and a little rennet. Set near the fire till the curd comes ; fill a vat made in the form of a brick, of wheat-straw or rushes sewed together. Have ready a square of straw or rushes sewed flat, to rest the vat on, and another to cover it; the vat j being open at top and bottom. Next day take it out, I and change it as above to ripen. A half-pound weight I will be sufficient to put on it. Another loarj. Take a pint of very thick sour cream from the top of i358 DOMESTIC COOKERY. the pan for gathering butter, lay a napkin on two plates, and pour half into each; let them stand twelve hours, then put them on a fresh wet napkin in one plate, and cover with the same; this do every twelve hours until you find the cheese begins to look dry, then ripen it with nut- leaves : it will be ready in ten days. Fresh nettles, or two pewter-plates, will ripen cream- cheese very well. Observations respecting Butter. There is no one article of family consumption more in use, of greater variety in goodness, of more conse- quence to have of a superior quality, and the econo- mizing of which is more necessary, than this. The sw'eetness of butter is not affected by the cream being turned of which it is made. When cows are in tumips, or eat cabbages, the taste is very disagreeable, and the following ways have been tried with advantage to obviate it:— When the milk is strained into the pans, put to every six gallons one gallon of boiling water. Or dissolve one ounce of nitre in a pint of spring-water, and put a quarter of a ]iint to every fifteen gallons of milk. Or when you churn, keep back a quarter of a pint of the sour cream, and put it into a well-scalded pot, into which you are to gather the next cream; stir that well, and do so with every fresh addition. To make Butter. During summer, skim the milk when the sun has not heated the dairy; at that season it should stand for butter twenty-four hours w'ithout skimming, and forty- eight in winter. Deposit the cream-pot in a very cold cellar, if your dairy is not more so. If you cannot churn daily, change it into scalded fresh pots; but never omit churning twice a week. If possible, put the churn in a thorough air; and if not a barrel one, set it in a tub of water two feet deep, which will give firmness to the butter. When the butter is come, pour oft’ the butter- milk, and put the butter into a fresh-scalded pan, orDAIRY. 359 tubs wbicb have afterwards been in cold water. Pour water on it, and let it lie to acquire some hardness before you work it; then change the water, and beat it with flat boards so perfectly, that not the least taste of the buttermilk remain, and tliat tlie water, which must be often changed shall be quite clear in colour. Then work some salt into it, weigh, and make it into forms; throw them into cold water, in an earthen pan and cover of the queen’s ware. You will then have very nice and cool butter in the hottest weather. It requires more working in hot than in cold weather; but it neither should be left with a particle of buttermilk, or a sour taste, as is sometimes done. To 'preserve Butter. Take two parts of the best common salt, one part good loaf-sugar, and one part saltpetre; beat them well together. To sixteen ounces of butter thoroughly cleansed from the milk, put one ounce of this compo- sition ; work it well, and pot down when become firm and cold. The butter thus preserved is the better for keeping, and should not be used under a month. This article should be kept from the air, and is best in pots of the best glazed eartb, that will hold from ten to fourteen pounds each. To preserve Butter for Winter, the best way. When the butter has been prepared as above directed, take two parts of the best common salt, one part of yood loaf sugar, and one part of saltpetre, beaten and blended well together. Of this composition put one ounce to sixteen ounces of butter, and work it well together in a mass. Press it into the pans after the,butter is become cool; for friction, though it be not touched by the hands, will soften it. The pans should hold ten or twelve pounds each. On the top put some salt; and when that is turned to brine, if not enough to cover the butter en- tirely, add some strong salt and water. It requires only then to be covered from the dust.360 DOMESTIC COOKERY. To manage Cream for Whey Butter. Set the whey one day and night, skim it, and so till you have enough; then boil it, and pour it into a pan or two of cold water. As the cream rises, skim it till no more comes; then churn it. Where new-milk cheese is made daily, whey-butter for common and present use may be made to advantage. To scald Cream, as in the West of England. In winter let the milk stand twenty-four hours, in the summer twelve at least; then put the milk pan on a hot hearth, if you have one; if not, set it in a wide brass kettle of water large enough to receive the pan. 11 must remain on the fire till quite hot, but on no account boil, or there will be a skim instead of cream upon the milk. You will know when done enough, by the undu- lations on the surface looking thick, and having a ring round the pan the size of the bottom. The time required to scald cream depends on the size of the pan and the heat of the fire; the slower the better. Remove the pan into the dairy when done, and skim it next day. In cold weather it may stand thirty-six hours, and never less than two meals. The butter is usually made in Devonshire of cream thus prepared, and if properly, it is very firm. Buttermilk, If made of sweet cream, is a delicious and most -whole- some food. Those who can relish sour buttermilk find it still more light; and it is reckoned more beneficial in consumptive cases. Buttermilk, if not very sour, is also as good as cream to eat -with fruit, if sweetened with white sugar, and mixed with a very little milk. It likewise does equally for cakes and rice-puddings, and of course it is econo- mical to churn before the cream is too stale for anything but to feed pigs. To keep Milk and Cream. In hot weather, when it is difficult to preserve milkDAIRY. 361 from becoming sour, and spoiling the cream, it may be kept perfectly sweet by scalding the new milk very gently without boiling, and setting it by in the earthen dish or pan that it is done in. This method is pursued in Devonshire; and for butter and eating,would equally answer in small quantities for coflee, tea, &c. Cream already skimmed may be kept twenty-four hours if scalded without sugar; and by adding to it as much powdered lump sugar as shall make it pretty sweet, will be good two days, keeping it in a cool place. Syrup of Cream May be preserved, as above, in the proportion of a pound and a quarter of sugar to a pint of perfectly fresh cream; keep it in a cool place for two or three hours; then put it into one or two ounce phials, and cork it close. It will keep good thus for several vyeeks, and will be found very useful in voyages. Gallino Curds and Whey, as in Italy. Take a number of the. rough coats that line the giz- zards of turkeys and fowls; clean them from the pebbles they contain; rub them well with salt, and hang them to dry. This makes a more tender and delicate curd than common rennet. When to be used, break off some bits of the skin, and put on it some boiling water; in eight or nine hours use the liquor as you do other rennet. To choose Butter at Market. Put a knife into the butter, if salt, and smell it when drawn out; if there is anything rancid or unpleasant, it is bad. Being nigde at different times, the layers in casks will vary greatly; and you will not easily come at the goodness but by unhooping the cask, and trying it between the staves. Fresh butter ought to smell like a nosegay, and be of an equal colour all through: if sour in smell, it has not been sufficiently washed; if veiny and open, it is probably mixed with staler or an inferior sort.362 DOMESTIC COOKERY. POULTRY-YARD. Management of Fowls. I n order to have fine fowls, it is necessary to choose a good breed, and have proper cafe taken of them. The Dartford sort is thought highly of; and it is desirable to have a fine large kind, but people differ in their opinion of which is best. The black are very juicy, but do not answer so well for boiling, as their legs partake of their colour. They should be fed as nearly as pos- sible at the same hour and place. Potatoes boiled un- skinned, in a little water, and then cut, and either w'et with skimmed milk or not, form one of the best foods. Turkeys and fowls thrive amazingly on them. The milk must not be sour. The best age for setting a hen is from two to five years; and you should remark which hens make the best breeders, and keep those to laying who are giddy and careless of their young. In justice to the animal creation, however, it must be observed, there are but few instances of bad parents for the time their nursing is necessary. Hens sit twenty days. Convenient places should be provided for their laying, as these will be proper for sitting likewise. If the hen-house is not secured from vermin, the eggs will be sucked and the fowls destroyed. Tliose hens are usually preferred which have tufts of feathers on their heads; those that crow are not looked upon as profitable. Some fine young fowls should be reared every year, to keep up a stock of good breeders; and by this attention, and removing bad layers and careless nurses, you will have a chmice of a good stock. Let tlie hens lay, some time before you set them, which should be done from the end of February to the beginning of May. While hens are laying, feed them well, and sometimes wfith oats. Broods of chickens are hatched all through the sum- mer, but those that come out very late require much care till they have gained some strength.POULTKY'YARD. 363 If the eggs of any other sort are put under a hen with some of her own, observe to add her own as many days after the others as there is a difference in the length of their sitting. A turkey and duck sit thirty days. Choose large clear eggs to put her upon, and such a number as she can properly cover. If very large eggs, there are sometimes two yolks, and of course neither will be pro- ductive. Ten or twelve are quite enough. A hen-house should l)e large and high; and should be frequently cleaned out, or the vermin of fowls will in- crease greatly. But hens mirst not be disturbed while sitting; for, if frightened, they sometimes forsake their nests. Wormwood and rue should be planted plenti- fully about their houses : boil some of the former, and sprinkle it about the floor, which should be of smooth earth, not paved. The windows of the house should be open to the rising sun ; and a hole must be left at the door, to let the smaller fowls go in ; the larger may be let ^n and out by opening the door. There should be a small sliding board to shut down when the fowls are gone to roost, which would prevent the small beasts of prey from committing ravages; and a good strong door and lock may possibly, in some measiue, prevent the depredations of human enemies. When some of the chickens are hatched long before the others, it may be necessary to keep them in a basket of wool till the others come forth. The day after they are hatched give them some crumbs of white bread, and small (or rather cracked) grits soaked in milk. As soon as they have gained a little strength, feed them with curd, cheese-parings cut small, or any soft food, but nothing sour; and give them clean water twice a day. Keep the hen under a pen till the young have strength to follow her about, which will be in two or three weeks ; and be sure to feed her well. The food of fowls goes first into their crop, which softens it, and then passes into the gizzard, which by constant friction macerates it, and this is facilitated by364 DOMESTIC COOKERY. small stones, which are generally found there, and which help to digest the food. If a sitting hen is troubled with vermin, let her be well washed with a decoction of white lupins. The pip in fowls is occasioned by drinking dirty water, or taking filthy food. A white thin scale on the tongue is the symptom. Pull the scale off with your nail, and rub the tongue with some salt, and the complaint will be re- moved. It answers well to pay some boy employed in the farm or stable so much a score for the eggs he brings in. It will be his interest then to save them from being pur- loined, which nobody but one in his situation can pre- vent ; and sixpence or eightpence a score will be buying eggs cheap. To fatten Fowls or Chickens in four or five days. Set rice over the fire with skimmed milk, only as much as will serve one day. Let it boil till the rice is qjiite swelled out; you may add a tea-spoonful or two of sugar, but it will do well without. Feed them three times a day, in common pans, giving them only as much as will quite fill them at once. When you put fresh, let the pans be set in water, that no sourness may be conveyed to the fowls, as that prevents them from fattening. Give them clean water, or the milk of the rice, to drink; but the less wet the latter is when perfectly soaked, the better. By this method the flesh will have a clear whiteness which no other food gives; and when it is considered how far a pound of rice will go, and how much time is saved by this mode, it will be found to be as cheap as barley-meal, or more so. The pen should be daily cleaned, and no food given for sixteen hours before poultry be killed. To choose Eggs at Market., and preserve them. Put the large end of the egg to your tongue; if it feels warm, it is new. In new-laid eggs, there is a small divi-365 rOULTRY-YARD. sion of the skin from the shell, which is filled with air, and is perceptible to the eye at the end. On looking through them against the sun or a candle, if fresh, eggs will be pretty clear. If they shake they are not fresh. Eggs may be bought cheapest when the hens first begin to lay in the spring, before they sit; in Lent and at Easter they become dear. They may be preserv’ed fresh by dipping them in boiling water and instantly taking them out, or by oiling the shell; either of which ways is to prevent tlie air passing through it; or kept on shelves with small holes to receive one in each, and be turned every other day; or close-packed in a keg, and covered with strong lime-water. Feathers. In towns, poultry being usually sold ready-picked, the feathers, which may occasionally come in small quan- tities, are neglected ; but orders shoidd be given to put them into a tub free from damp, and as they dry to change them into paper bags, a few in each; they should hang in a dry kitchen to season ; fresh ones must not be added to those in part dried, or they will oceasion a musty smell, but they should go through the same pro- cess. In a few months they will be fit to add to beds or to make pillows, without the usual mode of drying them in a cool oven, which may be pursued if they are wanted before five or six months. Ducks Generally begin to lay in the month of February. Their eggs should be daily taken away except one, till they seem inclined to sit; then leave them, and see that there are enough. They require no attention while sitting, except to give them food at the time they come out to seek it; and there should be water placed at a moderate distance from them, that their eggs may not be spoiled by their long absence in seeking it. Twelve or thirteen eggs are enough : in an early season it is best to set them under a hen; and then they can be kept fromDOMESTIC COOKERY. 366 water, till they have a little strength to bear it, which in very cold weather they cannot do so well. They should be put under cover, especially in a wet season ; for though water is the natural element of ducks, yet they are apt to be killed by the cramp before they are covered with feathers to defend them. Ducks should be accustomed to feed and rest at one place, which would prevent their straggling too far to lay. Places near the water to lay in are advantageous ; and these might be small wooden houses, with a parti- tion, in the middle, and a door at each end. They eat any thing; and when to be fattened, must have plenty, however coarse, and in three weeks they will be fat. Geese Require little expense, as they chiefly support them- selves on commons or in lanes, where they can get water. The largest are esteemed best, as also are the white and gray. The pied and dark-coloured are not so good. Thirty days are generally the time the goose sits, hut in warm weather she will sometimes hatch sooner. Give them plenty of food, such as scalded bran and light oats; and as soon as the goslings are hatched, keep them housed for eight or ten days, and feed them with barley- meal, bran, curds, &c. For green geese, begin to fatten them at six or seven weeks old, and feed them as above. Stubble geese require no fattening if they have the run of good tields. Turkeys Are very tender when young. As soon as hatched, put three peppercorns down their throats. Great care is necessary to their well-being, because the hen is so careless, that she Avill walk about with one chick, and leave the remainder, or even tread upon and kill them. Turkeys are violent eaters; and must therefore be left to take charge of themselves in general, except one good feed a day. The hen sits twenty-five or thirty days; and the young ones must be kept warm, as the367 POULTRY-YARD. least cold or damp kills them. They must be fed often ; and at a distance from the hen, who will eat every tiling from them. They should have curds, green-cheese parings cut small, and bread and milk with chopped wormwood in it; and their drink milk and water, but not left to be sour. All young fowls are a prey for vermin, therefore they should be kept in a safe place, where none can come : weasels, stoats, ferrets, &c., creep in at very small crevices. Let the hen be under a coop, in a warm place exposed to the sun for the first three or four weeks; and the young should not be sulfered to go out in the dew at morning or evening. Twelve eggs are enough to put under a turkey ; and when she is about to lay, lock her up till she has laid every morning. They usually begin to lay in March and sit in April. Feed them near the hen-house ; and give them a little meat in the evening, to accustom them to roosting there. Fatten them with sodden oats or barley for the first fortnight; and the last fortnight give them as above, and rice swelled with warm milk over the fire, twice a day. The flesh will be beau- tifully white and fine flavoured. The common way is to cram them, but they are so ravenous that it seems un- necessary, if they are not suffered to go far from home, which makes them poor. Pea Fowl. Feed them as you do turkeys. They are so shy that they are seldom found for some days after hatching •, and it is very wrong to pursue them, as many ignorant people do, in the idea of bringing them home ; for it only causes the hen to carry the young ones through dangerous places, and by hurrying she treads upon them. I’he cock kills all the young chickens he can get at, by one blow on the centre of the head with his bill; and he does the same by his own brood before the feathers of the crown come out. Nature therefore impels the hen to keep them out of his way till the feathers rise.368 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Guinea Hens Lay a great number of eggs; and if you can discover the nest, it is best to put them under common hens, which are better nurses. They require great warmth, r^uiet, and careful feeding with rice swelled with milk, or bread soaked in it. Put two peppercorns down their throat when first hatched. Pigeons Bring two young ones at a time ; and breed every month, if w'ell looked after and plentifully fed. They should be kept very clean, and the bottom of the dove- cote be strewed with sand once a month at least. Tares and white peas are their proper food. They should have plenty of fresh water in their house. Starlings and other birds are apt to come among them, and suck the eggs. Vermin are likewise their great enemies, and destroy them. If the breed should be too small, put a few- tame pigeons of the common kind, and of their owm colour, among them. Observe not to have too large a proportion of cock-birds; for they are quarrelsome, and will soon thin the dove-cote. Pigeons are fond of salt, and it keeps them in health. Lay a large heap of clay near the house, and let the salt-brine that may be done with in the family be poured upon it. Bay-salt and cummin-seeds mixed are an universal re- medy for the diseases of pigeons. The backs and breasts are sometimes scabby; in wiiich case, take a quarter of a pound of bay-salt, and as much common salt; a pound of fennel-seed, a pound of dill-seed, as much cummin- seed, and an ounce of assafcetida ; mix all with a little wiieaten flour, and some fine worked clay ; wiien all are well beaten together, put it into two eartlien pots, and bake them in the oven. When cold, put them on the table in the dove-cote; the pigeons will eat it, and thus be cured.369 SICK COOKERY. Rabbits. The wild ones have the finest flavour, unless great care is taken to keep the tame delicately clean. The tame one brings forth every month, and must be allowed to go with the buck as soon as she has kindled. The sweetest hay, oats, beans, sow-thistles, parsley, carrot- tops, cabbage-leaves, and bran, fresh and fresh, should be given to them. If not very well attended, their stench will destroy themselves, and be very unwholesome to all who live near them; but attention will prevent this in- convenience. PART XIII. COOKERY FOR THE SICK, AND FOR THE POOR. SICK COOKERY. General Remarks. The following pages will contain cookery for the sick; it being of more consequence to support those w'hose bad appetite will not allow them to take the necessary nou- rishment, than to stimulate that of persons in health. It may not be unnecessary to advise that a choice be made of the things most likely to agree with the patient; that a change be provided; that some one at least be always ready; that not too much of those be made at once which are not likely to keep, as invalids require variety; and that they should succeed each other in dif- ferent forms and flavours. A clear Broth that will keep lonq. Put the mouse-round of beef, a knuckle-bone of veal, and a few shanks of mutton, into a deep pan, and cover close witli a dish or coarse crust; bake till the beef i& done enough for eating, with only as much water as ■ 2 B370 DOMKSTIC COOKERY. ■will cover it. When cold, cover it close in a cool place. When to be used, give what flavour may be approved. A quick-made Broth. Take a hone or two of a neck or loin of mutton, take off the fat and skin, set it on the fire in a small tin saucepan, that has a cover, with three-quarters of a pint of water, the meat being first beaten, and cut in thin bits j put a bit of thyme and parsley, and, if approved, a slice of onion. Let it boil very quick; skim it nicely; take off the cover, if likely to be too weak; else cover it. Half an hour is sufficient for the whole process. A very supporting Broth against any kind of iceakness. Boil two pounds of loin of mutton, with a very large handful of chervil, in two quarts of w'ater, to one. Take off part of the fat. Any other herbs or roots may be added. Take half a pint three or four times a day. A very nourishing Veal Broth. Put the knuckle of a leg or shoulder of veal, with very little meat to it, an old fowl, and four shank-bones of mutton extremely well soaked and bruised, three blades of mace, ten peppercorns, an onion, and a large bit of bread, and three quarts of water, into a stewpot that covers close, and simmer in the slowest manner after it has boiled up, and been skimmed; or bake it; strain, and take off the fat. Salt as wanted. It will require four hours. Broth of Beef Mutton, and Veal. Put two pounds of lean beef, one pound of scrag of veal, one pound of scrag of mutton, s\veet herbs, and ten peppercorns, into a nice tin saucepan, with five quarts of water; simmer to three quarts, and clear from the fat when cold. Add one onion, if approved. Soup and broth made of different meats are more sup- porting, as well as better flavoured. To remove the fat, take it off when cold as clean as 7 «SICK COOKERY. 371- possible : and if there he still any remaining, lay a hit of clean blotting or cap paper on the broth when in the basin, and it will take up every particle. Calfs-feet Broth. Boil two feet in three quarts of water, to half; strain and set it by; when to be used, take off the fat, put a large tea-cupfhl of the jelly into a saucepan, with half a glass of sweet wine, a little sugar and nutmeg, and heat it up till it be ready to boil, then take a little of it, and beat by degrees to the yolk of an egg, and adding a bit of butter, the size of a nutmeg, stir it all together, but do not let it boil. Grate a piece of fresh lemon-peel into it. Another. Boil two calf’s feet, two ounces of veal, and two of beef, the bottom of a penny-loaf, two or three blades of mace, half a nutmeg sliced, and a little salt, in three quarts of w'ater, to three pints; strain, and take off the fat. Chicken Broth. Put the body and legs of the fowl, that chicken panada was made of, as in page 374, after taking off the skin and rump, into the water it was boiled in, with one blade of mace, one slice of onion, and ten white peppercorns. Simmer till the broth be of a pleasant flavour. If not water enough, add a little. Beat a quarter of an ounce of sweet almonds with a tea-spoonful of water, fine, boil it in the broth, strain, and when cold, remove the fat. Eel Broth. Clean half a pound of small eels, and set them on with three pints of water, some parsley, one slice of onion, a few peppercorns; let them simmer till the eels are broken, and the broth good. Add salt, and strain it off. The above should make three half pints of broth. 2 B 2372 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Tench Broth. Make as eel broth. They are both very nutritious and light of digestion. Beef Tea. Cut a pound of fleshy beef in thin slices; simmer with a quart of water twenty minutes, after it has once boiled, and been skimmed. Season, if approved; but it has generally only salt. Dr. Ratcliff's Restorative Pork Jelly. Take a leg of well-fed pork, just as cut up, beat it, and break the bone. Set it over a gentle fire, with three gallons of water, and simmer to one. Let half an ounce of mace, and the same of nutmeg*, stew in it. Strain through a fine sieve. When cold, take off the fat. Give a chocolate-cup the first and last thing, and at noon, putting salt to taste. Shank Jelly. Soak twelve shanks of mutton four hours, then brush and scour them very clean. Lay them in a saucepan with three blades of mace, an onion, twenty Jamaica and thirty or forty black peppers, a bunch of sweet herbs, and a crust of bread made very brown by toasting. Pour three quarts of water to them, and set them on a hot hearth close covered ; let them simmer as gently as possible for five hours, then strain it off, and put it in a cold place. This may have the addition of a pound of beef, if ap- proved, for flavour. It is a remarkably good thing for people who are weak. Arroxo-root Jelly. Of this beware of having the wTong sort, for it has been counterfeited wdth bad effect. If genuine, it is very nourishing, especially for w'eak bow'els. Put into a sauce- pan half a pint of water, a glass of sherry, or a spoonful of brandy, grated nutmeg, and fine sugar; boil up once,373 SICK COOKERY. then mix it by degrees into a dessert-spoonful of arrow- root, previously rubbed smooth with two spoonsful of cold water; then return the whole into the saucepan; stir and boil it three minutes. Tapioca Jelly. Choose the largest sort, pour cold water on to wash it two or three times, then soak it in fresh water five or six hours, and simmer it in the same until it become quite clear; then put lemon-juice, wine, and sugar. The peel should have been boiled in it. It thickens very much. Gloucester Jelly. Take rice, sago, pearl-barley, hartshorn shavings, and eringo-root, each an ounce; simmer with three pints of water to one, and strain it. When cold it will be a jelly; of which give, dissolved in wine milk, or broth, in change with other nourishment. Panada, made in Jive minutes. Set a little water on the fire with a glass of white wine, some sugar, and a scrape of nutmeg and lemon- peel ; meanwhile grate some crumbs of bread. The moment the mixture boils up, keeping it still on the fire, put the crumbs in, and let it boil as fast as it can. AVhen of a proper thickness just to drink, take it off. Another. Make as above, but instead of a glass of wine, put in a tea-spoonful of rum, and a bit of butter; sugar as above. This is a most pleasant mess. Another. Put to the water a bit of lemon-peel, mix the crumbs in, and when nearly boiled enough, put some lemon or orange syrup. Observe to boil all the ingredients, for if any be added after, the panada will break, and not jelly.374 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chicken Panada. Boil a chicken till about three parts readj^, in a quart of water; take off the skin, cut the white meat off when cold, and put into a marble mortar; pound it to a paste with a little of the water it was boiled in, season with a little salt, a grate of nutmeg, and the least bit of lemon- peel. Boil gently for a few minutes to the consistency you like: it should be such as you can drink, though tolerably thick. This conveys great nourishment in small compass. Sippets, lohen the stomach loill not receive meat. On an extremely hot plate put two or three sippets of bread, and pour over them some gravy from beef, mutton, or veal, with which no butter has been mixed. Sprinkle a little salt over. Eggs. An egg broken into a cup of tea, or beaten and mixed with a basin of milk, makes a breakfast more supporting than tea solely. An egg divided, and the yolk and wdiite beaten sepa- rately, then 'mixed with a glass of wnne, will afford two very wholesome draughts, and prove lighter than when taken together. Eggs very little, boiled, or poached, taken in small quantity, convey much nourishment; the yolk only, when dressed, should be eaten by invalids. A great Restorative. Bake two calf’s feet in two pints of w'ater, and the same quantity of new milk, in a jar close-covered, three hours and a half. When cold, remove the fat. Give a large tea-cupful the first and last thing. What- ever flavour is approved, give it by baking in it lemon- peel, cinnamon, or mace. Add sugar after. Another. Simmer six sheep’s trottei's, two blades of mace, a little cinnamon, lemon-peel, a few' hartshorn-shavings.375 SICK COOKERY. and a little isinglass, in two quarts of water to one; when cold, take off the fat, and give near half a pint twice a day, warming with it a little new milk. Another. Boil one ounce of isinglass shavings, forty Jamaica peppers, and a bit of brown crust of bread, in a quart of water to a pint, and strain it. This makes a pleasant jelly to keep in the house; of which a large spoonful may be taken in wine and water, milk, tea, soup, or any way. Another, a most pleasant Draught. Boil a quarter of an ounce of isinglass shavings with a pint of new milk, to half: add a bit of sugar, and, for change, a bitter almond. Give this at bed-time, not too warm. Butch flummery, blamange, and jellies, as directed in pages 268, 270, and 372, or less rich according to judg- ment. Caudle. Make a fine smooth gruel of half-grits ; strain it wdien boiled well; stir it at all times till cold. When to be used, add sugar, wine, and lemon-peel, with nutmeg. Some like a spoonful of brandy besides the wine; others like lemon-juice. Another. Boil up half a pint of fine gruel, with a bit of butter the size of a large nutmeg, a large spoonful of brandy^ the same of white wine, one of capillaire, a bit of lemon- peel and nutmeg. Another. Into a pint of fine gruel, not thick, put, while it is boiling-hot, the yolk of an egg beaten with sugar, and mixed with a large spoonful of cold water, a glass of wine, and nutmeg. Mix by degrees. It is very agree- able and nourishing. Some like gruel, with a glass of376 DOMESTIC COOKERY. table beer, sugar, &c., witb or without a tea-spooiiful of brandy. Cold Caudle. Boil a quart of spring-water; when cold, add the yolk of an egg, the juice of a small lemon, six spoonsful of sweet wine, sugar to your taste, and syrup of lemons one ounce. A Flour Caudle. Into five large spoonsful of the purest water rub smooth one dessert-spoonful of fine flour. Set over the fire five spoonsful of new milk, and put two hits of sugar into it: the moment it boils, pour into it the flour and water; and stir it over a slow fire twenty minutes. It is a nourishing and gently astringent food. This is an excellent food for babies who have weak bowels. Rice. Caudle. When the water boils, pour into it some grated rice mixed with a little cold water; when of a proper con- sistence, add sugar, lemon-peel, and cinnamon, and a glass of brandy to a quart. Boil all smooth. Another. Soak some Carolina rice in water an hour, strain it, and put two spoonsful of the rice into a pint and a quarter of milk; simmer till it will pulp through a sieve, then put the pulp and milk into the saucepan with a bruised clove and a bit of white sugar. Simmer ten minutes ; if too thick, add a spoonful or two of milk ; and serve with thin toast. To mull IVinc. Boil some spice in a little water till the flavour is gained, then add an equal quantity of port, some sugar and nutmeg; boil together, and serve with toast. Another way. Boil a bit of cinnamon and some grated nutmeg a few minutes, in a large tea-cupful of water; then pour to it a317 SICK COOKERY. pint of port wine, and add sugar to your taste; beat it up, and it will be ready. Or it may be made of good British wine. To make Cofee. Put two ounces of fresh-ground coffee, of the best quality, into a coffee-pot, and pour eight coffee-cups of boiling water on it; let it boil six minutes, pour out a cupful tsvo or three times, and return it again; then put two or three isinglass-chips into it, and pour one large spoonful of boiling water on it; and boil it five minutes more, and set the pot by the fire to keep hot for ten minutes, and you will have coffee, of a beautiful clearness. Fine cream should always be served with coffee, and either pounded sugar-candy, or fine Lisbon sugar. If for foreigners, or those who like it extremely strong, make only eight dishes from three ounces. If not fresh roasted, lay it before the fire until perfectly hot and dry; or you may put the smallest bit of fresh butter into a preserving-pan of a small size, and, when hot, throw the coffee in it, and toss it about until it be fresh- ened, letting it be cold before ground. Coffee Milk. Boil a dessert-spoonful of ground coffee in nearly a pint of milk, a quarter of an hour; then put into it a shaving or two of isinglass, and clear it; let it boil a few minutes, and set it on the side of the fire to grow fine. This is a very fine breakfast; it should be sweetened with real Lisbon sugar of a good quality. Chocolate. Those w'ho use much of this article will find the following mode of preparing it both useful and eco- nomical ; cut a cake of chocolate in very small bits; put a pint of water into the pot, and, when it boils, put in the above; mill it off the fire until quite melted, then on a gentle fire till it boil; pour it into a basin,DOMESTIC COOKERY. 378 and it will keep in a cool place eight or ten days, or more. When wanted, put a spoonful or two into milk^ boil it with sugar, and mill it well. This, if not made thick, is a very good breakfast or supper. Patent Cocoa , Is a light wholesome breakfast. Saloop. Boil a little water, wine, lemon-peel, and sugar to- gether : then mix with a small quantity of the powder, previously rubbed smooth with a little cold water ; stir it all together, and boil it a few minutes. Milk-Porridge. ; Make a fine gruel of half-grits, long boiled; strain off; either add cold milk, or warm with milk, as may be ap- proved. Serve with toast. French Milk-Porridge. Stir some oatmeal and water together, let it stand to he clear, and pour off the latter; pour fresh water upon j it, stir it well, let it stand till next day; strain through a fine sieve, and boil the water, adding milk while doing. The proportion of water must be small. j This is much ordered, with toast, for the breakfast of j weak persons, abroad. j Ground Rice Milk. y Boil one spoonful of ground rice, rubbed down ; smooth, with three half-pints of milk, a bit of cinna- mon, lemon-peel, and nutmeg. Sweeten when nearly done. Sago. To prevent the earthy taste, soak it in cold water an hour, pour that off, and wash it well; then add more, and simmer gently till the berries are clear, with lemon- peel and spice, if approved. Add wdne and sugar, and boil all up together.SICK COOKERY. 319 Sago Milk. Cleanse as above, and boil it slowly, and wholly with new milk. It swells so much, that a small quantity will be sufficient for a quart, and when done it will be diminished to about a pint. It requires no sugar or flavouring. Asses’ Milk Far surpasses any imitation of it that can be made. It should be milked into a glass that is kept warm by being in a basin of hot water. The fixed air that it contains give some people a pain in the stomach. At first a tea-spoonful of rum may be taken with it, but should only be put in the moment it is to be swallowed. Artificial Asses’ AHlk. Boil together a quart of water, a quart of new milk, an ounce of white sugar-candy, half an ounce of eringo- root, and half an ounce of conserve of roses, till half be wasted. This is astringent, therefore proportion the doses to the effect, and the quantity to what will be used while sweet. Another. Mix two spoonsful of boiling water, two of milk and an egg well beaten; sweeten w'ith pounded white sugar- candy. This may be taken twice or thrice a day. Another. Boil two ounces of hartshorn shavings, two ounces of pearl-barley, two ounces of candied eringo-root, and one dozen of snails that have been bruised, in two quarts of water, to one. Mix with an equal quantity of new milk, when taken twice a day. Water Gruel. Put a large spoonful of oatmeal by degrees into a pint of water, and when smooth boil it.380 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Another way. Rub smooth a large spoonful of oatmeal, with two of water, and pour it into a pint of water boiling on the fire; stir it well and boil it quick; but take care it does not boil over. In a quarter of an hour strain it off; and add salt and a bit of butter when eaten. Stir until the butter be incorporated. Barley Gruel. Wash four ounces of pearl-barley; boil it in two quarts of water with a stiek of cinnamon, till reduced to a quart; strain and return it into the saucepan with sugar, i and three-quarters of a pint of port wine. Heat up, and use as wanted. A very agreeable Drink. Into a tumbler of fresh cold water, pour a table-spoon- ful of capillaire, and the same of good vinegar. Tamarinds, currants fresh or in jelly, or scalded cur- rants or cranberries, make excellent drinks; with a little sugar or not, as may be agreeable. A refreshing Drink in a Fever. Put a little tea-sage, two sprigs of balm and a little wood-sorrel, into a stone jug, having first washed and dried them; peel thin a small lemon, and clear from the white ; slice it, and put a bit of the peel in ; then pour in three pints of boiling water, sweeten and cover it 1 close. j Another Drink. Wash extremely well an ounce of pearl-barley; sift it twice, then put to it three pints of water, an ounce of sweet almonds beaten fine, and a bit of lemon-peel; boil till you have a smooth liquor, then put in a little syrup of lemons and capillaire. Another. Boil three pints of water with an ounce and a half of tamarinds, three ounces of currants, and two ounces of381 SICK COOKERY. stone raisins, till near a third be consumed. Strain ic on a bit of lemon-peel, which remove in an hour, as it gives a bitter taste if left long. A most pleasant Drink. Put a tea-cupful of cranberries into a cup of water, and mash them. In the mean time boil two quarts of water with one large spoonful of oatmeal and a bit of lemon- peel ; then add the cranberries, and as much fine Lisbon sugar as shall leave a smart flavour of the fruit; and a quarter of a pint of sherry, or less, as may be proper: boil all for half an hour, and strain oft’. Soft and fine Draught for those loho are weak and have a Cough. Beat a fresh-laid egg, and mix it with a quarter of a pint of new milk warmed, a large spoonful of capillaire, the same of rose-water, and a little nutmeg scraped. Do not warm it after the egg is put in. Take it the first and last thing. Toast and Water. Toast slowly a thin piece of bread till extremely brown and hard, but not the least black ; then plunge it into a jug of cold water, and cover it over an hour before used. This is of particular use in w’eak bowels. It should be of a fine brown colour before drinking it. Barley Water. Wash a handful of common barley, then simmer it gently in three pints of water with a bit of lemon-peel. This is less apt to nauseate than pearl-barley; but the other is a very pleasant drink. Another way. Boil an ounce of pearl-barley a few minutes to cleanse, then ])ut on it a quart of water; simmer an hour : when half done, put into it a bit of fresh lemon-peel, and one bit of sugar. If likely to be too thick, you may put another quarter of a pint of water. Lemon-juice may be added, if chosen.382 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Lemon-water, a delightful Drink. Put two slices of lemon thinly pared into a tea-pot, p little bit of the peel, and a bit of sugar, or a large spoonful of capillaire ; pour in a pint of boiling water, and stop it close two hours. Apple-ivater. Cut two large apples in slices, and pour a quart of boiling water on them; or on roasted apples; strain in two or three hours, and sweeten lightly. Raspberry-vinegar IVater. (See page 351.) This is one of the most delightful drinks that can be made. Bliey. That of cheese is a very wholesome drink, especially when the cows are in fresh herbage. White-wine Whey. Put half a pint of new milk on the fire; the moment it boils up, pour in as much sound raisin-wine as will completely turn it, and it looks clear; let it boil up, then set the saucepan aside till the curd subsides, and do not stir it. Pour the whey off, and add to it half a pint of boiling water, and a bit of white sugar. Thus you will have a whey perfectly cleared of milky particles, and as weak as you choose to make it. Vinegar and Lemon Wheys. Pour into boiling milk as much vinegar or lemon-juice as will make a small quantity quite clear, dilute with hot water to an agreeable smart acid, and put a bit or two of sugar. This is less heating than if made of wine j and if only to excite perspiration, answers as well. Buttermilk, ivith Bread or u'ithout. It is most wholesome when sour, as being less likely to be heavy; but most agreeable when made of sweet cream.583 SICK COOKERY. Dr. Boerhaave’s sweet Buttermilk. Take the milk from the cow into a small churn, of about six shillings price; in about ten minutes begin churning, and continue till the flakes of butter swim about pretty thick, and the milk is discharged of all the greasy particles, and appears thin and blue. Strain it through a sieve, and drink it as frequently as possible. It should form the whole of the patient’s drink, and the food should be biscuits and rusks in every way and sort; ripe and dried fruits of various kinds, when a decline is apprehended. Baked and dried fruits, raisins in particular, make excellent suppers for invalids, with biscuits, or common cake. Orgeat. Beat two ounces of almonds, with a tea-spoonful of orange-flower water, and a bitter almond or two: then pour a quart of milk and water to the paste. Sweeten with sugar or capillaire. This is a fine drink for those •W'ho have a tender chest; and in the gout it is highly useful, and with the addition of half an ounce of gum arable, has been found to allay the painfulness of the at- tendant heat. Half a glass of brandy may be added if thought too cooling in the latter complaints, and the glass of orgeat may be put into a basin of warm water. Orangeade, or Lemonade. Squeeze the juice; pour boiling water on a little of the peel, and cover close. Boil water and sugar to a thin syrup, and skim it. When all are cold, mix the juice, the infusion, and the syrup, with as much more water as will make a rich sherbet; strain through a jelly- bag. Or squeeze the juice, and strain it, and add water and capillaire. Egg Wine. Beat an egg, mix with it a spoonful of cold water; set on the lire a glass of white, wine, half a glass of water, sugar, and nutmeg. When it boils, pour a little384 DOMESTIC COOKERY. of it to the egg by degrees, till the whole be in, stirring it well; then return the whole into the saucepan, put it on a gentle fire, stir it one way for not more than a minute; for if it boil, or the egg he stale, it will curdle. Serve with toast. Egg wine may be made as above, without Avarming the egg, and it is then lighter on the stomach, though not so pleasant to the taste. COOKERY FOR THE POOR. General Remarks and Hints. I promised a few hints, to enable every family to assist I the poor of their neighbourhood at a very trivial ex- j pense; and these may be varied or amended at the dis- cretion of the mistress. ] Where cows are kept, a jug of skimmed milk is a valuable present, and a very common one. ' When the oven is hot, a large pudding may he baked, and given to a sick or young family; and thus made, the trouble is little:—Into a deep coarse pan put half a jiound of rice, four ounces of coarse sugar or treacle, two quarts of milk, and two ounces of dripping; set it cold into the oven. It Avill take a good while, but be an excellent, solid food. A very good meal may be bestowed in a thing called j brewis, Avhich is thus made:—Cut a very thick upper crust of bread, and put it into the pot where salt beef is boiling and near ready; it will attract some of the fat, and, when swelled out, will be no unpalatable dish to those who rarely taste meat. j A baked Soup. Put a pound of any kind of meat cut in slices; two 1 onions, two carrots, ditto; two ounces of rice, a pint of split peas, or Avhole ones if previously soaked, pepper and salt, into an earthen jug or pan, and pour one gallon of water. Cover it very close, and bake it Avith the bread.385 COOKERY FOR THE POOR. The cook should he charged to save the boiling of every piece of meat, ham, tongue, &c., however salt; and it is easy to use only a part of that, and the rest of fresh water, and by the addition of more vegetables, the bones of the meat used in the family, the pieces of meat that come from table on the plates, and rice, Scotch barley, or oatmeal, there will be some gallons of nutritious soup two or three times a w'eek. The bits of meat should be only warmed in the soup, and remain whole; the bones, &c. boiled till they yield their nourishment. If the things are ready to put in the boiler as soon as the meat is served, it will save lighting fire, and second cooking. Take turnips, carrots, leeks, potatoes, the outer leaves of lettuce, celery, or any sort of vegetable that is at hand; cut them small, and throw in with the thick part of peas, after they have been pulped for soup, and grits, or coarse oatmeal which have been used for gruel. Should the soup be of poor meat, the long boiling of the bones and different vegetables, will afford better nourishment than the laborious poor can obtain; espe- cially as they are rarely tolerable cooks, and have not fuel to do justice to wdiat they buy. But in every family there is some superfluity; and if it be prepared with cleanliness and care, the benefit will be very great to the receiver, and the satisfaction no less to the giver. 1 found in a time of scarcity, ten or fifteen gallons ! of soup could be dealt out weekly at an e.xpense not ' worth mentioning, though the vegetables were bought. If in the villages about London, abounding with opulent families, the quantity of ten gallons were made in ten gentlemen’s houses, there would be a hundred gallons of wholesome, agreeable food given weekly for the supply of forty poor families, at the rale of two gallons and a half each. What a relief to the labouring husband, instead of bread and cheese, to have a warm comfortable meal! ( To the sick, aged, and infant branches, how important an advantage ! nor less to the industrious mother, whose forbearance from the necessary quantity of food, thatnOMESTIC COOKERY. 386 Others may have a large share, frequently reduces that strength upon -which the welfare of her family essentially depends. It very rarely happens that servants object to second- ing the kindness of their superiors to the poor; hut should the cook in any family think the adoption of this plan too troublesome, a gratuity at the end of the winter might repay her, if the love of her fellow-creatures failed of doing it a hundred-fold. Did she readily enter into it, she would never wash away, as useless, the peas or grits of which soup or gruel had been made, broken potatoes, the green heads of celery, the necks and feet of fowls, and particularly the shanks of mutton, and various other articles which, in preparing dinner for the family, are thrown aside. Fish affords great nourishment, and that not by the part eaten only, but the hones, heads, and fins, which contain an isinglass. When the fish is served, let the cook put by some of the w'ater, and stew' in it the above; as likewise add the gravy that is in the dish, until she obtain all the goodness. If to be eaten by itself, when it makes a delightful broth, she should add a very small bit of onion, some pepper, and a little rice-flour rubbed down smooth with it. But strained, it makes a delicious improvement to the meat-soup, particularly for the sick; and when such are to he supplied, the milder parts of the spare hones and meat should be used for them, -with little, if any, of the liquor of the salt meats. The fat should not be taken off the broth or soup, as the poor like it, and arc nourished by it. An excellent Soup for the Weakly. Put tw'o cow-heels and a breast of mutton into a large pan with four ounces of rice, one onion, twenty Jamaica peppers, and twenty black, a turnip, a carrot, and four gallons of water; cover with hro-nm paper, and hake six hours.TARIOUS RECEIPTS. 387 Sago. Put a tea-cupful of sago into a quart of water, and a bit of lemon-peel; when thickened, grate some ginger, and add half a pint of raisin-wine, brown sugar, and two spoonsful of Geneva; boil all up together. It is a most supporting thing for those whom disease has left very feeble. Caudle for the Sick and Lying-in. Set three quarts of water on the fire; mix smooth as much oatmeal as will thicken the whole, with a pint of cold water; when boiling, pour the latter in, and twenty Jamaica peppers in fine powder; boil to a good middling- thickness ; then add sugar, half a pint of well fermented table-beer, and a glass of gin. Boil all. This mess twice, and once or twice of broth, will be of incalculable service. There is not a better occasion for charitable commi- seration than when a person is sick. A bit of meat or pudding sent unexpectedly has often been the means of recalling long-lost appetite. Nor are the indigent alone the grateful receivers; for in the highest houses a real good sick-cook is rarely met with; and many who possess all the goods of fortune have attributed the first return of health to an appetite excited by good kitchen-physic, as it is called. PART XIV. VARIOUS RECEIPTS, AND DIRECTIONS TO SERVANTS. V.\RIOUS RECEIPTS. To make soft Pomatum. Beat half a pound of unsalted fresh lard in common water; then soak and beat it in two rose-waters, drain 2 c 2DOMESTIC COOKERY. 388 it, and beat it Avith two spoonsful of brandy; let it drain from this; add to it some essence of lemon, and keep it in small pots. Another way. Soak half a pound of clear beef-marroAV, and a pound ■of unsalted fresh lard, in water, two or three days, changing and beating it evei^ day. Put it into a sieve; and when dry, into a jar, and the jar into a saucepan of water. When melted, pour it into a basin, and beat it Avith two spoonsful of brandy; drain off the brandy; and then add essence of lemon, bergamot, or any other scent that is liked. Hard Pomatum. Prepare equal quantities of beef-marroAV, and mutton- «uet as before, using the brandy to preserve it, and adding the scent; then pour it into moulds, or, if you have none, into phials of the size you choose the rolls to be. When cold, break the bottles, clear aAvay the glass carefully, and jmt paper round the rolls. Pomade Divine. Clear a pound and a half of beef-marrow from the strings and bone, put it into an earthen pan or vessel of Avater fresh from the spring, and change the Avater night and morning for ten days; then steep it in rose- water tAventy-four hours, and drain it in a cloth till quite dry. Take an ounce of each of the folloAving articles, namely storax, gum-benjamin, odoriferous Cy- press poAvder, or of Florence, half an ounce of cin- namon, tAvo drachms of cloves, and tAVO drachms of nut- meg, all finely poAvdered; mix them Avith the marroAv above prepared; then put all the ingredients into a pewter pot, that holds three pints; make a paste of Avhite of egg and flour, and lay it upon a piece of rag. Over that must be another piece of linen to cover the top of the ])ot very close, that none of the steam may eva- porate. Flit the pot into a large copper pot Avith Avater, observing to keep it steady, that it may not reach toVARIOUS RECEIPTS. 389 tlie covering of tlie pot tliat holds the marrow. As the water shrinks, add more, boiling hot; for it must boil four hours without ceasing a moment. Strain the oint- ment through a linen cloth into small pots, and, when cold, cover them. Do not touch it with any thing but silver. It will keep many years. A fine pomatum may be made by putting half a pound of fresh marrow, ])repared as above, and two ounces of hog’s lard, on the ingredients; and then observing the same process as above. Pot Pourri. l^ut into a large China jar the following ingredients in layers, with bay-salt strewed between the layers:— two pecks of damask-roses, part in buds and part blown; violets, orange-flowers, and jasmine, a handful of each; orris-root sliced, benjamin, and storax, two ounces of each; a quarter of an ounce of musk; a quarter of a pound of angelica-root sliced; a quart of the red parts of clove-gillyflowers; two handsful of lavender-flowers; half a handful of rosemary-flowers; bay and laurel leaves, half a handful of each; three Seville oranges, stuck as full of cloves as possible, dried in a cool oven, and pounded; half a handful of knotted marjoram ; and two handsful of balm of Gilead dried. Cover all quite close. When the pot is uncovered, the perfume is very fine. A quicker sort of Sweet Pot. Take three handsful of orange-flowers, three of clove- gilly flowers, three of damask roses, one of knotted mar- joram, one of lemon-thyme, six bay-leaves, a handful of rosemary, one of myrtle, half one of mint, one of laven- der, the rind of a lemon, and a quarter of an ounce of cloves. Chop all; and j)ut them in layers, with pounded bay-salt between, up to the top of the jar. If all the ingredients cannot be got at once, put them in as you get them; always throwing in salt with every new article.DOMESTIC COOKERT. 390 To make Wash-Balls. Sliave thin two pounds of new white soap into about a tea-cupful of rose-water, then pour as much hoiling- water on as will soften it. Put into a brass pan a pint of sweet oil, four-pennyworth of oil of almonds, half a pound of spermaceti, and set all over the fire till dis- solved ; then add the soap, and half an ounce of cam- phor that has first been reduced to powder by rubbing it in a mortar with a few drops of spirit of wine, or laven- der-water, or any other scent. Boil ten minutes, then pour it into a basin, and stir it till it is quite thick enough to roll up into hard balls, which must then he done as soon as possible. If essence is used, stir it in quick after it is taken off the fire, that the flavour may not fly off. Paste for chapped Hands, and which xcill preserve them smooth by constant use. Mix a quarter of a pound of unsalted hog’s-lard, which has been washed in common and then rose-water, with the yolks of two new-laid eggs, and a large spoonful of honey. Add as much fine oatmeal or almond paste as will work into a paste. For chapped Lips. Put a quarter of an ounce of benjamin, storax, and spermaceti, two-pennyworth of alkanet-root, a large juicy apple chopped, a bunch of black grapes bruised, a quarter of a pound of unsalted butter, and two ounces of bees-wax, into a new tin saucepan. Simmer gently till the wax, &c., are dissolved, and then strain it through linen. When cold, melt it again, and pour it into small pots or boxes; or if to make cakes, use the bottoms of tea-cups. Hungary Water. To one pint of highly rectified spirit of wine, put an ounce of oil of rosemary, and two drachms of essence of ambergris; shake the bottle well several times, then let the cork remain out twenty-four hours. After a month,391 VARIOUS RECEIPTS. during wliicli time shake it daily, put the water into small bottles. Honey Water. Take a pint of spirit as above, and three drachms of essence of ambergris; shake them well daily. Lavender Water. Take a pint of spirit as above, essential oil of lavender one ounce, essence of ambergris two drachms; put all into a quart bottle, and shake it extremely Avell. All excellent Water to j^revent Hair from falling off, and to thicken it. Put four pounds of unadulterated honey into a still, wnth twelve handsful of the tendrils of vines, and the same quantity of rosemary tops. Distil as cool and as slowly as possible. The liquor may be allowed to drop till it begins to taste sour. Black Paper for Drawing Patterns. Mix and smooth lamp-black and sweet oil; with a bit of flannel cover a sheet or two of large writing-paper with this mixture; then dab the paper dry with a bit of fine linen, and keep it by fur using in the following manner: Put the hlack side on another sheet of paper, and fasten the corners together with small pins. Lay on the back of the black paper the pattern to be drawn, and go over it with the point of a steel pencil: the black paper will then leave the impression of the ])attern on the under sheet, on which you must draw it with ink. If you draw patterns on cloth or muslin, do it w'ith a pen dipped in a bit of stone blue, a bit of sugar, and a little water, mixed smooth in a tea-cup, in which it will be alw'ays ready for use, if fresh; wet to a due consistenee as wanted. Black Ink. Take a gallon of rain or soft water, and three-quarters of a pound of blue galls bruised: infuse them three392 DOMESTIC COOKERY. weeks, stirring daily. Then add four ounces of green copperas, four ounces of logwood-chips, si.\ ounces of gum arabic, and a wine-glasslul of brandy. Another way.—The ink powder sold in Shoe-lane is one of the best preparations in this useful article. Direc- tions are given with it how to mix it; in addition to which, a large cup of sweet wort to two papers of the powder, gives it the brightness of the japan ink. If a packet of six papers is bought together, it costs only eighteen-pence, and that quantity will last a long time. To cement broken China. Beat lime into the most impalpable powder, sift it through fine muslin : then tie some into a thin muslin ; put on the edges of the broken china some white of egg, then dust some lime quickly on the same, and unite them exactly. An excellent Stucco, lohich will adhere to Wood-ioork. Take a bushel of the best lime-stone, a pound of yellow ochre, and a quarter of a pound of brown umber, all in fine powder. Mix them with a sufficient quantity of hot (but not boiling) water, to a proper thickness; and lay it on with a white-washer’s brush, wdiich should be new. If the wall be quite smooth, one or two coats wull do; but each must be dry before the next is put on. The month of March is the best season for doing this.] Masons’ Washes for Stucco. Blue.—To four pounds of blue vitriol, and a pound of the best whiting, put a gallon of w'ater in an iron or brass pot. Let it boil an hour, stirring it all the time. Then pour it into an earthen pan; and set it by fcr a day or two till the colour is settled. Pour off the water, and mix the colour with white-washer’s size. Wash the walls three or four times, according as is necessary. } ellow.—Dissolve in soft water over the fire equal quantities separately of umber, bright ochre, and blue black. Then put some of each into as much wdiite-wash as you think sufficient for the work, and stir it all to-VARIOUS RECEIPTS. 393 gether. If either cast predominates, add more of the others till you have the proper tint. The most beautiful white-wash is made by mixing the lime and size with skimmed milk instead of water. •Roman Cement or Mortar, for outside 'plastering or hrick-work. This will resist all weather; and may be used to great advantage to line reservoirs, as no water can penetrate it. Take eigbty-four pounds of drift sand, twelve pounds of unslaked lime, and four pounds of the poorest cheese grated through an iron grater. When well mixed, add enough hot (but not boiling) water to make into a pro- per consistence for plastering such a quantity of the above as is wanted. It requires very good and quick working. One hod of this mortar will go a great way, as it is to be laid on in a thin smooth coat, without the least space being left uncovered. The wall or lath-work should be covered first with hair-and-lime mortar, and well dried. This was used by the ancients, and is now adopted among us. The Suffolk cheese does better than any other of this country. To take Stains of any kind, out of Linen. Stains caused by Acids.—Wet the part, and lay on it some salt of wormwood. Then rub it, without diluting it with more water. Another.—Let the cloth imbibe a little water without dipping, and hold the part over a lighted match at a due distance. The spots will be removed by the sulphureous gas. Another tvay.—Tie up in the stained part some pearl- ash •, then scrape some soap into cold soft water to make a lather, and boil the linen till the st.ain disappears. Stains of Wine, Fruit, ^-c., after they have been long in the Linen.—Rub the part on each side with yellow soap. Then lay on a mixture of starch in cold water very thick; rub it well in, and expose the linen to the sun and air till the stain comes out. If not removed in394 DOMESTIC COOKERY. three or four clays, rub that off, and renew tlie process. When dry, it may be sprinkled with a little water. Many other stains may he taken out by dipping the linen in sour buttermilk, and drying in a hot sun. Then ■wash it in cold water, and dry it, two or three times a day. Iron-moulds should be wetted, then laid on a hot ^vater-plate, and a little essential salt of lemons put on the part. If the linen becomes dry, wet it, and renew the process; observing that the plate is kept boiling hot. Much of the powder sold under the name of salt of lemons is a spurious preparation ; and therefore it is necessary to dip the linen in a good deal of water, and wash it as soon as the stain is removed, to prevent the part from being worn into holes by the acid. To take out Mildew.—Mix soft soap with starch pow- dered, half as much sale, and the juice of a lemon; lay it on the jiart on both sides with a painter’s brush. Let it lie on tlie grass day and night till the stain comes out. To make Flannels keejj their Colour and not shrink. Put them into a pail, and pour boiling water on, letting them lie till cold, the first time of washing. To preserve Furs and. Woollen from Moths. Let the former be occasionally combed, while in use, and the latter be brushed and shaken. When not wanted, dry them first, let them be cool, then mix among them bitter apples from the apothecary’s in small muslin bags, sewing them in several folds of linen, carefully turned in at the edges, and keep from damp. To dye the Linings of Furniture, ^-c. Buff or Salmon-colour, according to the depth of the hue.—Rub down on a pewter-plate two pennyworth of Spanish arnatto, and then boil it in a pail of water a quarter of an hour. Put into it two ounces of pot-ash, stir it round, and instantly put in the lining; stir it about all the time it is boiling, which must be five or six minutes; then put it into cold pump water, and hang395 VARIOUS RECEIPTS. the articles up singly without u'ringing. When almost dry, fold and mangle it. Pink.—The calico must be washed extremely clean and be dry. Then boil it in two gallons of soft water, and four ounces of alum; take it out, and dry in the air. In the mean time boil in the alum-water two handsful of wheat-bran till quite slippery, and then strain it. Take two scruples of cochineal, and two ounces of argali finely powdered and sifted; mix with it the liquor by little at a time. Then put into the liquor the calico ; and boil it till it is almost wasted, moving it about. Take out the calico, and wash it in chamberley first, and in cold water after: then rinse it in water- starch strained, and dry it quick without hanging it in folds. Mangle it very highly, unless you have it calen- dered, which is best. Blue.—Let the calico be washed clean and dried; then mix some of Scott’s liquid blue in as much water as will be sufficient to cover the things to be dyed, and put some starch to it, to give a slight stiffness. Dry a bit, to see whether the colour is deep enough; set the linen, &c. into it, and wash it; then dry the articles singly, and mangle or calender them. To dye Gloves to look like fork-ian or Limerick, ac- cording to the deepness of the Dye. Put some saffron into a pint of soft water boiling-hot, and let it infuse all night; next morning wet the leather over with a brush. The tops should be sewn close, to prevent the colour from getting in. To dye White Gloves a beautiful Purple. Boil four ounces of logwood, and two ounces of roche alum, in three pints of soft water till half wasted. Let it stand to be cold, after straining. Let the gloves be nicely mended; then do them over with a brush, and when dry repeat it. Twice is sufficient, unless the colour is to be very dark. When dry, rub off’ the loose dye with a coarse cloth. Beat up the white of an egg.396 DOMESTIC COOKERY. and -with a sponge rub it over the leather. The dye will stain the hands, but wetting them with vinegar will take it off before they are washed. A liquor to ivash old Deeds, ^'c. on Paper or Parch- ment, when the loriting is obliterated, or, xohen sxmk, to make it legible. Take five or six galls, bruise them, and put them into a pint of strong white wine ; let it stand in the sun two days. Then dip a brush into the wine, and wash the part of the writing which is sunk; and by the colour you will see whether it is strong enough of the galls. To prevent the Rot in Sheep. Keep them in the pens till the dew is off the grass. To prevevit Green Hay from Firing. Stuff a sack as full of straw or hay as possible ; tie the mouth with a cord; and make the rick round the sack, drawing it uji as the rick advances in height, and quite out when finished. The funnel thus left in the centre preserves it. To preserve a Granary from Insects and Weasels. Make the floor of Lombardy poplars. To destroy Crickets. Put Scotch snuff upon the holes where they come out. DIRECTIONS TO SERVANTS. To clean Calico Furniture xohen taken doxon for the Summer. Shake off the loose dust, then lightly brush with a small long-haired furniture-brush; after which wipe it closely with clean flannels, and rub it with dry bread. If properly done, the curtains will look nearly as well as at first; and if the colour be not light, they will not require washing for years. Fold in large parcels, and put carefully by. While the furniture remains up, it should be pre-DIRECTIONS TO SERVANTS. 391 served from the sun and air as much as possible, which injure delicate colours j and tlie dust may be blown off with bellows. By the above mode curtains may be kept clean, even to use with the linings newly dipped. To clean Plate. Boil an ounce of prepared hartshorn-powder in a quart of water: while on the fire, put into it as much plate as the vessel will hold; let it boil a little, then take it out, drain it over the saucepan, and dry it before the fire. Put in more, and serve the same, till you have done. Then put into the water some clean linen rags till all be soaked up. When dry, they will serve to clean the plate, and are the very best things to clean the brass locks and finger-plates of doors. When the plate is quite dry, it must be rubbed bright with leather. This is a very nice mode. In many plate-powders there is a mixture of quicksilver, which is very injurious; and, among other disadvantages, it makes silver so brittle, that from a fall it will break. To clean Looking-glasses. Remove the fly-stains, and other soil, by a damp rag; then polish with woollen cloth and powder blue. To i^reserve Gilding, and clean it. It is not possible to prevent flies from staining the gilding without covering it; before which, blow off the light dust, and pass a feather or clean brush over it: then with strips of paper cover the frames of your glasses and do not remove till the flies are gone. Linen takes off the gilding, and deadens its bright- ness ; it should therefore never be used for wiping it. Some means should be used to destroy the flies, as they injure furniture of every kind, and the paper likewise. Bottles hung about with sugar and vinegar, or beer, will attract them; or fly-water, put into little shells placed about the room, but out of the reach of children.DOMESTIC COOKERY. 398 To clean Paint. Never use a elotli, but take off the dust with a little long-haired brush, after blowing off the loose parts with the bellows. With care, paint wdll look w’ell for a length of time. When soiled, dip a sponge or a bit of flannel into soda and water, wash it off’ quickly, and dry im- mediately, or the strength of the soda will eat off the colour. When wainscot requires scouring, it should be done from the top downw'ards, and the soda be prevented from running on the unclean part as much as possible, or marks will be made which will appear after the whole is finished. One person slionld dry with old linen, as fast as the other has scoured off the dirt and washed the soda off". To clean Paper Hamjings. First blow off the dust with the bellows. Divide a white loaf of eight days old into eight parts. Take the crust into your hand, and beginning at the toji of the pa- per, w'ipe it downwards in the lightest manner with the crumb. Do not cross, nor go upw'aids. The dirt of the paper and the crumbs will fall together. Observe, you must not wipe above half a yard at a stroke, and after doing all the upper part, go round again, beginning a little above where yon left off. If you do not do it ex- tremely lightly, you will make the dirt adhere to the paper.—It will look like new if properly done. To give a Gloss to fine Oak-wainscot. If greasy, it must be washed with warm beer; then boil two quarts of strong beer, a bit of bees-wax as large as a walnut, and a large spoonful of sugar; wet it all over with a large brush, and when dry rub it till bright. To give a fine Colour to 3Iahogani/. Let the tables be washed perfectly clean with vinegar, having first taken out any ink stains there may be with spirit of salt • but it must be used with the greatest care.DIRECTIONS TO SERVANTS. 399 and only touch the part aflected, and be instantly washed otf. Use the following liquid:—Into a pint of cold- drawn linseed-oil, put four-pennyworth of alkanet-root, and two-pennyworth of rose-pink, in an earthen vessel; let it remain all night; then stirring well, rub some of it all over the tables with a linen rag; when it has lain some time, rub it bright with linen cloths. Eating tables should be covered with mat, oil-cloth, or baize, to prevent staining, and be instantly rubbed when the dishes are taken oft’, while still warm. To take Ink out of Mahogany. Dilute half a tea-spoonful of oil of vitriol with a large spoonful of water, and touch the part with a feather; watch it, for if it stays too long it will leave a white mark. It is therefore better to rub it quick, and repeat if not quite removed. Floor-cloths Should he chosen that are painted on a fine cloth, which is well covered with the colour, and the flowers on which do not rise much above the ground, as they wear out first. The durability of the cloth will depend much on these two particulars, but more especially on the time it has been painted, and the. goodness of the colours. If they have not been allowed sufficient space for becoming thoroughly hardened, a very little use will injure them; and as they are very expensive articles, care in pre- serving them is necessary. It answers to keep them some time before they are used, either hung up in a dry barn where they will have air, or laid down in a spare room. When taken up for the winter, they should be rolled round a carpet-roller, and observe not to crack the paint by turning the edges in too suddenly. Old carpets answer extremely well, painted and sea- soned some months before laid down. If for passages, the width must be directed when they are sent to the manufactory, as they are cut before painting.400 DOMESTIC COOKERY. To dean Floor-cloths. Sweep, then wipe them with a flannel; and when all dust and spots are removed, rub with a waxed flannel, and then with a dry plain one ; but use little wax, and rub only enough with the latter to give a little smooth- ness, or it may endanger falling. Washing now and then with milk after the above sweeping and dry-ruhbing them, gives as beautiful a look, and they are less slippery. 7'o dust Carpets and Floors. Sprinkle tea-leaves on them, then sweep carefully. The former should not be swept frequently with a whisk brush, as it wears them fast: only once a week, and the other times with the leaves and a hair-brush. Fine carpets should be gently done with a hair hand- brush, such as for clothes, on the knees. To dean Carpets. Take up the carpet, let it be well beaten, then laid down, and brush on both sides with a hand-brush: turn it the right side upwards, and scour it with ox-gall and soap and water, very clean, and dry it with linen cloths. Then lay it on grass, or hang it up to dry. To give to hoards a beautiful Appearance. After washing them very nicely clean with soda and warm water, and a brush, wash them with a very large sponge and clean water. Both times observe to leave no spot untouched ; and clean straight up and down, not crossing from hoard to board; then dry with clean cloths, rubbed hard up and down in the same way. The floors should not be often wetted, but very thoroughly when done; and once a week dry-rubbed ■with hot-sand, and a heavy brush, the right way of the boards. The sides of stairs or passages on which are carpets or floor-cloth, should be washed with sponge instead of linen or flannel, and the edges will not be soiled. Uif- ferent sponges should be kept for the above two uses;DIRECTIONS TO SERVANTS. 401 and those and the brushes should be 'well washed when done with, and kept in dry places. To extract Oil from Boards or Stone. Make a strong ley of pearl-ashes and soft water, and add as much unslaked lime as it will take up ; stir it toge- ther, and then let it settle a few minutes; bottle it, and stop close ; have ready some water to lower it as used, and scour the part with it. If the liquor should lie long on the boards, it will draw out the colour of them; there- fore do it with care and expedition. To clean Stone Stairs and Halls. Boil a pound of pipe-maker’s clay with a quart of w'ater, a quart of small beer, and put in a bit of stone blue. AVash with this mixture, and when dry, rub the stones Avith flannel and a brush. To blacken the fronts of Stone Chimney-pieces. Mix oil-varnish with lamp-black, and a little spirit of turpentine to thin it to the consistence of paint. Wash the stone Avith soap and water very clean; then sponge it Avith clear water; and Avhen perfectly dry brush it OA’er tAvice Avith this colour, letting it dry between the times. It looks extremely avcII. The lamp-black must be sifted first. To take Stains out of Marble. Mix unslaked lime in finest poAvder, with the stronger soap-ley, pretty thick; and instantly, Avith a jiainter’s brush, lay it on the whole of the marble. In two months’ time Avash it off perfectly clean; then have ready a fine thick lather of soft soap, boiled in softAvater; dip a brush in it, and scour the marble Avith powder, not as common cleaning. This will, by very good rubbing, give a beau- tiful polish. Clear oft’ the soap, and finish Avith a smooth hard brush till the end be eft'ected. To take Iron Stains out of Marble. An equal quantity of fresh spirit of vitriol and lemon- juice being mixed in a bottle, shake it Avell; Avet the 2 D402 DOMESTIC COOKEKY. spots, and in a few minutes rub with soft linen till they disappear. To preserve Irons from Rust. Melt fresh mutton-suet, smear over the iron with it while hot; then dust it well with uuslaked lime pounded, and tied up in a muslin. Irons so prepared will keep many months. Use no oil for them at any time, except salad oil, there being water in all other. Fire-irons should be kept wrapt in baize, in a drv j)lace, when not used. Another ivay. Beat into three pounds of unsalted hog’s lard, two drams of camphor, sliced thin, till it is dissolved; then take as much black-lead as will make it of the colour of broken steel. Dip a rag into it, and rub it thick on the stove, &c., and the steel will never rust, even if wet. When it is to be used, the grease must be washed off with hot water, and the steel be dried before polishing. To take Rust out of Steel. Cover the steel with sweet oil well rubbed on it, and in forty-eight hours use unslaked lime finely powdered, to rub until all the rust disappears. To clean the Back of the Grate, the inner Hearth, aiicl the fronts of Cast-Iron Stoves. Boil about a quarter of a pound of the best black-lead with a pint of small beer and a bit of soap the size of a walnut. When that is melted, dij) a painter’s brush, and wet the grate, having first brushed off all.the soot and dust; then take a hard brush and rub it till of a beautiful brightness. Another ivay to clean Cast-Iron and Black Hearths. Mix black-lead and whites of eggs well beaten toge- ther; dip a painter’s brush, and wet all over; then rub 1 it bright with a hard brush.DIRECTIONS TO SERVANTS. 403 To take the Black off the bright Bars of polished stoves in a few minutes. Rub tliem well with some of the following mixture on a bit of broad-cloth ; when the dirt is removed, wipe them clean, and polish with glass, not sand-paper. The mixture.—Boil slowly one pound of soft soap in two quarts of water to one. Of this jelly take three or four spoonsful, and mix to a consistence with emery, No. 3. To clean tin Covers and patent peivter Porter-pots. Get the finest whiting, which is only sold in large cakes, the small being mixed with sand; mix a little of it powdered, with the least drop of sweet oil, and rub ■w'ell, and wipe clean ; then dust some dry whiting in a muslin bag over, and rub bright with dry leather. The last is to prevent rust, which the cook must be careful to guard against by wiping dry, and putting by the fire Avhen they come from the parlour; for if but once hung up without, the steam will rust the inside. To prevent the creaking of a Door. Rub a bit of soap on the hinges. A strong Paste for Paper. To two large spoonsful of fine flour, put as much pounded rosin as will lie on a shilling; mix with as much strong beer as w ill make it of a due consistence, and boil half an hour. Let it be cold before it is used. Fine Blacking for Shoes. Take four ounces of ivory black, three ounces of the coarsest sugar, a table-spoonful of sweet oil, and a pint of small beer; mix them gradually cold. 2 D 2404 DOMESTIC COOKERY.

Omelet. . Macaroni. . Oysters in Scallops, stewed or pickled. Having thus named the sorts of things used for the two courses, the reader will think of many others. For removes of Soup and Fish, one or two joints of Meat or Fowl are served; and for one small course, the arti- cles suited to the second must make a part. Where Vegetables and Fowls, &c. are twice dressed, they add to the appearance of the table the first time; three417 GENERAL REMARKS ON DINNERS. sweet tilings may form the second appearance without great expense. The Bills of Fare which have been given from page 404 to 415 may be modified at discretion. In some houses, one dish at a time is sent up with tlie vegetables or sauces proper to it, and this in succes- sion, hot and hot. In others, a course of Soups and Fish; then Meats and Boiled Fowls, Turkey, &c., Made Dishes and Game follow ; and lastly, Sweet Dishes : but these are not the common modes. It is worthy observation here, that common cooks do not think of sending up such articles as are in ihe house unless ordered; though, by so doing, the addition of a collared or pickled thing, some Fritters, fried Patties, or quick-made Dumplings, would be useful when there happen to be accidental visiters : and at all times it is right to better the appearance of the table rather than let things spoil below', by which the expense of a family is more increased than can be easily imagined. Vege- tables are put on the side-table at large dinners, as like- wise sauces, and servants bring them round: but some inconveniences attend this plan; and, Avhen there are not many to wait, delay is occasioned, besides that by awkwardness the clothes of the company may be spoiled. If the table is of a due size, the articles alluded to will not fill it too much. Note.—Any of the following things may be served as a relish, with the cheese, after dinner. Baked or pickled Fish, done high..Dutch pickled Herring.. Sardinias, which eat like anchovy, but are larger. . Anchovies.. Potted Char. . Ditto Lampreys.. Potted Birds made high . . Caviare and Sippets of Toast. . Salad.. Radishes. . French Pie. . Cold Butter. . Potted Cheese. . Anchovy. Toast, &c. Before serving a Dutch Herring, it is usual to cut to the bones w'ithout dividing, at the distance of two inches, from head to tail.418 DOMESTIC COOKERY. SUPPERS. Hot suppers are not much in use where people dine very late. When required, the top and bottom, or either, may be Game.. Fowls. . Rabbit. . Boiled Fish, such as Soles, Mackerel. . Oysters stewed or scalloped. . French Beans. . Cauliflower, or Jerusalem Artichokes, in white Sauce.. Brocoliwith Eggs. . Stewed Spinach and ditto. . Sweetbreads. . Small Birds. . Mushrooms. . Potatoes. . Scallops, &c...Cutlets. . Roast Onions.. Salmagundi.. Buttered Eggs on Toast. . Cold Neat’s Tongue. . Ham.. Collared things.. Hunter’s Beef sliced. . Rusks buttered, with Anchovies on.. Grated Hung Beef with Butter, wuth or without Rusks . . Grated Cheese round, and Butter dressed in the middle of a plate.. Radishes ditto ..Custards in glasses with Sippets.. Oysters cold or pickled. . Potted Meats. . Fish. . Birds.. Cheese, &c.. . Good plain Cake sliced. . Pies of Birds or Fruit.. Crabs . . Lobsters. . Prawns.. Crayfish. . Anyof the list of sweet things.. Fruits. A sandwich set with any of the above articles, placed at a little distance from each other on the table, looks well; without the tray, if preferred. The lighter the things, the better they appear, and glass intermixed has the best effect. Jellies, different coloured things, and -flowers add to the beauty of the table. An elegant supper may he served, at a small ex- pense, by those who know how to make trifles that are in the house form the greatest part of the meal.INDEX.

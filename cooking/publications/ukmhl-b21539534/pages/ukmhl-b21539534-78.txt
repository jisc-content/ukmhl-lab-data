Select lamb kidneys, and have them split in half and skewered open with very small skewers, caught through the outer skin. Lay in the blazer half a dozen thin slices of fat breakfast bacon, and cook out the fat; then draw the bacon to the side of the pan and put in the kid- neys. They will require about six min- utes to cook, and must be turned often. When brown and tender (test them with a fork), they are done. Add then a tea- spoonful of Worcestershire sauce to the gravy, and serve a slice of bacon and a little gravy with each portion of kidney. These should, if possible, be served on thin toast or fried bread.

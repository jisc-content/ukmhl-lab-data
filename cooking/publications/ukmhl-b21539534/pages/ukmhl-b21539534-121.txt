But it is seldom that the pantry is utterly de- nuded. In almost every house there are kept constantly in store such provisions as eggs, butter, fiour, cheese, potatoes, bread, crackers, and there are few houses where there is not also a small supply at least of bacon, or sardines, or potted meats, or fish, or canned goods of some sort, and curry-powder, pickles, catsups, and the like, with whose aid may be evolved a delicious impromptu supper.

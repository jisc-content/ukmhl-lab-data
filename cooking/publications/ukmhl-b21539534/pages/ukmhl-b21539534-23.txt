Among them should be a graduated measuring-cup of agate iron-ware or of glass, and two or three small bowls in which she may break and beat eggs. One of these should be a pint, another a quart bowl.

Some cooks prefer using for pepper the little wooden German spice-mills, and claim that they thus get fuller strength than from the ready-ground condiments.

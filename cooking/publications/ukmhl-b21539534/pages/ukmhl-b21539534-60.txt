46 FRICASSEED OYSTERS WITH MUSHROOMS. Thirty oysters. Half cupful mushrooms, sliced. One tablespoonful butter. One tablespoonful flour. Three gills cream. One gill mushroom liquor. Yolks of two eggs. Scant teaspoonful salt. Pinch of white pepper. Cook together the butter and flour over hot water, pour upon them the cream and the mushroom liquor, put in the oysters and the mushrooms, and when the former begin to plump, stir in the beaten yolks of the eggs, very slowly. Unless this is done with great caution the sauce will curdle. Cook them only a minute, until the raw yellow becomes creamy, season, and serve. These are especially nice upon Graham toast.

3 INTRODUCTION By The Right Hon. LORD BRASSEY, G.C.B. Our unskilful cookery is a national defect, from which no class has suffered more than British sailors, depending as they do largely on salt meats and preserved provisions. During my Presidency of the Association founded by that noble-hearted philanthropist, Dr. Barnardo, Mr. Bond, the Author of the present volume, occupied the post of Chief Cook at the Watts Naval Training School, a branch of Dr. Barnardo’s Homes. A number of boys from this school have had a promising start in life as Ship's Cooks, and the success has been largely due to Mr. Bond’s practical skill and organising ability. Mr. Bond has rightly judged that good work may be done for the improvement of sea-cookery by clear writing on the subject. His first publication, entitled “Sensible Cookery,” was widely circulated ; and now he is bringing out a more comprehensive volume, with many additional recipes. I confidently recommend “ Sea Cookery ” to all men of the sea. BRASSEY. January, 1911.

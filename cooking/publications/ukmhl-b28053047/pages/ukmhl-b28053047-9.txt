3 INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST EDITION By the late LORD NUN BURN HOLME. I am glad to be able to commend this little book on Sea Cookery to the class for whom it is intended. The nautical cook of the future must be prepared to lay aside many old prejudices, and to acquire man)' new ideas. The time has gone by for the wasteful and inefficient methods which in the past have proved so detrimental to Shipowners, Officers, and crew alike, and have deterred so many Englishmen from following the sea vocation. Nor must the cook suppose that he has qualified himself for his career merely by obtaining a certificate of competency. The lessons of the school must be tested under the conditions imposed by the galley of a ship at sea, and approved or modified accordingly. The theoretical principles of the art always remain the same, but care, commonsense, and a trained faculty of observation are more than ever needed to carry them into effect. Mr. Bond has had experience both of shore theory and sea practice, and any advice from him must carry weight. I trust that the book will prove a boon to the rising generation of sea cooks.

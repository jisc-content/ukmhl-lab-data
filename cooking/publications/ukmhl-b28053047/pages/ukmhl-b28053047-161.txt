155 JAM TURNOVERS. These are made and baked exactly in the same way as Jam Puffs, excepting that they are different in shape. After putting jam in the centre of each round the}-' are folded over into exact halves, and the edges pressed together to prevent them coming open during baking. Finish off and bake as directed for Jam Puffs. CREAM SLICES (Vanilla Fingers). Roll out a sheet of puff paste until it is two feet long and eight inches wide, and about -J- inch thick. Cut this into halves, length- wise. This will give you two strips of paste, each four inches wide.. Put these on a baking sheet and bake in a hot oven (425° F.)- about half an hour. Remove them from the oven and allow to go cold on the baking tin. When cold, spread custard filling, flavoured with vanilla, thickly over one strip of the puff paste, and lay the second strip of paste on the top, sandwich fashion. Spread water icing on the top of this, and when it has set, have a sharp knife and cut the strip across into twelve even pieces, and serve. 3 lbs. flour 4 lb. butter 4 lb. lard 14 lb. sugar 10 eggs SULTANA CAKE. 2 lbs. sultanas 4 lb. chopped candied peel 1 pint milk 4 oz. baking powder Have ready a paper lined baking tin, or if preferred, round cake tins.

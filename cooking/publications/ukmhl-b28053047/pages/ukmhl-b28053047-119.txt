113 RICE PUDDING (Without Eggs.) 1£ pints milk 1 teaspoonful butter 1£ tablespoonfuls rice dusting of spice or nutmeg 2 tablespoonfuls sugar Wash the rice and put it into a pie dish, dissolve the sugar in the milk and pour it over the rice, put the butter and spice on top, and bake in a moderate oven one-and-a-half hours. Do not allow the milk to boil in the oven or the spice will cause the rice to turn very dark. 1 pint milk 2 eggs \ lb. flour PANCAKES. dust of nutmeg 2 ozs. sugar Put the flour into a bowl, add the milk and sugar, and mix to a smooth batter. Beat the eggs to a froth, stir them into the batter and add the dust of nutmeg. Put this aside in a cool place for half-an-hour or longer. When ready to use have a very clean frying pan and make hot in it one tablespoonful lard or clean white dripping, pour this out into a jar, and then put just sufficient of the batter into the pan to cover the bottom thinly. Fry this until you see a bluish smoke issuing from beneath the cake, and by giving the pan a sharp jerk sideways the cake will be loosened. Turn it over and fry the other side about half the time. Turn out the pancake on a sugar sprinkled board, sprinkle the pancake with sugar, roll it up, divide it into three, and proceed in this way until all the batter is used. Send to the table very hot and serve with slices of lemon.

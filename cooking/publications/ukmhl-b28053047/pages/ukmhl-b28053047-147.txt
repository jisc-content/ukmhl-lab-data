141 Allow them to cool on the tin after they are baked. Run a small quantity of water icing on the top of each, and they are ready for serving. ITALIAN BUNS. These are made from the same dough as Sally Lunns, but with the addition of almond paste and water icing. To make them, have ready the dough divided into 2 ozs. pieces, mould them up like an ordinary bun, and place them well apart on a warm greased baking sheet to rise. When about half risen, make a hollow in the centre of each by pressing it down with the thumb. Put a small piece of almond paste, which has previously been coloured pink with a little cochineal, in each hollow centre, allow them to fully rise, and bake in a hot oven (425° F.) about fifteen minutes. Allow to cool, and then run a little water icing around the top of each before serving. STEAM BREAD AND BUN PROVER. This apparatus is designed so that a sufficient quantity of wet steam may be sprayed inside, so that bread, rolls, or fermented buns, after being moulded into shape and placed on the sheet tins, can be proved equally as well before baking as they are proved at the bakers’ establishments ashore. Wet steam has the effect of keeping the surface of the dough moist, m addition to giving the required warmth, with the result that the buns or bread, after being baked, is thin and has also a good rich colour.

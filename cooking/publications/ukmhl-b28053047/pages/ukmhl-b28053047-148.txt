142 GINGERBREAD. 4 lbs. flour x teaspoonful pimento or allspice 1 teaspoonful mixed spice 1 oz. bi-carbonate of soda 1 teaspoonful ground ginger lb. brown sugar 1 lb. treacle 4 pint water \ lb. butter or 7 ozs. of lard Rub the buttei or lard into the flour ; add the spice, pimento, ginger, and bi-carbonate of soda. Mix the sugar and water together and then mix in the treacle. Use this liquid to make up the flour, etc., into a soft dough. Put this dough into a well-greased baking tin so that it will be about half-an-inch thick. Bake this in a slow oven (350° F.) for about 30 minutes. Remove the tin from the oven and allow the gingerbread to go cold in the tin. Then cut it into blocks about three inches square and serve. OPEN JAM TART. 1 lb. flour 6 ozs. lard 4 teaspoonful baking powder pinch salt cold water -5- lb. jam. Rub the lard into the flour, add the salt and baking powder, and make this into a paste with cold water. Have ready greased two enamelled plates about 9 inches in diameter. Divide the paste in halves and roll out each half rather large.! than the plates. Put this paste on the plates, trim it off round the edge and spi'ead each of them with jam. Decorate the tops neatly with the paste trimmings, which must have been previously rolled out and cut into neat shapes, and then bake in the bottom of a sharp oven about 20 minutes. It is a sign that the bottom of the tarts are sufficiently baked when the jam boils, or if the paste can easily be moved off the plate. ALMOND TARTS.

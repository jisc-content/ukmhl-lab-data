147 MOSS BISCUITS. 1 lb. flour 5 ozs. castor sugar 10 ozs. butter 2 eggs Rub the butter into the flour. Beat the sugar and eggs together and pour this into the flour. Make this up into a dough and then lay it aside for an hour to get a bit firmer. Then get a wire sieve and rub the dough through it. The dough will stick to the underside of the wire mesh and will have an appear- ance similar to growing moss. This should be lifted off carefully, so as not to spoil the appear- ance, in suitable sized pieces. A palette knife is the most suitable thing to use for lifting with. The pieces should be placed on a baking sheet and baked in a sharp oven (425° F.) about ten minutes. Beat the butter and sugar to a cream, beat in the eggs one at a time, add the flour, baking powder, and milk, and mix to a dough. Divide this into pieces 2 ozs. each, and mould them up. Press a hollow in the top of each and put about a saltspoonful of raspberrjr jam in the hollow. Draw up the dough round the jam until the jam is quite folded inside. Put the buns on to a greased baking sheet, with the folded side underneath. Eggwash them over, sprinkle each with rough sugar, cut each twice on the top with a knife, and bake in a sharp oven (425"F.) about 12 minutes. Rub the butter into the flour, add all the remaining ingredients, and mix it into a dough. Break off pieces about oz. each, and put them into a greased baking tin, leaving a good space between each to allow for snreadinv RASPBERRY BUNS. 1 lb. flour i- oz. baking powder £ lb. butter 5 ozs. castor sugar 3 eggs £ pint milk raspberry jam BRANDY SNAP. 2 lbs. flour 1 lb. butter 2£ lbs. sugar 2£ lb. syrup £ oz. ground ginger £ oz. powdered cinnamon £ oz. pimento a little lemon essence

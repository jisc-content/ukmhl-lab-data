94 PATENT ROASTER. The above illustration represents the only patent roaster in use on board nearly all up-to-date steamers. By its use the true “ taste of the fire ” is imparted to all roast joints, which can be literally done to a turn, with a resulting flavour that never can be obtained from joints that are baked in the oven.

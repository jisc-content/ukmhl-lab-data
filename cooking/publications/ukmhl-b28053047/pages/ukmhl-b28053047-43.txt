37 must be retained in the oven as much as possible. The crust is formed on the surface in the following way. The starch which is present in flour is expanded by the heat, and with the aid of the moisture is converted into a substance called dextrin. The dextrin is in its turn converted into caramel or sugar. After a time, if the loaf is still left in the oven, this sugar is converted into carbon, or, in other words, the crust is burnt. The reason why the outer surface is changed in this way and that the inside of the loaf is still white and soft, is because the water is not all evaporated from the loaf, and so long as water is present the heat cannot rise above 212°F., which is the boiling point of water. When the heat has penetrated the loaf so that it is 212°F. in the centre, the dough is cooked and it is then changed from raw dough into bread. The alcohol which was in the dough at the commencement of baking has all escaped in the form of a gas long before the loaf is baked. This is due to the fact that alcohol boils at 174° F., and that the loaf cannot be baked until the heat in the centre has been raised to 212° F. My reason for dealing so minutely with the subject of yeast and bread making is because it is deemed to be the most important branch of a sea cook’s duty, and I hope that these facts will prove of much use to those men for whom this book is especially intended. Close attention to the foregoing principles in the various branches of the culinary art and careful economy in the manipulation and preparation of the ingredients given in the recipes that follow, will, it is hoped, enable those who are dependant upon the skill of the cook for the greater portion of their comfort when at sea, agree with the epicure who wrote in his contentment :— “ Fate cannot harm me—I have dined to-day.”

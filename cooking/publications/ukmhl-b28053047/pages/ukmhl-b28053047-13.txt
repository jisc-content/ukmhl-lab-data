7 PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. By Commander W. F. CABORNE, C.B., R.N.R In days gone by, the term " son of a sea cook ” seems to have been one of the most opprobrious epithets that could be bestowed upon a not altogether satisfactory shipmate. The exact origin of the expression I have never inquired into, but it may well be that at a period when seamanship, or, rather, that portion of the art ot seamanship which formed the every-day equipment of the able seaman of the period, stood on a higher plane than it now does, the comparative phenomenal and colossal ignorance and absolute incompetency of the contemporaneous nautical cooks stood promin- ently forth and specially marked them out, and, by natural inference, their unfortunate offspring also, to be the recipients of the sarcasms of their long-suffering shipmates, whose normally hard lot was rendered still harder by the lamentable want of practical knowledge displayed by those who pretended to be exponents of the culinary art. Time was, and that not so long ago, when “ the doctor," as the ship’s cook is frequently called, was oftener selected more out of compassion for his infirmities than because of his fitness for the post that he undertook to fill, and, under such circumstances, the saying that “ God provides food and the Devil sends cooks ” acquired peculiar force. Although this somewhat Gilbertian arrangement is now pretty well a thing of the past, and matters are on a better footing generally than they were, sea-cookenq even at the present moment, presents a very large field for improvement. Of late years, Nautical Schools of Cookery have been established in a few of our sea-ports, the object being to train the ordinary ship s cook, while using the stoves and utensils with which he will have to woik when afloat, to properly prepare the provisions that are ordinarily supplied to the vessels belonging to the mercantile marine, and also to so manipulate them as to introduce a greater variety into the daily menu of the officers and men. These schools have done, and are doing, excellent work, and their graduates appear to be specially sought after.

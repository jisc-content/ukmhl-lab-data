0X0 Helps the Cook. GOOD cooking depends upon the added flavourings quite as much as on the quality of the material used. The want of good flavouring will quite spoil an expensive dish of fish, meat or fowl. The pity of it, when a little 0X0 would make all the difference ! This important matter is perfectly understood by the leading chefs and cooks in our best restaurants and hotels. Their dishes are a delight to the eye and the palate. The materials they use are no better than one finds in the average kitchen, but—and this is the important point—they thoroughly understand the wonderful improvement a little 0X0 makes to the gravy, to the soup, to the joint or entree. Try 0X0 yourself and see what a wonderful difference it makes to your cooking. If you use it once you will never be without it. The addition of a little 0X0 makes a brilliant success of what would otherwise be quite an ordinary dish. The goodness of 0X0 is due to the goodness and healthiness of the cattle from which it is made—cattle bred and reared on the 0X0 Cattle Farms in the Argentine. A shilling spent on 0X0 will save many shillings in butchers' meat—besides saving a lot of time in the making of soups, sauces, and gravies. FOR SPECIAL 0X0 RECIPES SEE PAGE 176. A

11 PREFACE By Commander W. F. CABORNE, C.B., R.N.R. In January, 1907, I wrote a Preface (which is retained in this book) for “ Sensible Cookery,” the well-deserved success of which work has rendered it desirable for Mr. Richard Bond to now issue another edition in an enlarged and more ambitious form, although under a slightly different, but distinctly nautical, title. Of all that has been done during recent years to better the conditions of service afloat of our mercantile seamen, in the front rank must be placed the certificating of ships’ cooks, the new dietary scale, and the inspection by the Board of Trade of ships’ provisions. It affords me much pleasure to assist with these few words in the launching of the new vade mecum, “Sea Cookery,” and to wish it that conspicuous measure of prosperity which it undoubtedly richly merits. W. F. CABORNE. January, 1911.

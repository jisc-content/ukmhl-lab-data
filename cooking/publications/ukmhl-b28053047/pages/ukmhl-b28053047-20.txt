14 I have given the quantities to use in these recipes in measure- ments so exact, that no one need be afraid to follow them, and I venture to say that with a careful and intelligent cook success will be assured. It is hardly possible to divide the book into sections which would deal exclusively with sea cookery or land cookery ; for in the present day “ tramp ” steamer, when almost everything in foods are either dried, tinned, or compressed, there may be found everything necessary for the preparation of palatable dishes, and passenger vessels now are little less than floating hotels, and as far as the cuisine is concerned, there is no difference between the first- class hotels on shore and the majestic liner out on the broad Atlantic. In conclusion I place these recipes and instructions before my readers with the fullest confidence, they having each and every one been worked out in practical lessons and demonstrations by myself.

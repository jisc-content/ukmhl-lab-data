Melt the butter, take off the scum, and pour the clear oil into the pan, taking care to allow none of the sediment from the melted butter to go in the pan. Separate the yolks from the whites of the eggs, add to the yolks the pinch of salt and sugar and beat them up. Whisk the whites with a clean whisk to a stiff froth. Have the butter hot in the pan. Mix the whites and yolks together and pour them into the pan. Stir as much butter as possible into them, until the eggs begin to set. Smooth over the top and allow to rise in the pan, then place the pan in a moderate oven to set the omelette firm and brown the top lightly. Remove from the oven, fold the omelette in two with a knife or slice. Place it on a warm dish, put the jam on each side, and serve immediately.

103 BOILED POTATOES. When boiling potatoes, if they are new put them on the fire in hot water, but if old potatoes are being boiled use cold water. Salt them when the water is boiling. See that the potatoes are regular in size before putting them in the pan, so that they will all be cooked at the same time. Average time to boil, twenty minutes. When cooked drain off the water, shake the pan, remove the lid to allow the steam to escape, and dry the potatoes over a slow heat before serving. POTATO CHIPS. Peel, wash, and chip the potatoes all the same length and thick- ness, have ready a pan containing plenty of hot, clean fat, drain the potatoes as dry as possible, and plunge them into the fat, taking care it well covers the potatoes. When nicely browned, turn out the potatoes on to clean paper to absorb the grease, shake them well with a little salt, serve garnished with a spray of parsley or fried bacon. POTATO SALAD. 1 lb. potatoes salt 2 tablespoonfuls salad oil 1 tablespoonful vinegar pepper Boil the potatoes in their jackets, allow them to go cold, remove the skins, slice them into a dish, put a little salt and pinch of pepper into a bowl, add a few drops of vinegar, then beat in thoroughly the oil and remaining vinegar alternately, a drop at a time. Pour over the potatoes, and serve. Garnish to taste. POTATO CROQUETTES. 2 lbs. mashed potatoes ozs. butter pepper salt 1 teaspoonful chopped parsley a little grated nutmeg 2 eggs When the potato is cold, add to it the seasonings and one egg. Pound all well together, and if too stiff add the remaining egg. Shape into balls, cones, pyramids, or any fancy shape. Eggwash and crumb, and fry a golden brown in deep hot fat. Drain on kitchen paper, dish up neatly on a dish paper, garnish to taste, and serve very hot.

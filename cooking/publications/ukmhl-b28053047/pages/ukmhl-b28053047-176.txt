170 the boil, and then draw aside to just simmer. Whisk the whites ot the eggs to a stiff froth, pour gradually into the whisked eggs the mixed cornflour, beating up all the time.

HOT WATER PASTE FOR RAISED PIES. 2 lbs. flour 10 ozs. lard i- pint boiling water salt Rub the lard in the flour, add a quarter teaspoonful salt, pour the boiling water into the flour, and mix to a paste. Use as directed. TO CLARIFY BUTTER. Place your butter in a clean saucepan on a slow fire and allow it to run to oil. Take care it does not boil, as butter burns very easily. Remove the scum from the top and pour off the clear oil. taking care that the milk}/ sediment is left in the pan and thrown away. FRIED BACON. Put the slices of bacon into a frying pan on the fire. When the fat appears to be transparent, turn the bacon over and allow it to fry gently for one or two minutes longer, according to the thickness of the slices, and serve. FRIED EGGS. Have a clean frying pan, not one in which bacon has just been fried, as the salt from the bacon will discolour the eggs. Put enough bacon fat in the pan to just cover the bottom and make this hot. Break the eggs into a cup and pour each carefully from the cup to the pan. Remember that should you have one bad egg broken into the pan, it will spoil any others that it touches. Eggs are sufficiently fried when one or two white spots appear on the yolk. When fried, lift them carefully with a slice on to a hot dish, and serve. TEA. When making tea, rinse the pot with boiling water to make it warm, then add the tea and pour over water which has just boiled, not that which has been boiling for an hour or more, allow to stand for ten minutes, and serve.

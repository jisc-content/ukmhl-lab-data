Serve hot. N.B.—Fussell’s unsweetened milk is excellent for all fricasses. GRILL. Practically all passenger steamers are now fitted with one or more grills, for grilling poultry, steak, kidneys, chops, and fish. With an apparatus of this kind grilling can be done to perfection. The bars can be raised or lowered at will, according to the temperature, from the fire. The grill illustrated here has a hot closet for plates, etc., but all grills are not so supplied. Cleanliness may easily be kept well to the foie with a grill of this description, as the grilling chamber is lined with white enamel, and the plates, grids, and gravy drainers are highly polished and plated.

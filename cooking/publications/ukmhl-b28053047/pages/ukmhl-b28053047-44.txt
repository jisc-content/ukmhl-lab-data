38 SOUPS. BONE STOCK. Stock is the liquid obtained by boiling all bones which are trimmed off beef, mutton, veal, poultry, etc., that cannot be utilised for producing a satisfactory dish for the table. The usual method of preparation is to place any bones that you may have into a large pan, cover them with cold water, and bring to the boil. Allow this to simmer gently all day, and as the liquid is taken away for using in soup, gravy, or sauces, as required, more water should be added to keep up the supply, and each day the surplus bones, etc., should also be added, so that nothing is wasted. The gelatinous substance is eventually all boiled out of the bones, and they are not then of any further use as food. The bone stock pot should be cleared of all old bones at least once a week in cold weather, and oftener in hot weather. Bones that have been sufficiently boiled can easily be distinguished by their very dull appearance when removed from the stock pot. Remember that the stock will have a milky appearance if the bones are boiled too long, and this kind of stock can not easily be clarified for clear soups. The stock must be boiled up each day, and no vegetables must be added, or the stock will very readily become sour.

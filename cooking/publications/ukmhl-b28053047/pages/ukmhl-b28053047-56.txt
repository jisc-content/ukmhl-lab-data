50 FISH. STEAMED SOLE 1 sole 1 teaspoonful butter 1 lemon (with Sauce). 1 tablespoonful cornflour or arrowroot pinch of salt Clean, skin, and fillet the fish. Roll up the fillets and place them on a plate. Sprinkle the fish with lemon juice, cover with another plate, and set in a steamer to steam for ten minutes. Break the bone of the fish and put it, with the skin also, into a pan, then add half-pint water and simmer for five minutes. Strain off the liquid and put it into a clean pan to boil. Add the butter. Mix the corn- flour or arrowroot with a little cold water, pour it gradually into the fish stock, stirring all the time. Add the salt and a few drops of lemon juice, simmer for three minutes, pour the sauce over the fishr and serve. Plaice may also be cooked as above. BOILED FISH. When boiling fish, salt the water and have it boiling before the fish is put into it. The fish may be boiled whole (after cleaning and washing), but if it is too large for the pan, a more convenient way is • to cut the fish into portions, each portion sufficient for one man, before putting it into the pan. After the fish is added, allow the water to come to the boil again, remove all the scum, which will' otherwise sink back, settle on the fish, and spoil its appearance, and then draw the pan to one side, and keep the water just below boiling: point. There will then be no danger of the fish becoming ‘ woolly/' FISH TO FRY. After it has been cleaned and washed the fish must be thoroughly I dried and dredged with flour. There are several ways of frying: { Two of the best ways are to either dip the fish into beaten egg anc afterwards in crumbs, or to dip the fish in batter made from flom and water of the consistency of cream. The fat in which fish i: j fried should be deep enough to completely cover the fish, and th« 1 fish must not be put into the fat until a blue vapour is seen rising | when the fat will be sufficiently heated.

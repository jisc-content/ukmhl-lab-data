99 JUGGED HARE roast hares 1 large onion 4 cloves 1 lemon 1 oz. arrowroot \ teaspoonful pepper 1 hare, or the cold remains of 2 -J- teaspoonful mixed herbs 1 piece cinnamon 2 inches long pinch of mixed spice a dust of nutmeg 1 pint port wine 1 pint stock or water 1 lb. steak (optional) 1 teaspoonful salt Cut the hare into neat joints, and if you are also using steak, -cut that in small pieces. Mix together the herbs, arrowroot, and pepper and salt, and roll each joint in the mixture. Peel the onion, stick in the cloves, and put all together in a deep jar. Cut the lemon in halves, put that in, and add the spice and cinnamon. Pour over all the stock and half of the port wine. Cover the jar to keep in the steam and flavour, and stand it in a baking tin con- taining boiling water, then put it in a hot oven for three and a half hours, or, if that method is inconvenient, stand it in a pan contain- ing boiling water, and keep the water boiling for the same time. At the end of that time have ready a few forcemeat balls (recipe below), put these in the jar with the remainder of the wine, and cook for another fifteen minutes. Then throw out the lemon, onion, cloves, and cinnamon. Arrange the pieces of hare neatly on a very hot dish, pour over the gravy, lay the forcemeat balls round, garnish the edge of the dish all round with slices of lemon, and serve with red currant jelly. Boil the liver five minutes, remove it from the pan, and mince finely. Chop the suet small, and add to it the crumbs, liver, parsley, lemon rind, and salt and cayenne pepper to taste. Beat the egg and milk together and moisten the forcemeat with it. Mix in the butter and continue mixing until all is a smooth paste. Make into balls the size of marbles and fry them a nice brown. Allow two to each person.

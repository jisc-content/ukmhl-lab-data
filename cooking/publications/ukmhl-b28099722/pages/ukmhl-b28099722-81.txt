PUDDINOS. 77 RICE PUDDING. 1 teacupful of Whole Rice. 1 table spoonful of Marmalade. 2 breakfast-cupfuls of Milk. 2 Eggs. 1 table spoonful of Sugar. Wash the rice well, and put it on to boil in a small pan with a breakfast-cupful of water. Let it boil for 5 minutes, then pour in the milk and allow it to boil for half an hour without stirring it. Take the pan from the fire and add the sugar and the marmalade, and stir well. Beat up the eggs and add them last, mixing all together; then pour into a pudding- dish, and bake in the oven or in front of the fire for half an hour. A handful of currants may be used instead of the marmalade, but they must first be washed and dried. RICE PUDDING WITHOUT EGGS. Â£ lb. Rice. 1 table spoonful of Suet. 1 table spoonful of Sugar. Nutmeg. 1 handful of Currants. 2 breakfast cupfuls of Milk, Wash the rice and put it either into a small pudding- dish or pudding-basin; chop up the suet and add it, also the sugar, a very little grated nutmeg, and a handful of currants well washed. Pour the milk over, and put it in a slow oven for an hour and a half; or cover the basin with a buttered paper, and place it in a sauce- pan with a little water, and steam for one hour. This pudding cooks anywhere near the fire, where the rice can get gradually heated and cooked. Skimmed milk does very well, as the suet supplies the want of fat both in the rice and the milk, and makes a very rich and good pudding at a small cost. The currants may be omitted.

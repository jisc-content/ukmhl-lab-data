Fresh herrings should not be washed, unless in ex- ceptional circumstances. They should be emptied, the heads taken off, the scales scraped off, and then the herrings well wiped. With a sharp knife, split the herring up the back and lay it open; cut it in half; lift the bone out, beginning at the head; now roll each half up into a nice firm roll, beginning at the head; from 6 herrings you will have 12 of those rolls. Stand them in a small pudding dish with the back uppermost—they will quite fill the dish. Now pour in half a teacupful of water and one-third of a teacupful of vinegar mixed, a bay leaf slipped in at the side, and the pepper and salt. Cover the dish over with a plate, and cook at the side of the fire, or in the oven, for half an hour. The herrings may be served in the dish in which they are cooked.

Prepare as above—namely, empty the herrings, take off the heads, scrape the scales off, and wipe them quite clean; then split them open from the back and lay them flat. Dust over them a little pepper and salt BAKED HERRINGS. 6 fresh Herrings. ^ teaspoonful Salt. £ teaspoonful Pepper. J teacupful Vinegar. 1 Bay Leaf. £ teacupful Water. FRIED FRESH HERRINGS.

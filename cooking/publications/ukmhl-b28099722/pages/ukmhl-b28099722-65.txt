6i VEGETABLES. BRUSSELS SPROUTS. 1 lb. Brussels Sprouts. 1 oz. Butter. Pepper and Salt. Put the sprouts in plenty of cold water to wash them well. Take each sprout and trim the stalk, cutting off any withered leaves on the outside, and put them in a basin of clean cold water. Have plenty of boiling water (salted), and a small pinch of carbonate of soda in it; drain the sprouts and put them in the pot to boil, with the lid off, for about ten minutes; drain them in a cullender, and return them to the pot with half an ounce of butter and a little pepper and salt. Shake them about in the pot gently to send the butter quite over them, dish them neatly in a pile on a dish, and serve. HARICOT BEANS BOILED. £ lb. Beans. 1 dessert spoonful of Dripping. £ oz.

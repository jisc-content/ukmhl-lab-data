115 SICK-ROOM BEVERAGES. Hot water is frequently used instead of cold, but the water is scarcely so clear and nice. In this case it must cool before being used. The water is put in the jug first and the bread put in, otherwise the bread gets crumbled. It is a most refreshing drink. BARLEY WATER. 2 oz. Barley. ^ Lemon Rind. 1 dessert-spoonful of Sugar. 1 quart Water. Wash the barley well, and put it in a saucepan with a quart of cold water; add the rind of half a lemon, very thinly pared off, and boil for half an hour, afterwards add the sugar, and strain into a jug to cool. CLEAR BARLEY WATER. 1 table-spoonful of Barley. 3 teacupfuls of Water. Small bit of Lemon Rind. 1 teaspoonful of Sugar. Wash the barley well, and put it in a jug with the lemon rind and sugar; pour over it 3 teacupfuls of boil- ing water, then cover the jug and stand to get cold, when it may be poured off for use. The barley in those recipes can be used again, as it is said to be better the second than the first time. RICE WATER. 3 oz. Whole Rice. 1 inch Stick Cinnamon. 1 quart Water. Sugar. Wash the rice well, and put it, with the water and cinnamon, into a sauce-pan to boil for an hour, then strain and put aside to cool, when sugar should be added to taste. This is a valuable remedy in cholera, dysen- tery, and similar sicknesses, but in those cases no sugar should be used.

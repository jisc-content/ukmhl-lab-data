129 WASHING AND IRONING. several days, always keeping the stains wet and soaped. A little fine chalk rubbed over the place while wet and in the air sometimes removes the stains, but chloride of lime, applied in the manner previously described, is the easiest way. MODEL WASHING. The day before the washing, look out all the articles that require to be washed, and arrange them in lots; mend what requires to be mended, and soak what should be soaked. Mix hot water and soap, in the proportion of a quarter of an inch from a bar of soap to a gallon of water, and a full dessert-spoonful of washing powder. (The soap is better to be melted beforehand.) Into this put body linen, shirts, and linen collars to soak all night. The bed linen may be soaked in cold water, or just put aside dry, waiting till its turn comes ; the laces and fine muslins tied up by themselves; flannels shaken well, and put together by themselves ; and window blinds and curtains put in cold water, to draw out the smoke that has gathered on them. Begin work early on the washing day. The best part of the day is the forenoon, and an hour gained in the morning is worth two later in the day. The first thing to do is to light the boiler-fire, and have plenty of hot water; add some of it to the soaked clothes. Wash them out carefully, removing all stains. The soaking will have rendered hard rubbing almost unnecessary. Put them into a second tub with warm water, and wash again, always beginning with the finest articles. Then have a tub with plenty of cold water in it; drop them into this, and let them lie in it a short time.

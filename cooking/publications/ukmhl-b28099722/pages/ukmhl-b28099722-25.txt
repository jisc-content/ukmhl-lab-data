SOUPS. 21 added. Keep boiling for a quarter of an hour then take out the bones and 3erve. To make stock for kidney soup, take all the marrow from the shin of beef and put it into a soup pot with 2 quarts of water. Bring it to the boil. Add the carrot, turnip, and onions, cut up into pieces, and allow all to boil at least 3 hours, when it must be strained. Take a fresh ox kidney, wash it well and dry it. Re- move all the fat from the middle, and cut up the kidney into half-inch pieces. Put the butter in a stew-pan and let it get quite brown, but not burnt; then put in the pieces of kidney and fry them all round. When quite fried, stir in a table-spoonful of flour and mix it well till the flour has absorbed all the moisture in the pan, then add a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful each of pepper, dry mustard, and sugar, stirring all till they become a paste in the pan. Now add 2 breakfast- cupfuls of water, and stir over the fire till it boils. Set it on a slow part of the fire, and allow it all to boil for at least 2 hours, stirring frequently. Return the strained stock to the pot, and add the kidney to it. Mix in a basin the corn-flour and a little water, and pour this also into the pot with enough of salt to season the whole, stirring occasionally till it boils, when the soup is ready. This soup, if well made, requires no artificial brown- ing; it may be made still browner by leaving the skins on the onions, which must be well washed. KIDNEY SOUP. 1 lb.

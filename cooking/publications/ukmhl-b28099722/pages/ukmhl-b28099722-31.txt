27 Fisa FISH PUDDING. 1 lb Fish. Potatoes. 1 Egg. Pepper and Salt. 1 oz. Butter. Take any remains of boiled fish; carefully remove the flesh from the bones, and cut it up into small dice, and have equal bulk of mashed potatoes. Put both into a basin and mix them together with a fork, then melt the butter and pour it in, mixing well; add salt and pepper and a few grains of cayenne pepper; beat up one egg and add it last; mix all well together; put it in a pudding-dish, smooth and score it neatly at the top, and bake for half an hour. The same mixture is very good made into small round cakes. Flour them well outside. Put a table-spoonful of dripping in a frying pan to get quite hot; put in a few cakes at a time to fry a brown colour on both sides. Then drain and serve. They are a breakfast dish.

PUDDINGS. S5 of melted and clarified butter, dripping, or salad oil, a salt-spoonful of salt, and a teacupful of tepid water. Those ingredients must be rubbed together very smoothly and carefully, and should be a good thick batter, to which add the whites of two eggs, beaten up very stiffly, and mix carefully with the batter. Apple Fritters.—Peel the apples, and with a sharp- pointed knife take out the cores and slice the apples across, \ of an inch thick. Have a pan with plenty of dripping or lard heated till it begins to smoke; and after dipping the slices of apples into the batter, in order to cover them with it, lift them out into the hot fat, and fry till they become a pale brown colour; then sprinkle sugar over them on a plate, and serve very hot. Orange Fritters.—After taking the skin off, cut the orange in slices across, or divide it into its natural divisions, and dip each piece in the batter; then with a spoon lift them into the hot fat, and fry them a pale brown colour. Fritters should be put on soft paper or a kitchen towel for a few minutes, to drain the fat off, after which sprinkle sugar over them, and serve very hot. Slices of meat, tripe, fish, etc., are cooked in a similar way, only sprinkle salt over them instead of sugar. The same batter may be used. STEWED PRUNES. 1 lb. common Prunes. 1 small Lemon, i lb. Sugar. Water. If the prunes are very hard soak them for 2 hours in warm water. All the cheaper kinds of prunes are the better of being thus soaked.

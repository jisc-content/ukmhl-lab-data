90 COOKERY RICE AND CHEESE. J lb. Common Rice. 1 oz. Butter. 2 oz. Cheese. 1 pint Skim Milk. Mustard. Pepper and Salt. Wash the rice well, and put it on with plenty of cold water to boil, when the water must be poured off and replaced with the milk, in which allow it to boil till it is cooked enough, but not too pulpy. It should boil very slowly. Grate 2 oz. of cheese, and add half of it to the rice, along with a pinch of salt, a little pepper, and half a teaspoonful of made mustard; turn it out on a pudding- dish, and sprinkle the remainder of the cheese on the top ; then place on it half an ounce of butter in little bits, and brown before the fire. This is an excellent way of using rinds of cheese, or hard pieces which it is difficult otherwise to use, as the hard part near the rind grates best, besides it is a most nutritious and savoury dish. Mix in a small basin the flour, salt, pepper, mustard, and grated cheese. Melt the butter, and mix it with a teacupful of warm water and the yolk of the egg ; beat all up and stir it gradually in among the flour, etc. Beat up the white of the egg stiffly, and stir it in last of all. Drop the mixture in dessert-spoonfuls among hot fat, and fry it like other fritters till it is a nice brown. They must be turned in the pan to brown both sides. CHEESE FRITTERS J lb. Flour, i lb.

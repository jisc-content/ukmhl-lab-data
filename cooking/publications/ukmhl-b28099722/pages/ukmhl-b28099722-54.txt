COOKERY. 50 A GOOD BREAKFAST DISH 4 lbs. Pork. 1 Pig’s Tongue, Sage. Onions. Pepper. Take a piece of pickled pork, the thin part of the belly, which should be about eight or nine inches broad, and rather more than that long; take out the bones and flatten it a little; get a good pig’s tongue which, like the pork, has been salted for a few days; sprinkle on the pork a few leaves of sage chopped finely, and a middling-sized onion chopped; also some pepper. Roll the tongue up in the middle of the pork into a nice roll; bind it outside with a long slip of calico, rolled round neatly and tightly. Put it on covered with cold water, and boil gently for four or five hours, allowing it to become nearly cold in the water, and when quite cold remove the bandage. Chop up any kind of cooked meat very finely. On the table where it was chopped, mix with it a table-spoonful of flour, a teaspoonful of salt, and a little pepper. Put nearly a teacupful of water uito a pan, and a table-spoonful of ketchup, or a little gravy if to be had; add the mixture of meat and flour, and stir over the fire till it comes to boiling heat, when the SAUSAGE ROLLS. 1 lb. Flour. \ lb. Dripping. 1 teaspoonful Baking Powder. £ lb. Cold Meat. Ketchup. 1 Egg. Pepper and Salt.

This loosens the grease, and saves rubbing, which wears out material very much. Window blinds, and anything that is smoked, should be allowed to soak in cold water and wrung out again. © © Flannels are best washed in tepid water, in which is mixed a little melted soap and washing powder. For this purpose it is profitable to cut down thinly a few pounds of yellow soap, and melt it in a pot with water in the proportion of about 1 lb. of soap to 6 breakfast-cupfuls of water. Flannels should be rubbed as little as possible, as rubbing causes them to shrink. Very hot water has the same effect, and unites with the soap to discolour flannel. Coloured flannels and strips of sofa blankets should be washed in barely tepid water, in which a good piece of ammonia and a handful of melted soap has been dis- solved, and dried quickly thereafter.

37 STEWING AND ROASTING OF MEAT. it to stew for a quarter of an hour; then add two onions, and a pretty large carrot cut in quarters lengthways, and a little salt, and stew for an hour. Take off the string from the steak, and place it on a dish; arrange the vegetables neatly round, and pour the sauce over. Put into a pot the dripping, and let it get hot; then slice the onions, and fry them gently in it. Wash the mutton well, and put it in the pot with the clean water that hangs about it. Put the lid instantly and closely on the pot, and let it stew slowly for three-quarters of an hour. Take a nice firm cabbage, wash it, remove the withered leaves, and cut it into eight pieces lengthways, like the divisions of an orange; place the cabbage in water; peel 6 potatoes and cut them in slices half an inch thick, and place them also in the water. When the meat has stewed for three-quarters of an hour, lift the cabbage, dripping with water, and the potatoes, and pack both round the meat; sprinkle over them a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper, and replace the lid closely and quickly, and stew for three-quarters of an hour. It must be cooked slowly, else it will burn. The whole is cooked by steam, and is a most delicious as well as profitable dish. DUTCH STEW, l£ lbs.

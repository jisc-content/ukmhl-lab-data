STEWING AND ROASTING OF MEAT. 45 SCOTCH COLLOP. 1 lb. Steak. 1 oz. Butter or Dripping. 1 oz. Flour Pepper and Salt. 3 Onions. Take a pound of shoulder-steak, cut very thinly; put in a stew-pan an ounce of butter or dripping, and let it get quite hot; then put in the steak cut in pieces about 3 inches square or so; let this fry well on both sides till the outside is crisp; sprinkle in a table-spoonful of flour; stir it round till it has mixed well, then add the onions, either cut in rings or chopped up, some pepper and salt, three-quarters of a pint of water, and stir until it boils up; after that let it simmer very slowly for an hour and a half. This stew should be kept quite below boiling point until it is done, as boiling hardens the meat. Have a nice piece of the thick part of the hough, about 4 or 5 lbs.; take all the marrow from the bone, cut it in little bits, and put in a stew-pan on the fire. After the marrow has become quite hot, put in the piece of meat and fry it brown all round, particularly at the ends, to shut up the pores of the meat; when quite well fried, pour off any remains of fat in the pot and add a pint of water; put the lid closely on and allow it to stew very slowly for an hour; now add a carrot cut in quarters, a turnip neatly cut, and two HOUGH OF BEEF STEWED, Hough of Beef. Carrot. Turnip. Onions.

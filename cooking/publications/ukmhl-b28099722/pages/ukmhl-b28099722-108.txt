Put the flour into a basin with the sugar and 1^- tea- spoonfuls of baking powder, and mix all together. Add the butter, and crumble it down till the whole is like bread-crumbs; also add the orange peel cut in dices about the size of a pea. Beat up three eggs in a basin, and add them to the other ingredients, keeping back about a table-spoonful, and mix well. Now add a little butter milk, but only enough to wet the ingredients in the basin, as the paste must be very stiff; use a spoon and stir till thoroughly mixed and wet. Grease a flat tin and take a piece of the paste, about the size of an egg; roll it round like a ball and place it on the tin, and repeat till all the paste is used up. Use a little flour to keep the hands from sticking. Keep the buns two inches apart, and brush the tops over with the egg kept back for this purpose, and put a few pieces of lump sugar, broken in small pieces, on the top of each. Bake in a smart oven for about 15 minutes, till they are a nice brown colour, and sufficiently cooked. $ lb. Butter.

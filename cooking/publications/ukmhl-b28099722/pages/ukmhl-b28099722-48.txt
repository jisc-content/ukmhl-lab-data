44 COOKERY. and into this put the ends of some leaf-shaped pieces of paste, with au ornament in the centre; egg the leaves and bake. After the crust begins to brown, cover it with a buttered paper, and bake for an hour and a half. STEAK AND ONIONS FRIED. 1 lb. Steak. Ketchup. Flour. Pepper and Salt. 3 Onions. Take three onions, slice them in rings, and put them in a small basin of cold water to soak for an hour to take away some of the strong flavour. Now take a large frying-pan, and put in it an ounce of suet chopped up, or dripping, and, after allowing it to get hot, put in the steak (which should be fully half an inch thick) to fry. It should be on a very moderate fire, and turned very often till it is cooked, which it will be in about eight minutes. If it is firm to the touch when pressed, it is ready. The onions should be drained and put between the folds of a towel to dry, then put in the pan with the steak if there is room, and fried at the same time; they should have a little colour, without being over- browned. The steak is dished up with the onions round it. Put in the pan a teaspoonful of flour, sprinkled in, a table-spoonful of ketchup, pepper and salt, and a teacupful of water; stir them till they boil, and strain the sauce over the steak. The flour and the ketchup may be omitted.

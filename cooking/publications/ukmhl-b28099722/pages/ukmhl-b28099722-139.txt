Ingredients required :â€”Starch, composite candle, sper- maceti, turpentine, boiling water. Warm a basin well with boiling water, and pour it out again. Put into the basin 4- table-spoonfuls of starch, and rub it down to rather a thick paste with warm water; add an inch of a small-sized composite candle, a bit of sperma- ceti, size of a small bean, and 4 drops of turpentine. Pour boiling water into the basin slowly, stirring very vigorously till the starch is cooked sufficiently, which is known by its becoming transparent. It ought to be a good thickness, not in the least watery. This is the proper thickness of starch to use for shirr,s, collars, etc. Have your linen rather damp. Dip in the breasts and collars of shirts first, and squeeze them tightly out. The wrists next. Repeat till all are finished, taking care to use the starch at once, and very hot, as it quickly becomes thick, and is not so easily used. Then give the starched parts a slight rub, clap them, and hang them up to dry thoroughly. When quite dry sprinkle over with clean cold water, to damp them thoroughly. Place the two sides of the breast together, fold, and roll up tightly for at least i day, when they are ready for ironing. In warm weather, after damping, roll all up in a damp cloth and put away.

PUDDINGS. 81 chopped, salt, baking powder, and a teaspoonful of sugar up into a paste with either sweet or butter milk, which roll out rather thinly and line the basin as described in recipe for “ Boiled Meat Pudding.” Pare and cut up the apples, also wash and dry the currants. Put a few apples in the bottom of the basin, then a little sugar, a few currants, and a little of the marma- lade. Eepeat till the dish is full and all the ingredients used up. Cover with paste, and tie a wet pudding cloth over as previously directed, and place in plenty of boiling water to boil for two hours. N.B.—Water may be used instead of milk to make the paste. Pare 6 good-sized and firm apples, and take the cores out with an old penknife, so as not to break the apple. Put in a basin one pound flour, ^ lb. suet chopped very finely, a teaspoonful baking powder, and ^ teaspoonful of salt, which mix thoroughly, rubbing out any lumps in the suet with the fingers. Mix into a paste with cold water, and divide it into 6 equal-sized pieces, then take one of the pieces and make it round like an apple, flatten it in your hand, put the apple on the top of it, and fill the core with sugar till the hole is quite full; now work the paste up over and round the apple, closing it at the top, and leaving no crack or mark where the paste is fastened.

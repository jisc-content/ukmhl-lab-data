106 COOKERY. DROPPED SCONES. 1 full breakfast-cupful Flour. 1 breakfast-cupful Butter Milk. 2 teaspoonfuls Soft Sugar. f teaspoouful Carbonate ot Soda. I teaspoonful Tartaric Acid. Mix in a basin the flour, sugar, carbonate of soda, and tartaric acid, rubbing the lumps of the soda well out before putting it in. Then add gradually the butter milk, beating it well with the back of a spoon for a few minutes. Have ready and clean a hot griddle or iron plate, which rub over with a rind of bacon or a piece of suet. Put the mixture out in spoonfuls (one spoonful makes a scone), taking care that they are a neat round shape. When the scones are covered with bubbles on the top turn them over with a broad knife. When they are a light brown colour on both sides they are ready, but they should not be turned twice. CREAM SCONES. 1^ breakfast cupfuls of Flour. I 1 teaspoouful of Sugar. Piece of Butter size of Egg, or 1 teaspoonful Baking Powder. J that size if Cream is used. | 1 Cup of Sweet Milk or Cream. Put the flour into a basin, with the baking powder and sugar. Add the butter, and rub it in till it is quite powdered in the flour, then make the whole into a paste with the milk. Divide it in two pieces. Take one piece and roll it out quite thin and round. Cut the edges smooth and even, then cut in eight, similar to the divisions of a wheel. Have a perfectly clean griddle very warm. Bake about 5 minutes altogether, turning the scones once. If cream can be had instead of the milk the butter is unnecessary, or only a small bit need be used.

The breath exhaled carries off a part of the waste of our bodies ; but our skin is covered with millions of small openings called sweat glands, and through those openings the blood sends a great portion of the waste of the body, just like the ashes dropping from a fire; and if the body is not washed frequently to keep the skin clean, the poi'es get filled up with sweat, and the blood is gradually poisoned. So that people must wash frequently, not only to look nice, but to keep the sweat glands open and allow the waste of the body to escape. Garments worn during the day next the skin, particularly flannel, should not be worn at night, as the dead organic matter coming out of the pores is sent back into the skin again, and is very unwholesome.

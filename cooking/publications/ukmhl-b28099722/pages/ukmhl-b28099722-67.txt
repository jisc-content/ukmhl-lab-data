VEGETABLES. 63 the skin is broken, and the juices allowed to flow into the water in the pot; and a potato roasted in its skin is by far the lightest and most digestible way in which to prepare it for an invalid. Potatoes are really best to be boiled in their skins, although there are two exceptions to this rule—one is when the potatoes are unripe, when they just come in; and the second is when they are old and out of season, in the spring and early summer. In the first of those cases, the potato is very watery, being unripe, and is best to have the skin scraped off and put in boiling water and boiled rapidly, as this draws out some of the water and makes the potato better food. In the second case, the potato acquires a bitter taste when it gets old, and is better pared and even soaked for a short time in cold water, before boiling in the usual way. Potatoes, however, should never be soaked longer than an hour or two, as one of the principal components of the potato is starch, and with soaking in water the starch gradually loosens, comes out into the water, and is lost, as may be seen in the white sediment that remains in the bottom of a basin in which the potatoes have been soaked. A few simple rules may be given now for the boiling of the potatoes :— 1. Select the potatoes all one size, or as nearly as possible. It is impossible to boil small and large potatoes properly together. 2. Barely cover the potatoes with water. 3. Add as much salt as tastes the water. 4. Bring them slowly to the boil. 5. Boil the potatoes slowly; the larger the potatoes are the slower they should be boiled, because the heat

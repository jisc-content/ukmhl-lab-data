The writer, having been for many years engaged in teaching Cookery, has compiled this book as the result of her practical experience, with a desire to put into the hands of housekeepers a guide to Household Cookery and Laundry Work, and a few hints on Household Management. Having fully tested all the recipes given, she can with confidence recommend them on account of their correctness, as well as for their sim- plicity and economy. Having been engaged for many years teaching Cookery in Schools, the writer has made it an endea- vour to adapt her instructions so as to supply a text-book alike suitable for Junior and Senior Classes.

COOKERY. 34 up, the more tender and digestible the meat will be. Flesh that is fried should not be over-cooked, as, in that case, it gets dry and indigestible. Pork takes a longer time, either to roast or fry, than other flesh; and it should always be well cooked, as> when underdone, is very disagreeable and unwholesome. White flesh of all kinds, either of animals or fowls, takes a longer time than brown, and requires to be more thoroughly cooked. OX-TAIL STEWED. 1 Ox-tall Flour. Ketchup. Dripping. 1 Onion. Carrot and Turnip. Pepper and Salt. Wash the tail well in warm water, and cut it up at the joints; the larger joints may be cut in two. Dry the pieces well, and mix on a plate a table-spoonful of flour, a teaspoonful of salt, and half a teaspoonful of pepper. Rub each piece of tail over with this mixture. Put into a stew-pan a table-spoonful of dripping, and let it get quite hot; then fry the pieces of tail all round in it, and lift them out when done. Pour out the fat that remains, and return the pieces of tail to the pan with the onion chopped up, 2 breakfast-cupfuls of water, and the ketchup, and stew gently for an hour and a half. Cut the carrot and turnip into very neat pieces, add them, and stew for three-quarters of an hour longer. If well and slowly cooked, this is a delightful stew, as the ox-tail contains a great deal of gelatine. Dish the meat in the centre of a dish with the vege- tables round it.

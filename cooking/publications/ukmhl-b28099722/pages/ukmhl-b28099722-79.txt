PUDDINGS. 75 sugar in a basin and beat them to a cream; add the eggs and beat smooth; then add the flour, in which should be mixed half a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda. Mix till smooth and add a table-spoonful of strawberry or raspberry jam; pour into a buttered mould, which cover with a piece of greased paper, and steam gently for an hour and a half. Turn out and serve with arrow- root sauce. Put a pint and a quarter of milk in a nice clean sauce- pan to boil; then sprinkle in the semolina and boil, stirring constantly for five minutes or rather more • then add the sugar and the butter, and mix well. Allow it to stand a few minutes in the sauce-pan to cool, then beat up the eggs and stir them in, mixing thoroughly; add a little flavouring to taste (a little grated orange rind or lemon are very pleasant for flavouring. Have a plain mould well buttered, and ornamented with cherries or raisins; pour the pudding in, and cover it with buttered paper and steam for an hour; then turn out gently. Ground rice is made into a pudding in precisely the same way and in the same proportions. Almond flavour- ing is good with rice, or a bay leaf boiled with the milk. SEMOLINA PUDDING. £ lb.

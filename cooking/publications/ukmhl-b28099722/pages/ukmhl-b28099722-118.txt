114 COOKERY. LEMONADE. Peel a lemon thinly, and put the peel in a jug; take the white skin off and slice the pulp into the jug; add 2 oz. of sugar, and pour over all a pint and a half of boiling water. Cover the jug, and let it stand till cold; then strain into tumblers. This is made effervescent by the addition in the tumbler of a quarter of a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda. LEMONADE, WITHOUT LEMON. 1 oz. Cream of Tartar. 1 teaspoonful Essence of 2 oz. Sugar. Lemon. This can be made when lemons are not to be had. Put the cream of tartar in a jug with the lemon essence and sugar; pour over it 2 pints boiling water, and let it stand to cool. BLACK CURRANT JAM WATER. 2 table-spoonfuls Jam. Put the jam in a nice clean sauce-pan with a pint of water, and allow it to simmer for half an hour; then strain, and drink it as hot as possible; but if to allay thirst, it is better cold. For a sore throat an additional spoonful of jam should be used. TOAST AND WATER. Toast the quarter of a slice of bread till it is quite brown in every part without being in the least burned. Have a jug, with three breakfast-cupfuls of cold water in it, into which put the bread, and allow it to stand for a few hours

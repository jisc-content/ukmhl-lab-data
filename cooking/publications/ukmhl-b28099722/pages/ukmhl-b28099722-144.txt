Afterwards the room ought to be carefully dusted with a clean, well-shaken dustei*. Once a week each room should have a thorough cleaning in every corner.

This breath is poisonous, and has often caused death; if per- sons must be in such a close space that no fresh air can be admitted, they are poisoned very quickly by the im- pure air they exhale. This impure air is much lighter than pure air, and ascends to the roof of a room first. The simplest way to ventilate a room is to have the window open a little at the top, to allow the impure air to escape, the space will then be filled with pure air, which will rush in under doors, at keyholes, and every available opening.

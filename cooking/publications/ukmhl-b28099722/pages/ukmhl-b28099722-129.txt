PRESERVES. 125 extremely slender chips ; then put those chips on in a small sauce-pan, with 2 breakfast-cupfuls of water, to boil slowly for half an hour. Remove all the skin from the oranges, break the pulp up a good deal, and put it in a jelly-pan with 5 break- fast-cupfuls of water to boil gently for half an hour, stirring occasionally; then pour all this into a pointed flannel bag, and let it drain thoroughly. Put all the liquid thus obtained, the chips, the liquid in which they were boiled, and 5 lbs. of sugar, on in a clean jelly-pan; stir, and allow it to boil for a quarter of an hour; then skim and pot. CANDIED PEEL. Skins of 6 Oranges or Lemons. | 1 lb. Crystallised Sugar. Put the skins in salt and water to soak for a few days; then put them on in a saucepan, with fresh cold water, to boil till they are quite soft, which is known by the head of a pin being easily put in. Remove them from the saucepan, drain, and put them in a basin. Boil a pound of sugar and a breakfast-cupful of water for a few minutes, and pour it over the peel in the basin, and allow it to stand thus for about a week. Pour the syrup into the saucepan and allow it to boil up; put the peel in and let it boil gently till it looks clear, which will be in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes. Take it out and spread it on a dish, put a little of the syrup in the hollows, dust some fine sugar over, and put it in the sun or a warm place till dry and candied. When dry put away in a jar.

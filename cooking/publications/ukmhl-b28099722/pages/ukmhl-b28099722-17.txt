13 SOUPS. Half of a can of tomatoes boiled with the beans for the last half hour, and all rubbed through the strainer, makes a delightful change in this soup, and adds greatly to its valuable properties. The milk is left out when tomatoes are used. Beans have much the same component parts as cheese, and are almost as strengthening in every respect as beef. Their only want is fat, but the bacon or butter supplies that. Take 1 lb. of lentils and wash them thoroughly in many waters until they are perfectly clean; soak them for a night in cold water; then put them into a pot with the water in which they are soaked and as much more as makes quarts, or 10 breakfast- cupfuls. When this boils, add carrot, turnip, parsnip, 2 large onions, all cut up roughly, and a small pinch of carbonate of soda about the size of a pea. Allow it to boil 2 hours, then strain through a cullender, washing the lentils all through except the skins; return it to the pot to warm. Season with pepper and salt, and serve. Lentil soup is delightful if nicely made, and requires no meat of any kind, or bones, as it has the taste and the good properties of butcher meat to a large extent in itself. LENTIL SOUP. 1 lb.

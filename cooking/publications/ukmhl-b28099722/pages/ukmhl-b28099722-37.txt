STEWING AND ROASTING OF MEAT. 33 good deal further back, and cooked more slowly. The secret of having meat well roasted is to have an even heat, and to baste it very frequently. Basting keeps the meat from drying up, and the action of the fire on the hot fat with which it is basted keeps the surface of the meat well crusted over, and all the juice retained in the joint. Broiling or grilling is really just roasting a small slice of meat instead of a large piece. It certainly is not a very economical mode of cooking, but, if well done and not over-cooked, is very easily digested and nourishing. The principle is exactly the same as roasting :—Let the meat be put on a hot gridiron over a clear hot fire for a minute or two to shut up the pores, turning both sides to the fire ; afterwards a little slower, to cook it to the heart. Eight or ten minutes is enough to grill steak nearly an inch thick; of course a little depends upon the fire, but no grilling is well executed unless the fire is clear and quite free from smoke. Both roasted and broiled meat are spoiled if over-done. Broiled meat should be turned very often, and thus bastes itself, just as roasted meat requires to be basted. Frying and frying-pans have been very much abused of late years; and one hears of “dirty frying-pans and greasy messes,” but there is no need for the frying-pan to be dirty, or the food greasy; and for certain kinds of flesh and fish, frying is a very good mode of cooking. Almost without exception, the rule above applied to roasting and stewing applies to frying. The meat to be fried should be put either on a hot pan to shut up the pores, or in hot fat for the same purpose. This has always the effect of retaining the juices in the meat, and consequently making it more tender. The more the juices belonging4 to fish, flesh, or fowl are bottled

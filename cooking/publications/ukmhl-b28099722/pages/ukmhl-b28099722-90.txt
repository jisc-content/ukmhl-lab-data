COOKERY 86 Put into a pan } lb. of sugar, a breakfast-cupful of water, the lemon juice, also the rind of half a lemon thinly pared, and bring all to the boil. Drain off the water the prunes are soaked in, and put them in the pan, which cover up, and stew gently for one hour at least, but longer if they are very hard ; then pick out the pieces of lemon peel and serve. The lemon is a very great improvement to this dish, both as to the flavour and good properties of the prunes. French plums require no soaking and much shorter time to stew. When the stones slip easily out the plums are ready. CUSTARD To use with Stewed Prunes or other Stewed Fruit. 2 breakfast cupfuls of Milk. 2 Eggs. 1 dessert spoonful of Corn Flour. 1 table-spoonful of Sugar. 2 Bay Leaves. Ground Cinnamon. Put the milk with the bay leaves or a small bit ot lemon rind on the fire to come very slowly to the boil, then mix the corn flour with a little cold milk, which add and boil for one minute. After picking out the leaves, beat up the eggs and pour the boiling mixture over them, stirring all the time. Return the whole to the pan and stir over the fire till it thickens, but it must not boil. Pour into a nice dish and sprinkle a little ground cinnamon over the top. This custard may be served in either cups, glasses, or a glass dish.

137 WASHING AND IRONING. Dip the lace in the starch, and squeeze it out. Clap it between the folds of a towel to partially dry it. It is always ironed on the wrong side. Place it on the table slightly picked out, and place a piece of muslin over it. Rub a cool iron over it several times, till it is a little dry. Take up the lace now, and with the fingers pick it out nicely to show the pattern and the edge as it was originally. Pass the iron over it again. Then pick out the lace once more, and carefully draw it to each side, and give it a final ironing. The iron used must be very cool, else the lace will be too stiff; but moving it about in the hands, and drawing it out, makes it flexible. Lace may also be washed and dressed thus:â€” Stitch a piece of muslin firmly round a bottle or piece of wood; tack the lace to this, winding it round the bottle, and cover it with thin muslin. Then let it soak for a time in melted soap and warm water, pouring the water over it; if very dirty, it may be steamed at the side of the fire, then rinsed, blued, and dipped in water in which a little rice has been boiled; finally, hung up to dry. When unwound from the bottle, it has only to be picked out a little, and either pressed between the covers of a book or ironed with a very cool iron on the wrong side.

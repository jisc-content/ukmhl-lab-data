PUDDINGS. 69 stant food of infants, as it does not develop the muscles and flesh sufficiently. Boiled or baked flour is much better food for infants than corn flour. Puddings are much lighter steamed than boiled. Steaming means that a very little water is put into a pot or pan, having a close lid. When the water boils the pudding is put in, and it cooks in the steam. There should only be enough water to keep steam in the pot; but care must be taken that it does not all evaporate, and the pudding as well as the pot get burned. Boiling means that a pudding is either covered with a cloth or lid, and plunged overhead in boiling water, and cooked so for the necessary time. This generally makes a pud- ding heavier and less digestible. A lid is particularly to be avoided, as it so hermetically seals the pudding that none of the gas engendered by the cooking escapes, and it cannot be either so light or wholesome. Puddings with suet, much butter, or fat of any kind, are greatly improved by having a sauce served with them; as cold milk or cream are liable to congeal the fat, and render it unpleasant. A few recipes for Pud- ding Sauces will be given in their place.

Then with a fork whisk it up till it forms a pulp. Beat up the eggs and stir them in, mixing well; to which

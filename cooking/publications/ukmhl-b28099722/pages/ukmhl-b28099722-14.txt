10 INTRODUCTION. CARBONACEOUS OR BODY-WARMING FOODS. Animal. Butter. Suet. Oil. Fat. Vegetable. Sugar. Treacle. Rice. All starchy foods. MINERAL FOODS. Green Vegetables. Wheat and OatmeaL Water, Milk. Those three constituents which ought to enter into the daily food of all, are to be found in plain ordinary materials, and, as will be seen by the foregoing table, in vegetable as well as in animal food. Animal food is by no means an absolute necessity, and may, with advantage to health in many cases, be entirely dispensed with. The nitrogenous principle in vegetable food is not so concentrated as in animal food, and consequently a larger bulk is required to procure the same amount of strength. Persons who have plenty of work or exercise in the open air, can easily consume sufficient vegetable food for all purposes of life and health; whereas for persons who lead sedentary lives, a smaller bulk of more concentrated food will probably be found more beneficial. The combination of eggs, milk, butter, and cheese, with vegetables, makes a dietary that is quite sufficient for life and health; and it is questionable whether it is not really the best sort of food for all.

112 COOKERY. APPLE FOOL. 4 Apples. Sponge Cake. 1 dessert-spoonful of Sugar. 1 Egg. Bake 4 nice apples till quite soft, and scrape the pulp out; add to it the sugar and a small slice of sponge cake crumbled up, and one egg well beaten. Whisk all together with a fork, stir over the fire till it gets hot, then dish it nicely, and use either hot or cold. FLOUR FOR INFANTS’ FOOD. To Boil.—Fill a breakfast-cup or small bowl quite full with flour, using the knuckles to press it down tightly. Tie a cloth over the top and plunge it in a pot of boiling water, and boil continuously for 4 hours. The cloth is then removed, the outside scraped off, and the flour put into a jar for use. To Bake.—Put the flour into a basin in the same manner, and bake in the oven for 4 hours. The brown outside in this case is scraped off, and the flour used in the same way. The baking or boiling of the flour prevents it becoming acid on the stomach, and it is more nourishing for infants than corn flour. It should be prepared as corn flour is. Boil the rice and milk together, stirring till it gets thick. After allowing it to cool, add an ounce of butter, an ounce of sugar, and a little grated nutmeg, and bake for half an hour. RICE PUDDING. 3 oz. Rice. 1 pint Milk. Butter. Sugar. Nutmeg.

PRESERVES. 123 minutes, pour all into a pointed flannel jelly-bag, and allow it to drain quite dry. Measure the juice, and to each pint of juice add 1 lb. of sugar; put the pan on the fire, and stir frequently till it boils, allowing it to boil for 10 minutes; then skim and pot. RED CURRANT JELLY. 4 lbs. Currants. | 1 lb. Raspberries. | Sugar. Pick the larger stalks and leaves from the currants and raspberries, and wash the currants in cold water. Put all on in a jelly-pan with 4 breakfast-cupfuls of water, and allow them to heat gradually to boiling point, stirring frequently, then let them boil gently for about 10 minutes. Pour the whole into a pointed flannel jelly-bag to drain till all the juice has run out without pressure. Measure the juice, and to each pint allow 1 lb. of sugar, and add half a pound more. Put this on the fire, and stir frequently till it boils; allow it to boil for 5 minutes, then skim and pot. Three black currant leaves, added to this quantity and boiled with the currants at first, gives a fine flavour; in that case, leave out the raspberries. The currants may be put in the pan again with a little more water and heated; then squeezed through a coarse linen cloth, and boiled in the same way with sugar, which makes a secondary kind of jelly. A pint is 2 very small breakfast-cupfuls. Crystallised sugar is best for preserves.

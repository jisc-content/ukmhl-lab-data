97 CAKES AND BAKING. when that is the case increase the weight of the yeast used. Yeasts of all kinds require a warm temperature to encourage fermentation, or in other words to make them “rise,” consequently the secret of making bread light is to have everything connected with it warm during the process of baking. Bake in a warm place, set it to rise in a warm place, and from beginning to end of the process let the bread get no chill. Setting the bread to rise on a kitchen fender is not a good plan at all, as the fire always draws a current of air from the door or window, and consequently must chill the outside of the basin with the dough or the loaves when set to rise. The best way is to set them up near the fire and quite out of the draught. The temperature of the oven for baking bread should be about 260°. 1 Pinch Salt.

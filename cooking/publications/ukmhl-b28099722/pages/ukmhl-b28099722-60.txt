Chop up the cooked meat and the onion (also cooked) very finely, and season with pepper and salt.

Turn the whole out on the table, and add as much flour as the potatoes will take up, and roll the potato paste out about a quarter of an inch thick. Cut it into pieces about 6 inches square. Place on each piece a spoonful of the chopped meat; wet the edges, and double the paste over one side above the other, and press the ends down. Place those oblong rolls on a greased tin, and bake till they become a light brown colour, or fry them in hot fat in a frying-pan.

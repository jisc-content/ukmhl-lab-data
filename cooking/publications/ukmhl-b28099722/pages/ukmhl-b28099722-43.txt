STEWING AND ROASTING OF MEAT. 39 BREAST OF VEAL STUFFED AND ROLLED. Breast of Veal. 1 Egg. £ lb. Bacon Ham. Pepper and Salt. Breakfast-cupful grated Bread. Take a fore quarter of half-fed veal, or the thin part of the breast of fed veal, weighing about 5 or 6 lbs. Remove all the bones, taking care not to break the outside skin. Take off all the rough or uneven pieces of the veal in the inside and mince them up as finely as possible; mince also the ham finely—it should not be too fat. Put the chopped meat, ham, grated bread, half a teaspoonful each ofj pepper and salt in a basin, and, with the hand, mix them thoroughly together; beat up an egg well, add it, and mix well. Lay the veal out on a table with the skin next the table; spread the stuffing neatly over the surface of the meat, leaving an inch bare all round; then roll it up tightly, and either sew it up or tie it in several places with broad tape. Put a teaspoonful of butter into a stew-pan large enough to hold it, and when hot, put in the roll of veal and fry it all round; add an onion chopped up, then put in a breakfast-cupful of water and stew gently for two hours. Take it up and untie the fastenings. The gravy should be thickened with a dessert-spoonful of flour, seasoned with a table-spoonful of ketchup and a little salt and pepper, and strained over the veal. To Bake the Roll. The veal may be put into a roasting pan with a breakfast-cupful of boiling water, covered with another pan or dish, and put into the oven for an hour and a half. It is very nice done thus. The gravy must be thickened and poured over. It is good either hot or cold.

SICK-ROOM COOKERY. Sick nursing is even more essentially women’s work than housekeeping, and requires knowledge, combined with tenderness and care, a feeling heart, and skilful hands. Fresh air is most essential to a sick-room, as many forms of sickness cause the air to become very impure, and impure air, being lighter than pure, ascends to the roof of the room; therefore let the window be open a little at the top to permit the foul air to escape. A good fire is also necessary in order to keep up the tem- perature, as well as to induce a current of fresh air. Cleanliness in the arrangement of the room is as essential as fresh air; and in the cooking and serving of food great care ought to be taken that everything is so nicely arranged that the fastidious eye of the invalid may be refreshed and the appetite stimulated. A rustling dress or a heavy foot should never enter a sick room, nor a loud voice be heard. A sick person’s nerves are morbidly acute, and trifling noises that would not be noticed in health cause positive pain to an invalid. The food of the sick should be varied as much as possible, and prepared in the very best manner that the materials will admit of. Beef tea particularly requires skilful preparation, as life and returning health often depend upon it. Nice toast or grated bread may be used with beef tea, as well as other things of the same kind.

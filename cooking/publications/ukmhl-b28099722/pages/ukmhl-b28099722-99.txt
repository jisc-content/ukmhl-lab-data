95 CAKES AND BAKING. The following tests for trying the temperature of the oven may be found useful:â€” 1. If a sheet of paper burns when thrown in, the oven is too hot. 2. When the paper becomes dark brown, it is suitable for pastry. 3. When light brown, it does for pies. 4. When dark yellow, for cakes. 5. When light yellow, for puddings, biscuits, and small pastry. Cakes should be baked until they are dry in the middle, which may be ascertained by thrusting a skewer or rough piece of wood into the middle; if it comes out clean, the cake is ready. A cake is often better to remain in the oven for a short time to dry even after it is ready, if the oven be cool. BAKING POWDER. 2 oz. and 1 teaspoonful of 2 oz. of Tartaric Acid.

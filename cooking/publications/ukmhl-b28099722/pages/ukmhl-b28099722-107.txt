103 CAKES AND BAKING. 2 or 3 table-spoonfuls of milk, and mix ; use more milk if necessary, but the ingredients in the basin must be just barely wet. Have an oven-tin greased and warm, with a spoon or fork lift small portions of this mixture, about half the size of an apple, on to the tin, leaving an inch between each. Dust some sugar over, and bake quickly for about 10 minutes. TEA CAKES. 1 lb. Flour. 1 large teaspoonful Sugar. 1 small breakfast-cupful Sweet Milk. lÂ£ teaspoonfuls Baking Powder. 1 table-spoonful Butter. 2 Eggs l lb. Sultana Raisins. 1 teaspoonful Essence of Lemon. Put into a basin the flour, sugar, baking powder, and raisins well washed and dried and the sticks picked off, and mix them well. Melt the butter, and to it add the milk, which will then be as warm as new milk; beat up the eggs and add them to the milk and butter, then add the essence of lemon. Stir all this liquid among the dry contents of the basin, and with a spoon mix well. The flour should just be wet. Take up a piece, with floured hands, make it round, the size of a small saucer, and put it on a greased oven-pan; repeat till all are made up. The cakes should be set two inches apart on the pan. Take up a little beaten egg, and brush the tops over. Sprinkle some sugar over, and bake in a quick oven for about half an hour. A little of the egg in the cakes may be kept out to brush the tops over. Those cakes should be quickly made and baked to render them light, and may be brushed over with milk instead of egg.

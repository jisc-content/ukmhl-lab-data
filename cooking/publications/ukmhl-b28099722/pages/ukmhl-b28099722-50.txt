COOKERY. 46 onions halved. Allow all to stew for an hour and a half longer. Slow stewing makes the muscles of the shin to swell and become very tender; but if cooked too fast, this piece of meat is spoiled. This is a profitable as well as a very nice dish, if stewed for two and a half or three hours. Put the meat on a dish with the vegetables round, and the gravy poured over. N.B.—Care must be taken that the gravy does not dry up too much, and that the stewing is extremely slow. IRISH STEW. 1 lb. Mutton. j l£ lbs. Potatoes. 3 Onions. | Pepper and Salt. Cut up the meat in rather small pieces, and put it in a stew-pan with a cupful of water, and allow it to stew for half an hour. Pare the potatoes and slice them about half an inch thick, and put them in a basin; pour over them plenty of boiling water, and cover them up. The same may be done to the onions if a strong taste is objected to, but for this dish the onions should only be chopped and added. Drain the potatoes when the meat has stewed for a quarter of an hour, and put them in the stew-pan on the top of the meat; add the onions, pepper and salt, a cupful of more water, and stew very slowly for three-quarters of an hour. By this time the potatoes will be cooked, but not pulpy. Dish high in a plate and serve hot.

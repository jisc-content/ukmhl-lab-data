Put in a small basin a table-spoonful of Scotch oat- meal, and after wetting it with a very little cold water, pour over it a pint of boiling water or milk, stirring all the time; stir for a few minutes, then allow it to settle one minute. Pour carefully into a clean sauce-pan all the liquid, which stir over the fire till it boils. Let it boil for ten minutes, when it is ready for use.

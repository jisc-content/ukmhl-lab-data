130 WASHING AND IRONING. Fill up the boiler with cold water; put into it a quarter of an inch of soap to each gallon of water, and a dessert- spoonful of washing powder (soda is not nearly so nice, as it gives linen a greyish colour); wring the clothes roughly out of the cold water, and put them in the boiler; cover with the lid, and let them boil gently for about ten or fifteen minutes. The rinsing in cold water before they are boiled has the great advantage of removing all the dirty water from the clothes, otherwise it gets boiled into them, and injures the colour. When boiled enough, take them out of the boiler; add more water and soap, and put in the next quantity ready, always remembering the finest are done first.

The water they are first rinsed in had better be hot, as it extracts the soap much better than cold water ever will. Let them be well wrung out of the last rinsing. They must now be blued, that is, put in water tinged with blue. Put in a tub a small quantity of water, and tinge it well with blue. Dip each article in and wring it out; shake, fold, and set it aside. Never allow clothes to lie in blue water, or put more than one in at a time; but just dip once or twice, and wring out, repeating till all are finished.

The sun and air have a magical effect in whitening linen, and they impart to it a sweetness and perfume which

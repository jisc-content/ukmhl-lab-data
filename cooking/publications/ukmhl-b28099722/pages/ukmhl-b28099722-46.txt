42 COOKERY. STEAK STEWED, 1 lb. Steak. 1 Carrot. 1 small Turnip. Flour. 1 Onion. Butter. Pepper and Salt. Have the steak tender, and cut it about three-quarters of an inch thick; put into a small-sized stew-pan an ounce of butter or dripping—the butter, however, is preferable —and let it become quite hot; cut the onion in rings and fry it in the butter till it becomes very brown; also scrape and cut up the carrot and fry it as well. This trying of the vegetables brown colours the gravy nicely. When quite brown, lift the vegetables out on a plate, and put the steak in to fry on both sides; it should be fried crisp so as to shut up the pores of the meat and keep the juice in. If any butter remains in the pan it should be poured out. The vegetables are then returned to the pan, and the meat placed on the top of them; cut up the turnip in smallish pieces, and add it; a leaf of celery is a great improvement. Now put into a basin a small table-spoonful of flour with salt and pepper to taste, and rub it smooth with a little cold water; when quite smooth, add a breakfast-cupful and a half of cold water, and stir; now pour this into the stew-pan, and put it on the fire to come to boiling point; after that it must be allowed to simmer very slowly for an hour and a half. Serve the steak on a hot dish, and strain the sauce over it, as by this time all the substance has been extracted from the vegetables.

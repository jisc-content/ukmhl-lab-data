60 COOKERY. TURNIPS TO BOIL AND MASH. Peel the turnips thickly, taking off all the fibrous skin, and cut them in quarters, or. in smaller pieces. Put them in boiling water, with salt, and boil quickly about three-quarters of an hour; drain them dry and mash them well, either with a fork, or rub them through an iron sieve. Return them to a clean saucepan with half an ounce of butter, pepper and salt, and stir till hot and dry; add a little cream, and dish in a pyramid, on a plate. CAULIFLOWER TO BOIL. Wash carefully and allow the cauliflower to lie in salted water for an hour at least; then trim the leaves even with the top of the flower, removing the coarser outside leaves altogether. Put it head downwards in plenty of boiling water, salted (just enough salt to taste the water), and a small pinch of carbonate of soda, or half a teaspoonful of sugar. Let it boil rapidly for about a quarter of an hour, with the lid off the pot to allow the gas to escape from the cooking vegetable. When a fork can be put into one of the outside leaves easily, it is ready. Take it up in a cullender to drain, and send it to table with white sauce or melted butter over it.

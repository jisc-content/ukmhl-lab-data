STEWING AND ROASTING OF MEAT. 49 FOWL TRUSSED AND BOILED. Have the fowl plucked all except the head; and singe it by passing it through the flame of white paper, hut taking care not to blacken the bird by coming into contact with the paper. Wipe away all the brown particles left by the singeing; place the fowl on its breast and cut a slit along the neck; pull out the neck and cut it off as near the body as possible, then pull out the stomach and windpipe, and, with the forefinger, loosen the heart and liver. Turn the fowl on its back and make a good large cut just under the vent; at this opening empty the fowl very tidily; dip a cloth in hot water and wipe out the fowl from both ends, and then dry it well. In hot weather, if the fowl is long kept, wipe it out with soda and water, or with vinegar, and then with fresh water. To Truss it. Fold back the first point of the wings; take off the legs, and push the thigh bone well up. Take a skewer and with it catch up the end of the wing and the back joint of the leg, run it over the back and catch the other leg and wing in the same way; put a trussing- needle and a bit of string through the side bone of the fowl over the ends of the legs, and tie it firmly round the end of the back-bone. Have a pot with two quarts of water boiling, into which put the fowl with the breast down, and boil it an hour, or an hour and a half, according to age. When boiled, take it up and remove the skewer and string, and pour over it egg sauce, or any other white sauce preferable r>

WASHING AND IRONING. 134 and wring them tightly. Put in some more, and repeat till all are finished, taking care only to put three or four collars in at a time, and always stir the starch up from the bottom of the basin, as it has a tendency to sink. When all are finished, fold them, and take a few at a time, and dry rub them, which rubs out any roughness the unboiled starch leaves. Now fold, and wring very hard within the folds of a towel, or put them through a mangle or wringer. Clap them well, and put aside to iron. If to be kept any time, they must be rolled up in a damp towel; but are best ironed at once. This starch is most suitable for collars, cuffs, etc., but does very well for muslin or cotton if diluted with cold water. HOW TO IRON COLLARS AND CUFFS STARCHED WITH COLD STARCH. Have a table with a thick flannel and a clean cotton or linen cloth tightly stretched upon it, and a clean iron, not too hot. Place the collar evenly on the table, and run the iron lightly along the wrong side first; turn it, and do the same on the right side. Repeat this once or twice rather quickly until the collar begins to feel a little dry. Then press heavily and evenly on the right side, taking care to pull out button-holes, and iron them straight. A fine polish is put on the collar by using the edge of the iron, and rubbing with it from the top of the collar to the band, leaning heavily on the iron all the time. See that the band is nicely polished as well as the collar. Curl it round, and set aside to harden. Cuffs are ironed in the same way, only if they ai'e re- versible, with a band in the middle, the band is ironed thoroughly and finished first before the cuff is touched.

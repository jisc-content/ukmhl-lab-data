FISH. 31 Have a nice clean frying pan quite hot; place the herrings in it, the skin next the pan, and fry them for five minutes; then turn and fry the other side about the same time. Always fry the skin side first. Good herrings should need no dripping, as they contain sufficient oil in themselves to fry in. SALMON TO BOIL. Empty the salmon and wash it, but handle the fish as little as possible, to prevent the scales from being rubbed off. Put into a fish-kettle enough water to cover the fish, with salt in the proportion of a table-spoonful to each gallon of water. When it boils put the fish in, and let it boil for 5 minutes, then put 2 breakfast-cupfuls of cold water in to reduce the temperature, and put the kettle on a cooler part of the fire; allow it to remain thus under boiling point for the proper time, then take the fish-kettle off the fire and allow it to stand for 10 minutes before removing the salmon. This improves the flavour and makes the fish firmer. Table of Time to Boil Salmon. A slice weighing 1 lb. requires a quarter of an hour. ,, 3 lbs. „ 25 minutes. 6 lbs. from a thick fish „ 40 minutes.

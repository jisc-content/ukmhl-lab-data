COOKERY. 40 HARICOT MUTTON. 1 lb. Shoulder of Mutton. 1 Carrot. 6 small Onions. 1 larger one. 1 Bmall Turnip. Flour. Dripping. Pepper and Salt. Cut the mutton into neat pieces the thickness of chops, and about 2 inches square, as near as may be. Put into a stew-pan a table-spoonful of good dripping, and let it get quite hotâ€”which is when it begins to smoke. Slice the largest onion and fry it in the hot dripping till very brown; then lay in the mutton and fry all the pieces well, lifting them out as they are done. When all are fried, pour the dripping out of the pan, leaving the onions in the bottom. Now mix in a small basin a table-spoonful of flour, a tea- spoonful of salt, and a little pepper with 11 breakfast- cupfuls of water; stir all well and pour it into the pan, and keep stirring over the fire till it boils up. Strain it into a bowl to keep back the fried onions, and make it smooth. Return it to the pan and lay the chops into it; put on the lid and stew gently for half an hour. Peel the six small onions, and cut up the carrot and turnip into very neatly-shaped pieces, and put them in the pan; allow the whole to stew twenty minutes longer without stirring it, as the vegetables must not be broken. Dish the meat neatly with the vegetables round, and pour the sauce over all.

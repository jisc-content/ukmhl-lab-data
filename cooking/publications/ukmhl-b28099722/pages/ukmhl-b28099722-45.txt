STEWING AND ROASTING OF MEAT. 41 BOILED MEAT PUDDING, 1 lb. Lean Beef. 1 Sbeep’s Kidney. £ lb. Flour. \ teaspoonful Baking Powder. i lb. Suet. Pepper and Salt. Put the flour into a basin; add to it a pinch of salt and the baking powder; then chop the suet very finely and mix it in, rubbing it into the flour with the fingers. Add as much cold water as will wet it, and make it up into a stiff piece of paste, then flour the table and roll it out into a round piece scarcely half an inch thick. Take a pudding bowl that holds a pint, rub it inside with clean dripping, line it neatly with the paste, which then cut even round the edges. Mix together on a plate a table-spoonful of flour, a teaspoonful of salt, and half a teaspoonful of pepper for seasoning. Cut the meat in thin slices, dip them in the seasoning, and place them lightly in the basin; split the kidney, skin and cut it in thin slices; dip them also in the seasoning, and put them into the bowl, and pour in a teacupful of water for gravy. Wet the edges of the paste on the bowl; roll out the scraps that remain large enough to cover the dish; place it on, press down at the edges, and sprinkle a little flour over the top. Now dip a pudding-cloth in boiling water, tie it tightly over the top, and plunge the pudding in plenty of boiling water; then boil it for two and a half hours. Remove the cloth, and turn the pudding out on a dish. Liver and bacon mixed, or mutton, makes a good pudding of this kind.

80 COOKERY. ROLY-POLY PUDDING. 1 breakfast-cupful of Flour, f lb. of Suet finely chopped. | teaspoonful of Salt. 1 teaspoonful of Sugar. Powder, i lb. of Jam. Butter Milk or Water. £ teaspoonful Baking Put the flour into a basin along with the suet, chopped very finely, to which add the salt, sugar, and baking powder, and mix all well together. Now add as much of either butter milk or water as will make a stiff paste, gathering up all the flour in the basin. Turn it out on the board and roll it into a thin sheet. Take a bowel or plain shape (a melon shape is best) and rub it well inside with dripping. Take as much of the paste as will line the shape, and fit it nicely all round, cutting the edges even. Now put a spoonful of jam in the bottom of the shape, and cover it with a piece of the paste; repeat this operation till the dish is full, leaving a piece of paste last, which wet round the ^Jges a little to make it adhere. Cover the top with a buttered paper, and put the shape into a pot with half an inch of boiling water in it; put the lid of the pot closely on, and steam for two hours, then turn out. N.B.—The scraps of paste left after lining the shape may be rolled out again, or just put in between the layers of jam as they are. Leave a piece the size of the top till the last. Have a pudding bowl that will hold a pint and a half, and rub it inside with butter. Make the flour, suet BOILED APPLE PUDDING. lbs. of Apples.

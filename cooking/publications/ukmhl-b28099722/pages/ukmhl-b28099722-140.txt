WASHING AND IRONING. 136 TO IRON LINEN STARCHED WITH HOT STARCH. A nice hot iron is required, at the same time it must not scorch. Place the collar or cuff evenly on the table, with the wrong side up. Iron it lightly. Turn it over, and iron the other side lightly first, more heavily next, and then very heavily and smoothly. Afterwards polish in the same manner as previously directed. Curl up, and put aside to get quite firm and dry. TO IRON A SHIRT. Place the back of the sleeve smoothly on the table; iron it; turn and iron the other side smoothly. Place the wrist-band smoothly on the table; iron it wrong side first, and then finish on right side. Next comes the shoulder-strap, then the neck-band or collar. The latter must be done extremely carefully, polishing it nicely. Double the back of the shirt, and iron it on both sides. Spread the shirt out now, and iron all the front of the shirt except the breast. Place a piece of board covered with flannel under the breast, and iron it very nicely, polishing highly at the last. Hang the shirt up to dry well, then fold neatly, and put away. TO DRESS LACE (A Simpler Way). Lace is best to be starched very slightly, either with very thinly made boiled starch, or with the liquid in which a little rice has been boiled.

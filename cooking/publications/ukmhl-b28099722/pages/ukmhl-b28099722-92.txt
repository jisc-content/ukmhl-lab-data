88 COOKERY. HOMINY. 1 tea-cupful of Hominy. | 2 breakfast-cupfuls of Milk. Put a tea-cupful of hominy into a breakfast-cupful of boiling water to soak for 12 hours. Put the soaked hominy into a small basin with 2 breakfast-cupfuls of milk, and stir it through. Cover the basin with paper, and place it in a covered saucepan with a little water, and steam it for an hour. The hominy will then have absorbed all the milk, and with the addition of a table-spoonful of sugar, may be used to eat with jam or treacle. Or it may be put into a mould, and when cool will turn out a nice white shape. HOMINY PUDDING. 1 cup Hominy. 1 handful Currants. 2 Eggs. Milk. Sugar. Prepare the hominy according to the directions given in the previous recipe. That is, soak in water, add milk, and steam. Then stir in a breakfast-cupful of milk in addition, a tea-spoonful of butter, 2 table-spoonfuls of sugar, and a handful of currants, washed and dried. Beat up 2 eggs and add them. Mix the whole well, and pour it into a pudding dish to bake, either in the oven or on a toaster in front of the fire for half an hour. Slammed milk is quite good enough to use.

COOKERY. 66 half an ounce of butter and half an ounce of flour kneaded together, which season to taste, and, after allowing it to boil, pour over the leeks. They may be cut in inch lengths if preferred, and piled high on the toast. BEETROOT—TO PICKLE. 6 Beetroots. 2 pints Vinegar. £ oz. Ginger. £ oz. Peppercorns. 1 blade Mace. 1 doz. Cloves. Wash the beetroots gently, taking care not to break the fibres, as they will bleed and lose their colour. Put them into a sauce-pan, with boiling water tasted with salt, to boil for an hour and a half. Take them up, peel and cut them in slices one-eighth of an inch thick, and put them in a jar. Boil a pint of vinegar with the peppercorns, mace, cloves, ginger, and, when boiled, add to it a pint of cold vinegar. Pour the whole over the beetroots in the jar, and when quite cold cover tightly. RED CABBAGE—TO PICKLE. Take a nice firm red cabbage and wash it well, taking off the coarse outside leaves. Shred the cabbage up finely into very slender slips, and put a layer of the cabbage on a sieve or basket; sprinkle salt rather plentifully over it, and repeat till the whole is finished. Allow it to remain thus for two days, turning it over several times that it may drain, then put it into a jar. Boil a pint of vinegar, with a teaspoonful of peppercorns, a blade of mace, and 6 cloves, and pour boiling over the cabbage in the jar; add a few slices of beetroot if con- venient, which will improve the colour. Cover up tightly when cold.

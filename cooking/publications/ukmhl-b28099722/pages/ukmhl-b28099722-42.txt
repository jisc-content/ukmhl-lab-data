COOKERY. 38 MUTTON STUFFED AND ROLLED. 4 lbs. Mutton. 2 Onions. Bread-crumbs. Parsley. Herbs. Pepper and Salt. Procure a nice breast of mutton; take off the shoulder-blade; take all the bones out; cut off any superfluous edges of fat, and, with a rolling-pin, flatten the mutton by beating it welL Now take a breakfast- cupful of bread-crumbs, a table-spoonful of finely-chopped parsley, a teaspoonful of chopped herbs (thyme and mar- joram if to be had), pepper and salt enough to season the whole, and, after mixing all well, then moisten it with a little milk. Spread the mixture on the mutton, and roll it tightly up, tying it with tape in at least three places. Place it then in a dish, and put it in the oven for a quarter of an hour to draw out a good deal of the fat from it. Put two table-spoonfuls of this fat into a stew-pan and let it get hot; slice the onions and fry them till pretty brown in the fat; then add the mutton. Put into a basin a table-spoonful of flour, a little pepper and salt; rub the flour smooth with a very little water, and then add two breakfast-cupfuls of water, and mix. Now pour this thickening into the pan with the mutton, put on the lid, and let all stew very slowly for two hours. Then take up the mutton and put it on a dish, after cutting off the tape. Eemove as much fat as possible from the top of the sauce, and pour it over the mutton. See that the sauce is not too thick.

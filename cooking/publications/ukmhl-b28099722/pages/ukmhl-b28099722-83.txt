Put into a basin the corn flour, and wet it with a little cold milk, then add the sugar and essence. Put on the 2 cupfuls of milk to boil in a nice clean pan, and when it boils stir in the corn flour, and stir constantly and rapidly for 3 minutes, then wet a shape in cold water, and pour the corn flour in, and turn out when cold on a plate.

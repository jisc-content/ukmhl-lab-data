COOKERY. 72 Wet the carbonate of soda with a very little vinegar, just enough to moisten it, and stir it thoroughly through the other ingredients. Pour all into a buttered shape. Cover with a buttered paper and steam for two hours. Serve hot with sweet sauce. This pudding is good with either white or red goose- berry jam. TREACLE PUDDING. 1 breakfast-cupful of grated Bread. 1 breakfast-cupful of Flour. I lb. Currants. | lb. Suet. 1 table-spoonful Sugar. \ teaspoonful Salt. 1 teaspoonful Ground Ginger. \ teaspoonful Carbonate of Soda. | teaspoonful Cream of Tartar. 1 Egg. Water. £ lb. Treacle. Wash and dry the currants, and chop up the suet very finely. Put into a basin all the dry ingredients, the bread, flour, sugar, currants, suet, salt, ginger, carbonate of soda, and cream of tartar, and mix them well, after which add the treacle, stirring it about. Beat up the egg and mix with it a teacupful of water; pour this in and mix all well together. It should be quite moist without being at all sloppy. Put it into a shape or basin well rubbed with dripping or butter, and cover with a buttered paper. Place it in a pot in which there is half an inch of boiling water. Put the lid closely on the pot and steam for two and a half hours, then turn out and serve with sweet sauce. N.B.—If more water is required to moisten the pudding properly, it must be added, but it is best not to put more among the egg in case it should not be required.

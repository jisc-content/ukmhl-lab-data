FISH. The varieties of fish available for food in this country are numerous and excellent; those containing the least fat are the most easily digested. The flesh of fish contains fibrine, gelatine, and albumen in small pro- portions, mineral matter and water in larger. Whiting, haddock, cod, plaice, and soles are nearly equally digestible, and even suitable for the food of invalids. Salmon, mackerel, and herring are more oily, and not quite so digestible. The common herring con- tains a large amount of nourishment, and if cooked so as to get rid of some of its superabundant oil, con- tains a large amount of nourishment at a cheap rate. Lobsters and crabs are not easily digested, and to some people are injurious. They are rather coarse feeders, and this may, to some extent, account for their indiges- tibility. All fish out of season are unwholesome, and sometimes positively injurious. Buckland, who has given so much information on the nature and habits of fish, writes very emphatically against the taking and using of fish out of season. It is said that fish are fully as nutritious as animal food; and though they may not have such a satisfying effect upon the stomach, that arises from their being so easily digested. They are not only good food, but food of the best description, well able to supply the wants of the body, suitable for young and old, healthy people and invalids.

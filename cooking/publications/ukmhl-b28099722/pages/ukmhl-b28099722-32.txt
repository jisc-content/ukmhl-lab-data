OOOKERY. 28 sausage, place it in the belly of the fish, and sew it up; truss the haddock into the form of the letter S, brush the top over with a little beaten egg, sprinkle bread- crumbs over, and put it in the oven to bake for half an hour. It must be frequently basted with fresh dripping while baking. Serve with melted butter. TO STEW FISH. lbs. Fish. 1 Onion. Vinegar. Flour. 1 oz. Butter or Dripping. Pepper and Salt. Any of the coarser kinds of fish do well to stew; and the different varieties of fish stews have always been favourite dishes where fish are easily procured. Cut up the fish into pieces about 2 inches long, after being well washed and cleaned. Put the dripping or butter into a small stew-pan, and let it get quite hot; chop up the onion and fry it brown in the hot fat; sprinkle a dessert-spoonful of flour into the pan, and stir it smooth; then add a teaspoonful of vinegar, salt and pepper to taste, and a breakfast-cupful of water. Stir till it boils; then put in the pieces of fish, put on the lid, and let them simmer very gently for ten minutes. Skate (which stews very well) takes twenty minutes, or even longer; but in general, ten minutes is quite enough time. Serve with the sauce over the fish. SALT FISH, TO COOK. 1 lb. Salt Ling or Cod. 1 oz. Butter. Flour. Milk. 1 Egg. Salted fish are neither so nutritious nor so profitable1 as fresh fish; because salt extracts the juices from the fish, and greatly wastes its nourishing properties.

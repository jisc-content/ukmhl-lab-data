OUi? LUJTCHEOfJS. 14S A savoury omelette, spinach ou toast, with “ buttered- eggs,” or served with short-bread biscuits. A little plate of peas, tossed iu butter with dice of fried ham or bacon. A cheese fondue en caisse. A chicken neatly cut up (as for a curry) then dipped in bread-crumbs, fried a golden brown, and served with mac- caroni, and tomato, or good bread-sauce. The undercut of the saddle, cut out entire, grilled over a brisk fire, and sent up with a potato duchesse: or a juicy chop similarly served, with a pat of maitre d’hdtel butter melting over either of them. Braise a neck of mutton, or a breast, in gravy, with vegetables and some chopped bacon : slip a slice of bacon under the flap of either, and tie it in shape before you commence operations : when almost done, lift the little joint up, strain off the gravy, and make any nice sauce with it. Put the joint in the oven, after bread-crumbing it, to brown and finish cooking; when ready, dish it surrounded by boiled maccaroni over which the sauce should be poured at the last minute. Tomato pulp may be added to the sauce with marked effect, and some glazed turnips or carrots may garnish the dish. From these dishes the luncheon of a lady or an invalid, ought to be easily selected.

EJJZI?EES—COJ?CLUCpE@. 63 here, whose manage is worthy of her artistic skill, tells me that she has made up her mind (and rightly, say I,) never to permit her admirable mayonnaise d la Oouffe' to be handed round to her guests again. One person, she says, would take a little of the aspic, the next some of the salad, the third—engaged, perhaps, in pleasant chatter, with a pair of bright eyes full upon him—might absently secure a frag- ment of the garnish ! and so on, all in heart-rending igno- rance of the science and care bestowed upon the dish. Under any circumstances I strongly recommend that all iced entrees be helped from the side table, with a portion of the sauce upon each plate, and passed round to your guests without delay; for, however firm the mould may be when it is presented to guest number one, by the time it reaches number eight, liquidation is certain to have set in. Speedy helping at the side table will prevent this. I even go as far as to sajT that all entrees might be thus served with manifest advantage. The menu card in front of you tells you what is coming, and in this way you would be spared, at all events, the unpleasantness of having a hot silver dish with its savoury contents thrust in between you and the lady you have taken in to dinner; conversation would never be annoyingly interrupted; pretty costumes and dress coats would be less liable to be baptised with hot gravy, whilst much valuable time would be saved.

Beignets soufflds. From age, hors d’ceuvres. Dessert. 1.—Buy two partridges in addition to your customary Clear partridge soup. S0UP nleafc : Pluck the birds> d,aw and cut them up, breaking all bones of any size with a mallet. Set the soup meat for consomme as usual, and when you have obtained as strong a stock as possible therefrom, strain it, and let it get cool; remove all fat that may rise to the surface, and when quite clear, pour it into a large sauce-pan, adding all the pieces of partridge, including the livers of the birds, &c.; set this on the fire°to come slowly to the boil, skimming it very carefully ; after it has boiled, slack off the fire, and let the contents of your sauce-pan simmer slowly for an hour or more. Now strain the soup from the bones, clarify (it should be a nice, bright clear consomme remember) and give it half a glass of Madeira, a pinch of sugar, and a few drops of chilli vinegar to finish with.

164- CULIJi^Y JOttlJfGS FOI? JdJkQ^B. Sliced Bologna sausage, prawn butter, bread and butter. Kippered seer fish, sliced tongue, oat biscuit. Herring a la. sardine, potted tongue, dry biscuit. Cheese fingers, green butter, Bologna sausage. Cucumber, olives farcies, oat biscuit. Pilchards in oil, butter, pulled bread. The best cheese you can get, cut into dice, should accom- pany the above. Home-made cream cheeses are not seen as often as they ought to be, and yet a child could make one, following any domestic cookery book recipe. The garnish- ing of the compartments of the hors d’oeuvres dish should be tastefully done with knots of curled parsley, curled cress, or little bunches of fresh water-cress. Fancy butters have of late become justly popular at Madras. There are many ways of making them. The objects you must keep in view when composing a fancy butter, may be thus summed up :—a pleasant flavour, a pretty tint, and novelty. To secure the first, it is imperatively necessary that the basis upon which you work be beyond suspicion. The butter you use must be the best possible. If, therefore, you cannot make it at home, from cream you have set under your own eye, I strongly advise you to use that of a “Denmark” tin. You must wash the butter well with milk, and form it with your butter-bat, setting it in ice afterwards. The colouring is clap-trap work: you can get a nice green tint from “ spinach greening,” and a pretty orange scarlet from crab coral. Novelty rests with yourself: you can ring the changes upon pounded anchovies, sardines, herring roes, lobster, prawns, crab, and pilchards: you can use capers, parsley, garden-cress, gherkins, onions, and olives : by the judicious selection of your ingre- dients, all of which are agreeable in fancy butter, you will avoid sameness, and secure success. This is my recipe for a stock “ green-butter” :— 1.—Weigh a quarter of a pound of butter such as I have described, and ice it.

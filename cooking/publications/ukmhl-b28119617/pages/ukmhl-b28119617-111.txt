The boiling of a potato has long been considered one of the tests b}T which the merits of a cook should be decided. “Can she cook a chop, and boil a potato?” is often the modest query of pater familias in England, and in nine cases out of ten you may wager your best hat that she can do neither. Nevertheless, I have come to the conclusion that cooks are in many cases wrongfully blamed in the matter of potato cooking ; that is to say, that their failure is often attributed to the wrong cause. We all know that the potato grows capriciously according to the weather it may have enjoyed, or have suffered from. A crop will sometimes prove mealy, and light, for the table, and at other times waxy, and heavy. It is therefore obvious that we should find out the merits or demerits of the tubers we buy, before we give our orders regarding their treatment in the kitchen. We ought not to expect all potatoes to turn out equally floury as a matter of course, and blame the cook if he fail so to serve them. There are fortunately so many ways of cooking potatoes that we need never be at a loss for a recipe. If nice and mealy we can, of course, boil, or steam them,—the latter method for choice,—but if waxy, we must proceed differently. Whether boiled, or steamed, a potato ought not to be peeled ; if very old you cannot avoid removing the skin and eyes, but, in a general way, a potato is far better cooked “ in its jacket.” When done, the skin can be removed, if you wish, in the kitchen, and the dish be served plain, or in any one of the ways I shall presently speak of.

The sauce-pan should be then put on the fire, and in about

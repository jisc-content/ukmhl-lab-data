VE GEZyigLES—COJfTJfr UEQ, 105 In boiling potatoes in the ordinary method, it is a good thing to check the rate of cooking, every now and then, by adding a little cold water, and the time ought to be,—after boiling commences,—from eighteen to twenty minutes. < Peas may be boiled, cooked in the jar, or stewed; it is a sine qua non that boiled peas be young and fresh. You never get a dish of peas equal to those gathered in your own garden: those bought in the Indian market are, as a rule, tar too old, having been allowed to attain the largest size possible. I have eaten peas from my own garden at Bangaloie, and Secunderabad, as delicious as could be desired. They were small, because the pods were cut with their contents three parts developed, but for flavour and tender- ness, they could not have been better. During our winter season at Madras we can grow our own peas, and surely the trouble is slight when we consider the result. For boiled peas Put one quart of water with a tea spoonful of salt, one of sugar, and half an ounce of oreen mint on the firewhen it boils, pour in a pint measure of shelled peas; boil quickly; when done, drain, and turn them on to a frying pan with an ounce of butter, sprinkle a httle salt over them, work the pan till the butter melts, and is blended with the peas, then turn them on to a hot dish and serve. (Gouffe.) ’ Peas in the jar.”—This is to my thinking the best way of cooking peas. You get the whole flavour of them : they are rarely overdone ‘to a mash’ like boiled peas in clumsy hands often are, and even old peas become tender and eatable by such treatment. Having shelled half a pint f peas, put them into an old two-pound jam jar, with a screw , 1 a block tin can with a closely fitting top,—(the vesse must be completely closed) and put in with them a table spoonful of butter, a tea spoonful of salt a tea ^ T?der6d 8U^a d0zen ininfc leaves and a ve.y httle white pepper. Cover the vessel down tightly.

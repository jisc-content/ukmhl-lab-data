Dried sweet herbs, (thyme and marjoram) are as necessary in game soups, as is basil in turtle; and red currant jelly is indispensable. Spice is also required in judicious propor- tions. As I intend to give detailed instructions for game purees in their turn in my menus, I will not pursue the subject any further in this chapter. Neither will I discuss the treatment of tinned soups just yet, for I shall reserve that branch of Indian soup-making for consideration hereafter in a chapter devoted to “Camp cookery.” I therefore consider our debate upon the general principles of soup- making at an end, and in my next I shall introduce the subject of fish.

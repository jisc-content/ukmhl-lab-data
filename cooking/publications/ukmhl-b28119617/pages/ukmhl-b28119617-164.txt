OULIJTJII^Y JQ3<npa8 FOI? 152 If you wish to make a lcramousky of chicken, turkey or game, you should mince the meat coarsely, the pieces being cut like little dice, bind the mince with the yolks of an egg or two, and stir into it, in a sauce-pan on the fire, a little richly made veloute ; let this get quite cold, and firm, then divide it into little portions and fill your bacon slices. Miuced truffles, and mushrooms, are, of course, undeniable improvements to any salpicon. A fish lcramousky is easily accomplished : you need only mince the fish, stir into it, in a sauce-pan on the fire, a few spoonsful of well made white sauce, add a little spice, with the yolk of an egg, and set it to cool. In like manner, tinned lobster, tinned oysters, and any tinned fish, can thus be successfully treated. In using them, however, it is necessary to wash, and drain them from the liquid of the tin. The sauce should be made very carefully, so that it may freshen up the fish as much as possible. An oyster, plainly dipped in the batter I have given you, and fried secundum artem, is perhaps as dainty a morsel as can be presented to the jaded appetite of an Anglo Indian. Drain the oysters from their liquor in the tin, wipe them, and set them en marinade all the day in a soup plate, with the juice of three limes, an onion sliced, some whole peppers, and a few cloves; turn them occasionally till they are wanted. Here is a super-excellent idea of the “ G. C.’s”:—Split each oyster open, almost as wide, comparatively speaking, as you do a kidney, and insert therein a little of the follow- ing composition :—a dessert spoonful each of minced mush- room, shallot, and truffle, tossed on the fire in batter, with pepper, salt and a spoonful of rich brown sauce : thicken this with the yolks of two eggs, give it the juice of a lime, and let it get cold. After putting a small allowance of this in each oyster, shut the sides together, dip it in the batter, and fry immediately.

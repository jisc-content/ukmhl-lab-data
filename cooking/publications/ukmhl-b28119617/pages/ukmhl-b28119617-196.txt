The fair haired artiste who demonstrates bread-making at Mr. Woolfs’, makes a pound loaf with three-quarters of a tea-cupful of water: her touch is as light as a feather, and the dough is made with wonderful swiftness. I have taught my servant to use two wooden spoons to work his dough with, the result is satisfactory as. regards the lightness of the bread, and to those who dislike eating food mauled by native finders, the system is especially attractive.

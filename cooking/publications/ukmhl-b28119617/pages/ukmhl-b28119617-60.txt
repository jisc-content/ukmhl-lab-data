A# CTJLTJVJIIIY JOttlJiG-S FOR JAJlQIlfiS. The best dish of stewed fish is the matelotte which, strictly speaking, should be composed of eels, but may, I think, be equally well followed in dressing any firm fleshed fish. As I shall speak of this dish in my menus, I need only say en passant that it is rich, vinous, spicy, and consequently gene- rally appreciated by the muscular Christian. Broiling fish sounds simple, but under this head there are a few°toothsome recipes not to be despised. Let a good cut of seer be divided into nice cutlets, parboiled in the morning, and set to marinade all day in salad oil, minced shallot parsley, vinegar, a clove of garlic, a few whole pepper corns, Ind a little lime peel: take them out, wrap them in well-oiled papers, broil over a fast cleai hie, and serve with a nice sharp brown sauce like sauce Robert. Take care that the bars of your grid-iron are well oiled 01 they are apt to burn delicate morsels like fillets of fish en papillotes. Having thus sketched the various ways of preparing fish for the table, I must request my readers to note the lecipes I have given in my detailed menus, remembering that my obj”t Sns been to suggest dishes, winch m my humble nniniou will be found more pleasing than the ordinaly plainly boiled lumps of fish, which, with certain stereotype concomitants, too often greet the diner out in Madras.

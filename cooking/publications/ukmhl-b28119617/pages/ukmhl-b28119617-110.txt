9S CULIJWIIY JOttlJVGa F0% JtJLQUflB. It will be, I think, admitted nem con that we live in a climate out here especially demanding vegetable diet. With the thermometer indicating 90° or thereabouts, plain animal food is not only distasteful to many, but absolutely unwholesome. We cannot, therefore, devote too much atten- tion to the cookery of vegetables. Let us consider what we have got under three heads:— (a) —English vegetables grown in India. (b) —Country vegetables. (c) —Vegetables preserved in tins. At different periods during the year we can get in Madras:—potatoes, peas, cauliflower, cabbages, spinach, arti- chokes (Jerusalem), and globe artichokes from the Hills, French beans, carrots, turnips, knolkhol, celery, marrows, leeks, cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuces, beetroot, endive, and onions: all under head number one. Under head number two we have, brinjals, bandecai, various beans, country cucumber, and greens (which cook well as spinach), the moringa, small tomato or love apple, maize (mucka cholum) sorrel, pumpkin, yams, onions large and small, garlic, and sweet potato. For head number three, which we will take separately, we must consult the preserved provision list of any well known firm. I have omitted asparagus, seakale, parsnips, and salsify, from my list under the first head, as those excellent vegeta- bles have not yet been cultivated by the gardeners of Ban- galore or the Neilgherries in sufficient quantity to form a portion of the vegetable supply of our markets. For the benefit, however, of such enterprising amateurs as may be able to grow them privately, I will mention how each should be treated by the cook hereafter.

CHAPTER XIX. 9 * Our Vegetables. BRITICS on English cookery seem to agree in saying that, wanting as we are, as a rule, in our general knowledge of kitchen work, our ignorance of the treatment of vegetables is greater than in every other branch of the art. Until comparatively lateU, the universal method of serving vegetables at an English dinner table was with the meat alone. Dressed vegetables, or entremets de legumes, were never heard of. Of late years, however, facilities in the way of travelling abroad have been great, and by degrees the Briton has come to appreciate a dish of vegetables, specially prepared, such as he liked so much in Paris, at Monaco, or Pau ; and Martha has been “ worritted,” on the return of the family to England, to “mess about the cauli- flower with cheese,” or send up the green peas in solitary grandure. A fillip has, in this way, been given to vegetable cookery in England, and people with any claims to refined taste have at last come to perceive the absolute barbarism of heaping up two or three sorts of vegetables on the same plate with roast meat and gravy. From time immemorial tinned asparagus has occupied a prominent place in the menu of a dinner in Iudia : I have often wondered how this spark of civilization became kindled, and why the example thus given was nevermore generally followed with regard to other vegetables.

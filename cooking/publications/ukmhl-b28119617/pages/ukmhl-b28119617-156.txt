I will, however, conclude my chat about luncheon parties with a receipt for a mayonnaise, sauce which has been communicated to me by the artist W. H. H.:— Put the yolks of three large, or four ordinary Indian eggs (raw) in a flat joint dish with the juice of two limes, and beat them well: tip the dish on end at an angle ,of about 35°, by slipping a thick book under the rim at one end. Open a fresh bottle of salad oil, and get an assistant to let the oil fall, in rapidly succeeding drops, upon the centre of the dish, whilst you continue beating the egg mixture upwards to make it pass under the stream of dripping oil: half a pint of salad oil may be thus expended, and you will by that time have a sauce as thick as treacle, and of a golden yellow tint. Arrange your mayonnaise in its dish (W. H. H. recommends the juicy slices of a really well flavoured cold leg of mutton) shake a few drops of tarragon vinegar over it, with a dust of black pepper: arrange some well dried lettuce leaves, trimmed with a silver dessert knife, over the mayonnaise; garnish as you like, with broken aspic jelly, gherkins, olives, capers, &c., ice the sauce, and pour it over all. W. H. H. suggests that “grace” should follow. He is right. A few words must now be said regarding miscellaneous luncheons :—the office snack-let, the lunch in the train, or al fresco out snipe-shooting, the “ tiffin” at home, a lady’s morceau, and the mid-day meal of the convalescent. Place aux dames. This is the time when a lady may indulge in mulligatani, or her favorite curry, with its chutneys, and relishes. Indian corn, boiled, stripped with a fork from the cob, tossed in melted butter, peppered, and salted, is generally liked ; see that the cob is a young one. A nicely roasted snipe, or pigeon, with chipped potatoes. A single canape of prawn, or a little patty of puff pastry filled with any tasty mixture.

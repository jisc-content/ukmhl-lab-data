I confess that the man who, with his eyes open, wars against his chef, is generally the loser before the campaign is ended. Time in boiling meat can scarcely be fixed arbitrarily: if you follow the advice I have given, you will find fifteen to twenty minutes per pound a reliable allowance. Discre- tion and experience will enable you to decide what orders to give: large and deep joints like humps, legs of mutton and of pork, silverside of beef, and hams, will naturally require a more liberal allowance than fowds, tongues, galantines, bacon, rabbits, &c. There are few things that are boiled so important as the ham. So much depends on the cook’s knowledge of the process, that many a ham is spoiled through ignorance. I think it worth while, therefore, to give you the following rules which I hope will be found easy enough. It is of course a sine qua non that you soak the ham for twenty-four hours, changing the water at least three times (I am speaking of hams in canvas, or skin, not of those in tins) when thus well soaked, scrub the ham well, and trim it, scraping off all discolorations. Now place it in your ham- kettle, and cover it with cold water—(for a festival a bottle of Madeira should be poured in with the water)—and let it come gently to the boil removing all scum that may rise. When°quite clear, throw in three carrots, a head of celery (leaves and all) three Bombay onions, a bag containing crarlic, cloves, mace, whole peppers, and lime peel, parsley, thyme, and marjoram, boil on till the vegetables are done, and then let the kettle simmer gently for four or five hours. When done, let it remain till nearly cold, then lift the ham from the water, and detach the outer skin (it will roll off easily) and dredge some fine raspings of

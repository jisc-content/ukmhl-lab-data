CHAPTER ♦ Camp Cookery. LTHOUGH no doubt there are many of my readers who have by long experience acquired the knack of making themselves thoroughly comfortable under canvas, and who, being fond of nice food and au fait in culinary science, contiive to eat and drink in camp as luxuriously as in cantonment, there must be, I take it, a good many travellers, sportsmen, soldiers, and others whose duties demand several months of tent-life per annum, who would like to pick up a wrinkle or two in the matter of cookery under difficulties. A friend of mine, who in addition to his passionate devotion to la chasse, possessed the keenest affection for his dinner, assured me, once upon a time, that good bread was the back-bone of happiness,—gustatory happiness that is to say,—in the jungle. In cantonment even, this man despised the miserable travesty called bread furnished by the native baker,-—they say he once saw it being made, never thought of it again without a shudder, and pre- ferred a home-made roll for ever afterwards. He carried his roll with him, so to speak, into camp, and with the aid of a talented servant, was able to bake hot, clean, white bread daily at a distance of many marches from an Eng- lish dwelling place. He used Yeatman’s baking powder, imported Australian or American flour, and a little salt.

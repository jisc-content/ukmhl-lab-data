NOTE. HE menus have been revised and corrected. They are all susceptible of being doubled for larger parties than those they have been designed for. Though each menu is given in French, the English names of the dishes it contains will be found in the margin of the detail of instructions. I have not attempted to treat of sweet dishes in this work, but here and there an entremet sucre of a simple kind will be discovered amongst my recipes. For hors dâ€™ceuvres, please consult the chapter I have devoted to them. Wyvern. ~V_i

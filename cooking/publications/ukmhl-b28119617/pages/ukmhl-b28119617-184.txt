The cream should be really thick and rich, or the effect of the little entrcmet will be “ poor indeed.” This dish may be added to by first placing a layer of maccaroni in the pie-dish, the cream being poured over it, then the cheese, and so on. “ CEufs au gratin’’:—Butter the bottom of a pie-dish previously well rubbed with shallot, and line it with some maccaroni already boiled in milk, pour round it some melted butter in which you have dissolved some grated Parmesan, or other mild well rasped cheese, and upon that dispose a complete layer of hard boiled eggs, sliced.

Slices of tomato, drained of their watery juice, and with their seeds picked out, may be laid upon the egg, or thin slices of Bologna sausage; and mushrooms, or truffle trimmings, may be chopped up, and sprinkled over them: there is obviously ample scope for culinary ingenuity in the enrichment of “ceufs au gratin’’ “CEufs farcis” :—Boil six eggs for half an hour, take them out, and plunge them into cold water. When quite cold, peel off their shells, and, with a dessert knife rubbed in butter, divide each egg in half, slicing a little piece off the rounded ends to admit of each half sitting upright upon a dish: now pick out the yolks, pound them with butter in a mortar, and proceed to dress them with any tasty trifles at your command, season the composition delicately, and fill the egg cases therewith, trimming the farce neatly, with a des- sert knife dipped in melted butter, in a convex shape over each case,—for there will be more than enough mixture to merely fill each cavity. For the farce you can use finely

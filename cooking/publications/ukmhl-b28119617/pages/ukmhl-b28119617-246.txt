MEJTU *02? jS (PjOfO'Y OF SIX. £134 savoury paste of it. Prepare your aspic jelly flavoured with tarragon and pack your mould with the fillets of partridge between layers of the paste and slices of truffle. Ice this, and present it with sauce ravigotte (also iced) in a boat, and dry toast. “Aspic Jelly.” This requires attention; the common flavourless jelly, consolidated with isinglass, should be avoid- ed if possible. In order to turn out an aspic, fit to present at a dinner party, you must proceed in this way Put into a stew pan an ox-foot cut up, with a bacon bone, or a slice or two of ham or bacon, any scraps of raw meat, such as cutlet trimmings you may have, or, better far, a young fowl cut up as for fricassee, with a few mixed vegetables, &c., as for soup. Add a cup of cold water, cover th§>pan, set it on the fire, shaking it occasionally : when the pieces of meat begin to take colour, add a little more water, and in about lalf an hour, pour in enough water to cover the contents of the pan completely; put in a tea-spoonful of caramel, and then let the vessel simmer for three hours very gently, j When ready, strain the liquor off into a bowl, let it get cool, ; skim it carefully, add a table-spoonful of tarragon vinegar, clarify it, (q. v. page 27) and strain it finally through a clean cloth, producing a clear, amber-coloured liquid, which will set of its own accord without isinglass, if put in the ice box. \

stuffed plainly, or with sheeps’ kidney, as I have described CULIFJ1IIY JOZZIJTG-S FOX cold, in its raw state, and eaten as a salad, or, in the form of puree as a soup, or sauce,—“ au gratin’’ as an entremet, with maccaroni,—with fish, or with other vegetables, as a garnish,—the tomato never fails to be a welcome friend. In Italy, Spain, and Southern France, it forms a staple part of the daily food of all classes, and I believe that I am right in sayino- that it is a very wholesome vegetable in a hot climate.

CTJLIJ7JIIIY J0TTIJ7G-S FOI{ 76 saying this I speak from experience. I first read Gouffd before I had&taken to practical cooking work, and before I had actually made sauces, &c., ladle in hand, in an English kitchen. Since going through that ordeal, I have again come across the book, and I find that much that I had formerly to skip as too complicated, now seems easy enough. I propose now to place before you in the simplest way I can, Gouffe’s fundamental sauces. Those who are acquaint- ed with that author will observe that in the first place I shall reduce the recipes to a much shorter compass, and in the next, that I shall omit everything that is not down- right necessary to produce a fair result. Gouffe propounds the following sauces as the foundation of nearly all those of a high class you are likely to lequiie .— 1 ,Espagnole; 2, Veloute; 3, Allemande; 4, Bechamel; 5, Marinade; and.6, Poivrade. Of these Veloute, Allemande, and Bechamel are so closely allied, that I shall confine mysel to the last. Marinade and Poivrade I have already given. Espagnole is, of course, worthy of close attention. - y fundamental sauces will then be reduced to two. one brown, the other white, which I think will be found ample for the Indian kitchen. Veal stock plays an important part in Gouffe s recipes. Now although there can be no doubt of its value, I do not look upon veal as a sine qua non in sauce-making. A really carefully made consomme, assisted by a ham or bacon bone, and on special occasions with a fowl, will give you an excel- lent base to work upon. With regard to Espagnole sauce, (which, as many of you know, is a rich, thick broivn sauce) I would simplify Goutib s receipt as follows Get ready a couple ot sheep s trotteis chopped in pieces, with a ham or bacon bone, oi a few slices of either; any poultry bones, or cutlet trimmings you may have, and two pounds of beef gravy meat cut into squaies. Now cut up a couple of onions and throw them into a stew-

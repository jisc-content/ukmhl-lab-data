J6EJUJ FOI[ fi LIEELE HOME (DIMMER- 288 7.—Potted prawns, home-made, Madras, ought to be t, ,, , oftener seen than they are. Whether eaten with cheese, spread on toast, or at office in the form of a sandwich, this preparation is most acceptable. Select some nice sized prawns, boil them, pick out very carefully all the grit, and that black line which runs straight down the back and underneath every prawn: wash them afterwards in cold water, and pour a lot of water over them as they lie on the top of your sieve : when satis- fied that you have thoroughly cleaned them, dry them, and toss them in a littld melted butter in a frying pan until they have absorbed the butter; next pass them through the mincing machine ; pound them thoroughly in the mortar, and lastly press them through the wire sieve. Season the paste so obtained with salt, white and red pepper, a few drops of anchovy sauce, a little pounded mixed spice, and work the whole together with some nice freshly made butter till thoroughly incorporated : set it in an earthen- ware jar, and pour a spoonful of melted butter over the surface. N. B.—Here is a wrinkle worth noting:—If you want to „ . , send round at dessert a dish that is brandy.ne8 1 n c erry generally speaking popular, buy a glass jar of the best French plums, (prunes) and a bottle of good cherry brandy, take out a few plums, and pour as much cherry brandy into the jar as the plums will admit: the next day you can add more, for the plums will absorb the brand)7; and so on for a day or two. Finally cork it down for a fortnight or so, then serve at dessert. Never let the jar be empty, but refill it as the plums are eaten.

To do this, turn the contents of tin out upon a sieve, with a bowl under it to catch the liquor; when the lobster meat drips no longer, pour over it a good jugful of clean cold water turning the pieces so that they may all come under the stream. Hard boiled yolks of eggs may be passed through the sieve, and be made to form a part of any fancy butter; they tint plain butter yellow and make a tasty pat if flavoured with soft herring roes, or cod’s roes, peppered and sharpened with a few capers. Fish that is very salt must, of course, be soaked in water before it can be used : anchovies in oil do not need that treat- ment ; gorgoua anchovies, on the other hand, must be freed from brine by steeping. Home-made potted meats, if carefully made, so far surpass those you get in tins, that I can hardly understand why they are so rarely attempted. Really good butter, and a little pure gravy, attentively extracted from some fresh meat and bones, are the chief corner-stones in such compositions. Ramasamy invariably over-spices his potted meat, and the less we enquire into the class of butter he uses the better. Potted prawns should be made precisely as laid down for prawn butter, omitting the final amalgamation with butter. I will select home-made potted tongue as a trustworthy method of using up meat advantageously :— Take one pound weight of tongue, home-cured, (don’t hesitate to pay eight or ten annas for it when fresh : the sum will not ruin 3rou, and you will get your money’s worth) four ounces of “Denmark” butter, a tea-spoonful of pounded mace, a coffee cup of beef gravy, a tea-spoonful of “spiced pepper” (q. v. page 90), and work them in this manner:—cut

Apart from its being palpably inartistic, there is another reason which prompts the abolition of sending round vege- tables with entrees, and that is the time that is wasted in doing so, and the complication it adds to the service. Whilst the matter of fact objection to the practice is, that by the time they are really wanted for the joint, they are certainly mangled and cold, if not wholly expended; for few people prepare relays of potatoes, &c., to follow those sent up with their side dishes. Lastly, let me say a few words about the garnishing and helping of entrees. As a general rule, our native cooks, assisted I dare say by the butler, are much given to the ornamentation of their side dishes. Now, whilst fully prepared to pander as much as possible to the “ lust of the eye,” I warn you to be careful lest these efforts to make things look pretty be over- done. Slices of raw cucumber should be severely interdicted, for they impart an inky flavour to the entree they may be trimmed round; and funny devices cut out of vegetables, and dotted about a dish, should be forbidden, for they sug- gest to the hypercritical mind an idea that perhaps fingers have been busily employed in arranging them. Pray do not permit your cook to garnish a rissole with a raw spring onion, (the green stem stripped and curled, and the bulb thrust into the rissole). I have seen this done at Madras, and once upon a time barely escaped eating the onion, which would have been a sad catastrophe, seeing that I had a most agreeable companion by my side. Let the arrangement of your entrees err on the side of simplicity rather than otherwise. Dishes that require careful helping ought certainly never to be handed round at a dinner party. I have observed that ladies frequently refuse an entree on account of the difficulty of helping themselves. A fair patroness of mine

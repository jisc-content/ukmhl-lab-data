The meat or fish of which the dish may be composed becomes sodden, and dead, and the green accom- i paniments fall off in crispness. Besides, after the meal, a mixed majmnnaise is wasted, whereas one with which the sauce was separately served may be turned to account.

The mould can now be left in ice to consolidate thoroughly: when

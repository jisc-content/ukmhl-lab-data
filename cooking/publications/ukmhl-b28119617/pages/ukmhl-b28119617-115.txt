♦ V eg etables—continued. MERE is perhaps no nicer way of serving potatoes with chops, steaks, grilled chicken, roast pigeon, &c\, than in the form of “chips.” An invalid, as a rule,' takes to this plain method of cooking the potato, and it is a quicker way of doing it than by any of the other recipes. In the first place, after washing the potatoes well, peel them, and slice them carefully a uniform thickness—about that of a rupee say—and spread them on a clean cloth to get rid of the moisture. Wipe them thoroughly, and spread a sheet of blotting paper ready for draining the chips here- after Now dissolve a goodly allowance of beef dripping (or whatever you use for frying with) in your saute pan, or shallow sauce-pan; when quite boiling, drop in your potato slices—there should be enough fat to completely cover them—and let them, as it were, boil therein ; watch them as they are cooking narrowly, turning and moving them about continually, and as soon as they assume the golden tint you want,—a nice pale yellow mind —lift them quickly from the fat, and let them drain on the blot- ting paper for a minute or two. When quite dry, turn them into a very hot silver dish (or garnish the dish, with which tney are to go, with them) and serve.

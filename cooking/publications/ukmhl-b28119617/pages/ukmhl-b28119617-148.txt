If not hot enough, the omelette will be leathery, or you will have to mix it in the pan like “ scrambled eggs.” G. The moment the butter ceases to fizz, and assumes a brown tint, the pan is ready. 7. Instantly lift up the part of the omelette that sets at the moment of contact, and let the unformed mixture run under it; repeat this if the pan be very full, keep the left hand at work with a gentle see-saw motion to encourage rapidity in setting, give a finishing shake, and turn it into the hot dish before the whole of the mixture has quite set. S. The omelette will roll over of its own accord, if the sides of the pan be sloped as I have described, it will not require folding. 9. A minute is ample for the whole operation, if the pan be properly hot when the mixture is poured into it. 10. Have the hot dish close by the fire, so that you can turn the omelette into it instanter. A little melted butter, with some chopped parsley, may, with advantage, be put into the dish. As I said before, omelettes may be varied in many ways.

Chopped ham, chopped tongue, chopped bacon, and chopped corned beef are added to omelettes with good effect. The words “ au jambon, “an lard,” “au langue de bceuf,” &c., specify the addition. I have found it better to fry the minced ham, &c., independent)}, keeping it handy for addition to the omelette during the rolling over stage, as it goes into the dish.

IJT EHE SEO^E-I^OOM. S3 The cook should be carefully shown the use of flavouring essences, and also the manner of mixing dried herbs. He ought also to be taught never to run out of bread crumbs. Stale fine crumbs should be made every now and then, and kept corked down in bottles for use when required. The very unsightly appearance presented by fish, cutlets, etc., crumbed with fresh spongy crumbs should warn us, for stale bread is never to be had when you suddenly want it. Red currant jelly is very useful; the store-room should never be “ out” of it. I shall treat of tinned vegetables hereafter in their proper place: macedoines, petits pois, and asperges, are of course excellent, and the dried Julienne will be found admirable for soups. Preserved fish is not required at Madras, and we can get on without tinned meats, soups, and potted luxuries, for we can make better things at home. In sweet things, however, we ai’e not so independent, and jams, jellies, tart-fruits, dried and candied peel, currants, raisins, ginger, &c., &c., must all have room in the house- keepers cupboard. Of tinned butters, I shall speak in a future chapter.

Let us first consider a few ways of serving eggs:— “ CEafs sur le plat” :—this simple, yet capital method of doing eggs in a hurry, should be noted. Melt a table- spoonful of butter in an omelette pan, and slip two eggs into it, carefully avoiding breaking the yolks; let them set°'n the butter, as a poached egg sets in water; the moment they are sufficiently firm, let them slide off into the hot dish ready to receive them, pouring the butter in which they were cooked over them. Put in the eggs the moment the butter melts ; for, when first they go in, the pan should not be too hot: a drop or two of tarragon vinegar maybe shaken over the dished eggs, or a tiny bit of maitre d’hotel butter the size of a pea may be allowed to melt over each of them. If after dishing the eggs, you return the pan to the fire, and brown the butter before pouring it over them, you have “ ceufs an beurre noir.” Eggs broken gently over thin slices of cheese, (which have been placed in melted butter in an omelette pan over the fire) and allowed to set, are called “ ceufs au fromage”: they should be dusted with pepper, and salt before serving. I have frequently mentioned “ buttered-eggs”* in con- nection with fish, and vegetable cookery. By some, the dish is called “ scrambled eggs,” which is perhaps the more accu- rate title, being a translationof the French “ceufs brouilles,” the name given to it by our “ lively neighbours.” Do not forget the many ways in which you may serve this com- position, and proceed to make it thus :—Break three eggs into a bowl with a salt spoonful of salt, a table-spoonful of cream or of milk, and a dust of pepper: mix them well: * The “rumbledeggs” of Ramasamy.

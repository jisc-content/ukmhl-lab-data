CHAPTER VIII. Soup-making—concluded. 1HICK soups may be divided into two classes—the white, and the brown. The principles followed in both are very similar; the main difference, of course, consists in the sort of meat used, and the addition of brown, or white roux, as the case may be. Roux is simply melted butter, with flour added to it, according to the quantity of soup you want to thicken. The butter must be melted first, the flour being dredged in by degrees, and stirred vigorously at the bottom of the sauce-pan until thoroughly incorporated, and velvety. If required for a brown soup, you can allow the roux to colour : but if for a white, you must commence adding the soup to it as soon as the flour and butter have been suffi- ciently worked together. In making these soups the utmost care should be taken not to over-do the thickening. In the case of a white soup this error is more fatal than in a brown : you might as well offer your guest a basin of arrowroot “ conjee,” or any nice gruel, for the savoury flavour of the soup is easily over- powered. A little practice will teach a cook how much flour, or arrowroot, is necessary to obtain the desired con- sistency of a thick soup, and he should bear in mind that the full effect of the thickening does not assert itself until the soup, which has been added to it, comes to the boil. 4

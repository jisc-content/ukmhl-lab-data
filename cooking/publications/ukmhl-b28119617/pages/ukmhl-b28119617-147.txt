&HE SJ1V0UIIY QMELEWE. 135 pan>and P-a37ing it, as it were, from side to side: With one good shake, the pan (in less than a minute from the time of commencing operations) was lifted from the fire, and its contents rolled off into the hot silver dish at hand to receive it, in which a little melted butter, with some minced parsley and shallot, had been prepared. The omelette, as it rolled from the pan, caught up, and buried within it the slightly unformed juicy part of the mixture which still remained oil the surface, and, as it lay in the dish, was without any special shape, of a golden yellow colour, flecked with green, with the juicy part escaping from beneath its folds. An omelette ought never to be stiff enough to retain a rolled appearance. Being so rapidly cooked, it ought to be too light to present a fixed form, and, on reaching the hot dish, should spread itself rather, on account of its very frothiness. Books that counsel you to turn an omelette, to let it brown on one side, to let it fry for about five minutes, &e., are not to be trusted. If you follow such advice you will only produce, at best, an egg pudding. The omelette I have tried to describe is that generally known as “ aux fines heroes' : the ordinary one is simply made of eggs flavoured with salt. Though cream is an improvement, or, in its absence, a spoonful of milk, neither are essential. I confess that I like a very little minced onion in all savoury omelettes, but that is a matter of taste, and where ladies are concerned, the fragrant bulb ought perhaps to be omitted. The general rules to be observed in omelette-making, then, may be thus summed up: 1. Use a proper utensil, with narrow, well sloping sides. iw "^° no^ ovei’d° the amount of butter, or salad oil, that you use for the frying. • n°t heat the eggs, and never use more than six (as in the Pennaconda Omelette). It is better to make two of six, than one of twelve ewes. OO Three eggs, mixed whole, make a nice sized omelette.

85 %OJS<T SOILED. The French place their small joints in marinade, a custom I strongly advocate for the poor meat of this country, when you intend to roast or grill it. Here is the Gallic method of cooking a loin of mutton en yapillote :â€”Trim the loin nicely, and let it lie from morning till roasting time en marinade, composed of a breakfast cupful of salad oil, two onions, and a carrot, sliced fine as for Julienne, with some whole peppers, cloves, salt, chopped parsley, and a tea spoonful of powdered dried sweet herbs. Let the joint be turned several times during the day, and baste it often. When to be dressed, pack it with its vegetables and all in a well oiled paper, aud roast it carefully, basting it with the oil that composed the marinade: when nearly done, remove the paper, brush off the vegetables, baste with melted butter, and serve, when nicely browned, with other vegetables, independently cooked in gravy. Though the inexperienced reader will hardly believe me, I can assure him that when finally set before him, he will fail to trace the pre- sence of oil (the bSte noir of Englishmen) whilst he will be surprised at the juiciness, and good flavour of the meat. In roasting poultry, invariably lard the breast with fat bacon, or tie a flap of bacon over it. Birds cannot be kept too moist when roasting. A Bellary onion, and a lump of preserved butter should be put inside the carcass of a fowl, and the basting should be carefully attended to. The slower the roasting the better. I have often found that a fowl baked in a slow oven till about three parts done, and then finished in front of the fire, was excellent. It should be occasionally basted with melted butter whilst in the oven. The bacon tied over the breast should be removed durino1 the last five minutes of the cooking, when the bird should be lightly dredged over with flour, and liberally basted with melted butter to produce the brown, crisp, blisters, which always make a fowl look inviting. 8

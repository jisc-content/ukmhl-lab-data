CHAPTER IPC. Regarding our Fish. a ISH, under skilful hands, offers,” says Brillat Savarin, “ inexhaustible resources of gustatory enjoyment; whether served up entire, in pieces, ; done in water, in oil, or in wine ; hot or cold ; in it receives a hearty welcome.” We who live at or sliced all cases Madras, on a coast which yields a perennial supply of good fish (to borrow a well known figure of speech) should surely lay these words to heart. With a market as fairly well supplied as ours, we ought never to be at a loss for variety, or for scope to exercise our cooks ingenuhy. The fair hostess should always be able to soothe herself with the reflection that with the fish, at all events, her guests will be well satisfied. Now, do we avail ourselves, as we ought to do, of the many opportunities we undoubtedly possess of turning Madras fish to a good i account ? I certainly think not: indeed I fear that only a ew of us appreciate the true value of this most valuable 1 article of our daily food. At the ordinary Madras dinner party, you may relv almost for certain on having boiled seer fish, with a sauce and a few slices of cucumber and beetroot on the side of your plate. Or the fish may be pomfret, similarly served.

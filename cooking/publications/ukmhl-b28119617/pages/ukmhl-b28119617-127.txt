The combination being a puree of plain boiled artichoke, bountifully diluted with cream, slightly seasoned with pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg; this, turned into a well buttered pie-dish, its surface dusted over with finely grated mild cheese, and the whole baked until the top takes colour. Good milk may take the place of cream, ora sauce blanche, but if perfection be desired, pray use cream. Another artistic method of doing this vegetable is this:— Cut up half a dozen large ones, after they have been three parts boiled, into long strips about a quarter of an inch thick, dip them in the batter I describe elsewhere, and try them a golden tint: these fritters are excellent; you can order them alone as an entremet, or pile them in a pyramid as the central garnish of an entree. Jerusalem artichokes can be served in a mould, iced with a mayonnaise sauce, or hot with a Parmesan, or nice white sauce. For the mould follow this recipe:—21bs. of the artichokes boiled in milk: £ pint of cream: four eggs: pepper and salt. Mash the artichokes, and pass them thlough the hair sieve, add the cream, the eggs well beaten up whites and all, and season with pepper and salt. Put the mixture into a well buttered mould, and steam it for one ! hour. Turn it out, and garnish it with tomato puree, Paimesan sauce, or a rich veloute. Or:—ice the mould, and turn it out with a cold mayonnaise sauce in a boat. The name of this excellent entremet here is “ Topinambouvs d la Chetput.”

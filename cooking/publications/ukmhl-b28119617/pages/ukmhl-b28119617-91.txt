Take a sauce-pan, and melt a quarter of a pound of “ Cow-brand,” or any good preserved butter in it; fry gently in that for ten minutes a sliced carrot and a sliced onion ; before thev take colour, add two ounces of flour, stir for five minutes, and add by degrees your clear stock, half a pint of cream, a small tin-ful of mush- rooms chopped, salt, and pepper; stir over the fire till boiling, and then permit the sauce to simmer slowly for an hour, taking off all fat that may rise. At the end of the hour you can strain the Bechamel into a sauce-pan, and place it in the bain-marie.

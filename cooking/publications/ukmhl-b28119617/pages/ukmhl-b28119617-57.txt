I^ECrftltGpiJVG- OUIt FISH. A5 iced, and with sauce ravigotte or tartare. But if you give a clear consomme delicately flavoured, and order an iced entree to succeed the fish, you can indulge in a “ matelotte aux champignonsor seer “ d la creme de cu- vettes’’ A thick soup, fish with lobster sauce, followed by an entree with cream in its composition, would form, for instance, a combination of good things obviously inartistic in design, and one which few could enjoy with impunity. As I observed in an early chapter of my “jottings,” the charm of a dinner according to the new regime consists in the harmony of its lights and shadows. Fish, we all know, I hope, may be boiled, fried, baked, stewed or grilled ; and by every method can tasty dishes be prepared. I will begin with the principles to be observed in boiling fish, and take the other styles of cookery in the order I have named. After having thoroughly cleansed, and wiped the fish, rub it over with a little vinegar, and place it on the strainer of the fish-kettle, so that when done it may be lifted out without risk of breaking up. Put plenty of salt, and a dessert spoonful of vinegar, into the water in which the fish is to be boiled. Let the water be cold, and in sufficient quantity to cover the fish. Place the kettle on a brisk fire, and boil the fish as fast as pos- sible. Skim off all scum that rises, and take care to i suspend operations, the moment the fish is done. Over- boiled fish is nasty to eat, and ugly to look upon : under- done fish is unfit for human food. The cookeiy books allow ten minutes per pound as a fair average of the time required for this operation; but so much depends upon the thickness of the fish to be boiled, that the cook should test it now and then with the point of a skewer, and as soon as the flesh parts easily from the bone, let him decide that it is ready. Never let your fish, after it is done, remain soaking in the water in which it has been cooked; drain it at once, or

14.9 shallow vessel, for the operation. The ordinary frying-pan sold at hard-ware shops is of no use whatever for this branch of the cook’s work. The pan you want should look like a stew-pan with its sides cut down half-way; its diameter need not exceed eight or nine inches. It may be as heavy as you like, for it must, of necessity, be kept stead}’ over the fire when in use; and a handle like that of an omelette-pan is unnecessary, for you never require to shake a saute-pan. Besides your pan, for delicate fritter work, there is nothing more useful than the wire frying-basket,—a cheap thing enough, and not hard to make. Provided with this utensil, which may be described as an open-work, draining-pan, the whole process of working may be thus described:— 1. —Make your batter, to begin with, according to one of the receipts hereafter given, and place it in its bowl on one side, covered up from flies, dust, &c. 2. —Prepare your fish, meat, vegetable, fruit, or whatever you are going to cook, and arrange the pieces on a flat dish, on a table handy, with the bowl of batter next to it. 3-—Take your saute-pan, see that it is thoroughly clean and dry. 4. —Set it on the griddle rest, over a good bright fire, and empty the fat, or whatever you use as a frying medium, into it. 5. —When melted, the fat ought to be quite two inches deep. 6- Determine if the fat be hot enough by throwing a sippet of bread into it: if it turn a yellow-brown the fritter bath is ready. 7. —Now dip your morsel-to-be-fried into the batter, which should be of sufficient consistency to coat it nicely ; and put it into the frying basket, after you have plunged that vessel into the hot fat. & 8. —The fritter must be covered by the fat, not partly in and partly out of it.

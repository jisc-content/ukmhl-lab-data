ifE CHjL TJFFE 8. 125 for delicate flavouring. If \tou do this, your hashes will cease to be slices of meat, cooked up iu hot-water and Worcester sauce, thickened with flour; neither will your mince, croquettes, rissoles, &c., be presented with a sauce similarly composed. There are certain hard and fast laws to be observed gene- rally with regard to the treatment of cold meat, etc., which ought never to be forgotten. Let me enumerate them :— 1. Always cut off carefully all parts that have been browned in the previous cooking, such as skin, &c. 2. Use the trimmings, and all bones, assisted by any- thing you may have to spare, to make the strongest broth you can for your rechauffe. 3. Be generous in jmur allowance of butter and eggs and, if recommended in the recipe you are following, do not refuse a small modicum of cream. 4. Never be without red-currant jelly, olives, anchovies, pated cheese, grated bread-crumbs (bottled), mushroom ketchup, good vinegar, bottled garden herbs, and a mild sauce like Harvey. •5. Try to maintain a little kitchen garden, in large pots, or boxes, containing English curled parsley, marjoram thyme garden-cress, and celery. The last need not be planted for its root’s sake, the leaves and stalks provide the cook with his flavouring agent. 6. Teach your cook that meat that has been once cooked does not require to be boiled or stewed de novo. Describe a hash or a mince to him as meat gently warmed up in gravy or sauce separately made to receive it. You must now turn back to Chapter XIII in which I tried to explain the fundamental principles of sauce making.

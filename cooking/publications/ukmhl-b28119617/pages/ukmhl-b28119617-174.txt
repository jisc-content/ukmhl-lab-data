CHAPTER XXVHI. Hors d'oeuvres. BE must now consider those attractive accessories of an artistic dinner, luncheon, or breakfast party, which, under the title of hors d’ceuvres, are gradually becoming popular amongst English people, whose minds have expanded under the beneficial influence of travel in foreign countries. Hors d’ceuvres, as you all doubtless know, are little dainties, or kickshaws, carefully prepared, and tastefully served, which, on the continent, are offered to the diner to whet his appetite prior to the more important discussion of the banquet itself. In Italy the service of these trifles under the title of “antipasto,” precedes every meal as a standard custom. We have not yet acquired this agree- able fashion, notwithstanding that the sending round of three or four oysters to each guest, with a slice of brown bread and butter’, &c., has for a long time, been no novelty either in England, or even in Madras. Our custom, at present, is to reserve the hors d’ceuvres to accompany the cheese at a dinner party, and to advocate a change would, I fear, be lost labour on the part of the author of these jottings. As far as luncheon, and breakfast parties are concerned, however, surely we might adopt the Italian custom as a novelty, and watch its effect upon our friends, before passing an opinion upon the suitability of the introduction.

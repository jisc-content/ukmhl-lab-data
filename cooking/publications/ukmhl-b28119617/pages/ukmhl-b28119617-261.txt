Dessert, cafe noir. 1.—Skin, clean, and thoroughly wash the hare, saving all the blood you can in a cup : cut it up into small pieces, and put them into a stew-pan with half pound of butter, a sliced onion, a muslin bag full of herbs, season with pepper and salt, and fry the meat over a brisk fire for five minutes. Make a roux (brown thickening) in another stew-pan, with a pat of butter, and a table-spoonful of flour: moisten this with a quart and a half of beef gravy, made as usual from the shin, and add four glasses of portwine, or claret. When well incorporated, pour this into the pan containing the pieces of hare, and let them stew in it very slowly till thoroughly done. Now drain ’off the liquor from the bones, &c., put the neatest pieces of the hare on one side for eventual serving

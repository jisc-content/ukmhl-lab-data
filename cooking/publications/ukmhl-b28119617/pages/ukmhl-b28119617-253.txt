To make the foundation of your work as level as possible, you should trim nearly all the meat of the carcass of the fowl, with a very sharp knife, almost to the skin; the meat that is thus detached should be kept with that of the wings and legs. Lastly, mince together the liver, gizzard and heart, and “ spice-pepper” the mince well. First, spread a layer of the stuffing a quarter of an inch thick evenly over the.fowl, upon that a layer of your slices of tongue (spice pepper freely) upon that a layer of the meat you cut from the fowl (dust of salt) over that a second spread of forcemeat, then your minced liver, &c., and lastly, the block of tongue: fold over this the flattened carcass, disturbing the layers as little as possible, and sew the galantine up securely with fine twine. Envelop this in a clean cloth, and tie it up carefully with cross strings to preserve the oval shape of the galantine. Set this in a deep stew-pan, cover it well with weak stock in which a glass of Madeira, has been introduced, and simmer gently for three or four hours. When done, lift it out, drain it, take off the cloth, wrap it in a fresh dry one, and place it on a dish with a heavy weight above it: when quite cold, take out your galantine, scrape off any fat that may be attached to the skin, glaze it, and set it in the ice box, finally serving garnished with broken lumps of aspic jelly. A galantine to be correct should, of course, contain a goodly allowance of truffles : these should be introduced during the packing of the carcass, according to the artistic skill of the chef, in fairly large pieces; truffle trimmings should be minced fine and added to the forcemeat. 21

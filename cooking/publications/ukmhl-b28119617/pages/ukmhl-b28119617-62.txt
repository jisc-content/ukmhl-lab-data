Then the task of order- ing dishes from works composed for people with English cooks kitchen ranges, and the best market in the world at their ’ disposal, is far from easy.

But if you will patiently follow me, not rushing to the conclusion that I only write for the benefit of a few enthusiasts like myself, 1 firmly believe that I shall be able to smooth down much that armears rugged: and help you towards the selection and accomplishment of many tasty dishes, which if neither elaborate, nor very scientific, will still be found certainly practicable, and generally worthy of a second trial. First, let' us divide entries into three distinct classes the plain, the half-rich, and the fanciful. In the first class 1 would place such dishes as the mutton cutlet (neck chop) grilled or stewed; the epigramme; fillets of meat, turkey, fnwl rabbit or pigeon ; grenadins ; and all entrees of meat Tooked* accompanied by carefully devised sauces, or really good parks of vegetable.

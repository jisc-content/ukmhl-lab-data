I have seen people quite deceived with a soup made with dried peas and coloured with “spinach greening” in imitation of puree cle pois verts. The enterprising cultivators of asparagus at Madras ought now and then to indulge their guests with that excellent soup "puree d’cisperges,” which, I take it, ranks next how- ever to the still more artistic ‘‘consomme aux points d’asperges.” You can make a capital green puree any day at Madras with French beans, and with one tin of petits pois (thought- fully assisted with spinach greening if the peas have lost colour) you can produce a very perfect puree of green peas tor about eight people. A very inviting-looking soup of bright colour can be made from tomatoes, following exactly the receipt for “ Crecy” and substituting tomatoes for carrots. Brown purees are, of course, those made of game such as hares, partridges, snipe, wild duck, teal, etc. In this way you can always advantageously dispose of tough old birds. A good puree de gibier, of hare, or of any game bird, is, without doubt, soup which is with justice widely popular. It is essentially the soup of the hungry man. A basin of it, to use a homely phrase, “ goes a long way.” It carries your thoughts back to winter fires, to old fashioned, yet generous fare, and to the glorious appetite with which you spread your napkin before you after a day with the hounds, a trudge after wild partridges, or a long drive through the keen frosty air of some by-gone Christmastide ! These soups are what housekeepers call “rich,” for in their composition you must employ port, or madeira, red currant jelly, cream, yolks of eggs, &c. One of the greatest cooks of the age propounds half a bottle of old port for his hare soup ! and all game soups take a goodly share of wine.

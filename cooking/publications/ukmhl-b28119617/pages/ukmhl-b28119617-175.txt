HO^S Q:CEUVI?ES. 168 Unlike the greater part of our culinary labours, this little item of our menu need cost us but little trouble. We can obtain many excellent things wherewith to captivate the appetite, and' we can make others which in their way are generally successful. Olives farcies, olives plain, anchovies in oil, sardines, sliced Bologna sausage, preserved tunny, lobster, cod’s roes, reindeer’s tongues, ox tongue, devilled ham, potted meats, fancy butters, herrings a la sardine, pilchards in oil, caviare, oysters, pickles, cucumber, radishes, thin bread and butter, wafer biscuits, oaten biscuits, and last but not least “Bombay ducks,” provide us with a goodly list from which to choose our three tasty morsels. Hors d’ceuvres should be served in a dish made with compartments. Tongue, sausages, and ham should be most delicately sliced: preserved fish should be very carefully wiped free from all tin-oil, and re-dressed with the finest salad oil; if of a large kind, small portions should be cut to suit the dish: potted meats should be fresh, home-made, and prettily shaped in a cone, caviare should be turned out of the tin, and garnished with quarters of lime. Fancy butters must.be iced, and served separately. Oysters are rarely sent round with the cheese: when they appear before dinner, send them up in their shells, and be quick with their accompaniments: you sometimes see a hungry man polish off his bivalves before the lime, pepper, and bread and butter, have reached him: combat this contingency by breaking up the dishes containing these adjuncts into detachments, and serving them in two or three directions at once. In selecting your hors d’oeuvres try to avoid giving two fishy things on the same dish, thus :—do not give anchovies, and prawn butter together, or olives farcies and caviare, but take, let us say, anchovy butter, devilled ham, and oat biscuit, or cream cheese, olives farcies, and wafers. Here are a few combinations :—

123 VEGE<?JtgLE8—C0jr.CLUQEQ>. A vegetablecanbegotcalled (locally) “mollay” thebranches or stalks of which are edible, ("mollay Jceeray”)—treated as laid down for asparagus, you will find this worth trying: serve it with a nice sharp sauce in a boat. Young pumpkins, “ dil-pussund,” or marrows, gathered prematurely (when the size of a duck’s egg) boiled, and served as described for artichoke bottoms, are exceedingly nice. In short, if we look about us, and try our best to make the most of the vegetables of the country, by careful cookery of the reformed school, we need never be without a pleasant dish to relieve the ding dong monotony of our market supplies. The more you hunt about amongst the produce ol the native gardens, the more surprised you will be at the opportunities afforded you of practising your culinary ingenuity. For over a century we have been contented to see a few country vegetables sent up in curries, and iu curries only, never attempting to develope their latent good qualities by artistic treatment. There are times when the supply of vegetables grown from English seed may fail us, or when we cannot expect to pro- cure them ; when on the line of march, for instance, out in the jungles, or when quartered at some little place far from the busy haunts of our fellow white men; the amateur who has studied native vegetables will then discover that his time has not been thrown away. N-R All vegetables, when served plainly dressed, derive the utmost improvement if a pat of mabtre d’hStel butter be laid upon them when they are dished. The butter, of course, melts of its own accord as the dish is being sent up.

I have tasted recently in Madras some kippered seer-fish, made at a private house, which, with Madras fish-roe (well soaked) ought to make a capital omelette of this kind. The seer-fish was split, washed, and dried with a cloth; salt, sugar, and lime juice were well rubbed in immediately, the next day the rubbing was repeated, and the fish artificially smoked by being hung over a fire constantly replenished with damp straw, &c.; after this, it was hung in the cook- room over the fire, and was ready for the table the third evening. Omelettes may be cooked auxfines herbes, served in a bed of tomato puree, and dusted over with grated cheese. They may also repose on a puree of green peas, or of spinach. They may be improved with minced game, and be associated effectively with mince of any kind. Chopped mushrooms or truffles (previously cooked, minced, and tossed in butter) are, of course, very delicious additions to them; and oysters may be introduced in the same way. Savoury omelettes are sent up with rich Espagnole, Perigueux, and Bechamel sauces, and may contain some finely minced kidney fried in champagne. Almost all fish, prawns, lobster, &c., go well with them, and whether simple or elaborate, plain or rich, an omelette rarely fails,—if properly made,—to win apprecia- tion, and be thankfully accounted for.

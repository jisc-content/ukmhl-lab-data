15.4 CULIJTJlIiY JOYYIJTaS FOR JAfiQIifiB. The brandy or liqueur you use for the marinade should be mixed in the batter. I cannot do better than wind up this chapter with a recipe for beignets souffles:— “ Put about a pint of water in a sauce-pan with a pinch of salt, a piece of butter the size of an egg, a table-spoonful of sugar, and the rasped peel of three lemons—when the whole boils, throw in gradually sufficient flour to form a thick paste, then let it remain ten minutes, and work into it, off the fire, two eggs complete, and the yolks of two more, the whites of which you reserve for whisking to a froth: add the froth, let it rest awhile, and then proceed to fry by dropping pieces of it the size of a walnut into boiling fat. The paste will swell in the process of frying, and hollow balls of a fine golden colour will be produced, if the lard is sufficiently heated. Serve them piled upon a dish, with a plentiful coating of powdered white sugar.” (G. C.) In this country it will be better to use a few drops of lemon essence than the rasped peel of a lime; and any essence, such as vanilla, ratafia, almond, &c., may be used as a change. If you omit the lemon and the sugar, and stir in with the flour a good allowance of finely grated Parmesan, you will achieve a “ beignet souffle au Parmesan,” a truly toothsome savoury entremet.

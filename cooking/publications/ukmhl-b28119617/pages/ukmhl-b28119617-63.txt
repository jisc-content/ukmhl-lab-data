51 HIJtfES MOU<Z EJTXIIEES. Having thus arranged the various dishes which come under the head of entrees in a systematic form, the task of selection therefrom must be governed by the sort of dinner you intend to give, the different items that compose your menu, and the capabilities of your cook. As a rule, jmu should generally, for the sake of contrast, select one dish from class one, and the other from either class two, or three; or an iced entree followed by one from either of the two richer classes. Never attempt to give more than two entrees, be your dinner a banquet for forty covers, or a party of eight friends. The menu of the best mess dinner I ever attended in India (given to a late Governor of Madras whose taste in culinaiâ€™y matters was proverbial) contained but one iced, and one elaborate entree. These were of course served separately, and to provide against delay, there were (for forty guests) four dishes formed of each composition. In ordering your entrees you should carefully consider the amount of work your cook will have upon his hands at the critical time of serving them, and bear in mind that the more he has to do then, the more likely will he be to make mistakes. How can it be expected that a cook can serve equally well two hot entries demanding attentive manipulation up to the last moment ?

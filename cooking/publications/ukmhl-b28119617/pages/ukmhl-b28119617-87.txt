CHIAPTEB ESLAP. ♦ Sauces—concluded. PASS to-day to the consideration of a few standard high class sauces, which, with a little care and atten- tion, will be found practicable in every well-con- ducted Madras kitchen. To aid you in this branch of the cook’s art, you cannot possess a better guide than Jules Gouffe, whose admirably systematic method of discussing sauces has never been approached by any authority on culinary mysteries. Unfortunately, however for the inex- perienced reader, Gouffe’s work is rather the treatise of a Professor addressed to students who have already matricu- lated, than a vade mecum for beginners. So unless you are fairly au fait in practical kitchen work, you will hardly derive much easy aid from the Royal Cookery Book. You must have some knowledge of the ingredients which may possibly be spared, and of those which must on no account be omitted, for even in Gouffe’s recipes there are sometimes things named which are not absolutely essential. You ought to know something of stock-making, and understand the value of game bones, poultry bones, fragments of ham, &c., and the sort of flavour these things produce, helped by certain vegetables. If, by experience, you have picked up a knowledge of equivalents so much the better. I can, in short, readily believe that those who have never bothered their heads about cookery, would find it almost impossible to direct a native cook from the pages of the great chef. In

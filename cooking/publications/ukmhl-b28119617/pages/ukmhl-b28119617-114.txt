Potatoes sautdes, (not to be confounded please with potato chips) should be treated in this manner :—Boil your pota- toes then slice them moderately thickly, aud toss them in butter in your frying pan till they brown nicely, pour the brown butter over them, and give them a dust of salt. For Maitre d’hotel proceed as above, adding a few drops of lime juice, and a heaped up table spoonful of chopped curled parsley. Potatoes d la Lyonnaise are achieved by first frying a Bombay onion (sliced fine in butter till it begins to brown) then adding your pieces of potato, tossing them till browned and finally giving them a dust of pepper. Potatoes d VAmericaine:—Cut up your boiled potatoes into thick slices : flavour a little milk with onion, spice, pepper, and salt; strain aud thicken it, as laid down for melted butter, with butter and flour, till you have a nice sauce blanche; place your slices of potato in this, and heat them up to boiling point: take the sauce-pan off the fire, stir in the yolk of an egg, add a large spoonful of chopped parsley, with a pat of butter the size of a rupee, and serve. Waxy potatoes, pressed through the sieve, and served like vermicelli,—a favorite dish of Kamasdmy’s,—ought never to be encouraged.

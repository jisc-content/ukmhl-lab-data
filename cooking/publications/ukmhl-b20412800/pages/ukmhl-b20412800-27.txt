ST ronan's culinary club. 23 A sensible, discreet person, your hostess, though a little gruff at the first brush. Sir, all good cooks are so. They know their own value: they are a privileged class: they toil in a fiery element: they lie under a heavy responsibility. But, perhaps, after all, you travel with your own cook? many gentlemen who have travelled do." " No such thing,'' returned Touchwood, lightly; " never less alone than when alone in affairs of the stomach. I may have written out a few items for my old dame here, and for the first three months taken a peep occasionally into the kitchen and larder; but now matters go on as smoothly as well-oiled butter." "Sir, you write receipts, then!" cried the Doctor, looking on his hospitable entertainer with augmented respect,— " perhaps for this very soup;—and perhaps—but that would be too great a ,kindness to request on such short acquaintance —though hare-soup, sir^ I will candidly own it, is only understood in Scotland. Sir, I am above national preju- dices ; and, I must say, I yield the Scots the superiority in all soups—save turtle, ox-tail, and mullagatawny. An anti- quarian friend of mine attributes this to their early and long connexion with the French,—a nation pre-eminent in soups." " No doubt of it. Doctor," replied the Nabob; " but you shall have this receipt, ay and twenty more receipts. To this ancient hostel now—you will scarcely believe it—have been confined scores of admirable receipts in cookery, ever since the jolly friars flourished down in the Monastery yonder: * The monks of Melrose made fat kail On Fridays when they fasted.' You remember the old stave. Doctor?" The Doctor remembered no such thing. His attention was given to more substantial doctrine. " Sir," said he, " I should not be surprised if they possessed the original receipt —a local one, too, I am told—for dressing the red trout, in this hereditary house of entertainment."

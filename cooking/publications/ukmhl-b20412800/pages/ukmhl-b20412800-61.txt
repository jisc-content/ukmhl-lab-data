DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING. 57 in the Frencli style, have peculiar beauty and fitness. And even at small quiet dinners, brain-cakes, forcemeat balls, small fried fish, or oysters fried, sippets, small sausages, pastry-borders, and those of potato or rice, are always appropriate when served with the respective dishes to which the best usages of cookery have attached them ; while the fried parsley, the spinage, sorrel, turnip, or other purees^ on which fricandeau^ tongue, or boiled mutton, etc., may be served, is a positive improvement, at almost no additional expense. But as it must ever be more convenient, it is also more agreeable, to see such things as sliced orange or lemon, beet, pickles, scraped horseradish, etc., placed on a small dish near the carver, than tossed awry, soused in the gravy, or sloping the edges of the dishes. Curled parsley always looks refreshing^ and is generally appropriate ; and still more so fresh water-cresses. There is one cheap and comfortable mode of imparting a look of fulness, finish, and neatness, in serving an otherwise insignificant dressed dish, when destined to occupy a principal place, which merits more general adoption,—namely, serving the dish on a larger one, within which a damask napkin is neatly puffed, or the fancy napkins which ladies now knit for such purposes; thus showing an agreeable framework or border, of which a light paste border round the dish with the viands, may form, as it were, the inner circle. But Careme's ornamented silver vases and skewers are the greatest modern discovery in mere garnishing. They are indeed superb. Protest.—"We hope to see the day when all large, troublesome dishes will be taken to the side-table, after being presented, and carved by the Maitre d 'Hotel, the butler, or whoever waits on the company, as is now the general practice of France, Germany, and Eussia, and the best houses in England.

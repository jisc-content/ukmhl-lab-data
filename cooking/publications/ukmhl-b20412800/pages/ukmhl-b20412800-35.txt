" Keep yourself easy, Mistress Margaret/' said Touch- wood ; " the Doctor is, I dare say, a true son of the Church of England, but he admires your practice too much to seek to shake your faith." "Na ; wha made me a judge and a divine?^' replied Meg, greatly mollified with the act of delivering her testimony; I'm no dooting but the Doctor has the root o' the matter in him, Maister Cargill." " Ay, that he has,'' cried Touchwood; " truffles and morels, onions and carrots, I'll answer for him.'* That's enough," said Meg. Go, woman, scour your saucepans. Send for Stechy; have the kitchen like a Dutch paradise to-morrow morning; —for then we take the field !" By the time that Touchwood returned triumphantly from his negotiation in the kitchen, the good wine had done its good ofiice in the parlour. Not that there were any symp- toms of inebriation, either actual or remote; but the prevailing mood was free, joyous, in short, highly convivial. The Doctor told prosy college stories of college feasts, and gave Latin toasts; Winterblossom related anecdotes of the bon vivans of another generation, and hummed catches most vilely; and the young man smoked his cigar and the whole party at once. In this happy hour, on which favouring stars shed pros- perous influences, was the Cleikum or St Ronan's Club instituted. To conclude the entertainment, the Nabob pro- duced a single bottle of choice Burjundy, Mont Ratchet; and a special bumper was dedicated to the new comer. Coffee, four years kept, but only one hour roasted, was prepared by the Nabob's own hi^nds—coffee which he had himself brought from Mocha, and now with a supqon of chicory, made in a coffeepot of Parisian invention patronized by Napoleon.

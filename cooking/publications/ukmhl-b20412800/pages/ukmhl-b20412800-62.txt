Tables should be like pictures to the sight, Some dishes cast in shade, some spread in light; Some should be moved when broken, others last Through the whole treat, incentive to the taste. King's Cookery. Bills of Fare may be varied in endless ways,â€”nor can any specific rules be given for selecting dishes for the table, which must depend wholly on fortune, fashion, the season of the year, local situation, and a variety of circumstances.

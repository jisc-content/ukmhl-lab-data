CHAP. VII. FISH. 194 169. To Butter Lobsters, Shrimps, etc. "Warm the meat cut into nice bits, in a little good brown gravy. Season with mace, nutmeg, and salt; and thicken with butter kneaded in brown flour; or dress them white in clear gravy and a little cream, seasoning with white pepper and salt. Pi^awns and shrimps may be buttered in the same way, either in white or brown sauce, and served on toasted sippets. See No. 186. 170.

A half- glass of vinegar beat up with a little made-mustard may be added, and a small quantity of salad-oil substituted for the butter.—Brown the meat when laid in the shell with a sala- mander. This is the preparation which Walker the Original thinks so charming an interlude in a social dinner, when handed round with the fish.—To dress Crabs cold. Pick out all the meat, and mixing it well with a teaspoonful of salad-oil, with cayenne, white pepper, and salt to taste, serve it in the shell.—Obs, For variety the meat may be cut in

Some fine liqueurs require to be distilled; but as this is a troublesome process, they or imitations are generally made in small families, by infusion, which succeeds very well. The syrup employed must he clarified as for preserves. Sometimes capillaire-syrup is used; but this, in most cases, is an unnecessary expense.

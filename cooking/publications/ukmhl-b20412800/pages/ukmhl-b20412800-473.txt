INDIAN-MEAL FRITTERS, DUMPLINGS, ETC. 467 ten spoonfuls of Indian-meal or three of Oswego Starch, Work the mixture till it is a smooth batter, when drop a ladleful at a time into half a pound of boiling lard. Lift out the fritters, when done, one by one, with a perforated skim- mer, and drain and serve hot and hot. More lard may be required, and the fritters must be carefully kept separate while frying. The 'above batter will make pancakes of Indian-meal. Serve with butter, sugar, and nutmeg, and a little white wine. A smaller kind are called Corn Oysters. Indian Flappers are pancakes, with fewer eggs, and baked on the girdle. Slap-Jacks are nearly the same; but the batter is prepared several hours beforehand, a little soda is mixed with warm water, and the batter touched with this before being fried for breakfast. Indian-meal suet-dumplings are made like flour-dumplings, but the suet must be well dredged with flour to prevent it from getting into lumps when boiled. Mix the floured suet with the Indian-meal. Add a little salt, and milk enough to make the mass a stiff dough. Knead this, divide it into dumplings the size of an orange. Flatten these with a rolling-pin, and beat them to make them light. Tie up in separate cloths, leaving room to swell, and boil as usual. They are eaten with boiled meat, fresh or salted, or with sugar or treacle. Boiled and baked Indian-puddings are made of the above fritter-batter, adding picked currants, and raisins stoned and cut. They are cooked like plum-pudding, and eaten with pudding- sauce. Polenta—When mush^ of Indian-meal, is nearly cooked, turn it into a buttered shallow baking-dish, and, for every half-pound, stir in two ounces of grated cheese. Stir it well, and bake for from twelve to fifteen minutes.—Nos. 229, 230.

They may also be laid together, and gently pressed down, to make the juice flow; or have a little plain or Mattre Hotel butter laid between them if deficient in juice. Next separate the gristles of the breast from the ribs, in the direction e f; carve them in the direction of g A, and the ribs in the direction of i j. The choice is—" Ribs, gristles, or shoulder?"

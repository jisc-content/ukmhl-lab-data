CURING MEAT, ETC. 573 CHAPTER III. OP SALTINa MEAT, TONGUES, HAMS, MAKING CHEESE, PATTEmG POULTEY, PEESEEVING BUTTEE, EGGS, ETC. Meat should either be salted before the animal heat has left it, or be allowed to hang for a few days in cool weather, to become tender. It should be wiped free of moisture, blood, etc., and have the kernels and pipes taken out; wash if necessary. As a general rule, which is too little attended to, meat should first be rubbed with about the half, or less, of the salt ordered; and, after lying a day or two, to dis- gorge, have the remaining half rubbed in. This twice salting^ from getting rid of blood and slime, and the effectual rub- bing and mixing it causes, will be found an excellent method, and is good not only for meat, but for butter and fish. Bay- salt is imagined to give meat a better flavour than any other salt. It is thought sweeter than manufactured salt, from being dried by the gradual action of the sun. There are various modes of purifying salt for preserving meat, butter, and fish, but they are too complicated and troublesome for domestic use. The Dutch, the first discoverers of preserving fish by salting, and who are celebrated for the mild, mellow flavour of their butter and fish, often refine the salt by boiling it up with whey; and this method is quite practicable in any dairy. Heating and pounding the salt facilitates the salting of meat. Sugar is an admirable ingredient in curing meat and fish. Without making them too salt, it preserves and keeps them mellow. Some recommend that the meat should be first rubbed with sugar for some days, and then salted. Molasses is also used. Saltpetre dries up meat so much, that it is daily less and less employed. Much less of it will colour meat, or sausage-meat, than is imagined: or sanders- wood boiled in the pickle, will give the red colour. Crude sal ammoniac is an article of which a little goes far in pre- serving meat, without making it too salt. AH troughs and

Freyich Mode.—In modern Frencli cookery, tripe, after being boiled and whitened with lemon-juice, is cut in strips and stewed in white sauce, or strong white broth, for four hours. It is then served either in a sauce d la Poulette or in sauce Italienne blanche. In good, old French cookery, tlie tripe, Avhen boiled and cut in bits, was stewed in cullis, with all sorts of herbs, onions, and chives, a glass of wine, and a little tarragon. When the sauce was thickened, a little rnade-mustard was added, and the whole strained, heated, and poured over the tripe. Cow-heels are generally cleaned before they are bought. They require from five to six hours' boiling. If to be dressed, cut them into neat bits, eg,2; and crumb these, brown them, and serve round slices of Portugal onion fried, and laid in the middle of the dish. Sauce.,—melted butter, a teaspoonful of made-mustard, and a very little vinegar, or parsley and butter.—See Potted Heels., Fried and Fricasseed Tripe., etc.: also French Cookery., National Dishes^ and Kelly's Sauce. The fat skimmings of Cow-heels and Cow-head are the best adapted, for frying or basting, of all boiled fats. They, indeed, afford a very rich oil, which is sometimes even burned; and the perfumers draw largely upon them for commodities of high name. Calves' feet jelly, so named, is often made from both Cow-heels and Tripe; indeed the former affords a much stronger jelly than the article whose name it usurps. A good glaze is made of Cow-heels, which also afford a good cheap soup, if properly seasoned. CHAPTER III. EOASTIl^G.

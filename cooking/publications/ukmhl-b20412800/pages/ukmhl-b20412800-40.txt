36 INSTITUTION OF THE ST RONAN^S CULINARY CLUB. Jekyl was to the full as flighty and speculative as the Doctor was dogmatic. The young man had French theory,—the heau ideal of gastrology floating in his brains,—he could talk of Ude and Careme. • His experience in the most fashion- able clubs, and taverns, and bachelor-establishments about the metropolis, had indeed been great; but it was fortu- nately modified by a course of Peninsular practice, under Wellington; and, upon the whole, he was found a most efficient member of the Club in all that regarded modern improvements, though rather intolerant of Scottish national dishes. The culinary lectures of Touchwood, whose eloquence for six long wrecks fulmined over the Cleikum kitchen, extended to such unreasonable compass, that a brief syllabus of the course is all we can at present give, without unduly swelling this Manual, and losing sight of the purpose for which it was intended ; namely, a Practical System of Rational Modern Cookery and Domestic Economy.

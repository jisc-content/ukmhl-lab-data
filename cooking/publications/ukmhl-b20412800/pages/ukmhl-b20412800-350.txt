344 CHAP. I.—MADE-DISHES Scoop out the crumb; fry these crusts or cases in butter or top-fat; drain, dry, and line them with gratin (No. 693), and fill with any fresh or re-dressed ragout. They are made small also. Moulds of this kind are made in Scotland of mashed potatoes (waxy ones are best, or a little flour may be added to them). These small potato-crusts may be made as Westphalia loaves, No. 225, and filled with any mince, and piled up in the dish pyramidically. What in cookery we call rolls and loaves are much the same as croustades.— See also Nos. 81, 86, and 262. 580. Fairy Butter.—To six hard-boiled yolks add a half- pound of fresh butter, and the same weight of sifted sugar. Pound this with a spoonful or two of orange-flower water to keep it from oiling, and squirt it, or rub it through a tightened cheese-cloth, or sieve. It may also be forced through the cloth in delicate coral-like wavy threads, by tying the cloth over the butter, twisting a stick made fast to a hook or door-lock in the cloth, and wringing out the butter on the dish it is to garnish. It is served over ham and bread for breakfast, and for garnishing; or by itself, as a little dish, garnished with savoury jelly.— See Nos. 601, 1201. *** "We must at the close, as at the beginning of this Chapter, again state, that if it be impossible to teach the simplest processes of plain cookery, by written directions, to the uninitiated or imperfectly instructed, it is not less so to teach the business of the Pastry-cook. Vols-au-vent^ for example, of whatever size, timbales, or casseroles of rice, and a long list of such showy and tasteful articles, must be seen done to be properly understood; and also require both aptitude to learn, and the frequent practice which alone can give the requisite manual dexterity.

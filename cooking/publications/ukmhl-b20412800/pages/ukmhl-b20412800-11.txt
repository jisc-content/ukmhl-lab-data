ADVEKTISEMENT TO THE TENTH EDITION. In again making our respectful acknowledgments to the public, and presenting a New Edition of the Cook and Housewife's Manual, professing to be thoroughly revised, and considerably enlarged, with the view of increasing its every-day, practical utility, we take leave to state briefly in what departments improvement has been attempted:— Extending more or less through every section treating of Modern English, or more correctly of Anglo-French Cookery — that reformed and enlarged system of culinary science first promulgated in our pages—the improvements, which are apparent in all departments, are chiefly conspicuous, not in simple elementary processes,—those of Britain being in general unexceptionable,—but in those dishes entitled to be called dressed or made; the entrees and entremets of the French kitchen. In this department many new receipts have been added. But in the soups and fashionable iced puddings of Careme, or the Salades and Salmis of his contemporaries.

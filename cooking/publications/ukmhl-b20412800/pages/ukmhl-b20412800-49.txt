45 DIEEOTIONS FOR OAEVING. Carving has ever been esteemed one of the minor arts of polite life,â€”a test at first sight of the breeding of men, as its dexterous and graceful performance is presumed to mark a person trained in good fashion. In the times of chivalry, carving was the duty of the younger squire attendant on the knight. " To dance in hall and carve at board'' are classed together in the list of a young gentleman's accomplishments ; and Chesterfield, the great modern teacher of polished life, has made this qualification an object of his pupil's peculiar study.

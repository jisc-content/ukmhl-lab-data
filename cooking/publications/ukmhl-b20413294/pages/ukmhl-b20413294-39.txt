33 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. enough smaller to allow a space of about three inches between the. two around the four sides and also at the bottom. This space should be filled closely with sawdust or with fine charcoal. Let the cover be attached to the smaller box by straps or hinges and the cover to the larger box be placed in position. Line the inside of the inner box with zinc, and through the bottom bore a hole that will admit a half-inch lead pipe. A hole should also be bored in the bottom of the larger box right under that in the smaller one, and the lead pipe must be long- enough to go through both holes and carry off the water that will come from the ice. The latter may lie upon the bottom of the box without support of any kind. The pipe may be soldered to the inside to prevent the water from percolating through. This box will be found a good preserver of ice, and it should not exceed $1 in cost. If shelves are desired, strips of tin can be hung over the edge of the inner box, with cleats attached on which the shelves may rest. RANGES AND UTENSILS. The Quartermaster's Department is charged with the duty of providing the kitchens, the ranges, and the usual fixtures that accompany them. Utensils needed for the preparation of food, that are not fur- nished by that Department, can be provided by pur- chases made from the company or mess fund. The Subsistence Department will purchase and send to posts articles needed for preparation of food if they are estimated for, to be paid for upon arrival at the post. 9281 ;

MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 265 STEW, WITH CANNED MEATS. Meat. Onions. Salt. Potatoes. Pepper. Water. Peel and slice the potatoes and onions; put them in the camp kettle, season with pepper and salt, pour in sufficient water to cover them, and stew gently, keeping the lid of the kettle closely shut until the potatoes are nearly cooked; then open the tins of meat and cut up the contents and put them in the kettle with the potatoes; let the whole sim- mer for ten minutes, then serve.

If your roast is thick or tough, parboil in camp ket- tle from thirty minutes to an hour before placing in the oven; then roast to a nice brown. BROILING STEAKS OR CHOPS.

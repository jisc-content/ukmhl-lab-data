97 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. BOILED SALT BEEF. The meat should be placed in a pot of cold water and made to boil quickly. As soon as the water boils the meat must be taken out and the water replaced with fresh cold water; boil it according to quality and size of pieces until thoroughly cooked. BAKED SALT BEEF. Prepare the meat as above, make a paste of flour and water, cover the meat with it, and bake in a slow oven twenty minutes for every pound of meat. STEWED SALT BEEF. Prepare the meat as above, and cut into slices; have some chopped greens or soaked desiccated mixed vegetables, and put them with the meat and a little water in a stew pan; season, and stew gently for two hours. BOILED CORNED BEEF. The time required for cooking corned beef depends upon the quality of the meat and the size of the piece. It is done when the bones become loose in the meat. Wash the meat thoroughly in cold water, chang- ing the water two or three times. Put it into a pot of cold water, enough to cover it. Cover; boil steadily and gently until tender; remove the scum as it rises. While boiling turn the beef several times. If the meat is to be served hot drain it, but if it is to be served cold, let it cool in the liquor in which it was boiled; keep the pot covered. When cold take the meat out and place it between two dishes, with a heavy weight on the upper dish; leave it for one hour or until the liquor is pressed out of the meat. Empty the liquor as it escapes. Many vegetables, such as cabbage, carrots, tur- nips, and potatoes are improved in flavor if boiled 9281 7

253 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. everything used at breakfast cleaned up and in readiness to be loaded into the wagon. If breakfast is delayed, pans and kettles can be thrown into the wagon dirty, and warm water will be readily avail- able at the next camp to clean them. A few close-fitting covers for the camp kettles will prove invaluable, as by their use many articles of food, such as soup stock, etc., may be carried from one camp to another, which would otherwise be thrown away. Beans in soak previous to baking may also be carried in this manner. If possible, all the dry sticks of wood should be placed on the wagon; a fire can then be started immediately upon arrival* in camp, without waiting for the arrival of the camp supplies. In like manner, especially in traveling through a poorly-watered country, the water kegs should be filled before leaving camp. Water kegs should always be filled before leaving camp, even if it is expected to find better water dur- ing the march; because, if obliged to camp before reaching water, there will be no lack of that neces- sary article. Upon reaching the watering place, the kegs can always be emptied and refilled. TEMPORARY CAMPS. The internal economy of the company kitchen in temporary camp differs but little from that which obtains on the march, except in the following: A brush wind-break six or eight feet high should be erected on the windward side of the fire. This prevents in a great measure sand and dirt from being blown into the food, and the inclosure forms a capital kitchen. Rations should be taken from the wagons, if to be in camp for two days or more, and thoroughly overhauled, piled up neatly and covered with a paulin or wagon sheet; everything being disposed of, however, in such a way that the wagons may be packed on short notice if the command is unex- pectedly ordered to march.

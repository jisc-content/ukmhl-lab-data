132 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. Stir frequently to keep it from burning. When cooked season with pepper. Stock or the liquor from boiled fresh beef may be substituted for milk. BOILED BEETS. Time, from one to three hours. Winter beets should be soaked over night in cold water. Wash the beets; do not scrape or cut them. If a knife enters them before they are boiled they will lose much of their color and quality. Put them into a pot and cover plentifully with boiling water. Cover and boil steadily until tender. When cooked, put them into cold water and rub off the skins. This should be done quickly. If large, slice them; if young, split them lengthwise. Put them into a hot dish and season with pepper, salt, and butter. Or, after they are sliced, mix one large spoonful of melted dripping or butter with four or five of vinegar and a seasoning of pepper and salt; let it boil up once and pour it over the beets. Beets may may be sliced and served with vinegar. Beets may be baked, turning them three or four times. Time for baking, four to six hours. BOILED STRING BEANS. Time, about thirty minutes. String the beans carefully and cut each pod cross- wise in two or three pieces; wash and soak them in cold water for fifteen or twenty minutes; drain and put them into a pot of boiling salt waterâ€”enough to cover them; cover, and boil until tender. When cooked, drain and season with butter, pepper, and salt. String beans may be boiled with bacon; in this case the butter and salt may be omitted.

MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 73 kinds of fish, thick or thin. Care rrmst be taken that the fish is not underdone, but if boiled too much or allowed to remain too long in the water it will be insipid. The fish is done when the meat sepa- rates easily from the backbone. Test with a fork. TO PREPARE PISH. Scrape off the scales, remove the entrails, etc., thoroughly wash the fish inside and out in cold water, and wipe it dry immediately with a cloth, inside and out. If the pot is small for the fish, skewer the tail into the mouth, then tie or pin the fish up in a clean towel or cloth and it is ready for boiling. BOILED FISH. Put the fish into enough boiling water to cover it about an inch, with two tablespoonfuls of salt and four tablespoonfuls of vinegar to a piece of fish of about five pounds weight. Simmer steadily until done. When cooked take up the fish, remove the cloth carefully, put the fish into a hot dish, pour a hot fish sauce over it (see Sauces for Boiled Fish), and serve, or send the sauce to table in a separate dish. To boil the roes, wash and wipe with a soft cloth. Put them inside the fish, tied with a thread or light twine, and boil as above; or they may be boiled separately wrapped in a cloth. FRIED FISH. Small fish should be fried whole. Large fish should be cut up. Clean and wipe the fish dry, rub it over with dry sifted flour, or better, dip it into well-beaten egg: and then into bread crumbs or rolled cracker. Put into a frying pan enough dripping to well cover the fish. * When this is hot put in the fish

193 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. When Ihe coffee has been roasted, turn it on a clean cloth; cover with a cloth and let it cool; when cold pick out the burned grains. Then put the coffee into a vessel with a close- fitting top. Only sufficient to last four or five days should be roasted at a time. Coffee should not be ground until it is wanted for use. It is better to roast it daily. TO PREPARE COFFEE, No. 1. Coffee is best when made from the freshly roasted berry. To one pound of coffee, roasted and ground, add ten quarts of boiling water in some convenient vessel, cover the vessel closely to prevent escape of aroma, and place it in a vessel of boiling water, being careful not to let it rest on the bottom of the outer vessel. Boil fifteen minutes. The water in which the coffee is mixed does not boil but remains at a temperature a few degrees below the boiling point. It can be cleared by pour- ing it through a piece of flannel or a hair sieve. This will make a strong infusion. TO PREPARE COFFEE, No. 2. The vessel should be clean and the water fresh and clear. Fill the vessel with the necessary quan- tity of water and put it over a brisk fire. When it comes to a boil stir in the coffee, previously moist- ened with warm (not hot) water. Cover closely; let it boil up for two minutes, stirring from the sides and top as it boils up. Exercise great care that the coffee does not boil over. To clear it remove it from the fire and dash over the surface a cup of cold fresh water; cover closely and set it on the back of the stove to keep warm but not to boil. 9281 13

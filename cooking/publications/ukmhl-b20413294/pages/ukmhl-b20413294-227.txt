MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 221 Adjust the "extension stand" always to leeward (from the wind), so as to catch or absorb the spare and draft heat, flame, etc.; use the "oven" on this stand, and shift the stand as circumstances require for your convenience. When roasting or baking is desired in connection with boiling or frying, place the oven on the stand crosswise, as that allows room for the other uten- sils at the same time; or if preferable, place it on a bed of coals near the fire on the ground, or on a level fire. Near the center of the inside of the oven place evenly apart the two large pan spiders (rests). These support the baking and roasting pans and contents and prevent an uneven circulation. Place these firmly and easily, and your foods will roast and bake splendidly. Prepare the roast, bread, pudding, or whatever you wish in the pan, place it on the rests inside of the oven and cover with the upper part of the oven; heap some fresh burning coals on top and the roast- ing or baking commences instantly. In using the oven keep a clean fire, free from sand and dirt. On top of oven build a little fire, if neces- sary, from chips, etc.; regulate your heat by the amount of fireâ€”add to or remove when necessary. Always build a fire or use live coals on top of the oven when either roasting or baking. The two smaller pan spiders (rests) are intended to be used on top of the oven, over the fire that is built on top. On this do your boiling, stewing, broil- ing, and frying with the utensils (provided with the outfit) for the purpose. Keep the oven covered as much as possible. Basting is never required; to regulate the heat simply shift the fire, add to or remove as necessary; judge cooking by time and strength of fire; add water to the roasts for gravy, etc., and to assist its self-basting qualities. When roasting or baking is completed, take off the oven, remove the cover and dump the ashes;

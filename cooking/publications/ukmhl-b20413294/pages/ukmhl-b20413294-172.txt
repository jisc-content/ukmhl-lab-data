166 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS BUCKWHEAT CAKES. For all raised cakes a well-glazed earthen crock or stone jar sliould be used for the batter, and the general rules for the treatment of batter followed. Batter must be made the night previous. One quart buckwheat flour (sifted); one-half pint India n meal; four tablespoonf uls of yeast; one tea- spoonful salt; two tablespoonf uls molasses (not sirup), or in lieu thereof one and a half tablespoon- fuls brown sugar. Warm water (mixed milk and warm water is preferable) enough to make a moder- ately thick batter. Mix the meal into the buckwheat flour; stir in gradually enough of the warm water, or milk and water, to make a moderately thick batter. Then stir in the yeast. Set to rise over night. In the morning add the salt, and lastly the molasses or brown sugar. Beat the mixture thoroughly; add milk and water if too thick, or buckwheat flour if too thin, before adding the salt and molasses, or brown sugar, and cook on a hot griddle. During the winter batter may be made each night, for a period of a week or ten days, without additional yeast, by allowing a portion of the batter (say one or two teacupfuls) to remain in the jar, and adding thereto the ingredients. Should the batter be the least sour in the morn- ing, stir in a very small quantity of soda, dissolved in hot water, to correct acidity. BICE CAKES. One quart of sifted flour; two cups of cold boiled rice; two teaspoonfuls salt; four eggs, beaten light; milk enough stirred into the flour to make a toler- ably thick batter; then add the rice, salt, and last the eggs; beat thoroughly and cook at once.

MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 247 SECURING AND TRANSPORTING RATIONS. For use in garrison, as well as in the field, each company should be provided with facilities for car- rying the ration. It will be found convenient to have a ration box of outside dimensions which will just admit of its being placed in the rear end of an army wagon, which is about 40 inches wide. The follow- ing is a description of a ration box which has been found by actual service to answer all requirements (see plate 18): Its outside dimensions over aU are 38-J- by 38^- by 30 inches deep. It is made of white pine 1 inch thick and doubled or re-enforced for 3 inches at top and bottom; the edges should be dovetailed, the corners strengthened with angle iron and braces, and the sides provided with suitable handles. The interior, as shown in plan, is divided by vertical par- titions, which extend to within 8 inches of the top. Exactly flush with the tops of these partitions, and extending around the interior of the larger com- partment, are strips a, &, c, which support a square false lid of good 1-inch hard wood a little smaller than the inside dimensions of the box, and in the edges of which hand-holes are cut as shown in plan. This false lid may be used as a bread board, a chop- ping board, and for a variety of other purposes. The real top or lid is secured by three strong hinges, and provided with suitable lock and key. The space between the real and false lids is used for carrying fresh bread for the first camp, and smaller utensils, dishcloths, etc. Such a box will weigh about 180 pounds, and will hold, in ration sacks to be described later, 1,000 rations each of sugar, coffee, salt, soap, and pepper; 200 rations of beans, a 10-pound can of lard, and 25 pounds of flourâ€”the latter to be used in making gravies. For field use, ration sacks of strong drilling or ticking with permanent ties, should also be provided.

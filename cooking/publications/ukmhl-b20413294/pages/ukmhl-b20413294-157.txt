Serve it in a warmed, covered dish. The water should be fresh and clear, not taken from the water back or from the teakettle, where the life has been boiled out of it. The stirring should cease after it has been placed at the back of the range; too much stirring spoils the porridge, making it pasty, unsightly, and un- palatable. The utensil in which the porridge is made should be scrupulously clean, and free from odor. Any odor in the utensil or in the water will impair the clean flavor that good porridge should have.

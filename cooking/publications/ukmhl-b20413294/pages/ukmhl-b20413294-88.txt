The basting should be repeated often during the baking; when nearly done sprinkle it with pepper and salt, and baste. The meat should be served on a warm platter. (See Gravy for Baked Meats.) If the beef is not sufficiently fat and juicy to fur- nish material for basting, a tablespoonful or more of stock, gravy, or beef dripping should be put into the pan; putting water into the pan to baste with is improper, as water can not be raised to as high a temperature as fat and does not, therefore, serve as well; besides this, when water is used, the beef is, to a certain extent, stewed and not baked, and its flavor is injured. One or more onions sliced and placed on the beef may be cooked with it. Mutton, veal, and fresh pork may be prepared and baked as above. They must be well done to be palatable. Before putting pork into the oven, score the skin into small squares. As ordinarily cooked by the soldier, baked meats are generally overdone and dry. It has been sug- gested that just before the beef is done it be covered with a large pan to confine the juices which would otherwise evaporate. When cutting meats to cook, cut across grain of muscle. Never wash fresh meat before roasting; scrape it if necessary to clean it. If wet or moist, dry thoroughly before cooking. Do not place meat on ice but in a vessel on ice. Do not use salt when basting, but salt the meat when done. POT ROAST. Trim off the rough parts of a nice brisket of beef, and place in a kettle over a good fire.

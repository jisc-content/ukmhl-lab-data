198 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. Plum-pudding cans should be immersed in boiling water for from one-half to one hour, according to size; then open in the same manner as canned meat. Soups. There are many grades of canned soups on the market. Buy only the best, which are skillfully and scientifically made. To serve, they simply need raising to the boiling point. Be careful not to scorch them. Use a double boiler, if possible, or immerse the cans in boiling water for half an hour to thoroughly heat the contents, and then serve. Salmon. The finest Columbia River salmon steaks are deli- cacies in cans. They are of a handsome high-pink color, flaky in texture, rich in oil, and the flesh is solid. A delicious salad can be made with salmon, lettuce, and mayonnaise dressing. If salmon is left over at meals pour oil or melted butter over it to exclude the air, and put in a cool place; when ready to serve, the oil or butter can readily be removed by skimming, or the butter, by heating and skimming. Lobsters and Shrimps. Owing to the large quantity of sulphur in these crustaceans there is a great tendency to their turn- ing black if their meat comes in contact with the tin when they are packed dry. To overcome this trouble they are generally packed in parchment or linen bags, or in wood-lined cans. A new process lias just been discovered that overcomes all this trouble, i. e., the packing in gelatin, which com- pletely envelopes the meat and prevents contact with the tin, and insures fine quality.

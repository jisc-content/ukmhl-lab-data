MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 136 stirring frequently. When cooked, drain. To two quarts of succotash add about one-half pint of milk, then stir in a piece of butter or dripping about the size of an egg, and one or more tablespoonfuls of blended flour. Stir it constantly until it boils up once. Season with pepper, and also salt, if neces- sary. Succotash may be made of dried beans and dried corn. They must be soaked over night in hot water. SAUERKRAUT. The cabbage must be firm. Trim, pick over, wash, and shred it fine with a very sharp knife. The stalk should not be used. Line the bottom and sides of a barrel, keg, or crock with cabbage leaves, and put into it a layer of the cabbage three or four inches deep; pound this down well with a wooden pounder, then sprinkle over it a small handful of salt, preferably table salt, then cabbage, then pound, then salt, and so on, until four layers are put in. Cover the cabbage with a board cut to fit loosely on the inside of the barrel. Pound hard on the board until the cabbage is a compact mass. Take off the board and repeat the process until the barrel is full. Cover it with cabbage leaves, the leaves with a piece of clean cloth, on the cloth lay the board, and on this put a heavy weight to keep down the mass. Set it away in a cool, dry place to ferment. As soon as the sauerkraut commences to effervesce, the covering of leaves should be thrown away, the scum removed, the kraut re-covered with a clean cloth, the board and weight thoroughly washed and replaced; and, as perfect cleanliness is necessary for its preservation, this process should be frequently repeated during the winter. It is ready for use in twenty or twenty-five days. It may be eaten raw, or boiled with or without pork or bacon.

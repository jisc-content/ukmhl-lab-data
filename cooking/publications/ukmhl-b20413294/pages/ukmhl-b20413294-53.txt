MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 47 BILLS OF FARE. What to provide for meals is sometimes a per- plexing question, and the following tables are given as suggestions only. The number of dishes can be readily increased or diminished according to the locality and state of the funds of the company or mess. A variety in even the same kinds of food can be obtained by consulting the recipes in the Manual. It should be remembered that no good results can be assured unless the company commander makes it his personal duty to supervise the table manage- ment of his company and indicate the bills of fare at least weekly. When unable to personally attend he should direct some other commissioned officer to visit the kitchen and mess hall, and these visits should be made irregularly at all meals and not solely at dinner time. He should know what his resources are and so use them that the best results may be obtained.

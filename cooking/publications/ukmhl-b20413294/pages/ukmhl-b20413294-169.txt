If the pan or griddle has been unused for some time cleanse thoroughly with soap and hot water, then wipe dry with a towel, and, lastly, rub thoroughly with dry salt to remove all moisture. If the griddle is clean and smooth, only occasional greasing will be required; the best way is with a clean rag containing butter. The griddle must either be scraped or greased after each cake is cooked. Pancakes should be fried in a small pan. When the cake is cooked on one side, turn, and cook it on the other.

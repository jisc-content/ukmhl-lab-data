231 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. raised. This is the mold on which the oven is to be formed. Sand is more suitable for the mold than earth, it being more readily removed. "Willow twigs bent over and closely wattled together, or a flour barrel laid flat and covered completely with earth, will likewise suffice to give form to the mold. Mix a stiff mud or mortar, and plaster the mold over 5 or 6 inches thick, commencing at the base. Allow one or two days for it to dry and harden, plastering up all cracks which may appear. When nearly dry, cut out the door at one end and the flue at the top of the other end. A small mud chimney raised over the flue will greatly improve the draft. Carefully withdraw the loose earth or sand, from the interior. If a barrel has been used for the mold it may be burned out without dam- aging the oven. Keep a small fire in the oven for at least half a day before attempting to bake. Dig a pit in front of the oven for the convenience of the baker. T wo men can build this oven in three hours, but it will generally not be fit for use for two days. It will last several w^eeks, and prove very satisfactory. This oven may also be built dome-shaped, like the household ovens used by the Mexicans. This kind of an arch would be stronger than the semicylin- drical form, but with the same quantity of material used would not have as great a baking capacity. The clay oven is peculiarly adapted for use when camping on swampy ground. Under such circum- stances it may be constructed upon a platform of stones or logs covered with clay. DUTCH OVENS. Considerable fuel is consumed in baking in Dutch ovens where a company is to be suppliedâ€”the capacity of each oven being small and several fires being usually required. Fuel may be economized, however, by building the fire in a trench of sufficient length to receive all the ovens.

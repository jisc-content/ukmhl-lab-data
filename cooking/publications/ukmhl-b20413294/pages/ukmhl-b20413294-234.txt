MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 228 AN OVEN ON LEVEL GROUND (PLATE 11). To build such an oven dig a hole about 4 feet long, 1 foot 6 inches deep, and 1 foot 6 inches wide. Without enlarging the top, hollow out the sides, from above downward, until the floor is about 2 feet 6 inches wide. The sides will thus form some- thing of an arch, and be much better than vertical sides. At about one foot from the end dig a trench of convenient dimensions for one man to stand in, to attend to the oven. A suitable size would be 2 feet 6 inches in depth, 4 feet in length, and 2 feet 6 inches in width. Dig down the partition between the oven and the trench for the door. At the back end of the oven dig a small hole, slanting down- ward, for the flue. Lay green poles close together across the oven, and stop up the interstices with grass or weeds; then plaster over the covering with a thick layer of stiff mud, after which place more poles across and cover with another layer of mud. If pressed for time this last mud may be omitted, and grain sacks or brush may be spread over the second layer of poles and dry earth shoveled on. Dig a ditch around the oven and trench to keep out water in rainy weather. Such an oven may be built by two men in one hour and a half. It is not durable, as the roof must soon burn out, but it has the advantage of being easily constructed and available for immediate use. Although much inferior to the clay or bank oven, it might sometimes be serviceable to troops on the march. When there is no bank near, and it is expected to occupy camp for several days, the best plan, per- haps, is to make an artificial bank by digging a pit about 4 feet long, 3 feet wide, and 5 feet deep, and then to build a bank oven. The pit should be pro- tected from rain. Another method for level ground is to build, over a mound raised for the purpose, a semicylindrical- shaped oven of clay or earth. Any soil suitable for

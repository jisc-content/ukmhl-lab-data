MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 24 N. B.—In washing any greasy utensil, it is best, if possible, to use the hand instead of flannel or • rags, as they retain the grease, and so keep putting- it on again, instead of scrubbing it off. All utensils after being used should be at once filled with hot water and set oyer the fire to scald thoroughly, and before being set away should be cleaned and dried. Grease remaining in a vessel will make it rancid, and moisture will rust it. Before being used for cooking purposes, all uten- sils should be thoroughly clean. All utensils should, if possible, be exposed to the sun daily. The practice of keeping them in cup- boards until absolutely needed for use should be discouraged. Knives and forks (unless plated) should be cleaned with brick and flannel; if rusty, rub with a fresh- cut potato dipped in ashes. Plate or plated articles can usually be kept clean and bright by washing them with soap and boiling water and rubbing dry while hot with soft cloths. In case of bone, ivory, or wooden handles, care must be taken that they shall never be placed in hot water, which will crack the bone or dissolve the cement which joins them.

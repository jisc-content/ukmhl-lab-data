TIME REQUIRED IN COOKING. Many of the recipes indicate the time of cook- ing. The following is a fair average, when specific directions are not given in the recipe: Roasting,—Ten pounds of beef about two and one-half hours. Ten pounds of mutton about two and one-half hours. Boiling.—Ten pounds of beef about two and one- half hours, after the water boils. Ten pounds of mutton about two and one-half hours, after the water boils. Ten pounds of ham about four hours, after the water boils. Baking.—About twenty minutes to the pound. Simmering is to boil slowly, i. e., to have the liquid so far removed from the direct heat of the fire as to keep it up to the slow-boiling point. To simmer is in most cases to boil properly. Stewing is that process by which the substance is placed in a small portion of fluid and cooked by simmering. Broiling is that process by which the substance is acted upon by the direct heat of the fire, with only the interposition of a gridiron or some similar apparatus. In broiling, the fire should be clear, bright, and free from smoke. It is better to broil before a fire than over it. By the former process the juices of the meat can be caught in a dripping pan, and used, while in the latter manner they are lost in the fire, and tend to give a smoky flavor by their ignition.

MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 134 Pick the greens over carefully; wash in three or four waters, and soak them in cold water for thirty minutes; drain well and put them into a pot of boiling salt water, enough to cover them. If the greens are light, such as spinach, etc., press them down until the pot is full. Cover and boil steadily until tender. When cooked, drain in a colander and press out the water. Season with butter, pepper, and salt. If the greens are young they should cook in twenty minutes;. if they are old, add to the water a small quantity of bicarbonate of soda; boil them for ten or fifteen minutes; turn off the water and replenish with boiling water; add a little salt. Poached egg or hard-boiled egg sliced may be placed on top of the greens when served. Greens may be boiled with salt pork, corned beef, bacon, or ham, putting them into the pot in time to be done with the meat. They may be served sepa- rately or with the meat. STEWED TOMATOES. Peel by pouring boiling-hot water over them, when the skin will easily come off. Cut up the tomatoes, rejecting the unripe and hard parts; put them into a pot, preferably tin or porcelain lined; season with butter, pepper, and salt, and, if the tomatoes are very acid, enough sugar to partially counteract the acidity, but not enough to sweeten them. Cover, and stew gently for three-quarters of an hour, frequently stirring. The stew can be thickened with bread crumbs or rolled cracker. Minced onion cooked with the tomatoes improves the flavor of the stew; or the minced onion may be fried and then cooked with the stew. A mixture of equal quan- tities of tomatoes and young corn, cut from the cob, may be cooked as above.

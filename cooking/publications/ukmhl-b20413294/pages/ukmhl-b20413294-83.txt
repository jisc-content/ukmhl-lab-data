MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. no cry stals of salt adhere to the under part of the fish; put it into a pot, first cutting it into slices; cover with cold water and set it on a rather slow fire; carefully remove the scum as it rises. When it comes to a boil, if not cooked, change the water and let it come to a boil again. Drain well. Separate the flakes, put it into a hot dish, pour over a sauce (see Sauces for Boiled Fish), and serve. CODFISH BALLS. Prepare the fish as for boiling. Pick the fish into very fine pieces or shreds, carefully removing skin and bone. Put it on the fire in a pot of cold water; remove the scum as it rises; let it come to a boil slowly, then pour off the water and replenish with boiling water. Let it come to a boil again, then drain well. Have ready an equal bulk of hot mashed potato worked light with butter and milk; mix mashed potato and fish together while both are hot. It makes a great difference in the light- ness of the balls if the mixing is done while fish and potato are both hot. Form the mixture quick- ly into balls or thick, flat cakes. Put into a vessel enough lard or beef dripping so that when melted it will immerse the balls; when this gets hot, drop in the balls and fry to a light brown. When one side is done turn the other. While mixing the fish and potatoes together, beaten egg may be stirred with the mixture to make the whole smooth; or, after being made into balls, each ball may be dipped into beaten egg before it is dropped into the fat. SALT CODFISH HASH. One-third fish (cooked); two-thirds mashed potato worked light with butter and milk. Chop the cooked fish fine; then mash and work it as fine as possible. This done, work the potato

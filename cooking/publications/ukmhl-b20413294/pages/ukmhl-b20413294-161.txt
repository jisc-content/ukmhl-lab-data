MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. BOILED EGGS. Wipe the eggs clean with a wet cloth and put them into boiling water. If wanted soft, boil steadily for three or fonr minutes; if hard, from five to ten minutes. Eggs may be put into cold water over a brisk fire, and when the water comes to a boil taken up and served. Time, about ten minutes. FRIED EGGS. Heat in a frying pan over a good fire enough beef dripping or lard so that when melted it will cover the bottom of the pan one-quarter of an inch deep. Break the eggs gently into a saucer or small plate, and slip them carefully, one at a time, into the hot fat until the bottom of the pan is covered, taking care not to allow the eggs to adhere together. Lose no time putting the eggs into the pan. The eggs are first emptied into a saucer to keep the yolks from breaking and to detect the bad ones. They are cooked when the whites become firm, and should be taken up before the yolks become hard. When cooked, take them up without delay and pour the grease remaining in the pan over them, or strain it and set it aside in a cool place for cooking purposes. PLAIN" OMELET. The fire must be brisk, as the quicker an omelet is made the better, and the less butter it requires. If the frying pan needs cleansing, instead of washing, heat it and wipe it very clean with a coarse towel. 12 eggs. i teaspoonful salt. 1 cupful of milk or cream. Pepper, butter. Separate the yolks and whites of the eggs; the whites beaten to a stiff froth. Beat the yolks; mix in the pepper and salt; add butter half the size of

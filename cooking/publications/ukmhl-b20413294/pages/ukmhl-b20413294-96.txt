00 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. Put in a layer of the semi-stewed meat, on the meat a layer of chopped onion, on the onion a layer of sliced tomato, on the tomato a half dozen or more pieces of floured butter or dripping, on these a layer of potato, on the potato a layer of meat, and so on in successive layers.

The bottom and side crust may be omitted, or the bottom and sides maybe lined with crackers or slices of bread previously dipped in stock gravy or water.

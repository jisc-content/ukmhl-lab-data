164 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. When yeast is an ingredient and the batter rises over night, the articles to be stirred in the morn- ing should be added thirty minutes before the cakes are to be cooked. The batter should be removed gently from the vessel to the griddle with the least possible disturb- ance to the batter. Baking powder and sweet milk maybe substituted for soda and sour milk. CORN-MEAL BATTER CAKES. 1 quart sour milk. 2 eggs, beaten. 2 teaspoonfuls salt. 1 teaspoonful soda in sufficient hot water to dissolve it. Mix in enough sifted meal to make a thin batter. Cook on a griddle, over a quick, clear fire. Each cake should be buttered as soon as cooked, and kept hot until served. FLANNEL CAKES, No. 1. 1 quart sour milk. 2 teaspoonfuls salt. 2 eggs, well beaten. 1 teaspoonful soda in sufficient hot water to dissolve it. 1 heaping tablespoonful melted lard or butter. Mix in flour enough to make a moderately thin batter. The melted lard should be put in last and thor- oughly incorporated. Instead of sour milk and soda, sweet milk with an adequate amount of baking powder may be used. Cook and serve as directed for Corn-Meal Batter Cakes.

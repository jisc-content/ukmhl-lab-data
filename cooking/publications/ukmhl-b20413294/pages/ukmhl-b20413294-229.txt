MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 223 The Barney Steam Cooker and Sterilizer operates under the principle of a complete circulation of steam. No water from condensation can come in contact with the food. It has been tested that onions, cabbage, fish, pudding, etc., can be cooked at the same time without taint or odor. As a sterilizer it is invaluable. No adulteration of food; no harmful germs. Requires no special attention. Can be used on gas, oil, coal, or wood stoves. The 18 by 24 Barney Steam Cooker is composed of two sectionsâ€”kettle rest and roasting pan; the sections are known as the bottom and top sections, and are made of the No. 24 galvanized sheet steel; the cover is made of the same material. The kettle is made of the best two-cross charcoal tin and has a capacity of 13 gallons of liquid substance, meaning 120 plates of soup or 160 cups of coffee, and will hold rations of vegetables for 100 men. The baking pan is made of No. 27 black iron, is 16^ by 21| by 4^ inches deep; this means a capacity of 75 pounds of roast beef. All food to be cooked in the Barney Steam Cooker is prepared the same as when cooked by the old method. The circular will give the desired information as to how the food is prepared and cooked in the steamer. INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THE COOKER.

In making soup and liquid food there should be no more water used than is required to serve, as there is no boiling away of the water in the kettles. The reason of this is that, the heat being equal on all sides of the kettles, there is no evaporation; so it has been proved that 10 gallons

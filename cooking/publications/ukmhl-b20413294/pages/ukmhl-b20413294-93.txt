MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 87 into the larding needle, about half an inch thick and not over four inches long. Insert the needle half its length into the meat, then load it with a strip of pork, pass the needle through, and leave the pork in the meat. Repeat this process until the meat is larded to the extent desired. If the piece of meat is too thick to run the strip of pork through, lard one side first, then the other. Lard the beef with or in the direction of the grain. If a larding needle is not to be had, make incisions in the meat with a narrow-bladed knife and press the strips of pork into the incisions, or thrust a steel through the meat and put the strips of pork into the holes. The pot in which the beef is to be cooked must not be too large or too small, but large enough to hold the meat without bending or folding it. It may be cooked in an earthen vessel. Cut up the vegetables fine; put into the pot a pint of stock or gravy (stock is preferable); then spread over the bottom of the pot the seasoning, the cut-up vegetables, the rind, and any strips of the pork left from larding. Place on top of all the larded beef, pour over the beef the vinegar, then enough cold water to just cover the meat. Cover, simmer slowly for five or six hours, and turn the meat occa- sionally. If there is any fear of the vegetables scorching, or sticking to the bottom of the pot, stir them gently. Do not allow the pot to stop simmering until the meat is cooked. If the water gets low replenish carefully with boiling water. When done take up the meat and put it in a hot dish, then take up the vegetables, put them around the meat, strain the gravy, and skim off the fat. Return the gravy to the pot, let it boil up, then pour it over the meat and vegeta- bles, and serve. If the gravy is too thick stir in some boiling water. If too 'thin, stir in a little blended browned flour, let it boil up once, season with

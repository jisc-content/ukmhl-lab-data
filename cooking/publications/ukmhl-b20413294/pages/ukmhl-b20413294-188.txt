182 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. A little longer time will be required to bake this than baked bread pudding, owing to the presence of the fruit. BAKED APPLE PUDDING. Apples pared, cored, and sliced. J teaspoonful salt. Sugar, butter, and cinnamon. 1 quart sifted flour. 3 teaspoonfuls baking powder, incorporated with the dry flour. 2 tablespoonfuls lard (half butter is preferable). 1 pint milk (if milk is not available ice water will do). Put flour into a deep dish or pan; mix into it the salt and lard; then add the milk, and work the mix- ture with the hands to a smooth light dough. Roll the dough into a sheet about one-quarter of an inch thick. Have prepared a well-greased bak- ing dish. Cover the bottom and sides of a well- greased baking dish with the rolled dough, press it lightly against the sides and bottom, and cut off the edges above the baking dish with a sharp knife. Put into the bottom of the baking dish a thick layer of sliced apples, sprinkle it with sugar and ground cinnamon, then another layer of apples treated in like manner, and so on successively until the dish is full. The top layer of apples should have a dressing of sugar, cinnamon, and small pieces of butter. Wet the top layer with three or four teaspoonfuls of water, and then sprinkle it lightly with dry flour. Take the remainder of the dough, roll it out thin, and cover the dish with it, pressing the paste down round the edges of the dish to join it with the paste that lines the sides. Make three or four incisions in the cover with a sharp knife. Then bake in a moderate oven from one to one and one-half hours. When a fork easily penetrates the pudding, it is cooked. Eat hot with sauce. Alden dried apples, canned apples, canned peaches, or fresh peaches pared, quartered, and the stones extracted, may be used.

MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 183 BAKED APPLE DUMPLINGS. The apples pared, cored, and quartered. Prepare paste as directed in Baked Apple Pudding. When the paste is rolled, cut it into squares, and in the center of each square place the four parts of an apple; add to each apple a piece of butter the size of a chestnut and a sprinkle of sugar and cinnamon. Envelop the apple in the paste, pressing the edges together. Place the dumplings thus prepared into a well-greased baking pan, edges down. Bake one-half to three-quarters of an hour in a moderate oven. When a fork will easily penetrate the dumplings they are cooked. Alden dried apples may be used. BAKED PUMPKIN PUDDING. 1 quart molasses (not sirup). 1 quart sweet milk. 4 tablespoonf uls ground ginger. 4 tablespoonf uls brown sugar. 1 quart stewed pumpkin. 6 eggs, yolks and whites beaten together. Mix the molasses and milk, adding sugar and ginger. Then stir in gradually the beaten eggs, and then by degrees the stewed pumpkin, or enough of the pumpkin to make a thick batter. Put into a deep dish and bake. Stewed winter squash is an excellent substitute for stewed pumpkin.

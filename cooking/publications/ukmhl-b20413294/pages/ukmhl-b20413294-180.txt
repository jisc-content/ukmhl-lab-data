174 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. PLUM PUDDING, No. 2. Prepare the suet and raisins the day before this pudding is to be made. Six quarts sifted flour; three pounds suet, freed from fiber and chopped moderately fine; three pounds raisins, picked, seeded, chopped, and dredged with flour; two pounds brown sugar, or, in lieu of sugar, three and one-half pints molasses; one table- spoonful salt; two quarts sour milk; if sour milk is not obtainable, put enough vinegar into either sweet or prepared condensed milk to sour it; two dessert- spoonfuls of soda or saleratus, dissolved in a little hot water; eight tablespoonfuls ground cinnamon; three teaspoonfuls ground cloves. Mix ingredients in the following order: Having the flour in a deep dish or pan, stir into it the salt, suet, spices, and sugar or molasses. Put the dissolved soda into the milk; then add the milk or so much of it as will make a thick bat- ter; finally add the dredged fruit; beat the mixture for ten minutes; put it into prepared bag or bags and boil six hours. Serve hot with sauce. The above is enough for thirty men. PLUM PUDDING, No. 3. The quantities here given will serve for a mess of five or six.

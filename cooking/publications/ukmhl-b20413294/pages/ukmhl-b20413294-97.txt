91 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. stuffing as follows: Mix thoroughly into some grated bread crumbs one small onion parboiled and minced, a half teaspoonf ul of sage, pepper and salt, and enough butter, beef dripping, or lard to moisten the mixture. Soak the heart in cold salt water for two hours, then wash it thoroughly in cold water. Put it into a pot of cold water, enough to cover it, add two teaspoon- fuls of salt, cover, and boil for ten minutes. Remove the scum as it rises; take out the heart, pepper and salt the cavities, put in the stuffing, secure it with cross-stitches, put it into a baking pan, spread it over with beef dripping, and sprinkle it with pepper and salt. Pour into the pan about a pint of boil- ing-hot stock, gravy, or beef dripping. Bake in a moderate oven, allowing twenty minutes to the pound. Baste frequently. Be careful that it does not burn. Serve while hot, as it cools rapidly; serve with a gravy from recipe for Gravy for Baked Meats. Veal heart should be thoroughly washed but not soaked nor parboiled. In other respects it is pre- pared and baked as above. Cut up and stew the onions with jelly from the meat added; boil or steam the potatoes, and mash them; grease the inside of a baking dish; line the sides with a portion of the mashed potatoes; place the meat and cooked onions in the center; season with pepper and salt; cover over with the remainder of the mashed potatoes, and bake till the potato cover is brown. As the mashed potatoes absorb the moisture of the meat and render it# dry, about two pints of gravy prepared from the liquor in which the onions were cooked should be poured into the pie after it is taken out of the oven.

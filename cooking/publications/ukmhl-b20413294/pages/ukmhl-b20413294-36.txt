MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 30 Carefully pour the grease which, is on the top into a sance pan, keeping the juice underneath to serve with the meat. Place the grease on the fire and let it cook until it stops sizzling. The sizzling indi- cates that there is still liquid in the fat which must be thoroughly evaporated or it will prevent its pre- servation. Pour through a fine strainer into an earthen jar, and it will keep indefinitely, if in a cool place. The grease of different meats can be kept in the same jar just as they may happen to be cooked; in fact their mixture is an improve- ment. Not only can soup be made from these drippings, but they may also be used for frying or cooking in most all cases where lard or butter is used for those purposes. Three jars of drippings should be kept constantly on handâ€”one for frying fish, one for vegetables, and one for soup and meats. This number is necessary, so the grease left from frying can always be strained back into the jar from which it was taken without injuring the other fat. About once a month, unless entirely used, all the grease should be removed, melted, and strained anew back into the jars, after they have been thoroughly cleansed and scalded. BUTTER. When butter has become rancid it may be ren- dered again eatable by melting it and shaking it repeatedly with boiling water for the purpose of removing the free fatty acids. Slightly rancid butter may be made fresh for im- mediate use on the table by rechurning it in fresh milk, and then washing and salting as in the orig- inal process for making butter.

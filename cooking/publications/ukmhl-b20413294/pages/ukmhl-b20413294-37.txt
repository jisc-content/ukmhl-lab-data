31 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. TO GET A VERY GOOD QUALITY OF COOKING BUT- TER FROM SUET. Place suet in a kettle, over hot fire, with just enough water to prevent it burning or frying. After boiling a minute, turn entire contents of ket- tle into ice water (or very cold water) in a large flat tub. The white fat will rise to the surface, and is to be skimmed off and placed back in kettle and allowed to boil. Change the water in the tub, and again turn the fat into cold water and skim and again put back in the kettle and allow to boil. Again change the water in the tub, turn the fat in, and skim it off at once so that before it is quite cold you can place it in a churn and work it with milk. This is afterwards placed in a wooden or earthen bowl, a little salt added, and when worked over will yield a very acceptable quality of butter, good for cooking vegetables, pastry, sauces, etc., where butter is ordinarily used. If milk can not be obtained the suet may be turned into a wooden or 4earthen bowl and worked out with water and salt. It then produces a very good quality of fat, suit- able for all cooking purposes and with the strong taste of the suet removed. In the first instance, if the fat is too cold on plac- ing in churn or bowl to work easily, heat it very slightly. The butter produced from working this in milk has been used to great advantage on hot breads, in vegetables, etc., and will prove a good substitute for the original article. In the latter case (where worked out with only salt and water) it is to be used solely for cooking. This may be packed away in jars, rolled in cloth well salted, and will keep for a long time.

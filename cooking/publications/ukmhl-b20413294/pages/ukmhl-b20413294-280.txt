Into this bag pour your pudding batter, allowing room for the pudding to swell (be sure of this), and tie up tightly, taking care that no water can get inside of bag. Have boiling two or three boilers of water and drop in your pudding while the water boils; boil two or three hours, according to the size of your pudding. Note.â€”If the water stops boiling your pudding is spoiled. To remove the pudding from the bag when done, dip it into a bucket or pan of cold water. It will then slide out easily when the string of the bag is cut. Before putting in the pudding to boil, drop a tin pan or plate into the boiler; this will prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pot and burning. PLAIN SAUCE FOR FIELD PUDDING. To a quart of sugar add a sufficient quantity of hot water and boil, adding a little spice; boil ten min- utes, then thicken with flour, stirring continually. Toward the last add a little vinegar until taste is satisfactory. Use more spice or sugar if necessary. Boil until it thickens, and serve separately from pudding. If possible use condensed milk.

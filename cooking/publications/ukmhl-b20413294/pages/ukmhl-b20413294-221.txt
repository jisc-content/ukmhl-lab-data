MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 215 SHIELD FOR CAMP FIRE. Made of light boiler or heavy sheet iron. Composed of top and three sides, joined to top by hinges. Fuel is inserted in front, which should be to the windward, and being open, any length of wood can be used. One joint of pipe is sufficient. This is very portable, and in windy weather a comfort for the cooks and those who would gather around the camp fire. (See plates 5 and 6.)

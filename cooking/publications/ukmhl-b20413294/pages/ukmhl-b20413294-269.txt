MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 263 soft. Then put into the soup about two pounds of meat, which should have been previously well washed in cold water, and simmer gently till it is cooked; then take it out and cover it up to keep warm. Mix some flour into a smooth batter with cold water, and add it to the soup, keeping it well stirred to prevent it burning; boil for thirty minutes and serve. If flour is not to be had, use instead pow- dered biscuits, previously soaked in cold water. The remainder of the meat should be soaked and well washed in cold water, then put into the camp kettle, with sufficient water to cover it, and allowed to boil for thirty minutes; the water in which it was boiled should now be thrown away, the camp kettle refilled with fresh cold water, and the meat boiled till done. BOILED SOUP DUMPLING. Make a light dough, or procure from the bakery, dough which is ready for the oven. Flour the hands well and mold the dough into balls about the size of an egg. Drop them succes- sively into boiling water. Boil in the soup about fifteen minutes. STEWS OF BEEF OR MUTTON. Joint or cut up your meat in small pieces, and place in the stewpan; add a couple of slices of bacon, cut thin; a few raw onions, peeled and cut up; pep- per and salt to taste. Pour m hot water until you have covered the meat with about two inches of water on top; put the lid on and simmer slowly until the water has boiled down, say one-half, or until it becomes thick or milky from the juices extracted from the meats. If it is too thin to be palatable, thicken with grated hard bread, or a paste of water and flour, mixed in a tin cup and poured into the stew.

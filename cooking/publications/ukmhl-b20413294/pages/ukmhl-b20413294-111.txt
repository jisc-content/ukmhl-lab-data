MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 105 thick or thin. Remove the scum as it rises. While boiling turn the pork several times. As the water evaporates, replenish with boiling water. While cooking, the pork must be kept covered with water; when cooked drain and serve. Many vegetables, such as turnips, cabbages, potatoes, and greens, may be boiled with pork. A cake of fat will form on the surface of the water in which the pork has been cooked, when it becomes cold. This should be saved for cooking purposes. BAKED PORK AND BEANS. 2 quarts beans. 3 pounds salt pork. 1 teaspoonful bicarbonate of soda. Time to bake, six to eight hours. Pick over the beans, wash, and soak them over night in cold water; soft water is preferable. Par- boil the pork and cut it into thin slices. Drain the soaked beans; put them into a pot with enough fresh cold water to cover them plentifully; put in the soda. Cover; boil for fifteen or twenty min- utes; remove the scum as it rises; pour off the water; replace with boiling water; cover; boil steadily until tender; drain and season with pep- per. If the pork is freshly cured, add salt. Put one- half of the beans in a deep baking pan; lay over them the sliced pork, then cover the pork with the other half of the beans. Pour over from a half pint to a pint of boiling water, and bake with a uniform heat. Every hour add from a half to a cupful of boiling water. If the beans show signs of burning, cover them with a tin pan and remove it in time to allow the top to brown. Serve hot or cold. Cold beans may be made into a salad. If preferred, the beans and pork may be put into the dish in layers, finishing with a layer of pork. A tablespoonful of molasses, or an equivalent of sugar, to the quart of beans may be added when the beans are put into the baking pan.

MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 84 less than three-quarters of an inch nor more than an inch and a quarter thick. If beating is neces- sary, beat on both sides, hat not enough to tear the beef and allow the juices to escape. Cleanse the steak, but do not put it into water. Have the frying pan very hot and dry; put in the steak, cover it with a tin plate or pan, and turn the steak often, preferably with a pair of meat tongs. If a knife and fork are used, insert the fork in the outer or skin edge of the steak. A steak an inch to an inch and a quarter thick will be cooked in twelve or fifteen minutes. When cooked put it on a hot dish and season with pepper and salt. The juices will then escape and furnish the gravy. Or, have ready in a hot dish a half tea- spoonful of salt, a quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper, a piece of butter or beef dripping not quite the size of an egg; add two tablespoonfuls of boiling water. Mix well together. Put the steak into it and turn it over once so that both sides will be moistened with the gravy, and serve. If this does not furnish enough gravy, add two or more tablespoonfuls of boiling water to the fat remaining in the pan, mix thoroughly, pour it over the steak, and let it mix with the other gravy. Prepare and broil mutton chops, venison, and pork steaks as above. Meat prepared in this way is quite equal to that broiled on a gridiron, and this method does not waste its juices. On a gridiron. Prepare the steak as directed for broiling in a fry- ing pan. Have ready a bed of live coals; wood coals are the best. Wipe the gridiron clean; put it over the bed of coals. As soon as heated put the steak on it; broil, turning often. If the fire smokes or blazes from the dripping fat withdraw the gridiron for a moment. It should cook in fifteen minutes.

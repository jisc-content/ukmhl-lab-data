MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 119 French cooks generally use carbonate of ammonia to preserve color of vegetables. A small quantity (little pinch) is mixed in water in which they are to be boiled. Ammonia evaporates in boiling, leaving no ill effects. It also prevents the odor of boiling cabbage. A little baking soda softens water and is good for freshening and making tender green vegetables that are a little old, or not qnite fresh. Boil fresh, young vegetables in hard water. A little salt will harden water at once. If onions are peeled under water the eyes will not suffer with tears. RULES FOR COOKING VEGETABLES. Summer vegetables should if possible be cooked on the same day they are gathered. Vegetables must be picked over, all decayed or unripe parts removed, then washed thoroughly in cold water. When they are to be boiled they should be put into enough boiling salt water to cover them and boiled steadily until done. If the pot should need replenishing, boiling water should always be used. The vessel must be kept covered. Old and strong vegetables should be boiled in two or more waters. They must be thoroughly done, but if boiled too much they become watery. When the vegetables are cooked they should be thoroughly drained and served in hot dishes. If the water boils a long time before the vegetables are put in, it loses all its gases, and the mineral ingredients are deposited on the bottom and sides of the kettle so that the water is flat and tasteless, and the vegetables will not look green nor have a fine flavor.

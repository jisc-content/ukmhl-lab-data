MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 194 A SIMPLE METHOD OF MAKING COFFEE, No. 1. Allow one-half ounce or one tablespoonful of ground coffee to each person; to every ounce allow one-half pint of water. Have a small iron ring made to fit the top of the coffeepot inside, and to this ring sew a small muslin bag (the muslin for the purpose must not be too thin). Fit the bag into the pot, pour the ground coffee into the bag; pour over as much boiling w^ater as is required; close the lid, and, when all the water has filtered through, remove the bag, and send the cof- fee to the table. Making it in this manner prevents the necessity of pouring the coffee from one vessel to another, which cools and spoils it. The water should be poured on the coffee gradually, so that the infusion may be stronger; and the bag must be well made, that none of the grounds may escape through the seams, and so make the coffee thick and muddy. A SIMPLE METHOD OF MAKING COFFEE, No. 2. Put the dry coffee in the pot; stir it while heating; then pour over it one quart of boiling water to each ounce of coffee, and set the pot where it will keep hot but not boil. After standing ten minutes it is ready to drink. TEA. For mixed tea the usual proportion is four spoon- fuls of black to one of green. The water with which tea is to be made should be fresh from the well or cistern; it is better if from a spring or rapid stream; it should not be made from water that has stood on the stove or in the water back. The making should be accurately timed so that it may be served as soon as drawn. Bring the water to a hard boil as quickly as pos- sible; fill the teapot with boiling water and set it

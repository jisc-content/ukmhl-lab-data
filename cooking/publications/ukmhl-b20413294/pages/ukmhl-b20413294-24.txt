MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 18 Baking is that process by which a substance is cooked by heat in an oven. The temperature for baking most articles is about 400° F. This, of all cooking, requires great care and con- stant attention to detail. The action of the weather, exposure, locality, and fuel are hardly ever the same; thus it will be seen that allowance must be made for these changes. Nothing is gained by the slightest haste. Full time must be allowed and, with attention, you may be sure of the most excel- lent results at all times. An easy method to test the heat of an oven.—If the hand and naked arm can be held in the oven for fifteen seconds the temperature is about right. If this can not be done without distress the oven is too hot. If the exposed part can be held comfortably in the oven for a greater length of time, it is too cold. This method allows the cook to determine approximately the proper degree of heat. Experi- ence will enable him to arrive at it precisely. Boiling is the most abused method of cooking. Rapid boiling should be avoided. Additional heat is not generated by furious boiling, and much of the aroma of a substance escapes when steam is rapidly generated. To boil properly, the fire should be clear, and after the boiling has com- menced the vessel so separated from the heat by the interposition of stove covers, or so far removed from the fire that the liquid shall have only a regular and very gentle movement, with slow steam generation and consequent slow evaporation. In boiling at least two articles of the Army ration— beans and peas—it is desirable to use soft water. Hard water, if hardness depends upon the pres- ence of carbonate of lime, can be rendered soft by boiling it an hour and then allowing it to cool, when most of the lime will be precipitated. For cooking beans and peas the water thus treated can be used at once, after carefully decanting

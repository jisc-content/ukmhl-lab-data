The bakers descend into the large trench 6 and knead the dongh in the trench a, in the trongh.

Heat it with pieces of wood in small sticks, and place the bread on brush- wood, covering the excavation with branches, plank, hay, or grass. Figs. A and B are two modes of making kneading troughs by excavation and plank. Vertical sections perpendicular to their length. Fig. jL. Plate 13.

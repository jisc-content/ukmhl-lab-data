MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 22 Articles cooked this way should be turned over once and when done set in a strainer to drip or dry; if doughnuts, dipped in powdered sugar; if pota- toes or meats, seasoned and served very hot. Steak for frying, if tough, can be made tender by pounding to mash the fiber and rolling in flour before frying. When frying, meats should be covered. Sauteing is that process by which a substance is cooked in a frying pan or skillet with just sufficient fat to cover the bottom of the pan. The fat must be frying hot before the substance is put in it. Seasoning.—As salt and pepper are always at hand for use on the table, they should be used spar- ingly in the kitchen. It is much easier to add these articles to the prepared food than to eliminate them from it. The seasonings given in the recipes are suggestive and not arbitrary. They can be varied to suit individual taste or convenience. Mixing.—Preciseness in the preparation of ingre- dients is an important element of success in cooking. Accurate measuring is the habit of the careful and industrious cook; guessing at proportions is the practice of the indifferent and lazy cook. After the ingredients have been carefully deter- mined, they should be incorporated as laid down in the recipe. Failure to make a good dish when ingredients have been carefully prepared is often due to the fact that they have not been mixed properly. In many cases recipes for cooking are printed upon the packages containing food, such as corn- starch, chocolate, gelatin, condensed milk, hominy, macaroni, yeast powders, etc. In such cases these printed recipes should be followed instead of those printed in the books or handed down by old house- keepers, since manufacturers know the strength and quality of their special productions, and are better capable of giving instructions than those who have experimented only with the general products.

If the command halts for more than one day, these kitchens are susceptible of great improvement; the chimney can be made of mud, or twigs and mud, and the draft may be increased by using short pieces of hoop iron as bars, stretched across the trench to sup- port a filling in of clay around each kettle; or, in other words, to make a regular place for each kettle, into which it will fit exactly, so that its position may be changed. As the day following the wind may change to an exactly opposite direction, a 'simi- lar trench must be dug in continuation of the former one, the same chimney being used. In this manner one chimney will serve for trenches cut to suit the wind blowing from all four quarters. The open- ings from these trenches into the chimney must all be closed with sod, except the one in use. In some places, where bricks or stones suitable to the pur- pose are to be had, it is better to construct these kitchens on the ground instead of below the surface. In well-wooded countries, two logs side by side and parallel to the direction of the wind, the fire being kindled between them, make a good kitchen. In such places fuel is no object, so the construction of chimneys can be dispensed with, and the kettles hung from a stick resting at each end on a forked upright. HOW TO MAKE A COOKING FIRE FOR A SMALL CAMP. Lay down two green poles (5 by 6 inches thick, and 2 feet long) 2 or 3 feet apart, with notches in the upper side about 10 to 12 inches apart. Let the ground be leveled meantime. Take two more green poles (6 by 8 inches thick, and 4 feet long) and lay them in the notches. Procure a good supply of dry wood, bark, brush, or chips, and start your fire on the

Peas and beans are the most nutritious of all vegetables and contain as much carbon as wheat and almost double the amount of nitrogen (muscle- forming food). Cabbage leaves are rich in gluten and therefore nutritious. The mushroom also is said to contain fifty-six per cent of gluten, and dried cauliflower more than either. Spinach has a direct effect on the kidneys. The common dandelion, used as greens, is excellent for the same trouble. Asparagus purges the blood. Celery acts admirably upon the nervous system, and is a cure for rheumatism and neuralgia. Tomatoes act upon the liver. Beets and turnips are excellent appetizers. Lettuce and cucumbers are cooling in their effects upon the system. Onions, garlic, leeks, olives, and shallots possess medicinal virtues of a marked character, stimulat- ing the circulatory system, and the consequent in- crease in the saliva and the gastric juice promotes digestion. Red onions are an excellent diuretic, and the white ones are recommended to be eaten raw as a remedy for insomnia. A soup made from onions is regarded as an excellent restorative in weakness of the digestive organs.

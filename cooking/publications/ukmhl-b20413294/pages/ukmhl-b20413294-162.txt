Heat in a frying pan a piece of butter the size of an egg; when it becomes hot pour the mix- ture gently into the pan. As the omelet begins to "set," loosen it with a thin-bladed knife from the sides and bottom of the pan. It should cook in ten or twelve minutes. Or, put the frying pan into a hot oven when the middle of the omelet is set, and bake to a delicate brown. When cooked, to turn it out, proceed as follows: Put a hot dish bottom-up on the pan,. hold the handle of the pan with the right hand, back of the hand down, spread the left hand back uppermost on top of the dish, turn both hands, emptying the omelet into the dish, the browned side uppermost. It should be eaten at once, as it falls rapidly. It may be eaten with pepper and salt or powdered sugar or sirup. Minced ham, tongue, and fish are sometimes mixed with omelet batter and cooked as above. To make jam omelet, as soon as one side becomes brown, spread it over with jam, double, and serve. POACHED EGGS. It is advisable not to poach more than three or four eggs at a time; preferably one. Nearly fill a frying pan with cold water, adding two teaspoonfuls of salt and one tablespoonful of vinegar to a quart of water. When the water boils, break a fresh egg into a saucer or small plate, slip it carefully into the boiling water, and as near the surface as possible. Dip up some boiling water with a spoon and pour it over the egg. Boil gently for three or four minutes. When cooked take it up with a perforated skimmer, giving the skimmer a light shake over the pan to drain the water. Lay it on toasted bread and sprinkle with pepper and salt.

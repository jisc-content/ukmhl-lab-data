MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 96 Cut the liver into slices a quarter of an inch thick, and soak it one hour in cold, salt water; rinse well with warm water, wipe it dry, and dip each slice into flour seasoned with pepper and salt; put into a frying pan enough lard, beef dripping, or bacon fat so that when melted it will just cover the bottom of the pan; when this is hot put in the liver and fry both sides a deep brown; then dish; pour the grease remaining in the pan over the liver, and serve; or make a gravy as follows: Put into the pan a lump of butter or beef dripping, the size to be determined by the quantity of gravy wanted, with a half pint or more of boiling water and pep- per and salt to suit taste; mix them well; stir in gradually two or more tablespoonfuls of blended browned flour; let it boil up once; pour it over the liver, and serve. If the fat remaining from the frying is burnt, tlirow it away and wash out the frying pan before proceeding to make the gravy. Fried bacon may be served with the liver, frying the bacon first, using the fat for frying the liver. Fried onions may be served with liver. MARROW BONES. Have the bones neatly sawed into convenient sizes and cover the ends with a small piece of common crust made with flour and water, over this tie a floured cloth, and place them upright in a sauce- pan of boiling water, taking care there is sufficient to cover the bones. Boil two hours, remove the cloth and paste, and serve with dry toast. COOKED SALT BEEF. Sail beef before being cooked should be well cashed, and then, when practicable, soaked in cold water for twenty-four hours, changing the water three times.

146 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. Put it, and the water it was soaked in, into a pot, adding the salt; cover and boil slowly all day and as far into the evening as the fire is kept going, and it may be left on the fire all night in order to com- plete its cooking. The next morning it may be served for breakfast, and eaten with salt, or with butter or sirup; or, the cooking may continue until dinner time. In cold weather it may be packed in wooden or earthen vessels, and rewarmed as wanted. Care must be taken while boiling the hominy that it does not burn; it is better to boil it on the back of the stove where the heat is not great; when neces- sary to replenish with water add boiling water care- fully. When hominy has been boiled as directed above, it should, when cold, be an agglutinated, moist mass and free from water. An earthen vessel is the best for boiling hominy, as it answers for keeping the hominy in after it is cooked. Cold boiled hominy may be fried in butter, beef dripping, or lard. When put into the frying pan season with pepper and salt, stir occasionally until it is heated throughout, then press it down lightly, and fry it until the under side is browned. When done put a hot dish bottom up on the pan, turn over pan and dish and remove the pan, leav- ing the hominy in the dish, the brown crust upper- most. CRACKED WHEAT. One heaping teaspoonful of salt to one quart of wheat. Cover the wheat with cold water and let it soak over night in a cool place. In the morning put the wheat, with the water it was soaked in, into a pot. Cover closely and cook gently until soft, stirring it frequently to prevent scorching. It should cook in from one to one and one-half hours. If necessary to replenish the water, add boiling water carefully. When cooked it should be a moist mass.

273 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS* The bread will not burn, as in rising it will not reach the bottom of the upper mess pan. The rough-cut edges of the lower mess pan afford egress to any gases that may be disengaged. FIELD BREAD, BAKED IN FRYING PAN. Prepare the dough as above described; grease the frying pan and set it over hot embers until the grease begins to melt; put the dough, rolled to a thickness of half an inch, in the pan and set it on the fire; shake the pan every few moments to pre- vent the dough from adhering; after the crust has formed on the bottom take the bread out of the pan and set it up on edge, close to the fire, turning it occasionally to insure its being baked through. PIE CRUST. To four quarts of flour sift three spoonfuls of bak- ing powder, and a spoonful of salt; add one to two quarts of good bacon fat; cold water enough to make a good stiff dough without kneading. Roll with a bottle to a thin even sheet; line inside of panâ€” leave sufficient for a covering; cut hole in center of upper crust and bake in hot oven one hour. As a good filling for meat pies, observe the general rules seen in meat stewed, etc., using game and cooked meats if possible. SUET, OR FIELD PUDDING. Cut up fine about two quarts of bacon, or salt fat pork, or suet in small dice-shaped pieces. To six quarts of flour add six spoonfuls of baking powder, two quarts of molasses, or one and one-half quarts of sugar, two quarts of currants, raisins, or chopped fruits, one quarter pint of mixed spices. Mix into a good stiff batter with a spoon, and it is ready for the bag and pot. Prepare from a flour bag (inside one) a bag; dip into boiling water and flour well inside, this prevents the pudding from sticking to 9281 18

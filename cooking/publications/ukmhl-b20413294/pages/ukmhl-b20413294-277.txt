MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 271 Prepare a saucepan with water sufficient to more than cover the rice by two inches, and in which a little salt has been shaken. The water shonld be brought to a boil and kept there until it is drained off. When the water is boiling sprinkle in the rice gradually so as not to stop the boiling. Boil for about twenty minutes, keeping the pan covered. Then throw into a colander, covering same; let stand several minutes, this serving a double pur- pose, allowing rice to drain as well as steam. Every grain should be found separate and dry. Remember, boil rapidly from the time you cover the pot until you take it off; this allows each grain to swell to three times its normal size, and the motion prevents the grains from sticking together. Don't stir it, as this will cause it to fall to the bottom and burn. In order to see if the rice is done, take out one of the grains and crush it between the fingers; if well done it will mash easily and feel perfectly soft. BAKING-POWDER BISCUITS AND BREAD. To six quarts of flour add eight tablespoonfuls of baking powder, two spoonfuls salt, and stir thor- oughly together; then add about eight tablespoon- fuls of clear cold bacon fat; stir again, and add sufficient cold water (never warm water) quickly, and stir to a smooth but not stiff batter. Mix or stir it as little as possible—never knead it—or you will lose the strength (gases) of the powder. Roll or break into equal-sized biscuits; or, best, drop from a large spoon into well-greased pans. Put into a good hot oven, especially hot on top, and bake until done—usually from 15 to 20 minutes, if oven is good. Never knead the dough, as kneading kills the leavening properties of baking-powder bread. Yeast, or baker's bread, on the other hand, requires much kneading and a good stiff dough.

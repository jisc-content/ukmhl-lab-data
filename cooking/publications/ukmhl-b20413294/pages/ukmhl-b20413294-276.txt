Lay two thin slices of bacon on top; place in a Dutch oven (tin plate and all) with lid on; heap live coals of fire on top of lid, and bake "until the bacon is done, or to a light crust of brown. TO BAKE PORK AND BEANS WITHOUT OVEN. Have a trench 18 inches wide, 18 inches deep, and from 4 to 6 feet long; keep a fire in this for several hours; let fire die down so that there shall be a bed of coals and hot ashes; it is then ready for use. Prepare beans as usual for baking and place in mess kettles; pour in three quarts of hot water; cover with tin plate or mess pan; scrape out the embers until kettle will be near bottom of trench; cover first with ashes, then with coals, and leave undisturbed for six to eight hours. It. is a good plan for cooks to soak beans over night and carry them to the next camp. This will permit the furnishing of baked beans at supper while marching. RICE. Remember that rice swells very much in boiling, and that a teacupful makes a large dish when cooked. Place in camp kettle, and cover the rice with about two inches of water; boil slowly, or rather simmer, until it is tender, then by gradually slowing the heat let the water evaporate, thus leav- ing the grains swollen and dry. Rice thus prepared can be used as a vegetable or a pudding by adding salt and pepper in the former and sugar in the latter case. HOW TO BOIL RICE. Pick your rice clean and wash it in two cold waters, drawing off the last water just as you are ready to put the rice in the saucepan for boiling.

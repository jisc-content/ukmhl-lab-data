MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 108 peel off the skin. Be careful not to tear off the fat. Rub into the fat some brown sugar; then stick whole cloves, about two inches apart, into the sugared fat; put the ham into a dry baking pan; put it into the oven, and bake it in a moderate heat from half an hour to one hour, or until it becomes a light brown.* Eat it hot or cold. If to be eaten cold set it aside and do not cut it until it is thoroughly cold. It will add to the appearance of the ham to sprinkle over it some grated bread crumbs or rolled cracker before sticking it with cloves. Ham for boiling- should be from six months to two years old. If newer it should be broiled, fried, baked, or may be boiled. BROILED HAM. Old hams, if soaked over night and then boiled for a short time (sufficient only to soften them) are better for broiling or frying than the dry ham with- out previous preparation. Prepare the ham as directed for Frying. Wipe the gridiron clean and heat it. Put on the sliced ham and broil both sides brown. Put it into a hot dish containing a little melted butter seasoned with pepper; turn the ham over once to butter both sides. FRIED HAM AND EGGS. Cut the ham into slices about a fourth of an inch thick, trim off the rind, put the sliced ham into a pan. Cover with boiling water and soak for a half hour. If the ham is old and very salty soak it several hours in cold water before using the boiling water. Wipe it dry. Have the frying pan hot and dry. Cover the bottom of the pan with ham and fry brown on both sides. When cooked take it up and set it aside in a hot dish to keep warm. * The above is practically the recipe known as the " General Scott."

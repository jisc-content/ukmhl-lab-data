MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 211 ground between the poles. The air will circulate under and through your fire, and the poles are just the right distance apart to set your camp kettle, frying pan, or coffee pot on. If you are going to cook several meals in this place, it will pay you to put up a crane. This is built as follows: Cut two green posts (2 inches thick and 3 feet long), which drive into the ground a foot from either end of your fire, and then split the top end of each with the ax (unless they be forked). Then cut another green pole, of same size, and long enough to reach from one of these posts to the other; flatten the ends and insert them in the splits. The posts should be of such height that when this pole is passed through the bail of the camp kettle, the latter will swing just clear of the fire. Other cook- ing utensils may be used as required. DISPOSAL OF REFUSE. Particular attention is directed to the cleanly method of burning all kitchen refuse in the camp fire; it will not affect the cooking. Burn every- thing—coffee grounds, parings, bones, meats, even old tin cans, for if thrown out anywhere, even buried, they attract flies. Tin cans are flytraps—burned and cleaned out of fire daily they are harmless. Fires should be cleaned of burnt refuse once a day, as refuse burned will not attract flies. Cleanliness is a good doctor. The burning of refuse, not burying it, is a splendid rule, especially in a large command or permanent camp. EXTEMPORIZED STOVES, OR COOKING PLACE. (With Plates.)

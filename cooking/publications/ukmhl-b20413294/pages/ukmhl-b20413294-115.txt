MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 109 PLAIN BACON (NEW ORLEANS STYLE). Fry bacon crisp in hot dripping in the same man- ner as doughnuts. FANCY BACON (NEW ORLEANS STYLE). Roll very thin slices of breakfast bacon in fritter batter or bread crumbed with egg, fry in boiling dripping or lard, and serve on toast or fried mush. BROILED BACON (NEW ORLEANS STYLE). Broil and put in hot oven; serve immediately. FRIED LIVER (BEGUE STYLE). Cut liver half an inch thick, put in platter, sprinkle with sufficient salt, pepper, and a little flour, fry in hot dripping or lard, the same as doughnuts, turn- ing pieces over two or three times, and serve hot. BOILED MUTTON. Time, fifteen minutes to the pound, or longer, depending on the quality and shape of the piece. Cleanse the mutton. Put it into a pot of boiling water rather more than enough to cover it. Cover; boil gently until cooked. Remove the scum as it rises. While boiling turn the mutton several times. If the water needs replenishing, use boiling water, and add it carefully. When cooked serve with sauce for boiled mutton. One bay leaf for every two pounds of mutton may be put into the pot with the mutton. The liquor may be served with the mutton or made into stock or soup, or it can be saved for hashes, stews, gravies, etc., instead of water. If boiled in an iron pot, and to be kept for any of the above uses, pour it into a tin or earthen vessel and keep it in a cool place. If, when cold, there is a layer of fat on top remove it, but do not use it for cooking.

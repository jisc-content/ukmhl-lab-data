If the wind is blowing heavily dig a hole for the oven and fire of sufficient depth to bring the top of the oven on a level with ground, piling the wood on the edges of the bank for additional pro- tection. If weather is good there is no need of this. When practicable use a tent fly as a shade for the cooks. Use the best fuel for baking, and stack it so that it may dry. Splitting or chopping wood is not re- quired, except to first kindle fire. Build a fire of any convenient fuel, wood, buffalo chips, leaves (anything), and when well started, place over the fire your skeleton stove.

MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 121 Potatoes should be stored in a cool, dry, and dark place. They should be sorted often, the bad ones removed, and the sprouts rubbed off. Paring potatoes before boiling them is wasteful and should only be resorted to late in the spring, when the potato has commenced to sprout. If pared they should be laid in cold wates for a half hour before cooking. Potatoes should be of a uniform size that they may be cooked in the same time. If they are of unequal size cut the large ones. The potato being composed largely of starch, cooking breaks the cells and sets the starch free. If the potato is removed from the heat and moisture as soon as this occurs it will be dry and mealy, but if it is allowed to boil or bake even for a few moments the starch will absorb the moisture and the potato will become soggy and have a bad flavor.

Put them into a pot of boiling salt water, enough to cover them. Cover; simmer steadily until a fork will easily pierce the largest. If cooked too much they become watery. When cooked drain them thoroughly, and set the pot uncovered near the fire for five minutes to dr% the potatoes, shaking them two or three times dur- ing this period. If desired to serve the potatoes mashed, peel and mash them thoroughly, and work in pepper and salt to taste, a tablespoonful of melted butter or drip- ping to every dozen of potatoes, and sufficient hot milk or water to make the mass about the consis- tency of soft dough. They should be mashed in a tin, wood, or earthen vessel, as iron discolors them. When thoroughly mixed, beat them with a large

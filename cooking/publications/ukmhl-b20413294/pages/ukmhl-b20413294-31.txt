CHOICE AND DESCRIPTION OF MEATS. Contracts for the Army require that fresh beef shall be good in quality and condition, fit for im- mediate use, and from fore and hind quarter meats proportionally, including all the best cuts thereof. * Beef from bulls, stags, or diseased cattle shall not be delivered. The necks of the cattle slaughtered for beef shall be cut off at the fourth vertebral joint, and the breasts trimmed down; the shanks of fore quarters shall be cut off four inches above the knee joint, and of hind quarters eight inches above the hock joint. Necks, shanks, and kidney tallow shall be excluded from delivery.* Beef cattle may be placed in the following order, as to the character of eating beef: 1. Spayed heifer from four to seven years old. 2. Steer or bullock (never worked) from four to six years old. 3. Free-martin (or barren heifer) not over eight years old. * It was found by weighing a steer and dressing it according to contract that theâ€” Fore quarters weighed '610 pounds 15 ounces. Hind quarters weighed 268 pounds 13 ounces. Excess of fore quarters, 42 pounds 2 ounces. This proportion has been found to be general; consequently, in receiving fresh beef under contract it should be expected that the proportion of fore-quarters meat to hind-quarters meat would be about as 8 is to 7.

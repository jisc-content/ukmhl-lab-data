MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 112 and loin. Chops are cut from the loin, and the leg is used for cutlets and fillets. The fillet is a solid piece cut from the leg, also called a cushion, and does not correspond with the fillet of beef. Do not buy veal that is too young, as it is not only unwholesome but dangerous. It may be known by the small and tender bones; the flesh has a bluish tinge and a soft, flabby appearance. A calf should not be killed until it is two months old; then the flesh is firm, with a pinkish tinge, and the bones are hard. The loin, shoulder, fillet, and breast are used for roasting. The knuckle, which is the lower part of the leg after the cutlets are taken off, and the neck are used for soups, stews, and pies. ROAST LOIN OF VEAL. Wipe the loin, place in a baking pan, dredge it with pepper, add a teaspoonful of salt and a cup of water to the pan, and place in a very quick oven for fifteen minutes. Then cool the oven somewhat by closing the drafts, and roast slowly fifteen minutes for every pound of veal, basting frequently, at first with the water in the pan and afterwards with its own gravy. Veal must be well done to be eatable. When done make a gravy the same as roast beef. VEAL POT-PIE. Take two pounds veal (rib piece is good), cut in small pieces, and place in pot (having placed small plate in bottom to prevent meat from burning). Put in two quarts water, hot or cold. Boil one and one-half hours. Make one quart flour into biscuit dough and one-half hour before serving drop in small lumps of the dough. Be sure there is water enough to cover meat entirely when dumplings are put in and cover closely for twenty minutes. Pota- toes may be cooked with it if desired.

235 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. PORTABLE OVENS. This class of ovens is generally so constructed that they are ready for rise at all times. Those on wheels form part of the train of an army. Many patented varieties were used during the late war, in the field, which gave satisfactory results. Con- structed mainly of iron, it is claimed the quality of the bread baked in them is inferior to that made in brick or earthen ovens. SMALL PORTABLE FIELD OVEN (PLATE 14). The body of each oven is made of two pieces of TVinch sheet iron. These sheets are 5 feet long by 2 feet 6 inches wide, and so curved that, when their upper edges are connected and the lower edges fixed in the ground, they form an arch, the span of which is 3 feet 9 inches and the rise 1 foot 4 inches. The lower edge of each sheet is bent outward into a flange, so as to secure a firm rest on the ground. On the inside of each sheet are riveted 3 longi- tudinal bars, 1 inch wide and f inch thick, and on the outside 5 transverse ribs, 1\ inches wide by f inch thick (fig. 2). The upper ends of the trans- verse ribs on one of the sheets are formed into hooks, and those of the other sheet into eyes, by means of which the sheets are securely attached to each other along the ridge of the oven when erected. The front of the oven is closed by a two-handled iron door (fig. 1), which is kept in place by means of hooks and eyes. When the soil is of clay, or of other favorable quality, the rear end of the oven may be closed by the natural earth; but if it is sandy or loose, a sheet- iron plate will be required to close it. No chimney is necessary. When set up, the whole, excepting the door, is covered with a mass of earth 8 inches in thickness.

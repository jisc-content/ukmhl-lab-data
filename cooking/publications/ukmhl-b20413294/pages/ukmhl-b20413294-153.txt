147 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. Hot milk may be used instead of water, to be added as evaporation takes place. It is safest, in order to prevent scorching, to cook it in a double boiler. HOMINY GRITS. Hominy grits may be prepared and cooked in the same manner as cracked wheat. It may be baked as follows: To a pint of boiled hominy grits, cold, add two eggs well beaten; a small piece of butter and sufficient boiled milk to make a moderately thin mass. Put into a baking dish, and bake thirty minutes. FRIED GRITS. Wash one pint grits in cold water. Cover with two quarts tepid water and soak over night. In the morning put it in a boiler and boil one hour. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour into a square mold and put away to cool. When cold, cut into slices, dust each slice with flour, and fry in fresh dripping until a light brown. INDIAN-MEAL MUSH. 1 cup Indian meal. 2 quarts boiling water. 1 tablespoonful salt. To prevent the meal from lumping, mix it with sufficient cold water to make a thin batter, then gradually pour in the batter so as not to reduce the water below the boiling point, stirring it in with a wooden spoon or round stick. Cover closely and let it cook gently from one to two hours, stirring frequently or continuously, to prevent scorching. The mush should be made thick. When finished, if too thick, add boiling water carefully. Cold mush may be cut into slices from one-half to three-quarters of an inch thick, and fried brown on both sides in hot beef dripping, lard, or butter,

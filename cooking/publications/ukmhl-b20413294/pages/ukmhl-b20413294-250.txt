MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 244 flame is once started, it should be fed with little bits of sticks or bark, split with a knife or rubbed between the fingers into fibers, until it has gained enough strength to grapple with thicker ones. FUEL. There is something of a knack in finding firewood. It should be looked for under bushes. The stump of a tree, that is rooted nearly to the ground, has often a magnificent root, fit to blaze throughout the night. Dry manure of cattle is an excellent fuel. Dry fuel gives out far more heat than damp fuel. Bones of animals also furnish an excellent substi- tute for firewood. FIREWOOD should be cut into lengths of 1 foot and about 2 inches square. When nothing but brushwood is to be had, the trench should be deepened where the fire is lit. Damp or very sappy wood should be avoided. Bones can be used when other fuel is not to be had. During a march, it is well to pick up and throw into the wagons all the dry wood that may be found along the road. FILTERS. Two barrels, one inside the other, having a space of 4 or even 6 inches clear all around between them filled with layers of sand, gravel, and charcoal, form an excellent filter. The inside one, without a bot- tom, rests on stones embedded in sand, the sand reaching above the chine, and above this, between the barrels, is a layer of charcoal and of coarse gravel. Plate 17.

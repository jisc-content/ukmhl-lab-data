232 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. Care should be taken that the ovens and lids are quite hot before the dough is placed for baking. During the preparations for the baking the ovens and lids should be heated over the fire in the trench. When a good mass of coals has been obtained, the dough should be placed in the heated ovens and the lids put on. The ovens should then be embedded in the coals and the lids covered with coals and hot ashes. If there are not enough coals to cover the lids a small fire may be built over each. Mess pans may be used in a similar manner for baking bread, but great care will be necessary to prevent burning, owing to the thinness of the metal. DOUGH. Dough may be mixed in mess pans, on a piece of canvas, on a rubber blanket, or in the flour barrel or flour sack. Dough should be set near the fire, and be allowed to rise well before baking. Very little fire is re- quired at first. If time and fuel are to be considered, biscuits will prove more suitable than large loaves. FIELD BAKE HOUSES. During good weather a tent fly, awning, paulin, tent, or interior of a wagon will answer for a tem- porary shelter under which the labor of the baker can be performed, but in rainy or cold weather a board or more substantial building is essential. To knead and raise bread successfully in the field with a temperature below 65° or 70° F. requires a long time, and is attended with difficulties and much uncertainty. UTENSILS NECESSARY FOR A FIELD OVEN. One dough trough and cover made of pine plank 2 or 2.25 inches thick, about 2 feet 6 inches wide at top and 22 inches at the bottom, and about 18 inches

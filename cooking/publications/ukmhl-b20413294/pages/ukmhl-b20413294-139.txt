133 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. BOILED LIMA BEANS. Time, thirty to forty minutes. Shell the beans and put them in cold water for fifteen minutes; drain and put them into a pot of boiling salt waterâ€”enough to cover them; cover, and boil until tender. When cooked, drain them in a colander and season with butter, pepper, and salt. STEWED LIMA BEANS. Boil a pint of shelled beans until tender, with three slices of onion, and drain. Put into a pot a piece of dripping or butter the size of an egg. When the dripping or butter becomes hot, put into it an even tablespoonful of minced onion and fry it; then put in the beans; add hot stock or water enough to half cover the beans; stock is preferable. Cover closely and simmer fifteen minutes. Just before dishing them, stir in a handful of minced parsley. Do not allow the parsley to boil, as boiling spoils its color. LIMA BEANS (DRIED). Soak one pint of beans in water over night. In the morning drain off the water and cover with fresh warm water. Two hours before dinner drain again, cover them with boiling soft water and drain again after boiling them thirty minutes. Cover them once more with boiling water and boil until tender. Add a teaspoonful of salt after they have been boiling an hour. When done drain and dredge with a table- spoonful of flour. Salt and pepper to taste. BOILED GREENS. Spinach, young beets, turnip tops, mustard, nettle, narrow dock, lambs' quarters, dandelion, mountain cowslip, kale, cabbage, poke, sprouts, etc.

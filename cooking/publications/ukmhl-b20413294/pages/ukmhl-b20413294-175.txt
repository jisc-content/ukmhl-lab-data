169 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. PIE CRUST, No. 2. In preparing paste, the cook should place his hands under a tap for a few minutes, so that they may be quite cold before touching the ingredients. Chop up the suet very fine, if to be used, and roll it; place sufficient salt, flour, and baking powder in a dish; well mix the whole; add some water, mix lightly until it forms a smooth paste; sprinkle some flour on the table, roll out the paste one-half inch thick, shake some flour over it; take one-third of the dripping or suet and distribute it over the paste, fold the paste over, sprinkle some more flour over the table, roll out the paste, fold and roll again, and repeat this once more; then add one-third of the dripping or suet as before, fold and roll three times; then add the remainder of the dripping or suet, fold and roll again three times; it will then have been rolled and folded nine times; it should then be left in a cool place for ten minutes, rolled out, and the pie covered. PIE CRUST, No. 3. Chop up the suet very fine and roll it, place the flour, suet or dripping, baking powder, and salt in a dish; well mix the whole together and work it into a smooth paste with cold water; roll it out and it is ready for use. When preparing this paste, the dripping must not be rubbed into the flour, but chopped first. REMARKS ON PUDDINGS. Puddings are variously compounded, but are always either boiled or baked. When boiled a cloth or bag well floured inside should be used to envelop them. It must be dipped into boiling water and then wrung out before the flour is applied.

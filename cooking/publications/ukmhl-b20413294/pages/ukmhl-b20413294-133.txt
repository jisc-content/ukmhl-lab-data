127 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. BOILED PUMPKIN OR WINTER SQUASH. Wash, pare, and cut the pumpkin or squash into pieces and remove the seeds. Soak it in cold water for two hours, then put it into a pot of boiling salt water; cover, and boil until tender throughout. When cooked drain thoroughly and mash it through a colander; season with butter, pepper, and salt. If the pumpkin or squash is too hard to be easily pared, it may be first parboiled. BAKED WINTER SQUASH. Small Hubbard squash is best. Saw the squash in halves; scrape out soft part and seeds; put the halves in oven and bake three-fourths of an hour, or until tender; serve in shell, helping from them. BAKED PUMPKIN OR WINTER SQUASH. Cut the pumpkin or squash into slices and remove the seeds. Put it into a broad, shallow baking pan, with a very little water; put it in the oven and bake with a gentle heat. It requires a long time to bake, and should be done dry. When baked, season with butter, pepper, and salt. The slices may be pared and put into the baking pan in layers. BAKED PUMPKIN. Cut the pumpkin in halves, then quarters; remove the seeds, but not rind; place in baking pan with the rind down, and bake in a slow oven until tender when pierced with a fork. When done serve in rind, helping it by spoonfuls, as you would mashed potatoes. BOILED SUMMER SQUASH, OR CYMLING. Wash the squash, or cymling, and if the rind is tender enough to be easily pierced with the finger nail, cut it up without paring, removing the seeds.

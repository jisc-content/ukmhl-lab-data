226 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. for the purpose. Two men with a spade and a long- handled shovel can build it, in light soil, in three- quarters of an hour. If such tools are not available, it may be constructed with trowel bayonet, intrench- ing tools, or even with knives. To build the oven, dig down the bank to a vertical face and excavate at the base a hole from 4 to 5 feet horizontally, care being taken to keep the entrance as small as possi- ble ; hollow out the sides of the excavation and arch the roof until the floor is about 2 feet 6 inches in its widest part and the roof 16 inches high in the cen- ter of the arch. Then tap the back end for the flue. A hole from 4 to 6 inches in diameter will furnish a good draft. A piece of tent stovepipe may be util- ized for this purpose. It will be advantageous, before using, to wet the whole interior surface of the oven and smooth it over neatly, drying it out and hardening it with a small fire. The time required for drying out will depend upon the cnaracter of the soil; if ordinarily dry, a fire kept up for an hour will suffice. Such an oven has a capacity of about 40 rations, and will bake good bread in about 50 minutes. With proper care it will last several weeks, Bake- pans may be used in baking, if they can be obtained; if not, the bare floor, after the ashes are removed, may be used to bake on. After the introduction of the dough, the flue and door should be closed, which may be done with logs of wood, pieces of hard-bread boxes plastered with mud, flat stones, a wet grain sack or piece of canvas. After the oven has been heated, the degree of heat may be regulated by means of the door and flueâ€”opening or closing them as may be necessary.

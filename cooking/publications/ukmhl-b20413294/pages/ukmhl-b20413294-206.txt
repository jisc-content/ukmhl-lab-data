LEMONADE, No. 1. Good lemonade is of high dietetic value. Few know how to make it properly, being too economi- cal in the use of lemons and sugar, and too generous with the water. One who enjoys a reputation for making a superior lemonade always uses boiled water. The recipe is as follows: ''For a quart, take the juice of three lemons, using the rind of one of them. Peel the rind very thin, getting just the yellow outside; cut into pieces, and put with the juice and powdered sugar, of which use two ounces to the quart, in a jug or jar with a cover. When the water is just at the tea point pour it over the lemon and sugar, cover at once, and let it get cold."

89 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. over the fire to simmer; skim carefully. When the stew has simmered for two hours put in the prepared vegetables; season with pepper and salt. Simmer one hour longer, stirring occasionally. When done serve in a hot dish. If it is desired to serve the potatoes whole, put them into the pot twenty or thirty minutes before the stew is cooked. If the water gets too low, replenish carefully with boiling- water. If the liquor of the stew is not sufficiently thick, stir into it two tablespoonfuls of blended browned flour. A bay leaf to every pound of meat may be put into the pot of cold water with the meat. Stew mutton, lamb, veal, and fresh pork as above. The bones of mutton and veal, if small, need not be removed. Add thin slices of fat pork or bacon to a veal stew. . The onions may be fried brown before they are put into the stew. Too much water is commonly used in making stews. They should be thick rather than thin. TO MAKE A BEEF PIE. Fresh beef, potatoes, onions, tomatoes, pieces of butter or beef dripping the size of a hazelnut; pepper and salt on every layer. Cut the meat into two-inch pieces, removing gristle, bone, and any superabundance of fat. Cut the potatoes into slices a quarter of an inch thick, rinse in cold water, and parboil them. Chop the onions fine. Slice the tomatoes. Roll the pieces of butter or dripping in sifted flour. Put the meat and one or two teaspoonfuls of salt into a pot of cold stock or water, just enough to cover the meat. Cover closely; remove the scum as it rises; simmer steadily until half done. Remove it from the fire. Take up the meat and strain the gravy; keep both warm. Line a baking dish or pan with a paste (see Pie Crust), first greasing the sides and bottom.

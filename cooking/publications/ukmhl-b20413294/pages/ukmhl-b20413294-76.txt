MANUAL FOK AKMY COOKS. 70 BEEF TEA. 1 pound lean beef. 2 tablespoonfuls cold water. Salt. Time, three to four hours. Cut the beef into small pieces, rejecting skin and fat. Put the meat and water into an open-mouth bottle or stone jar; close it with a cork. Set the bottle in a pot of cold water; heat it very gradually to a boil. Boil gently for three or four hours or until the meat is colorless. If it comes to a boil too quickly the glass bottle will crack. As the water evaporates replenish the pot with boiling water, taking care when it is put in not to strike the bottle. Exercise the most watchful care while cooking. If the bottle cracks remove it instantly from the pot and trans- fer the contents to a fresh bottle, first heating the bottle with hot water, and put it into the pot. When cooked strain the tea into an earthen vessel. Season with salt. Set it aside and when cold skim off any fatty particles. Serve hot or cold. If too strong for use dilute it with warm water.

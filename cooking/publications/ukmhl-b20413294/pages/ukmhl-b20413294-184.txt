Then mix in the whites of the eggs and put the pudding into the bag. For this pudding fill the bag only half full. Follow directions for boiled pudding. Cook five hours, serve hot, and eat with sauce or butter and sugar. REMARKS ON BAKED PUDDINGS. When eggs are used the whites and yolks should be beaten separately, the whites to a stiff froth. Sugar should always be mixed with the beaten yolks. The beaten whites should be the last ingredient to go into the compound unless the recipe calls for dredged fruits. Baked puddings should go into the oven the moment the mixture is made; this is essential if eggs are depended upon to lighten the dish. More time may be allowed if yeast is used. The baking dish or pan must be well greased before the pudding is put in. Lard is best for this purpose, although butter or sweet beef dripping will do. Fruit, rice, cornstarch, and bread puddings require a steady, moderate oven whilst baking. Custard and batter puddings require a hot, quick oven, and must cook rapidly. To prevent the bottom of the pudding from burning, place the baking dish on an inverted pan or a gridiron in the bottom of the oven. If the top of the pudding shows signs of burning, cover it with a sheet of writing paper or an inverted tin plate. Remove the covering in time to allow the top to brown before serving. Jarring the oven by opening its doors or walking about the kitchen floor should be avoided while the pudding is in the oven.

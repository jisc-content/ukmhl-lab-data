MANUAL FOK ARMY COOKS. 126 pepper, salt, and mace, or grated nutmeg. Cover; stew gently for fifteen minutes, stirring frequently. FRIED PARSNIPS. Boil the parsnips until tender; scrape off the skin and cut them lengthwise into slices one-quarter inch thick. Dip each slice into beaten egg or flour. Put into a frying pan enough lard or beef dripping so that when melted it will just cover the bottom of the pan. When this becomes hot put in the parsnips and fry brown on both sides. When cooked take them up, drain off the grease, season with pepper, and serve. They may be fried without the egg or flour. PARSNIP CAKES. Scrape, wash, boil, and mash the parsnips. When cold, season with salt and pepper and, flouring your hands, form into cakes; roll in flour and fry in boil- ing dripping; drain dry and serve in a hot dish. BOILED GREEN PEAS. Time, fifteen to twenty-five minutes. The pot in which peas are to be cooked must be clean and free from odor. Shell the peas and soak them in cold water (ice water is preferable) for ten or fifteen minutes, drain, and put them into a pot of boiling salt water; cover; boil until tender. When cooked, drain dry; season with butter, pepper, and salt. If the peas are old and tough, there may be put into the pot with them a small quantity of bicarbonate of soda. It will make the peas tender and freshen their color. A sprig of mint may be boiled with the peas. It should be removed when the peas are drained. If peas are not really in season it is more satis- factory to use canned peas, and French peas are the best,

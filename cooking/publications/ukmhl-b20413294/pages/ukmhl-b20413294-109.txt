103 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. DRY HASH. From cold cooked fresh or corned beet, veal, or mutton. These meats may be used singly or together. Four pounds of meat, free from bone and gristle: one large onion, parboiled: two pounds of cooked potato: the meat, potato, and onion minced. Mix all together: season with pepper and salt. Stir into the mixture about a pint or enough hot stock, gravy, beef dripping*, or water to well moisten it: stock is preferable. Mix well: put into a frying- pan enough lard or beef dripping so that when melted it will cover the bottom of the pan: when this is hot put in the hash; stir it for a few minutes, then let it fry until it becomes brown on the lower side: turn it out, without breaking, into a hot dish, and serve: or, after the hash has been stirred in the pan, empty it into a greased baking pan, smooth the top of the hash, and bake until it is browned on top: serve in the baking pan. If the hash is to be made of corned beef alone, very little, if any, salt for seasoning will be needed. Instead of parboiling the onion, it may be minced and fried to a light brown. PEMMICAN.

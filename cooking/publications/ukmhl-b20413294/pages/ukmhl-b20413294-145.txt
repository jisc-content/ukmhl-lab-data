MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 139 BAKED MUSHROOMS. Prepare the mushrooms as directed for stewing. Put them into a greased tin or earthen baking dish, gills uppermost. Put a piece of butter, beef drip- ping, or lard, preferably butter, around the stems, and season with pepper and salt. Put the dish into the oven and bake in a uniform heat. Exercise care that they do not burn. Bake from twelve to fifteen minutes, basting frequently. Serve in the baking dish. FRIED MUSHROOMS. Prepare the mushrooms as directed for stewing. Heat in a frying pan enough dripping or butter to thinly cover the bottom; put in the mushrooms and fry both sides a golden brown. When cooked, put them into a hot dish and keep warm, and make a gravy as follows: Heat in the frying pan about half a cupful of stock or gravy, then stir in one or two tablespoonfuls of blended browned flour; keep stirring until it comes to a boil; season with pepper, salt, and pour it over the mushrooms. STEWED MUSHROOMS. Select mushrooms of uniform size. Wipe them clean with a soft cloth; peel, commencing at the edge and finishing at the top; cut off the lower part of the stem; put them into a tin or earthen vessel and half cover them with cold water, and stew gently for fifteen minutes, frequently stirring to prevent burning. Season with pepper and salt. When the stew is done stir into it one or more tablespoonfuls of dripping or butter, previously cut into small pieces, and rolled in flour; stir three or four min- utes. Do not let it boil.

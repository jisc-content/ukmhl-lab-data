9281 2 (17) MANUAL FOE ARMY COOKS. METHODS OF COOKING. The ordinary methods of cooking are as follows: Roasting, Baking, Boiling, Simmering, Stewing, Broiling, Frying, and Sauteing. Roasting is that process by which a substance is cooked by the direct heat of a fire, without inter- position of utensils, and generally in the open air. This method is seldom used at present, baking being substituted for it. HINTS ON ROASTING MEAT. Ill roasting beef allow to fifty pounds, four hours, if pieces are cut in chunks of about seven to ten pounds each; remove bones from large roasts; dredge both sides with flour, salt, and pepper; on each piece place a piece of fat suet, bacon, or pork. Pour over hot meat broth or water (boiling is best) to moisten and set the juices, and basting is not required. Turn the meat and when about half done add onions and broth to make enough gravy, and an hour before it is done put in the pared potatoes with the meat and gravy to bake brown. Keep oven closed until ready to serve. To roast mutton it requires to the fifty pounds, three hours. To roast veal it requires to the fifty pounds, four and one-half to five hours. To roast pork it requires to the fifty pounds, four and one-half to five hours. Allow meat broth sufficient to make gravy for the command. Season to taste, remembering that to season correctly is one-half of good cooking.

MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 59 placed in a net, with a tally attached, before being boiled; the bones of the second and third days should be similarly treated; after the third day the bones boiled upon the first day should be removed, and similarly the bones of the subsequent days, the stock being continually replenished from day to day. The bones should always be removed from the stock before the vegetables and other ingredients are added. They should be carefully drained, placed in a dish, and kept in a cool dry place until required the following morning. This process adds enor- mously to the strength of the soup made. The amount of water to be added to the boiler in making stock must depend on the quantity and the quality of the bones. STOCK SOUP (BOUILLON). {See remarks on soup.) 4 pounds fresh lean beef. 1 gallon cold water. 1 sonp bone. 2 onions, sliced. Pepper and salt. Time, seven and one-half to eight hours. Put the meat and bone into a pot with the cold water and a tablespoonful of salt. One hour before the stock is cooked, put in the sliced onion. Pepper, and, if necessary, salt, a few minutes before strain- ing. When cooked, strain while hot through a colander into the vessel in which it is to be kept, preferably an earthen jar, put*it away in a cool place to stand over night. In the morning the stock will be a jelly, with a layer of fat on top. Take off this fat and use it as drippings for cooking purposes. As stock will not keep longer than twenty-four hours in the summer, it is recommended that none be made in warm weather, but in the winter months it could be made twice a week. Scraps of cooked meat and bones may be economically utilized in the manufacture of stock.

23 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. often happens tliat failures in cooking occur from lack of attention to these printed recipes, and by misapprehension as to the strength and character of the substances used. TO CLEAN UTENSILS. New utensils should be cleaned before they are used. A new iron pot should have a handful* of sweet hay or grass boiled in it, then be scrubbed with sand and soap; afterwards clean water should be boiled in it for about half an hour. A new tin should be filled with boiling water in which has been dissolved a spoonful of soda, and placed over the fire to simmer. Afterwards it should be scoured with soap and rinsed with hot water. The soda renders soluble the resin used in soldering. Tins can be kept clean by rubbing them gently with sifted wood ashes. After being thoroughly washed in very hot soap- suds and wiped dry, tin vessels should be set on the top of the stove for a few moments and then vigor- ously scoured for a few minutes, with dry flour rubbed on with a wad of newspaper crumpled and softened. In this way tinware may be kept free from rust and almost as bright and glistening as silver, care being taken that it is never put away damp and that it is kept in a dry place. A coffee or spice mill can be cleansed by grinding a handful of raw rice in it. The particles of spice, pepper, or coffee will not adhere after the rice is ground through the mill. A copper stew pan or vessel can be cleaned with fine sand and salt, half the quantity of salt to that of sand; rub it thoroughly with the hand or a brush. If there are many stains, an old lemon (or vinegar) may be used to remove them.

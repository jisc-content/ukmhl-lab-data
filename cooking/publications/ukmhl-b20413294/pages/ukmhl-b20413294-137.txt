MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 131 ice water for one hour. Wipe each slice dry with a soft cloth, sprinkle with pepper and salt, and dredge them with flour. Put into a frying pan enough butter, beef dripping, or lard so that when melted it will just cover the bottom of the pan. When this becomes hot, put in the cucumbers and fry both sides a light brown. BOILED GREEN CORN. Time, thirty to forty minutes. Corn for boiling should be full grown, but young and tender. Sugar corn is the most desirable. When the grains become hard it is too old for boil- ing. Test by piercing the grain, when the milk should escape in a jet. Clean by stripping off the outer layer of shucks, turn back the inner shucks, pick off the silk, bring back the inner shucks over the grains, tie the ends. This process preserves the sweetness of the corn. Put the corn into a pot of boiling salt waterâ€” enough to cover it. Cover and boil long enough to cook. Any exposure to heat after this is accom- plished injures the corn. When cooked, cut off the stalk close to the cob and remove the shucks. Cold boiled corn may be cut from the cob and fried, or fried mixed with mashed potato. Green corn may be cooked in the shuck in hot ashes. Time, about one hour. STEWED GREEN CORN. Cut the corn from the cob by passing a sharp knife lengthwise through the center of each row of grains; then with the back and pointed end of the knife scrape the grains free from the hull. Put it into a pot, barely covering it with cold milk; season with butter and salt, and, if common .field corn, sugar. Cover and stew gently until very tender.

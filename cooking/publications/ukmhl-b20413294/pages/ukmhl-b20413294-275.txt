269 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. them with ease. Serve thus, or peel while hot; mash into a paste, season with pepper and salt, and eat hot. STEWED POTATOES. Peel and cut into thick slices, stew in stewpan, with enough water to cover them, and add two thin slices of bacon; put on the lid and cook until potatoes are soft and nearly dry, but stir frequently to prevent burning or sticking to the bottom of pan. Add salt and pepper. A raw onion or two cut into the stewing potatoes gives a flavor that a hungry soldier always enjoys. BAKED BEANS, No. 1. Soak the beans over night, if possible, and boil with a piece of pork or bacon about two hours, or until a bean will mash easily between the fingers; then strain them into a pan (pots are the best) and cover them with the liquid boiled in; season well, adding a cupful of molasses or sugar. If pork is salty, more salt will not be required. Draw a knife blade crosswise through the rind of three or four pieces of bacon or pork; bury them in the beans and bake slowly two to three hours or more. Brown the top before serving, but do not let the bottom get dry. Add more liquid as it becomes dry, and do not have too great a heat on bottom; stir from bottom if necessary. Some add vinegar, molasses, and mustard; a small quantity mixed with the beans increases the flavor. If water is hard, a small quantity of saleratus when the beans are boiling will soften it. BAKED BEANS, No. 2, Boil the beans for a long time over a brisk fire, until they are perfectly soft, and settle at the bot- tom of the stewpan. Pour off the water, and let them dry in the stewpan by placing it on hot ashes

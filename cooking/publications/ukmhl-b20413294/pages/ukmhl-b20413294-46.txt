MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 40 post where all the companies are joined in a general mess, the post commander should see that the in- struction above mentioned is given. At such a post a company commander confines his supervision of the mess of his company to observation and to noti- fying the officer in charge, in writing, of anything requiring remedy. Should this officer fail to apply proper remedy, report may then be made to the post commander. A department commander should see that each company of his command has the necessary field practice each year. Kitchens will be better conducted if they are placed under the immediate charge of non-commis- sioned officers, who should be held responsible for their condition and for the proper use of rations. No one should be allowed to visit or remain in the kitchen except those who go there on duty or are employed therein. The greatest care should be observed in cleaning and scouring cooking utensils. Special regulations for soldiers' fare cannot be made to suit each locality and circumstance. Per- sonal care and judgment on the part of company officers are relied on to prevent waste or misuse. By due economy, some part of the ration can be saved and sold, and the proceeds applied to provide additional articles of diet. The food of prisoners is usually sent to their places of confinement, but post commanders may arrange to send prisoners, under proper guard, to their messes. Such proportions of company allowances of fuel, illuminating supplies, brooms, and scrubbing brushes as may be necessary for the service of a general mess should be allotted by the post commander. In the field the mess furniture of soldiers is limited to the smallest possible quantity, usually to one tin cup, knife, fork, and spoon, and such device for individual cooking as may be furnished by the Ordnance Department.

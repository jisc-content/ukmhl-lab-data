173 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. BOILED YEAST DUMPLING. Make a light dough, or procure from the bakery dough which is ready for the oven. Flour the hands well and mold the dough into balls about the size of an egg. Drop them succes- sively into boiling water. Boil fifteen minutes. Remove them from the pot with perforated skim- mer, to allow the water to drain. Serve at once. Eat with hot sauce or sugar and butter. PLUM PUDDING, No. 1. The ingredients of this pudding, with the excep- tion of the eggs and milk, should be prepared the day before the pudding is to be made. Two quarts sifted flour; two quarts bread crumbs; four pounds suet, freed from fiber and chopped moderately fine; four pounds raisins, picked, seeded, chopped, and dredged with flour; sixteen eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately; two quarts sweet milk (or equivalent of condensed milk); a fourth of a pound of citron, cut fine and dredged with flour; grated rind of one lemon; two nutmegs, grated; one tablespoonful ground ginger; one table- spoonful ground cinnamon; one teaspoonful ground cloves. Into a deep pan or dish put the ingredients in the following order, incorporating them thoroughly: First, the beaten yolks of the eggs; then one-half the milk; then the flour, bread crumbs, suet, spices, and lemon rind ; then the remainder of the milk, or as much of it as will make a thick batter; then the beaten whites of the eggs; and last the dredged fruit. Beat the mixture for thirty minutes, put it into the prepared bag or bags, and boil seven hours. Serve hot with sauce. The above recipe is enough for thirty men.

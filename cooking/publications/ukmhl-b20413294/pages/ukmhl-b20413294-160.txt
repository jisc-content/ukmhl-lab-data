MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 154 STEWED CRANBERRIES. Pick the berries carefully; then wash them in cold water; drain. Put them into fresh cold water and soak for five or ten minutes; drain, and then put the fruit into a well-covered vessel (not iron), with sufficient boiling water to cover it. Stew rather quickly, stirring occasionally until soft. They should cook in from twenty to thirty minutes. Five minutes before they are done stir in sugar to taste. Then pass them through a colander to remove the skins, if so desired. Remove from fire, put into a cold dish, and set them away to cool. When cold they are ready for use; can be used as soon as cooked. STEWED RHUBARB. Wash the rhubarb and cut it into pieces one inch long. Do not peel it. Allow one pound of sugar to each pound of rhubarb. Put rhubarb into sauce- pan, cover it with sugar, and put on back part of fire until sugar melts. Then bring it to boiling I >oint without stirring. Turn it all out to cool and it is ready for use. EGGS. Eggs are best twelve hours after they have been laid. They are good when translucent or will sink in water. They should be kept in a dry, dark, cool place. They maybe kept for months by packing them (without touching one another) in salt, the small end down. When eggs are cooked in a frying pan the pan must be particularly clean. When butter, beef dripping, or lard is put into the pan over the fire, i1 should be tossed about gently to melt it evenly, and to prevent it blackening. As soon as melted the eggs should be turned into it.

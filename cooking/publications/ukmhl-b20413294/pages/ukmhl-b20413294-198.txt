MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 192 should be used, or it can be mixed with -sufficient Mocha, Rio, or other strong coffee well ground together. To insure the best results both in strength and flavor coffee should be ground fine. Tea.â€”The kinds of tea found to be most popular in the Army are Oolong and Souchong among the black teas, and of strictly green teas Hyson and Young Hyson are preferable to Gunpowder and Imperial, being generally cheaper for the same quality. Souchong is commonly known as English Break- fast Tea, although Congou is frequently sold under the same name. The leaves are dark brown, almost black. Great care is needed in selecting it, as a poor ''English Breakfast" is a very poor tea. Oolong tea is coarse in the dried leaf, loosely wrapped, and of a dark brown color verging toward olive. The fragrance reminds one of new hay, but is stronger and spicier. It is generally the best tea, being stronger than "English Breakfast" and less stimulating than green tea. Japan green tea is an excellent tea, and being generally of a natural color is less injurious than Hyson, Imperial, or Gunpowder, which are artifi- cially colored. TO ROAST COFFEE. Pick over the coffee carefully; wash it in clean, cold water; wash thoroughly and quickly; drain, and when dry put it into a coffee roaster or baking pan; roast quickly to a light brown, stirring fre- quently. Coffee may be vastly improved before roasting by adding to every three pounds of coffee a piece of butter the size of a nut, and a dessert-spoonful of powdered sugar, and then roasting in the usual manner. Coffee should be evenly roasted; a few burned berries will impart a disagreeable flavor to the coffee when made.

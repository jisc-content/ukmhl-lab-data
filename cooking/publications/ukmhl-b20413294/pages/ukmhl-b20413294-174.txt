MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 168 mix into it the salt; then the lard.' With a keen chopping knife cut up the lard into the flour until it is thoroughly incorporated, with no lumps; wet with ice water, stirring it in with a wooden spoon until it becomes a stiff dough. Flour the hands, and make dough into a lump with as little handling as possible. Remove lump to a well-floured kneading board, and roll it out into a sheet one-quarter of an inch thick, always rolling from you, and with as little pressure upon the rolling-pin as may be necessary. Into the rolled sheet stick small pieces of butter at regular intervals. Dredge slightly with flour. Roll up the sheet, commencing on the edge nearest you. Roll out, again buttering and dredging, until the butter is exhausted. If time will then permit, lay the roll in a cold place or on the ice for twenty minutes. Place it again upon the floured kneading board, roll out into a sheet as before directed. Butter the pie plates; lay the paste lightly in them, fitting it nicely. Trim off the paste neatly around the edges of the pie plates. Gather up the cuttings and roll them into a separate sheet. If the pies are to have a top crust, cover the tops with the paste, cutting neatly round the edges, and with a knife, spoon, or the fingers join securely the edges of the top and sides to prevent escape of juices. Then, with a sharp knife, make three or four incis- ions about an inch long to the center of the top crust. If the top crust is lightly brushed with sweet milk it will brown evenly. Bake in a moderate oven to a light brown. Be careful to have the heat as great at the bottom as at the top of oven. If this is not looked to the lower crust will be uncooked. Should a richer crust be desired the proportions of lard and butter can be increased.

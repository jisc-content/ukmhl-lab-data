MANUAL vtfOR ARMY COOKS. 21 In broiling, the article should be turned frequent- ly, so as to have it cooked evenly. Frying is practically boiling in fat, and is con- sidered the least wholesome of all kinds of cooking. Fat (lard, etc.) raised to 400° Fahr. is sufficiently hot for frying purposes. A substance fried at this temperature can not absorb fat, since the moment it is dropped into the fat the great heat closes its pores. If, however, the fat is not hot enough, or if it is chilled by dropping too much in it at a time, the substance will absorb it, and be injured in lightness and flavor. When cooked, food should be taken from the lard or fat and allowed to drain a few moments in a sieve or colander. To test hot fat.—If little jets of smoke issue from the top of it, the fat is hot enough for frying. FRYING MEATS, VEGETABLES, ETC. There are two methods of frying: One with very little fat in the pan, the other with enough to boil. Chops or fat meats are best prepared by putting them in the pan when it is very hot, with just enough fat to pfevent them from sticking when first put in. They should be cooked quickly and turned frequently by use of a turnover. Forks should never be used in turning or trying meats, as each stab means a loss of the juices. They should not be salted when cooking, as salt releases the juices. They should be seasoned before serving and served hot and quickly. Meats prepared in the foregoing manner are equal to broiled. If the other method is followed, a deeper vessel and plenty of fat should be used; the fat heated until it bubbles and boils, and then the meats, chips (potatoes), doughnuts, or whatever the article is, dropped in and cooked until brown and well done. Meats should first be rolled in dry crumbs, cracker dust, corn meal, or flour.

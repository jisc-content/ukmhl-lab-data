224 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. of water, placed in the kettles and steamed over a hot fire for 10 hours, when again measured was found to be still 10 gallons. The water in the bot- tom of the steamer being directly in contact with the raw heat the gases will naturally be consumed, and so of course will have to be replenished after 3 or 4 hours. For boiling rice, hominy, oatmeal, etc., just enough water is added to allow their kernels or sub- stance to swell. The stove is operated by first putting the legs or supports together and fastening them to the stove by placing them in the sockets prepared to receive them; if convenient there should be a small hole or ditch dug for the fire (although this is not neces- sary). The stove is then placed over the place thus prepared and a fire kindled, using wood broken or cut three feet or less in length, or any material that will make a good fire. The cooking should be done in a sheltered place, if possible, although this is not entirely necessary, as the cooking can be done on the open plain in any weather. The advantage of a sheltered, place is that it will prevent sand and dirt from getting into the food. In using the cooker, when the food is I>repared and in the cooker place, close the same, and cook as in the kitchen. Any water, muddy or salt, can be used in the bottom for the purpose of making steam, only using fresh water for cooking the food. In cooking in summer, when the food is done the fire may be allowed to go out, and if the cooker is kept closed the food will keep warm for two hours, and by this means picket guards and scouting parties coming in late can always have warm food, and while left in the cooker the food will never get dry. In cold weather there should be a small fire kept under the stove. The steamer should never be opened until it is time for the food to be done, giving plenty of time.

BOILED CAULIFLOWER. Time, fifteen to twenty minutes. Trim the cauliflower by removing the outside leaves and cutting off the stalk. Put it into cold water for half an hour; then into a pot of boiling salted water—enough to cover it, and boil until ten- der. Be careful to take it up as soon as tender, and drain. A drawn-butter sauce may be poured over it, or a sauce made as directed for stewed onions. One cupful of grated cheese to a pint of sauce may be melted into the sauce. BOILED CARROTS. Time, thirty minutes to one and one-half hours. Trim off the roots, wash well, and scrape off the skin. If they are young do not remove the skin until they are cooked. If the carrots are large, split or quarter them lengthwise, or cut them across in two or more pieces. Soak them in cold water for thirty minutes; put them into a pot of boiling salt water—enough to plentifully cover them. Boil steadily until tender. When cooked, drain or dry them in a cloth, and season with butter, pepper, and salt. Tomato catsup may be added as a seasoning. If they are boiled with meat, butter may be omitted. STEWED CARROTS. Boil the carrots, cut into thin slices, and keep them warm. For about a quart of carrots, put into a pot a pint of stock or liquor from boiled^ fresh beef or mutton; put it on the fire, add a piece of dripping or butter twice the size of an egg, season 9281 9

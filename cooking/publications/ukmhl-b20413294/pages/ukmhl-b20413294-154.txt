148 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. Before frying, each, slice may be dipped into beaten egg (salted), then into bread or cracker crumbs. The best way to make mush for frying is to pnt two quarts of water on the fire to boil. Stir into a qnart of cold milk or water one pint of corn meal and two teaspoonfuls of salt. When the water boils pour in the mixture gradually, stirring it well in. Let it boil half an hour, stirring continu- ously to prevent scorching. Set aside to cool, and when cold cut into slices three-quarters of an inch thick and fry; or the slices may be dipped in egg and crumbs as above. OATMEAL MUSH. Oatmeal mush is prepared as Indian-meal mush, with the exception that the meal must be sprinkled dry into the hot water. BOILED MACARONI. Wipe the macaroni carefully, and break it into convenient lengths; put it into a pot of boiling salt water, say ten times as much water as macaroni. Boil fifteen to twenty minutes, or until tender. Take care that it does not burst or become a pulp from excessive boiling; drain at once and season with butter or dripping. If a flavor of onion is desired, boil with it two onions for each pound of macaroni. The liquor drained from the macaroni may be used for broth or soup. Or, as soon as the butter and flour bubbles, grad- ually pour in one quart of boiling water, stirring it until it becomes smooth; season with pepper and salt; put in the macaroni and let it remain over the fire for one minute. Have ready one or two onions, minced or shredded, fried brown. Dish the maca- roni and pour the fried onions over it.

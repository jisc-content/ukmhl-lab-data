An excel- lent recipe is the following: Corn meal, two quarts; salt, two teaspoonfuls; mix rapidly with boiling water, and stir till it drops lightly from the spoon. This may be baked in an ordinary Dutch oven, or, in thin cakes, in a frying pan. Eaten either warm or cold. CORN BREAD OR HOECAKE. 1 quart meal. 2 teaspoonf uls salt. 2 tablespoonfuls melted lard. Sufficient warm water (but not hot enough to scald meal) or warm milk to make a thick batter. Put meal in a deep dish; mix in the salt; pour in sufficient warm water or milk to make a thick bat- ter ; last add the melted lard, beat thoroughly, and bake in a well-greased pan in a quick oven. By the addition of more warm water or milk the batter can be thinned down and a griddle cake made from above recipe. WHEAT BREAD. Should wheat bread be desirable it is better to use the patent self-raising flour; this only requires to be gradually mixed into a thin batter with cold water, and may be baked in a Dutch oven, or, into biscuits or hot cakes, in a frying pan. It makes most delicious bread and biscuits. The addition for self-raising flour is baking pow- der and salt, in proper proportions, which makes it cost about 1\ to 2 cents more per pound than the straight flour. Remember, always, that to bake in an oven (or Dutch oven) you must have the heat on top of as well as under the oven. 9281 11

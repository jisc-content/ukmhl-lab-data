MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 270 CANNED OYSTER SAUTE. Drain oysters dry, sprinkle with pepper and roll in flour. Cut one-fourth pound bacon into thin slices, put in frying pan and try out all the fat. Remove bacon and cover bottom of pan with oysters. When brown and crisp on one side, do other side the same. Serve on squares of toast. TO ROAST (PARCH) COFFEE. Coffee requires great care and constant attention in roasting—don't leave it to do something else. Half fill the pan with coffee beans, about fifteen pounds, place it in the oven or on the fire (an even and slow heat is best) and when it gets heated through stir thoroughly from the bottom. Try to stir it so the under berries will come to the top, and vice versa. If fire is quick keep stirring constantly. Use the turnover in stirring, not a spoon. When about half done add half pint of fat or water and stir thoroughly until of a rich brown color, then set off to cool. Some prefer to use the oven and by having heat on top can observe the progress of parching more easily and thoroughly, acting accordingly. Time, about one hour or more to the half-pan full. Great care should be exercised, as good coffee is the backbone of many a meal. TO MAKE COFFEE. Into a small coffee boiler, the smallest one, put sufficient cold water for the command, allowing a good quart per man or more; add to it the coffee, ground fine (two quarts ground coffee to fifty men at least), and when the whole boils remove it from the fire, ten minutes before service, to settle. Another way: First boil the water, then add the coffee: boil ten minutes and remove; boil slowly or it will boil over—a cupful of cold water will pre- vent it from boiling over when it is boiling too fast,

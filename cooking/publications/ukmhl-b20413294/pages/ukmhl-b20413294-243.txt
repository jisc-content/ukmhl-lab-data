237 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. This depth of earth is named for the reason that a larger quantity would be liable, from its weight, to bend the iron when heated, and a smaller quantity would allow too much heat to escape. An excavation 3 or 4 feet in depth should be made a foot or two from the door, for the convenience of the baker. Two hours are required for heating the oven at first starting, but for each heating immediately fol- lowing one hour will be sufficient. A small quantity of wood is placed in the oven at the extreme rear and ignited, the door being kept open to afford a draft and a vent for the smoke. Small quantities of wood should then be added as combustion progresses. In this way the fuel will burn more freely, and the oven be heated quicker, than if all the fuel necessary for the heating were put in at once. As soon as the oven is at a white heat the ashes should be raked out, the floor swept clean, and the dough in pans introduced. The door should then be closed, and all interstices filled with moistened clay or earth. Bake pans may be dispensed with if the floor is made of bricks. If bread pans are used they should be of such size that four of them, or at most six, will cover the whole available space of the oven floor. The time required for each baking is about 45 minutes. As each of the two principal pieces forming an oven weighs only about 85 pounds, the whole—con- sisting of the two sides, the door, and end plate— can be easily transported, and can even be carried on a pack animal if necessary. To set up the oven no tools except a pickax and a shovel are required, the sides being merely placed on level ground, attached together, the rear end closed, and the whole covered with earth. It can be erected and prepared for use in 15 minutes, and if kept in constant operation for 24 hours can bake

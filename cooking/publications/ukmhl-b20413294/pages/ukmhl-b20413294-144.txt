138 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. and, as the size increases, the under part gradually opens and shows a f ringy fur (called gills) of a deli- cate salmon color. After the mushroom is a day old this salmon color changes to a russet or dark brown. They have an agreeable odor, the flesh com- pact and brittle, and the skin is more easily peeled from the edges than in the poisonous kinds. The seeds or spores are white and for the most part roundish or oval. An edible mushroom should not have only one of the above characteristics, but should combine them all. POISONOUS MUSHROOMS. Poisonous mushrooms are found in woods, low, damp ground, in shady places, and upon putrefying substances. Some species emit an agreeable, others a fetid, odor. The color of the gills in some is either red, green, blue, yellow, or orange-red. In others the top, gills, and stalks are dead white. In all poisonous mushrooms there is the absence of the delicate salmon color found in the edible species. The flesh in some is soft and watery, in others it has an acid or a bitter taste. Some on being bruised assume a bluish tint or exude an acrid milky juice. The seeds or spores are generally angular. The above rules for determining the edible and the poisonous mushrooms are a safe guide provided the mushrooms are quite fresh; but if they have been gathered for several hours they may have so changed in color that it might be impossible to form a cor- rect opinion of them. Furthermore, if a person does not know the difference between a yellow and a salmon color, the result of his judgment might be disastrous. Finally, if a white peeled onion is cooked with mushrooms and turns black, or if a silver spoon used for stirring them while cooking turns black, it- is safest not to eat them. Whenever there is the least doubt of their quality, do not use them.

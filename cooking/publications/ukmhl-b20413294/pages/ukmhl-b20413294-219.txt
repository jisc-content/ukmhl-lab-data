213 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 2 feet in depth, generally in the slope of a hill. On one side run a shaft laterally, about 1 foot square and 6 feet in length, and 1 foot from the surface of the ground. At the extreme end sink a shaft ver- tically, and form a chimney; and at equidistances pierce three holes of sufficient diameter to prevent the kettles from slipping through. By this mode kettles can be placed over the fire to boil—or on either side, to simmer—with less difficulty than by any other means. (See plate 3.)

152 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. The three measures of water prescribed will usually be about the proper proportion. The shape of the utensil and the amount of evaporation allowed during the process of cooking are to be considered; the aim should be to have the porridge somewhat thinâ€”it should certainly not be hard and thick. The flavor is better when moderately thin. For oatmeal gruel use five measures of water. DRIED AND EVAPORATED FRUITS. Dried fruits are an excellent food when properly prepared for the table, but unfortunately they are usually cooked imperfectly, and cook-books give scant information concerning them; in fact, the majority of cook-books do not mention them. The following recipes for cooking dried prunes, apples, peaches, and apricots contain directions which may be applied with slight variations for cooking all kinds of dried fruits. STEWED PRUNES. Wash and pick over the prunes, rejecting imper- fect ones; put them to soak over night in the water (cold) they are to be cooked in, using only enough water to cover them. Put the prunes on the fire where they can just simmer during three hours (prunes require longer cooking than other dried fruits because of their thick skin). Do not let them boil, nor use a vessel of iron. Keep them closely covered. If carefully cooked they present a plump appearance and are not broken or burst (this defect gives them a slovenly look, the reverse of appetiz- ing). As the prune contains much sugar, more should not be added; the fruit taste is more promi- nent without additional sugar. If, however, in- creased sweetness is desired, the sugar should not be added till about five minutes before taking off the fire.

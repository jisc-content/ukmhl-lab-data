Parboil the onions, mince them and the meat together, beat the eggs, put the minced meat and onions into a vessel; mix well with them the bread crumbs, the melted butter or dripping, the beaten eggs, the milk, and lastly, the seasoning. Put the mixture into a greased baking pan, smooth off the top, and bake it for fifteen or twenty minutes or to a light brown; serve in the baking pan. The eggs may be omitted. The onions may be minced and fried a light brown instead < >f being parboiled. WET HASH. From cold cooked fresh beef, veal, or mutton. These meats may be used singly or together. Four pounds of meat, free from bone; one large onion; two pounds of boiled potato; the meat cut into half-inch pieces; the onion parboiled and minced; the potato chopped into very small pieces; mix all together; season with pepper and salt. Put the mixture into a pot; stir into it about a quart of hot stock, gravy, beef dripping, or water; stock is preferable. Stir well together; cover; simmer for thirty minutes, or until the meat is quite tender, frequently stirring it. When the hash is done, pour it into a dish containing toasted or fried bread, and serve. If there is no stock, gravy, or beef dripping on hand, in preference to water take the bones of the cooked meats, crack them open, put them into a pot with enough cold water to cover them; put in a little salt; cover; boil steadily for half an hour; remove the scum as it rises; take up the bones and strain the gravy remaining and put it into the hash. If potatoes are not used in the hash, stir into it three or four tablespoonfuls of blended browned flour, let it boil up once, and serve. Instead of parboiling the onion, it may be minced and browned in the pot before putting in the other ingredients.

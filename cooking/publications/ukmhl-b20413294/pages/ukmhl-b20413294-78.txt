n MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. warm add the vegetables (except the potatoes) cut very small, stir them round so that they do not burn; when they are on the point of doing so add the water by degrees; peel the potatoes, put them in a net, and place them in the boiler; when done take them out and mash them; after the soup has been boiling two hours add the potatoes, with the season- ing and flour mixed, and the vinegar; boil slowly for thirty minutes, keep stirring it, and serve. FRIED BREAD FOR SOUPS. Cut stale bread into dice, and fry in boiling fat until brown. It will take about half a minute. REMARKS ON FISH. Fresh fish are best when just taken from the water. They are fresh when the eyes are clear, the fins stiff, the gills red, and hard to open. Unless fish have been frozen or have inhabited muddy s1 reams they should not be soaked. If frozen, soak them in ice-cold water to thaw. If they have in- habited muddy streams, after they have been cut up soak them in strong salt water. A fish or part of a fish of less than three pounds' weight except rockfish is too small for boiling. Exact time for boiling fish cannot be given, as much depends upon the size and kind. A piece of fresh cod weighing three pounds will cook in from eighteen to twenty minutes. Salmon should be allowed a longer time, while six or seven minutes per pound will be enough for sheepshead, rockfish, etc. Mackerel need from ten to twelve minutes; herring and many other kinds of fish scarcely half so long. As a general rule fish with white flesh require less time for boil- ing than fish with dark flesh. It requires experience to know exactly how long to boil a fish, although it is claimed that by putting salt and vinegar into the w ater six minutes to the pound is enough for all

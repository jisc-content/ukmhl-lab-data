124 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. FRIED ONIONS. Peel, slice, and fry the onions brown in butter, beef dripping, or lard; season with pepper and salt. Stir constantly or they will burn. BAKED ONIONS. Boil the onions; put them in a baking pan; place on top of each onion* pepper, salt, and a piece of butter or dripping; put into the pan a little of the water in which the onions were boiled, and bake quickly until browned; baste frequently, and serve very hot. BOILED ONIONS. Onions should be as uniform in size as possible, and should not be boiled in an iron vessel. Peel the onions and lay them in cold salt water for fifteen minutes. Put them into a pot of boil- ing salt waterâ€”enough to cover them. Cover; boil gently or they will break. They are cooked when a straw can pierce them. When cooked drain and season with butter or dripping, pepper, and salt. The strength of the onions may be reduced by boil- ing them in two or more waters. STEWED ONIONS. Boil and drain the onions. Prepare a sauce as follows: Melt a piece of butter the size of an egg; as soon as it bubbles stir in gradually two table- spoonfuls of flour; keep stirring it until it is cooked; then add about one-half pint of thin cream or milk and a seasoning of pepper and salt. Stir it until it is perfectly smooth; take it from the fire and pour it over the onions and simmer a few minutes. Young onions should be used for this dish. If the onions are strong they should be boiled in two or three waters.

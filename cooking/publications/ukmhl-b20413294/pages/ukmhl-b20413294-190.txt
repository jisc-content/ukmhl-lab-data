Put it into a broad pan. Rub into it half a pound of fresh butter and half a pound of powdered sugar, and a tablespoonful of mixed nutmeg and cinnamon. Wet it with half a pint of milk, and mix in three well-beaten eggs. Cover it and set by the fire to rise again. When quite light, flour your bread board, and make the dough into oval balls; or, it may be cut into diamond shapes (handling it as little as possible). Have ready, over the fire, a pot of boiling lard. Drop the doughnuts into it and boil them; or, fry them brown in a frying pan. Take them out one by one in a perforated skimmer, draining back the lard into the pan. Spread them on a large dish, and sift sugar over them. Eat them fresh; when heavy and stale they are not fit.

Flour your bread board, lay the dough upon it, roll it very thick, and cut it into strips with a jagging iron. Take off short pieces and twist them into various forms. Throw them into a pot of boiling lard. When'*done, drain the lard from them, spread them on a large dish, and dredge them with powdered white sugar. The alpistera is a Spanish cruller, shaped like the five fingers united at the wrist.

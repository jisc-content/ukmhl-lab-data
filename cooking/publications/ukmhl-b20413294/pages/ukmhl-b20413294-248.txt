MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 242 themselves in drinking bad water. Poisonous mat- ter of many descriptions may be taken into the stomach in it. (In Algeria, leeches have in this manner been frequently taken into the body, caus- ing dangerous internal bleeding.) Dysentery and diarrhea ensue and, in the opinion of the best army surgeons, it is one of the chief causes of those fearful diseases which have devastated armies in so many wars. It has lately been proved, that if bad water does not produce cholera, its use predisposes the body to take it when it is prevalent. TO PURIFY WATER THAT IS MUDDY, PUTRID, OR SALT. With muddy water, the remedy is to filter; with putrid, to boil, to mix with charcoal, or expose to the sun and air; or, what is best, to use all three methods at the same time. With salt water noth- ing avails but distillation. TO FILTER MUDDY WATER. When at the watering place there is nothing but wet sand, take a good handful of grass and tie it roughly together in the form of a cone, six or eight inches long; then dipping the broad end into the pud- dle and turning it up, a streamlet of partly-filtered water will trickle down through the small end. For a copious supply the most perfect plan, if you have means, is to bore a cask full of auger holes and put another small one, that has had the bottom knocked out, inside it; then fill up the space between the two with grass, moss, etc. Now, sinking the whole in the midst of the pond, the water will filter through the auger holes and moss and rise up clear of, at least, weeds and sand in the inner cask, whence it pan be ladled. With a single cask, the lower part of the sides may be bored and alternate layers of sand and grass thrown in till they reach above the holes; through these layers the water will strain.

MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 60 Stock soup is sometimes served as soon as it is made; the name Bouillon is then given it. If it is cold, and it is desired to serve it, it should be slowly heated to the boiling point, but the boiling must not continue. If it is too rich, it may be diluted with from one to two pints of boiling water to every gallon. Stock soup may be made the base of a variety of soups. It is also valuable and preferable to water for making meat gravies, stews, hash, etc. It is recommended for its simplicity and convenience. VEGETABLE SOUP (FROM STOCK). 1 gallon stock. 4 lbs. mixed vegetables (about). Salt and pepper. Prepare the vegetables as directed in Remarks on Soup, put them into a pot of boiling water slightly salted, and just enough to cover them, and boil until cooked. About ten minutes before the veg- etables are cooked, put on the stock and bring it to a boil, then stir in the cooked vegetables, and, in order that they may not stick to the bottom, keep stirring the soup until it boils up; season lightly and serve. If rice is also used with vegetables, pick and wash it, then drain and put into a separate pot with boiling water, enough to cover it, with a tea- spoonful of salt. Boil it twenty-five minutes, or until cooked; stir it and the vegetables, with the waters in which they were boiled, into the stock. TOMATO SOUP (FROM STOCK). 1 gallon stock. 6 lbs. fresh or canned tomatoes. Pepper and salt. Prepare the tomatoes as directed in Remarks on Soup. Stew the tomatoes until cooked; add a table- spoonful of salt; stir frequently to dissolve them and prevent scorching.

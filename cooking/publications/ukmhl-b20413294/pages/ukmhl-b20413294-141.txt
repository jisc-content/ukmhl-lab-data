135 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. BAKED TOMATOES, No. 1. Wash, peel, and slice the tomatoes; season them with butter, pepper, and salt, and mix thoroughly with enough bread crumbs or rolled cracker to ab- sorb the greater portion of the juice; put the mix- ture into a baking dish, and bake for three-quarters of an hour or one hour, and serve in the baking dish. Minced onion, raw or fried, maybe added to the seasoning. BAKED TOMATOES, No. 2. Cut a disk from the stem end of the tomato, take out the core and stuff it with a mixture of bread crumbs, butter, salt, and minced onion, and bake with a moderate heat for one hour. BOILED TURNIPS. Time, twenty minutes to an hour. Wash the turnips; if young, peel them, and if old, pare thickly. Slice or cut them into pieces of uni- form size. Soak in cold water for thirty minutes; put them into a pot with enough boiling salt water to cover them plentifully. Cover; boil steadily until quite tender. Drain thoroughly; season with butter, pepper, and salt. If they are boiled with meat, butter may be omitted. Young turnips may be served whole, with a drawn-butter sauce. Boiled turnips may be mashed and served like Irish potatoes. SUCCOTASH. Succotash is made with green corn and beans, the proportion being two-thirds corn to one-third beans. String beans may be used.

Cover and stew gently until tender,

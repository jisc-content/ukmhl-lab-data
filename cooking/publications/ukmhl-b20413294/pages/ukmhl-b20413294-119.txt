113 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. REMARKS ON POULTRY. Twelve or fourteen hours should elapse between the time of killing and cooking poultry; but it must be picked and drawn as soon as possible. TO SELECT POULTRY. Turkey cannot be too fat; the broader the breast and the shorter the neck the better. The skin must be uniform in appearance and white. A young turkey has a smooth leg and a short spur, eyes bright and full, and, if fresh, the feet are flexible. The absence of these signs denotes age or staleness. Chickens.—The skin of a chicken should be a clear white and easily torn, the fat. pale yellow, and the flesh white. If the rump is hard and stiff it is fresh, if soft it may be tainted. Ducks.—If the duck is young the lower part of its legs is soft, the web is also soft, and the lower mandible will not sustain the weight of the bird. This rule applies to all birds. If the breast of the duck is hard it is fresh enough. Geese.—A young goose has much down, the bill yellow, and the legs soft and of a yellow color. An old goose has little down, the skin is thick and tough, and the legs are reddish and rough. When fresh the legs are soft and the feet pliable. TO PREPARE POULTRY. Cut off the neck within an inch or two of the body, and the legs at the first joint. Make a length- wise incision under the rump large enough to easily draw the bird, which must be done carefully, exer- cising particular care not to rupture the gall blad- der ; carefully pick the bird and singe with a piece of lighted paper, or, better, over an alcohol flame. 9281 -8

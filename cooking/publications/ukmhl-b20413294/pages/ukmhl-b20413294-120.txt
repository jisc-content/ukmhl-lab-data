114 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS, BAKED TURKEY. Tame and wild turkeys are prepared and cooked alike. The time for cooking is from fifteen to twenty minutes to the pound, but this depends much upon the age of the bird; it must be well done to be palatable. Success lies in cooking it long enough, and frequent basting. Put the turkey into a pan of cold water; rinse it inside and out in three or four waters; in the last water but one dissolve a teaspoonful of bicarbon- ate of soda.

Baste frequently, at least every ten minutes. If it browns too rapidly lay a sheet of white paper over it until the lower part is done. When the turkey is browned on the breast turn it over in the pan while in the oven. Pepper, salt, and dredge the back with flour, and 1 >ake until browned, basting as above.

Â£34 THE IMPERIAL A meat (first made hot) at the bottom, cut the tongue that has been boiled into thin slices, and the root the same; lay a slice of tongue and a slice of the root round the pie, and put force-meat in the middle ; cover over the tongue, &c. with sheets of bacon; cover the pie in, and ornament it; it will take an hour or better to bake: the oven should not be very quick : when done cut the top off, pour the fat off, and put in some coulis: put a glass of Madeira in the coulis : dish it on a napkin. A TRUFFLE PIE, HOT. Raise a pie according to the size of the dish in length and in breadth, but not more than three inches deep; make a good truffle farce, and fill the pie with it; then lay in a pound of truffles that have been braised and peeled ; cover the truffles with sheets of fat bacon ; then cover the pie, and ornament it as you think proper; put it into rather a slow' oven: half an hour will bake it: when done, cut the top off.

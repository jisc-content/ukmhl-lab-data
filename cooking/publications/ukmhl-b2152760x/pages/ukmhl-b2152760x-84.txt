THE IMPERIAL AND 54 mix all together, lay it on your steaks, roll them up tight of a good size, and confine them with a small skewer; put them into a stewpan, and fry them of a nice brown ; skim off all the fat, and put in a pint of good fried gravy ; to which add one spoon- ful of catsup, two of red wine, and a few mushrooms ; let them stew half an hour, then take up the steaks, cut them in two, lay the outside uppermost, and pour the sauce over them : garnish with lemon. A RUMP OF BEEF A LA DAUBE, AND CABBAGE. Trim a rump of beef, and daube it; put it in a marinade the night before, and then put it on in a brown braise ; it will take four hours; (remember that it must do very slow): about an hour before it is wanted put in about six bundles of savoy cabbage ; the cabbage should be about half boiled in water, then squeezed very dry, and tied up in bundles ; put Spanish sauce on the dish, the cabbage round, and the beef in the middle : garnish with carrot. N. B. The beef should be glazed.

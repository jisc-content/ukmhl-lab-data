THE IMPERIAL AND 38 some very strong stock, and half the quan- tity of fat from a brown braise, a quart of sherry to about six pounds of truffles, one dozen of onions, a faggot of sweet herbs, a few blades of mace tied up in the faggot; put the stewpan on a slow stove to boil for one hour; then take them out, and divide those which you wish to send for second course, which should be the largest and roundest; peel the others, and put them in sweet-meat pots, the unpeeled the same ; skim the fat from the braise, and clarify it; boil the other part to a glaze, pour it over the truffles, and then add the fat, while quite hot; the truffles should be entirely covered. N. B. The reason for peeling the truf- fles that are wanted for entres, &c. is, that they are ready at a short notice, take up less room, and do not waste the glaze that they are preserved in ; it is very ex- cellent for giving the proper flavour to the sauce.

ROYAL COOK. 25 SOUP SANTE. Shred turnips, carrots, small onions, and Spanish onions (when to be had), cut cabbage lettuce, and a pint of asparagus peas; put all into a soup-pot, with a pint of stock ; set them an a stove to boil until the stock is quite reduced, but not catched; then fill up the pot with good stock, and put two small lumps of sugar in, and a little salt, if wanted. JELLY STOCK. Bone four or more calves’ feet, and put them into a stewpan that will hold about six quarts, (if more than four, a larger in pro- portion to the number of calves’ feet;) let them boil gently for four hours, then take out the meat part, and put it into cold water; when cold, trim it for any use it is intended ; throw the trimmings back into the stock ; let it boil until you think it is come to its proper strength: it cannot boil too long: for four feet you should add two quarts of stock. c

ROYAL COOK. 107 N. B. If the stock is not strongâ€™ enough, add a little isinglas : twelve eggs will clear two quarts of aspic. CAPILOTED FOWL. This is made from the remainder of roasted fowls which have been left; cut the fowls up in neat pieces, the same as for a fricassee ; put the trimmings into a stew- pan, with a few shalots, a faggot, a blade or two of mace, about a quarter of a pound of lean ham, and a pint of stock ; let it boil slowly for half an hour; strain it off, and put a bit of butter into a stewpan ; when melted, put as much flour as will dry up the butter, and stir it over the fire ; then put the liquor which the bones of the fowls were boiled in ; set the stewpan on the fire to boil for a few minutes, strain it through a tammy sieve, and put it to the fowls ; squeeze a little lemon-juice, put a little sugar, pepper, and salt; lay the fowl neatly on the dish, and garnish with croutons. N. B. The sauce should not boil after the fat is put to it.

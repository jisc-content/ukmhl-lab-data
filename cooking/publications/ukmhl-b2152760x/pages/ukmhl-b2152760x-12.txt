VI In the work now presented to public inspec- tion, I do not profess to give any hackneyed re- ceipts for boiling or roasting, broiling or baking, but have confined my selection chiefly to the 'higher departments of the art, such as made dishes, ragouts, fricassees, soups, gravies, &c. I have aimed, in general, to give the most es- teemed Foreign and English dishes that are now in use. An idea generally prevails, that those who have lived at an hotel, tavern, or coffee-house, must of course be thoroughly perfected in the art of cookery. 1 his is by no means the case: there are dishes made in noblemenâ€™s houses, both in town and country, which a cook of the description I have mentioned knows very little about; it is only in the first families of rank and fashion that these things are to be found. The time which is allotted to a tavern cook in the ordinary course of his business, will not be sufficient to enable him to accomplish such de- signs, even if he were capable of it. Another

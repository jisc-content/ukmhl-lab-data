180 THE IMPERIAL AND RHENISH CREAM. Bfat up the yolks of eight egg's very fine; add a quart of jelly, by a little at a time ; then strain it through a lawn-sieve ; stir it until nearly cold, and then put it into a mould : garnish with China orange. COMPOTE OF PEARS. Peel the pears, cut them down the middle, and take out the core; put about half a pound of sugar on to boil in about half a pint of water ; skim it until it is quite clear, then put a pint of port wine to it ; put the pears into a preserving-pan, and pour the sugar and w ine over them ; put in about two dozen of cloves ; cover them over with paper, and let them boil gently until tender; they will take two hours: this quantity of sugar and wine will do for twelve pears. A TRIFLE. Cut a few slices off a savoy cake, and put them at the bottom of a trifle-dish.

160 THE IMPERIAL AND CARP BAKED. Put stuffing into the carp, turn it round, and brush it over with egg; put plenty of bread crumbs over it; then drop oiled butter over the bread crumbs ; put it in a deep earthen dish, with a little stock, a few sliced onions, a few bay leaves, a little parsley, both sorts of marjoram, and a sprig or two of basil; put in half a pint of port wine, and three anchovies; put it in the oven ; it will take an hour to bake ; have the carp done a quarter of an hour before it is wanted, on account of having the liquor that it was baked in to make the sauce; put about an ounce of butter into a stewpan, and set it on the fire to melt; then put as much flour as will dry it up ; put in the liquor from the carp, give it a boil, and keep stirring it during the time it is on the fire ; when it has boiled, take it from the fire, and squeeze a lemon in ; put a little Cayenne pepper and a little sugar; put the carp on the dish, garnish with parsley, and send the sauce in a boat.

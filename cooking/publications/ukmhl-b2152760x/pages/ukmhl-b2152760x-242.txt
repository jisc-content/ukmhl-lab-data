THE IMPERIAL AND 216 if done fine, it will not look well, by being so long in the oven; it should not be put in the oven the same evening that it is made, but next morning, or evening: the best oven for it, is just when the bread is drawn out: leave it in about eight hours; when you take it out of the oven, be care- ful that you do not spill any fat that rises to the top, as that soaks into the geese and turkeys, and makes them mellow: this pie will take four and twenty hours to get cold, therefore you must prepare accordingly. It ought to be begun four days before the day on which it is wanted. Before the pie is sent up to the table there should be chopped aspic put in it, and the sheets of bacon taken off. This is the general rule, but not the rule that I either recommend or follow; for this reason : by taking the bacon off the geese, you let the air into the pie, and then the aspic will get sour and mouldy in a few days ; therefore I recom- mend the following method :â€”put the bones of the turkeys and geese, two old fowls, and two pounds of lean ham, into a proper sized stewpan, with twelve onions.

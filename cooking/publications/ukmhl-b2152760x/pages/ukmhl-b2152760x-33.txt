Before you put it into the tureen, taste it, as perhaps it may want a little salt, or a small bit of sugar: cut the crust of the rolls, which you took the crumb from, into round pieces, about the size of a shilling, and put them into the tureen before the soup is put in. N. B. All white soups should be wanned by putting the soup-pot into hot water.

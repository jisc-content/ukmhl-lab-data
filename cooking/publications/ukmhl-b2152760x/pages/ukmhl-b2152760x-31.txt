TIIE IMPERIAL AND ROYAL COOK, &c. SOUPS. IN making any kind of soups, particularly vermicelli, portable, brown gravy soup, or any other in which herbs are used, remem- ber to lay the meat in the bottom of your pan, with a large lump of butter. Having cut the roots and herbs small, stew them over the meat, and set the pan on a very slow fire. This will draw all the virtue out of the different ingredients, will pro- duce a good gravy, and a very different effect, in point of flavour, than if at first you had put in w ater. Fill your pan with wrater as soon as the gravy is almost dried up. Take off the fat as soon as it begins to boil, and then follow the directions for making the sort of soup you wish to have. B

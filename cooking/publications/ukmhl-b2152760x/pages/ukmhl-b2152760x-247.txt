ROYAL COOK. 221 small quantity of parsley, a little mace,, and about twenty-four shalots ; put about half a pint of stock ; set the stcwpan on a stove to draw down for half an hour, and then put three quarts of good stock ; let it boil for two hours, then strain it off, and reduce the liquid to one quart, or until it nearly becomes a glaze ; then put one pint of sherry wine to it, and put it away until the pie is baked ; when the pie has been out of the oven for half an hour, boil what was strained from the bones, &c. of the partridges, and put it to the pie; let it stand for twenty-four hours before it is cut. N. B. Do not take any of the fat from the pie, for that is what preserves it. A pie made in this manner will be fit for eat- ing three months after it is cut; in short, it cannot spoil in any reasonable time ; all cold pies are made in this manner: either poultry or game that is put in a raised crust, and intended not to be eaten until cold, should be boned, and the liquid that is to fill up the'pie made from the bones.

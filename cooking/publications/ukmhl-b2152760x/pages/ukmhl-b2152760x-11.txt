A D VE R 'RISE MEN T. fJ.^HE reader may probably ask, What necessity is there for another Cookery Book, after the immense number which have already appeared, many of them with the names of those who are considered as proficients in the art? My answer is, that notwithstanding the num- ber of publications on this subject, there is still room for another ; because most of those alluded to so much resemble each other, that no ma- terial difference can be discovered in their general plan or execution. The general fault of cookery books is, that they are loaded with unnecessary, and indeed trifling, receipts, which every one, who has the slightest knowledge of cookery, must be thoroughly acquainted with.

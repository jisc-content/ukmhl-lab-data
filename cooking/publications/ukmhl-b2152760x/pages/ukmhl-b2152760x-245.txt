219 ROYAL COOK. the tin cases are made by Mr. Bailis, in Cockspur-street, Charing-cross, who will give a proper direction how to use them, by lining it with paper, to give a clear idea to those who may not comprehend what I have said upon this subject. By using those tins, you are sure of all the liquor remaining in the pie : for instance; make a large pie, without a tin case ; an accident may happen to it, so as to crack in the oven, which lets the gravy and goodness out, and of course the true flavour of the pie is lost, and the cook blamed by his employer for what he could not avoid ; for at times the flour will not stand the oven without cracking; and it certainly does .not take half the flour, which is a great consideration : the Hn case will last a num- ber of years. There is another advantage, which is, there is no occasion to set the meat; for if the meat is not set, when the crust is raised it will burst the pie, and of course let out all the essence of the inside, which cannot be retrieved without double expense.

42 THE IMPERIAL AND PETHS AU GRATIN. Peths are taken out of the chine bones of beef, mutton, or veal; put them on to blanch; when come to a boil, take them off the fire, and throw them into cold water; wash them, and put them on a cloth to dry ; dip them in egg, and then in bread crumbs; do them twice over, and have clean lard in a stewpan; when hot, put in the peths, fry them of a light brown, and serve them up with fried parsley. RUMP OF BEEF A LA MANTUA. Trim a rump of beef, daube it, and put in a marinade for twelve hours ; then put it into a brown braise; put four large car- rots into a braise along with the beef, and four bundles of cabbage ; when the beef is done, take it up, and put it in the oven for a few minutes ; then glaze it; put sauce allemande on the dish and the cabbage, and a piece of carrot between each bundle of cabbage. t

232 THE IMPERIAL AND RISOLES. Mince any kind of white meat, such as fowl, turkey, or veal sweetbreads ; put a little beshemell in a stewpan, make it hot, then put in the mince, season with pepper and salt, a drop or two of garlick vinegar, the juice of half a lemon, and a little pounded sugar ; put it in a dish to cool; when quite cold, roll it up, either round or long ; beat up two eggs in a bason, dip the risoles in them, and roil them in bread crumbs; they should be done twice over; have some clear lard, made quite hot; (the lard is not hot enough for frying either risoles or fish, until it stops boiling); then put in the risoles; have a sieve by the stove where you are frying, to put them on as soon as done, which will not be many minutes; pick some parsley, and dry it before the fire ; put it in a proper cullender, and set the cullender in the lard ; about one minute will be sufficient to crisp it: lay the risoles round the dish, and parsley in the middle.

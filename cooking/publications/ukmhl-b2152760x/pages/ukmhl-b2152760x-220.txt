THE IMPERIAL AND 194 A CUSTARD PUDDING, EITHER BAKED OR BOILED. Boil a pint of milk and a pint of cream together, with cinnamon, lemon-peel, and nutmeg, for half an hour; strain it, and put it to cool; break eight eggs, (leaving out four whites), and add about a table- spoonful of flour ; beat them well; then add the milk and cream that have been boiled, and a glass of brandy : if for baking, put thin puff-paste at the bottom of the dish (first buttering it) and round the rim; then strain the custard into the dish; it will take about twenty minutes: if for boiling, butter the mould, and let it boil about half an hour : garnish the dish you send it up in with currant jelly, and pour wine sauce over it. CHESNUT PUDDING. Boil a dozen and a half of chesnuts a quarter of an hour; blanch, peel, and beat them in a mortar, with a little orange-flour.

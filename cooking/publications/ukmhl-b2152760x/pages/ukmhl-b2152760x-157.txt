ROYAL COOK. 131 PIGEONS A LA DAUBE. Take four or five pig-eons, cut off their feet and pinions, and split them through the breast; then take out the livers, and flat them with a cleaver: make a hot marinade of some scraped bacon, season it with mushrooms, or two green onions, pepper, salt, parsley, and a little nutmeg; fry all together for a few minutes, and let the pigeons be heated through in it, and let them remain till you put them upon your gridiron : take a thin slice of ham for each pigeon, and put them, with the ham, always at top; that is, when you turn your pigeons, turn your ham upon them : for your sauce, take a ladle of good stock, some sweet basil, a little parsley, a shalot minced very fine, and a few slices of mush- rooms ; boil all together a few minutes : dish the pigeons up with their breasts down- wards, let your ham continue upon them, and pour your sauce over them, with the juice of an orange or lemon.

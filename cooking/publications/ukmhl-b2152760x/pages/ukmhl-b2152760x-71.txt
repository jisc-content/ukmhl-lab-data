ROYAL COOK. 41 A FILLET OF BEEF LAltDED. Cut the fillet out of a sirloin of beef, trim it, and lard it; then lay it in a ma- rinade, made as follows:â€”put the fillet, after it is larded, in a deep dish, pour about half a pint of sallad oil over it, slice four or five onions, spread them over the meat, a few bay leaves and basil, and over them pour half a pint of vinegar; let it lay in this all night, then put it into a braising pan (but not a very deep one) with the marinade, and about a pint of stock, covered with bacon and pepper; be sure to let it simmer very gently; it will take two hours ; when done, pour off the liquor, and strain it; skim the fat from it very clean, reduce it to a glaze, and put Spanish sauce to it; boil four Spanish onions until they are done, glaze them, and put them round the beef when you dish it; put the sauce on the dish first, then glaze the beef, and put it on the sauce.

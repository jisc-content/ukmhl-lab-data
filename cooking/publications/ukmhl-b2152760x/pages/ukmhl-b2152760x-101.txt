ROYAL COOK. 71 the oven for a few minutes, and brown it with a salamander ; put beshemell on the dish, and the veal upon the sauce. N. B. A loin or neck of veal, that has been served up, and not cut, will answer the same purpose as well as a fresh roasted one, by papering it, and putting it in the oven to make hot. A ROULARD OF VEAL AND MUSHROOMS. Bone a breast of veal, and beat it with a beater or chopper, (the more it is beat, the better it will keep its shape when rol- led) ; brush it over with an egg beat up together; season it with pepper, spread some good force-meat over it, and egg the force-meat; roll the veal up with twine, and put it in a braise ; it will take two hours or more : if there should be a ham or rump of beef braising, put the veal in the same pan ; when done, take off the twine, but leave the skewers in, only put them out of sight; glaze it, and put the mushrooms under it.

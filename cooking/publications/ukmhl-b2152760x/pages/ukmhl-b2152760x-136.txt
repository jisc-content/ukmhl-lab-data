110 THE IMPERIAL AND about a pint of good stock on a quick stove ; when it boils, put some of the quenel into a large spoon ; have a tea-spoon, and put as much as it will hold into the stock until it is all in ; take it up with a slice the same as you would a poached egg; the quenel should be about the size of the yolk of an egg; pour white Italian sauce over them. FOUR PIGEONS LARDED, AND A RAGOUT OF COCKSâ€™ COMBS. Draw in the legs of four large pigeons, fill them with farce, and then lard them; lay sheets of bacon in the bottom of a stew- pan ; put a pint of stock in it, four onions, a little parsley, a few bay leaves, and a blade or two of mace ; put the pigeons in, cover them over with sheets of bacon, and set them on a stove to simmer for half an hour; put some lighted charcoal on the cover of the stewpan ; when the pigeons are done, finish them the same as other lardings ; put the ragout on a dish, and the pigeons on it: garnish with paste.

187 ROYAL COOK. CHINA ORANGE JELLY. Rub the bloom of six China oranges upon half a pound of sugar; peel three Seville oranges and three lemons very thin; put them into a stewpan with a pint of water, one ounce of isinglass, a little cin- namon, a few coriander seeds, and a few cloves ; boil all together until the isinglass is dissolved ; then strain it in a bason ; put a pint of white wine and a glass of brandy to it, the juice of the Seville and China oranges and lemons, and the sugar that was rubbed to the China oranges; keep stirring it until nearly cold, then put it into a mould : garnish with China orange sliced. N. B. If you should have clear jelly to spare, that will answer the purpose better than making it from isinglass; rub the bloom of six China oranges upon a cpiarter of a pound of sugar, squeeze the oranges, strain the juice, and put that and the sugar to a quart of clear jelly; keep stirring it until cold, then put it in the mould.

THE IMPERIAL AND 148 not use bacon; make the sauce with fish stock. MORUE A LA CREME. Salt a slice of crimpt cod one day, and boil it the next; and, while hot, break it in flakes; put about half an ounce of butter into a stewpan, with a chopped shalot, parsley, and a spoonful of stock ; let it boil for a minute or two, then put a little flour, as much as will make it of a proper thick- ness ; then put a little stock ; (if for mea- gre, cream ;) give it a boil for a few mi- nutes, put a little anchovy essence, squeeze a little lemon-juice, and a dust of sugar ; put the fish in the sauce ; let it stand to get hot by the side of a stove, but do not let it boil; put it as nearly in the middle of a dish as possible : garnish with paste and croutons. N. B. Crimpt cod that has been left the day before will do very well for this.

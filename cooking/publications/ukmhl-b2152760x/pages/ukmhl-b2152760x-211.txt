ROYAL COOK. 185 slieet, and sift a little sugar over them through a lawn-sieve, and put them in the oven ; the oven should be very quick ; they will not take many minutes; when done, take them out of the pans, and lay them on a dish, bottom upwards; wipe the pans very clean while hot. N. B. This batter will do for Naples biscuits, and different kinds of drops. Naples biscuit-mould's are different from the sponge cake-moulds; they are to be had at any tin-shop. MUSHROOM FRITTERS. Make batter the same way as for pan- cakes, only make it thicker, otherwise it will not stick to the mould ; (the mould is made by Mr. Buhle of St. Martinâ€™s Lane); have some lard hot in a stewpan, and have sweet oil in a tea-cup, or something of the same size, to dip the mould in ; drain the oil from it, then dip it in the batter, and then immediately in the hot lard; take it out as soon as the fritter becomes brown,

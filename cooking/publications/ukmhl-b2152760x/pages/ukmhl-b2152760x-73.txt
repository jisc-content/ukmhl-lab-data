43 KOVAL COOK. COLLARED BEEF. It is made from the fat ribs boned, and sprinkled with salt-petre and coarse brown sugar, and left so for two days ; then make about twro pounds of salt quite hot in a frying-pan, and rub it well into the beef; let it lay in salt for ten days ; wash it over with the pickle every second day, and turn it; put a few bay leaves in the pickle, and sprinkle the beef over- with a little fine spice about a week before it is boiled; before it is tied up in the cloth to boil, beat it for about five minutes upon the chopping-block w ith the flat part of the heaviest cleaver you have ; this makes it tender, and roll up the better, and wrhen boiled will keep its shape ; it should be boiled very tender, then taken up, and the ends of the cloth wrung quite hard, and tied up tighter; then put it into a press with an heavy weight upon it: if you have no press, put it in a dish, and press it as well as you can, and put the weight on it. N. B. Two ounces of salt-petre, and two ounces of sugar, are quite sufficient.

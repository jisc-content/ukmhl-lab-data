ItOYAL COOK. 103 PIGEONS A LA CRAPAUDINE, AND PIQUANT SAUCE. Split the pigeons at the belly, and turn the breast over; put four ounces of butter into a stewpan with chopped shalots, pars- ley, thyme, mushrooms, pepper, and salt; set the stewpan on the fire to melt the butter; put the pigeons on the dish, but not too near each other; pour the butter over the pigeons, and when the butter begins to get cold, roll the pigeons in bread crumbs, and put them in a souties-pan that has been buttered with clarified butter; do not turn them till the under-side is brown; when of a nice brown, lay them on a cloth to soak the butter from them: lay them round a dish, and the sauce in the middle. N. B. Six pigeons will make a dish ; the breast-bone should be taken out, and the leg and thigh boned ; the pinions cut off, the wing bone taken out, and the pigeons flatted with a flatter ; they may be broiled on the gridiron over a clear stove.

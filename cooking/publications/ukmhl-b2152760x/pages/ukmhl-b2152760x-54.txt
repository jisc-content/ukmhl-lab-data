THE IMPERIAL AND 24 joram, mace, and a carrot cut into slices ; put it over the fire ; and put a bit of butter, a little stock, a few bay leaves, and six heads of celery, in the stewpan : let it draw down about half an hour, then fill it up \ it;} second stock, or weak broth, and add a i tie white wine to it. This braise is used for beef, mutton, veal, ham, or any thing you want to eat mellow. DRY BRAISE. Put the trimmings of beef, mutton, or veal, into a stewpan, (the size according to what is intended to be braised,) and a few onions, a faggot of sweet herbs, a few blades of mace, and a few bay leaves ; put as much second stock as will come about three parts up to the meat; then cover the meat with sheets of bacon, or the fat of ham, if convenient; then lay on that which is intended to be braised. It is the best method for doing all larded things ; they take rather longer in doing, but eat much better ; and the bacon looks better by not letting any liquid come near it.

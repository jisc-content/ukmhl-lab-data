THE IMPERIAL AND 200 boil lemon-peel and cinnamon in a little milk, and strain it through the sago; put the whole into a bason ; break eight eggs, mix well together, and sweeten with moist sugar; add a glass of brandy, and nutmeg; put puff-paste round the rim of the dish, and butter the bottom : three quarters of an hour will bake it. T ARTS. CHERKY: Make a good crust; lay a little of it round the sides of the dish, and strew a little sugar at the bottom ; then lay in your fruit and sugar at the top ; put on your lid, and bake it in a slack oven: cur- rants mixed with the cherries will be a con- siderable improvement. A plumb or goose- berry tart may be made in the same man- ner.

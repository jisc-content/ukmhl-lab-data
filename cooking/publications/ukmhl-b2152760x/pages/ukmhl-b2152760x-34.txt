4 THE IMPERIAL AND VERMICELLI SOUP, WHITE OR BROWN. Blanch as much vermicelli as is wanted, by putting it on the fire in cold water ; let it boil up, then strain it off, and put it into cold water; let the vermi- celli stay in the water until it is cold, (if it is left on a sieve to drain while hot, it becomes lumpy, and will not dissolve again,) strain it quite dry from the cold water, put as much best stock as you want soup. If it is for white, make a liaison of six eggs. TO MAKE SAUCE FOR BOUILLI. Chop a boiled carrot, some parsley, two or three pickled cucumbers, and a few pickled mushrooms : put this into a sauce- pan, with a pint of good stock, aiid a spoon- ful of good mushroom catchup; season it with pepper and salt, and a little Cayenne ; put the bouilli on a dish, pour sauce on it, and send it to table.

89 ROYAL COOK. BARBECUED PIG. Prepare a young pig as for roasting ; make a force-meat of two anchovies, six sage leaves, and a liver, all chopped small; put them into a mortar, with the crumb of a roll, four ounces of butter, half a tea-spoon- ful of Cayenne pepper, and half a pint of red wine; beat it to a paste, put it in the pigâ€™s belly, and sew it up ; lay your pig down at a good distance before a brisk fire, singe it well, put some red wine into the dripping-pan, and baste it well all the time of roasting: when half done, put under the pig two rolls ; and should the wine be too much reduced, add more : when your pig is nearly done, take the bread and sauce out of the dripping-pin, and put to the sauce an anchovy chopped small, a bundle of sweet herbs, and half a lemon; boil it a few minutes; take up your pig, strain your sauce, and pour it on boiling hot: garnish with barberries and slices of lemon,

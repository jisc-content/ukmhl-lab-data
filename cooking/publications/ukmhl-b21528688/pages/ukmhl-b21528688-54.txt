30 Anchovy half-ounce scale is the best for ordinary use. Skin and bone the anchovies; pound them in a mortar with a little of the butter; rub them through a sieve with the back of a wooden spoon; mix the rest of the butter with them; and if they are to be served at table cold, tint them with rose pink and mould them into shape. Anchovy Essence.—The essence of anchovies sold in J shops is so often adulterated that it is wise to know how to be independent of it. Clean six anchovies, and pound them in a mortar with a tablespoonful of capers, two shalots, and two red chillies. Put them in a small stew- pan, with thyme, bayleaf, mace, and a wineglassful of mushroom ketchup, and let them simmer gently for five minutes. Then add two wineglassfuls of good broth and reduce it rapidly. Press it through a sieve, and finish it with a small piece of glaze and a little lemon-juice Never mind the want of colour, which in the essence of the shops is too often the result of baneful minerals. Anchovy Sauce is the English sauce made with an- chovy butter instead of ordinary butter; or otherwise, English sauce made in the ordinary way and flavoured with essence of anchovies. Anchovy Toast.—Cut slices of bread as for sandwiches, and fry them in clarified butter till they become brown without becoming hard and crisp; spread them with anchovy butter, upon this lay fillets of anchovies, and serve them hot. Andouillette is the name of a sausage made from andouille—the French name for chitterlings. Andomlle itself originally meant a sausage, being no other than the Latin inductilis—a duct into which minced meat has been inducted. We know little of the andouillette in England. In France it is a great favourite; but it can be had in perfection at Dumas’, 55, Prince’s Street, Leicester Square. It is to be grilled and eaten very hot.

I25 Cinnamon held possession of Ceylon, they were known at times to burn the cinnamon, in order to limit the supply and to keep up the price. But the supply is limited in any case, for though the bark grows again upon the cinnamon trees, it takes three years to do so; and a crop which comes but once in three years cannot be considered abundant. More- over the tree is otherwise exhausted, for the Cingalese express from the root a juice that hardens into camphor, the medical virtues of wjiich are nearly as famous as those of the cinnamon bark. There are points of interest about cinnamon in connec- tion with old cookery; and three of these may be noted.

According to old English receipts, dating from the time of Chaucer, it was made of currants, kernels of nuts, crusts of bread, ginger, cloves, flour of cinnamon, and salt brayed well and mixed with vinegar.

It was usual in those days to- name a dish from one of its many ingredients, and we are sur- prised to find that the ingredient selected for the name is often by no' means the most prominent- There was a mus-

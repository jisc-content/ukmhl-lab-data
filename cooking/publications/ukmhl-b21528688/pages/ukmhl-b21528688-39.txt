Introduction >5 methods and dogmatic in their conclusions; but if the object of science be knowledge, and not mere show, I should like to ask, what has chemistry with all its para- phernalia done for the science of food ? Here is its last result, embodied in a little table, which is borrowed from Dr. Henry Letheby’s book On Food. It is a table of what is called “ Nutritive Equivalents—calculated according to the amounts of Nitrogen in the dry sub- stances—human milk being ioo.” There never was a greater farce than the following table of Nutritive Values: — Vegetable Rice . 81 Oats • 138 Potatoes • 84 White Bread . 142 Maize IOO Black Bread . 166 Rye 106 Peas • 239 Radish 106 Lentils 276 Wheat 119 Haricots • 283 Barley • 125 Beans . 320 Animal Human Milk . 100 Lamb • 833 Cow’s Milk • 237 White of Egg. • 845 Yolk of Egg- . ■ 305 Lobster- . 850 Oysters , • 305 Skate 850 Cheese • 331 Veal • 873 Eel . • 434 Beef . 880 Mussel • 528 Pork 893 Ox liver . • 570 Turbot . 898 Pigeon • 756 Ham . . 910 Mutton • 773 Herring . • 914 Salmon . • 776 It appears from this that white of egg is more than twice as nourishing as the yolk, and that a red herring is more than nine times as nourishing as mother’s milk. W hat can be the worth of a science that works out such incredible results ? Dr. Letheby has himself pointed out, i esults even if they were trustworthy—be valueless,

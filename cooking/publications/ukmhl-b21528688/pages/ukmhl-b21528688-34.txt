Introduction IO are limited to a few scores ? It has been calculated that there are something like 5°° soups; and Careme used to boast that he had turned out about 300. By far the greater number of these he probably prepaied but once in his life; and it is quite certain that the great majority of them were trifling repetitions one of another. How soups can be multiplied we have already seen in the various forms of garden soups, where clear gravy is used. After all, it is probable that receipts would not be so multiplied in the books but for a great piactical fallacy. It is always assumed that a cookery book will make a cook. Nothing can be more false. If a man or a woman has not the soul of a cook, the most minute leceipts will only end in failure. Sganarelle is made to say by Moliere—“Roti, bouilli—meme chose;” and it is a literal verity that there are persons pretending to be cooks who are as ignorant as Sganarelle, and who cannot tell what is the essential peculiarity of roasting, or why some meats are to be roasted and others only stewed. If on the other hand the soul of the cook is there, it is almost always enough to give general rules and leading prin- ciples, and to leave the cook to make variations accoid- ing to his taste or his means. Lord Byron, in Italy, ga\ e the most minute directions for his plum-pudding , it came out like a broth, and was served in a tureen. There are cooks in the best kitchens who have been shown ever so often how to clarify broth; yet they fail, and have to tn over and over again before they can succeed. The gi eat thing, it cannot be too often repeated, is to teach a principle, and then its application to special cases follows as a matter of course. He who has learnt to broil a steak properly does not require a special receipt for broiling a mutton chop; and he who can make half a dozen sauces has really learnt how to make half a hundred without extra receipts. . It is well to be particular in receipts; but it is idle to

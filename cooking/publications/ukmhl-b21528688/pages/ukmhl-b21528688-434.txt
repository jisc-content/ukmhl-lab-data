Sauce 4io man of a regimental mess. Alter long; and anxious dis- cussions with his friend De Cussy, the great gastronomer agreed to remodel his aphorism, and to say On devient cuisinier, on devient rotisseur, on nait saucier . Cooking and roasting are things to teach; it needs genius to make a sauce. We may overwhelm the chemist of sauces with rules and receipts ; they are of little use without a natural gift. To make a perfect sauce is indeed the height of culinary art; but before the reader comes to the end of this article he will be constrained to admit that the saucemaker owes, in a sense of which Brillat-Savarin had no conception, more than half of his success to a subtle skill in roasting which no ordinary cook ever possesses, and which invests with a new and unexpected meaning the celebrated aphorism in its original form.

The French have two leading sauces—a brown and a white one—which are the Adam and Eve of all their other preparations and reductions of gravy. We need not at

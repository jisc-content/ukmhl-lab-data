Vegetables 475 There is much more, of course, to be said of veal under other names—as Calf’s Head, Calf’s Foot, Liver, Heart, Sweetbread. Vegetables.—There are no finer vegetables to be found anywhere than in England; and the English do not know how to eat them. The weak point of an English dinner is always the vegetables.

As far as animal food can go, there are some dinners quite perfect, with a good soup, a little plain- boiled fish, and roast meat or game—but the dinner fails because the vegetables are at fault. There are some good remarks on this matter in the Original (see No. xix.). “ I have observed,” says Walker, “ that whenever the vege- tables are distinguished for their excellence, the dinner is always particularly enjoyed; and if they were served with each dish, as they are most appropriate and fresh from the dressing, it would be a great improvement on the present style. With some meats something of the kind is prac- tised—as peas with duck, and beans with bacon—and such combinations are generally favourites; but the system might be much extended, and with great advantage. With respect to variety of vegetables, I think the same rule applies as to other dishes. I would not have many sorts on the same occasion, but would study appropriateness and particular excellence.

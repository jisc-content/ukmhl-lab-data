Introduction I 2 be evident that the attempt to attain precision of detail in receipts is wholly illusive. We can at best give indications and approximations, but numerical accuracy is out of the question. In one point, however, accuracy is well within our reach, and nearly all the cookery books even those produced under the eyes of great artists make a mock of it: we can be accurate in language. In the whole range of literature and science, there is nothing to be found comparable to the inaccuracy and corruption of culinary language. It is something astounding. It seems as if all the ignorances in the world had conspired together to darken speech and to stupefy cooks. There is no science of cookery possible without a conect phraseology. Science is but another name for clear and classified knowledge; and the first step to it is precision of speech. It is for this reason that in the following pages the reader will find more than usual attention paid to the naming of dishes and to their histoiy. At the present moment the vocabulary of dinner is a mass of confusion and ridiculous mistakes, which is every day becoming worse and worse through the ignorant importation of French names (originally themselves bad enough) into English bills of fare. It comes of abomin- able pretension. A leg of good English mutton—the best in the world—will be entered as a Gigot of Pre Sale. What on earth has become of the English Southdowns that they should be described as a French Salt Marsh?

This is not merely pretension: it is perfidy, h ou oidei the Oriental fillet expecting one thing, and you get something quite different. Some people may innocently argue.—" What harm is

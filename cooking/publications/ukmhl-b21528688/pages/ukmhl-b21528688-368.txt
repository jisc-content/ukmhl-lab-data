Pig 344 with; it had one plain meaning, all its own; and it held its own even after the word pasty came into fashion by the side of it. This was due not merely to its own force, but to the fact that there was another word pie which came to help it out. From the beginning until now it has always been most common for the pie to encase a bird or birds of some sort. Now in France one of the most frequent names for a bird to be eaten was pied.-—a foot. Cotgrave, whose dictionary is of the highest authority, notes a proverbial phrase,—“a l’avocat le pied en main,”—and explains it as applying to ‘‘partridges, pheasants, capons, etc., where- with they (that is, the advocates) look to be now and then presented.” To this day it is common enough in France to speak of the smaller birds intended for the table as les petits pieds. But the English form and spelling of pied was pie—you have it in cap-a-pie. There appears, therefore, to have been a blending of names—two pies—the one from pain, denoting more immediately the crust, the other from pied, denoting more immediately the contents of the pie, and both combining to establish the name in opposition to the newly introduced one of pasty. To this day on the top of a pigeon pie there is, in allusion to the name, a show made of the feet; and in some parts of England an apple pie is called an apple foot. If the reader asks, In what parts of England? I cannot answer; but I can give my authority, —namely, Todd in his edition of Johnson’s dictionary. As for the making of pies, the receipts for the various crusts will be found under the name of Paste; and those for the contents—as Apple, Eel, Pigeon—under the head of each. Pig is a name reserved for sucking-pig. The gluttonous creature of the sty is concealed under the name of pork. It is difficult to wax eloquent on pork; but listen to Charles Lamb on the sucking-pig :— “ Of all the delicacies in the whole mundus edibilis,” he

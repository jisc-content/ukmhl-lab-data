Whitebait 490 ancestors, if they were ever there, no longer seem to approve of. To dress the whitebait:—i. First of all, strew some flour upon a cloth. I observe that some of the receipts speak of egg. Have nothing to do therewith. Flour is enough. 2. Take the whitebait out of the water with your hands, and drain them through your fingers. Some of the receipts warn you not to handle them. This is non- sense. The object of the warning is to prevent the hands from warming the fish; but they need not be held long enough in the hand to do so. 3. When they are drained throw them on the flour in the cloth. 4. Let them roll in the flour, by shaking the corners of the cloth successively. They will not stick together if .they are fresh. 5. Pass them on to a large wooden sieve, to get rid of superflous flour. 6. Put them into a wire frying-basket. 7. Dip the basket into a frying-kettle of very hot beef-fat. This point is important. Many of the receipts say lard—which is a mistake. Nothing so good as ox- kidney fat. 8. There let them rest for three minutes upon the fire motionless. At the end of that time give them a light shake, though without taking them out of the fat. In half a minute more perhaps another shake. 9. Four minutes—at most five—of the hot fat ought to be enough for them, for they must not be allowed to brown. 10. Take them out of the frying-kettle, and while they are still in the basket sprinkle salt over them. Give them a shake and then another sprinkle. 11. They are now ready for table, they ought to be slightly crisp, and they are to be served with brown bread and butter and quarters of lemon.

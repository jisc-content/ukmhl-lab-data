A pplc 33 which have been taken, at ever so many removes, from this tree will cease to bear, though themselves quite recent. If there is a scarcity of any kind of apple, it is through neglect. The redstreak, which Sir Isaac Newton loved, and which was our most popular apple in the seventeenth century, is dying out, simply because it is not sufficiently prized : it is replaced by berter varieties everywhere, except in the cider counties, where it is found useful. The oldest apple of which we have any record in England is the pearmain : it dates many centuries back, and it shows no sign of decay. It is a curious fact, however, with regard to the old winter pearmain, which is supposed to be the father ol all the other varieties of pearmain, that it ripens in December. Now, the earliest record of the pearmain occurs in a tenure in the county of Norfolk, which bears the date 1200, and requires that 200 pearmains and four hogsheads of pearmain cider should be paid into the Exchequer yearly at Michaelmas. This surely implies that the pearmain was ripe before Michaelmas,â€”and there is indeed a pearmain, by some called the summer, by others the autumn pearmain, which ripens early in September. Dr. Hogg, however, who is the chief authority on apples in this country, has decided that the old pearmain is the winter variety. He has also explained that the last syllable of the name is the same as in the old spelling of Charlemaine. Pearmain therefore means an apple like a great pear. I here are about 1,500 varieties of apple named. It will be enough here to give the names of about fifty of the best, in the order of the months in which they ripen. The names of the months mentioned after them show the length ol time they ought to keep il well looked after. It is curious to note that, unlike other fruits, the best apples, and those which keep the longest, are those which ripen latest. 3

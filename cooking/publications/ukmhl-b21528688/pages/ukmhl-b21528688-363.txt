But when in that sublimated future which is to come, which will make human nature perfect and all the methods of food divine, the refined New Zealander, who is- to write our history dilates upon the manner of our eating, what astonishment will he not raise when he comes to speak of pepsin ! We have our own pleasant thoughts upon the emetics which preceded a Roman meal, and think with wonder of the great captain, Julius Caesar, preparing himself for a fresh repast by disgorging the undigested remains of the previous one.

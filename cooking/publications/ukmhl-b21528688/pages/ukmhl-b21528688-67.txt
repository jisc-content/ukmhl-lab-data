43 A spai'agus conscious of effort. The Barigoule and Lyonnese receipts are frantic attempts to paint the lily and to perfume the violet. When a great cook brings the whole battery of his kitchen to bear upon a simple artichoke bottom, one is reminded of Victor Hugo’s comparison : “ It is as if the Deity were to bombard a lettuce with a thunderbolt.” Depend upon it that the simplest way of dressing the artichoke is the best.

When we hear that it is ranked with the asphodels, we are ready to believe that the fields of asphodel in which the blessed roam in Elysium must be beds of asparagus. It is

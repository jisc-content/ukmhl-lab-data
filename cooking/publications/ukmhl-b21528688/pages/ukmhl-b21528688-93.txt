69 Bisque might have led the learned Frenchmen to the true meaning of the word. They have been put off the scent by trusting to modern usage. Littre defines a bisque as a soup of cray- fish, and that is what it usually means in our day. He has failed however to observe that purists in France never call the soup of crayfish a bisque—they always say a bisque d’ecrevisses, implying that there may be a bisque of some- thing else. In some of the old French cookery books the crayfish soup is described perfectly as Potage aux c'erivisses en facon de bisque. The word is now employed exactly as we employ such words as marmalade, wine, pomatum, orgeat, saveloy. Marmalade is a conserve of quinces—we give the name to a conserve of oranges. Wine is the juice of the grape; but we speak of cowslip and gooseberry wine. Pomatum is a1 cosmetic of apples, and never now does an apple enter into it. Orgeat ought to be no other than barley-water—it is now made of almonds without a grain of barley. Saveloy, from the French cervelas, for- merly cervelat, is a sausage made of brains, and now there are no brains in it. Precisely in the same way, bisque was a soup of wood-pigeons, and it is now never made of wood- pigeons, but nearly always of crayfish. Piscium et summa genus hfesit ulmo Nota qure sedes fuerat columbis. Any one who will go back to the French cookery books of the seventeenth century will find invariably that the bisque is made of pigeons, or else of small birds such as quails or partridges, which may be supposed superior to them. It was not merely a soup : one of the books de- scribes it accurately as a soup with a ragout in it; and for the precise meaning of Ragout in the French turn to the word. La Varenne, the greatest cook of the seventeenth century before Vatel, gives two receipts for pigeon soup, neither of which he denotes by the name of bisque; but he also gives two, and only two, receipts for bisque, and they

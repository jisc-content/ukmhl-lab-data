95 Butter and Brazil, about 50,000 tons of butter a year, the produce of nearly 500,000 cows. Most Englishmen would be appalled if they entered a French kitchen and saw the quantity of butter which the cook uses. We digest a French dinner with ease; but let people see the butter absorbed in it—all their pre- judices rise, and they have a fit of dyspepsia.

They are of infinite variety, and when once the simple principles on which they are formed have been mastered, the cook, like a pianist who presents a well-known air with many varia- tions, may show his or her ingenuity in ringing the changes upon them. There are various preparations of butter used for sauce,—

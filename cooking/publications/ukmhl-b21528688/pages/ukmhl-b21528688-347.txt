Oysters he came upon the oxtail soup; he opened his eyes, and he made such a proclamation of. the goodness of the tanners’ soup that it became at once fashionable, and now Mr. Punch can speak of it as among the first and foremost of an Englishman’s thirty-nine articles of faith. Oxtail Soup.—Take two large or three small oxtails, divided at the joints, and soak them well in lukewarm water. Then put them into a stewpan with a pound of ham or knuckle of bacon, three quarts of cold water, an ounce and a half of salt; set them on the fire to boil, and remove the scum. When the scum ceases to rise add three carrots, three onions, two turnips, and a head of celery, a faggot of sweet-herbs, six cloves, and a dozen peppercorns. Stew all gently for three hours, and then take out the oxtails. Strain the broth, get rid of the fat, put back the tails, thicken the soup with arrowroot or rice-flour, and finish it to taste with cayenne, salt, a spoonful of ketchup, and it may be a glasslul of Marsala. If the oxtails are stew'ed longer they will yield an extremely gelatinous soup, but the meat will be in rags and unfit for presentation. Stewed Oxtail.—Take an oxtail disjointed, and soak it well in lukewarm water. Then put with it in a stewpan a couple of onions, a couple of carrots, a faggot of sweet- herbs, and broth enough to cover it. Or for another com- bination put it into the stewpan with a Mirepoix of white wine, and with broth enough, as before, to cover all. Simmer it very gently for two or three hours. The oxtail may then be dished, and it may be sauced and garnished in a variety of ways. If surrounded with its gravy (strained), and garnished with lettuce brazed in the French way and intermingled with carrots, it is called Queue de Boeuf en hochepot. It may also be garnished with a Macedon of vegetables, with a puree of lentils, or with either the Soubise or the Breton purde of onions. Oysters.-—More than two hundred years ago Thomas

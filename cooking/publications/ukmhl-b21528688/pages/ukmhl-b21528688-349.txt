Oysters 325 left on the flat shell from which the liquor drains off. If, however, one could sometimes see the dirty liquor in which the oysters lie ready for opening, and in which they are opened behind the oyster bar of some fish shops, perhaps there would be no desire to taste the oyster at all, and cer- tainly none to see it in the hollow shell bathed in discoloured brine. Oyster Sauce.—Boil two dozen oysters very gently in their own liquor for five minutes, always remembering that quick boiling will harden them ; then drain them and beard them. Go through the first step of making English sauce, using the liquor of the oysters (strained, of course) instead of water, and adding- an equal quantity of milk. Put in the oysters, heat up the sauce, and lastly melt into it—but no more than melt—an ounce of butter. For a broiled beefsteak it is preferable to use good brown gravy instead of the milk. Oyster Soup.—Take twenty-four oysters : remove the fins or beards and tendons, and put all together—oysters, fins and tendons—to simmer for ten minutes in their own liquor, along with a small sole. The sole, the fins and the tendons are then to be pounded in a mortar and passed into a stewpan, with the liquor of the oysters, a quart of water, or still better fish-stock, a faggot of sweet-herbs, and a few peppercorns. Let it boil for fifteen or twenty minutes, and then work into it an ounce of butter kneaded into an ounce of flour till the flour be thoroughly cooked. 1 he soup can then be strained into a tureen; thickened with a leason composed of one yolk of egg and two table- spoonfuls of cream ; seasoned with cayenne and salt; and finally populated with the oysters.

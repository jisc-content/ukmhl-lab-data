The name of the soup takes its rise in Scotland from an idea which was once prevalent that there was nothing so good for soup as an old cock. This ancient bird has given way to a capon, and sometimes it never appears in the soup. It will also be observed that extraordinary stress is laid upon the leeks—too great a stress, indeed, for most tastes.

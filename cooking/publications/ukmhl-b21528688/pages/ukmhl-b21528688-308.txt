284 Mace for fifteen minutes, strain away the water, add some new milk to it, and let it cool. When cold, mix into it three or four beaten yolks of eggs; sweeten it with sugar, and season it with nutmeg, cinnamon, and a glass of noyau. Put it into a pudding-dish with a layer of orange marma- lade or apricot jam in the centre, and bake it. Macaroni Soup.—-Some macaroni added to a clear broth or consomme. When any of the Italian pastes are used in this way, they should be boiled first for five minutes in water, otherwise they may dim the clearness of the broth. Talleyrand laid down the law that with all the soups in which macaroni, vermicelli, and other Italian pastes are used, grated Parmesan should be served apart, and a glass of Madeira afterwards. Mace is but the outer shell of the nutmeg, and resembles it in flavour. The nutmeg has been laughed out of cookery, and is chiefly now represented in the aromas of the kitchen by its husk—the mace. Macedon, or in French Macedoine, is a name which is supposed to have been used in the first instance to signify a medley of vegetables, but which has so pleased the French ear that it has been applied to almost any kind of medley. It would not be classical, but it would be unimpeachable, to translate The Princess : a Medley, into La Princesse : une Macedoine. The French are at a loss to account for this locution, which they have themselves invented, and can only suggest, one after another, that it must have had its rise in the fact that the Macedonian Empire was a medley of many strange nations and races, and that its name therefore was appropriate in the first instance to a mixture of vegetables, and afterwards to any mixture remarkable for its variety. The explanation is characteristic of our friends across the water, and is even worthy of Manage.

Salpicon 406 seasoned with spiced salt, moistened with fish broth, covered with a paste, sent to the oven, and eaten cold. Salmon Omelet.—Hot flakes of salmon mixed with Allemande sauce, and put into the omelet before folding it up.

The kipper which comes to London is so well kippered that lew can afford to eat more than a very thin slice of it grilled with exceeding swiftness. There are few dainties for breakfast, however, more delicious and more harmless than salmon which is but slightly kippered—that is, salmon which, being per- fectly fresh, has undergone the kippering for not more than two or three days. Rub it with a little butter, and grill it in any quantity. This is one of the glories of a Highland breakfast, and it is to the stomach of a Scotch baillie what turtle is to a London alderman.

Take a quart of the liquor in which it has boiled; add to it half an ounce of peppercorns and pimento whole, half a pint of vinegar, a teaspoonful of salt, a couple of bayleaves, and a spring of lemon-thyme; and boil them together. When cold, pour it over the salmon and cover it up. The fish will keep good in this for several days. To strengthen the pickle, boil it afresh with more vinegar and spice.

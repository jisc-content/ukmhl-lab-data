268 Kirschenwasser hint from the faggot of Duxelles. Cover and pinch it up, tie it in a cloth, and steam it or boil it for an hour and a half. Kirschenwasser.—This cherry-water is an excellent and wholesome liqueur made in the Black Forest from geans. It is sometimes fiery, and many persons are afraid of it who have no fear of maraschino, which is also made from geans. The flavour of the Black Forest cherry- water is, however, much more simple than that of the Dalmatian liqueur, and pleases the palate longer; only to put the two liqueurs on a level for fair comparison it is necessary to manipulate the Kirchenwasser. Put some into a strong glass, or better, into a saucer. Take a lump of sugar, dip it into the liquid, set fire to it, and replace it in the saucer so that the whole may take flame. When the flame expires and the sugar is dissolved, taste the cherry-water, and see if it be not superior to any Maraschino. It whiles away ten minutes after dinner in a pretty little blue-flamed game to burn the cherry-water and bring it to the perfection fit for my lady’s taste. Kit-kat.—Truly the name of this gentleman deserves to live, though it has had an evil influence on the mutton- pies in which he excelled. Mr. Christopher Katt— familiarly known as Kit-kat—was an admirable pastry- cook. A celebrated club used to meet at his house-— Addison and Steele among the number—and took the name of the Kit-kat Club. Their portraits were painted by Sir Godfrey Kneller of three-quarter size—hence any portrait of the same size is called a Kit-kat. But the mutton-pies of Mr. Katt were so good that they have raised an unhappy prejudice against all succeeding ones. * People always asked for the mutton-pies of Katt. The sound of the name lived when its meaning was forgotten, and no one now ever sees a mutton-pie without wondering whether it comes of cat.

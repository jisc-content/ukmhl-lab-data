Haricot 242 shell. Or again we speak of a dog-kennel, forgetful of the fact that kennel (canile) is itself a dog-house, and that therefore to say dog-kennel is in effect to say dog-dog- house. Unhappily, in England, the haricot is little known except in the unripe pod. It is the only vegetable which we eat in the pod, and the technical name for it in this condition is green haricots, or in French haricots verts. It would be more convenient, however, to speak of them as haricot pods, to distinguish them from the haricot seeds which are also green, as peas or beans are, and not merely white and red. In England the only kinds of haricot that come to perfection are the dwarf kidney-bean, known as the French bean, a native of India introduced into England three centuries ago; and the scarlet runner, a native of South America, introduced in 1663, but so little regarded as an article of food that up to the end of last century it was chiefly used as an ornamental flower, or petted as a curiosity among twining plants because it is the only one which twines the opposite way of the sun.

384 Roasting qualities of meat require somewhat different treatment. The time usually allowed is from fifteen to twenty minutes for a pound. Before removing the meat from the fire, press the lean part with the thumb : if the meat yield easily, or if the meat steam to the fire it is done. Never sprinkle salt over the meat till about a quarter of an hour before it is ready. Pour away the dripping before using the salt, because fat used for puddings and pies and frying is better without salt. You may dredge a little flour over it; and every part should be of a nice pale brown : if any part be scorched or blackened, you have failed in your cooking. Pour off the dripping, leaving in the pan the pure gravy free from fat. Have a gill or half a pint of stock or broth, or water, ready; pour it into the dripping- pan, rinse it round, strain it into the dish, and send it to table as quickly as possible. Some cooks tie a piece of buttered paper on the meat.‚Äù Time-table for Roasting. The following figures are not exact. A great deal depends on the quality of the meat to be roasted, its dis- tance from the fire, and the heat of the fire. In England, said CarSme, all the women roast well; but he attributed the success of English roasting to the constancy of a coal fire and to the regularity of the bottle-jack, which has not, like the turnspit machine in France, to be wound up every quarter of an hour.

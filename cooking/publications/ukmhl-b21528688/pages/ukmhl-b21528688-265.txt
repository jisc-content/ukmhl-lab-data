Haricot 241 trench as two distinct words, all through the guttural r of the Germans, which seemed to make an additional syllable of itself. And this is precisely what has happened to ragout. It went over to Germany and came back in German pronunciation haricot or hericot, which was all the more easily accepted as in Provence there was a word fricot, which is still in use, which means, like haricot, a savoury stew, and which seemed to give it a sort of fraternal right. So much for the stew as regards its name; and for more of a practical nature turn to Ragout and Navarin. We have now to account for the name of the bean. And here the French have gone astray through a false notion that the word is still the same. Haricot, the bean, is a distinct word which has nothing whatever to do with a ragout. It means a snail. There has been a peculiar tendency to designate this kind of bean in a simile. The ancients called it Phaseolus—a little boat, and Linnaeus has fixed this for the name of the tribe. We in England call it a kidney-bean; and the Portuguese called one of its varieties a caracol or snail, the Italians a caraco or caracolla. This is the word which the French have transfigured into haricot and have allotted to the species. They turned the 1 at the end into t, just as they made apricoque into abricot and l’oriole into loriot. That the initial should be transmuted into a simple aspirate is quite in accordance with the possibilities of a language which has chat for cat, and of a word which in one form (said to be Arabic) appears as garagol. Com- pare garb (a sheaf) with harvest. To one particular variety of the kidney-bean Linnaeus gave the name of Phaseolus Caracalla, and the French recognise it as haricot limagon, which is a reduplication of the original name, the meaning of which has been lost. Such reduplications are common enough. Thus in English we speak of a cockle- shell—forgetful of the fact that cockle (coquille) is itself a 16

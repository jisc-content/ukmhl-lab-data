358 Potato the stove, with only its edge over the hre; put back the wire basket into it, and in two minutes more the frying will be complete, and the potatoes beautifully crisp, of a rich golden colour. The whole time for frying should be as near as possible seven minutes—not counting, of course, the time required for re-heating the fat. The salting is not to take place till the last. Shake some salt over them in the wire basket, give a shake of the basket, and then another shake of salt. Let all the fat drain away, and then serve.

It is best to cut them lengthwise, in slices of equal thickness; and when putting these slices into the fat, care must be taken that they do not adhere to one another.

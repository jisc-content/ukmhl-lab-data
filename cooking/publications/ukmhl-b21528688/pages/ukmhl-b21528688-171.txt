Currants i47 so valuable that there are many imitations of it; but all are far behind the great original, which is made from the peel of an orange very difficult to obtain. It is a bitter orange which grows in the island of Curacoa, and falls from the tree before it is ripe. The peel of this is dried, and is known in commerce as the Cura£oa of Holland, to distinguish it from other Curacoas which have not the same property, though they are often sold in place of it. The Dutch distillers naturally keep their process a secret, but the French ones declare the Dutch secret to be simply this—that five kilogrammes of dried peel of the Curaijoa of Holland, and the zests of eighty fresh oranges are sub- mitted to the action of sixty litres of very strong alcohol (85°, French measurement); and that there is no' real difference between white curacoa and brown. Currants—properly, Corinths.—These are a small stoneless grape, which now come chiefly from Zante, but originally from Corinth, whence the name. There are more of these currants used in England than in all the world besides. It is a question whether the English par- tiality for them is reasonable, for they are very indigestible, though cheap and in moderation pleasant. The Zantiotes scarcely understand what we do with them—they fancy we must use them for a dye; and they tread them in barrels with their feet so hard, that sometimes the mass of cur- rants can only be broken with a mattock. No doubt the feet of these illustrious Greeks enhance the relish of the fruit, and add an unsuspected joy to our puddings and cakes. Currants—properly, Currans.—We are now speaking of the berry which botanists call Ribes, and which is known in England in three leading families—the gooseberry, red and green ; the red currant with a white variety; and the black currant; the first being large and prickly, the other two small and smooth. 'They are said to derive their name from their resemblance to the currants of the Levant; but

Pastry 332 these good things, however, to navigation; whereas pastry we owe to the kitchen. It was quite within reach of the ancients to invent the modern pie, and they failed to hit upon it. The following are the pastes most frequently in use :— 1. Hot-water paste for raised pies—that is, pies baked without dishes or patty-pans. Melt four ounces of butter in half a pint of hot water and work it with half an ounce of salt into a pound of flour. This is chiefly used in England. The French prefer the following because of the eggs. 2. Cold-water paste for raised pies. Use the same quantities as for No. i, but substitute three yolks of eggs for an equal displacement of water. This also makes a good short paste for ordinary pies. 3. Puff paste for a Vol-au-vent, the lightest and leafiest, called by the French Feuilletage. This deserves to be mentioned before the more common kinds because, although it is the most difficult of all the pastes, it best illustrates the principle of the puff pastes, and once mastered ensures a mastery of all the rest. Put a pound of flour on the pastry slab with about half an ounce of salt. Make a well in it for cold water, of which close on half a pint will be needed, and mix it into a smooth paste. Dry it with flour until the slab is quite cleared, but work it as little as possible, and leave it alone for a minute or two to get cool from the heat of the hands before the next process begins, which has to do with the butter. Take a pound of butter, very cold, and with every drop of milk or water squeezed out of it, and press it out flat so as to form a square of something between nine and ten inches. It is not essential in practice to be too par- ticular about these numbers, which are given chiefly to make the principle clear. Roll out the paste to something between thirteen and fourteen inches square,—that is, such a size that when the butter square is put upon it diagonally, the four corners of the paste square folded over and meet-

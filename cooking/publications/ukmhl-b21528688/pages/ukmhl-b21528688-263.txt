239 Hai icoi been accepted by the leading French authority, M. Littrt;, as well as by the German authorities, Scheler and Diez. The oldest mention of the word is to be found in a cookery book which is supposed to bear the date of 1393— Le Menager de Paris. There is a receipt there given for “ hericot de mouton,” the first sentence of which says that the mutton must be cut into pieces. M. Genin has seized upon this sentence and has connected it with a very old French word—haligote or herligote, which he derives from the Latin aliquot !

A crust of bread is rubbed with garlic; it is thrown into a chicory salad to give it a flavour ; and all the world (at least in French) agree to call it, for some unknown reason—a capon. And so, no doubt, for some inexplicable reason a dish of kidney-beans was called after a mutton stew-—a haricot. It is almost incredible that men of learning and sense, who call each other spirituel in quoting this explanation, should allow themselves to be deceived by such follies.

They have always to begin by pointing out that a haricot of mutton is nothing more or less than a ragout of mutton; and yet it never seems to have occurred to them that haricot is radically the same word as ragout. In England, however, we are familiar with the fact that the French do not recognise their own words when returned to them from abroad. Ages ago the English took the French word been/ and

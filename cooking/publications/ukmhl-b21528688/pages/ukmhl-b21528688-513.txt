489 Whitebait our wine whey, cream-of-tartar whey, alum whey, tamarind whey, etc., when the milk has been curdled by these several substances.”—Dr. Henry Lctheby. White.

It is said that the Scotch, with their banking propensities, their love of the Sabbath, and their aversion to pigs and eels, are the lost Ten Tribes; and on much the same evidence it is proved that whitebait are the fry of the common herring. It was for a long time supposed that whitebait, which come up the Thames as far as Blackwall, are the young of that fresh- water herring—the shad, which also comes thus far up the river. They were then proved to be quite distinct from the fry of the shad. It was next insisted that they were a distinct species of herring. It was afterwards pointed out that whitebait have never been found with roe; and therefore they must be young. It is now de- clared that they are the infant progeny of the common herring, with all the manners of the parent fish save this —that they travel up the Thames to haunts which their

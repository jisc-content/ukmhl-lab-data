76 Boiling go to our food with singing like our ancestors, and if we could lender thanks for it to God with a sense of enjoy- ment as lusty as theirs. Boiling.—If one might judge by the use of the word, there is no mode of cookery so common as boiling'. As a matter of fact, however, true boiling' is extremely rare, and is nearly always of short duration. Boiling in the strict sense is a word of the widest and vaguest meaning. Milk will boil at a comparatively low temperature; so will spirits; on the other hand, fats and oils have their boiling" point at a prodigious heat; but in common parlance, and in the language of the kitchen, to boil means to produce the temperature of boiling' water—that is, 212® Fahrenheit. Now, we may speak of boiling as much as we like; but in point of fact there is very little cooking performed at this heat of 2120. Nearly all cooking is done either a little below this degree or very much above it. The cooking which is done above the boiling point (as broiling, baking', frying, roasting) develops the peculiar roast flavours at a temperature of 4000 and upwards. The cooking which is done below the boiling point, and is known as stewing, simmering, seething, slow-boiling, works itself out often as low as 1700, but always below 2120. If all cookery is performed either a little below the boiling point of water or very high above it, the question may be asked—Is there any good in boiling proper, and what is the object of it ? Boiling heat is required almost solely for two purposes, and no more. 1. In the first place, for rapid reduction. One wants to evaporate the water from a sauce, an infusion, or a decoction, from vinegar, from wine, from milk. For this purpose of reduction, the cook resorts to the most brisk and violent ebullition within his means. 2. Violent boiling has also its use as a preliminary step in the cooking ol meat and of most vegetables. Let us say that a leg' of mutton is to be boiled : it will not really be boiled except

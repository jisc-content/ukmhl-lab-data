265 Julienne And now comes a curious point in confirmation of this view. Woodsorrel is a small low-lying plant in which the trefoil grows at the end of a slender threadlike stalk. Take a handful of these stalks, boil them in water, and this result will ensue : The leaves will nearly disappear, dissolved in the liquid, and the stalks will remain. The slender stalks in the soup became a characteristic of it, and people learned to see that Julienne was not Julienne unless the fine straws of the woodsorrel remained in it. The cooks recognised this, and when instead of woodsorrel they took to the use of common sorrel, they deemed it a point of honour to put threads of carrots and turnips and celery into their Julienne to represent the stalks which would be missed. There are receipts for making Julienne without any carrots, turnips, or celery whatever. These were introduced cut into threads or straws by cooks who felt bound to save appearances and to make up for the want of woodsorrel stalks. With this explanation in his hands the reader can now understand what Julienne soup according to the original idea ought to be. It is a clear broth or consomme with a large bunch of woodsorrel melted in it, leaving the stalks to be chewed. It was probably found in process of time that these stalks were not pleasant in the mouth, and they were replaced by threads of carrots, turnips, celery, lettuce, cabbage, leek, onionâ€”whatever would cut into strips and could be made tender by cooking; while at the same time common sorrel took the place of the Allelujah. The following is the ordinary modern receipt. Cut the red part of four carrots, four turnips, three onions, the white of one head of celery, and of six leeks, in straws about one inch long; put them in a stewpan with a quarter of a pound of butter and a pinch of pounded sugar; fry them over the fire to a light-brown colour; moisten them with three quarts of clear broth or double broth; simmer all very slowly on the stove-corner for

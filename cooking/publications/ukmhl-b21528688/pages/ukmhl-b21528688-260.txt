236 Hare Hare.—Roast Hare.—To be stuffed with Forcemeat No. 6; to be barded; and to be roasted on a spit for forty- five minutes before a brisk fire; and during the roasting to be frequently basted with butter or dripping. Five minutes before the hare is to be removed from the fire, take off the bards, sprinkle it with salt and flour, and baste it with fresh butter. When this froths up and the hare is brown, dish it with brown gravy underneath and currant jelly in a boat. The ears are considered a delicacy, and care should be taken not to burn them. They should be scalded and freed from hair before the roasting begins. Jugged Hare.—Old Receipt.

Pour over it a tumblerful of red wine, another of broth, and the juice of a Seville orange. Tie the mouth of the jar tight with bladder or leather and brown paper, and place it in a pan of boiling water deep enough to heat it well, but not to have a chance of boiling over and into the jar. In this situation the jug or jar is to remain three or four hours, the water boiling all the time and more added as it boils away. Then take out the hare, strain the liquor, skim off the fat, and add a thick- ening of roux. If in the meantime the hare should cool, put it back into the jug with the thickened gravy, and set it in the pot of boiling water till it gets hot, but by no means suffer it to boil. Serve it hot with slices of lemon and with currant jelly. Civet of Hare is practically the same thing—only it is not done in a closed jug. More liquor may therefore be used, both of wine and of broth, to make up for evapora- tion ; and the name of the dish is to be justified by serving up with it not indeed chives—which have very insignifi-

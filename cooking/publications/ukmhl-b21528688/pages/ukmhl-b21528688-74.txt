To this end she heated sand and plunged her vessels into it. dhe modern Mary bath is an imitation in hot water, which is not so good as sand, since it has no special aptitude for retaining beat, but has the advantage of being easily kept hot by connection with the boiler—and kept thus hot at a tem- perature which can never exceed 212 degrees Fahrenheit. Transferred with this change of sand into water from the laboratory to the kitchen, the Mary-bath is exceedingly

116 Chestnuts which have the flesh only half tender, firm, and crackling'. The first of these are called Geans proper, and are sub- divided into Black Geans and Red Geans; the second are called Black Hearts and White Hearts. The Griottes are likewise divided into two kinds, according to the shapes of the trees; and these are again sub-divided into Black Dukes and Red Dukes, according to the colour of the skin, Black Morellos and Red Morellos—the last being the Kentish cherry. Thus there are eight kinds: i Black Geans; 2. Red Geans; 3. Black Hearts; 4. White Hearts (where it is to be observed that the word heart refers to the shape); 5. Black Dukes; 6. Red Dukes; 7. Black Morellos; 8. Red Morellos. Cherry Brandy.—Take Black Geans or Black Morellos— but remember that the former are sweet, the latter acid and bitter, and there will be a great difference in the results. They must not be over-ripe. Take off the stalks, and if you choose prick them with a pin. Fill a bottle with them three-quarters, pcur in brandy to the neck, cork it up. It will be ready in a month. Compote of Cherries.—White Hearts boiled in syrup for three minutes. Sometimes a little noyau is put into the syrup when ready to' serve. Chestnuts.—If the truth were known, many persons would confess that chestnuts never look so tempting as when they are seen at the corner of a street on the rude baking contrivance of a vagabond roaster. If they only had the courage to do so in the face of day, they would gladly stop to buy a pennyworth and consent to pay a shilling. Nobody has been known to feel in the same way to boiled chestnuts, unless it be the Portuguese, and those who have learnt their style, which is to top them (that is, nip off their points) and to boil them with anise-seed—half an ounce to fifty chestnuts.

Spinach 446 had two slices of ham ; and grew into such favour that it seemed to eclipse all the other brown sauces, and to be worthy of the most lavish adornment. In later days, when this system of adornment was at its height, one of the receipts for it already quoted begins with the direction, “ Take twelve ducks, a ham, two bottles of old Madeira, and six pounds of fine truffles.” While the ham was the chief thing in the sauce, there was a reason for calling it Spanish, which will be found in the general article on Sauces. But gradually the influence of the ham has been diminishing. The share of it allowed to Spanish sauce is allowed to other sauces, and the quantity has been so much reduced in proportion to beef and veal, that it is doubtful whether it has any effect worth aiming at. .Spanish sauce has no longer a Spanish characteristic—save its brown- ness ; and at last a great cook (Gouffe) has been bold enough to strike the ham wholly out of the sauce, which is in his receipt but a good gravy of beef and veal finished with roux. Follow the receipt (pp. 225, 226) for making beef or veal gravy, but use beef and veal together in the pro- portion of one to three, and moisten them with broth instead of water, in both the small quantity required for producing the glaze in the first part of the process, and the larger quantity for simmering in the second. When the juice is fairly extracted from the meat, it is to be strained; it is to be thickened with roux; it is to be raised to boiling point and reduced to a cullis by simmering on the angle of the stove; it is to be skimmed well and freed from grease; and it is last of all to be strained again through a tammy. Spinach requires to be well washed and picked. If young and tender, it requires but little water to boil it little more than the moisture which adheres to it after washing. If ripe and strong' of leaf, more water is needed —but still not much. The water should be boiling, some

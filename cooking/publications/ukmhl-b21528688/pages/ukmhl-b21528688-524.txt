Zootje 500 for this, but for very nothingness. Zest! Fiddlesticks ! It has been stated, and it ought to be true if it is not, that a German author has written a great book on the zest of an orange—the all and the nothing. Zootje—a Dutch word as near as possible in root and in meaning to the English Seethed. All honour to the inhabitants of sea and river that can afford to make our acquaintance not dressed in the royal robes of curious sauces, but in the naked simplicity of the bath in which they have swum over the fire! Their advent at our tables in a vehicle of water is so creditable to them, and so unusual, that it is always signalised in the name of Waterzootje. FINIS.

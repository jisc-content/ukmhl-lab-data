45i Supreme good, and the lovers of caviare are more general than Shakespeare kne.w. Sugar.—Every child understands the use of sugar in sweet dishes; but the part which it plays in dishes which are not recognised as sweet is not too clearly taught. There was a time, centuries ago, when soups and sauces were loaded with syrup, and when there was a kind of proverb that sugar in a dish was never a fault. The vast majority of cooks nowadays never clearly realise that in one form or another there must be sugar in all their soups and sauces. Not only will a pinch of sugar or a little caramel at the last make all the difference between a good and a bad soup or sauce—but those vegetables, carrots, turnips, parsnips, onions, celery and the rest, which go for so much towards the goodness of soups and sauces—what are they but so many reservoirs of finely-flavoured sugar? Always the cook has to calculate whether the vegetables which he puts into his messes are sufficiently saccharine ; and if they are not sufficiently saccharine, he has to make up for it by so many grains of palpable sugar. Take this, therefore, for a maxim—that the vegetable basket is the sugar-basin of the saucemaker. Supreme.—The supreme of a fowl or chicken is what is supposed to be the best part of it—the fillets. But we also hear of a Supreme sauce. Is there such a thing—as distinct from a Fricassee sauce or an Allemande? The fact is, that cooks are not agreed as to how they shall name the chief white sauces. They are three. The chief of all is Velvet-down. Then there is Bechamel, which is half velvet- down, half cream. The third is named by some (Dubois and Bernard) Supreme; by others, and the greater number, Allemande. If any of these sauces may be called Supreme, it should, by rights, be Velvet-down, which stands at the head of the list.

It is odd to see the variety and quaintness of the terms which, in the numerous receipts for mawmene, and in others of the same character not yet mentioned, are used to enjoin first the roasting or half-roasting- of the fowl, and then the shredding and mincing of it. 1 he receipts vary in their names, and have a crowd of varying ingredients, but they agree in this— that they are all such a confused and nonsensical jumble of innumerable incongruous elements, solid and liquid, animal and vegetable, sour and sweet, hot and bitter, growing at home and fetched from over the seas, as we still understand by gallimawfrey and galimatias; that it is exceedingly difficult to distinguish one from another—this one with a score of flavours and garnitures, but wanting perhaps the galingale or the vinegar, from that other with nearly the same score, but wanting the milk or the sugar; and that in one and all the fowl is pulled to pieces to be either chopped or brayed in a mortar. The constant refrain is this : “ Take brawn [that is, flesh] of capons y-teased, or of pheasants teased small “Take the chese [that is, the chopper, from which we have the diminutive chisel] and of flesh of capons or of hens hack small in a mortar;” “Take brawn of hens or of capon and hew them small as thou may;” “Take the thighs or the flesh of capons, skin them and carve them small. ” This invariable rule has found expression in the final syllables of mawmene, mawfrey, matias, magundi, and malachi.

Magundi, or, as the French spell it, migondis, is to the like effect, though not expressed in a form which will so readily catch the modern ear. The earliest known form of the word is in the Sanscrit khnnd,

Haddock 230 times called cuckoo for the same reason. The ancients called him a lyre, and supposed him to be under the special protection of Apollo. Those who eat him can make a guess what flying fish is like—for the flying fish, beloved of poets, is a gurnard. So also are sticklebacks, which engaged the philosophical mind of Mr. Pickwick. Stuff him with veal stuffing, and boil him or bake him. But first banish his fins. DDOCK is called by the French aigrefin—- a sharper, an impostor. It is a very good fish notwithstanding. It has two black spots, one on each shoulder, which are said to be the mark of St. Peter’s finger and thumb when he took the tribute-money out of its mouth. People do not adorn a bad fish with these fine legends. Some of the best haddocks come to London from Devonshire and Cornwall; and the Dublin Bay ones are famous. They are very good boiled with plain English butter-sauce; but still better baked, having first been stuffed with oyster forcemeat or with veal stuffing. Also a haddock makes one of the best of curries. But the Scotch are the greatest masters of the haddock. It is their fish par excellence. They have their Loch Fyne herring, it is true—but it has rivals in the Yar- mouth bloater and the Dutch herring. There is nothing, however, in the way of haddock that can approach the Rizzared haddock and the Finnan haddock of the Scotch. Nobody who has not been to Scotland in the winter time, or who has not deeply studied the Scotch books, can imagine to what heights of glory a simple haddock can leap up. There will always be doubts about the haggis or a singed sheep’s head, but the Scottish treatment of haddock is incontrovertible.

81 Bouchees Crayfish a la Borclelaise are a passion with some people, especially in the season when game fails. They take the place of game towards the end of dinner. Chop a faggot of Mirepoix fine, pass it in butter, and add a tumblerful of white wine to it. Boil it up, put the crayfish into it alive; they are soon dead and red, although to' be thoroughly cooked they must be tossed for at least twenty minutes. When done, pile them in a noble monument on the dish; take the sauce, finish it with a little fresh butter, and pour it fondly on the monument you have raised. Given the crayfish, there comes a terrible question,— How are they to be got at? how are they to be eaten? Prigs and foolish virgins are aghast to find that knives and forks are of no use. Then comes a moment of great trial to weak nerves. What becomes of our boasted civilisation when it is known that the crayfish are to be boldly eaten with the fingers, and that when the dish is consumed finger-glasses go round? Botargo—Roe of the Grey Mullet. Bouchees—Morsels.—These are small \ ol-au-vents, and the way to make them is described under that heading. They are filled with a salpicon of chicken, game or fish, well moistened with a white sauce-—Bechamel or Ahe- rn ande. Bouchdes a la Reine.—Filled with a salpicon of chicken, —that is, a fine mince of chicken with tongue, mushrooms and truffles. The queen after whom they are named was Marie Lesczinska, the wife of Louis XV., who' gave the French cooks their idea of the Baba or Polish cake and the Kromeski or Polish croquette. Bouchees of game in the same way. Bouchees of lobsters or of shrimps are filled with either of these cut small, but not mixed with anything else save the white sauce. G

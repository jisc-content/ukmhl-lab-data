471 Veal a roasting- heat in some form or other is brought to bear upon it; and no receipt shall here be given for boiled veal. The same interdict applies to stewed veal, except in those cases when, as in brazing, the process of stewing can be combined with that of roasting. In the list of stews which follow, the veal is part baked, fried, or in some way roasted.

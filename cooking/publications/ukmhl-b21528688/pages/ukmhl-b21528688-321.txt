The Lady Mayonnaise 297 resort to conjecture; and their conjecture is that the ex- planation which was least regarded in the beginning of the century may after all be right—Mahonnaise, in honour of the siege of Mahon. Littre and others give this now as the probable but not certain origin of the word. There is a great difficulty, however, in the way of accepting it—a difficulty which the lexicographers would have seen clearly if they had not thought it beneath them to pay much attention to the very curious literature of the French kitchen. The capture of Mahon was effected in 1726, and there is no other known instance at that period, or for long after it, of a dish or dainty being named after a victory. Dishes were named after the places where they were invented, the races who partook of them, or the great nobles who patronised them. It was not till the battle of Marengo—seventy-four years after the fall of Mahon— that the field of a great victory gave its name by a mere accident to a dish; the chicken a la Marengo. To guess, therefore, that Mahonnaise comes from the siege of Mahon is to antedate enormously a modern phantasy; and further- more to assume an exceptional phraseology, when the analogy of a la Marengo would lead one to expect a la Mahon as the name for a sauce which does not properly belong to Mahon and has only an honorary connection with it. What then is the true word—Mayonnaise, Bayonnaise, Magnonnaise or Mahonnaise? I am about to maintain that the last of these spellings, now adopted by the chief authorities, is the most correct—that is, nearest to the original; but to suggest a different explanation for it. The fact is that though Careme made a great mistake in working out his explanation, he is entitled to more atten- tion that he has received in his statement as to the tradition of the kitchen. He does not say absolutely, but he leaves it to be understood, that in his culinary circle the name of the sauce was everywhere supposed to bear special

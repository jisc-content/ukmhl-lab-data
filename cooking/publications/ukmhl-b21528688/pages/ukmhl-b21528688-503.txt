479 Venison Venetian Sauce.—This is an utterly useless name; but it sometimes occurs and must be explained. It is difficult to say wherein it differs from tbe Poulette sauce, and we have seen that the Poulette sauce differs little from Alle- inande or German sauce. The Venetian may be described as an Allemande made verdant with chopped parsley—to remind one of the green slime of the lagoons. Venison is one of the commonest of meats in Paris; but then it is roebuck venison, which is of small account in England. Nobody who can command Southdown or Scotch mutton in this country will ever condescend to roebuck, a leg of which has to be larded before it has any value. It is a common remark in England, indeed, that good mutton, if it can be had four or five years old, is equal and more than equal to the only venison which is prized here—that of the fallow deer, cultivated in parks. Even of this fallow deer, the doe has no repute, and it is only the buck, while it is in season, from June of Michael- mas, that attracts the regard of a connoisseur. The red deer of the Scottish Highlands is, in honour of its prowess, eaten with rejoicing by those who stalk it; but it is coarse of texture, rank of flavour, and not to be compared with the fallow deer. Let the sportsman sing— My heart's in the Highlands, my heart is not here, My heart’s in the Highlands a-chasing the deer; A-chasing the deer and following the roe— My heart’s in the Highlands wherever I go : but for the pleasure of the table give us neither a haunch of the red deer from Scotland, nor a Parisian mess of chevreuil—but English park venison ; and for any useful purpose that is all we need consider now. Haunch of Venison.—It is one of the immutable laws of gastronomy that if a haunch (also a shoulder or a neck) of venison is not fat, it is not worth the trouble of roasting;

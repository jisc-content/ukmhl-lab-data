307 Mussels of the most exquisite flavour. I have seen people with their eyes shut eat mushrooms-—a variety which the French call ceps—and heard them declare that they were eating- flesh. Of the enormous value of the mushroom in sauces and ragouts the reader has seen ample proof in the course of these pages. For the treatment of mushrooms by themselves there are two leading receipts. Stewed Mushrooms.—These are the Mushrooms & l’oli- vier invented by La Varenne, and since developed into the Duxelles. See Duxelles; and see also Truffles & l’ltali- enne, which is but another form of the same receipt with the substitution of truffles for mushrooms. Grilled Mushrooms.-— Peppered, salted, buttered and grilled. When, in addition to this, they are served with a sauce of oil or melted butter, to which parsley, young onions and garlic (all chopped) are added, together with the juice of a lemon, they are called Mushrooms k la Bordelaise. Mussels are the oysters of the poor, said Grimod de la Reyniere, and they ought to be favoured also by the rich, for there is scarcely a shell-fish which surpasses them in flavour. Especially in these days, when oysters are dear, mussels might occasionally take their place in sauces and stews. The French are wise, for they still hold the mussel in regard—it is one of the chief attractions of that noble ragout, the Normandy Matelote. In England—be it said with shame—the mussel is chiefly used for bait; it is rarely to be seen at any good English table—it is only in houses where the French style of cookery reigns that it is to be had.

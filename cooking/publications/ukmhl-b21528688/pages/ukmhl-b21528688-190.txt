Eel 166 mixed spices finely pounded. Roll it up, collar it with tape, and boil it in salt and water. Serve it with a sharp sauce—or say English sauce with plenty of lemon-juice. Spitchcock.—The name for a broiled eel; though it might be applied to anything else done in the same way. The word is so corrupt that it has come to be used ignorantly. It is a corruption of spitstuck, and is equi- valent to the French en brochette. Anything done en brochette, or on a skewer, might be called spitstuck or spitchcock. It is really broiled; and the following is the receipt for broiled eels.

But whether thus impaled or not, they are to be broiled on or before a clear fire to a light-brown tint. Eels may thus, too, be broiled whole, or they may be roasted in a Dutch oven. Let them be sent to< table gar- nished with parsley fried crisp, and with a sauceboat of English butter-sauce sharpened with lemon-juice. Fried, Eels, or Eels a la Tartare.—Cut the eels in pieces three or four inches long, and let them cook for .twenty minutes in a Mirepoix of red wine; let them also cool in the liquor, which ought to> be nearly a jelly when cold. Take out the pieces, and roll them in fine breadcrumbs, dip them in two or three yolks of eggs which have been beaten up in the liquor. Roll them again in the bread- crumbs, and fry them. Serve them with Tartar sauce. The English way is much more simple. If they are to be

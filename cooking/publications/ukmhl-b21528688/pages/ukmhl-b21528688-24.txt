No! Kettner’s Book of the Table must be republished, and it is. But it is time to bring this preface to a close, otherwise some ill-natured person might perhaps harbour a vague sus- picion that there was an intention to praise the work ; than which, needless to say, there is nothing further from our minds. We shall therefore now conclude by saying to the reader, and to all those for whose benefit Kettner s Book of the Table is now republished, “ May good digestion wait on appetite And health on both." November, 1912.

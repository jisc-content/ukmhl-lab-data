It is to- be spread on toast, with a squeeze of lemon; Cayenne Pepper would be much better called Red pepper, for it does not come exclusively from Cayenne. It is the powder of the dried pods and seeds of the cap- sicum. The name of Chillies is a Mexican name for the pods. Celery and Celeriac are cultivated varieties of a wild plant common enough in England—smallage. It was the Italian gardeners who- educated smallage into celery, and brought it into European notice towards the middle of the seventeenth century. Celeriac came about the same time —its distinction being that whereas in celery the gardeners brought the stalks to perfection, in celeriac they spent their skill upon the root. Unfortunately celeriac, though on the Continent much in favour, is little known in England ; yet in some respects it is more useful than celery', being reared with greater ease and at less expense, being also- fit for use during eight months of the year. The name of celery is derived from the Greek for parsley; and it is curious that celeri-ac contains the Latin name (apium) added to the Greek. Ac is to be identified with the French ache, and with the final syllable of smallage; and all three arc transmutable into apium on the same principle that the Scottish Mac and the Welsh Ap are dialectical varieties of one and the same word. Celery is most seen at table in England raw, to be eaten with cheese or sometimes in salad; but its presence at (able is felt in other ways, lor like parsley it is in constant demand for pot and pan to heighten soup and sauce. Also it makes a soup of itself; it makes a sauce of itsell ; it is excellent plain boiled, as sea-kale; it will stew to perfec- tion ; and it makes a salad which is not only good in itself,

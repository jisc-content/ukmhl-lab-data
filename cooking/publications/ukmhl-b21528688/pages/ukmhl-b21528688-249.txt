Gravy 225 sauce. Some one has said that hot ham should never be eaten at all; but certainly, if eaten, or if worth eating, it needs no sauce—unless on rare occasions it may be a spoon- ful of champagne. But to have the slice of good ham covered with a thick sauce, which is partly made from ham, is atrocious. Also, as a rule, it is wickedness to drench roast game with sauce. Sydney Smith says, in describing a dinner at which he was present: “ I heard a lady who sat next me say in a low, sweet voice—‘ No gravy, sir ! ’ I had never seen her before, but I turned suddenly round and said, ‘ Madam I have been looking for a person who disliked gravy all my life; let us swear eternal friend- ship.’ She looked astonished, but took the oath, and what is better, kept it. ” Its own Gravy.—The gravy which is served in England with roast meat is too often a mockery. While the sirloin is turning before the fire, the cook takes a boatful of boil- ing water, which she colours with caramel and seasons with salt. She pours this gradually over the sirloin, she catches it again in a dish below, takes off the fat; and that is what she calls “ its own gravy.” There is none of the juice of meat in it save what may afterwards ooze out from the beef when it is placed on the dish and begins to contract by cooling. It is not merely in small and stingy households that this is done. It is common enough in very good houses ; and there is probably not a regimental mess in the kingdom that is not served to gravy with the roast joint in the same way. I have seen the cook of a crack regiment take about a gallon of boiling water, and with it water several magnificent roasts, to provide gravy for the most brilliant set of officers in the British service.

Introduction o for cooks to provide appropriate sauces. The most appropriate sauce for cold meat is a jelly, or half jelly, of some sort; and the French have invented one jellied sauce to go with cold viands—aspic. It is not to be supposed that one and the styne sauce will suit every meat alike, every taste alike, or even the same taste at different times. We cannot take the same everlasting aspic with cold meat all the year round. But the cookery books, with scarcely an exception, give one single receipt for savoury jelly, and they call it aspic, though it does not contain a particle of aspic in it. What aspic is will be explained in its proper place. Here it must be enough to point out that, be it what it may, it is absurd to use this one precious jelly with a false name, morning, noon, and night, and all the year through, with fish, flesh, and fowl, in season and out of season. Francatelli —and he may be taken as a type of all the great French cooks—gives a most elaborate receipt for aspic jelly; and he is so satisfied with it that, having to prepare a cold supper for 300 people, he works it up in every one of his fifty-six dishes which are not sweet nor hot. At the end of his great work, now in its twenty-third edition, and of such authority that many of the best people swear by it, he gives a great many bills of fare which are set forth as models for imitation. Most of these are for hot dinners; but in two of them he shows what modern cookery can do in the way of a cold refection. It will be enough to quote his bill for the cold viands of his supper: — Ball Supper for 300 Persons—Summer. 8 Grosses Pieces on ornamental stands. 2 Raised pies of fowls and ham with truffles, garnished with aspic jelly. 2 Galantines of poulards, with aspic jelly. 2 Hams ornamented with as- pic jelly. 2 Boars’ heads ornamented with aspic jelly.

Sauce 411 this point slay to inquire how the juices of meat are obtained so as to make the one brown and the other white : it must be enough to say that the one is called Espagnole or Spanish sauce, the other Veloute or Velvet-down; and to dwell for a moment on this odd fact—that whereas in cookery a brown sauce is used about three times as often as a white one, the French cooks recognise only one form of the more frequent sauce, and as many as three forms of the less frequent. Brown sauce is always what they are pleased to call Spanish; and white sauce, or Velvet-down, has two variations, which are known as Bechamel and Allemande or German. If it is curious that of the four parent sauces or gravies of the French kitchen there should be but a single brown to three white ones, it is still more so, when we consider it closely, that the one brown sauce should be called Spanish. The fact is, that the traditions of the french kitchen have been muddled and forgotten. Spanish was 01 iginally but a variation of an older brown sauce which flourished in f ranee long before Spanish tastes began to prevail, and which was afterwards forgotten,— much as if, among the white sauces, Bechamel should survive, and Velvet-down, from which it springs, should be heard of no more. Let us ask—for everything turns on this—why is the sauce called Spanish? Ihere are people who imagine that it means no more than brown. I here is a hue which goes by the name of Spanish brown : the great Spanish painter, Murillo, loved it well, and made it by roasting the bones which his countrymen boiled down in their stews.

It is not necessary to run away from this view, it is natural; but it is not enough. People do not change the name of an established preparation with-

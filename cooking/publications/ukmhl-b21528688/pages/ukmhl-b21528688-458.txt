434 Sonbise a log- of pinewood, provide us with a small vial of odorous pyroligneous essence which a cook in the time of Louis XIV. could not obtain without the decoction of fifty hams. A cook is after all a chemist, and in those days the chemis- try of the kitchen was very cumbrous and expensive. The Soubise sauce intended for mutton will be found below; but it may be doubted whether one Englishman in a million who enjoys his mutton cutlet a la Soubise dreams of what it ought to be as imagined by the great chef Bertrand, and as accepted by the Prince of Soubise. It has already been said that Bertrand was an enthusiastic believer in ham and bacon. The chief article of his worship was fumigated pig, and his notion of mutton was that it should always be intersected with bacon. Take a neck of mutton, trim it, parboil it, cut it into thick cutlets, lard them well with plugs of bacon, broil them, and serve them with a white pur^e of onions. Ditto for the shoulder of mutton. Englishmen are of course scandalised at the idea of larding good mutton; and accordingly they discard everything from Bertrand’s receipt but the Soubise sauce. They are quite right; but at the same time it is not difficult to guess at the explanation of Bertrand’s proceedings. They probably grew out of the carbonade. A carbonade of mutton is cold underdone mutton, scored and slashed and sent to the grill. Bertrand had to do a carbonade one day, and felt that the mutton already cooked would be dried up on the grill. He tried to prevent this by interlacing it with bacon; and the result of the broil was so satisfactory to him and to his master that henceforth he took to parboiling' his mutton for the express purpose of larding' it first and then carbonading it.

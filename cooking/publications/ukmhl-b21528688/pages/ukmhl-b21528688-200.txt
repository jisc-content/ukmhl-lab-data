176 Entrees little roast. But in France, the word Roast has a wider signification than in England—it includes a Friture. Frying is indeed but a mode of roasting, and it would be orthodox in France, though not too common, to begin the second course with a fried fish. If a choice of several roasts were offered, one of them might well be a fried fish, and the list of roasts in France would include a baked haddock, an eel from the spit, and all manner of pies. Try and imagine the countenance of an Englishman aghast at the sight of fried gudgeons offered to him for a roast at the commencement of the second course. And yet—for all depends on the previous selection—fried gudgeons may at this point of the dinner be perfectly artistic. There is truly no reason in the Englishman’s hard-and-fast rule of eating fried gudgeons only at the beginning of dinner. It is to be presumed that when the second course has come most persons want only to nibble : and the French service of the dinner keeps this wish clearly in view and ministers to it. The roast to begin with is not too solid, and the entremets in succes- sion are 'as light as possible, confined for the most part to vegetable dishes, delicate pastry, eggs, cakes, creams, tarts, and sweets. By way of example, take the minutes of two of Careme’s dinners—the first for February', the second for November. Fevrier : Menu de six k neuf couverts.

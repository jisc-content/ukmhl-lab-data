Meringues 302 not one of which is satisfactory. I therefore venture to make a conjecture. It wants but one little fact, which may hereafter be found, to raise the conjecture into a demonstration. The chief point to be observed is that a meringue is white of egg worked into shape. It is therefore in the first instance to be presumed that the name means white of egg, or simply white. The fact which I have failed to find, and which if found would be decisive, is that merin- gue means white; but there are other facts which distinctly point that way. First of all, look at some parallels in the English language. We have white, white of egg, whiting the fish, and whiting the chalk. Now, in French the name for a whiting is merlan, in old French, merlenc and mellenc. In French, also, the name for white clay is marne, formerly merle and marie. Is it not a fair infer- ence that, as in English whiting the fish and whiting the chalk are connected with the root white, so in French merlan the fish and marne the chalk are equally con- nected with a root meaning white, which would also yield meringue for the white of egg? There is something to confirm this view in the Latin language. The French marne (in the old form and in the English language marie) comes from the Low Latin margila, a diminutive of marga. But it has already been shown in these pages (see Gallimawfrey) how easy it is in various languages to drop the initial m. The Mac of the Gael becomes the Ap of the Welsh. The monos of the Greeks becomes the anus of the Latins. Seize this fact thoroughly, and it will be understood that the Low Latin margila is a doublet of the classical Latin argilla; and we know that argilla must be traced back to argos, white. If, therefore, argilla had a dialectical variety—margila, it may reasonably be inferred that argos had also a dialectical variety—margos, which would have the meaning of white, and contain the germ of meringue, as something white.

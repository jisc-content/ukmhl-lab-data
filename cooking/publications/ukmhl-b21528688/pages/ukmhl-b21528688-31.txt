Introduction 7 cooking- it. It is so thick that by the ordinary method it might be burnt on the surface when quite raw inside; and therefore—though the new method is neglected and is even forgotten very much—it was put upon the fire between two other slices of beef, which, if burnt upon the grill, could be thrown away. It may still be asked, what has this to do with Chateaubriand, that his name should be attached to a steak so prepared ? Here we come into a region of culpable levity. Chateaubriand published his most famous work under the name of Lc Genie du Christianisme. The profane wits of the kitchen thought that a good steak sent to the fire between two malefactor steaks was a fair parody of the Genie du Christianisme. If I remember rightly it was at Champeaux in the Place de la Bourse that this eccentric idea took form and burst upon Paris. As to the amount of sense or of folly displayed in the selection of a name, it is needless to say a word; as to the good sense of the mode of cooking the steak, judgment is pronounced in the fact that, though the Chateaubriand still remains as thick as ever, it is rare now to see it grilled between two other steaks—that being too extravagant. Indeed, in Gouffe’s great works on cookery, which must always be mentioned with respect for the good sense and good taste which pervade it, there is not a hint given that the Chateaubriand is to be cooked, or was ever cooked, between the two robber steaks. Most cookery books say not one word of the Chateaubriand, which ranks now as the prime steak of the French table, and which appears in Parisian dinner bills to bewilder the benighted Eng- lishman with a magnificent but unintelligible name. It is scarcely worth while to speak of minor follies. When we find in the most popular cookery books of France that roast mutton and lamb are designated Rosbif de mouton, and Rosbif d’agneau, we recognise that no great harm is done, and only laugh at the awkwardness

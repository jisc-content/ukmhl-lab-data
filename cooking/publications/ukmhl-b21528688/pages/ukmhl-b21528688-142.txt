Chicken 118 Chicken Broth will be found described as Fowl Broth in the article on Soup- Add to it rice and finely chopped parsley. The Queen’s Chicken Broth (Potage a la Reine)—the queen being Marguerite of Valois. This was in the old receipt, and in the style of the sixteenth century—a fowl or fowls half-roasted first, then boiled, then boned, the flesh hacked to pieces, brayed in a mortar with rice, and diluted with milk or cream of almonds. It was a sort of blancmanger as then made, but without sugar. Modern taste will hardly now tolerate the almond milk in soup— not because it is in any way bad, but because the palate is curiously dependent on habit and association, and almonds are associated with luscious preparations overpowered with sugar, which are not to be thought of at the beginning of dinner. But whoever wishes for the true chicken broth of Queen Margaret can always add to it almond milk or cream. As for half-roasting the fowls first, that was very common in the olden time, and the roast flavour thus pro- duced was deemed essential to fowl in almost all its forms. In modern cookery it is a principle that white soup should be white, and that it loses its character, ceasing to be white, when the roast flavour proper toi brown cookery is, however slightly, added to it. In the present day, the Queen’s chicken soup is to> be made with a couple of chickens boiled for an hour in a gallon of beef broth, veal broth, or in simple water, with a sparing supply of vegetables—two carrots and two onions. The broth is then to be strained and freed from fat; the chickens are to be skinned, boned, their flesh (picked clear of fat) to be chopped and brayed in a mortar with half a pound of boiled rice; after which the mash of chicken and rice is to be added to the strained broth, and all passed through a tammy. Warm it up, and add to' it nearly a pint of hot cream, which, according to the old receipt, should partly at least be almond cream.

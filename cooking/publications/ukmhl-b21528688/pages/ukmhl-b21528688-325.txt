Meringues 3oi Melon.—Try a slice of melon as an adjunct to any fish eaten with a cruet sauce. Melted Butter is a correct name for that which has been described as the one English sauce; but it is not distinctive enough, inasmuch as there are other melted butters. The french call it White Sauce, which again is correct but not distinctive. It is best to accept as a compliment the name which was meant as a reproach, and to call it the English Sauce.

Menu.—Why will Englishmen always describe the minute of a dinner as the menu? Why do they not speak of a receipt as a re?u? Surely it is impossible to get a better word than the English minute or minutes. Meringues are made with a batter composed of white °f egg and sugar, in the proportion of ten whites to a pound of sugar. Whip the whites into a firm froth, mix in the sugar, and then arrange spoonfuls of the batter in egg-shape upon sheets of paper. Next sprinkle some coarsely sifted sugar over them, leave them alone for a couple of minutes, and then shake off the loose sugar. Place the sheets ol paper on baking-boards, and put them into a slack oven till the meringues take a light-buff tinge. Take them out again, and with a dessert-spoon scoop out the insides, taking care not to alter the shape of the meringues. After this put them again into the oven to dry, but care must be taken not to deepen the colour. Fill the meringues with whipt cream or iced cream ; join them together two-and-two, and pile them upon a napkin. It is apparently not known why they are called merin- gues. There are several curious explanations of the name,

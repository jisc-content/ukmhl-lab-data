238 Haricot in thick slices, three moderate-sized mild onions, three blades of mace, a faggot of thyme, sweet marjoram, and parsley, and about three quarts of good beef stock. Let it stew very gently for full two hours from the time of its first beginning to boil, and more if the hare be old. Strain the soup, and pound together very fine the slices of ham and all the flesh of the back, legs, and shoulders of the hare, and put this meat into a stewpan with the liquor in which it was boiled, the crumb of two French rolls, and half a pint of port wine. Set it on the stove to simmer twenty minutes; then rub it through a sieve, place it again on the stove till very hot, but do not let it boil; season it with salt and cayenne, and send it to table directly. ” Haricot is a word which in French means two dif- ferent things—a savoury stew and a kidney-bean.

The explana- tion is really very simple and lies on the surface; but the French have an old reputation for loving far-fetched etymologies, and they would be untrue to themselves if they did not lose themselves in endless subtleties to unravel the mystery of the haricot. In the seventeenth century Menage proved clearly that the word might come from the Latin name for a bean—fcibci, which might beget jcibarius, which might beget jabciricotus, which might beget faricotus, which might beget hciricotus. Unhappily there was no authority whatever for the intermediate links of the genealogical chain leading from fciba to haricot. And, still worse, the name of haricot as a stew was in existence for 300 years before any one thought of giving the same name to the bean. In presence of this fact the French philologers of our day have been driven to a new expla- nation. It has been invented by M. Genin, and it has

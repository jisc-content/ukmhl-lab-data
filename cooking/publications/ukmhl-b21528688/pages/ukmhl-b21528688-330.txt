306 Moisten sauces run upon gammon. More about this ham infatua- tion when we come to discuss the theory of the sauces. Moisten.—A mild word to be understood in the sense of Mrs. Gamp, who wished to have the gin-bottle near her on the chimney-piece in order that she might moisten her lips when so dispoged. To moisten is to put upon meat in a stewpan as much liquid—be it water or broth—as will stew it. Mullagatawny has been already discussed in the article on Gallimawfrey.

Their varieties are inlinite; and there is yearly an immense waste of them, through our inability to discern between the edible and the poisonous ones. Professor Schiff has de- monstrated that the non-edible mushrooms have a common poison, muscarina, and that its effects are counteracted either by atropine or daturine. Italian apothecaries now keep these alkaloids in the rural districts where the con- sumption of the non-edible fungi is apt to occur. Those mushrooms which are edible are full of nourishment and

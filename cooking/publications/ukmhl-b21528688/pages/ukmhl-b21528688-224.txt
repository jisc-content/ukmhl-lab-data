200 Gallimawfrey Street, Leicester Square, and buy it. The terrines which are sold in the shops under the name of Yorkshire pies are not Yorkshire pies, but galantines in pots. Buy them if you have not near you—worthy namesake and rival of the great Alexander—a Dumas who can make a romance out of the breast of a turkey, and a scene out of the merry- thought of a chicken, raise a pheasant into a personage, put wit into a pistachio, and endue a truffle with the soul of poetry. Gallimawfrey or Galimafre, and Galimatias.—I" or several hundred years these words have defied the learning of Europe, and so completely that not only has every etymologist, great and small, given them up in despair, but furthermore—the last theory concerning them, uttered by a competent scholar, Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood, is virtually that they are nothing but gabble to signify gabble. It may therefore seem hardy for any one to pretend at this time of day to have solved the riddle. But the fact is that the solution has hitherto been withheld, for the simple reason that the literary world has not deemed cookery books worthy of much notice. Perhaps the unsafest of all guides to take in searching for an etymon would be Menage; yet he was quite right, and most persons have felt that he was right, in asserting that there is a connection between Galimafre and Gali- matias. They have the same meaning. It is known that Galimafre or Gallimawfrey was originally a fricassee of fowl, though we hear of it afterwards as a mess of mutton and even of sheep’s head. Galimatias, on the other hand, as far back as we. can trace it, has always passed for a jumble of nonsense; but it has also been connected with fowls through the explanation of it contained in the cock- and-bull story of the lawyer who, having to argue his case of the stolen cock in Latin, blundered it by waxing eloquent over Galli Matthias instead of Gallus Matthiae.

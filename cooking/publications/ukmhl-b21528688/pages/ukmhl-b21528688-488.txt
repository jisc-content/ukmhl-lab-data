Turkey 464 Turbot a la Normande.—The Normandy Matelote of Turbot. It is done precisely as the sole of the same name. Turbot with Cream au Gratin.—Break up some cold turbot, removing the black skin, perhaps also the white. Make it hot in some Bechamel sauce, which is half cream. Arrange fish and sauce upon a dish which will stand the fire. Strew over it some breadcrumbs and some grated Parme- san. Also put round it a border of mashed potatoes. Put it into the oven or before the fire to take a golden tint, and if necessary use the salamander. Turkey.—“ II faut etre deux,” said the Abbd Morellet, “ pour manger une dinde truffee; je ne fais jamais autre- ment. J’en ai une aujourd’hui; nous serons deux, la dinde et moi. ” As it takes nearly two or three pounds of truffles to stuff a turkey well, and as truffles are worth twelve or fifteen shillings a pound, it is not every one who can afford such a luxury. Tire turkey, however, is excellent with much less costly stuffing, as fat forcemeat or chestnuts—see Forcemeats Nos. 5 and 8. . If the turkey is roasted, it must be constantly basted, or it will be very dry. The French nearly always bard it to prevent its drying up. They are also partial to a brazed turkey. Put it into a brazing-pan, with an abundant Mirepoix, made with Madeira as the cooks say — which means Marsala. The boiled turkey is rarely seen out of England. For garnish and sauce, the English seem most to enjoy sausages with a meat gravy or with celery sauce. A roast turkey with a garnish of sausages goes by the name of an Alderman in chains. The French, for sauce and garnish, delight in a Perigueux sauce, and the rich garnish of a Chipolata Ragout. See Relish No. 4. Turn.—To turn vegetables is to cut them into various shapes—as bullets, olives, dice, corks, discs, orange-flakes.

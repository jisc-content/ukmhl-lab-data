Arrowroot is nothing" but starch; and it has the same nutritive value as expressed in chemical symbols, however and wherever it is obtained. It contains, that is to say, in a hundred parts, eighteen of water and eighty-two of starch. This is a great fact for grocers who sell one kind of arrowroot for another. There is absolutely no difference that can as yet be detected in the chemical constitution of the starch in each. There is another difference, however. It is clear to the microscopic eye in the size and form of granules belonging to one starch and to another. Still more, there is a marked difference in the taste and in the digestibility of the different kinds.

Each is a mountain of labour for a mouse of result. 1 he result is not bad, but it is always melancholy to see waste and in art especially the pleasure of it is destroyed when we are made

137 Conde vegetables are added—as peas or asparagus points. The soup is named in honour of the same great French minister of finance who gave his name to the Sole k la Colbert, just described. Coligny.—The great Admiral. There truly was a man with an appetite. He ate his toothpicks : we are not told, however, what his toothpicks were composed of. There was a time when they were made of fennel root and ap- peared at table making porcupines of the preserved fruits. To eat fennel root was said to be good for the sight. Collop.-—This word is too plain and too simple for cooks to use. They have transformed it into scollop. Let them read the Bible : it will do them good in many ways. Last and least, it will enlighten them as to* the nature of a collop. (Job xv. 27.) Columbus.—To him the modern table owes more than to any other that can be named. The discovery of America has enriched our tables with the turkey, the canvas-backed duck, the potato, the tomato*, cocoa, vanilla, the Jerusalem artichoke, the sugar-cane, red pepper, and a host of good things. Yet the master-cooks of Europe, who* lavish their honours on nobodies and confuse their cookery books with a mob of ridiculous names, have not thought it worth their while to* consecrate a single dish to his memory—not even the humble egg which he taught his friends to set on end. Cond£.—It is only necessary to note here that this is the fanciful name given to a soup and to a sweet. The soup is a puree of red haricot beans. The sweet is the combina- tion of apricots with rice, more or less elaborated. There is no particular reason why we should cherish the name of Conde. The name of Condi’s castle, Chantilly, is given to Esau’s pottage of lentils. It would be much better to call it Esau’s soup.

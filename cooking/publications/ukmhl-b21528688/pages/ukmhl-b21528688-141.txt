117 Chicken Puree of Chestnuts.—The outer and the inner skins being removed, put fifty chestnuts in a stewpan with a pint of milk, and boil them slowly over the fire till they are quite done. Next drain away the milk and rub them hot through a wire seive. Put the puree thus obtained into a stewpan with a pat of butter, a little sugar, a wine- glassful of cream, pepper and salt. Make it hot without boiling it, and serve it with cutlets, goose, duck, or turkey. Chestnut Soup.—Make the puri-e as above, using broth instead of milk. Add to' it three or four pints of broth, double broth, or good brown gravy. Chestnut Forcement will be found under Forcemeat. Chestnut Pudding.—The only very good one is the Nesselrode; but that is superb, and is described under its name. Chicken.—There are many fine but rather useless dis- tinctions made among fowls, according to their age and quality. There is the infant,—the spring chicken, or poulet a la Reine; the boy pullet, or poulet de grain; the young gentleman, or coq vierge; the young lady, or poularde; the capon, the hen, and the old cock. Among these the poulette, or girl chick, is rarely, if ever, men- tioned ; but her name is given to the Poulette sauce, which is always much favoured with boiled fowls of every descrip- tion, with many other kinds of white meat, and with fish. Her brother the pullet, or poulet, gives his name to most of the preparations of fowl, young or old, male or female, ft was to give honour to the pullet that Napoleon fought the battle of Marengo ; it is the pullet that is always sup- posed to be immolated in a fricassee; and the name of chicken broth is given by courtesy to the dissolution of the toughest old cock, whose crow has many a year been heard from farm to farm, and almost from shire to shire.

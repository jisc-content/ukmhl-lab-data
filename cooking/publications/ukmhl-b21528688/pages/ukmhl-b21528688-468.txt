444 Soup Let one or more fowls be half-roasted before a brisk fire. Then put them in the pot with a pint or a pint and a half of water for every pound. When the pot boils, skim it, add vegetables and seasoning—carrot, onion, leek, celery, turnip, clove, salt, pepper—and let it simmer for three hours, at the end of which time strain the broth through a napkin, and remove the fat. White Fowl Broth, for use in white soups and sauces, is made in the same way, but without the roasting. The following is an alphabetical list of the soups described in this volume :— Asparagus.

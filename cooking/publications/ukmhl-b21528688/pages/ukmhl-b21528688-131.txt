Caviare T°7 innocent liquer, which Sir Wilfrid Lawson himself might drink without a suspicion of the still. Cauliflower is to be had nearly all the year round, and it is at its best in England. The Dutch send to England for their cauliflower seeds, and there was al one time, if there is not still, a considerable export to France of the cauliflowers themselves. They are to be carefully trimmed and (to eject the insects) soaked for some time in cold water and salt. They are then to be boiled in abundance of water with enough of salt for twenty minutes—more or less. The time must be ascertained by pressure. Drain them well, and send them to table with English sauce acidulated with lemon-juice or vinegar. It can be thus served either for a garnish or for an entremet. If for a garnish, the acid should be scarcely perceptible, and the caulifloaver may be a little less cooked than for an entremet.

i 26 Cinnamon tard soup, in which the mustard was a very small part. 1 here was a galantine in which the galingale was as modest as the pistachio is now. And so here the sauce is named lrom the cinnamon, which the French named canelle. Il will be asked, How came the n to be transformed into m ? Jt is especially noted in the English receipt that the canelle —spelt canel—is to be in flour, and the old French name for this must have been canelmine. Large salt, what we call rock salt, was salgrenu or saugrenu (hence our word corned beef); small, fine salt was salmenu or salmine On the same principle they must have said for fine flour of cinnamon canelmine, which was no doubt transposed and corrupted into cameline. The third. There was another sauce known at the Eng- lish court of Richard II. as Cvne, Cynee, Syne, Synee, and Sene. If this was not mustard (sinapis), which was formerly called senvy, the name most probably had to do with cinnamon, which appears sometimes, though not always, in the sauce. Note, however, that in this case the name would be derived not from the first syllable of cinnamon, but from China or Sina. To this day the French know cassia as the Chinese cinnamon; and the name of China in connection with cinnamon goes so far back that three hundred years ago we find Scaliger sneer- ing at those learned men who seemed to confound the name of cinnamon or kinnamon with China or Sina. It is possible, therefore, that here we have the origin of the Cynee or Synee which has so much puzzled antiquarians; and if this conjecture should prove to be correct, then Cynee and Cameline are but varieties of one and the same sauce. The chief objection to the explanation is that cinnamon is not always present in Cynee. On the other hand, the readers of this dictionary will have evidence enough before them of names being retained when that which they signified is no more.

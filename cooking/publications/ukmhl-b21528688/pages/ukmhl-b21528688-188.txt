Eel 164 is altogether satisfactory. The parsley and the shalots, being' each of equal weight with the mushrooms, overlay them and rob them of the importance which La Varenne gave to them. The mushrooms become still further dwarfed in the composition if an equal weight of truffles or truffle trimmings should be added. It would be much better in taste, and more respectful to La Varenne, to reduce the quantity of parsley and shalots. Duxelles Sauce is made by adding Duxelles to about six times as much of Brown or Spanish sauce, and letting it simmer for a little.

The all but universal spread of this species makes its absence from some waters the more remarkable and difficult to explain. Sometimes physical obstructions seem sufficient to account for this,—as for instance for its absence from the lake of Geneva, there being no inlet hitherward up the Rhine : but neither is it found in the Danube, where no such difficulty occurs, and into which, had eels the will, they might easily like other fish find a way.” But eels are mysterious in their ways; and how little we know of therm may be gathered from a single fact—that far and wide as they are spread, and long as they have been loved by the races of mankind, we know next to nothing of their matrimonial arrangements and their

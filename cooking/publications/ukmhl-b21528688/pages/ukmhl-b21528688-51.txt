A Imond 2 7 the receipts, will be found under special heading. Here it must be enough to describe almond cream or milk, and the almond pudding. Almond Milk, Cream, or Paste.—Sweet almonds are brayed in a mortar with a slight sprinkling of bitter ones, and from time to time, to prevent oiling, with a few drops of cold water. According to the quantity of water, this is either a paste, a cream, or milk. Add sugar or syrup to taste. For orgeate, or almond milk to drink, it used to be the rule to let the water and pounded almonds infuse for several hours on cinders or on the angle of the stove. Now it is considered enough to let it rest in a cool place for about a couple of hours. When the flavour of the almonds is extracted, the infusion is to be strained through a napkin, to have a dash of orange-flower water added to it, to be diluted to the thinness of a drink, and to be kept in ice or in a very cold place, lest it should like milk turn sour. It is very refreshing in fever or in hot weather; and is considered especially good for orators and all who have to use the throat much. In his great speech of i860, when he lost his voice, and the country was kept waiting a week for his famous wine budget, Mr. Gladstone might be seen drinking small glassfuls of what had all the appearance of almond cream—though whether it was so or not I cannot say. Almond Cream Sauce.—Blanch an ounce of Jordan almonds and four or five bitter ones. Pound them with four ounces of sugar and a tablespoonful of orange- flower water, and then add a gill of cream and two raw yolks of eggs. Take this to the angle of the stove in a saucepan or enamelled bowl; whisk it into a thickish froth, and it will become a very pretty sauce for puddings. Almond Pudding.—Take half a pound of sweet almonds with half a dozen bitter ones, and having blanched them, bray them to a smooth paste with a little orange-flower water to prevent their oiling.

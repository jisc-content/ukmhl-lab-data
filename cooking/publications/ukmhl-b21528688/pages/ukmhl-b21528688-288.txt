264 Jul icnne produced : Juliolaâ€”little Julia. In France it was natural that there should be a corruption too, but apart from the name of the soup which we are considering we know not what it was. Is it incredible that the word which in England and in some parts of the Continent passed authori- tatively into Lujula, and which was transformed in Calabria into Juliola, became in France fashionable as Julienne? The French philologists may on this hint be able to trace in greater detail the corruption of Alleluia into Julienne; but for the present there is only this much further to be said of it : that the process of corruption which ended in Julienne probably began in Italy and was foreign to France. It is one of the traditions of Julienne that it is distinct from the ordinary French soups; and probably the name as well as the receipt for it came into France with the Italian cooks of Catherine de Medici, who first taught the French the refined and scientific cookery of modern times. They would bring with them from Italy Juliola, or some such corruption, which the French with their wonderful habit of Frenchifying foreign names would transform into Julienne. Let it be observed, too, that in the above statement of the case the argument is put with extreme caution and needless moderation, for it assumes that Juliola is a cor- ruption and that Allelujah is the true name. Now the existence of the name Juliola is known only through Scaliger in his commentary on Theophrastus Dc Causis Plantar urn; and his assertion is that the Calabrian name Juliola is the true word, Alleluia being a barbarous and ridiculous corruption. His very decided statement is entitled to the more weight inasmuch as, being himself named Julius, he may be supposed to have inquired into the name of the plant with a special interest. If, then, Juliola be the true and original word, and not a chance or local corruption, it is all the more natural that it should reappear in French as Julienne.

3i7 Omelet beef in the centre, flanked by the bacon, chicken, and pig’s face. The sausages should be arranged around en couronne. Pour over some of the soup of No. 1, and serve hot.” (Abridged from Ford’s Handbook of Spam.) In spite of Ford’s protest, there is nothing in this receipt which cannot be procured in London. The garbanzos are chick peas, which are to be procured at Francisco Figul’s, 10, Woburn Buildings, Tavistock Square. But surely it is not to be said that the .Spanish Olla depends on the garbanzos, and that no other peas will do. The Chorizos are also to be obtained at the same Spanish shop, which was of old recommended by Ford. In the absence of Chorizos use Frankfort sausages. As for the necessity of an earthen pot—that is a delusion, if the true use of earthenware is understood. See article Soup. Omelet.—It was long supposed that an omelet derived its name somehow from ovum, an egg, and might mean oeufs meles. That etymology has been given up as imprac- ticable by French scholars. It has been reserved for M. J6r6me de Pichon, in his very able edition of the Mdnagier de Paris, to declare that the word takes its rise from lamina, a leaf or thin sheet, whence the Latin diminutive Lamella, in English Lamel. He has not, however, clearly traced out the steps by which we travel from Lamella to Omelette. In the Menagier de Paris, composed about 1390, the name for an omelette is Alumelle, corrupted into Alumette, which yet again appears as Aumelette. If Alumelle comes from Lamella, whence came the initial A? It is strictly in accordance with French law that A1 should contract into Au ; but we have first of all to account for the presence of that initial A. The explanation may come hereafter. All we can vouch for now is that 500 years ago the name for an omelet was written Alumelle, Alumette, and Aumelette. Omelet—plain.—Break six eggs into a bowl, season them

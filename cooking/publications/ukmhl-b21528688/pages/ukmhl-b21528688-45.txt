Albert Pudding' o t the middle ages, and even of the renascence, nursed their dreams of golden transmutations; as there was much talk of the sovereign virtues of the king of metals; and as it was supposed that the grandest of all elixirs must be “ aurum potabile,” the makers of the liqueur deter- mined to justify its name in the most palpable manner. 1 hey put chips of gold-leaf into it; and so there could be no doubt of the fact that to drink acqua d’oro was to diink gold. A change then became necessary in the appeal ance of the liqueur. Gold-leaf would not show m a gold-coloured liquid; and therefore the liquid, which had before been yellow, was rendered colourless, to dis- play the gold better. It is possible that Dantzic may have led the way in perfecting some such change of colour, and may thus have succeeded in giving its name to the liqueui. Its real character, however, was due, as above said, to the Italians, who brought with them into France at least two liqueurs this acqua d’oro, with a predomi- nant flavour of rosemary; and rossolis, with a pre- dominant flavour of sundew. Brillat-Savarin mentions it as a well-known fact that liqueurs were first invented to soothe the old age of Louis XIV.. and on his authority the story has been widely accepted. Any one who thinks for a moment must doubt that it was reserved for so late a period as the old age of Louis XIV. to invent the combination of spirits with highly-perfumed syrups; and the history of acqua d 010 is a positive proof to the contrary.

He has been commemorated in a pudding v hicli is as simple as it is agreeable, which the poor man may enjoy, and which the most opulent and fastidious cannot resist.

Introduction 11 put out of sight the fact that particulars vary every day, in every country, and in every household. The sugar of England is a good deal sweeter than the sugar of France. The salt of France is much more salt than that of Eng- land. The quantities to be used therefore must continu- ally vary. Again, everybody knows that vegetables are not alike in flavour. Some apples are comparatively tasteless; so are some carrots; and one lemon is sharper than another. Therefore in one kitchen a lemon, an apple, or a couple of carrots will go further to flavour a sauce than double the number in another kitchen. Careme praised the beef of England : he said it was perfectly beautiful, tender, delicious to taste, pleasant to behold; but he also said that it wanted the unctuositv of the French beef, and would not lend itself to sauces and rich consommes without using up far more than would be required in France. What does this mean, but that the quantities of beef used for soup in one country will not do for the same soup in another country ? It depends on the butcher. It is the same with ham,â€”the flavour of which is not to be measured by weight. A hundred pounds of French ham will not yield the flavour con- tained in ten pounds of Spanish, German, or English hams. It would be easy to multiply such examples, showing that quantities are deceptive, because they are unintelligible apart from quality. When the reader comes to the article on Soups, he will find that the very highest authorities differ widely on the grand point as to the quantity of water with which beef broth should be made. Some tell us to make it with equal quantities of beef and water; others tell us to us four times as much water as beef. The broth which results varies pro- digiously in strength; so that the simple broth of one cook is often as good as the double broth or consomme of another. Add to this the uncertainty of the heat of fires, on which some flavours greatly depend, and it must

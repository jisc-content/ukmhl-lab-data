3H Noyau turned the martydom and misery of Bloody Mary’s reign to good—it brought about bottled beer. The Dean un- bosomed himself of his great discovery to his clerical friends, and the clergy gradually let it out to the laity. So to one man—a kindly, good old man, fond of fishing, we are indebted for our earliest instruction in heavenly things, and for that bottled beer which nerves the soul to noble deeds. Noyau.—The French claim for themselves the glory of being the first and the best liqueur makers in the world. They are by no means the first in point of time; and so long as we can point to such foreign liqueurs as Acqua d’oro, Maraschino, Kirschenwasser, Curaqoa, and Kummel, it would be hard to allow them the pre-eminence in manu- facture. Noyau, however, is peculiarly their own, and is a good second-rate liqueur. It is made from a combina- tion of white brandy with apricot kernels. Sometimes it is coloured pink. Nut-brown Butter.—See Butter. Nutmeg.—There was scarcely a dish in the olden time which was not flavoured with nutmeg; and Boileau, in his satire, could ask— Aimez vous la muscade ? on en a mis partout. It has been so ridiculed that we have now gone to the other extreme; and it is rarely if ever used, except for sweet dishes. It will no doubt one of these days recover a good deal of the favour it has lost, and we shall not confine ourselves to mace, which is its husk.

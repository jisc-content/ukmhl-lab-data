It may seem incredible, but it is a fact that there are heathens who> do not know what a turbot is, who despise its fin and its skin, who think the thick fleshy part ol it the best, and who naturally, therefore, can see no great difference between brill and turbot.

He gave to> the pleasures of the table a poetry little thought of before, and though his works are in prose lie is to be ranked as one ol the most original of poets. He has himself reported what one of his friends

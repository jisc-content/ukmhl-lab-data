98 Cabbage five or forty minutes, and being drained, it is supposed to have finished its education and to* be fit for table. In this state, however, it is dry and insipid. Be it cabbage, greens, Brussels sprouts, turnip-tops, endive, or lettuce, it should be tossed with butter, pepper, and perhaps nut- meg, before ascending to the dignity of the table. The French way of dressing cabbage is indicated in the English practice of boiling greens to take with boiled beef. These are not boiled with the beef, lest they should impart too much of their flavour to it; but they are boiled with some of the liquor of the beef and with its top fat. The French take cabbages—white ones by preference—cut them into quarters, wash them well, cast them with salt into boiling water, boil them for ten minutes, steep them for half an hour in cold water, press them and dry them well, tie them up, put them into a stewpan with a piece of bacon previously blanched, a faggot of sweet herbs, an onion stuck with two cloves, and pepper, cover them with broth, and so let them cook, till they are tender and thoroughly impregnated with the surrounding juices. Cabbage Soup is much the same as the foregoing; but put into the stewpan, say for each cabbage half a pound of bacon, and half a pound of gravy beef, with half a gallon of water, or even three-quarters; bring it to the boiling point, skim it, and then simmer it for three hours. Finally, cut up the cabbage and serve it in its broth, keeping back the beef, the bacon, and the faggot. Cai.f’s Feet are for the most part boiled in salt and water alone, for the purpose of making sweet Jelly (which sec); or with a faggot of pot-herbs for the purpose of making Aspic (which also see). In either case, after hours of boiling, the feet, which have parted with much of their gelatine, still remain good enough to make a very nice little dish. The best way is to heat them up in a Poulette Relish.

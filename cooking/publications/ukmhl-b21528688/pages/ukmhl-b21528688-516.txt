Widgeon 492 really mean to taste the whiting, he must be either fried or broiled. The French fry him with his skin on, his sides gashed and dusted with flour ; but there is no better way than that common in England, where the little animal is skinned, takes his tail in his mouth to symbolize eternity, and then, after a dainty roll in egg, fine bread- crumb and flour, disports himself in the frying-pan. For broiling him there are two good ways of arranging his toilet. Leave him in his skin, split him down the back, and after dusting him well with flour, put him on the grill.

It may be painful to reflect that the hogs of Montanches which yield the most superb hams are fed on vipers; that ducks dabble in the gutter; that woodcocks live on earthworms; that a whole family of snipes nourish themselves on Father long-legs;

213 Gallimawfrey “ Take brawn of hens or of capons sodden without the skin, and hew them as small as thou may. And grind them in a mortar. After take good milk of almonds and put the brawn therein, and stir it well together and do them to seethe; and take flour of rice and amidon [starch] and alloy it, so that it be chargeant; and do thereto sugar a good plenty, and a plenty of white grease.

Surry was one of the old names for Syria— # They drew up sail of brighte hew, The wind them soon to Surry blew,— and syrup was at one time known as the Syrian juice.

In all the receipts for Blancmanger there is syrup, and here we have a parallel series of receipts for the same thing in which the syrup distinctly enters into the title.

Dariole 153 English language, and it is a pity to see it going out of use because it is not understood. It is much more used in France than in England, but the French authori- ties declare that it is a perfect mystery to them:—its origin utterly unknown. In England it seems to be regarded as a new-fangled French name for a cheesecake, and too foreign as well as too new for common use. It is in fact one of the oldest words in the English language, and is frequently to be found in the cookery books of Chaucer’s time. It means as nearly as possible a maid of honour; and it is curious to imagine how the word dariole should survive for more than five centuries in a kind of lost language, its meaning unknown, and how it should turn up on Richmond Hill correctly translated into maid of honour. The clue to the meaning of the word is given by Junius under the word dairy, the first syllable of which he declares to be identical with the first syllable of Dariole. Now we get puzzled, and have to ask, What is the first syllable, and how do we account for the succeeding ones?

That however is obscure, and we may dismiss it to dwell upon what is clear. We are dealing with one of the most venerable words in human speech, which has been singularly preserved in languages far apart. The English child born in India has

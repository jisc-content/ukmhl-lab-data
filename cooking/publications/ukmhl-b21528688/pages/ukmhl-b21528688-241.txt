217 Geneva has been shown to be hurtful rather than beneficial. . . We now know that the active ingredients of soup are found ready formed in the aqueous infusion of flesh, and are not products of the culinary operations. The gelatine of soup is formed by long boiling of the flesh from the cellular membrane of the muscular tissue. Since these things have been ascertained, the use of gelatine as a nutritive and invigorating substance has been entirely given up; and it only retains a place in the domain of unscientific cookery. The gelatinous soups made in China from the air-bladder of fishes, and in England from the flesh of turtle, are a fertile source of disturbance in the digestive process.” Other experiments prove that though gelatine by itself may have no nutritive value, it serves a good purpose which is not yet understood. There is no gelatine in the blood of animals; there is no gelatine in the milk on which an infant thrives. But there is a curious experi- ment which has yet to be worked out, and which shows that gelatine has its use in food. Bischoff and Voit took a dog weighing 80 lbs.-—and that is a good-sized dog. They fed it on very nearly 18 ounces of meat a day, and at the end of four days the dog- lost a pound weight. They then fed it for three days on the same quantity of meat, to which they added daily seven ounces of gelatine. At the end of the time, not merely had the dog lost nothing in weight, but also it gained four-and-a-half-ounces. Geneva.—This town seems doomed to misrepresentation. It gains credit which does not belong to it, and loses credit which it has nobly won. Because its name resembles that of juniper in Dutch—genever—it is given by many people to gin, with which it has nothing to do. Because it re- sembles that of Genoa it is in danger of losing the credit of an excellent fish sauce which is all its own. Also because in this sauce there is red wine, some cooks using Bordeaux make a variation of it, which they call Sauce

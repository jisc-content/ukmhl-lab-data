The second—that it is always good to (ollow the Continental plan of dividing cooked apples into' two portions : the one to- be cooked longer than the other, and reduced to a mash or marmalade. In a pie, for example, place a mash or marmalade of apples at the bottom of the dish, and heap on this the raw slices, which are to be baked enough, but not so- much as to lose their solidity. Black Caps.—This is the primitive form. When Eve cooked apples for Adam, she must have baked them in their skins. T he form is kept up when its meaning has departed.

We therefore bake them in an oven or in a casserole; and then, to- make believe that we cooked them before the fire, we pass a salamander over them, to produce the primaeval black caps. Some people would imagine that it was time to seek another world il black caps were abolished. They are essential to the existence of the human race. Baked Apples.— 1 he apples are peeled, cored, and arranged on a dish. I lie hollows are filled with sugar and sprinkled with cinnamon. Some sugar may be placed round them, with a spoonful or two or water. They are then baked in the oven. Buttered Apples.—The same as the foregoing, with this difference that the hollows of the apples arc filled with butter as well as sugar; and that, instead of putting water in the dish, there is a mash or marmalade of apples, or it may be ol apricots. Stewed Apples or Compote.—Simmer the apples, peeled and cored, with clarified sugar and lemon-juice; also- a

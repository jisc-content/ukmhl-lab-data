Cod i34 it clean, then quickly dash hot water over the upper side, and with a blunt knife remove the slime which will ooze out, taking- care not to break the skin. Do the same to the other side of the fish; then place it on the drainer, wipe it clean, and plunge it into a fish-kettle of boiling water, with a handful of salt and a half-pint of vinegar. It must be entirely covered, and will take from thirty to' forty minutes’ slow' boiling.

And the lobster added to the oysters is a superfluity. Baked Cod.—This in reality is but a variation of the foregoing, and is known in France as Cabillaud & la St. Menehould. In the first place, the cod is stuffed with Forcemeat No. 5, commonly called veal stuffing, and sewed up; the fish in its thick part being at the same time scored and slashed wdth a sharp knife. It is then placed on a baking dish; half a pound of oiled butter is poured over it; pepper and salt are sprinkled on it; and it is put into the oven with some oyster liquor, which mingling wdth the oiled butter is to be used for frequent basting.

285 Macedon Under the name of Alexander it has been already ex- plained that in France, in the middle of the seventeenth century, a Macedon was the parsley of Macedon, which in England was known as the Alexander. At the same time this plant was being fast displaced by the celery, which the Italians brought to perfection; so that early in the last century it was of little or no account, and the name^ of Macedon became disengaged. It was given to a medley of vegetables, not because they were a medley, but because they were, so to speak, fricassded—that is, cut to pieces and served with a white fricassee sauce. What is the connection? Alexander the Great was supposed to have brought haricots from India, and was said to have liked them fricasseed—at least, that is the expressive word used by the Marquiss de Gussy (L’Art Culinaire, chap. viii.), who has preserved the tradition, though without being very sure of his classical authorities. Add to the haricots a variety of other vegetable; fricassee all together in the fashion approved by the great Alexander—and what could be more natural than to name the dish either Legumes a l’Alexandre, or L^g'umes & la Macedoine? In point of fact, the Macedon, as at first created, was just such a dish; and it still survives as the standard form of the Macedon. In course of time, it was forgotten that the name of Macedon was given to the vegetables on account of the (supposed) Macedonian method of serving them, and popular imagination fixed upon variety as the most notable mark of the dish. The name of Macedon came thus to be transferred from the mode of cooking the vegetables to their great variety; afterwards it was applied to a variety of fruits, and now it is used as a playful synonym for mdlange. Macedon of Vegetables.—This is the Alexandrian or Macedonian fricassee as imagined by the French cooks, and transferred from the haricots, which the great commander loved, to a medley of vegetables.

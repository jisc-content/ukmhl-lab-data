Restaurant 377 naise. i lie name comes from the verb remoudre, to grind— and refers to grinding to a fine flour the hard yolk. By carefully and gradually grinding together the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, with five tablespoonfuls of oil, one or one and a half of tarragon vinegar, and a little salt and white pepper, it is possible to produce a Remoulade as smooth as a Mayonnaise, and differing in no respect from a good English salad dressing.

One of the earliest accounts of it is to be found in a little book pub- lished at Lyons in 1557, and supposed to be the first work of Bernard Palissy, the potter. It is an attack upon the ignorance and blunders of doctors—“ Declaration des Abus des Medecins”; and the name of the author is given, not as Bernard Palissy, but as Pierre Braillier. Whoever be the author, he showed for the first time the absurdity of the fashionable soup. He opens his attack upon it by ridiculing a detail which is not essential, but is curious, and of interest to this day. The physicians of those days recommended an old hen or capon to make a good soup for invalids. Tire tradition of this remains not only in the cock-a-leekie of the Scotch, which is always supposed to be made of an old cock (and they are in this respect only following rules which they learned from the cooks patronised by Mary Stuart and Mary of Guise), but also in the French kftchen to this day. Nearly all the great French cooks recommend an old hen for soups. Now here is something curious. In the year 1557 Brailler, be he Palissy or another, laughed

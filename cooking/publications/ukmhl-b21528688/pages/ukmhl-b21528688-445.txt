421 Scotch Broth one of the most curious things about the kitchen that, either because cooks are in general very ignorant, or because they love to mystify their dishes, the terms we use for food are the most corrupt of any in the language. Scotch Broth is to Scotland what the pot-au-feu is to France, and involves an important question in household economy. The pot-au-feu of the French housewife is furnished for the most part with beef, which certainly is the best of all meat for broth. The broth or bouillon it yields may not only be made into first-rate soup, but is otherwise available for working into - the stock which goes to form the finest sauces. I his is no doubt a great advantage. But on the other hand, the frugal French housekeeper v/ants meat for her table as well as soup; she therefore takes the boiled beef—or bouilli as it is called—out of the pot, and serves this to her family nearly every day of their lives.

There is soup and sauce made of the beef, but once used for that purpose, it is rarely eaten. The Scotch take the same view; but they have for centuries set up another system, which they still hold to wherever they are to be found, all over the world.

The fact is, that many of the most delicious French soups are made without a spoonful of broth witness the asparagus one. And further, to the advan- tage of the account, there is a great gain—the mutton is eatable. It is notorious that in the clubs of London, with

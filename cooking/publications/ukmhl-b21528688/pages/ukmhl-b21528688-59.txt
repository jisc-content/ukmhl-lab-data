Apple 35 This apple is imported from America. For more than a hundred years the English gardeners have tried to . t produce it, but they cannot reach the flavour of the American stock.

February Sturmer Pippin. (June.) The last of the Mohicans. Kitchen Apples. Most of these are called codlings-—from the old verb to coddle, to boil a little, stew or simmer. The peculiar virtue of a kitchen apple is expressed in a phrase which is a constant reminder of the Garden of Eden—to fall. An apple is said to fall when on being cooked it forms a pulpy- mass of equal consistence. Some of the dessert apples as the Wormsley pippin, summer pearmain, golden winter pearmain, Fearn s, Blenheim and Ribston pippins, Here- fordshire pearman, reinette de Canada, Dutch mignonne, Downton nonpareil—have this falling virtue, and may therefore be used in the kitchen. The following are said to be unfit for dessert, and are used only for cooking. But all depends on taste, and a lad)' of very good taste has been heard to say that Sops-in-wino is the most heavenly of the apples, and might well tempt an innocent in Paradise or reward a goddess on Mount Ida. ^ August Keswick Codling.

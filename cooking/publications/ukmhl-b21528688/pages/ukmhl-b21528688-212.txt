188 Forcemeat of the dear departed, putting the head at one end and the tail at the other to look like nature. Certainly the French - make excellent farce; but a little of it goes a long way, especially with people who are not dependent upon pap, and who have not yet come to substitute the action of pestle and mortar for that of their own good grinders. We, therefore, who are in good health, and have not lost our powers of mastication, must entreat the cooks to be moderate in their farces, and to spare their stuffing. I 1. Quenelle. I his is the finest of the French force- meats, and will be described under its own name, both on account of its pre-eminence, and because it involves a little critical discussion. 2. Godiveau.—lake veal and ox-kidney fat in propor- tions which vary according to taste and the season of the year. The fat is never less than the veal; sometimes it is double the quantity; most commonly it is between the two —namely, half as much again as the veal: let us say, eight ounces of veal to twelve of beef fat. They are both to be picked perfectly free of skin and thready fibres, and to be chopped very small. Season them with pepper, salt, nutmeg; and, still chopping, add two whole eggs—one at a time—until they are well mixed. Then transfer all to a mortar, along with a spoonful or two of very cold water in winter, or an ounce or two of ice in the summer; and it is in summer, by the way, that the quantity of fat must be a minimum, for fear of its turning. Keeping all as chilly as possible, pound it briskly until it is mixed into a smooth paste. If there is any sign of melting, use more ice, or take the godiveau out upon a plate and chill it in the ice- box. When the godiveau has become soft and smooth, it is to be rolled on a marble slab with flour, and divided into balls or sticks lightly powdered over with flour, which are finally to be poached in water or broth, and used for a garnish of various dishes.

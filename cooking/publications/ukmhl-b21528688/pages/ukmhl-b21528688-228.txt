204 Ga liiviawfrey singles out alone among plants as belonging to his craft, must have the same force as the first two syllables of that word—the n in Galinmawfrey being elided before m. Having arrived at this point, we can go further; for it has been ascertained that the Galingale means the sweet gale, an epithet which survives in the more modern name of sweet Cyperus, and which as applied to herbs—sweet basil, sweet marjoram, and the rest—means not saccharine, but savoury.

Next note, that though by itself mew or maw in English and the kindred languages means always a gull, it may some- times either in a compound or a derivative be applied to other birds. In German we come upon a pigeon the

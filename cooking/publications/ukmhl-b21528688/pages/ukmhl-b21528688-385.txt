361 Poitlette Sauce celery, and with red cabbage which has boiled for fifteen minutes in water with an extra allowance of salt, and which has been allowed to soak afterwards in a wine- glassful of vinegar. Potato Soup.—Make a puree of three pounds of mealy potatoes, and mix it with two quarts of boiling broth, adding pepper and salt. Boil it for five minutes, removing any scum that may rise, and finish the soup with a piece of butter. Some people enjoy a flavour of onion in this soup—in which case mince finely two ounces, fry them lightly, and let them stew in the soup for ten minutes. Pot-au-Feu.—See the chapter on Soup. Poulette Sauce, in its best form, is no other than . Allemande or Almayne sauce. Most commonly it is a mock Almayne made as follows. Stir on the fire for a quarter of an hour three ounces of butter, three of flour, and nearly a pint of white broth, which in the case of fowls will be the broth in which they have boiled. Then add a leason of two or three yolks of eggs, and finish with lemon-juice. Mushrooms, shalots and parsley are added to form what is called the Poulette Ragout or Relish. It has already been explained that the Almayne, or Allemande, is an attempt to improve upon the Dutch sauce; and since Poulette is now described as a mock Almayne, it may likewise be described as a parody of the Dutch. It is a Dutch sauce with a little less of eggs and a good deal less of butter; but with flour in it (which the Dutchman never uses), and with white broth instead of water. Poulette means a hen chicken, and the Poulette sauce is but the enrichment with eggs of the white parsley-and- butter sauce so well-known in England as the clothing of boiled chicken. It is sometimes in English books named lemon sauce, because finished with lemon-juice.

Pastry let all simmer together for an hour and a half. Then drain the cabbage and make a low hayrick of it upon a dish. On the top of the rick, or (for a Chartreuse) in the middle of it, lay the partridges, and round them the sausages and slices of pork, and over all a gravy made of the liquor they have stewed in, assisted, if need be, with veal gravy. Englishmen who are asked to admire this dish, which h rench cooks elaborate with extraordinary care, lavishing immense ingenuity on the Chartreuse of partridges, have a right to observe that the proverb Toujours Perdrix is eminently h rench, and would never have been thought of but for the Perdrix aux choux. Pass.—This is as great a word in cookery as it is in legerdemain. “Pass!” says the juggler, and the pigeon vanishes. A F rench cook passes almost everything' through a sieve, and according to the theory of evolution, he will himself one day pass through the sieve and become a puree. But the grand and peculiar use of the word for which it has a place in this dictionary implies a process of cookery. A cook will speak of passing a fowl, or a piece of meat, or vegetables. In the French kitchen they have not only the verb passer, but also (which is the same thing) faire revenir. To pass is to pass in butter over the fire ; in short, to fry lightly for a minute or two, so as to create a rich surface on what it is intended to finish by a different process of cooking—say by stewing. To pass in a trifle of butter is to frying what the preface is to the book, the prologue to the play and the overture to the opera. Pastry.—It has been said that the greatest discovery of the modern kitchen is pastry, and it would be difficult to name any other article of food which is better entitled to this praise. The discovery of America added much to the resources of the table; and we have an immense advantage over the ancients in tea, coffee, and chocolate. We owe

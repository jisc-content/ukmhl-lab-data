It will keep in good condition for a long time; but English people do not seem to care enough about it to take the trouble of making it, and those who delight in it are content to buy it ready-made from the Italian ware- house. For the best go to Lingner’s, Old Compton Street, Soho, and Fenchurch Street, City. 1 ake two pounds of it, and simmer it gently for three or four hours in water. Drain off the water and toss it over the fire in some fat broth of good flavour. Serve

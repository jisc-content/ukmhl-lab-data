9 Introduction Julienne, is peculiar, but the peculiarity is nearly lost m modern cookery; and we may say that practically all ten are one and the same soup, with differences which are wholly accidental. Put into the soup a variety of vege- tables such as a gardener’s wife might filch m her apron, and there is the soup a la Jardiniere. It is also the soup a la Macedoine. Put into it the early spring vegetables, and there is the spring soup.

It is a mere senseless heaping up of names and receipts, to the ruin of cooks and to the incessant disappointment of the dinner-table. In other cases we have a single receipt where we might well have half a dozen—as witness aspic jelly. The science of the kitchen is so proud of its achievement in this one receipt, that it rests in its triumph, makes no attempt at variety, and afflicts us with one eternal co meat sauce. The English have been often satirised for their one sauce—the so-called melted butter. But hrench cookery with all its pretensions, ought to be ashamed of the monotony produced by aspic.

The dinner of Englishmen, far more than of foreigners, implies a large joint of meat which has afterwards to be eaten cold. There is cold meat at breakfast, cold meat at luncheon, cold meat at supper, cold meat all the day-which is eaten with pickles for lack of good sauce. Here was a great opportunity

Cabbage 97 ABBAGE is the general name for a vegetable that presents itself in several varieties, which, putting the coleworts or wild sort out of account, may be ranged in three classes, i. That with loose, open leaves—known as greens, kale, and borecole. 2. That which is closed up— the white, sometimes called the Milan cabbage, the red cab- bage, the Savoy (distinguished from the other closed ones by its wrinkled leaves), and Brussels sprouts, which are generally ranked as a variety of the Savoy. 3. The flowering sort—namely, cauliflower and brocoli, white and purple. In a loose way, the name of cabbage is given to all of these, except to Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and brocoli; which shall therefore be noticed under their own special names. The other varieties of cabbage do not call for much remark. Though used in soups and for garnish, they are hardly ever served as entremets, unless we make an exception in favour of sauerkraut, which however nearly always implies the accompaniment of sausages or bacon. Another apparent exception is the Chartreuse. I his looks like a dish of cabbage to be eaten by itself and for itself. But the sly monks of the Grande Chartreuse taught our cooks to hide dainty morsels of partridge within the cabbage leaves. Cabbage for Garnish.—The English way is simple enough, and applies equally to Brussels sprouts, turnip- tops, endive, and lettuce. After being carefully trimmed and washed, the cabbage— halved and quartered—is thrown into boiling water, which has not only salt in it but often a little carbonate of soda to' keep it green. A large quantity of water is used, especially in the case of turnip-tops, which are to be treated as a kind of greens or open cabbage; or else several waters are used to carry off bitterness of taste and rankness of odour.

Persons afflicted with the gout have found relief from using them ; so have patients in cases of the stone; and Hoffman states that he has known consumptive people cured by them.”—Abercrombie, quoted by Loudon. Strawberry Pudding.—Mash a quart of strawberries with sugar to taste—probably three-quarters of a pound.

At such a rate of reproduction the world would soon become the abode of sturgeons alone, were it not that the roe is exceedingly

196 Galantine heat is usually ascertained by throwing a small bit of bread into it. If the fat is hot enough, the bread will fizz, and give out airbells. N.B.—There must be no salt in the fat nor in the food fried in it. The salting takes place afterwards. LANTINE.—About this curious word the French philologers, Littre and Brachet at their head, are in a thick fog. Everybody knows that galantine is not gelatine. These are two words for two things which are as different as possible. Nobody dreams that a fowl or any- thing else in a galantine means the same thing as one in a jelly or gelatine. But the French etymologists, without a shadow of misgiving, insist that because in old writings they cannot find mention of galantine, whereas they do find mention of galatine, they must both mean the same thing (which indeed they do), and that this same thing must be gelatine,-—which it is not. Oddly enough, M. Brachet winds up his proofs that galantine must be gelatine by quoting from a MS. account-book of the thirteenth century this item, “ De duodecim lampredis portatis in galatina, which he does not actually translate, but which he assumes with the most perfect assurance to mean—Twelve lampreys served in a jelly or gelatine. Now it so happens that in England we can lay our hands upon the receipt for doing the lampreys in a galantine, and the moment it is explained it will be seen that it has nothing whatever to do with a gelatine. It means, or rather it meant, a preparation flavoured with the powdered root of the sedge called galin- gale, or galangale, to which Tennyson refers when he speaks of “ meadows set with slender galingale.

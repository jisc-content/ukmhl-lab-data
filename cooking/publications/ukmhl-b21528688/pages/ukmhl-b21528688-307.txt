283 Macaroni Macaroni ci l’Italiennet—Put some macaroni into eight times its weight of boiling water. A pound and a pint being equivalent quantities, there should be four pints of boiling water for half a pound of the paste. Let it simmer with a little pepper and salt for twenty minutes-—more or less, according to the quality of the macaroni, particularly its freshness. Test a piece between the fingers to know when it is done enough. Then drain it from the water in a colander, and put it back in the stewpan with as much broth or gravy as it can absorb in a further simmering of a minute or two. Half a pound of macaroni will take about half a pint of broth or gravy. Some cooks omit this process altogether, and in England it is common to use milk instead of broth; but our business at present is with the Italian fashion—Macaroni a l’ltalienne. In the meantime have ready (for half a pound of macaroni) four or five ounces of grated cheese, half Parmesan, half Gruyere, and an ounce of butter. Shake half the cheese into the macaroni, and toss it well; then mix in the ounce of butter; finally shake in the remainder of the cheese, and when all is well mixed by tossing, and it begins to get stringy, serve it. Some people like the cook to be liberal with the pepper-pot in this dish. Macaroni a la Milanaise is the same as the foregoing, with tomato sauce sprinkled over it in the dish; but gene- rally in this case there is some addition of meat—say a cutlet—served over the macaroni. Macaroni au gratin is still prepared in the same way. It is then heaped up on a dish which will stand the fire. It is sprinkled with grated cheese and with fine bread-raspings; it is bedewed with melted butter; it is put into the oven till it becomes of a golden hue; and if the oven is not hot enough, it may be finished with the salamander.

Faggots 181 universally received, but as an attempt to make out a list which shall be at once clear and free from useless repetition :— 1. Faggot of Parsley.—This is a little bunch of parsley tied up with cibols or spring onions. It is in French called a bouquet. 2. Faggot of Sweet-herbs.—What the French call a bouquet garni. This used to be described as a faggot of parsley with the addition of a bayleaf and a sprig of thyme. As in practice, however, when this faggot is used, there are onions or shalots besides, the cibols or spring onions of the parsley faggot come to be of small account. It is better, therefore, to leave out the cibols, and to describe it as made up of parsley, bayleaf and thyme. 3- Faggot of Ravigote.—Tarragon, chervil, burnet, and chives. Sometimes there is parsley, but it is quite un- necessary besides the tarragon and the chervil; and it is a good illustration of the indiscriminate fashion in which cooks throw in one good thing after another. It is the old story of the artist who could paint a cypress and therefore put a cypress into all his pictures, no matter what the subject. Parsley is a good thing, and therefore cooks will strew it everywhere. See the article on Ravi- gote—only here note that for the most part this faggot is got together to be chopped. 4. Faggot of Duxelles.—Dubois and Bernard have called this Fine Herbs; and Gouffe, without adopting the name, has given his opinion in favour of it. There are reasons why we should still keep to the old French name of Duxelles—which see. Ever since Beauvilliers laid down the law, the faggot of Duxelles has consisted of equal weights of mushrooms, parsley, and shalots, minced finely together and fried for five minutes with rasped bacon, pepper and salt. In later times, those who can get it add an equal weight of truffles. It is a question, however,

Sauce 4*3 the other forty-nine were to be worked into sauces and garnitures. And so, by introducing the flavour of the Estremadura bacon and ham into the old brown sauce of the French, there came into being the Spanish sauce. It was a grand hit this—the introduction of the hammy taste. The fashion spread, and the word was passed from cook to cook as a secret worth knowing, that to make the brown sauce in perfection there was nothing like a slice or two of Spanish ham. But the best Montanches porkers are fed on vipers; and a retribution followed, as though the vipers in the Spanish hams was warmed to life and poisoned the wits of the French cooks. The hams of Montanches are not too plentiful in this world of sorrow, and the cooks came to be satisfied with any ham—even with French ham, which is little better than salted pork. So the meaning of the prescription was lost; the peculiarity of the Spanish sauce passed away, and its name became a puzzle. The French ham, which is not properly smoked, went for little or nothing; and there is no clear difference between the old brown sauce and that which is now called Spanish Then followed this follyThe French cooks having a tradition, which they did not understand, that ham was a good thing for brown sauce, thought it must be equally good for white, and put it into their Velvet-down, where it is altogether a mistake, as will presently be shown; only as it was the tasteless French ham which was thus inserted, no result ensued except a pleasant sensation for the cooks that they were doing their work in the grand style and vindicating the title of their art to the utmost ceremony. I he cooks of other nations looked on with astonishment; and seeing in the receipts that slices of ham are always to line the bottom of the stockpot, laughed at the useless niceties of the French chemistry. The fact is, that the very best brown sauce can be made without an ounce of ham or bacon; and to make the true Spanish sauce as understood by the old French cooks, a few

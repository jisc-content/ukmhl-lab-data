Introduction 8 of a people who cannot detect their own word buuf when they see it in a different spelling. Or again, when in English cookery books we find that Palestine soup is not what we should expect—a soup common in the Holy Land,—but one made of tubers derived from America, and called, by corruption of Girasole, Jerusalem arti- chokes, we may rejoice over a jest, and need not com- plain of practical injury. The disease of the cookery books goes very much deeper than this. • Dr. Johnson hit the truth a century ago. “ I could write.’ he says, •• a better book of cookery than has yet been written. It should be a book upon philosophical principles. Phar- macy is now made much more simple. Cookery may be made so too. A prescription which is now compounded of five ingredients formerly had fifty in it. So in cookery. If the nature of the ingredients be well known, much fewer will do.” There is no need to talk heie of philosophy: all that is wanted is common sense. And one thing is pretty evident—that whereas in the labora- tory of the chemist elements are minimised and processes are simplified to the last degree, in the laboratory of the kitchen we see the very reverse, and it is considered the height of science and of art to multiply ingredients and to make processes as intricate and ceremonious as pos- sible. An artistic chef seems to be ashamed of a simple receipt; although it should be the pride of science to reduce labour and to aim at unity. The preparation of a French sauce will soon be as full of forms and cere- monies as the dances and incantations round the witches’ cauldron, with its Eye of newt and toe of frog, Wool of bat and tongue of dog, Adder’s fork and blindworm’s sting, Lizard’s leg and owlet’s wing. The multiplication of ingredients and processes with a long tedious ritual, more than half of which is idle, leads

Blanquette 74 Blanquette is as good a name as one could get for a white sauce, and it is a name which might well be adopted in England, where it would be thoroughly understood. There is absolutely no difference between a Blanquette sauce and the so-called Allemande or German sauce, unless it be this—that occasionally there is chopped parsley put into the former. A Blanquette of fowls, of sweetbreads, or of veal, means simply the serving' of these things in the white Allemande. The white parsley and butter sauce which is so* common in England with boiled chickens is but a rough and ready Blanquette. The Poulette sauce is the same thing, with sometimes chopped mushrooms added and with a squeeze of lemon. Bleu (au bleu).—A phrase of the French kitchen for the simplest method of cooking fish. It means cooking it either in plain salt and water, or in white wine with parsley and onions. Originally the wine was red; and hence the name blue (petit bleu), as we say small beer in England. What with the old style and the new, how- ever, there is an odd medley of colours, white, red, and blue. Blonde de Veau is described at length in the article on Soup. It is a double veal broth, which is much in request for mixing with soups and sauces for its smooth gelatinous texture, and also for its fine colour and flavour, which are brought out by making it fall to a glaze at an early stage of its preparation. Perhaps it is overrated; it certainly was at one time. Early in the last century it became all the rage in France. There is a letter of Voltaire’s in which he invites St. Lambert to visit him at Cirey. “ Come to Cirey,” he says. “ There Madame du Chatelet will not poison you. There is not a spoonful of beef gravy (jus) in her kitchen; everything is done with blond de veau : we shall live a hundred years, and you will never die.”

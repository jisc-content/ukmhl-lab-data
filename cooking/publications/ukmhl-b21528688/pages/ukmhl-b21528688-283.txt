259 Jelly when he can take nothing else. “ It cannot do you any good,” says the chemist, “ because I cannot find it a place in my scale of diet.” All the sick man can say is—“ I like it—my stomach will tolerate this jelly when it can tolerate nothing else. No chemist has ever yet been able to express in figures the good that coffee does, or tea; and when I can take a good jelly with pleasure, why should I refuse it merely because the chemist is at fault with his weights and measures, cannot find gelatine in the blood, and cannot tell what part it plays in the body, where nevertheless for some useful purpose it abounds? ” Calf’s-foot Jelly.—-Jelly can be made from bones, from hartshorn, from isinglass, from prepared gelatine, from moss. The best, however, is made from meat, and the most expeditious from calves’ feet. Calves’ feet are extremely useful in this way, and may as opportunity serves be helped out with knuckle of veal, pig’s skin, or any other gelatinous substance at hand. Under the head of Aspic will be found a receipt for calf’s-foot jelly flavoured with vegetables, to be eaten with cold meat. The same receipt, barring the vegetables, holds for what is commonly called calf’s-foot jelly—a sweetened jelly which belongs to the entremets. When the calf’s feet have been boiled down, and the liquor has been passed through a sieve as well as freed from grease, sugar is added, and spices such as cinnamon and coriander seeds. All this is dissolved over the fire, together with half a bottle of sherry (but some prefer rum, punch, or noyau), the juice of six and zest of two lemons. The liquor is then clarified with whites of eggs, and it is tested for strength. If it is not strong enough some isinglass is added, or else some per- fectly trustworthy gelatine; it is then passed through a jelly-bag and left to set in a mould. English cooks boast of calf’s-foot jelly as their own peculiar invention, and the French freely accord this glory

402 Sally Lunn Sally Lunn is an honoured name from the Land’s End to John o’Groats. But why should the reader be called upon to meditate upon her virtues in these pages, in which so little has been said about the Bath bun, the Banbury cake, the Scotch shortbread, the Brioche, the Baba, the Savarin, the Gauffre, and many another noble thing? The reason is that her name has been mixed up with a little culinary scandal; and it is necessary to vindicate her fair fame. The greatest cook of modern times, Careme, came over to England to minister to the palate of the Prince Regent. He did not stay long, but he stayed long enough to appreciate the charms of Sally Lunn and her ever memorable cake. He was a great cook, but a fearful coxcomb—an immeasurable egotist. If ever he made the slightest change in a dish, he vaunted the variation as an original idea, and thenceforward set up as the sovereign creator of the dainty. So it was that he dressed up Sail} Lunn a little, and presented her to the Parisian world as his own—his Solilemne. The fact mignt well be foigotten, but there are stupid asses who will not let us forget it. They come over to England; they send up, among the sweets of a dinner, Sally and her teacake, rigged out in the height of French fashion ; and like an English dancer or singer who insists on Mademoiselle to her name, the good honest Sally that we know is announced as the incom- parable Solilemne. Salmi.—As to the meaning of the word some informa- tion will be found in the article on Gallimawfrey. It means a highly sauced preparation (sal) of some bird (mi). Salmagundi-—in French salmigondis—is the same thing, with the additional indication that the bird, mi or ma, is pounded, or in the language of our ancient cookery smitten to gobbets.” The ordinary salmi admits of many varia- tions, according to the nature of the bird, which is fitst roasted, then allowed to get cold, then carved, then heated

i86 Flounder former require more air than the latter, and that when they cease to breathe freely they deteriorate. As a matter of fact we find that those fish which disport near the surface of the water—mackerel, salmon, trout, herring— die and decay soon. They cannot be cooked too fresh. On the other hand, fish that haunt the bottom of the sea or of rivers—carp, eels, skate, and all the flat fish—are tenacious of life, and may be kept quite fresh for some time after they have left the water.

These flounders are the fish most favoured at Greenwich for waterzootje, and when they are small and plump, they are sweet and melt in the mouth. If a flounder is to be fried, it is best to fry it in

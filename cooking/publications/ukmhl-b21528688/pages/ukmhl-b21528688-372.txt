Pigeon 34§ bird is little noticed save in the form of pigeon-pie—but that is the most favoured of all the pies. Roast Pigeons.-—Barded with bacon; under the bacon a vineleaf, when it is to be had. Roast them for twenty minutes; when nearly ready, take off the barding to dust them with flour and to froth them; but it will be no disadvantage if the bacon is replaced in serving them.

Garnish them with the lettuce or cabbage, if that has been selected in the preparation, but if not used, there are other garnishes—such as peas, asparagus points, arti- choke bottoms, mushrooms, sweetbreads, cockscombs. Chartreuse of Pigeons is done in the same way as the Chartreuse of partridges—and that is in principle the same as the Perdrix aux choux or partridge with cabbage. The only difference is, that in the Chartreuse the partridges are. concealed in the cabbage to satisfy the consciences of the fasting friars.

They are placed in a stewpan with a morsel of butter, a faggot of sweet-herbs, and some sliced onions. When half-cooked they are taken out (the faggot and onion slices also), and two yolks of eggs are mixed into the butter in which they

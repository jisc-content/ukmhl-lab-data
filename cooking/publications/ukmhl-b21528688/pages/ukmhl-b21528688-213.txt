189 Forcemeat 3. Godiveau with herbs.—When shalots, chives and parsley are chopped and pounded with the above, we have the Godiveau aux fines herbes, useful in various ways, but especially as an addition to pies. 4.

Scald them for two or three minutes, drain them, put them into a stewpan with breadcrumbs (six ounces), butter (two ounces), pepper and salt, let them simmer very slowly for ten or fifteen minutes, and then the stuffing is ready.

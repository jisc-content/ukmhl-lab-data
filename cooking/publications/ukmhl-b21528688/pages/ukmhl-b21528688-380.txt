356 Potato Potato.—The place of the potato in the English dinner has been discussed when treating of bread, and the place it holds on the French dinner-table. On account of the badness of English bread, the potato has largely displaced it at English tables; and it is now to be added that, on account of the badness of other vegetables in English cooking, the potato has gained a further importance far beyond its merits. (See Bread; also Vegetables.) Yet, with all this exaggerated importance, English cooks cannot make the potato important enough to be eaten by itself. Go into a first-rate restaurant in Paris—say the Cafe Anglais—and at the end of dinner ask, by way of entre- met, for a simple dish of potatoes tossed in butter : it will turn out a beautiful little dish, and it will be charged in the bill two or two-and-a-half francs.

The French pay the price freely—which shows that they set a higher value on a good potato than we do, though they do not eat so many of them, nor suffer them to take the place of bread and to dominate over other vegetables. Boiled Potatoes.—The Irish way—that is, cooked and served in their jackets—or, as the French say, en robe de chambre. The potatoes are to be all of a size, and to be well washed and brushed, but they are in no way to be touched with a knife, even to clear what are called the eyes. Pour cold water over them, just enough to cover them, and when it boils, add plenty of salt—a large teaspoonful for a quart of water. Simmer them gently with a tight lid : the length of time will depend on the size and kind of the potatoes,—it may be from twenty to forty'-fi\e minutes; but the last two or three minutes they should be made to boil rapidly. Prick them with a fork, to see if they are done enough. Then lift off the lid and put the pot aside, to let all the moisture escape in steam. The Irish

The Lady Mayonnaise 299 vulgar—in this case quite the contrary; I mean only words which are lifted out of their natural sense into a special, figurative and technical meaning, and which have a peculiar currency on the lips of the initiated. Springing up in the dialect ol the South, it would always be strange and sometimes incomprehensible to those who spoke the dialect of the North. For them—for the French—it would be translated into fatigtier, and the two verbs mahonner and fatiguer would exist concurrently in French. The former at length dropped out of sight altogether, surviving only in the derivative Mahonnaise or Mayonnaise, with a vague tradition preserved in the kitchen down to the time of Careme that the name had reference to the manner of mixing or fatiguing the sauce. The'explanation, however, is not yet complete; there is a flaw in the evidence. How are we to account for the final syllable of Mahonnaise, which usually belongs to adjectives connected with place? and how are we to con- struct any likely adjective from the active verb Mahonner? In this case we must be prepared to accept any word which could by licence be twisted into anything like Mahonnaise, for the Provencal spelling is so loose and takes so wide a range (as will have been seen above in the second syllable of Mahonner, mechaigner, mehagner, maganhar, mehenier), that even a distant resemblance might satisfy us. But from an active verb mahonner there is no such adjective possible. The nearest thing we can create is a participal adjective mahonnant or mahonnante, or such a word as mahonnable; and these are nothing like what we want. The fact is that the word Mahonnaise is not an adjective at all, but a feminine substantive, applied to women. According to the laws of modern French spelling, it ought to be Mahonneur for the masculine, and Mahonneuse for the feminine-—one who fatigues. So we have danseuse from danser, char- meuse from charmer, and the old word gouverneuse from

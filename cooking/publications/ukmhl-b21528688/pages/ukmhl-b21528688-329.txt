Mirepoix 305 this word and abolish it. What is the Duke of Mirepoix to us because his wife was amiable to Louis XV. ? If she be not fair to me, What care I how fair she be ? The Duke of Mirepoix made himself convenient to the king, and his name is now convenient to the people-—the convenient name for the faggot of vegetables that flavours a stew or a sauce. Take two carrots, two onions, two shalots, two bay- leaves, a sprig of thyme, a clove of garlic; mince them very small with half a pound of fat bacon and half a pound of raw ham, and pass them in butter with pepper and salt.

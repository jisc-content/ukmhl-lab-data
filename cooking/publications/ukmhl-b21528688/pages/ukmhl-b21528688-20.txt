PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION. Years have rolled by since Kettner’s Book of the Table first saw the light. The moment it made its debut in the world of letters its success was assured. It came, was read, and conquered. A loud, a unanimous, and a rapturous cho> us of approval welcomed its appearance. To it might with j ustice have been applied the words in which the greatest of lexico- graphers expressed his appreciation of another immortal work * “ It satisfies the critics and delights mankind.’ The heads of the culinary profession accepted it as the last word, le dernier cri, as our neighbours on the other side of the Channel would say, upon their art. The “plain cook who was fortunate enough to secure a copy found in its simple but scientific formula a guide at once infallible and easy to follow. The demand for it exceeded the wildest anticipations. Like the apple-pie of the nursery legend it was “ longed for,’ even “ fought for,” and when “ got ” or “ had ” was not, so to speak, merely “ bit ” or “ ate,” but devoured, while when lost or mislaid it was deeply ‘' mourned for.” It made its way equally into the regal palace, the ancient hall, and the lowly cottage pauperum tabernas, regumque turres the splendid town mansion, the luxurious club, the hunting-box, and the batchelor’s bungalow. *Milton’s VAllegro and II Penseroso.

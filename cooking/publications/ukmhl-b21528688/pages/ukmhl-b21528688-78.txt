54 Barbel solid and seven liquid. For nightcap, if required, a tumbler of grog (gin, whisky, brandy, without sugar), or a glass or two of claret or sherry.” Barbel is hardly ever eaten in England. Our anglers either throw it away, or keep it for the cat. This is pro- bably because its roe is pernicious. But the French speak well of the little carp, and have a special admiration for its head and its tongue, or the sort of palate which is called the tongue in carps. They sometimes admit, however, that the body of the fish is insipid, and requires a good sauce. Bard is an old English as well as an old French word, of origin uncertain, for horse-armour. It was also used for armour in general. 1 hus the chronicler Stowe speaks of 1,500 men “ barded and richly trapped.” Noun or verb, the word is not now used save in the language of the kitchen, where it refers to the thin slices of bacon in which any kind of flesh likely to dry up in cooking, but more especially in roasting, is swathed. The metaphor has been as far as this particular word is concerned borrowed from the French kitchen. In England in the time of Chaucer, and in the kitchen of Richard II., a bird coated in this way with bacon was said to- be armed or enarmed. The learned and reverend editors of the cookery-books which remain to us from that timp seem to be not a little puzzled when they read of cranes and herons being armed or enarmed with lards of swyne, ” and fancy it must mean larded in the modern acceptation. It means barded; and if one could recover the old MS. of The Forme of Cury, the receipt-book of Richard’s court, it would probably be found that in many instances in which the editor, Dr. Pegge, read lard, the scribe wrote bard.

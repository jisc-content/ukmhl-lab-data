488 Whey has been known to catch a thousand birds in a day. He can easily catch five hundred. And this system of ensnaring goes on till the third week in September, when the birds have nearly all left. Each bird is sup- posed to be worth a penny to the shepherd. At least, Southey tells the story of one of the amiable minor poets, Hurdis, who used to let the birds out of the traps which he found in his walks, but always left a penny in place of each, to soothe the disappointment of the shepherds. A penny is not much to give for a bird which has been honoured with the name of the English ortolan.

In Switzerland, however, it is considered to have medicinal virtues, especially for the cure of chronic disorders of the abdominal organs; and the treatment which is sometimes fashionable goes by the name of cure de petit lait. There is a popular notion that the whey of milk is sudorific; and hence we have

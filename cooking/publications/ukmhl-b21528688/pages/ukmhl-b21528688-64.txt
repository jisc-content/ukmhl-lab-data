40 Architecture of the Table There is a great controversy, which is still undecided among' the gardeners, whether it is or is not identical with the peach-apricot. It has a peculiarity in this—that the stone is perforated, so that a pin can be passed through it. The aperture is not easy to find. It is in a small groove on the thin side, near the base. A very fine fruit, it scarcely deserves the name of Apricock—the early ripe—for it does not ripen till the beginning or middle of August. The apricot is cooked in all the ways prescribed for apples.

A dish should look tempting and a table should look brilliant; but when

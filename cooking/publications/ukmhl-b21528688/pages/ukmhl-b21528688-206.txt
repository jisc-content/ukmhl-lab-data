Feast 182 whether the quantity of parsley and of shalots is not excessive. In the mind of the inventor the mushrooms were intended to predominate. But if to half a pound of mushrooms you put half a pound of parsley, and on the top of that half a pound of shalots, it scarcely stands to reason that the mushrooms should have much the best of it. 5. Faggot of Mirepoix.—Two carrots, two onions, two shalots, two bayleaves, a sprig of thyme, a clove of garlic, half a pound of fat bacon, and possibly half a pound of ham. Chop these finely and pass them in butter for five minutes, with pepper and salt. For further explanation see Mirepoix. 6. Faggot of Pot-Herbs.-—The following receipt is nearly identical with what the French cooks call Poele, only that it wants veal and ham for reasons which will be found in the article Mirepoix. Take two carrots, two onions, two cloves, and a faggot of sweet-herbs; mince all finely with half a pound of beef fat, and melt it on a slow fire with a little broth and salt, and the juice of at least one lemon. It will be observed that the chief difference between this and the Mirepoix is that it has less of the onion tribe in it, that it has a quantity of lemon-juice, and that fresh fat is substituted for the smoky bacon fat. If this faggot be put into a saucepan with no broth, but plenty of water (say three quarts), together with some flour, and if it be then boiled for half an hour and strained, the resulting liquor is what the French cooks call Blanc. Fawn—to be stuffed and roasted like a hare, barded with bacon.

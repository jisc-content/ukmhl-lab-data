Cut them in diamond shapes, blanch them well, cook them, cool them, drain them, mix them with oil and vinegar, and with a garnish of chopped ravigote.

Haricot Beans.—These are the seeds; first, the flageolets, which are green and are to be had fresh from July to October, or dried always; second, the white haricots, which are the green ones ripened; third, the red haricots; fourth, the large Soissons beans. Plain boiled. If the beans are fresh they are thrown into boiling water; if dry into cold. It was once the custom to soak the latter for a long time—perhaps twenty- four hours—in cold water before use; but this was irksome, for it implied that we could not have haricots without a day’s notice beforehand. It has since been found that by a particular process of boiling the previous soaking can be dispensed with. The art is this, and it applies to dried peas as well : Put the beans into cold water, bring them to the boiling point and simmer them for half an hour; then put in a gill of cold water, bring the beans to the boil- ing point again and simmer as before; every half-hour repeat the cold water, the boiling and the simmering, till the beans are tender. Salt is taken for granted, it is needless to say.

39 Apricot fire till they begin to soften, and then let them get cold. Line a pudding-basin with paste No. 8; put in the apples, cover all over, tie it in a cloth, and boil it for an hour and a half. Apple Pudding of Nottingham.—Arrange the apples in a pie-dish as for baking—the hollows filled with sugar and sprinkled with cinnamon. Pour over them a light batter —the best is described among the fritters, No. i—and bake for three-quarters of an hour. Apple Fritters.—Steep the apples for an hour before- hand in brandy and sugar, and then proceed as for other fritters. Apple Sauce may be made by stewing the apples; but best by baking or roasting- them. When they have fallen, beat them smooth with a wooden spoon, pass them through a sieve, and add to them a very little sugar. Nearly all the receipts recommend a tiny bit of butter; but the quantity is so small as to be inappreciable, and is only mentioned because cooks are afraid of simplicity. No butter, therefore. Apricot.—The old form of the name is apricock, and this is nearer the right word. The last two syllables are the first two of precocious, with the same meaning. It is a Latin word which went to1 Arabia, which was there used with the definite article—Al-precoc, like Al-koran and Algebra—which thence passed to Spain as Albarcoque, and came over to England as Apricock. We owe the fruit in England to a Catholic priest, named Wolfe, who became gardener to King Henry VIII. But the best of all our apricots, the Moorpark variety, came over much later. It was at one time called the Temple apricot, from an idea that we owe to Sir William Temple. It was also called the Anson, because Lord Anson was supposed to have introduced it; but the probability is that it came over to Moorpark much later, when Lord Dunmore resided there.

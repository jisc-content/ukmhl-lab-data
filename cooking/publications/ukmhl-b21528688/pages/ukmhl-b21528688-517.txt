Wild Duck 493 and that red mullets are caught where they find their victuals, beneath the mackerel shoals. But there is no fear of our being shocked by the diet of the widgeon. It is a nice little bird, which feeds wholly on the short sweet glass beloved by the goose. It is for this reason in Lapland called the grass-duck. The nature of its food is perfectly well ascertained; because, unlike its congeners the mallard or wild duck, the poachard and the teal, which feed by night, it feeds by day, and seems to have noigreat fear of the human race.

Let the philosopher say which is best. In the case of the rabbit there can be no doubt: the wild coney is beyond the tame one. But

i5 7 Devils into London; but it is not so good as that of Brittany, Normandy, and Ostend. The clubs are chiefly supplied with Ostend butter. The cream, called clotted cream, is the richest cream there is, short of butter. New milk is strained into shallow metal pans, which after standing for twelve hours are passed on to a hot plate with a fire below, to heat the milk to scalding without boiling or even simmer- ing it. The pans are then carried back to the dairy, allowed to stand for another twelve hours, and the cream is drained off. This is Devonshire or clotted cream. Devon- shire cider is simply the finest in the world. Devonshire pie, called also Squab pie, is made of Devonshire apples and of Devonshire (that is Dartmoor) mutton, or else of pork. See Irish Stew. Devils.—It is the great fault of all devilry that it knows no bounds. A moderate devil is almost a contradiction in terms; and yet it is quite certain that if a devil is not moderate he destroys the palate, and ought to have no place in cookery, the business of which is to tickle, not to annihilate, the sense of taste. Devils are of two kinds —the dry and the wet. The dry devil is a Carbonade, scored, peppered, salted, mustarded or otherwise spiced ; the wet devil is a Bernardine Salmi. See Salmi. Sauce a la Diable.-—The French cooks’ idea of the devil is that he has a passion for shalots. Mr. Masson has written an essay on the Three Devils—namely, Luther’s, Milton’s, and Goethe’s. There is room for yet another essay, yea, a volume, on the Frenchman’s idea of the devil, much given to the onions of Ascalon. Take three or four shalots, and mince them well with a clove of garlic, a fagot of sweet herbs, and as much pepper as may be dared ; simmer all for half an hour in brown sauce and red wine, pass it through a tammy, and know of a surety that this will much- rejoice all French devils.

Whiting o 491 To devil whitebait.—The proper process is at No. 10, to sprinkle it either with red or black pepper—whichever is preferred—along with the salt. But it is one of the tricks of the trade to take whitebait which has been already cooked; to sprinkle it with pepper, then to dip it a second time in the frying-kettle, and lastly to put a fresh sprinkling of pepper upon it.

Codlings have a barbel; whitings have none. Pollacks have the under jaw projecting beyond the upper one; whitings project the upper jaw beyond the lower one. Putting- out of account the month of January, when the whiting- spawns, it may be assumed, eleven months of the year, that a bad whiting is a codling or a pollack. However good a whiting may be, it is absurd to boil him: half the taste is boiled out of him. In any stew, too. he is overpowered by the taste of the sauce. If we

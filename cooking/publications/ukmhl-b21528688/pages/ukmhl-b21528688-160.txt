136 Colbert's Sole Brandade of Cod.—This is a more elaborate method of dressing- salt fish. It is a Provencal dish, and is described under the name of Brandade. Colbert s Sole.—The great French minister who organised the financial system under which, to a very large extent, France still exists, would seem to have a surer title to fame in the soup and the fish which he ad- mired than in all his toils of office.

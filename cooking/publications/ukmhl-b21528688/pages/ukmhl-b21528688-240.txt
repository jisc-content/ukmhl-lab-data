2 16 Gelatine calls to mind the tough digestion of the mowers—“ O dura messorum ilia!” The oddest contradictions arise. Henry of Navarre (Henry IV. of France) had his lips rubbed the moment he was born with a clove of garlic—a time-honoured custom in his native place. On the other hand, garlic was forbidden by statute of Alonzo XI. to his knights of La Banda; and Don Quixote cautions Sancho Panza to be chary of it, as unseemly in the Governor of Barataria. Honest Sancho must beware of the garlic which the king of France had rubbed the first thing upon his infant gums. To English taste the pronounced flavour of g'arlic is insupportable; but many people do not know that some of the most successful compounds owe their excellence to an unsuspected undertone of garlic. Gelatine.—This is what Liebig says in his Letters on Chemistry :—11 It had been long observed that soup made by boiling meat, when concentrated to a certain point, gelatinises or forms a jelly; and people without any sufficient reason adopted the opinion that the substance (gelatine) was the most important, indeed the chief, con- stituent of good soup. Thus it came to pass by degrees that people took to the gelatinising matter for the true soup; and as manufacturers found that the best meat did not yield the finest jelly tablets, but that tendons, feet, cartilage, bones, ivory, and hartshorn yielded the most beautiful and transparent jelly tablets, which were cheaply obtained and sold at a high price, ignorance and the love of gain exchanged the valuable constituents of flesh for gelatine which was only to be distinguished from common joiners’ glue by its high price. It has now been proved by the most convincing experiments, that gelatine, which by itself is tasteless and when eaten excites nausea, pos- sesses no nutritive value; that it is not capable of support- ing the vital process; and that when added to the usual diet it diminishes the nutritive value of the food. Its use

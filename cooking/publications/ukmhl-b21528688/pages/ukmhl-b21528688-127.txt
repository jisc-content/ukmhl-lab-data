Carps 103 must not only be a cook—he must be a draughtsman, a sculptor, and a colourist; and the time and taste which a cook spends on the arts of design, to prepare food for the eye, are so1 much time and taste diverted from the more important business of preparing food for the mouth. Carps are a great family, and include, besides the carp proper, tench, barbel, gudgeon, gold-fish, loach, bream, chub, roach, dace, minnow, and bleak. The carp has a remarkable tenacity of life. He not only lives to a great age—some say 200 years : he survives terrible afflictions. He has been found alive in the muddy bottoms of empty ponds; he may be taken out of the water, packed in moist moss, and with a mouthful of bread steeped in brandy, to be repeated from stage to stage, may be transported to almost any distance; both himself and his wives have been cut open for their roes, they have been sewn up again and returned to the pond, where they have afterwards, like capons and oxon, fattened amazingly and improved in flavour. Nature has provided that not only the carp shall live long, but also that he shall increase and multiply prodigiously. He abounds in roc, and one of his wives alone will produce 700,000 young in a year. The soft roe of the carp is one of the most prized of fishy delicacies, and is served by itself sometimes as an entree or as a soup. (See Roe.) His tongue or false tongue is likewise con- sidered a rare morsel, and for the sake of it some people will buy only carps’ heads and make a dish of them. As for the body of the carp, it is not superb, and requires all the rhetoric of the saucepan. If people choose to' boil, fry, or grill him, they must take the consequences, and do the best they can with caper sauce, Holland sauce, or black butter. He should be either stewed or brazed; and how- ever he is cooked, it is important first of all to extract from his head the gallstone, which else would impart a bitter flavour to the flesh.

Dariole 154 a nurse called a da’i. Some who read this page may remember Mrs. Sherwood’s nursery tale of Lucy and her Daye. If any one will look into Shakespear’s Hindustani dictionary he will see that while in one dialect this word means a nursemaid, in another it means more generally a maidservant. In the Northern dialects of Europe—in Swedish, in Danish, in Icelandic—it will be found that the cognate word means sometimes generally a maid, some- times more particularly a milkmaid or a nursemaid. In the Scotch dialect a dey is a milkmaid. In old English the word meant either a maid or a milkmaid. In the wide sense of maid or woman it remains to’ this hour in the second syllable of la-dy—the bread-maid. How the same word should mean properly a maid, and yet in some cases should be applied particularly now to a milk- maid and now to a nurse, will be apparent in the history of another word—say groom, which means a young man, a lad, and is recognised as such in bridegroom, but which is also applied specially to’ a stable-lad, on board ship to' a cabin-boy (grommet), and in French to a wine- merchant’s man (gourmet). A dairy or deyry is the place for the deys or maids, as faery is the place of the fays and eyrie is the nest for the eggs. Let us now return to Dariole, which Junius identifies with dairy, and declares to mean something made of milk— laitiron. As a matter of fact it is made of milk—it is a cheesecake; but this is not necessarily expressed in the word. The root is da or dey, a maid—the final syllable of lady. And what is the rest of the word? The old spelling is Daryol or Daryal, and it means Da.-royal, a maid of honour. If any one should be surprised at the application in those early times of so fanciful a name to a cheesecake, he has only to look into any cookery book of the period—that of Chaucer—and he will find in close proximity to Maids of honour, a Douce Arne, which is after all but a stewed fowl.

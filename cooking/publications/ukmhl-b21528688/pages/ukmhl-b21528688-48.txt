24 A lisp ice yolks of eggs, say four to a pint, smoothed with a pat of the freshest butter, and flavoured with lemon-juice; some- times also, but not always, with essence of mushrooms. How this sauce got its name is not quite clear; but it is plain that, not only have the Hollander and the German long been more or less confounded togethei as Dutchmen (Deutsch), but also that the sauce Allemande or sauce of Almayne is of the same character as the well-known Dutch sauce or sauce Hollandaise, and is probably an attempt to improve upon it.

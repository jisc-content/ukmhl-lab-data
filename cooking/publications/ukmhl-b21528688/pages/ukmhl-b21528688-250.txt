226 G ravy about two pounds of gravy beef cut to pieces, and add a gill of water—the beef fat, when melted, making with the water half a pint of liquid. Set the pan on a brisk fire, to boil sharply until the contents are well browned and the liquor reduced to a glaze. Watch carefully during this process, which is really a process of roasting (see Glaze), so that there may be no burning. 2. Then add a quart of boiling water, and leave it for a little, so that the glaze may have time to melt and detach itself from the pan. After- wards set it on to boil with some salt, skim it carefully, and throw in a carrot, a head of celery, both cut up, a faggot of parsley, a couple of cloves, a blade of mace and a pinch of pepper. Simmer it for two hours, pass it through a tammy, take off the fat, and the result should be about a pint-and-a-half of beef gravy. Veal Gravy.—Take two pounds of the leg, knuckle or neck of veal, free from bone. Put it into a stewpan with a half-pint of water, and reduce it slowly to an amber glaze, from time to time turning the meat and piercing it with a knife, to make the juices flow. This is the roasting process. Then for the boiling or simmering, proceed as for beef gravy, perhaps adding an onion. Rich Gravy.—In the foregoing receipts the process of making gravy ought to be clear, and other gravies from other meats may be made in the same way. A very rich gravy is made by combining beef, veal and ham in the first process of reducing the meat to glaze, and in adding a fowl or part of a fowl to the second process of decoction. Cold Gravies.—All these gravies turn to a savoury jelly, and are excellent with roast meat. But if it should be foreseen that they are required for cold meat, the beef gravy may be stiffened by the rind of bacon or ham, and the veal gravy by a calf’s foot. These additions, how- ever, are not to be made until after the first process of roasting the beef or the veal is complete; and they

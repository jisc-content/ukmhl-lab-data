15° Curry useless to insist—indeed, few people see the difficulty. There are good curry-powders at the shops, and that is enough for them. They have not grasped the fact that curry-powder is like salad dressing—a compound ; and that as in the salad dressing some people like plenty of vinegar and little oil, while others wish for plenty of oil and very little vinegar, so in the curry-powder there are ingredients which should be increased or decreased to suit different tastes, and to combine with the different meats which are to be curried.

Take the white heart of a cabbage or a lettuce peeled down to the size of an egg; chop it fine, and add to it two apples in thin slices, the juice of a lemon, a saltspoonful of black pepper, and a tablespoonful of curry-powder—to be all well mixed together. Then take six onions that have been chopped fine and fried brown, a clove of garlic minced small, two ounces of fresh butter, two of flour, and one pint of beef gravy; boil them up, and when boiling add to them

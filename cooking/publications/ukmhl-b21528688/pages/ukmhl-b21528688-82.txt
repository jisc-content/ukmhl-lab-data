58 Beauvilliers serving' the fillet steak invented by the great chef who left the service of the Duchess of Berri to preside over the Hotel Henri Quatre at St. Germains, which is to Paris what the Star and Garter at Richmond is to London. In honour of Henri IV. he named the sauce for his steak (equally good for a mutton chop)—Bearnaise. It is a butter-sauce, and may be described shortly as a hot mayonnaise. Many cooks make a fuss about this sauce, and pretend that it requires a long preparation. It is very simple, as will be seen from the receipt, and can be pro- duced perfectly in a quarter of an hour. The only diffi- culty about it is, that it requires the addition of chopped tarragon, which is not always in season. Bearnaise Sauce is made with yolks of eggs and ounces of butter in equal numbers—say four—as follows. Put the yolks of eggs with one ounce of butter and a little salt and pepper on the fire, and stir them till they begin to thicken. Take them off the fire, add a second ounce of butter, and stir them over the fire for two minutes more. Take them off again for the third ounce, and yet again for the fourth ounce, and proceed as before. Lastly, add a tablespoonful of chopped tarragon, or one of ravigote and a teaspoonful of tarragon vinegar. Beauvilliers, starting in 1782, was for many years the most famous restaurateur in Paris. He was the first to make the restaurant perfect in every detail as we have it now, with an elegant dining-room, with well-appointed tables, with waiters properly attired, in addition to a first- rate cellar and a perfect kitchen. He made and lost his fortune several times over, so that his success was variable; but when lie was at his best no one ever surpassed him in his profession. As he spoke many languages, he was in special favour with foreigners, and he had a rare tact in entertaining his guests. In the latter part of his career (1814) he published in two volumes L'Art du Cuisinier.

463 Turbot Truffes a J Italienne.—Wash and brush them well as before, cut them in slices, and toss them for ten minutes with an ounce of butter, chopped parsley, shalot, and salt. Pour oil the butter, and in return put in a piece of fresh butter, with a ladleful of the best brown gravy, the juice of a lemon, and a sprinkling of cayenne. This is in effect but a variety of the Duxelles originally invented by La \ arenne, only substituting truffles for mushrooms. Turbot has been described as the pheasant of the sea, and is certainly the noblest of the flat fish. According to Yarrell, the great actor and gastronomer Quin “is said to have given it as his opinion that the flesh on the dark-coloured side of the turbot is the best meat; and as examples occasionally occur that are dark-coloured on both sides, some London fishmongers, from experience in their good qualities, recommend such fish as deserving particular attention.” Boiled Turbot.- Let the turbot soak for some little time in cold salt and water, to remove the slime. Then with a knife make an incision down the backbone on the black side,—which is the upper one of the fish in the sea, but its under one on the dish. The object of this cut is to pre- vent the white skin cracking when the turbot begins to heat and to swell in the kettle. It is to be boiled in plenty of cold salt and water—nothing else. Let it come gradually to the boil and thtn let it simmer for half an hour or so. I he time of course is less for a small or chicken turbot, or for one of those slices into which a turbot cuts up with ease. In the h rench receipts an order is often given to cut off the fins that is, the best part of the fish—and to boil it in milk; which sounds well, but is a mistake. When the turbot is ready, dish it on a hot napkin and strew on it and about it parsley leaves and nasturtium flowers. It may be garnished with potatoes, and it is to be served with Dutch, Bearnaise, lobster or shrimp sauce.

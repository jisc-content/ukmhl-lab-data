Blancmange/' 73 cut to pieces and served in syrup which was whitened with milk, rice and almond paste. As late as the days of Madame de Maintenon—that is, at the end of the reign of Louis XIV.—the court physician, Fagon, ordered it to be prepared of the breasts of fowls and almond milk for consumptive patients; and later on, when we come to the article Gallimawfrey, it will be seen that the title of the dish implies a fowl. For the modern receipt, the best and simplest is that of Careme, and depend upon it when Careme is simple he has right upon his side. He is loud in his praise of it, and hazards the prophecy that Blancmanger prepared in his simple way will always be preferred to other creams, and even to the most beautiful jellies, because of the pleasant, nourishing, and soothing qualities of the almond. Unhap- pily for his renown as a prophet, Blancmanger is losing its popularity, because although the almonds may be as good and as loved as ever, the world has ceased to believe in isinglass, and laughs to scorn the gelatine which is too often used instead of it. Blanch a pound of sweet almonds and twenty bitter ones. Pound them in a mortar, moistening them from time to time with half a spoonful of water to keep them from turning to oil. When they are pounded quite smooth, pass them into- a bowl, and mix them with five wineglassfuls of filtered water. Then arrange a napkin over an oval dish, so that the almond milk may be poured into it and strained through it by twisting it at either end. Add twelve ounces of sifted sugar, and when this is dissolved pass the Blanc- manger a second time through the napkin. Next mix into it, somewhat more than warm, an ounce of clarified isin- glass. Last of all pour it into' a mould which has been rubbed with sweet oil of almonds, and which has been settled on ioe. The Blancmanger thus prepared will be de- lightful in itself, but any flavour wished for may be added to it—as rum, lemon, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, strawberry.

Cook.—The truest alchymist and the best physician. M. Ilenrion de Pensey, formerly President of the Court of Cassation, made an observation worthy of a great judge: he made it to Laplace, the great astronomer. ” I regard the discovery of a new dish as a far more inter- esting event than the discovery of a star, for we have

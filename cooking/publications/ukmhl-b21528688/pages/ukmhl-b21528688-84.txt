6o Bechamel at an English table, it belongs to the category of pleasures to be dreamt of. Bacon said that some books are to be read thoroughly, some are to be tasted only, and others may be read by deputy. Unfortunately for us, the beca- fico has to be eaten by deputy and enjoyed in a reverie. Bechamel is a sauce which takes its name from Louis de Bechameil or Bechamel, Marquis de Nointel, who is described as a financier, but is chiefly known as Maitre d’Hotel (Lord Steward of the Household) of Louis XIV. He died in Paris in 1703, and must have been a poor sort of creature if the story which St. Simon tells of him be true. He fancied that he resembled the Comte de Gram- moot, and being- too proud of it, did all he could by dress and manner to nurse the illusion. One day Grammont saw him walking in the Tuileries, and determined to make sport of him. He asked the bystanders what they would bet against his giving a kick to the Marquis de Nointel in what is commonly considered the most honourable part of the body, and against the kick being received as a compli- ment. Bets were made and the kick was given. Bechamel turned round astonished. Grammont hastened to explain that the kick was intended for his nephew—he really landed that it was his nephew lie saw before him. Becha- mel was instantly appeased, and strolled away arm-in-arm with Grammont, to his own great delight, and amid the laughter of the court. A prodigy of meanness, a gigantic parasite, an inspired idiot, this Bechamel invented a sauce which will shed a halo round his name through endless ages. Nothing can be more simple. When once it is described we wonder that it was never thought of before. The white sauce known as Velvet-down is mixed with an equal quantity of cream—that is all, and there is Bechamel. The learnedest of men and the cunningest of cooks had been compassing heaven and earth to find out a new and perfect sauce. It was left for the most fortunate of ninnies

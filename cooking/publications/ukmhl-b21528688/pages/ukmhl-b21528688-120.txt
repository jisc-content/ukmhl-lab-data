g6 Butter as Maitre d’Hotel butter, Ravigote butter, Anchovy butter, Montpellier butter, which will be found described under their proper names. Here it must be enough to enumerate the three simplest preparations of butter for sauce. r. Oiled Butter■—Anybody can make this; and if other sauces fail, it can be got ready in a minute. It is plain fresh butter melted, but not allowed to brown. 1 here is sometimes a milky sediment in the butter which has to be got rid of in the strainer. Add salt in serving the oiled butter. 2. Nut-brown Butter, the French Beurre a la Noisette.— This is fresh butter melted in a small saucepan and allowed not to brown, but to begin to brown. A delicious and very delicate flavour is developed if the butter is whipt oft the fire the moment it begins to roast. The moment the light hazel tinge shows itself, the operation is complete, and you have, especially for fish, one of the most perfect of sauces, to which in serving may be added a squeeze of lemon-juice and a dash of salt. 3. Black Butter—the French Beurre noir, much used for skate, for calf’s brains, and the like. This is a sharp sauce. Proceed as for nut-brown butter, but let the browning go further till the butter becomes dark-brown, though without being burnt. Take the butter from the fire, and next proceed to reduce some vinegar rapidly to about two-thirds of its volume. Mix the butter and the vinegar together, add a little salt and pepper, and pass all through the pointed strainer. It is not necessary to use the best butter for this sauce. Its peculiar flavour would be destroyed in the cooking.

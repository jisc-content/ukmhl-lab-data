199 Galantine that refer to brushwood, hedges and hedging, thorns and figuratively sorrow. Galantine, as we know it, is quite a recent inven- tion. There was a certain Marquis de Brancas, who kept a great kitchen in the end of the last century, at the head of which was a cook named Prevost. The Revolution made an end of the Marquis, extinguished his kitchen fire, and threw Provost out of work. What was the great artist to do? Fortunately the Revolution, though it hated kings and nobles, had a great respect for cooks and loved good cheer. Prevost set his wits to work, and created the galantine of modern times—a new preparation with an old name. He took into partnership with himself Philippe, who afterwards became celebrated for his restaurant in the Rue Montorgueil. For fifteen years they made galantines together, and sold them to the Parisians under the Re- public, the Directory, the Consulate, the Empire. About 1805, when Nelson was sweeping the seas and culminating in Trafalgar, when Napoleon was traversing Europe and culminating the field of Austerlitz-—the fame of the galan- tine rose to its height, and Paris was informed that it had changed its domicile. The possession of the galantine was sold to M. Perrier—a pastrycook in the Rue Montorgueil. Provost went out of the business altogether, but it was arranged that Philippe should continue to construct the galantines which Perrier was to sell. Between them they brought the galantine into fashion, and achieved for it a great position—indeed, the very highest position among cold viands. The reader who expects a receipt for making galantine in this place will be disappointed. One might as well give a receipt for making a Bologna sausage, a Strasborg pie, or turtle soup. These are dainties which belong to spe- cialists, and are not fit for ordinary kitchens. To make a galantine well, you must make a business of it, and it is much the best way to go to M.

354 Plum Pudding Plum Sauce.—Stone about a pint of Orleans plums, and stir them to a mash over a brisk fire, with a quarter-pint of water and a quarter-pound of sugar. Then pass them through a sieve, and use them as a sauce for pudding. Other plums may be used in the same way—not to speak of peaches, nectarines and apricots. Plum Pudding.—A pound and a half of combined flour and breadcrumbs; a pound and a half of chopped suet; a pound and a half of combined raisins (stoned) and cur- rants ; three-quarters of a pound of sugar; three-quarters of a pint of combined milk and eggs (say six eggs and the rest milk); three wineglassfuls of brandy; a quarter of a pound of chopped apples; a quarter of a pound of candied peel; half a teaspoonful of salt; half a nutmeg; half an ounce of mixed spice. Mix all thoroughly, tie it up in a floured cloth, put it into boiling water, and let it boil from five to six hours. These proportions will make two good- sized puddings, each of which will require to be boiled for the time given. Punch sauce. Poele is a word much used in the French kitchen. It means a frying-pan; but originally it meant any small saucepan, and afterwards it was made to signify the con- tents of the saucepan, or at least the array of vegetables and condiments which were put into it for seasoning. In this sense, or indeed in any sense, the term has dropped out of the English language, but we find it five hundred years ago. In the Forme of Cury there is a receipt for “Hares in Papdele,” which has greatly puzzled antiquarians. It is a corruption of “Hares in Padell.” The Latin word for a saucepan was patella, which became padell in Old English, and pa£le, afterwards po61e, in French. The assortment of vegetables which the French now under- stand by a po61e will be found among the Faggots— a Faggot of Pot-herbs.

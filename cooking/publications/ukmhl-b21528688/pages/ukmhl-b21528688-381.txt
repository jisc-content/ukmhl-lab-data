Potato 357 will have them sent to the table as they are—in their skins. Ordinary mortals have them peeled before being served. The English way. Choose them all of a size, peel them, and remove the eyes and other specks; cover them with cold water (but there is to be no salt at this stage), and simmer them very gently—the slower the better. They have to be watched very carefully towards the last, to see that they do not boil a minute more than is necessary, —and this can only be ascertained by probing with a fork. Pour off all the water, strew salt on the potatoes, and leave the pot uncovered by the fire, shaking it from time to time till the potatoes seem all dry and floury. Potatoes Browned—with roast meat.—Peel them, parboil them, drain them, flour them, and put them in an earthen dish into the dripping pan under the meat. Baste them freely from time to time, and when they are browned on one side turn them. Fried Potatoes.—Kidney potatoes are best for this pur- pose, and a kettleful of beef fat. But in English kitchens the fried potatoes are very uncertain, because they are cut in too thin slices; also because they are done in a flat frying-pan, with a sparing supply of butter or dripping. Instead of cutting the potatoes, like the English, into shil- lings, French cooks cut them into square plugs, about the length and thickness of the little finger. These are put into a wire basket and dipped into the kettle of boiling fat, where they remain for five minutes, and are shaken from time to time—the kettle resting on the stove, with only its edge on the stove fire. During these five minutes, how- ever, the fat has been cooling, partly through the coldness of the potatoes immersed in it, partly through the kettle being removed from the central heat of the stove fire to its edge. Therefore, at the end of five minutes, take out the wire basket, and put the frying-kettle over the stove fire, to heat up. Take it off again so as to rest as before on

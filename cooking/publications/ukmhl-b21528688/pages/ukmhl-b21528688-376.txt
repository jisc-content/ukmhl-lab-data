352 Pimento almost to the nobleness of a salmon-trout, the pilchard, with all his fatness, begins to spoil much too soon after he has bidden adieu to his native element; and he is by no means sublime—he is even rancid—when he reaches the glorious Walhalla of fish in Billingsgate. Whenever a pilchard is found fresh he is to be cooked as a herring of high degree. His season is between July and Christmas.

Mark well, and let the gardener and the cook take heed that this pimpernel is not pimpernel in England, but burnet. Pintail, to be treated as widgeon or wild duck.

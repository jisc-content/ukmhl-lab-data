158 Dill Dili, is a plant which, like anise, caraway and coriander, was supposed to be a good stomachic. Dill-water is still to be found among the bottles of the apothecary. It was also, like fennel, a good deal used in soups and sauces. That we should now make very little use of it in the kitchen is probably no great loss to us; but it is certainly a mystery. It is impossible to tell many a time how repu- tations grow and how they pass away. By all the rules of human conduct dill ought to be ihe most prized herb in the English kitchen garden; and yet it is of the smallest account. William the Conqueror had a cook named Tezelin, who one day served him with a white soup called dillegrout.

When a great work of art is thus rewarded we might expect that the fame of it would live for ever, that all the cooks of Eng- land would bear it in mind, and that it would still be fashionable. But such is the caprice of fame and fortune, there is probably not a living creature in England who has ever tasted dill broth, and the name of Tezelin is known but to a very few. There are monuments in Westminster Abbey to heroes who have achieved less than the Lord of the Manor of Addington. Dinner.—There are two theories as to what this means.

There is an old French rhyme to this effect:— Lever k six, diner A dix, Souper k six, coucher k dix, Vous feront vivre dix fois dix. It is evident that we are fast returning to the ancient

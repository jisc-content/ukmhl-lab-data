Verjuice 480 and if fat, all the art of the roaster is to be directed to nursing the fat. The venison is to be well kept—a fortnight at least, and when about to be cooked should be lightly sponged with warm water, and then dried with a cloth. Then lay over the fat a sheet of buttered writing- paper—which tie on and butter on the outside once more. Over this lay a paste of flour and water which has been rolled out about half an inch thick. Cover this again with two sheets of buttered paper, and tie all securely with twine. Lay the venison in a cradle-spit, before a strong, clear fire, and basting it constantly, let it roast for four hours. Twenty minutes before it is ready it must be unswathed. Baste the meat in every part with butter; sprinkle some salt on it; dredge in a little flour; and place it nearer the fire to brown and froth.

For some purposes, indeed, it is better than lemon-juice—as, for example, in taking off the flatness of apples or pears, and adding to the sharpness of pies. Prepare it as follows :—Choose ripe crab-apples and lay them in a heap to sweat. Pick away the stalks and any

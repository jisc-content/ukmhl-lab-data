37o Radish Radish.—Not a word against the radish. Still, it may be lawful to record that it is not of much use in cookery, whatever it may be in eating. May I also venture to say that it is a mistake in a salad—an intrusion; and that the only way to get rid of it is to nibble it by itself while waiting for the feast, or in any convenient interlude.

Perhaps the nearest word is ragofit—which means something tasted again; but the French are so little fond of it, as the name of a stew, that they dismiss it whenever and however they can find a substitute, Thus a stew of

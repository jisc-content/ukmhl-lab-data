Love in Disguise 282 slow but sure old judge, who started in life with a roman- tic marriage—running away with his bride. He was devoted to liver and bacon, and whenever he dined with George IV. the cook had orders to have always ready a dish of them. Here we find that whereas a diet of bacon made Lope de Vega a dramatist, the combination of bacon with liver fixed Lord Eldon ever more and more firmly on the woolsack. These little contrarieties have to be studied, and a vast field of science opens before us. Love in Disguise is a calf’s heart stuffed, then sur- rounded with forcemeat, next rolled in vermicelli, lastly deposited in a baking dish with a little butter, and sent to the oven. Serve it in the dish with its own gravy. ACARON1 is in England a common name given to many preparations of Italian paste, as well as to that particular kind which Theodore Hook described as “tobacco-pipes made easy. ” We are not too well acquainted with the technical names for the ribbons, lozenges, ruffles, straws and strings into which this pleasant paste is formed, and for all the nice varieties of Genoese and Neapolitan manufacture. Even vermicelli would be classed in an English kitchen among the macaronis—which is the oldest known name for the species. In Chaucer’s time the English name was macrow, and it was applied especially to little balls or puddings of paste. Macaroni is a form of wdieat-flour—a bread, in fact— so palatable, so cheap, and so easily managed in cookery, that it is a wonder to see it so little used in this country. Macaroni and cheese is the most digestible form in which bread and cheese can be presented—the only form in which many weak vessels can tolerate it.

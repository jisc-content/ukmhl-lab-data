It is with the soft roes—the milt, the laitance—that the cook has to do. Ragout of Soft Roes.—A favourite relish of the French kitchen. See Relish No. 8. Erasmus’ Soup.—The great scholar had a taste, and his name is given to a soup in which the soft roes figure. Take ten soil roes of the herring, and cook them for ten minutes in water, sait, and a little vinegar. Then pass them into salt and water for a time, to get rid of the vinegar taste. Drain them, cut them in two, and heat them up in a sufficient quantity of clear broth or double broth, either with a quart of young peas or with crusts of bread and a spoonful of blanched and chopped fennel. Roe Toast.—Slices of buttered toast with the soft roes of fresh bloaters arranged upon them.

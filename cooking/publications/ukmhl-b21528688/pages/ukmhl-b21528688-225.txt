The F orme of Cury is especially valuable. It was compiled by the master-cooks of Richard II., assisted by all the doctors of philosophy and men of taste who took an interest in the elaborate gastrology of that court.

Known throughout Europe as Richard of Bordeaux because, the English dominion then including Gascony, he was born there, and his father the Black Prince there held the seat of English Government in France, we are told by his cooks and the doctors who worked with them that he “ was accounted the best and ryallest viander of all Christian kings.” It is to the early part of his reign, and all the luxury of it as described in the chronicles, that the poet Gray refers in the lines which have almost passed into proverbs : Fair laughs the morn and soft the zephyr blows, While, proudly riding on the azure realm, In gallant trim the gilded vessel goes, Youth on the prow and pleasure at the helm. The common tradition is that Richard died of hunger ; but while he reigned he had in his kitchen a staff of several hundred cooks; he entertained at his table 10,000 coin tiers and followers, for whom were killed every day 28 oxen and 300 sheep, besides innumerable quantities of fowl and game. All the care and skill which the wealth and knowledge of the time could command were expended on the preparation of the viands. The cleverest cooks, the learncdest doctors, and the daintiest courtiers, put their heads together to range the earth for curious food, to invent new dishes, and to treasure up the most approved receipts

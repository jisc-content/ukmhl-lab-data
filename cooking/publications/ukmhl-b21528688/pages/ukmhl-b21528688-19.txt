DEDICATION TO FIRST EDITION. TO GEORGE AUGUSTUS SALA. One of the most accomplished men of his time., the readiest of writers, the rarest of humourists, a most winning orator, a most cunning draughtsman, laden with a learn- ing which would crush most men, and blest with a heart which is almost that of a iwoman ; he probably knows more about the history of cookery in all countries of the world than any man alive, and to him therefore these pages are inscribed with sincere admiration.

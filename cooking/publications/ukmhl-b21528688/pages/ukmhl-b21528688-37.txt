Introduction l3 there in a wrong word so long as the dish is good ? We eat the food and not the name.” But this is to mistake human nature. A hungry taste is apt to be querulous, and resents disappointment. Also there is a peculiar fastidiousness in what has never yet been thoroughly analyzed—that peculiar condition known as Acquired taste. Perhaps there is no such thing in persons who are grown up as a perfectly pure and natural taste. The taste may be sound and even fine, but it is always more or less influenced by custom and by association, until it breeds an Acquired taste which is not to be reasoned with and which will not be denied. 1 he Greenlander takes to tallow; the southern Frenchman glories in garlic; the East Indian is mighty in pepper. No force of reasoning can prove to them that other tastes are better; they have an Acquired taste which insists on being pampered. And precisely the same phenomenon occurs, though in a less marked wav, when we get a dish which we know, which we expect, and which does not correspond to its name. A very pleasant Julienne soup can be made without sorrel ; but those who look for the sorrel always feel that without it the Julienne is a failure. An acquired taste has been cieated, which suffers under disappointment as cruelly as when the Greenlander is deprived of his whale- blubber, the Gascon of his garlic, and the East Indian of his curry. Bad as it is, however, it is not on the perfidy or the pi etension of wrong names that it is most necessary to insist. The great wrong about them is that they are a bai to all chance of science and of progress in cookery. Aii idea has got abroad and has been much fostered by French authorities, that cookery as practised by the gi eat artists is perfect, and that there is nothing more to be done except to ring the changes on what these artists ha\ e achieved. It is probable enough that we shall not get many more new foods or combinations of savour;

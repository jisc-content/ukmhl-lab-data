Custards 151 the other set of ingredients containing the acids and spices. Let all be well stewed, and then add to it—cut or shred— the fish, flesh or fowl for which this savoury mess has been prepared. Serve it with abundance of rice-—every grain of which should be separate. It is the rice in this combina- tion that is the great attraction for many people. But in following this receipt the cook must use some discretion; first in regard to the acids, second in regard to the onions. One apple may contain as much acid as two>; and onions are of all sizes. So that here the reoeipt is very indefinite, and the cook has to be cautious. Custards.—These have been known for some time on the Continent as English creams; but latterly simply as creams—vanilla cream, lemon cream, chocolate cream, according to the flavour. One receipt will be enough. Lemon Custard.—Beat up the yolks of eight eggs to a strong white cream. Mix into this very slowly a pint of boiling hot cream, together with the zest and juice of two lemons, and sugar to taste. Stir this on the fire till it thickens—but do not boil it. Add also, when nearly ready, a wineglassful of sherry and a tablespoonful of brandy. Keep stirring it till it cools, and serve it in cups with grated nutmeg. A wonderful flavour is given to these creams or custards by boiling the cream or milk with which they are made a laurel-leaf—that is, not a bay-leaf, but a leaf of the cherry laurel. Great care, however, must be used; for the cherry laurel is poisonous.

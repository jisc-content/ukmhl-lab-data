Gall hn a wfrey 2 10 the time, and when we expect to read for the title of it Hashed Goose, or something equivalent, we find the enigma of Sauce Madame. Why this meaningless French title? The title first appears in a French cookery book—that of Taillevent, which was written twenty or thirty years before the cooks of Richard of Bordeaux set to work; and we may therefore conclude that it was the attempt of a Frenchman to give some appearance of sense to an older English title—Malachi—which had become dark to the English, and to Frenchmen wholly unmeaning. The same thing occurred in the case of the Sauce Robert. The English cooks had their Roebroth or Roebrewit—that is, a stew of roebuck with a peculiar sauce. The French cook Taillevent did not understand the word, determined to put a meaning into it, and made it Robert. So we have now the Sauce Robert as something distinct from Roebuck Sauce. We have next to deal with Miching Malicho. It will be remembered that before the mimic play begins in Hamlet, there is a dumb show in which the spectators are treated to a revelation of the murder which had been committed and of the love which the murderer made to the dead man s wife. There occurs the following dialogue Ophelia.—What means this, my lord? Hamlet.—Marry, this is miching malicho : it means mischief. Ophelia.—Belike this show imports the argument of the play. Ophelia answers, and answers truly, her own question : but what is the meaning of Hamlet’s answer? The explanation of the commentators is far from satisfactory. Ihey say that mich is an old English verb meaning to lurk, and that there is a Spanish word malheco meaning a crime. Ham- let’s reply therefore would come to the truism—“Marry, this is hidden crime, and crime means mischief.” The explanation is not so satisfactory that we are bound to accept it, and I venture to suggest another—“Marry, this is cooking the goose; it means mischief.” The difficulty

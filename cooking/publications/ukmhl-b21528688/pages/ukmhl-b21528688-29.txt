Introduction 5 ♦ but the ingredients were mixed together in the kitchen, and served up as Sauce Robert. It was simply a mash of onions well browned in butter, with the addition of some French mustard, containing, it is needless to say, tarragon vinegar, the acid of which takes the place of the apple in the parallel English arrangement. Simple as it is, it would be difficult, by the most elaborate devices, to concoct a sauce better suited for its purpose and more relished. The receipt for it will be found, in all its simplicity, in the classical work of Beauvilliers— the first cookery book which had any pretension to scientific accuracy. But ask for the Sauce Robert at clubs and restaurants, whether in Paris or London : it is impossible to recognise it in the liquid which is now served under its name. The 81 eat chefs cannot rest content with the simplicity of the old leceipt. 1 hey glory in high art and all the wonders of science; and they have improved upon the sauce until its fine gusto is lost in a weak civilisation. The Sauce Kobeit was bountiful in its onions—indeed, illimitable. In the sauce of the modern Boulevards the quantity is i educed . onions are not polite enough—and sometimes they are intermingled with chopped gherkins. In the Sauce Robei t there wras no thought of wine or ketchup, nor any thought of vinegar beyond the little tarragon vinegai involved in French mustard. But one set of aitists (Bernard, Dubois, and Gouffe at their head) now load it with wine, and even ketchup; another set (Franca- telli at their head) drench it with vineg'ar, making it a kind of Sharp sauce; while there are cookery books whose writers think that they cannot have too much of a good thing, and drown the sauce in wine and ketchup as w ell as vinegar. If cooks wish to invent a new sauce, let them give it a new name; and if diners want to have with their pork-chops a sharp sauce like that served on the Boulevards, let them have it—the taste is intelligible.

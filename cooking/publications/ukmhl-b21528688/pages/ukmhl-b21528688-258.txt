234 Halibut few come to London, but they appear not unfrequently in Paris under the name of merluche or sea pike—which English visitors take to mean haddock. The French name for a haddock is not merluche, but aigrefin, sometimes spelt aiglefin. The hake has a peculiarity which gives him a certain superiority over the haddock, and indeed over all fish—it is easy to get rid of his backbone. After the fish is opened and cleaned, as all fish of this kind are, take his backbone, from where it begins, between the finger and thumb. Slide finger and thumb along the edges of the bone down the body as far as it has been opened. The bone can then be drawn out quite free from the flesh. You have there- fore a fish which, as the fins can easily be removed, is all fish and no bone, and which can be manipulated in a soup, in a stew, in cutlets, in curry, with an ease delightful to those who are afraid of fish bones. Halibut, or Holibut.—The praise of this flat-fish has been sung by a true poet—Cowper, who grew rapturous over one sent to him by a friend, and named immortal probably because it was large and lasted a long time. To save the reputation of the poet, let us remember that at a period when people made their wills before they left home on a short journey, he lived in an inland village where any kind of fish would naturally enough be a rare luxury. The most fitting appellation which has been given to the halibut is—workhouse turbot. To do the creature justice, however, he makes a good curry. Ham.—Good, boiled; better, baked; best of all, roasted. But roast ham is rare because it is difficult; baked ham is easier, and boiled easiest of all. Boiled Ham.—Soak an English ham for twenty-four, a Spanish one forty-eight hours. Scrape it and cleanse it carefully. Boil it or braze it in liquor and seasoning enough to cover it. For very simple tastes water alone is used,

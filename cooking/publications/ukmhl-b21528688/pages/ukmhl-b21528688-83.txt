59 Becafico It was the best cookery book that had ever been pub- lished—simple, methodical and exact. It is now out of date, but it may stiil be consulted with advantage. Careme was very jealous O'f the book, and he and his follow- ing were fond of pointing out that its author was no great cook. Beauvilliers, though an admirable manager, may not have been a great cook, but still his work is of immense authority. Nestor Roqueplan has asserted, but I know not on what grounds, that lie was assisted in its pre- paration by Brillat-Savarin. Ihe book is a great landmark in the history of the kitchen.

We should say that Beauvilliers was more remarkable for judgment and Careme for invention—that Beauvilliers exhausted the old world of art and Careme discovered a new one—that Beauvilliers rigidly adhered to the unities and Careme snatched a grace beyond them—that there was more aplomb in the touch of Beauvilliers, more curious felicity in Caremc’s—that Beauvilliers was greait in an entre and Careme sublime in an entremet—that we would bet Beau- villiers against the world for a r6t; but should wish Careme to prepare the sauce were we under the necessity of eating up an elephant or our grandfather.” Becafico.—The fig-pecker, a small bird something like a nightingale which feeds on figs and grapes, that give to its flesh in the autumn a peculiar delicacy. It has been said that if the becafico were only as big as a pheasant it would be worth an acre of land. As it is rarely to be seen

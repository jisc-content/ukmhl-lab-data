4 Introduction 48 Cold Entrees, dished up on silver plates. 6 Groups of plovers’ eggs, garnished with aspic jelly. 6 Plates of cold roast fowls with aspic jelly (cut up). 6 Plates of tongue in slice's, garnished with aspic jelly. 6 Lobster salads. 6 Mayonnaises of fowl. 6 Mayonnaises of fillets of salmon. 6 Entrees of lamb cutlets a la Bellevue. 6 Entrees of chaud-froid fri- casse of chicken. 36 cold roast fowls and 4 tongues, to be kept in reserve for the purpose of replenishing these entrees as they are eaten.

And this is the lesult of science—this the height of art. It produces, with such elaborate forms and majestic ceremonies, an aspic jelly without aspic, that, exhausted in the effort, it can pro- ceed no further, and seems to think that here at last, in this supreme sauce, we have a sure resting-place the true blessedness—the ewigkeit. Too much art in cookery may be as fatal as too little ; and it is impossible to read some of the receipts of the master-cooks without wishing that they could foiget high art and come down to common sense. For an odd illustration, take the sauce which is called Robert— originally a Roebuck sauce, now a sauce for broiled or roasted pork and for goose. Its history will be found under its proper name.

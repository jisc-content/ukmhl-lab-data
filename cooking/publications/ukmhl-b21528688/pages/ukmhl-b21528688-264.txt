240 Haricot turned it into beef. When the name of roast beef came to France the French did not recognise their own word, and for two hundred years they have been speaking of rosbif dâ€™agneau and rosbif de mouton. It is not merely the ignorant who fall into such a locution : men of educa- tion, with a fine ear for the delicacies of language, such as Jules Janin, will adopt the blunder with childish sim- plicity. Now this is what has happened to them in a blunder of lower depth with regard to their word ragout. It came back to them altered from the German frontier,' and they altogether failed to recognise it. It came back to them pronounced as ricot. The vowel changes can easily be explained, and will scarcely be surprising to us who have transmuted bceuf into beef. The only change of conso- nant, the hardening of g into c, is characteristic of the pronunciation of French on the Rhine. So far there is no difficulty. The difficulty arises when we have to account for the initial syllable of haricot. It has been shown by Mr. Max Muller that there are many words aspirated in French purely through the contageous in- fluence of the German pronunciation. Thus the Latin word altus ought to be in modern French aut: it is liaut through contagion of the German hoch. Again the Latin ululare ought to be in French urler, or as in old French idler: it was huller and it is hurler through contagion of the German heulen. But more than this : the word we are considering begins with r, to which the Germans gave such a strong guttural pronunciation that it might be represented in writing as hricot : and the French caught this up as haricot or hericot. There is a case in point. The French have adopted the German word rang and have caught it up quite correctly- But they have also caught it up wrongly. The guttural pronuncia- tion of the German r made the word sound like hrang, and they caught it up as harangue. So rang and harangue, which are a't root one and the same word, exist in modern

2/4 Leek sauces and give them character. Still these leasons have their appointed place, and Grimod had a right to add, “ The art of leasons is one of the great secrets of the kitchen; for the grand point is not to make the sauces thick, but unctuous, and to bind together all the parts of a ragout so that no one shall dominate.” 1. Leas on of Flour.—This may be dredged into the sauce by itself; but sometimes, to make sure of escaping knots, the flour may be mixed with water, milk, or broth, and passed through a strainer. Arrowroot is sometimes better than flour. 2. Leason of Roux is made of butter and flour—twice as much flour as butter.

Cucumber H5 CroOte-au-pot.—A clear soup which may have nothing but crusts in it, but generally has an assortment of the more homely vegetables. See Brunoise. Cruet is a better word than the French vinaigrette, to express what the French mean by that term—a vinegar and oil sauce, in which the oil predominates. Cruet is a little cruise—it may be for oil or vinegar or anything else; but to most English ears the word cruise will instantly suggest the widow’s cruise of oil which was always full— and that is the sort of cruise most needed for the sauce which the French name Vinaigrette. Mix well in a bowl or saucer three tablespoonfuls of oil, not more than one of vinegar—perhaps less, a pinch of salt, and a little pepper, black or white. We call this the French salad mixture, but it is much better known in connection with the Spanish proverb which says that we ought to be spendthrifts of the oil, misers of the vinegar, counsellors in regard to salt—and which is silent as to pepper. The Italians are so- chary of salt in this mixture that they have a proverb—“ insalata ben salata. ” The worth of the sauce turns chiefly on the proportion of oil to vinegar, and this must depend a good deal on the nature of the vinegar selected—whether of malt, of wine or of tarragon. Judiciously made, the cruet sauce is delicious without any further addition, and goes magnificently with salmon hot or cold, turbot, calf’s head, and other viands, as well as with salads. But it is usual to add a garniture. For salads the garniture is a chopped ravigote, or else spring onions and parsley chopped. For calf’s head add mustard with a garniture of chopped parsley, capers, and shalots. For fish, chopped parsley. Cucumber.—Raw.—The cucumber is peeled, sliced, and served in a cruet sauce. But on the Continent it is usual, before the sauce is poured on the slices, to sprinkle them well with salt, and to let them lie in this pickle for two- 10

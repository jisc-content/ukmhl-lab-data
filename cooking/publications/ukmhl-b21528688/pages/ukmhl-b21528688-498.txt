Veal 474 should have to be breadcrumbed, it is rolled in crumbs after being smeared with oil or melted butter; and in France no eggs are used for this purpose. With the cutlet—thus broiled—may be served a piece of maitre d’hotel butter, some tomato sauce, or a sharp sauce. Veal Cutlets of Dreux.—It is not very much to the credit of veal that it has to be in most cases combined carefully with savoury adjuncts—forcemeat, bacon, tongue. The cutlets of Dreux are larded with bacon, tongue and truffles; fried for two or three minutes in butter; then . stewed in a Mirepoix of white wine further diluted with an equal quantity of veal broth. Serve the cutlets on a puree of sorrel or of turnips, or on French beans; then skim the gravy, and strain it over all. Veal Cutlets a la Milanaise are generally breadcrumbed —either in the French way without, or in the English way with, eggs. They are then fried or tossed in butter. In being served they are garnished with slices of truffle and of tongue (the latter punched into rounds), and—most important of all—with macaroni which has been tossed for a moment with grated cheese; and a little tomato sauce plays round the dish. Veal Pie.—Take the back ribs or neck, get rid of all bone—which should never enter into a pie—and trim the meat into small collops. At the same time cut some streaky bacon into thin slices. Fry the veal and the bacon with a faggot of Duxelles in about an ounce of butter. Then lay them in order in a pie-dish intermixed with forcemeat balls and hard-boiled yolks of egg—it may be also with a scalded sweetbread cut into pieces. Let all be seasoned with pepper and salt, and moistened with half a pint of gravy, to which the juice of half a lemon may be added. Cover it with paste; bake it for an hour or an hour and a quarter; and when the pie is done, lift the top ornament and pour in some good gravy.

326 Oysters to imitate them. Blanch and beard the oysters—some dozens. Then put them into a stewpan with their own liquor, a little butter, some chopped parsley, some pepper, and a glass of Chablis. Take out the oysters and put them into the shells; at the same time reducing the sauce and adding to it a leason of two yolks and some lemon-juice. Pour the sauce over the oysters intermingled with fine breadcrumbs, heap breadcrumbs over all, bedew them with melted butter, and brown them before the fire in a Dutch oven, or in baking tins in an ordinary oven.

There is a story of Brillat-Savarin told by Talleyrand and reported by Hayward. He was on his way to Lyons, and proposed to dine at Sens. On his arrival he sent for the cook and asked what there was for dinner. The cook had very little to offer, and M. Savarin determined to go to the kitchen to see for himself. In the kitchen he found four turkeys roasting. “What is this?” he said. “You told me you had nothing in the-house. Let me have one of these turkeys.” “Impossible,” was the reply; “they are all bespoken for a gentleman upstairs.5” “He must have a large party to need four turkeys.” “No,” said the cook, “he dines by himself.” “How I should like to see the man who orders four turkeys for his own eating!” Brillat-Savarin went to pay his respects to the stranger, and found his own son. “What, you rogue, four turkeys all to yourself!” “\es, sir,” said the son : “you know that whenever I dine with you, you eat up all the oysters; I was resolved to enjoy myself once in a way—and here I am.”

, 424 Sheep’s Head Broth of vinegar. Stir this over the fire till the vinegar is reduced—and, indeed, till the shalots absorb the whole of it that is left, which will be indicated by the butter becoming clear. Then add an ounce of flour, and a pint of broth, together with pepper, and it may be salt—but this will depend on the saltness of the broth. Let it boil for a quarter of an hour, and let it be skimmed. Lastly, add the parsley and gherkins. Boil it up again, and if need be, skim again. Sheep’s Head Broth (the grand Scotch receipt).— A sheep’s head and trotters are singed, and are usually sent for this purpose to a blacksmith’s forge. They might be singed with a red-hot iron in the kitchen, but it makes a smell which is apt to steal through the house. After singeing they are soaked in cold water or in several waters for two hours ; and afterwards lightly scraped and trimmed so as to remove excess of blackness, though without de- stroying that burnt flavour which the singeing is meant to produce. The head is then to be split and to be rubbed over with the brains. Put the head and the trotters on the fire with two gallons of cold water and half a pound of Scotch barley. Add pepper and salt, take off the scum as it rises, and simmer it for at least four hours. When it is about half done throw in a pint of carrots cut into dice. An hour before it is ready put in the same allowance of turnips, together with some chopped onions—in summer-time a few green peas. The soup may be served at once. The sheep’s head, by universal consent, is best cold. In every manse throughout Scotland the minister eats sheep’s head broth on Saturday while he is preparing his sermon, and cold sheep’s head for his Sunday dinner. That is why the sermons of the Kirk are so good. As for the trotters, though they improve the soup, they cannot be eaten cold, and it is best to seivc them separately in a Poulette sauce.

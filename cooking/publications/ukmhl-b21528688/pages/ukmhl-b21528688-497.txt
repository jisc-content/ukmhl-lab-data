Veal 473 sauce, garnish the roast with the Financier’s or the Toulouse Ragout. (See Relishes Nos. i and 2). Roast Veal a la Creme.—When, as described in the fore-going receipt, the buttered paper is to be removed from the joint about twenty minutes before it is completely roasted, it is no more to be basted with butter, but either with a pint of rich cream, or of Bechamel, which is half cream. This will form upon the roast a delicate golden crust, which must be carefully handled in transferring the veal from the spit to its dish. For a sauce, take some Bechamel, mix with it the brown which has fallen from the roast in basting- it with cream, and some stewed button mushrooms, together with their juice. Veal Cutlets.—In England the most common way of cooking them is called the French way. In France it is called the English way. It is also called i la Zingara. The cutlets are taken from the back ribs or loin; or some- times they are simply small collops from the fillet. But there is not a word to be said against the small cutlets from the neck. Let them be nicely trimmed and freed from fat, egged, breadcrumbed and fried. It is the egging and breadcrumbing that is supposed to be peculiarly English. Let there be slices of bacon or else of tongue to correspond in number with the cutlets—the bacon to be grilled or fried, the tongue to be heated in stock. For a sauce, take the butter in which the cutlets have fried, dredge it with flour, and add to it a little broth and juice of mushrooms, together with lemon-juice and salt. In the French way of doing these cutlets—a la Zingara—they are fried without being egged and breadcrumbed. Veal Cutlets broiled.—This is the true French way—the most simple of all. Take a cutlet from the neck; trim it well of bone, gristle, and skin, and flatten it with a cutlet bat. Sprinkle it with pepper and salt, brush it with oil or melted butter, and send it to the grill. If this cutlet

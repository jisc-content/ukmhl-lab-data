Rabbits 36 9 ABBITS.—St. Evremond, about two hundred years ago, praised the rabbits of England as incomparable. Now the Ostend rabbit has the great name. Of the wild rabbit, Grimod de la Reyni£re says that “its flesh is whiter, more tender, and more juicy than that of the hare, and when young it is delicate and easily digested. Nourished on thyme, wild thyme, and marjoram, barded with bacon, and cooked to the proper point, it perfumes the mouth and inundates the palate with delights. As for tame rabbits, we insist on their proscription; for ever since Despreaux, these game of the stableyard, elev^s dans Paris, Sentent encore le chou dont ils furent nourris.” The young rabbit or cony (connil) has given his name to the most delicate of the forcemeats, the Quenelle; and there is an excellent Rabbit Soap made after the manner of the Queen’s Chicken broth—the Potage ci la Reine. Smothered Rabbit.—This is the name given in England to boiled rabbit. It is smothered with a white onion sauce, and it is served with boiled bacon. Fricassee of Rabbit is done in the same way as fricassee of chicken. Gibelote of Rabbit.—Put a quarter of a pound of butter into a stewpan with a spoonful of flour; make a white roux of them, and pass in it for a short time the rabbit cut into pieces, and some bacon cut into dice. Then add some small onions, some mushrooms, a faggot of sweet-herbs, pepper and salt, and moisten all with half broth, half white wine (French). Let all cook slowly till it is nearly ready, then briskly, to reduce the liquid. Remove the faggot and the fat from the gibelote, and serve it piping hot. 24

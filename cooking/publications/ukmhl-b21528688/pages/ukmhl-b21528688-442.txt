418 Sauce white sauce to be produced by decoction alone, so as to keep it quite free from any of the igneous flavours; what, then, is the object of tampering with it by putting into it an ingredient whose special value is that it has an igneous taste of a certain kind? Because two and a half cen- turies ago a French cook discovered that a Spanish ham mightily improved the savour of his brown sauce, we have slices of ham put into every soup and sauce and stew served at a grand dinner. See the far-reaching and un- expected consequences of great events. Because early in the last century the blood royal of France and of Spain intermingled, a Jew cannot now feast with the Lord Mayor on the ninth of November without trembling for his soul, and much smiting of conscience. 1 picture to myself the perplexity and despair of the greatest cook of this century, Careme, who left the service of the Prince Regent in England to take office in the household of Baron Rothschild in Paris. All the traditions of his art assured him that soups and sauces are nothing without ham—that ham is the trumpet obligato in the symphony of a sauce -—and ham was denied to him. It was due to the genius of Careme that the Baron’s dinner-table became the most refined in Europe; but it did not require the genius of Careme to prove that the absence of ham in the sauces made no difference. The following is an alphabetical list of the sauces described in this volume :— Allemande. Almond cream. Anchovy. Anchovy butter. Apple. Arrowroot. Aspic. Aurora. B^arnaise. Bechamel. Cold Bechamel.

300 The Lady Mayonnaise gouverner. About the spelling we need not trouble be- cause of its extreme laxity; the Mahonneuse of modern French spelling might very easily be Mahonnaise in the old corrupt and diversified Provencal pronunciation; it will not confound any one who catches the analogy in Trouveur and Trouvere. The real difficulty is in the sense. Unable to make a likely adjective from the verb, we have made a feminine noun—and what have we gained? We have gained a noun which curiously and unexpectedly fits into what is more than a tradition like Careme's tradition of the kitchen—it is a historical fact. We have gained a sudden and undesigned coinci- dence which is one of the tests of truth. In the olden time a salad was mixed by pretty women, and they did it with their hands. This was so well understood that down at least to the time of Rousseau (Littre gives a quotation from the Nouvelle Heloise, vi. 2), the phrase retourner la salade avec les doigts was used to describe a woman as being still young and beautiful. “ Dans le si&cle dernier,” are Littre’s own words—“ les jeunes femmes retournaient la salade avec les doigts; cette locu- tion a disparu avec 1’usage lui-meme. ” And this is the meaning of the feminine noun. A feminine adjective, if such could be found, would present no difficulties ; it would neces- sarily be Sauce Mahonnaise. But if a likely adjective from the verb mahonner is impossible, and we have only a noun to fall back upon, why not Mahonneur—a man who fatigues the salad? It is Mahonneuse or Mahonnaise—a woman, because it was she in her youth and beauty who fatigued the sauce; it was she who with her fingers fatigued the salad. If these considerations be well founded, the proper name for the sauce is not Sauce Mayonnaise, but Sauce k la Mayonnaise—or still more simply La Mayonnaise. And we can now see why the word is more often used as a noun than as an adjective.

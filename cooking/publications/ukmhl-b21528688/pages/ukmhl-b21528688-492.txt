468 Vatel dried to effloresce upon it in fine needles; but Pereira declares that the precise nature of the odorous principle has not been satisfactorily made out. Be that as it may, it is doubtful whether vanilla would have for its mere odour, which can easily be imitated, the extraordinary acceptance which it now enjoys. It is supposed to have extraordinary virtues, to promote digestion, to exhilarate the mind, to increase muscular energy, and, in a large dose, to be one of the most powerful aphrodisiacs. Very little, however, of the best kind comes to Europe. When ripe the fruit yields from two to six drops of a liquid with an exquisite odour, which i's said to possess the above-named virtues in perfection ; but not a drop of it comes to this side of the Atlantic. Four sorts of vanilla come to the English market, in packets of from fifty to one hundred pods. The best comes from Mexico; but the consignment is not more than five or six hundredweight, and it is so precious that a pound weight of it is worth ^5 or It may be imagined that so rare a commodity is not used for flavouring penny ices. The other three sorts come from Honduras, La Guayra, and Brazil. They are at once more feeble and less delicate; and the balsam of Peru is also used to simulate the true odour of vanilla. Vatel was a great cook; but he did more for his art by his death than ever he did in his life.

When the mythic hero stole that fire from the gods, he made cookery possible; when Vatel stabbed himself in the royal castle of Chantilly, he at once and for ever vindicated for cookery its position among the noble arts. The Prince of Condd was entertaining Louis XIV. and his court at Chantilly; and Vatel had to superintend all the prepa-

Introduction 14 but it is quite certain that with the progress of science we ought to attain our results by simpler and shoiter processes, with aim more precise and with success more assured. But nothing at all is possible until we first of all understand each other by agreeing upon terms about which there shall be no mistake. It is for this reason that in the following pages I have dwelt so much upon the mere grammar and vocabulary of the kitchen. Till we have settled our definitions there is no use in talking. And therefore, while in the receipts which are to follow I have done my utmost to simplify processes, to discard mere subtleties and variations, and to cut down useless expenses and tedious labour, I have gone first and fore- most on the principle that the greatest waste of all m the kitchen is the waste of words. It is a simple fact of which I undertake to produce overwhelming evidence, that the language of the kitchen is a language not understanded of the people.‚Äù There are scores upon scores of its terms in daily use which are little understood and not at all fixed; and there is not upon the face of this earth an occupation which is carried on with so much of unintelligible jargon and chattering of apes as that of preparing food. Not only cooks but also the most learned men in France have given up a great part of the language of the kitchen as beyond all comprehension. We" sorely want Cadmus among the cooks. All the world remembers that he taught the Greeks their alphabet. It is well-nigh forgotten that he was cook to the king of Sidon. I cannot help thinking that cooks would do well to combine with their cookery, like Cadmus, a little attention to the alphabet. Although cookery is not to be excused for its want o science and still less for its deficiency in letters, it is essential to add that the chemistry of food is. at least m point of science, nearly as backward as its cookery. Of course the chemists are extremely scientific in their

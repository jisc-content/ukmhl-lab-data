Lobster 2 So colour quite as good may be obtained by pounding the shell in a mortar, mixing it with butter, cooking it in the bain-marie for an hour, and then passing it through a tammy; or if this red be not bright enough, it can easily be made perfect with cochineal. Lobster Butter is roughly described in the last sentence. Add here that the coral and spawn are commonly used either with or without the pounded shell. If the former alone are used, pound them well, mix them with twice their weight of butter, season them with salt and pepper, and pass them through a silk sieve—but do not in any way cook them. If the lobster shells are used, take equal weights of shell and butter, pound them together, and cook them for an hour; but mark that for the sake of the colour the cooking is to be done in the bain-marie— that is, at a temperature much below the boiling point of water. When the butter thus coloured has been properly cooled in water, seasoned with cayenne pepper and salt, and passed through silk, it may be mixed with an equal quantity of fresh butter. The reason of dividing the butter into two quantities in this way is that the process of cooking destroys the natural flavour of the fresh butter. Therefore only half is used to cook the lobster shells, and the other half is added uncooked when the first half is got clear of shell. Lobster Sauce.—Split a lobster, and use the coral, the spawn, the shell, and the pith of the body to make lobster butter as above described. Then make English sauce—but only Act First (that is, the vehicle); and into this vehicle, quite hot, put the tail and the claws, cut into small dice. For the Second Act, the completion of the sauce, add the lobster butter, and finish with a squeeze of lemon. Most English receipts put in a word for a little essence of anchovies. Let the anchovies be kept in their own place, and not suffered to interfere with the delicate flavour of the lobster.

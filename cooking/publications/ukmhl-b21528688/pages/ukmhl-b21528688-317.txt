Mayonnaise 293 original receipt for it will be found under the title of Sole a la Normande. Mayonnaise is nothing else than the ordinary French salad mixture of oil, vinegar, pepper and salt, with the addition of raw yolks of eggs; but its excellence depends on the mode of working it up, which is very elaborate. If properly handled, a raw yolk will incorporate into a thick cream no less than a quart of oil. To make a good Mayonnaise it is enough that two raw yolks should incor- porate in this way a tumblerful of olive oil and a small wineglassful of tarragon vinegar or of lemon-juice. The result will be that those who object to oil will, if it be good, forget that it is there, and those who object to raw eggs will detect no trace of their rawness. The yolks, white pepper and salt are first worked smooth with a wooden spoon in a bowl; a few drops of oil and a few of vinegar are added, and the spoon goes to work again; again a few drops, and the spoon is plied with great patience; and so on till the mixture thickens and the whole of the oil and vinegar is absorbed. It is a long, tedious process of stirring, although as it goes on the oil may be added in larger and larger quantities. If great care is not taken the mixture will decompose in the very act of working it smooth; sometimes in the heat of summer it is necessary to manipulate it, holding the bowl on ice. This is the sauce in its simplicity, and so made it ought to be perfect. Green Mayonnaise.—For ordinary purposes a simple receipt will suffice—namely, this : Add to the Mayonnaise after it is finished a quantity of chopped ravigote. But a more perfect receipt is as follows - Take a good faggot of ravigote, and blanch it for five or six minutes in boiling water and salt. Then take it out to get cold, and wipe it dry. Pound it in a mortar with a spoonful of Mayonnaise, and pass it through a tammy.

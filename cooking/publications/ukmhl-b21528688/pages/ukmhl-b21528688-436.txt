The novelty was this. The French brown sauce was originally worked out of the French pot-au-feu (though not in the same manner as bouillon); and to this day there are popular cookery books —that of Gogue, published by Hachette, is one—which, although calling the sauce indifferently brown or Spanish, give a receipt for the preparation of its elementary juice or gravy which is nothing more than the ordinary contents of the best beef broth worked down towards a glaze.

There is a rhyme which says, No hay olla sin tocino Ni sermon sin Agustino,— that an olla can be no more without bacon than a sermon without a quotation from St. Augustine.

Sauce 4M Frankfort sausages, with their line smoky flavour, or some of the Jewish smoked heel, or the Jewish beef sausages— chorissas—are of more avail than a hundredweight of French ham. This analysis brings us back to our starting-point; and three questions arise : Are we to be content with the one brown fundamental sauce of the French books?—and are we to call it Spanish? To get at the root of the matter, we must come to a clear understanding as to the real difference between the brown and the white, into which all gravy sauces are divided. The white sauces (which by the way are not necessarily white, for they may be tinged to any colour —yellow with the yolks of eggs or scarlet with toma- tos—and yet preserve their character) are the result of decoction and no other heating process. To get a full flavour in this way, however, implies a long decoction and a reduction of much meat. And even when the sauce has been thus reduced to a white cullis, the flavour of the Velvet-down may be so flat that it requires to be enriched with nearly its own volume of cream to make a good Bechamel, or with butter and yolks of eggs to make a good German sauce. And how is brown sauce different? It may sound like a paradox to say so, but it is the simple fact, only expressed in a novel phrase—that the essential difference between brown and white sauce is that in addition to the boiling and simmering processes, which produce a white sauce, the brown one has to go through a process of roasting; and that this roasting creates a superlative flavour which can be obtained by very simple means. The juices of certain meats are, at a particular period of their decoction, roasted, and then submitted to a further decoction. What nonsense, it may be said, to speak of roasting a liquid ! Who ever heard of roasting water? Nobody has ever been able to roast mere water; but we have all heard of burning milk, of browning butter, and

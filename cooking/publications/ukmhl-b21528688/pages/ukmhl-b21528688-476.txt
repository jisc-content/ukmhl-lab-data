452 Sweat Sweat, To, is not a pretty phrase; but it expresses clearly enough the act of making meat yield its juices by being heated in a pan with little or no water.

There is a simple little instrument to measure these degrees known by the name of its in- ventor, Beaume. It is a sort of glass buoy with a measured

Kiimmel 269 Kromeski is a Polish word, which means no more than the. French croquette, and which in its first syllable might find a fair equivalent in the English crumb. If it were lawful to invent a word, it might be translated crumbikins. The kromeski or Polish croquette is made in the usual way with an addition. It is any croquette formed into a little roll and wrapped round with a thin slice of the udder of veal, or failing that with thin bacon. The veal udder (which is always best) or the bacon is boiled beforehand, is then sliced and wrapt round the croquette, which is finally dipped into batter and consigned to the frying-pan, from which it should come out crisp. This is the most seductive of all the forms of croquette. Kummel.—There is a class of umbel flowers, including anise, caraway or carvy, cumin, dill and coriander, which have long had a reputation for their pungent flavour and for their medicinal virtues—the chief of these virtues being to correct flatulence. Dill-water was famous at one time in England ; anise-seed is not unknown in English nurseries, and the Anisette of Bordeaux has a good name as an after-dinner liqueur on the Continent. Three hundred years ago caraways at English tables always came on with dessert, and were supposed to be carminative and digestive. Caraways in palpable form have now disappeared from our tables—but only to return in the spirit—in Russian bottles labelled Kummel. Of all the liqueurs of this class, it is the only one which seems likely to hold its ground. It has a pleasant stimulating taste, and it is supposed to be wholesome. When Russian kummel is old it forms crystals at the bottom of the bottle. The name, which is German, is probably derived from a confusion of the caraway or carvy with its neighbour cumin.

172 English Sauce by which a crust of bread rubbed with garlic is known. The chapon, thrown into the salad and mixed with it vigorously, imparts its garlic flavour to the endive. Many people may not enjoy this garlic. Let them try instead slices of a raw tomato intermingled with the endive. English Sauce—the so-called melted butter, said to be the one English sauce. We might expect the one English sauce to be always made in perfection, and especially as nothing can be more simple. On the contrary, it is pro- verbial for its villainy and its resemblance to bill-stickers’ paste, which is the result not only of carelessness but very often of stinginess. People who will go to great expense for fish will, to save twopence-halfpenny, stint the quantity of butter necessary for a good sauce. The sauce is the result of two processes which are quite distinct; and all the many failures of it are due, even where there is no stint of butter, to the fact that as commonly made it is the result of but one process. Act First. Knead an ounce of fresh butter into a paste with an equal quantity of sifted flour, some salt, nutmeg and mignonette pepper; dilute it with a gill, or even a gill and a half, of warm water; stir it on the fire till it boils; let it boil for three minutes—that is, till the flour is cooked—and then pass it through the pointed strainer. This is what many people call melted butter : they think that with the first act there is an end of the business. But even if four times the quantity of butter were used it would not produce a good sauce, for butter cooked in this way loses much of its flavour. The first act makes no melted butter; it only makes a vehicle for the melted butter which is to come. Act Second. The vehicle being boiling hot, mix in at the last, when the sauce is to be served, three more ounces of butter, stirring it quickly with a wire whisk. This butter is not to be cooked—only melted, as its name indi-

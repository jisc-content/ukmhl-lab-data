Indigestion 253 small, the tops of some cauliflower, and a pint of full-grown peas in four quarts of boiling water for two hours. Cut in neat chops a loin or the best end of a neck of mutton; add them to the vegetables with salt, pepper and some onions cut small, and let them boil an hour and a half. Lastly, add three pints of green peas and boil half an hour longer, when it is ready to serve.” In all two hours and a half— the mutton being put in half an hour after the vegetables. Distrust the English imitations of this receipt, which all miss the chief point of it-—a superabundance of peas, a portion of them being put in from the first, and after 2)/2 hours’ boiling being reduced to a mash.

It is a mistake. Hotch Potch will accept almost any addition except barley. Humble Pie.—If ever you should be told to eat humble pie, beg that you may be permitted to do so-—for it is very good.

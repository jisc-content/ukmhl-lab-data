372 Ratafia White Ragottt of Mutton.—This is sometimes called a Navarin Blanc; but as the Navarin is supposed to pun a little upon the navet, which is the leading feature of the ancient haricot, and as here we can dispense with turnips altogether, it is best to call it simply a white ragout. 1. Take the neck or the breast of mutton or lamb, cut it into cutlets or other pieces, trim well away the fat, and have all ready on a plate. 2. Put a shalot, four spring onions, a clove of garlic, and a good faggot of sweet-herbs, with pepper, salt, and powdered spices, into a saucepan half full of water. 3. Put the meat into this. See that it is well covered with the water. Let it simmer very gently for four hours. The sauce should then be reduced by half, but it should not be allowed to brown. Remove the faggot of herbs. 4. In the meantime choose what garniture of vegetables, either singly or in combination, is to enter into the stew : new potatoes, peas, flageolet beans, rice—or say, a medley of all sorts. Put them in half an hour before dinner, and let all boil briskly for that half-hour. 5. Observe that this is the simplest ragout in the world : no roux in it, no flour, no fat, no butter. Observe also that since the liquor will boil down to less than half, care must be taken as to the quantity of salt. For other white ragouts of mutton, see Irish Stew and Hotch Potch. Ratafia means no more than liqueur — an alcohol sweetened with sugar and flavoured with fruit or vegetable essences; but there is a mystery made about its etymology, and it is supposed to have a character of its own. One wise philologer declares that the liqueur is so called be- cause two persons who enter into a bargain ratify the con- tract with a glass of this liqueur. It is really a corruption of Rectify—rectified spirit, and is the proper equivalent

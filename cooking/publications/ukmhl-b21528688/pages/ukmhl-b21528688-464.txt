44° Soup secret of making soup is to begin with cold water, to bring it slowly to the boiling-point, a mere ripple on the surface, to let it simmer gently and continuously for hours—never boiling up and never ceasing to simmer. On these three points—the gradual production of the heat, the moderation of the boiling, and keeping it up to the end—the flavour of the clarification of the broth largely depend ; and it is easy to manage this in an earthen vessel. But it is just as possible with an iron or copper stockpot. It may not be so easy upon an open fire, but there is no difficulty what- ever on the closed ranges which are now so common. We can regulate the heat perfectly by choosing any position for the stockpot, from the corner of the stove to the centre. There is another needless direction. Soup should never be greasy. Every particle of fat should be removed. It is tedious to do so, however, by the ordinary process of skimming; and so we are sometimes advised to make the broth beforehand, and to make a supply for two days. When the broth cools the fat will cake to the surface, and may then be easily removed. The advice is good up to a certain point. It saves labour to make a good supply of broth at a time : it loses nothing in two days, even in hot weather, if kept in clean fresh vessels. But there is a simple mechanical contrivance to get rid of grease which ought for ever henceforth to render the little eyes which appear on the surface of soup an impossibility. All the fat rises to the top of the stockpot; if there is a tap at the bottom of it the broth will flow out without a particle of grease. Common sense will tell the cook to beware of salt. It is well to put it into the stockpot from the beginning, because it helps to make the scum rise; but what is barely enough for a full stockpot may be a great deal too much when the liquid boils down to half. The liquid flies off in steam, but the salt remains. The advantage of sugar is not so well known. It is

144 Croquettes of account, which has a short season and a dear price) the one vegetable eaten by rich and poor in England, for health even more than for food. The Greeks had a proverb •—“Eat cress and gain wit.” If this were only true, how clever must those good people be wbo are always eating cresses for breakfast! On the contrary, their lives are a stupid routine. In a stupid routine also' live those French cooks who insist upon sending to table a bunch of cresses with roast fowl-—even when there is a salad besides. To those who have a passion for watercresses, the Flemish soup of them will not be unpleasing-. It is usually reserved for meagre days. Take a large bunch of cresses, wash them, cut them up, and set them to boil with water, salt, and it may be a thought of vinegar. Add to them a quantity of peeled potatoes of the mealy sort. When these have broken into a mash, the soup is ready, and may be finished with butter. Croquettes are made of chicken, game, sweetbreads, fat livers, oysters, shrimps—and generally the lighter kinds of meat. The meat (most commonly chicken) is finely minced ; it is mixed with a seasoning of minced truffles, mushrooms, shalots or chives, as also of nutmeg pepper and salt; it is bound together with a stiff Allemande sauce; it is turned into- shapes of cork or ball; it is dipped into egg and rolled in breadcrumbs; it is fried crisp of a golden hue; it is sprinkled with salt, and served on a napkin with a garnish of fried parsley. It is also served in a dish with a sur- rounding of tomato sauce. When the croquette is finished differently—that is, when, instead of being dipped in egg and rolled in breadcrumb, it is wrapped in a thin puff paste—it is called a Rissole; and when it is wrapped in a thin sheet of veal udder or of bacon fat, it is called a Kromeski.

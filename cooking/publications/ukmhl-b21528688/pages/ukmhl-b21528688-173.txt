Curry i49 Minor, for the name of this ruddy fruit. The list might be multiplied—1 have said nothing of coral or crocus-—• but examples enough have been given to- enable the reader to return with his eyes open to the spelling of the currant —curran, and to the provincial English name of the goose- berry—the carberry.

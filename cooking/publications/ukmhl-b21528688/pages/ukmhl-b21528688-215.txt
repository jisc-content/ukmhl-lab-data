Simple Fritters.—Take some batter, for which see the receipt. Add a little sugar to it, and pro- foundly weigh whether yolks of eggs should enter into it or not. Better say yes, although the use of yolks tells with more distinct effect in the custard fritter. Drop this in spoonfuls into the frying-kettle, and serve them with sprinkled sugar. 2. Custard Fritters.—Make a good custard, and steam it in a pudding-dish which has been first rubbed with butter. When it is done, let it cool, cut it into squares, dip them in the batter, and fry them. They are excellent by them- selves, but they may be served in a dish with jam or fruit syrup round them. 3. Pudding Fritters.—The remains of any kind of pud- ding, not forgetting plum-pudding, may be served in the same way with excellent effect. 4. Fruit Fritters.—For these the chief fruits used are apples, oranges, peaches or pineapples. The apples and oranges are usually steeped in a little brandy and sugar for an hour beforehand. The peaches and pineapples may go into Kirschenwasser and sugar. Needless to say any- thing about peeling, trimming and cutting. Dip the fruit into the batter (in which, however, there should not be any yolks), and fry it as before, dropping spoonfuls of combined fruit and batter into the kettle. 5. Balloon Fritters (Beignets Souffles).—For this there is a little difference in the way of preparing the batter.

111 Char The idea thus started has been elaborated into a toy. hirst of all, a dish or mould has to' be chosen, shaped like a basket. Next a syrup of sugar is boiled to' crackling- point. Then the mould is lined with delicate little cakes-— ratafias the best, which are made to stick together edge to edge by being dipt in the sugar.

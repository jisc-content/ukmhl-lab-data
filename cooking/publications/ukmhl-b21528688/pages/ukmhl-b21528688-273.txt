249 Horseradish Horly—a la Horly—is a mode of describing fillets of anything, but generally of fish, fowl, and the whiter game, first marinaded for a couple of hours, then drained and dried, then dipped in batter and fried, then again drained and served with crisp parsley and a boatful of sauce. The chief Horlys are fillets of chicken and fillets of sole, and they are both done alike. The usual sauce to go with them is Tomato. For the marinade take either of the uncooked ones. Hors d’ceuvre.—There was a time when these little v articles demanded a good deal of attention. They are now of the smallest account; and are little more than the trifles—prawns, olives, radishes, anchovies—which keep the customer occupied in a restaurant while the dinner he has ordered is getting ready. The hot Hors d’oeuvres—as the Bouchees, Rissoles and Croquettes—are now classed among the entrees. Horseradish.—Old Parkinson said that it ought to be called Clown’s mustard, “ for it is too strong for any tender stomach.” Nevertheless, there are many persons to whom roast beef without horseradish is nearly as great a failure as without mustard. It is scraped and served as a garnish. Better still, it is grated and made into a sauce, which is usually cold, though sometimes heated. Horseradish Sauce.—Grate a young root finely. Add to it a gill of cream, a dessertspoonful of sugar, a little salt, and rather more than a tablespoonful of vinegar, and mix all well together. Some persons add mustard. Another receipt.—Add to the grated radish the zest and juice of an orange, three tablespoonfuls of oil, a table- spoonful of panada, a good tablespoonful of vinegar, a teaspoonful of sugar, and a good pinch of salt. Mix well together and serve in a boat. See Polish Sauce.

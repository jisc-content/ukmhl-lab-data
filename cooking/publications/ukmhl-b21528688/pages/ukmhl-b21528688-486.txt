462 Truffles snouts of pigs. They are beyond praise in the perfection of their perfume. But once unearthed the perfume soon fades, and by the time they reach London it becomes so faint that if the truffles are not quickly disposed of they are scarce to be recognised as the sublime of human food. What they lose in perfume they gain in price, and dealers in London demand twelve and fifteen shillings a pound for them. A bottle no bigger than one of those used for hyacinth bulbs, containing preserved truffles, which are not to be compared with fresh ones, is sold at half a guinea. Now when we know that some French cooks require six or eight pounds of truffles for a single dish, we can all calculate whether a truffle in England is worth its price, and we shall not be astonished at the tale told by Mr. Llayward of a magnificent turkey stuffed with truffles by Morel and sold for something like T20- Common sense tells us that a fresh mushroom gathered in English fields and woods, and well cooked, is worth more than all but a sprinkling of the truffles which cross the Channel; but, all the same, fashion is omnipotent, and a cook who should abstain from cramming his sauces with essence of truffles, and from adorning his meats with slices of them, would be regarded as ignorant of his business, and fit only for the lowest of low life. Let it be observed that much as the truffle is vaunted, the civilised world has continued to do without it until very recently. It was, indeed, known to the Romans; but, says Brillat-Savarin, “ from the Romans to our own day there is a long interregnum, and the resur- rection of the truffle is recent enough. One may even say that the generation which is now (1826) passing away, has been witness of it.” Truffles in a Napkin.—Wash and brush them several times in cold water. Then stew them slowly in a Mirepoix of white wine for half an hour or three-quarters. Drain them and serve them in a folded napkin.

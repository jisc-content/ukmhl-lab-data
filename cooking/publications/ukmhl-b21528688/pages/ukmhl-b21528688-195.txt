17i Endive a pig ’s bladder, boil them hard, and take them out again. In a still larger bladder place the whites; into the midst of this put the yolk; tie up the bladder tight; and boil the whole till the white hardens. Uncover the monster egg, and serve it on a bed of spinach or other vegetable. This is a French jest in imitation of the great Madagascar eggs of the Epiornis Maximus, which would contain about twelve dozen hens’ 'eggs.

Last of all, finish it with another ounce of butter and some ' grated nutmeg. Endive Salad.—When the French prepare this salad, they always like to have with it, as what they call fourniture, giving an accessory flavour, a chapon. This is the name

So Bordeaux the heart of man, and was accordingly ranked among the four cordial flowers—that is, flowers which acted upon the heart and made it merry. The four flowers were alkanet, borage, roses and violets. This is what Lord Bacon says of it : “The leaf of the borage hath an excellent spirit to repress the fuliginous vapours of dusky melancholy and so to cure madness. ... It will make a sovereign drink for melancholy passions.” I he juice of the leaves abounds in nitre, and the withered stalks have been seen to burn like matchpaper. The young leaves and tender tops used to be taken in salad. Now the plant is scarcely ever used except for flavouring claret-cup. It resembles, in this respect, burnet and cucumber. Bordeaux, Bordelese.—The famous capital of the Gascon country has given its name to a sauce, to a method of serving the entrecote or ribstead, and to the cooking of crayfish. Sauce Borclelaise.— Properly speaking, there is no such sauce, and very few of the books care to describe it. What is so called is a variety of the Genevese Sauce, and got its name probably because of the Bordeaux wine in it. Take a good brown sauce, Spanish if possible, boil it down with a tumblerful of red Bordeaux, with one or two shalots chopped small, and by rights also with a clove of garlic crushed. Entrecote a la Borclelaise.—One would imagine that tins must be a ribsteak with Bordelese sauce. It is nothing of the kind—for, as we have said, there is, strictly speaking, no such sauce. It is a ribsteak grilled in the ordinary way and served with (either upon it or under it) a piece of cold maltre d’hotel butter, into which has been wrought some choped shalot. To those who love onion flavours the idea seems good, but many persons regret the order they have given for the Entrecote a la Bordelaise, from not taking into account that the shalot is raw.

Toss 460 garlic, pepper and salt. Cook it for ten or fifteen minutes; then stir into it a small cupful of breadcrumbs which have soaked in broth, and the yolks of two eggs. When this is cold, fill the tomato skins with it, shake some fine bread raspings over them, and bake them briskly for ten or twelve minutes. Tomato-Salad.—Divide the tomatos horizontally, and squeeze out the pips. Then cut up the halves and mix them with a cruet sauce. For the tomato salad a dash of mustard is not a bad addition, but the tomatos being juicy in themselves, require less than the usual quantity of oil and vinegar. For garniture, some chopped spring onions or chives. One or two tomatos, cut up as above described, make an excellent addition to a salad of cos-lettuce. Toss.—This is the English for Sauter, which see. To toss is to fry very lightly; and the tossing is necessary in order both to equalise the heat and to keep it down. Frying proper on a steady fire evolves a roasting heat. Tossing is, so to speak, opposed to frying. It is to fry and not to fry. It is an attempt to produce some of the effects of frying, and not the others. It is to fry without pro- ducing the brittle surface of frying. Toulouse Ragout.—See Relish No. 1. Tournedos.—This word will not be found in any French dictionary as applied to an article of food. Yet it is of constant use in the French kitchen, and multiplies itself in bills of fare. It really means a small collop of beef which can be done almost while the cook turns his back. It is at least a much better word than the escalopes which the French cooks are so fond of, and which really means nothing at all. A tournedos is a thin collop, which is put upon the fire and is done on one side before the cook has had time to turn round. He turns it over on the other side, which is cooked in the same way in a twinkling. The

Plums -> £ '■y 030 Piquante.—See Sharp. Plaice, called on the Sussex coast diamond plaice, from the little orange lozenges on their backs, and for the same reason called in France carrelet, are the poorest and the cheapest of all the flat fish. The worst cookery cannot do them wrong, and the best cannot do them good. The only way to eat them is in fillets prepared in any of the ways prescribed for fillets of sole. The best plaice that come to the London market are caught between Hastings and Folkestone, and are named from their habitation Dowers plaice. Plovers.—The best are the golden plovers. They used to be, and often still are, roasted without being drawn—as were also turtledoves and larks; “for,” says an ancient author, “larks eat only pebbles and sand, doves grains of juniper and scented herbs, and plovers feed on air.” Later, the same rule was extended to the woodcock; and the general rule now is to dress the plover as a woodcock. Plovers’ Eggs must not be forgotten—delicious little things hard-boiled, exquisite in a salad, perfect in a sand- wich, most admirable of all set like large opals in the midst of aspic jelly. The chief supply comes from Holland. The first eggs that come over are sent to the Queen, and are worth 7s. 6d. apiece. Plums have a wide range of meaning. Linnaeus in- cluded under the name, not only plums proper, but cherries and apricots; and when we speak of a plum-pudding we extend the designation to raisins. The plums best known have each a special name : as Orleans, Greengage, Magnum Bonum, Damson, Mirabelle, and so forth. It is a pity to cook them when they are sweet and ripe, unless with a view to preserve them; but there will always be young people in the world, and old people with youthful tastes, to whom stewed plums and plum tarts will never come amiss. 23

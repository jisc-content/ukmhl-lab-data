484 Vol-au-vent warm place all night; then put it in a barrel, and keep it in a warm part of the kitchen till it has done working. There should be an air-hole in the top of the barrel. It will take several weeks before the fermentation is at an end and the vinegar is quite fit for bottling. Vol-au-vent is often made with great elaboration, and in that case had better be ordered from a professed pastry-cook. For a very simple vol-au-vent the follow- ing receipt may suffice. The explanation will be clearest if we take the small vol-au-vents, commonly called Petites Bouchees (Little mouthfuls). Roll out some of the finest puff paste (No. 3) to about a quarter of an inch in thickness. Cut out of it two circles, each the size of a crown piece. The one is to be put on the top of the other; but before doing so two things are required: first, to cut a half-crown piece out of the topmost one, which will then be a half-crown with a ring round it; next, to wet the lower piece all round its edge, so that the ring of the upper piece may adhere to it. When the two sheets thus joined are baked, they will together rise to the height of two inches. The half-crown piece will be loose in the middle; it can be lifted out, leaving a hollow; and it will form a lid for the small vol-au-vent. Fill the hollow with any of the ragouts—the Financial one and the Toulouse are most in favour. A large vol- au-vent is done in the same way—only that according to its size the paste is rolled out thicker—say half an inch. The ornamentation of the paste in the wav of printing or cutting must be left to fancy. ALNUT.—When an Englishman thinks of a nut, it is the filbert or the cobnut which comes most readily into his fancy: the walnut is to him what its name signifies— a foreign nut. To the southern races of Europe it is the

England, being nearly all seaboard, was in a much better position to pronounce upon the way in which salt-water fish should be cooked. ‘And here upon their sea- board the English can get any quantity of laver; on the coast of Scotland there is delicious dulse; in Ireland there is the carrageen or Irish moss.

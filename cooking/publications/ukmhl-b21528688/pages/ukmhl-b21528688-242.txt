2 I 8 Genevese Sauce Bordelaise, and other cooks using Burgundy make another variation, which they call Sauce Bourguignonne. What between the names of Genoa, Bordeaux, and Burgundy, there has arisen a confusion, in the midst of which the claims of Geneva stand a good chance of being superseded. The sauce was invented at Geneva, for the especial behoof and benefit of the trout which populate the lake. The fame of Geneva for its trout is of old standing. “It is well known,” said Izaak Walton, two centuries ago, “ that in the Lake Leman—the Lake of Geneva—there are trouts taken of three cubits long (4^ feet). And Mercator says the trouts that are taken in the Lake of Geneva are a great part of the merchandise of that famous city. ” Genevese Sauce.—Take half a bottle of red wine (the Genevese generally stuck to Burgundy), a chopped onion, two chopped shalots, a clove of garlic crushed (they prefer two in the South), two cloves of spice and a faggot of sweet-herbs. Put them into a saucepan, and let them simmer till the onions are done. Then add a ladleful of Spanish or good brown sauce. Reduce all to the thickness of a cullis, skim it, and pass it through a tammy. Lastly, boil it up again, add a pinch of sugar and (partly for salt) a good lump of anchovy butter. Variation First. There is a feebler way, which may be mentioned for the sake of economy, but it has the dis- advantage of requiring the fish to be cooked first beiore beginning the sauce, and it is possible only when the fish has been cooked in a court bouillon of wine with flavouring herbs and spices. Take two ladlefuls of the court bouillon, add to it a ladleful of Spanish sauce, pass it through the tammy, add a pinch of sugar, and finish it with anchovy butter. Variation Second is the so-called Bordelese Sauce, made with Bordeaux wine, with no onion, nor sweet-herbs, noi anchovy butter, and not strained.

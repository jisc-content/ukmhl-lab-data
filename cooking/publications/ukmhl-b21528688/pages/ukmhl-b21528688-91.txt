67 Beetroot beef half a pound of brown sugar, and leave it for two days. Then make a powder consisting' of one pound of salt, two ounces of saltpetre, two ounces of black pepper, two ounces of allspice, two ounces of juniper berries—well mixed together. Rub this into the beef and turn it daily; it will be ready in three weeks. For cooking—the usual way is to wash off the salt and spice; to boil the ordinary salt beef in water, and to serve it with some of its liquor; also with a garnish of greens, carrots, and sometimes dumplings. But if people take for three weeks the trouble to get up a Round of beer—one of the boasts of English cookery— they may as well cook it in the best way, which is to place it, with a very little water—a cupful will do—in a pot of its own size, metal or earthen, to surround it and cover it with beef-fat chopped, and to bake it in the oven for five or six hours. The difference is incredible between the ten- derness and succulence of a Round boiled in water, at a temperature below 2120, and one baked in beef-fat at 4000 or 4000. The Miniature round of beef— that is, ribs of beef, boned and rolled—may be done in the same way with admirable effect, though of course the measurements must vary. The larger round of beef may be reckoned at twenty-five pounds. What is called Pressed Beef is nothing but the brisket, pickled as above with salt, sugar, saltpetre and mixed spices—left in this pickle for a week, boiled till tender, and pressed under a heavy weight until cold. Beetroot.—The Greeks held the beet in such esteem that they used to offer it to Apollo at Delphi on silver, and they preferred its leaves to lettuce. The leaves are hardly ever used now unless they may be so in Brabant, where in Flemish cookery—and these Flemings were good judges—• they took the place of spinach, which belongs to the same family. We make use only of the root now, and that

Fry ing 193 They pinched round the edges, and then set them to swim for five or six minutes on the one side, then for five or six minutes on the other in the hot fat. They were afterwards drained, sprinkled with sugar, piled on a napkin, and dubbed Beignets a la Dauphine. The German names are —at Vienna, Wiener Krapfen; and at Berlin, Berliner Pfannkuchen. Frogs are at their best in the spring, and therefore it is only in Lent that they are to be seen at Parisian tables. The hind-legs alone are eaten. They are skinned, they are blanched, they are boiled, and they are served either with a poulette sauce or fried in butter. The French have a theory that frogs, having a mighty power of croaking, are good for the chest and sovereign over a cough. Their final cause in fact is the cure of the con- sumptive. Frying.—Because fat, oil or butter is essential to fry- ing, the common idea is that the food cooked in this way must be rich and greasy. There cannot be a greater mistake. The fats are essential to it, not because of their richness, but because of the great heat which they can transmit. If water could be heated up to 3000 or 4000, it would produce all the effect of frying. In the article on boiling it has been explained how meat plunged into boiling water (2120) has the albumen coagulated on the surface in the first five minutes—which is as it were a coat- of-mail through which the water cannot penetrate and the juices cannot escape. Much more is this coat-of-mail rapidly and decidedly formed if the food is plung'ed into a fluid at the temperature of 3000 or 4000. That fluid is fat, and it neither penetrates into fish, flesh or vegetable, nor does it allow their juices to exude. It has not only this preservative effect on the interior of the food—it also devel- opes the roast appearance and flavour on the exterior, lhe difference between roasting and boiling is not a difference 13

Veal 472 into the frying-pan from which it has been taken half a pint or rather more of boiling water, broth, or gravy. Add pepper and salt. Give it a minute’s simmering, and then pour it over the meat in the saucepan. Let the veal stew gently for from three-quarters of an hour to an hour. A bunch of green onions cut small may be added to the other vegetables. ” Veal in a Mirepoix.—Take a cushion of veal, and lard it or not at pleasure. Put it in a glazing stewpan with half a pint of Mirepoix of white wine, which is to be well reduced. Moisten it again with a pint of the like Mirepoix and three gills of veal stock.

Serve at the same time in a dish apart some boiled bacon or Bath chap, with greens. For a variety, instead of the melted butter or English

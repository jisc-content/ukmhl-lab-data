203 Gallimawfrey have sprung. We have resembling, indeed identical, frag- ments of words scattered more or less throughout the European languages—classical, romantic, Celtic, Teutonic, Scandinavian—which are not to be accounted for except on the theory of a lost antecedent language, their progeni- tor, transmitting through many centuries tiny details of likeness that here get broken into pieces, and there get mixed and crossed with new features. No need now, however, to lose ourselves in the contemplation of this shadowy language of far-distant ancestors; it is enough that receding only five centuries, to the days of the Canterbury Tales, and listening to the discourse of the cooks—not forgetting Chaucer’s cook, who could roast and seethe and broil and fry, Maken mortrewes and well bake a pie, who could make blancmanger with the best, and who travelled with the pilgrims to boil their chickens and look after the galingale—we come upon traces of a language which had passed away, but which yet retained life enough in the rotting leaves it left behind to account for forms of speech that endure to this very day, and that, without the assistance of King Richard’s cook, might have remained for ever an impenetrable mystery. In all previous inquiries into the nature of Gallimawfrey and Galimatias, the searcher has been thrown off the scent by not knowing the meaning of the first two syllables. He knew that the words referred to something about a fowl, and he looked for mention of the fowl in these early syllables.

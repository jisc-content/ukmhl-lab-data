Omelet 3*9 Omelet with tomatos.—Take the flesh of the tomatos free from skin and pips, and mix with the beaten eggs. Sweet Omelet.—Beat six egg's and add to them two tea- spoonfuls of sugar, together with a few bits of butter. As a rule the eggs for an omelet are not to be too much beaten, but for the sweet omelet they may be beaten even to frothing a little. Then pour them into the omelet pan, and proceed as for the plain omelet; only, on account of the sugar, which might burn, the fire must not be so brisk. When the omelet is dished, it is sprinkled with sugar, and with a red-hot iron skewer it is marked with cross-bars. Omelet with rum.—This is a sweet omelet with a glass of rum whipt into the eggs. It is sprinkled with sugar on the dish, and at the moment of serving it a glass of rum is poured over it and lighted. Apricot Omelet.—This is the preserve which is the most frequently used with the omelet. Proceed as for the sweet omelet in every respect, only that before folding it up there is to be placed in the centre of it a fitting quantity of apricot jam. Omelette Souffiee.—Take six eggs and break them, dividing the whites from the yolks. All the whites are to be used, but only half the yolks. Whip the whites to a very firm froth. Then add to them the yolks, shake in the best part of two ounces ol sifted sugar, and sprinkle all with orange-flower water. Make a smooth mound with this upon an oval dish. In the centre of it put a knife down, giving it a twist, so as to make a hole for the heat to spread quickly into the middle of the omelet, which may also be rudely ornamented by drawing slant lines with the point of the knife all round its sides. Put it into a brisk oven for seven minutes. It must be served instantly, for the inflation rapidly subsides; but before serving sprinkle it with what is left of the two ounces of sugar.

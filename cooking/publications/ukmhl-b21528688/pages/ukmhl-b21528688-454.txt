430 Sole the faggot; by shaking into it, on the angle of the stove, some yolk of egg, till it slightly thickens; lastly, by straining it over the fish. Care must be taken not to use too much egg. For a small sole half a yolk ought to be enough. Sole a la Normande (the Normandy matelote).—The following' receipt, with the alteration of a word or two, is borrowed from Gouffe, who says that he had it direct from Langlais, the chef of the Rocher de Cancale, who invented it. Butter a silver dish ; stew it with onions chopped fine and previously blanched; season the sole with pepper and salt; put it on the dish; cover it with white French wine, and cook it in the oven. In the meantime prepare some mussels, oysters, mushrooms, fried smelts, and crusts for garnish. Add the liquor of the sole and that of the mussels to some mock Velvet-down, reduce it, and thicken it with yolk of egg. Place the mussels, oysters, and mush- rooms on the sole; pour over all some sauce; return the dish to the oven for five minutes, being careful not to brown the sauce, which should be of a rich cream colour; garnish the top with the fried smelts and the crusts; and serve the remaining sauce in a boat. Baked Sole (Sale au Gratin).—Some people speak of the Normandy matelote as being baked because it is done in the oven ; but an oven, like a fire, will boil as well as roast, and the Normandy sole has no sign of baking or roasting upon it. It is different with the sole au gratin. Take a silver dish, or any other which will stand the heat of the oven. Make a cut down each side of the backbone of the sole; season it with salt and pepper; put it into the dish with a lump of butter in the furrows; and stew all about the fish two teaspoonfuls of mushrooms, one of parsley, and one of shalot. Moisten this with a glass of white French wine; powder all well with bread-raspings, and put it in the oven for fifteen or twenty minutes, to cook

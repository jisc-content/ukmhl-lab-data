258 Jardiniere interests the philosophic mind in that 5 which fears to duplicate itself, and that 2 which refuses to vanish alto- gether. There is no indecision in the jam, however—and I hand down to the admiration of posterity the immortal name of W. Buszard, 350, Oxford Street—the only place in London where strawberries are decently preserved. Jardiniere.—It is an amusing idea, this of the gardener’s wife, who is supposed to go into the garden to see her husband, who filches here a carrot or two, there a turnip, now an onion or a few pods of peas, and who returns home with a medley of small vegetables in her apron. A soup with her little collection thrown into it is called a soup a la Jardiniere (see Brunoise); and a steak, a cutlet or a ragout served with a similarly medley is said to be a cutlet, a steak or a ragout after the fashion of the gardener’s wife. As the word Macedon is used in the same way to express a medley of vegetables, and as we do not always want the same combination of garden stuff, it is a pity that one of these words is not used for one sort of medley and the other for another. But here we have two words for one and the same thing—any conceivable medley of vegetables. Jelly.—No doubt the counterblast of Baron Liebig against gelatine and jelly was much needed. The world had an exaggerated notion of the value of jelly as nutri- ment. The counterblast of the chemist was aided by the discovery that gelatine is often derived from obnoxious sources—such as horses’ hoofs. The consequence is that jelly has gone very much out of fashion. This is a pity; for whatever the chemists may say—and their results, as may be seen under the head of Gelatine, are by no means clear—the palate enjoys a good calf’s-foot jelly, and we are not yet so corrupted by civilisation that we cannot afford to be ruled by the promptings of nature. A sick man will often swallow with enjoyment a calf’s-foot jelly

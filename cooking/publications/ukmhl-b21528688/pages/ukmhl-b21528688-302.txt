In the face of such facts it is singular to find Frenchmen repeating one after another that liqueurs were first invented by Frenchmen to comfort the old ag'e of the Grand Monarch. Long before Louis XIV. was born, Sully in 1604 complained that the luxuries on which the F rench wasted most money were festivities and liqueurs. There were two liqueurs at that time in the greatest favour—Populo and Rossolis, the former made of musk, amber, anise and cinnamon; the latter of sundew, angelica, coriander, fennel, anise and lemon; and both, needless to say, warmed with alcohol and mellowed with syrup.

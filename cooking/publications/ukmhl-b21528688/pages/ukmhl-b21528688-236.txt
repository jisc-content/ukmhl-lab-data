There will be no difficulty in making this good ; but before going into the proof of it, observe that Ma-en-sire, if this be indeed the original expression, would naturally become slurred into mangier, through contraction of the vowels and through the nasal n joining with the sh sound of sire to form g. Independently of the fact that the first syllable of syrup is connected with the first syllable of sherbert, we know that in a number of old French words there was a tendency in the sibilant to be- come in England and Northern France thickened into sh and ch : thus cive became chive, and we have such words as sure and sugar pronounced shure and shugar. Ma-en- sire would therefore very easily run into mangier and mengier. But was the word really Blanc Ma-en-sire? It is not to be found in this particular form, which must have been very ancient; but there is a considerable number of other words and phrases for the same thing perfectly parallel to it, and making it as unreasonable to doubt that it (that is, Blanc Ma-en-sire) is identical with Blanc Mangier as it would be to doubt that daisy is day’s eye and foxglove is folk’s glove. Here follow two receipts in succession ; and though they show differences of detail, I defy the reader to discover any essential difference between them. Number one :— “Put rice in water all a night, and at morrow wash them clean. Afterwards put them to the fires fort [strong| that they burst, and not too much. Then take brawn of capons or of hens sodden and draw it small. After take milk of almonds and put it to the rice and boil it, and when it is yboiled put in the brawn and alloy it therewith, that it be well chargeant [stiff], and mingle it [stir it] finely well that it sit not to the pot. And when it is enough and chargeant do thereto sugar good part; put therein almonds fried in white grease and dress it forth.” Number two :—

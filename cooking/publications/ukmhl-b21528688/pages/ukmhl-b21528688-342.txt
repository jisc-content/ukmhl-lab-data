3i8 Omelet with pepper and salt, and beat them with a fork. Put two ounces of butter into an omelet pan, and as soon as it melts pour in the eggs. Stir them lightly with a fork and keep them from catching the pan. When half-set, toss the omelet, and keep stirring it till it is all set. The finishing operation is performed in one of two ways. Practised hands slant the pan downwards from the handle—taking care, however, that the best of the fire is beneath the upper or handle end : they 'then roll the omelet downwards till it takes the form of an elongated oval. A more simple plan is merely to fold over the omelet on both sides to the proper elliptical shape. In either case the operation must be performed rapidly. Omelet until fine-herbs.—Beat the eggs with a tablespoon- ful of chopped parsley, and if the onion flavour is admired, with a chopped shalot which has been first blanched. Omelet with gravy (Omelette au jus).—The same as the last, with a little gravy served round it. Omelet with cheese.—Some grated Gruy&re added to the beaten eggs instead of the fine-herbs, and afterwards strewed over the omelet in the dish. Omelet with bacon.—Boil a quarter-pound of bacon for five or six minutes; cut it into small squares; fry them in a little butter, and then add them to the beaten eggs of the first receipt—which, however, should have a diminished allowance of salt. Omelet with kidneys.—Cut up a couple of kidneys into dice or into thin slices. Put them into the omelet pan with butter and some of the kidney fat. When the butter and the fat are melted, and the pieces of kidney are quite hot, pour in the beaten eggs and proceed as before. Omelet with asparagus.—Boil the asparagus, take the points and mix them with the beaten eggs.

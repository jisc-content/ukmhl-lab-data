222 Gourmand but add no nutmeg or other spice. Mix in at the last moment some rich cream, and it is ready. The young folks of Northamptonshire, after eating as much as they possibly can of this gooseberry fool, are said frequently to roll down a hill and begin eating again.” Gooseberry Sauce.—Boil half a pint of unripe goose- berries, and having poured off the water, rub them through a hair sieve. Mix the pulp thus obtained with a pat of butter, make it hot, and serve it for mackerel. This is enough; but a little ginger may be added, and taste may be consulted for sugar and for salt. The greening of spinach juice, which French cooks add, is very doubtful. Gourmand, Gourmet.—Gourmand is a word of foreign ■origin, but it is perfectly naturalised among us, for we understand and accept its meaning. Gourmet, on the other hand, is a good English word in its origin, but it is doubt- ful whether it will ever pass current among us in the sense which the French have put upon it. The word is really diminutive of groom—a young man, a lad. In its broadest sense it survives in bridegroom. It is peculiarly applied to the young man who looks after horses; and gromet or grummet is an old sailor s word for a cabin- boy. In French the word was transposed to gourme, the diminutive being gourmet, a lad in general, then the wine- merchant’s lad, then a wine-taster, next a good judge of wine whether professional or not, and lastly any one with a fine taste and delicate in his feeding. There is such an obvious difference between the gour- mand and the gourmet, and it is so clearly possible to be the one without the other, that some people wonder at the difficulty of bringing the name for the latter into popular use. The fact is, that the words are too nearly alike in sound. To this it may be replied that they are alike in French as well as in English, and that therefore we should expect the distinction to be as easy in English as in French.

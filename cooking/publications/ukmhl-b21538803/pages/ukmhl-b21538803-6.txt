4 obtain a full-sized quart mould three pints of liquid should first be prepared. Everything used must be free from grease, and the cloth kept for the one purpose. Never use soap in washing it, and put it away when quite dry, not before. Never stir the jelly after it boils, as the scum on the top must not be broken. Wait until the jelly is begiwiing to set a little before pouring into the mould. Be careful to rinse the jelly mould in cold water just before pouring in the jelly. In Macedoines, or fruit jellies, more Gelatine must be used, as a firmer jelly is required to bear the weight of the fruit. The larger the mould, the more Gelatine is required in proportion. When wine is added to jellies, it is well to boil up wth the other ingredients, as, if added after, it tends to cloud the jelly. Brandy and Essences, when recommended, are better added after. In turning out jellies, creams, &c., immerse the mould qxdcJtly in hot water, dry it with a cloth, and turn out on to a cold dish. If the water is very hot, it is less likely to cause breakage than tepid water (often recommended) with necessary patting and shaking. All dishes of this class should be sent to table at the last moment, and not allowed to stand in a warm room, this being fatal to appearance and flavour, as the colder they are the better. Metal Moulds are best for general use; either copper, or block tin with copper tops. B. R.

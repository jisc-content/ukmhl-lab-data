16 YORKSHIRE PUDDING. Ingredients :—J lb. of flour. 1 or 2 eggs. 1 pt. of milk. A pinch of salt. Dripping. Method:—Mix the flour and salt in a basin, and make a hole in the centre. Break the egg into another basin, and add it to the flour, then put half the milk to it very gradually, stirring until it is smooth, and beat well. Add the remainder of the milk in the same way, and let it stand an hour, if possible, before cooking. Just cover the bottom of the baking-tin with hot fat from the meat; pour the batter in, and bake about i-hour before the fire if roasting meat, or in a quick oven. N.B.—(1) Eggs should always be broken into separate basins, lest they be not good. (2) This receipt also makes a plain boiled Batter Pudding, and it can be turned into a Black Cap pudding by the addition of a J lb. of currants. Boil 1£ hours, or steam 2 hours. TO CLARIFY DRIPPING. Ingredients :—Dripping. Boiling water. Method:—Put the dripping into a saucepan, with sufficient water to cover it well; let it boil fast about 20 minutes : then pour the whole into a basin or jar; let it remain until it is cold and the dripping firm. Raise the cake of dripping with a knife, pour away the water, and scrape of! anj sediment. If the fat is burnt at all, a little soda should be added. N B. (1) If the dripping stands too long when it is cold and firm it will absorb the water, and mil then require to be put into a slow oven to allow the water to evaporate. (2) In hot weather, when it is difficult to get the dripping firm, it is a good plan to place the jar of dripping, when cool- ing, in a howl of cold water.

Ingredients :—1 lb. of leg of beef. 2 carrots. 1 turnip. 2 onions (scalded). 1 oz. dripping. , 1 pint boding water. 1 tablespoonful flour. About 4- gill vinegar. Salt and pepper to taste. Method:—Cut the meat into neat pieces and lay them in 'the vinegar for a few minutes to soften the fibres. Fry the onions till brown, then drain them free from fat and put them into a stewpan with the meat, taking it out of the vinegar. Add the boiling water, cover closely, and simmer gently about 4 hours. Prepare the other vegetables, cutting them into small squares, and add them about 1 hour before the stew is finished. Just before serving it, mix the flour to a smooth paste, with a little cold water, add it to the stew, stir it until it boils, season to taste and serve on a hot dish. It should be stirred a few times while cooking. 1LB.—(1) Any tough meat, such as the leg or shin of beef, should not be fried, as it only makes it harder; and as salt has the same effect, it is not added until the last. (2) Stews can also be cooked in jars with close-fitting lids (or covered with greased paper tied closely) in a slow oven. In this case, after taking the onions from the fat, put the flour to it, stirring until it is brown, then add the water gradually, still stirring well, until it boils ; pour this over the meat.

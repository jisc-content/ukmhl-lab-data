3y MELTED BUTTER (2). Ingredients :—1 oz. flour. 4 oz. butter, i pint hot water. Method:—Put the butter and flour into a small basin, and work them together with a wooden spoon until smooth ; then add the hot water gradually, stirring all the time. Put it into a small saucepan, and stir until it boils. N.B.—The advantage of this method is, that only half the quantity of butter is required, still making good sauce. FRUIT PIE. Ingredients:—About 1 lb. fruit for a pint pie dish. 2 oz. moist sugar, or to taste. Water. Short paste. Method :—The general method is the same as for meat pies., but observe the following rules:— 1. For fruit pies it is better to put the fruit and sugar in layers, to ensure uniform sweetness. 2. Do not, however, put sugar on the last layer of fruit, as this will come in contact with the pastry, and is apt to make it heavy. 3. The quantity of water must be regulated according to the juiciness of the fruit. 4. Make openings in the sides, under the rim of pastry, to let out the steam. Cook it about 20 minutes in a hot oven, and then very slowly, to finish cooking the fruit. 5. If liked, it can be brushed over very lightly with cold water, and sprinkled very lightly with castor sugar; but great care should be taken not to use too much of either, or the pastry will be heavy.

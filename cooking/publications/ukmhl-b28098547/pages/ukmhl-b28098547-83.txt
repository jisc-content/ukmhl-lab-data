79 Method :—Put the macaroni into a pan with plenty of hoilinq water and a pinch of salt. Let it simmer about hour, strain it, then add the milk and simmer 1 hour or until quite cooked and the milk is absorbed. Put this on to a greased meat dish, mix with it half of the cheese and season to taste. Sprinkle the remainder of the cheese and bread crumbs on the top, put the butter in small pieces here and there, and place it in the oven or before the fire for a few minutes to brown. If hominy is used, wash and soak it, and cook it in the water in which it has been soaked, but for macaroni the water must be boiling, or it will lose its round form and look and taste disagreeble.

INTRODUCTION. SUMMARY of general principles having been felt to be a desideratum amongst teachers of Cookery, these axioms were formulated in the hope that they would supply this want. They have been found to ensure emphasis being laid, on the most important points of each subject they comprise, and. also prove that a rule with an intelligent reason for it is remembered, when receipts (which are difficult to retain) will ahnost entirety fade from the memory. Cookery is a subject which perhaps more than others demands a help of this kind, because it is somewhat monotonous, because the heat required for its operation tries the concentrative power of the teacher, and because the constant thought required for the practical part of the work interferes, necessarily, with the even tenour of theoretical lessons only. It is of great importance that a mere parrot-like repetition of the “ Axioms ” should be avoided; therefore, when a child has repeated them, she should be questioned thoroughly as to their why and wherefore.

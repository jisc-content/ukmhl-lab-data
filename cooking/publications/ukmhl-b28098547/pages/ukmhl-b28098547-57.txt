53 BARLEY WATER. Ingredients:—1 oz. pearl barley. 1 qt. cold water. Lemon or orange rind and sugar to taste. Method:—Just cover the barley with cold water, let it boil up and strain it away. Then add the quart of water and lemon or orange rind, simmer one hour, and strain and sweeten to taste. N.B.—This makes quite a nourishing drink when allowed to simmer the full hour ; and if acids can be taken, the lemon or orange juice is an improvement, and is sometimes much liked by working men as a summer drink. Lemonade. Ingredients:—1 large lemon. 1 pint boiling water. 1 tablespoonful sugar, or to taste. Method:—Peel the lemon very thinly, remove all the white pith, and slice it and take away the pips. Put the rind and slices into a jug, add the boiling water and sugar, cover, and let it stand several hours, or all night is not too long. More sugar may be added if required, and if liked it may be strained. VEGETABLE PLUM PUDDING.

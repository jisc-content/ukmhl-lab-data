46 Method:—Wash the lentils in several waters; if whole lentils are used, which make a richer soup, soak them over- night, according to “ Axioms ” (21). Melt the butter or dripping in a saucepan, cut up the onion and celery, and put them with the lentils into the saucepan, simmer over the fire five minutes with the cover on, stirring sometimes to prevent burn- ing ; add the water, stir well, and simmer from 1 to 2 hours, or until quite soft. Pour the soup through a wire sieve, rubbing the vegetables through with a wooden spoon, return the soup to the saucepan, season to taste, and let it boil up before serving. N.B.—(1) This soup is very good without passing it through a sieve, if cooked long enough. (2) The water in which meat has been boiled is good for this soup. SAUSAGE POLLS. Ingredients:—1 lb. sausages or cold meat, chopped and seasoned. Flaky or short paste. A little milk. Method :—Boil the sausages for five minutes, let them cool and take off the skins, then cut them in halves. Cut the paste in pieces about five inches square, put half a sausage (or seasoned meat) on each piece, wet the edge and fold the paste over, bringing the join at the top, and mark with the back of a knife. Brush them over with milk and bake in a hot oven about half hour. Serve hot or cold. FRIED SAUSAGES. Ingredients :—J lb. sausages. About 1 oz. dripping. Method:—Prick the sausages to prevent them bursting. Just melt the dripping in a frying-pan (do not let it get hot, or they will be more liable to break), and lay the sausages in. Let them get hot slowly, turning them until they are brown all over, cooking them about 10 minutes, but if pork allow 15 minutes.

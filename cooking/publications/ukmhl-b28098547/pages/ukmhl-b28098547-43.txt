- 39 (4) More water may be required, according to the quality of the meal. TOAD-IN-THE-HOLE. Ingredients :—8 oz. flour. 1 egg. 1 pint milk. 1 lb. beef or mutton. £ teaspoonful salt, or to taste. Dripping. Method:—Mix the flour and salt together in a basin, and make a well in the centre. Break the egg into another basin, and if good, put it into the centre of the flour ; stir in enough milk to make the mixture a smooth batter, beat it well, then add the rest of the milk, and set it aside to swell. Cut the meat into nice pieces. Melt some dripping in a baking-tin or pie-dish; pour the batter in, and then put in the meat, and bake in a quick oven at first, and then more gradually, to cook the meat, for about 1 hour. More fat can be added while cooking, if it appears dry. N.B.—(1) The meat retains its juices better if left whole. (2) Batter is lighter when the tin and fat have been made hot before putting it in. (3) Too much salt has the same effect on batter as it has on pastry, bread and cakes, making it heavy. EBUIT BAKED IN BATTER. A pound of any fresh fruit (not too acid, or it will curdle the batter) can be used instead of the meat, or figs, currants, raisins, or dates. PANCAKES. Ingredients :—4 oz. flour. 1 egg- \ pint milk.

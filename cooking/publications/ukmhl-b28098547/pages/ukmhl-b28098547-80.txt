76 Method . Have a saucepan ready with the boiling wo tor j add the salt to increase the heat, and have it boiling rapidly. Wash the rice well and throw it in, and boil very quickly about 13 minutes. Then put the cold water in and strain it through a wire sieve or colander; put it into the oven or in front of the fire until it is dry, and stir it with a fork occa- sionally to keep the grains separate. N.B.—The water may be used for starching aprons. OATMEAL BUNS. Ingredients :—3 oz. flour. -j lb. medium oatmeal. 4 oz. sugar, or to taste. 3 oz. clarified dripping, lard, or butter.' 1 egg- 1 teaspoonful baking powder. About \ pint milk, or as required. Method:—Put the fat into a basin, and beat it to a cream with a wooden spoon. Beat the egg and part of the milk to- gether, then add it with the other ingredients (except the baking powder) by degrees to the fat, making a rather moist mixture. Beat well all the time, and set it aside for as long as possible, for the oatmeal to swell. Then add the baking powder, and more milk if necessary; it should now be a stiff mixture. Put it into greased patty pans, and bake in a quick oven about 15 minutes. N.B.—(1) If the mixture is baked without giving time for the oatmeal to swell, the buns will not be so light and diges- tible. (2) Fine oatmeal does not require so much swelling, but it often imparts a bitter flavour, and is not so suitable for buns. The very coarse is not so suitable either for cakes. (3) Candied peel may be added if liked, or a few sultanas.

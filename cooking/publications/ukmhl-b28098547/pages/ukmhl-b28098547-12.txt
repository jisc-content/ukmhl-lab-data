This Syllabus is based on the following Rules:— !• That the lessons graduate from the simplest dishes, just as the teaching of any other subject should proceed from the elementary to the more advanced. 2. That all new classes commence with the first lesson and proceed in l-pgular order, instead of beginning with the same lesson, as those who have passed through part of a course. 3. That all the “Cookery Axioms” already formulated be included in this syllabus. 4. That in the case of Season Dishes none be omitted that have these special axioms, unless they have been given in a previous lesson. 5. Dishes bracketed thus (“) indicate that the second (b) may be used for practice, because the general method is the same for both, and that the first dish (a)—which, however, must be demonstrated—is usually difficult to dispose of, especially in the afternoon. 6. That two dishes requiring the same method should not occur in one lesson: e.g., Shepherd’s Pie and Milk Pudding. As these would both necessitate the use of ovens and pie-dishes, confusion might be caused, especially with young teachers. 7. The dishes demonstrated must be practised, but if some of the lessons, though enough for demonstration, should not prove sufficient for practice, dishes may be added from former lessons. With this object in view cold meat dishes are arranged prior to roasting and boiling meat; and this also obviates the difficulty of disposing of the meat. N.B.—Lesson No. 1 is arranged with the idea of intro- ducing albumen in its simplest form, when an egg will be cooked under boiling point, and another will be cooked by

47 N.B.—(1) If the sausages are fresh, and all meat, and are heated very slowly, they will not burst, and need not be pucked, and so all the gravy will be retained; but if they contain bread, as they often do, they must be pricked, as the bread swells, and causes them to burst. They can be served on toast or mashed potatoes, or on pieces of bread fried in the same fat, and if liked Brown Grai y served with them. (See receipt, page 42). (2) If the sausage meat is preferred, make it into round cakes on a floured board, just using enough flour to prevent them sticking, and fry in the same way. I LIVER AND BACON. Ingredients :—1 lb. sheep’s or calf’s liver. | lb. bacon. 1 tablespoonful flour. Salt and pepper. 1 gill water or bone stock. 1 onion (if liked). Method :—Cj.it the bacon into thin slices and take off the rind. Wash and dry the liver (but do not let it soak), and cut into slices about one-third of an inch thick, not thinner. Mix the flour with a little salt and pepper on a plate; dip each piece of liver into it, covering it well to protect it, and prevent it being hard, yet shaking off any loose flour, which will burn. Put the bacon into a frying-pan, fry about 4 minutes, turning it once, and put it round a hot dish. Then fry the liver (one piece must not be on the top of the other) about 15 minutes and turn it occasionally. It must be well cooked, as it is a very close meat, and must not be red when cut. Arrange it in the middle of the dish and keep it hot. Put the remainder of the flour into the frying-pan, stir it well until brown, add the stock ; stir it again until it boils, and pour it over the liver. N.B.—If an onion is liked, slice it, and fry with or after the liver, and put it on the top.

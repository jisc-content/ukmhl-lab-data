J lb. currants or sultanas. 1 oz. finely-chopped suet or clarified dripping. 1 6^7 or Nutmeg or any spice to taste. A little salt, and dripping to grease the dish. Method:—Cut the bread into small pieces, put them into a basin with sufficient cold water to cover, and soak until soft. Then press the water away, and beat the bread finely with a fork. Wash and dry the currants. Break the egg into a basin, beat it well, then add it to the bread with the currants, sugar, spiie, and salt. Mix well, put it in a well-greased pie dish or tin, and bake about 1 hour. Serve hot or cold, but if the latter, dripping is better than suet. N.B.—(1) A little finely-chopped orange rind or grated lemon, may be used instead of the currants for a change. (2) The rind of both fruits can be dried, grated and bottled, for flavouring; but whether used fresh or dried, the peel must be very thin, because the white pith produces a bitter flavour. (3) For a change this pudding is good steamed or boiled from two to three hours. When eggs are dear 1 gill of milk can be used instead.

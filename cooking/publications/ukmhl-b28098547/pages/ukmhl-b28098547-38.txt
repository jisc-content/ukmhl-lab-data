34 SUET PASTRY. Ingredients :—10 oz. flour. 2 oz. bread crumbs. 3 or 4 oz. suet 1 small teaspoonful baking powder, lvr gills water (about), j teaspoonful salt. Method :—Skin, shred, and chop the suet finely, flouring it a little (do not cut it in pieces, or it will take much longer to chop), then mix all the dry ingredients together, adding suffi- cient water to make the paste stiff enough for rolling out. Suet puddings are always lighter and more digestible if cooked the full 4 hours—this does not depend so much on the size, but is on account of the suet being a heavier fat. If dripping were used, they would be done in half the time, see “Axioms” (4). FRUIT PUDDING. Ingredients :—1 lb. fruit. 2 oz. sugar, or to taste. Water. Suet pastry. Method:—The general method is the same as for Meat Pudding, but observe notes 1, 2 and 3 for Fruit Pies, page 29; and, in the case of the pudding, take care to keep the sugar away from the lining of paste, for the reason given in note (No 2). N.B.—(1) All boiled or steamed puddings should be allowed to cool a little before turning them out, especially those made in this way, that is, with a lining, and filled with meat or fruit, as they are liable to burst. (2) Both apple puddings and pies are much improved by making a syrup with the apple peelings (as given below) and then poui'ing a little in the pie before serving, and for the pudding serve separately as a sauce. Apple Syrup :—Wash the peelings and put them into a small saucepan, adding the pips also, as they improve the flavour; j ust cover with cold water, add a tablespoonful of

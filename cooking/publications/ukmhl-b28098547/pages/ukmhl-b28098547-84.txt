80 PLAIN SODA CAKE. Ingredients :—1 lb. flour. 4 lb. butter or clarified dripping, i lb. sugar. T lb. currants or sultanas. 1 teaspoonful carbonate soda. H gills milk, or more. Sliced candied peel to taste. Method:—The same as for the buns, but baked in a cake tin, about 2 hours, or until a skewer comes out quite clean. EXETER STEW. Ingredients :—1 lb. shin of beef. 3 or 4 good-sized carrots. 2 or 3 good-sized turnips. 1 pint brown gravy. About -I, gill of vinegar. Salt and pepper. A few sprigs of parsley. Method:—Cut the meat into nice pieces, and lay them in the vinegar. Make the Brown Gravy (page 42), add more onions, but do not strain it, take the meat out of the vinegar and lay it in a stew-pan or jar, pour the hot gravy over, and stew very gently from 2 to 4 hours, as the meat needs it. Prepare the carrots and turnips, and cut them into strips about 2 inches long and \ inch thick, steam or boil gently in salt and water (just sufficient to cover them) | hour, or until quite soft. For serving, put the meat and gravy on to a hot dish, and pile the vegetables as high as possible on the top, putting a sprig of parsley here and there. N.B.—(1) This makes a very tempting-looking stew, and tough steak is nice done in the same manner, but would not require so long cooking. (2) Parsnips could be used instead of turnips for a change, and these vegetables are all delicious steamed, and then none of the good properties are lost. (3) If the meat is from the lower part of the shin, which is often very tough, it is better to leave it in the vinegar a few minutes.

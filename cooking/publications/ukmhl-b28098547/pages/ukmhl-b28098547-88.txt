Ingredients:—1 teaspoonful cornflour. s Jr pint milk. 1 oz. lump sugar. Method:—Mix the cornflour to a smooth paste with a little cold milk, put the rest of the milk into a very dean saucepan, when it boils stir in the cornflour, add the sugar and boil a few minutes. Beat the egg in a basin, and pom1 the cornflour gradually on to it, stirring well all the time. Then leave it to cool, stirring occasionally to prevent a skin forming on the top. N.B.—(1) If wanted thicker, the quantity of cornflour should be increased, and if a little flavouring is wanted, rub the sugar on an orange or lemon, or a small piece of cinnamon can be boiled with it, and afterwards taken out, or a little nut- meg may be grated on the top when it is ready for serving.

PEEFACE. A LTHOUGH COOKEKY, as a subject, bas made much, progress during tbe last decade, it is still, unfortunately, often placed on a different platform from almost any other subject; consequently the old mistaken ideas are yet extant, e.g., persons who think the exact measurements and fit of their garments indispensable, look upon cookery as a matter of instinct only, exact weights and measurements as superfluous, and old broken stoves, with a scarcity of utensils, a necessity ! The same class of people would most strenuously object to a house designed and built without proper regard to exactitude in measurements, &c., and to the furniture made without pro- per or with broken tools! Again, it is urged that the cookery curriculum should comprise little else but stews and potato cooking; but would this be teaching the subject of cookery? It is forgotten that the more a cook knows intelligently, the more thrifty and economical she can be (on the principle that the more a teacher knows of her subject the better she can simplify it); and that ignorance is the soul of waste, both as to time and material, would scarcely be disputed in any other branch. On the other hand, it is sometimes objected that the School Board course is too circumscribed, and not suggestive enough. These objections, it is hoped, are met in the present syllabus. The first course has been made as elementary and economical as possible, consistent with the necessity of making it sufficiently comprehensive and general. Various suggestive footnotes have been appended to many of the receipts to prevent a too narrow interpretation. Dishes slightly in advance of these are given for those pupils who are fortunate enough to remain at school, and go through a second course of cookery lessons. Nov., 1890. E. Briggs.

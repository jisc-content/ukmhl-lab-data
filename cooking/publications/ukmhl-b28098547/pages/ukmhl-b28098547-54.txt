50 Method:—The fire must be clear and bright, then heat the gridiron, which must be very clean, and grease the bars. Place the meat on it, and broil in front of or over the fire, putting it close to the fire for a minute to seal up the juices; then turn it on the other side for the same reason. Finish cooking it more slowly to make it tender, allowing from ten to twenty minutes, according to the thickness. It will be much more tender and full of gravy if turned very frequently. Put it on a hot plate and season to taste. N.B.—(1) This is a good method for invalids, but it is not an economical one for family dinners. (2) As the bars of the gridiron keep away as much heat as their breadth covers, it is very necessary to make it hot first. •(3) If the gridiron has a well to it, the gravy, of course, is saved; but all meat is much more easily digested when it retains its juices; so that it is better, both in broiling and frying, to turn the meat very often. The frying pan should also be made hot. (4) A fork should not be used, as it would make holes and let the gravy out. BAKED APPLE DUMPLINGS. Ingredients:— 6 or 8 apples. Sugar and cloves to taste. About 1 lb. short paste. Method .-—Peel the apples and core them without quartering them. Divide the paste into 6 or 8 pieces as required, form them into small rounds, put the apples on, fill the centres with sugar and two cloves ; then work the paste smoothly over, wet it and press well together. Place them, with the join down- wards, on a greased tin ; and bake in a hot oven about \ hour, or according to size. U.B. (1) When cloves are not liked, a little candied lemon, or raisins, or figs can be chopped and used instead. (2) These are very good steamed in a steamer when heating an oven is a difficulty.

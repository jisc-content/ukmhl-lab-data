40 Method :—Make the batter in the usual way, and set it aside as long as possible. Melt a piece of lard (about the size of a small nut) in a small frying-pan, and pour about lialf-a-teacup of batter in, raising the pan a little, or the cake will not be of equal thickness. Cook it over a moderate fire, and when browned on one side turn it carefully with a knife, or by tos- sing, and brown the other side also. Turn it on to kitchen paper, and roll it up. Repeat this until the batter is finished, and serve nicely on a hot dish with sugar and lemon, or orange juice to taste. They should be eaten at once. N.B.—(1) Lard or clarified fat is better than butter for frying pancakes with ; they are liable to stick with the latter. (2) They are sometimes preferred crisp, and served flat, not rolled ; more lard is then required, a hotter fire, and less batter for each cake. GRUEL. Ingredients:—1 flat tablespoonful coarse oatmeal. 1 pint boiling water. A pinch of salt. Method:—Have the boiling water ready in a small saucepan, add the salt and sprinkle in the oatmeal. Stir until it boils again, and simmer very gently about one hour, stirring occasion- ally ; then strain and serve with sugar or more salt, according to taste, and a little butter if allowed. It is almost a jelly when cooked in this way, and most nourishing. If patent groats or fine oatmeal is used it will not require so long cooking. N.B.—A thin piece of orange or lemon rind improves the flavour very much, and when acids can be taken, a little of the juice makes it much more palatable. HARICOT BEANS. Ingredients :—1 pint haricot beans. 1 oz. butter. £ teaspoonful salt. 1 tablespoonful chopped parsley. 3 pints boiling water. A little dripping. Salt and pepper to taste.

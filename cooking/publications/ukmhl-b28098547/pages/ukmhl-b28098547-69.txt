65 RICE SNOWBALLS WITH LEMON OR ORANGE SAUCE. Ingredients:—2 tablespoonfuls rice. 1 pint milk. 1 tablespoonful sugar, or to taste. A very small pinch of salt. Method:—Wash the rice, and put it into a clean saucepan •with the milk and salt. Stir until it boils, then simmer very gently about 1 hour, or until the rice is quite soft and has absorbed the milk. Then sweeten it, and pour into very small wet moulds. When quite cold, turn them out on to a dish, -and pour the sauce over. N.B.—Teacups or very small basins, half-full, will do instead of moulds. LEMON OR ORANGE SAUCE. Ingredients :— 1 lemon or orange. 1 tablespoonful brown sugar, or to taste. 1 teacupful cold water. Method .-—Peel the fruit very thinly indeed, and shred it very finely; put it into a clean saucepan, strain the juice and add it with the water and sugar, and simmer very slowly one hour, or until the rind is clear and curling. N.B.—(1) This sauce is very good with plain suet pudding or blancmanges. (2) Apples of equal size, peeled and cored, dipped into cold water, rolled in castor sugar, and baked in a tin containing half a gill of water until soft, are very wholesome served with the rice balls. (3) It is easier to put the rice into one large mould, but it does not look so nice.

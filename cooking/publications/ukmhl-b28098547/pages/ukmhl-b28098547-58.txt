54 Method .-—Prepare the raisins, currants, and peel as usual, and mix all the dry ingredients very thoroughly, beat the ?§§s any curdle the milk with the lemon juice, and stir them lnaking it a little moist. Grease a basin or mould, put the mixture in, and steam or boil from 4 to 6 hours. Plum puddings are very much nicer steamed. (1) Browned bread crumbs or raspings are sometimes added. (2) If preferred, h lb. suet can be added, but it is more digestible without. MINCE MEAT. Ingredients:—1 lb. apples. h lb. grapes (the cheap ones will do), r lb. raisins. ^ lb. currants. i lb. brown sugar, or to taste. 5 lb. mixed peel. Grated lemon or orange rind and juice to taste. 5 teaspoonful cinnamon, or to taste. A pinch of salt. Method :—Peel, core, and slice the apples, stone the raisins, wash and dry the currants, cut the peel finely, and chop these together until very fine, adding the sugar, which makes them easier to chop. Skin and stone the grapes, putting the pulp into a basin, and press well with a tvooden spoon, then add all the ingredients and mix very thoroughly. Put it into a jar, and tie it closely down at once. N.B.—(1) If wanted richer, a smaller quantity of apples can be used, and it is often preferred without the candied peel. (2) The grapes are instead of suet; they make the mince- meat more luscious and yet more digestible, because the suet is only cooked about twenty minutes or i hour when the pies are baking, thus making them very trying to digest. If wanted to be eaten cold, they are also much nicer without the suet.

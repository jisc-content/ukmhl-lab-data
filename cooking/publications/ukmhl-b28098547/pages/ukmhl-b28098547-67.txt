63 hour before cooking, and bake about one hour. Allow it to cool about five minutes before tur ning it on to a hot dish. N.B.—This pudding can be varied according to taste. Mar- malade, or preserve, or grated lemon rind, used instead of fruit, is very good; and at Christmas, when mincemeat is at hand a thin layer or two makes a pleasant change. STEWED LENTILS. Ingredients :—1 lb. lentils. 1 lb. onions (parboiled or scalded whole). 3 or 4 medium-sized carrots. 2 or 3 „ „ turnips. 1 tablespoonful chopped parsley or mint. 1 quart cold water or stock. A little dripping. Vinegar, salt and pepper to taste. Method:—Prepare the lehtils as for soup (see page 45), then put them into a stewpan with the water and dripping, and simmer 1-L hours or until soft. Cook the onions with the lentils from -}j hour to 1 hour, according to size. Cut the carrots and turnips into strips 2 inches long and ^ inch thick, and cook them separately in a little boiling water with salt in. For serving, take the onions out and place them in the centre of a dish, then stir the parsley and seasoning into the stew, let it boil a few minutes and add the vinegar; pour it round the onion, and pile the carrots and turnips on the top. (• N.B.—(1) The carrots and turnips can be cooked in the stew if liked, but they cannot then be piled on the top, and it will not look so tempting. (2) The stew must not boil after the vinegar is added, or the parsley will turn brown. •

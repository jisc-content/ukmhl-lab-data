Boil the spices in 5 pint vinegar for 15 minutes (an enamelled or preserving pan should be used); add the remainder of the vinegar, and pour it, when quite cold, on to the cabbage, enclosing the spices in a piece of muslin. Tie firmly over with thick paper, doubled, and it will be ready for use in about ten days or a fortnight.

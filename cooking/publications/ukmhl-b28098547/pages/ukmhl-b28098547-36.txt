32 NH5.—(1) Semolina or hominy makes the soup much more nourishing than sago or tapioca. Oatmeal makes it still more so, and should be used frequently in vegetable soups. (2) A strip of celery or seeds greatly improves the flavour. BREAD WITH YEAST. Ingredients :—31 lbs. flour. If pints tepid water (i.e., -J- boiling § cold). 1 heaped teaspoonful salt, or to taste. 1 teaspoonful sugar. 1 oz. German yeast, or 2 tablespoonfuls of brewer’s yeast. Method :~Put 3 lbs. of flour into a basin, mix the salt with it, and make a well in the middle. Put the yeast and sugar into another basin and work with a spoon to a smooth paste, then add the water gradually, to prevent lumps. Pour this into the well, work the flour in gradually, making it into a light dough; then knead it with the hands until smooth. Cover the basin with a cloth, and set it in front of the fire to rise about 2 hours. Then turn the dough on to a floured board, and knead in so much flour that it no longer sticks to the fingers or to the board. Divide it into two or three, as wished (just to half fill the tins), knead lightly and put into floured or greased tins. Set them before the fire again for about £ horn’, and bake in a hot oven at first, then bake more slowly from 1 to 2 hours, according to size. Do not open the oven door for about 10 minutes. For cottage-loaves, divide each piece of dough into two, one smaller than the other (more flour will be required), work both into balls, place the smaller on the larger one; make a hole in the middle of the top, and put the finger quite through to press them together, and bake on floured this, rising and baking as above. N.B.—(1) If German or French yeast is used be sure that it is fresh. It will not keep long, especially in hot weather; and as thunder, or any rough usage in the carriage of it, will kill the little yeast plant, it is better to try it by letting it stand about five minutes when mixed with the sugar.

38 BEEF TEA, No. 2 (Quickly Made). Ingredients :—^ lb. gravy beef. \ pint cold water. A pinch of salt. Method.: Shred the beef as finely as possible, removing all the skin and fat. Put it into a basin with the water and salt, and let it stand about 1 hour to draw out the juices. Pour the whole into a small saucepan, and let it be quite twenty minutes in getting hot; the more gradually it is heated, the better the tea will be. Do not let it boil, or the albumen which has been drawn out will be hardened. N-B.—(1) In hot weather, only small quantities should be made at a time, as it will not keep long. (2) This is not so good as No. 1, and should only be used if really wanted in a hurry. -,V OATMEAL PORRIDGE. Ingredients:—About 2 oz. coarse oatmeal. 1 pint boiling water, j teaspoonful salt or to taste. Method:—Sprinkle the salt into the boiling water, then the ■oatmeal, and stir until it boils again. Simmer very gently 1 hour, stirring frequently. Pour it smoothly over a plate, 'taking care not to leave any droppings on the edge of the plate. Serve it with milk, or with milk and sugar, or treacle. N.B.—(1) When porridge is wanted for breakfast, the oat- meal can be put into a jar with the water and allowed to stand in the oven (which is usually warm) overnight to swell, and then boil up for about £ hour next morning ; but it is not quite so nice. (2) Many people can digest oatmeal porridge when it has been cooked very slowly for 1 hour, who otherwise are obliged to avoid it. (3) In hot weather, when oatmeal may be found too heat- ing, whole meal or hominy can be used instead. The former needs only about twenty minutes’ cooking.

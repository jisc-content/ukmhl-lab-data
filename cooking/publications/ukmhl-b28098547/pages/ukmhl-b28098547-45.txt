41 Method:—Soak the beans overnight in cold water, and then strain them, and let them stand for a day or two, if possible. Put them into a saucepan with the boiling water and dripping, and I teaspoonful salt, and simmer gently two hours, or until quite soft. Drain the beans in a colander, return them to the saucepan with the butter, paisley, salt and pepper. Stir them over the fire five minutes, and serve in a hot vegetable dish. N.B.—(1) When the beans are to be served as a vegetable, putting them into boiling water will help to keep them whole,, and the dripping will prevent the skins breaking. (2) If the beans are allowed to stand after soaking, the starch will commence to change into sugar, making them much more palatable. (3) The beans vary very much in the time they take to soften. If they have been kept for a long time they are very- difficult to get soft. HARICOT BEAN STEW. Ingredients:—1 pint haricot beans. l| pints boiling water. A little dripping. 1 pint brown gravy. Method:—Prepare the beans as for a vegetable. Then put them into a saucepan with the water and dripping, and cook gently H hours, or until quite soft. Strain them, but do not . throw the water away, using it for the Brown Gravy instead of stock or plain water. Pour the gravy without straining, over the beans, and serve very hot. N.B.—(1) A little vinegar is an improvement, and it can be varied by the addition of other vegetables as liked, or more onions can be added in making the gravy. It is also very good served with rashers of bacon. (2) The water in which peas, beans, and lentils have been cooked should not be wasted, but used for soups stews or gravies; indeed, a good, nourishing stock can be made from haricot beans.

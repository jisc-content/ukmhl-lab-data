30 FISH FRIED IN BATTER. Ingredients .’—About li lbs. fish. £ lb. flour. 1 gill water. £ teaspoonful salt. Frying fat, parsley. Method :—Put the fat to get hot slowly while preparing the tish and making the batter. (This saves waiting, and also pre- vents burning. If the heating of the fat is left until after- wards it is often not allowed to get hot enough, through impatience, and the articles fried wall be sodden, greasy and indigestible). Any white fish is nice for frying, because this class of fish is more free from oil. Cut the fish into nice sized pieces, wash and dry them well and rub over with a little flour. The Batter:—Put the flour into a basin, mix it gradually into a smooth stiff batter with the cold water, adding the salt; dip the fish into this, and then fry about five minutes, or until a skewer goes through the flesh easily, observing all the rules for frying. Arrange the fish on a hot dish, and garnish with fried parsley if liked. To Fry Parsley:—Wash the parsley, shake it in a dry cloth, pick off the large stalks, fry it a few seconds only, as it very quickly bums, and drain it well before putting it on the fish. N.B.—(1) A very simple mode for frying fish is to dip it into milk and then into dry flour, instead of making a batter, but be careful to shake off any loose flour. (2) The batter is much improved by the addition of 1 oz. of clarified fat or butter melted, or 1 tablespoonful of salad oil (but the oil must be very good) and then the water used should be tepid. (3) The fish is best dipped in beaten egg and bread crumbs, hut it is more troublesome and expensive.

51 For Turnovers :—Quarter, core and cut up the apples, roll and cut the paste in squares or rounds, as liked; put the apples and a little sugar on one half, turn the other half over, wet and press the edges together, finishing them neatly. Jam or marmalade can be used for a change. COCOA. Ingredients:—Cocoa. Boiling water. Milk and sugar (if liked). Method:—For a breakfast cup, put in a teaspoonful and fill it up with boiling water, and add sugar and milk to taste. N.B.—(1) All cocoa is smoother and pleasanter to drink if boiled in a saucepan after the boiling water is poured on. The full value is obtained also, as there is nothing remaining at the bottom of the cup. This is doubtless due to the presence of starch in the cocoa beans, and the actual boiling a minute or two will burst the starch grains more thoroughly. (2) If the cocoa is mixed with cold milk first, and only the boiling water poured on to it, it is not really submitted to boiling heat, as the cold liquid in the cup and the cold cup will lower the degree of heat. STEWED BEEF AND BICE. ■ Ingredients:—b lb. leg of beef. 2 oz. rice. 1 large onion (scalded or parboiled). 1 pint hot water. 1 teaspoonful mixed herbs, or to taste. Salt and pepper. Vinegar. Method:—Cut the meat into nice pieces and dip them in vinegar, and lay them in a stewpan or jar, with the onion sliced and the herbs. Pour the water over, cover it closely, and stew from 2 to 4 hours, or until it is quite tender. Wash

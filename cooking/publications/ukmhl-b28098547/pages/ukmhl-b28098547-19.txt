15 N.B.—(1) If this is wanted with a savoury dish, the sugar must be omitted. (2) Sour milk makes very light puddings and cakes, and should not be wasted. (3) In hot weather the suet is better not chopped, but roll it with a little flour after shredding it, and rub it into the flour very lightly with the fingers. (4) The grated rind and juice of a lemon and a little more sugar makes this into a plain Lemon Pudding; or a little ginger may be used. (5) The exact quantity of water or milk is not given, because so much depends on the quality of the flour. This also applies to any farinaceous food. ROAST MEAT AND DRY ROASTING. See “Axioms” (5 and 6), page 100, and special notes, page 10S. GRAVY FOR ROAST MEAT. Method :—When the meat is cooked put it on a hot dish, and pour the dripping into a jar. Pour about a gill of hot stock or water into the dripping-pan, scraping the brown particles off, which adhere to the pan, and which colour the gravy. Strain and pour it round the meat, not over it, or it would not be crisp but sodden. Salt must not on any account be sprinkled on the meat to make gravy, for when the gravy is drawn from the meat the latter becomes dry and indigestible. N.B.—(1) The gravy will be a richer brown if, in making the stock, the skin is left on the onion. (2) A plain stock without vegetables can be made for plain roasts, if preferred.

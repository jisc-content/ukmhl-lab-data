49 "i put under the bacon and eggs, or round the dish, as preferred. Sometimes the eggs are trimmed, but this is wasteful. A cup put over each egg, just at first, will shape them and prevent the need of the trimming. 3ST.B.—(1) Bacon is often preferred broiled in a Dutch-oven in front of the tire or toasted on a fork. If it is wanted curled and crisp, the slices should not be more than two inches long, then rolled up and a skewer run through ; but if it is preferred mellow and soft, it can be soaked in hot water about 15 minutes, then dried in a cloth before broiling. This is especially good for ham, and if either are too salt, it draws it out. (2) Cold rashers of bacon, either boiled, broiled or fried, dipped in brea,d raspings, and just heated through, are good, the raspings preventing them getting hard. (3) Eggs are very difficult to digest when fried, and should never be given to invalids. The fat is twice as hot as boiling water, and therefore hardens the white or albumen of the egg much more.

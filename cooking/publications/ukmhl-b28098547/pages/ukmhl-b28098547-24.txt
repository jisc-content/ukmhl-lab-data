20 prevents them getting dry, which they would be liable to in an oven. (2) Frying is a quick method of cooking, though not an economical one; but this mixture is very good baked Pile it m a greased dripping-pan, and bake about 20 minutes in the oven or before the fire. The egg, bread crumbs and frying fat would then be dispensed with. (3) Fat for frying should be as free from salt as possible, as the salt prevents browning, so that clarified mutton fat and clarified dripping are both very good for this purpose. PEA SOUP. Ingredients :—1 pint split peas. f Two pennyworth cooked or uncooked bones. ( 2 quarts cold water. or 2 quarts of bone stock. 1 oz. dripping. 2 onions (parboiled and chopped finely). 1 turnip. 1 carrot. A strip of celery, or a few celery leaves or seeds. 1 teaspoonful brown sugar. 1 „ salt. Pepper to taste. Mint and toast. Method:—Wash the peas and soak them overnight in 2 quarts of cold water. Put the peas into a saucepan with the water in which they have been soaked, the bones, and the salt, sugar and dripping (the latter helps to soften the peas), let it heat very slowly ; this will also make the peas soften more readily. Skim it well before it boils, because the action of boiling will carry the scum down, and the soup will not be so good. Prepare the vegetables, and cut them into small squares; add them when the soup boils and simmer very gently about 2 hours, or until the peas are reduced to a pulp. Then take the bones out, season to taste and serve with powdered mint and squares of toast.

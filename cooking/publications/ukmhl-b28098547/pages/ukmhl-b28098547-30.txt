26 Method:—Cut the meat into nice pieces, mix the seasoning on a plate, dip the meat in it, place it in a pie-dish, and half fill the dish with boiling water to close the pores. When the steam has escaped wet the edges of the dish, line with narrow strips of paste, wet them also, cover it with paste, press it lightly down, trim the edges neatly, and draw them up with the back of a knife. Make a hole in the centre for the steam and gas to escape, ornament as liked, and bake in a hot oven at first (about 20 min.) to make the pastry rise, then cook it more slowly, (about 1 hour) to make the meat tender. KB.—(1) If cold water is poured over the meat, the juices will be drawn out, and the meat is then apt to be hard and stringy. (2) If the meat appears hard or tough, or very fresh (as it must be in hot weather), dipping it into vinegar will help to make it tender. (3) If the meat can be cut in slices and rolled, and put up- right in the pie dish, it retains its own gravy, rendering it much more digestible. MEAT PATTIES. Ingredients :—b lb. beef steak. 1 teaspoonful flour j teaspoonful salt A little pepper Short or flaky paste. Hot gravy or water. Method:—Mix the flour, salt and pepper, chop the meat finely, and dip it into this seasoning. Line patty pans with paste, put a little of the meat into each pan, and a very little hot water or gravy; cover with paste, press the edges well, and finish according to fancy. Make a hole in the centre, brush them over with milk to glaze them, and bake in a hot oven about 20 minutes, then cook very slowly another 20 minutes, to thoroughly cook the meat. Serve hot or cold. N.B.—(1) Any cold scraps of meat can be used, instead of fresh meat, but they would then only require the first 20 minutes’ cooking, in harmony with the “ Rules for Cooking Cold Meat,” page 102. j- Mixed.

25 Short or flaky paste. ROCK CAKES. Ingredients :— 1 lb. flour. 3 oz. dripping (clarified). 2 oz. currants. 2 oz. sugar. 1 eSS- About a- gill milk. 1 oz. peel (mixed). A pinch salt. 1 teaspoonful baking powder. A little grated nutmeg (if liked). Method:—Grease a baking-tin. Wash the currants, and beat the egg with a little of the milk. Beat the dripping to a cream, add the dry ingredients, and the egg and milk gradually, beating all the time. Put just sufficient milk to make it a stiff paste, or the cakes will not be rocky in ap- pearance. Drop the mixture on to the tin in little rough heaps with two forks and bake in a quick oven about 15 minutes. N.B.—(1) If the oven is not quite hot, the cakes will spread quite flat. (2) Baking powder should be added last whenever possi- ble, as it loses power as soon as it comes in contact with any moisture. When the mixture is very stiff, the baking powder should be added to the last portion of milk. (3) Salt is not needed when butter or lard is used instead of dripping. (4) The exact quantity of milk cannot be given, because the flour varies in the amount it absorbs, according to its quality. Good flour absorbs more moisture than poor flour. MEAT PIE.

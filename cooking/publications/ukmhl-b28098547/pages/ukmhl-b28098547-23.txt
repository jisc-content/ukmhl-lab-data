Ingredients: -1 lb. cooked fish (any scraps). 1 lb. mashed potatoes (warm). 1 tablespoonful milk, or 1 oz. butter. 2 eggs (not required if the mixture is baked). f teaspoonful salt 1 or to taste. | teaspoonful pepper J Parsley.

Put the potatoes, salt and pepper into a basin; add the milk (if butter is used, melt it before adding it) and one egg to bind it, and mix thoroughly ; but do not make it too moist. Stir the fish in lightly, divide the mixture into small portions, and shape it with a knife on a floured board into cakes about 1 inch thick. Put the bread crumbs on a sheet of clean paper. Beat the other egg on a plate, brush the cakes over with it, and dip them in the crumbs. Try the fat, and if hot enough, fry them about 5 minutes ; drain on kitchen paper, and cover with paper also, to absorb the fat. Arrange on a hot dish.

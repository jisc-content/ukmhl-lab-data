101 7. Rules for Boiling Fish. I. The fish must not be left in the water after washing, or it will lose its flavour and firmness. II. Cook it in a small quantity of waterâ€”one pint for 2 or 3lbs. III. To each pint add a teaspoonful of salt, a tablespoonful of vinegar, and 6 peppercorns. The fins of the fish should also be added. IY. Put it into hot (not quite boiling) water to keep it firm. V. If there is no fish kettle, tie it in muslin, so that it can be lifted out whole. VI. Simmer very gently, to prevent it breaking. Boiling fast spoils the flavour. VII. After 10 minutes try it with a skewer. If the flesh move readily from the bone it is done. VIII. Take it out of the water as soon as it is done, to prevent it breaking. IX. Use the water for the sauce. 8. Rules for Melted Butter. I. All sauces containing flour must boil, to burst the starch grains. II. If this sauce is left boiling too long it will become too thin. 9. Rules for Soups with Meat or Boues. I. Chop the bones a little, or cut up the meat, to allow the nutriment to be the more easily extracted. II- Put them into cold water and add salt and brown ugar to extract the nutriment. III. Skim it just before it reaches boiling point, to prevent the scum being carried down into the stock or soup. IV. Simmer gently, and keep the lid on closely to prevent the steam and flavour escaping.

(Simple.) Ingredients :—To each pound of fruit allow— ■| lb. loaf sugar. Method:—Pick the strawberries, put them into the preserv- ing pan with the sugar. Take off the scum as it rises, let it boil very quickly for 1 hour, or as required. Try it in the usual way by putting a little on a plate, and if it sets quickly it is done. Cover as for Marmalade (page 55). N.B.—(1) Small hard strawberries are best for preserving, as they keep whole more easily. (2) This preserve requires almost constant skimming, or it will not be clear. (3) Do not stir it or the fruit Avill break, but simply put a spoon in gently to see that it is not burning. STRAWBERRY JAM. Ingredients:—To every pound of fruit allow— l-|r lbs. loaf sugar. 1 pint red currant juice. Method :—Choose the strawberries not too ripe and of good colour. Pick off the stalks, lay the strawberries in a dish, and sprinkle over them half the quantity of sugar, which must be pounded. Shake the dish gently that the sugar may be equally distributed, and let it remain for one day. Currant Juice :—Put the currants into a jar, place the jar in a saucepan of boiling water, let it simmer until the juice is drawn from the currants, then pour it off and put 1 pint into a saucepan or stewpan, boil it with the remainder of the sugar until it forms a thin syrup, and in this simmer the straw- berries until the whole is sufficiently jellied. Great care must be taken in stirring, as the fruit should bo preserved as whole as possible. H

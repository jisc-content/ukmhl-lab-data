78 has absorbed tbe milk. Sweeten to taste, pour it into a wet mould, and when cold turn it out, and serve with Stewed Fruit. N.B.—(1) If the hominy be soaked over night in just sufficient hot water to cover, it will not require so long cooking, but it is not quite so nice. (2) When the blancmange is served plain, without the stewed fruit, the lump sugar rubbed on an orange or lemon is a great improvement, or any flavouring liked can be added. (3) When the sugar is added at the last, the blancmange is not so liable to burn. STEWED FRUIT. Ingredients:—1 lb. fresh fruit. pint water. 2 oz. lump sugar, or to taste. Method :—Boil the water and sugar for 10 minutes, taking- off the scum, then add the fruit and simmer slowly until it is quite soft but not broken. Stir frequently, taking great care to keep the fruit whole; when done, lift it out carefully, place it on a dish, let the syrup boil up, then pour it over the fruit. N.B.—(1) More sugar may be required according to the kind of fruit. A little thin lemon rind is an improvement to nearly all fruits. (2) Pears with this syrup poured over and stewed 5 or 6 hours in a very slow oven, will be a very pretty colour. SAVOURY MACARONI. Ingredients :—3 to 4 oz. Naples macaroni or hominy. 1 pint milk. 2 oz. grated cheese, or to taste. I oz. butter. 1 tablespoonful bread crumbs. Salt and pepper to taste.

21 N.B.—(1) The soup is much improved bypassing it through a wire sieve, before the mint is added. (2) This will be a richer and better soup if the bone stock is made according to the receipt page 13. (3) The bones must not be put into boiling water, or soup, or the nourishment will not be extracted. (4) Sometimes the peas will do without soaking, if they are not too old. SEED CAKE (VERY PLAIN). Ingredients:—10 oz. flour. 2 oz. dripping (clarified). 2 oz. sugar. 1 egg- 2 teaspoonfuls caraway seeds. 1 teaspoonful baking powder. About 1 gill milk. A pinch of salt. Method:—Grease a cake-tin. Beat the egg and a little of the milk together. Beat the dripping in a basin to a cream with a wooden spoon and add the dry ingredients (except the baking powder) and the egg and milk by degrees, beating all the time. Make it a rather moist mixture, and add the baking- powder just before putting it into the tin, beating it again. Bake in a hot oven about hour. N.B.—(1) This receipt can be varied according to fancy; by putting \ lb. currants or sultanas and a little spice, or lb. treacle and ginger to taste, will make it a plain ginger cake. (2) If 2 ozs. more dripping can be afforded the cake will keep moist longer. (3) See that the flour is quite dry before using it for cakes, pastry or bread ; if it is damp they will be heavy. (4) When currants are used, and are cleansed by washing, they must be dried before adding them to the cake, or it will be heavy. c

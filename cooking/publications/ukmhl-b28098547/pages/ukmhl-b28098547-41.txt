- 37 BROWNED BREAD CRUMBS OR RASPINGS. Method:—Put any scraps of dry bread and ci'usts on a baking-sheet or tin, and put them into the oven until they are evenly bi-owned. Then crush them on a board with a rolling- pin and shake them through a wire sieve, rolling again those that are not fine enough to pass through, and put them aside for use in a dredger. N.B.—(1) These crumbs are useful also for dredging boiled ham or bacon with, and can be used in puddings instead of the usual fresh bread crumbs. They are often used to make a plain Plum Pudding look rich. (2) Where there is not a wire sieve, the crumbs that will not pass through the dredger should be rolled again. BEEF TEA. No. 1. Ingredients:—\ lb. gravy beef or steak. £ pint cold water. A pinch of salt. Method:—Take away the skin and fat from the meat and shred it very finely ; put it into a jar or basin containing the cold water and salt, and let it stand 1 hour, or as long as possi- ble. Cover the jar closely (if there is not a lid tie a piece of greased paper over), and place it in a saucepan of cold water; let the water come very sloidy to boiling point, and simmer gently 1 hour or longer. Strain it through a rather coarse strainer, so as not to lose the little brown particles, and pass pieces of kitchen paper over the tea to absorb any fat there may be ; this is the only skimming the tea requires. Foods for invalids should never be greasy. N.B.—(1) If the shin of beef is not of the best, it is more economical to buy cheap steak. (2) If wanted stronger, use the half quantity of water. When it cannot be taken hot, about a teaspoonful of gelatine added will make it a jelly, and many invalids prefer it in this form.

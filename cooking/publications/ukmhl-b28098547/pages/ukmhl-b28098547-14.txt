10 RECEIPTS. VEGETABLE SOUP. Ingredients :—1 large carrot. 4 large potatoes (parboiled). 1 small turnip. 1 large onion (parboiled or scalded).* 1 oz. dripping. A few celery leaves, or strip of celery. 1 teaspoonful brown sugar (if liked). 1 teaspoonful of salt. Method:—Wash all the vegetables except the onion, and peel it and the potatoes before parboiling; peel the turnip also, and scrape the carrot and celery, then cut them all into very small pieces. Melt the dripping in a saucepan, add the vegetables and simmer them about 10 minutes, stirring occa- sionally to prevent burning; then add the water and salt, and simmer 1 hour or until quite soft. Skim off the fat, season to taste, and serve.—To parboil potatoes : Simmer them whole about 5 minutes. U.B.—(1) It is an improvement to strain this through a wire sieve or colander into a basin, and rub the vegetables through with a wooden spoon. Then pour the whole back into the saucepan ; just let it boil, stirring a few times, and serve with toasted bread. * (2) See “Axioms” (23) The observance of this rule makes soups, stews, and any dishes containing onions more digestible. Scalding them does not draw out quite so much of the oil, but if to be fried, they are easier to brown than when parboiled. (3) A parsnip or any vegetable in season can be added. h teaspoonful of pepper 3 pints boiling water.

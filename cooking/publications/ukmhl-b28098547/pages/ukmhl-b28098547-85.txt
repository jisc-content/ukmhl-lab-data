SI SWISS PUDDING. Ingredients :—1 lb. apples. About 6 oz. bread crumbs. 1 egg- 1 oz. moist sugar, or to taste. 1 oz. butter. 1 or 2 tablespoonfuls of cold water. Method :—Peel, core and cut up the apples, put them into a small saucepan with the sugar and water, and stew to a soft pulp. Separate the egg, add the yolk to the apples, stirring well, beat the white to a stiff froth, and stir it in lightly. Butter a pie-dish well (H pint size), line it with crumbs (1 inch thick at the bottom and as many as will adhere to the sides), put the mixture in, cover with crumbs, and put what butter is left on the top in small pieces. Bake in a quick oven about 20 minutes—the crumbs should be nicely browned —turn it out carefully on to a hot dish and dredge with white sugar. Serve it with Apple Syrup. N.B.—(1) Invalids usually enjoy this pudding very much,' and it is nice for anyone who cannot take pastry. (2) The egg can be omitted and lump sugar rubbed on an orange or lemon, or any other flavouring can be added. FEIED CHOPS OE STEAKS. Method:—Trim the chops and put a little of the fat into a frying-pan ; when quite hot put the meat in, let it remain one , minute to seal up the juices, then turn it with a knife and spoon (not a fork), and seal up the juices on the other side in the same way. Then cook it as slowly as possible from 10 to 20 minutes, according to the thickness. The more slowly it is cooked after the first two minutes and the more frequently it is turned, the more tender it will be. If there is no fat with the steak use a small piece of nice dripping, just to moisten the pan. If pork chops, serve with Apple Sauce.

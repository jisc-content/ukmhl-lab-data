77 SAVOURY BATTER. Ingredients :—6 oz. flour. 1 pint milk. 1 egg. 2 tablespoonfuls chopped parsley. 1 teaspoonful thyme and majoram (mixed). About £ lb. scraps of cold meat. 1 oz. dripping, or scraps of fat. Salt and pepper. A pinch of baking powder. Method :—Make a batter with the flour, milk, and egg, and set it aside to swell. Chop the meat finely, taking away any fat, skin, or gristle, dredge it with flour, and mix with it the parsley, herbs, salt, and pepper. Put it into the batter, add- ing the baking powder, and beat the whole well. Melt the fat in a pie dish, pour the mixture in, and bake about £ hour, or until the batter is cooked, in a hot oven at first to raise the batter, and then more slowly lest the meat should get hard. When done, slip a knife round it, and turn it on to a hot dish. If liked, serve it with Brown Gravy. N.B.—(1) Almost any scraps of meat can be mixed together for this dish. If, however, pork is used, sage and onions should be added instead of the parsley and thyme. (2) Any scraps of fat taken from the meat should be melted and used instead of the dripping.

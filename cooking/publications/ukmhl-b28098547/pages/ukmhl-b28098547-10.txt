6 cleaning knives, scrubbing, etc. This order is reversed each week to equalise the amount of practice. While the first 12 girls are practising, the second copy the day’s “Axioms” from the large sheets into an exercise book kept especially for this purpose; any spare time may be used in copying Receipts from the printed Book of Receipts,* into another exercise book,f which they may take home to enable them to practise, and in which they are encouraged as much as possible. N.B.—As there are always some Pupils who do not obtain prizes, the separate small copies of “ Axioms ” are given to these on leaving, but this is not necessary, where they do gain a prize, as the Axioms are incorporated with the Receipt Book, because they are frequently referred to in it, to save repetition. * The Receipt Book for this purpose is strongly bound, 12 copies of which are allowed for each Centre, but care is necessary, as the girls destroy and disfigure them very much sometimes. To obviate this diffi- culty and to help the teacher in finding out the culprits, the receipts have been arranged consecutively according to the syllabuses, so that the books can be strapped down with elastic bands on the pages for the lesson. f The “Axiom” exercises are corrected by the teachers; these corrections are necessarily few now they are copied and not dictated. As the receipt exercise books are allowed to be taken home, these are not corrected.

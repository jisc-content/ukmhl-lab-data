2S HUNTER PUDDING. Ingredients :—10 oz. flour. 2 oz. bread crumbs, or 4 tablespoonfuls. \ lb. suet (finely shredded and chopped). 6 oz. raisins (valentia or sultana) or | lb. currants. 2 oz. brown sugar. 1 teaspoonful baking powder. A pinch of salt. Water or sour milk (sufficient to make it moist). Method:—Have a saucepan of boiling water ready. If large raisins are used, pick and stone them; if sultanas or currants are used, clean and pick them. Mix all the dry ingredients together, and make it a rather moist mixture with the water or sour milk. Put it into a well-greased basin ■cover with greased paper, and steam or boil from 2 to 4 hours. N.B.—Pudding-cloths must be carefully washed and dried : the flavour of puddings is frequently spoiled by a musty cloth. The danger of this is entirely avoided by steaming, and is much less trouble. Another advantage is that the pudding can rise or swell to its full extent, because the greased paper covering it rises with it. MELTED BUTTER. Ingredients:—1 oz. butter. From h to 1 oz. flour (according to the thickness required). ■§ pint cold water. A pinch of salt. Method :—Melt the butter in a small saucepan, add the flour, and stir over the fire one minute to cook the flour, add the water by degrees, stirring all the time until its boils ; add salt to taste, and let it boil slowly about three minutes.. N B.—(1). When used for puddings, sugar to taste (about 1 tablespoonful) must be added.

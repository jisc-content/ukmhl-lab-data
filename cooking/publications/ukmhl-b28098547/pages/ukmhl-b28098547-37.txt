(3) When it is baked place the loaves sideways, or on a sieve, to let the steam escape, or it will be absorbed into the crust. Do not take them into a cooler atmosphere until they are quite cold—the cold air is heavier than the warm, light steam, and will force it back again, and the bread will not be so light.

V Seasoning. i „ „ pepper J Suet paste (quantity as given below). Method:—Cut the meat in squares, or in slices and rolled as for Meat Pie, and dip into the seasoning. Put it into a basin or pie dish, pour the boiling water over to close the pores, and set it aside to cool while making the paste. * Grease another basin (II pt. size), cut off I of the paste and form the larger piece into a ball, then roll it to twice the size of the top of the basin, line the b^sin with it, put the meat and water in. Form the smaller piece into a ball also, and roll it out to the size wanted for the top, wet the edge of the lining, cover it, press the edges together, and steam or boil from 2 to 4 hours. N.B.—(1) Leg of beef can be used, and is quite as nourish- ing and very much cheaper, but the pudding must then be cooked the full 4 hours to make the meat tender. (2)* If the boiling water were poured into the basin lined with paste, the paste would be heavy.

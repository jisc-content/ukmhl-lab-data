.43 the older potatoes, which prevents the escape of their own moisture; and so the new potato is apt to be shrivelled and tough when baked, the sap having escaped. For this same reason, new potatoes, fresh from the earth, are much better in flavour than those that have been kept. This applies also to nearly all vegetables. ROLY-POLY PUDDING. Ingredients:—Suet paste (see receipt, page 34). About b lb. jam. Method:—Put the paste (which must not be too moist) on a floured board, and roll it to a long thin piece. Spread the jam over it, within half an inch of the edge; then wet the edges, roll it up, and press the ends together. Flour the pudding and put it with the join downwards in a dry pudding cloth; roll the cloth round it, leaving room for it to swell, and tie it at each end with string. Cook it according to the rules for boiled suet puddings, from 2 to 4 hours. When taking it up, let it stand a little, or pour a little cold water over quickly, and it will turn out of the cloth more easily. Serve on a hot dish, plain or with melted butter. N.B.—(1) This is very good for a change, spread with treacle, then a layer of bread crumbs and a sprinkling of ginger, instead of the jam. At Christmas a layer of mincemeat can be used for another change; or a layer of chopped apples, raisins, and sugar make it into Eve’s Pudding. (2) Many people prefer the paste made with dripping beaten . up as for short pastry, instead of the suet. It would then only require lg hours’ boiling, or it is very good baked about 1 hour.

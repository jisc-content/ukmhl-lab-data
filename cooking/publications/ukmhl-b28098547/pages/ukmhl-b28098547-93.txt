89 chop them finely, and mix them with the forcemeat. Put a little piece of forcemeat on the end of each slice of beef, roll them up and tie each one with cotton. Place them upiight in a stewpan, pour the boiling gravy over, cover closely, and sim- mer gently 1 hour, or until quite tender j then take the olives out, remove the cotton, and arrange them on a hot dish j thicken the gravy with the flour, stir until it boils, let it boil 3 or 4 minutes, season to taste, colour with a little browning, and strain it over them. N.B.—Slices of cold meat may be used, but cook h hour only. FORCEMEAT. Ingredients:—3 oz. bread crumbs or scraps of stale bread. 1 oz. dripping or beef marrow, or butter. 1 tablespoonful chopped parsley. £ teaspoonful mixed herbs. A little milk. A very little nutmeg. Salt and pepper. Method:—If scraps of bread are used, soak them in milk until soft, drain away any liquid that is not absorbed, and beat it finely with a fork. Mix the bread, parsley, and herbs very well, just melt the fat, stir it in, and season to taste. N.B.—(1) A little grated lemon rind is an improvement, but all seasonings should be added most carefully; merely a suspicion of them is required, not a strong flavour. (2) This makes a light, crumbling forcemeat, and is more digestible than a close one. It will also do for fowls, veal, rabbits, or forcemeat balls; but an egg would be required for the latter to bind them, the addition of which would make it closer. BROWNING FOR GRAVIES.

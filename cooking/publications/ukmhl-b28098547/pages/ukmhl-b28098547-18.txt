SUET PUDDING Ingredients:—10 oz. flour. 2 „ bread crumbs. 3 or 4 „ suet. 1 tablespoonful brown sugar. 1 teaspoonful baking powder. A pinch of salt. Cold water or sour milk. Method :—Have ready a saucepan of boiling water. Skin, shred and chop the suet finely. Put all the dry ingredients into a bowl, and mix into a rather moist paste with the water or sour milk. If it is to be boiled, dip the pudding cloth into the boiling water, wring, and sprinkle it with flour, turn the mixture into it, tie it tightly, leaving room for it to swell, put it into the saucepan, and boil from 2 to 4 hours. But if steamed, grease a basin or mould well, put the mixture in, cover it with greased kitchen-paper, and put it into a steamer, or into a saucepan with only sufficient boiling water to reach half-way up the basin. Have a kettle of boiling water to re- new it occasionally.

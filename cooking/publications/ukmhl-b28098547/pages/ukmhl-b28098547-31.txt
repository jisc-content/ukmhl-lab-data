27 (2) If the pies or patties are not moist enough, pour a little gravy in through the hole in the centre j a small funnel is useful for this. SHORT PASTRY. Ingredients: —1 lb flour. 6 oz. dripping (clarified). 1 teaspoonful baking powder. A pinch of salt. Sufficient cold water to make a stiff paste. Method:—Put the flour in a basin, and mix the salt and baking-powder with it. Beat the dripping on a flat dish or plate with a knife until it is quite creamy, then rub it as quickly and lightly as possible into the flour. Add the water very carefidly, and let the. paste be quite dry and crumbling, turn it on to a floured board, roll it once only before using it, and bake it in a hot oven at once. N.B.—(1) Pastry, or cakes containing baking powder, should be baked at once, or it will lose its power. (2) Beating the fat makes the paste very short, and when dripping is used, also purifies it entirely from any dripping flavour, by the introduction of air while beating it. (3) When the fat is rubbed into the flour very little rolling is required. (4) For sweet dishes, a tablespoonful of white sugar is an improvement. ROUGH FLAKY PASTRY. Ingredients :—f lb. flour. 6 ozs. lard or clarified dripping 5 teaspoonful baking powder. A pinch of salt. Cold water.

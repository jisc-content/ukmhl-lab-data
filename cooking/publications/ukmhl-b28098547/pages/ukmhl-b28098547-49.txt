A few drops of vinegar or lemon juice. Method:—Have the 'water ready boiling, in a very clean Frying-pan, and put in the salt and vinegar. Break the egg carefully into a cup, draw the pan aside, slip the egg in very gently, and simmer until the white is set. Lift it out care- fully with an egg slice, and serve on dry or buttered toast. N.B.—(1) The following method is more digestible, and more suitable for invalids. Butter a cup or a very small basin, break the egg into it, then place the cup in a saucepan of boiling water, and simmer gently until set. Slip a knife around the edges, and it will easily leave the cup. Another advantage of this method is that the edges are smooth and shapely, and need no trimming, which is wasteful. (2) Quite new-laid eggs are difficult to poach, they are so creamy; but they must be fresh. LENTIL SOIJP. Ingredients:—1 pint lentils. 1 carrot. 1 onion (parboiled).

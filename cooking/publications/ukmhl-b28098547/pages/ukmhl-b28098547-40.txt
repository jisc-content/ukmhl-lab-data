36 —This kind of bread should be mixed as quickly, and handled as little as possible, and the dough made more moist than yeast bread. Some people can digest this kind more easily. BAKED HADDOCK. Ingredients :—1 fresh haddock. About 2 oz. stale bread. ,, 1 gill milk. 1 tablespoonful chopped parsley. 1 teaspoonful herbs (or to taste). Salt and pepper to taste. 2 oz. dripping. Method:—Wash and dry the fish, take the eyes out, and rub a little salt up the backbone, which makes the fish more savoury. Cut the bread into small pieces and soak in the milk until soft; then strain if too moist, and beat finely. Then add the parsley, herbs, salt, and pepper, and mix well. Put this forcemeat inside the fish and sew or skewer it up; then tie it in a nice shape, and dredge it with salt, pepper and flour. Melt the dripping in a baking tin, put the fish in, and bake ‘ -about 5 an hour in a hot oven, basting it frequently. When done, place it on a hot dish, draw out the string and skewers, and serve plain or with brown gravy. H.B.—(1) The haddock maybe boned, stuffed, and rolled up for a change. (2) An egg or a little butter (melted) may be added to the forcemeat if wanted richer. (3) A few bread crumbs sprinkled on the top of the fish is an improvement, or browned bread crumbs or raspings. BROWN GRAVY FOR HADDOCK. Method:—Pour the fat from the tin; dredge a little flour into it; brown it in the oven, but take care that it does not burn. Then pour a little hot water in ; stir it well, and put it back into the oven to boil; strain, and serve with the fish.

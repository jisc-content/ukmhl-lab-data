18 after a few minutes—if the skewer separates the flesh easily, it is done—and take it up carefully at once, as it will quickly fall to pieces and lose flavour if it is cooked too long. Serve it on a very hot dish. N.B.—(1) See that the fish is fresh (stale fish is most un- wholesome, and therefore not cheap at any price); test it by pressing the fingers on the flesh. If it is firm and elastic and springs back, it is good, but, if it is soft and an impression is made, it is stale. (2) No special time can be given for cooking fish, because more depends on the thickness and kind of fish than the exact weight. A long flat fish weighing the same, would require less cooking than a small thick piece. (3) As fish contains a large proportion of water, only just sufficient to create steam is required for cooking it. The flavour is lost to a great extent in a large quantity of water, nor is the fish so light and digestible. A further advantage of this mode is that the skin of the fish will not be cracked by putting it into boiling water, as it does not nearly cover the fish, and thus the goodness is retained; but the rule for gentle cooking must be carefully observed. (4) The dish should be very hot for serving it on, and, when an old tablecloth is done with, there is sometimes a small whole piece left, which will make into a napkin for serving it on. PLAIN SAUCE FOR BOILED FISH. Ingredients :—1 tablespoonful flour. i pint of the water the fish is cooked in. Method .-—Mix the flour quite smooth with a very little cold water, add the fish water (strained) gradually, stirring well, then put into a small saucepan, stir until it boils, and serve with the fish. If parsley is added, it should be washed and well dried before chopping, and should not be put into the sauce until it has boiled, or the acid of the vinegar will turn it brown.

CHAPTER XI. SAUCES AND GAENISHES. SAUCES. The following are the principal sauces and gar- nishes which are used in cookery. IMany of them have been mentioned in the course of these pages, and as the names frequently convey no idea of their ingredients, a slight description of them is given. The two chief sauces are Veloute—white, and Espagnole—brown. Many other sauces are made from these. Allemande is a thicker form of veloute sauce. Anchois (Anchovy)—melted-hutter sauce with anchovy, &c. Aurore—AUemande and tomato sauce, with Chili vinegar, &c. Bearnaise—yolks of eggs, butter, French vinegar, chopped parsley, &c. Beclianiel—Yeloute sauce with cream. This is also made without stock if a maigre sauce is required. Beurre—melted-hutter sauce.

THE PANTRY 39 dinner, so that there may be a different set for each person, a hint which I took from Mrs. Beeton; and which is very economical, as if any are broken, it is not necessary to buy a complete service. In every household there should be a book with the list of glass and china, which should be gone through quarterly ; also when servants leave and arrive, it should be gone through with them; and should be signed by them and dated.

London: HUTCHINSON & CO., 34. PATERNOSTER ROW. A FEW PRESS OPINIONS ON “THE HOUSEHOLD ORACLE.” QUEEN. “ This is one of the most wonderful three-and-sixpence worths published. It is a regular encyclopaedia, and seems remarkably well done. The cookery receipts are good.” LADY’S PICTORIAL. An invaluable compendium, and when it has been consulted once or twice by the members of a busy household, it will be found to deserve its name of ‘ House- hold Oracle.’ No household should be without this well-edited and useful Oracle.” HEARTH AND HOME. “ This large and remarkably cheap book. In something over a thousand columns it deals with everything." DUNDEE ADVERTISER. " A wonderful book indeed is ' The Household Oracle.’ As a book of reference on all subjects of household management, from the building of a residence to the carving of a chicken, the volume will become an authority." YORKSHIRE POST. " No young housekeeper could receive a more useful gift than ' The Household Oracle.’ It is full of good advice and general information.” BIRMINGHAM GAZETTE. " A most comprehensive work, containing information upon all subjects. This is one of the most complete books of its kind published, to be recommended to all housekeepers wishing to have a fund of knowledge at their finger ends.” DAILY GRAPHIC. " Contains sufficient condensed knowledge to make a whole library of books of reference superfluous. To say what it does not contain would be easier than to say what it covers.” LITERARY WORLD. "A veritable ‘apply within for everything’ for information on all pertaining to house and garden, land and farm. An extremely useful book." EASTERN MORNING NEWS. “ Mr. Miles has compiled one of the best works of household reference we have yet seen." LIVERPOOL MERCURY. " It would indeed be difficult to find a subject connected with the home which is not treated on in this comprehensive volume, which is a marvel of cheapness. ’

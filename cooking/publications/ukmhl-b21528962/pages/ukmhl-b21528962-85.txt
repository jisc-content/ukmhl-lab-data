73 PART II COO KINO RECIPES A AD MENUS PLAIN COOKING “ True economy in the household has Heaven for its banker.” Large joints are only suitable for large families, as freshly cooked meat is lighter and more digestible than that which has been recooked and warmed up. Of course cold meat with salad is very nice for a change, but no one cai'es to feed on such cold comfort day after day. How many young housekeepers, ay, and older ones too, are utterly helpless when called upon to order meat for a small household. Their ideas lake the form of legs and shoulders of mutton and ribs and sirloins of beef, with hashes and minces to use up the remains. With a little thought and ex- perience all this may be avoided, and the aim of a good housewife is to have but few scraps beyond what should go into the stockpot. The best plan is to cook small portions of joints at a time, and to avoid purchasing those joints which cannot be divided. A sirloin of beef may be divided into thx’ee parts— the xxpper cut, the xxnder cut, and the lump at the end. The under cut can be made into fillets, and is x’eally the best beefsteak one can have, as it is so juicy and tender. The upper cut of the sirloin can be roasted, axxd makes a good cold joint after ; and then what is left can be minced, hashed, curried, or made into rissoles. The bone fx-om this may be either thrown into the stock-pot, or grilled for bi'eakfast. The piece at the end of the sirloin can be made into a pie with the addition of kidneys or pigeons, or into a steak pudding, or it might be salted and boiled.

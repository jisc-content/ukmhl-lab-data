THE housewife’s llEFEHEE 15G with tape, put the six olives into a small stewpan with a teacupful of good gravy, and simmer for two hours; baste the olives constantly with the gravy; take them out, remove the tape, carefully; put them neatly on a dish; skim and strain the gravy, add half a wineglass of marsala and the strained juice of a lemon; pour it over and serve. Veal, Tendons of, and Spinach.—That part of the veal which is called tendons consists of the gristly portion of the breast bone which has not yet become hardened into bone; this is situated towards the thick edge of the breast of veal. After having removed the meat from the tendons, cut them straight along the end of the rib bones, leaving the flap of meat on to the ribs; next slice oft’ such portion of the breast bone as may have become formed into bone, divide the tendon or gristle part into square pieces the size of a cutlet; and place in a stewpan a bed of carrots, onions, turnips, celery, garnished faggot of parsley, six cloves, a few peppercorns, and a little salt; moisten with sufficient stock or water to let them swim; put the lid on and set them to braise very gently on a slow fire for about four hours. When the tendons are done, which will be when the gristle has become almost trans- parent and comparatively soft to the probe of a fork, they must be carefully removed with a small skimmer one by one, and being placed between two china dishes, set in the larder to become partially cold in order that they may be neatly trimmed, then place in a stewpan with their own liquor (previously freed from grease and boiled down to glaze). Make them hot, roll them in their glaze, dish them up in a circular row; garnish the centre with dressed spinach; pour the remainder of their glaze round the base and serve. Tendons of veal may also be served with stewed peas or any other vegetable garnish.

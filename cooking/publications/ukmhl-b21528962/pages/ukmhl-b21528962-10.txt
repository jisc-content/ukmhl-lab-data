INTRODUCTION VI instruct and show their servants the best road to good plain cookery. In days of yore every gentlewoman was supposed to understand enough cookery to instruct her handmaidens, and generally did the pickling and preserving herself. Why should not we follow the good example of our great grandmothers, and revive this good old custom in this Victorian era ? Besides the advantage of it, I know there are now many women of gentle birth who, from unfortunate monetary losses, have to gain their living for themselves, and have taken up the culinary art and are able to obtain a very fair livelihood by going out to cook dinners and ball suppers, and also by giving demonstrative cookery lessons. The silly ignorance of so many gentlewomen is astounding. Let me give an example : I was present at a lecture a short time since at one of the recent cookery exhibitions, where Miss Young was teaching- pastry making, when a lady among the audience asked, “ Must we put our bare hands into the dough ? ” “ Certainly,” replied the teacher; “ you cannot make it otherwise.” “ Oh, then,” remarked the questioner, “ perhaps that is the reason why I failed when I made my last tart; my gloves did seem in the way ! ” I consider this a very good example of the terrible ignorance which prevails regarding the knowledge of the cuisine. Cookery schools and classes, and the innumerable cookery books are, however, doing much to help.

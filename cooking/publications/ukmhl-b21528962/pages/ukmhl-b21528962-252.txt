240 THE HOUSEWIFE’S BEFEREE a Cardinal’s hat in exchange for thirty hogsheads of the wine. This was also the favourite wine of Louis XIV. and Napoleon Bonaparte; it possesses all the soft richness of Pommard and the perfume of Chambertin, without the cloying quality of the one or the lieadiness of the other. For wines such as port and claret, which always require a little warming to enjoy their flavour properly, there is nothing so good as Ritchie’s Patent wine-warmer. It brings claret and port to a temperature for the table without the risk of overheating, every bottle being of the same tempera- ture. It is a tin can with a double lining into which hot water is poured and the bottles are placed in the centre. It is made in different sizes to hold from one bottle to four. Another way of warming these wines is to dip them in hot water for a few seconds after decanting, or wrapping a cloth, wrung out in hot water, round the decanter for a short time. BALL-SUPPER AND GARDEN-PARTY BEVERAGES “ One sip Will bathe the drooping spirit in delight Beyond the bliss of dreams.” I have given only a few recipes here, as there is not space to give an extended number; but in my little volume of “ Drinks a la Mode ” a greater variety will be found. Ananas Bowl.—Slice some pineapple thinly, put it into a punch bowl with alternate layers of sugar, pour over the whole a glass of old brown sherry, cover, and let it stand for twenty-four houi’s; then pour over as many bottles of Rhine wine as will be needed and one bottle of red wine. Cardinal.—Cut three Tangerine oranges in slices • add three drops of essence of cinnamon, three bruised cardamom seeds; and four ounces of barley sugar dissolved in one pint of hot water. Cover and let the mixture simmer for half an hour, strain and clear; add a bottle of champagne, and warm up.

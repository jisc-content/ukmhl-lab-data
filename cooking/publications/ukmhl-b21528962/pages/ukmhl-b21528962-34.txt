22 THE HOUSEWIFE’S EEFEEEE with it. The food cannot burn or boil over ; it requires no watching or stirring, occupies only one space on range or gas stove. The whole dinner may be cooked at once, without in the slightest degree mingling the flavours. Each com- partment is fitted with a steam check-valve, by closing which, any portion of the dinner is prevented from being overcooked, but is kept hot by steam in the pipe and compartment above and below it. There is a whistle which gives warning when water in the boiler is getting low. Another advantage is its most wonderful cheapness. The Rapid Patent Cookery Steamer is a most useful little thing, and is more than worth its price of one shilling. It is a circular piece of metal rising to a cone, and at the top of the cone is a little ball. It can be placed into any saucepan: steam is generated first under the cone, and as the water becomes heated to a temperature of about 150°, it is forced from under the cone, leaving about an inch of water. This steamer boils much more rapidly than that outside the cone, and quickly generates steam, which, confined to the cone, lifts the ball at the top, and a large continuous volume of super-heated steam issues from under the ball, which is hotter and drier than in any other cookery steamers.

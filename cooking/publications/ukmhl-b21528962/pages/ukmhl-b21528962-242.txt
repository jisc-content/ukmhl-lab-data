Chicken Croquettes.—Mince the remains of any cold fowl or game, and add half its weight in minced ham or tongue, and the same of mushrooms. Make a sauce with one ounce of butter, one ounce of flour, with a gill of milk or stock (or half of each), some finely minced parsley, a few pieces of finely grated lemon peel, pepper, salt, and cayenne to taste, with a little grated thyme; stir these together over the fire till smooth, then stir in the chicken and cook over the fire; when cooked, turn it out to get cool, and when jwrfectly cold shape it into balls or cutlets, using flour to prevent the hands sticking, then brush the balls over with beaten egg and roll in fine breadcrumbs, and fry in plenty of friture to a golden brown; drain on blotting paper, and serve very hot garnished with fried parsley.

Grillade of Fowl.—Score deeply the legs of a cold roast fowl and cover with the following sauce :—Two teaspoonfuls of salad oil, one of Chutney, a teaspoonful of Brand’s anchovy paste, a teaspoonful of French mustard, and a dust of cayenne; let the fowl remain covered with this from half an hour to an hour, then grill it over a good, bright, clear fire. Kidneys and Bacon.—Skin the kidneys and cut them a little, but not quite in half; lay them open with a small skewer and place them on a gridiron, the cut side downwards first; turn them whilst cooking several times, and cook at same time,in the frying-pan a slice of bacon, cut thin, for each kidney ; have the dish they are going to be served in quite ready and hot; put a lump of butter in, lay the kidneys on it, remove the skewer, and have ready to place in the middle of each kidney a little butter, with chopped parsley in it, into which squeeze a few drops of lemon; put this inside each kidney, with pepper and salt, and curl a slice of bacon over each. Send to table as hot as possible.

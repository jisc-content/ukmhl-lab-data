vi INTRODUCTION. March and April, it may be fo eafily miftaken for Tench, if the barbs or wattels, under the head, are carefully cut off; and (if the fame art is taken to difguife it; its tine cafe and handfome thape, during the reft of the year, give it fo near a re- femblance to Grayling, that it is very common to impofe it upon the public, for the one, or the other, as the different fealons give the proper op- portunities. The public, therefore, cannot be too much warn’d of the danger attending fuch deceit; and the prudent matron, houfekeeper, or cook, cannot examine with too much care, whether the fkin, under the chaps of fuch fifh as are purchafed -for Tench or Grayling, be perfe&ly whole ; fince, if they are Barbel, there will be four flight wounds under the head or chaps of each fifh, by the barbs or wattels being cut off. For if it is ferved up to the table for Tench, the fpawn may prove fata, to the perfon who eats it; and, at the belt, whether it is dreffed as Tench or Grayling, the free eating of the flesh (if we may be allowed the expref- fion) may be attended with difagreeablc, if not dangerous confequences. It will appear below, that Tench fpawn in July, wc mult, theiefore, re- mark further, that if any.fifh is fold for Tench in March and April, and proves to be full of fpawn, it cannot be Tench, but is a cheat upon the pur- chafer, and mud be Barbel. BLEAK.—The time of its fpawning is very uncertain, and the tiih is very little icgarded at any time. BREAM—fpawns in tire beginning of July, b r is molt: in feafon in June and September. CARP.—This fiih is faid to breed two or three times in a year, but the chief time ot (pawning is in May. It is, indeed, rather a pond, than a river fifh ; and a well led filh is at ail times a de- licate difia. CHUB,

263 FOOD FOR THE SICK. OYSTERS, SWEETBREADS, BIRDS. Many a dainty repast has been spoiled for an invalid by having its consumption “ assisted at ” by several well meaning friends or relatives. Nothing injures the appetite sooner than for the eater to be the centre of observation of even the most kindly eyes. Not that the invalid should be compelled to take his meals alone. There is al- ways some one, mother, wife, or sister, who can be at hand to supply deficiencies and to keep up a lively chat that will brighten rather than fatigue her charge. Above all, let distressing topics be rigorously shunned. A little worry that appears a mere bagatelle to a sound mind in a sound body, swells to mammoth proportions when it is turned over and over in the flagging brain of one shut in with his own thoughts from the outer world. Roast Oysters. Wash the shell oysters and lay them on the top of a stove, or in a shovel placed directly on the coals. The shells will open when the oysters are done. Serve with butter, salt, and pepper, and, if desired, lemon juice, and cut thin bread and but- ter to eat with them. If there is a stove or open fire in the sick room, it is best to roast the oysters there, as by this course they may be served smok- ing hot.

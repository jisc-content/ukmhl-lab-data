The object of this book is, to be so clear and simple and explicit, in directions for cooking, that one cannot help doing the right thing, in the right way, at just the right time, and come out right. A person entirely ignorant of cooking could, it seems to us, go into her kitchen with this book in her hand, and be confident of success in all the simple forms of cooking. It is not possible to speak too strongly in praise of the peculiar method and methods of the book. We can only advise every housekeeper, who has an inexperienced but willing and interested cook, to buy the book at once, put it into the kitchen, and await the result. — “ H. H.” in Denver Tribune,

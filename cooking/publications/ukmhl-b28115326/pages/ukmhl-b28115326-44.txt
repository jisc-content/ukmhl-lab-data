34 LIBERAL LIVING UPON NARROW MEANS. found in the chapter entitled “ For Christinas Week.” Sew up each chicken in a piece of tarla- tan or cheesecloth, binding down legs and wings with twine. Put over the fire in hot water, and boil steadily, but not violently, for nearly an hour, testing the fowls with a fork to ascertain if they are done. When they are about three quarters cooked, take out a cupful of the liquor, strain and season it, and cook in it a cupful of macaroni, broken into inch lengths. Twenty minutes should suffice to stew it tender. Form this into a broad mound upon a platter, and lay the chick- ens, released from their bonds, upon it. Garnish with parsley, and serve with drawn butter. Whij)ped Potato. Boil the potatoes, and beat them hard with a fork until very light, whipping in butter, milk, and salt to taste. Creamed Parsnips. While the parsnips are boiling, prepare in a double boiler a sauce of half a cupful of hot milk, thickened with a tablespoonful of butter rolled in one of flour, and seasoned to taste. When smok- ing hot, lay the cooked parsnips, scraped and sliced, in the sauce for five minutes, turning them two or three times. Serve very hot.

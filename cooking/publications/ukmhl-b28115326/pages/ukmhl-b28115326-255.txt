245 SUMMER DESSERTS. Peach Shortcake. One egg. One cupful sugar. One cup milk. Two cups and a half of flour. Two teaspoonfuls baking powder. A pinch of salt. One tablespoonful butter. One cup sweet cream. Sift the flour and stir into it the sugar, salt, and baking powder, then the milk. Add to these the egg, without beating it, and the butter melted in a little hot water. Beat all well and bake in jelly cake tins. Slice the peaches, crush slightly with the back of a spoon, and place between the layers of cake, sprinkling with powdered sugar. For the top cake have ready the cream, whipped firm, and stud this thickly with sliced peaches. If the cream is not obtainable, the whites of three eggs whisked to a stiff meringue with a little sugar will prove an excellent substitute. Berries may be used instead of peaches, when the latter are not available.

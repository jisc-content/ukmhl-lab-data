OCTOBER. 135 Puree of Turnips. Peel and slice half a dozen large white turnips. Boil them until soft enough to mash, rub them through a colander, and return to the fire. Beat into them a tablespoonful of melted butter, a table- spoonful of cream, and pepper and salt to taste. Serve very hot. Baked Potatoes. See Chapter II. Orange Froth. One box Coxeâ€™s gelatine, soaked two hours in two cups cold water. Six small tart oranges. One cup and a half sugar. Four eggs, the whites only. Peel and squeeze the oranges and put rind, juice, and the sugar and soaked gelatine over the lire in a double boiler. When the two latter are dissolved, strain through a flannel into a dish to grow cool. When almost hard, beat into the jelly the whipped whites of the eggs, and beat until both are a stiff froth. Set to form in a plain mould, and when formed, heap by the spoonful in a glass dish. FRIDAY. * Baked Pickerel. Mashed Potatoes. Scalloped Tomatoes. Apple Pancakes.

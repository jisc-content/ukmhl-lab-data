63 J/AF. Asparagus Rolls. Stale rolls. One large or two small bunches of asparagus. Yolk of one egg. One cup milk. Two teaspoonfuls butter rubbed smooth in one tablespoonful of flour. With a sharp knife cut off the tops of the rolls and scrape out the crumb from the lower halves. Set these shells in the oven long enough to dry without scorching. Boil the asparagus tender, drain off the water, cut off the tops, and chop flne. Heat the milk to boiling, thicken with the butter and flour, pour a little on the beaten yolk and stir that into the milk, season to taste and add the asparagus tops. When heated through, fill the hollowed rolls with the sauce, put on the tops and serve. In spite of the elaborate directions, this is not a difficult dish to prepare, and is excellent early in the season before asparagus has become as cheap and plenty as it is later on. Chocolate Custards. Four cups milk. Four eggs. Four teaspoonfuls cornstarch. One cup sugar. Half cupful grated chocolate. Vanilla to taste. Heat the milk to boiling, and add the sugar.

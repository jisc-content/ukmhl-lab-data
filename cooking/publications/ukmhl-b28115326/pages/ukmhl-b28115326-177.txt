167 FOR CHRISTMAS WEEK. Shrimp Salad. This may be made either of the canned or fresh shrimps. If the latter are used, the shells must be cracked and the meat picked out carefully. In either case they must be cut rather fine with a sharp knife. Heap upon crisp lettuce leaves and pour over them a mayonnaise dressing, made ac- cording to the receipt given above. Oyster Croquettes. One quart small oysters, minced fine. One half pint cream. One large tablespoonful butter rubbed into two teaspoonfuls cornstarch. Pinch of soda added to the cream. Pepper, salt, and lemon juice to taste. Heat the cream and soda to scalding in a double boiler and add the butter and cornstarch. While the sauce cooks, stir constantly. When smooth and thick put in the oysters and seasoning. Ho not leave on the fire more than five minutes. Set the mixture aside to cool, and when perfectly cold and stiff form with floured hands into croquettes. Let these stand in a cool place three or four hours before cooking, that they may be firn;. At the last, dip into raw egg and roll in fine cracker crumbs. Fry in boiling fat, drain dry in a colan- der, and serve laid on a napkin.

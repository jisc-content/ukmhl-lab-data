Pour in the milk, and make the top stratum of cheese thicker than the previous ones. Bake covered half an hour, and then brown. Stewed Oyster Plant, or Salsify. Scrape the roots and cut them into inch lengths, dropping them into cold water to prevent discol- oration.

Salt and pepper to taste. Ginger Snaps. Four large cups flour. One cup lard.

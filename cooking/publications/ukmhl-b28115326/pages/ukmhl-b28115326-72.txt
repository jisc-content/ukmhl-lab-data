62 LIBERAL LIVING UPON NARROW MEANS. Boiled Leg of Mutton. Sew the meat up snugly in a piece of coarse cheesecloth, and put it in a pot nearly full of boil- ing water, slightly salted. It should cook about fifteen minutes to the pound. When done, re- move the cheesecloth, lay the mutton on a hot platter, rub it with butter, sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper and serve. Set aside the liquor in which the mutton was boiled, for next dayâ€™s soup. Caper Sauce. About ten minutes before removing the meat from the pot, take out a cupful of the liquor and cool it by setting it in cold water or on the ice. Skim off the fat that rises to the top, and strain the liquor into a saucepan. Bring it to a boil and thicken it with a small tablespoonful of but- ter rubbed in the same quantity of flour. Season to taste and pour upon a beaten egg, little by lit- tle. Eeturn to the stove for a minute and add a handful of capers. Pour into a gravy boat, and serve with the mutton. Creamed Potatoes. Mash the potatoes, in the usual way, but add nearly twice as much milk as usual, and beat in the whipped white of an egg. Mound in a pie plate and set in the open oven for five minutes before serving.

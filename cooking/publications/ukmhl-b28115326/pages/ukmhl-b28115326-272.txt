262 LIBERAL LIVING UPON NARROW MEANS. Mutton or Lamb Chops May be prepared in tlie same manner. Be care- ful to remove all superfluous fat before cooking. A pleasant accompaniment to a chop is a single baked tomato. Cut off the top, and without break- ing the skin, remove the pulp from the inside : mix this with fine bread crumbs, pepper, salt, but- ter, and a very little sugar; return to the tomato shell, cover and bake to a light brown. Broiled Venison. Cook on a well-buttered gridiron, turning often, for about fifteen minutes ; lay in a hot dish, pep- per and salt lightly, and butter generously. Al- low a liberal teaspoonful of currant jelly to a small steak, and let it stand covered until the melted butter and jelly have soaked thoroughly into the meat. Serve very hot. Warming Over. When practicable, it is best to cook chicken, steak, etc., just as it is needed, but when, as some- times happens, a dainty bit is left over, there is no reason why it should not be warmed up, and yet be appetizing. Instead of heating the meat in the oven, thus drying it out and making it tasteless, the cold remnant should be placed in a closely covered saucer or tin pan, and this set over a kettle of boiling water. The steam warms the meat and also preserves the juices.

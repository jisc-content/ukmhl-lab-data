CUEAP MUTTON AND BEEF. 173 bers of tables where it is never seen. The distaste once established is not readily shaken off, and thus one of the most wholesome, and, if properly prepared, most appetizing articles of diet is pro- scribed. The chief cause, however, for the lack of taste for mutton arises from the fact that it is seldom prepared properly or served smoking hot. A leg of mutton or lamb may be good cold, but a chop, a stew, or a mince is detestable when served in a pool of congealed gravy. Few things possess more disagreeably adhesive qualities than cold mutton fat, and the person who has once known the sensation of having tongue and teeth coated with it is not desirous to repeat the ex- perience. A chafing dish is almost an essential for preparations of mutton. Well seasoned, properly cooked, and served hot, they offer in themselves the strongest argument in their own favor that can be desired. The concoction of these, as of all made dishes, requires care and judgment; but when these are duly given, the results are suffi- ciently savory to afford recompense for the pains. Mutton Cutlets au Fromage. Two pounds of cutlets taken from near the neck and cut not more than half an inch thick. Two eggs beaten light. Half a cup very fine bread crumbs. Half a cup grated cheese.

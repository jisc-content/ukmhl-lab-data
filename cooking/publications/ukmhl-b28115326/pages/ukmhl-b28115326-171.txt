161 FOR CHRISTMAS WEEK. Mashed Potato. Prepare according to directions given in Chap- ter I. Baked Sweet Potatoes. Wash clean, wipe, and bake in their jackets. Serve wrapped in a napkin. Cauliflower. Pull off the outer leaves and cut the stalk off close. Tie up the cauliflower in a piece of mos- quito net or thin cheese cloth, put into twice as much salted boiling water as will cover it, drop in a piece of charcoal to absorb the odor, and boil fast until tender. Another excellent precaution against the cabbage smell that accompanies this delicious vegetable is that of placing a small tin of boiling vinegar upon the stove at the same time. One odor seems to neutralize the other. Cook the cauliflower uncovered. When done, remove the netting, lay in a deep dish, and pour over it a sauce made of one good tablespoonful of butter rolled in two teaspoonfuls of flour and stirred into a cup of boiling milk. Cook in a double boiler until it thickens, and add a little finely shredded parsley. Celery. Wash and separate, laying aside the outer stalks and reserving only the blanched ones for present use. The others are very nice stewed or in soup, but are out of place for eating aii naturel.

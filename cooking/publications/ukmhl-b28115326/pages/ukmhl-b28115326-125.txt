115 SEPTEMBER. MONDAY. Curried Lamb. Boiled Rice. Bananas. Roast Green Corn. Peaches and Cream. Curried Lamb. Cut the remnants of yesterdayâ€™s lamb into thin slices or small neat pieces. Make a gravy of the bones, skimming the fat from this after it has cooled. Warm it again and add to it two teaspoon- fuls of curry powder. Drop into this the pieces of lamb, and let all simmer about ten minutes before serving. Boiled Rice. Wash the rice carefully, picking out discolored kernels or specks. Put two cupfuls of the rice over the fire in three pints of boiling water and boil hard for fifteen minutes, setting the sauce- pan over the hottest of the fire and giving it an occasional shake. Test the condition of the rice by pinching a grain of it between the thumb and finger. When it is soft, drain off the water and set the saucepan to the side of the stove, where the rice will dry without scorching. At the table, serve the rice first, and heap the curry upon it and around it in genuine East India fashion, Bananas. Keep them on the ice until the last moment, and pass them with the rice and curry.

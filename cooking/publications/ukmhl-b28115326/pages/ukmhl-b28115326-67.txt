57 APRIL. Butter a dozen small patty pans. They should be rather deep, and, if possible, have straight sides. Cut the rounds of toast to fit these, and lay one in the bottom of each, buttering them lightly and moistening each with a tablespoonful of oyster liquor. Place on the toast as many oysters as the pan will hold readily, dot with bits of butter, sprinkle with pepper and salt, and add a little oyster liquor. Set in a steady oven for from five to ten minutes, until the oysters “ crimp.” Eat from the pans. Small china “ nappies ” may be used instead of pans. Baked Omelet. Five eggs. Half cup milk. Half teaspoonful cornstarch. Pepper and salt to taste. Beat the whites and yolks of the eggs sepa- rately and very stiff; stir lightly together, add the milk and cornstarch, the pepper and salt, and bake in a buttered pudding dish ten minutes, or until firm. Eat quickly, as it soon falls. Stuffed Potatoes. Prepare as directed in Chapter II. Tapioca Pudding. One small cup tapioca. Three eggs. One cup sugar.

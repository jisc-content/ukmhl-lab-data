THE TEA TABLE. 201 with a cloth made for the purpose. This may be bought fringed, and ready for any additions in the way of needlework that taste or ingenuity may devise. One pretty design is the old couplet: — “Except the kettle boiling be, Filling the teapot spoils the tea.” The pictures of the kettle and teapot are given instead of the written words, while the same plan is followed by placing the capital initials B and T instead of the “be” and “tea” terminating the lines. These may be done in outline in wash silks. The cosy or thickly wadded cap to cover the teapot is another important appurtenance, and may be made rich or simple as desired. It should be cut of a size to lit the pot for which it is in- tended, and of any suitable material, ladies cloth, turcoman, felt, sateen, or even silk or satin. It is prettiest in a plain color, not too bright, and of a serviceable goods, and may be braided, quilted, embroidered, or painted, and the edges finished with a cord. French wool wadding is better for stuffing than cotton batting, as being both warmer and lighter. Individual taste may be consulted in the design worked upon the cosy, but two or three suggestions may not come amiss. A minia- ture tea tray, a tiny teapot and creamer, a cup and saucer, a spray of flowers (presumably blos- soms of the tea plant), or any other appropriate pattern, and for mottoes, “ The cup that cheers,”

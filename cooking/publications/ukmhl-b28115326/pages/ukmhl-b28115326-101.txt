JULY. 91 Beef Soup ivith Macaroni. Kemove the fat from the stock in which the beef was boiled and strain it into the soup pot. Break a cupful of macaroni into pieces about an inch long, and cook them tender in boiling water. Drain and add to the soup when it is scalding hot, let them boil together fifteen minutes, and serve. Liver and Ham. One pound calfâ€™s liver. Half pound ham. Half cup gravy from your soup stock. One cup fine bread crumbs. Two eggs, well beaten. Minced onion and parsley. Pepper and salt at discretion. Boil the liver and chop it fine. If you have no cold ham in the house, buy a slice, boil it and chop it also. Mix with the liver and add the soup stock. Stir in the seasoning, eggs, and crumbs. Grease a Boston brown bread mould or a small tin pail with a closely fitting top, put the mixture into this, fit on the lid, and set in a vessel of boil- ing water, taking care that the water does not come to the top of the mould. Boil two hours, turn out, and pour a cupful of good drawn butter over it. Moulded Mashed Potato.

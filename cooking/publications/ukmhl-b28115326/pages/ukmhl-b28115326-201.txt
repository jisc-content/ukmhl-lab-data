THE SEAMY SIDE OF SUMMER. 191 Fielded Cherries. Four quarts cherries. Garden Ked ” or some other tart variety is the best. One quart good cider vinegar. One cupful white sugar. Two dozen whole cloves. Twelve blades of mace. Heat vinegar and spices together and boil ten minutes. Pack Mason’s pint jars three quarters full of the cherries, and fill up with the strained vinegar when it has been allowed to become per- fectly cold. Screw the tops on tightly and keep in a dark place. They will be eatable within forty-eight hours, but mellow and improve with keeping. Pickled Peaches (impeeled). Eight pounds rather small, firm peaches. Three pounds white sugar. One quart vinegar. Three teaspoonfuls cinnamon and the same mace and allspice. As many whole cloves as there are peaches. Wipe off the peaches and stick a clove in each. Heat spices, sugar, and vinegar to the boiling point, drop in the peaches, and boil ten minutes. Take out the peaches with a perforated skimmer, strain the syrup, return it to the fire, and boil it down to a tliick syrup. Put the peaches into jars, pour the boiling syrup over them, and seal while hot.

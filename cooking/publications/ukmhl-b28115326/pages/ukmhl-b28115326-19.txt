Boil for an hour, drain dry in a colan- der, and mash and beat smooth in a wooden bowl. Heat again, stirring in a lump of butter the size of an egg, and quarter of a cupful of milk. Sea- son to taste and serve very hot. Crackers and Cheese. Clear the table as though for dessert; have the crackers heated in the oven, and eat with the cheese.

A cup of coffee or tea is a pleasant addition. WEDNESDAY. Mutton Stew with Dumplings. Potato Cones. Scalloped Squash. Baked Sweet Potatoes. Cottage Pudding. Glutton Stew with Bumjplings.

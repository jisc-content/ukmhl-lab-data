THE SEAMY SIDE OF SUMMER. 189 clients. It is delightful as the filling for sponge cake custard or trifle, and makes a pleasant accom- paniment to ice cream or blanc-mange. The economical manager will find it far cheaper to make jellies than to buy them. If those sold in stores are of really first-class quality, both as regards materials and making, they are usually beyond the limits of the average purse, except in small quantities. On the other hand, the recent investigations into the composition of cheap jellies reveal adulterations that make it dangerous to par- take of them. More than one case of severe ill- ness has been caused, especially among the poorer classes, by the eating of the jellies sold at low prices. Analysis shows that the ingredients are of the cheapest and coarsest character, often, in- deed, consisting of spoiled fruit, which has been utilized for jellies, the taste of the decayed mat- ter being masked by strong acids and flavorings. Jellies make a pretty side dish or garnish for meat dishes, and some kinds, notably currant, are almost essentials in the preparation of game and savory dishes. The old custom of boiling the jelly after the sugar has been added is almost discarded at present, as it has been conclusively proved that this course not only involves addi- tional labor without rendering the jelly any firmer, but positively impairs the flavor and color. A few of the old fashioned cooks may still cling to this obsolete custom, but its observance is rap- idly growing to be the exception rather than the rule.

54 LIBERAL LIVING UPON NARROW MEANS. Potato Croquettes. Boil and mash your potatoes early in the day, unless you have cold mashed potato already in the house. Into two cupfuls beat a lump of but- ter the size of a walnut, one raw egg, and pep- per and salt to taste. Form the mixture into croquettes, rolling them lightly between the hands to acquire the proper shape, and flattening them at the ends. Boll them in flour and set aside in a cold place to stiffen. Fry in boiling dripping or lard, drain in a colander and serve upon a nap- kin in a hot dish. Rice Custard Pudding. Two cups rice, boiled as before directed. Three cups milk. Two eggs. One tablespoonful butter. Pinch of salt. Half tablespoonful cinnamon. Beat the eggs light, and add them to the butter and sugar, rubbed to a cream.

DAINTY DISHES FOR TEA. 209 heavy. This omelet will require longer for cook- ing than one made without meat. Instead of the ham, finely chopped chicken or veal may be used, but these must be highly seasoned with pepper, salt, and sweet herbs. Potato Puff with Cheese. Two cupfuls cold mashed potato. One egg. One half cupful milk. One teaspoonful melted butter. Two tablespoonfuls grated cheese. Salt and pepper. Beat the potato, milk, and butter together until light, and add the whipped egg. Pour into a greased pudding dish, strew the cheese thickly over the top, and bake in a good oven until brown. Fifteen minutes should be sufficient. English Muffins. One cupful bread dough which has been rising all night. One cupful sweet milk, or enough to make a batter a little stiffer than that for griddle cakes. Let the batter rise an hour, and then bake on a well greased griddle, allowing a good table- spoonful of the mixture for each muffin. They must be at least half an inch thick, and may be served warm, if desired. They are better, how- ever, if they are left until cold, then split open, toasted lightly on the inside, and eaten hot with butter.

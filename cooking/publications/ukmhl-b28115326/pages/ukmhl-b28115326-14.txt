Drain dry and beat with a fork until light and creamy, then whip in a good tablespoonful of butter, and enough hot milk to soften the mixture to the desired con- sistency. The housekeeper will do well to use the small potatoes for such purposes as this, keep- ing the large ones for roasting and boiling whole. It is also a good plan to prepare a generous sup- ply of mashed potatoes, as they can be utilized in many forms. Cold Slaw with Egg Dressing. Cut the heart of a white cabbage fine with a sharp knife, and just before sending to table pour over it the following dressing : â€” Yolks of two eggs. Two tablespoonfuls oil. Pour tablespoonfuls vinegar. One teaspoon fill salt. One teaspoonful sugar. One saltspoonful each pepper and mustard. Whip the oil by degrees into the yolks of the eggs until the mixture is thick and smooth. Add the seasoning and the vinegar, beating all to- gether thoroughly. Both the dressing and the cabbage may be prepared on Saturday, and will keep perfectly in a cold place.

It is the purpose of this work to present opinions of European and American authorities upon the conduct of the Game of Whist; to give the history of French, English, and American leads and inventions; to show in what respect the practice in play of former times has been superseded by that of the present; and to apply the instructions of the best writers and players, from Folkestone to Trist, to the proper development of either method of play in vogue at any of the clubs in the country.

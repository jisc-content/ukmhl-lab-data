Drain the liquor from the oys- ters and cut them with a sharp knife into small pieces. Cut the celery into half inch lengths. Chopping bruises it. Put oysters and celery into a salad dish, mix with it half of the dressing, and pour the rest over it. Garnish with celery tops and stoned olives. Mayonnaise Dressing. For a large party, provide at the rate of one egg to every four persons. Free the yolks carefully from the whites, and set the latter aside to be used in meringue, icing, or ice-cream. Beat the oil into the yolks, in the proportion of six table- spoonfuls to each yolk, putting in at first only a drop or two at a time.

Cut the celery into half inch lengths, moisten with a little vinegar, and pour over it mayonnaise dressing. Serve immediately, as it withers soon in the vinegar. Canned Chicken Salad. When fowls are expensive, really good chicken salad may be made from the canned chicken or turkey that comes at fifty cents a box. Cut the chicken into small pieces with a knife. Never chop it. Mix with this an equal quantity of cut celery. Moisten with vinegar, season with pep- per and salt, and stir into it a dozen olives, stoned and minced fine.

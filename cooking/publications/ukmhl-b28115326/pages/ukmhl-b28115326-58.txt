48 LIBERAL LIVING UPON NARROW MEANS. Boiled Fresh Tongue. Order a beefâ€™s tongue from the butcher. A tongue generally weighs from four to six pounds and has very little waste, as it contains only a small amount of bone. It is sometimes necessary to bespeak one several days ahead, as there is not much call for them. Soak it over night in slightly salted water, wipe dry and trim off a lit- tle. Plunge into boiling water and cook steadily but slowly for an hour and a half, or until tender. This sometimes requires two or three hours. Take from the pot, rub with a raw egg, beaten, and cover thickly with fine bread crumbs. Bake in a good oven half an hour, basting it from time to time with hot water and butter. While it is baking, the sauce may be prepared. Sauce. Take a cupful of the liquor in which the tongue was boiled, heat it to scalding and skim. Thicken it with a tablespoonful of butter rubbed into a tablespoonful of browned flour. Pepper and salt to taste, add a little, chopped parsley and a couple of gherkin pickles, minced very fine. If the flavor is not disagreeable, substitute for one of the gherkins a pickled onion, minced. Boil up, pour part of the sauce over the tongue as it lies in the dish and send the rest to table in a sauce boat. The remaining liquor from the tongue will make excellent soup stock.

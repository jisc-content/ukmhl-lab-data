APRIL. 5a Bean Soujj. Soak one cup of beans over night in cold water. In the morning put them on the stove with a quart and a pint of cold water, and boil steadily until they are soft, adding more water from time to time, so that the quantity of liquid may re- main the same. Put through a colander when the beans are tender and return to the pot. Thin with milk or soup stock to the required consis- tency and thicken with two teaspoonfuls of butter rubbed smooth in a tablespoonful of flour and then cooked together. Season to taste and pour on small squares of fried bread laid in the bot- tom of the tureen. If you have half a cupful of tomatoes left, they may be rubbed through a colander and added to the soup. Stewed Chops and Peas. Lay your chops in a shallow saucepan and poiir over them enough cold water to cover them. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and add half a small onion sliced. Stew gently until tender. When they can easily be pierced with a fork, re- move them to a hot dish. Have ready a can of green peas from which the liquor has been drained some time before. Cook these ten minutes in the gravy from which the chops have been withdrawn and pour them over the meat in the dish. This will be found an appetizing way of cooking tough or ill-cut chops.

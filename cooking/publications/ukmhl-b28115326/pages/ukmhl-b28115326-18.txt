8 LIBERAL LIVING UPON NARROW MEANS. Peel and slice the potatoes, and boil ten min- utes. Drain off the water and return the sauce- pan to the fire with the two quarts of cold water, onion, herbs, and celery. Boil for an hour, then rub through the colander, and return the strained contents of the soup pot to the fire. Bring to a boil, and stir in the butter, rubbed smooth with the flour. Season and pour into the tureen ; after this is done add the cup of milk, which should have been heated in a separate vessel. Mix well. This is a palatable and nourishing soup. Soups are to be especially recommended as much more wholesome than pastry and rich puddings, and costing less trouble. Let them supersede des- serts occasionally, and place the extra course at the beginning of the meal instead of at the end. Boiled Ham. Get a corned ham in preference to a smoked one, as the latter are less digestible than the former. Soak over night, and put on to boil early in the morning in cold water. Cook stead- ily, but not too fast, allowing fifteen minutes to the pound. Skin, sprinkle over thickly with cracker crumbs, dot with “ dabs ” of pepper, and garnish with parsley. Mashed Potatoes. Prepare as directed on Sunday, cooking enough to leave a supply for next day’s dinner.

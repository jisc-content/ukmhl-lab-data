Home Gymnastics, for the Well and the Sick, Adapted to all Ages and both Sexes ; with Directions how to Preserve and Increase Health ; also how to Overcome Conditions of 111 Health, by Simple Move- ments of the Body. Edited by E. Angerstein, M. D., Staff Physician and Superintendent of the Gymna- siums of the City of Berlin, and by G. Eckler, Head Teacher of the Royal Institution for Training Teach- ers of Gymnastics. With many Wood-Cuts and a Figure Plate. Translated from the Eighth German Edition. 8vo, $1.50. The book has the thorough approval of physicians in general, and merits the widest distribution, especially among persons of sedentary occupation, who lack either the time or the inclination to counteract the evil effects of such a life by joining classes or associations for gymnastics. Careful parents will also value the exercises defined for girls; they are particularly well adapted for establishing in children a good and erect carriage, and suppressing in their first stages in- cipient or threatened deformities. . . . The authors also deserve special credit for having confined themselves to such forms of ex- ercise as are most important and most efficacious. They have never lost sight of their purpose to render the proper use of their book independent of all teaching, and consequently everybody can understand it. â€” National Zeitung.

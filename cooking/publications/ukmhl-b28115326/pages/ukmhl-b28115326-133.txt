SEPTEMBER. 123 Calf’s Head. Order a calf s lieM from your butcher, directing him to scald it and clean it thoroughly without removing the skin. Take out the tongue and brains, boil the former and parboil the latter. The tongue will make a nice relish for tea, served cold, or cut into dice and stewed in a little stock will make a savory breakfast stew. The brains must be put away to cool before serving them with the beans. To empty the head, it must have been split in two by your butcher. Tie the two sides together with a cord, put it into a pot and cover it with cold water. Salt slightly and stew slowly for two hours. Remove from the water, wipe off the head, rub it all over with beaten egg, and coat with crushed cracker crumbs, seasoned with pepper and salt. Set in the oven, and after ten minutes baste with a cupful of the liquor in which it was cooked. Bake twenty min- utes longer, basting twice in that time. Thicken the gravy in the pan with browned flour, add a little chopped pickle and a couple of teaspoonfuls of good catsup or Worcestershire sauce. Pour around the calf’s head as it lies in the dish. It is an excellent plan to have the butcher re- move the teeth from the calf’s head, or to do this yourself after it is boiled and before putting it in the oven. String Beans Garnished with Brains. Prepare the string beans as directed in Chapter

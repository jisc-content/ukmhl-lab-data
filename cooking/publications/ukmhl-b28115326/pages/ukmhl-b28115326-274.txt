264 LIBERAL LIVING UPON NARROW MEANS. Milk Stew of Oijsters. Heat the liquor from half a pint of oysters, season, and when boiling hot put the oysters in it. Cook three minutes, add two teaspoonfuls of butter, and half a cup of hot milk. Take at once from the fire. Oysters prepared in this manner will be found juicier and of finer flavor than those which have been suffered to stew longer. Broiled Oysters. Select larger oysters than those used for stew- ing. Wipe them dry and broil quickly upon a buttered gridiron over a hot fire. Butter lightly before serving. They are also good if rolled in fine cracker crumbs before cooking. Pan Boast of Oysters. Lay a thin slice of buttered toast, moistened with oyster liquor, in the bottom of a rather deep patty pan with smooth sides. Place on the toast as many oysters as the pan will conveniently hold, butter, pepper, and salt, and roast, covered, in the oven until the oysters ruffle. Roast Sweetbread. Parboil a fine, large sweetbread and let it lie in cold water for ten minutes. Wipe dry and roast, covered, in a dripping pan, basting frequently with butter. Serve hot.

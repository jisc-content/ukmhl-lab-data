lo8 LIBERAL LIVING UPON NARROW MEANS. Two pounds round steak, cut into pieces as for stewing. Pepper, salt, and catsup to taste. Free the suet from strings and rub it to powder. Chop it into the flour, add a pinch of salt, and work with the water into a paste just stiff enough to be handled. Line a round, plain bowl with this, first buttering the inside of the vessel. The paste should not be over an inch thick. Fill with the cut meat, sprinkling each layer with pepper and salt and dashes of catsup. Cover the top with a piece of pastry cut to fit it, pinching the edges of the pastry, lining and covering, closely together. Tie over all a good sized pudding cloth, floured liberally on the inside, and fastened se- curely, but not so tightly as to hinder the pastryâ€™s swelling. Set the mould in a pot with enough boiling water to cover it well. Boil hard two hours, taking care that the water is filled up as fast as it boils away. When it is done, plunge it upside down for a second in cold water, untie the cloth, slip a dish carefully under the inverted mould and turn the pudding out upon it. Scalloped Potatoes. Into three cups of hot mashed potatoes, beat half a cup of milk, two tablespoonfuls of butter, one raw egg, and pepper and salt to taste. Fill a baking dish with this, sprinkle bread crumbs over the top, bake covered twenty minutes, uncover and brown.

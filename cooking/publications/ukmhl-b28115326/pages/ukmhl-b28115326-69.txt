APRIL. 59 Mashed Potato. Prepare as directed in Chapter I. Stewed Carrots. Scrape, and boil three quarters of an hour. Take from the fire and slice. Keturn to the saucepan with a cupful of weak gravy, — you can filch a little from your stew, — and simmer twenty minutes. Add two tablespoonfuls of milk and a teaspoonful of butter rubbed into two of flour. Pepper and salt to taste. Croutons. Cut stale bread into slices not more than a quarter of an inch thick, and quarter these slices. Dry in an open oven until the triangles are a deli- cate brown. Spread with a paste made of equal parts of butter and grated cheese, and set in the oven again until they are dry on top. They are a good relish. Salted Almonds. Shell and blanch almonds. When perfectly dry, spread in a dripping pan and stir with a tablespoonful of melted butter. Set in the oven until they brown, stirring often to prevent scorch- ing. They should be lightly browned. Take them out and sprinkle thickly with salt, tossing them about in it, so that all have a generous sea- soning. Eat with the croutons.

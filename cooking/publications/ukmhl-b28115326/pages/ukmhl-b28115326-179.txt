FOR CHRISTMAS WEEK. 169 Whites of two eggs. Juice and grated rind of a lemon. Beat the whites and sugar together, and very- light. Spread on each layer, and place over it the banana, cut in thin slices, the pieces joining each other closely. Sprinkle each layer with the lemon juice and a little of the grated peel. Ice the top of the cake. Cocoanut Cake. This may be made in the same manner as the banana cake, only omitting the lemon juice alto- gether and substituting grated cocoanut for the sliced banana. Ice Cream. In these days of many confectioners, it is often easier and cheaper in the city to buy ice cream than to make it. In country towns, however, or in families who have plenty of milk and ice at their disposal, this is not the case. The inexperi- enced are apt to shrink in dread from such an un- dertaking, but it really involves very little more labor than the preparation of elaborate jellies, and is certainly less trouble than the making of really good [)ies. A freezer is necessary, of course, and there are many patents on the market from which one can choose. If a good one is selected, the work of freezing will not be heavy, provided the ice is broken sufficiently fine and the rock salt is used freely.

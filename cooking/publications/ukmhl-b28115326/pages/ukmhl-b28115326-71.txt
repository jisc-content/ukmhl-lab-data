61 MAY. whatever color is desired come from the china or flowers. An exception to this rule may be made in favor of carving cloths. They are often em- broidered in boiled silk in two shades, with such designs as a carving knife and fork, crossed, a steaming soup tureen, a smoking joint of meat, an elaborately decorated platter, and similar fan- cies. Less pronounced but quite as pretty are those wuth the initials or monogram of the hostess ■worked in one corner. The regular carving cloths can be purchased ready made at most dry-goods shops, or they may be manufactured at home from stout “ butcher’s linen.” They should be nearly square, though a little longer than they are broad, are usually hemmed or fringed (the hem is preferable) and adorned with a border of drawn work or hem- stitching. When the housewife cannot spare time for such needlework, she may use instead a large wdiite napkin, laying it at the carver’s place under the dish containing the meat he is to serve. The cloth thus catches the splashes of gravy and scraps, which even the most skillful carver some- times scatters. When the meat is carried off at the end of the coarse and the table brushed, the carving napkin is removed and the tablecloth is found free of spots. SUNDAY. Boiled Leg of Mutton, Caper Sauce.

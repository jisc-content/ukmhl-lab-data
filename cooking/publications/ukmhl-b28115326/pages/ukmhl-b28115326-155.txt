145 NOVEMBER. See Chapter I. MONDAY. Veal Pate. Baked Potatoes. Scalloped Tomatoes. Fruit. Veal Pate. One small cupful rice. One egg. Half cupful milk. Kemains of cold veal, chopped. Gravy left from yesterday. Boil the rice in plenty of water at breakfast time, and when cold, work to a stiff paste with the milk and the beaten egg. With this line a well greased brown bread mould, or if this is not available, a small tin pail, and fill the centre with the chopped meat moistened with gravy and well seasoned. The stuffing will make a pleasant ad- dition. Spread more of the rice on the top, fasten on a tight cover, and boil hard for an hour and a half. Turn out and pour the remains of your sauce or gravy about the base of the pate. A good gravy may be made out of the bones from which the veal has been cut. These may cook at the side of the stove, as may the pot containing the mould, without interfering with the boiler. Baked Potatoes. See Chapter II. Scalloped Tornadoes.

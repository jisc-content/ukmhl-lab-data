98 LIBERAL LIVING UPON NARROW MEANS. Veal Chops. Trim off superfluous fat and gristle, and broil over a clear fire. Place on a hot dish; pepper, salt, and butter each one, and sprinkle with minced parsley. Boiled Potatoes. See Chapter III. Scalloped Tomatoes (afresh). Prepare as in recipe given for scalloping canned tomatoes (see Chapter I.), only cutting the raw tomatoes into slices instead of using those already stewed. This will take a little longer to cook. Currant Pie. Pick the currants from the stems, rejecting all that are soft. Fill a pastry lined pie dish with the fruit, sweetening it very plentifully. Cut more pastry into strips, and lay them in a lattice work across the top. Bake in a moderate oven, and sprinkle with powdered sugar before sending to table.

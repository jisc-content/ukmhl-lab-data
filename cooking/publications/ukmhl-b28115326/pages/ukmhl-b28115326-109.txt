CHAPTER VIII. AUGUST. “ Keep cool,” is an excellent motto in theory and practice for August weather. The most fer- vid and trying heats of the summer may be expected during this month, and the endeavor should be to make them as tolerable as possible. Especial care in this direction is required in the larder and dining-room. At no other time of year are the flies as troublesome. They swarm about eatables and seem constantly on the alert for mis- chief. It is not safe to have meat exposed for even a moment. When on the table it should be kept covered with a napkin except while it is being carved, and a thick cloth should be laid over it before it is carried from the dining-room. Great watchfulness is also demanded with un- cooked meats, not only to protect them from flies, but also to prevent their spoiling. If they are put upon the ice at all, they must be kept there altogether, and only taken from the refrigerator or ice-house to be put into the oven. Vegetables and fruit should be kept in a cool place until needed, not left in a sultry kitchen to wither into insipidity.

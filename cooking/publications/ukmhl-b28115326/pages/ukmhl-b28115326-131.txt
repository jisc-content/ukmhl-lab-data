Cook a cupful of rice in the or- dinary manner until it is nearly done, then drain off the water, and add milk. Spread this on a flat dish, sprinkle it plentifully with powdered sugar, and lay the pears on it, pouring the syrup over all. Set on the ice until very cold. FRIDAY. Boiled Blueflsh. Mashed Potatoes. Cauliflower au Gratin. Apple Dumplings. Boiled Bluefish. Secure the flsh neatly in a piece of cheesecloth. Have ready in a pot broad enough to hold the flsh without breaking, three tablespoonfuls of vinegar, half a small onion, chopped, and a blade of mace. Lay the fish in this, and add enough boiling water to cover it. Let this stand at the side of the stove half an hour; then bring to a boil, and cook for half an hour longer. Take out the fish, remove the cloth, and serve in a chafing dish, with a cup- ful of draâ€™^vn butter into which has been squeezed the juice of a lemon. Mashed Potato. See Chapter I.

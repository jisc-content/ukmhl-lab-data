190 LIBERAL LIVING UPON NARROW MEANS.' While jellies are almost invariably formed in glasses, other sweets are frequently put up in glass jars. There are few families so large that they require a quart of any sort of preserve or marmalade at a single meal. The pint jars or even the tumblers will be found better for mar- malades, preserves, conserves, or pickles. Canned fruits are eaten of less sparingly, and these may be put up in quart cans if desired. A difficulty common to nearly all housekeepers in summer is that of finding some little relish for supper. Cheese dishes are appetizing, but are seldom good cold. Common sense in dietetics forbids too frequent use of meat in hot weather. Fresh fish cannot always be found. Salads are delicious, and the materials for these can readily be secured by slight forethought. Nearly any of the potted meats sold by first-class grocers furnish an excellent basis for salad. These, however, are apt to be expensive when they are really excellent, and home made substitutes are less costly and quite as good, if well seasoned. Odds and ends can thus be utilized, and oysters, clams, etc., pickled to be used at times when they cannot be obtained in their natural state. Potted and pickled halibut and salmon are always favorite dishes, and those who consider fresh salmon higher priced than they can afford will find that when that which may be bought in cans is carefully pickled, even an epicure would find difficulty in discerning any inferiority in its flavor to that put up when the king of fish has just left his river home.

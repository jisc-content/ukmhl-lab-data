In pursuance of this, she too often falls into the error of endeavor- ing to procure such viands as she imagines they would have in the city, not reflecting ihat to them a greater treat would be a complete change. She purchases, at a high figure, sea fish, that are brought to her after being carted over miles of hot, dusty, country roads, while she leaves un- touched treasures of lake and stream almost at her door. She buys tough steak and roasts, stringy veal and bony mutton six daj'S in the week, and provides poultry so seldom that its ap- pearance is marked as a red-letter day in her guests’ calendar. She outdoes herself in the num- ber and variety of canned goods she places on her table, while her boarders are rarely treated to fresh vegetables, berries, or fruit. She spends strength and money upon elaborate assortments of cake, and omits to furnish the fresh eggs, milk and cream, which are craved by the visitors from town, to whom they would be a delicious rarity. Nine times out of ten the hostess commits these errors through sheer ignorance. Although she may not go as far as did one landlady, who wrote to a city friend begging for directions for cooking “ fashionable ” dishes, yet the desire — a very nat- ural one — is the same with all, to prepare suit- able and acceptable fare for their guests. It is a jjity that so much energy and good will should ever be misdirected. Employed in the right quar- ter, it might produce the happiest results.

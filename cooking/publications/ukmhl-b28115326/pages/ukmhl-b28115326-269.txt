CHAPTER XXI. FOOD FOR THE SICK {continued). CHICKEN, STEAK, AND CHOPS. The embargo on animal food removed by the convalescence of the patient, much of the diffi- culty in providing a pleasing variety vanishes. Still, certain restrictions remain. All fried food must be most carefully avoided. The oft-repeated story of St. Lawrence having attained sanctity by a gridiron, and that in so doing he conferred upon that implement the power of making better every- thing prepared upon it, by no means applies to the frying-pan. It is labor enough for the vigor- ous stomach of a person of active habits to digest fried food, but the task becomes almost an impos- sibility to the delicate gastric organs of one who is just recovering from illness, and is unable to indulge in any but the slightest exercise. Let the convalescentâ€™s food, then, be prepared by stewing roasting, or broiling; these afford a sufficiently wide scope for the most exacting palate. As a beverage for the invalid when no longer bound to a milk diet, cocoa is pleasant and nourishing.

36 LIBERAL LIVING UPON NARROW MEAN8. Chicken Soup. Break up the carcasses of yesterday’s chickens, having first carefully removed every particle of meat from the bones. Put them over the fire with the fragments of skin and gristle, a little parsley and a chopped onion. Cover them with cold water and simmer gently until this is re- duced one half. Add to it the liquor in which the chickens were boiled the day before, skim, strain, and return to the pot. Add one cup of hot milk, pepjjer and salt to taste, and five min- utes before taking from the range stir in Cereal- ine Flakes, in the proportion of one cupful of the flakes to each quart of the soup. Boil up once and serve. Chicken Shortcake. Two cupfuls flour. One cupful milk. Half cupful butter. Two teaspoonfuls baking powder. Eub the baking powder and the butter into the flour. Stir in the milk and make a soft dough, just stiff enough to roll out very thin. Bake in round jelly cake tins, in a quick oven. Have ready the bits of chicken left from yesterday’s dinner, minced fine with a sharp knife and warmed in a little gravy. Spread this between and on top of the short-cakes, and serve with gravy or drawn butter. French Beans with Sausages. Turn the liquor off from canned French string

3 JANUARY. One tablespoonful butter. Two tablespoonfuls cornstarch. One teaspoonful white sugar. Salt and pepper to taste. Strain the juice from the tomatoes, setting aside the pulp for future use. Put the liquor over the fire in a saucepan, and add the sugar. Heat the milk in a double boiler and thicken with the corn- starch rubbed smooth with the butter. Stir in a pinch of soda, and just before taking from the stove pour the tomato into the milk. Season and serve at once. If left on the fire more than a minute after adding the tomato, the milk is apt to curdle. This will be found a simple and deli- cious soup. Pot Roast of Beef. Lay in a broad pot a boneless piece of beef, cut from the round. It should be between three and four inches in thickness, a solid “ chunk,” bound and skewered into compact shape. A piece weigh- ing from five to six pounds is enough for a family of ordinary size. Pour over it about a pint of boil- ing water, sprinkle with a few fine shreds of onion and a little salt, and cook over a slow fire. Turn the beef once or twice. Allow about fifteen min- utes to the pound for cooking. When it is done, transfer it to a dripping pan and brown slightly in the oven while the gravy is cooling suffi- ciently to allow the grease to be skimmed from it. Thicken the gravy with browned flour, boil up once, and add a dash of catsup. Pour part

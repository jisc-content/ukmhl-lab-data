267 FOOD FOR THE SICK. Abstain from overloading a patient’s plate. This caution is peculiarly necessary with sweets, as a surfeit of these is apt to cause future aver- sion. Lemon Jelly. Soak half a package of Coxe’s gelatine in one large cup of cold water, for one hour. Stir into this one cup of sugar, the juice of two lemons, and the grated peel of one, and add two cups of boiling water. Strain, without squeezing, into a wet mould. Orange Jelly Is good made in the same manner, substituting the juice and peel of tart oranges for those of lemons, and lessening the quantity of water. This dish can be rendered attractive to an inva- lid by halving a large orange and carefully scrap- ing out with a spoon every particle of pulp. Rinse with cold water, and set the jelly to form in these. Trim off the skin where the jelly shrinks from it in oooling, and serve without turning out of the improvised moulds. Claret Jelly. To half a box of Coxe’s gelatine soaked in one cup of water, add one cup of sugar, one of claret, one of boiling water, and a pinch of cinnamon. Strain into glasses or small moulds. When it is intended for an invalid, this mode of forming is preferable to having the whole amount made into one large shape.

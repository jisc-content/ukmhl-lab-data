256 LIBERAL LIVING UPON NARROW MEANS. Meringued Egg. Whip the white of an egg veiy light, heat it in a scallop shell or small flat dish, salt and pepper, and then lay the yolk in the centre of the white. Stand the dish in the oven until the yolk is set and the white a delicate brown. If the patient is allowed meat, a crisply broiled slice of breakfast bacon will be found an appetizing accompani- ment. Baked Omelet. Beat separately and extremely light the yolks and whites of three eggs, and then stir together until they are partially mixed. Add half a tea- spoonful — no more — of cornstarch, dissolved in three tablespoonfuls of milk, and a little salt. Pour into a well buttered baking dish, and cook in a quick oven for from five to eight minutes, or until Arm. Serve immediately. When a very small omelet is required a single egg may be pre- pared in the same manner, and baked in a good sized scallop shell. The quantity of milk and corn- starch must, of course, be reduced in proportion. Arrowroot Jelly. To two teacupfuls of boiling water, add four teaspoonfuls of Bermuda arrowroot, rubbed smooth in a little water. Let the mixture boil up once, and then remove it from the fire. Cool in cups or jelly glasses. Eat with powdered sugar and cream. Some people prefer to have the cream flavored with a little vanilla., lemon, or rosewater.

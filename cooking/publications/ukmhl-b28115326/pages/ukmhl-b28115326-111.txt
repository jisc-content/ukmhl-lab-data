Americans eat too much meat at all seasons of the year, and its consumption is espe- cially undesirable at a time when the heat renders it almost impossible to take regular and vigorous exercise. Once a day is often enough to have meat, and at the other meals its place may be taken by fish, eggs, salads, and fruit. SUNDAY. Stewed Ducks. Boiled Corn. Baked Potatoes. Fried Egg Plant. Whole Peach Pie. Stewed Ducks. Stuff a pair of ducks as for roasting. Make a gravy of the giblets, by cutting them in pieces, covering them with two cupfuls of water, and stewing a couple of hours. Lay the ducks, stuffed and trussed, in a dripping pan, dilute the gravy from the giblets until there is enough to half im- merse the ducks when it is poured over them, cover them with a pan of the same size as the other, and let them simmer in this for from two to three hours. Take them out and keep them hot while you thicken the gravy in the pan with browned flour, boil it up once and stir in the juice of a lemon, — or better still, two teaspoonfuls of currant jelly. Pass currant jelly with the ducks. This is an excellent way of disposing of old, tough ducks which would be uneatable if roasted in the ordinary manner.

Six large apples, sliced, cored, and chopped. Two cups fine bread crumbs. Half cup sugar. One tablespoonful butter. A little cinnamon. In the bottom of a greased pudding dish place a thin layer of the crumbs ; follow this by one of apples, well dotted with bits of butter and sprin- kled with sugar and spice. Kepeat the layer of crumbs, and continue in the same order until all the materials are exhausted, making the top stra- tum of the crumbs and laying bits of butter on it.

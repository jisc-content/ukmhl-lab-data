CHAPTER X. OCTOBER. Stkict observance of the minutiae of neatness is necessary for comfort at the table. When the tablecloth is disfigured by a spot at a single place, this should be concealed by a clean napkin smoothly laid over the unlucky blemish. The knives should never be allowed to appear until all marks of acid, etc., have been polished from them. The silver should be bright, and the china and glass free not only from visible dirt, but from the slight roughness to the touch that indicates either want of thoroughness in the wiping or im- perfect cleanliness of the towel. The saltcellars should be emptied and refilled after every meal, or the top of each be pressed down, specks re- moved, and more salt put in to take the place of that removed at the last using. A custom pursued in some households is that of putting on the individual saltcellars empty, and passing around a larger one full of salt and furnished with a salt spoon. Each person is thus enabled to help himself to what he will need for his own wants. The small quantity of salt left in the little cellars may then be thrown away after each repast.

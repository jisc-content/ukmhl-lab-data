APRIL. 55 Stewed Liver. One pound liver, cut into inch squares. Quarter of a pound chopped salt pork. One good sized onion, minced fine. One tablespoonful sweet herbs. Sprinkle the meat thickly with the onion, herbs, and a little pepper; place it in a tin pail with a closely fitting cover, and set this in an outer ves- sel of cold water. Bring this to a boil, and let it cook steadily for two hours. Uncover the inner pail, transfer the liver with a split spoon to a hot dish, thicken the gravy left in the pail with browned flour, boil up and pour over the liver. Spinach. Wash and pick over the spinach with great care, rinsing it in several waters. Strip the leaves from the stems, and cook in slightly salted boiling water for twenty minutes. Drain dry, and chop very fine, until it can be rubbed through a colan- der. Return to the fire, stir in two teaspoonfuls of butter, two tablespoonfuls of milk, a teaspoon- ful of sugar, pepper and salt to taste, and a pinch of cinnamon. Heat smoking hot, and beat very thoroughly until it is light and creamy. Turn out on slices of fried bread or buttered toast. Potato Puff. Two cupfuls cold mashed potato. A little fore- sight the previous day wfill result in having this already in the pantry.

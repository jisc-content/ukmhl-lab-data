147 NO V EMBER. Stewed Macaroni. The best variety of macaroni to use is the spa- ghetti, a size between the pipe and the vermicelli. Break half a pound of this into inch lengths, thus simplifying its management for the eaters, and put it into salted hot water. Boil half an hour, or until tender. Drain in a colander, pour into a dish, and stir into it a tablespoonful of butter melted in hot milk and two tablespoonfuls of grated cheese. Set in the oven a few minutes before sending it to the table. Celery. Wash and pick over carefully, selecting the whitest and freshest pieces. Send to table in a celery dish, or a high goblet, with ice about the celery. Pretty, long, shallow dishes are now sold for this use. Boiled. Chestnuts.

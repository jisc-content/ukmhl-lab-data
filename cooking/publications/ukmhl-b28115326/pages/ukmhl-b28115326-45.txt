35 MARCH. Jo7iq'uil Blanc-mange. Three cups milk. Two eggs. Half package gelatine. One cup cold water. One cup sugar. One teaspoonful vanilla. One cup cream. Soak the gelatine in the water for two hours. Heat the milk to boiling, adding a tiny pinch of soda and the sugar ; stir in the gelatine, and cook until dissolved. Beat the yolks of the eggs light, and add the boiling mixture to them little by little, to prevent curdling. Keturn to the fire, cook for two minutes, stirring constantly, flavor and pour into a wet mould, with a hole in the centre. This should be done on Saturday. Just before dinner on Sunday, whip the cream light with a Dover egg beater, add the whites of the eggs beaten to a meringue, and fill with this the opening in the turned out bowl of blanc-mange. Heap about the base as well. Fancy cakes are a pleasant addition to this dessert. MONDAY. Chicken Soup. Chicken Shortcake. French Beans with Sausages. Baked Potatoes. Hot Crackers and Cheese.

CHAPTER XX. FOOD FOR THE SICK, BOUILLONS AND BROTHS. So many exhaustive treatises have been penned upon diet for the sick that it would seem hardly probable that there are homes where the ques- tions of what to give the patient, and how to pre- pare the nourishing diet prescribed by the physi- cian, should be matters for troubled consideration. There are few households in which the duty of catering to the capricious desires of the sufferer is not felt to be more of a pleasure than a task. Frequently, however, the best intentions are sadly hampered by lack of knowledge, and, with all the good will in the world, the dishes prepared for the invalid are insipid and unattractive. The cook has to contend with languor and partial or total dearth of appetite, caused by confinement to room and bed, as well as with other effects of disease. Under these circumstances it is the more neces- sary that no means should be left untried to ren- der the meals dainty and tempting. The najdiin covering the tray should be spotless, silver, glass, and china shining in their cleanliness. A flower laid beside plate or cup is a cheering adjunct.

Cook without stirring until just before removing from the fire, when add salt to taste, and beat thoroughly for two minutes.

To a half cup of hominy, add enough water to cover it fairly, and cook gently half an hour in a double boiler. Drain off the water, and pour on in its place a cup and a half of hot milk. Boil slowly half an hour longer, or until tender. Serve with cream and sugar. Rice Boiled in Milk, with Egg. Wash thoroughly in two waters one half cup of rice. Put into a saucepan with at least three pints of boiling water. Cook hard for fifteen min- utes, or until the grains begin to soften, shaking often, but never stirring. When a grain can be easily mashed between the thumb and finger, drain off the hot water. Pour over the rice two cups of boiling milk into which a beaten egg has been whipped. Simmer gently ten minutes, salt to taste, and remove from the fire.

239 SUMMER DESSERTS. it is a wise precaution to lay a sheet of brown paper on the top of your pan, removing it long enough before taking out the cake to allow this to brown lightly. Sponge Cake Custards. Stale sponge cake, cut in slices. One cup marmalade, jam, or sweet jelly. T^hree eggs. Three cups milk. Half cup sugar. A small pinch soda in the milk. Heat the milk to scalding in a double boiler, add the sugar, and pour both, a little at a time, upon the beaten yolks of the eggs. Heturn to the fire and cook until it begins to thicken, stirring constantly. Add a teaspoonful of vanilla after the custard is taken from the stove, and set it aside to cool. Spread each piece of cake thickly with marmalade and arrange the slices in the bottom of a glass dish. When the custard is cool, pour it over the cake and on top heap the whites, beaten to a meringue with a tablespoonful of sugar. Set on the ice until needed and eat very cold. The dish may be made more elaborate by pouring a glassful of sherry over the cake before adding the custard. Coffee Charlotte Russe. One pint sweet cream. One third package gelatine.

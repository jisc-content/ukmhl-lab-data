69 MA Y. Spinach Shapes. Prepare spinach as directed in Chapter IV., but instead of turning into a deep dish when it is ready for the table, fill egg cups with it, pressing it down hard. Turn out of the moulds upon rounds of buttered toast, and garnish each hillock with a slice of hard boiled egg. Potatoes an Maitre PHotel. Boil firm potatoes, and when nearly cold, cut into neat slices. Heat a cupful of milk in a saucepan, add the potatoes, two teaspoonfuls of butter rolled in as much flour, a little minced parsley, and pepper and salt at discretion. When heated through, squeeze in the juice of half a lemon and serve. Strawberry Shortcake. Prepare a paste according to directions for chicken shortcake in Chapter III. Bake in layers, and between them place strawberries slightly crushed with the back of a spoon and plentifully sweetened. Cut into triangles and eat either warm or cold. Whipped cream is a delightful addition. FRIDAY. Broiled Shad. French Potato Balls. Green Peas. Queenâ€™s Toast.

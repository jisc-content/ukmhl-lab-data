THE SEAMY SIDE OF SUMMER. 193 pound of fruit. Spiced gooseberries are excellent, as are cherries and currants. The two last need not be strained. Canned Plums for Pies. Till quart jars with the fruit, and pour in enough cold water to cover them. Set the jars in a broad pot of hot water, taking care that they shall not touch each other. Bring the water in the pot to a boil and cook ten minutes, remove from the fire, screw the tops on the jars while still hot, and set away in a cool, dark place. Al- most any sort of fruit may be put up in this way, and will be admirable for pies or puddings, or by stewing, with a little more sugar, will make a good simple dessert. Canned Apple. Peel, core, and quarter tart, juicy apples, laying each piece in cold water as soon as prepared. Drain the water from them, weigh them, and put them over the fire in a porcelain lined kettle. Cook slowly half an hour, dip out the juice, and add half a pound of sugar for each pound of fruit. Boil ten minutes, and seal in pint glass jars. Peach Marmalade. Small peaches serve for this purpose quite as well as large ones. The fruit should be peeled and sliced, or cut into small pieces. Weigh it before putting over the fire. Cook three quarters

Order a good solid piece of cod; lay it in cold water, salted, for fifteen minutes ; sew it up in a piece of cheese cloth or white mosquito netting, and put on the fire in boiling water. Cook twenty minutes to the pound. Prepare the sauce by draining the liquor from a can of tomatoes, heat- ing this liquor over the fire, seasoning, and thick- ening with browned flour moistened with a little of the cold juice. Lay the piece of cod, released from the netting, upon a hot dish, and pour the sauce over and around it. Mashed Potato, browned. Prepare the mashed potato as usual, stir a beaten egg into it, mound on a pie plate, and bake in a quick oven. Boiled Bice with Cheese. Wash a cupful of raw rice in cold water, pick- ing it over carefully ; put over the fire in two quarts of water that is boiling hard at the time. Salt slightly, and cook twenty minutes, shaking the saucepan occasionally, but never stirring it.

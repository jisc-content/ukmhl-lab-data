CHAPTER XVI. DAINTY DISHES FOR TEA. The following recipes are not intended for elab- orate supper parties, but for simple family teas in households where the wife and mother has to do most of the preparation herself. While it may be easier to serve beef, veal, or chicken cold, it is believed that few women will grudge the slight additional labor involved by the following direc- tions, if, by its outlay, they can render the even- ing meal more appetizing, and the home more attractive. Mounded Beef. Two cupfuls cold roast or boiled beef, chopped as for hash. One cupful cold mashed potato. One cupful gravy. One tablespoonful Worcestershire sauce. One tablespoonful mixed green pickle or chow- chow. One teaspoonful minced onion. One saltspoonful each ground cloves, allspice, and cinnamon. Thyme, summer savory, sweet marjoram. Salt and pepper to taste.

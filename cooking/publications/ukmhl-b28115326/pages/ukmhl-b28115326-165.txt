FOR CHRISTMAS WEEK. 155 bob ‚Äù sleds of the Middle States, the fun and ex- citement are the same. Such expeditions should not be too large, and their members should be judiciously chosen. Twenty is an ample number, and among these there should be no one so tena- cious of his dignity or so averse to frolic as to mind a tumble in the snow. From such assem- blies should be rigorously excluded the practical joker, who is not happy unless he is making some of his fellow creatures uncomfortable by well- directed snowballs, or by upsetting a loaded sled. The fun over, every one is usually supplied with a hearty appetite, demanding something more substantial than the coffee and cake that serve very well at a home reception. A delicious supper may be provided by those living near enough the seashore to procure shell fish at rea- sonable rates, by having an oyster roast when the coasters return to the home of their host. The preparations for this are simple. An open fire- place and a bed of glowing coals, or a stove with the ovens well heated, are essential. The shell oysters, carefully washed, are brought in by the basketful and laid among the coals or on the oven floor. When the heat opens the shell, the contents are done. The shell is wrenched in two by a stout knife, the oyster treated with a little pepper, salt, and a dash of lemon juice, and is ready for eating. A good plan is for each man to open the oysters for himself and Iris' partner at the supper table. They must be eaten very hot.

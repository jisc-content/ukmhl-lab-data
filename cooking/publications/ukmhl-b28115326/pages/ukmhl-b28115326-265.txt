FOOD FOR THE SICK. 255 EGGS, CEREALS, ARROWROOT, AND WAFERS. The element of the unexpected should always be brought into play in catering for the sick. It may be laid down as an excellent rule never to ask a sick person what he wishes to eat. While it may be well occasionally to inquire if he has a longing for any particular delicacy, avoid sug- gesting articles of food. Far better provide the dainty, even with the risk of its failing to please. Study little surprises, and be careful not to make too much of a run upon one kind of food. An in- validâ€™s taste wearies of monotony in diet much more readily than would that of a well person, and a disgust of this sort once formed is almost impossible to eradicate. One case may be men- tioned where the constant use of eggs by a con- valescent engendered in her a distaste for them that never wholly disappeared. Another invalid acquired a disrelish for broiled quail, while a third, after recovery from a long illness never could bear the taste of oysters in any form. Drop-ped Eggs on Toast. Have ready in a shallow saucepan two cupfuls of boiling water, slightly salted. Break the egg carefully into this, and cook until the white has formed firmly about the yolk. Take from the water with a skimmer, and lay on a crustless slice of buttered toast. Salt and pepper lightly, and serve very hot.

Impoktant Notes. 161 HERLJS. The value of herbs for savories and soups is too little understood by American cooks. Here is "Aunt Susan's" receipt for a "soup powder" that v/ill flavor my soup, gravy, or savory dish with a fine flavor: SOUP POWDER. Sweet Marjoram—Powdered, two ounces. Parsley—Powdered, two ounces. Summer Savoi'y—Powdered, two ounces. Thyme—Powdered, two ounces. Bay Leaf—Powdered, two ounces. Lemon Peel—Powdered, one ounce. Sweet Basil—Powdered, one ounce. Rosemary—Powdered, one ounce. TO PREPARE ONIONS FOR SALADS OR FILL- INGS. Peel and slice, or chop, cover the onions with boil- ing water, and let stand three or four minutes, drain and put in ice water, let stand ten or fifteen minutes, or, until crisp. The onions are just as crisp as before, and much more delicate. THE WAY TO DRY CORN. Just scald, then cut from the cob, put in a pan and set over kettle of boiling water; stir frequently, and in a couple of hours the corn will be almost dry, if the water in kettle has been constantly kept at boiling. Set in warm oven half an hour and tlie corn is ready to put in bags; dry and clean.

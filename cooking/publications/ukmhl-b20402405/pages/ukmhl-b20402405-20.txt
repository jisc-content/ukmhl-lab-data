thus the purgatory of the Roman church becomes a very real and uncomfortable experience. If, on the contrary, clean habits of life have purified the astral body, when it is liberated at the hour of death from the prison house of flesh it is not of the same degree of density as the lower astral planes, and it passes on to the sunlit meadows of that world and away from its slums. Alcohol has also a most pei'nicious effect on the astral vehicle, and for that reason is eliminated from the food of the occultist. It is a great mistake to give to the perishing, alcohol, or narcotics, as it has really a more serious effect on the out-going astral than on the physical encasement. When man learns to live on clean food, to have clean habits and to think clean, generous thoughts, there is naught in all this wonder- ful universe that he need fear.

Potatoes, carrots, parsnips, and other articles re- ]uiring their skins to be removed for servirng or minc- ng, should, when possible, be steamed "in their jackets" and peeled as much as necessary afterwards. Cauliflowers, cabbage, &c., are excellent when steamed. Green peas, beans, and such, should be put n a covered vessel, with a little butter, and, when lecessary, a spoonful or two of water, and gently stewed, standing inside a saucepan of water without :he water touching them; or they can be stewed in he oven in an earthenware jar, with a little butter md a spoonful or two of water. This method of cook- ng takes very little longer time than the ordinary )oiling in water. The oven should be moderately leated. STEWING FRUITS. Fruits are better stewed in a double enamelled laucepan, or baked in a tightly covered earthen jar n the oven with as little water as possible. Dried fruits, such as raisins, figs, dates, &c., should )e washed and picked over carefully, then soaked for leveral hours in cold water till they are soft and iwollen to their fullest extent, when they should be itewed in the same water.

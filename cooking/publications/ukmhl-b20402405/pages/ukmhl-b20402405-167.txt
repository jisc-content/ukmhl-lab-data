151 English Marmalades. ENGLISH MARMALADES. RHUBARB MARMALADE. Peel and cut into inch pieces tender young rhubarb, to every pint allow one pound of loaf sugar and three oranges. Spread the cut rhubarb on a shallow dish and cover with the sugar; leave it for twelve hours; then put it into the preserving kettle with the grated yellow rind of the oranges (be careful not to use any of the white pulp or it will make the preserve bitter), add the tender, juicy pulp of the oranges and boil slowly for about one hour, or until jam sets when tested on a cold plate. ORANGE MARMALADE. To every pound of sliced oranges (one half Seville and one half sweet) add three pints of cold water; let stand in a cool place for forty-eight hours; then boil all together until tender, generally about two hours; set away for twenty-four hours. Then weigh the fruit and to every pound of the boiled fruit add three fourths of a pound of sugar. Boil until it will "set" when tried on a chilled plate. LEMON MARMALADE. Pour a scant quart of boiling water over two pounds of sugar and let it stand until dissolved. Pn.t

PREFACE. The aim of this book is to demonstrate tlie nutri- tious and appetising possibilities of vegetable foods, rattle are becoming so diseased that apart from a hu- mane revulsion against the consumption of meats in daily food, man is being driven for his own welfare to seek purer food substance. Any physical habit in- dulged in for generations is difficult to overcome, and the transition period between daily meat eating, and pure vegetarianism is a difficult one. We have endeav- ored to suggest such a variety of tasty and nutritious foods as will materially aid in making the "change. We do not claim this to be an exhaustive treatise on Vegetarian Cookery; only a clear and practical aid in the better preparations of some of the delicious products of the Vegetable Kingdom. Many children show a natural dislike to meats, and Mothers are at a loss how to sujjply them with j)roper nourishment Avhen they reject the meat. Requests have come to us for aid through this very fact; and was one of the in- centives to the bringing out of this book. Mothers will have no difficulty in finding a plenti- ful variety of relishable and nutritious foods for the children if they will study the following ])ages. Equal- ly easy will the formal dinner appear when one wishes to entertain Vegetarian friends.

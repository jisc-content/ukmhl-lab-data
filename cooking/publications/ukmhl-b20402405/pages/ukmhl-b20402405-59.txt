Eggs. EGG AND ASPARAGUS. Cut about two dozen stalks of asparagus into inch lengths and boil tender. Drain, pour over a cupful of drawn butter; stir until hot, turn into a baking dish. Break about six eggs on top, put a bit of butter on each, with salt, and pepper; put into a quick oven until the eggs are "set." DEVILLED EGGS. Boil the eggs for twenty minutes, remove the shells, cut each egg in half without breaking the whites; take out the yolks and pound them in a mor- tar, adding cayenne, salt and curry powder. Stuff the whites with this paste and join the eggs to their orig- inal shape. Cut olf just suflflcient of each broad end to enable them to stand, and arrange them thus on a dish in a bed of cress or parsley. EGGS ON TOAST. Put one tablespoonful of butter in a chafQng dish, and when bubbling add one tablespoonful of flour, one half teaspoonful of salt, one half saltspoonful of pep- per, and, gradually, one cupful of milk. Add the whites of three hard boiled eggs, chopped fine. When hot, pour over three slices of toast. Rub the yolks through a strainer over all and garnish with parsley.

PRINTED FOR CADELL & COMPANY, EDINBURGH; SIMPKIN AND MARSHALL, LONDON ; AND ALL BOOKSELLERS. 1829-UNfYERSiTt UBRARYi IbVtOPREFACE. This Volume contains a Complete System of Practical Cookery, so carefully adapted to the purposes of every-day life, that although a person, totally unacquainted with the art here treated of, may not be able at first to dress a dinner, merely by referring to this book, any cook or housekeep- er, possessed of ordinary experience, will certain- ly have the means of knowing, without further help than what these pages afford, how to pre- pare, in the best manner, every dish at present in general use. There are Twenty-five Chapters in all, arran- ged in the order of the following List, each of which is preceded by those useful Preparatory Remarks, which are usually kept at the begin- ning of the volume, at a most inconvenient dis- tance from the subject treated of. This is often aPREFACE. IV embarrassing; and, it is believed, the novelty in arrangement here adopted, will be found advanta- geous to all parties concerned. LIST OF THE CHAPTERS. Chap.

A copious alphabetical Table of Contents will be found at the beginning of the volume. Great pains have been taken to compose a work having, in all respects, a practical character. Care has also been used to collect valuable materials from various authentic sources, the chief object be- ing the composition of a treatise which might be called, with truth, the Cook’s Companion in the practice of Cookery; and at the same time, be no less useful to the mistress of a family, if required for occasional reference. The chief requisites, in a work of this kind, are first, the intrinsic excellence of the precepts it con-V PREFACE. tains; next, their economical adaptation to the habits and tastes of the majority of its readers; and, lastly, such a distinct arrangement of the various parts, that no difficulty can arise in search- ing for what is wanted, nor any ambiguity in the meaning of the directions when found. A perfectly original book of Cookery would nei- ther meet with, nor deserve, much attention; be- cause what is wanted in this matter, is not receipts for new dishes, but clear instructions how to make those already established in public favour. The study, therefore, of the author has been to con- sult the best authorities; to compare different re* ceipts with care and impartiality, and afterwards to select for publication those only which appear- ed economical, easy to follow, and calculated to furnish the dishes required for daily use, as well as those for occasions of ceremony. But nothing has been considered worthy of adoption, however high its pretensions, without some specific and substantial recommendations. Every receipt, therefore, has either been actually tried by the author, or by persons whose accuracy in the va- rious manipulations could be safely relied upon. The defects usually complained of in most Cookery books are their extravagance, and their want of distinctness in the directions. In many cases, they arc perversely adapted exclusively to the finances of persons who never think of reading receipts at all, but who overcome the whole diffi-PREFACE. VI culty by keeping highly-educated, and of course expensive Cooks. Such works, therefore, afford little assistance to the young mistress of a family, to country servants, or even to persons who live in towns, hut whose circumstances are so limited, that, with all the disposition in the world to learn the art of Cookery, they have no means of putting such costly lessons in practice. It is hoped that such criticisms will not apply to this work: as the author has used every effort of industry and patience, to arrive at the truth, and to impart it clearly and forcibly to others, so that correct knowledge and judicious economy might go hand in hand, in this important branch of housekeeping.INDEX FAGS A.

CHAPTER I. SOUPS. PREPARATORY REMARKS OX SOUPS AND GRAVIES. Every utensil employed in a kitchen must be kept scrupulously clean, and a cook ought to take especial care that all her sauce-pans be in good order. Brass pans are preferable for preserving in, and double-block tin are the best sort in use for every other purpose ; their covers should be made to fit closely, and the tinning always re- newed as soon as it is observed to be wearing off. While new, they may be easily kept clean by washing them re- gularly with hot water, and rubbing on them when quite dry, a little whitening with leather or flannel. After long use, they will require occasional scouring with fine sand ; and before they are used, they ought always to be rinsed out with hot water, and wiped with a clean cloth. A landlady will find it good economy, and for her advan- tage in other respects, to provide plenty of stone-ware and earthen vessels, and also common dishes for the kitchen, that the table set may not be used to keep cold meat on. In boiling soup, less water is used in a digester than in a common pot, as in the digester no steam can escape, ATHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 2 To extract the strength from meat, long ami slow boil- ing is necessary, but care must be taken that the pot is never off' the boil. All soups are the better for being made the day before they are to be used, and they should then be strained into earthen pans. When soup has jel- lied in the pan, it should not be removed into another, as breaking it will occasion its becoming sour sooner than it would otherwise do ; when in danger of not keeping, it should be boiled up. It never keeps long with many vege- tables in it. The meat used for soups or broths cannot be too fresh. When any animal food is plain boiled, the liquor, with the addition of the trimmings of meat and poultry, make good soups and gravies, as do also the bones of roasted or broiled meat. The gravies left in the dishes answer for hashes, and the liquor in which veal has been boiled, may be made into a glaze by boiling it with a ham bone till reduced to a third or fourth part, and seasoning it with the necessary herbs and spices. In boiling weak soups, the pan should be uncovered that the watery particles may escape. Cow-heel jelly improves every sort of rich soup ; and for thickening, truffles, morels, and dried mushrooms, may be used with advantage. Directions are given with each of the following soups for thickening with flour and butter, cream and eggs ; after the cream and eggs are added, the soup must not be allowed to boil. Should brown gravy or mock-turtle soup be spoiling, fresh-made charcoal, roughly pounded, tied in a little bag and boiled with either, will absorb the bad flavour, and leave it sweet and good. The charcoal may be made by simply putting a bit of wood into the fire, and pounding the burnt part in a mortar.3 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Mullagatawny Soup. 1’ut hall a pound of fresh butter, with six large onions sliced, three cloves of garlic, some chopped parsley, and sweet marjoram, into a stew-pan, let it stew over a slow tire till of a light brown colour ; cut in small pieces five pounds of lean beef, and let that stew till the gravy be ex- tracted, and then put in three quarts of boiling water, and half a pound of Scotch barley, ami let it simmer four hours very slowly ; mix four table spoonsful of currie-pow- der with cold water, and add it to the stock ; take out the beef, and rub the barley through a sieve, to thicken the soup. Cut a fowl in joints, skin it, and put it in a stew-pan with a piece of butter, and let it stew till quite tender; the stew-pan must be kept closely covered : this to be added to the soup, the last thing, with a pint of boiling milk, and the juice of two lemons. Boiled rice must always be served with this soup. Another Mullagatawny Soup. Make a strong stock of the bones of roasted beef, mut- ton, and fowl; while it is preparing, put into a stew- pan, with six ounces of butter, three quarts of sliced turnip, two quarts of carrots, and eight large onions also sliced; let them stew upon the stove till tender; then add three quarts of the prepared stock, a large slice of the crumb of bread, and two table-spoonsful of currie-powdei; let them stew four or five hours ; strain it through a tammy cloth, with two wooden spoons, taking care that no bones be left amongst the vegetables ; if too thick to go through, add more stock. Then cut a fowl in pieces, fry it in a frying-pan with butter, and add it to the soup; af- ter it has boiled a little, draw it to the side of the stove, and let it simmer, that the grease may be taken off. A little good beef stock, in addition to that made of the bones, will be an improvement. It is sometimes thicken- ed with whole or ground rice, instead of bread, and ought to be made upon a stove,THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 4 Mullagatawny, or Currie Broth. Make about two quarts of strong veal broth, season- ed with two onions, a bunch of parsley, salt and pep- per; strain it, and have ready a chicken, cut in joints and skinned; put it-into the broth, with a table-spoonful of currie-powder; boil the chicken till quite tender, and a little before serving, add the juice of a lemon, and stir in a tea-cupful of cream. Serve boiled rice to eat with this broth. Mullagatawny. Boil slowly in two quarts of water one pound of split peas, half an ounce of butter, two onions sliced, a little salt, cayenne, and two blades of mace. When the peas are tender, put in a large fowl, cut in joints and skinned, two quarts of boiling-water, or stock, if the soup be re- quired very rich; twenty minutes before serving, add a large table-spoonful of currie-powder, and the same of ground rice. Calfs-head Soup, or Mock Turtle. Parboil a calfs head, take off the skin and cut it in bits about an inch and a half square, cut the fleshy parts in bits, take out the black part of the eyes, and cut the rest in rings, skin the tongue, and cut it in slices, add it all to three quarts of good stock, and season it with cayenne, two or three blades of mace, salt, the peel of half a le- mon, and half a pint of white wine, w-ith about a dozen of forcemeat balls; stew all this an hour and a half, rub down with a little cold water, two table-spoonsful of flour, mix well amongst it half a pint of the soup, and then stir it into the pot; put in the juice of half a large lemon, and the hard-boiled yolks of eight eggs; let it simmer for ten minutes, and then put it all in the tureen. Another Calfs-head Soup. Scald and clean thoroughly a calf’s head with the skin on, boil it an hour gently in three quarts of water,THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 5 and parboil with it some sweetbreads. Cut oft' the meat, slice and fry of a light brown in butter two pounds of gravy beef, one of veal, and one of mutton, with five onions cut small; put all into the liquor, adding the bones of the head broken ; rinse the frying-pan with two quarts of boiling water, and put it to the meat, and other things, with two whole onions, a bunch of sweet herbs, and twice their quantity of parsley; the peel of one lemon, four cloves, a little allspice, salt, and black pepper, with a slice of the crumb of bread dried before the fire ; let all this stew slow- ly for five hours, strain it, and when cold, take off all the fat. Cut the meat of the calf’s-head, tongue, and sweet- breads, in small square bits, add them to the soup, and when it has boiled, mix very gradually with a large table- spoonful of flour, a cupful of the soup, and stir it gently into the pot; twenty minutes before serving, add a small tea-spoonful of cayenne, the yolks of eight or ten hard- boiled eggs, and the same number of forcemeat balls; a pint of white wine,—Madeira is the best,—and just be- fore serving, add the juice of a lemon. Forcemeat balls for this soup are made as follows: Mix the brains with five table-spoonsful of grated bread, the same of finely minced beef suet, a tea-spoonful of salt, one of white pepper, the grated peel of a lemon, some nutmeg, and boiled parsley chopped ; beat the yolks and whites of two eggs, roll the balls the size of the yolk of an egg, and fry them of a light brown in boiling dripping. Another Calf’s-liead Sou}). Take as much as is required of not very^grong veal, or beef stock, in which six onions have been boded, brown a quarter of a pound of butter and thicken it well with flour, then add the stock by degrees ; when it boils, put in the calf’s-head, cut in small pieces, and some fried forcemeat balls ; season it with salt and pepper. The peel of half a lemon improves it. When it has boiled twenty minutes, add two table-spoonsful of catsup, three of essence of anchovies, and as much lemon pickle as will make it a pleasant acid. To give the soup a good colour, and toTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. (j enrich the flavour, may be added a large table-Rpoonful of flour, mixed perfectly smooth in a tea-cupful of cold water, and stirred gradually into the soup, after which let it boil a few minutes. Another Calfs-head Soup. Cut half a pound of lean veal in small pieces, fry it of a light brown in butter; cut off the meat from the bones of a cow-heel, that has been boiled tender, in small pieces, put it into a stew-pan with the veal and two quarts of beef-gravy, one anchovy, and a bit of butter, some cayenne, a blade of mace, and three cloves ; stew it slowly an hour, then add a large glass of Madeira, or any white wine, the green part of a leek, some parsley, and lemon thyme, chopped small, lemon peel shred fine, and the juice of half a lemon. Let it stew very gently an hour and a half. Serve it with forcemeat balls and the yolks of hard-boiled eggs. Brown Gravy Soup. Take fifteen pounds of a leg or shin of beef, cut off the meat in bits, rub the bottom of the pot with butter, put in the meat, let it brown for nearly an hour, turning it con- stantly, break the bone and take out the marrow, which may be kept for a pudding, but it is considered better than butter to brown the meat with; put to it fourteen quarts of cold water, and the bones ; when it boils, skim it perfectly clean, and add six good-sized red onions, one carrot cut in three, one head of celery, a good handful of whole black and Jamaica pepper mixed; let this boil very gently ten or twelve hours closely covered, if upon a fire, but if done upon a hot plate, not to be covered ; strain it through a cullender, and then through a hair sieve, into a large pan, to be kept for use. Return the meat and bones into the pot with three or four quarts of hot water; let it boil nearly two hours, and strain it off. This makes good stock for gravies, stews, or any made dishes. This gravy soup keeps perfectly good for three or four weeks. When it is to be boiled to send to table, firstTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 7 l*oil vermicelli, or macaroni, iu a little salt and water, till tender ; strain it, and add it to the soup just before serving. 1 Ins soup is quite pure, and requires no clearing. It is a most convenient tiling to have in a house in cold weather, as it is always ready for use ; and served with dry toast to eat with it, makes an acceptable luncheon. The trimmings of meat, giblets, and bones, may lie boiled with the beef for this soup. Another Brown Gravy Soup. Cut down three pounds of gravy-beef, and put it on in a stew-pan with three onions cut small, and two ounces of butter; let it brown well, stirring it to prevent the onions from burning; then add four quarts of water, one head of celery, of carrots and turnips two each, with some whole black pepper and salt; boil it gently for four hours ; strain it; and the next day take off the fat. When it is heated, arid some vermicelli, previously boiled in water, and serve it after boiling ten minutes. Currie Soup. Mince small three or four onions, according to their size, put them into a sauce-pan with two ounces of but- ter, dredge in some Hour, and fry them till of a light brown, taking care not to burn them ; rub in by degrees a large table-spoonful and a half of currie-powder, till it be quite a paste ; gradually stir in three quarts of gravy soup, mixing it well together; boil it gently till it be well fla voured with the currie-powder; strain it into another sauce-pan, and add a fowl skinned and cut in small pieces, dividing each joint; stew it slowly an hour. In half a pint of the soup put a large table-spoonful of tamarinds, and stew them so as to separate the stalks and stones; strain and stir it into the soup with half a tea-spoonful of salt, and boil it for fifteen minutes before serving. Soup Cressy. Slice twelve large onions, and fry them pretty brown in a quarter of a pound of fresh butter ; scrape and clean8 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. two dozen of good red carrots, boil them in four quarts of water till quite soft; pound them in a marble mortar, mix them with the onions and add the liquor in which the carrots were boiled, a bunch of sweet herbs, pepper, salt, a blade of mace, and two or three cloves; let them all boil about an hour, then rub them through a hair sieve; put it on again to boil rather quickly, till it be as thick as rich cream. Put a little dry boiled rice in the tureen, and pour the soup over it. If the carrots are large, one dozen will be found sufficient. Another Soup Cressy. Wash clean, and cut small, eight carrots, eight turnips, three heads of celery, and six onions ; put them in a stew- pan with a quarter of a pound of butter and a slice of ham, stew them gently for an hour, stirring them constantly ; when they begin to brown add as much gravy soup as will fill the tureen; let it boil till the vegetables are suffi- ciently tender to pulp with a spoon through a sieve, after which put it on the fire and boil it half an hour, skim, and season it with pepper and salt. This soup should be as thick as melted butter. Two pounds of beef boiled in four quarts of water till reduced to three, will answer for the soup Scotch Hare Soup. Skin the hare, taking care to preserve the blood ; cut the hare in pieces, wash it clean, cut off the fleshy parts of the back and hind legs ; put all the rest on in a stew-pan with a table-spoonful of butter ; keep the cover on close, and let it stew half an hour; stir it now and then. In another sauce-pan put about three ounces of butter, and three table-spoonsful of flour ; brown it nicely.' Mix the blood with four quarts of cold water, strain it, and with the rest of the meat add it to the browned butter; stir it constantly, and when it boils, put it to the hare which is stewing, and add one carrot, one head of celery, and three large onions cut small ; season with pepper and salt. Let it boil from two hours to two hours and a half, accordingTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 9 to the hare, whether young or old. Just before serving, pick out all the bones, the carrot, and celery. Another Scotch Hare Soup. Cut off all the meat in large pieces ; stew the bones in three quarts of water with two heads of celery, five or six onions, some black pepper, salt, and cold meat bones. Have ready half a pound of rice, well browned, and add to it two ounces of browned butter; break the blood of the hare well in water, strain and add it cold to the brown- ing, stir it constantly till it boils, then add the stock strained, and the pieces of the hare, and stew it all together till sufficiently done. Hare Soup. Cut the hare in joints as for a fricassee, and put it in a stew-pan, with a little allspice, three blades of mace, some salt, and whole black pepper, a bunch of parsley, a sprig of lemon thyme, one of winter savory, four quarts of water, a slice of ham, and four pounds of lean beef, two carrots, and four onions cut down ; let it boil till it be re- duced to three quarts ; separate the hare, and strain the soup over it, and add a pint of port wine ; boil it up be- fore serring. French Hare Soup. Skin and wash perfectly clean two young hares, cut them into small pieces, and put them into a stew-pan, with two or three glasses of port wine, two onions stuck with two cloves each, a bunch of parsley, a bay leaf, of thyme, sweet basil, and marjoram ; two sprigs each, and a few blades of mace ; let the whole simmer upon a stove for an hour. Add as much boiling broth as will entirely cover the meat, simmer till it be soft enough to pulp through a sieve, then strain it and soak the crumb of a twopenny loaf in the strained liquor ; separate the bones from the meat, pound the meat in a mortar, and rub it along with the liquor through a sieve ; season with pepperTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 10 and salt, and heat the soup thoroughly, hut do not let it boil. Jugged Hare. In five quarts of water, put a pound of scrag of mut- ton, one of gravy beef, one of a shank of veal, and a slice of ham, all cut small; two turnips, two carrots, three onions chopped, a little mace, salt, and pepper; stew these ingredients for three or four hours, and strain the soup. The next day cut a hare in small pieces, season it with pepper, salt, half a grated nutmeg, and the peel of a small lemon ; put it into a stone jar, and fill it up with the prepared soup ; put a bung in the jar, tie a bladder and a bit of linen over, and set it in a pot of cold water ; as it wastes, fill it up with more boiling water, and let it boil three hours. When cold, take off the fat and pick out the lemon peel. This quantity will make two tureens full, and when to be used is thickened with a table-spoonful of flour, kneaded with a small bit of butter, and half a pint of port wine to each dish. It will keep perfectly good for a fortnight. Venison Soup. Boil down in five quarts of water two pounds of a shank of veal, or a fowl, and five pounds of the breast of venison cut small; two or three onions chopped, some whole white pepper and salt, with a quarter of a pound of lean ham. Let it stew till it be completely boiled down, when all the strength will be extracted ; rub it through a sieve, thicken it with a little butter, kneaded in flour, and add a pint of Madeira, and boil it for a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes. Brown Venison Soup. Cut in small pieces six or seven pounds of the breast of venison, put it in a stew-pan with two or three ounces of butter; cover it closely, stir it once or twice, and let it stew an hour. Mix four quarts of cold water with a pint and a half of the blood, put it on the fire in another stew-TIIE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. II pan, ami stir it constantly till it boil; then add the stew to it with an onion minced small, and a whole carrot, some salt, black and Jamaica pepper. If the meat be young, let it boil gently for two hours; if old, two and a half will be necessary. A little before serving, take out the carrot and all the bones, leaving a little of the meat; mix in half a pint of port wine, and let it boil a short time. It may be thickened with a little flour and butter. White Soup. Blanch in cold water for twelve hours two pounds of very lean beef, put it into a pot, with a knuckle of veal, five quarts of water, two carrots, two turnips, and four middling-sized onions, a table-spoonful of white pepper, a little mace and salt; let this boil four hours, or till the strength be extracted, strain it, and the next day take off all the fat. Blanch half a pound of sweet almonds, pound them in a mortar, with a little water to prevent their oil- ing, mix them with the soup, and let it boil for a short time, and just before serving, add a pint of rich cream ; do not allow the soup to boil after the cream is stirred in. A good substitute for cream is the same quantity of milk, boiled and mixed with a dessert-spoonful of arrow-root. Another White Soup. Boil together a knuckle of veal, a fowl, or two chick- ens skinned, a carrot, a turnip, an onion, some salt, and a little whole white pepper; take out the chickens when tender, cut them in joints, and add them to the soup when strained, beat up the yolks of nine eggs, mix them with a pint of cream and a table-spoonful of well-boiled rice ; stir it gradually into the soup, and heat it gently before serving. A cow heel that has been previously boiled, cut up in pieces, may be used instead of the chickens. Another White Soup.

Another White Soup. Put on in four quarts of water, a knuckle of veal, six pounds weight, a quarter of a pound of lean ham or ba- con, two slices of the crumb of bread, one ounce of blanch- ed sweet almonds, put in whole; six middling-6ized oni- ons, two heads of celery, some whole white pepper, three blades of mace, a bunch of parsley, and a sprig of thyme; stew all these gently for eight hours, strain it, and when cold take off all the fat; boil it, and just before serving, take it off the fire, and stir in very gradually a pint of thick cream. Another White Soup. Boil in four quarts of water four pounds of veal, and a fowl, with some whole white pepper, a little mace, and three middling-sized onions whole, and a bunch of pars- ley ; let it boil three hours, strain it, and put it on again to get quite hot, and just before serving, stir in gradually half a pint of cream with the yolks of three eggs well beaten. Do not let it boil, as that will make the eggs curdle. Another White Soup. Stew in three quarts of boiling water, till quite ten- der, a knuckle of veal, with a quarter of a pound of whole rice, three whole onions, a bunch of parsley, a little sweet marjoram, and two or three blades of mace, and some salt; a little before the soup is strained, add two anchovies; strain through a hair sieve and then through a silk one, or tammy, put it again upon the fire, and stir in half a pint of rich cream, or a pint of milk with the yolks of two eggs beat up in it; let it be hot, but not boiling. If it is requi- 2THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 13 red to be richer, boil a fowl in the stock, with two ounces of pounded blanched sweet almonds. Another White Soup. Put on in five quarts of water four pounds of a shank of veal, break the bone well, let it simmer till it be redu- ced nearly half; boil a tea-cupful of whole rice till very tender, pulp it through a cullender, strain the liquor, and add the rice, season with salt and white pepper, let it sim- mer for nearly an hour, and add, a little before serving, six yolks of eggs beaten extremely well. Moor-Fowl Soup. It may be made with or without brown gravy soup ; when with the former, six birds are sufficient, when with moor-fowl only, boil five in four quarts of water, pound the breasts in a mortar and rub it through a sieve, put it with the legs, backs, and three more moor-fowl, cut down in joints, into the liquor, season with a pint of port wine, pepper, and salt, and let it boil an hour. When only six birds are used, pound the breast of three or four. Pigeon Soup. Make a strong beef stock, highly seasoned as if for brown soup, take six or eight pigeons according to their size, wash them clean, cut off the necks, pinions, livers and gizzards, and put them into the stock ; quarter the pi- geons and brown them nicely ; after having strained the stock, put in the pigeons; let them boil till nearly ready, which will be in about half an hour, then thicken it with a little flour, rubbed down in a tea-cupful of the soup, season it with half a grated nutmeg, a table-spoonful of lemon juice or of vinegar, and one of mushroom catsup ; let it boil a few minutes after all these ingredients are put in, and serve it with the pigeons in the tureen ; a better thickening than flour is to boil quite tender two of the pigeons, take off all the meat and pound it in a mortar, rub it through a sieve, and put it, with the cut pigeons, into the strained soup.11. THE PRACTICE OE COOKERY. To make partridge soup, partridges may be substituted for pigeons, when only four birds will be required ; pound the breast of one. Another Pigeon Soup. Take eight pigeons, cut down two of the oldest, and put them, with the necks, pinions, livers, and gizzards of the others, into four quarts of water; let it boil till the sub- stance be extracted, and strain it; season the pigeons with mixed spices and salt, and truss them as for stewing; pick and wash clean a handful of parsley, chives or young on- ions, and a good deal of spinnach, chop them ; put in a frying-pan a quarter of a pound of butter, and when it boils, mix in a handful of bread crumbs, keep stirring them with a knife till of a fine brown ; boil the whole pigeons till they become tender in the stock with the herbs, and fried bread. If the soup be not sufficiently high seasoned, add more mixed spices and salt. Giblet Soup. Clean very nicely two sets of giblets, parboil them. Take the skin off the feet; cut the gizzards in quarters, the necks in three bits, the feet, pinions, and livers, in two, the head in two also, first taking oft’ the bill; boil them till nearly done enough in a quart of weak gravy soup with an onion. Have ready boiling some rich liigh- ly seasoned brown gravy soup; add the giblets and the liquor they have been boiled in, with some chopped pars- ley ; take out the onion, and thicken the soup with a bit of butter kneaded in flour. If the giblets are not per- fectly sweet and fresh, do not add the weak soup they were boiled in. Half a pint of white wine may be added a little before serving, but it is very good without. Kidney Soup. Cut down two kidneys, fry them a little in butter and flour, stew them in a quart of highly seasoned gravy soup till tender, then add two quarts more of the soup, and thicken it with browned flour and butter.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 15 Ox Cheek Soup. Separate the bones from the meat, ami break the former, cut the meat into pieces the length of a finger and the breadth of two, put a quart of water to every pound of meat, with a little salt, set it on a gentle fire, and skim it well during the first boiling ; after it has stewed gently two hours, add carrots, turnips, onions, celery, a head or two of cabbage, and a bunch of sweet herbs, pepper, salt, and a quarter of a pound of vermicelli; let it stew two hours and a half longer, skim it, and take out the herbs and bones. Chestnuts are a good substitute for vermicelli. Another Ox Cheek Soup. Wash the cheek clean, and cut it in small pieces, stew it till tender, in four or five quarts of water, with turnips, thyme, parsley, black-pepper-corns, and a few peas ; strain off the gravy and let it stand till the next day, then take off the fat, and cut the meat from the bones in small pieces, and stew it a little longer in the gravy with six or seven onions sliced and fried a light brown, some carrots, and celery cut small, a little salt, and cayenne. Sheep’s Head Broth. After having the sheep’s head and trotters singed, which is done with a red-hot iron, (the head and trotters are usually sent for this purpose to a blacksmith’s forge,) split the head, and take out the brain, which is not used, cut out the white of the eye, and rub the head and feet well over with it; let them lie for two hours, then wash them very well in lukewarm water, and rinse them tho- roughly. Cut out the tough membrane from between the toes, and lay them in cold water for two hours. Put on two gallons of water, and three quarters of a pound of Scotch barley; when it boils put in the head, trotters, and neck of the sheep, of carrots, and turnips, a quart; when cut down in dice, add a little salt, cover the pot closely, and let it boil four hours; take off the scum as it rises; put in some chopped onions about an hour before serving.]() THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Boil some whole carrots and turnips, or cut them in half, to put round the head, trotters, and neck in the dish. In summer, green peas are a great improvement to this broth. Scotch Barley Broth. In two gallons of cold water, boil six ounces of bar- ley ; when it boils skim it, and put in a fowl and one pound of beef, or three pounds of the latter without the fowl; add three pounds of carrots and turnips, and three onions, cut very small. If greens are to be used, they will only require to be boiled an hour, and one ounce more of bar- ley is requisite. Skim it when the vegetables come to a boil, (ind keep the pot boiling constantly for five hours. The fowl ought to be taken out when boiled enough, and heated in the broth, so as to be served up with it, or in another dish. Or it may be made exactly in the same manner as the Sheep’s Head Broth of the last receipt, substituting for the head, ribs of mutton, beef, veal, or fowl, and is better to be composed of a variety of these meats. Scots Kale. Put barley on in cold water, and when it boils take off the scum, put in any piece of fresh beef, and a little salt; let it boil three hours, have ready a cullender full of kale, cut small and boil them till tender. Two or three leeks may be added with the greens, if the flavour is ap- proved of. This broth is also made with salted beef, which must be put in water over night to soak. Leek Soup, which in Scotland is called Cocky Leeky. Wash and clean three or four dozen leeks, cut the white and tender green part in bits, about an inch long, and wash them again, and put them to drain in a cullender or sieve. Have ready boiling four quarts of stock, made from beef, seasoned with pepper and salt; put in the leeks, and boil them gently for three hours, adding a fowl timeTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 17 enough to allow it to be well boiled, and serve it in the tureen. Beef Brose. After any large piece of beef has been taken out of the pot it was boiled in, skim off the fat with part of the liquor, and boil it in a sauce-pan. Have ready in a bowl oatmeal that has been toasted brown before the fire, pour in the boiling liquor and stir it a little ; if too thick, add more liquor, and send it to table quite hot. Rice Veal Broth. Wash clean six pounds of a knuckle of veal, and cut it in two, put it in a sauce-pan with four quarts of boil- ing water, half a pound of rice well washed, a little mace, white pepper, and salt, and a handful of chopped parsley; let it boil for two hours. Serve part of the meat in the tureen with the broth. The thick part of the knuckle may be sent up as a separate dish, with parsley and butter poured over it. Thick Beef Soup. In eight quarts of water boil gently for seven hours, skimming it well, a shin, or leg of beef, and a bunch of sweet herbs; strain it the next day, take off the fat, and cut all the gristly and sinewy parts from the bones, add them to the soup with some leeks, onions, celery, pepper, salt, and ten or twelve ounces of Scotch barley parboiled; boil it gently for two or three hours. This stock or jelly will keep good for weeks in cold weather. Beef or Mutton Soup. Boil very gently in a closely covered sauce pan, four quarts of water, with two table-spoonsful of sifted bread raspings, three pounds of beef cut in small pieces, or the same quantity of mutton chops taken from the middle of the neck; season with pepper and salt, add two tur- nips, two carrots, two onions, and one head of celery, all B18 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. cut small; let it stew with these ingredients four hours, when it will he ready to serve. Rice Soup. Boil in four quarts of water the scrag end of a neck of veal and one pound of lean ham, till it be reduced nearly half; carefully skimming it, season with white pepper, and two blades of mace. Wash very clean three quarters of a pound of rice, strain the soup, and boil the rice in it till it be tender. Veal Soup. Skin four pounds of a knuckle of veal, break, and cut it small, put it in a stew-pan with two gallons of water ; when it boils skim it, and let it simmer till reduced to two quarts ; strain, and, when required for the table, season it with white pepper, salt, a little mace, a dessert-spoonful of lemon juice, and thicken it with a large table-spoonful of flour, kneaded with an ounce of butter. Soup Maigre. Cut small four ounces of sorrel, sixteen ounces of celery, and six or eight onions. Fry them in six ounces of butter, and stew them three or four hours in three quarts of water. Season with pepper, salt, and a little mace, and thicken it with a large table-spoonful of flour, mixed in a tea-cup full of the soup. Beat up the yolks of two eggs in half a pint of cream, put it into the tureen, with a large slice of bread toasted and cut in dice, and then pour in the stewed ingredients. Another Soup Maigre. Brown half a pound of butter in a sauce-pan, and stew it for a quarter of an hour with the following ingredients, all washed clean and chopped small,—four cabbage let- tuces, two handsful of spinach, the same of chervil, one handful of white beet leaves, and one of sorrel, three car- rots scraped down, sortie pepper and salt; add five pints of boiling water, and a large slice of the crumb of bread1«) THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. cut thin and dried before the fire. Stew it gently for two hours ; and a little before serving thicken it with the yolks of three eggs beaten with half a pint of cream, or good milk. A pint of green peas and the tops of aspa- ragus may be added. Soup Sante. Peel four large onions, cut them small, with four white lettuces, a handful of spinach, and a slice of grated bread. Stew all these ingredients for an hour in a quart of broth and a quarter of a pound of butter, then add three pints more of broth, skim off all the fat, and boil it a quarter of an hour, season with pepper and salt. Be- fore serving, add half a pint of good cream. A pint of green peas, added with the other vegetables, is a great improvement. Old Peas Soup. Put a pound and a half of split peas on in four quarts of water, with roast beef or mutton bones, and a ham bone, two heads of celery, and four onions, let them boil till the peas be sufficiently soft to pulp through a sieve, strain it, put it into the pot with pepper and salt, and boil it nearly an hour. Two or three handsful of spinach, well washed and cut a little, added when the soup is strained, is a great improvement; and in the summer young green peas in place of the spinach. A tea-spoonful of celery seed, or essence of celery, if celery is not to be had. Another Old Peas Soup. Boil in five quarts of water one quart of split peas, an ounce of butter, four pounds of beef, two carrots, three turnips, four heads of celery, three onions, some salt and black pepper; boil them till the peas are dissolved and will easily pulp, put it all through a sieve, then put the soup over the fire with three ounces of butter and a table- spoonful of flour, and boil a small bit of lean bam in it, till it is time to serve ; take it out before dishing, and have ready some celery stewed in butter, and fried bread cutTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 20 in dice, and dried mint rubbed very fine, to send to table with it. Another Old Peas Soup. Boil in four quarts of water a shank of ham, or a piece of bacon, and about half a pound of mutton, or salt beef, and a pint of split peas; boil all together very gently till the peas are quite soft, strain them through a hair sieve, and bruise them with the back of a spoon till all is pulped through, then boil the soup gently for one hour before serving. Thin slices of bread toasted and cut in dice to be served with it, either upon a dish or in the soup ; if in the soup, it should be fried in butter, and dried mint rubbed fine sent to table in a small dish. It may be also made with fourpence worth of bones, boiled for some hours in four quarts of water, with a carrot, a head of celery, three onions, some pepper and salt, strained, and the next day the fat taken off, and the peas boiled in the liquor with a little bit of butter, till sufficiently tender to pulp through a sieve. Green Peas Soup. Put a pint of old green peas into three quarts of water, a slice of the crumb of bread, two onions, a sprig of mint, some salt and pepper; boil them till the peas are perfectly soft, and then pulp them through a sieve ; have ready two lettuces stewed tender in butter, and a pint and a half of young green peas boiled ; put them into the soup with a little spinach juice, and a quarter of a pint of the juice of the youngest pea pods, and boil it all to- gether before serving. Another Green Peas Soup. Shell a quart of green peas not very old, put the shells into a gallon of cold water, with a bit of bacon or mutton, boil them till very soft, pour the liquor through a hair sieve, and bruise the shells with a spoon till no- thing remains but the skin. Pound in a marble mortarTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 21 a handful of spinach, mix it with a little of the liquor, and strain it through a sieve, and boil it gently with the rest ot the liquor for half an hour; then put in the quart of peas, and when they are boiled the soup is ready.

If it should not be green enough, pound some spinach, squeeze the juice through a cloth, put about a quarter of a pint into the tureen, and pour in the soup. This is the best method to make green peas soup of a good colour. Cucumber Soup. Make some broth with a neck of mutton, a thick slice of lean bacon, an onion stuck with three cloves, a carrot, two turnips, some salt, and a bunch of sweet herbs ; strain it; brown with an ounce of butter the crumb of a FrenchTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 22 roll, to which put four large cucumbers, and two beads of lettuce cut small; let them stew a quarter of an hour, and add to them a quart of the broth ; when it boils put in a pint of green peas, and as it stews, add two quarts more of the broth. Beet Root Soup. Boil till tender two roots of beet, and rub off the skin with a coarse towel, mince them finely, as also two or three onions ; add this to five pints of rich gravy soup, so as to make it rather thick, then stir in three or four table-spoonsful of vinegar and one of brown sugar; let it boil, and throw in some fricandellans made up in the form of corks, and rolled in flour. Herb Soup. Wash and cut small twelve cabbage lettuces, a hand- ful of chervil, one of purslane, one of parsley, eight large green onions, and three liandsful of sorrel; when peas are in season omit half the quantity of sorrel, and put a quart of young green peas ; put them all into a sauce-pan, with half a pound of butter and three carrots cut small, some salt and pepper; let them stew closely covered for half an hour, shaking them occasionally to prevent their adhering to the pan ; fry in butter six cucumbers cut long-ways in four pieces ; add them with four quarts of hot water, half a French roll, and a crust of bread toasted iqion both sides; and let the whole boil till reduced to three quarts, then strain it through a sieve ; beat up the yolks of four eggs with half a pint of cream, and stir it gently into the soup just before serving. Tomata Soup. Wash, scrape, and cut small the red part of three large carrots, three heads of celery, four large onions, and two large turnips, put them into a sauce-pan, with a table- spoonful of butter, and half a pound of lean new ham ; let them stew very gently for an hour, then add three quarts of brown gravy soup, and some whole black pep-THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 23 per, with eight or ten ripe tomatas ; let it boil an hour and a half, and pulp it through a sieve; serve it with fried bread cut in dice. Vegetable Soup. Pare and cut small one dozen of common-sized onions, five large yellow turnips, two heads of celery, and the red part of three large carrots ; wash and put them in a stew-pan with two ounces of butter, cover it closely ; and when the vegetables are a little soft, add to them four quarts of wrell-seasoned gravy soup made of roast beef bones, and let it stew four or five hours ; rub it through a tammy, put it on the fire, boil and skim it before serving. Winter Vegetable Soup. To every gallon of water allow, when cut down small, a quart of the following vegetables; equal quantities of turnips, carrots, and potatoes, three onions, two heads of celery, and a bunch of sweet herbs ; fry them brown in a quarter of a pound of butter, add the water with salt and pepper, and boil it till reduced to three quarts, and serve it with fried toasted bread. , Another Winter Vegetable Soup. Peel and slice six lprge onions, six potatoes, and four turnips ; fry them in half a pound of butter or very fresh dripping ; toast a crust of bread brown and hard, put it, with two or three heads of celery cut small, some herbs, pepper, and salt, with the fried vegetables, into five pints of water, to stew gently for four hours, then strain it through a sieve, add a little carrot and celery cut small, and some chopped parsley, one anchovy or a red herring, and a little cayenne; boil it till the vegetables are tender. Onion Soup. Stew till perfectly tender, in about five pints of weak veal or beef stock, two dozen of onions, peeled and sliced,THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 24 three turnips, one parsnip, two carrots, two heads of ce- lery, without the green part, a bunch of sweet herbs, half an ounce of white pepper, a little salt, and a quarter of a pound of bam ; when sufficiently tender, press all the ingredients through a tammy, and let the soup stand till cold: pound the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs, mix them with a pint of thick cream, and stir it into the soup and heat it, but be careful not to boil it; new milk and the yolks of six eggs will answer instead of cream. Toast a piece of bread the size of a small roll, and put it into the soup before serving it. Another Onion Soup. Boil in four quarts of water six pounds of a knuckle of veal, with a dessert-spoonful of whole white pepper, and a few blades of mace ; when the meat is so much boiled as to leave the bone, strain off the stock. The follow- ing day boil nine or ten large Spanish onions in milk and water, till sufficiently tender to pulp through a sieve ; take the fat off from the top of the stock, boil it up, and add the onions with about a quarter of a pound of fresh butter worked with two heaped table-spoonsful of sifted flour of rice, and a little salt; boil it gently for half an hour, stirring it constantly, and, a little before serving, stir in half a pint of rich cream. Carrot Soup. Make a rich stock with a shin of beef, a quarter of a pound of lean ham, a fowl, or a piece of veal, a bunch of sweet herbs, two onions, a carrot, black and Jamaica pepper, salt, and three cloves ; strain it, and when cold take off all the fat; clean and boil, till they become very tender, the red part of twelve or thirteen carrots, accord- ing to their size, and two turnips; pound them in a mortar ; pound half a pound of cold roast beef, or beef steak ; warm it, and rub it with the carrots through a tammy or sieve ; add this to the soup, and serve it boil- ing hot.H5 TIIE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Stock made with bones may be substituted for fresh beef stock. Another Carrot Soup. Wash, scrape, and slice ten or twelve carrots, put them, with an ounce and a half of butter, into a stew- pan, cover it closely, and let them stew till sufficiently soft to press through a tammy or hair sieve ; add the pulp to as much well-seasoned stock as will make it of the thickness of rich cream, and boil it for twenty or thirty minutes. Hotch Potch. Cut in dice a good quantity of young turnips, carrots, and the tops of cauliflowers, with one or two lettuces, cut very small; put these vegetables, with a pint of full- grown peas, into four quarts of boiling water, and let it boil gently for two hours ; cut in neat chops a loin, or the best end of a neck of mutton, add them to the vege- tables, with salt, pepper, and some onions cut small; let them boil an hour and a half, then add three pints of green peas, and boil half an hour longer, when it is ready to serve. Another Hotch Potch. Put on, in three quarts of water, a small bit of the neck of mutton, or any scraps, one quart of carrots and turnips when cut in dice, and some salt; boil them gent- ly for an hour, then add a little cauliflower, lettuce, parsley, and onions cut small; boil a quart of full-grown peas in another sauce-pan, till sufficiently tender to press through a sieve; add it to the soup, taking out the bits of mutton, with three pints of young peas, and some nice mutton chops, and let it all boil till they are done enough.

Soup Lorrain. Boil in four quarts of water a knuckle of veal, one pound of lean beef, and one pound of mutton, a carrot, a turnip, a bunch of parsley, and a little lemon thyme, some salt and white pepper, till reduced to three, then strain the liquor; pound very finely in a marble mortar all the white meat of a large roasted fowl, with a quarter of a pound of blanched almonds, and the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs ; boil in milk the crumb of a French roll, and pound it with the other ingredients, and stir it all well into the soup ; let it boil gently for ten minutes before serving. Vermicelli Soup. The day before it is required make four quarts of good stock, and boil in it one carrot, one turnip, four onions, one or two parsley roots, three blades of mace, salt, and some white pepper ; strain it, and, before using, take oft' all the fat; boil in some of the liquor the crumb of three French rolls till soft enough to mash smooth; boil the soup and stir well in the mashed rolls; boil it for a quarter of an hour, and, before serving, add the yolks of two eggs beaten with three table-spoonsful of cream ; boil in water two or three ounces of vermicelli for fifteen or twenty minutes, strain and put it into the tureen, and pour the soup upon it.

Macaroni Soup. Make a good stock with a knuckle of veal, a little sweet marjoram, parsley, some salt, white pepper, three blades of mace, and two or three onions ; strain and boil it. Break in small bits a quarter of a pound of maca- roni, and gently simmer it in milk and water till it be swelled and is tender; strain it, and add it to the soup, which thicken with two table-spoonsful of flour, mixed in half a pint of cream, and stirred gradually into the soup. Boil it a few minutes before serving. Another Macaroni Soup. Boil for three hours very quickly, in five quarts of water, seven pounds of veal, a little salt, a dessert-spoon- ful of white pepper, and three or four blades of mace; strain it off, put it into a sauce-pan, and keep it hot upon a stove. Mix five table-spoonsful of flour with two ounces of butter, put it into an iron-tinned sauce-pan, and stir it over the fire till it be melted ; add half a pint of the strained stock, and then gradually mix the whole to- gether, and keep stirring constantly till it thickens, and then add two ounces and a half of macaroni, previously boiled in milk and water for eight minutes ; stir it again till it boil. Take the pan oft' of the stove, and stir in by degrees about three quarters of a pint of rich sweet cream, and just let it boil before serving. Soup a la Reine. Pound in a marble mortar the white meat of three cold roasted fowls, and half a pound of sweet almonds blanched ; add a little cream whilst pounding. Boil this with four quarts of well-seasoned veal stock, then strain it, and just before serving stir in a pint of cream.28 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Potage h la Reine. Draw, wash, and clean three chickens, or young fowls ; put them into a stew-pan, with a bunch of parsley and some well-seasoned boiling veal stock; let it stew for an hour; take out the fowls, and pound all the meat to a fine paste in a marble mortar, with the crumb of two penny loaves, previously soaked in the soup, and the yolks of three or four hard-boiled eggs ; rub all through a sieve, and add it to the soup, stirring it well. Put a quart of rich cream on the fire, and stir it till it boils, and then mix it with the soup, and serve it quite hot. A Simple Soup. Cut small one pound of carrots, one pound of turnips, half a pound of onions, one lettuce, a little celery, and a handful of parsley; stew them for twenty minutes with a quarter of a pound of butter, some salt and pepper; then put them into three quarts of stock, made with two pounds of veal, and add one quart of green peas, and let it stew for three hours. Press it through a sieve, and boil it up before sending it to table. Prussian Soup. In seven pints of water boil, till reduced to five, one pound of lean beef, cut in small bits, one pint of split peas, three quarters of a pound of potatoes, three ounces of ground rice, two heads of celery, three leeks, or onions, seasoned with pepper, salt, and a little dried mint; strain it through a cullender. Stove or Spinach Soup. Boil in two quarts of water three sliced onions. Pick and clean as much spinach as will make two large dishes, parboil and put it in a cullender, to let the bitter water drip from it; let cold water run upon it for a minute or two, and then press out the water. Knead two ounces of fresh butter, with a table-spoonful and a half of flour, mix it with the spinach, which boil for fif-THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 2f> teen minutes in the water and onions, then put in half a pint of cream or good milk, some salt and pepper, boil it tor fifteen minutes more. In the season of green peas, a quart added with the spinach is a great improvement. It is common to boil a lamb’s head and pluck with the soup, and send them to table in the tureen. The soup is then called lamb’s stove; but with the peas it is quite as good without. Potatoe Soup. Potatoe soup is made with beef or mutton scraps, boiled in water till the strength be extracted ; strain the liquor, and put it into the pot; after washing the pota- toes, scrape oft' the skin, cut them in quarters with some onions, season with pepper and salt, and boil them an hour and a half, then press them through a cullender, and put the soup on to boil a little time. It may be made very good with butter only, a quarter of a pound of which is added after the potatoes have been put through the cullender. Oyster Soup. Boil in water the crumb of two twopenny rolls, with a few blades of mace, a tea-spoonful of whole white pep- per, and four onions cut small. Pick out the spice, and rub the bread and onions through a hair sieve, then add it to three quarts of well-seasoned strong veal stock. Hub down three ounces of butter, with a table-spoonful of flour, and mix it gradually with half a pint of the soup, and then stir all well together. When it has boiled a short time, add with their liquor half a hundred or more of fine oysters, and let the whole simmer for ten or fif- teen minutes. If the soup is not quite salt enough with the liquor of the oysters, a little salt may be added. Lobster Soup. Cut small a dozen of common-sized onions, put them into a 6tew-pan with a small bit of butter, a slice or twoTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 30 of loan ham, and a slice of lean beef; when the onions are quite sofi, mix gradually with them some rich stock ; let it boil, and strain it through a fine hair sieve, pressing the pulp of the onions with a wooden spoon ; then boil it well, skimming it all the time. Beat the meat of a boiled haddock, the spawn and body of a large lobster, or ot two small ones, in a marble mortar; add gradually to it the soup, stirring it till it is as smooth as cream ; let it boil again, and scum it. Cut the tail and claws of the lob- ster into pieces, and add them to the soup before serving it, and also some pepper, cayenne, white pepper, and a glass of white wine. Force-meat balls may be added to oyster soup and lobster soup, made as directed under the article “ Force- Meat for Fish.” Crappet Heads, or Fish Soup. Put on in boiling salt-and-water two haddocks, and the tails, fins, and roes of six; in a quarter of an hour take out the roes and fish ; let the liquor boil for an hour longer, and strain it. When cold, pick all the fish from the bones, and pick out the strings and skin from the roes; peel and chop two onions, put them on the fire in cold water, and when it boils pour oft' the water, half a pound of shortbread in crumbs, two tea-spoonsful of salt, one and a half of white pepper, and one of grated nutmeg. Mince all these ingredients, mix them together thoroughly, a%d bind them with two beaten whites of eggs. Have ready six heads of haddocks, skinned, and the eyes taken out; make up a large ball of the force- meat ; stuff’ the heads, and tie them round with a coarse thread. Boil the liquor; thicken it with flour kneaded in butter; add some parsley, and a little pepper, two ta- ble-spoonsful of mushroom, the same quantity of walnut catsup, and half a pint of white wine. Skin and cut two haddocks in three or four pieces each, and put them with the heads into the stock, and boil them till they are suf- ficiently done, which may be in about a quarter of an hour. 331 THE TRACI'ICE OF COOKERY. Hard biscuit pounded may be used in place of short- bread., when a little fresh butter must be added. If any ot the force-meat is over, make it up in small balls. Water Souchy. Make a stock with three or four flounders, boiled in three quarts of water, two onions, and a bunch of parsley, till they are soft enough to pulp through a sieve with the liquor they were boiled in ; then season it with pepper, salt, and some parsley chopped, and boil in it a few flounders, with the brown skin taken off, some nicely cleaned perch or tench. Serve in a tureen, and with slices of bread and butter to eat with it. Pepper Pot in a Tureen. Stew gently in four quarts of water, till reduced to three, three pounds of beef, half a pound of lean ham, a bunch of dried thyme, two onions, two large potatoes pared and sliced ; then strain it through a cullender, and add a large fowl, cut into joints and skinned, half a pound of pickled pork sliced, the meat of one lobster minced, and some small suet dumplings, the size of a walnut. When the fowl is well boiled, add half a peck of spinach, that has been boiled and rubbed through a cullender; season with salt and cayenne. It is very good without the lean ham and fowl. Soup for the Poor. Wash an ox head very clean; break the bones, and cut the meat in pieces; put it on in thirteen gallons of water, with a peck and a half of potatoes, half a peck of turnips, the same quantity of onions, and some carrots ; peel and cut them all down. A handful of pot herbs, and two quarts of oatmeal; season with pepper and salt. Cover the pot closely, and let it stew till the next morning ; add as much hot water as may have wasted in boiling, letting it stew for some hours longer, when it will be fit for use. This soup will be found very good for a family dinner.32 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Soup for an Invalid. Cut in small pieces one pound of beef or mutton, or part of both ; boil it gently in two quarts of water ; take off the scum, and, when reduced to a pint, strain it. Season with a little salt, and take a tea-cupful at a time. Chicken Panada. Skin a fowl; cut it in pieces, leaving the breast whole ; boil it in three pints of water till perfectly tender; pick off all the meat, and pound it finely in a mortar, and mix it with the liquor it was boiled in ; rub it through a sieve, and season it with salt. Rice and Milk. To every quart of good milk allow two ounces of rice ; wash it well in several waters ; put it with the milk into a closely-covered sauce-pan, and set it over a slow fire ; when it boils take it off; let it stand till it be cold, and simmer it about an hour and a quarter before sending it to table ; and serve it in a tureen. Cream of Rice Soup. Mix one or two table-spoonsful of sifted flour of rice with a little good stock, rather cold than hot; add this to some boiling stock, and keep stirring till it boils ; and let it boil till sufficiently thick. The flour of rice may be made as follows :—Wash in several waters a pound of rice ; wipe it in a clean towel, and when perfectly dry pound and sift it through a sieve. Friars’ Chicken. Put four pounds of a knuckle of veal into four quarts of water ; boil it gently for two hours ; strain it off; cut three chickens, or two young fowls, into joints; skin them, * and when the broth boils put them in ; season with white pepper and salt; let them boil a short time, and add a hand- ful of parsley chopped small ; when the chickens are boiled tender, have ready six or seven well-beaten eggs ; stirTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 33 tliem quickly into tlie broth one way, immediately before taking it off the fire. This broth may be made entirely of veal, instead of chickens. Another Friars’ Chicken. Clean and wash three chickens; skin and cut them into joints; put them, with the livers and gizzards, on in two quarts of cold water ; when it boils skim it; season with salt and white pepper. In half an hour add a hand- ful of chopped parsley, and let it boil for half an hour longer. Beat well the whites and yolks of four or six eggs, and .just before serving stir them very quickly one way into the broth. Portable Soup. Put on, in four gallons of water, ten pounds of a shin of beef, free from fat and skin, six pounds of a knuckle of veal, and two fowls, break the bones and cut the meat into small pieces, season with one ounce of whole black pep- per, quarter of an ounce of Jamaica pepper, and the same of mace, cover the pot very closely, and let it simmer for twelve or fourteen hours, and then strain it. The following day, take oft'the fat, and clear the jelly from any sediment adhering to it; boil it gently upon a stove, without covering the sauce-pan, and stir it frequently till it becomes very thick and in lumps about the pan. Put it into saucers about half full, and when cold lay the cakes upon flannel to dry before the fire or in the sun ; keep them in a tin box, with white paper between each cake. About an ounce weight will make a pint of rich soup ; pour boiling water upon it with a little salt, and stir it till it dissolves. It also answers well for gravies and all brown sauces. Ox Tail Soup. Steep in cold water, for some hours, two ox tails cut in bits ; put them into a sauce-pan with four quarts of cold water, a bunch of sweet herbs, a dessert-spoonful of whole black pepper, three onions, two carrots, and one turnip ; c34 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. cover it closely, and when it boils skim it, and let it sim- mer for three hours ; carefully take off all the fat; add a table-spoonful of vinegar and half a pint of port wine. Take out the vegetables and herbs before serving. Meg Merrilies Soup. Cut a hare in pieces, and save the blood, reserve some bits of the meat and the liver to make forcemeat balls of, and put the rest of the hare into a sauce-pan with six quarts of water; season with four onions, a bunch of sweet herbs, pepper, and salt, stew it gently for two hours ; in another sauce-pan put the blood and the water the hare was washed in, stir in two heaped table-spoonsful of ricd flour, to make it the consistence of gruel, and when it boils mix it with the stock. Take two partridges, or moor-fowl, if they are fresh, or part of both, skin and cut each of them into four pieces, brown them in butter in a frying-pan, and add them to the soup, with about three pints of car- rots and turnips neatly cut and parboiled. Make the forcemeat balls as follows: mince the liver and meat very finely with rather more than half its quantity of fat bacon or butter, one anchovy, a little lemon-peel, and lemon- thyme, pepper and salt, grated nutmeg, and crumbs of bread; make up the balls the size of a nutmeg, with a well-beaten egg, fry them of a light brown in clarified "beef dripping, fresh lard, or butter, drain them before the fire, and add them to the soup half an hour before serving, and pick out all the loose bones of the hare. To Dress a Turtle weighing one hundred and tiventy pounds. Turtle Soup. Having cut off the head close to the shell, hang up the turtle till next day, then open it, bearing the knife heavily on the back of the animal in cutting it off all round ; turn it on its end, that all the water and blood may run out, then cut the flesh off along the spine, sloping the knife towards the bones so as to avoid touching the gall, and havingTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 35 also cut the flesh from the legs and other members, wash the whole well and drain it. A large vessel of boiling water being ready on the fire, put in the breast shell, and when the plates will separate easily, take them out of the water; boil the back and belly in water till the softer parts can be taken off easily; but before they are suffi- ciently done, as they are to be again boiled in the sauce, lay them to cool singly in earthen vessels that they may not stick together, let the bones continue to stew for some time, as the liquor must be used for moistening the sauces. All the flesh cut from the body, the four legs and head must be stewed in the following manner. Lay a few slices of ham on the bottom of a large stew-pan, and over the ham two or three knuckles of veal, then above the veal, the inside flesh of the turtle, and that of the members over the whole, adding a large bunch of sweet herbs, such as sweet basil, sweet marjoram, lemon-thyme, a handful of parsley, and green onions, and a large onion stuck with six cloves. Then partly moisten it with the water in which the shell is boiling, and when it has stewed some time, moisten it again with the liquor in which the back and belly have been boiled. When the legs are tender, take them out, drain, and put them aside to be afterwards added to the sauce ; and when the flesh is completely done, drain it through a silk sieve, and mix with the sauce some very thin white roux; then cut all the softer parts, now sufficiently cold, into pieces about an inch square, add them to the sauce, and let them simmer gen- tly till they can be easily pierced; skim it well. Next chop a small quantity of herbs, and boil them with a little sugar in four bottles of Madeira till reduced to two, then rub it through a tammy, mix it with the turtle sauce, and let it boil for a short time. Make some force-meat balls as follows; cut off about a pound of meat from the fleshy part of a leg of veal free from sinews or fat, soak in milk about the same quantity of crumbs of bread; when quite soft, squeeze and put it into a mortar, together with the veal, a small quantity of calf’s udder, a little butter, the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs, a little cayenne, salt36 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. and spices; pound the whole very finely, then thicken the mixture with two whole eggs and the yolk of a third, throw a bit into boiling water, and if not sufficiently firm, add the yolk of another egg, and for variety some chop- ped parsley may be mixed with half of the forcemeat. Let the whole cool so that it may be formed into balls about the size of the yolk of an egg, poach them in boil- ing water, and add them to the turtle. Before serving, mix a little cayenne with the juice of two or three lemons, and add it to the soup. It is generally preferable to pre- pare the soup the day before it is required for use, and it will be best heated in a water bath, or flat vessel con- taining water, which is kept always very hot, but not al- lowed to boil. By the same method, sauces, stews, and other made dishes may be kept hot. When the fins of the turtle are to be served as a side dish, they must be first parboiled, then skinned, and stewed in a little turtle sauce, with some port wine, and seasoned with cayenne, salt, and a little lemon juice, and thickened with butter and flour. Fricandeaux and Blanquettes may also be made of the flesh of the turtle, in the same way as those of veal.37 TIIE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. CHAPTER II. FISH. PREPARATORY REMARKS ON FISH. Turbot ;—a good one is thick, and the belly cream- coloured. If the belly and fins be streaked with red, it is certainly fresh. When it must be kept, it should be hung up by the tail in a cool place. The same directions apply to soles and flounders. Cod;—when good, has a small head, broad shoulders, and a hollow at the back of the neck, and a small and stiff tail. Salmon, haddocks, mackerel, whiting, herring, and sprats, should all be firm, and chosen with small heads, thick shoulders, and small tails. Smelts ;—when perfectly fresh, smell like a newly-cut cucumber. Carp, tench, pike, and perch ;—when fresh, the eyes are bright, the body stiff, the gills red, and hard to open. The silver eel, so called from the bright colour of the belly, is the most esteemed. Skate ;—the female is the best, and when good is thick, and has a very white belly, tinged with lilac. That with large thorns is a very inferior fish.38 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. A lobster should be rather heavy, in proportion to its size. When in perfection, the shell on the side will not yield to moderate pressure. Barnacles and other marine animals adhering to it are certain indications of superior goodness. If the berries appear large and brownish, it will he found watery and poor. The cock lobster is in general better than the hen, and is distinguished by its narrow tail. Crabs;—the male is the best, and may be known by its narrow breast. When light they are watery ; which may more easily be detected after they are boiled ; by then holding them firmly and shaking them, the rattling of the water will be heard. Prawns and shrimps are good when their tails turn strongly inwards, and when they have no unpleasant smell. When oysters are alive and strong, the shell, in opening them, will close upon the knife. Those from the coast of Kent, and those called Pandore, from the Firth of Forth, are the most esteemed. On Dressing Fish. Fish must by no means be allowed to remain in the water after it is boiled ; if therefore it should be ready before it can be sent to table, it must be dished, the cover put on, and a cloth put over it. The dish is then to be set across the fish-kettle. Fish should be fried over a clear quick fire, and with dripping, or hog’s lard, in preference to butter. The pan should be deep ; and to ascertain that it is clean, a little fat is first fried in it, poured out, and the pan wiped with a clean cloth ; as much dripping or lard is then put in as will entirely cover the fish. When it is boiling hot, and begins to smoke, the fish is put in ; if small, they may be turned in three or four minutes, by sticking in a fork nearTltE PRACTICE OP COOKERY. 39 the head with the one hand, and with the other support- ing the tail with a fish-slice. When they are done, they should be laid before the fire upon an old soft towel, and turned now and then till they are dry upon both sides, or they may be put upon a large sieve, turned upwards, and which is kept for the purpose, or put on the under- side of a dish. The fire for broiling fish must be very clear, and the gridiron perfectly clean, which, when hot, should be rub- bed with a bit of suet. The fish, while broiling, must be often turned. Berwick Receipt for Boiling Salmon. The tail of the salmon is first cut off near and below the last fin, the fish is then cut up the back, keeping the bone on one side, and then cut up into pieces of half a pound each, the blood well washed out of the fish in cold water, but the scales not to be removed ; a pickle to be made of salt and water, strong enough to bear an egg, and, when boiling, the fish to be put in, and boiled very quickly for fifteen minutes. During the boiling, the scum to be taken off carefully as soon as it rises. Sauces ; —lobster, melted butter, and anchovy sauce. N. B. The hardest water is preferable for boiling salmon. A Receipt for Boiling Salmon, by an Aberdeen Fisherman.

When salmon is cut in slices an inch thick, let them boil ten minutes. Serve with it a sauce tureen of the liquor the fish was boiled in. To Broil Salmon Steaks. Cut the steaks from the thickest parts of the fish, nearly an inch thick ; butter pieces of white paper; fold the steaks in them, and broil them over a slow fire four ten or twelve minutes. Take off the paper ; serve and garnish with plenty of fried parsley. Dressed in this way, they may be put round salmon boiled, in slices. Sauces ;—melted butter, lobster, or shrimp sauce.

Clean and cut the fish into slices, put it in a dish, and make the following sauce : Melt an ounce of butter, kneaded in flour, in a pint and a half of gravy, with two glasses of port ivine, two table-spoonsful of catsup, two anchovies, and a little cayenne. When the anchovies are dissolved, strain and pour the sauce over the fish, tie a sheet of buttered paper over the dish, and send it to the oven. Trout answer well dressed in this way. To Stew Salmon. Clean and scrape the fish ; cut it into slices, and stew it in a rich white gravy. A little before serving, add two table-spoonsful of soy, one of essence of anchovy, a little salt, some chopped parsley and chives. Kipper, or Dried Salmon. Cut the fish up the back, and take out the bone; wipe it very clean with a cloth ; score it, and put a hand- ful of salt on each side, and let it lie for three days ; then hang it up to dry, and it will he fit for use in two days, and eats well until a little pepper put over it, and broiled.11 THE PRACTICE OP COOKERY. To Salt a Salmon. Cut the fish up the back, and cut out the bone; wipe it clean, and sprinkle it with salt; let it lie a night to drain off the liquor ; wipe it dry; nib on it two or three ounces of pounded saltpetre ; cut it into pieces ; pack it close in a pot, with a thick layer of salt between each layer of fish. If the brine does not rise in a few days, boil a strong one, and pour it, when cold, upon the sal- mon, which must always be covered with it. The bone, or chine of salmon, as it is called in Leith, eats well with salt and pepper strewed over it, cut in bits of three or four inches, and broiled over a clear fire. Salmon Fritters. Cut small some cold boiled salted salmon ; pound some boiled potatoes, moistened with cream, and the yolk of an egg beaten ; mix them together, and make it into small fritters, and fry them of a light brown in fresh lard, or beef dripping; serve them with hard-boiled eggs, cut , in quarters. For sauce, melt two ounces of butter, with a little cream and flour mixed, and add, when it is hot, a dessert-spoonful of soy, and two of mushroom catsup. Caveacli Salmon. Boil in two quarts of vinegar three heads of shalots, half an ounce of whole black pepper, three cloves, two blades of mace, and a little salt. Fry the fish, cut in slices, of a light-brown colour in fine oil, or clarified dripping; put them, when cold, into a pan, pour over the vinegar and spices, and put on the top eight or ten spoonsful of oil. Soles may be done in this way, only lay over them sliced onions instead of shalots. To Pot Salmon. Take off the head ; cut the salmon in thick slices; wipe it dry, but do not wash it; pound half an ounce of nutmeg, mace, and cloves, the least part of cloves, half42 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. an ounce of white pepper, and some salt; chop fine one onion, six bay leaves, and six anchovies; season each slice ; put it into a pan, with very thin slices of butter be- tween each layer; bake it, when well done ; drain off the butter, and, when cold, pour over some clarified butter. Spiced Salmon. Mix together, in the proportion of one-third of salt- and-water to one pint of vinegar, one ounce of whole black pepper, and one ounce of cinnamon. Cut the sal- mon into slices, and boil it in this; when cold, pack it close in a pan, and pour over it the liquor it was boiled in, with the spices, so as to cover it completely; cover the pan closely, to exclude the air. Pickled Salmon. Cut the salmon into pieces; boil it as for eating, and lay it on a dry cloth till the following day; boil two quarts of good vinegar with one of the liquor the fish was boiled in, one ounce of whole black pepper, half an ounce of allspice, and four blades of mace. Put the salmon into something deep, and pour over it the prepared vinegar when cold. A little sweet oil put upon the top will make it keep a twelvemonth. Another Pickled Salmon. To a quart of the liquor the fish has been boiled in, put rather more than half a pint of good vinegar, and half an ounce of whole black pepper; boil it, and when it is cold pour it over the fish, previously laid in a deep dish. To Boil Turbot. Put into the turbot kettle, with the water, two large handsful of salt, and a tea-cupful of vinegar; when it boils very fast, take off the scum ; put in the turbot, and when it boils again keep it boiling fast till the turbot rises from the drainer; when it is sufficiently done, dish and13 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. garnish it with a fringe of curled parsley and cut lemon. Sauces;—lobster and melted butter. Cold boiled turbot eats well until salad sauce. Turbot is generally considered best perfectly fresh; but some people prefer it kept for a few days, hung up by the tail in a cool place. To Boil a Cod’s Head and Shoulders. Wash it clean; tie it up, and dry it with a cloth. Allow, in the proportion of every three measures of water, one of salt; when it boils take off the scum ; put in the fish, and keep it boiling very fast for twenty-five or thirty minutes. Serve with the roe and milt parboiled, cut into slices, and fried, and garnish with curled parsley and horse-radish. Sauces;—oyster, melted butter, or anchovy and butter. To Dress a Cod’s Head and Shoulders. Wash the cod’s head and shoulders well; cut off the fins ; lay it on a dish ; pour some boiling water over part of the fish, and instantly scrape off all the black scales, taking care not to break the skin ; repeat this till every part of the fish looks white, and then wash it in cold water. Put it on in boiling salt-and-water, and boil it for a quar- ter of an hour ; then lay it on a dish, and rub it all over with the yolks of two or three eggs beaten, and strew it thickly with grated bread crumbs, mixed with pepper and minced parsley. Stick it all over with little bits of but- ter, and put it in an oven to brown. Mix a large table- spoonful of flour with a quarter of a pound of butter, a quart of gravy, a tea-cupful of white wine, some pepper, salt, and a little grated nutmeg. Mince the white meat of a lobster ; slightly brown three dozen of oysters in a frying-pan, and put them with half their liquor and the lobster to the gravy, and other things; heat it up, and pour it round the fish. Garnish with cut lemon. It is not necessary to have lobster and oysters, but it is the better for both. To dress the same dish with a white sauce, the stockTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 44 should be made of veal, or an old fowl, and seasoned with white pepper and mace. Another way to Dress a Cod’s Head and Shoulders. Parboil the head and shoulders ; drain and put it on in some rich gravy, made with meat and fish; season it with pepper and salt, a little mace, one or two onions chopped, two table spoonsful of catsup. Any other sea- soning may be added, such as coratcb, anchovy, and le- mon pickle. Care must be taken not to let it boil too long. A few minutes before serving, mix smooth in a little cold water two table-spoonsful of flour. Haddocks may he dressed in the same manner. To Bake Cod, or Haddock. Take the middle piece of the fish, and skin it; make a stuffing with a little of the roe parboiled, a piece of butter, the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, some grated bread crumbs, pepper, salt, grated lemon peel, and nut- meg ; hind it with the beaten white of an egg ; put it into the fish, and sew it up. Place the whole in a tin dish, with hits of butter over the top of it, and bake it for an hour in a Dutch oven ; turn and haste it frequently. Garnish with fried roe, or oysters. Sauces ;—melted butter, oyster, or shrimp sauce. To Crimp Cod. Cut a fresh cod into slices or steaks ; lay them for three hours in salt-and-water, and a glass of vinegar ; when they may he boiled, fried, or broiled. To Dress and keep Dry Salted Tusk, Ling, or Cod Fish. Cut in square bits, or put one large piece in cold wa- ter over night; wash it clean in fresh water, and put it on to boil in cold for one hour and a half; then cool the water, so that the fish may be easily handled ; take it out of the sauce-pan, and pick out the loose bones, and scrape45 TIIE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. it clean, without taking off the skin. Put it on in boil- ing water; and if the fish is too fresh, add a little salt with it, and let it boil gently from one hour to one and a half. The very thick part will take this time, the thin bits less, to dress. When dished, garnish with hard- boiled eggs and parsley. Plain boiled parsnips, and a butter tureen of egg sauce, served with it. When the fish is put on the second time, some people prefer boiling it in milk-and-water. To keep any of this sort of fish for winter use, it ought to be cut or sawed in pieces, and when perfectly dry laid in a small cask or wooden box, with oatmeal, oatmeal seeds, or malt dust, between each layer. Dried Fisli Pudding. Boil the fish, take off the skin, and take out the bones, pound it, and add to it an equal quantity of mashed po- tatoes moistened with good milk and a bit of butter; put it in a dish, smooth it with a knife, and stick here and there little bits of butter, and brown it in a Dutch oven; serve it with egg sauce. Barrelled Cod Fish. To a barrel that will contain four or five fish allow three pounds of salt, and a quarter of a pound of sugar, thoroughly mixed; split the fish, wash and clean them extremely well, and let the water drain from them ; strew over the mixed salt and sugar, and pack them into the barrel, with the skin side down, till the last fish, which put with the skin side up. Cod Sounds Roasted or Baked. Wash and clean four or five cod sounds, and boil them till nearly done in milk and water; when cold, make a forcemeat of bread crumbs; a piece of butter, salt, nutmeg, white pepper, and some chopped oysters; beat up the yolks of two eggs to bind it, lay it over the sounds, roll them up, and fasten with a small skewer,THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 46 baste them with melted butter, and roll them in finely grated bread crumbs seasoned with pepper and salt; put them on a tin in a Dutch oven, turn and baste them with a feather dipped in melted butter, and strew over bread crumbs as before ; when done, and of a nice brown, serve them with oyster sauce in the dish. Cod Sounds Broiled. Let them lie in boiling water till it is nearly cold, rub them with salt, and pull off the black and dirty skin, boil them in hot water, drain, and dust them with flour, rub them over with butter, season with white pepper and salt, and broil them. Put a table^poonful of catsup, half a one of soy, and a little cayenne, into melted butter, heat and pour it over them. Cod Sounds Fricasseed. When cleaned as above, boil them in milk-and-water, drain and put them into a sauce-pan with some white stock seasoned with mace, salt, and white pepper; thicken it with a bit of butter kneaded in flour, and just before serving, stir in a table-spoonful of lemon pickle ; garnish with sippets of thin toasted bread. To Crimp Skate. Skin the skate on both sides, cut it an inch and a half broad, and as long as the skate, roll up each piece and tie it with a thread ; lay them for three hours in salt and water, and a little vinegar; boil them fifteen minutes in boiling salt and water; before serving cut of!' the threads. Sauces, shrimp, butter, and anchovy. When skate are very small, they are preferable broiled. Large Skate dressed like Veal Cutlets. Crimp, or cut the skate in square pieces, roll them in beaten eggs, and then in grated bread mixed with chop- ped parsley, pepper, and salt; fry them of a nice brown colour, anti serve with a rich brown gravy.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 47 Stewed Skate. Skin the skate and cut it into square pieces, and brown it with butter in a frying-pan; make a rich sauce with the skin and parings, to be boiled in three pints of water, witli an onion, some pepper and salt; strain and thicken it with a little butter mixed with flour, add some very finely chopped parsley, and chives; of hot vinegar, mush- room catsup, and Harvey sauce, a table-spoonful each, and a little cayenne ; boil it up and put in the skate five minutes before serving it. Dressed Skate. Cut the skate into pieces, make a stock of the skin and fins with a haddock or a bit of veal, the shell of a lobster or crab washed, two or three onions, and a bunch of sweet herbs; boil it one hour, strain, and thicken it with flour and butter browned, a little soy, catsup, and a glass of white wine, some salt, and pepper; put in the skate, sim- mer it a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and serve it as a side dish or as soup, when a few oyster loaves may be put in the tureen. To Fry Small Skate. Clean, wash, and lay them one or two hours in vine- gar, or vinegar and water, with a sliced onion, some chop- ped parsley, pepper, and salt; drain and dry them well, dip them into beaten eggs, dredge them with flour, and fry them of a fine brown colour; garnish with fried pars- ley. Sauces;—melted butter, and shrimp sauce. To Clean and Prepare Skate for Keeping. Wash them thoroughly, and rub them over with a handful of salt, rinse them, cut off the tail, and pare off the fins all round, hang them upon a fish hake in the open air, and they will keep good for several days. Boiled Carp. Scale and clean a brace of carp, reserving the liverTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 48 and roe ; take half a pint of vinegar, or a quart of sharp cider, add as much water as will cover the fish, a piece of horse-radish, an onion cut into slices, a little salt, and a faggot of sweet herbs ; boil the fish in this liquor; and make a sauce as follows : strain some of the liquor the fish has been boiled in, and put to it the liver minced, a pint of port-wine, two anchovies, two or three heads of shalots chopped, some salt and black pepper, a little cayenne, a table-spoonful of soy ; boil and strain it, thicken it with flour and butter, pour it over the carp hot, garnish with the roe fried, cut lemon and parsley. To Stew Carp. Scale and clean a brace of carp, reserving the liver and roe; pour over the fish in a deep pan a pint of vinegar, which maybe elder vinegar, if the flavour is preferred, with a little mace, three cloves, some salt and Jamaica pepper, two onions sliced, a faggot of parsley, basil, thyme, and marjoram; let them soak an hour, then put them in a stew- pan with the vinegar, and other things, the liver chopped, a pint of Madeira, and three pints of veal stock; stew them an hour or two, according to their size ; takeout the fish and put them over a pan of hot water to keep warm while the following sauce is made: Strain the liquor, and add the yolks of three eggs beaten, half a pint of cream, a large spoonful of flour, and a quarter of a pound of butter, stir it constantly, and just before putting it over the carp, squeeze in the juice of a lemon. Boil or fry the roe. Plain boiled carp may be served with this sauce, and is dished in a napkin. Another way to Stew Carp. Clean a brace of carp, save the blood and roes ; fry the fish in fresh lard slightly; mix the blood well with some cold highly seasoned beef or mutton stock, strain it, and add as much port-wine as there is broth ; when it boils, put in the fish, which must be covered with the liquor, let them stew gently till sufficiently done; take them out, and keep them hot before the fire ; put to the liquor two 1THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 49 table spoonsful of catsup, and the same of lemon pickle, and thicken it with a bit of butter kneaded in a table- spoonful of flour, boil it up and pour it over the carp ; garnish the dish with the roes fried, and sippets of fried bread. Fish Pudding. Bone and skin two raw fresh haddocks, pound them in a marble mortar, and rub through a hair sieve; then put the fish again into the mortar with two eggs, a little parsley, and an onion, cut small, some white pepper and salt, a slice of bread in crumbs, a quarter of a pound of veal suet, or marrow. Pound all well together, put it into a shape, and boil it an hour. Sauce for the Fish Pudding. Make a sauce with brown soup, in which boil the heads and fins of the haddocks, strain and thicken it with a little butter mixed with flour, and just before taking it off the fire add a tea-spoonful of anchovy sauce, and the same of essence of lobster, and of Harvey sauce ; let it boil, and pour it round the pudding. Little Fisli Puddings. Bone and skin two haddocks, pound them smooth. Boil the same quantity of bread and milk as there is fish, with a little parsley, mix it with the fish, and rub it through a sieve; put in two eggs and the yolk of a third, some salt and pepper; stir them very well together, and add the white of the third egg well beaten ; roll them into the form of small sausages, flour and boil them fifteen minutes in boiling salt-and-water. Idave ready the follow- ing brown sauce to serve in the disli with them. In a pint and a half of water boil the heads, fins, and bones of the haddocks, with a bunch of parsley, an onion, salt, pep- per, and a bit of toasted bread ; when it has boiled nearly an hour, strain it, and thicken it with flour and butter; add a table-spoonful of catsup, half a one of soy, and a little cayenne. D50 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. White Fisli and Sauce. Make a rich gravy with a hit of veal, the heads and fins of four or five haddocks, three or four onions, some parsley, a little cayenne, black pepper and salt, the juice of a lemon, half the peel, a table-spoonful of catsup, half a pint of white wine, and two quarts of water; simmer them for an hour, strain, and put to it the meat of a lob- ster or crab minced, and forcemeat balls ; thicken it with half a pint of cream, the yolks of three eggs beaten, and a bit of butter kneaded in Hour. Have ready boiled three haddocks skinned and without their heads, pour the sauce over them in a deep dish. Make the forcemeat balls of a small boiled haddock finely minced, grated bread crumbs, butter, pepper, salt, grated nutmeg, and parsley ; bind them with the whites of two eggs beaten, and fry them in fresh lard of a light brown. Brown Fisli and Sauce. Wash them clean, take off the heads, skin and cut them into two or three pieces ; boil the heads and fins in water, with a large onion cut small, for half an hour; strain it, and add some brown gravy soup ; brown four ounces of butter kneaded well with two table-spoonsful of flour; add it to the liquor, with the peel of half a lemon, two blades of mace, some salt and pepper. Boil all these, and having put in the pieces of fish, let them boil fifteen mi- nutes, and add, just before dishing, a glass of white wine, and a little mushroom catsup and soy. Pick out the lemon peel and mace. Another Fish and Sauce with White Sauce. Prepare the fish as in the receipt for brown fish and sauce, substituting veal broth for the gravy soup, and add- ing minced parsley with the onions ; omit the catsup and soy, and do not brown the butter. It will improve the fish to soak them for half an hour in sour beer, or vine- gar and water; more particularly whitings, which maybe dressed as the haddocks, and the sauce enriched by just51 TIIE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. adding, before serving, two yolks of eggs beat up in three spoonsful of cream, after which the sauce must not be allowed to boil. The stock is frequently made without meat. To Clean and Prepare Haddocks for Keeping. Scrape them and take out the entrails ; cut them open considerably below the vent, so that the blood may be entirely scraped from the back bone ; cut off the points of the tails, take out the eyes and gills, wash the fish, and put some salt into the bodies ; let them lie till next day, then place them upon a fish hake, or a wooden rod put through the eyes, and hang them up in a cool place in the open air. They may be boiled or broiled, taking oft' the heads and skin. To Boil Fresli Haddocks. Clean them as above directed, take off the heads and skin ; when the water boils up, throw in two large hand- fuls of salt; put in the haddocks, boil them as fast as pos- sible till they rise to the surface of the water, which will be from ten to fifteen minutes, according to their size ; take off the scum as it rises. Sauces ;—melted butter, and oyster sauce. Baked Haddocks. Make a pint and a half of gravy with the heads and trimmings of three haddocks, one onion, some parsley, salt, pepper, and two anchovies cut small; strain and heat it again with an ounce of butter kneaded in a table-spoon- ful of floui’, add two of catsup, one of vinegar, one of soy, and a small tea-cupful of white wine ; have the fish ready skinned and cut into pieces ; lay them into a deep dish, pour over the sauce, and bake them in an oven. Another way to Bake Haddocks. Wash and scrape off the scales of three large fine haddocks, leaving on the heads; make a sauce with the heads of some haddocks, two onions sliced, a bunch of parsley, and season it with pepper and salt; boil in this a52 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. small haddock, strain it, and then make a stuffing with the boiled fish picked from the bones, a few bread crumbs, chopped parsley, and some butter, and season it with salt and pepper; stuff the haddocks, and put them with the sauce into a deep dish, and bake them. A pie is made in the same tvay, taking off the skin and the heads of the fish, cutting them in two, and adding a glass of white wine. Another way to Bake Haddocks. Clean, skin, and take off the heads of three good-sized haddocks ; season grated bread crumbs with pepper, salt, and finely minced parsley ; strew some over the bottom of a dish, put in the fish, and strew more seasoned bread crumbs all over, then put a little bit of butter here and there, and pour in as much gravy or water as the dish will hold. They will take an hour to bake, and when they begin to look brown, strew over a few more bread crumbs, seasoned as at first. To Fry Small Fresh Haddocks. Clean and scrape off the scales; cut off’ the fins and tails, the heads may be taken off or not, wipe them dry, rub them over with the yolk of an egg beaten, and dust them with flour; fry them in boiling lard or beef drip- ping, when one side is of a brown colour, turn them, and when done, lay them upon the back of a sieve before the fire to drain ; garnish writh fried parsley. Another way to Fry Haddocks. When perfectly fresh, take off the heads and skins, and cut out the bones very carefully; divide each side in two, wash them well, and lay them in a cloth to dry ; have the yolk of an egg be.at up in a plate, dip the fish into it, and strew over sifted bread crumbs mixed with chopped parsley that has been boiled, and fry them in fresh beef dripping or lard ; garnish the dish with fried parsley. Haddocks dressed in this way make a nice garnish for boiled cod fish, or plain boiled haddocks.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 53 To Fry Haddocks in Sauce. Skin and cut oft’ the heads of three or four haddocks, divide eacli into four pieces, wash them clean. Put a large table-spoonful of butter, with two spoonsful of Hour into a frying-pan, and brown it; mince small two onions and put pepper and salt upon them, and add them to the browned butter, and pour in as much boiling water as will nearly cover the pieces of fish ; let it boil, put in the fish, and when one side is done, turn the other ; dish it hot, and pour the sauce over ; garnish with parsley. Omit the onions if the flavour is not liked, and substitute a ta* ble-spoonful of mushroom catsup, and one of lemon pickle. Finnan or Aberdeen Haddocks. Clean the haddocks thoroughly, and split them, take off’ the heads, put some salt on them, and let them lie two hours, or all night, if they are required to keep more than a week ; then, having hung them two or three hours in the open air to dry, smoke them in a chimney over peat or hardwood saw-dust. Where there is not a chimney suitable for the purpose, they may be done in an old cask open at both ends, into which put some saw-dust with a red-hot iron in the midst; place rods of wood across the top of the cask, tie the had- docks by the tail in pairs, and hang them on the sticks to smoke; the heat should be kept as equal as possible, as it spoils the fish to get alternately hot and cold ; when done, they should be of a fine yellow colour, which they should acquire in twelve hours at furthest. When they are to be dressed, the skin must be taken off. They may be boiled, or broiled; and are generally used for breakfast. To Fry Whiting. Scrape off the scales and cut off the fins, wipe them dry with a clean cloth ; dredge them with flour, or heat up the yolk of an egg, and with a feather rub them over with it, and sprinkle them with finely grated bread crumbs.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 54 Fry them of a nice brown in boiling fresh lard or drip- ping. If small and used as a garnish, they should be curled. To broil them, they are previously prepared in the same way. If boiled, the gut is drawn out, but they must not be washed. To Boil Mackerel. Clean them well, and let them lie in vinegar and wa- ter for a short time, put them on in boiling salt-and-wa- ter for a quarter of an hour. Serve garnished with fennel. Sauces;—fennel and butter, and green gooseberry sauce. To souse them ; put in the proportion of half a pint of vinegar to a quart of the liquor the fish has been boiled in, half an ounce of whole black pepper, a little mace, two or three bay leaves ; and when cold, cover the mack- erel completely with it; pick out the bay leaves. To Broil Mackerel. Clean and split them open, wipe them dry, rub them over with butter, and sprinkle them with pepper and salt. To Bake Mackerel. Clean them ; cut off the heads and tails ; put them into a deep dish, and pour over equal quantities of water and vinegar, some whole black pepper, a little mace, salt, and one or two bay leaves, and a small quantity of port wine ; tie over the dish a sheet of thick white paper but- tered. Another way is, to season them with pepper, salt, and a little mace, all finely powdered ; put bits of butter into the bottom of the dish, and a little more butter upon the mackerel. They may be eaten hot or cold, if cold, with vinegar. If hot, serve with parsley and butter ; and melt- ed butter with catsup and soy. Caveacli Mackerel. Clean and cut each mackerel into four or five pieces ;THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 55 to six large-sized fish, pound and mix well together one ounce of black pepper, three nutmegs, six blades of mace, and a handful of salt; rub each bit of fish extremely well with the spices, and fry them brown in oil; when they are cold, put them into a jar ; fill it up with the best vine- gar, and pour oil upon the surface; tie it down closely. They are best to be done in the height of the season, and will keep good a twelvemonth, if not opened too soon, and answer well for a winter or spring dish. To Fry Herrings. Scrape off the scales ; cut off the fins ; draw out the gut, keeping in the roes and milts ; wipe them in a clean cloth ; dredge them with flour, and fry them in boiling dripping ; put them before the fire to drain and keep hot. Sauces;—melted butter, and parsley and butter. When herrings are to be broiled, they are prepared in the same manner, and done upon the gridiron. They must not be washed. Red Herrings. Plain broil them, or pour over some beer made hot, and when it is cold drain and wipe them dry ; heat them thoroughly, and rub over a little butter, and sprinkle them with pepper. To Bake Herrings. They must be perfectly fresh, and well cleaned, but not washed ; the heads and fins cut off, and the bones cut out; strew over them pepper, salt, and a slice of onion minced very finely, to each ; roll them up tight; pack them into ajar, and pour over in the proportion of a pint of vine- gar to two of water, with half an ounce of whole black pepper ; tie over the jar a piece of bladder or paper, and bake them in an oven for an hour. Take off the cover when they are cold, and pour over a little cold vinegar, and tie them up.5G THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Soft Roes of Herrings in Cases. Rub butter over a round or square paper-case ; its size must be according to the dish it is to be served in. Boil eight very fresh, soft-roed herrings ; when done, take out the roes carefully, and put them whole into the case; sprinkle them over with a little pepper, salt, grated bread, and finely-dropped parsley. Put some little bits of but- ter here and there upon them, and bake them in a hot oven. When done, put a little “ Maitre d’ Hotel Sauce Maigre” into the case, with the juice of a lemon. Serve them quite hot and firm. To Salt Herrings. Cut them open carefully, separating the guts from the milts and roes ; throw away the milts, and leave the roes in the fish; wash them, and then put them into a brine, strong enough to bear an egg ; let them lie in that from twelve to sixteen hours ; take them out and drain them well. In the bottom of a keg or jar, strew a good deal of salt; lay a row of herrings, and then sprinkle over more salt, and repeat this till all are packed. Cover the top with salt, and stop it very closely, to exclude the air. When to be dressed, put them on in cold water, and when it boils let them boil for ten minutes. Serve them with mashed potatoes. To Smoke Herrings. Lay them in salt and a little saltpetre for ten or twelve hours, and follow the same directions as for smoking Finnan Haddocks.—See page 53. To Broil Sprats. Clean them well; dredge them slightly with flour, and put them in rows upon small skewers run through the heads ; or they may be fried like herrings, and served hot and hot. Sauce ;—melted butter, with catsup, soy, and lemon pickle, a spoonful of each in it.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 57 To Bake Sprats. Clean them ; take off the heads ; put them into a deep dish, and cover them with vinegar and water, equal quan- * tities of each. To a quart of liquid, put half an ounce of whole black pepper, a little allspice, two or three bay leaves, some salt, and an onion. 'Fie paper over the dish, and bake them in a cool oven, or do them over a slow lire in a water bath. Herrings may be done in this way. Both will keep good some weeks. To Fry Smelts. This delicate little fish, when perfectly fresh, must not be washed, but wiped with a clean cloth, and dredged with flour, or brushed over with a feather, dipped into the yolk of an egg beaten, and rolled in a plate of finely- grated bread-crumbs, and fried in boiling dripping, or fresh lard. They vary in size, and some will be done sooner than others. When of a clear yellow brown, take them out carefully, and lay them before the fire upon the back of a sieve to drain and keep hot. Dish them, heads and tails alternately. Garnish with fried parsley. Sauce ; —melted butter. They may also be broiled. To Fry Soles. Take off the brown skin, and scrape the other side; well wash, wipe, and lay them in a clean cloth to dry; beat up in a plate the yolks of one or two eggs; take the fish by the eyes, and draw them through the eggs, then sprinkle them over with finely-grated bread-crumbs on both sides, never touching the fish but by the eyes ; or they may be dredged with Hour ; slip them into a frying- pan full of boiling fresh lard, or good dripping; when they become of a clear yellow brown, lay them carefully upon the back of a sieve or cloth before the fire. Serve them with plenty of fried parsley. Sauces ;—shrimp sauce and melted butter.58 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. To Boil Soles, Brill, or any otlier Flat Fish. Clean them, cut off their fins, and put them on in boiling salt and water, and let it boil fast till the fish rises to the surface, when they will be done enough. Sauce ;—anchovy, and shrimp sauce. To Boil Trout. Clean and gut them ; make the water as salt as for boiling salmon in, and when it boils put in the trout, and let them boil fast from fifteen to twenty minutes, accord- ing to their size. Sauce ;—melted butter. To Fry Trout. Cut off the fins, clean, and gut them ; dust them with flour, and dip them into the yolk of an egg beaten ; strew grated bread-crumbs over, and fry them in fresh dripping ; lay them upon the back of a sieve before the fire to drain. Sauce ;—melted butter, with a table-spoonful of catsup, and one of lemon pickle in it. When they are small, roll them in oatmeal before they are fried. To Broil Trout. Cut off the fins, and cut the fish down the back, close to the bone, and split the head in two. Another way is, after they have been cut open, to rub a little salt over them ; let them lie three or four hours, and then hang them up in the kitchen. They will be ready to broil the next morning for breakfast. To Collar Trout. Wash them clean, split them down the back, bone and dry them well in a cloth ; season them well with finely- pounded black pepper, salt, and mace ; roll them tight, and lay them close into a dish ; pour over an equal quantity of vinegar and beer, with two or three bay leaves, and some whole black pepper ; tie over the dish a sheet of buttered paper, and bake them an hour.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 59 To Pot Trout or Grilse. Mix together the following quantity of finely-pounded spices :—One ounce of cloves, half an ounce of Jamaica pepper, quarter of an ounce of black pepper, quarter of an ounce of cayenne, two nutmegs, a little mace, and two tea-spoonsful of ginger ; add the weight of the spices, and half as much again of salt, and mix all thoroughly. Clean the fish, and cut off the heads, fins, and tails ; put a tea- spoonful of the mixed spices into each fish, and lay them into a deep earthen jar, with the backs downwards ; cover them with clarified butter, tie a paper over the mouth of the jar, and bake them slotvly for eight hours. When the back bone is tender, the fish are done enough. Take them out of the jar, and put them into a milk-pan with the backs upwards ; cover them w'ith a board, and place upon it a heavy weight. When perfectly cold, remove the fish into fresh jars, smooth them with a knife, and cover them tvith clarified butter. To Broil Fresh Sturgeon. Cut it into cutlets ; rub them with the yolk of an egg beat up ; strew them over with some parsley, minced very fine, and mixed with grated bread-crumbs, pepper, and salt; put them into pieces of white paper buttered, and broil them gently. Sauces ;—oyster, melted butter and anchovy. Sour Krout with Pike. When the krout is boiled, clean a large pike, scrape and cut it into neat pieces, dip them into the beaten yolk of an egg, then into bread crumbs, and fry them of a nice brown ; rub some butter upon a dish, and put into it a layer of krout, and some grated cheese, then a layer of pike, and a little sour cream; then krout, and so on till the dish be full. On the top put some bits of butter, and some good broth or gravy; strew crumbs of bread thickly over it, and bake it half an hour.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 60 To Boil Pike. Wash clean, and take out the gills ; stuff them with the following forcemeat: equal parts of chopped oysters, grated bread crumbs, beef suet, or butter, two anchovies, a little onion, pepper, salt, nutmeg, minced parsley, sweet marjoram, thyme, and savoury; an egg to bind it. Stuff the insides, and sew them up ; put them on in boiling salt-and-water, with a glass of vinegar, and let them boil for half an hour. Sauces;—oyster, and melted butter. They may also be broiled. Baked Pike. Scrape the scales off a large pike, take out the gills, and clean it, without breaking the skin ; stud' the fish with a forcemeat made of two handfuls of grated bread, one of finely-minced suet, some chopped parsley, and a little fresh .butter, seasoned with pepper, salt, mace, gra- ted lemon-peel and nutmeg, pounded all together in a mortar, with two whole eggs. Fasten the tail of the pike into its mouth with a skewer, and then dip it, first into a well-beaten egg, and then into grated bread, which repeat twice ; baste it over with butter, and bake it in an oven. If two of them are to be served, make one of them of a green colour, by mixing a quantity of finely-minced parsley with the grated bread. When the fish is of a fine brown colour, cover it with paper until it is done. Serve with a Dutch sauce in a sauce-tureen. Maids. They are the better for being hung up for a day, and may be fried like soles, or, if large, boil the middle part, and fry the fins to put round. Serve with shrimp sauce. To Broil Perch. Scrape, gut, and wash them ; dry them in a cloth, dust them with flour, and broil them. Sauce, melted butter. Or they may be broiled without gutting them.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 61 When they are to be boiled, follow the directions for boiling haddocks, at page 51. They may also be stewed as carp are done. To Pot Perch. Clean the fish, take oft’ the head and skin, and sea- son them with a little pounded mace, and some salt; put them into a pan with some butter, and bake them two hours ; drain off the butter, take out the back bone, and strew over the fish a little pounded cinnamon and grated nutmeg. Keep them in a pan with clarified butter pour- ed over them. Red Mullet. Scrape and wash them, fold them in buttered paper, lay them into a dish, and bake them gently. The liquor that comes from them, boil with a piece of butter, dusted with flour, a tea-spoonful of soy, two of essence of an- chovy, and a little white wine. Serve the sauce in a butter-tureen. This fish is called the sea woodcock, from being dress- ed with the inside. To Boil Eels. Small ones are preferable; clean them well, skin, wash, and cut off the heads. Curl and put them on in boiling salt-and-water, with a little vinegar. Garnish with parsley. Sauce; — parsley and butter. To Fry Eels. Clean them as before directed, cut them into pieces of three or four inches long, and then score across in two or three places ; season them with pepper and salt, and dust them with flour, or dip them into an egg beat up, and sprinkle them with finely-grated bread crumbs; fry them in fresh lard or dripping. Let them drain and dry upon the back of a sieve before the fire. Garnish with par- sley. Sauce ;—melted butter and lemon pickle. If small, they may be curled and fried whole.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY". 62 To Spitchcock Eels. Clean and skin the eels, large ones are best for this purpose; cut them into pieces of three or four inches long, score and sprinkle them with pepper and salt, dip them into an egg beat up, and then into grated bread crumbs, mixed with chopped parsley, and seasoned with pepper, salt, and nutmeg ; rub the gridiron with a bit of suet, and broil them over a clear fire, or they may be fried. Sauces ; —■lemon pickle and catsup, in melted butter, or parsley and butter. To Collar Eels. Clean and skin them, take out the bones, and cut oft' the heads and tails ; lay them flat, and strew over plenty of the following seasoning : grated nutmeg, grated lemon- peel, some salt and pepper, minced parsley, sweet mar- joram, a little thyme, savoury, and a leaf or two of sage ; roll them very tight, and bind them firmly with tape ; boil the heads, tails, and bones, in two quarts of water, and one pint of vinegar or cider, with one onion, three bay leaves, some salt and pepper ; when it boils, put in the collars, and when tender take them out, and boil the liquor a little longer; strain and skim it, and when cold put in the fish. If the fish is to be kept long, it will be necessary to boil up the liquor, occasionally adding a little fresh vinegar. To Pot Eels. Clean, skin, and bone them ; season them well upon both sides with pepper, salt, a little mace, and Jamaica pepper; let them lie for six hours, then cut them into small pieces, and pack them close into a dish ; cover them with a coarse paste, and bake them. When quite cold, take off the paste, and pour over them clarified butter. Stewed Eels. Clean and skin the eels, wipe them dry, and cut them into pieces about four inches long; take two onions, twoTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 63 shalots, a bunch of parsley, thyme, two bay leaves, a lit- tle mace, black and Jamaica pepper, a pint of good gravy, the same of port wine, and the same of vinegar, six an- chovies bruised ; let all boil together for ten minutes ; take out the eels ; boil the sauce till reduced to a quart; strain and thicken it with a table-spoonful of flour, mixed smooth in a little cold water. Put in the eels, and boil them till they are tender. Eels may also be roasted with a common stuffing. Another way to Stew Eels. After the eels are cleaned and skinned, cut them into pieces, season well two pounds and a half with salt and black pepper, put an ounce of butter into a stew-pan with a large handful of sorrel, three or four sage leaves, half an onion cut small, a little grated lemon peel, and one anchovy chopped ; put in the eels and pour over half a pint of water, stew them gently for half an hour, shaking them occasionally; before serving, add a little grated nutmeg, and the juice of half a lemon. To Stew Lampreys. Clean them well with salt and warm water, and re- move the cartilage which runs down the back, season them with black and Jamaica pepper, grated nutmeg, two or three cloves and some salt; stew them till tender in equal parts of port wine and water, with some horse-ra- dish and an onion ; strain and thicken the liquor with flour and butter, and add a table-spoonful of lemon pickin' and one of mushroom catsup ; heat it, and pour it hot over the lampreys. Eels may be stewed in this way, keeping on the skins, curling and first frying them of a good brown. Fish Soup Cake. Pick free from bones and skin any cold boiled white fish, weigh it, and add one third of grated bread crumbs, a little cold melted butter, a small onion minced very fine,61 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. some pepper and salt, and the whites of two eggs to bind it; mix it well together, and make it up into the form of a thick cake the size of the dish it is to be sent to ta- ble in, and fry it on both sides a nice brown ; then stew it in a gravy made of weak stock, and the fish bones boil- ed in it, with an onion, pepper, and salt; thicken the sauce with a little flour and water, and add a dessert- spoonful of mushroom catsup, and one of soy. Veal, beef, or mutton, dressed in this way, is very good. After pike, cod, skate, turbot, soles, or any other white fish has been dressed, pick it from the bones into small bits ; add to a pound of fish, or in the same propor- tion, half a pint of good cream, one table-spoonful of mus- tard, the same of anchovy essence, the same of catsup, and of Harvey sauce, a little flour, some salt, pepper, and butter ; make it all hot in a sauce-pan, then put it into the dish in which it is to be served up, strew crumbs of bread over it, and baste it with butter till it is a little moist, then brown it with a salamander, or in a Dutch oven. A wall of mashed potatoes round the dish is an im- provement. Another way to make Fisli Rechauffe. Pick from the bone in large flakes about two pounds of cold salmon, cod fish, or soles ; melt a quarter of a pound of butter in half a pint of cream, with a little flour and salt; add the fish, and heat it thoroughly. Tie the claws with a bit of twine, and put them on in boiling water, boil them for twenty minutes, or half an hour, accordingJro the size ; rub them over with a small bit of butter, ’ 1 ' laws to drain till they become Fish Rechauffe.

Cutlets of Lobster, Crab, or Oyster. Pick out carefully all the meat of a large lobster, mince it, and add it to two ounces of butter, which has been browned with two table-spoonsful of flour, and seasoned with a little white pepper, salt, and cayenne ; add about half a pint of strong stock, stir it over the fire till it is quite hot; put it in separate table-spoonsful upon a large dish. When cold, make them up into the form of mutton cutlets, brush over them the beaten yolks of eggs, dip them into grated bread, and fry them of a light brown colour, in boiling clarified beef dripping. Stick into the narrow end of the cutlet a bit of a small claw, about an inch long; place the cutlets round the dish, one a little over the other, and lay fried parsley in the centre of the dish. Instead of the claw, a bit of stick may be put into the end of the oyster cutlet. Bradu Fagadu. Pick the meat out of a lobster, cut it into small bits, season it with two table-spoonsful of currie powder, some salt, and a little cayenne. Well wash and pick a quan- tity of spinach sufficient for a dish, half stew it, closely covered, without any water; then strain off the liquor from it, and add the lobster to it, with a large piece of butter ; cover the stew-pan, and let it stew a quarter of an hour.67 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY.

When cold, put over them cla- rified butter. To Stew Prawns, Shrimps, or Cray Fish. Pick the meat from the shells, bruise the shells and put them into half a pint of white wine, the same quantity of water, and a spoonful of vinegar, seasoned with salt, pepper, and mace. Stew them for half an hour, strain them, and thicken the sauce with flour and butter; add a little grated nutmeg and the fish, heat them thoroughly ; toast a slice of thin bread, cut off the crust, and cut it into six pieces, lay it on a dish, and pour over it the stewed prawns, shrimps, or cray fish. To Keep and Fatten Oysters. Put them into water, and wash and clean them with a birch broom ; laying them with the deep shell downwards into a tub or broad platter, and then sprinkle them over with salt. The following day pour over them and fill the vessel with clean cold water, in which they must re- main an hour, then pour it off again ; sprinkle them with salt, and let this be repeated every day. This method will keep them good for a fortnight. To Fry Oysters. Make a batter as for pancakes, seasoned with grated nutmeg, white pepper, and salt, and add some finely gra- ted bread crumbs; dip in the oysters, and fry them of a light brown in beef dripping. Another way to Fry Oysters Is, to dip them into the white of an egg beat up, and roll them in finely grated bread crumbs, seasoned with grated nutmeg, pepper and salt, and fry them as directed.(>9 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. To Stew Oysters. Stew with a quart of oysters, ami their liquor strained, a glass of white wine, one anchovy bruised, seasoned with white pepper, salt, a little mace, and a bunch of sweet herbs; let all stew gently a quarter of an hour. Pick out the bunch of herbs, and add a quarter of a pound of fresh butter kneaded in a large table-spoonful of flour, and stew them ten or twelve minutes. Serve them garnished with bread-sippets and cut lemon. They may be stewed simply in their own liquor, sea- soned with salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg, and thick- ened with cream, flour, and butter. To Scallop Oysters. Put them, with their liquor strained, two or three blades of mace, a few pepper-corns, a little cayenne, and a piece of butter the size of a walnut, kneaded with flour, into a stew-pan. Simmer them very gently for half an hour, by no means letting them boil; pick out the mace and pepper ; have ready, finely grated bread-crumbs, sea- soned with pepper and salt; put into the scallop-shells, or into a dish, alternately a layer of bread crumbs, then one of oysters and part of their liquor; and stick over the last layer of bread crumbs a few bits of butter, and brown them in a Dutch oven for fifteen or twenty minutes. Another way to Scallop Oysters. Take off the beards, stew them in their liquor strain- ed, with a little mace, white pepper, and salt. Fry in a stew-pan, with a bit of butter, some grated bread crumbs, till of a nice brown; put them alternately with the oysters into a dish. To Pickle Oysters.

Oyster Loaves. Cut off the top of some small French rolls, take out the crumb, and fry them brown and crisp with clarified butter, then fry some bread crumbs ; stew the requisite quantity of oysters, bearded and cut into two, in their li- quor, with a little white wine, some gravy, and seasoned with grated lemon peel, pounded mace, pepper, and salt; add a bit of butter; fill the rolls with the oysters, and serve them with the fried bread crumbs in the dish. Oyster Attelets. Cut into small pieces a sweet-bread and a slice or two of bacon, beard some large oysters, and season all highly with chopped parsley, shalot, a little thyme, pep- per, and salt. Then fasten them alternately upon wire skewers; put sifted bread crumbs over them, and broil or fry them of a light brown colour. Take them off the skewers, and serve them with some rich gravy, to which add a little catsup and lemon pickle. To Pickle Mussels. Shell and beard them, save their liquor, put them on with it and some whole black and Jamaica pepper, gin- ger, mace, and salt; boil them five minutes, and when cold, if they are required to be kept, add a little vinegar. Another way to Pickle Mussels. Wash them clean, and put them into a sauce-pan over a quick fire, shake them, that all may be done equally; take them off as soon as the shells open, pick out the71 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. mussels and beard them, and keep the liquor separate; let it settle, strain it, and boil it with a little whole black and Jamaica pepper and salt; put in the mussesl, and boil them for three minutes.

Ox Beet' is considered the best. The flesh should feel tender, be fine in the grain, and of a bright red colour, nicely marbled or mixed with fat. The fat should be white, rather than of a yellow colour. Heifer Beef is excellent when finely fed, and is most suitable for small families. The bone should be taken out of a round of beef before it is salted, and it must be washed, skewered, and bound round firmly before being boiled. Salt beef should be put on with plenty of cold water, and when it boils the scum removed. It is then kept simmering for some hours. A piece weighing fif- teen pounds will require three hours and a half to boil. Carrots and turnips for garnishing should be put on to boil with the beef. If in the least tainted, a piece of charcoal may be boiled with it. When beef is to be kept any length of time, it should be carefully wiped every day. In warm weather, wood vinegar is an excellent preservative : it is put all over the meat with a brush. To protect the meat from flies, it may be sprinkled over with pepper. Tainted meat may be restored by washing in cold water, afterwards in strong camomile tea, after which it may be sprinkled with salt, and used the following day, first washing it in cold water. Roughly pounded charcoal rubbe 1 all over the meat also restores it when tainted. In si mmer, meat in Scotland is frequently kept a fortnight smothered in oatmeal, and carefully wiped every day; and if it should be a little tainted, it is soaked for some hours be- fore it is used, in oatmeal and water. These directions apply equally to all sorts of meat.74 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. The sirloin is the prime joint for roasting. When to be used, it should be washed, then dried with a clean cloth, and the fat covered over with a piece of white paper tied on with thread. The spit should be kept at all times exceedingly clean: it must be wiped dry imme- diately after it is drawn from the meat, and washed and scoured every time it is used. Care should be taken to balance the roast properly upon the spit, but, if not ex- actly right, it is better to make it equal by fastening on a leaden-headed skewer than to pierce it again. The fire should be prepared by putting on plenty of coals at the back. When put down, it should be about ten inches from the fire, and gradually drawn nearer. It is first basted with a little butter or fresh dripping, and then well basted with its own fat all the time it is roasting. Ten minutes before serving, it should be sprinkled with a little salt, then dredged with flour, and basted till it is frothed. When it is drawn from the spit some gravy will run out, to which may be added a little boiling salt and water poured along the bone : the beef is then gar- nished with plenty of finely scraped horse-radish. A sirloin, weighing about fifteen pounds, should be roasted for three hours and a half. A thinner piece of the 6ame weight requires only three hours. In cold weather meat requires longer roasting than in warm, and if newly killed than if it has been kept.75 THE PRACTICE OE COOKERY. To Stew a Rump of Beef. Tie up the beef, and put it on to stew with nearly as much cold water as will cover it; add three pounds of fat bacon cut into slices, a handful of thyme, eight onions, four small carrots, two turnips, two or three bay leaves, some black pepper, a little allspice, mace, and three cloves, a pint of port wine and one of sherry. Let it stew gently between seven and eight hours. Take out the beef, strain the liquor, and skim off all the fat; thicken it with a little flour rubbed down in cold water, boil it up, and pour it over the beef. Have ready carrots and turnips, cut according to fancy, and boiled tender in weak gravy, and put them round the beaf before serving. Another way to Stew a Rump of Beef. Bind the beef tightly, stick in four cloves, and put it in a sauce-pan, with three quarts of water, a quarter of an ounce of black pepper half beaten, some salt, a bunch of sweet herbs, and three anchovies; turn it often, and when half done take it out, pour off the liquor; put in the beef again, with a pint of port wine and half a pint of table-beer made scalding hot, and some of the liquor strained; stew it till tender, clear off’ the fat, and if the sauce is not strong enough, add well-seasoned beef gravy ; thicken it with flour rubbed down in a little cold water. Dish the beef, and pour the gravy round it. Another way to Stew a Rump of Beef. Fry a small rump, or fore rib of beef, in butter till it is brown all over. Make a sauce with butter browned with flour, and some water in which two or three onions have been boiled ; season with pepper, salt, and three table-spoonsful of vinegar; put in the beef, turn it fre- quently, and stew it gently for three hours. A little be- fore serving, add a tea-cupful of port wine. Carrots and turnips, cut into dice, may be stewed with it.THE PRACTICE Ol COOKERY. '<(> A Rump of Beef a la Braise.- Atter a rump of beef has hung for five or six days, bone, and lard it thickly, but so as not to appear upon the surface, witli bits of bacon or ham cut about half an inch square, and rolled in the following seasoning well mixed : Finely minced onion, parsley, thyme, a little garlic, pep- per, and salt. What is left over of the seasoning add to a pint of vinegar, one of port wine, and a tea-cupful of salad oil; steep the beef in this for one night; the follow- ing day paper it, and roast it in a cradle spit. Baste it well, and serve it with a thick brown gravy. A little lemon juice and sliced pickled cucumbers may be added. Garnish with slices of boiled carrot and scraped horse- radish. Stewed Beef. Stew in five quarts of water the middle part of a brisket of beef weighing ten pounds, add two onions stuck with two cloves, one head of celery, one large carrot, two turnips cut small, a handful of sorrel leaves, half an ounce of black pepper, and some salt. Stew it gently for six hours. Make a strong gravy with carrots and turnips, the turnips to be scraped and fried of a brown colour in butter; add pepper, salt, and a little cayenne ; thicken it with flour and butter, and pour it over the beef, with the carrots and turnips. Another way to Stew Beef. Take ten pounds of a brisket of beef, cut the short ribs, and put it into a well-buttered sauce pan, with two large onions, stuck with three or four cloves, two or three carrots cut into quarters, a bunch of sweet herbs, a small lemon sliced, and five quarts of water ; let it stew seven hours. Strain and clarify the gravy—thicken it with butter and flour. Chop the carrots with some capers, mushroom catsup, and cayenne. Any other pickle that is liked may be added.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 17 Another way to Stew Beef. Pound and mix together two ounces of Jamaica pep- per, half an ounce of black pepper, and a little ginger, and half a pound of bay salt; rub it well into a round or rump of beef weighing fourteen or sixteen pounds ; let it lie five or six days, turning it daily. Put a fiat plate at the bottom of a sauce-pan, put in the beef, cover it with water, and let it stew for five hours, keeping the pan perfectly close. If the water wastes, add more boiling- hot. Before serving, take out about a quart of the gravy, skim, and add to it some grated nutmeg and pepper, and some cut pickles; heat and pour it over the beef. Gar- nish with cut pickles. Hunting Beef. Rub well into a round of beef weighing about forty pounds, three ounces of saltpetre ; let it stand five or six hours; pound three ounces of allspice, one of black pep- per, and mix them with two pounds of salt and seven ounces of brown sugar. Rub the beef all over with the salt and spices, let it remain fourteen days, and every other day turn and rub it with the pickle; then wash off the spices, and put it into a deep pan. Cut small nearly six pounds of beef-suet, put some into the bottom of the pan, but the greater part upon the top of the beef. Co- ver it with a coarse paste, and bake it eight hours. When cold, take off the crust, and pour off the gravy. It will keep good for three months. Preserve the gravy, as a little of it improves the flavour of hashes, soups, or any made dishes. Beef a la Braise. Bone a rump of beef; lard it very thickly with bacon seasoned with pepper, salt, cloves, mace, and allspice, and season the beef with pepper and salt; put some slices of bacon into the bottom of the pan, with some whole black pepper, a little allspice, one or two bay leaves, two onions, a clove of garlick, and a bunch ofTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 78 sweet herbs. Put in the beef, and lay over it some slices of bacon, two quarts of weak stock, and half a pint ot white wine. Cover it closely, and let it stew between six and seven hours. Sauce for the beef is made of part of the liquor it has been stewed in, strained, and thickened with a little flour and butter, adding some green onions cut small, and pickled mushrooms. It is poured hot over the beef. Beef Olives. Cut the beef into long thin steaks ; prepare a forcemeat made of bread crumbs, minced beef-suet, chopped pars- ley, a little grated lemon peel, nutmeg, pepper, and salt; bind it with the yolks of eggs beaten; put a layer of it over each steak; roll and tie them with thread. Fry them lightly in beef dripping; put them in a stew-pan with some good brown gravy, a glass of white wine, and a little cayenne ; thicken it with a little flour and butter; cover the pan closely, and let them stew gently an hour. Before serving, add a table-spoonful of mushroom cat- sup ; garnish with cut pickles. Dressed Beef Steaks. Cut thin steaks, longer than they are broad, off a rump; beat them with a rolling-pin; season them with pepper, salt, and finely minced onion ; roll and tie them with thread ; cut them even at the ends ; fry them brown with a little butter; make a sauce with a piece of but- ter browned with flour, some gravy or water, a minced onion, pepper, and salt. Boil it, and add the steaks, and let them stew an hour. Before serving add some mushroom catsup, and take off the threads. Beef Steaks with Potatoes. Cut some thin slices off a rump of beef, beat and sea- son them with a little pepper and salt; dip them into a little melted butter, that the gravy may not drop out whilst they are broiling. When done, serve them with the following mixture laid underneath ; Some finely chop-79 TIIF. PRACTICE OF COOKERY. ped parsley, a little butter, pepper, salt, and lemon; and put, all round the dish, potatoes fried of a fine brown colour. Beef Balls. Mince very finely a piece of tender beef, fat and lean ; mince an onion, with some boiled parsley; add grated bread crumbs, and season with pepper, salt, grated nut- meg, and lemon peel; mix all together, and moisten it with an egg beaten; roil it into balls; flour and fry them in boiling fresh dripping. Serve them with fried bread crumbs, or with a thickened brown gravy. Minced Collops. Cut two pounds of lean tender beef into thin slices—it is best taken from off the rump, or round; mince it very finely ; brown two ounces of butter in a frying pan, dredging it with a little flour, then add the minced meat, and keep beating it with a beater till of a nice brown colour. Have ready some highly seasoned beef gravy, which, with the minced collops, put into a sauce-pan, and let it stew half an hour; and just before serving, put a table-spoonful of mushroom catsup, and, if liked, some green pickles. Beef-suet is as often used as butter to fry the collops in. Another way to make Minced Collops. Mince any piece of lean or tender beef very finely, with one or two onions previously cut small and par- boiled ; season with pepper and salt; brown in a sauce- pan a table-spoonful of butter; add the minced meat; beat it with a beater till it is of a light brown colour, then dust in a little flour, and add about half a pint of gravy or water, with half a talde-spoonful of vinegar. Cover the sauce-pan closely, and let it stew gently for half an hour. A little before serving, add a table-spoon- ful of mushroom catsup. The gravy may be made with the parings and stringy parts of the beef. When the fla-BO TI1E PRACTICE OE COOKERY. vour of onions is disliked, boil some whole small onions, and garnish the dish with them. Minced collops may he kept some weeks packed closely into a jar, after being fried without any onions, and covered with clarified but- ter. When to he dressed follow the above directions. Short, or Spiced Beef. To be eaten cold. Hang up ten or twelve pounds of the middle part of a brisket of beef for three or four days, then rub well into it three ounces of finely powdered saltpetre, and, if spice is approved of, one ounce of allspice, and half an ounce of black pepper; let it stand all night, then salt it with three pounds of well-pounded hay salt, and half a pound of treacle, in which let it remain ten days, rubbing it daily. When it is to be boiled, sew it closely in a cloth, let the water only simmer, upon no account allow- ing it to boil, for nine hours over a slow fire, or upon a stove. When taken out of the water, place two sticks across the pot, and let the beef stand over the steam for half an hour, turning it from side to side, then press it with a heavy weight. It must not be taken out of the cloth till perfectly cold. To Salt Neats’ Tongues. Salt two tongues, and turn them every day for four or five days ; then rub them with two ounces of common salt, one of brown sugar, and half an ounce of saltpetre; turn them daily, and in a fortnight they may be used. The best sort of vessel for salting them in is an earthen- ware pan, as wide at top as bottom, so that the tongues may lie in it long-ways. To Salt Beef for immediate use. Salt a round of beef moderately upon the tops and sides, put it upon sticks, or the tongs of a chccse-tub, over a tub of cold water, and the salt will be drawn through it, so that it will be fit for boiling next day.81 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. » Another Method is— To rub for half an hour into any piece of beef a good quantity of salt, and let it lie for three or four days with- out touching it, when it may be used. Pickle for Beef. Allow to four gallons of water two pounds of brown sugar and six pounds of bay salt, boil it about twenty mi- nutes, takingoff the scum as it rises; the following day pour it over the meat which has been packed into the pickling- I tub. Boil it up every two months, adding three ounces of brown sugar and half a pound of common salt. By this means it will keep good a year. The meat must be sprinkled with salt, and next day wiped dry, before pour- ing the pickle over it, with which it should always be completely covered. With the addition of two ounces of saltpetre and one pound of bay-salt, this pickle answers for pickled pork, hams, and tongues. The tongues should be rubbed with common salt, to cleanse them, and after- wards with a little saltpetre, and allowed to lie for four or five days before they are put into the pickle. The meat will be.ready for use in eight or ten days, and will keep for three months. To Collar Beef. Cut off the end of a brisket of beef, and bone it; sprinkle it with salt and saltpetre, and let it lie a week; mix together some grated nutmeg, Jamaica and black pepper, some chopped lemon thyme, sweet marjoram, and parsley; strew it over the meat, roll it up hard, sew it in a cloth, put it into a large jar of water, tie it closely, and bake it in an oven ; take it out of the jar, and press it with a heavy weight. When it is quite cold take oil’ the cloth, and keep it dry. Hessian Stew. Cut the root of a tongue into large pieces, lay it into a deep pan, rub well into it a handful of salt, pour over it FTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 82 some hot water, and stir it round; when cool enough, scour it well with the hands, and wash it thoroughly in cold water; when perfectly clean, dust it with flour, fry it of a light brown, with a good quantity of small whole onions ; put it into a digester, with a tea-cupful of strong- beer ; rinse out the pan with boiling water, put it to the meat, with three quarts more of hot water, a head or two of garlick, some sliced carrots and turnips; season with ground black, Jamaica, and cayenne pepper, three cloves, and some salt; let it stew three or four hours. Half an hour before serving, take out the meat and some of the soup for gravy, add more spices, and of mushroom cat- sup, soy, walnut-pickle, and corach, a table-spoonful each, and three of port wine; boil it all together, thicken the sauce with butter rolled in flour, and garnish with sip- pets of thin toasted bread cut into a three-cornered shape. The soup that is left may be strained, and served clear, or with vegetables that have been previously boiled. Fry the steaks in a little butter; take them out of the pan, and fry in it a minced onion ; return the steaks, with a little boiling water or gravy, some pepper, salt, and a table-spoonful of vinegar; stew them gently for two or three hours ; thicken the sauce with butter rolled in flour; and serve with or without pickles. Run on a beef heart two ounces of common salt, half an ounce of saltpetre, an ounce and a half of coarse brown sugar, and a little bay salt; turn and rub it every day for nine days, then hang it in the kitchen to dry, when it will become quite hard. When required for use, cut off a small bit, boil, and when cold grate it. It may be served with curled hutler over it. Scots Collops. Cut any piece of tender lean beef into slices,beat them; brown some butter and flour in a sauce-pan; put in the To Stew Beef Steaks. Dutch Beef.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 83 beef, with some salt, pepper, and a finely minced onion —half a minced apple is an improvement; add a little hot water; cover the pan closely, and let them stew till tender. Another way to make Scots Collops. Cut some very thin slices of beef; rub with butter the bottom of an iron stew-pan that has a cover to fit quite closely; put in the meat, some pepper, and a little salt, a large onion, and an apple minced very small. Cover the stew-pan, and let it simmer till the meat is very ten- der. Serve it hot. Beef Rissoles. Chop finely a pound of lean tender beef, and a quar- ter of a pound of beef-suet; pound them in a marble mortar; mix with it a quarter of a pound of grated bread, a little onion, and a head of garlick bruised ; season with salt and pepper; bind it with three eggs well beaten ; make it up into small cakes, fry them of a light brown, then stew them in gravy for fifteen or twenty minutes. To Stew a Tongue. Wash it very clean, and rub it well with common salt and a little saltpetre; let it lie two or three days, and then boil it till the skin will pull off. Put it into a sauce-pan, with part of the liquor it has been boiled in, and a pint of good stock. Season with black and Jamaica pepper, and two or three pounded cloves; add a glass of white wine and a table-spoonful of mushroom catsup, and one of lemon pickle; thicken the sauce with butter rolled in flour, and pour it over the tongue. Pickled Tongue Glazed and Bigarree. Boil a large tongue till it be tender, skin and glaze it, and serve it with mashed turnips on one side, and mashed carrots, or carrots and spinach, on the other.THE PHACTIC'E OE COOKERY. 81- Beef a la Mode. Take the bone out of a small round of fine ox beei, cut some fat bacon in long strips, dip them into common and shalot vinegar mixed, and roll them in the following seasoning: Grated nutmeg, black and Jamaica pepper, one or two cloves, and some salt, parsley, chives, lemon- thyme, knotted marjoram, and savoury, shred quite small. Lard the beef very thickly, bind it firmly with tape, and rub the outside with the seasoning. Put it into a sauce- pan, with the rind of a lemon, four large onions, the red part of three or four carrots, and two turnips cut into dice; add a tea-cupful of strong ale and one of vinegar; let it stew for six or eight hours, turning it two or three times. Half an hour before serving, take out the beef and vegetables, skim off the fat, strain the sauce, and thicken it with a little flour and water mixed smooth, add a tea-cupful of port wine, return it all into the pot, and let it boil. Another Beef a la Mode. Rub well into a piece of the thick flank of ox beef two or three ounces of saltpetre, and half a pound of brown sugar; let it lie for twenty-four hours, then salt it with common salt, and let it lie for ten days or a fort- night ; wash the brine from it, and fillet it firmly. Pre- pare a stuffing of chopped parsley, anchovy, mace, black and Jamaica pepper, and a little butter; make holes • every here and there with a large knife, and stuff them with the above mixture. Put it into a pan that will just hold it, and fill it up with cold water; add some whole black pepper, and cover it with a flour-and-water paste; bake it for some hours. When cold, take off the crust and all the fat, and keep the beef in the pan. Baked Beef. Mix together three quarters of a pound of common salt, half an ounce of saltpetre, and two ounces of sugar ; rub it well into ten pounds of a fore rib of beef; let itTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 85 lie a fortnight, basting it daily; smoke it for three weeks in a chimney where saw-dust is burnt; wash it very clean; put it into a deep earthen-pan; cover it with a coarse flour-and-water paste, and bake it for three or four hours in an oven. Hashed Beef. Cut the beef into small thin slices, free from fat and skin; putthe trimmings, and part of the bones, into a sauce- pan, with two large onions sliced, a little vinegar, and about a pint of stock; let it simmer for an hour, strain it, and skim off the fat; put an ounce of butter into a sauce- pan, and when it melts shake in a spoonful of flour; stir it for two or three minutes, then add the strained gravy; stir it till it boil, put in a little catsup, and add the beef; let; it simmer to make it hot, but it must not be allowed to boil. If the bones are to be served with the hash, score, and season them with pepper and salt; put them into a tin-pan, with a little bit of butter here and there; heat them in a Dutch oven, and then broil them on a gridiron to brown them well. To Dress Cold Roast Beef. Cut into dice some under-done beef, dredge it with flour, and fry it for three or four minutes in butter, with an onion, a little parsley, and a sprig of lemon-thyme minced ; put it into a sauce-pan, with some well-seasoned gravy, a tea-spoonful of vinegar, and one of mushroom catsup ; simmer it for half an hour. Serve it with poached eggs laid upon the top. Fricandellans. Mince about two pounds of tender lean beef, and three quarters of a pound of fresh suet, then pound it till it be as smooth as a paste, and carefully pick out all the threads and sinews; add four well-beaten eggs, half a pint of rich cream, and as much grated and sifted bread as will make it sufficiently consistent to form into rolls resembling corks, and season it with salt, black and Ja-THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 86 maica pepper. Boil the corks in some good stock, or in boiling water. Beef Gobbets. Cut a piece of beef into small bits, season them with pepper, salt, grated lemon-peel, and nutmeg, some pars- ley and shalot finely chopped ; fry them brown in but- ter, and stew them till tender in a rich brown gravy, adding a table-spoonful of vinegar and one of port wine. Put thickly over them grated bread, seasoned with pep- per, salt, and a little butter, and brown them with a sa- lamander. To Dress the Inside of a Cold Sirloin of Beef. Cut off the meat, with a little of the fat, into strips three inches long and half an inch thick ; season with pep- per and salt, dredge them with flour, and fry them brown in butter ; then simmer them in a rich brown gravy ; add of mushroom catsup, onion, and shalot vinegar, a table- spoonful each. Garnish with fried parsley. Another way to Dress the Inside of a Cold Sirloin of Beef. Cut off entire the inside of a large sirloin of beef, brown it all over in a stew-pan, then add a quart of water, half a pint of port wine, a tea-cupful of strong beer, two table-spoonfuls of vinegar, some pepper, salt, and a large onion finely minced; cover the pan closely, and let it stew till the beef be very tender. Garnish with pickles. To Roast Beef Heart. Wash it well, and clean all the blood carefully from the pipes; parboil it ten or fifteen minutes in boiling water; drip the water from it; put in a stuffing which has been made of bread crumbs, minced suet or butter, sweet marjoram, lemon thyme, and parsley, seasoned with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Put it down to roast while hot, baste it well with butter, froth it up, andTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 87 serve it with melted butter and vinegar; or with gravy in the dish, and currant jelly in a sauce-tureen. To hash it, follow the directions given for hare. To Boil Tripe. Clean it extremely well, and take off the fat; let it lie a night in salt-and-water, again wash it well, and let it lie in milk-and-water for the same length of time; then cut it into small pieces, roll and tie them with thread; put them, with a clean washed marrow-bone, into a linen- bag ; tie it closely, and put it into a stew-pan that has a cover to fit quite closely, fill it up with water, and let it boil gently for six hours. Take the tripe out of the bag, put it into a jar, and pour over it the liquor in which it was boiled. When to be dressed, boil some whole small onions in a part of the liquor, add a little salt, then put in the tripe, and heat it thoroughly. Or it may be fried in butter fricasseed, or stewed in a brown sauce. Instead of being boiled in a bag, the tripe may be put, with some salt and whole pepper, into a stoneware jar, which must have a piece of linen tied over it, and a plate laid upon the top. The pot should always be kept full of boiling water, taking care that it do not boil into the jar. To Roast Tripe. Cut the tripe into two oblong pieces, make a forcemeat of bread crumbs and chopped parsley, seasoned with pepper and salt; bind it with the yolks of two eggs; spread it upon the fat side of the tripe, and lay on the other fat side; then roll it very tightly, and tie it with packthread. Roast, and baste it with butter: it will take one hour, or one hour and a half. Serve it with melted butter, into which put a table-spoonful of catsup and one of lemon pickle. To Fry Tripe. Cut it into bits three or four inches square; make a batter thicker than for pancakes, of three eggs beaten upTHE PRACTICE Of COOKERY. 88 with flour and milk, a little salt, pepper, and nutmeg; dip in the tripe, and fry it in butter, or fresh dripping, of a light brown colour. Serve it garnished with parsley. Sauce;—melted butter with lemon pickle in it. To Boil Marrow Bones. Saw them even at the bottom; butter and flour some bits of linen, and tie a piece over the top of each bone; boil them for an hour or two, take off the linen, and serve them with thin slices of dry toast cut into square bits. At table the marrow should be put upon the toast, and a little pepper and salt sprinkled over it. Mock Hare. Cur the lean meat from the inside of a sirloin of beef, soak it eight-and-forty hours in a tea-cupful of port wine and a glass of vinegar; cut it open, lard it, and make a stuffing as for hare, using the raw liver of a fowl; lay it on the meat, roll and tie it tightly, and roast it by a hanging jack. Baste it with the liquor in which it was soaked, adding a little more port wine and vinegar, and mixing with it nearly a tea-spoonful of pounded allspice. Serve it with some good gravy in the dish, and currant jelly in a sauce tureen. A Fillet of Beef. Bone a middle rib of beef weighing about fifteen pounds; roll the meat tightly and firmly, and skewer it. Roast and garnish it in the same manner as a sirloin. Burgeses Method of Boiling Hung Beef. Hung beef for grating should be put on in boiling water, and, to preserve the colour, kept boiling as fast as posible. Allow for six pounds of beef one hour and a half. It will keep good for a length of time. Scarlet Beef. Mix a little mace, cloves, allspice, black pepper, and saltpetre together, rub it well into two pounds of tender89 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. loan beef; let it lie six days, turning it daily, and rub- bing it with the pickle; then roll and tie it firmly with tape; put it and the pickle into a small jar, with a slice or two of beef-suet under and over it; tie it closely, and bake it an hour. It is eaten cold, cut in thin slices, and garnished with parsley. If long kept the colour fades. Spring Garden Beef. Cut a piece of lean tender beef into thick slices, lard and season them with pepper, salt, and sweet herbs ; pour over them a little port wine, and stew them in weak stock, with one or two bay leaves, till tender; strain the sauce; thicken it with flour and butter. Heat it up, and pour it over the slices of beef. Bubble and Squeak. Chop small some boiled white cabbage; season it with pepper and salt, and fry it with a little butter; pep- per and broil some slices of cold boiled salted beef; put the fried cabbage into a dish, and lay round it the slices of broiled beef, and serve it very hot. The beef does best when underdone. To Cure Plung Beef. Rub a small quantity of salt on eight ribs of the thin part of the beef, and let it lie three days ; pound two oun- ces of saltpetre, and two ounces of very brown sugar, and rub it well into the beef; turn it every day, and if it be- come slimy, strew over it a little common salt, but let it be very little ; lay it upon a sloping board that the brine may run off. Let it lie a fortnight, and hang it up to dry, but not too near the fire, nor in a warm kitchen, as it would then soon grow rancid. Beef or Mutton Baked with Potatoes. Boil some potatoes, peel, and pound them in a mor- tar, with one or two small onions ; moisten them with milk and an egg beaten up; add a little salt and pepper. Season slices of beef, or mutton chops, with salt and pep-THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 90 per, and more onion, if the flavour is approved; rub the bottom of a pudding dish witli butter, and put a layer of the mashed potatoes, which should be as thick as a bat- ter, and then a layer of meat, and so on alternately till the dish is filled, ending with potatoes. Bake it in an oven for one hour. Olive Royals. Boil one pound of potatoes, and when nearly cold rub them perfectly smooth with four ounces of flour and one ounce of butter, and knead it together till it become a paste; roll it out about a quarter of an inch thick, cut it into rounds, and lay upon one side any sort of cold roasted meat cut into thin small bits, and seasoned with pepper and salt; put a very small bit of butter over it, wet the edges, and close the paste in the form of a half circle. Fry them in boiling fresh dripping of a light brown co- lour ; lay them before the fire, on the back of a sieve, to drain. Serve them with or without gravy in the dish. For a change, mince the meat, and season it as before directed. The potatoes should be very mealy. Beef and Oyster Sausages. Scald three quarters of a pint of oysters in their own liquor; take them out and chop them finely; mince one pound of beef and mutton, and three quarters of a pound of beef-suet; add the oysters, and season with salt, pep- per, mace, and two cloves pounded ; beat up two eggs, and mix them well with the other ingredients, and pack it closely into a jar. When to be used, roll it into the form of small sausages ; dip them into the yolk of an egg beaten up; strew grated bread crumbs over them, or dust with flour, and fry them in fresh dripping. Serve them upon fried bread, hot. Hamburgh Beef. Put on in cold water a brisket of beef; when it boils skim it well, take out the beef, let it cool, and then rub it well with three handfuls of salt, and two tea-spoon-91 TIIE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. fills of saltpetre; beat it well with a rolling-pin for twen- ty or thirty minutes; put it into a pickling-tub, strew over it a small handful of salt, let it lie four days, then turn it; put the same quantity of salt, and let it lie four days more; after which sew it into a piece of old linen, and let it hang twelve days in smoke. To Boil Ox Cheek. Wash very clean, half a head ; let it lie in cold water all night; break the bone in two, taking care not to break the flesh. Put it on in a pot of boiling water, and let it boil from two to three hours ; take out the bone. Serve it with boiled carrots and turnips, or savoys. The liquor the head has been boiled in may be strained and made into Scots barley broth, or Scots kale. To Stew Ox Cheek. Clean the head, as before directed, and parboil it; take out the bone ; stew it in part of the liquor in which it was boiled, thickened with a piece of butter mixed with flour, and browned. Cut into dice, or into any fancy shape, carrots and turnips, as much, when cut, as will fill a pint basin. Mince two or three onions, add the vegetables, and season with salt, black and Jamaica pepper. Cover the pan closely, and stew it two hours. A little before serving, add a glass of port wine or ale. Dressed Ox Cheek. Prepare it as directed for stewing. Cut the meat into square pieces; make a sauce with a quart of good gra- vy, thickened with butter mixed with flour; season with salt, black and Jamaica pepper, a little cayenne, and a table-spoonful of vinegar. Put in the head, and simmer it till quite tender. A few minutes before serving, add a little catsup or white wine. Forcemeat balls may be added. Potted Ox Cheek May be mnde of the meat that is left from any one ofTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 92 these dishes. It is cut into small hits, and heated up with a little of the liquor in which the cheek was boiled, season- ed with black and Jamaica pepper, salt, nutmeg, and a lit- tle vinegar, then put into a mould, and turned out when required for use. It is used for supper or luncheon, and is eaten with mustard and vinegar. Many excellent and economical dishes are made of an ox cheek, and it is particularly useful in large fa- milies. To Dress Kidneys and Skirts. Wash the kidneys, cut them into slices ; take the skin off the skirts, and cut them into small pieces ; dust them with flour, and fry them brown in butter. Simmer them an hour in a pint of gravy, with an onion finely minced, some salt and pepper. A little before serving, add a ta- ble-spoonful of mushroom catsup. They may be broiled and eaten like a beef steak. To Dress Palates and Sweetbreads. Boil the palates till the black skin can be easily peel- pd off; parboil the sweetbreads with them; skin and cut the palates into pieces, and if the sweetbreads are large, cut them in two the long way; dust them with flour, and fry them of a light brown, in butter; then stew them in rather more than a pint of the liquor in which they were boiled. Brown a piece of butter with flour; add it, with a little cayenne, salt, pepper, grated lemon peel, and nutmeg, and a glass of white wine. A little before serving, stir in a spoonful of vinegar, or the squeeze of a lemon. Blanquette of Palates of Beef. Boil in weak broth or water, six or eight nicely clean- ed beef palates, and when the black skin will easily peel off, they are done enough ; then skin and cut them into pieces the size of a shilling, and stew them in a sauce tournee. Serve them in a casseroe of rice, or a vol au vent.93 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. To Broil Beef Steaks. Cut the steaks off a rump or the ribs of a fore-quar- ter ; beat them well with a rolling-pin. Have the grid- iron perfectly clean and heated over a clear quick fire; lay on the steaks, and, with meat tongs, keep turning them constantly, till they are done enough ; throw a lit- tle salt over them a little before taking them off the fire. Serve them as hot as possible, plain, or with a made gra- vy and sliced onion, or rub a bit of butter upon the steaks the moment of serving. Mutton chops are broiled in the same manner. Ox-feet or Cow-lieel. Wash them well; boil them in plenty of water, till the hoofs come off, and the hair can be pulled off, and scraped clean ; wash them well, and boil them in fresh water till all the bones can be easily taken out. To pot them, cut them into small pieces, add a little of the liquor, heat it, and season it with some salt and vinegar; put it into a mould, and when it becomes cold, turn it out. It is eaten with vinegar and mustard. They may be served without being cut small, either hot or cold; if hot, serve with thick parsley and butter. Another Ox-feet or Cow-lieel. Cut them into small bits ; dip them into the yolk of an egg beaten up ; roll them in bread crumbs, seasoned with pepper, salt, and minced parsley; fry them in butter. Cut into thin slices a good dish of onions, fry them in but- ter, and serve them hot, with the fried heel laid upon them. The liquor may be made into jelly, or used to enrich sauces and gravies. Ox-blood Puddings. Let the blood run into a deep pan, stir it all the time, and when it is nearly cold, throw in a little salt; rub it through a hair sieve ; mix a pint of milk with two quarts of blood. Chop some suet, mix it with minced onion,S't T1IE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. pepper, salt, and two or three handfuls of oatmeal, then add the blood and milk. To clean the pudding skins, wash them thoroughly, and let them lie a night in salt and wa- ter. When they are to be filled, tie one end, and turn the inside out; half fill them, and tie them in rings, or in equal lengths. When the water boils, throw in a little cold, to put it off the boil, and put in the puddings. In five minutes, put them upon a dish, and prick them with a large needle; return them into the pot, and boil them half an hour. Hang them up in a diy cool place, to keep them. When they are to be used, put them on in hot water for ten or fifteen minutes, and then broil them. Meal Puddings. Sift a pound of oatmeal, chop three quarters of a pound of suet, mince some onions, and mix all together ; season well with pepper and salt; half fill the skins, and boil and dress them as directed in the receipt for ox-blood puddings. Some people think a little sugar an improvement. Ox-liver Puddings. Boil the liver and grate it; mix, in equal quantities, grated liver, grated bread, and minced suet; season well with black and Jamaica pepper, a little grated nutmeg, salt, and a glass of rum. Half fill the skins, and manage them in the same way as the other puddings. Some per- sons use double the quantity of suet. Apple Puddings in Skins. Pare, core, and mince a pound of apples; grate a pound of bread, or the same quantity of pounded biscuit; mince half a pound of suet; mix all together with half a pound of brown sugar, and a quarter of a pound of cleaned currants; season with half a grated nutmeg, four cloves pounded, a little grated lemon peel, and four table-spoon- fuls of white wine. Half fill the skins; boil them for fif- teen minutes, taking care to prick them well, When they95 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. are to be used, boil them for a few minutes, and brown them in a Dutch oven. Currant Puddings in Skins. Clean and dry half a pound of currants; stone and mince a quarter of a pound of raisins; take the same quantity of beef suet, grated bread, and brown sugar; mix all these ingredients well; season with grated nut- meg, lemon peel, and two or three cloves pounded, and a little wine. Half fill the skins, and do them the same as the apple puddings. Beef Ham. Rub a little common salt over a piece of beef of about twenty pounds weight; take out the bone, and in one or two days, rub well into the beef the following ingredi- ents, finely pounded and well mixed:—two ounces of sal-prunella, four ounces of brown sugar, six ounces of bay salt, one ounce of white pepper, and of cloves and nutmeg, a quarter of an ounce each ; then strew over it half a pound of common salt. Let it lie fifteen days, turning it daily. It is then hung up; or when taken out of the pickle, it may be boiled, and allowed to stand till cold in the water in which it was boiled; or it may be baked in a deep dish, covered with a coarse paste.THE PRACTICE OP COOKERY. <Jd CHAPTER IV.

PREPARATORY REMARKS ON MUTTON. .c The finest mutton is that of the mountain, or black- faced sheep of Scotland, and that of the South Downs and Welsh sheep. Sheep are in perfection from the age of four to five. In May and June, or just before shearing,mut- ton tastes strongly of the coat, or what is called woolly. Wedder mutton, which is the best, may be known by a prominent lump of fat at the edge of the broadest part of the inside of the leg. That meat should be chosen which97 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. is fine in the grain, bright in the colour, and the fat firm and white.

For keeping mutton, the same directions may be ob- served as for keeping beef. The haunch is the prime joint. It should be roasted at a good brisk fire, and basted as beef, the fat being first covered with a piece of white paper. Before serving, half a sheet of foolscap paper, folded and fringed, should be put round the shank bone. The haunch weighing fourteen pounds, will require two hours and a half to roast. Currant jelly sauce should be served with it. When a leg of mutton is to be boiled, it should first be washed clean, then put on, in boiling water, and careful- ly scummed. If weighing eight or nine pounds, it should be boiled nearly three hours, and then served with caper sauce. A saddle or a chine, that is to say, two necks or two loins, a joint, generally called, indifferently, a saddle of mutton, being broad, requires a high and strong fire. The skin should be taken off, and skewered on again, or paper may be substituted for it, tied on with a buttered string. It should be well basted, and a quarter of an hour before serving, the skin or paper removed; it is then allowed to brown a little, is sprinkled with salt, basted and dredged with flour, served with gravy in the dish, and currant jelly sauce. A shoulder of mutton should be roasted an hour and a half, and served with onion sauce, in a sauce tureen. A loin of mutton should be carefully jointed, roasted the same length of time as a shoulder, and is carved lengthways. GL 98 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. The best end of a neck of mutton should be jointed, and roasted, the same as the loin; or it may be boiled. If the latter, the skin should be taken off before serving, and caper sauce poured over it. A breast of mutton may be parboiled, grilled, and served with onion or caper sauce. Many persons think that every kind of meat should be boiled in a floured cloth, and in the writer’s opinion, this greatly improves its appearance. This, however, does not supersede the necessity of skimming, which, in boiling, should always be carefully attended to. To Dress a Shoulder of Mutton. Bone a small shoulder of mutton; roll it, and put it into a cloth ; put it on in boiling water. Have ready a nice white sauce ; stir into it some thick cream, and add some chopped Indian pickle. Make it all hot, but take care not to let it boil, and pour it over the mutton. French Mutton Steaks. Cut a neck of mutton into neat steaks ; put them in- to a sauce-pan, with sufficient water to cover them; add a 6mall bunch of sweet herbs, two or three onions, and some pepper. Let them boil two minutes; take them out, and stew the trimmings of the steaks with the herbs, till the gravy is sufficiently strong, then strain it, and take off all the fat. Ilub the steaks with a well-beaten yolk of an egg, and strew over them bread crumbs mix- , ed with finely chopped sweet herbs. Thicken the gravy with a little browned butter and flour, add a table-spoon- ful of vinegar, and when it is quite hot, pour it into the dish, and lay in the steaks. Mutton Cutlets. Cut into cutlets a pound and a half of the thick partTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 99 of a leg of mutton, and beat them ; mix with grated bread crumbs, some pepper, salt, and finely chop- ped parsley, lemon thyme, and sweet marjoram. Rub the cutlets with melted butter, and cover them thickly with the prepared bread; fry them for ten minutes in butter, then put them into a sauce-pan, with some good gravy thickened with flour and butter, and simmer them for ten or fifteen minutes. Mock Venison. Hang up a large fat loin of mutton for several days; then bone it, and take off all the kidney fat, and the skin from the upper fat; mix together two ounces of brown sugar, and one ounce of ground black pepper. Rub it well into the mutton ; pour over it two or three wine-glass- es of port wine ; keep it covered with the skin ; rub and turn it daily for five days. When it is to be roasted, cover it with the skin, and paper it the same way as venison is done. Serve it with made gravy, and the same sauces as for venison. Maintenon Chops. Cut a neck of mutton into chops; beat them flat with a rolling-pin. Bruise the yolk of a hard-boiled egg, and mix wit!) it chopped sweet herbs, grated bread, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Cover the steaks with it‘, and put each into a piece of well-buttered paper; broil them over a clear fire, turning them often. Serve them in the paper, or with a browned gravy. A Haricot of Mutton. Trim the chops neatly, by shortening the bone; if the whole of the best end of the neck is to be used, put on the trimmings in half a pint of water, and let it simmer for fifteen minutes. Fry some sliced onions in a little butter; take them out; flour the chops, and fry them quickly, of a nice brown colour; put them into a sauce- pan with the onions, and 6ome carrots and turnips cut into dice; strain the gravy into the frying-pan, boil it up, andTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 100 add it to the chops and vegetables, with two or three cloves, a little allspice and pepper. It should simmer for two hours; and just before serving, clear off the scum, and thicken with a little flour rubbed down in cold wa- ter, and add a table-spoonful of mushroom catsup. To Stew a Shoulder of Mutton. Bone a shoulder of mutton with a sharp knife, and fill the space with the following stuffing:—grated bread, minced suet, parsley, pepper, salt, and nutmeg; bind with the yolks of two eggs well beaten. Sew or fasten it with small skewers; brown it in a frying-pan, with a bit of butter. Break the bone, put it into a sauce-pan, with some water, an onion, pepper, salt, and a bunch of pars- ley ; let it stew till the strength be extracted ; strain, and thicken it with butter rolled in flour; put it, with the mutton, and a glass of port wine, into the sauce-pan ; co- ver it closely, and let it stew gently for two hours. Be- fore serving, add two table-spoonfuls of mushroom cat- sup. Garnish with pickles. Another way to Stew a Shoulder of Mutton. Bone and flatten a shoulder of mutton, sprinkle over it pepper and salt, roll it up tightly, bind it with tape, and put it into a stew-pan that will just hold it, pour over it a well-seasoned gravy made with the bones, cover the pan closely, and let it stew till tender ; before ser- ving, take off the tape, thicken the gravy, and garnish with cut pickles. To Stew a Fillet of Mutton, or a Breast of Beef. Put a fillet of mutton or a piece of beef, weighing about seven pounds, into a stew-pan, with a carrot, a tur- nip, an onion stuck with two or three cloves, and a pint of water. Put round the edge of the stew-pan, a rim of coarse paste, that the cover may be kept very close, and let it stew gently, three hours and a half, take out the meat, skim off the fat, strain and thicken the gravy, have101 HIE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. ready some boiled carrots and turnips cut to fancy, add them to the gravy, make all hot, and serve with a gar- nish of sliced gerkins. To Stew a Loin of Mutton. Bone and skin the loin; stew it in a pint of water, turning it frequently; when the liquor is half wasted, take out the loin and strain it, and when cold take off the fat; make a rich highly-seasoned gravy of the bones ; strain and mix it with the liquor the loin was stewed in; add a tea-cupful of port wine, and some small mushrooms; thick- en the sauce with butter rolled in flour; put in the mutton, and heat it thoroughly; garnish with pickles. Kew Mince. Cut a pound of meat from a leg of cold roasted mut- ton, and mince it very finely, together with six ounces of suet, mix with it three or four table-spoonfuls of crumbs of bread, the beaten yolks of four eggs, one anchovy chop- ped, some pepper and salt, and half a pint of port wine ; put it into a caul of veal, and bake it in a quick oven ; turn it out into a dish, and pour some brown gravy over it; serve with it venison sauce. When a veal caul is not to be had, the mince may be done in a sauce-pan. Irish Stew. Cut the best end of a neck of mutton into chops, put them into a sauce-pan with four or five pounds of pota- toes, six minced onions, some pepper and salt, and a quart of cold water, keep the pan closely covered, and when it boils remove it to the side of the fire that it may simmer with a gentle heat for two or three hours; before ser- ving, add a table-spoonful or two of catsup.

To broil a cold Roasted Shoulder of Mutton. A cold shoulder of roast mutton having only a little meat upon the blade bone, may be scored, sprinkled with pepper and salt, then broiled and served with caper 6auce poured over it, or melted butter, in which should be mix- ed of mushroom catsup, lemon pickle, and Harvey sauce, a table-spoonful each. A Haunch of Mutton like Venison. Take a fat haunch of large fine mutton, let it hang a week, then pound one ounce of black, and one ounce of103 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Jamaica pepper, and rub them over the mutton, pour a bottle of port wine over it, and let it remain in this five days, basting it frequently every day with the liquor, take it out and hang it up four or five days more, or as long as the weather favours its keeping; wipe it three or four times a-day, with a clean cloth. While it is roasting baste it with the liquor it was steeped in, adding a little more port wine ; a quarter of an hour before taking it from the tire, haste it well with butter, and dredge flour over it to froth it up. Serve it with sauces as for venison. Baked Mutton Chops. Cut a neck of mutton into neat chops, season them with salt and pepper, butter a dish, lay in the chops and poui- over them a batter made of a quart of milk, four eggs beaten up, four table-spoonfuls of flour, and a little salt.

Wash and dry some nice kidneys, cut them in half and with a small skewer, keep them open in imitation of two shells, season them with salt and pepper, and dip them into a little fresh melted butter. Broil first the side that is cut, and be careful not to let the gravy drop in taking them off the gridiron. Serve them in a hot dish, with finely chopped parsley mixed with melted butter, the juice of a lemon, pepper and salt, putting a little upon each kidney. This is an excellent breakfast for a sportsman. Sheep’s Trotters Fried. Clean some sheep’s trotters nicely, scald and wash them in hot water; stew them in that sauce in which calf’s head plain (p. 122) is boiled, and bone them. Fry, but not till brown, in a little butter, some carrots, onions, a lit- tle parsley-roots, all cut small, thyme, a shalot, a small bay leaf, and a clove. When they begin to colour, moisten them with water and vinegar mixed in equal parts, and let it all stew till the vegetables are quite tender; season with pepper and salt, and strain it through a silk sieve over the sheep’s trotters, then fry the trotters in this batter; put nearly four table-spoonfuls of flour into an earthen pan, with a little salt, a little olive oil, and as much good beer or water as will moisten the paste ; when well mixed, add the beaten whites of two eggs, dip the trotters into this, and fry them instantly. The marinade cuite, or pickle, into which the trotters are laid, and the paste in which they are fried, may be107 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. quarter of an ounce of cloves, and one nutmeg. used for beef, and other meats. The same receipt may he followed exactly for calf’s feet. To Cure Mutton Ham. Cut a hind quarter of good mutton into the shape of a ham, pound one ounce of saltpetre, with one pound of coarse salt and a quarter of a pound of brown sugar, rub the ham well with this mixture, taking care to stuff the hole of the shank well with salt and sugar, and let it lie a fortnight, rubbing it well with the pickle every two or three days; then take it out, and press it with a weight for one day; smoke it with saw dust for ten or fifteen days, or hang it to dry in the kitchen. If the ham is to he boiled soon after it has been smoked, soak it one hour, and if it has been smoked any length of time it will re- quire to be soaked several hours. Put it on in cold wa- ter, and boil it gently two hours. It is eaten cold at breakfast, luncheon, or supper. A mutton ham is some- times cured with the above quantity of salt and sugar, with the addition of half an ounce of white pepper, aTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 108 CHAPTER V. LAMB. PREPARATORY REMARKS ON LAMB. The fore quarter of lamb consists of the shoulder, the neck, and the breast together; the hind quarter is the leg and loin. There are also the head and pluck, the fry or sweetbreads, skirts, lamb-stones, and liver. In choosing the fore quartex-, the vein in the neck should be ruddy, or of a bluish colour. In the hind quarter, the knuckle should feel stiff, the kidney small, and perfectly fresh. To keep it, the joints should be carefully wiped every day, and, in warm weather, sprin- kled with a little pepper. The fore quarter is the prime joint, and should be roasted and basted with butter; the gravy is made as for beef or mutton. Mint sauce is ser- ved in a sauce tui-een, and half a lemon is sent to table with it, the juice of which is squeezed upon the ribs, af- ter the shoulder is cut off, and they have been sprinkled with salt. If the joint weighs five pounds, it will require to be roasted one hour; if ten pounds, one hour and three quarters. The hind quarter may be roasted, or the leg of it boiled. The loin is then cut into steaks, fried,109 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. and served round it; the outside bones being covered with a fringe of fried parsley. A dish of spinach is ge- nerally served with lamb. Lamb’s Head and Mince. Scald the head, and take off the hair; parboil it with the pluck; divide the head, and take out the brains; mince the heart and lights, also an onion; put it into a sauce-pan with a little gravy, thickened with butter and flour, add a little salt and pepper, cover the pan closely, and let it stew an hour. Rub the head with the yolk of an egg beaten up, and strew over it finely grated bread, mixed with salt and pepper and boiled minced parsley ; stick bits of butter here and there, and brown it in a Dutch oven. Cut the liver into slices, and fry it in but- ter ; make the brains into cakes. Serve the head upon the mince, and garnish with the liver and brain cakes. Lamb Dressed with Rice. Half roast a small fore quarter of lamb; cut it into steaks, season them with a little salt and pepper; lay them into a dish, and pour in a little water. Boil a pound of rice with a blade or two of mace; strain it, and stir in a good piece of fresh butter, and a little salt, add also the greater part of the yolks of four eggs beaten; cover the lamb with the rice, and with a feather put over it the re- mainder of the beaten eggs. Bake it in an oven till it has acquired a light brown colour. Lamb Chops. Cut a neck or loin of lamb into chops ; rub them over with the beaten yolk of an egg; dip them into grated bread, mixed with plenty of chopped parsley, and sea- soned with lemon peel, pepper, and salt; fry them a light brown in good dripping; make a sauce with the trim-110 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. tilings, and thicken the sauce with butter rolled in flour; add a little lemon pickle and mushroom catsup.

Clean, wash well, and blanch six lambs’ feet; stew them, till they become tender, in some white stock, with a slice of lean ham, one onion, some parsley, thyme, two blades of mace, a little whole white pepper, and a few mushrooms. Before serving, strain the sauce; thicken it with flour and butter, and half a pint of cream ; boil it a quarter of an hour, add the feet and the juice of half a small lemon. Garnish with sippets of thin toasted bread, cut into a three-cornered shape. Lamb Chops Broiled. Cut a loin or best end of the neck into chops, flatten them, and cut off the fat and skin ; mb the gridiron with a little fat, and broil them on a clear fire. Turn them with steak tongs, till quite done. Serve them hot; Dressed Lamb’s Chops. Cut the chops off the best end of a neck of lamb, flatten them, and cut off the skin and fat; dip them into the beaten yolk of an egg, and then into bread crumbs, mixed with minced parsley, pepper, and salt. Fry them in boiling clarified beef suet, and drain them before the fire upon the back of a sieve. Thicken a little gravy with flour and butter; add a table-spoonful of white wine and one of catsup; make it quite hot, pour it into the dish, and lay in the chops. Garnish with fried pars- ley. Lamb Cutlets. Cut the cutlets off the loin, into round bits ; trim off the fat and skin ; dip them into the beaten yolk of an egg, and then into bread crumbs, mixed with minced parsley, grated nutmeg, and lemon peel, pepper, and salt.

Serve them with melted butter and a little lemon pickle in it, or a brown sauce thickened. Garnish with cut lemon. To Dress a Breast of Lamb. Cut it into pieces, and stew it in weak stock, with a glass of white wine ; add pepper and salt. When it is perfectly tender, thicken the sauce with butter and flour. Have cucumbers stewed in gravy ready to put over the lamb before serving. A breast of mutton may be served up in the same way.112 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. CHAPTER VI. VEAL. The names of the joints are as follows: IN ENGLAND. Loin, best end—Loin, chump end—Fillet—Hind Knuc- kle—Fore Knuckle—Neck, best end—Neck, scrag end—Blade Bone—Breast, best end—Breast, brisket end. IN SCOTLAND. The Loin, Fillet, and Knuckle—Back Ribs—Breast, Neck, and Head. In Scotland, the veal seldom exceeds four weeks old, therefore it is not cut into so many divisions as is the practice in England, where it is often eight weeks old. The entrails are named the pluck, which consists of the heart, liver, lights,, nut, melt, and skirts, the throat, windpipe, and sweetbreads. PREPARATORY REMARKS ON VEAL. Veal should be fine in the grain, firm, white, and fat, and the leg bone small. The finest calves have the small- est kidnev, and its being well covered with thick white 3THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 113 fat, indicates good veal. The fillet of a cow calf is to be preferred, on account of the udder. The prime joints are the fillet, the loin, the chump end of the loin, and the best end of the neck. To keep it, the same directions may be followed, which are given for keeping beef. When the fillet is to be roasted, it should be washed, well dried, and the bone taken out, the space filled with a fine stuffing, part of which should be put under the flap, then formed into a round, and firmly skewered. T hat the fire may be clear and strong, it should be made up some time before putting down the roast, which should at first be placed at some distance from it, and be fre- quently and well basted with butter. When about half roasted, a piece of white paper is tied over the fat; a lit- tle before serving, it is removed, the meat is then sprinkled with salt, dredged with flour, and well basted to froth it. When dished, finely melted butter is poured over it, with which may or may not be mixed some lemon pickle or brown gravy. It is garnished with cut lemon. A fillet weighing ten or fourteen pounds requires four hours to roast. The loin will take about three hours to roast; and is basted, the fat covered with paper, and served like the fillet. A slice of thin toasted bread is also served with it, on which the carver should lay a part of the kidney fat, and sprinkle it with salt and pepper. A shoulder stuffed with forcemeat will take from two to three hours to roast. The best end of the neck may be roasted or boiled; if boiled, melted butter, made thick with parsley, is pour- ed over it. A knuckle of veal may be boiled and served in the same way. Pickled pork, ham, bacon, tongue, or sausages, is the general accompaniment to roasted or boiled veal. iiTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 114 Veal Collated White. Bone a breast of veal; chop and strew over it some finely-chopped sweet herbs; make a forcemeat of beef suet, grated bread, lemon peel, a small onion pounded ; season with white pepper, grated nutmeg, and salt; pound it in a marble mortar, and lay it thickly over the veal; roll it up firmly, sew it in a cloth, and boil it for three hours. The sweetbread is to be boiled, sliced, and laid round the dish. For gravy, boil the bones and pa- rings of the veal with a bunch of parsley. Strain and season it with white pepper, salt, and mushroom powder; thicken it with butter and flour ; and a little before serving, add three or four table-spoonfuls of cream. Brown Rollklops of Veal. Cut off some thin slices from a fillet of veal, and beat them. Take part of the fat from the loin and kidney; mince it finely, with a small bit of veal, and six ancho- vies ; season with salt, pounded ginger, and mace ; put it over the slices of veal, and roll them up. Dip them into the beaten yolk of an egg, and then into grated bread ; re- peat this a second time, and fry them of a nice brown colour in clarified beef dripping, then stew them in some good gravy, adding a little walnut pickle and half a pint of white wine. Veal Roll. Bone a small breast of veal, and spread over it a rich and highly-seasoned forcemeat. Cut four hard-boiled pggs the long way into four pieces, and lay them in rows, with green pickles between each row. Roll up the veal tightly, and sew it; then put it into a cloth, and bind it with tape. Lay a slice of ham over it, and put it into a sauce-pan, together with some strong stock, and a little whole pepper, and stew it for three hours. Make a rich gravy, and boil it up with a little white wine and lemon juice or lemon pickle; pour it over the veal; add someTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 115 egg and forcemeat balls, and garnish with cut green pick - les.

Half an hour before serving, add a little anchovy liquor. Gar- nish with cut lemon and curled parsley. Another way to Stew a Breast of Veal. Cut out the blade bone, and stuff the hole with a nice forcemeat; sew it up, half roast it, and make a quart of gravy of the bones and trimmings; season it with whole pepper, two blades of mace, a bit of lemon peel, a large onion, some salt, and a bunch of parsley. Strain and thicken it with butter rolled in flour; put in the veal, and a table-spoonful of vinegar; let it stew nearly two hours. A little before serving, add a table-spoonful of lemon pickle, and a glass of white wine. Forcemeat balls may be served with it. Another way to Stew a Breast of Veal. Cut off the short bones or gristles of a breast of veal; stew them in a little white stock, with a slice of ham, an onion, stuck with one or two cloves, some whole pepper, a bunch of parsley, and a little salt. When ten- der, take out the meat, strain the stock, and put it on with a pint and a half of green peas ; boil them, and add the veal, and let them stew for twenty minutes. Serve the gristles in the middle, and the peas round them. Another way to Stew a Breast of Veal, With Green Peas. Make a quart of gravy with the scrag end ; strain it; cut the rest of the veal into small pieces of nearly an equal size; put it into a stew-pan, with the gravy, some pepper, salt, mace, half an#ounce of butter, and a quartTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 116 of green peas.

Add some minced capers and small mushrooms; pour it quite hot over the veal. Garnish with sliced lemon. To Stew a Fillet of Veal. Bone, lard, and stuff a fillet of veal; half roast, and then stew it with two quarts of white stock, a tea-spoon- ful of lemon pickle and one of mushroom catsup. Before serving, strain the gravy, thicken it with butter rolled in flour, add a little cayenne, salt, and some pickled mush- rooms ; heat it, and pour it over the veal. Have ready two or three dozen of forcemeat balls to put round it and upon the top. Garnish with cut lemon. Veal Cutlets. Cut a neck of veal into cutlets, or take them off a leg. Season two well-beaten eggs with pounded mace, nut- meg, salt, pepper, and finely chopped sweet maijo- ram, lemon thyme, and parsley; dip the cutlets into it, sift over them grated bread, and fry them in clarified but- ter. Serve with a white sauce, forcemeat balls, and small mushrooms. Garnish with fried parsley. Another way to Dress Veal Cutlets.

Dip the cutlets into the butter, and then into finely-grated bread, seasoned with pepper andTUFiiPRACTICE OF COOKERY. 117 salt; broil them of a brown colour; mince the peel of half a Seville orange pared very thin; add it and a grate of ginger to some good thickened gravy, and pour it hot upon the cutlets. % Another way to Dress Veal Cutlets. Cut them off a leg, or from the thick part of a loin of veal; beat them a little with a rolling-pin, and fry them in butter of a light brown. Take them out of the pan, pour off' the butter, and strew over them grated bread, seasoned with minced parsley and lemon thyme, grated lemon peel and nutmeg, white pepper, and salt. Put them into a stew-pan, with a piece of fresh butter, and let them fry slowly till of a good brown. Add a quarter of a pint of good gravy, and a small tea-cupful of thick cream ; let all be made very hot, frequently shaking the pan. Serve it garnished with cut lemon or forcemeat balls, mush- rooms, and false eggs. False eggs are made of the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, which are rubbed smooth, and then made up with fresh butter into the form of small eggs, Veal Cutlets h la V^nitienne. Cut into neat cutlets the best part of a neck of veal; trim and flatten them. Chop separately half a pint of mushrooms, a few shalots, and a little parsley; stew these over a slow fire, with a small bit of butter and a little rasped fat bacon. When done, put in the cutlets, and season them well with pepper and salt, and let them stew over a slow fire till quite tender; skim off’ the fat, and add a spoonful of sauce tournee, and the yolks of three eggs beaten with a little cream, then mix in the juice of a lemon and a little cayenne. To Collar a Breast of Veal. Bone it, and lay over it a thick layer of forcemeat, made with bread crumbs, chopped oysters, parsley, and grated ham, seasoned with lemon peel, salt, white pep- per, and nutmeg, mixed with an egg beaten up. Roll and bind it with a tape; boil it in a cloth, and put it on inTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 118 boiling water; let it boil gently for three hours. Boil the bones with an onion, a bunch of sweet herbs, salt, and white pepper; strain and thicken it with three table- spoonfuls of cream, the yolks of two eggs beaten up, and a bit of butter mixed with flour. Parboil and slice the sweetbread, dip it into an egg, and strew over it grated bread ; fry it with forcemeat balls. Serve the veal with the sauce poured over it. Garnish with the sweetbread and forcemeat balls. To Collar Veal. Bone a breast of veal, and beat it flat; cover the in- side with a nice stuffing moistened with eggs ; roll it very tightly, bind it, and bake it in an oven with some weak stock in the dish. Make a rich gravy; strain and thick- en it, and pour it over the veal. Serve with or without forcemeat balls, and garnish with cut lemon. It will keep for a long time, in a pickle made with bran and water, a little 6alt, and vinegar, poured cold over it. Neck of Veal k la Chreme. Cut the bones short of a small breast of veal, and skewer the flank underneath, and make the joint as square as possible. Lay it for two hours in oil, with chopped parsley, sliced shalots, pepper, salt, thyme, and bay leaves. Fold it in buttered paper, and fasten it upon the spit, so as to preserve the square form ; roast it about an hour and a quarter; take off" the paper, baste it with, and pour over it, a thick veloute sauce. Neck of Veal a la Barbarie. Trim a neck of veal neatly; lard it in chequers, with black truffles cut into nails. Stew the neck the same way as a fricandeau, putting bacon over the top, that the colour of the veal and truffles may he preserved. When done, glaze it slightly, and serve it with a sauce Italienne, with truffles.119 THE PUACTJCE OF COOKERY. Croquets. Pound, in a marble mortar, cold veal and fowl, with a little suet, some chopped lemon peel, lemon thyme, chives, and parsley. Season with nutmeg, and pepper and salt; mix all well together, and add the yolk of an egg well beaten ; roll it into balls, and dip them into an egg beaten up, then sift bread crumbs over them, and fry them in butter. Kidney Toasts. Pound, in a marble mortar, the kidney and the sur- rounding fat, season with pepper, salt, grated lemon peel, and nutmeg; mix with it the yolk of an egg well beaten, lay it upon thin toasted bread, cut into square bits. Put a little butter in a dish, lay into the kidney toasts, and browrn them in an oven. Serve them very hot. Kidney Cakes. Mix, together with a beaten egg, equal quantities of gra- ted bread, and the fat and lean part of a cold kidney of veal, very finely minced, and seasoned with pepper and salt; form it into small cakes,' fry them in boiling lard or butter, drain them upon the back of a sieve before the fire, and serve them garnished with fried parsley. The lean part of cold roasted veal may be substituted for the lean part of the kidney. Fricandeau of Veal. Cut a piece of veal from the leg, the same in width and depth, and about eight inches in length. Make a hole in the under part, and fill it with forcemeat; sew it up, lard the top and sides, cover it with slices of fat ba- con, and then with white paper. Put into a sauce-pan some slices of undressed mutton, three onions and one carrot sliced, a bunch of sweet herbs, and a quart of good stock; put in the veal, cover the pan closely, and let it stew for three hours. Take out the veal, strain the gra- vy, and take off all the fat; add a table-spoonful of lemonTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 120 pickle, and three of white wine; boil it quick to a glaze ; keep the fricandeau over hot water and covered, then glaze it, and serve with the rest of the glaze poured round it, and sorrel sauce, in a sauce tureen. Another way to make a Fricandeau of Veal. Cut some slices of veal, lard them all through, and put them into a sauce-pan with some white stock, and a hit of ham, one onion, a little mace and pepper. Stew them gently an hour and a half; take them out, strain the gravy, and take off all the fat; boil it up quickly, lay in the fricandeau, and stew them till the liquor becomes like a brown jelly, take care they do not burn. Scald in boiling water three handfuls of sorrel, chop it, take out the meat, and make the sorrel hot in the sauce, and serve the fricandeau upon it. Another way to make a Fricandeau of Veal. Chop very finely one pound of the lean of a loin of veal, and half a pound of the kidney fat; season it with white pepper, salt, grated lemon peel, the juice of one lemon, and a finely-shred anchovy. Soak, in boiling milk, two rusks, or biscuits, and mix it all well together; make it into balls, with a little flour. Fry them of a light brown, in butter, then stew them in some highly- seasoned gravy, dish them carefully, and strain the gravy over them. Garnish with cut lemon. Veal Cake, to be eaten cold. Pound in a mortar as much cold roasted lean veal as will fill a small mould, together with a slice of ham, or bacon, a piece of the crumb of bread soaked in cold milk, two beaten eggs, a small bit of butter, the same of shalot, or onion; season with pepper and salt, and mix all well together; butter the mould, fill it and bake it in an oven for about an hour; turn it out when cold, and cut it into slices. Garnish with pickled eggs and parsley.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 121 Minced Fowl, with Veal. Mince the white part of a cold roasted or boiled fowl; put it, and some thin slices of veal, into a sauce-pan, also some white stock, a squeeze of a lemon, a few drops of shalot vinegar, and a dust of sugar ; simmer it for a short time, and serve it upon bread sippets, with the slices of veal laid on the mince. Potted Calf’s Feet. Bon. the feet as for jelly, pick all the meat from the bones, add to it half a pint of gravy, a little salt, pepper, and nutmeg, garlic, a shalot, and some shred ham ; sim- mer it for half an hour, dip a mould into water, put in a layer of the meat, then some neatly-cut pickled beet-root, and some boiled minced parsley, then a layer of meat, and so on, till the mould be filled; when cold, turn it out. Garnish with pickled eggs, beet-root, and parsley. Calf’s Feet, plain. Scald, clean, and blanch some calves’ feet, boil them till the bones will come out, then stew them in a blanch. See Calf’s Head, plain, p. 122. When done, drain and serve them with parsley and butter. Veal Olives. Cut thin slices off a fillet, and flatten them with a roller ; season them highly with white pepper, mace, salt, and grated lemon peel ; put a bit of fat into each roll, and tie them with a thread. Fry them of a light brown, and stew them in some white stock, with two dozen of fried oysters, a glass of white wine, a table-spoonful of lemon pickle, and some small mushrooms. Stew them nearly an hour; take off the threads before serving. Beef Olives may be dressed in the same way. Minuten Fleish. Cut from off a leg of veal some slices as thin as the blade of a knife, and about four inches long; seasonTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 122 them with pepper and Balt, lay them into a deep dish, pour over them nearly half a pint of white wine, let it stand for three hours. Cover the bottom of a stew-pan with butter, dredge each slice of the veal on both sides w'ith flour, add a little more wine, and as much good white stock as will cover it, and the juice of a lemon. Cover the pan closely, and let it simmer five minutes, and serve it instantly, otherwise it will become hard. Minced Veal. Cut thin slices of lean cold veal; mince them very finely with a knife, and season with white pepper, salt, grated lemon peel and nutmeg ; put it into a sauce-pan, with a little white stock, or water, a table-spoonful of lemon pickle, and a little mushroom powder. Simmer, but do not let it boil; add a hit of butter rolled in flour, and a little milk, or cream ; put all round the dish thin sippets of bread cut into a three-cornered shape ; or, cover the mince thickly with grated bread, seasoned with white pepper, salt, and a little butter, and browm it with a sala- mander ; or serve with poached eggs laid upon the top. Calf’s Head, Plain. Clean a calf’s head nicely, and cut out the bone of the lower jaw, and of the nose, taking out the nose bone as close to the eyes as possible ; wash the head w'ell in warm water, and let it blanch in some clean water. Pre- pare a blanc, or sauce, as follows: One pound of beef suet, and one pound of fat bacon, cut small, half a pound of butter, a bunch of parsley, a little thyme, two or three bay leaves, one or two onions, and the juice of a lemon ; season with 6alt, pepper, mace, cloves, and allspice ; boil all this an hour in six pints of wnter, then tie up the head in a cloth, boil it in the sauce about three hours, and drain it; take out the tongue, skin, and replace it; serve quite hot, with the following sauce—minced shalots, pars- ley, the brains minced, some vinegar, salt, and pepper. Dressed Calf’s Head. To take the hair off the head, first wash it clean, andTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 123 put it on the fire with plenty of cold water; let it boil a little time, try if the hair will pull off easily, if not, boil it till it does, then lay it into cold water to blanch ; take off the skin and cut it into hits an inch and a half square, cut what meat is on the head into thin slices, pick out the black part of the eyes, and cut the remainder into rings ; cut'the ears like small straws, skin the tongue, and cut it lengthways, or leave it whole, put the brains carefully upon a plate. Make a sauce of a quart of good gravy, thicken it with butter and flour; season with half the peel of a lemon and the juice, two blades of mace, or gra- ted nutmeg and cayenne ; put in the head, and let it stew till tender, add forcemeat balls, fried brown, a few hard- boiled yolks of eggs, and a glass of white wine. Garnish with brain-cakes, made as follows :— Beat up the brains with a knife, pick out all the skin and strings, mix with them two table-spoonfuls of flour, a grate of lemon peel, a little white pepper, and salt, two eggs, wfell beaten, and half a pint of milk ; fry them in butter, dropping them in with a spoon, so as to make them the size of a crown-piece. Lay them before the fire upon the back of a sieve, to drain and brown a little. To make a simple white gravy, that answers very well, take the bones of the head, chopping away the nose, put them into a stew-pan \yith a quart of water, an onion, some w’hole pepper, and salt, a little winter savory, and lemon thyme ; let it stew nearly two hours, strain it, put in the prepared head. Another way to make Dressed Calf’s Head. Scald and clean a calf’s head very'nicely, and with a sharp knife cut all the meat entire from the bone, cut out the tongue, and carefully take out the brains ; lay it all in cold water for two or three hours. Mince very small two pounds of lean veal, and one pound of beef suet, with t)ie grated crumb of a penny loaf, some sweet herbs, grated lemon peel, nutmeg, pepper, and salt; mix them well together, and bind it with the yolks of four eggs beaten up; reserve as much of the forcemeat as will124 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. make twenty small balls; wash the head clean, wipe it dry, and put the forcemeat into the inside; close it, and tie it firmly with tape; put it into a stew-pan with two quarts of gravy, half a pint of white wine, and a bunch of sweet herbs ; cover it closely, and let it stew gently ; boil the tongue, cut it into thin slices, mince the brains with a little parsley and a table-spoonful of flour, add some pepper, salt, grated lemon peel, and nutmeg ; beat two eggs and mix with the brains, drop it with a spoon in small cakes into a pan of boiling dripping, and fry them of a light-brown colour. Fry the forcemeat balls, and drain them, with the cakes, upon the back of a sieve before the fire ; when the head has stewed till it be suf- ficiently tender, put it into a dish and take off the tape, strain the gravy, and thicken it with a table-spoonful of flour of rice, and a little bit of butter ; if not well season- ed, add more salt and pepper, put in the tongue, make it all hot, and pour it over the head. Garnish with the brain-cakes, forcemeat balls, and cut lemon. To Roast a Calf’s Head. Wash and clean it well, parboil it, take out the bones, brains, and tongue; make forcemeat sufficient for the head, and some balls with bread crumbs, minced suet, parsley, grated ham, and a little pounded veal, or cold fowl; season with pepper, salt, grated nutmeg, and le- mon peel; bind it with an egg, beaten up, fill the head with it, which must then be sewed up, or fastened with skewers and tied. While roasting, baste it well with but- ter ; beat up the brains with a little cream, the yolk of an egg, some minced parsley, a little pepper, and salt; blanch the tongue, cut it into slices, and fry it with the brains, forcemeat balls, and thin slices of bacon. Serve the head with white or brown thickened gravy, and place the tongue, forcemeat balls, and brains round it. Garnish with cut lemon. It will require one hour and a half to roast.125 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Calf’s Head Bigarde. Clean and blanch a calf’s head, boil it till the hones will come out easily, then hone and press it between two dishes, so as to give it an oblong form; beat with the yolks of four eggs a little melted butter, pepper, and salt. Divide the head when cold, and brush it all over with the beaten eggs, and strew over it grated bread ; repeat this twice. With the grated bread, which is put over one half, a good quantity of finely-minced parsley should be mixed ; place the head upon a dish, and bake it of a nice brown colour. Serve it with a sauce of parsley and butter, and with one of good gravy, mixed with the brains which have been previously boiled, and chopped and seasoned with a little cayenne and salt. To Plain Boil a Calf’s Head. Split the head and take out carefully the brains and tongue, wash the head well, and let it lie twro or three hours in cold wrater. Boil it with the tongue and brains gently in plenty of water, till it be quite tender; take out the bones, and pour over the head parsley and butter made very thick; rub the brains through a sieve; add to them a little chopped parsley, some pepper, salt, flour, and butter; mix all wrell together, and put it round the tongue, which may be served as a comer dish, or it may be salted. When salted, the brains, with the addition of a little butter and chopped parsley, may be put over the head, or served in a sauce tureen. Calf’s Brains, with Fried Parsley. Blanch three or four brains, of nearly an equal size; parboil them, and take off the skin; then boil them in water, with a little salt, vinegar, and butter. Serve them with a sauce made of a little broumed butter, a table- spoonful of vinegar, some salt and pepper, and some pars- ley fried very green.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 126 To Dress Calves’ Ears. Cut the ears of two calves deep at the bottom, and even, so that they may stand ; clean and wash them well, and boil them till tender in milk and water; fill them with a nice forcemeat, tie them with thread, and stew them in a little of the liquor they were boiled in ; season it with pepper, salt, mace, and a small onion minced. Be- fore serving, thicken the sauce with the yolk of an egg beaten up in a little cream. Boudin a la Reine. Cut the meat of cold roasted veal, or that of fowls, in- to dice; season, and heat it in a veloute sauce. When cold, form it into rolls the length of the dish; dip them into beaten eggs, and then into grated bread; repeat this, and let them be completely covered with the grated bread; fry them of a fine brown colour, drain, and serve them with fried parsley laid between each. To Pot Veal. Cut slices off a leg of veal, and season them with white pepper, pounded mace, cloves, and salt. Lay thin slices of fresh butter between each layer of meat into a potting pan or jar.; cover it closely, and bake it with bread. When it is cold, pound the meat in a marble mor- tar, pack it closely into a jar, and pour clarified butter over it. Veal Cones. Mince small one pound and a half of cold veal, two ounces of butter, and a slice of lean ham ; pound them in a mortar, and mix, in five table-spoonfuls of cream, two tea-spoonfuls of white pepper, one of salt, and some gra- ted lemon peel. Make it up into cones about three inches high; rub them over with an egg beaten up, sift grated bread over them, and fry them ,of a light brown colour; put fried bread crumbs into the dish, and place the cone9 upon them, or serve them with a brown gravy instead of127 THE PRACTICE OP COOKERY. crumbs. Cold fowl, turkey, or rabbit make good cones. Half the ingredients will be sulficient for a corner dish. Pyramids of Rice. Boil some whole rice, make it up into the form of py- ramids about three inches high, or press it into small tin frames of that shape; take out part of the rice at the bot- tom, and fill the space with sausage, or rich forcemeat; place them in a dish, take off the frame, and pour round them some rich brown gravy. Casserole of Rice. Having cleaned and drained about half a pound of rice, moisten it in a stew-pan, with some fat, that which gathers on the top of liquor in which meat has been boil- ed, strain some broth or soup, add to it a large quantity of grease, some pieces of fat bacon, and a little salt, and mix it with the rice, to make it swell as much as possi- ble ; stir it frequently over a slow fire to keep it from sticking; when it is soft, strain it through a cullender, and press it well with a wooden spoon. The mould being selected for the casserole, rinse it with the fat drained from the rice, taking care that every part of the inside of the mould be well greased, then cover it with rice, and place a piece of the crumb of bread in the mid- dle, and cover it with rice also ; press it in equally with a spoon, and let it cool. When the rice has become firm, dip the outside of the mould into boiling water; put a covering of paste made with flour and water, flatten it all round with a spoon, and make an opening in the top with a knife, then put it into the oven, which cannot be too hot for a casserole, baste it with the grease, and when it has become of a fine colour, take it out of the oven, remove the crust, and take out the bread care- fully, so that the casserole may not be injured; next re- move some of the rice from the inside, taking care to leave enough to resist the weight of whatever may be put inside of it. Fill it with minced meat, ragout, blan- quette, fricassee of chickens, macaroni, or scollops of128 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. fish, that have been already served at table; return it to the oven, and when nicely browned, serve it. Cassolettes of Rice. The rice prepared as above may be put into smaller moulds, those called dariole moulds, and it should be quite cold before it is turned out, the mince or whatever is put inside being also cold ; it must be put in carefully, that none of it may mix with the rice, otherwise the cas- solettes would break in the process of frying ; for the same reason, the dripping must be very hot. Frying is the best and quickest method of doing them, but they may also be browned in the oven as the casserole of rice. Casserole of Potatoes. Boil and peel some good mealy potatoes, pound them, and mix with them some butter, cream, and a little salt, put them about an inch and a half high upon a flat dish, and leave an opening in the centre ; bake them of a light brown colour, and take out as much from the centre as will admit of a ragout, fricassee, or macaroni, being put into it. Rissoles. Mince very finely some cold roasted veal, and a small bit of bacon ; season it with grated nutmeg and salt; moisten itwith cream, and make it up into good-sized balls; dip them into the yolks of eggs beaten up, and then into finely grated bread. Bake them in an oven, or fry them of a light brown colour in fresh dripping. Before serving, drain them before the fire on the back of a sieve. Gar- nish with fried parsley. Kebobbed Veal. Cut into thin bits the size of a crown-piece some lean veal; season them with turmeric, pepper, and salt. Slice onions very thinly, and some garlic: put the slices of veal and onion upon a skewer, together with thin bits of 4125) THE PII ACT ICE OF COOKERY. pickled pork. Fry them brown with butter, and garnish with plenty of fried parsley. Cutcharee. Boil a quarter of a pound of split peas till they be tender; drain them in a cullender. Wash very clean a pound of rice; chop the peas finely, mix them with the rice, and season with a little turmeric. Fry in an ounce and a half of butter, a minced onion, and of cloves, mace, cardamum, and black pepper, when pounded, half a tea- spoonful each; stir them constantly, to prevent their burning. Season a quart of veal stock with salt and pep- per ; put in the rice and the fried onion and spices; co- ver the stew-pan closely, and let it simmer till the rice becomes tender and dry. Serve it with a cup of oiled butter. Calf’s Liver Larded and Roasted. Lard a fine calf’s liver the same as a fricandeau, and let it lie for twenty-four hours in vinegar, with a sliced onion, some parsley, a little thyme, a bay leaf, some salt and pepper. Roast and baste it well with butter, then glaze it with a light glaze, and serve it with a poivrade, or any other sauce. Scollops of Calf’s Liver. Parboil and cut into slices a very nice calf’s liver, and shape them into hearts. Stew some fine herbs, pars- ley, shalots, and mushrooms ; then add the calf’s liver, and let it stew over a slow fire; when done on one side, turn and season it with pepper and salt; take out the liver, dredge in a little flour over the herbs, and add some more gravy; let this boil fur ten minutes, then heat the liver in the sauce before serving it. This may be eaten at breakfast. Calf’s Pluck. Wash it very clean, and, if liked, stuff the heart with a forcemeat, made of crumbs of bread, butter, and pars- i130 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. leyj and seasoned with pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg. Fasten it firmly with the liver and lights, tying them to the skewers while roasting ; haste it well with butter, and froth it the same way in which veal is done, and serve it with melted butter, mixed with a table-spoonful of lemon pickle, or vinegar poured over it. To broil a Sweetbread. Parboil it, rub it with butter, and broil it over a slow fire, turn it frequently, and baste it now and then, by putting it upon a plate kept warm by the fire with butter in it. Sweetbreads a la Dauphine. If for a round dish, take four large and fine sweet- breads. If for a long dish, three will suffice. Pare off the fat and sinews, and blanch them in warm water, par- boil them, and when cold, lard them. Rub a stew-pan with fresh butter, and put into it a few sliced carrots and onions, then a layer of slices of fat bacon, place the sweet- breads upon the bacon, sprinkle a little salt over them, and stew them with a great deal of fire on the top, and a very slow one beneath ; when they are nicely brown- ed, cover them with a piece of buttered paper, cut round, and lessen the fire upon the top. They will require to stew for three quarters of an hour, then drain and put them into a pan, with some glaze, and the bacon under- neath. Leave them in the glaze till dinner time, drain them again, glaze them of a fine brown, and serve them with sorrel or endive. Italian Attelets of Sweetbreads. Blanch some nice sweetbreads, and stew them in a well-seasoned gravy, made of meat and vegetables ; when cold, cut them into pieces of nearly an inch square, put them into a sauce d’attelets, and let them cool. With silver skewers, skewer the sweetbreads, and a bit of ready-dressed calf’s udder alternately; make them all as much as possible of an equal size, and of a square form.131 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Moisten them with the sauce, and cover them with grated bread, then dip. them into four well-beaten eggs, strew over them some more grated bread, and level it with a knife; fry them of a fine brown, and serve with an Italian sauce, white or brown. If the attelets are ready before they are required to be fried, strew grated bread over the cover of a stew-pan, and lay them upon it. Small Cases of Scollops of Sweetbreads. Blanch and parboil some fine sweetbreads, cut them into small scollops. Then chop separately, and finely, half a pint of mushrooms, a little parsley, and four or five shalots, add a little fat bacon rasped, and a piece of fresh butter; season the scollops with pepper, salt, and a little mace,stew it all together over a slow fire; when done,drain off the fat, place the scollops in small paper cases, which have been fried in olive oil, cover them with plenty of finely chopped herbs, and strew over them fried bread crumbs ; lay the paper cases for a moment into the oven, and before serving, pour into each a little rich gravy, and a little lemon juice. Croquets of Sweetbreads. Mince some cold sweetbreads, which have been dress- ed, and boil them in a sauce veloute ; when quite cold, form them into balls, or into rolls, about two inches long; fry and serve them with fried parsley in the mid- dle. Or, make the croquet meat into a rissole. Roll out a piece of thin puff-paste, enclose the meat in it, brush it over with a beaten egg, and strew over it grated bread; fry it of a light-brown colour. To dress Cold Veal. Mince finely the fat and lean of cold roast veal, sea- son it with grated nutmeg, lemon peel, white pepper, and salt; moisten it with a little rich white stock, and a beaten egg; butter a pudding, shape, put in the mince, and press it firmly, cover it closely, and set it into a pan132 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. of boiling water; let it boil an hour or two. Serve it with a white gravy thickened, or when turned out of the shape, rub it over the top with the beaten yolk of an egg; sift bread crumbs thickly over, and brown it in a Dutch oven; baste it with a little melted butter. Gar- nish with fried parsley or cut lemon. Calf’s Chitterlings, or Fraise. Cut them open with scissors, wash and cleanse them thoroughly, lay them for a night into salt and water, then wash them well, parboil, and cut them into small pieces, dip them into a thick batter, seasoned with pepper, salt, and a little white wine. Fry them of a light-brown co- lour in beef dripping; serve with a fringe ol' fried parsley. °r, After being parboiled, they may be roasted, when they must be constantly basted with butter, dredged with flour to froth them nicely; then served with melted but- ter, and lemon pickle poured over them. Or, They may be baked—when, after being parboiled, they are rubbed over with butter, and put into the oven on an iron frame, which is placed in a deep dish. This oblong frame of white iron, about two inches high, will be found useful in baking every kind of meat. Savoury Cabbage. Pound, in a marble mortar, about two pounds of veal, a large slice of ham, two shalots, and a quarter of a pound of fresh beef suet; season with white and cayenne pepper, nutmeg, lemon peel, salt, and some parsley and lemon thyme finely minced; beat all well together till thoroughly mixed, and add the well-beaten yolks of three eggs. Wash and clean a large head of cabbage, take out the heart and stuff' it with the above ingredients; roll it in a clotb, and sew it tightly; boil it slowly for three hours, and serve it with a white sauce. Potatoe Patties. Wash and scrape off the rind of four or five large133 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. potatoes, cut oft’ the top, and scrape out the inside ; mix a part of it with a little pounded veal and ham; add a little cream, nutmeg, lemon peel, salt, and pepper, and a little mushroom catsup. Put this mixture into the pat- ties, put on the top, and place them upright in a pudding dish, with a little butter in the bottom of it; bake them in an oven; a little bit cut off the bottom of each will make them stand even.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 134 CHAPTER VII. PORK. The names of the various pieces are : IN ENGLAND. Fore quarter: Spare Rib—Hand—Belly, or Spring. Hind Quarter: Fore Loin—Hind Loin, which, if too long, a spare rib may be cut off—Leg. IN SCOTLAND. Spare Rib—Breast and Shoulder—Sirloin—The Ham or Gigot. The entrails are named the liver, crow, kidney, skirts, sometimes called the harslet, also the chitterlings or guts. PREPARATORY REMARKS ON PORK. Dairy-fed pork is the best; the flesh should look white and smooth, and the fat be white and fine. In pre- paring a hog for bacon, the ribs are cut, with a very little flesh on them, from the side, which has the fore and hind leg attached to it; the hind leg is then called a gammon of bacon, but it is generally reserved for a ham. On each side there is a large spare rib, which is usually divided into two, one called the sweet bone, the other the blade bone. There are also griskins, chine, or back bone.135 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Hog’s lard is the inner fat of the bacon hog. Porkers are not so old as hogs; they make excellent pickled pork, but are chosen more particularly for roast- ing. To roast a leg, a small onion is minced together with three sage leaves, seasoned with pepper and salt, and put under the skin at the knuckle bone; the skin is cut into strips nearly half an inch apart, and rubbed over with a bit of butter. If weighing seven or eight pounds, it will require nearly three hours to roast. A spare rib should be roasted, is basted with butter, and has sage leaves dried, rubbed to a powder, and mix- ed with salt and pepper, sprinkled over it. Both a loin and neck are jointed, the skin scored in nar- row strips, and rubbed with butter. If weighing six or seven pounds, it will require rather more than two hours to roast. A griskin may be either broiled or roasted. A chine is stuffed here and there with bread crumbs, mixed with a little butter, and seasoned with some finely shred sage, parsley, and thyme, some pepper and salt. The skin is cut into strips, and rubbed with butter; it is then roasted, and served with apple sauce, as are also the preceding roasts. A porker’s head is stuffed like a sucking pig, sewed firmly, and hung on a string to roast. The shoulder may be roasted, but, being very fat, it is generally preferred pickled. The breast may be made into a pie, or broiled. To boil hams, they should be put on in water, the chill taken off, and simmered for four or five hours, ta- king care not to allow them to boil.the practice of ookery. 13 0 Westphalia Ham. Rub each ham well with an ounce and a half of pound- ed saltpetre, and an equal quantity of coarse brown sugar. The following day, boil, in a quart of strong'stale beer or porter, a pound of bay salt, the same of common salt, half a pound of coarse brown sugar, of pounded black pepper and cloves an ounce each, and a small bit of salt piunel- la. Pour it boiling hot over the ham, and let it lie a fort- night, rubbing and turning it twice or thrice daily, when it should be smoked for a fortnight. To Cure Hams. Sprinkle a ham weighing eighteen pounds or up. wards with a little common salt, and let it lie a day; then rub it well with one ounce of ground black pepper, and one ounce of pounded saltpetre. Let it lie another day, then rub in a pound of bay, and a pound of common salt. In two hours, pour over it a pound of treacle, and let it lie for three weeks or a month, according to the size of the ham, turning and rubbing it daily. Let it lie in cold water for four-and-twenty hours, then hang it for a fort- night up a chimney where wood or turf is burnt. Another way to Cure Hams. To each ham allow the following ingredient-s, finely pounded: one pound of bay, and half a pound of com- mon salt, two ounces of saltpetre, and one ounce of black pepper. Rub the mixture well into the ham, turning it daily for four days, and then pour over it one pound and a half of treacle, and let it lie for four weeks, turning it daily, and basting it frequently with the pickle. Lay it for four-and-twenty hours into cold water. Smoke it for a fortnight, and bury it with malt dust in a box. It ought to be kept three or four months before it is used, and should not be soaked before boiling. Another way to Cure Hams. Lor two hams weighing sixteen pounds each, allow137 TilL PRACTICE UF COOKERY. one pound and a quarter of brown sugar, three ounces of powdered saltpetre, one pound of bay salt, the same of common salt, two or three heads of garlic pounded. Mix all together, and rub it into the hams; let them lie for three or four weeks, turning and rubbing them daily, when they may be dried in the kitchen, or smoked for a fort- night. Another wav to Cure Hams. Pound two ounces of saltpetre, one ounce of black pepper, and one pound of bay salt. Rub it over the ham, and let it lie four days, turning it daily, then pour over it a pound and a half of treacle. Baste it daily for a month, then put it in cold water for twenty-four hours. Wipe it dry, and sew it in a piece of old linen. Hang it up in a chimney where wood is burnt. Another way to Cure Hams.

Soak in water for two hours a Bayonne, or any other fine ham, boil it for two hours, trim it quickly, and then put it into a stew-pan, with thin slices of veal at the bot- tom • add some carrots and parsley, and sea sTces Pour over the ham a pint of rich stock and a bot- tle of Madeira; let it boil for two hours, strain and skim the "fat off the skucc, which, with the ham, must he aefve.l quite hot.138 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. To Collar a Pig’s Cheek. Strew over a pig’s face, and a neat’s or pig’s tongue, a little salt and saltpetre; let it stand eight or nine days, then boil them with two cow-heels, till all be sufficiently tender to admit of the bones being taken out; lay upon a dish a piece of strong cloth, put the cheek upon it with the rind downwards; season it highly with black and Ja- maica pepper, cloves, and a little salt; add the tongue and cow-heels, with more seasoning; roll and sew it up firmly, put it into a jar and boil it for two hours, then press it with a heavy weight, and when cold take off the cloth. The cow-heel may be omitted, and both cheeks used. lo Pot Pigs Head.

When to be used, moisten it with the yolk of an egg beaten, make it up in the form of sausages, flour them, and fry them in butter. Another way to Make Sausages. Chop together two pounds of lean pork, and one and a half of the inward fat of the pig, the crumb of a penny loaf cut into slices and soaked in cold water; season with pepper, salt, grated nutmeg, lemon thyme, and a little sage. Mix all the ingredients well, and half fill the skins ; boil them half an hour. Spreadbury’s Sausages. Cut from the leg or griskin one pound of nice lean pork, free from sinews and skin, mince it very finely; mince one pound of the best beef suet, mix it with the pork, and pound it as finely as possible in a marble mor- tar; add two large table-spoonfuls of stale bread nibbed through a sieve, also a good deal of black pepper, salt, and a little finely-chopped sage, mix all together with the yolks of two eggs beaten up. It will keep for some time, if put into an earthen jar and pressed closely down. When it is to be used, make it into rolls, and as thick as common sausages, and three or four inches long; dust them with a, little flour; have ready a frying-pan made very hot, and fry them without any thing but their own fat, till they are done quite through, taking care not to make them too dry. I3y breaking one of them, the cook will know whether they are sufficiently done. They may be fried in lard or fresh beef dripping. To Cure Pig’s Cheek. Strew salt over it, and let it lie two or three days, then pour over it the following mixture when it is cold; half a pound of bay salt, half an ounce of saltpetre, a quar- ter of a pound of coarse brown sugar, one handful of common salt, and a pennyworth of cochineal, boiled in a pint of strong beer or porter; Jet it lie in the pickle a140 TIIE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. fortnight, turning it daily, then hang it to smoke for a week. When to be dressed, put it into lukewarm water to soak for a night, and in dressing it, follow the directions given for boiling hams. To Dress Pig’s Kidneys and Skirts. Clean and wash them very nicely, cut the kidneys across, and the skirts into small square bits; fry them a light brown in beef dripping, brown a bit of butter the size of a walnut, with a little flour, and add as much boil- ing water as may be required of gravy, and an onion minced small. Add the meat, a little pepper, salt, and mushroom catsup, and let it stew till tender. To Collar a Small Roasting Pig. Cut off the feet, head, and tail; bone and wash it well, and dry it in a cloth. Season it highly with a quantity of black pepper and salt; roll it up firmly, and bind it with a piece of linen; sew it tightly. Put it on in boil- ing water, with the bones, let it boil for an hour, then put it under a weight to press till it be cold, and take off the cloth. Hain Toasts. C> it ate some lean ham, mix with it the beaten yolk of an egg, and some pepper; fry it in clarified butter, put it on square bits of toast, and brown it with a salamander. Soused Pig’s Head and Feet. Clean them extremely well, and boil them; take for sauce part of the liquor, and add vinegar, lime or lemon juice, salt, cayenne, black, and Jamaica pepper; put in, either cut down or whole, the head and feet; boil all to- gether for an hour, and pour it into a deep dish. It is eaten cold with mustard and vinegar. To Roast a Sucking Pig. To kill the pig, stick it just above the breast bone, running the knife into the heart; plunge it for a minuteIll TiiE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. or two into cold water; rub it over with resin beaten ex- ceedingly fine ; it is sometimes rubbed with its blood be- fore the resin is put on ; dip it into a pail of scalding wa- ter, take it out, and rub off all the hair as quickly as pos- sible; if it should not all come off, repeat the scalding and rubbing with resin. When quite clean, wash it in warm, and frequently in cold water. Cut off the feet at the first joint; take out all the entrails ; put the pettitoes, heart, liver, and lights together. Wash the pig well in cold water, and dry it thoroughly. Make a stuffing of grated bread, butter, a small onion, and three or four sage leaves minced; season with pepper and salt, put it in- side, and sew it up. The pig being made perfectly dry, put the well-beaten white of an egg all over it with a feather. Put it down to roast before a very quick fire, and under it a small basin to catch the gravy. Do not flour it, and be sure to cover it well with the egg, which will crisp it nicely, and make it of a delicate light brown. It will take from one to two hours to roast. When done, cut off the head, part it and the body down the middle; mix with the chopped brains a little finely-minced boiled sage and some melted butter, add to it the gravy that- has ran from the pig, also mix with the stuffing some melted butter. Lay the pig on the dish, placing the shoulder of the one side to the hind quarter of the other. Observe in roasting the pig to skewer the legs back, so that the under part may be crisp. A pig prepared as above may be baked. Ham and Eggs. Cut some ham into thin slices, and broil them on a gridiron. Fry some eggs in butter. Serve it, laying an egg on each slice of ham. Pig’s Harslet. Parboil the liver and lights, slice and fry them along with thin bits of bacon. Garnish with fried parsley.142 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Pickled Leg of Pork. Salt it eight or ten days, turn and rub it daily. Be- fore being dressed, let it lie in cold water for half an hour; put it on in cold water; when it boils, take off the scum, and let it simmer till done. ' If weighing seven or eight pounds, it will take nearly three hours to boil. Serve with peas-pudding and boiled greens. About two or three pounds of pickled pork will require to be sim- mered for an hour and a half. Pork Steaks. Cut them off a neck or loin, trim them neatly, and pepper them; broil them over a clear fire, turning them frequently; they will take twenty minutes. Sprinkle them with a little salt before serving. Black Paddings. Throw a little salt into the blood while it is warmr and stir it till it become cold ; boil in milk till quite ten- der two quarts of half grits. When nearly cold, put in the inward fat of the pig cut into pieces the size of a small nutmeg; season with pepper, salt, cloves, and mace; of herbs, parsley, sweet marjoram, winter savory, penny- royal, and leeks, all finely minced. Mix them with the grits and fat, and add a sufficiency of the blood to make it of a dark colour. The skins or guts must be very well washed, and when perfectly cleansed, laid into salt and water the night before. When they are to be filled, tie one end, and turn the inside out; half fill them, tie them of equal lengths or in rounds ; put them into hot water, and when they have boiled five minutes, take them out, prick them with a large needle, and then boil them half an h<£kr. When they are cold, hang them up in a cool dry place. Another way to make Black Puddings.. Prepare the blood as before directed, and to a pint and a half allow six ounces of rice boiled in a quart of milk till it be tender, the grated crumb of a lnlf-quar-THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 143 tom loaf. Season with black pepper, salt, cloves, and maco; of herbs, parsley, savory, pennyroyal, a little sage and onions, all finely minced; one pound of beef suet chopped very fine, a small quantity of the inward fat of the pig finely cut, and four eggs well beaten and strained. Mix all these ingredients together, and stir in the blood. Divide it into three puddings, and boil them in pudding- cloths floured. When they are to be used, heat them whole in a Dutch oven, or cut them into slices, and broil them upon a gridiron, or they may be put into the skins. A Collar of Brawn. Wash, scrape, and clean very thoroughly a large pig’s head, feet, and ears ; lay them into salt and water, with a little saltpetre, for three hours. To make the collar larger, boil two ox heels, with the head, feet, and ears, till all the bones can be taken out easily, then put the head round the mould, and the feet and small pieces into the middle ; put it together while hot, and press it with a heavy weight till it become cold. Boil, for half an hour, in as much of the liquor as will cover the brawn, one handful of salt, one ounce of pepper, black and white mixed, and one or two bay leaves. When cold, pour it over the brawn. Mock Brawn. Take the blade bone out of the shoulder, and boil it gently two hours or more, according to the age of the boar. When it is cold, season it very highly with black pepper, cayenne, salt, a very little allspice, minced onion, and thyme. Let it lie a night in this seasoning; the follow- ing day, make a savoury forcemeat of pounded veal, ham, beef suet, minced parsley, thyme, and an onion, a little lerffcm peel, salt, “nutmeg, white pepper, and cayenne; bind it with an egg beaten, and stuff where the bone has been taken out. Put it into a deep pan with the brown side downwards, and lay under it twigs or small sticks, to keep it from sticking to the bottom; pour in a bottle of beer, and put it into the oven. When nearly done, take it out and clear off all the fat, add a hottle of Madeira andTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 141 0 ' the juice of a large lemon, return it to the oven, aiul bake it till it become as tender as a jelly, so that a straw will pierce it easily. If the hoar is an old one, it will require to he baked six or seven hours. This dish is eaten hot. To Stew Pig’s Feet. Clean them well, and boil them till they are tender. Brown some butter with flour, and add it to a quantity of gravy or water sufficient to stew the feet in. Season with a minced onion, three sage leaves, salt, and black and Jamaica pepper. Cut the feet into two, add them, and cover the pan closely; let them stew half an hour. A little before serving, mix in half a table-spoonful of lemon pickle or vinegar, and pick out the sage leaves. Pettitoes. Parboil them with the liver, heart, and lights; mince the liver, heart, and lights small, simmer it in some gravy or a little of the water, with a bit of butter mixed with flour. Season with pepper, salt, and one or two sage leaves minced; and having split the feet into two, add them, and when they become tender, mix in a tea-spoonful of vinegar. Serve the mince with the pettitoes upon it, and garnish with sippets of bread. Pork Cheese. Choose the head of a small pig which may weigh about twelve pounds the quarter. Sprinkle over it and the tongues of four pigs, a little common salt and a very little saltpetre. Let them lie four days, wash them, and tie them in a clean cloth ; boil them until the bones will come easily out of the head, take off the skin as whole as possible, place a bowl in hot water and put in the hfiad, cutting it into small pieces. In the bottom of a round tin, shaped like a small cheese, lay two strips of cloth across each other, they must' be long enough to fold over the top when the shape is full, place the skin round the tin, and nearly half fill it with the meat, which has been high- ly seasoned with black pepper, cayenne, and salt; put in145 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. some tongue cut into slices, then the rest of the meat and the remainder of the tongue, draw the cloth tightly across the top ; put on it a board or a plate that will fit into the shape, and place on it a heavy weight, which must not be taken off till it be quite cold. It is eaten with vinegar and mustard, and served for luncheon or supper. To Stew a Ham. Soak the ham in lukewarm water for twelve hours, drain it, and scrape the rind ; put it into a stew-pan with some slices of fat bacon round the sides, four quarts of weak stock, a good deal of parsley, a bunch of sweet herbs, six large onions, four carrots, a little allspice and black pepper, a pint of Madeira, and one of port wine. Cover the ham with slices of fat bacon, and put over it a sheet of white paper ; stew it eight hours, or ten if it be a very large ham. Before serving, take off the rind, strain the sauce, skim it well, and boil it till reduced to a glaze, and pour it round the ham, or serve it with any other sauce that may be preferred. Bacon. For one side of a large pig allow one pound of coarse common salt, the same quantity of coarse brown sugar, two ounces of saltpetre, and two of rock salt finely pound- ed. Mix them well, and nib it on both sides of the pork, and when all is rubbed in, then lay it upon a wooden table placed slopingly, and put on it a board and weight. Place under it a vessel to catch the brine. Turn it once in two or three days, and baste it with the brine. Let it remain in this way for three weeks, and then hang it up to smoke for twenty-four hours, which will be a sufficient length of time, if the smoke is powerful. K.146 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. CHAPTER VIII. POULTRY. PREPARATORY REMARKS ON POULTRY- In choosing a turkey, the young cock bird is to be preferred ; the best have black legs, and if young, the toes and bill are pliable and feel soft. A hen turkey is chosen by the same rules. Fowls with black legs are the best; if fresh, the vent is close and dark ; if young, the combs are bright in the colour, and the legs smooth—the spurs of a young cock are short. A goose, if young and fine, is plump in the breast, the fat white and soft, the feet yellow, and but few hairs upon them. Ducks may be chosen by the same rules, and are hard and thick on the breast and belly. Pigeons should be quite fresh, the breast plump and fat, the feet elastic, and neither flabby nor discoloured at the vent. To prepare a turkey for dressing, every plug is care- fully picked out; and in drawing turkeys and fowls, care must be taken not to break the gall bag, nor the gut which joins the gizzard, as it is impossible to remove the bitterness of the one, or the grittiness of the other. The117 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. hair9 are singed off with white paper; the leg-bone is broken close to the foot, and the sinews drawn out—a cloth is then put over the breast, and the bone flattened with a rolling pin, the liver and gizzard, made delicately clean, are fastened into each pinion. A stuffing made with sausage meat, adding some grated bread, and mixing it with the beaten yolks of two eggs, or a stuffing as for a fillet of veal, is then put into the breast, and the turkey, well rubbed over with flour, is put down to roast. It is basted constantly with butter, and when the steam draws towards the fire, it i9 nearly done;—it is then dredged with flour, and basted with more butter, served with gravy in the dish, and garnished with sausages, or with forcemeat balls if veal stuffing is used, and bread sauce in a sauce tureen. To boil a turkey. After being nicely cleaned, it is trussed with the legs drawn in under the skin, stuffed with a forcemeat, as for veal, adding a few chopped oysters ; then boiled in a well-floured cloth, and served with oyster, white, or celery sauce, poured over it, and also some in a sauce tureen. Boiled ham, tongue, or pickled pork, is eaten with it. A large-sized turkey will require more than two hours to boil. Turkey, with ce- lery sauce, is stuffed and trussed neatly, laid all over with slices of bacon, tied in a cloth, and boiled in water, with a little salt, butter, and lemon juice added. It is served thickly covered with celery sauce. Turkey poults are stuffed and roasted in the same manner as a full-grown turkey. They will require rather more than an hour to roast. They are dressed with the heads twisted under the wing, as are also turkeys some- times, but it seems an injudicious custom, as the side on which the head is cannot be nicely browned, and in car-148 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. ving, the blood from the neck is apt to mingle with the gravy. To roast a fowl. It is picked, nicely cleaned, and singed ; the neck is cut off close by the back ; the fowl is then washed, and if a large one, 6tuffed with force- meat. It is trussed and dredged with flour; and when put down to roast, basted well with butter, and frothed up. When the steam is observed to draw towards the fire, it is sufficiently done; served with gravy in the dish, and bread sauce in a butter tureen. A good-sized fowl will require above an hour to roast. Chickens are roasted as the above, and served with gravy in the dish, which is garnished with fried eggs, and bread sauce in a sauce tureen ; they will require from half an hour to three quarters to roast. To boil a fowl. When nicely singed, washed, and trussed, it is well dredged with flour, and put on in boil- ing water, aird if a large one, boiled nearly an hour. It is served with parsley and butter, white, or liver sauce. Two boiled fowls, served with a tongue between them, make a handsome top dish. Boiled chickens are improved by being stuffed, and will require nearly half an hour to boil. To roast a goose. After being well cleaned, picked, and singed, it is washed, made perfectly dry, and stuffed with about four table-spoonfuls of grated bread, an onion finely minced, together with three sage leaves, seasoned with salt and pepper, and mixed with a well-beaten egg; or, the stuffing is made of boiled mashed potatoes, seasoned in the same way as the other, and mixed with a beaten egg. If roasted on a spit, each end is tied on tightly ; it is basted at first with a little bit of butter, after which the fat that drops from it is used. It is served with gravy149 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. in the dish, and apple sauce in a 6auce tureen. A large goose will require an hour and a half to roast. At table, an opening is cut in the apron, and a glass of port wine, with which is mixed a large tea-spoonful of made mus- tard, is poured into the body of the goose. This is also an improvement to ducks. A green goose, about two or three months old, is sea- soned with pepper and salt only, and requires to be basted with butter. It requires about an hour to roast. To roast ducks. They are nicely picked, cleaned, singed, and washed, seasoned with pepper and salt; or stuffed, and served with gravy, as directed in page 159. A duck may be boiled for nearly an hour, and served with onion sauce poured over it. Forced Goose, or Duck. Cut the goose open at the back, and carefully take out the bones, excepting those of the legs and wings. Take out all the meat from the body, leaving the skin perfectly whole. With the meat pound three quarters of a pound of lean and tender beef, add three handfuls of grated bread, four well-beaten eggs, and half a pint of rich sweet cream; season with black and Jamaica pep- per, mace, and salt; mix it all well together ; let it stand for half an hour, and then put it into the goose, which sew up, and make it of as natural a form as possible; but take care that it be not too much stuffed. Boil it for half an hour in some good stock, and then put it into a flat tin baking-pan, with some fresh butter over and under it. Bake it in an oven another half hour, and serve it with the following sauce : Brown a table-spoonful of but- ter with flour, add about a pint of the stock in which the goose has been boiled, three grated onions, two table-150 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. spoonfuls of capers cut fine, a little lemon pickle, and a few small pickled onions; boil it about a quarter of an hour, and just before pouring it over the goose, stir in gradually half a pint of rich cream. When this dish is to be served cold, the fat being care- fully removed from the goose, it may be ornamented or covered with cold jelly made as follows:—Boil for five hours in four quarts of water the bones of the goose, with three nicely cleaned calf’s-feet, strain it, and when cold take off all the fat, and boil the jelly with some whole black and Jamaica pepper, ginger, and salt; add two ounces of dissolved isinglass, the juice of two lemons, and the beaten whites of three or four eggs; stir it while it is upon the fire, and allow it to boil about ten minutes; then run it through a jelly-bag, and repeat this till it be- comes quite clear. To Roast Pigeons. Pick, clean, singe, and wash them well; truss them with the feet on, and put into them some pepper and salt. While roasting, baste them with butter. A little before serving, dust them with flour, and froth them with butter. Roast them for half an hour. Serve them with parsley and butter in the dish, or make a gravy of the giblets, some minced parsley, seasoned with pepper and salt. Thicken with a little flour and butter; pour it with the giblets into the dish, and then put in the pi- geons. Pigeons with Rice and Parmesan Cheese, i Pick and wash clean half a dozen nice pigeons, cut them into quarters ; brown some butter with flour, add to it a pint of good stock, with three grated onions, some pepper and salt, stew the pigeons in this till tender, take them out and mix in the juice of one lemon, boil and strain the sauce over the pigeons. Boil about three quar- ters of a pound of whole rice in a pint and a half of stock, with half a pound of fresh butter, some grated nutmeg and salt; when it is tender, add two handfuls of151 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. grated Parmesan cheese. Put more than half of the rice equally round the dish in which the pigeons are placed, and cover them with what remains, brush it over with a well-beaten egg, and then strew it thickly with more Par- mesan ; cover a flat baking-tin with salt, place the dish upon this, and bake it for nearly three quarters of an hour in a slow oven; it should be of a fine gold colour. To Broil Pigeons. Clean them and split the backs, season them with pepper and salt; broil, and serve them with parsley and butter poured round them. To Broil Pigeons Whole. Clean them well, cut off the wings and neck, leaving skin enough at the neck to tie; make a forcemeat with bread crumbs, three or four of the livers, one anchovy, some parsley minced, and a quarter of a pound of but- ter ; season with salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg, bind it with the yolk of an egg beaten up, and put into each pigeon a piece the size of a large walnut; tie the neck and rump, rub them with butter, and dust them with pepper, salt, and nutmeg mixed; broil them over a slow fire; to baste them, put them upon a plate, and with a feather brush them over with butter; broil them of a nice brown colour; serve them with melted butter and parsley, or a thickened brown gravy. To Stew Pigeons. Truss six pigeons neatly, and season them within with pepper, nutmeg, and cloves; fry them in butter, then put them into a stew-pan with a quart of good gravy and a little cider; stew them till tender; a little before serving, add a glass of white wine, and thicken the gravy witli butter rolled in flour. Another way to Stew Pigeons. Clean them nicely, truss them as for boiling, put into their inside some pepper and salt; brown ina sauce-THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 152 pan three ounces of butter with a table-spoonful of flour, add as much gravy or water as will nearly cover the pigeons, put them in with the livers, gizzards, and pi- nions, salt, and some minced parsley, spinach may also be added; let them stew for three quarters of an hour, add, a few minutes before serving, the yolks of four or six hard-boiled eggs. Another way to Stew Pigeons. Wash and clean six pigeons, cut them into quarters, and put all their giblets with them into a stew-pan, a piece of butter, a little water, a bit of lemon peel, two blades of mace, some chopped parsley, salt, and pepper; rover the pan closely, and stew them till they be tender; thicken the sauce with the yolk of an egg beaten up with three table-spoonfuls of cream and a bit of butter dusted with flour; let them stew ten minutes longer be- fore serving. Fowl a la Condd. Draw the sinews of the legs of two fine white fowls, and take out the breast bones, truss them, and put into each a little lemon juice, and salt, mixed with a piece of butter, place them in a stew-pan, and cover them with thin slices of fat bacon, pour over them the following sauce: Cut into dice a pound of veal, the same quantity of fat bacon, and a little fat of ham, fry all this white in half a pound of butter, adding a bunch of parsley, a little thyme, half a bay leaf, a clove, some salt and pepper, and some boiling water; when sufficiently stewed, strain it over the fowls, and let them stew for three quarters of an hour upon a slow fire, but have a pretty brisk one upon the cover of the stew pan; drain and serve them with a rich brown sauce, and a scarlet tongue placed be- tween them in the dish. To Stew a Fowl with Onions. Wash it clean, dry and truss it as for boiling, put a little pepper and salt into it, rub it with a bit of butter,THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 153 ae also the sauce-pan ; put in with the fowl a pint of veal stock or water, a little pepper and salt, turn it now" and then, and when it becomes quite tender, add twelve or sixteen small onions, and let them stew for half an hour; a young fowl will take one hour, and an old one three hours to stew. Hashed Fowl. Cut a cold roasted fowl into pieces as for a fricassee, put the trimmings into a sauce-pan with two or three shalots, a little lemon peel, a blade of mace, a quarter of a pound of lean ham, and a pint of stock; simmer it for half an hour, strain it, put a bit of butter into a sauce- pan, and when melted, dredge in as much flour as will dry it up, stirring it all the time ; then add the gravy, let it boil a minute, and put in the fowl, also a little pepper, salt, and a dust of sugar. Before serving, squeeze in a little lemon juice. To Pull a Chicken. Half roast a chicken or fowl, skin and pull off in small flakes all the white meat and the meat of the legs, break the bones, and boil them in a little water till the strength be drawn out, strain it, and when it be- comes cold skim and put it into a sauce-pan with a little mace, white pepper, and salt; add a bit of butter mixed with flour, and rather more than a quarter of a pint of cream, then put in the meat, and a little mushroom powder; before serving, add the squeeze of a lemon. Another way to Pull a Chicken. Pick all the white meat from the bones of a cold roasted fowl, cut off the legs, and keep the back and sidesmen in one. Score, and season the legs and back with pepper and salt, and broil them ; warm up the white meat in some sauce made of the bones boiled in a little water, and which has been strained and thickened with a piece of butter, mixed with flour, a little milk, and the yolk of an egg beaten up and seasoned with whiteTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 154 pepper and salt; serve the broiled back upon the mince, and the legs at each end. To Souse a Fowl. Cut into joints a hot roasted fowl, sprinkle over it of pepper and salt a dessert spoonful each, and two or three onions cut small, pour on it nearly a pint of boiling water, cover it with another dish, and let it stand till cold; a cold fowl may be prepared in the same way, and put into a sauce-pan for a few minutes to heat. Poulet a la Frarujaise. Cut a chicken up the back, fill it with thick slices of fat bacon, and put a slice of bread over the bacon, sew it up, and tie it round with a bit of pack thread, and then roast it. Chicken k la Creme. Half roast a chicken; while it is hot take out the entire breast, leaving perfectly wrhole the pinions, legs, and skin ; boil in milk two ounces of bread crumbs and an ounce of bacon very finely chopped, and some chopped parsley j season the meat of the breast of the chicken with pepper, salt, nutmeg, and a little grated lemon peel; pound it with the boiled bread crumbs, and add an egg beaten up; stuff it so as to represent a whole chicken, „ sift over it grated bread, and heat it thoroughly in the following sauce : a pint of new milk, one ounce of butter, kneaded in flour, a slice of bacon not very fat, two sha- lots, a little salt and white pepper; put the chicken into a dish, brown it with a salamander, and strain the sauce over it. Capons a la Turque. Pick, and clean very nicely, two fine capons; wash the inside perfectly clean with warm water, and let them soak in warm water for a quarter of an hour; dry them well, and put into them some rice which has been boiled till soft in some rich well-seasoned stock, truss155 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. anil cover them with layers of bacon, wrap them in paper, and roast them for an hour by a hanging-jack ; serve them, putting all round the dish a part of the rice which was prepared for the stuffing, and pour over the fowls a veloute sauce. One fine large fowl may be dressed in this manner. A Fowl a la Holandaise. Make a forcemeat of grated bread, half its quantity of minced suet, an onion, or a few oysters, and some boiled parsley, season with pepper, salt, and grated lemon peel, and an egg beaten up to bind it. Bone the breast of a good-sized young fowl, put in the forcemeat, cover the fowl with a piece of white paper buttered, and roast it rather more than half an hour; have ready a thick batter made of flour, milk, and eggs, take off the paper, and pour some of the batter over the fowl; as soon as it becomes dry add more, and do this till it is all crusted over, and of a nice brown colour; serve it with melted butter and lemon pickle, or a thickened brown gravy. Cold Chicken Fried. Cut the chicken in quarters, and take off the skin, rub it with an egg beaten up, and cover it with grated bread seasoned with pepper, salt, grated lemon peel, and chopped parsley, fry it in butter, thicken a little brown gravy with flour and butter, add a little cayenne, lemon pickle, and mushroom catsup. To make a Pillau. Wash very clean two pounds of rice, stew it till perfectly tender with a little water, half a pound of but- ter, some salt, whole white pepper, cloves and mace, and keep the stew-pan closely covered; boil two fowls and one pound and a half of bacon, put the bacon in the middle, and the fowls on each side, cover them all over with the rice, and garnish with hard-boiled eggs and fried whole onions.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 156 Chicken Baked in Rice. Cut a chicken into joints as for a fricassee, season it well with pepper and salt, lay it into a pudding dish lined with slices of ham or bacon, add a pint of veal gravy, and an onion finely minced; fill up the dish wfith boiled rice well pressed and piled as high as the dish will hold, cover it with a paste of flour and water; hake it one hour, and before serving take off the paste. To Fricassee a Chicken with White Sauce. Cut the chicken into joints, parboil it with the liver and gizzard, and take off the skin ; thicken a little of the liquor with a bit of butter mixed with flour, heat it, and put in the chicken with a little white pepper, grated lemon peel and nutmeg, a blade of mace, and some salt; boil it for about twenty minutes, take it off the fire, pick out the lemon peel and mace, and stir in gradually half a pint of cream with the yolk of two eggs well beaten, make it hot, but after adding the cream do not let it boil; the liver and gizzard may be dressed with it, or scored, seasoned with pepper, cayenne, and salt, broiled and served with the fricassee. A cold chicken or fowl may be dressed in this way, with a little white stock for sauce ; or they may be dress- ed with a little brown sauce, browning some butter and flour, adding with the liquor a minced onion, a little cat- sup, black pepper, nutmeg, salt, and a bit of lemon peel, which last take out before serving. To Fricassee Chickens. When well washed, cut the chickens into joints, scald, and take off the skin ; put them into a stew-pan, with an onion cut small, a bunch of parsley, a little thyme, lemon peel, and grated nutmeg, a slice of ham, and a bit of but- ter the size of a walnut; let them stew a quarter of an hour, add some white stock thickened with flour aid but- ter. Take out the parsley, ham, thyme, and lemon peel;THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 157 and a little before serving, beat up the yolks of three eggs in half a pint of cream, and stir it in gradually. Another way to Fricassee Chickens. Put into a stew-pan half a pint of water, three ounces of butter, a table-spoonful of flour, some salt, and white pepper; stir all together till it is hot, and add a chicken cutinto joints and skinned, with oneor two onions minced, and a blade of mace. Stew it for an hour; and a little before serving, add the yolks of two eggs beaten up with two table-spoonfuls of cream ; stir it in gradually, taking care it does not boil. Broiled or Grilled Chickens. Pick and singe them nicely, wash them clean, and dry them in a cloth ; cut them down the back, truss the legs and wings, as for boiling; flatten them, and put them upon a cold gridiron; when they become a little dry, put them upon a plate, baste them with butter, and strew a little salt and pepper over the inside, which part is laid first upon the gridiron ; baste them frequently, and let them broil slowly for about half an hour. Serve them very hot, with melted butter poured over them, or plenty of stewed mushrooms. The livers and gizzards may be broiled with them, fastened into the wings, or well seasoned, broiled, and served with the chickens. Boudin a la Riclilieu. Put the crumb of a good-sized stale roll into a basin, and cover it with milk, about as warm as when it comes from the cow; let it stand half an hour, then with a spoon take off ali the milk, and put the bread into a sauce-pan, with a good bit of butter, one onion chopped very finely, a little parsley and herbs. Keep stirring it on the fire till it become quite stiff, then take it off, and add the yolk of an egg, which must be well beaten into it; let it then cool before adding the meat, which nlay be of chicken, veal, or lamb, that has been already dressed. Half a pound of any of these meats, pounded or grated very fine, is the158 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. quantity required. Beat two eggs, whisking up well both yolks and whites ; add them to the meat and bread, and beat them all together for some time; the more they are beaten, the lighter the boudin will be. Butter a shape, and fill it; tie the shape in a cloth, and put it on to boil for three hours. A rich sauce, thickened and seasoned, is to be poured over the boudin when it is dished. Burdwan Stew. Cut into joints a cold fowl or duck, put it into a stew- pan, with half a pint of gravy, a large wine-glass of ale, half a one of white wine, the juice of half a lemon, a tea- spoonful of soy and cayenne; of mushroom catsup, le- mon pickle, cucumber vinegar, corack escavecke, a des- sert-spoonful each. Heat all thoroughly before serving. To Pot Chicken with Ham. Pound, in a marble mortar, the white meat of a cold fowl; season it with mace, white pepper, and a little salt; pound a piece of ham fat and lean, red beef or tongue; season it with pepper; put a layer alternately of each kind of meat into ajar, and press it closely; cover it with cla- rified butter. Cold turkey, veal, venison, or hare, may be done in this manner. To Boil a Duck. Make a paste, allowing half a pound of butter to a pound of flour. Truss a duck as for boiling; put into the inside a little pepper and salt, one or two sage leaves, and a little onion finely minced ; enclose the duck in the paste, with a little jellied gravy. Boil it in a cloth, and serve it with brown gravy poured round it. To Stew Duck. Cut one or two ducks into quarters ; fry them a light brown in butter; put them into a sauce-pan, with a pint of gravy, a tea-cupful of port wine, four onions whole, black pepper, and some salt, a bunch of parsley, two sage leaves, a sprig of winter savory, and sweet-marjoram. Cover159 THE PRACTICE OE COOKERY. the pan closely, and stew them till tender; take out the herbs and pepper ; skim it; if the sauce be not sufficient- ly thick, mix with two table-spoonfuls of it a little flour, and stir it into the sauce-pan ; boil it up, and garnish the dish with the four onions. Another way to Stew Duck. Put into a duck some pepper, salt, a minced onion, and one leaf of sage also minced; half roast it; brown with two ounces of butter, a table-spoonful of flour; add as much weak stock or water as will half cover the duck, and some pepper and salt; put in the duck, and a quart of green peas ; let it stew for half an hour, stirring it now and then. For a variety, a dozen of middling-sized onions may be substituted for the peas, and stewed the same length of time. Cold roasted duck may be dressed exactly in the same manner; and to hash it, cut it into joints, and heat it tho- roughly in gravy, adding a little soy, and a glass of port wine. To Stew Goose Giblets. Clean the giblets nicely, parboil them. Cut the necks into three, the gizzards into four, the livers, pinions, and heads into two ; take the outer skin off the feet, stew them in one quart of good stock, with a bunch of sweet herbs, a few peppercorns, two cloves, one anchovy, two large onions, and a table-spoonful of catsup. When the giblets are tender, take them out, and strain the sauce; thicken it with flour and butter, and a table-spoonful of white wine or cream. Add the giblets, and serve them quite hot; put sippets of thin toasted bread round the dish. Ox tails may be dressed in the same way as the above. Another way to Stew Goose Giblets. Prepare the giblets as before directed, parboil them ; thicken a pint of gravy soup, or the liquor they have been parboiled in, with flour and butter, boil and skim it; add the giblets, with an onion cut small, some pepper160 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. and salt; let them stew till they become very tender. Be- fore serving, add a tea-spoonful of vinegar* and a table- spoonful of white wine. To make a giblet pie, prepare them in the same man- ner, and add with the gravy a glass of port or white wine. Sandwiches. Cut some bread into thin slices, pare off the crust, and spread a little butter on them ; cut them nicely into oblong pieces, put between each some bits of fowl, and then thin bits of ham, both nicely trimmed; add a little mustard and salt. Any cold roasted or potted meat may be used. Serve them for luncheon, gar nished with curled parsley. Devil. Score the leg of a roasted turkey, goose, or fowl; pepper and salt it well, broil it, and pour over it the follow- ing sauce made quite hot: three table-spoonfuls of gravy, one of melted butter, and one of lemon juice, a large wine-glass of port wine, of mustard, Chili vinegar, Harvey sauce, and mushroom catsup, a tea-spoonful each; a lit- tle cayenne and black pepper. The devil may be served without a sauce, and be more highly seasoned. Eggs a la Tripe. Cut into thick round slices a dozen of hard-boiled eggs, and put them into the following sauce: cut three large white onions into dice, fry them white in butter, and when nearly done, dust them with flour, and moisten them with some milk and a few spoonfuls of cream ; keep stirring with a wooden spoon, to prevent their burning. When the sauce is done, grate in a little nutmeg, season with a little salt and pepper, and put in the eggs. Glass Eggs. Butter a dish, and break into it a piece of butter nearly as largo as an egg; add a tea-cupful of cream, and 4THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 1(51 drop in four or five eggs; put upon each a little pepper and salt, set the dish upon a stove, and serve it when the eggs are firm, which may be in ten or fifteen minutes. Poached E^s. OO Fill a frying-pan with boiling water, break some eggs one by one into a tea-cup, and slip them one by one into the water. When the white part is sufficiently done, take them out with an egg slice, and lay them upon toasted bread cut into square bits, or upon spinach. To poach eggs nicely, they must be quite fresh. Buttered Eggs. Beat and strain ten or twelve eggs; put a piece of butter into a sauce-pan, and keep turning it one way till melted ; put in the beaten eggs, and stir them round with a silver spoon till they become quite thick. Serve them in a dish upon buttered toast. They may be eaten with fish, fowl, or sausages. Fried Eggs. Eggs boiled hard, cut into slices, and fried, may be served as a second course dish, to cat with roasted chickens. To Preserve Eggs. Pour a gallon of water over a pound of unslaked lime, stir it well; the following day, pour off the clear water into ajar, and put in the eggs as they are laid. In this manner they will continue perfectly good for six months or more. LTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY 162 CHAPTER IX. CURRIES. Currie. Cut a fowl into small pieces, skin it, and let it blanch in cold water for two hours ; mince an onion very small, and put it into a sauce-pan, with two ounces of butter, and a large table-spoonful of flour of rice stirred in by degrees; brown it well, and when just boiling, add a quart of cold water, with the pieces of fowl and a large table-spoonful of currie powder mixed in it. Let it boil till the fowl be quite tender, and just before serving, squeeze the juice of half a lemon over the blade of a knife into it. Vinegar will answer instead of the juice; and if it be required very fine, in place of rice, thicken it with an ounce of sweet almonds blanched and pound- ed. Currie of Veal. Cut part of a neck of veal into cutlets, and make a gravy of the trimmings ; season it with pepper, salt, and an onion ; strain and thicken it with flour and butter, and add two spoonfuls of currie powder. Fry the cutlets with an onion minced very small, in butter, of a light brown colour, and then stew them in the prepared gravy- till they become quite tender. Before serving, add the juice of half a lemon, and a little Chili pepper.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 163 A Dry Currie. Skin ami cut a fowl into joints, or take off small cut- lets from the best end of a neck of veal; fry in butter three or four minced onions, and drain them; then fry the fowl or veal, and dust it with three tea-spoonfuls of currie powder, and a quarter of a tea-spoonful of cayenne. Put the fried meat and onions into a stew-pan, with a little salt, half a pint of milk, and the same quantity of water; keep the pan closely covered, and let it stew till perfectly tender, and ten minutes before serving, add two tea-spoonfuls of lemon juice. Currie Pimento. Having skinned and cut a fowl into joints, and rub- bed it well with currie powder, and a little cayenne, stew it gently, and till very tender, in some well-seasoned veal or mutton broth, to which some whole rice is added with the fowl; and before serving, mix in a little lemon juice and salt. Kebobbed Currie. Cut into small bits, veal, or the meat of fowl, and pick- led pork, and, with slices of onion, fasten them alternately upon small skewers, three or four inches long. Pound in a mortar a couple of onions, a small apple, a head of garlic, and a large table-spoonful of currie powder, with some gravy; press it through a sieve. Fry in butter a finely-minced onion ; dust the meat with turmeric, fry it, and add the strained liquor, with two bay leaves, « little salt and pepper. Let it stew till the liquor be near- ly wasted, anti the flavour be very rich. Before serving, squeeze in the juice of half a lemon, and take out tho bay leaves. Couclion, a China Dish, Is dressed much in the same manner, without porkj and not put upon skewers, but cut into very small pieces.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 164- A Fish Currie. After a cod-fish, haddock, or mackerel has lain some hours in salt, cut it into pieces, and stew it in water suffi- cient to cover it, into which a large table-spoonful of cur- rie powder has been mixed. Fry in a quarter of a pound of butter, a shalot and two or three onions minced, a lit- tle pepper and salt. When well browned, add it to the fish, and stew all together till it be quite tender. Sprats make a good currie, but should be stewed in less water. Cold Fish Currie. Cut into round thick slices cold boiled salmon, soles, cod, or haddocks; fry them in butter. In as much vine- gar as will cover the fish, boil a little salt, two or three cloves of garlic, a good deal of turmeric finely pounded, three cloves, a little nutmeg, ginger, and black pepper pounded, as much as will season it highly, and pour it hot over the fish. Cover it closely, and when it has stood twenty-four hours, it will be fit for use, and should be eaten cold with boiled rice. Indian Currie. Stew in two ounces of butter, for ten minutes, a tea- spoonful of cayenne, and one of Jamaica pepper, a des- sert-spoonful of pounded coriander seed, six small onions, and two heads of garlic minced. Cut the fowl or rabbit into small pieces, and cover it over with the curd of sweet milk. Put the whole into a stew-pan, with as much boil- ing water as may be desired for sauce, and let it simmer till very tender. Currie of Veal, Rabbit, or Fowl. Fry sliced veal, rabbit, fowl, or sweetbreads, in a good deal of butter, dusting it with flour. Dust one side with currie powder ; then turn and dust the other, strew- ing over it finely-minced onions, taking care not to burn them. When the meat is of a light brown, add some white 6tock, with a little salt; stew it till tender. Be-TIIE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 165 fore serving, skim off the fat, anil add a tea-spoonful of lemon juice or vinegar. Rabbit, fowl, and sweetbreads should be parboiled. To Boil Rice. Wash the rice perfectly clean, and put on one pound in two quarts of cold water; let it boil twenty minutes, strain it through a sieve, and put it before the fire; shake it up with a fork every now and then, to separate the grains, and make it quite dry. Serve it hot. Currie Powder. Pound extremely fine, in a mortar, six ounces of co- riander seed, three ounces of black pepper, one ounce and a half of fennigreck seed, one ounce of cummin seed, three ounces of turmeric, and three quarters of an ounce of cayenne; sift it through muslin, and put it before the fire for four or five hours, stirring it every now and then. Keep it in a bottle with a glass stopper. Another way to make Currie Powder. One pound of rice picked clean, eight ounces of co- riander seed, four ounces of cummin seed, and four oun- ces of yellow mustard seed. Put all these into a frying- pan, stir it constantly until it becomes quite hot, taking care it does not brown ; then grind it in a pepper-mill, with six ounces of cayenne, and two ounces of turmeric. Sift it through muslin, and grind the coarser part, repeating this till it is all sufficiently fine, and keep it in bottles with glass stoppers. Another way to make Currie Powder. Dry and finely pound the following ingredients: half a pound of turmeric, two ounces of ginger, the same of black pepper; of cummin seed, fennigreck seed, and cay- enne, half an ounce each. Mix them thoroughly, and dry it before the fire for some hours. Keep it in a well- corked bottle.106 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. CHAPTER X. GAME. PREPARATORY REMARKS ON GAME. In choosing venison, the fat of that which is good is thick, clear, and bright; the clift part smooth and close. When the venison is perfectly fresh, it is hung in a cool place, and carefully wiped dry every day. When ex- treme tenderness is required from long keeping, but without its having a high flavour, it is well rubbed over with powdered charcoal. The haunch is the prime joint, and when it is required to be roasted, it is first well washed in lukewarm milk-and- water, and then made quite dry before it is spitted. It is then covered with a sheet of well-buttered white paper, over which is laid a coarse paste of flour-and-water, about a quarter of an inch thick; this is again covered with but- tered white paper, and tied on with packthread. A sub- stantial fire being made, the haunch is put down, and constantly basted with fresh beef dripping, till nearly done, when the paste is taken off, the meal well basted with butter, and lightly dredged with flour, till it froths and becomes of a fine light brown colour. It is served167 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. with its own gravy in the dish, if there be enough of it; also a sauce tureen of good brown gravy, and one of cur- rant jelly sauce beat up, and melted with a little port wine and sugar. A large haunch takes about four hours to roast. A neck and shoulder, when roasted, is managed in the same way as the haunch, omitting the paste ; but it is more frequently used for soups, pasties, and collops. Hare. When fresh, the body is stiff; and if young, the claws are smooth and sharp, the ears tender and ea- sily torn. Hares are kept from a week to a fortnight for roasting; but for soup, they cannot have been too recent- ly killed. Rabbits are chosen by the same rules as hares. Wild fowl, in general, is chosen by the same rules as tame poultry. The birds should be plump and fat, and ard in the vent. If the skin comes off when rubbed hard with the finger, they are stale. Old birds improve by keeping for some time ; young birds are best if dress- ed soon; and small birds, of all descriptions, should be immediately dressed. In warm weather, a stopper of charcoal should be put into the vent of all game, and a string tied tight y round the neck. To roast pheasants and partridges, they are picked, cleaned, and nicely singed; a slit is made in the back part of the neck, and the craw taken out, leaving on the head, the feet twisted closely to the body, the claws cut off, and the head turned under the wing. Both sorts are roasted by the directions for roasting a turkey or a fowl. A pheasant is served with gravy in the dish; partridges with a gravy, or laid upon buttered toast, and melted butter poured round them. Bread sauce is served with both. A pheasant will require nearly an hour to roast;THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. ]G8 partridges half an hour. Guinea and pea-fowl are roast- ed in the same way as pheasants. To roast black-cock, follow the directions for roasting pheasants and partridges; it will require an hour, and is served with gravy in the dish, and bread sauce in a sauce tureen. Moorfowl are roasted in the same manner, and require three quarters of an hour. They may be served upon buttered toast, or with gravy in the dish, and bread sauce in a sauce tureen. To restore tainted game or poultry, pick it carefully, clean, and wash it, then put into each bird a little newly- made pounded charcoal, tied in a bit of muslin. Before serving, take out the bag, which will have a most offen- sive smell, while the bird will be left perfectly sweet. To roast wild duck. It should be roasted by a quick fire, well basted with butter, and browned. It will require nearly three quarters of an hour, and when to be served, some beef gravy is poured through the duck into the dish, and in a sauce tureen some hot port wine is served. The carver makes four cuts along the breast, it is then sprinkled with salt and a little cayenne, the juice of half a lemon is squeezed over it, and the port wine is then poured all over. To roast a wild goose, the same directions are follow- ed as for wild duck, allowing more time to roast it, ac- cording to the size of the bird. Widgeons and teal are dressed in the same manner as the wild duck, and are roasted in ten minutes, and may be served upon fried bread crumbs. Woodcocks and snipes are roasted without being drawn; a piece of toasted bread buttered is put under each bird, to catch the trail; they are well basted with butter, andTIIE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 1G9 served upon the hot toast over which they were roast- ed ; a rich brown gravy, or melted butter, is poured round them. Woodcocks will require half an hour, snipes and quails fifteen or twenty minutes to roast. Ortolans and green plovers are not drawn, and are roasted and served in the same manner as woodcocks. To roast larks, wheatears, and other small birds, they are nicely picked, gutted, cleaned, and trussed; brushed over with melted butter, and rolled in grated bread, then spitted on a bird spit, which is fastened upon a larger one. They are basted with butter, and sprinkled with some bread crumbs. They will require nearly fifteen minutes to roast, and are served upon fried bread crumbs, and brown gravy in a sauce tureen. Wild pigeons may be roasted, or made into a pie. Plovers’ eggs are boiled hard, and served in a napkin, or with green moss put round each in the dish. To Stew Moorfowl. Truss them, keeping on their heads, but draw the legs within the body; mix well some salt and pepper with flour and a piece of butter, and put a small bit into each bird ; fry them all over of a nice brown in butter. Brown some butter and flour, and add to it some good gravy, seasoned with pepper, salt, mace, and two cloves pound- ed ; boil up the sauce, put in the moorfowl, and let them stew very slowly till tender. A little before taking them off the fire, add a table-spoonful of mushroom catsup. If the birds are old, stew them for two hours; if young ones, half that time. Cold roasted moorfowl are dressed exactly in the same way, only cut into joints, and stewed very gently nearly as170 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. long. Half an hour before serving, a small tea-cupful of port wine should be added. To Stew a Hare. Cut a hare into pieces, put it into a sauce-pan, with half a pint of port wine, the same of good gravy, and a pint of cider, two or three small onions, a quarter of a pound of butter, some salt and pepper. Let it all stew till the hare be quite tender, and the liquor a good deal re- duced. Another way to Stew a Hare. Bone a hare; make a sauce with the bones and a lit- tle beef stock, adding sweet herbs, spices, and some port wine; thicken it with browned butter and flour. Stuft the hare with forcemeat, or with equal quantities of min- ced mutton and suet, well seasoned ; put it into the boil- ing sauce, and let it stew two hours. Place the hare on a dish, and strain the sauce over it. Stuffing for a Hare. Parboil the liver, and mince it; add an equal quan- tity of grated bread, double the quantity of fat bacon chopped, a bit of butter the size of a walnut. Season with pepper, salt, nutmeg, chopped lemon thyme, and parsley; bind with an egg beaten. To Roast and Stuff a Hare. When the hare is skinned and cleaned, lay it into cold water for three or four hours, changing the water several times, then rub it well with a little salt, and wash it tho- roughly ; dry it well. Make a stuffing of the raw liver minced, by no means parboiled, grated bread crumbs, twice the quantity of chopped fat bacon, and a bit of but- ter; season with grated nutmeg, lemon thyme, lemon peel, pepper, and salt; an anchovy may be added; bind with an egg beaten, put it into the hare, sew it up, and truss it properly. Put into the dripping-pan warm salt- and-water, baste the hare well till all the blood be out ofTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 171 it, pour away the water, and put in a quart of milk, with which it must he constantly hasted till it be nearly done ; then baste and froth it with butter. Serve with gravy, and, in a butter tureen, currant jelly sauce. Hashed Hare. Cut it into small pieces, heat it thoroughly in highly seasoned gravy, adding, with the stuffing, a tea-spoonful of vinegar, and a glass of port wine. The legs may be scored, seasoned with pepper and salt, rubbed with cold butter, and broiled. They may be served with the hash, or on a separate dish. Stewed Hare. Cut off all the meat, in small pieces; make a strong gravy with the bones of the hare, a bunch of sweet herbs, and two onions; strain it, and put iu the hare, with two table-spoonfuls of port wine, two or three thin bits of ba- con, a little salt, mace, and a clove pounded. Cover it closely, and let it stew two hours, and if the gravy is much reduced, add a little more. Florendine Hare. After a hare has hung a week, prepare it as for roasting, and take out all the bones of the body, leaving the head whole ; make a stuffing as before directed, lay it over the inside of the hare, roll it up, sew it, and fas- ten it with packthread; roll it into a cloth, and boil it in two quarts of water an hour and a half. When the liquor is reduced to a quart, add a pint of port wine, and of lemon pickle and mushroom catsup, a table-spoonful each, also a tea-spoonful of browning; thicken it with flour and butter, and stir it till reduced a little. Serve with force- meat balls, morels, and mushrooms; make the ears lie back upon the roll, and garnish with barberries and curl- ed parsley. Hare and Venison Collops. These are dressed in the same manner as mince col-TIIE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 172 lops of beef, only that, in place of the seasoning of the collops of beef, they have a little Jamaica pepper, salt, and some port wine. To Hash Venison. For a gravy, boil a part of the bone and trimmings of the cold haunch in a little water; season with a few pep- percorns and some salt; strain and thicken it with a bit of butter rolled in flour, add a glass of port wine, and a ta- ble-spoonful of mushroom catsup, and one of currant jelly. When hot, add the venison cut into thin slices, heat it thoroughly, and serve with sippets of toasted bread. To Stew Partridges. Truss the partridges as fowls are done for boiling; pound the livers with double the quantity of fat bacon and bread crumbs boiled in milk; add some chopped parsley, thyme, shalots, and mushrooms; season with pepper, salt, grated lemon peel, and mace. Stuff the in- side of the birds, tie them at both ends, and put them in- to a stew-pan lined with slices of bacon; add a quart of good stock, half a pint of white wine, two onions, a bunch of sweet herbs, and a few blades of mace; let them stew gently till tender; take them out, strain and thicken the sauce with flour and butter, make it hot, and pour it over the partridges. To Stew Young Partridges. Truss them as for roasting, stuff the craws with force- meat ; lard down each side of the breast, roll a lump of butter in pepper, and salt, and beaten mace, put it into the inside of each bird, and sew it up ; dredge them with flour, and fry them of a light brown in butter ; put them into a stew-pan, with a quart of good gravy, half a tea-cupful of white wine or of table-beer, the same of mushroom catsup, a dessert-spoonful of lemon pickle, half a tea-spoonful of mushroom powder. Cover the pan closely, and let them stew half an hour; take them out, and thicken the gravy with a little flour mixed in water;TIIE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 173 boil it up, and pour it on the partridges. Garnish the dish with foicemeat balls and hard-boiled yolks of eggs. Perdrix aux Choux. Truss the birds as for roasting, rub them slightly with garlic, put over each breast a bit of bacon, and into the inside a bit of butter the size of a walnut, dusted with flour, and seasoned with pepper, salt, and thyme; half roast, and then stew them with some good gravy, a bit of lean ham or bacon, one spoonful of white wine, the same of mushroom catsup and of lemon pickle, a little cayenne, one anchovy, and one shalot. Have ready boil- ed the hearts of some cabbages, put them into the stew- pan, and stew them all together till the partridges be suf- ficiently tender. Before serving, take out the ham. To Roast Rabbits. Truss them for roasting, and stuff them with the li- ver minced raw, grated bread, and ham, butter or suet, and chopped parsley, seasoned with a little lemon thyme, .grated nutmeg, salt, and pepper, and bound with an egg beaten. Sew them up, and roast them before a quick fire, and baste them with butter. Serve them with gravy, or melted butter with lemon pickle in it. Two will take an hour to roast. They may also be fricasseed or fried, cut into joints, with plenty of fried parsley, and served with a sauce made of the liver and some parsley chopped, and mixed in melted butter, with a little pepper and salt, or made into a pie the same as chickens. Rabbits Stewed with a Brown Sauce, or with a White Sauce. Wash and clean the rabbits well, let them lie for two or three hours in cold water, cut them into joints, wash and dry them in a cloth, dust them with flour, and fry them of a light brown with butter, and stew them in the following: sauce : Brown three ounces of butter in a stew- pan, with a table-spoonful of flour, a minced onion, some174 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. popper and salt; add a pint of gravy and the rabbits, stew them till they are tender, and a little before serving, stir in a table-spoonful of catsup. When it is wished to dress with a white sauce, the rabbits are not fried, but stewed in white stock, which is seasoned with white pepper, and salt, and thickened with a piece of butter mixed with flour. A few minutes be- fore serving, a little cream is added, and a table-spoonful of lemon pickle. Rabbits Smothered in Onions. Prepare them as before directed, and truss them ; thicken a sufficient quantity of white stock, in which boil them with a piece of butter mixed with flour; sea- son it with salt and pepper, and when it boils, put in the rabbits, with plenty of onions cut in quarters. Let them stew till they are tender. Serve them with the onions put all over the rabbits. Ragout of Snipes. Pick sijc or eight snipes very nicely, but do not wash them ; take out the inside. Itoast the birds, and cut off all the meat from the breasts, in thin slices; pound the bones, legs, and backs, in a mortar, and put them into a stew-pan, with the juice of a lemon, a little flour, and some well-seasoned gravy; boil it till it be thick, and well flavoured with the game, then strain it. Cut half a pound of ham into thin long slices, and heat it in a little butter, with two minced shalots ; put it, with the breasts of the snipes, into the strained sauce, and let it boil. Pound the inside, or trail, with a little 6alt, spread it over thin bits of toasted bread, and hold over it a hot salaman- der. Put the ragout upon this, and place the ham round it.THE PRACTICE OT COOKERY. 175 CHAPTER Xf. GRAVIES, SAUCES, FORCEMEATS, AND OTHER THINGS. Browning for made dishes. Put into a sauce-pan one pound of good brown sugar, stir it constantly over a slow fire, boil it till it is as thick as treacle, and resem- bles it in colour; take the pan off the fire, stir it for a minute or two, and pour in very slowly a quart of boil- ing water, stirring constantly; put it again on the fire, and boil it for a little; pour it into a bowl, and when cold, bottle it. This browning will keep good for a year, and very little of it serves for colouring soups, gravies, or sauces. To clarify butter. Put the butter cut into slices into a nicely-cleaned brass pan, stir it gently till dissolved; when it boils, draw the pan to the side of the fire, skim it, and let it boil gently a second time, and if any scum again rises, take it off; let it settle for two or three mi- nutes, and strain it gently through a 6ieve which has a piece of muslin laid into it. Fresh beef suet, picked free from skin and sinews, is dissolved iu the same way; it is then strained through176 TIIE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. muslin into small jars, and when cold, covered with blad- der, or it may be strained into cold water; and the cake when cold, wiped dry, folded in white paper, and kept in a linen bag. Beef suet will keep fresh for some time if finely chop- ped and dredged well with flour, and kept in white paper bags in a cool place. Beef and mutton drippings are clarified exactly in the manner butter is done, and each kept in a separate jar. To melt hog’s-lard, put it into ajar placed in a pot of water or water bath, strain it into clean bladders or small jars, and cover them with paper. Thus prepared, it will keep good a length of time, and is the best thing for fry- ing fish in. To fry parsley, wash it, pick it clean, and put it into fresh cold water; take it out, and then throw it into boil- ing lard or dripping, when it will instantly become crisp ; it is then taken out with a slice. White Roux, or White Thickening for Sauces and Made Dishes. Meet gradually, over a slow fire, a good piece of but- ter, and dredge in a sufficiency of flour to make it like a thin paste; keep stirring it for a quarter of an hour, and then put it into a small jar to be kept for use. Brown Roux, or Thickening. Put into a nicely tinned sauce-pan about a pound of fresh butter, melt it slowly, and dredge in flour till itTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 177 becomes like ft paste, carefully stirring it all the time, put it for a few minutes upon a quick tire, and then return it to where there is less heat, and stir it till it assumes a light brown colour, when it may be put into a jar. These thickenings keep for some time. Gravy made from Bones. Break into small pieces a pound of beef, mutton, or veal bones, if mixed together so much the better; boil them in two quarts of water, and after it boils, let it simmer for nearly three hours; boil with it a couple of onions, a bunch of sweet herbs, some salt and pepper ; strain, and keep it for making gravy or sauces. The bones of broiled and roasted meat beiHg scraped, washed clean, and boiled in less water, answer equally well for this purpose. To make Gravy. Cut down into slices four pounds of lean beef, rub the bottom of the pot with butter, and put in the meat; turn it frequently till it be well browned, and do it slowly, then add four quarts of cold water; when it has boiled two hours, put in a dessert-spoonful of whole black pepper, and the same of Jamaica pepper, one carrot, and three onions ; let it stew gently for four hours longer, strain it, and when it is required for use, take off the fat. This gravy answers for all made dishes when brown gravy sauce is used. Another way to make Gravy. Dip a beef liver into water, wipe it, and rub over it some salt and coarse brown sugar; let it lie seven or eight days, turning it frequently; boil in as much water as will quite cover the liver, one ounce of saltpetre, and three of common salt; wipe the liver dry, and put it into the pickle ; let it lie for six weeks, then hang it to dry. Boil for an hour and a half, in a pint of water, a slice of this nearly the size of threo fingers, a carrot, an onion, and some pepper ; strain, and use it for gravy. M178 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 9 - To Clarify Gravy. Clarify gravy drawn from beef or veal, with the beat- en whites of eggs, allowing one white to a quart. Gra- vies and soups which are to be clarified should be made very strong, and be highly seasoned. To make Gravy without Meat. Slice three onions, and fry them brown in a little but- ter ; add them to half a pint of water, and the same of beer, put in some peppercorns, salt, a little lemon peel, three cloves, a little mace or Jamaica pepper, a spoonful of walnut pickle, and one of mushroom catsup, of soy and es- sence of anchovy a dessert-spoonful each, a small bunch of sweet herbs, and a quarter of a slice of bread toasted brown on both sides; simmer all together in a closely covered sauce-pan for twenty minutes, then strain it for use, and when cold take off the fat. It will taste exactly like a gravy made with meat. Another way to make Gravy without Meat. Knead a good deal of Hour into a piece of butter the size of an egg, fry it in a frying-pan over a clear fire, stir it constantly with a wooden spoon till it become a nice brown colour, taking particular care that it be made per- fectly smooth ; pour in some boiling water, add a little finely-minced onion, some whole black pepper and a lit- tle salt, put it into a small sauce-pan, cover it closely, and simmer it for a short time ; strain, and mix with it a little mushroom catsup, and port wine. To make Gravy for Roast Meat. When the spit is taken from the meat, a good deal of gravy will run into the dish ; pour in addition to this a little boiling water and salt over the under part of the bone of the beef, or over the shank-bone of a leg or shoulder of mutton, taking great care not to let it run over the meat.179 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Another way is: About a quarter of an hour before the meat is taken from the fire, put a common dish with a tea-spoonful of salt in it under the meat; pour over it a small tea-cupful of boiling water; when it has all run into the dish, remove it, baste and froth the meat, and pour the gravy into the dish on which the roast is to be served. To draw Gravy. Put a few pounds of gravy-beef sliced, and a little whole black pepper, into a jar with a cover to fit closely; set the jar into a pot of cold water, and when it boils, add as it wastes more hot water, and keep it boiling gently for six or seven hours, when the richest gravy imaginable will be obtained. It may be used in that state, or reduced with water. To make a Pint of Rich Gravy. Brown a quarter of a pound of butter, dredging in two table-spoonfuls of flour, and stirring it constantly; add a pound of gravy-beef cut into small bits, and two or three onions chopped. When it becomes brown, add some whole black pepper, one carrot, a bunch of sweet herbs, and three pints of water; let it boil gently till reduced to one, then strain it. This gravy may be served With roasted turkey or fowl. Essence of Ham for Gravies. Pick off all the bits of meat from a ham-bone, pound it, break the bone, and put both into a sauce-pan, toge- ther with nearly half a pint of water, and a bunch of sweet herbs; simmer gently for some time, stirring it occasionally; then add a pint of good beef gravy, and some black pepper, and continue to simmer it till it be well flavoured with the herbs ; strain, and keep it for im- proving rich gravies and sauces of all descriptions.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 180 Lobster Catsup. Choose a lobster that is full of spawn, and weighing as nearly as possible three pounds; pick out all the meat, and pound the red part or coral in a marble mortar ; when completely braised, add the meat, pound, and moisten it with a little sherry wine, mix with it a tea-spoonful of cayenne, add the rest of the bottle of sherry, and mix it thoroughly ; put it into two wide-mouthed bottles, and on the top put a small table-spoonful of whole black pepper, cork the bottles tightly, and tie them over with leather. It will keep good a twelvemonth, and exactly re- sembles fresh lobster sauce. Four table-spoonfuls heated in melted butter are sufficient for a large sauce-tureen. Oyster Sauce. Beard the oysters, and put them into a sauce-pan, with their liquor strained, a good bit of butter, a few black peppercorns, a little salt, cayenne, and a blade of mace. Simmer them gently for fifteen or twenty minutes, on no account allowing them to boil. Knead some flour into a bit of butter, and melt it, adding a little milk ; pick out the peppercorns and mace from the oysters, and pour upon them the melted butter. Another Oyster Sauce. Beard and scald the oysters, strain the liquor, and thicken it with a little flour and butter, squeeze in a lit- tle lemon juice, and add three table-spoonfuls of cream. Heat it well, but do not let it boil. Another Oyster Sauce, for Boiled Fowl, or Turkey. Put into a stew-pan, with their liquor, two dozen of oys- ters, and a little water; when it boils, take out the oys- ters with a silver spoon, and drain them upon a hair sieve; let the liquor settle, and pour it off- from the se- diment ; beard the oysters. Put into a stew-pan, with one or two spoonfuls of fine flour, two ounces of fresh181 THF, PRACTPCE OF COOKERY. butter,and stir it till the flour is a little fried; add the liquor of the oysters, and a pint of cream ; stir, and let this boil a quarter of an hour, then add two table-spoonfuls of bechamel, or a little highly-seasoned gravy, and the oys- ters, which must be made quite hot. Mock Oyster Sauce. Put into a sauce-pan two or three chopped anchovies, a quarter of a pint of water, a little mace, and one or two cloves; let them simmer till the anchovies be quite dis- solved. Strain it, and when cool, add a tea-cupful of cream ; thicken it with a piece of butter rolled in flour, and heat it up. It may be poured over boiled fowls or veal. Chestnut Sauce, for a Roast Turkey. Scald a pound of good chestnuts in hot water for five minutes, skin them, and stew them slowly for two hours in white stock, seasoned and thickened with butter and flour. Cut a pound of pork sausages into bits about an inch long, dust them with flour, and fry them a light brown ; lay them into the disli on which the turkey is to be served, and pour the chestnuts and sauce over them. Some people prefer the fried sausages stewed a little with the chestnuts ; but this method makes the sauce of a darker colour. White Sauce, for Fowls or Turkey. Put on, in a quart of water, the necks of fowls, a piece of the scrag-end of a neck of mutton, two blades of mace, twelve black peppercorns, one anchovy, a small head of celery, a slice from off" the end of a lemon, and a bunch of sweet herbs ; cover it closely, and let it boil till reduced to nearly half a pint; strain, and put to it a quar- ter of a pound of butter dredged with flour; let it boil for five minutes, and then add two spoonfuls of pickled mush- rooms. Mix with a tea-cupful of cream, the well-beaten yolks of two eggs, and some grated nutmeg; stir this inTHE PRACTICE OP COOKERY. 182 gradually, and shake the pan over the fire till it is ail quite hot, but do not allow it to boil. To make Bechamel, or White Sauce. Cut into small pieces half a pound of veal and a quar- ter of a pound of lean ham, put it into a sauce-pan, with eight white peppercorns, a shalot, two cloves, two blades of mace, a bay leaf, some parsley, and a quart of veal broth or water. Let it boil till it is 6trong and well fla- voured ; strain, and thicken it with a little flour rubbed smooth in cold water. Boil it up, and mix in very slow- ly a pint, or nearly so, of cream. Sauce for Roast Beef. Mix well together a large table-spoonful of finely grated horse-radish, a dessert-spoonful of made mustard, and half a one of brown sugar, then add vinegar till it be as thick as made mustard. Serve in a sauce-tureen. Another Sauce for Roast Beef. Put into a stone jar one gill of soy, two of vinegar, two of water, a good-sized stick of horse-radish, and two sliced onions. Cover the jar closely, and set it into a pan of cold water; when it boils, let it simmer for two or three hours. To make a Quart Bottle of Fish or Meat Sauce. To half a bottle of vinegar put one ounce of cayenne, two cloves of garlic, one table-spoonful of soy, two of walnut, and two of mushroom catsup. Let it stand six days, shaking it frequently, then add the remaining half of the bottle of vinegar; let it stand another week, strain, and put it into small bottles. Pink Sauce, for Fish. Put into a pan, or wide-mouthed jar, one quart of good vinegar, half a pint of port wine, half an ounce of cayenne, one large table-spoonful of walnut catsup, twoTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 183 ditto of anchovy liquor, a quarter of an ounce of cochi- neal, and six cloves of garlic. Let it remain forty hours, stirring it two or three times a-day; run it through a flannel bag, and put it into half-pint bottles. Fisli Sauce. Mix well with two ounces of melted butter, of mush- room catsup, essence of anchovies, and lemon pickle, a table-spoonful each, a tea-spoonful of soy, and a little cayenne. Boil it before serving. Escaveke Sauce, for Cold Game, Fowl, or Meat. Beat, in a marble mortar, the following ingredients: five cloves of garlic, six cloves of shalot, as much pound- ed ginger as will lie upon a sixpence, and the same of cayenne, a table-spoonful of coriander seed, and a little salt. Pour upon them, boiling hot, a pint of the best white wine vinegar; add the peel of a lemon, cut very thin. When cold, put the whole into a bottle, cork it tightly, and shake it well before using. White Sauce. Thicken half a pint of cream with a little flour and butter, four shalots minced, a little mace and lemon peel; let it boil, and a little before serving, add a spoonful of white wine, the well-beaten yolk of an egg, the squeeze of a lemon, and a tea-spoonful of anchovy liquor. This sauce will answer for boiled fowls, or for a fricassee. Quin’s Sauce. Half a pint of mushroom pickle, the same of walnut pickle, three whole and three pounded cloves of garlic, six anchovies bruised, and a tea-spoonful of cayenne. Mix all together in a large bottle, shake it daily for three weeks, then strain, and hottle it for use. Another Quin’s Sauce. 0 One pint of port wine, one of mushroom catsup, one of184 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. walnut liquor, one of essence of anchovies, and a tea-spoon- ful of cayenne; mix all together, and boil it for a quar- ter of an hour. If essence of anchovies is not to be had, boil half a pound of anchovies in a quart of water till re- duced to a pint. Strain, and use it. Melted Butter. Dust a little Hour over a quarter of a pound of but- ter, put it into a sauce-pan, with abjut a wine-glass of water; stir it one way constantly till it be melted, and let it just boil: a round wooden stick, called in Scotland a thevil, is the best thing to stir butter with in melting. If the butter is to be melted with cream, use the same proportion as of water, but no flour; stir it constantly, and heat it thoroughly, but do not let it boil. To oil butter, cut about a quarter of a pound into slices, put it into a small jar, and place it in a pan of boiling water. When oiled, pour it off clear from the sediment. French Melted Butter. Mix, in a stew-pan, with a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, a table-spoonful of flour, a little salt, half a gill of water, half a spoonful of white vinegar, and a little grated nutmeg. Put it on the fire, stir it, and let it thicken, but do not allow it to boil, lest it should taste of the flour. Bread Sauce. Boil, in a pint of water, the crumb of a French roll or of a slice of bread, a minced onion, and some whole white pepper. When the onion is tender, drain off the water, pick out the peppercorns, and rub the bread through a sieve ; then put it into a sauce-pan, with a gill of cream, a bit of butter, and a little salt. Stir it till it boil, and serve it in a sauce-tureen. Another Bread Sauce. Mix, in rather more than half a pint of milk or water, a slice of grated bread, a dessert-spoonful of potatoe flour,185 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. a small onion pounded, a bit of butter the size of a wal- nut, a few whole peppercorns, a little mace, and salt.

Boil these together about fifteen or twenty minutes; when cold, strain and bottle it, waxing the corks. It will keep good a year. A table-spoonful improves oyster sauce, and that quantity is sufficient for a sauce-tureen of melted butter. Tomata Sauce. Bake six tomatas in an oven till quite soft; with a tea- spoon take out the pulp, add salt, cayenne, and vinegar, till of the consistence of thick cream. Dutch Sauce. Beat up the yolks of six eggs, mix in a little flour, cream, salt, and lemon vinegar. Strain it through a sieve, add a small piece of fresh butter, two blades of pound- ed mace, and a little wince pepper. Put it into a sauce- pan, and stir it till it is almost boiling.

Mix, with two ounces of fresh butter, one tea-spoonful of flour, two table-spoonfuls of cold water, the same quantity of vinegar, and one well-beaten egg; put it into a sauce-pan, and stir it over the fire till it be quite hot, but do not allow it to boil. Another Dutch Sauce. Put into a stew-pan a tea-spoonful of flour, four table-186 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. spoonfuls of elder vinegar, a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, the yolks of five eggs, and a little salt; keep stir- ring it over the fire, and work it well till thick. If it be not curdled, it will not require to be strained. Season with pepper. Poivrade Sauce for Cold Meat. Chop finely six shalots and a handful of picked and washed parsley; mix with it a little vinegar, mustard, cayenne, oil, cold gravy, and salt. Another Poivrade Sauce for Cold Meat. Bruise the yolk of a hard-boiled egg with a little salt; add mustard, oil, soy, chopped parsley, and chives, and pour it over slices of any cold meat. Sauce for Pike. Mix with a pint of cream a table-spoonful of anchovy sauce, the same of soy, and two of cat6up, a piece of but- ter rolled in flour; put it into a sauce-pan, and stir it one way till nearly boiling. White Sauce for Pike. Simmer, till half wasted, two table-spoonfuls of white wine, one of vinegar, half a small onion, and some grated nutmeg ; add a piece of butter rolled in flour, then a small tea-cupful of cream ; heat it thoroughly, stirring it all the time, and taking care that it do not boil. Fish Sauce. A quart of port wine, half a pint of best vinegar, one pound of bruised anchovies, one,ounce of mace and one of cloves, half an ounce of black pepper, one large onion, and the peel of one lemon ; boil all these ingredients toge- ther, over a slow fire, till a pint is wasted; then strain, and bottle it, and keep it closely stopped. Sauce for Boiled Beef.

Let it boil nearly ten minutes, and add a spoonful of cut capers, which must be thoroughly heated before the sauce is served. A Sauce for any sort of Meat. Boil and strain three table-spoonfuls of gravy, two of vinegar, a blade of mace, a little pepper, salt, and a largo sliced onion. Sauce Tournee. To a little white thickening add some stock drawn from the trimmings of veal, poultry, and ham; do not make it too thick. Boil it slowly with a few mushrooms, a bunch of parsley, and some green onions; strain and Bkim it well, and use it as required. German sauce is made as the sauce tournee, adding the beaten yolks of two or more eggs, and is used for ragouts, fricassees, and any made dish which may require a rich white sauce. Sauce d’Attelets. Take of finely-minced parsley, mushrooms, and sha- lots, a table-spoonful each ; fry them with a little butter, and then dredge in a little flour; moisten the mixture with some good stock, season it with pepper and salt, and boil it till it begins to thicken; then take it off the fire, and add the well-beaten yolks of two or three eggs. Stir it well all the time it is making. This sauce is generally used instead of butter, when crumbs of bread are to be put over any thing. A Sauce. Mix together a pint of vinegar, two shalots or heads of garlic, a tea-spoonful of cayenne, three large tabic- spoonfuls of Indian soy or mushroom catsup, and two of walnut pickle. Let it stand a week, shaking it daily; strain, and hot' i it for use.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 188 Lobster Sauce. Bruise the body, add it to some thick melted butter; pull the flesh into small bits, and mix all together with some rich beef gravy; boil it up, and before serving add a little salt, and squeeze in a little lemon juice. Another Lobster Sauce. Pound very finely the spawn of a lobster, rub it through a sieve, mix it with a quarter of a pound of melt- ed butter, then add the meat of the lobster cut into small bits. Make it quite hot, but do not allow it to boil. Sauce Robart, for Beef Steaks or Mutton Chops. Put into a sauce-pan a little gravy, two ounces of but- ter dredged with flour, a small slice of raw ham, and two or three minced onions; when the onions are browned, dust in a little more flour, and add nearly a pint of gra- vy, a little salt and pepper, a tea-spoonful of mustard, and a table-spoonful of vinegar. Boil it for some minutes, strain and serve it. A Sauce for Broiled Meat, Game, and Poultry. Bruise the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs with a little water and salt; bone one anchovy, and mince it, a small onion, two shalots, a little parsley and tarragon, and a few capers; mix them with the egg, add a table-spoonful of tine oil, a little mustard, two table-spoonfuls of lemon, and one of tarragon vinegar; mix all exceedingly well together, put it into a sauce-tureen, and serve it with the broil; or it may be served with cold veal. A Bunch of Sweet Herbs Is made up of parsley, sweet marjoram, winter savory, orange and lemon thyme ; the greatest proportion of pars- ley.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 189 To Prepare Onions for Seasoning. Peel and mince three or four onions, put them into a sauce-pan with a little cold water. Let them boil till quite tender, and then pulp them with the liquor through a hair sieve, when it may be mixed with any made dishes or sauces. Celery Sauce. Clean nicely, and cut into small pieces, the white part of two or three heads of celery; boil it in a little white stock, season with white pepper, salt, and a little nutmeg. When it is tender, add a piece of butter rolled in flour, and three table-spoonfuls of cream ; heat it, but do not let it boil. Pour it over boiled turkey or fowl. Sauce Piquant. Put a little chopped sbalot and a few spoonfuls of gravy into a sauce-pan ; let it boil till the gravy be nearly boiled away, but not burned to the bottom of the sauce- pan ; add as much braise as may be required for the sauce, season with pepper and salt, boil it a few minutes, then add a little lemon juice, sugar, and a tea-spoonful of garlic vinegar. N.B. Braise is an onion stuck with cloves, and boiled till tender in gravy and white wine. White Italian Sauce. Peel some mushrooms, and throw them into a little water and lemon juice, to keep them white. Put into a stew-pan two-thirds of sauce tournee, and one-third of good veal stock, two table-spoonfuls of finely-chopped mushrooms, and half a table-spoonful of washed and chop- ped shalots ; let it boil till well flavoured, and then serve it. The mushrooms should be as white as possible. White Sharp Sauce. Boil with a little tarragon, or tarragon vinegar, if the tarragon is not to be had, four table-spoonfuls of white190 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. wine vinegar, and about twenty peppercorns; reduce this to one-fourth, arid add it to six table-spoonfuls of sauce tournee, and two of good stock ; boil and strain it; put it again on the fire, and thicken it with the beaten yolks of two eggs, a small bit of butter, a little salt and cayenne. Just before serving, stir in a spoonful of cream. White Sauce for Fish. Four anchovies chopped, two glasses of white wine, a large one of vinegar, an onion stuck with three cloves, and cut into quarters ; let all these simmer till the ancho- vies dissolve; strain it, and add a quarter of a pound of butter kneaded in a table-spoonful of flour. When it has melted, stir in gradually, one way, half a pint of cream, taking care that it do not boil. When thoroughly heat- ed, serve in a sauce-tureen. Parsley and Butter. Pick and wash clean a large bunch of parsley, tie it . up, and boil it for a few minutes in water; drain and chop it very finely, add to it some melted butter, and make it quite hot. It is better to be made thick with parsley. Onion Sauce. Boil twelve or more onions in water; when it boils, pour it off, add more hot water, and when the onions are tender, strain and mash them in a bowl, add a piece of butter, a little salt, and one or two spoonfuls of cream.

Mushroom Sauce for Boiled Turkey or Fowl. Pick clean and wash a pint of small mushrooms, rub them with flannel, put them into a sauce-pan with a blade of mace, a little salt, grated nutmeg, a piece of butter rolled in flour, and a pint of cream, keep stirring them till they boil, then pour them round the turkey, fowl, or chicken. Poor Man’s Sauce. Chop a few shalots very fine, and mix with them a little pepper, salt, vinegar, and water, and serve in a sauce-tureen. This sauce is generally served with young roasted turkeys. White Sauce for Boiled Fowls. Melt in a tea-cupful of milk a large table-spoonful of butter kneaded in flour, beat up the yolk of an egg with a tea-spoonful of cream, stir it into the butter, and heat it over the fire, stirring it constantly; chopped parsley improves this sauce. It also may be made melting the butter with water, and mixing milk with the egg. La Sauce Robert.

Forcemeat Onions. Peel four or five large onions, scoop out the inside, fill them with forcemeat, and roast them in an oven. They may be served with roast turkey or fowl. Kitchen Spice for White Sauce. Pound two ounces of white pepper, a quarter of an ounce of mace, grate one nutmeg, and the peel of one lemon ; mix all together in a bottle. Another Kitchen Spice for general use. One ounce of black pepper, and of Jamaica pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger, half an ounce each, and eight cloves ; pound and mix all together in a bottle. A little of each kind of spice should be well dried, pounded, and kept separately in small bottles, which should be la- belled. Mushroom Powder. Pick, skin, and clean half a peck of mushrooms, throw them into cold water, drain, and put them into a sauce- pan with two spoonfuls of white pepper, a quarter of an ounce of mace and five cloves pounded, simmer and shake them till the liquor is wasted away, but be careful they do not burn ; lay them upon dishes, and put them into a cool oven to dry, then beat them to a powder; put it into wide-mouthed bottles, and tie leather over the corks; keep them in a dry place.

Fried Bread Crumbs. Put into a frying-pan or sauce-pan a piece of butter, oil, and skim it, pour it from the sediment, return it to the pan, throw in two or three spoonfuls of grated bread, keep stirring them constantly till of a beautiful yellow brown, and drain them before the fire. Glaze, Brown and 'White. A brown glaze is made of stock clear and pale in the colour; should it not be sufficiently clear, it must be made so with the white of eggs, and run through a jelly bag; a little white wine is added, and it is then boiled until it hang to the spoon, when it may be put into a glaze kettle; this kettle is made similar to a milk kettle, and of the best block tin; when the glaze is wanted for use, the kettle is put into a stew-pan of water by the side of a stove ; it should be of a beautiful clear yellow brown, and is put over ham tongue and many made dishes with a brush. A white glaze is made in the same manner as the brown, substituting white for brown stock. A rich Cullis, or Gravy. Cut into slices some lean beef, veal, and mutton, cover the bottom of the sauce-pan with the veal, then put in a few slices of fat bacon, next a layer of beef, add a few onions sliced, and the red part of one or two carrots, a little mace, two or three cloves, some whole black and Jamaica pepper, and two or three bay leaves, above that the mutton; cover the pan closely, set it on a slow fire, and when the meat is a fine brown, mix quite smooth a small quantity of flour in water, stir it in, and then add as much boiling water as will cover the meat well, and a lit- tle salt; cover the pan closely, and let it stew an hour and a half; strain, and keep it for use; it will continue good for eight or ten days.THE PRACTICE OP COOKERY. 199 To Pot Mushrooms. Put into salt and water a peek of clean picked button mushrooms, take them out immediately, and wipe them with a bit of flannel; dip them into the same water, and put them into a sauce-pan with a dessert-spoonful of salt, six blades of mace, and two cloves; let them stew till half the liquor is consumed, then add two pounds and a half of fresh butter, and stew them till no liquor is to be seen at the bottom of the pan ; put them into pots, and when cold, tie bladder closely over them.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 200 CHAPTER XII. VEGETABLES. PREPARATORY REMARKS. Vegetables are always best when newly gathered, and should be brought in from the garden early in the morning; they will then have a fragrant freshness, which they lose by keeping. They must be cleaned with the greatest care, the out- side leaves of every description of greens removed, and they, and all other vegetables, more particularly when not recently gathered, should be laid for several hours in cold water, and well shaken to throw out the insects. A tea- spoonful of salt should always be put into the water in which they are to be boiled, and if it is hard, a tea-spoon- ful of salt of tartar, or potash, may be added to preserve the green colour of the vegetable. All vegetables should be boiled quickly, and, with the exception of spinach, in an open vessel, skimming them carefully. Kitchen greens should be kept in a cool and shady place. Potatoes, carrots, turnips, and beet-root should be stored up, without being cleaned from the earth adhering to them, in layers of sand, or laid in heaps, and covered with earth and straw. Parsnips and skirrets not being207 THE TRACTICE OF COOKERY. injured by frost, are generally left in tbe ground, and taken up as wanted. Onions are stored in a warm, dry place, never in a cellar; they are sometimes strung in bunches, and suspended from the roof, and, more effectually to pre- vent their growing, some people select the finest bulbs, and singe the roots with a hot iron. Herbs of all sorts should be gathered when in flower, and on a dry day, and being well cleaned from dust and dirt, they are tied up in small bunches, and dried before the fire in a Dutch oven. They may then be kept in paper bags labelled ; or rubbed to a powder, sifted, and put into bottles. To Boil large White Cabbages. Wash and clean them thoroughly ; if large, cut them into quarters or divide them; put them on in boiling water, and throw in a little salt; boil them for nearly two hours. To Boil Young Green Cabbages. Wash and clean them well, put them on in boiling water with a little salt in it, and let them boil quickly from three quarters to nearly an hour; serve with melted butter. To Boil Green Peas. After being shelled, wash them, drain them in a cul- lender, put them on in plenty of boiling water, with a tea- spoonful of salt, and one of pounded loaf sugar; boil them till theybecomc tender, which, if young, will be in less than half an hour; if old, they will require more than an hour ; drain them in a cullender, and put them immediately into a dish with a slice of fresh butter in it; some people think it an improvement to boil a small bunch of mint with the202 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. peas; it is then minced finely, and laid in small heaps at the end or sides of the dish. If peas are allowed to stand in the water after being boiled they lose their colour. To Boil Carrots. Scrape, wash, and clean them; if large, cut them into two or four pieces, put them on in boiling water with some salt in it, and boil them from two to three hours. Very young carrots will require one hour. To Boil Parsnips. Scrape and wash them nicely; when large, divide them; boil them in milk and water till quite tender ; they will take nearly as long to boil as carrots. They may also be mashed like turnips. To Boil Potatoes. Wash and pare them, throwing them into cold water as they are pared ; put them into a sauce-pan, cover them with cold water, and throw in a little salt; cover the sauce-pan closely, and let them boil quickly for half an hour, pour off the water immediately, and set the pan by the side of the fire to dry the potatoes. Another way to Boil Potatoes. Wash them very clean, put them on in cold water, cover the sauce-pan, and let them boil quickly; as soon as the water boils, pour it off, and cover them with cold water, add a little salt, and when the water boils pour it off instantly, when the potatoes will be sufficiently done ; dry them, and take off the skins before serving. Some people prefer potatoes being steamed. New potatoes re- quire much less boiling, and will be done enough in twenty minutes ; if allowed to remain long upon the fire, they will become water-soaked. Before dressing they are washed, and the skins rubbed or scraped off. Mashed Potatoes. Boil the potatoes, peel and mash them very smoothly ;THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 203 put for a large dish four ounces of butter, two eggs beat up in half a pint of good milk, and some salt; mix them well together, heap it upon the dish with a table-spoon to give it a rough and rocky appearance, or put it on the dish and score it with a knife, dip a brush or feather into melted butter, and brush over the top lightly ; put it into a Dutch oven, and let it brown gradually for an hour or more. To mash potatoes in a plain way, mix with them two ounces of butter, half a pint of milk, and a little salt. When mashed potatoes are not browned, it is a great improvement to add white pepper, salt, and one onion minced as finely as possible ; heat the potatoes in a sauce- pan, and serve them hot. To Broil Boiled Potatoes. After boiling potatoes, not quite sufficiently to send to table, put them on a gridiron over a clear fire, and turn them frequently till they are'of a nice brown colour all over; serve them hot; take care they do not become too hard, as that spoils the flavour. To Brown Potatoes under Meat while Roasting. After being boiled, lay them on a dish, and place it in the dripping-pan, baste them now and then with a little of the meat dripping, and when one side is browned, turn the other; they should all be of an equal colour. Potatoe Ribands. Wash four or five large potatoes, scrape them, and cut them into thin strips round ahd round, keeping as nearly to one width as possible; throw them into cold water as they are cut, and then fry them of a light brown in boiling beef dripping; strew over them a little 6alt and pepper, and before serving, drain them upon a dish turned up before the fire.the Practice of cookery. 201 Potatoe Eggs. Mash perfectly smooth six or seven boiled potatoes, add a piece of butter the size of a walnut, the beaten yolk of an egg, half an onion pounded, a little boiled minced parsley, some pepper and salt; make it into the form of small eggs or pears, roll them into a well-beaten egg, and then into grated bread seasoned, with white pepper, and Ralt; fry them in plenty of lard or dripping till they are of a fine brown colour, lay them before the fire to drain ; serve them with a fringe of fried parsley. To Fry Potatoes, Raw or Cold. Wash, peel, and put them into cold water for one or two hours, cut them into slices about half an inch thick, and fry them a light brown in boiling clarified beef suet. Cold boiled potatoes, cut into slices, may be done in the same manner. To Roast Potatoes. Wash them very clean, put them into a Dutch oven, turn them frequently, and roast them for two hours, taking care not to let them burn ; or, they may be par- boiled, and then roasted. To Boil Yellow or Large White Turnips. Wash, pare, and throw them into cold water; put them on in boiling water with a little salt, and boil them from two hours to two and a half, drain them in a cul- lender, put them into a sauce-pan, and mixing in a bit of butter, with a beater mash them very smoothly, add half a pint of milk, mix it well with the turnips, and make them quite hotbefore serving. If they are to be served plain, dish them as soon as the water is drained off. To Dress Young White Turnips. Wash, peel, and boil them till tender in water with a little salt; serve them with melted butter poured over them. Or,205 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. They may be stewed iu a pint of milk thickened with a bit of butter rolled in Hour, and seasoned with salt and white pepper, and served with the sauce. To Boil Cauliflower. Trim them neatly, and let them lie an hour or two in cold water, then rinse them in fresh cold water, and put them with a very little salt into boiling water; boil them twenty minutes, or half an hour if very large. They may he boiled in milk and water, and require to be skimmed with particular attention. To Boil Spinach. Pick it very carefully, and wash it thoroughly two or three times in plenty of cold water, then put it on in boiling water with a little salt; let it boil nearly twenty minutes, put it into a cullender, hold it under the water- cock, and let the water run on it for a minute ; put it into a sauce-pan, beat it perfectly smooth with a beater or with a wooden spoon, add a bit of butter, and three table- spoonfuls of cream; mix it well together, and make it hot before serving. When dished, it is scored in squares with the back of a knife. Another way to Boil Spinach. After being nicely picked and well washed, put it into a sauce-pan, with no more water than adheres to it; add a little salt; cover the pan closely, and boil it till tender, frequently shaking it; beat it quite smooth, add- ing butter and cream, and make it quite hot. Spinach may be served with poached eggs, or fried sausages laid on it. When the spinach is bitter, it is preferable to boil it in water. To Dress Spinach. Pick the spinach with great care; strip the leaves from the stalks, and wash it in several waters, till per- fectly clean; boil the spinach in salt and water ; drain it20G THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. well; pound it in a mortar, anil put it into a stew-pan with a little butter and broth, and let it stew over a slow fire for three quarters of an hour, till it be very dry; then add a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, with salt and grated nutmeg; work the spinach well, till it is thick, but take care the butter does not turn to oil. Garnish with fried toasts of bread, which may be cut like cock’s combs, or in any other form. To Boil Windsor Beans. Shell and wash them, put them on in boiling water, with a little salt in it; boil them fifteen or twenty mi- nutes. In Scotland, they are, when old, parboiled, the skins taken oft", and then put on in boiling water, and boiled till tender. When there is neither pickled pork nor bacon at table, parsley and butter is served with them. A Bean Pudding. Take off the skins, pound the beans in a mortar; season with salt and pepper; add a piece of butter; tie it lightly in a buttered and floured cloth. Put it on in boiling water, and boil it for half an hour; squeeze the water from the pudding cloth, and if another shape is desired, put the cloth with the pudding into the shape, press it down, and let it stand a few minutes, then place the dish it is to be served in over the shape, and turn it out. Another Bean Pudding. Boil half a pound of blanched beaus, pound them in a mortar along with the crumb of a new roll soaked in milk; add two ounces of butter, some salt and pepper, and mix it well with the beaten yolks of four eggs. Boil it in a basin, or bake it in a pudding-dish lined with puft" paste. Carrots may be dressed in the same way. To Boil French Beans. Cur off the stalk, and string them ; if not very young,THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 207 cut them in four, or into very tliiu slices; put them into water as they are clone, and put them on in boiling water, with a little salt, and let them boil for half an hour. If they are old, they will require a longer time to boil. Melted butter in a sauce-tureen is served with them. To Boil Asparagus. Wash them well, scrape, and tie them up in small bundles; cut them all even at the bottom, and, as they are done, put them into cold water. Put them on in boiling water, with a little salt, and let them boil twenty or twenty-five minutes. Take them up, lay them upon a slice of toasted bread cut in four, and the crusts pared oft-, with the tops meeting in the middle of the dish, and cut off the strings. Melted butter is served in a sauce- tureen. Chardoons may be dressed in the same manner. Asparagus a la Francaise. Boil it, and chop small the heads and tender part of the stalks, together with a boiled onion ; add a little salt and pepper, and the beaten yolk of an egg; heat it up. Serve it on sippets of toasted bread, and pour over it a little melted butter. To Boil Brocoli. Wash it, cut off all the outside leaves and stalks, throw it into cold water as it is trimmed; put it on in boiling water, with a little salt, and boil it for twenty minutes or half an hour. It is sometimes served upon bits of toasted bread, and a little melted butter poured round it. To Boil Brussels Sprouts. Trim and wash them perfectly clean, and let them lie an hour in cold water. Put them on in boiling water, with a little salt, and boil them till tender. Drain off the water, and serve them hot.208 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. To Boil Sea Cale. Let it lie some time in cold water, then clean and trim it nicely, cutting off any part that may be at all green, and parting it as little as possible. Put it on in boiling water, with a little salt. Let it boil half an hour ; drain oft' the water. Pare the crust off" a slice of toasted bread, lay it in the dish, pour over it a little melted butter, and serve the cale upon it. To Boil Artichokes. Cut off the stalks close to the bottom, wash them well, and let them lie for some hours in cold water ; put them on m boiling water, with a little salt in it, cover the pan closely, and boil them an hour and a half. If they are old, and have not been fresh gathered, they will take a longer time to boil. Melted butter is served with them in a sauce-tureen. To Dry and Pickle Artichoke Bottoms. Half boil the artichokes, strip off the leaves, and pull out the choke ; put the bottoms into small jars, and cover them with a cold boiled brine of salt and water; put melted mutton suet on the top to exclude the air, and tie bladder over them. To dry them, they are boil- ed as for eating, the leaves and choke pulled out, and the bottoms dried upon dishes in an oven, and then kept in paper bags. When to be dressed, they must be laid into warm water, and soaked for two or three hours; they may then be plain boiled, and eaten with melted butter, or stewed in gravy with a little mushroom catsup, pepper, and salt, and thickened with a bit of butter rolled in flour. They are a great improvement to all made dishes and meat pies. To Fricassee Jerusalem Artichokes. Wash and scrape or pare them; boil them in milk- and-water till they are soft, which will be from a quarter to half an hour. Take them out and stew them a fewTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 209 minutes in the following sauce : Roll a bit of butter, the size of a walnut, in flour, mix it with half a pint of cream or milk; season it with white pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg. They may be served plain boiled, with a little melted butter poured over them. Scorzonera is fricasseed in the same manner. Onions Plain Boiled. Peel them, and let them lie an hour in cold water, put them on in boiling milk-and-water; boil them till tender, and serve them with melted butter poured over them. To Stew Cucumbers. Pare eight or ten large cucumbers, and cut them into thick slices, flour them well, and fry them in butter; then put them into a sauce-pan with a tea-cupful of gravy; season it highly with cayenne, salt, mushroom catsup, and a little port wine. Let them stew for an hour, and serve them hot. Another way to Stew Cucumbers. Pare the cucumbers, and let them lie in vinegar and water, with a little salt in it; drain them, and put them into a sauce-pan, with a pint of gravy, a slice of lean ham, an onion stuck with one or two cloves, a bunch of pars- ley and thyme; let them stew, closely covered, till ten- der. Take out the cucumbers, strain and thicken the gravy with a piece of butter rolled in flour. Boil it up and pour it over the cucumbers. Another way to Stew Cucumbers. Pare a number of cucumbers, slice them the long way, and put them for one hour into salt, vinegar, and wa- ter ; drain them ; slice three large onions, and put them with the cucumbers into a frying-pan, with a bit of butter and some pepper. Fry them till they are of a nice light brown colour, stirring them frequently; cover them with a o210 THE PRACTICE OP COOKERY". large plate, and let them stew gently over a slow fire till they are very tender, which will require a length of time. Cucumbers dressed in this manner are particularly good with roast mutton. To Stew Mushrooms. Clean them as for pickling, and after washing them, put them into a sauce-pan, with an anchovy, two cloves, some nutmeg sliced, mace, whole pepper, and salt; let them stew in their own liquor till tender. In this way they will keep for some time, and when required to be dressed, pick out the spice, and to a dish put two large table-spoonfuls of white wine ; add part of their own liquor, and let them just boil, then stir in a bit of butter dredged with flour, and two table-spoonfuls of cream. Another way to Stew Mushrooms. For a good-sized dish, take a pint of white stock, sea- son it with salt, pepper, and a little lemon pickle, thick- en it with a bit of butter rolled in flour; cleanse and peel the mushrooms, sprinkle them with a very little salt, boil them for three or four minutes, put them into the gravy when it is hot, and stew them for fifteen minutes. Another way to Stew Mushrooms. Peel off the skin, and cut away the stalks; brown a little butter and flour, then add some gravy seasoned with pepper and salt. Put in the mushrooms, and let them stew very gently for three quarters of an hour. If required to be done with a white sauce, follow the same method as with the onions, and when dished, serve them with sippets of bread. To Stew Onions. Take a dozen of good-sized onions, peel and put them on in the following sauce: A pint of veal stock, a bit of butter rolled in flour, a little white pepper, and salt. Stew them gently for an hour, and, just before serving,THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 211 mix in three table-spoonfuls of cream. To stew them in a brown sauce, take the same quantity of good gravy. In a stew-pan brown, of a light colour, a little butter and dour, add the gravy and onions, with a little pepper and salt, and stew them gently one hour. Another way to Stew Onions. Peel five or six large onions, put them into a Dutch oven or cheese-toaster to roast, turn them frequently, and when they are well browned, put them into a sauce- pan, with a bone of dressed or undressed meat, a slice of bacon, a little water, and some pepper. Cover the pan closely, and stew them till tender. Take out the bone and the bacon; thicken the sauce with a bit of butter rolled in flour. To Roast Onions. Roast them with the skins on in a Dutch oven, that they may brown equally. They are eaten with cold fresh butter, pepper, and salt. To Stew Red Cabbage. Wash a cabbage well, slice it as for pickling, and put it into a stew-pan, with half a tea-cupful of port wine, and a bit of butter kneaded in flour, a little salt and pepper; stir it till the butter is melted; cover the pan, and let it stew a little, but not to become too soft, as it eats better rather crisp ; add a table-spoonful of vi- negar, give it one boil, and serve it hot. The wine may be omitted. A Stew of Vegetables. Pick and wash very clean as much spinach as will make a dish ; mince finely three small onions, pick and chop two handfuls of parsley; put all into a sauce-pan, with rather more than half a pint of gravy, a bit of but- ter dusted with flour, a little salt and pepper. Cover the pan closely, stir it now and then, and when the spinach212 THE Pit ACT ICE OF COOKERY. is tender, mash it smooth. Serve it with slices of broiled ham, or with sausages. To Stew Old Peas. Put into a sauce-pan a pint of weak stock, a slice of ham or bacon, and a quart or three pints of peas, and a tea-spoonful of pounded loaf sugar. Cover the pan close- ly, and stew them nearly an hour, or till they become tender. Take out the ham, and add a bit of butter roll- ed in flour. Serve them quite hot. To Stew Beet Root. Mix half an ounce of butter with a little flour, melt it in rather more than half a pint of water, add some salt and pepper. Wash a middling-sized root, scrape and cut it into slices, put it into the sauce-pan, with the but- ter. Cover the pan closely, and stew it for an hour and ten minutes. Before serving, add a large table-spoonful of vinegar. To Stew Celery. Wash and clean some heads of celery, cut them into pieces of two or three inches long, boil them in veal stock till tender. To half a pint of cream add the well- beaten yolks of two eggs, a bit of lemon-peel, grated nut- meg, and salt, also a bit of butter; make it hot, stirring it constantly; strain it upon the celery; heat it thorough- ly, but do not let it boil. To Stew Sorrel a la Fran9oise. Strip the leaves from the stalks, wash them well, scald them in boiling water in a silver sauce-pan, or in an earthen pipkin ; strain and 6tew them in a little gravy till tender. Serve with hard-boiled eggs cut in quarters. Endive with Gravy of Veal. Wash and clean thoroughly ten or twelve heads of fine endive, take off the outer leaves, and blanch the heads in hot water; throw them into cold water, and213 1'ilE practice of cookery. then squeeze them as dry as possible. Stew them in as much gravy as will cover them; add a tea-spoonful of pounded sugar, and a little salt. When perfectly tender, put in a little veloute sauce, and serve quite hot. To Stew Young Peas and Lettuce. Wash and make perfectly clean one or two heads of cabbage lettuce, pick off the outside leaves, and lay them for two hours in cold water with a little salt in it; then slice them, and put them into a sauce-pan, with a quart or three pints of peas, three table-spoonfuls of gravy, a bit of butter dredged with flour, some pepper and salt, and a tea-spoonful of pounded loaf sugar. Let them stew, closely covered, till the peas are soft. To Dress Dried French Beans. Boil for more than two hours, in two quarts of water, a pound of the seeds or beans of scarlet runners; fill a pint basin with onions peeled and sliced, brown them in a sauce-pan, with rather more than a quarter of a pound of fresh butter; stir them constantly; strain the water from the beans, and mix them with the onions; add a tea-spoon- ful of black pepper, some salt, and a little gravy. Let them stew for ten minutes, and stir in the beaten yolks of two eggs, and a table-spoonful of vinegar. Serve them hot. To Dress Cliardoons. Choose a few heads of nice white cbardoons, cut the leaves into pieces of six inches long, rejecting those that are hollow ; take off their prickles, and throw the thickest pieces into boiling water; after those have boiled a little, put in the more tender leaves and the stalks. When it is ascertained, by trying a little piece in cold water, that the surface slime will come off by rubbing, take them immediately off the fire, and mix in as much cold water as will admit of the hands being held in it; then rub off all the slime, and throw the cliardoons into a stew-pan, with some good gravy, a little salt, and a little sugar. Boil them over a quick fire, skim them carefully, strain2] 1 THE PRACTICE OF COOKEIIV. the sauce through a sieve, pour it over them, and serve them quite hot. Skirrets. Wash and scrape them, put them on in boiling water, and boil them for ten minutes; dry them in a cullender, and fry them brown in a little butter. They are sometimes plain boiled, and a little melted butter poured over them. Vegetable Marrow Is fit for use when about the size of a turkey’s egg. After being washed clean, it is put on in boiling water, with a little salt, and when tender, it is drained from the water, cut into half, and served on toasted bread over which some melted butter has been poured. Or, after being boiled in milk and water, they may be fricasseed as Jeru- salem artichokes, or stewed like cucumbers. Peas for a Second Course Dish, a la Fran^oise. Put a quart of fine green peas, together with a bit of butter the size of a walnut, into as much warm water as will cover them, in which let them stand for eight or ten minutes. Strain off the water, put them into a sauce- pan, cover it, stir them frequently, and when a little ten- der, add a bunch of parsley, and a cibol or a young onion, nearly a dessert-spoonful of loaf sugar, and an ounce of butter mixed w'ith a tea-spoonful of flour; keep stirring them now and then till the peas be tender, and add, if they become too thick, a table-spoonful of hot water. Be- fore serving, take out the cibol and bunch of parsley. A Summer Salad. Wash very clean one or two heads of fine lettuce, di- vide it, let it lie some time in cold water; drain and dry it in a napkin, and cut it small before serving. Mustard and cresses, sorrel and young onions, may be added, and the dish garnished with Nesturtiam flowers.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 215 A Winter Salad. Wash very clean one or two heads of endive, some heads of celery, some mustard and cresses; cut them all small, add a little shredded red cabbage, some slices of boiled beet-root and onion, if the flavour is not disliked ; mix them together with salad sauce. In spring, add ra- dishes, and also garnish the dish with them. Laver Is dressed in a silver dish over a lamp ; a bit of fresh butter, and the juice of a Seville orange, are stirred into it till quite hot. It is sent to table in the dish over the lamp. This plant grows upon rocks on the sea shore. It is much used in Wales, and is sent to London in jars pre- pared for dressing. To Dress the Leaves of White Beet. Pick and wash them clean, put them on in boiling water with a little salt, cover the sauce-pan, and boil them longer than spinach ; drain off the water, and beat them as spinach, with a bit of butter and a little salt. To Dress French Beans. Trim some nice young French beans, and boil them in salt-and-water ; drain them quite dry, and pour over them the following sauce : Boil a little sauce tournee, and thick- en it with the beaten yolks of two eggs and a little fine- ly-chopped parsley, with a piece of fresh butter, a little pepper, salt, and the juice of a lemon added, and all stir- red till hot. Or, put them into a stew-pan, and when quite hot, add a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, a lit- tle pepper, salt, and the juice of half a lemon ; shake the stew-pan frequently, but do not use a spoon. If the butter does not mix well, add half a spoonful of sauce tournee.216 THE PRACTICE OP COOKERY. To Fricassee French Beans. Boil the beans as for eating, and having strained off the water, put them into a sauce-pan ; with half a pint of cream, dredge in a little flour and grated nutmeg. Make them hot before serving. Peas Pudding. Put a quart of split peas to soak for two hours into warm water; boil them in soft water, with a bit of butter, till sufficiently tender to press through a sieve ; pulp them, and add the beaten yolk of one egg, a little pepper and salt, and an ounce of butter. Tie it into a buttered and floured cloth, and put it on in boiling water; boil it nearly an hour. To Preserve Green Peas for Winter Use. Fill wide-mouthed quart bottles to the neck with green peas, place them upon the fire in a pan of cold water, and when it boils, take them out, and immediately cork them tightly, and seal them. Keep them in a cool place. Another way to Preserve Green Peas. Put into a sauce-pan of boiling water fresh-gathered and fresh-shelled peas, but not very young; as soon as they boil up, pour off the water, and put them upon a large dry cloth folded, and then rfpon another, that they may be perfectly dry without being bruised ; let them lie some time before the fire, and then put them into small paper bags, each containing about a pint, and hang them up in the kitchen. Before using, soak them for two or three hours in water, and then boil them as directed for green peas, adding a little bit of butter, when they are put on to boil. To Keep French Beans for Winter Use. Gather them when young, and on a dry day, put a layer of salt into a jar, and then one of about two inchesTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 217 thick of beans; do this till the jar be nearly full; place a small plate upon the top of them, and tie bladder close- ly over the jar; keep it in a cool dry place. When to be used, soak them a night in cold water, and change it on them repeatedly in the course of the day they are to be dressed. Cut them, and put them on in boiling wa- ter. To make Sour Krout. The best cabbage for this purpose is the drum, or white Strasburgh, and it should not be used till it lias endured some severe frost; the stocks are then cut into halves, and shred down as fine as possible with a knife, or more properly with a plane made in the form of a cucumber slice. Burn a little juniper in a cask or tub which is perfectly sound and clean, and put a little leaven into the seam round the bottom, —flour and vinegar may be substituted for leaven ; then put in three or four handfuls of cabbage, a good sprink- ling of salt, and a tea-spoonful of caraway seed, and press this hard with a wooden mallet; next add another layer of cabbage, with salt and caraway seed, as at first; and so on in the same manner until the cask be full, pressing down each layer firmly as you advance. A good deal of water will come to the top, of which a part may be ta- ken off. The cask being full, put on the head so as to press upon the cabbage, and place it in a warm cellar to ferment; when it has worked well for three weeks, take off the scum which will have gathered on the top, and lay a clean cloth on the krout; replace the head, and put two or three heavy stones upon it. The juice should al- ways stand upon the top. Thus in a good cellar it will keep for years. When to be dressed, it is boiled for five or six hours in water, or stewed with a little gravy, and may be also substituted for a crust over a beef-steak pie, when cheese is grated over it.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 218 CHAPTER XIII. PUDDINGS, PIES, AND TARTS. PREPARATORY REMARKS. Great nicety is to be observed in preparing every material used for boiled or baked puddings. The eggs require to be well beaten, for which purpose, if many are to be done, a whisk is used ; if few, a three- pronged fork. The flour is dried and sifted. The cur- rants are carefully cleaned, by putting them into a cul- lender, and pouring warm water over them ; if very dirty, this is to be repeated two or three times, and after being dried in a dish before the fire, they are rubbed in a clean coarse cloth, all the stalks and stones picked out, and then a little flour dredged over them. The raisins are stoned with a small sharp-pointed knife ; it is cleansed in a basin of water, which also receives the seed. The pudding cloth must be kept especially clean, or it will impart an unpleasant taste to any thing that is boiled in it; and when taken off a pudding, it ought immediately to be laid into cold water, and afterwards well washed with soda or pearl-ashes in hot water. Just before being used for a rice, bread, or batter pudding, it should be dipped into hot water, wrung, shaken, and well dredged with flour; and for a plum, suet pudding, or any sort of210 TIIE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. fruit pudding in paste, it must be buttered before being floured. All puddings in paste are tied tightly, but other pud- dings loosely, in the cloth. When a pudding is to be boiled in a shape, a piece of buttered white paper is put upon the top of it, before the floured cloth is tied on. The pan, dish, or shape, in which a pudding is to be either boiled or baked, must always be buttered before it is filled. It is an im- provement to puddings in general to let them stand some time after being prepared either for boiling or baking. When a pudding is to be boiled, it must be put on in a covered pot, in plenty of boiling water, and never for a moment be allowed to be oflf the boil until ready to be served. As the water wastes, more, and always boiling, must be added. A plum-pudding is the better for being mixed the day before it is to be boiled. It may be useful to observe that this pudding will keep for months after it is dressed, if the cloth be allowed to remain upon it, and if, when cold, it be covered with a sheet of foolscap paper, and then hung up in a cool place. When about to be used, it must be put into a clean cloth, and again boil- ed for an hour; or it may be cut into slices, and broiled as wanted. If in breaking eggs a bad one should acci- dentally drop into the basin amongst the rest, the whole will be spoiled ; and therefore they should be broken one by one into a tea-cup. When the whites only of eggs are required for jelly, or other things, the yolks, if not bro- ken, will keep good for two or three days, if the basin they are in be covered. A slab of marble, stone, or slate, is preferable to wood for rolling out paste on. The rolling-pin, cutters, and every other implement used in these processes, must be kept particularly clean ; they should always be washedTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 220 immediately after being used, and then well dried. Before using butter for paste, it is laid for some time into cold water, which is changed once or twice. When salt butter is used, it is well worked in two or three waters. If it should not be convenient to make the paste immediately before it is baked, it will not suffer from standing, if made early in the morning, and the air excluded from it, by putting first a tin cover over the pie or tartlets, and above that a folded table-cloth. To ascertain if the oven be of a proper heat, a little bit of paste may be baked in it, before any thing else be put in. Puff paste requires rather a brisk oven. If too hot it binds the surface and pre- vents the steam from rising, and if too slow it becomes sodden and flat. Raised crusts require a quick oven; puffs and tartlets, which are filled with preserved fruit, are sufficiently done when the paste is baked. When large pies have been in the oven for a few minutes, a paper is put over them to prevent their being burned. Cheese cakes, queen cakes, spunge biscuits, and small spunge cakes, require a quick oven till they have risen ; afterwards the heat should be more moderate. Plum, seed cakes, and all large kinds, must be well soaked, and there- fore do not require a brisk oven. To preserve their colour, a sheet of white paper is put over them, and after they have risen and become firm, they are turned round. To ascer- tain if a large cake be sufficiently done, a broad-bladed knife is plunged into the centre of it, and if dry and clean when drawn out, the cake is baked; but if anything ad- heres to the blade, it must instantly be returned to t{ie oven, and the door closed. When the oven is too hot, it is better to lessen the fire than to open the door.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 221 Puff Paste. Weigh an equal quantity of flour and butter, rub ra- ther more than the half of the flour into one-third of the butter, then add as much cold water as will make it into a stiff paste; work it until the butter be completely mixed with the Hour, make it round, beat it with the rolling- pin, dust it, as also the rolling-pin, with dour, and roll it out towards the opposite side of the slab, or paste-board, making it of an equal thickness ; then with the point of a knife put little bits of butter all over it, dust dour over and under it, fold in the sides and roll it up, dust it again with dour, beat it a little, and roll it out, always rubbing the rolling-pin with dour, and throwing some underneath the paste, to prevent its sticking to the board. If the butter is not all easily put in at the second time of roll- ing out the paste, the remainder may be put in at the third; it should be touched as little as possible with the hands. Another Puff Paste. Make nearly all the dour into a stiff paste with cold water, knead it well, and divide it into two, roll out each piece rather more than a quarter of an inch thick; take the butter out of the water, and with the hands pat it out into a cake or dat piece, dour one piece of the paste, lay on it the butter, which is then domed and covered with the other piece of paste; datten it a little with the roll- ing-pin, and then roll it out, dusting the paste and the pin with dour before and after rolling, fold in the sides, roll it up and repeat the rolling out, folding up, and dust- ing with dour, till the buttpr is incorporated thoroughly with the paste. Puff paste, if good, will rise into blisters in the course of rolling it out; it may be made with three quarters of a pound of butter to one of dour; the dour should be dried, and is the better for being sifted. When the paste is rolled out for the last time, and made a quarter of an inch thick, place upon it the dish to be covered, andTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 222 having dipped the paste-cutter into flour, run it round by the rim ; the cover being thus cut, lay it aside, and cut a border for the rim of the dish; wet it with water, and lay on the border, brush it over with a little water, and put on the cover; ornament it with the paste-cutter, notching it all round the edge ; make a hole in the middle, take a small bit of paste, roll it out as thin as paper, dust it with flour, and fold it in four pinch, or gather it round, wet it, and put it into the opening in the pie, which must also be wetted, cut it twice across, and with the knife turn out the folds to resemble leaves; this or- nament is for meat pies; those of fruit have merely a small hole made in the centre. Paste for Cheese Cakes. Rub equal quantities of flour and butter together, with a little pounded and sifted loaf sugar, make it into a paste with warm milk, roll it out, and line the pans with it. Crisp Paste. Rub a quarter of a pound of butter into a pound of flour, add two table-spoonfuls of pounded loaf sugar, and the well-beaten yolks of two or three eggs, work it well with a horn-spoon, and roll it out very thin, touching it as little as possible with the hands; the moment before putting it into a quick oven rub it over with the well- beaten white of an egg, and sift all over the tart finely- pounded sugar. This crust may be used for any fruit tarts. Rich Short Paste. Weigh equal quantities of flour, of butter, and of pounded and sifted loaf sugar; rub the butter with the flour, then mix in the sugar, and rub it together till it will roll out; put it about half an inch thick over the tart, which may be of cherries, raspberries, or currants. Another Rich Short Paste. Rub into three quarters of a pound of flour a quarter223 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. of a pound of lard and a spoonful of grated sugar. Make it into a paste with milk, roll it out, and add a quarter of a pound of butter. For a fruit tart it must be rolled out half an inch thick. Fine Paste. Dry and sift a pound of flour, weigh half a pound of butter and two ounces of fresh hog’s lard; mix with the flour two well-beaten whites of eggs, and add as much water as will make it into a stiff paste ; work it well, roll it out, and put over it the butter and hog’s lard; flour it, and fold in the sides, and roll it till the butter is well mixed with the paste. Paste for a Common Dumpling. Rub into a pound of flour six ounces of butter, then work it into a paste with two well-beaten eggs and a little water. This paste may be baked, a large table- spoonful of pounded loaf sugar being added to it. Tart Paste. Rub into half a pound of flour six ounces of butter and one table-spoonful of pounded loaf sugar, make it into a paste with hot water. Sweet Paste. Rub into half a pound of flour three ounces of butter and the same of pounded loaf sugar, add one beaten egg, and as much warm water as will make it into a paste; roll it thin for any kind of fruit tart, rub it over with the beaten white of an egg, and sift sugar over it. Rich Paste for Tarts and Cheese Cakes. Pound and sift six ounces of loaf sugar, and add it by degrees to eight ounces of fresh butter beaten to a cream ; beat four eggs till very light, and add them, together with a little grated lemon-peel, some cinnamon or nutmeg. Stir in dried and sifted flour, to make it into a paste, but not very stiff.224 THE PRACTICE or COOKERY. Paste for Tarts. Mix one ounce of grated and sifted loaf sugar with one pound of flour, make it into a stiff paste with a gill of boiling cream ; work well into it three ounces of but- ter, and roll it out very thin. Rice Paste. Mix together half a pound of sifted ground rice and a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, work it into a paste with cold water, dredge flour over the paste-board and rolling-pin, roll out the paste, and put over it, in little bits, another quarter of a pound of butter; fold and roll it out three times, strewing each time a little flour over and under it, as also over the rolling-pin. Cover the tart, and glaze it before being baked. This paste must be eaten the day it is baked. Another Rice Paste. Boil, in a pint of water, half a pound of good rice; drain off the water, and pound the rice in a mortar, with a small bit of butter, and an egg beaten; then roll it out to cover any fruit tart. Potatoe Paste. Mash sixteen ounces of boiled potatoes, while they are warm, then rub them between the hands, together with twelve ounces of flour; when it is well mixed, and all looks like flour, add half a tea-spoonful of salt, and, with a little cold water, make it into a stiff paste; beat and roll it out three or four times, making it very thin the last time. Lay over it black currant jam, raspber- ries, or any sort of preserve, rub the edges with water, roll it up like a bolster pudding, and boil it in a buttered and floured cloth for three or four hours. Serve it with a sweet sauce. Suet Paste. Rub well with half a pound of fresh beef suet, chop- 1225 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. ped as finely as possible, three quarters of a pound of flour, and half a tea-spoonful of salt; make it into a stiff paste with cold water, work it well, beat it with the roll- ing-pin, and roll it out two or three times. This paste answers for any kind of boiled fruit pudding. Another Suet Paste. Cut small three quarters of a pound of fresh beef suet, pound it very finely in a mortar with a little lukewarm milk, carefully picking out all the strings; make it up into a roll, and rub it into a pound and a half of flour; moisten it with milk, and roll it out three or four times. Paste for Family Pies. Rub into one pound and a half of flour half a pound of butter, wet it with cold water sufficient to make it in- to a stiff' paste ; work it well, and roll it out two or three times. Beef Dripping Paste. Rub into one pound of flour half a pound of clarified beef dripping, till it all look like flour; work it to a stiff paste with cold water, and roll it out two or three times. This paste answers very well for common pies, but must be used when hot and fresh baked. Raised Crust. Melt, in one pint of water, one pound of fresh lard; weigh four pounds of flour, put it into a basin, and when the water and lard is hot, with a horn spoon stir it by de- grees amongst the flour. When well mixed, work it with the hands till it is a stiff paste, when it is fit for use. Another Raised Crust. Put into a sauce-pan one pint and a half of water, four pounds of flour, and four ounces and a half of but- ter ; stir it till it is a thick paste, take it out, and add the yolks of three or four beaten eggs; work it well together, roll it out rather more than half an inch thick; cut out p226 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. the top and bottom, and a long piece of a proper depth for the sides. Brush round the bottom with well-beaten whites of eggs; set on the sides, keeping the paste la- ther within the edge of the bottom ; pinch it all round, to make the pieces adhere, then fill the pie, and brush round the upper sides of the crust and the outer edges of the cover with egg; lay on the cover, pinch it round neatly, and ornament it according to fancy with leaves, festoons, or chains of rings made of the paste. Fine Icing for Tarts and Puffs. Pound and sift four ounces of refined loaf sugar, beat up the white of an egg, and by degrees add to it the sugar, till it look white and is thick. W hen the tarts are baked, lay the icing over the top with a brush or feather, and then return them to the oven to harden, but take care that it do not become brown. Vol-au-Vent. Roll out puff paste] about half an inch thick, lay upon it a small oval flat dish, and cut out, with a paste cutter, two pieces the same size. Butter the dish, and lay upon it one piece of the paste; brush over the edge to the width of the rim of the dish with water, and lay upon it the second piece of paste, and with a tin cutter, the size of the inner part of the dish, cut the paste near- ly through, or cut it round with a knife. Bake it of a light brown colour. Cut off the central part, and fill it with pulled chicken or turkey, minced veal, stewed oys- ters, or any sort of fricassee. Put on the top, and serve it on a napkin. Pheasant Pie. Cut off the heads of a brace of pheasants, and bone them carefully; make a forcemeat of grated bread, pound- ed veal, and fat bacon, in equal quantities, and half the quantity of one of these of minced beef suet, also a little grated lean ham ; season it with truffles, nutmeg, mace, pepper, and salt; a very little garlic is an improvement; bind it with the beaten yolks of eggs. Put a part of it227 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. inside of the pheasants, and fry them for a few minutes. Put them into a standing crust, or a deep dish, lined with slices of fat bacon and some forcemeat laid at the bot- tom ; add a glass of brandy, some truffles, and more of the forcemeat; then lay slices of fat bacon over the whole. If in a dish, cover it with a coarse paste, and bake it for four or five hours. When the pie is to be used, take off the coarse paste, and put over the dish a rich puff paste, and when this is sufficiently baked, it may be served. Chickens, partridges, or grouse, may be substituted for pheasants, and mushrooms for truffles. Partridge Pie. Truss half a dozen partridges in the same way in which chickens are done for boiling, and season them with pepper, salt, and mace. For a forcemeat, bake in an oven two pounds of lean veal, and half a pound of lean ham sliced, and seasoned with a shalot, parsley, and le- mon thyme minced, white pepper, nutmeg, and salt, and with half a pound of butter put over it. When the meat is perfectly tender, drain it, pound it in a mortal’, and then mix with it the liquor. To a part of this forcemeat add grated bread and a little chopped fat bacon; put a bit of it, the size of a walnut, into each bird. Make a raised crust, and form it of an oblong shape; put into the bottom a layer of sliced bacon and one of veal, and some artichoke bottoms, cut small; lay in the partridges, over them a layer of forcemeat an inch thick, and then slices of fat bacon ; brush the edges of the top and sides with the beaten-up white of an egg, put on the top, and pinch it close. It will take three hours and a half to bake; and before serving, the outside should be brushed over with the white of an egg, and covered neatly with foolscap paper, cut into a fringe, round the top. This pie may be baked in a dish, and the forcemeat made of cold ham and roast veal pounded. Goose Pie. Prepare a very strong raised crust, and make theTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 228 sides thick and stiff. Take the bones out of a goose, turkey, and fowl, cutting each down the back; season them highly with pepper, salt, mace, cloves, and nutmeg, all finely pounded and well mixed. Lay the goose upon a dish, with the breast skin next the dish ; lay in the tur- key, put some slices of boiled ham and tongue, and then the fowl; cover it with little bits of ham or bacon. Put it all into the pie, made of an oval form, and the sides to stand an inch and a half above the meat; put on the top, and make a hole in the centre of it. Brush the outside of the pie all over with the beaten whites of eggs, and bind it round with three folds of buttered paper; paste the top over in the same way, and when it comes out of the oven, take off the paper, and pour in at the top, through a funnel, a pound and a half of melted butter. Sweetbread and Palate Pie. Scald the sweetbreads, and when quite cold, fry them a nice brown ; boil the palates tender, skin, and cut them into square pieces. Brown a bit of butter with flour, and a pint of good gravy seasoned highly with spice and salt; put in the sweetbreads and palates, and let them stew till nearly ready for eating. Lay them into the pie-dish, and break down in the sauce the yolks of two hard-boil- ed eggs, and add it. This pie is better to be prepared the day before it is required. Cover it with a rich puff paste, and when the paste is sufficiently baked, the pie may be served. Another Sweetbread Pie. Parboil five or six sweetbreads; cut them into two or three pieces, stew them ten or fifteen minutes in a lit- tle white stock, with some chopped shalot, a bit of but- ter rolled in flour, some salt, and white pepper, and a good many mushrooms. Put them into a pie- dish, with some asparagus tops, forcemeat balls, and hard-boiled yolks of eggs, and slices of fat bacon on the top; cover it, and bake it till the paste be done enough ; or it may229 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. ■be put into a volau-vent, and served upon a napkin; or ■baked in a pate. French Pie. Mince some cold roast veal together with a little ham, season it highly with pepper, salt, mace, and lemon peel; add a large table-spoonful of mushroom catsup, and a quarter of a hundred of oysters, with their liquor, and three or four table-spoonfuls of rich gravy. Line a dish with puff paste, put in the ingredients, cover the pie, and let it remain in the oven only long enough to bake the paste. . Beef-Steak Pie. Cut the steaks off a rump, or any nice piece of beef, fat and lean together, about half an inch thick; beat them a little with a rolling-pin, put over them some pep- per, salt, and parboiled onion minced; roll them up, and pack them neatly into the dish, or lay the beef in slices; add some spoonfuls of gravy, and a tea-spoonful of vine- gar. Cover the pie with a puff paste, and bake it for an hour. It is a common but mistaken opinion, that it is neces- sary to put stock or water into meat pies. Beef, mut- ton, veal, and pork, if not previously dressed, will be found to yield a sufficiency of gravy, and the pie will be better without any additional liquid. Veal Pie. Cut a neck of veal into neat steaks, season them well with white pepper, salt, mace, and grated nutmeg mixed; pack them closely into a dish, and put in half a pint of white stock ; five hard-boiled yolks .of eggs may be added ; put puff paste on the edge of the dish, and cover with the same. Lambs’ tails may be made into a pie, with lamb chops seasoned in the same manner as the above. Another Veal Pie. Cut into steaks a loin or breast of veal, season them highly with white pepper, salt, grated nutmeg, mace, andTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 230 a little lemon peel mixed; lay them into the bottom of a dish, and then a few slices of sweetbreads seasoned with the spices; add some oysters, forcemeat balls, and hard-boiled yolks of eggs, half a pint of white stock, a glass of white wine, and a table-spoonful of lemon pickle ; put puff paste on the edge of the dish, and cover with the same; bake it for one hour. Another Veal Pie.

Put into the bottom of a pie-dish a table- spoonful of brown sugar, with half a tea-spoonful of gra- ted ginger and lemon peel, then a layer of apples, and so on alternately, till the dish is piled as full as it will hold. The next day wet the rim of the dish, line it with puff or tart paste, brusli it with water, and cover it with paste ; press the edge all round, notch it with a paste cutter, and make a small hole with the point of a knife in the middle. It may be seasoned with two table-spoonfuls of lemon or orange marmalade, pounded cinnamon, mace, and cloves, in addition to the ginger and lamon peel. Currant Tart. To a quart of red currants add one pint of red rasp- berries, strawberries, or cherries; sweeten them well with brown sugar; before putting in the fruit, line the side of the dish with tart paste, place in it a small tea-cup, put in the fruit, and cover it with paste.

Rub over patty-pans a little bit of butter, and line them with tart or puff' paste; fill them with marmalade, pre- served strawberries, raspberries, currants, or any sort of fruit. Take a small bit of the paste, and, with the hand, roll it upon the paste board with flour till it be stiff, and will draw out in straws; hold it on one hand, and with the other draw it out. With these small strings cross the tartlets according to fancy; wet the edge, and lay on a narrow rim of paste cut with the paste cutter.216 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Another way to make Tartlets. Roll out the paste about a quarter of an inch thick, and lay upon it the top part of the patty-pan; cut it round with the paste cutter. Rub the patty-pans with a little butter, and line them with the paste, and place in the middle a little bit of bread, which take out when they are baked. They may be filled with any preserved fruit, and a star or leaf of paste placed on the top.

The preserves may be heated by placing the jars in hot water by the side of the fire. Fondeux. Beat separately the yolks and whites of four eggs; add to the yolks a pint of cream, and half a pound of grated Parmesan cheese; mix in the whites of the eggs just before putting it into paper cases ; or bake it in a round tin about three inches high, and before serving it, which should be instantly when taken out of the oven, put round it a sheet of white paper folded, and cut so as to form a fringe at the top. Any mild, dry cheese may be used, and butter beat- en to a cream substituted for cream. Another way to make Fondeux. Mix by degrees, with a quarter of a pound of flour, half a pint of cream, and half an ounce of butter; put it into a sauce-pan, and stir it over the fire till quite thick; add five yolks of eggs well-beaten, with half a pint of new milk, and two ounces of grated Parmesan cheese ; stir it together in a basin, and mix in lightly the five whites of eggs beaten to a stiff froth; bake it in a tin, lined with puff paste, for half an hour; turn it out instantly to serve. A soufflet pudding may be made exactly in this way, substituting sugar for the cheese. Omelette Soufflet. Beat, with the yolks of ten eggs, four table-spoonfuls of pounded sugar, and half the peel of a grated lemon : add, the instant before putting into the pan, the well-beat- en whites of the eggs ; fry it in a quarter of a pound of fresh butter ; shake it, to prevent its adhering to the pan ; when firm, sift grated sugar over the top, and brown it with a salamander or hot shovel; serve it immediately, when done.28 G THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Another way to make Omelette Soufflet.

Rice Soufflet. Soak in half a pint of milk, for an hour, one ounce of rice, and the peel of a lemon cut thin ; put it into a sauce- pan, with a little salt, and add by degrees a pint of new milk, and a bit of butter the size of a walnut; stir it till it boil, and for five minutes after. When cool, add the yolks of six eggs, beaten with two table-spoonfuls of pounded loaf sugar, and stir in the well-beaten whites of the eggs, and dress the soufflet in the dish like a pyra- mid. Bake it in an oven. It may be made with two table-spoonfuls of potatoe flour, which mix with a little milk, and a little salt, and then thicken it over the fire with more milk ; put a little orange-flower water, or any other perfume ; whilst in the oven, it may be glazed with sifted loaf sugar.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 2S7 Orange Soufflet.

Blanch and pound with two table-spoonfuls of orange- flower water a quarter of a pound of almonds, add rather more than a pint of cream, and the well-beaten yolks of six eggs; sweeten with pounded loaf sugar, and stir it over a slow fire till it thickens ; but do not allow it to boil. Serve it in a glass dish, or cups, and put over the top sifted loaf sugar. Lemon Custard. Boil two glasses of white wine, half a pint of water, and two table-spoonfuls of brandy ; when nearly cold,THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 307 add the grated peel and juice of two lemons, with half a pound of pounded loaf sugar, and the well-beaten yolks of six eggs; stir it over a slow fire till it thickens, pour it into a basin, and stir now and then till cold; put it into a dish, or cups, with sifted loaf sugar over the top.

Scald, take oft' the hair, and clean two dozen of calf’s feet, put them on in cold water, allowing the proportion of two quarts to four feet; boil them slowly for eight or nine hours; take out the bones, and strain the liquor through a hair-sieve. The following day remove care- fully every particle of fat, and the sediment at the bottom, then put the jelly into a nicely-cleaned brass pan ; let it boil over a stove, or slow fire, till it becomes very thick, and appears almost black in the pan ; then put a little of it over the bottom of small plates to dry, and when cool turn it; the next day lay it upon tins, or sheets of paper,THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 309 and place them at a little distance from the fire, that it inay dry gradually; when clear and hard put it up in paper bags. Six ounces of this jelly, dissolved in three pints of water, and boiled to a quart, is sufficient to make what will fill two middling-sized moulds. Ox feet may be substituted for calf’s feet; the jelly made from them is equally good, but not so delicate in colour. Jelly. To a quart of the stock jelly put half a pound of loaf sugar pounded, a stick or two of cinnamon broken into small bits, the peel of a lemon, a pint of currant wine, and one of sherry or teneriffe, and the beaten whites of five eggs; put it all into a nicely-cleaned sauce-pan, stir it gently till it boils, and boil it for three or four minutes. Pour it into a jelly-bag, with a basin or mug placed un- derneath ; run it immediately through the bag again into another basin, and repeat this till it begins to drop. It will then be as transparent as possible, and may be put into moulds or glasses. When all lias apparently dripped, pour about a pint of boiling water into the bag, which will produce a little thin jelly fit to drink; the stand with the jelly-bag should be placed near to the fire; sherry alone, or teneriffe, may be used. The jelly may be put into quart bottles corked tightly, which will make it keep good for some weeks; place the bottle in warm water when it is required for use. Fresh Calf’s Feet Stock. Scald, take off the hair, and wash very clean four feet; put them into a sauce-pan with two quarts of cold water, and when it comes to a boil let them simmer for six or seven hours ; take out the feet, and strain the liquor into a deep dish. The following day remove the fat care- fully from the top, and give it another boil, which will reduce it to one quart of stiff stock or jelly. Ale or Porter Jelly. For a large shape, put to the prepared stock or jelly,THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 310 more than half a bottle of strong ale or porter, a pound of loaf sugar, the peel of one, and the juice of four large lemons, a stick of cinnamon, and the beaten whites of eight eggs; put it all into a sauce-pan, stir it gently; let it boil for fifteen minutes, and pour it into a jelly-bag till it runs perfectly clear. Ox Feet Jelly. Put a little hot water over the top of the stock, pour it off, and wipe it dry with a clean cloth ; put a quart of it into a sauce-pan with the beaten whites of five or six eggs, the juice of five lemons made very sweet with good brown sugar, a clove or two, and a little cinnamon pounded; let it boil twenty minutes, stirring it all the time; take it off the fire, and add a pint, or half a pint of white wine, and run it through a jelly-bag till clear. Hartshorn Jelly. Boil ten ounces of hartshorn shavings in four quarts of water till reduced to three pints ; strain it; when cold, add to it a pint of white wine, one pound of loaf sugar, and the peel of two lemons; set it over the fire, stir it till the jelly is melted, and pour in the strained juice of eight lemons, and the beaten whites of twelve eggs ; stir it, and let it boil quickly a few minutes; pour it into a jelly-bag till it runs perfectly clear. Another way to make Hartshorn Jelly. Boil half a pound of hartshorn shavings for three hours and a half in four pints and a half of water; strain it through a bit of muslin, and stir into it three ounces of dissolved isinglass; if large, the peel of one, if small, of two lemons, and their juice, half the peel of an orange, three parts of a tea-cupful of brandy, and one of white wine ; sweeten with pounded loaf spgar, and when luke- warm put it into a sauce-pan with the beaten whites of six eggs; stir it, and let it boil for two minutes; strain it through a jelly-bag two or three times till perfectly clear.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 311 Apple Jelly. Pare, core, and cut thirteen good apples into small bits ; as they are cut, throw them into two quarts of cold water; boil them in this, with the peel of a lemon, till the sub- stance is extracted, and nearly half the liquor wasted; drain them through a hair sieve, and to a pint of the li- quid add one pound of loaf sugar pounded, the juice of one lemon, and the beaten white of one or two eggs ; put it into a sauce-pan, stir it till it boils, take oft’ the scum, and let it boil till clear, and then pour it into a mould. Jaune Mange.

Punch Jelly. Dissolve one ounce of isinglass in five or six tea- cupfuls of water; strain, and add to it, when boiling hot, one tea-cupful and a half of brandy, the same of rum, and one of lemon juice, with half a pound of pounded loaf sugar; stir till the sugar is dissolved, and pour it into a shape. Orange Jelly. Squeeze the juice of eight oranges and six lemons, grate the peel of half the fruit, and steep it in a pint ol cold water; mix it with the juice, three quarters of a pound of loaf sugar, one ounce and a quarter of isinglass, and the beaten whites of seven eggs; put it into a sauce- pan, and stir it till it boils ; let it boil a few minutes, and strain it through a jelly-bag till clear; put it into a mould or glasses. Another way to make Orange Jelly. Dissolve three quarters of an ounce of isinglass in half a pint of water; add it to a quart of cream, and the strained juice of three sweet or bitter oranges, and six ounces of loaf sugar, part of which has been previously rubbed upon the rind of the oranges; stir it in a sauce- pan over the fire till it boils, put it into a basin, stir it till nearly cold, and then pour it into a mould. Another way to make Orange Jelly. Dissolve two ounces of isinglass in boiling water, add it to the strained juice of twelve oranges and one le- mon ; sweeten with pounded loaf sugar; boil and strain it. The oranges may be cut into half, and the pulp ta- ken out, the skins placed in a dish to keep them steady, and filled with the jelly. It will be firm in three or four hours; or it may be served in a mould. Another way to make Orange Jelly. Dissolve one ounce of isinglass in a pint of water;313 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. when nearly cold, mix with it the strained juice of eight or nine oranges; sweeten with pounded loaf sugar, and stir it till it be dissolved; strain it through a lawn sieve, and pour it into a shape. . Strawberry Jelly. Put some fresh-gathered strawberries into an earthen pan, bruise them with a wooden spoon, add a little cold water, and some finely-pounded loaf sugar. In an hour or two, strain it through a jelly-bag, and to a quart of the juice add one ounce of isinglass, which has been dis- solved in half a pint of water, well skimmed, strained, and allowed to cool; mix all well, and pour it into an earthen mould. Raspberry jelly, red currant jelly, and red currants mixed with raspberries, may be made exactly in the same manner; and the bright red colour may be improved by mixing in a little carmine or lake. When this kind of jelly is to be made with cherries, the fruit should be boil- ed a' few minutes in clarified sugar, and when cold, the juice of one or two lemons may be added with the isinglass. A little lemon-juice may be added to any of the other jellies, in proportion to the acidity of the fruit. They may be iced by covering and surrounding the mould with ice, without any salt. Floating Island. Boil, with a pint of milk, a bit of cinnamon, and half the peel of a lemon ; when almost cold, strain it, and mix with it the beaten white of one, and the yolks of three eggs; stir it over the fire till thick, pour it into a dish, and stir it now and then till cold.

Beat one pound of pounded and sifted double-refined sugar with the whites of three eggs till quite light; when nearly so, add the juice of a lemon ; whisk, till very light, five whites of eggs, and mix all together; drop it with a spoon upon white paper in the form of small oval cakes, dust them with a little sifted sugar, and bake them in a very slow oven.^When they become lightly coloured upon the top, which may be in ten or twelve minutes, takeTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 323 them out; carefully take oft' a little of the top, fill them with whipt cream or strawberry jam, and put them toge- ther so as to resemble a whole egg, and serve them in a napkin. Sugar Ruffs. A pound of pounded and sifted loaf sugar beaten well with the whites of three eggs, and flavoured with oil of cinnamon, lemons, or orange-flower water, and baked in the same way as the meringues, served in a napkin, or used to garnish dishes of preserves. Potato Biscuit. Beat separately the yolks and whites of fifteen eggs, and with the yolks beat a pound of pounded and sifted loaf sugar, and the grated peel of a lemon; when very light add the whites, and sift in through a silk sieve half a pound of flour of potatoes; mix all lightly together, half fill paper cases, and strew over them roughly pounded sugar, put a piece of paper upon a board, place the paper cases upon it, and bake them in a moderate oven. To ornament them, put here and there upon the top a little red-currant jelly, and serve them. Tipsy Bread. Pare off the crust, and cut into thin round slices of four or five inches, the crumb of a twopenny or three- penny roll; spread over each bit raspberry or strawberry jam, and place the slices one over the other pretty high in a glass dish, and pour over them as much sherry, sweetened with sugar, as the bread will soak in; stick round the sides, and over the top, blanched sweet almonds, cut like straws, and pour a custard round it. It may be made the day before, or two or three hours before dinner, and with the crumb of loaf bread. Tipsy Cake. Pour over a spunge cake, made in the form of a por- cupine, as much white wine as it will absorb, and stick324 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. it all over with blanched sweet almonds, cut like straws ; or pour wine in the same manner over a thick slice of spunge cake, cover the top of it with preserved straw- berries or raspberries, and stick cut almonds all round it. Lemon Spunge. Boil half an ounce of isinglass in a pint of water till dissolved ; strain it, and the following day add the juice of two lemons, and the grated peel of one ; rub through a hair-sieve into the isinglass a good quantity of rasp- berry jam, that has stood before the fire some time, and whisk it all together till like a spunge; put it into an earthen mould, set it in a cold place for some hours, and turn it out. Any other sort of preserve may be used, and if made with only orange or lemon juice, sweeten it with sugar, or make it with orange jelly which may have been left the day before. Raspberry Spunge. Dissolve in a little water three quarters of an ounce of isinglass, add to it three quarters of a pint of cream, and the same proportion of new milk, nearly half a pint of raspberry jelly, and the juice of a lemon. Whisk it well one way till it becomes thick, and looks like spunge, then put it into an earthenware mould, and turn it out the next day. Cake Sandwiches. Cut a spunge cake, a few days old, as for bread sand- wiches, and spread strawberry jam or currant jelly over them. A Trifle. Add to a pint of rich cream a tea-cupful of white wine sweetened with pounded loaf sugar, whisk it well, and as the froth rises lay it upon a sieve placed over a deep dish ; as it drains, pour the cream into the pan in which it is whisked till all is done; dip some spunge biscuit, ratafia £akes, or Savoy biscuit, into sweet wine and a littleTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 325 brandy ; pour over them a rich boiled custard, and when quite cold, lay on the whipt cream, piled as high as pos- sible. Coloured comfits may be strewed over the top. Another way to make Trifle. Mix three table-spoonfuls of white wine, and one of sugar, with a pint and a half of thick cream ; whisk it, and take off as much froth as will heap upon the dish, into which lay some pieces of spunge cake, or some spunge biscuit, soaked with sweet wine, and covered with pre- served strawberries, or any other fruit; pile the froth upon this, and pour the remainder of the cream into the bottom of the dish ; garnish with flowers. A Large Syllabub. One pound of ratafia cakes pounded and steeped in two bottles of port wine, one of claret, and one of brandy, the grated peel and juice of two lemons, one large nutmeg grated, and two ounces of sweet almonds, blanched and pounded with a little rose water, and pounded sugar suf- ficient to make it sweet—Put all these ingredients, well mixed, into a large china bowl, or bowls of an equal size, and let the milk of a good cow be milked upon them ; add a little rich cream and sifted loaf sugar, and cover it to keep it warm. It may be served out into glasses with a silver ladle. Another way to make Large Syllabub. A large glass of madeira, one of rich sweet wine, and half a one of ratafia, half a pound of pounded loaf sugar, the grated peel of a large lemon, the juice of two, and a little pounded cinnamon ; stir it all together till the sugar be dissolved, and add a quart of rich cream ; whisk it well; lay some macaroons into the bottom of a dish, and pile the frothed syllabub high upon it. It may be kept nine or ten days, and is better the third and fourth than when first made.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 326 Solid Syllabub. A quarter of a pint of mountain, the same of white wine, the grated peel of two, and juice of one lemon ; sweeten, and add it to a quart of rich cream ; whisk it for an hour, and put it into glasses. It will keep a week in cold weather. Whipt Syllabub. Mix together half a glass of brandy, a little lemon juice, and grated peel, with sugar enough to sweeten the whole; stir it into a pint of thick cream, and add the well-beaten whites of six eggs ; whisk it for an hour, and put the froth, as it rises, upon a sieve to drain ; put a little port and sweet wine into glasses, and fill them up with the froth. Common Syllabub. Half a pint of currant, the same of port or white wine, half a grated nutmeg, and the peel of a lemon ; sweeten well with pounded loaf or good brown sugar, and mix it together in a china bowl, and when the sugar dissolves, milk upon it three or four pints of milk. Serve it when cold. To Preserve Lemons for Eight or Ten Months. The lemons must be perfectly fresh and sound, and free from every blemish. Put into a box a layer of earth, previously sifted, “and made sufficiently damp for corn to spring in ; strew over it a little barley, and place the lemons on it so as not to touch each other, and again put a layer of earth and barley; do this till all the lemons are packed, and taking care they be entirely covered with the earth. The box must be kept in a cellar, or some damp place, to prevent the earth becoming too dry. To Preserve Lemon Juice. Squeeze, and strain a pint of lemon juice; put intoTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. S27 a china basin one pound of double-refined sugar finely- pounded and sifted, add the lemon juice, and stir it with a silver spoon till the sugar be perfectly dissolved. Bottle it, and cork it tightly; seal the cork, or tie bladder over it, and keep it in a dry cool place. To Purify Lemon Juice. To one quart of strained lemon juice add one ounce of well-burned and finely-pounded charcoal; in twelve hours filter it through filtering paper, and put it into small phials, which cork tightly, and keep in a cool place; a thick crust will form beneath the cork, and the mucilage will fall to the bottom. Hang up the peels, and when dried keep them in a paper bag. Colouring for Jellies, Creams, Ices, and Cakes. Boil very slowly in a gill of water, till reduced to one half, twenty grains of cochineal, the same quantity of alum and of cream of tartar finely pounded ; strain, and keep it in a small phial. For yellow, use an infusion of saffron. For green, wash well, and pull into small bits, a hand- ful of spinach leaves; put them into a closely-covered sauce-pan ; let them boil for a few minutes, and then ex- press the juice.328 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. CHAPTER XV. CAKES, BISCUITS, AND BREAD. PREPARATORY REMARKS. The currants and raisins should be prepared as directed under the article headed, Remarks on Puddings, Pies, and Tarts (page 218); and the flour dried before the fire on a large sheet of white paper, then sifted and weighed. Al- monds should be blanched by pouring hot water over them, and, after standing some minutes, taking off the skin, then throwing them into rose or cold water. When not pounded, they should be cut lengthwise into thin bits. Sugar should be roughly pounded, rolled with a bottle upon white paper, and then sifted. All spices, after being well dried at the fire, should be finely pounded and sifted. Lemon and orange peel must be pared very thin, and pounded with a little sugar. The butter, after being weighed, should be laid into cold water, or washed in rose water, and if salt, be well washed in several waters. The yolks and whites of eggs should be separately and long beaten, then strained; two whisks should be kept exclusively for that purpose, as the whites especially re- quire to be managed with the greatest care. A horn321) THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. spoon should be used for mixing those cakes which are not directed to be beaten with the hand. To make cakes light, salvolatile, or smelling salts, may- be added immediately before putting them into the oven, allowing, to a spuuge cake, made of one pound of flour, one tea-spoonful; and two or three to a large plum-cake.

It will require about one hour and a half to bake in a quick oven. It may be made without the almonds or the es- sence of lemon. Bairn Brack. To three pounds of dried flour allow one pound of fresh butter, one pound of good brown sugar, two ounces of caraway seeds, eight well-beaten eggs, three table- spoonfuls of fresh yeast, and some grated nutmeg; dis- solve the butter in a pint of milk, so as to make the whole into a dough, not very stiff; work it well; cover it with a cloth, and set it before the fire to rise ; when well risen, bake it in a buttered tin. When it becomes dry, it may be toasted and eaten with butter. Short Bread. For two pounds of sifted flour allow one pound of butter, salt or fresh; a quarter of a pound of candied orange and lemon peel, of pounded loaf sugar, blanched sweet almonds, and caraway comfits, a quarter of a pound each ; cut the lemon, the orange-peel, and almonds into small thin bits, and mix them with a pound and a half of the flour, a few of the caraway comfits, and the sugar; melt the butter, and when cool, pour it clear from the sediment into the flour, at the same time mixing it quick- ly. With the hands, form it into a large round of near- ly an inch thick, using the remainder of the flour to make it up with ; cut it into four, ami with the finger and thumb pinch each bit neatly all round the edge ; prick them with a fork, and strew the rest of the caraway comfits over the top. Put the pieces upon white paper dusted with flour, and then upon tins. Bake them in a moderate oven. Plain Short Bread.

Another way to make Gingerbread Nuts. Dissolve a quarter of a pound of butter in three quar- ters of a pound of treacle, put it into a pan large enough to contain the rest of the ingredients, and when almost cold, stir in one pound of dried and sifted flour, half a pound of coarse brown sugar, half an ounce of caraway seeds, three quarters of an ounce of pounded ginger, and the grated peel of a lemon; mix all these well together, and let it stand till it be stiff, or till the following day, then make it into nuts, by pinching it into pieces with the finger and thumb. Bake them upon buttered tins in a quick oven. Half an ounce of coriander seeds may be adtled. Another way to make Gingerbread Nuts. Rub half a pound of butter into two pounds of flour; add one pound of coarse sugar, and one ounce of pound- ed ginger; mix all well together with one pound and two ounces of treacle; form it into nuts, or roll it out, and cut it into round cakes ; bake them upon tins. American Gingerbread. Take half a pound of fresh butter melted, one pound and a half of dried and sifted flour, the same quantity of brown sugar, a quarter of a pound of pounded ginger, nine eggs, the yolks and whites separately beaten, one glass of rose water, and one of white wine ; mix all these well together, and beat it for an hour; then with a spoon spread it over flat tin pans, about the thickness of a pen- ny-piece ; bake it of a light brown, and while warm, cut it into oblong pieces, and place them on end till cool, when they will be very crisp.

Melt the butter with the treacle, and when nearly cold, stir in the eggs and the rest of the ingredients; mix all well together, make it into round cakes, and bake them upon tins. Indian Gingerbread. Take twelve ounces of pounded loaf sugar, a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, one pound of dried flour, two ounces of pounded ginger, and of cloves and cinnamon a quarter of an ounce each. Mix the ginger and spice with the flour; put the sugar and a small tea-cupful of water in- to a sauce-pan ; when it is dissolved, add the butter, and as soon as it is melted, mix it with the flour and other things ; work it up, and form the paste into cakes or nuts, and bake them upon tins. Breakfast, or Tea Cakes. Take one pound of flour, and mix it with half a pound of butter dissolved, together with a little cream, milk, or water, and half a tea-spoonful of salt; work it well, and roll it into round balls. Have wafer-irons ready heated, put into them a ball of the paste, press them, and hold the irons upon the fire for a minute or two. Slim Cakes for Breakfast or Tea. To one pound of flour, allow two beaten eggs, one ounce of butter, half a tea-spoonful of salt, and as much warmed milk as will make the whole into a pretty stiff paste; work it well, cover it over, and let it remain be- fore the fire for half an hour; roll it out, and cut it into round cakes, with a small saucer or the top of a tumbler; do them in a nicely-cleaned frying-pan ; dust them with a little flour. They may be baked upon a plate of iron, or what is called in Scotland a girdle.349 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Another way to make Cakes for Breakfast or Tea. To one pound of flour allow two beaten eggs, one ta- ble-spoonful of fresh yeast, and as much cream as will make them into a light dough ; cover it over for an hour, make it into cakes, and bake them upon tins in a mode- rate oven. Another way to make Cakes for Breakfast or Tea. Dissolve, in half a pint of warm water, one ounce of fresh butter, mix it with two pounds of dried and sifted flour, and stir in lightly two large spoonfuls of fine fresh yeast; cover it with a cloth, and let it stand to rise; then make it up into rolls, place them upon floured tins, let them again stand to rise, and bake them in a quick oven. Short Cakes. Dissolve half a pound of fresh butter in as much milk as will make a pound and a half of flour into a paste, roll it out about a quarter of an inch thick, and cut it in- to large round cakes. Do them in a frying-pan, and serve them hot. They are eaten with butter. Parkin, or Leeds Gingerbread. Sift four pounds of oatmeal, and mix with it four pounds of treacle, half a pound of brown sugar, the same quantity of melted butter, and three quarters of an ounce of powdered ginger. Work it all well together, let it re- main for twenty-four hours, and then make it into cakes. Parliament Cakes. Put into a s'mce-pan two pounds of treacle, and when it boils, add a quarter of a pound of butter, and pour it upon two pounds of flour; add a little alum, and a bit of pearl ash about the size of a nut, and an ounce of ginger. Work it well with the hand till quite smooth; let it.stand 1THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 350 a day and a night, then roll it out very thin, and cut it into oblong cakes. Oatmeal Cakes. One only should be made at a time, as the mixture dries quickly. Put two or three handfuls of meal into a bowl, and moisten it with water merely sufficient to form it into a cake; knead it out round and round with the hands upon the paste-board, strewing meal under and over it; it may be made as thin as a wafer, or thicker, according to taste, and put it on a hot iron plate, called a girdle. Bake it till it be a little brown on the under side, then take it off, and toast that side before the fire which was uppermost on the girdle. The toaster is such as is commonly used for heating smoothing irons, having a back to support the cake. To make these cakes soft, they must not be toasted before the fire, but both sides done quickly on the girdle. Girdle Cakes. Rub three ounces of fresh butter into one pound of flour, with half a tea-spoonful of salt; moisten with a suf- ciency of sweet butter-milk to make it into a paste ; roll it out, and cut it into cakes with a cup or tumbler, and bake them upon a girdle. Bath Buns. To four pounds of dried and sifted flour allow onepound of fresh butter, three quarters of a pound of caraway com- fits, the well-beaten yolks of four, and the whites of two eggs, six table-spoonfuls of cream, and the same quanti- ty of fresh yeast. Melt the butter, mix it with the flour, and add the eggs, cream, and yeast, previously beaten together ; cover it, and let it rise for twenty or thirty mi- nutes, then shake in the caraway comfits, keeping a few to strew over the tops; form the buns, and bake them upon buttered tins.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 351 Biscuit. Make a9 stiff a paste as possible of the finest flour, mixing it with cold water, and adding a little salt; beat it out with a rolling-pin, cut it into pieces, lay them one over the other, and again beat it out; roll it very thin, cut it into biscuits, and prick them well with a fork. To make the Prince of Wales’ biscuit, roll the paste into small balls, and press it with a stamp. Another way to make Biscuit. Rub seven ounces of fresh butter into two pounds of flour, mix with it two large spoonfuls of yeast, cover it with a cloth, and let it stand an hour; then add as much warmed new milk as will make it into a paste as stiff as pie-crust; form it into biscuits of about an ounce and a half each ; bake them in a quick oven. The following day, after bread has been baked, put them again into the oven, and let them remain for nearly three hom-s. Sweet Biscuit. One pound of flour, half a pound of butter, the same quantity of finely-pounded sugar, and two eggs, without being beaten; make it all into a very stiff paste with cold water, roll it out, and to form the biscuits, roll a bit of the paste into a ball about the size of the yolk of an egg, flatten it a little, and place them upon tins to bake. Another way to make Sweet Biscuit. To one pound of flour allow half a pound of sugar, two beaten eggs, a tea-spoonful of caraway seeds, and a quar- ter of a pound of melted butter; mix all well together, roll it out thin, and cut it into round biscuits ; prick them, and bake them upon tins. Oliver’s Biscuit. Melt a quarter of a pound of fresh butter in half a pint of new milk; add a table-spoonful of fresh yeast, and stir it into one pound and a half of flour; knead it well,352 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. then wrap it in warm flannel, to remain for fifteen mi- nutes; roll it out several times, and the last time about the thickness of a penny-piece ; cut it into small biscuits, prick them well with a fork, and bake them in a slow oven till of a pale brown colour. Biscuits. Dissolve half a pound of butter in half a pint of milk, and make it into a stiff paste with four pounds of flour; beat and work it perfectly smooth, roll it out very thin, stamp out the biscuit, prick them well with a fork, and bake them upon tins in a quick oven. Leman’s Biscuit. Sift and dry a pound of fine flour ; rub into it a quar- ter of a pound of butter, two ounces of pounded and sift- ed loaf sugar, and a bit of volatile salt about the size of a nut; mix in as much new milk warmed as will make it into a stiff paste; work it well together, and let it re- main for two or three hours, and then roll it out, and make it into small square biscuits, and into round balls a little flattened; prick them with a fork, and bake them upon tins in a quick oven. Take care they do not become brown. Cold Harbour Balls. 4 Dissolve one ounce of butter in as much milk warm- ed as will make four pounds of flour into a stiff paste; about two-pints may be required; add half a tea-spoon- ful of salt, one egg beaten together with a table-spoonful of yeast; mix it all well, cover it with a cloth, and let it remain before the fire for half an hour; then make it into small round balls, and bake them upon tins in a quick oven. Rusks. To three pounds and a half of flour allow half a pound of butter, the same quantity of pounded loaf sugar, and five spoonfuls of yeast; mix the flour and sugar toire-THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 353 ther ; melt the butter in two pints and a half of milk, and mix it with the flour, and then add the yeast and one beat- an egg; work it well together; cover it, and let it stand for live or six hours; take it out of the pan, and form it into little rolls; place them upon tins, and let them rise for about an hour; bake them in a quick oven, and when they become brown, cut them through the middle or into three slices; put them again into the oven to brown and crisp. Muffins. Make two quarts of milk rather warmer than when it comes from the cow; then, with a horn or wooden spoon, mix with it about a tea-cupful of good fresh yeast; stir flour into it till it be as thick as a batter ; cover it, and let it re- main to rise for an hour, then take it out by spoonfuls and drop it amongst flour, and let it remain fifteen minutes ; take them up, flatten them a little, and bake them upon a metal plate ; when one side is a little brown, turn them. When to be eaten, toast them, and with a knife cut them a little all round, then pull them open and butter them. Sally Lun’s, or Bath Breakfast Cakes. Rub into two pounds of flour half a pound of butter, and mix with it one pint of milk a little warmed, a quar- ter of a pint of fresh yeast, four well-beaten eggs, and a tea-spoonful of salt; cover it, and let it stand before the fire to rise for three quarters of an hour ; make it into thick cakes about the size of the inside of a dinner plate ; bake them in a quick oven, then cut them into three, that the middle slice, as also the top and bottom, may be well buttered. Serve them very hot. To make Bread. . To thirteen pounds of sifted flour allow four quarts of lukewarm milk or water, in winter it must be warmer, but not scalding hot even in the coldest weather ; put the milk into a wooden trough or large earthen pan ; add a large table-spoonful of coarse salt; stir in a few handfuls z351 THE PRACTICE OE COOKERY. of flour, and three quarters of a pint of beer yeast, or more if not very thick; then stir in flour till it be like a thick batter; throw some flour on the top, and set it be- fore the fire. If the yeast be good, the mixture will rise in ten minutes to the top of the pan; then stir in some more flour, and replace it before the fire. When it has risen a second time, take out as much dough as will make the rolls, knead it about five minutes, form the rolls, prick them with a fork, and put them on a tin, place them before the fire to rise for ten minutes, and bake them in a pretty quick oven. The dough for the loaves must be kneaded for twenty minutes or half an hour; form the loaves, and put them into tin pans, which may be rather more than half filled ; prick them, and place them before the fire; when they have risen nearly to the top of the pans, they may be put into the oven and baked one hour. If a metal oven is used, it must be made moderately hot, that the bread maybe well raised without being scorched. Another way to make Bread. Mix into six pounds of sifted flour one ounce of salt, nearly half a pint of fresh sweet yeast as it comes from the brewery, and a sufficient quantity of warmed milk to make the whole into a stiff dough; work and knead it well upon a pasteboard, on which a little flour has been strew- ed, for fifteen or twenty minutes, then put it into a deep pan, cover it with a warmed towel, set it before the fire, and let it rise for an hour and a half, or perhaps two hours ; cut off a piece of this spunge or dough ; knead it well for eight or ten minutes, together with flour merely sufficient to keep it from adhering to the board ; put it into small tins, filling them three parts full; dent the rolls all round with a knife, and let them stand a few minutes before put- ting them into the oven. The remainder of the dough must then be worked up for loaves, and baked either in or out of a shape. Brown Bread. Either of the above receipts maybe followed, allow-THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 355 ing a little more yea9t, less liquid, and kneading the dough for a longer time. It may be made of oatmeal, or of a mixture of wheat, barley, and rye flour, the proportion of wheat flour being doubled; but the liuest brown bread is made of wheat ground over head. Stale Bread May be made nearly as good as when newly baked, by putting it into a cool oven for nearly an hour. Bolls. Dissolve two ounces of butter in one pint of new milk, and stir it into four pounds of flour, as also three table-spoonfuls of yeast, a tea-spoonful of salt, and the well-beaten whites of two egg9; cover the pan with a warmed towel, and set it before the fire to rise for half an hour, then work it one way for fifteen minutes ; form it into rolls, place them upon tins, and let them rise for ten minutes before putting them into the oven. French Rolls. Mix rather more than an ounce of coarse salt with eight pounds of sifted flour; make a hole in the middle, and pour in about half a pint of good yeast, the well- beaten whites of four eggs, and as much new milk warm- ed as will mix it to a middling stiffness ; clap and work it down one way with the hands for half an hour, but do not knead it; cover it with a warmed towel, and let it rise before the fire for half an hour ; take off the surface, which soon becomes hard, and put it aside to be made into a roll; work and clap the dough, form it into rolls, place them upon tins, and let them rise for ten minutes ; bake them in a quick oven. Yeast. Beer yeast, which is the best for bread, should be strained through a hair sieve, and two or three quarts of cold spring water poured over it; when it has Btood for twenty-four hours the water should be poured off, theTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 356 yeast will then be found at the bottom of the vessel, quite thick. To preserve that which may be left over the baking, it should be put into a bottle, corked tightly, and kept in a cool place. In cold weather it will continue good for a fortnight, but fresh yeast is always preferable. When it does not appear sufficiently strong, honey or brown sugar may be mixed with it, in the proportion of a tea-spoonful to half a pint. Bran Yeast. Boil for ten minutes, in two quarts of water, one pint of bran, and a small handful of good hops; strain it through a sieve, and when milk warm, add three or four table- spoonfuls of beer yeast, and two of brown sugar or trea- cle ; put it into a wooden stoup or jug ; cover it, and place it before the fire to ferment. It may be bottled, tightly corked, and kept in a cool place. Potato Yeast. Boil some good mealy potatoes; peel and weigh them; while hot, bruise them finely, and mix them quickly with boiling water, allowing one quart to each pound ; rub it through a hair sieve, then add honey or brown sugar in the proportion of one ounce to each quart of water; boil it to the consistency of batter, and when nearly cold, add a large table-spoonful of good yeast to every quart of wa- ter ; cover it w ith a cloth to rise, and the following day it will be ready for use; keep a bottle of it, which may be used instead of beer yeast for the next making, first pouring off the thin liquid that is on the top. It must be made with fresh beer yeast every two or three months. Double the quantity of this, as of beer yeast, is required to make bread light. A Baker’s Yeast. Boil two ounces of hops in four quarts of water one hour, adding more water as it decreases, carefully stir- ring it all the time, and taking care that it do not boil over ; strain the liquor, and mix well with it two poundsTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 357 of malt; cover it, and let it stand for eight hours, or until it be milk-warm, then stir in half a pint of good yeast; when mixed well together, let it work for ten hours, and then strain it through a hair sieve.358 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. CHAPTER XVI. PRESERVES. PREPARATORY REMARKS ON SWEETMEATS. All sweetmeats should be preserved in a brass pan, which must be well scoured with sand and vinegar, wash- ed with hot water, and wiped perfectly dry before it is used. . An iron plate or a stove is preferable to a fire for pre- serving on ; and by boiling the fruit quickly, the form, co- lour, and flavour, will be better preserved, and there will be less waste than in slow boiling. A round wooden stick, smaller at the one end than the other, in Scotland called a thevil, is better adapted for stirring sugar or pre- serves with than a silver spoon, which last is only used for skimming. That there may be no waste in taking off the scum, it is put through a fine silk sieve, or through a hair sieve, with a bit of muslin laid into it; the clear part will run into the vessel placed below, and may be return- ed to the preserving pan. A silver soup ladle is used for putting preserves into the jars, which should be of brown stone, or of white wedgewood ware. After the jellies or preserves are put in, they must not be moved till quite cold, when they are359 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. covered with a piece of white paper, cut so as to fit into the jar, and dipped into brandy or rum. They are then stored in a cool dry place, and should be looked at occa- sionally. If in a few weeks they be observed to ferment, the sirup should be first strained from the fruit, then boiled till it is thick, and again poured over the fruit, pre- viously put into clean jars. Sugar, low in price, and consequently coarse in quality, is far from being cheapest in the end ; while that which is most refined is always the best. White sugars should be chosen as shining and as close in texture as possible. The best sort of brown sugar has a bright and gra- velly appe ranee. A jelly bag is made of half a square of flannel folded by the corners, and one side sewed up ; the top. bound with tape, and four loops also of tape sewed on, so as to hang upon a stand made of four bars of wood, each thirty- six inches in height, fastened with f%ur bars at the top, each measuring ten inches, with hooks upon the corners Twelve inches from the bottom four more bars are placed. A pan or basin is put underneath to receive the juice or jelly as it drops through the bag. To Clarify Sugar. To every three pounds of loaf sugar, allow the beaten white of one egg, and a pint and a half of water ; break the sugar small, put it into a nicely-cleaned brass pan, and pour the water over it; let it stand some time before it be put upon the fire ; then add the beaten whites of the eggs ; stir it till the sugar be entirely dissolved, and when it boils up, pour in a quarter of a pint of cold water; let it boil up a 6ccond time ; take it oil' the lire and let it set-THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 360 tie for fifteen minutes; carefully take off all the scum ; put it on the fire, and boil it till sufficiently thick, or if required, till candy high, in order to ascertain which, drop a little from a spoon into a small jar of cold water, and if it become quite hard, it is then sufficiently done; or dip the thevil into the sugar, plunge it into cold water, draw off the sugar which adheres to the stick, and if it be hard and snaps, the fruit to be preserved must be instantly put in and boiled. To Boil Sugar. To every pound of sugar allow half a pint of water ; stir it over the fire till the sugar be entirely dissolved ; when it first boils up, pour in a little cold water, and when it boils a second time, take it off the fire ; let it settle ten minutes, carefully scum it, and boil it for half an hour or a little longer, and then put in the fruit. Orange Marmalade. Allow equal weight of bitter oranges and fine loaf su- gar ; wash the oranges, wipe them dry, and grate off any discoloured part; cut the rind in half, and with a dessert- spoon loosen it all round to take off each of the halves en- tire ; take the core and seeds clean from the oranges, lea- ving the juice with the pulp ; put the skins into a sauce- pan with plenty of cold water, and cover it closely with a cloth underneath the cover; let them boil for some hours, till so tender that the head of a pin will easily pierce them; drain off the water, and while they are hot, with a silver spoon scoop out all the soft part, leaving the skins quite thin ; cut them into thin parings half an inch long ; cla- rify and boil the sugar candy high ; put in the parings, and in ten minutes add the juice and pulp, and boil all together till transparent. Part of the peel may be grated to heighten the colour, and a pound and a half of sugar to the pound of oranges may be used. Another way to make Orange Marmalade. t o three pounds of fruit allow five of sugar ; pare the361 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. oranges ; cut the peel into thin chips, and put them into cold water; clear the pulp from the seeds and inside skin, and strew over it pounded loaf sugar; next day drain the chips, put them into a linen bag, and boil them for three hours in plenty of cold water; they are again drained and boiled, together with the pulp, for ten minutes, or till it jelly in the sugar, which has been clarified and boiled candy high. In making minced marmalade, the skins must be boiled, and then finely minced with a knife. The juice of a pound of lemons is sometimes added, but in other respects the process is the same.

Wash the oranges, and grate oft’ any defective part; to three pounds of fruit allow five of fine loaf sugar ; put the orauges into a sauce-pan with plenty of cold water; cover- it closely, and let them boil till a straw or the head of a pin will easily pierce them ; take them out, cut them into four, pick out the seeds, and slice them, skin and all, as thin as possible ; break the sugar small, and to each pound allow a quarter of a pint of water; stir it till the sugar be dissolved, and when it has boiled a few minutes, take it off the fire ; pour in a quarter of a pint of cold water, which will throw up all the refuse; scum it off; * put it again on the fire, and if any more scum rises, re- move it; add the sliced oranges, and boil for fifteen mi- nutes. Lemon Marmalade. Allow to a pound of lemons eighteen ounces of fine loaf sugar ; grate the rind of a few ; cut them into half; squeeze and strain the juice; boil the skins in the same way a9 those of the orange skins are done ; scoop out the pulp and white part; cut half into thin chips or parings, and pound the other half in a mortar; pound the sugar, and pour over it the juice ; stir, and let it boil for five minutes.; take it off the fire ; skim it; put in the parings and the pounded skins; boil it for five minutes, then add the gra-THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 362 ted peel, and let it Toil for five minutes more; take it off; and stir it till half cold, before putting it into jars. Red Currant Jelly. Gather the currants upon a dry day, pick them clean, pound them in a mortar, and drip them through a tammy or flannel bag ; to every pint of juice allow a pound of fine loaf sugar; it may be broken small and boiled with the juice ; but to make the jelly beautifully clear, clarify and • boil the sugar candy high, add the juice, and boil it six minutes. A pint of white currants to every quart of red improves the colour. Another way to make Red Currant Jelly. Clarify and boil, till candy high, fourteen pounds of sugar ; add three pounds of nicely-picked raspberries, boil them quickly for three minutes, and then put in twelve pounds of clean-picked currants, and boil them for three or four minutes, and strain it through a fine sieve. The currants may be made into a rolled pudding. Another way to make Red Currant Jelly. Gather the currants with the stalks, put them into a tub of cold water; take them out gently, put them in- to a sieve, and then lay them out for half an hour upon a table-cloth. Put them into a prq^erving pan, adding one pint of raspberries to four of entrants ; allow them to become quite hot, but not to boil; shake the pan, to prevent the fruit adhering to the bottom or sides ; strain it through a jelly bag. To every pint of juice allow one pound of pounded loaf sugar, and when it comes to a boil, boil it one minute. Only remove the scum when the pan is taken off the fire. Wash and prepare black currants as the red are direct- ed to be done ; put them into a preserving pan, adding a pint of water to a quart of fruit; let it be so hot as merely to admit of its being squeezed through a thin linen cloth with the hand. To a pint of juice allow aTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 3(>3 pound of loaf sugar, and when it boils, boil it three mi- nutes. Skim it when taken off the fire. Magnum Bonum Plums. Gather the plums tvith stalks, scald them in boiling water, and take oft' the skins, leaving on the stalks. If not quite ripe, they will require to be simmered a few minutes over a stove; to every pound of fruit, allow one of fine loaf sugar; clarify it, and when nearly boiled candy high, put in the plums, and boil them fifteen minutes; with a spoon carefully put them into a basin, and let them stand a day or two; then boil them ten minutes, or till perfectly transparent; put them into the jars; strain the sirup through a sieve, and pour it equally over them. White Currant Jelly. Gather the fruit upon a dry day, and pick it from the stalks; pound it in a mortar, and drip the juice through a flannel bag. To every pint allow a pound of fine loaf sugar; break it small, and with the juice, put it into a preserving pan; stir it till it boils ; skim, and let it boil exactly six minutes ; or the juice may be boiled the same length of time in sugar previously clarified and boiled candy high. To Preserve Yellow White Gooseberries, called The Sulphur. Gather them upon a dry day, and before they are very ripe ; take equal weight of finely-pounded sugar and gooseberries; top and tail, and prick them with a large needle ; as they are done, strew over them a little sugar. To each pound of gooseberries, allow half a pint of white currant juice, and half a pound of pounded sugar. Put the sugar, gooseberries, and juice alternately into the pre- serving pan, set it over the fire, and shake it every now and then, till the sugar be dissolved, and then carefully remove the fruit from the sides of the pan. \Y hen it boils, skim it, and let it boil exactly twenty-four minutes. The large rough red gooseberries are preserved precise-THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 364 ly in the same way, and when they come to a boil, must be allowed to boil for twenty minutes. Another way to Preserve Gooseberries. The tops and tails being removed from the goose- berries, allow an equal quantity of finely-pounded loaf sugar, and put a layer of each alternately into a large deep jar; pour into it as much dripped currant juice, either red or white, as will dissolve the sugar, adding its weight in sugar; the following day, put all into a preser- ving pan, and boil it. To Preserve Yellow or Green Gooseberries. The tops and tails being removed from the goose- berries, slit them up the sides, and with a silver knife, or the top of a tea-spoon, take out the seeds, and put them, with the pulp which adheres to them, into a sieve; the juice which drains from them boil with the sugar, previ- ously weighed in equal quantities with tlie fruit; then add the gooselferry skins, and boil them till perfectly clear. Gooseberry Jam for Puddings. Allow equal weight of the red rough gooseberries, and of good brown sugar; gather the fruit upon a dry day ; top and tail them, and put a layer alternately of gooseberries and of sugar into a preserving pan ; shake it frequently, skim it well, and boil it till the sirup jellies, which may be ascertained by cooling a little in a saucer. Black and red cun-ants may be done in this way for common use. Black Currant Jelly. Gather the fruit upon a dry day, pick it clean from the stalks; put into a preserving pan eight pounds, and one pint of water; bruise the currants till they get a scald ; pour them into a hair sieve, and with the hands press out all the juice, which strain through a piece of mus- lin; and to each pint, allow one pound of fine loaf sugar ; break it small, and with the juice put. it into a preset--THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 365 ving pan; stir it till it boils, let it boil for three minutes, and skim it. Raspberries Preserved Whole. Gather the raspberries upon a dry day, and when the sun is not upon them ; weigh equal quantities of fine- ly-pounded loaf sugar and of ^’ruit; put a layer of each alternately into a preserving pan, shake it constantly till # it boils, carefully take off the scum, and boil it for fifteen minutes; or the sugar may be clarified, boiled candy high, and the fruit added. White Raspberries Preserved Whole. Gather the raspberries upon a dfy day, and to each pound allow one of sugar ; clarify and boil till candy high all but one pound, which pound and sift; put the rasp- berries into the clarified sugar, and boil it for five minutes; take it off, and strew over, the pound of sifted sugar; when almost cold, to every pound of fruit, add half a pint of dripped white currant juice, and half a pound of finely- pounded sugar; boil and skim it till the fruit be trans- parent. To Preserve Raspberries. Gather the fruit upon a dry day; to each pound of I raspberries, allow half a pint of red currant juice, and a pound and a half of finely-pounded loaf sugar ; put each I alternately into a preserving pan, shake it frequently till the sugar be dissolved ; carefully remove the fruit from the sides of the pan, and stir it round gently with a thevil I or a silver spoon; when it boils, skim it, and let it boil I twenty-five minutes ; or the sugar may be clarified, boiled fl candy high, and the fruit and currant juice added to it. Raspberry Jam.

Raspberry Jelly. Put into a jar raspberries and white currants in equal quantities; let them be thoroughly heated on the fire in a water bath, then run them through a jelly bag, anAito every pint of juice add a pound of.pfiunded sugar; let it just boil, take it off the fire, and skim it; repeat this two or three times till it is quite clear, when it will be sufficiently done. To Preserve Black Currants. Gather the currants upon a dry day ; to every pound allow half a pint of red currant juice, and a pound and a half of finely-pounded loaf sugar. With scissors clip off the heads arid stalks; put the juice, sugar, and currants into a preserving pan ; shake it' frequently till it boil6 ; carefully remove the fruit from the sides of the pan, and take off the scum as it rises; let it boil for ten or fifteen minutes. This preserve may be eaten with cream, or made into tarts. Black Currant Jam. Allow equal weight of dipt cun-ants and of pounded loaf sugar; bruise and mash the fruit in a preserving pair over the fire; add the sugar ; stir it frequently ; when it boils, skim, and let it boil for ten minutes. White or Red Currant Jam. Pick the fruit very nicely, and allow an equal quanti- ty of finely-pounded loaf sugar; put a layer of each al- ternately into a preserving pan, and boil for ten minutes ; or they may be boiled the same length of time, in sugar previously clarified and boiled candy high. To Preserve Strawberries. Weigh a large deep dish or milk pan, into which putTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 3GT the finest rose strawberries, gathered when perfectly dry ; then weigh them, and to each pound allow one of fine loaf sugar, which clarify and boil candy high ; pour it over the strawberries; wash out the preserving pan ; re- turn the fruit and sugar into it, and boil the strawberries for five minutes ; strain them through a large sieve, and boil the sirup for twenty minutes; then with a silver spoon carefully add the strawberries to it; and, if approved, half a pint of dripped red currant juice, and half a pound of sugar, to each pound of strawberries, and boil all together for ten minutes; carefully scum it. The large Bath, or Hautboy Strawberries May be preserved with an equal quantity of fine loaf sugar, which must be scummed and boiled for half an hour ; then, the fruit being added, it is boiled for half an hour or three quarters, and carefully scummed. Or the sugar maybe finely pounded and boiled with the fruit. Another way to Preserve Strawberries. * Gather the strawberries in the middle of a dry day, taking care that they are quite ripe, sound, and.good ; the best kinds are the rose, and large scarlet pine ; iu gather- ing, pick them carefully from the stalks. Pound fine loaf sugar, and allow equal weight of each ; lay the strawber- ries into one or two large dishes, and cover them complete- ly over with the sugar. On the following day, put theip into a preserving-pan, and place them over the fire till they are heated through ; do the same the next day, and on the third boil them up very fast, allowing them fifteen minutes after they come to boil all over; take them off I the fire, and have ready some aired silver paper to put upon them, to take oft’ the scum, instead of using a silver • « I spoon, which is apt to break them. This preserve may be eaten with cream. The process of boiling may be completed in one day, if begun at an early hour. * i rife* i -THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 368 Strawberry Jam. Allow equal weight of pounded loaf sugar and of the scarlet pine or rose strawberries; mash them in the pre- serving-pan, and mix the sugar well with it; stir, scum, and boil it for twenty minutes. Pounded Strawberries, for Strawberry Cream. Take equal weight of sugar and of strawberries ; pound and sift the sugar, add it to the strawberries, and pound them in a marble mortar till perfectly smooth. Put it into jars, and tie them over closely with paper. It will keep good for several months. Imitation West Indian Ginger. PeeL off the outer coat of the tender stems of lettuce that is shot, cut it into bits one or two inches long, and throw it into cold water; to each pound put in a tea-spoonful of cayenne, and a little salt; let it stand one or two days ; allow an equal proportion of fine loaf sugar, which clari- fy. Soak some good ginger in hot water, slice it, and add it to the sugar, allowing one ounce and a half to the pound, and boil it for fifteen minutes ; strain off the water from the lettuce, and pour over it the sirup, keeping back the ginger, with which the sirup must be boiled three times, and poured over the lettuce, two or three days in- tervening between each boiling; and at the last add the 6trained juice of one or two lemons. Ripe Melon, to resemble West Indian Pare off the rind, scoop out the seeds, and cut it into small bits; put them into salt and water for ten days; then put them into fresh water for four or five days, chan- ging the water daily, morning and evening; scrape off the outside of some best white ginger, and put it into a thin sirup, which pour boiling hot upon the cut melon ; repeat this for five or six days. Boil up the sirup pretty thick, andTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 3G9 boil tlie melon in it for ten minutes. To every pint of sirup put the rind of a lemon, pared very thin, and cut into straws. This sweetmeat ought to be hept for a year before it is eaten. A melon of six pounds weight will require four pounds of refined sugar, and half a pound of ginger. To Preserve Red Pears. Parboil a dozen of pound pears in water; peel them. Clarify the same weight of fine loaf sugar that there is of pears ; add a pint of port wine, the juice and rind of one lemon, with a little cochineal, a few cloves, and a stick of cinnamon ; boil the pears in this till they become clear and red ; take them out, boil up the sirup, strain, and put it over the pears. To Preserve Large Smooth Green Gooseberries. Weigh equal proportions of sugar and of fruit; with n pen-knife, slit the gooseberries on one side, and lake out all the seeds; put them into a preserving-pan with cold water, scald them ; pour oft’ the water when cold ; put over and under them vine leaves, with more cold wa- ter; set them over the fire to green. Clarify the sugar; put the gooseberries into a deep jar, and pour the boiling sirup over them; in two days pour it oft’, boil, and put it over the fruit; repeat this till the sirup becomes thick, then put them into small jars. To Preserve the same, before they are Ripe. Gather the largest-sized gooseberries, and allow an equal quantity of pounded loaf sugar; cut the gooseber- ries in half, and take out the seeds ; wet the sugar with a little water, and put all together into a preserving-pan; carefully stir and scum them, and boil them till the sirup is clear and the fruit soft. 2 Aim THE PRACTICE OF COOKERV. Preserved Apples. Weigh equal quantities of good brown sugar and of apples; peel, core, and mince them small. Boil the su- gar, allowing to every three pounds a pint of water; skim it well, and boil it pretty thick; then add the ap- ples, the grated peel of one or two lemons, and two or three pieces of white ginger; boil till the apples fall, and look dear and yellow. This preserve will keep for years. Preserved Cherries. To a pound of cherries allow three quarters of a pound of pounded loaf sugar; carefully stone them, and as they are done, 6trew part of the sugar over them ; boil them fast, with the remainder of the sugar, till the fruit is clear and the sirup thick; take off the scum as it rises. Or they may be boiled ten minutes in an equal quantity of sugar, which has been previously clarified and boiled can- dy high. Part of the kernels may be added. Cherry Jam. Stone six pounds of cherries; bruise them as they boil, and when the juice is a little wasted, add three pounds of pounded loaf sugar; stir, and take off the scum ; boil till it will jelly. To Preserve Apricots. Weigh equal quantities of fine apricots and of loaf sugar. Pare the fruit wfith a silver knife, and carefully take out the stones; as they are done, 6trew a little pounded sugar over them. Boil the sugar as directed under that head (p. 360); put in the apricots, and let them just simmer; take off the pan, put over it a piece of white paper, and let it stand till nearly cold; put it again on the fire, let them simmer as before, and again cool them ; repeat this three or four times, and the last, let them boil till quite transparent; carefully remove the371 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. scum, and a few minutes before taking them off the fire, blanch the kernels, and add them. If the stones cannot he easily extracted, the apricots may be divided into halves ; or they may he preserved without being stoned. The Moor Park apricot, the best lor eating, and excellent for jam, cannot he preserved so whole as the common apricot. Apricot Jam. Weigh equal quantities of pounded loaf sugar aud of apricots; pare and cut them quite small; as they are done, strew over half of the sugar. The following day, boil the remainder, and add the apricots; stir it till it boils, take off the scum, and when perfectly clear, add part of the kernels blanched, and boil it two or three mi- nutes. Another way to make Apricot Jam. Allow equal proportions of pounded loaf sugar and ' of apricots; pare, and cut them small; as they are done, strew part of the sugar over them, and put the parings into cold water. Break the stones, blanch and pound the kernels, which, with the shells and parings, boil till half the quantity of water is reduced, and there is a sufficien- cy of the liquor, when strained, to allow three or four ta- ble-spoonfuls to a pound of apricots; put it, with the su- gar and fruit, into a preserving-pan ; mash, and take off the scum; boil it quickly, till transparent. Apricots in Brandy. Weigh equal quantities of loaf sugar and of apricots ; 6cald them, and take off the skin. Clarify and boil the sugar, put the fruit into it, and let it remain for two or three days ; put the apricots into glasses. Mix with the sirup the best pale brandy, half and half, and pour it over the apricots, and keep them closely covered. Peaches and nectarines may be done in the same way.372 THE PRACTICE OT COOKERY. To Dry Apricots. Pare the apricots, and carefully take out the stones ; blanch the kernels, and put them into the apricots; strew over a pound of fruit the same quantity of finely-pound- ed loaf sugar, and let them stand till the sugar lias ex- tracted the juice, then boil all together gently; when the fruit is tender, take it out with care, and boil the sirup till very rich; pour it over the fruit, and in three days put it upon dishes, and dry them in the sun under gar- den glasses, turning them once or twice a-day, to keep the shape as round as possible. Any inferior apricots may be cut down and boiled in the sirup, for tarts. To Candy Angelica. Cut the stalks when thick and tender, put them on in boiling water, and when very tender, drain it off, and throw them into cold water; peel off the skin, and scald them in a thin sirup, made with the same proportion of sugar that there is of fruit; heat it twice a-day till the sirup is almost dried in, and then dry them under garden glasses, or in a stove, and turn them twice a-day. To Preserve Quinces. Pare the quinces, and at the end scoop out the core. Put them into a preserving-pan with water, and closely covered; let them boil till soft and of a fine red; when they are cold, put them into a sirup made with the same proportion of sugar as of quinces. The following day, boil them two or three times till clear, and the last time for twelve minutes. Cut some small quinces into quar- ters, put them into a sauce-pan with as much water as will cover them, boil it fast, till strongly flavoured of the quinces; strain it through a flannel bag, and boil a pint of the liquor with a pound of sugar till it be a rich sirup, and when cold, pour it over the quinces.373 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. To Preserve Cucumbers. Lay, in a strong brine of salt and water, some large, smooth, green cucumbers; put vine or cabbage leaves over them, cover the jar or pan, and keep them near the fire till they turn yellow, which may be in three or four days; take them out, wash them, and put them into a pan with leaves under and over, and a little salt in the water; let them simmer, but not boil; when cold, if not sufficiently greened, again put them into fresh water, with fresh leaves. Take them out when cold, divide them into four, scoop out the seeds and soft part, lay them in- to cold water, which change frequently through the day, till it be quite clear and tasteless. Clarify the same weight of sugar as of cucumbers ; soak, in boiling water, some white ginger, scrape it, and put one ounce to a pound of sugar, and the thinly-pared rind of a lemon. Boil them with the sirup, and when cold, put in the cu- cumbers, and boil them slowly for half an hour; put them into jars, and in five days, boil them again for ten minutes; carefully take out the cucumbers, boil up the sirup, and when cold, put it over them. Another way to Preserve Cucumbers. Weigh equal quantities of sugar and the large smooth green cucumbers. Split them down the middle, and take out all the seeds ; cover four large cucumbers, cut in this way, with cold water, mixed with a dessert-spoon- ful of salt; let them stand by the fire-side, or in a warm place, for three or four days. Boil the sugar with as much water as will dissolve it, and as long as any scum rises ; then put in the cucumbers, and simmer them for a little time. Repeat this till they are clear and green, and, the last time of boiling, add some white ginger soaked in hot water and scraped, a few grains of all- spice, and the peel of a lemon cut very thin. Put tlie cucumbers into jars, cover them completely with the sirup, and the following day tie them over with bladder.374. T11E PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Look at them in a week or ten days, and if the sirup be wasted, boil more, and add it when cold. To Preserve Small Cucumbers. Weigh equal proportions of small green cucumbers and of fine loaf sugar, clarify it; rub the cucumbers with a cloth, scald them in hot water, and, when cold, put them into the sirup, with some white ginger and the peel of a lemon ; boil them gently for ten minutes. The following day just let them boil, and repeat this three times, and the last, boil them till tender and clear. To Preserve Oranges. Take 6ix large high-coloured and smooth-skinned bitter oranges; with a pen knife cut the rinds up and down, or into the form of leaves ; cut a hole in the top to admit the end of a tea-spoon, with which carefully scoop out the inside ; put the rinds into cold water, mixed with half a pound of salt. After standing two days and nights, change them into fresh cold water, and change it frequently through the day; then boil them with plenty of cold water in a closely-covered sauce-pan, till the head of a pin will easily pierce them; clarify the sugar, allowing a pound to each orange ; place the skins in a potting can or flat vessel, and pour the sirup into and over them. The following day pour it off, boil it up, and repeat this four times, and, at the last, add the strained juice of four bitter oranges and the prepared rinds, and boil them about eight minutes ; carefully take them out, one by one, and put them into jars, and pour over the sirup so as entirely to cover them. They may be served with a rich custard put into them. To Preserve Sliced Oranges. Weigh a pound of oranges, add one pound and a half of loaf sugar; grate a little of the rind off each orange, put them into a pan of water, cover it closely, and boil them till the head of a pin will easily pierce the rind ; cut them orwl375 TI1E PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Bed sugar till perfectly clear, which may be in twenty minutes. Damson Cheese. Put sound fresh-gathered damsons into an earthen jar, tie it closely with a bladder, and put it into a pot of cold water ; let it boil for three or four hours ; add more boil- ing water as it wastes. Strain the juice through a sieve, and to each pint allow sixteen ounces of pounded loaf sugar; boil and stir it over a clear fire till it will jelly, which may be in three quarters of an hour ; pour it into shapes, small saucers, or flat plates, to dry. Keep it in a box with sheets of white paper between each layer. Apricot cheese may be made in this way. To Preserve Siberian Crabs. Boil, in half a pint of water, a little cinnamon, sliced ginger, and a few cloves, till the flavour be extracted ; strain, and boil it with one pound of pounded loaf sugar; 6kim and boil it ten minutes; let it stand till cold, and then add a pint of fine Siberian crabs, which make scald- ing hot in tiie sirup ; take them off the fire till nearly cold ; heat them in the same manner three times. If the under ones look clear, carefully take them out, and put them into a jar, and let the rest boil till quite clear. To Preserve Jargonelle Pears. Gather pears with stalks before they are quite ripe; allow equal quantities of fine loaf sugar and of fruit. Pare the pears as thinly as possible, keeping on the stalks; carefully cut out the black top ; as they are peeled put them into cold water. Put cabbage leaves into the bot- tom of a preserving pan; lay in the pears, cover them with cold water and one or two cabbage leaves upon the top ; boil them thirty minutes, and lay them upon a dish. To six pounds of sugar allow a quart of water, boil and 6kim it; then add one ounce of white ginger, previously soaked in hot water, and scraped clean, and the juice and thinly pared rind of two lemons. Boil the sirup ten mi-37G THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. nutes, put in the pears, and let them boil twenty mi- nutes ; take them out, put them into a bowl or deep dish, boil the sirup eight minutes, and when cold pour it over the pears ; cover them with paper; in four days pour oft the sirup, boil it eight minutes, and pour it over the pears when cold. In four days repeat this process, and do it a third time ; then stick a clove into each pear, where the black top was cut out. Put them into jars, divide the ginger and lemon peel, and pour on the sirup when cold. Peacli Jam. Gather the peaches when quite ripe, peel and stone them, put them into a preserving pan, and mash them over the fire till hot; rub them through a sieve, and add to a pound of pulp the same weight of pounded loaf sugar, and half an ounce of bitter almonds, blanched and pound- ed ; let it boil ten or twelve minutes, stir and skim it vvell. -♦ To Preserve Figs. Aij'ow equal weight of loaf sugar and of small green fig^pwipe, and cut them across the top; lay them into a strong brine of salt and water for ten days. Boil them in water till the head of a pin will easily pierce them, and then lay them into cold water for four days, changing it daily. Clarify the sugar, and put in the figs while hot; heat them in the sirup three times, and the last, boil them till they look green and clear. To Preserve Apples. Pare, core, and quarter six pounds of good hard ba- king apples; finely pound four pounds of loaf sugar; put a layer of each alternately, with half a pound of the best white ginger, into a jar; let it remain eight-and-forty hours ; infuse, for half that time, in a little boiling water, half a quarter of a pound of bruised white ginger ; strain and boil the liquor with the apples till they look clear, and the sirup rich and thick, which may be in about an hour.377 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. lake off the scum as it rises. When to be eaten, pick out the whole ginger. To Preserve Green Gages. Gather the largest green gage plums with stalks; al- low an equal proportion of loaf sugar; put vine or cab- bage leaves into the bottom of a pan, lay in the fruit, cover with leaves, and till up with cold water. When the plums rise to the top, take them off, and carefully pare off the skin, and put them upon a sieve. Drain the water from the leaves ; with fresh ones again heat the plums in it, and closely cover the pan ; they must be done very slowly, and will take some hours to become green. Take them out and drain them upon a sieve. Cla- rify the sugar, boil it for eight minutes, put in the plums, boil them gently till transparent, and carefully put them into jars. Boil the sirup a few minutes, and pour it over them when cold. In three or four days pour' off the sirup, boil it up, and, when cold, put it over the fruit. Another way to Preserve Green Gages". Put the plums into boiling water, pare off the skin, and divide them ; take an equal quantity of pounded loaf sugar, strew half of it over the fruit; let it remain some hours, and, with the remainder of the sugar, put it into a preserving pan ; boil till the plums look quite clear, take off the scum as it rises, and, a few minutes before taking them off the fire, add the kernels. Apple Jelly. Pare and cut into slices eighteen large acid apples ; boil them in as much water as will cover them ; when quite soft, dip a coarse cloth into hot water, wring it dry, and strain the apples through it; to each pint of juice allow fourteen ounces of fine loaf sugar, clarify it, and add, with the apple juice, the peel of a large lemon ; boil it till it jellies, which may be in twenty minutes ; pick out the lemon peel, and immediately put it into378 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Another way to make Apple Jelly. Pare and mince three dozen of juicy acid apples, put them into a pan, cover them with water, and boil them till very soft; strain them through a thin cloth or flannel bag; allow a pound of loaf sugar to a pint of juice; clarify and boil it; add the apple juice, with the grated peel and juice of six lemons ; boil it for twenty minutes ; take off the scum as it rises. Gooseberry Cheese. Top and tail some red gooseberries, put them into a jar, tie it over, and boil it in a pan of water till the fruit will easily pulp through a fine hair sieve ; allow a quarter of a pound of loaf sugar to a pint of the juice, stir, boil, and skim it for twenty minutes, put it into saucers or small plates, dry it before the fire, and when dry, keep it between folds of white paper. To keep Currants for Tarts. Gather the fruit perfectly diy, and before it be too ripe, pick it from the stalks, and put it into clean, dry, wide-mouthed bottles ; if the flavour of raspberries is ap- proved, some may be added with the currants ; tie tightly over each bottle a piece of sound bladder previously soak- ed in water; set them into a pan of-cold water with a lit- tle straw at the bottom, and a little between the bottles ; put them on the fire, and when they begin to simmer, keep them in that state about three quarters of an hour, but they must not be allowed to boil; take the pan off the fire ; the bladders will be raised, but will fall soon after, and 6ink into the mouth of the bottles ; in an hour, take them out, and tie strong paper over each, and set them in a dry cool place. The bottles may be placed in a bottle rack with the neck downwards. Damsons, cherries, and gooseberries, may be done in this way; any sort will keep for a year. Cut off’ the stalks of the cherries, and top and tail the gooseberries.379 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. To Keep Green Gooseberries. Gather the gooseberries when quite formed, but not the least soft; top and tail them ; fill them into wide- mouthed bottles up to the neck, and cork them slightly; place them in a copper, with saw-dust or straw in the bot- tom, and pour in cold water to reach to the necks of the bottles; light the fire, and when the water boils up, in- stantly take out the bottles, and fill them up from a tea- kettle with boiling water; cork them again slightly, and when cold, put them in tightly; lay the bottles upon their sides in a dry cool place, and turn them every other day for a month. When to be used, the liquor and fruit are put into a dish, and sweetened with brown sugar. To save Sugar in Preserving Cherries, Green Gages, Damsons, Currants, and Raspberries. Gather the fruit perfectly dry, and to a pound allow five ounces of finely-pounded loaf sugar; put a layer of fruit into a wide-mouthed bottle or jar, and then one of sugar, till the vessel is full; tie over it tightly two folds of sound bladder, and put them into a copper or pan, with straw in the bottom, and water as high as the necks, and let them simmer for three hours. When the water cools, take out the bottles, and keep them in a cool dry place. Damsons for Winter use. Gather the damsons when just ripe, and perfectly sound ; fill a two-gallon brandy keg, and pour over two pounds of treacle; close the keg firmly, and turn it every day. ^ To Preserve Damsons. To every pound of damsons allow three quarters of a pound of pounded loaf sugar ; put into jars alternately a layer of damsons, and one of sugar; tie them over with bladder or strong paper, and put them into an oven after the bread is withdrawn, and let them remain till the oven is cold. The following day strain off the sirup, and boilTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 380 it till thick. When cold, put the damsons one by one into small jars, and pour over them the sirup, which must cover them. Tie them over with wet bladder. Another way to Preserve Damsons. Prick them with a needle, and boil them with sugar in the same proportion as in the receipt to preserve dam- sons, till the sirup will jelly. Carefully take oft’ all the scum. To Preserve the Purple Plum. Put into a stone jar a layer of fruit, and one of brown sugar ^.allowing one pound to a pound of the fruit; cover the jar with linen and bladder, and bake it in an oven for one or two hours; In a few weeks pour off the sirup, and boil it a short time; skim it, and when cold, pour it over the fruit. It may be eaten with cream, or made into tarts or pud- dings. Gooseberry and Raspberry Cakes. Gather the gooseberries upon a dry day, and before they are quite ripe; top and tail them ; scald them, or put them into an earthen jar ; tie it over closely with bladder, and place it in a pan of water; let it boil till the fruit is sufficiently tender to pulp through a sieve. To a pound of the pulp add one pouftd of pounded and sifted loaf sugar, and the well-beaten white of one egg; mix all together, and whisk it for three hours ; drop the cakes upon wri- ting paper, and dry them in the sun, or upon a stove. For the raspberry cakes, allow a pound of sugar to a pint of the fruit, measured before it is scalded, or pulped through a sieve ; allow one white of an egg to each pound, and for each sort of cakes dry the sugar well, and use it . while it is warm. Keep them in a tin box, with folds of white paper between each layer. Quince Cakes. Bon. the quinces till quite soft, rub them through a381 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. sieve, ami to a pint of juice add three quarters of a pound of pounded loaf sugar; mix all well together, and make it scalding hot, but do not allow it to boil ; drop it upon tins in the form of small cakes, and dry them in a cool oven and before the fire. ' Seville Orange Cakes. Divide the oranges in half, take out the seeds, and put the pulp and juice into a basin ; boil the rinds in a sauce- pan of water, closely covered ; when very tender take them out, and dry them upon a cloth ; allow to a pound of orange rinds, two of pounded loaf sugar; pound the rinds in a mortar; add by degrees the sugar, and then the juice and pulp ; mix it thoroughly till thick and yellow ; drop it upon tins in small cakes, and dry them under gar- den glasses, or in a cool oven. If it be too thick to drop, let it stand a night. To Dry Cherries. Gather the cherries perfectly dry, and to every six pounds allow one and a half of finely-pounded loaf sugar; strew it over the cherries in a deep dish, and let them re- main twelve hours; put them into a preserving pan ; make them scalding hot; put them into a bowl ; the next day again heat them ; take them out of the sirup, and lay them upon sieves under garden glasses, to dry in the sun ; turn them daily upon clean sieves, till quite dry; spread them upon sheets of white paper, and keep them in a box. The sirup may be boiled tillthick, and kept as a jelly, or with currants made into a tart. To Dry Barberries in Bunches. Gather the barberries when ripe; tie the finest into bunches ; bruise some of the inferior ones, and boil them in water; strain, and boil in a pint of it one pound and a half of loaf sugar to every three pounds of barberries ; skim and boil the sugar fifteen minutes; put in the bunches of fruit, and simmer them for six minutes ; let them stand in a china bowl till tiie following day, and boil them \THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 382 gently till clear. When cold, take them out of the sirup, and dry them under garden glasses ; turn them daily. To Candy Currants, Barberries, and other Fruit. Roil the fruit in clarified sugar as for preserving ; take it out of the sirup and drain it upon sieves; sift over it through a lawn sieve, till quite white, pounded loaf sugar. Place them in a cool oven, and turn and dust them with sugar till dry. Raspberry Vinegar. Bruise a quart of fresh-gathered raspberries in a china basin ; pour over it a pint of good vinegar, cover it close- ly ; let it stand three days, and stir it daily ; strain it through a flannel bag ; let it drip as long as any thing will come from it, but do not press it; to a pint of the liquor put one pound of pounded loaf sugar, boil it ten minutes, and take off the scum as it rises. When cold, bottle and cork it tightly. A glass of brandy may be added to a quart of raspberry vinegar. Another way to make Raspberry Vinegar. Fill a dry clean bottle with raspberries, and put as much vinegar as the bottle will contain ; stop it closely, and let it stand for a month; then strain it, and to a pint of the liquor put a pound of loaf sugar; boil it for half an hour; skim it. When cold, bottle and cork it tightly. Sirup of Currants, Raspberries, or Mulberries. Pick the fruit from the stalks; squeeze the juice, and let it stand ten days or a fortnight, or till the fermenta- tion ceases, which may be known by the scum crack- ing ; carefully take off the scum, and pour the juice gently into a fresh vessel; let it stand twenty-four hours, and again pour it off; to one pound of pounded loaf sugar al- low thirteen "bfihces of the juice, put it into a preserving * 3THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 383 pan, and when it begins to boil, strain it through a jelly bag, and bottle it when cold. Burie pears boiled, in a little of the sirup, are beauti- ful. Black Currant Lozenges. Put six quarts of clean-picked black currants into a preserving-pan ; with the hand bruise them as long as the heat will admit; squeeze them through a sieve, and to every pint of juice put four ounces of good brown sugar ; boil and stir it for three quarters of an hour, and then pour it thinly over saucers or small plates, and dry it for three successive days before the fire ; cut it into small dice, or with a turnip-scoop ; lay them upon white paper in a box. Or the cakes may be cut into lozenges as they are re- quired. A little dissolved isinglass may be added while the juice is boiling. Elder Rob. Gather the elder berries when quite ripe, put them into a stone jar, tie a bladder or paper over the top, and place the jar in a pan of water; let it boil till the berries are very soft; strain them through a coarse cloth, and to every pint of juice allow half a pound of good brown su- gar ; put it into a preserving-pan, stir it, and when it boils, take off the scum, and let it boil for one hour. Cinnamon Tablet. To a pound of loaf sugar, clarified and boiled till it can be blown through the holes of a skimmer, allow half an ounce of pounded and sifted cinnamon, or a tea-spoonful of the oil of cinnamon ; stir it well with the sugar, and press it with a spoon to the sides of the pan, to make it perfectly smooth ; rub some plates over with fresh butter, and pour in the tablet. When cold, cut it into square bits. Ginger tablet may be made in this way, allowing a quar- ter of an ounce of ginger to a pound of 8ugar.^THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 381 Lemon Drops. Squeeze and strain the juice of six good-sized lemons ; mix with it pounded and sifted loaf sugar, till so thick that it is stirred with difficulty ; put it into a preserving-pan, and, with a wooden spoon, stir it constantly, and let it boil five or six minutes ; then drop it from the point of a knife, upon writing paper, in drops as large as a shilling. When cold, they will readily come off. Barley Sugar Drops. Clarify and boil the sugar to that degree, that upon dipping in a wooden stick and plunging it into cold wa- ter, the sugar becomes crisp, and will snap; boil with it the thinly-pared rind of one or two lemons ; drop the su- gar upon a stone or marble slab in round drops ; when quite cold, roll them in sifted loaf sugar, and lay them be- tween layers of white paper, or fold them in little bits of square paper, and twist it at the end. Barley Sugar. Boil the sugar as for the drops, and flavour it with le- mon juice, or oil of lemons ; rub a little fresh butter over a stone or marble slab, and pour the sugar along it in nar- row strips; twist it while warm, and when cold, with a knife mark it across, and it will break into any lengths.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 385 CHAPTER XVII. VINEGARS. A Cask which has not contained vinegar before, should have a quart of boiling hot vinegar poured into it, shaken till cold, and allowed to stand for some hours. Sugar Vinegar. To five gallons of water put eight pounds of coarse brown sugar ; let it boil as long as any scum rises, which must be carefully removed ; then pour it into a cask, and when it is about milk warm, or from 60 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit, cut off the crust, and toast a quarter of a slice of bread, and cover it over with fresh yeast; put it into the cask, leave it open for four or five days, and then paste over the bung-hole a piece of paper, and pierce it here and there %vith a pin. It should be kept in a warm, dry place, without being moved; and if made in March or April, it may be drawn off and bottled in September, when some persons boil it over again, to prevent the mother from forming in the bottles. The vinegar cask, as soon as emptied, should be again filled in the same manner. Gooseberry Vinegar. Gather yellow gooseberries when quite ripe, crush and mash them well in a tub with a large wooden pestle ; to every two gallons of gooseberries, after being mashed, 2 BTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 386 put two of water; mix them well together; let it work for three weeks, stirring the mass two or three times each day; then strain the liquor through a hair sieve, and put to every gallon one pound of brown sugar, one pound of treacle, and a table-spoonful of fresh yeast; let it work for three or four days in the same tub, which has been well washed; then run it into iron-hooped casks. Let it stand twelve months, and bottle it for use. This is a very strong vinegar. Another way to make Gooseberry Vinegar. Bruise to a mash any kind of gooseberries, when quite ripe, and mix thoroughly with a gallon of the mash three of cold boiled water; let it stand twenty-four hours, strain it through a cloth, and to each gallon of the liquor, put one pound of brown sugar; mix it well, and when quite dissolved, put it into a cask. It must stand nine or ten months before being bottled. American Vinegar. Boil six gallons of water, and add, while it is hot, four quarts of molasses ; put it into a tub to cool; when milk* warm, stir in a pint of fresh yeast; put it into the cask, and set it by the fire for twenty-four hours ; then put it in the sun, with a bottle in the bung-hole. Bottle it three months afterwards. Cucumber Vinegar. Pare ten large cucumbers, cut them into thin slices ; pour over them a quart of vinegar; add a clove of garlic, and one or two shalots, a tea-spoonful of ground white pepper, and one of salt; let it stand for ten or twelve days; strain and bottle it; put a little whole pepper into the mouth of each bottle, and cork it tightly. The flavour of the cucumber may be very well preserved, by simply steeping them in vinegar. Garlic Vinegar. Cut small one ounce and a half of garlic, bruise oneTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 387 nutmeg ami three cloves, steep them in a quart of vine- gar for a week, shaking it daily; then strain and bottle it. Shalot vinegar is made in the same manner. Harvey’s, or Camp Vinegar. Put the following ingredients into two quarts of strong vinegar, three table-spoonfuls of Indian soy, and the same quantity of mushroom catsup, six anchovies, two heads of garlic, a quarter of an ounce of cayenne, and as much cochineal as will colour it; shake it two or three times a-day for a fortnight, then filter, and bottle it for use. Two tea-spoonfuls of this vinegar improves salad sauce, fish and sauce also, and is good in most made dishes. Elder Flower and Tarragon Vinegar. Fill a quart bottle with the flowers of elder, or the leaves of tarragon, when it is in flower; pour vinegar upon them, and let them infuse for a fortnight; then strain it through a flannel bag, and put it into small bottles. By the same means, vinegar may be flavoured with the fi esh-gathered leaves of any sweet herb. Vinegar front the Refuse of Raisin Wine. On the raisins from which ten gallons of wine has been made, five gallons of nearly boiling water is poured, the dregs or lees, and stalks, are added; it is then covered up, and stirred occasionally. When the taste is com- pletely extracted from the fruit, it is squeezed, and the vinegar strained and put into a cask, in which it should remain nine or ten months. Vinegar from Honey. Half a pound of honey must be put to a pint of water, and the honey well dissolved. This mixture is then ex- posed to the greatest heat of the sun, without closing wholly the bung-hole of the cask, which must be merely covered with coarse linen, to prevent the admission of in- sects. In about six weeks, the liquor becomes acid, and changes to a very strong vinegar, and of excellent quality.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY, 388 PICKLES. PREPARATORY REMARKS ON PICKLES. Pickles ought to be stored in a dry place, and the vessels most approved of for keeping them in, are wide- mouthed glass bottles, or strong stone-ware jars, having corks or bungs, which must be fitted in with linen, and covered with bladder or leather; and for taking the pickles out and returning them to the jar, a small wooden spoon is kept. The strongest vinegar is used for pickling ; that of white wine is more particularly recommended, but sugar vinegar will generally be found sufficiently strong. It is essential to the excellence and beauty of pickles, that they be always completely covered with vinegar. To Pickle Gherkins. Gather, upon a dry day, some small cucumbers or gherkins ; lay them into cold salt-and-water for four days, with a cabbage leaf laid over to keep them down ; drain them, and put them into a perfectly clean brass pan, with vine or cabbage leaves in the bottom, and cover them with vinegar and water half and half, strewing a little pounded alum, and putting more leaves over them ; let the water get scalding hot; take off the pan ; when nearly cold, make it again hot, and repeat this as frequently as possible through the day. With fresh leaves, and the same liquor, put them into a basin to stand all night; the next morning, with fresh leaves under and over, and the same liquor, heat them twice, and then drain them ; and389 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. if for six or eight dozen, put them into the pan with half a pint of vinegar, and water sufficient to cover them, and some salt; scald them as before, and put them off and on the fire till they are a good green ; drain, and pour over them boiling water; let them lie a short time in this, and put them into wide-mouthed bottles or stone jars; have ready vinegar boiled up with bruised nutmeg half an ounce, of ginger, black peppercorns, and whole allspice, one ounce each to a quart; pour it upon the gherkins while hot; cover them till cold, and tie them down with bladders. French beans done in this way are beautiful, and answer well pickled with the gherkins, and kept together. Nasturtium buds or imitation capers may be done after this receipt. There is no method adopted which produces so fine a green in pickles, as the use of a brass pan ; but where it is objected to, they may be done by the following re- ceipts. Gherkins. Make a pickle of salt-and-water strong enough to bear an egg, carefully skimming it while boiling; when cold, put in gherkins or French beans, or whatever is to be pickled, and let them stand at the side of the fire for three days; pour off the brine, wipe them dry, and put them into a stone jar. In another stone jar, boil, upon a hot plate, or in a water bath, as much strong vinegar as will cover the pickles; pour it over them, and cover them with fresh-gathered vine or cabbage leaves; place a cloth or plate over the jar, and let it stand by the side of the fire. Next day pour off the vinegar, boil it as before, and pour it over the pickle, and cover them with fresh leaves; and if they are not a good green colour, repeat the same process a third time. Then put them into wide-mouthed glass bottles, or into strong stone-ware jars ; boil vinegar, together with spices, in the following proportions: bruised nutmeg half an ounce, black peppercorns, whole allspice, and ginger, one ounce each to a quart: pour it hot over390 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. the pickles, cover them, and when cold, close the bottles or jars with a bung, and tie over them bladder or leather. Cucumber Mangoes. Cut a long narrow piece out of the sides of large Tur- key cucumbers, scoop out the seeds, and with a part of them mix some mustard seed, shred garlic, and grated horse-radish; stuff’ the space as full as it will admit of, and replace the piece which was cut off; bind them with a thread; put over them hot vinegar three successive days, and boil with it the last time black pepper, flour of mustard, and some salt; put them into jars, and pour over them the boiling vinegar, and when cold, cover them • Sliced Cucumbers and Onions. Cut full-grown cucumbers into slices about a quarter of an inch thick, and slice some onions thin ; then lay them into a dish together, and strew salt over them; co- ver them with another dish, and let them remain for twenty-four hours. Put them into a cullender to drain, then into a large jar, and pour over them boiled vinegar three successive days; the last time of boiling the vine- gar, add white pepper and ginger, pour it over them hot, and closely cover them when cold. • Walnuts. Gather them for pickling when the head of a pin will pierce them easily ; run a large needle through them here and there, or score them on one side with a knife; lay them into a brine of salt-and-water for twelve dp.ys, changing the brine twice in that time; strain, and put them into a jar, and sprinkle a little salt over them. Boil four quarts of vinegar for a hundred walnuts, allowing to each quart one ounce of whole black pepper, and one of ginger, half an ounce each of sliced nutmeg and whole all- spice, a table-spoonful of mustard seed, and one of scra- ped horse-radish, one head of garlic, or a small onion ; pour it boiling hot over the tvalnuts, and put a plate on31)1 THE PRACTICE Ol’ COOKERY. the jar ; when cold, tie it closely down. After the wal- nuts are used, the liquor may he boiled, strained, and bot- tled, to use as a pickle. Another way to Pickle Walnuts. Gather the nuts before the inside shell is hard, which may be known by trying them with a pin ; lay them into salt and water nine days, changing the liquor every three days; then take them out, and dry them in the air on a sieve or mat; they should not touch each other, and they should be turned, that every side may become black alike; then put them into a jar. When half the nuts are in, put in an onion, with about thirty cloves stuck into it, and add the rest of the nuts. To one hundred walnuts allow half a pint of mustard seed, a quarter of an ounce of mace, half an ounce of black peppercorns, and six bay leaves ; boil all the spice in some good common vinegar, and pour it boiling upon the nuts, observing that they are entirely covered ; stop the mouth of the jar with a cloth, and when cold, cover it with bladder or leather. In about six weeks they will be fit for use, when they should be exa- mined, and if they have absorbed the vinegar so much as to leave any of the nuts dry, more should be added, but it need not be boiled. Walnut Catsup. When green walnuts are fit for pickling, take a quart of the expressed juice, to which add one pint of vinegar; let it stand four days, then mix with it two large table- spoonfuls of salt; boil it till nearly half wasted ; tie in a piece of muslin the following ingredients : the peel of a bitter orange, a small head of garlic separated, a quarter of an ounce each of finely-beaten mace, nutmeg, and cloves; put it into the bottom of a jar, and pour upon it the boiling liquor. Cover it closely, let it stand for a month, then strain and bottle it. Another way to make Walnut Catsup. Slice a hundred full-grown walnuts without shelling392 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. them, then beat them in a mortar; put them into a jar, with half a pound of shalots sliced, two heads of garlic, one pound of salt, and two quarts of vinegar; let it stand a week, stirring two or three times each day. Strain, and put the liquor into a sauce-pan, with a pint of port wine, two ounces of anchovies, and two of black pepper, half an ounce of cloves, and the same of mace ; let it boil for half an hour, skim it well, run it through a jelly-bag, and when quite cold, put it into small bottles; cork them closely, and seal them; keep them in a dry place. It will keep for years, and is used as a fish sauce. It may be made without the wine. Mushroom Catsup. Cut off the stalks from the broad flat mushrooms; peel, and break them into small bits; strew salt equally over them, allowing a large table-spoonful to every quart of the pulp. Let them stand twenty-four hours ; put all in- to a sauce-pan, and let it boil gently for three quarters of an hour; strain, and let it stand to settle. The next day pour off the clear part, and to every pint of the liquor add half the quantity of port wine or old strong beer, a few blades of mace, twelve black peppercorns, and the same of allspice, a piece of ginger bruised, and eight cloves. Simmer it for nearly twenty minutes, pour it out, and when cold, bottle it with the spices equally divided. Another way to make Mushroom Catsup. Having cut out the stalks, and the worm-eaten parts of the mushrooms, break them small, and strew over them some salt; let them stand twenty-four hours. Strain off the liquor, and to a quart put the well-beaten whites of two or three eggs ; boil it, and run it through a flannel bag; th^n boil it for about ten minutes with a little salt, three quarters of an ounce of black, and a quarter of an ounce of Jamaica pepper. When cold, bottle it with the spices, and seal the corks.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 393 Oyster Catsup. Boil one hundred oysters with their liquor, till the strength be extracted from them ; strain them well, and add to the liquor an equal quantity of wine, one half port and the other sherry, also a quarter of an ounce of mace, the same of white pepper and of allspice, a drachm or tea-spoonful of ginger, and six anchovies; boil all toge- ther about fifteen minutes. Put into a jar twelve shalots, the peel of a lemon, and a piece of horse-radish cut small; pour upon them the boiling liquor, and when cold, bottle it, together with the spices. Prince of Wales’s Catsup. Strip and fill a jar with ripe elder-berries; add as much vinegar as the jar will contain, put it into a cool oven, and let it stand all night. Run the liquor through a jelly-bag, and to every pint put two ounces of ancho- vies, one of shalots; of cloves, mace, nutmeg, and ginger, a drachm or tea-spoonful each; boil it till the anchovies are dissolved. When cold, strain and bottle it. Lemon Pickle. Cut into quarters, and pick out all the seeds of six middling-sized lemons; put them into a jar, strew over them two ounces of well-beaten bay salt; cover the jar with a cloth and plate, and let it stand three days; then put to them cloves and a quarter of an ounce of mace beaten fine, one ounce of garlic or shalot, two of mus- tard-seed bruised, and one nutmeg sliced. Make a quart of vinegar boiling hot, and pour it over the ingredients; cover the jar, and in three or four days close it with a bung, and tie-leather over it. It will be fit for use in a week, and is an improvement to most sauces, and parti- cularly to fish sauce. Another way to make Lemon Pickle. Grate oft’ a little of the outer rind of two dozen of lemons, divide them into four rather more than half wayTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 394 down, leaving the bottom part whole; rub on them equal- ly half a pound of finely-beaten bay salt, spread them upon a large dish, and put them into a cool oven. When the juice has dried up, put them into a stone jar, with an ounce of cloves and one of mace finely beaten, one ounce of nutmeg cut into thin slices, a quarter of an ounce of cayenne, and four ounces of garlic peeled, also half a pint of white mustard-seed bruised and tied in a bit of muslin. Pour over the whole two quarts of boiling vinegar, stop the jar closely, and let it stand for three months; then strain it through a hair sieve, pressing it well through ; let it stand till the next day, pour off the clear, and put it into small bottles. Let the dregs stand covered some days, when it will become fine. It will keep good for years. When the lemons are to be used as a pickle, no straining is necessary. Another way to make Lemon Pickle. Cut into slices nine lemons, and put over them one pound of salt, two ounces of horse-radish sliced thin, the same of flour of mustard, half an ounce of white pepper, of cloves, nutmeg, mace, and cayenne, a quarter of an ounce each ; pound the spices, add three quarts of vine- gar, and boil the whole twenty minutes; put it into a jar, and let it stand three weeks, stirring it daily; then strain it through a sieve, and keep it for use in small bottles. To Pickle Eggs. Boil twelve eggs for twelve minutes, dip them into cold water, and take off’ the shells ; boil a quart of vine- gar for a quarter of an hour, with half an ounce each of black and Jamaica pepper, and ginger, also some slices of beet-root; put in the eggs to boil for eight or ten mi- nutes, then put them into a jar with a slice of beet-root laid on each, and cover them with the vinegar and spi- ces. They will be fit for use in four days, and are ser- ved in the following manner:—Place two or three in a305 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. dish, and put round them one or two cut into slices, then garnish with curled parsley. To Pickle Mushrooms. Cut off the stalks, and wash clean, in cold water, some small button mushrooms; rub them with a bit of flannel, then throw them into fresh water, and when per- fectly clean, put them into a sauce-pan with fresh cold water, and let them boil eight or ten minutes; strain off' the water, lay them into the folds of a cloth. Boil, in a quart of vinegar, a quarter of an ounce of white pepper, the same of allspice, and two or three blades of mace, and a tea-spoonful of salt; put the mushrooms into a jar, and when the vinegar is cold, pour it, with the spices, over them. Another way to Pickle Mushrooms. Clean them nicely, put them into ajar, cover them with vinegar, add a little salt, white pepper, and allspice; boil them in a water bath, or upon a hot plate, till the mush- rooms ai-e tender. Before bottling, put in a few shalots; cover them closely when cold. To Pickle Beet-Root. Wash it perfectly clean, but do not cut off any of the fibres; put it on in plenty of boiling water with a little salt, and boil it for half an hour; if the skin will come off easily, it is done enough. Lay it upon a cloth, and with a coarse one rub off’ the skin. Cut it into slices, put it into a jar, and pour over it vinegar which has become cold, after having been boiled in the proportion of half an ounce of whole black pepper and a race of ginger to a quart. Cover the jar closely when cold. To Pickle Onions. Take off the outer skin of some small white onions, let them lie in salt-and-water for a week, changing it dai- ly; then put them into ajar, and pour over them boiling salt-and-water; cover them closely, drain off’ the pickle396 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. when cold. Put the onions into wide-mouthed bottles, and fill them up with strong vinegar, putting in a little sliced ginger; cork the bottles closely. To Pickle Young Onions. Choose some of the small silver onion, put them on in cold water, and when it is scalding hot, take them out with an egg slice; peel off’ the skins till they look white and clear; lay them into the folds of a cloth. Boil, in a quart of vinegar, half an ounce of white pepper, a quarter of an ounce of allspice, the same of garlic, and one sliced nutmeg; put the onions into a jar, and pour over them the boiling vinegar and spices. When cold, tie leather over the jar. Another way to Pickle Young Onions. Peel some small onions, and steep them in salt-and- water for two days, changing the water two or three times ; then drain them, and, when perfectly dry, put them into small jars, and pour over them, when cold, white wine vinegar which has been boiled with some whole black pepper and a few cloves. Hot Pickle. Boil, in two quarts of vinegar, a quarter of a pound of salt, two ounces of shalots or garlic, and two of gin- ger, one ounce of white pepper, one of yellow mustard seed, and a quarter of an ounce of cayenne; put into a jar that will hold four quarts, two ounces of allspice, and pour on it the hot pickle. When cold, put in any fresh- gathered vegetables or fruit, such as asparagus, cauli- flower, French beans, radish pods, unripe apples, goose- berries, currants, which may be added as the opportunity offers, and, as the pickle wastes, it should be replenished with the same mixture. To Pickle Red Cabbage. Choose two middling-sized, well-coloured, and firmTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 397 red cabbages, shred them very finely, first pulling off the outside leaves; mix with them nearly half a pound of salt, tie it up in a thin cloth, and let it hang for twelve hours; then put it into small jars, and pour over it cold vinegar that has been boiled with a few barberries in it ; tie the jar over closely with bladder; or boil, in a quart of vinegar, three bits of ginger, half an ounce of black and Jamaica pepper, and a quarter of an ounce of cloves. When cold, pour it over the red cabbage. To Pickle Barberries. Boil the bruised berries of a few bunches in salt-and- water; strain, and put a gill of the liquor to a quart of vinegar, with an ounce of salt, a quarter of a pound of loaf sugar, a quarter of an ounce of pounded ginger, and a little sliced horse-radish ; boil and strain it, then pour it hot over the barberries, the finest bunches having been previously selected and placed in jars ; when cold, cover them closely with bladder. They may also be kept in a jar, with a strong brine of salt-and-water poured over them. When any scum is observed upon the surface, the brine must be poured off, and some fresh added. They are kept closely covered. To Pickle Green or Red Capsicums. PLACE the capsicums in ajar, boil a dessert-spoonful of salt in a quart of vinegar, and pour it, while hot, upon the peppers ; when cold, place a plate on the jar, and tie over it bladder or leather. They will be fit for use in a few weeks. Indian Pickle. Scrape and wash a pound of white ginger ; cut it into thin slices, and put it into Salt-and-water for one night; then lay it upon a dish, strew salt over it, and let it stand till the rest of the ingredients are ready. Cut into bits a pound of garlic, let it lie for three days in salt; wash, drain, and dry it upon a sieve before the fire, or in theTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 398 sun ; boil, for a quarter of an hour, in some salt-ami -water, some summer cabbages, cut them into quarters, drain them, and strew on them some finely-minced fresh beef suet; let them lie for twelve hours, then pull them into small bits, and dry them under glasses in the sun, so that no dust can get at them ; turn them constantly for three days, and, if not quite dry, put them before the fire ; they should be,like parchment. Boil, in salt-and-water, cauli- flower, celery, French beans, and sliced horse-radish; pull the cauliflower into bits, and cut the celery into pieces an inch long; dry them in the sun or by the fire. Finely bruise a quarter of a pound of mustard-seed and an ounce of turmeric, add with it a quarter of a pound of long pepper, and the same of allspice, to a quart of the strong- est vinegar; boil it, and add three quarts of common vine- gar ; pour it, when boiling hot, upon all the dried vegeta- bles placed in a jar. In three weeks, if the vinegar be much wasted, fill it up with more. The jar may be add- ed to, every year ; and the pickles keep good any length of time. To Pickle Artichoke Bottoms. Boil the artichokes till the leaves can be pulled off without breaking the bottoms ; leave on the part called the choke, set them aside till cold, then put them into wide-mouthed bottles. Boil, in vinegar, some salt, white pepper, mace, and sliced nutmeg, and, when cold, pour it over the artichokes; tie bladder over the bottles. Walnut Pickle. Put any quantity of the outside shells or green rinds of ripe walnuts into a tub in which there is a tap-hole ; sprinkle them with water, raise the tub on one side, that it may stand in a sloping direction, place another vessel under it to receive the juice as it drops from the tap-hole ; this it will soon begin to do ; and, when a sufficient quantity has been obtained, to one gallon of this black liquor add two large table-spoonfuls of salt, one largeTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 399 onion, a stick of horse-radish, a bunch of sweet herbs, two bay leaves, a quarter of an. ounce of black pepper, the same of allspice and of bruised ginger. Boil it slowly for twenty minutes ; strain it, and, when cold, stir it and bottle it for use, putting the spice into the bottles.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 400 CHAPTER XVIII. WINES. PREPARATORY REMARKS UPON DOMESTIC WINES. All wines are reducible to four general divisions of dry and strong; sweet; light and flavoured ; and brisk. When a dry wine is desired, the liquor is suffered to re- main in the vat for three, four, or more days, according to circumstances ; and a cask is provided for it sufficiently large to prevent the yeast from escaping at the bung- hole. To make a sweet wine, the fermentation must be discouraged by speedily removing it from the vat to the cask, which is carefully filled as the fluid subsides, and by frequent racking or sulphuring, or by both. To pro- duce a light flavoured wine, similar to burgundy, the fluid is allowed to remain from six to twenty hours in the vat; and, for wines to resemble champagne, it is necessary the juice should remain in the vat hut a few hours. Where small quantities are operated upon, the fermentation may be begun in the cask, the mask or mash being previously strained; for in no case should solid matter be introduced into the cask. The wine is strong- est when the fermentation has been partially carried on in close vessels ; and the flavour is also better preserved.401 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. To have a wine resembling champagne, a partially close mode of fermentation is adopted. For rich and strong sweet wines, the whole fermentation may be carried on openly; but, in all cases, it seems a useful practice to cover the vat with boards and blankets. The fermenta- tion is much sooner completed in a large than in a small vessel. The sweeter and thicker juices require to be treated on a larger scale than the thinner ones. It is easy to make lemon wine in a cask of two gallons; but it is a very difficult task to operate on so small a quantity of thick and sweet raisin wine. The most favourable tempe- rature for fermentation is about 54 degrees of Fahrenheit. When it languishes from cold, a portion of the fluid may be heated to a high degree of temperature, and mixed with the mass. The sweetest wines are most durable, and are improved by keeping; the thinnest and briskest ought to be drank comparatively new. Boiling the fruit tends to make the wine sweet; and white sugar should always be used in preference to brown. The introduc- tion of brandy neither prevents wine from turning sour, nor does it add to its durability, while it increases the expense, and diminishes its salubrity ; but, for those who cannot overcome their prejudice in favour of established practices, it may be observed, that brandy will be least injurious when added before the fermentation is com- pleted, in the proportion of a quart to every ten gallons. The necessity of making the vats and casks clean, re- quires to be particularly inculcated on the makers of do- mestic wines. The taste communicated by new casks is not usually thought unpleasant; where it is so, first rinsingwith hot salt-and-water, and afterwards with move hot water, will remove it. Old and musty casks should be unheaded and scraped, then cleaned as before direct- 2 c■102 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. eel, and lastly, rinsed with a portion of the fermenting liquor made boiling hot. In removing the wine from the vat to the casks, it is requisite that the vat should be tapped at such a distance from the bottom, as to allow the wine to flow clear of the sediment which may have collected at the lower part of the vessel, by which means the scum may be easily prevented from running into the receiver. If the wine is not disengaged from the solid matters, straining will be further necessary. The skins are sometimes fermented with the juice in the vat, but they must in no case be introduced into the cask. To clarify the wine completely, prepared fining* may be used, in the proportion of a wine-glassful to every five gallons of liquor; also isinglass or whites of eggs ; half an ounce of isinglass, or nine eggs, is sufficient for fifty gal- lons of wine : whichever of these is employed, it is first diluted in a portion of the wine, and then strongly agi- tated with the whole. In about ten days, when the wine has become clear, it is again drawn oft'. Instead of the common method of sulphuring, the sulphate of potash is to be preferred, which may be used in the proportion of a drachm to a pipe of liquor, or the oxymuriate of potash, which is more easily procured. Dry, cold weather ought to be selected for racking. Various kinds of wine, not to be distinguished from those of foreign growth, can in this country be made from grapes, and at a moderate expense ; their being ripe is not a necessary circumstance; they may be used in any state, however immature, the quantity of sugar being propor- tionally increased. Where the vine is largely cultivated, the thinnings may be used, as various kinds of grapes, * Sold by James Edwards, Crutched Friars, London.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 403 and of different degrees of ripeness, may be mixed to- gether. In situations where the vine may not produce even unripe fruit, the tendrils and leaves may be used, as they possess properties similar to the green fruit; the leaves of the claret vine produce wine of a delicate red colour. Yeast should never be employed in making wine from native fruits. The deficiency of tartar in them, which in the grape promotes fermentation, may be supplied by the addition of cream of tartar, or, what is still better, crude tartar. Should the fermentation be slow, or appear as if it would not occur at all, no impatience need be felt on the subject; it will not finally be less effectual, because it has been more tedious. Attention to the temperature will commonly be sufficient. The cask may also be fre- quently stirred, or the filling up of the cask omitted, so that the scum or head may be compelled to remain in the »,liquor. Gooseberry Wine to Resemble Champagne. The fruit must be selected when about full grown, but before it has shown the least tendency to ripen; those gooseberries which have the least flavour when ripe are to be preferred, and perhaps the green bath are the best; the smallest should be separated by a sieve, the unsound or bruised fruit rejected, and the remains of the blossoms and fruit-stalks rubbed oft’, or otherwise removed. For a cask of ten gallons, forty pounds of such fruit are to be put into a tub that has been carefully cleaned, and that will hold fifteen or twenty gallons; it is to be bruised inTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY-. 401 successive proportions, by a pressure sufficient to burst the berries, without breaking the seeds, or materially com- pressing the skins. Four gallons of water are then to be poured into the vessel, and the contents are to be care- fully stirred, and squeezed in the hand, until the whole of the juice and pulp are separated from the seeds and skins; the materials are then to remain at rest from six to twenty-four hours, when they are to be strained through a coarse bag by as much force as can conveniently be applied to them; one gallon of fresh water may after- wards be passed through the mash. Thirty pounds of loaf sugar are now to be dissolved in the juice thus procured, and water added, to make the whole eleven gallons in quantity; this, together with three ounces of tartar in its crude state, being put into a tub, a blanket is thrown over it, which is again covered with a board, and the vessel placed in a temperature vary- ing from 55° to 60° of Fahrenheit; here it may remain for twenty-four hours, or two days, as the fermentation may be more or less rapid ; from this tub it is to be drawn off into tbe cask in which it is to ferment, and as the fer- mentation proceeds, the superfluous portion of juice made for the purpose, must be poured in, so as to keep the liquor still near the bung-hole for ten or twelve days, or until the fermentation becomes a. little languid, as may be known by the diminution of the hissing noise'; the bung is to be driven in, and a hole bored by its side, into which a wooden peg is to be fitted ; it may be loosened every two or three days, for the space of eight or ten days, to give the air vent, so as to prevent the cask from bursting. When there appears no longer any danger, the spike may be per- manently tightened. The wine thus made may remain over the winter in a cool cellar. If the operator is not inclined to bestow any farther labour or expense upon it, it may be exa- mined in some clear cold day towards the end of Fe- bruary or beginning of March, when, if fine, as it will sometimes be, it may be bottled without farther precau- tion. To insure its fineness, however, it is a better prac-405 the practice of cookery. tice to rack it, towards the end of December, into a fresh cask, so as to clear it from its first lees ; or should it then prove too sweet, instead of racking it, the fermentation may be renewed, by stirring up the lees, or by rolling the cask. At whatever time it is racked, it should be fined in the usual way with isinglass. Sometimes it is found expedient to rack it a second time, and to repeat the fining; and in any case, bottle it during the month of March. If it is wished to have a very sweet wine, as well as a brisk wine, the quantity of sugar may be increased to forty pounds, and to insure briskness, without excessive sweet- ness, the proportion of fruit may be fifty pounds when the sugar is thirty. If there should appear any danger of the sweetness vanishing altogether from wine thus formed, the fermentation may be checked by racking and fining, same when it will be speedily fit for use. Wine from Unripe Currants. This fruit is perhaps better calculated for brisk wines than the gooseberry ; greater care must be taken in se- parating the stalks, but otherwise the mash is more easily managed. By working the juice and solid matter toge- ther in the vat along with the sugar, the wine will prove stronger, and less sweet, but it will acquire more flavour. When the skins are not to be fermented with the liquid, it may be introduced at once into the cask, without being previously fermented in the vat, and in all cases strained before it is put into the cask. The same proportions are allowed for this wine as for gooseberry wine, and the same rules may be followed. Sweet Wine from Ripe Currants. Tiie fruit is gathered when quite ripe, nnd the stalks being carefully picked out, it is bruised in the hands, and then strained through a canvass bag ; to a ten-gallon cask, forty pounds of fruit, thirty of sugar, and a quarter of a pound of tartar are allowed ; the material having remain- ed some hours in the tub in which it was mixed, it is re*THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 406 moved to the cask, the bung-hole covered with a tile, and the cask is stirred every other day, for ten days, and filled up every day as the fluid wastes. The fermentation may con- tinue from three to six weeks; when it has subsided, the wine is racked into a cask in which matches, dipped in sul- phur, have been burned, or in which a little of the sul- phate of potash, or of oxymuriate of potash, has been put. It should be again racked and fined in March, when the wine is completed, and may be bottled, or allowed to re- main in the cask. Ripe Gooseberry Wine May be made by the same rule, excluding carefully from it all the husks. Black Currant Wine. The same varieties of proportions are allowed in this as in the others already mentioned. The fruit being pick- ed, it is brought to the boiling point in as much water as to avoid any risk of burning; it may then be strained and put into the cask, or the liquid and skins may, with the other ingredients, be first fermented in the vat or tub, by which the wine will acquire a higher colour and flavour. Strawberries and Raspberries. From either of these fruits agreeable wine may be ob- tained, by following the rules given for making currant wine ; but it will be found a cheaper and a better method, to add a little sirup or juice of the fruit to any flavour- less currant wine ; when the fermentation begins to de- cline, currant wine may also be flavoured with odoriferous flowers, such as cowslip, elder, or mignionette. The qua- lity of roughness is communicated by catechu and keno, chips of oak and of beech, and also the sloe; a small quantity of these, or of the flowers, is put into the cask when the first fermentation is over, and as soon as the wine has acquired the desired flavour, it is racked and fined. The flavouring articles, such as orris-root, cloves, ginger, sweet and bitter almonds, are put into a muslin407 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. bag, and hung in the cask for a few days, during the stage of insensible fermentation, that is, after the first fermenta- tion has ceased ; care being taken to taste the liquor fre- quently, so that the flavouring matter may be withdrawn as soon as it has produced the desired effect. Elderberries Can be made to produce excellent wine, allowing to a ten-gallon cask forty pounds of fruit, forty pounds of su- gar, and a quarter of a pound of tartar. When elderberry wine is desired for a warm cordial, it is made in the follow- ing manner:—Twenty-five pounds of fruit are to be boiled for an hour, in eleven gallons of water, and along with it, tied in a piece of linen, one ounce of allspice, and two of ginger; forty pounds of sugar being put into a tub, the boil- ing liquor is strained over it, pressing the fruit quite dry; a quarter of a pound of crude tartar, or cream of tartar, is then added to the liquid. When it has stood two days in the tub, it may be removed to the cask, treated, as for sweet wine, in the usual manner, and bottled in March following. When to be drank, a portion of it is heated with some sugar, two or three cloves, and a little nutmeg. Wine from Mixed Fruit. * The three varieties of currant may be used in the largest proportion, and being nicely picked from the stalks, they are allowed just to boil in as much water as to pre- vent their burning; of raspberries, strawberries, and cher- ries, black-heart are the best, equal quantities may ho allowed ; they are masked with a little water; goose- berries may be used to advantage, but must be prepared separately by more powerful bruising, in an equal quan- tityof water,and straining through a canvass bag,theother fruits being also strained ; to each gallon of juice thus ob- tained, four pounds of loaf sugar, and half an ounce of crude tartar, are allowed; when the material has stood some hours in the tub in which it was mixed, it is removed to the cask, and managed as currant wine.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 408 Wine from Unripe Grapes. The proportions and treatment are exactly the same as those laid down for the gooseberry, only that the husks may always be fermented in the vat with the fluid, and also the stems when young; with the exception of the seeds, there is no objection to bruising the solid matters. Wine from Vine Leaves. The leaves are best when young; at farthest they should not be full grown, and must be plucked with their stems ; the tendrils are equally useful; they may be taken from vines from which no fruit is expected, or from the sum- mer prunings; when tainted with soot, they must be carefully washed. Forty or fifty pounds of such leaves being put into a tub, seven or eight gallons of boiling wa- ter are to be poured on them, in which they are to infuse for twenty-four hours; the liquor being poured off, the leaves must be pressed in a press of considerable power, and being then washed with an additional gallon of wa- ter, they are again to be pressed. Thirty pounds of sugar, and a quarter of a pound of tartar, are now to be added to the mixed liquor, and the quantity being made up to se- ven gallons, the process recommended in the case of gooseberries is to be followed ; or that for ripe currants, if a sweet wine is desired. Kaisin Wine. To every gallon of water, eight pounds of good raisins, and half an ounce of tartar are allowed ; the raisins being picked, they are to be put, together with the tartar, into a tub, which should be covered ; the mash must be stir- red every day till the sweetness has gone off, and the fruit lias fallen a little, which may be in a month or six weeks ; it is then to be strained, the raisins pressed to dryness, and the liquid put into the cask no filling up is neces- sary, and the bung-hole is only to be so covered as to keep out the dust. "When the Avine has given over hissing, it i* to be bunged down till the spring, when it is to be care-409 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. fully fined and racked into a sulphured cask, and bottled, after being once more carefully fined. Another way to make Raisin Wine. For a ten-gallon cask, fifty pounds of Malaga, and twenty-five of Smyrna raisins, ten pounds of loaf sugar, and a quarter of a pound of crude tartar are allowed. The raisins being separated from each other, and the strong stalks picked out, they are to be put, together with the other ingredients, into a vat, and thirteen gallons of cold spring water is to be poured over them ; the whole is then to be well stirred, and the vat covered ; it must be stirred twice a-day during the first fortnight, and afterwards once a-day. When the fermentation has become very strong, and the liquor acquires a vinous smell and taste, which may be in three or four weeks, it is to be prepared for the cask in the following manner:—A sieve or a drainer, such as is used for sowens in Scotland, is to be put over a tub ; in this the raisins are to be squeezed very hard with the hand ; all the liquor is then to be run through a hair sieve, and put into the cask, and the remainder into bottles, from which the cask must be filled up twice a-day for a week, then once a-day, and less frequently as the fermentation begins to decline ; when it is completed, the cask is to be bunged up, and allowed to stand for four months. Ex- cellent vinegar may be made from the refuse. Another way to make Raisin Wine. To twenty-eight gallons of water, one hundred and twelve pounds of Malaga, and twenty-eight pounds of Smyrna raisins are allowed ; the stalks being picked out, they are to be chopped very small, and with the water, and one pound of crude tartar, put into a tub, in which they are allowed to remain for a fortnight. The raisins are then to be squeezed to dryness, and the liquor strained, put into a cask, and treated as wine from ripe currants. Orange Wine. For a ten-gallon cask, ninety bitter oranges are to beTIIE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 410 pared very thin, and the juice squeezed from them, which, with six gallons of water and twenty-eight pounds of su- gar, is put into the cask; half the peel may be steeped in two gallons of water for twelve hours, and the water poured into the cask ; they are again to be steeped in the remaining quantity of water with which the cask is to be filled up ; it must be stirred every day till the sugar is dissolved, and bunged up when the fermentation ceases. In two months it may be racked and fined, and in three months more bottled. Those who think brandy necessary, may add a bottle at the end of the first two months. The wine will be more generally agreeable if the peel be altogether omitted. Lemon Wine. To every gallon of water, four pounds of sugar, and the juice of ten lemons, are allowed ; the lemons are to be pared very thin, and half the peel being put into a tub, the sugar and water are boiled and poured over it; when cold, the juice is added ; if the fermentation does not be- gin in the course of a few days, it is to be promoted by the addition of a toast of bread covered with yeast; the peel is then taken out, and the liquor put into the cask, which must be bunged up when the fermentation ceases. In this, as in orange wine, the peel may be omitted. Malt Wine. Thirty pounds of sugar are to be boiled half an houv with ten gallons of water, and well skimmed ; when milk- warm, five gallons of new ale, from the vat, is added to it, and it is allowed to ferment two days in a tub ; it is then put into the cask, with one pound of sugar-candy pounded, and four pounds of raisins of the sun chopped. When the fermentation ceases, it is racked and fined. It may be bottled at the end of six or twelve months. Parsnip Wine. To five gallons of water, eight pounds of parsnips, andTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 41 1 fifteen pounds of sugar, are allowed ; the parsnips, being well cleaned, and cut into slices, are to be boiled in the whole or in a portion of the water ; when quite soft, they are to be taken out and mashed, then returned to the wa- ter they were boiled in, and being well stirred, are put through a hair sieve ; the sugar is then to be added to the strained liquor, and the quantity made up with boiled wa- ter ; when nearly cold, it is to be put into the cask with two spoonfuls of yeast, and three ounces of crude tartar, and stirred every day till the fermentation subsides, which may be in ten days or a fortnight; it is then bunged up, and may be racked and fined iu three or six months, and bottled iu six months more. Birch Wine. To every gallon of juice from the birch tree, three pounds of sugar, one pound of raisins, half an ounce of crude tartar, and one ounce of almonds, are allowed ; the juice, sugar, and raisins, are to be boiled twenty minutes, and then put into a tub, together with the tartar; and when it has fermented some days, it is to be strained, and put into the cask, and also the almonds, which must be tied in a muslin bag. The fermentation having ceased, the almonds are to be withdrawn, and the cask bunged up, to stand about five months, when it may be fiued and bottled. Ginger Wine. To eight gallons of water, twelve pounds of sugar, three pounds of bitter oranges, five pounds of lemons, and thirteen ounces of ginger are allowed; the sugar and the ginger, bruised, are to be boiled with the water half an hour, and allowed to stand till next day; the fruit is to be pared very thin, and the strained juice, and half the peel, put into a cask with two gallons and a half of good whisky, or other spirit; when it has stood a night, the clear part of the boiled liquid is to be poured over it, the sediment being kept back; it does not ferment, and there- fore it is not necessary that the cask should be full; it isTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 412 immediately bunged up, and in a fortnight it must be fined, and in another fortnight it may he bottled. To improve the colour, a table-spoonful of burned sugar maybe added when the cask is filled up, first diluting it with a portion of the liquor. Another way to make Ginger Wine. Sixteen pounds of brown sugar, and the well-beaten whites of six eggs, are to be stirred into six gallons of water, and put on the fire to boil; the scum having well risen, it is to be taken clear off, and six ounces of the best white ginger, cut small, is to be added ; it is then to be boiled for three quarters of an hour, and well scummed ; when it has become milk-warm, it is to be put into a wooden vessel, together with a tea-cupful of fresh yeast, and also the juice of six lemons, and the same of Seville oranges, made into a sirup. When it has fermented for three days, it is to be put into the cask, witli two bottles of brandy or four of whisky ; the fermentation being over, it is bunged up, but not very tight at first. It may be fined in eight or ten weeks, and bottled, or allowed to stand in the cask nine or ten months. Another way to make Ginger Wine. For a ten-gallon cask three gallons of spirits, whisky or rum, one gallon of the juice of Seville oranges, half a gallon of lemon juice, twenty pounds of loaf sugar, one pound and a half of best white ginger bruised, and half an ounce of isinglass, are allowed; the cask is to be filled up with cold boiled water, and in six weeks it may be bottled. Another way to make Ginger Wine. To ten gallons of water, fourteen pounds of brown sugar, a pound and a half of ginger, three gallons of whisky, the juice of three dozen lemons, and three dozen bitter oranges, and six rinds of each fruit, are allowed; the sugar and water is to be boiled, stirring it frequently, and skimming it,; the ginger is to be boiled separately* in aTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 413 small quantity of water, anil strained ; the rinds are to be steeped in the spirits all night, and the boiled liquid being cold, the whole is to be put into the cask, together with two drops of isinglass. In six weeks it may be bottled. Vinous Mead. To one gallon of water allow three pounds of honey; boil the mixture for a quarter of an hour ; skim it, and when nearly cold, pour it gently into a cask, in which crude tartar has been put in the proportion of an ounce to the gallon. As the fermentation may be long continued, a large portion of the liquid must be reserved for filling up the cask; it is put into bottles, which are closed with muslin or coarse linen. To excite fermentation, expose the cask to the influence of the sun, or put it into the corner of a chimney in which a constant fire is kept. In about seven or eight days, the liquor emits a thick and dirty froth ; the barrel must then be filled up from the bottles, and when the fermentation ceases, the cask must be bunged up and placed in the cellar. It may be bottled in twelve months. It is sometimes flavoured with flowers, or with the juice of fruits. Another way to make Mead. For a ten-gallon cask allow twenty pounds of honey, and fourteen gallons of water; boil and skim it; then add one ounce of cinnamon, one ounce of cardamoms, one and a half ounce of Jamaica pepper, two ounces of ginger, a quarter of an ounce of coriander seed, two large pieces of orris-root, and a few shavings of isinglass; boil these ingredients for about half an hour, and when the mixture has cooled, stir in a wine-glassful of yeast; next day pour it through a cloth into the cask, and allow it to ferment for about ten days; in a fortnight more it may bo bottled, and the corks sealed. A variety of this mead may be made by adding a gallon of cranberry juice toTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 414 the boiled boney and water, and substituting two ounces of cloves for the coriander and the cardamom seeds. Simple Mead. One part of boney is dissolved in three parts of water, and boiled over a moderate fire till it is reduced to two- thirds of the quantity. It is then skimmed, and put into a barrel, which must be quite full; it is allowed to subside for three or four days, and then drawn off for use. To make it from the combs from which honey has been drained, they are to be beaten in warm water, and after the liquor has subsided, it is to be strained. The cottagers in Scotland make an excellent beer by adding a little yeast to the strained liquor, and allowing it to ferment, for a few days, in a cask, and then bottling it. Orgeat. A quarter of a pound of sweet, and one ounce and a half of bitter almonds, are to be blanched, and thrown into cold water, then beaten in a marble mortar, and moisten- ed occasionally with a spoonful of milk, to prevent their oiling ; three pints of milk are then to be mixed gradu- ally with them, and after being sweetened, boiled, stirred till cold, and strained, a glass of wine or brandy is to be added. Another way to make Orgeat. One pound of Jordan almonds are to be finely pounded, together with a little orange-flower water; two quarts of spring water being added by degrees, it is to be sweet- ened with double-refined sugar, strained through a nap- kin, and put into quart bottles, which should be iced. It must be made the day on which it is to be used. Cherry Brandy. The proportions are three quarts of the best brandy, six pounds of morella cherries, and a pound and a half of finely-pounded white or brown sugar-candy; the cherriesTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 115 ami sugar are to be put in layers into a large-mouthed bottle or jar, which, when nearly full, is to be filled up with brandy, and closely corked. Another way to make Cherry Brandy. Twelve pounds of morella, and six pounds of common cherries, are to be baked, the juice pressed out, and the stones pounded in a marble mortar; the whole to be again mixed and sweetened with two pounds of sugar-candy, six quarts of brandy being added, which, with the fruit, will make three gallons; it is to be put into a large glass bottle, and shaken frequently in the course of three months. After which, it may be strained through a jelly- bag, and bottled for use. Brandy Cherries. The stalks are to be cut short, the cherries pricked with a needle, and some sugar strewed over them. A sufficient quantity of sirup to cover them being made, they are to be scalded in it on the fire, and put away til 1 next day, when they are again to be scalded, and put in- to a jar ; the sirup is then to be boiled till very thick, and if the quantity is not sufficient, more sugar may be added; when boiled enough, it is to be poured into the jar, with an equal quantity of brandy. Shrub. One measure of lemon juice is allowed to five of rum, and to every gallon of the mixture, six pounds of loaf su- gar, which is to be melted in water, and the whole strain- ed through flannel. Another way to make Shrub. To one part of lemon juice, three of Seville orange are allowed, and to every pint of juice, a pound and a half of very finely-pounded loaf sugar; these being well mix- ed, it is put into a cask, and one quart of the best rum added to each pint of the juice ; the whole to be shaken three times a-day for a fortnight, or longer, if the cask be416 THE PRACTICE OF COOK.ERY. large. It is then allowed to stand to fine for a month, or till it be sufficiently clear to bottle. The dregs may be made into excellent milk punch, by pouring warm, but not boiling, milk on them, allowing three parts of milk to one of dregs; after being well mixed, it is allowed to stand for three days, when the clear part may be drawn off, and the thick run through a jelly- bag. Lemon or Orange Slirub. The rind of the lemons or oranges being grated off, they are to be squeezed, and two pounds of finely-pound- ed loaf sugar is to be added to every pint of the strained juice; when the sugar is quite dissolved, two pints of rum are allowed to every pint of sirup; the whole is to be well mixed in a cask, and allowed to stand five or six weeks, and then drawn off. White Currant Shrub. The currants are to be bruised and put into a bag to drip; three quarters of a pound of loaf sugar is to be dis- solved in two quarts of juice, and a quart of rum be- ing added, it is to be bottled for use. Lemon Brandy. Three quarts of brandy being put into an earthen jar that is fitted with a cover, a pound and three quarters of fine loaf sugar, the thin parings of six lemons, and the juice of twelve, are to be added ; one quart of boiling milk is to be poured over the mixture, which must be stirred daily for eight days ; it is then to be run through a jelly-bag and bottled. Lemonade. Eight lemons and eighty-four Seville oranges being selected, the two clearest lemons are to be rubbed over with loaf sugar, and the rinds scraped off into a gallon of spring water; the fruit is then to be squeezed into a sieve placed over the vessel containing the water, the417 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. liquid sweetened witli double-refined sugar, and run through a jelly-bag. It is then to be putj into bottles, which may be cooled, by laying ice on the necks. Transparent Lemonade. The peel of fourteen lemons having been soaked in two quarts of water for two hours, their juice, one pound and a half of sugar, and a quart of white wine, are to be added; a quart of new milk, made boiling hot, is then to be mixed with it, and when it has stood an hour, it is to be strained through a jelly-bag till it runs clear. A Receipt for Juice. The proportion of oranges should be double that of lemons; the fruit being selected free from decay, and wiped dry, they are to be squeezed, and the juice strain- ed through a sieve into an earthen pan ; to each pint, ac- cording to the acidity of the fruit, a pound and a half, or a pound and three quarters, of double-refined sugar, broken small, is to be added. It must be stirred and skimmed daily, till the sugar is well incorporated, or as long as the scum rises; and when it has been a month in the pan, it may be bottled. The Duke of Norfolk’s Punch. The thin parings of six lemons, and of six oranges, are to be steeped in a gallon of brandy for twenty-four hours, the vessel containing it being closely covered; three pounds of single-refined sugar are to be clarified •with the white of an egg, in a gallon of spring water, and boiled for a quarter of an hour, skimmed, and allowed to stand till cold. The brandy is then to be strained from the parings, and with the strained juice of eighteen oranges and eighteen lemons, added to the boiled sirup, and put into a vessel sufficiently large to contain the whole. It must be closely covered, and when it has stood six weeks, it may be bottled. 2dTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 418 Milk Punch. The rinds of nine lemons are to be steeped, for eight- een hours, in two quarts of brandy, then mixed with the strained juice of the lemons, one and a half pound of su- gar, five pints of water, and one grated nutmeg; one quart of new milk, made boiling hot, being added, it is to be strained through a jelly-bag. Another way to make Milk Punch. In twenty quarts of brandy, the peel of thirty Seville oranges, and thirty-six lemons, are to be infused for twelve hours; thirty quarts of water and fifteen pounds of double-refined sugar are to be boiled, and when cold, the strained juice of the oranges and lemons is to be added to it; it is then to be put into a cask, together with the brandy, strained from the peel; a quart of boil- ing milk being poured into the cask, it is to be bunged up, and allowed to stand till it become fine before being bottled. It will be the better for remaining a year in the cask. Another way to make Milk Punch. Eight pounds of refined sugar are to be dissolved in the strained juice of three dozen lemons, and, when quite settled, two gallons of brandy, and two gallons and a half of cold water, are to be added, and also the lemon peel; one gallon of boiling milk being then poured over the in- gredients, they are to stand closely covered for twenty- four hours; when, being skimmed and run through a very thick jelly-bag, it may be quickly bottled, and will be fit for immediate use; but it improves by keeping. Ratafia. One gallon of brandy, three hundred kernels of apri- cots, the juice and very thin parings of eight lemons, and half an ounce of saffron; when these ingredients have, stood a fortnight, they are to be strained, and one pound419 THE PRACTICE Ol-' COOKERY. of white sugar-candy, dissolved in half a pint of water, added to the liquor. Another way to make Ratafia. Five hundred peach kernels are to be steeped in one gallon of pale brandy, together with two quarts of Fron- tignac, one pint of orange-flower water, and one pound and three quarters of double-refined sugar. It must be shaken daily for six weeks, and then put through a jelly-bag till clear. Orange Liquor. To eacli orange, one quart of strong spirits, and one pound and a quarter of loaf sugar are allowed; six or eight cloves are to be stuck into each orange, which, with the spirits and sugar, is to be put into a jar. It must be closely covered, and stirred occasionally in the course of two months; it is then to be filtered through blotting paper, and bottled for use. Lemon liqueur is made in the same way, substituting lemons for oranges. Instead of mixing the sugar with the other materials in the jar, it may be made into a sirup, and added to the strained or filtered spirits. This, though more troublesome, will be found a better method. Noyau. The rinds of three large lemons, half a pound of pound- ed loaf sugar, one ounce of bitter almonds, blanched and pounded, are to be mixed into a quart of the best Hol- lands, three table-spoonfuls of boiling milk being added. It is to be put into a bottle or jar, and shaken every day for three weeks, and then filtered through chamois lea- ther or blotting paper, when it will be fit for use. Another way to make Noyau. Peaches and nectarines, in equal quantities, are to be bruised, the stones broken, and the kernels blanched and bruised ; they are then to be put into a jar in layers, one of fruit, one of kernels, and one of pounded loaf sugar,420 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. and so on until the jar is full; as much white brandy is then to be added as the jar will hold ; and when it has stood for five or six months, it is to be filtered and bottled for use. Another way to make Noyau. One pound of bitter almonds, blanched, is to be steep- ed three months in four quarts of large-still proof whisky, or pale brandy; four pounds of loaf sugar are then to be clarified and added to the strained or filtered spirits, to- gether with half a pint of pure honey. It is sometimes coloured with a little cochineal; and may also be made, allowing three parts of sweet, and one of bitter almonds. Capillaire. The best capillaire is that of North America. Put one ounce of it into a small quantity of boiling water, to in- fuse like tea; add a pound of sugar to the infusion ; cla- rify it with the white of an egg, and boil it to a thick si- rup ; strain it through a cloth, and when cold, put in a little orange-flower water, and bottle it. That which is commonly sold as capillaire in England, is simply sirup flavoured with orange-flower water. Hawthorn Liqueur. The full blossoms of the white thorn are to be picked dry and clean from the leaves and stalks, and as much put into a large bottle as it will hold lightly without press- ing it down; it is then to be filled up with French bran- dy, and allowed to stand two or three months, when it must be decanted off, and sweetened with clarified susrar, or with capillaire. Without the sweetening, it is an ex- cellent seasoning for puddings and custards. Caledonian Liqueur. An ounce of oil of cinnamon is to be dropped on two pounds and a half of bruised loaf sugar; one gallon of theTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 421 best whisky being added, and the sugar being dissolved, it is to be filtered and bottled. Imperial. To one ounce of cream of tartar, two ounces of ginger, one lemon cut into slices, and two pounds of loaf sugar, two gallons of boiling water are added; when almost cold, two table-spoonfuls of yeast are stirred in. It may be bot- tled next day, and will be fit for drinking the day after it is bottled. Another way to make Imperial. Two ounces of cream of tartar, the juice and parings Of two lemons, and a few cloves, are put into a jar, and six quarts of boiling water added; it is sweetened with loaf sugar, covered, and allowed to stand till the follow- ing day, when a quart of rum is added ; it is then strain- ed, bottled, and tightly corked. Bishop. Roast four good-sized bitter oranges till they are of a pale brown colour; lay them in a tureen, and put over them half a pound of pounded loaf sugar, and three glass- es of claret; place the cover on the tureen, and let it stand till next day. When required for use, put the tureen into a pan of boiling water, press the oranges with a spoon, and run the juice through a sieve ; then boil the remainder of the bottle of claret, taking care that it do not burn; add it to the strained juice, and serve it warm in glasses. Turkish Sherbet. Wash a small fore-quarter of veal, put it on the fire with nine pints of water; skim it well, and let it boil till reduced to two pints; run it through a sieve, and when cold, add to it a pint and a half of clear lemon juice, and two pounds of loaf sugar which has been made into a si- rup with a pint and a half of water, and cleared with the white of an egg. It is served in glass mugs, for a dessert table, or offered at any other time as a refreshment.422 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Balm Beer. Eleven gallons of water and ten pounds of brown sugar are to be clarified with the whites of twelve eggs, carefully skimmed, and boiled till nearly reduced to ten gallons; two pounds and a half of the yellow flower of lemon balm being put into a cask, the liquor, when milk- warm, is to be poured over it, and four or five table-spoon- fuls of thick yeast added. The cask must be filled up morning and evening with what works over it, and bung- ed up when the fermentation ceases; in a month the beer may be bottled, and in trvo or three months it will be fit for drinking. Half the quantity of the flower of lemon balm will probably be found to communicate a flavour suf- ficiently strong, if added when the fermentation is nearly over. Soda Water. Tartaric acid, half an ounce, arated soda, half an ounce. Have two tumblers about one-third full of wa- ter, put a tea-spoonful of the soda into one glass, and the same of the acid into the other; when dissolved, mix them together, and drink it immediately. The two sorts of salts must be kept in separate bot- tles, and should be bought ready powdered. Spruce Beer. When ten gallons of water, six pounds of treacle, and three ounces of bruised ginger have boiled together for half an hour, two pounds of the outer sprigs of the spruce fir are to be added, and boiled for five minutes ; the wlmle is then to be strained through a hair sieve, and when milk-warm, put into the cask, and a tea-cupful of good yeast stirred well into it. When it has fermented a day or two it is to be bunged up, and the following day bot- tled. It will be fit for use in a week. The ginger is sometimes omitted, and instead of the spruce fir, three ounces of the essence may be used, which is to be well whisked, together with the treacle,THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 423 and a gallon or two of warm water; then put into the cask, which is to be filled up with water, and the yeast added. Another way to make Spruce Beer. The proportions are ten gallons of water, three quarts of treacle, a tea-cupful of ginger, the same of allspice, three ounces of hops, three ounces and a half of the es- sence of spruce, and half a pint of good yeast. The hops, ginger, and allspice, must be boiled together till the hops fall to the bottom ; the treacle and spruce are then to be dissolved in a bucket- full of the liquor, the whole strained into a cask, and the yeast well stirred in ; when the fer- mentation ceases, the cask is to be bunged up. Ginger Beer. For a ten-gallon cask, eleven gallons of water, four- teen pounds of sugar, the juice of eighteen lemons, and one pound of ginger are allowed ; the sugar and water are boiled with the whites of eight eggs, and well skimmed; just before coming to the boiling point, the ginger, which must be bruised, is then added, and boiled for twenty minutes; when cold, the clear part is put into the cask, together with tiie lemon juice and two spoonfuls of yeast; when it has fermented for three or four days, it is fined, bunged up, and in a fortnight bottled. It may be made without the fruit. Another Ginger Beer Quickly Made. A gallon of boiling water is poured over three quar- ters of a pound of loaf sugar, one ounce and a quarter of sliced ginger, and the peel of one lemon ; when milk- warm, the juice of the lemon and a spoonful of yeast are added. It should be made in the evening, and bottled next morning in half-pint stone bottles, and the cork tied down with twine.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 424 CHAPTER XIX. MISCELLANY. Permanent Ink. Rub down, in a 6mail mortar, five scruples of lunar caustic, with one drachm of gumarabic, one scruple of sap green, and one ounce of rain water. Liquid Pounce. One ounce of sal-soda is to be mixed with two ounces of boiling water, and a little gumarabic; shake the bottle, wet the linen with the mixture, dry and iron it before using the ink, and again put the iron on it after it is marked. Almond Paste. Pound and mix thoroughly the following ingredients : one pound of raisins stoned; two pounds of bitter almonds blanched ; sixpence-worth of camphor ; a wine-glass of brandy; one of honey; two beaten eggs, and a little fine sand sifted. Another way to make Almond Paste. Finely pound, and well mix, with a sufficient quan- tity of orange-flower or rose water, half a pound of bit-THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 425 ter, one pound of sweet almonds blanched, and one pound of honey; put into small pots, and pour over a little orange- flower or rose water; tie them over closely with paper. Lavender Water. Put into a large bottle, eight ounces of the best recti- fied spirits of wine, three drachms of oil of lavender, one drachm of essence of ambergris, and threepence-worth of musk ; cork it tightly, and shake it well every day, for a fortnight or three weeks. To make Ink. To four ounces of bruised galls, allow two of copperas, and two of gumarabic; put the galls into a large bottle, with three pints of rain-water, and in three or four days dissolve the gum in hot water, and add it with the cop- peras ; shake the bottle frequently for some days. A few cloves may be put into the bottle to prevent the ink from moulding. To take out Iron Moulds. Pound two ounces of cream of tartar, and mix tho- roughly with it one ounce of salt of sorrel; keep it in a bottle closely corked. Fill a metal water-plate with boil- ing water; wet the iron mould; place it upon the plate, and rub it with a little of the powder till it disappears; then rime it in water. Or mix in a tea-cup one tea-spoon- ful of oil of vitriol, and two of common salt; place it in warm ashes ; hold the stained part over it, and the stain will soon disappear; then wash the part in cold water. Neats’ Foot Oil. Boil the feet for several hours, as for making stock for jelly; skim off the oily matter from time to time as it rises, and when it ceases to come up, pour oft the water ; next day take off the cake of fat and oil which will be found on the top ; boil it and the oil before obtained, to- gether with a little cold water ; let it cool; pour off the water, and bottle the oil for use. This oil being perfect-THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 426 ly pure, and free from smell, may be used with the French lights in a sick room. To Discharge all Stains which are not Metallic. Mix two tea-spoonfuls of water with one of spirit of salt; let the stain lie in it for one or two minutes ; then rinse the article in cold water. This will be found par- ticularly useful in removing stains from white doilys. To Wash Paint. Brush off the dust with a small long-haired brush ; mix finely-powdered whitening and bullock’s gall, till of the consistence of a batter ; with a flannel, rub it on the walls up and down, and then wash it off with a clean flannel and plenty of cold water, and when nearly dry, rub it hard with a clean linen cloth ; the unpleasant smell from the gall will go off almost immediately. If the paint is not very much soiled, it may be washed merely with the whitening mixed with cold water, first wetting below the hand. To Wash Imitation Wainscot. Wash first with cold water and a clean flannel, and then with sour porter ; after which it is not to be wiped. Or wash with whitening mixed with cold water; wash off with clean water ; dry it well, and then rub hard with linseed oil. To Clean Papered Rooms. Blow off the dust with a pair of bellows ; cut the up- per crust off a stale loaf of bread; hold the crust in the hand, and rub gently downwards, about half a yard at each stroke. The next time of going round, commence a little above where the last stroke ended, and take care not to cross the paper, or go up again. The process may be repeated ; and, if carefully done, the paper will look near- ly as well as new.THE PRACTICE OE COOKERY. 427 To Clean Polished Grates and Irons. Make into a paste, witli cold water, four pounds of putty-powder, ami one of finely-powdered whitening; dip a duster into the mixture ; rub oft’ carefully all the spots, and with a well-aired clean duster, rub the grate or irons one way till bright and clear. Plain dry whitening will keep it highly polished if well attended to every day. The putty-mixture should be used only to remove spots. To remove rust from the poker, tongs, and shovel, boil one pound of middling-sized emery-powder with half a pound of soft soap, till it is as thick as paste; when cold, nib the irons with it; rub it oft' with a dry cloth, and polish with finely powdered and sifted brick dust, or whitening. To keep steel grates, fenders, and tire-irons from rust- ing, rub them over with fresh mutton suet, melted, and then dust them with unslaked lime, tied up in a bit of coarse muslin. To Clean Brass and Copper. Rub it over slightly with a bit of flannel dipped in sweet oil; next, rub it hard with another bit dipped in finely- powdered rotten stone ; then make it clean with a soft linen cloth, and finish by polishing it with a plate-leather. Another way to Clean Brass and Copper. Put one penny-worth of powdered rotten stone into a dry clean quart bottle ; nearly fill it up with cold soft water ; shake it well, and add one penny-worth of vitriol. Rub it on with a rag, and dry it with a clean soft cloth, and then polish it with a plate-leather. This mixture will keep for a long time, and becomes better the longer it is kept. But the first method gives the most lasting polish, as well as the finest colour. For Scouring Floors. Dry some fuller’s earth, and with boiling water make it into a thick paste ; mix it with one-third of its quan- tity of very fine sand, sifted ; sprinkle this mixture overTI1E PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 428 the floor, and with a scrubbing-brush and cold water, scrub the boards up and down, but not across, and finish by scrubbing with plenty of cold water. Very fine sand and cold water may be used in general; and to extract grease, mix some pearl-ashes in hot wrater, and use it with fine sand. Equal proportions of spirits of salt, and of vi- negar mixed, will extract all stains out of floors. To Wash Stone Stairs and Halls. Wash them first with hot water and a clean flannel, and then wash them over with pipe-clay mixed in water. When dry, rub them with a coarse flannel. To take Oil and Grease out of Floors and Stone Halls. Make a strong infusion of potash with boiling water ; add to it as much quick-lime as will make it of the con- sistence of thick cream ; let it stand a night, then pour oft' the clear part, which is to be bottled for use. When wanted, warm a little of it; pour it upon the spots, and after it has been on them for a few7 minutes, scour it off with warm water and soap, as it is apt to discolour the boards when left too long on them. When put upon stone, it is best to let it remain all night; and if the stain be a very bad one, a little powrdered hot lime may be put upon it before the infusion is poured on. To Clean Floor Cloths. Sw7eep them clean, and wash off any dirty spots with a spunge and cold w^ater, then rub them with a coarse flan- nel, and polish with a clean one. To Prevent Creaking Hinges. Rub them with soft soap, or a feather dipped in sweet oil. To Destroy Bugs. Mix one ounce of corrosive sublimate with a pint of spirits of wflne; shake it wrell, and, with a feather, rub it429 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. over the joints and posts of the bedstead. Repeat the ap- plication if the first is not successful. Or well wash with a strong infusion of tobacco leaves, steeped in boiling water. i To Sweep Carpets. Sprinkle tea-leaves over them, and sweep them with a hair broom ; a whisk should very seldom be used ; and fine carpets should be done with a clothes brush. Dry snow is preferable to tea-leaves, and should be used in the same way. To Wash and Clean a Carpet. Shake and beat it well; lay it upon the floor, and tack it firmly ; then with a clean flannel wash it over with one quart of bullock’s gall, mixed with three quarts of soft cold wafter, and rub it off with a clean flannel or house cloth. Any particularly dirty spot should be rubbed with pure gall. To take Stains out of Marble Chimney-Pieces and Hearths. Mix, with one quart of strong soap-lees, one pound of pearl-ashes, and as much fine whitening as will make it into a paste ; lay this all over the marble, and let it re- main for some weeks ; then wash it off with a flannel and cold water, and soap. Polish it with a dry flannel. To Clean Feathers. Allow to every gallon of water, half a pound of quick lime ; stir the mixture well, and let it stand a night; then pour off for use the lime water that is perfectly clear; put the feathers to be cleaned into a deep tub, and pour as much lime water on them .as will cover them ; stir them well with a stick, and let them stand two or three days, stirring them frequently ; then put them into a bag, and wash them thoroughly in cold water; then turn them out on sieves, and wring the water from them by squeezing them in small portions with the hands ; after which, they430 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. may be separated, the hard quills picked out, and the down stripped from the large feathers. When they are thus carefully cleaned, lay them on a floor where air can be freely admitted ; turn and shake them frequently, and when dry, put them into bags, and beat them on a knock- ing-stone with a knocker. To Wash Silk Stockings, White and Black. Cut in thin bits some white soap, and boil it in soft water; pour a little of it amongst cold soft water, and wash the stockings, first upon the inner side; repeat the washing with fresh suds and water, till they are washed quite clean ; turn the outside the last time of washing, and if the feet be very dirty, rub a little of the boiled soap upon them, but not upon the legs. If to be colour- ed, mix the dye with a little clean suds, and dip in the white stockings; draw them out smooth, and lay them upon a sheet on a bed, with the window open, and when almost dry, lay them upon a piece of flannel, and with another bit rolled up, rub them hard and quick one way, till they look glossy and are dry. They may be mangled, turned upon the inner side, and must always be folded straight upon the instep. To Wash Lace. Place the lace in folds, and baste it on each side ; lay it in cold water for a night, and wash it in cold water with the best white soap ; gently rub and squeeze it; wash it in three or four waters with the soap, and after that rinse it well in clean water; then put it into thin starch or rice water; take out the basting thread, and spread it on a blanket upon a bed to dry ; when it is near- ly so, pick it out; lay it in folds, and when quite dry, lay it in an old cambric handkerchief, and then in the folds of a towel; put it upon the rug, or upon a blanket laid upon a stone, and with a heavy wooden pestle, or rolling- pin, beat it hard till the lace looks quite smooth. A scarf or veil, after being starched, should be pinned out tightTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 431 upon a cloth on the floor, and when dry, beaten in the same manner. To Wash Head and Clothes Brushes. In a pint of boiling water, put a dessert-spoonful of pearl-ashes, and shake the brush about in it till it be per- fectly clean ; then pour some clean hot water over it; shake, and dry it before the fire. To Wash Flannels and Worsted Things, to prevent their Shrinking, and to keep them of a good Colour. Take half the weight of soda that there is of soap ; boil them with water, allowing a gallon to every pound of soap, and use it when perfectly cold. Wet the flannels in cold water, then wash them in fresh cold water, with some of the boiled mixture amongst it; wash them in this, changing the water till they become perfectly clean; then rinse them well in cold water, and dry them in the shade. Worsted stockings, washed in this manner, will be made quite clean; but particular care must be taken to wet them in clean cold w-ater, previous to washing them in the cold suds. Blankets should be washed in this way also, and when nearly dry, frequently shaken to raise the pile, and to make them soft. All dirty clothes should be laid in cold water the night before being washed. To Wash Cotton Stockings. Lay them in cold water at night; next day boil them in a copper with some soda and soap; stir them well about, and they will become quite clean without any rub- bing; rinse them well in cold water, and bleach them ; when nearly dry, draw them smooth, folding them straight over the instep. Place them under a heavy weight, or iron them.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 432 To Wash Coloured Dresses. Turn the inner side out, and wasli them in cold wa- ter, in which a little boiled soap is well mixed; rinse them well in clean cold water, and the last time with a little salt in the water, and dry them in the shade. They should be washed and dried with as much expedition as possible. To Clean Gold Chains, Ear-Rings, &c. Make a lather of soap and water; boil the chain in it for a few minutes, and immediately on taking it out, lay it in magnesia powder which has been heated by the fire ; when dry, rub it with flannel ; if embossed, use a brush. To Clean Glasses. Glasses should be washed in a wooden vessel, in which put a sufficiency of cold water to cover them, and rinse them in fresh cold water; wipe off the wet with one cloth, and finish them with another. To Clean Decanters. Roll up, in small pieces, some coarse brown paper, or blotting-paper; wet and soap them, and put them into the decanter, with a little pearl-ashes ; fill in some lukewarn*water, shake it well for a few minutes, or if very dirty, let them stand some hours; then rinse the de- canters with clean cold water. If this does not remove the crust of wine which may be at the bottom, use stable litter, with which nearly half fill the decanter, adding- some cold water, and let it remain for several hours; shake it well, and rinse with clean cold water till perfect- ly clean. The stable litter will also be found an effec- tual cleanser for bottles of any kind, however dirty; but it will be the less required, and much trouble will be spared, if all the bottles used throughout the day be rinsed at night with cold water before being put away. Io clean cut crystal, rub it well with a damp spungc.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 433 dipped in whitening, then take a clean brush and brush it off; afterwards wash the vessel in cold water. To loosen glass stoppers. When glass stoppers can- not easily he taken out, drop on them a little olive oil; place the decanter or bottle before the fire, and in a few minutes it will become loose. To Clean Looking-Glasses. Take a bit of soft spunge, well washed, and cleaned from every thing gritty; just dip it into water and squeeze, it out again, and then dip it into spirits of wine, or any other spirits ; rub it over the glass, then dust it over with some powder—blue, or whitening, sifted through muslin ; rub it lightly and quickly oft' again, with a soft cloth ; then take a clean cloth, and rub it well again, and finish by rubbing it with a silk handkerchief. If the frames be not varnished, great care must be taken not to touch them with the spunge, or with any thing damp. To clean the frames, take a little cotton wool, and rub them with it. Pictures should be rubbed lightly with cotton wool, or brushed with a feather brush. To Clean Hats. When a hat gets wet, wipe it as dry as may be with a cloth or silk handkerchief, then brush it with a soft brush ; when it gets nearly dry, use a harder brush ; and if the fur still sticks, damp it with a spunge dipped in beer or vinegar; then brush it with a hard brush till it dry. To Remove Spots of Grease out of Cloth. Moisten them with a few drops of concentrated so- lution of subcarbonate of potash ; rub the spot between the fingers, and then wash the spot with a little warm water. To remove oil paint, rub the part with a bit of flannel dipped in spirits of wine or turpentine. 2 E434 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Furniture Oil. Mix with one pint of cold-drawn linseed oil, one ounce of spirits of white lavender, half an ounce of powdered gumarabic, dissolved in a little hot oil. T.his being thoroughly mixed, rub it over the tables writh a little wool, and rub it off with clean linen cloths. A brush must never be used. If the furniture is desired of a very dark colour, add to this mixture three ounces of alkanet root, and two ounces of rose-pink. For giving a Bright and Beautiful Polish to Furniture. Mix well with an ox-gall one pint of cold-drawn lin- seed oil, then stir in two glasses of whisky, and when thoroughly mixed, add half an ounce of aquafortis, and 6tir it all together for ten or fifteen minutes ; bottle it, and when to be used, shake it well ; rub it on with a piece of flannel, and then rub very hard with a linen cloth. To Clean Chairs. Scrape down one or two ounces of bees-wax, put it into a jar, and pour as much spirits of turpentine over it as will cover it; let it stand till dissolved. Put a little up- on a flannel or bit of green baize, rub it upon the chairs, and polish them with a brush. A very small portion of finely-powdered white rosin may be mixed with the tur- pentine and wax. To Clean Plate. Cut a yard of coarse calico into four, and boil it in a quart of water, together with two ounces of calcined, powdered, and sifted hartshorn, till all the liquid be ab- sorbed. The plate being wrashed clean, rub it with a piece of the cloth. All plate powder which is mixed with mercury is per- nicious.. Fine colcothar of vitriol, such as painters use, is an excellent plate powder ; that or whitening may bo used, dry, or wet with water, spirits, or oil. The last gives435 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. the brightest polish, but is the most troublesome; it should be put upon the plate with a piece of flannel, the powder then shaken over it, and rubbed off with a lea- ther, or with the hand, if the article is plain; for the rough parts, it will be necessary to have brushes of va- rious sizes, hard and soft; a small tooth-brush will be found useful' amongst them. The spunge and leather used for washing plate should be soft, and a linen cloth must be used to wipe the plate before it is put upon the table. Plated articles should be cleaned with soft brushes, and not too often, and never with any thing but plate powder, wet with spirits or water, as above directed. To remove wax or grease from plate or candlesticks, pour boiling water on them, and wipe them dry directly with an old cloth. Japanned Candlesticks and Tea-Trays. To remove grease from candlesticks, just let the water be warm enough to melt it; then wipe them with a cloth, and if they look smeared, sprinkle a little flour upon them, and wipe it clean off. Wax candles should not be burned in them, as the wax cannot be taken off without injuring the varnish. Wax Candles. Should they get dirty or yellow, wet them with a piece of flannel dipped in spirits of wine. Slioe-Blacking. To four ounces of ivory-black, allow three ounces of loaf sugar, one table-spoonful of salad oil, one ounce of oil of vitriol, and one pint of vinegar ; dissolve the sugar in a little vinegar, put it on the fire together with the oil, and stir it well; when moderately heated, add the pint of vinegar, and ivory-black, and, when cold, stir in the vitriol; put it into a quart bottle, shake it well, and fill it up with vinegar.436 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Another way to make Shoe-Blacking. Mix in one quart of sour porter the following ingre- dients :—three ounces of ivory-black, the same quantity of treacle, two table-spoonfuls of sweet oil, and, lastly, one ounce of vitriol; bottle, and shake it well. Blacking for Carriage Harness, and Leather. Boil, in one quart of vinegar, or sour ale, for twenty minutes, the following ingredients :—Four ounces of fine glue, three ounces of soft soap, half an ounce of isinglass, two ounces of logwood chips, half an ounce of black seal- ing-wax, and three drachms of indigo; strain it while hot. To Clean Boot-Tops White. Mix, in a quart bottle of soft water, one ounce of ox- alic acid, two ounces of finely-pounded pumice-stone, and two tea-spoonfuls of salt of lemon. Cork it tightly. To Clean Boot-Tops Brown. Mix, in the same quantity of water, one ounce of ox- alic acid, half an ounce of muriatic acid, a small phial of spirits of lavender, and two tea-spoonfuls of salt of le- mon. Each bottle should be carefully labelled, and mark- ed “ Poison.” Directions for Using the Liquid. For the white tops: to be scrubbed wTell on with a clean hard brush, then spunged well with cold water, all one way, and allowed to dry gradually in the sun, or by the fire. Brown tops are not to be scrubbed with a brush, but spunged all over with the mixture, till all stains be re- moved ; then spunged well with cold water, and rubbed with flannel till they be highly polished. To render Boots and Shoes Water-proof. Mix carefully over a slow fire, a pint of drying-oil, two437 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. ounces of turpentine, two ounces of yellow wax, and half an ounce of Burgundy pitch. Lay the mixture, whilst hot, on the boots and shoes with a spunge, soft brush, or bit of flannel, and when dry, lay it on again ; repeat the operation until the leather becomes quite saturated. Let them be put away, and not worn, till they become per- fectly elastic, when they will be found not only imper- vious to wet, but soft, pliable, and more durable. To take Ink out of Mahogany. Mix, in a tea-spoonful of cold water, a few drops of oil of vitriol; touch the spot with a feather dipped in it; and, when it disappears, wash the part that has been stained, with cold water. To Clean Stone Kitchens. They should not be often washed, but dry-rubbed with a blue or grey stone, then wiped with a coarse flannel, and swept: thus all greasy spots will be removed. A com- mon brick may be used instead of the stone. To prevent the Smoking of a Lamp. Soak the wick in strong vinegar, and dry it well be- fore it is used. Pot Pourri. Gather, when perfectly dry, a peck of roses; pick off the leaves, and strew over them three quarters of a pound of common salt; let them remain two or three days, and if any fresh flowers are added, some more salt should be sprinkled over them. Mix wdth the roses half a pound of finely-pounded bay-salt, the same quantity of allspice, of cloves, and of brown sugar, a quarter of a pound of gum-benjamin, and two ounces of orris-root; add a glass of brandy, and any sort of fragrant flower, such as orange and lemon flowers, rosemary, and a great quantity of la- vender flowers—also white lilies : a green orange stuck with cloves may he added. All the flowers must be ga- thered perfectly dry. ■THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 438 To make Coffee when much is required. In the morning, pour upon a quarter of a pound of fresh-ground coffee about two quarts of boiling water; stir it for three or four minutes; cover it closely, and let it remain till the evening; pour it off quite clear, and boil it up for use. Another way to make Coffee. Beat an egg, shell and all; mix it with a quarter of a pound of coffee, then pour two quarts of boiling water on it, and boil it for five minutes ; let it settle a little that it may be fine ; or, instead of clearing it with an egg, pour a little cold water into the coffee-pot before taking it off the fire. It may be made in this way in a larger quan- tity, the clear part poured off, bottled, and corked. Thus prepared, kept in a cool place, it will continue good for ten or fifteen days. Milk Coffee for Breakfast. Boil one ounce of good coffee for fifteen minutes in a pint and a half of water. The next day pour off the clear liquor, and the following morning add to it one pint of new milk; make it quite hot, but do not allow it to boil. Sweeten it with pounded sugar-candy, or brown sugar. Cocoa. Put into a sauce-pan one ounce of patent cocoa and one quart of water; cover it, and when it boils, set it by the side of the fire to simmer for two hours. It is sometimes made in a larger quantity, poured from the sediment, and boiled up as it is required. Chocolate. Scrape down one square of chocolate, and mix it with one pint of boiling milk, or milk-and-water; then mill or stir it well, and serve it with the froth.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 439 Oatmeal Gruel. Mix in a basin two table-spoonfuls of oatmeal with a little cold water, then pour on it about a quart of boiling water; stir it well, and let it settle for a few minutes ; pour oft’ the water into a sauce-pan, and boil it for ten or fifteen minutes, stirring it, and taking off the scum as it rises. Barley Water. Wash two ounces of pearl-barley in water, boil it for a few minutes in a little fresh water; pour that off, and add a quart more; when it boils, let it simmer for nearly an hour, and then strain it. It may be sweetened with sugar, and seasoned with a little of the peel and juice of a lemon. Apple Water. Cut three or four large apples into slices, put them into a jug, and pour a quart of boiling- water over them ; co- ver the jug. When quite cold, strain and sweeten it, and add a little lemon juice. Cooling Drink. A palatable and cooling drink may be made by pouring hot water over slices of lemon; when cold, to be strained and sweetened. Beef Tea. Cut a piece of lean beef into small thin bits; boil it with a quart of water in a closely-covered sauce-pan, let it simmer for an hour, then strain, and serve it with salt. White Wine Whey. Boil a pint of milk, and when it rises in the pan, pour in one glass of sherry and one of currant wine; let it again boil up, take it off the fire, and when it has stood a few minutes, remove the curd, pour off the clear whey, and sweeten it.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 440 Irish, or Two Milk Whey. One-third of fresh butter-milk is allowed to two- thirds of sweet-milk ; put the milk into a sauce-pan, make it boiling hot, and then pour in the butter-milk, and gently stir it round the edges of the pan; Jet it come to a boil, take it off the fire, let it settle, and strain oft' the whey. Sour milk may be substituted for butter-milk. An ex- cellent drink in fever. Toast and Water. Pare the crust off a thin slice of stale bread, toast it brown upon both sides, doing it equally and slowly, that it may harden without being burnt; put it into a jug, and pour upon it boiling water; cover the jug with a saucer, and set it in a cool place. Bread Jelly for an Invalid. Cut the crumb of a penny roll into thin slices, and toast them equally of a pale brown ; boil them gently in a quart of water till it will jelly, which may be known by putting a little in a spoon to cool ; strain it upon a bit of lemon peel, and sweeten it with sugar. A little wine may be added. Luncheon for an Invalid. Put bread crumbs and red currant, or any other jelly, alternately into a tumbler, and when nearly half full, fill it up with milk. Sag’O. Cleanse it by first soaking it an hour in cold water, and then washing it in fresh water. To a tea-cupful add a quart of water and a bit of lemon peel, simmer it till the berries are clear, season with wine and spice, and boil it all up together. The sago may be boiled with milk instead of water, till reduced to one-half, aud served with- out seasoning.441 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Mulled Wine. Put into a pint of port wine two or three cloves and a bit of cinnamon; boil it for a few minutes; take out the spice, sweeten it with loaf sugar, and grate in a little nut- meg. Serve with a slice of toasted bread, the crust pa- red off, and cut into oblong pieces. The port wine is sometimes boiled with a third of its quantity of water. Gloucester Jelly. Boil in two quarts of water, till reduced to one quart, the following ingredients: hartshorn shavings, isinglass, ivory shavings, barley, and rice, one ounce of each. When this jelly, which is light, and very nourishing, is to be taken, a few table-spoonfuls of it must be dissolved in a little milk, together with a bit of cinnamon, lemon peel, and sugar. It will be very good without the sea- soning. To make Arrow-Root. Mix with two or three table-spoonfuls of arrow-root half a pint of cold water; let it stand for nearly a quarter of an hour, pour off the water, and stir in some pounded sugar; boil a pint of milk, and pour it gradually upon the arrow-root, stirring it one way all the time. Or it may be made with water in which lemon peel has been boiled, and then a glass of port or white wine and a little nut- meg stirred into it. Cream of Tartar, When to be taken, either medicinally or as a cooling- drink, may be mixed in the proportion of a heaped tea- spoonful to a pint of water, which has, when hot, been poured upon the thin peel of half a lemon, and allowed to stand till quite cold. Sweeten with honey or sugar. Suet Milk. Cut into very small shavings one ounce of fresh mut- ton suet; dissolve it slowly over the fire in one pint of442 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. milk, together with a bit of lemon peel and cinnamon ; sweeten it with pounded loaf sugar. Saline Draught. Salt of wormwood, twenty grains, lemon juice, a ta- ble-spoonful, water, two table-spoonfuls, magnesia, twen- ty grains; mix it in a tumbler, together with a little pounded sugar, and take two or three of these in the day. For a Cough. Two ounces of squilled vinegar, two ounces of clari- fied honey, two drachms of tincture of tolu, sixty drops of laudanum ; two tea-spoonfuls to be taken morning and evening by a grown person, one by a child. Sage Gargle. Boil quickly in a pint of water, a large handful of sage leaves ; cover the pan closely, and when reduced to one- half, strain it; when cold, mix it with the same quantity of port wine and of vinegar; sweeten it with honey, or witli brown sugar. The decoction of sage may be used alone as a gargle, or with vinegar and honey, without the port wine; or gargle with vinegar and water. Bitters. Put into a quart of sherry one ounce of best pounded aloes, the same of rhubarb and of liquorice root, also one tea-spoonful of powdered ginger; keep it in the sun, or by the fire, for eight or ten days, shaking it frequently; let it settle for twenty-four hours ; strain it through flan- nel. Two or three tea-spoonfuls relieve headachs and weakness of the stomach. Lip Salve. One ounce and a half of white wax, two ounces of fresh suet, one ounce of oil of sweet almonds, half an ounce of spermaceti, two drachms of alkanet root, two drachms of balsam of Peru, one ounce of finely-pounded double-refined sugar, and six raisins sliced; simmer all443 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. these ingredients together for ten minutes, and strain it through muslin. Cold Cream. Cut one cake of white wax into thin shavings, and dis- solve it in one pint of oil of sweet almonds, together with a table-spoonful of powdered spermaceti, and one of fresh lard; when melted, throw it into a large basin of cold water, and, with a silver spoon, beat it about briskly for half an hour; pour off the water, add as much fresh wa- ter, and beat it again for the same length of time ; then pour off the ivater, and add a quart of rose water, and beat it briskly for half an hour. Put it into small pots, filling them not quite full, and pour a little fresh rose water on the top; cover them closely with bladder and paper. Red Lavender Drops. Fill a quart bottle with the blossoms of lavender, and pour on it as much brandy as it will contain ; let it stand ten days, then strain it, and add of nutmeg bruised, cloves, mace, and cochineal, a quarter of an ounce each, and bot- tle it for use. In nervous cases, a little may be taken dropped on a bit of sugar; and in the beginning of a bowel complaint, a tea-spoonful, taken in half a glass of peppermint water, will often prove efficacious. For the Ear-ach. Dip a little cotton wool into a mixture of oil of sweet almonds and laudanum, and put it into the ear; or apply a small poultice, in which is put a raw chopped clove of garlic. Burns. Apply to, or wrap round, the burnt part some folds of cotton wool, bought in sheets, or as it comes from the West Indies ; however severe the pain may be, it will abate in a few hours. Should blisters rise, they may next day becarefully pricked with a needle, so as to break the414' THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. skin as little as possible; and the cotton kept on till the cure is effected. To stop violent Bleeding from a Cut. Make a paste, by mixing fine flour with vinegar, and lay it on the cut. Harvest Bugs. Mix equal parts of oil of olives, laudanum, and spirits of hartshorn, and apply it to the part affected. Tooth Powder. Mix hartshorn shavings, calcined and pulverized, three- fifths ; myrrh, pulverized, two-fifths. Paste. Rub two table-spoonfuls of flour quite smooth in one pint of water; put it on the fire, and stir it constantly till it become clear, which it may be after boiling for about ten minutes. A stronger and more delicate paste may be made of starcb, by boiling it for a few minutes after it has been prepared as for starching muslin. Captain Hall’s Sandwiches for Travellers. Spread butter, very thinly, upon the upper part of a stale loaf of bread cut very smooth, and then cut off the slice; now cut off another thin slice, but spread it with butter on the under side, without which precaution the two slices of bread will not fit one another. Next take some cold beef, or ham, and cut it into very minute par- ticles. Sprinkle these thickly over the butter, and, having added a little mustard, put the slices face to face, and press them together. Lastly, cut the whole into four equal portions, each of which is to be wrapped in a sepa- rate piece of paper.115 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. CHAPTER XX. POULTRY. MANAGEMENT OF FOULTRY Warm, dry, and shingly soil, like the sea beach, is best adapted for the rearing of poultry; and such may be artificially formed, where it is not afforded by nature. A yard or court being pitched upon, the foundation should be laid with chalk or bricklayers’ rubbish, the surface to consist of sandy gravel; and considerable spots of it may be sown with common trefoil or wild clover, with a mix- ture of bumet, 6purry, or star-grass, which last species are particularly salubrious to poultry. The surface must be sloped and drained, so as to avoid all stagnant moist- ure, and the whole enclosed with a fence, lofty, and so secured at the bottom that the smallest chicken may not find a passage through. The poultry houses within the court should have a southern aspect, and if the number of the stock be large, the houses had far better be small and detached; and should they abut upon a stable, brew-house, or any con- ductor of warmth, it will be a farther advantage. The floors should consist of well-rammed chalk or earth, so that they may be easily swept clean. In the roof, which must be lofty, there should be only one long and level range of perches; and if in the wall steps be so placed that the poultry may jump from the one to the other, the ascent will be rendered easy to the perches, and also to the nests, for which boxes are the most convenient, when properly constructed. A few railed doors may he pro-446 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. vided, to hang before the entrance of those in which hens are sitting. Nests for breeders are generally preferred upon the ground, on account of the danger of chickens falling from those which are placed above. In making the nest, soft and short straw should be chosen. Various beds or heaps of sifted ashes or very dry sand should be placed in the yard, in which the fowls may have the com- fort and benefit of rolling and bathing themselves; and a place of refuge should be provided for such liens or chickens as the cock has taken a dislike to. The feeding room, at once warm, and airy, and large enough to accommodate twenty or thirty fowls, should have perches in it for those birds that are inclined to perch, which they will not be after they have become heavy. The floor may be slightly littered down; the litter often changed. The greatest cleanliness should be observed, and sandy gravel placed in several layers, and often changed. A sufficient number of troughs, for both water and food, should be placed around, that the stock may feed with as little interruption as possible from each other. This description of feeding room is well adapted for the feeding of young chickens; and it will be found most advantageous to put them up immediately on their being quitted by the hen, more particularly young cocks, and all those which stand high upon the legs. Under a regular system, it would be preferable to se- parate entirely the aquatic from the other poultry, the aquatic to have their houses ranged along the banks of a piece of water, with a fence and sufficiently capacious walks in front: access to the water by doors, to be clo- sed at will. The White Darking Is one of the largest of our fowls, and is a plentiful layer; the polanders are similar, but generally black ; they are very ornamental, and one of the most useful varieties —they are sometimes called everlasting layers, and being least inclined to sit of any other breed, their eggs are frequently set under other hens. The flesh of the gameTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 447 fowl is superior to all other breeds of domestic fowls for richness and delicacy of flavour; but from their disposition to fight, they are difficult to be reared. Yellow-legged fowls are often of a tender constitution, and always in- ferior in the quality of their flesh. A young and healthy fowl may be known by the fresh and florid colour of the comb, the dryness of the eye, and the nostrils being free from any discharge, and the plumage glossy. The indi- cations of old age are, paleness of the comb and gills, dul- ness of colour, and a sort of downy stiffness in the fea- thers, length and size of talons, the scales upon the legs be- coming large and prominent. Delicate white hens do not lay so many eggs in a cold season as the more hardy coloured varieties. Cordial horse-ball is good to pro- mote laying in cold weather, and also toast and ale. A hen desirous of sitting should not be prevented by any violent means ; allowing her to sit will probably not deter her so long from laying as harsh treatment. Those above the common size of their respective varieties are not preferable as layers or sitters. They are in their prime at three years, and decline after five. The number of hens to one cock from four to six. When a cock is moulting it should be withdrawn, and one that is known to and familiar with the hens substituted. When a turkey-hen becomes sick, it is found beneficial to pull out the feathers of the tail. It should be a general rule to breed from young stock. A two-years old cock, and pullets in their second year, provided they have the best food, accom- modation, and attendance, may be allowed to sit so early as January. Eggs for sitting should never exceed the age of a month ; the newest laid to be preferred, and as nearly of a size as possible : those which have the circu- lar flaw, indicating the double yolk, should be avoided. The number of eggs may be from nine to fifteen, accord- ing to the size of the fowl; an odd number should be chosen, that they may lie the closer, and they may be marked with a pen and ink, 60 that any new laid ones may be removed. An egg being broken in the nest, it should be cleared away, and the remainder washed withTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 4-1-8 warm water. It is proper to place corn and water occa- sionally beside the sitting lien, withdrawing them as soon as she is satisfied. Hens sit twenty days. The chickens first hatched should be taken from the nest and secured in a basket of wool or soft hay, and kept, if the weather be cold, near the fire. They will re- quire no food for some hours, even for twenty-four. The whole brood being hatched, the hen is to be placed for some days under coop, upon a dry place, and, if possible, not within reach of another hen, nor near numbers of young fowls. The first food split grits, afterwards tail corn. All watery food, soaked bread, or potatoes, im- proper as first food ; hard-boiled eggs, and curd chopped small, is much approved ; their water should be pure, and often renewed. There are pans made in such forms, that the chickens may drink without getting into the water ; a basin turned down in the middle of a pan of water, will answer the end, the water running round it. They must not be let out early in the morning, or whilst the dew re- mains upon the ground, far less be suffered to range over the wet grass; and they should be cautiously guarded against sudden changes of the weather, or exposure to rain. When the hen begins to roost, the chickens may be associated with the young poultry as nearly of their own age as possible, or put up to feed. In choosing full-sized fowls for feeding, the short-legged and early hatched always deserve a preference. There are various modes of feeding, but whether for domestic use or sale, the best method is constant high keep from the begin- ning ; their flesh will in consequence be more juicy and finer flavoured, and they will be always ready for the table, except in the moulting season, which is during the autumn for the old, and the spring for the young, poul- try. The pullets which have been hatched in March, if high fed from the beginning, will lay plentifully through the following autumn, and in February may be used for the table ; about which period their laying will be finish- ed. The fowls will be finest that have the run of the 4449 THE PRACTICE OP COOKERY. farm-yard; but they will be little inferior if accommo- dated and attended to as before directed, and be al- lowed abundance and variety of wholesome food. Barley is the best grain for poultry, but they will thrive well on oats and tail wheat; heavy wheat is generally considered injurious; any light grain ground, together with peas, and made into brose, will be found excellent food; as al- so potatoes, when boiled, peeled, and made into thick brose with meal, that is, boiling water stirred into the mixture. A cock and two hens, having as much food as they choose to eat, will consume a quarter of a peck of the best barley in a week. Turkeys. Tiie true black Norfolk turkey is esteemed superior to all others. One turkey cock is sufficient for six hens. The hen will cover, according to her size, from nine to fifteen eggs. Her term of sitting is thirty days, during which period constant attendance, with both food and water, is necessary. The chicks must be withdrawn from the nest as soon as hatched, and kept very warm. The hen and brood should be housed during a month or six weeks, and fed on curd or eggs, boiled hard, and barley- meal kneaded with milk, or rather clear water, and often renewed. In case of the chicks appearing sickly, and the feathers ruffled, indicating a chill from severity or change of weather, half-ground malt may be mixed with the barleymeal, and by way of medicine, powdered carroway seeds; also artificial worms, that is, boiled meat pulled into strings, in running after which, the chicks have a salutary exercise. This diet is beneficial for every spe- cies of chicks. All slop victuals should be avoided; and their being kept dry, warm, and clean, is of the ut- most consequence. A fresh turf of short sweet grass daily, cleared from snails and slugs, which will scorn- young chicks, is very pleasing to them, and promotes their health. After a month or six weeks confinement within doors, the hen may be cooped for another fort- night ; when full grown, they will, in a good range, pro-THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 450 vide themselves throughout the day, requiring oidy to he fed at their outletting in the morning, and on their return at even. Sodden barley, or barley and wheat meal mix- ed, is the proper food for fattening turkeys. The Bustard Will probably thrive well on the same food as the turkey. It is seldom reared; but as its flesh has ever been considered most delicious, It appears particularly worthy of the attention of those who aim at variety and novelty. Guinea and Pea Fowls Are in season when game is going out, namely, from February to June. The guinea fowl assimilates per- fectly with the common species in habits and in kinds of food. They are very prolific, and their eggs nourishing and good. The peacock is not only ornamental, but useful for the destruction of all kinds of reptiles ; but some are apt to tear to pieces young chickens and ducklings. They are also destructive in gardens. The cock requires from two to four hens. They are granivorous, like other do- mestic fowls, preferring barley. The Duck. The Rhone ducks are of a darker flesh, and more sa- voury, than the English duck, but somewhat coarse. The white variety of the English duck are never so high fla- voured as the darker colours. The Muscovy and other foreign varieties arc kept more for curiosity than use. The white Aylesbury are a beautiful stock. The can- vass-backed ducks of America are said to be the finest in the world ; they have probably not yet been imported into Europe. The duck will cover from eleven to fifteen eggs, and she sits thirty days. One drake to five ducks is allowed. The duck, when sitting, requires a secret and safe place; but no farther attendance is necessary till the whole brood is hatched, when a coop should be pre- pared upon the short grass, if the weather is fine, or un*THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 451 der shelter if otherwise; a wide and flat dish of water, often to be renewed, standing at hand ; barley, or any meal, the first food. In rainy weather particularly, it is useful to clip the tails of the ducklings, and the surround- ing down beneath, that they may not draggle and weaken themselves. The duck should be cooped at a distance from any other; their confinement to the coop need sel- dom extend to a fortnight. Oats whole or bruised are the standard fattening material for ducks and geese, to which may be added peasemeal, as it may be required; and if they are confined, the house-wash may be mixed with their food. They are very fond of acorns, and will get fat on them alone. The Goose. The best geese in England are probably to be found on the borders of Suffolk and Norfolk, and in Berkshire. The foreign varieties are kept only for ornament. Their treatment is similar to that of ducks. Some cooling greens, clivers, or the like, may be mixed with their first food, namely, barleymeal, bruised oats, or fine pollards. Hemlock or deadly nightshade should be removed from the range of young geese; and both old and young are often killed by swallowing slips of yew after they are able to frequent the pond. The young geese will obtain their living, and few people favourably situated allow them any thing more excepting the vegetable produce of the garden ; but to have fine geese, a little solid corn or pulse may be given morning and evening. Equal quan- tities of the meal of rye and pulse, mixed with skimmed- milk, form an excellent feeding article for geese and ducks. Pigeons. The proper place for the pigeon-house, or cot, is the poultry-yard ; it should have a south-west aspect. The common barred dovecot is well adapted to every situa- tion, and pigeons do well near dwellings, stables, bake- houses, or such offices. Its situation will necessarily de-THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 452 pend on convenience. One general rule must, however, be observed, that every pair of pigeons have two holes or rooms to nest in. Cleanliness is one of the first and most important considerations. They will thrive the better if cleaned daily, and thoroughly once a-week—the floor, covered with sifted gravel, often renewed. They are exceedingly fond of water, and when confined in a room, should have a pan of water, often renewed, as a bath ; and to take their attention from the garden, and to prevent their picking the mortar from buildings, they should be provided with a salt cat, which is a dish of the following composition : loam, sand, mortar, fresh lime, bay salt, cummin, coriander, carraway seed, and allspice, moistened with wine, heaped up in the dish, and a piece of board placed upon the summit to prevent the birds from dunging upon it. It is always injudicious to purchase old pigeons for stocking, as even cutting their wings will not ensure their remaining. Squeakers, or such as have not yet flown, will become perfectly domesticated if confined for a short time. In justice to the farmer, the proprietor of pigeons ought to feed them regularly, more particularly in seedtime, and towards harvest, and also when the ground is bound by frost, or covered with 6now. Tares, and the smallest kind of horse-bean, commonly called pigeon-beans, are both the best and cheapest food, and the pulse is better to be of the previous year.THE PRACTICE OT COOKERY. 153 CHAPTER XXL THE DAIRY. A Dairy-House ought to be well aired, free from damp, and situated so that a proper temperature may be preserved,—from 50° to 55° Fahrenheit. A milk dairy requires two apartments; one for the milk, the other for scalding and cleaning the different utensils. To secure a proper degree of heat for common purposes, a vacuity of eight or ten inches, left betwixt the wall and the lath and plaster, will be sufficient. The roof should be of thatch, three feet thick at the least, and should project completely over the walls on each side. To afford shade and a beneficial degree of coolness to the whole building, the outer doors may be made to open under a penthouse, or lean-to shed. It would be advantageous to have an ice- house attached to the dairy, as a small quantity of ice, placed when necessary in the milk room, would soon lower the temperature to any degree that might be want- ed. If the cold in winter should become too great, a bar- rel of hot water, close stopped, or a few hot bricks, placed on the floor or table of the milk-room, would readily counteract its effects ; a chafing-dish with burning coals should never be used. The utensils required for a dairy of twenty cows, may, in most cases, be provided for L.20 or L.30. Wood has in general been employed in their construction, and is, upon the whole, the most eligible ma- terial ; lead, brass, and copper, are altogether inadmissi- ble ; the least objectionable of all the metallic milk-dishes, are probably those which have been lately invented by Mr Braid of the Sliotts iron-works in Linlithgowshire.454 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. A proper choice of cows is of the greatest importance. Of the black cattle of the island, the short-horned, or Dutch, and the long-horned, or Lancashire, are in general preferred ; the first yields the greatest quantity of milk ; that of the second is not so abundant, but richer: the polled, or Galloway cows, are excellent milkers, and the Suffolk duns are much esteemed, as are also the Ayrshire cows. For the management of cows, it is of the greatest consequence to keep them easy, clean, and well aired ; when they are turned out to pasture, they must not be over driven, or have so far to travel as to induce fatigue. Their food in winter may be of two kinds, either dry or green ; of dry food, hay and straw are almost the only kinds used ; the most profitable kinds of green food are parsnips, carrots, cabbages, and turnips : from one to two hundred pounds a-day of cabbages or turnips will be con- sumed by a middle-sized cow. By means of stall-feeding with green crops, a cow can be kept in milk not only for a month longer in autumn than by the common modes, but even through the whole winter season. When green succulent food cannot be procured, it will be judicious to give them their preserved fodder either boiled, or steeped in warm water. It is found to be beneficial to them to vary their food from time to time, and for a few weeks before calving, they should have every night a little hay, or a somewhat greater allowance of green food. On the day of calving, they should be kept in ; and, im- mediately after, it is useful to give them a handful or two of meal, mixed with lukewarm water. For a fortnight after calving, they should have, with their green food, a little hay, or chopped straw, with some ground or crushed oats. This food ought to be put into their stalls in small quanti- ties at a time, and a little salt given with it improves the quality, and increases the quantity of milk. The land necessary to maintain a cow, may, at an average, be stated from two to three English acres, if it is taken into account the corn, hay, straw, and every thing else the animal con- sumes. One dairy-maid may manage a dozen or fifteen cows,THE FRACTICE OF COOKERY. 455 having assistance in the milking of them. Cows should be milked in the house rather than in the field; three times a-day, at least, in summer : early in the morning, at noon, and just before nightfall. It is of the utmost consequence, that the whole milk secreted be at each milking drawn away. It maybe laid down as a pretty general rule, that eighteen pounds of milk will yield one pound of butter, and that this is the produce of a single cow per day ; some, however, will furnish twice or even thrice this quantity. The best age for a milk cow is betwixt four and ten. When old, she will give more milk, but of an inferior quality. Of the Prevention and Cure of Diseases incident to Black Cattle. Regular watering, as well as sound food, prevents many diseases; and cattle ought to be carefully kept from smelling carrion, or chewing bones. The diseases of cattle may be divided into three class- es. The first proceeds from feeding too greedily on clo- ver or common grass, particularly in the fall of the year. The remedy usually employed is the probang, a flexible instrument, which being passed into the stomach, the con- fined air rushes out; when this is not at hand, three small canes, each six feet long, are bound together with waxed packthread, and a smooth ball of wood, about the size of a pigeon’s egg, fixed at the end: in order to pass it down the throat, an assistant must lay hold of the nostrils, and keep out the head, as nearly as possible, in a line with the throat. The food that is in consequence thrown up, must be removed from the mouth; after which, the ani- mal should be turned out into bare pasture, or get twice a-day, for three days, half-a-pint of mild ale, with one race of ginger grated into it. The diseases of the second class proceed from de- rangement of the digestive system, and occur chiefly late in winter or in spring. They are moor-ill, yellows, red- water, flatulent colic, scouring, tail-rot, joint fallen, &c., for which the following opening medicine is administered ;THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 456 —Mix, for one drench, of common salt four ounces, Bar- badoes aloes half an ounce, ginger one dram, water one quart, and anodyne carminative tincture two ounces, or a glass of gin. Having administered in the morning the opening me- dicine, for scouring or for tail-rot, the following cordial may be given in the evening:—Take of powdered ca- techu two drams, fresh-powdered allspice two drams, fresh-powdered carveys half an ounce, good strong beer or ale half a pint, table-beer or water half a pint. Let the ingredients be simmered for a few minutes in the table-beer or water, and let the strong beer be added at the time the drench is given. The third class depends on repletion of the blood-ves- sels, and prevails most in summer ; the symptoms of fe- ver are, quick breathing, hot horns and ears, &c. The remedies to be employed are copious bleeding, that is, till the animal becomes faint, (a young and healthy cow will generally bear the loss of two gallons of blood,) opening medicine, and putting the animal on short or bare pasture. The only application necessary for swollen udder, or swollen joints, is neats’ feet oil, or olive oil; when the swelling is considerable, fomentation, with hot water having a little grease in it, may be of use. The best remedy for sore teats is rubbing them with hog’s-lard. When a cow chokes upon a turnip, pour down its throat salt and water ; if that will not do, use a hornful of salt and melted grease, such as hog’s-lard, or any kind of common grease ; warm oil and salt would probably have the same effect. When a calf seems indisposed and loose in the bowels, a little powdered chalk may be added to its milk. When costive, the following laxative may be given ; and when it scours, the following cordial will be found effectual:— Laxative. Of common salt, from half an ounce to one ounce, nloes one dram, soda one dram, ginger half a dram, waterT1IE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 457 half a pint, and gin a tablo-spoonful, well mixed to- gether. Cordial. Caraway seeds, recently powdered, half an ounce, ginger half a dram, carbonate of soda one dram, water eight ounces, and brandy or gin one ounce, mixed well. Calves Should be taken from the cow immediately, and whether to be reared or fatted, are best fed entirely on milk ; but if it be scarce, they may get milk-porridge, or turnips boiled to a mash, and mixed with two pints of milk at each meal, which should be given three times a-day the first month, twice the second, and once the third. When the calf is to be fed for the table, it should have as much milk, warm from the cow, the last-drawn to have extremely fine veal, as it will take three times a-day. When it is five weeks old, it should be bled, and again a week after; in a few days more, it may be killed. Some persons consider bleeding unnecessary. Butter. In the production of good butter, more depends on management than on the quality of the cow, or the rich- ness of its food. When dairying is conducted on a great scale, the horizontal, commonly called the barrel- churn, is the best; the vertical, or pump-churn, is well adapted to the operation of making butter from the pro- duce of a few cows only. Milk is not at the best till about four months after the cow has calved ; and the de- gree of heat most favourable to the production of cream from milk, is from 50° to 55° Fahrenheit. In summer, the milk should be allowed to stand half an hour before it be put into the pans, which should not exceed two inches in depth. In winter, it should be set as soon as possible. From the last-drawn half of the milk, if al- lowed to stand till it tastes perceptibly sourish, cream of a superior quality will be obtained, and its quantity458 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. hot considerably less tlian if the whole were set apart for the production of cream. Sweet cream requires four times as much churning as that which has become sour by standing. From twelve to twenty hours in summer, and about twice as long in winter, should be permitted to elapse before the milk is skimmed—after it is put in- to the pans, during the hot summer months, this should always be done in the morning before the dairy becomes warm. The cream should then be deposited in a jar, placed in the coolest part of the dairy, stirred often, and shifted every morning into a clean and well-scalded jar, or other vessel. In hot weather, churning should be perform- ed, if possible, every other day, and never less frequent- ly than twice a-week. The operation ought to be mode- rate, equable, and uninterrupted. In summer, the churn ought to be chilled with cold water before the cream be put into it; and during the process of churning, it should be immersed in cold water, to the depth of a foot or so, provided a pump-churn be used ; to a barrel-churn, wet cloths may be applied. In winter, heat must be cau- tiously employed. It is better to steep the churn for some time in warm water, than to pour water into it be- fore churning; it may be placed in the warmest part of the house, but not close to the fire. The cows should not be fed with turnips till after they are milked, otherwise the milk and butter will have an unpleasant taste ; late in the season, when the turnips are not so good, this precaution may be insufficient. To counteract the effects of the turnip, or any other green food, boil two ounces of saltpetre, or the same quantity of cream-of-tartar, in a quart of water; and, when cold, add a table-spoonful, or more, if necessary, of the liquid, every other day to the collected cream. Method of Making up Butter. When the butter is sufficiently gathered in the churn, which is known by the largeness of the lumps and the cleanness of the dashers, it is taken out, kneaded in a bowl, or other shallow vessel, to let out the butter-milk,4oi) THE PRACTICE 61' COOKERY. spread thin over the inside of the bowl, and clean cold water poured over it; kneaded, broken, and respread in the water; the water poured off; the butter beaten in large lumps, or handfuls, of three or four pounds, against the sides of the bowl, respread, salted, the salt worked in, rewashed, and rebeaten until the water comes oft' un- sullied, which it will do after two or three rvashings. It is then broken into pound lumps, rebeaten against the bowl, and printed or otherwise made up. There is a finishing operation which is sometimes given in the neighbourhood of London. It is thus performed:-— The bowl or tray being wetted, to prevent the butter from sticking to it, and a cheese-cloth strainer or other cloth being washed in clean cold water, and wrung as dry as possible, a pound lump of butter is placed in the bowl, and with a stroke of the hand, proportioned to the stiffness of the butter, is beaten with the cloth; as the pat of butter becomes flat and thin, it is rolled up with the cloth, by a kind of dexterity which can only be acquired by prac- tice, and again beaten flat; the dairy-woman, every three or four strokes, rolling up either one side or the other of the pat, and moving it about in the bowl, to prevent its sticking. As soon as the cloth fills with moisture, which it extracts from the butter, and imbibes in the manner of a spunge, it is wrung, and rewashed in clean cold water. Each pound of butter requires, in cool weather, four or five minutes to be beaten thoroughly, but two minutes are at any time of essential service. Before the dairy-woman begins to take the butter out of the churn, she first scalds, and then plunges immediately into cold water, every ves- sel and thing which she is about to make use of, in or- der to prevent the butter from sticking to them. In sum- mer, when the butter is very soft, it is sometimes neces- sary to rub them, after scalding, with salt, which greatly assists the wood in retaining the moisture. She also puts her own hands into the hottest water she can bear them in, rubs them with salt, and immediately plunges them into cold water. This she repeats as often as she finda the butter stick to them.460 THE PRACTICE OP COOKERY. The best season for curing butter is from the begin- ning of August until the end of September; but if the pasture be rank, whether through soil, manure, or herb- age, it is generally injudicious to put down butter from it. Care must be taken that the firkin be well seasoned before butter be put into it. The readiest method is by the use of unslaked lime, or a large quantity of salt-and- water well boiled, with which it should be scrubbed, and afterwards thrown into cold water, to remain three or four days, till wanted; and before receiving the butter, scrubbed and rubbed with salt. To Put down Butter. i After being worked up with salt, in the proportion of half an ounce to the pound and half of butter, and ha- ving lain in pound lumps twenty-four hours, the dairy- woman takes two or three of the lumps, joins them to- gether, and kneads them in the manner in which paste is kneaded. This brings out a considerable quantity of wa- tery brine, which being poured out of the bowl, the butter is beaten with a cloth as before. The jar having been pre- viously boiled, or otherwise thoroughly cleaned, and having stood to be perfectly cool and dry, the butter is thrown into it, and kneaded down, as firm and close as possible, with the knuckles and the cloth alternately ; being careful not to have any hollow cell or vacuity for the air to lodge in more particularly round the outsides, between the butter and tbe jar; for this purpose, she repeatedly draws her finger round the sides of the jar, pressing the butter hard, and thereby uniting intimately the jar and the butter. It is fortunate when the jar can be filled at one churning; but when this cannot be done conveniently, the top is left level, and when the next churning of butter is to be add- ed, the surface is raised into inequalities, and the two churnings mixed into one mass. The jar being filled with butter to within two or three inches of the top, it is filled up with brine, made by boiling salt and water, in the proportion of a handful to a pint, ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, straining it into a cooling vessel, and,THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 461 when perfectly cold, putting it upon the butter, about one and a half or two inches deep. If a wooden bung be put upon this, a bladder laid over it, and the jar kept in a dry place, the butter thus preserved will remain perfectly sweet for almost any length of time. The jar should be wider at the bottom than at the top, resembling the up- right churn, the top of it being sufficiently wide to admit of its being filled conveniently, but not wider. Another method of Preparing Butter. Mix one part of saltpetre, one of common salt, and two of sugar. This, thoroughly wrought into the butter, will keep it for a very long time, and communicates to it no salt nor disagreeable taste. Scotch method of Salting Butter. Wash the butter thoroughly in cold water, pressing it strongly and frequently with the hands or broad pieces of wood, and changing the water till it come off clear; then spread it out in thin layers, sprinkle it with salt, in the proportion of one ounce to every three pounds of but- ter, and work it well. In this manner each churning is prepared, till the quantity required to fill the kit is obtain- ed. Make a pickle of salt and water, strong enough to bear an egg, and boil with it two ounces of loaf sugar. Take each making separately, press all the watery brine from it, and work it in a little of the prepared pickle; if it should not come oft' clear, repeat the washing in fresh pickle. The kit having been well scoured, nibbed with dry salt, and rinsed out with a little of the pickle, pack into it separately each making of butter to within two inches of the top; put some pickle on it, and a clean linen rag; the head of the vessel is then put on, and should always be kept close upon it. Method of Preserving Butter with Honey. The butter being cleaned from the milk, it is put into jars, and melted on a stove, or in a water bath on the fire; just before it boils, it is put in a cool place to settle, and462 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. must never be stirred. When cold, the froth is taken off the top, and the dregs removed ; it is then well wash- ed and worked up with honey, in the proportion of an ounce to each pound of butter. Preserved in this way, and potted, it will keep as long as salted butter, will be found more suitable for the table when to be eaten with sweetmeats, and in many respects better adapted for kit- chen use. To make Salt Butter Fresh. Put four pounds of salt butter into a churn with four quarts of new milk, and a little arnatto; churn them to- gether, and in about an hour take out the butter, and treat it exactly as fresh butter, washing it in water, and adding the customary quantity of salt. Cheese. In cheese-making, it is of the utmost consequence to have good rennet, which mav be obtained from the sto- machs of calves, hares, or poultry; that from the maw or stomach of calves is most commonly used, and the fol- lowing Scots method of preparing it seems to be the sim- plest and best:—When the stomach or bag usually term- ed the yirning, in dairy language, is taken from the calf’s body, straw, or any other impurity found in it, ought to be removed from the curdled milk, which, with the chyle, must be carefully preserved; a handful of salt is put inside; it is then l’olled up, and put into a basin or jar, and a handful of salt strewed over it; after standing closely covered for eight or ten days, it is taken out and tied up in a piece of white paper, and hung up near a fire to dry, like bacon, and will be the better for hanging a year before it is infused. When rennet is wanted, the bag with its contents is cut small, and put into a jar or can, with a handful or two of salt; new whey, or boiled water, cooled to 66°, is put upon it. If the stomach is from a newly-dropped calf, about three pints of liquor may be employed. If the calf has been fed for four or five weeks, which will yield more rennet than that of one twice that age, eight pintsTHE FRACTICE OF COOKERY. 463 or more ofliquid may be put to the bag in mash. After the infusion lias remained in the jar from one to three days, the liquid is drawn off, and about a pint more of whey or water put on the bag; when it has stood a day or two, it is also drawn off, strained with the first liquid, and bottled for use as rennet. Some people put a dram- glassful of whisky to each quart or choppin of the rennet. Thus prepared, it may be used immediately, or kept for months. One table-spoonful of it will coagulate, in ten or fifteen minutes, thirty gallons, or sixty Scots pints, of milk, which will yield more than 24 lbs. avoirdupois of cheese. In England, the curdled milk is generally wash- ed from the stomach, and in consequence, the rennet is so much weaker than that made in Scotland, that double the quantity is used, and it requires from one to some- times three hotirs to form the milk into curd. The milk ought to be set, that is, the rennet put to it, at 85° or 90° of Fahrenheit, and covered till it coagulates. Cheese-racks save labour in turning. The plate-rack, with four or five tier, one above another, seems to be the best form. If the cheeses be of different sizes, it ought to be much narrower at the top than at the bottom ; and to preserve the cheeses from vermin, it ought to stand on legs about two feet high, with a broad base board projecting over the legs. A One-Meal Cheese. When the milk has been brought in warm from the cow, it is put into the cheese-tub, and the rennet added to it; the quantity must depend on its strength. As soon as coagulation has taken place, the curd is broken and gathered. A cheese-knife is employed to cut the curd in various directions ; and this being allowed to sub- side for a short time, is again cut by the knife more freely than before, and the operation continued till the whole be reduced to small uniform particles. This business may occupy about the space of twenty minutes, after which the cheese-tub is again covered with a cloth, and allowed to remain nearly the same length of time. \\ hen464 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. the particles have subsided, the whey is laded off, the curd properly pressed by the bottom ot the shimming- dish, the hands, or a semicircular board and weight adapt- ed to the size of the tub. The cheese-knife is now em- ployed, as before, to cut the curd, thereby promoting the free separation of the whey; and pressure is again ap- plied till it be all drained off. The curd is then put into two or three separate vessels, and the dairy-woman breaks it with her hands as small as possible. During this part of the process salt is scattered over the curd, and intimately mixed with it: the proportion is generally regulated by taste—a handful of salt for every six gallons of milk, or about half an ounce to the pound, may be allowed. Having made choice of a vat, commonly made of elm, with holes in the lower part of it proportioned to the quantity of curd, a cloth is spread over it, and the curd is put in by little and little, breaking it all the while ; and having filled the vat, heaped up, and rounded above its top, the cloth is folded over it, a board of an inch thick is laid on the vat, and the whole put into the press, the power of which ought to be applied gradually. When it has been an hour or two in the press, it is taken out, the cheese placed in a vessel of hot whey or ■water, to stand for an hour or two, to harden the skin. It is then wiped dry, covered with a clean dry cloth ; again placed in the vat, which is also wiped dry, and put under the press, to remain for six or eight hours. At this period of the process, if any of the edges happen to project they are pared off, and the cheese is pricked all over with a small bodkin an inch or two deep. It is then wrapped in a clean dry cloth, and replaced in the vat, twice a- day, at least during two days, when it is finally removed, and put into the cheese-rack, or on a dry board, and turned every day for about a wreek. A small quantity of dry moss may be put under it. When two meals of milk are used, unless the weather be very hot, a portion of the creamed milk of the first meal, as a half, or third, being placed in a brass pan, overTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 4-65 a furnace, or in a vessel of hot water, is made scalding hot. Half of it is then poured into the pan in which the 'cream of this milk had been placed. The hot milk and cream, being now intimately mixed, are poured into the cheese-tub, and the warm milk added that had just come in from the cow. In making cheeses of the inferior kind, as from skim- med milk, where, from its tendency to acidity, there is a risk that it will break, or curdle, while over the fire, the whole is brought to a proper temperature by the addition of hot water. The cooler the milk, the more tender and delicate the curd becomes; on the contrary, if the milk be too hot, the curd proves tough and hard. The principal thing in skim-milk cheese operations is cleanliness, which is indeed the life and soul of dairy management. Wooden vessels in which milk has soured, ought to be washed with water into which some potash or lime has been thrown, then filled with water, which should be changed every hour in the course of a day or so, and afterwards scalded and well dried, before milk be again put into them. The colouring matter arnatto adds nothing to the goodness of the cheese, but it is perfectly harmless. An ounce of it is sufficient to colour a hundred-weight of cheese. When it is to be used, tie up as much of the substance as is required, in a linen bag, and put it into half a pint of warm water, to stand over night. The whole of this infusion is in the morning mixed with the milk in the cheese tub, and the rag dipped in the milk rubbed on the palm of the hand, as long as any of the colouring matter can be made to come away.

As soon as the cheese has become firm enough to be handled with safety, it may be brushed with a hard brush, frequently dipped in whey, and when nearly dry, rubbed over with a cloth on which fresh butter had been spread - this operation of washing, rubbing, and turning, to be re- 2 GTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 466 peated once every day, for some weeks, or till the cheese has acquired a rich golden polish, and the blue coat be- gins to appear. Stilton Cheese. Take fifteen gallons of milk, warm from the cow; put twelve pints of sweet cream in a small tub, and pour on it a kettle full of boiling water; stir it till it be well mixed, and then put it into the cheese-tub, with the milk ; when it is at 90° Fahrenheit, add the rennet; when it has coagulated, break the curd a little ; put a thin cloth over it, and take the whey off through it; when as much has been taken off as will come easily, put the curd into a bag or net, and let it hang till it give over dripping, then cut the curd in pieces, and lay it in as much cold water as will cover it; let it lie an hour, and as the pieces are taken out, strew a little salt upon them, and put them into the vat, first breaking the top a little, to make it join with the next piece ; then lay a small weight upon it, so as not to occasion the whey to come off white. It must be turned ever}? three hours the first day, and three times a-day for three days, changing the cloth every time it is turned in the vat, and keeping it under a moderate pres- sure ; it is then taken out of the vat, swathed tight till it begin to dry the bandage, which must be changed every twenty-four hours ; it ought to be rubbed with a little salt before it is bandaged, and, for a considerable time, wiped and turned every day. The best season for making this cheese, is from July till October. Another way to make Stilton Cheese. The rennet being added to fifteen gallons of milk, it is allowed to stand an hour, when the whey is taken off slowly, breaking the curd as little as possible ; this ope- ration will occupy about the space of an hour and a half; cold water is then poured over the curd, so as to cover it, and when it has stood twenty minutes, the water is drain- ed off, and the curd is broken, and salt added ; a pound of newly-churned butter, or a quart of fresh cream, is thenTI1E PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 467 rubbed thoroughly into it, and it is put into the vat, and placed under a pressure of about twenty-two ounces ; the cloth is changed every six or seven hours for some days, and in five or six days, it may be taken out of the vat. Batli Cream Cheese. Three gallons of new milk, one of hot water, and ono pint of cream, are mixed together, and a larger proportion of rennet added than for milk alone ; when the curd is come, it is broken a little, and the whey dripped from it; a gallon of cold water is then poured over it, and it is again broken and dripped ; the same process being re- peated a third time, the curd is put into two quarts of boiling water, and the most of the whey squeezed out; it is then drained, put into the vat, and pressed for three hours ; turned, and pressed for three hours more, which is sufficient. No salt nor colouring is necessary. A Day Cheese. One pint of cream being mixed with twelve pints of noon-day milk, warm from the cow, a little rennet is added, and when the curd is come, the whey is pressed out gently, so as to break the curd as little as possible; it is then laid in a cloth, and put into a small sieve; the cloth is changed every hour during the day, and in twenty- four hours it will be fit for use. It. may be served on a breakfast plate, with vine leaves under it, and will keep perfectly good only one day. New Cheese. To six quarts of new milk from the cow, a little hot water and rennet to turn it, is added ; when the curd is come, it is cut twice across with a cheese-knife or spoon ; then put into a cheese-cloth, and hung up ; in half an hour it is again divided with the cheese-knife, hung up, and al- lowed to remain till night, when it is put into the press ; the following day it is taken out, and each side well rub- bed with a little salt. It will be fit for use in two days.468 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. CHAPTER XXII. BREWING. PREPARATORY REMARKS. The utensils must be large in proportion to the extent of the brewing to be carried on; in most families that point is determined by the size of the washing copper. For two kinds of beer, namely, nine gallons of one sort (ale,) and nine gallons of another sort (table-beer,) the capacity of the copper should not be less than thirteen gallons. The size of the tub must be adapted to the mode of brewing to be pursued. If it is proposed to mash only twice, its capacity should be eighteen gallons ; it ought to be nar- rower at top than at bottom. Two-third parts of any broad-bottomed cask will do very well for carrying on the operations of mashing in the small way. A metal cock is preferable to a wooden. For coolers, common washing-tubs will do tolerably well. For each firkin (nine gallons) of liquor to be brew- ed, (containing ale and beer together,) let these tubs contain on the whole fourteen gallons; if the number can be conveniently increased, it will expedite the cool- ing process. For a brewing of eighteen gallons, whether of the same or different liquors, one sixteen and one469 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. twelve gallon tub are required, the larger tub being in- tended to serve in the threefold capacity of receiver, cooler, and gyle-tun. The tub intended to serve as un- derbade or receiver of the running wort from the mash- tub, ought to have its capacity divided into gallons; it may be done by notches cut in the surface, or small nails driven into the wood. A few pails should also be ready at hand. A gyle-tun ought properly to be narrow in proportion to its depth ; but a cask of any shape, simply deprived of its head, allowing fifteen gallons capacity for every nine gallons of liquor intended to be suffered to ferment in it, will do very well. A common thermo- meter, with a metal scale, enclosed in a tin case, should be provided, to ascertain the temperature of the water; but if there should not be one at hand, heat 220 mea- sures, gallons, or quarts of water, according to the quan- tity required, and, when it boils, add 100 similar mea- sures of cold water. Barrels of eighteen gallons capacity are most conve- nient and economical for storing beer. Cleanliness cannot be too much attended to in the brewing process. Some days before brewing, all the casks and tubs should be filled with water, to render them tight; and, after the brewing utensils are made use of, they should be thoroughly washed out; during the sum- mer, the vessels may be scoured with lime water; and the copper ought to be kept especially clean. The mo- ment a cask is empty, fasten down the vent peg, and stop the tap-hole with a cork well fitted and hammered into its place.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 470 Pale-coloured malt is preferable to amber-coloured malt; if it be new, it should be left exposed to the open air oue or two days after grinding, before it be used; if old, it should be ground the one day and used the next. When it is ground too finely, it clogs the mash, and im- pedes the draining of the wort; but every grain should be bruised. When economy is an object, a quantity of molasses or muscovado sugar may be substituted for a portion of the malt; 12 lbs. of molasses, or 10 lbs. of sugar, are equal to one bushel of malt; when used, it may be dissolved in the water employed for the second and third mashing. Farnham hops are esteemed the best; Nottinghamshire, termed Northclay hops, have a rank flavour in beer newly brewed, and should therefore only be used for strong keeping beers. Worcester hops have a flavour peculiarly mild and delicate. Yeast produced from the fermentation of strong ale or porter is the best. Quantity of ale or table-beer to be brewed from a given quantity of malt and hops :— From a quarter of malt may be brewed 72 gallons of ale, or 144 of table beer; or 27 of ale, and 90 of table beer. In mashing, the quantity of water employed must exceed the beer required in the proportion of six gallons to every bushel; three will be left in the goods, and the other three evaporated in the boiling, cooling, and work- ing. The wort may be all mixed together in the gyle- tun ; or, if strong ale be required, the first and second may be fermented separately from the third, which will be small beer. If the strong ale be desired particularly fine, the second and third may be fermented together, or each mashing may be kept separate; the first for strong ale, the second for keeping beer, and the third small beer for immediate use. If the beer be not intended for keeping, one bushel of malt and ten ounces of hops will produce 12 gallons of common or table ale ; and ale brewers allow one measure of such ale to be equal to two of small beer. From one bushel of malt, therefore, may be brewed. 24 gallons ofTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 47 1 table beer, without any table ale; or nine gallons of ale, and six of table beer; or six of ale, and twelve of table beer. This is the smallest quantity of malt that should be em- ployed for brewing twelve gallons of table ale. If the ale be intended for keeping, it is advisable to allow six bushels (a boll) of pale malt to brew a hogshead (54 gallons) of good ale. The quantity of hops must be suited to the taste of the consumers; for those who do not like the strong flavour of the hop, two pounds in winter and three in summer may be allowed to the boll. The mashing is done by two, three, and sometimes four infusions of hot water. The degree of heat depends on the combination of so many circumstances, that it cannot be fixed by any certain rule. When too hot, it forms the malt into a pulp or paste, so that it will not run out of the mash-tun, and the liquor will neither pro- duce wort of good quality, nor in any considerable quan- tity. This is more particularly the case when the malt is low ground, that is, fine. When the water is of too low a heat, the beer will be spiritless, and liable to turn sour. A large quantity is mashed at a lower heat than a small; and when beer is intended for keeping, the water should be of a higher temperature. Well-made malt may be mashed at the highest heat; the extremes may be stated at 145° and 190° of Fahrenheit. The first mash stands longer, and is taken at a lower heat, than the second, which again bears the same rela- tion to the third. If the goods be glutinous, a longer time will be required for spending the tap, as the draw- ing off the wort is called. After it is drawn off, it should be boiled as soon as possible. When the process of mashing commences, pour into the mash-tun four gallons of boiling water for every peck of malt to be employed ; if the copper is not sufficiently capacious, boil the remaining quantity of water as quickly as possible, and add it to the mash. When the water has cooled down to the temperature of, say 170°, let one person gradually pour the malt into the tun, while ano- ther stirs and mixes it well with the water, which will472 THE PRACTICE OE COOKERY. occupy half an hour at least; then cover up the tun with blankets, carpets, or whatever else is ready at hand. Ihe usual mode of covering with a cap of grist is a waste of malt. When the mash has stood one hour and a half in winter, and one hour in summer, let the wort run off into the vessel destined to receive it, returning the first gallon, which may be thick, to the mash. While this mash is preparing, let the copper be again filled with water for the second mash, for which two gallons of water may be employed for every peck. Let it be pour- ed on the malt by one person, while another plies the oar for half an hour ; after it has stood an hour, draw it off; if it be intended to brew only one kind of liquor, the second wort may run into the receiver containing the first wort. The third mash should be made with the re- maining quantity of water, and may stand three quarters of an hour. The grist may be mashed in two operations; but it is always preferable to make three mashes. To boil the wort.—Put along with the first ale wort (supposing it to have been kept separate for the purpose of brewing ale) the whole quantity of hops into the cop- per, boil the mixture till the liquor breaks, or becomes clouded with large fleecy flakes. This will take place probably when the wort has been boiled about an hour and a half: the breaking or curdling is best observed by taking a basin full of the wort out of the copper, and suf- fering it to cool, when the flakes will be distinctly seen in the wort. The tubs having been raised on a support from the floor, and arranged for the cooling process, strain the boiled liquor into them through a riddle or flour sieve; put the hops back into the copper, and boil them again with the second and third wort. The cooling of the boiled wort should be effected with the utmost ex- pedition ; in summer it should not, if possible, be laid at a greater depth than three inches; in winter five; and the coolers so disposed that the temperature of the whole may be the same. When it has become milk-warm, or from 62° to 65° Fahrenheit, strain it through a sieve which has a cloth laid over it, pour the whole into theTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 473 gyle-tun (for which the mash-tun may be used, after being cleared out and rinsed with water,) add the yeast, and, having covered up the vessel, let it stand in a mo- derately warm place. When the heat of the atmosphere is more than 60°, the cool of the night must be chosen to put the beer to work. In lower degrees of the atmo- sphere, the wort must be set at a greater heat than that of the air; when the air is at 50°, the beer may be set to work at 50°. It should rather be set at too low than too high a temperature. A greater proportion of yeast is required in winter than in summer; and beer intended to be kept ten or twelve months, will not require so much as that which is to be used immediately. The ex- tract of one quarter of malt will require, if for keeping, six pints when the atmosphere is at 40°, five at 60°, and three at 80°; but, for those who are not disposed to 6tudy all these particulars, the proportion is one quart of good stiff yeast to about forty gallons of good strong beer or ale wrort, and one pint and a half to the same quantity of small beer wort. As soon as the yeast is added to the wort, the mix- ture should be stirred for two or three minutes; it is a good practice to set the yeast to ferment before it is wanted, by diluting it with a portion of lukewarm wort, adding more wort as the fermentation proceeds. If the fermentation in the gyle-tun be languid and fee- ble, one or two large stone bottles, filled with hot water, closely corked, may be let down into the tub. The fer- mentation in the gyle-tun is completed when the head of yeast begins to decline in the middle; or, observe when the head of yeast has well risen, skim it off, and repeat the skimming till no more can be separated. The fermentation of a small quantity of beer is usually com- pleted in two days; after the collected yeast has stood a day, the beer that has separated from it may be return- ed to the skimmed liquor. When the fermentation has been apparently completed, draw off the fermented li- quor from the thick sediment in the fermenting vessel, into clean casks, previously rinsed with boiling water;474 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. place them with the bung-holes inclined a little to one side. A slow fermentation will go on, and the same li- quor which overflows from the casks may again (having been received in a vessed placed underneath the casks for that purpose) be used for filling up the barrels, along with any kind of beer that is ready at hand ; it is of great consequence to keep the casks constantly filled. The fer- mentation ceases spontaneously in a few days, (more or less, in proportion to the heat of the atmosphere,) when the casks must be bunged up. If the brewing has been properly conducted, the beer will be clear in fourteen days at farthest; if it be intended to mantle in the glass, it must be bottled off before the insensible fermentation in the cask has ceased, or, at all events, immediately when it has become bright. In warm weather particularly, the casks should be occasionally examined ; if a hissing noise is audible at the bung-hole, the spile may be left in loosely till the liquor has become quiet; or, which is bet- ter, check the fermentation by repeatedly mopping the cask all over with cold water. The beer being well pre- pared, remove it to the place where it is to remain for use ; when placed in the cellar, the bung must be drawn, and the casks filled up quite full with fine beer, skimming off the head from time to time. After being attended in this manner for a day or two, the casks should be bunged tight, and a hole bored with a gimlet near the bung for the vent peg, which should be left rather slack for a day or two. If it be absolutely necessary to fine the beer by artificial means, it may be done by dissolving a small quantity of isinglass in stale sour beer. Beer, when once in a state fit for use, should not be again agitated. It is only requisite that the cask should be tapped at such a distance from the bottom as to allow the beer, particu- larly if it be strong beer, to flow clear of that sediment which may have collected at the lower part of the vessel. Strong beer requires to be six weeks in the cask if the quantity be small; half a hogshead, three or four months before it be bottled ; keeping beer about a fortnight, and email beer, a week.475 THE rilACTICE OF COOKERY. The best seasons for brewing are October and March. Ale and porter should be perfectly transparent before they are bottled. Let the bottles be dry, and leave them, when filled, open for six or eight hours ; then cork them perfectly air-tight with good sound corks. The bottles should be straight-necked, smooth, and even in the mouth, narrowing a very little about the neck where the middle of the cork comes ; one inch and a half of empty space should be left between the liquor and the lower surface of the cork in the bottle.476 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. CHAPTER XXIII. KITCHEN GARDEN. In the following directions for the culture of kitchen vegetables, none are included which, in the climate of Britain, require the aid of artificial heat to bring them to maturity ; as it is presumed, that when such are desired, an educated professional gardener will be employed, to whom, the instructions here submitted, as they must ne- cessarily be of a limited nature, might possibly be of little use. But it is confidently anticipated, that the directions which are given, if closely followed, will be found suffi- cient, in ordinary cases, to procure the desired result. In choosing the situation most suitable for a kitchen garden, it will be necessary to regard the aspect, or exposure, of the ground; a southern exposure being always considered much better than any other; and a gentle declivity in that direction being very desirable. It should be screen- ed to the north and west by a plantation of forest trees ; and, on these sides, the trees may be less than a hundred yards from the garden; but to the south and east, there should be no tall trees, at least within a considerable distance. It is necessary, also, that there should be a sufficient supply of water within reach; and standing,THE PRACTICE'OF COOKERY. 477 or soft water, is always to be preferred to that taken immediately from a spring or well. The best general soil for a garden is a loam of a mid* dling quality, partaking more of the sandy than the clayey nature. If a strong and a light soil can both be had, it will be so much the better, as the different plants may thus have the ground best adapted to their respective kinds. Cabbages. The best soil for cabbages is a rich mould, rather clayey than sandy; and it can scarcely be too much manured, as they are an exhausting crop. The kinds generally preferred for summer use, are, the small early dwarf, large curly Yorkshire, early dwarf Yorkshire, early Battersea, and early sugar loaf. These are ready for use from April or May to July; for autumn and winter, the imperial, large sugar-loaf, hollow sugar-loaf, and the long or large-sided. The large Drum, white Strasburg, the Scots, and the American cabbage, resist the severity of winter, and grow to a very large size ; but they are coarse kinds. The time of sowing for the summer crop is the beginning of the August of the preceding year. An open spot of rich light earth must be chosen, and the seeds of this, and of all the kale tribe, require a covering of no more than an eighth, or a quarter of an inch, in thickness of mould. In about six or eight weeks after the sowing, or when the plants have got several leaves, they are thinned ; and those plants taken out of the seed- bed are pricked into other beds, at three inches distance every way. By these means, they have room to grow firm and shapely. In October and November, part of this crop is finally planted out, the remainder early in478 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. the following spring; arul the plants are set in rows be- tween two and three feet wide, and two feet asunder in the rows. As the cabbages advance, the earth in the rows must be stirred, and drawn round the plants ; indeed the oftener the earth is stirred the better will be the crop. In the end of April or beginning of May, the early cabbages begin to turn in their leaves, and to harden in the centre, when, if the leaves be bound close with willow twigs, or strands of bass-matting, they will be fit for use a fortnight the earlier. If the roots and stems of a portion of this crop be allowed to remain af- ter the tops are cut off, and the ground delved, and per- haps manured in autumn, very fine cabbages will be produced in the January and February following. For autumn and rvinter use, the seeds of cabbages are sown in the end of February or beginning of March, pricked out into shady borders in May, and allowed to remain there for some weeks. In June, they are finally trans- planted, at the same distance as the early kinds. These cabbages come to be fit for use in the autumn months, and continue good, in sheltered situations, and in ordinary seasons, till February or March. Of the red cabbages, the dwarf dark-red kind is considered the best; it may be sown about the end of August, and planted out in the beginning of April. The white Strasburg is the va- riety of which the Germans chiefly make their sour krout. The long or large-sided cabbage being rather tender, should not be sown till May, nor planted out till July. Savoys. The principal sorts are the yellow and the green ; the latter being considered the hardiest. They are sowm about the middle of April, and planted out in June, considerably closer than the common cabbage. If savoys be wanted before winter, the seed must be sown in February, or even in the autumn before: in the last case, fine large plants will be ready for the table in Sep- tember or October. The later crop affords a supplyTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 479 till February or March. Savoys are reckoned better when somewhat pinched by the frost. If cabbages be planted, year after year, in the same ground, they will become sickly and stunted ; it is there- fore advisable to change the cabbage ground every year. Open Kale. Young plants of the common cabbage are now ge- nerally used as coleworts; for this purpose, either the I sugar loaf or the large York are sown about the middle or end of June, and planted out in the end of July, or beginning of August, to be ready for use in winter. Scots Kale Is sown in the beginning of July ; and in the course of the month of August, the young plants are set out in rows a foot and a half wide, and ten inches distance in the rows. This green will not be tender until it have endured some sharp frosts. When kale is planted out, it will be necessary to give water to the roots, should the weather be dry: no other attention is requisite, except that of drawing the earth to the stems before winter. Brussels Sprouts Are sown in March or April; the seedlings planted out in June preferring showery weather, or watering care- fully at the root: they are earthed up in October, and are ready for use by midwinter. As they grow upright, they may be planted closer than other kinds of greens. Cauliflower. The seed of the early crop of cauliflower is sown about the 20th of the August of the preceding year in beds. In September the seedlings are pricked into a dry bor- der, near a wall, where they may be hooped over, and defended with bass mats, during the severe frosts of win- ter. In the month of March they are finally planted out, giving water liberally now and afterwards, should the weather be dry. They are planted in rows about two480 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. feet and a half asunder, and two feet apart in the rows; but they must not be set deep in the ground. After this they must have repeated hoeings, and the earth must be drawn close up to the roots and stems. To diversify the time of forming heads, some of the early cauliflowers are planted out on different successive occasions. Cauli- flower will thrive the better that it have liberal supplies of the cleanings of the stable and cow-house. Brocoli. There are many varieties of brocoli; but the most useful kinds are the dwarf sulphur-coloured, and the kind called green brocoli. For an autumn crop, the seed is 6own in April, and planted out in the beginning of June. For a spring crop in the following year, the seed is sown late in May, or even in June; the seedlings are after- wards placed in nursery beds, where they remain till the middle or end of July, when they are finally transplanted in lines, two feet asunder, and a foot and a half apart in the lines. Water is given in dry weather; and they are hoed and earthed up like cauliflower. The heads of win- ter brocoli generally appear early in January, and con- tinue till April. A light and deep, but rich soil, in an open situation, is to be preferred for them. Sea weed is a useful manure for brocoli, and will prevent the grubs infesting its roots. Kohl-rabbi. Of the kohl-rabbi, or turnip-rooted cabbage, there are two varieties; the one having the stem swelling above ground ; the other having this turnip-like protuberance in it. i his plant may be cultivated in the same manner as brocoli; it is very hardy. Turnip. Most sorts of turnip like a sandy soil, not recently manured; but the yellow Dutch turnip does best in a good soil. For a spring crop the early Dutch is usually preferred; it may be sown, broadcast, in the month of43 l THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. i April, mixing a little fine earth with the seed to make it divide more equally. A small sowing of this kind may be made every month, from April to August, in order to have them throughout the summer in a young state for I the table. For a winter crop, the yellow Dutch turnip is considered superior to any other kind; it is sown thickly about the middle of July ; and, if rain do not oc- cur, frequent watering will be necessary. When the root leaves are about an inch broad, the young plants are thinned to within six or eight inches distance from each other. To prevent the ravages of the turnip-fly, it is ad- visable to dust quick-lime lightly over the crop while it is in the seed-leaf. Should the young plants threaten to i run to flower, they may be trodden down, by gently pla- cing the foot on the centre of the plant. If turnips be al- lowed to remain in the ground throughout the winter, the top leaves form excellent greens early in spring. The Swedish, the stone, and the yellow, are all likewise good 11 winter turnips. Carrot.' Carrots thrive best in a light soil, with a mixture of sand ; it should be delved very deep, or even trenched, and, at the same time, well broken with the spade. Pigeon’s dung added to the carrot ground promotes their health, by preventing the attacks of insects ; when any other manure is used, it should be buried deep, that the roots may not touch it. In general, it is best to make the carrots the second crop after manuring. For the prin- cipal crop, the orange carrot, or the red or field carrot, are preferred; it is sown in March or April—in light soils not till the end of April or beginning of May. The seeds must be rubbed between the hands with some dry sand to separate them ; and, as they are very light, a calm day must bo chosen ; they should bo trodden in before raking. When the plants come up, several successive hoeings are given ; at first with a three inch, and latterly with a six inch hoe. The plants are thinned either by 2 HTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 482 drawing young plants for use, or by hoeing till they are within eight or ten inches of each other, if broadcast; but if in drills, which should be a foot apart, till they are six or seven inches separate. If the hoeing is not done in showery weather, a regular watering must be given after the operation. For an early crop, the early horn-carrot is used ; it is sown before the first of February in a warm border, which must be hooped over, and covered with mats during frost. A bed of the late horn-carrot may be sown in June or July, to afford young roots in the autumn months. Carrots are taken up at the first approach of winter, cleaned, and stored up with sand in a place that will exclude the frost. Parsnip. This plant requires a stronger soil than the carrot; it prefers a light loam ; but any soil will do, provided it be pretty deep. The seed, which should never be more than a year old, is sown in March; the plants are after- wards thinned out to about eight or ten inches asunder, and are kept clear of weeds. When the leaves begin to decay, the roots are fit for use. They may be stored as carrots; or, as frost will not injure them, they may be allowed to remain in the ground till the beginning of February ; but not longer, as then the flower-stalks be- gin to form, when the roots would become stringy. Scorzonera. The seeds of scorzonera are sown in the middle of April, in a cool deep soil, in drills about a foot separate. Afterwards the plants are thinned out to within four inches apart. The roots may be either lifted in November, and stored as carrots, or they may remain in the ground all winter. Salsify. Salsify is sown in April, and afterwards thinned to within six or eight inches apart. A mellow and deep *oil affords the best plants. The roots may remain inTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 483 the ground, and be taken up as wanted throughout the winter. Skirret. A light deep soil is most suitable for the skirret, and should it be naturally moist, so much the better. In dry soils, or in long continued droughts, watering is advi- sable. The seeds are sown in April, and repeated thin- ning and hoeing are necessary. When the leaves begin to decay in autumn, the roots are fit for use ; they will not be injured by frost, and may therefore remain in the ground till wanted. Red Beet. Red beet requires a light, but rich soil, of considera- ble depth, that has not recently been manured. The ground should be trenched, or very deeply delved, and broken small with the spade. The seed is sown in April, in drills an inch deep, and fifteen inches asunder. In autumn, beet-root is generally stored amongst sand in a cellar, or some place that will completely exclude the frost. In lifting it, great care must be taken that the roots be not anywise injured or broken, as they bleed much; for the same reason, the leaves must be cut off at least an inch above the top of the root. White Beet. This kind of beet is cultivated only for its leaves, which are used as spinach. The seeds are sown in the beginning of March, in an open spot of ground. When the plants have put out four leaves, they are hoed, and thinned out to at least four inches asunder. A month afterwards a second hoeing is given, leaving the plants about eight inches separate. The outer leaves being first picked off for use, a succession is afforded for the whole season. Jerusalem Artichoke. This plant is propagated by means of the tubeus,434 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. which are cut in the manner of potato-sets, and planted, in any light soil and open situation, in the end of March. They are placed in rows three feet asunder, and a foot or fifteen inches apart in the rows. In September they are fit for use, and may be left in the ground, and dug up as wanted throughout the winter, being best when newly raised. Potato. The varieties of the potato are very numerous ; and as no particular kind will continue in perfection much more than fourteen years, new kinds are continually suc- ceeding those that have worn out. At present, for a summer crop, the ash-leaved, early dwarf, and champion, are esteemed; and, for the winter crop, the American, large and small, and the kidney, are excellent. They will thrive in any light soil, in a free, airy situation ; and if quantity of produce be particularly desired, too much manure can hardly be given; but they will be of a more delicate flavour from ground not recently enriched. The potato is propagated by cuts of the tubeus, leaving one or two eyes or buds to each cut, and eradicating all clus- tered eyes. The best shaped and cleanest potatoes are selected for this purpose ; and the cuts are the better for being allowed to dry for a day or two before planting. They are planted in drills, and covered to the depth of three or four inches; and for the early crop, which may be planted in a light warm border, about the beginning or middle of March, sixteen inches between the lines, and seven or eight inches between each plant, is sufficient; but, for the principal crop, which must be planted about the middle or end of April, two feet is allowed between the rows, and from ten to fifteen inches between the plants. The only attention the crop requires is hoeing, and drawing the earth to the stems. The oftener this last operation is performed, the greater will be the pro- duce. The early planted potatoes will be fit for use in June and July. Only a few of them should be taken up st a time, as they will not keep good beyond a day orTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 485 two. In autumn the principal crop will be known to be ripe, when the tops of the plants change to a yellow colour; they should then be taken up, and stored in as clean and dry a state as possible. The best way of keep- ing them is in heaps on the ground, covering well with straw and earth, So as completely to exclude the frost. Peas. If peas be sown in newly-enriched ground, they will be apt to run to haums ; they are therefore seldom sown till the second year after manuring. Some of the early kinds, as the Charleton, golden, and Reading, are gene- rally sown towards the end of October, in front of a south wall; and if slightly protected by means of branches of evergreens, or old peas-haum, the crop will survive the winter, and produce young peas by the end of May. In January and February, more of the early sorts are sown for a succession ; and in March and April, full crops of the later peas must be sown. Some of the smaller late kinds, as the blue Prussian, dwarf marrowfat, Spanish dwarf, and Leadman’s dwarf, if well earthed up, and the rows not too near each other, may do without sticking. Of the large and late kinds, the tall marrowfat, green marrowfat, grey rounceval, and the sugar pea, have long retained their character. The larger kinds require nearly four feet distance between the rows. The young plants are frequently hoed ; when they are three or four inches high, the earth is drawn to the rows ; and when about eight or ten inches high, they must be sticked ; the smallest kinds may have sticks three feet, the early sorts and dwarf marrowfats five feet, and the larger sorts seven or eight feet high. When branches for sticking cannot be procured, two lines of strong pack thread, on each side of the rows, may be substituted. To prevent the attacks of mice, it is necessary to be careful in sowing peas, that none be left exposed on the surface of the ground.THE PRACTICE OF COOKE RT. 4-8 6 Beans. The early sorts, such as the Mazagon and Lisbon, are sown in the end of October, in front of a wall or hedge. The plants are earthed up in November, as they advance; but, in earthing up beans, it is necessary to be very careful that the earth do not fall on the centre of the plant. In severe frost some haum or fern is laid over them. In March and April, as they begin to show flower, they are kept close to the fence by means of pack- thread ; and, in order to forward the production of pods, when the lower blossoms begin to fade, the tops of the steins are pinched off. In February and March, full crops of the late and large beans, as the Windsor, Sand- wich, and long podded, are planted in drills two inches deep, allowing two and a half or three feet between the rows. Kidney, or French Bean. The dwarf kidney-bean requires no support from sticks, but, as it is tender, must be sown before the mid- dle or end of April; it may then be sown in drills, from two to three feet asunder, and about three inches sepa- rate in the lines, covering with something less than two inches of soil. As the plants advance, they are hoed and cleared of weeds, a little earth being, at the same time, drawn to the stems. The most esteemed kinds are, the speckled dwarf, early black or negro, and early white dwarf. The scarlet runner, being more tender than the dwarf kinds, must not be sown till about the middle of May ; and, as tall slight stakes must be placed for it to climb upon, the distance between the rows is general- ly four feet. The kidney-beans like a good, light, rich soil. Spinach. There are two kinds of spinach ; the prickly-seeded, for winter, and the smooth-seeded, for summer use. The winter crop is sown, either in drills or broadcast, in theT1IE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 487 beginning of August, when rains may be expected. A light, dry, but rich soil, in a sheltered situation, is desi- rable. When the plants show four leaves, the ground around them is hoed, and the spinach moderately thin- ned ; the hoeing is repeated as the weeds grow. In February, when a few dry days may occur, the surface of the ground is stirred, the plants cleaned, and again thinned out. With this mode of treatment, and with due attention, the winter spinach should afford succes- sive gatherings, from November, and, in mild weather, throughout the winter, till April or May. The first sowing of the summer spinach is made in a sheltered border in January. If sown broadcast, it is first thinned out to three inches, and at subsequent hoeings, to eight or ten inches apart. Successive sowings are made in February, March, and April; and these are at once thinned out to six or eight inches apart. Asparagus. Asparagus is of two kinds ; the red-topped, which produces the larger shoots, and the green-topped, which are considered of the more delicate flavour. The best way of propagating asparagus is by means of seed. In the month of March it is sown in shallow drills, six inches asunder, and earthed in from half an inch to an inch deep. The young plants are kept as free of weeds as possible during the summer; and in the end of Oc- tober, some litter is spread over the surface of the ground to protect them from frost. In the following spring, about April, the seedlings are transplanted to the quarter in which they are to remain. The soil of this quarter must not be less than two and a half feet deep ; it should be light, but rich; damp ground, or a wet subsoil, would be very unsuitable; nothing is better than a sandy loam well mixed with rotten dung, or sea-weed; and before planting a bed, it should be well trenched over to the depth of the soil, burying abundance of manure in the bottom. The seedling plants are cautiously raised with a narrow- pronged fork ; and when they are taken up, the rootsTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 488 are kept in a little earth till replanted; they being very apt to be injured by exposure to the air. A trench, about six inches deep, being prepared, the roots are care- fully laid in, a foot distant from each other, the buds or crowns being kept upright, and about two inches be- low the surface. A foot between each ordinary trench is reckoned sufficient, but between every four rows a double distance is left for an alley. In dry weather the new-planted beds should be carefully watered. Several hoeings, generally three, are given in the course of the summer. In the end of September, the haum decays, and is cut away; and small stable-dung or sea-weed is spread on the bed, previously stirring the surface with a fork. In spring, just before the buds begin to appear, the intervals of the beds are slightly delved over with the narrow-pronged fork, raking afterwards, with great delicacy of hand. The same practice, both for autumn and spring, is observed for the second year, it being only in the third year after planting out, or the fourth from the time of sowing, that cutting for the table is begun. In April a few shoots may generally be cut; in May and June they will be plentiful. In the first productive sea- son only the large shoots are taken, but in subsequent years all the shoots are gathered as they advance till the end of the month of June. Shoots, two inches under ground, and three or four above, are the best for the table ; and in cutting them, some of the earth is first re- moved in order to avoid the succeeding buds below. An asparagus quarter should not contain less than a fall of ground, as it often takes that quantity to furnish a good dish at one time. Sea Kale. The best mode of propagating sea-kale is by sowing it. The soil intended for it should be sandy and light, but mixed with fine rich mould; and of all manures for this crop, drift-ware or sea-weed is the best. The ground must be trenched at least two feet deep, and in March the seed is sown, about two inches deep ; they489 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. may be set in a triangular form, six inches apart, leaving a space of two feet between the triangles. To ensure a produce, it may be as well to drop in two or more seeds into each hole, and to thin out afterwards the super- fluous plants. For the first summer no attention will be required in the culture, except that of keeping the plants clear of weeds. In November the whole bed is covered with rotten stable-litter, as is done with asparagus. Du- ring the second year the same plan is followed. In the third year most of the plants will be strong enough to be blanched for use; this is done by placing blanching covers over the plants as soon as the leaves are decayed in the end of autumn, and then covering up the whole bed with stable-dung, packing it closely between the pots, and heaping it over the tops of them to the depth of six inches or more. By this mode the sea-kale will be fit for cutting in January and February. If the heat of the litter at any time decline, which may be easily as- certained by introducing a thermometer into several of the blanching pots, some new stable-dung must be mix- ed with it. The blanching pots, mentioned above, are made for the purpose; they have movable covers that fit down closely, and they are nearly as wide at top as at bottom, in order to give room for cutting such shoots as may be ready, without breaking the others. It is ne- cessary to have from thirty to fifty of such covers. A less expensive mode of blanching is, by covering the sea- kale beds to the depth of a foot and a half with leaves as they fall from the trees in autumn, adding, over all, a very slight layer of long stable-litter to prevent the leaves being blown about. In this manner the shoots will be very sweet and tender ; but they will not be produced so early as by the former method. Onions. The soil for onions should be light, and not recently manured ; it should be well delved and broken fine, and exactly levelled. There are several varieties in use, but the Strasburg may be mentioned as being as good as any.490 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. For the principal crop, the seed is sown in February or the beginning of March; but, should the land be heavy, it is better to defer the sowing till the end of March or beginning of April. The seed is Bown broadcast; a very slight covering of earth is given, and the ground is mere- ly smoothed over with the rake. A first hoeing is given when the plants have advanced three or four inches in growth, and they are then thinned out with the hand to about four inches apart. Another hoeing is given about a month or six weeks afterwards, when the plants are singled out to about six inches square. After this the hoe must never be used, but any large weeds must be drawn out with the hand. If the weather be dry at the time of thinning, a plentiful watering must immediately afterwards be given. About the end of August the crop will be known to be ripe by the leaves falling down. The onions are then drawn and laid out on a gravel walk in some dry spot, and occasionally turned. In a fort- night they are generally found to be firm enough for keeping, and must be stored in a dry garret or lolt, ex- cluding them as much as may be from the air. The crop of winter onions is sown in August or beginning of September; they are thinned in the usual way, and weeds must be carefully kept down. In the spring, when the keeping onions fail, part of these may be drawn for use, the remainder will be ready in the early part of summer. About the month of May, any of the stalks which appear to be pushing a flower-stem must be thrown out, and, to check this tendency, the rest of this crop should be laid down, which is done by passing the handle of a rake horizontally along the bed, so as to strike the stems an inch or two above the bulb, and bend them flat down. Winter onions thus managed may be taken up about the end of June, and are generally firm, and keep long. For pickling, the small silver-skinned variety is best; they should be sown pretty thickly about the middle of April, in light and very poor land, as they are not required of a large size for this purpose; they need not be thinned,THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 491 unless when they rise absolutely in clusters. They will be lit for use in August. Leek. Leeks are raised much in the same way as onions. There are three varieties of them ; the narrow-leaved or Flanders, the broad-leaved or tall London, and the Scotch or flag-leek ; this last is by much the most hardy. They are, about the beginning of March, sown closely in beds, and in June or July are planted out in rows, first trim- ming oft" the tips of the leaves and the points of the fi- brous roots. A good way is, to make a deep hole with a dibble, and merely lay in the leek plant up to the leaves without closing the earth about it; this encourages the stem to swell and lengthen, while at the same time it blanches it. But this plan may be adopted only in moist weather, or the plants must be well watered, to ensure their taking root. If the leaves be topped two or three times during the summer, the leeks will grow to a larger size. They are ready for use in autumn and winter. Cibol. Cibols are raised from seeds, which are sown in July. The seedling plants soon appear; but, in the course of the month of October, the leaves go oft", and the ground seems quite bare. In January, however, they again be- gin to shoot, and by March they are fit for use. Chives. Chives are readily propagated by parting the roots, either in autumn or spring, and they will grow in any soil or situation. They should be repeatedly cut during the summer, the successive leaves produced in this way being more tender. A small bed or border thus ma- naged will afford a sufficient supply ; it will continue pro- ductive for three or four years, when a new plantation should be made.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 492 Garlic. Garlic has a bulbous root, made up of a dozen or fifteen smaller bulbs, called cloves ; it is propagated by detaching the cloves, and planting them. The soil should be light and dry, well delved, and broken fine. The sets are placed four inches distant from each other in every direction, and between two and three inches deep. The smaller the cloves, the more healthy and productive will be the plants. They are put in in February or March ; about the middle of June the leaves are tied in knots, to prevent the stronger plants from running to flower. The crop is taken up in August, when the leaves begin to wither. The roots are tied in bunches, and hung in a dry room for use. Slialot. The culture of the slialot is very similar to that of garlic. They are planted about the middle of October, the ground having been previously manured with old well-rotted dung, mixed with house ashes. The crop is taken up in the end of summer, when the leaves become discoloured, and the bulbs are hung up in nets, in a cool airy place, for use. Artichoke. Artichokes may be planted in any open situation. They are propagated by means of rooted slips, or suckers, taken off at the time of the spring dressing, in the begin- ning of April. They like a light loam, cool, but dry, and which is at the same time rich and deep. In preparing for this crop, the soil should be trenched to the depth of three feet, and manure should be liberally supplied at the bottom of the trench. The plants may be placed four feet apart every way; and at the end of the first season after planting, a small and late crop of artichokes may generally be cut in October. In the second year they will be plentiful; and in autumn, as soon as all the heads are gathered, the whole 6talks are broken downTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 493 close to tlie ground. In November a portion of earth is drawn towards each plant, and some long dung, peas- haum, or the like, is laid around, but kept at some dis- tance from the stems and leaves of the plants. In March or April, the litter and earth are removed, the stocks are examined, and two or three of the strongest and best shoots being selected for growing up, the rest are detach- ed. Every season, at the winter dressing, some small rotted dung or fresh sea-weed should be dug into the ground. It is advisable to renew the artichoke planta- tion every six years. Cardoon. The best soil for cardoons is one that is light, and not too rich, but it ought to be deep. The seed is sown in the middle or end of May, in small hollows, about three inches deep, and four feet distant from each other every way. Two or three seeds are placed in each hollow to ensure a crop, but only the strongest plant is allowed to remain. The cardoon requires a good deal of water, and in very dry weather, this should be copiously supplied. In September, when the leaves will be large, they are tied up with hay or straw bands for blanching, leaving on- ly the top free, but a dry day must be selected for the pur- pose ; at the same time a hillock of earth is formed around each plant to the height of a foot or eighteen inches, and this is smoothed on the surface that the rain may run off, and not fall into the centre of the plants. As they ad- vance in growth, additional bands of straw are added, and the earth is raised higher. They will be ready for use in two months after the commencement of the blanching. In severe frost, the tops are covered with haum or long litter. Lettuce. Of each of the two kinds of lettuce, the coss, also call- ed the Roman and ice, and the cabbage lettuce, there are many varieties. Of the coss lettuces, the Egyptian green, the white coss or Versailles, and the royal cape lettuce,494' THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. are esteemed; of the cabbage lettuces, the imperial and grand admiral, or admiral. The large Roman and the Cilicia lettuces are those chiefly used in soups. The seed is sown broadcast, and merely raked into the ground. A small sowing may be made in January, the seedlings being transplanted in March. A considerable crop is sown in the end of February, and the principal sowing i3 in March and April. A part of each crop should be re- gularly transplanted to come in season immediately after those left in the seed-bed ; they are fittest for transplant- ing when they have four or six leaves; and they are pla- ced from ten to fifteen inches apart, according to the size they are likely to attain. To forward the cabbaging of coss lettuce, the leaves may be tied together in the man- ner practised with endive. If the winter be not very se- vere, lettuces will stand without much injury, close by the foot of a south wall, and be fit for use in January, Fe- bruary, and March. Endive. The green curled-leaved and the white curled-leaved are the best kinds; the green curled-leaved,being the most hardy, is used for the latest crops. The 6eed, which must be scattered thinly, is sown some time between the middle of May and middle of June ; another sowing is made in July. When the seedlings are three or four inches high, they are transplanted into a well-prepared bed of rich soil, in rows a foot asunder, at the distance of ten inches from each other in the row. In dry weather, watering is necessary. The blanching must next be commenced ; it is accomplished, when the plants are perfectly dry, by tying up the heads with strands of bass-mat; some nicety is requisite in gathering the leaves together in regular order, 60 as not to cross each other, and in rejecting such leaves as are unhealthy. The plants are, at first, tied two inches below the top, afterwards about the middle of the plant. In three weeks or a month they will be found to be sufficiently blanched ; but as they will con- tinue in this state fit for use only a fortnight, a fewTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 495 plants must be tied up every week in order to their be- ing ready for use in succession. After October, the mode adopted is, to make some trenches, and to sink the plants in them nearly to the head, where they will become sufficiently blanched in four or five weeks. Additional plants may be sunk in the trenches every fortnight when the weather happens to be so mild and dry as to permit it. Endive thus blanched in the earth must be dug out with the spade. Celery. There are two varieties, one with hollow, the other with solid stalks; the solid stalk is generally preferred; an- other variety, with large red stalks, is also esteemed. Cele- ry must be sown at several different times, in order to ensure a succession of plants fit for transplanting at various seasons. The first sowing is commonly made about the end of March or beginning of April, in a sheltered bor- der ; the next about the beginning of May, on a moist border. About the end of April, the plants of the first sowing will be ready for pricking into nursery beds of rich earth, in which they may stand three or four inches separate. Water is given, and the plants are shaded from the sun for a few days. A quantity of every suc- cessive sowing should be thus pricked out, in order to strengthen them. Towards the end of May, the most forward plants may be transplanted into trenches for blanching. In dry weather, at this season, water is given freely both to the transplanted plants and those left in the seed-bed. The usual mode of transplanting and blanching is the following : Trenches are formed at the distance of three or four feet from each other, a foot and a half wide, and about a foot in depth. The soil in the bottom of this trench is delved and worked fine, and a little rotten dung is mixed with it. The soil for celery should be deep and rich, somewhat moist, yet of a light nature. The earth taken from the trench is laid in ridges on each side, ready to be drawn in as wanted. The plants, having the tops of the long leaves cut off, and anyTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 496 side shoots removed, are placed in the bottom of the trenches, at the distance of four or five inches from each other ; as they advance in growth, the earth is drawn in towards them, perhaps once in ten days, taking care to do this in dry weather, and not to cover the centre of the plants with soil. When the plants rise considerably above the surface of the ground, the earth laid in ridges will be exhausted-; a new trench must therefore now be opened between each row, for a supply of soil to conti- nue the earthing up till the leaf stalks of the celery be blanched to the length of from eight to fourteen inches. The last sowing is destined to stand the winter, and the soil into which this is finally transplanted should be as dry as possible. In severe weather, peas-haum or loose litter is thrown over the beds. In lifting tbe plants for use, it is proper to dig deep, that the main root may not be injured. Garden Cress and Mustard. These may be sown, thickly, in close drills, on a warm border, at the bottom of a south wall, about the middle of March. Throughout the summer they should be sown once a-fortnight, as they are used only while quite young and tender. Besides the plain sort of gar- den cress, there is a variety with curled leaves, which, being the more hardy of the twro, may be sown later in the season. This kind requires to be thinned out to half an inch asunder. The white mustard is the best kind for sowing along with the garden cress, and for using in salad. # French and Common Sorrel. The French sorrel thrives best in a light sandy soil. It is easily propagated by means of offset's or by seeds ; if in the first way, the plants are placed a foot apart. The only attention the crop requires is that of cutting off the flower-stems in the month of July. The plants should be renewed every four or five years. Common 3497 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. sorrel thrives best in a shady border. It is easily raised from seed sown early in spring. Radish. There are the spindle-rooted and turnip-rooted ra- dishes ; of the turnip-rooted variety, there is a white and a red kind. - The short-topped purple or the pink radish, both spindle-rooted, may be sown for the earliest crop in the beginning of November, in a sheltered border; and they w'ill be ready for drawing early in March. More seed is sown in December and January, and sowings are con- tinued once a fortnight until April, in order to secure a succession of young roots. Any sort of soil will suit this plant. In the end of March, should the weather happen to be very dry, the crops must be regularly watered ; a slight covering of fern is useful early in spring, when sharp frosts occur; it may be raked off in the day timo and restored at night. If radishes are to be drawn small, they may stand at two inches apart; but if it be intended that the roots should grow large, they must be allowed twice that distance. The turnip-rooted radish is sown in February or March, and thinned out with a small hoe to within six inches apart. Indian Cress, or Nasturtium. A fresh, but poor soil, is better for this plant than a rich one. The seeds may be sown in April, in drills about two inches deep. The plants must have a support, as the stalks will grow to the height of six or eight feet. The seeds will be ready for use in August or September. There is a’so a dwarfish variety, which may be allowed to spread on the ground. Burnet. A few plants only of this are sufficient. It may he raised from seeds sown in autumn, or by parting the roots. The stems should be two or three times cut over 2 i in summer.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 498 Horse-Radish. The soil for horse-radish should be rich and deep. It is propagated by cuttings of the knotty parts of the root, provided these be furnished with one or two eyes. They are planted in February or March, in lines, leaving a foot and a half between each line. The sets are placed at the depth of at least a foot. The roots are not used till the second year, and then they are raised only as they are wanted. The bed will last for four or five years, care be- ing taken, in digging the roots, to leave the original set, or stock, untouched. Parsley. The curled parsley is the preferable variety. It may be raised in drills on the edge of a border. The seeds, which lie for a month or six weeks in the ground before springing, may be sown in February or early in March. In order to have fresh parsley leaves throughout the win- ter, some larch or beech branches may be laid over the parsley borders; and in hard weather, above these are spread dry bean-haum, fern, or reeds. Angelica. Angelica is easily raised from seed, which should be sown soon after it is gathered. It grows best in a moist soil, and thrives exceedingly well by the side of a ditch. Though a biennial plant, it may be made to con- tinue for several years, by cutting down the flower stem before it ripen to seed. Rhubarb. The kind cultivated for the table is called monk’s rhubarb. It is propagated by means of offsets, which should be planted any time between November and Fe- bruary, in good soil, at the distance of three feet from each other. If the rhubarb plants be covered in No- vember with a good deal of stable-litter, the leaves will499 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. shoot up very early in spring, and their stalks will be improved by the blanching they will in this way receive. HERBS. Sage. The red kind is preferred for kitchen use; and the lighter and poorer the soil is, the better will the sage plants stand the winter. It is propagated in the spring by slips, and in the summer by cuttings. The cuttings should be five or six inches long, stripped of all the lower leaves, and plunged nearly to the top in the earth, being at the same time well watered. The plants should be removed every three or four years. Clary. Clary is propagated by seeds sown in spring, trans- planting the seedlings, in the summer months, to fifteen inches apart. Mints. Spearmint is the kind required for culinary purposes, peppermint being little used except for distilling. These mints like a moist soil, and are readily propagated by slips in spring, by parting the roots in autumn, and by means of cuttings in summer. In the latter end of sum- mer, when the spearmint is coming into flower, it may be gathered, dried gradually in the shade, and kept for winter use. As mint plants are sometimes destroyed in very severe frost, it is advisable to cover them slightly with peas-haum or fern before winter, 3THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 500 Thyme. Thyme grows best in a light dry soil that has not been recently manured ; it is propagated by parting the roots, planting slips, or by sowing the seed in spring, Marjoram. Sweet-marjoram, or knotted-marjoram, is propa- gated by seed, a little of which should be sown every spring. Pot-marjoram is easily propagated by slips or cuttings, and is sufficiently hardy to withstand our win- ters. Winter sweet-marjoram requires a sheltered bor- der and a dry soil. It is a perennial plant, and is propa- gated by parting the roots in autumn. For winter use, both the kinds of sweet-marjoram should be dried slowly in the shade, and afterwards hung up in a dry place. Savory. Winter-savory is propagated by slips, or by cut- tings of the young roots, and also by seeds. It is hardy, and continues good for several years, especially in poor soils. Summer savory must be sown every spring, in shallow drills, thinly; the drills being eight or nine inches apart. Tarragon. In a dry loamy soil, tarragon proves quite a hardyplant; but it is apt to perish in a wet situation. It is easily propagated by parting the roots, or by planting in the spring young shoots with only two or three fibres. Tansy. Tansy is extremely hardy, and will grow in any soil. It is easily propagated at any season by parting the roots. Hyssop. A poor dry soil is most suitable to hyssop. It may501 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. be propagated in the spring months by seeds, by rooted slips, and by cuttings. Costmary. Costmary does best in a dry soil. It is propagated by parting the roots in autumn. Rosemary. Rosemary is easily propagated by slips or cuttings in spring. It should be planted in a dry soil, in a sheltered situation ; but if its roots enter the crevices at the base of an old wall, the plant will not be injured by the seve- rest frosts. Lavender. Lavender is propagated by cuttings, in young slips, any time in the spring months. It should be planted in a dry, gravelly, or poor soil. Balm. Balm is readily propagated by parting the roots, pre- serving two or three buds to each piece; or by slips, either in autumn or spring. In order to have young leaves all the summer, some of the stalks should be cut down every month. The balm plantation need not be renewed oftener than every third or fourth tear. Coriander. The seeds of coriander should be sown in autumn, and the plants afterwards thinned out to five or six inches asunder. Caraway. The caraway is a biennial plant, and should be sown soon after the seed is ripe, in autumn, thinning out the plants the next spring, to within four or six inches apart. A moist soil suits the caraway the best.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 502 Samphire. Samphire is not easily cultivated; it seems to suc- ceed best in a rich light soil, having sand and gravel mix- ed with it. It must be in a well-sheltered situation, and requires to be freely watered in dry weather, till the roots have struck deep among the soil. If a few plants can be induced to take root in an old wall, or on an ar- tificial rock-work, they will have a good chance of re- maining.i303 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. CHAPTER XXIV. ON BEES. The Apiary Should be situated so that the hives may have as much sun, and shelter from the wind, as possible. A few low trees or shrubs may be planted in the vicinity, to arrest the flight of the swarms, but all rubbish and noxious weeds must be carefully removed. The hives should be placed on pedestals, about two feet from the ground, and never less than five or six yards from each other. Of whatever form they be made, the material best suited for their construction is straw. When a hive is to he purchased, let it be chosen in the middle of the day; that which has the greatest number of bees going in with yellow pellets attached to their legs may be selected for farther examination. The interior should be crowded with bees, the comb of a yellow hue, and the side ones filled; if there be many queen cells, which are like small in- verted acorns attached to the sides of the combs, or if the wings of the bees should be ragged or torn, the hive is certainly old, and ought to be rejected. If a hive is to be purchased in spring, its weight should not be less than fifteen pounds; if in autumn, not less than thirty; and if it is a stock hive, the weight should not be less than forty pounds. A good hive having been selected, it may be removed in the evening, and placed on its single pedestal, but it should not be plastered to the stool. The stand on which the hive is placed should be cleanedTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 504 four times in the year, and sprinkled with salt. Damp- ness is very injurious to bees; in winter, therefore, the snow must be carefully brushed off the hives, and while it continues upon the ground, the bees must be confined. Should they at this season become unhealthy, a renova- tion of air may be beneficial, and were the hives to re- main an hour turned up, it would be rather an advantage than otherwise. Where there is not a little running stream in the neighbourhood of the apiary, troughs with water should be placed near the hives. They may be made of stone or wood, the wood well pitched, of eight or ten in- ches in depth, and sunk in the earth. A few inches of mould may be put in the bottom, and some water cresses planted therein, to preserve the purity of the water, with which they should be constantly supplied ; or, put one or two pieces of wood in a basin of water, and place it near the hive. Spring and autumn are the seasons for feeding the weak hives, beginning in February if the weather be fine. The food most approved of for them is a sirup composed of sugar or treacle, ale, and salt, in the proportion of two pints of ale to a pound of sugar, and about half an ounce of salt, the whole to be boiled a quarter of an hour, and carefully skimmed ; when cold, it should be bottled, cork- ed, and to prevent its candying, kept for use in a warm, place. In the beginning of the season, a little port- wine incorporated with the food, may prevent dysentery. When the bees to be fed are in a plain cottage hive, an eek must be provided, of the same diameter as the hive. When the sun is set, and the bees all returned from the fields, let the hives be gently raised, and the eek placed on the stool; fill an empty comb with the food, place it in the cell, and replace the hive upon it; the bees will be less disturbed, if a slip of the eek be made to open, large enough to admit the piece of comb. It should be remo- ved on the following morning, if the cold has not prevented their taking their usual supply in the night. Should that be the case, shut them up for a day or two, to prevent the mischief which would occur from strange bees en-503 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. tering the hive while it is feeding, or remove the weak hive to a considerable distance. A well-peopled hive will require about two pounds of sirup in the month. A new swarm ought always to be put into a new hive, which should be provided in April. Sticks in the inside are unnecessary, but the projecting straws must be singed off. Should any hive in May seem wholly destitute of drones—in Scotland they do not appear till the end of May or beginning of June—watch at the entrance of that hive which appears to have the greatest number of them, and catch forty or fifty, confine them in a box till the even- ing, when they may be easily introduced, and will be most thankfully received by the hive that appears to be without them. To supply a hive with a queen, cut out from some of the other hives that can be got at most easily, a piece of comb that has eggs in it; turn up the queeidess hive, and with the left hand, shed two of the combs a little asunder, then with the right hand put in the piece of comb between them, observing that the cells be put in the hive in the same order as in their na- tive hive, that is, the cells that were uppermost to be so still; then let the hand be removed, and the hive replaced. In England, a swarm may be expected in May, but not till June in Scotland ; preceding the swarm- ing may be observed, amongst other signs, small drops of perspiration at the entrance, and when the bees cluster on the outside of the hive, the bee-master must be con- stantly on the watch. In general, they will swarm with the first sunshine ; but if they continue to lie out when the weather is favourable, a little water may be squirted on them. The swarm once on the wing, it should never be lost sight of. Ringing of bells, and other noises, are more likely to do harm than good. It is unnecessary to prepare the hive with any thing sweet or odoriferous ; but if the swarm does not remain in one hive, give them an- other. The easiest situation for hiving a swarm is that in which the hive can be held under the swarm, and the hoes shaken into it. In all cases, a goose tving will be found of essential service to brush the bees off the post into the hive; but great care must be taken that none of the knotsTHE PRACTICE' OE COOKERY. 50G of bees wliich may contain the queen bee, drop upon the ground. The hive, when the bees have been all shaken or brushed into it, should be placed on the board, and left near the place of the swarm’s first settling, until the even- ing, when it should be carefully removed and placed on a pedestal, at some distance from the parent hive. A se- cond swarm may generally be looked for on the eighth or tenth day after the first; sometimes sooner, but never later than the twelfth day after. The day before the de- parture of the second swarm, the call of the queen bees may be distinctly heard; the note of the one is loud and clear, that of the other, the young queen, is lower, but equally distinct, and totally different from the hum of the other bees. As they give no other signal of their second swarming, it is necessary to keep a vigilant watch over the hives, to ascertain from which the swarm de- parts. It is generally necessary to return the second swarm to the parent hive immediately. They are seldom or never worth preserving as a separate colony, except when two fly off’ together, in which case they become, by a union, of little inferior value to a first swarm. Sup- posing the two swarms to have alighted upon separate branches, proceed to shake one of them into the empty hive, and then immediately shake the other into the same, leaving it to the bees to kill the superfluous queen bee, that is, if the proprietor has not the skill or courage to do it. To join two swarms from different hives, it will be necessary to drench both with a mixture of beer, sugar, and water, made lukewarm, or, with the fumigating bel- lows, give them a little smoke from lime leaves or to- bacco. When a second swarm is to be returned to the parent hive, turn down a chair, and place the back paral- lel with the entrance of the hive, over which a sheet or tablecloth may he spread ; then holding the hive contain- ing the second swarm over it, give it a few sharp knocks on the top, and the bees will fall immediately on the cloth ; proceed then, either with the finger or a stick, to guide a few of the bees to the entrance of the parent hive, and they will instantly crowd into it: those whoTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 507 are acquainted with the person of the queen, should take this opportunity of catching her. In regard to a third swarm, it would be folly to keep it. When the weather proves unfavourable after the hiving of a swarm, some food should be administered to the bees at night. When they lie out in clusters, and no more swarms are de- sired, an eek should be placed on the hive. If the heat be very great, it would be advisable to shade the hives, in addition to the common covering of straw, with which they ought always to be provided, as the best protection from the cold in winter, and the heat in summer. A par- ticular value should always be put on those hives that kill their drones the earliest. It sometimes happens that their numbers deter the bees from attempting any violence against them ; therefore, when the other stocks kill their drones, let the bee-master place himself quietly by the side of the hive, in the middle of a fine day, and crush every drone with his finger or a stick, as it passes out or in. Every hive will be the better for a little assistance in this massacre, which may be looked for in the end of July or beginning of August. Instead of following the general plan of suffocating the bees in August, the hives should be removed to the vicinity of a heath, and there allowed to remain from four to six weeks. July is the best season for depri- ving the hives of a part of their store. When a hive is to be robbed of its honey, remove it from the stool to some distance, procure an empty hive, invert it on that from which you wish to dislodge the bees, either to take the honey, or to unite them with another hive. Stop up the entrance, and then strike gently the under hive on the side opposite to that to which the combs are fixed ; in a few minutes, when the anger of the bees may be appeased, a piece of wood should be introduced to keep the two hives about an inch apart on one side, for the purpose of preventing the bees, after being driven up on the one side, descending, which they might do, by the other, to the hive from whence they were dislodged, the knocking on the under hive must be continued,508 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. till the bees, terrified by the noise, take refuge in the upper hive; then, with the fumigating bellows, or com- mon tobacco pipe, blow into the hive a little smoke from lime leaves, or tobacco. The same operation having been performed on the other hive, that is, the hive des- tined to receive the new colony, the dislodged bees are emptied into it, and swept with a brush of feathers into the interstices between the combs; the board being then put upon the hive, it is instantly reverted, and placed upon the stand. When a hive is merely to be deprived of a part of its store, the hive with the bees in it may be placed upon the pedestal from which the full one was removed, and the hive from which the bees have been driven must then be taken into the house. A few bees will be found still straggling about the combs, but they will be too frightened to use their sting. W hen the re- quisite quantity of comb is cut out, breaking it as little as possible, the hive should be cleared of every noxious matter, and returned to its former position ; but first in- vert the hive containing the bees, and place the deprived hive over it; leave them in this situation till the morn- ing, when the bees will be found to have taken posses- sion of their native home. At any season of the year, a weak hive may be strengthened from a strong one, by the following method: Take a strong hive from its pe- destal, and place on it that which has few bees in it; then turning up the strong one, give it several raps on its sides, when many of the bees will fly to their old sta- tion; then place the strong hive where the weak one stood, or the other at a considerable distance. The bee-master, in approaching a hive, should avoid breathing on the bees; and, if his manner be soft, calm, and gentle, he will in general need no protection from being stung; but when swarms are to be united, or hives deprived of a part of their store, the operator should be provided with thick worsted gloves, and a gauze, or piece of thin cloth, such as milk is usually strained through, for the head; this last must be large enough to go over a man’s hat, and round the neck, so as to tie before withTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 501) a string running through a tape or loop-holes; that part which comes next the face must be cut out, and a piece of very open gauze, catgut, or net-work, sewed therein. So protected, the most timid may proceed fear- lessly ; but every one who undertakes the management of the bee, is more or less subject to its sting. No time should be lost in extracting it. Rub the wound briskly with a piece of woollen cloth till it ceases to smart, and apply goulard-water, laudanum, or vinegar and spirits, as may be soonest attained ; or wash with spirit of ammonia, and wrap a piece of linen about the part, steeped in spirits of wine. If the pain continue six hours, put on a hot poul- tice of bread and milk, and change it every four hours. A List of Plants from which the Bees ex- tract the greatest quantity of Honey. Mignonette, heath, furze, white-clover, thyme, par- ticularly lemon thyme, rosemary, balm, beans, and every species of pulse, all resinous trees, borage, wild mus- tard, and golden rod; this last begins to blow when all other flowers have faded, and continues to blow till the middle of November : it will grow in the worst soil, and should be particularly cultivated in the vicinity of an apiary. The Huish Hive Is made of straw, in the form of a flower-pot inverted, but open at both ends, and having a band of straw pro- jecting from the inside about two inches from the top ; upon this band are placed seven bars of well-seasoned wood, about one and a half inch broad, and a quarter of an inch thick ; they are slightly fastened down with small nails, then covered with thin gauze or net-work, and again with a circular board, in which small holes are made, to permit the steam to escape from the body of the hive. The whole to have a convex cover of straw, manufactured as the hive, and made to fit in like the cover of a sauce- pan. At any time or season of the year, when someTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 510 honey-comb is required, or at the end of the season, when the bees are to be deprived of their superfluous store, remove the top and other coverings, and take the side bars out, from which having cut the honey-comb, replace them as before; the operation is facilitated by having some vacant bars ready to supply the places of the full ones. When the bees, by lying out in clusters, indicate that they stand in need of room, instead of an addition at the bottom, as in the common hive, this hive need only be deprived of a part of the comb attached to one or more of the bars. In time of snow, or when robbery is threat- ened, the centre should be closed by a tin wicket, or by a piece of lead with holes made in it to admit air. Another Hive. The hive is formed as the common cottage-hive, be- ing made to separate towards the middle. On the lower division, which may be made the largest, a board is pla- ced, in which one large or some smaller holes are made, to admit of the bees ascending. When the upper part, or top, is filled with honey, it may be removed and re- placed by another prepared for the purpose. Those who wish to see the bees at work, may place a glass top under the straw one, or invert tumblers, or long glasses made for the purpose, over each hole, one or more of which may be removed as they are filled. To Extract the Honey from the Combs. To obtain the primary honey, heat, celerity, and clean- liness, are necessary. Where a few hives only are kept, it will be sufficient to have two or three earthen pans, with a frame of wire adapted to their size, each wire be- ing about one inch distant from another—a corn riddle or flour sieve placed over a tub answers the purpose very well—two horse-hair sieves, a bag of a conical form, that is, wide at top, and tapering to a point at the bottom, made of such canvass as is used in a dairy, and some jars for the reception of the honey, and in which it is to be preserved. The hives should be brought into a warm511 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. room, where no bees nor wasps can enter; the combs are then loosened from the hive by a long thin knife; those parts of the comb which are empty should be cut ofF first, and those that are black and drossy drained by themselves ; as also those in which there is any farina. Should there be any brood, care must be taken not to crush it, as the juice will communicate a bad flavour to the honey; and those pieces of the comb which contain it, may be placed under any stock that most want9 strengthening. If there be any bees upon the combs when taken out, they should be brushed or blown off, and if besmeared with honeys washed in water made a little warm ; then being laid on a sieve, and placed in the sunshine, they will revive, and fly to their respective homes. The pure combs should be cut in small pieces, sliced twice in a horizontal direction, that is, at the top and at the bottom, and laid on the wire frames to drain ; in two or three hours they may be turned. When all the primary honey is extracted, it must be run through the bag, whereby it will be entirely freed from every particle of wax. This, the first drawn, should be preserved by itself; the next in value is that which drains from the combs indiscriminately ; a third sort may be obtained by wringing the combs in a cloth, or by placing them in a lukewarm oven. They may be afterwards steeped for mead or vinegar, and the water in which the utensils and the hands of the operator have been washed, may be kept likewise for the same purpose. As soon as the jars in which the honey is to be preserved are full, they should be corked down, and deposited in a dry place. Liquid honey should never be put into a vessel containing honey which has acquired any consistency; this mixture will make it ferment and turn sour. A hundred pounds of honey-comb will not in general yield more than four pounds of wrax. To Melt and Purify Wax. Where six or eight stocks of bees are kept, it will be most profitable and convenient to have a tin vessel made512 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. to fit a due proportioned kettle or pot, the sides of which should be quite straight, so that, when it slides down, there may be no vacancy for the farina or bee bread to rise up between. The holes in the tin separater should be as numerous and small as possible in the bottom, and about two inches up the sides; the bottom should he quite flat, without a rim, like that of a quart tin pot, that it may press the dregs the closer down when near the bottom. Set the pot on the fire, with about five or six inches depth of water therein, in which is to be mixed single aquafortis, in the proportion of half an ounce for each quart of water. In this put as many combs as will conveniently boil, when melted. As soon as they begin to melt, they should he frequently stirred, until all he thoroughly melted; let it then boil without stirring, that the wax may rise clear. It should be made to boil briskly during the whole process. As soon as the yel- low froth rises, put in the separater, and press it down in the liquor, until it be about full; with a wooden spoon, or what is better, a tin ladle, first dipped in cold water, lightly skim off the wrax as it rises upon the sur- face, and put it in a narrow-bottomed pan, previously rinsed in cold water, set as near as may he to the pot on the fire, and continue skimming the wax off as long as it rises, depressing the separater in proportion as the liquor rises. When the liquor in the pan is nearly cold, the wax is to he taken out, and what dross adheres to it Bcraped off. The wax is then to be reboiled in a small quantity of water, and about a fourth part as much aqua- fortis as before to a quart; as soon as it boils, take it off, and let it stand until cold. The wax will concrete at the top, and the remaining dross being scraped off, may he farther purified with other combs. Another and less expensive method is, to put the combs loosely into a canvass, or rather a fine hair hag, tied up close at the end, and put into a kettle with a due pro- portion of aquafortis and water; a leaden or iron weight is to he laid on the hag, to keep it down to the bottom. It must he made to boil so as to throw up the froth brisk-THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 513 ly, which is to be taken off witli a ladle; a thick board with a handle in the middle is then to be put in, to press out what wax may be still adhering; it is after- wards to be re-melted, as in the first method. It should be carefully observed, that in these processes of skim- ming off the froth, what rises of a clear yellow should be reserved by itself, as often requiring no further purifica- tion. The more forcibly the froth is thrown up, the purer it will be, and the operation the sooner finished. The very old brood combs are not worth melting; but such refuse as has been pressed, may be kept in a close tub or vessel for five or six weeks, in which time the im- purities will ferment and decay, and the wax will be in a better state for melting.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 514 CHAPTER XXV. ON PIGS. Pigs may be considered of primary importance to the farmer, and to every other householder, as to them the refuse of the fields, the dairy, and the kitchen, is a feast. Though that food should be gross and dirty, they will not reject it; and theyare often reared in cold and filthy habi- tations ; but it is only by order and cleanliness that suc- cessful feeding can be ensured. Where a large stock is kept, their feeding-house should be thirty feet by fifteen : it may be divided into four rooms, the two in the middle to be adapted for eating, and the others for sleeping apartments ; each should have an outside door, and also an inner communication, that the keeper may get their eating-rooms swept out, their mangers cleaned, and their food put in, while the pigs are at rest. Each of the above- mentioned eating and sleeping rooms, in case of being required for sows and young pigs, may be divided into two by partitions, made to remove at pleasure. The sleeping apartments ought to be dark ; and the house, as also the square, or yard, formed by the huts or other buildings for sows, should be paved, and well littered ; and water should be within reach of the pigs. The man- ger, or trough, must be always washed out before put- ting in their victuals; and that which remains in it after the pigs are satisfied, should be given to some of the young stock.THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. From the different varieties having become so much intermixed and blended together, (this is especially the case in Scotland,) it is difficult to describe any particu- lar breed of swine. The Berkshire is allowed to be a good kind. They are generally of a brown, or rather a reddish colour, with black spots, the ears bending for- ward, but not hanging down so much as those of the large Cumberland kind ;—they are short-legged and small-boned ; their flesh is fine ; and they are well dispo- sed to fatten on common fare.—The large spotted Wo- burn breed is well formed, prolific, hardy, and kindly disposed to fatten.—The Chinese black, or pot-bellied breed, are small in size, their necks thick, and legs short. They are one of the most profitable sorts in this island, as their flesh is delicate, and they fatten on very indif- ferent food, and more readily than any other small breed ; indeed they may be said to be always ready for killing. They are excellent for bacon, and are well adapted for being used as pork. When young, that is, when about four months old, they are very mischievous when not well ringed.* And for those who do not like very fat pork, the small breeds before mentioned will be prefer- able, their flesh being equally delicate.—There is another small breed, which is by far the best for the farmer, but it cannot be classified ; they will feed in a shorter period, and will thrive upon articles that would starve the larger- sized animals. The kind in view will feed upon com- mon fare to seven or eight stones Amsterdam when ele- ven or twelve months old, or to nine or ten stones when put up in the house to receive better food. For a large establishment, a boar and two good sows, of a proper age, should constantly be kept; and one young sow annually reared, in order to supply the others, when they pass maturity, that is, when they arrive at * The usual method of ringing swine is now superseded by an improved method adopted by Mr Tubb, which is to pare oft', with a sharp penknife, the gristle on the tops of the noses of youn’• pigs.5H> THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. three years of age. Their time of farrowing should be so arranged that they may produce two litters in the year; one about March, and the other towards the begin- ning of August. A ^ow, when with young, ought not to be entirely confined to a hut, but allowed to walk about at pleasure in the swine-yard, or court belonging to the farm; nor should she be allowed to sleep with a num- ber of swine. A sow goes -with young 112 days, or six- teen weeks, not above a day over or under that time; a few hours previous to her farrowing, she will be obser- ved carrying straws in her mouth, to make a bed with. When she is bringing forth her young, she ought not to have much litter or long straw in her apartment, nor for a few days after, lest the young pigs should be hid by it from their dam. She ought to be well fed when giving suck; if she is once allowed to get poor, it will take double the quantity of food and of time to restore her to her former state. If the pigs should be numerous, they, as also the sow, should be fed two or three times a-day with milk and wheat bran or meal. Should the milk be scarce, a little water, slightly warm, may be mixed with it, taking care that the mixture be not too thick, that is, more of the nature of a drink than of any thing else ; and while the pigs are feeding on this, the sow should be turned out for an hour or two, that her milk may gather a little. She and her pigs should lie dry and warm. If they are well fed, the pigs will he ready for the spit in three weeks ; and may be sold in six weeks. When the pigs are taken from the sow and weaned, whether with the breeder or purchaser, they must be regularly fed three times a-day with a little wheat bran, barley dust, or meal of some description or other, mixed with water, made milk-warm ; in a few weeks after, they may have some potatoes, turnips, or any kind of grain; and after the harvest is concluded, they may be allowed to range at large among the fields, to pick up any left corn, beans, or peas. Before going out in the morning, they may receive a feeding of offal grain ; and in the evening, an allowance of yams or turnips. They may also get the refuse fromTHE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 517 \ the garden, kitchen, and dairy; milk and whey is the finest of all fattening. When the pigs are put up to close feeding, they should have three meals a-day of potatoes, which have been strained, mixed with barley or any other meal, moistened with milk, whey, or water, and seasoned with a little salt; it should be given regularly, and only in such quantities as will be consumed with a relish. This will be found the best and most economical food; but where the trouble attending the preparation of it is con- sidered too great, the next best method is to mix oats with barley, in the proportion of one part to four of bar- ley, which will prevent the pigs from eating it too quick- ly ; the oats being husky, require a longer time to be chewed. Buck-wheat is a quick and good fattening, somewhat similar to barley, not so good as peas; but peas are sometimes put amongst buck, for the same pur- pose that oats are mixed with barley. Pigs that are fed from the refuse of breweries, are liable to eruptive dis- eases. Whenever grains are used for feeding, they should be fresh, and given in moderate quantities, anil should only form a part of their diet: they will also feed well on the spent hops of the breweries. Sweet whey, unless given in very moderate quantities, is injurious to pigs; but when it becomes sourish, it proves very wholesome food. It is too general a practice to pay no attention to feeding pigs until they are put up, perhaps in November or December, when, with a little pains, they might be as fat, and weigh nearly as much, at the time they begin to feed, as at the period when they are fed, which may be about four or five weeks after they are put up. For pork, they are usually fattened from six to nine months old; for bacon and hams, from nine months to a year and a half. Pigs are subject to inflammatory and eruptive dis- eases, both of which require bleeding, purgatives, and cool air in an open field. The most easy way of bleed- ing pigs is by cutting off the tail, or part of the ear. Purgative powder for pigs, jalap one dram. Should this be found insufficient, eleven or twelve grains of518 THE PRACTICE OP COOKERY. scamony may be added, or ten grains of calomel; but it is better to try the jalap alone first. When pigs are to be made into bacon hams, they should be allowed to fast twenty-four hours before the time of killing, and in killing them great attention ought to be had to prevent the knife from striking against the bone at the bottom of the gullet, by which a morbid state of the flesh in the fore-quarter will be avoided. After the pig has been killed and dressed, it should hang up till the next day, when it must be sawn down the back bone from the tail to the point of the] snout; then all the seam or tallow should be removed, with the feet, tail, and ears, and such trifling pieces as may appear offen- sive to the eye. The side being laid upon a table, with the skin side uppermost, salt should be taken in indefi- nite quantities, and rubbed in well, particularly upon the shoulders and hams, for at least half an hour ; the side weighing about six stones. In turning the side, four ounces of saltpetre, ground very fine, should be sprinkled very uniformly over the inside and ends of the shanks, above which ought to be laid a covering of salt, about an inch thick, over the whole inside, and gently clapped down by the hand into every crevice, but by no means rubbed in on that side. The side may then be placed upon boards, on a floor where no frost can affect it. If more than one side is cured, they may be laid one above another to any depth, provided the back and belly parts be laid alternately, and the skin side always down- most. The whole should be covered with a cloth, and some, though not very heavy weight, put upon the top. After lying in this state for ten days, they are to be taken up, and rubbed again upon the skin side with salt, for about a quarter of an hour, and covering again the inside with salt, without rubbing, and without any more saltpetre. After the second rubbing, the sides are again put into their former position, and allowed to remain there for other ten days, when they may be taken up, and wholly covered over with barleymeal, and hung up with cords by the shanks, which may be pierced with519 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. wooden pins, to allow the cord a better hold to the roof of the kitchen. After hanging there in the heat for two months, they may be hung up in any cool, but dry apart- ment. As the family require them, the pieces may be cut out to any size that may be found most conve- nient. From the middle of September to the middle of April s the proper curing season. These approved directions for curing, are given here to make the Chapter complete. Various other receipts on the subject will be found under the head of Pork.APPENDIX. A rule by which any gentleman may be enabled to establish a practical system of domestic economy, ac- cording to his income, to detect any error that may have arisen in the management, and to discover at once what part or parts he may best alter, in order to increase or diminish the expense of any other part that may be de- sired. Rule. Divide the whole annual income, be it what it may, into 100 equal parts, which may be appropriated to the several branches of the establishment in the following proportions, viz. 36 per cent for provisions and other articles of house- hold expense. 22 per cent for servants, horses, and carriages. 12 per cent for clothing, haberdashery, and other inci- dental expenses of that nature. 8 per cent for education, pocket, private, and other extra expenses. 12 per cent for rents, taxes, and repairs of house and furniture. 10 per cent to be reserved for future contingencies. 100 Total.

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 215 A Winter Salad. Wash very clean one or two heads of endive, some heads of celery, some mustard and cresses; cut them all small, add a little shredded red cabbage, some slices of boiled beet-root and onion, if the flavour is not disliked ; mix them together with salad sauce. In spring, add ra- dishes, and also garnish the dish with them. Laver Is dressed in a silver dish over a lamp ; a bit of fresh butter, and the juice of a Seville orange, are stirred into it till quite hot. It is sent to table in the dish over the lamp. This plant grows upon rocks on the sea shore. It is much used in Wales, and is sent to London in jars pre- pared for dressing. To Dress the Leaves of White Beet. Pick and wash them clean, put them on in boiling water with a little salt, cover the sauce-pan, and boil them longer than spinach ; drain off the water, and beat them as spinach, with a bit of butter and a little salt. To Dress French Beans. Trim some nice young French beans, and boil them in salt-and-water ; drain them quite dry, and pour over them the following sauce : Boil a little sauce tournee, and thick- en it with the beaten yolks of two eggs and a little fine- ly-chopped parsley, with a piece of fresh butter, a little pepper, salt, and the juice of a lemon added, and all stir- red till hot. Or, put them into a stew-pan, and when quite hot, add a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, a lit- tle pepper, salt, and the juice of half a lemon ; shake the stew-pan frequently, but do not use a spoon. If the butter does not mix well, add half a spoonful of sauce tournee.

When they are thus carefully cleaned, lay them on a floor where air can be freely admitted ; turn and shake them frequently, and when dry, put them into bags, and beat them on a knock- ing-stone with a knocker. To Wash Silk Stockings, White and Black. Cut in thin bits some white soap, and boil it in soft water; pour a little of it amongst cold soft water, and wash the stockings, first upon the inner side; repeat the washing with fresh suds and water, till they are washed quite clean ; turn the outside the last time of washing, and if the feet be very dirty, rub a little of the boiled soap upon them, but not upon the legs.

A scarf or veil, after being starched, should be pinned out tight

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 261 Potatoe or Carrot Pudding. Weigh half a pound of boiled potatoes, or of boiled carrots, and pound them in a mortar; blanch one ounce of sweet almonds; pound them, but not finely, with a little orange-flower water; add the well-beaten whites of two, and the yolks of four eggs, a little salt, grated nut- meg, and one or two table-spoonfuls of brown sugar; mix all well together. Line the dish with pullâ€™ paste, and just before putting the pudding into the oven, stir in half a pound of melted butter. Bake it for twenty minutes. Potatoe Pudding.

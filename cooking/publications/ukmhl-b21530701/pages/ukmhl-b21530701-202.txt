158 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. quantity required. Beat two eggs, whisking up well both yolks and whites ; add them to the meat and bread, and beat them all together for some time; the more they are beaten, the lighter the boudin will be. Butter a shape, and fill it; tie the shape in a cloth, and put it on to boil for three hours. A rich sauce, thickened and seasoned, is to be poured over the boudin when it is dished. Burdwan Stew. Cut into joints a cold fowl or duck, put it into a stew- pan, with half a pint of gravy, a large wine-glass of ale, half a one of white wine, the juice of half a lemon, a tea- spoonful of soy and cayenne; of mushroom catsup, le- mon pickle, cucumber vinegar, corack escavecke, a des- sert-spoonful each. Heat all thoroughly before serving. To Pot Chicken with Ham. Pound, in a marble mortar, the white meat of a cold fowl; season it with mace, white pepper, and a little salt; pound a piece of ham fat and lean, red beef or tongue; season it with pepper; put a layer alternately of each kind of meat into ajar, and press it closely; cover it with cla- rified butter. Cold turkey, veal, venison, or hare, may be done in this manner. To Boil a Duck. Make a paste, allowing half a pound of butter to a pound of flour. Truss a duck as for boiling; put into the inside a little pepper and salt, one or two sage leaves, and a little onion finely minced ; enclose the duck in the paste, with a little jellied gravy. Boil it in a cloth, and serve it with brown gravy poured round it. To Stew Duck. Cut one or two ducks into quarters ; fry them a light brown in butter; put them into a sauce-pan, with a pint of gravy, a tea-cupful of port wine, four onions whole, black pepper, and some salt, a bunch of parsley, two sage leaves, a sprig of winter savory, and sweet-marjoram.

37 TIIE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. CHAPTER II. FISH. PREPARATORY REMARKS ON FISH. Turbot ;—a good one is thick, and the belly cream- coloured. If the belly and fins be streaked with red, it is certainly fresh. When it must be kept, it should be hung up by the tail in a cool place. The same directions apply to soles and flounders. Cod;—when good, has a small head, broad shoulders, and a hollow at the back of the neck, and a small and stiff tail. Salmon, haddocks, mackerel, whiting, herring, and sprats, should all be firm, and chosen with small heads, thick shoulders, and small tails. Smelts ;—when perfectly fresh, smell like a newly-cut cucumber. Carp, tench, pike, and perch ;—when fresh, the eyes are bright, the body stiff, the gills red, and hard to open. The silver eel, so called from the bright colour of the belly, is the most esteemed. Skate ;—the female is the best, and when good is thick, and has a very white belly, tinged with lilac. That with large thorns is a very inferior fish.

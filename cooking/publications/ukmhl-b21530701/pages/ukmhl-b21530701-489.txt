MANAGEMENT OF FOULTRY Warm, dry, and shingly soil, like the sea beach, is best adapted for the rearing of poultry; and such may be artificially formed, where it is not afforded by nature. A yard or court being pitched upon, the foundation should be laid with chalk or bricklayersâ€™ rubbish, the surface to consist of sandy gravel; and considerable spots of it may be sown with common trefoil or wild clover, with a mix- ture of bumet, 6purry, or star-grass, which last species are particularly salubrious to poultry. The surface must be sloped and drained, so as to avoid all stagnant moist- ure, and the whole enclosed with a fence, lofty, and so secured at the bottom that the smallest chicken may not find a passage through. The poultry houses within the court should have a southern aspect, and if the number of the stock be large, the houses had far better be small and detached; and should they abut upon a stable, brew-house, or any con- ductor of warmth, it will be a farther advantage. The floors should consist of well-rammed chalk or earth, so that they may be easily swept clean. In the roof, which must be lofty, there should be only one long and level range of perches; and if in the wall steps be so placed that the poultry may jump from the one to the other, the ascent will be rendered easy to the perches, and also to the nests, for which boxes are the most convenient, when properly constructed. A few railed doors may he pro-

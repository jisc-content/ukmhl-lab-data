508 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. till the bees, terrified by the noise, take refuge in the upper hive; then, with the fumigating bellows, or com- mon tobacco pipe, blow into the hive a little smoke from lime leaves, or tobacco. The same operation having been performed on the other hive, that is, the hive des- tined to receive the new colony, the dislodged bees are emptied into it, and swept with a brush of feathers into the interstices between the combs; the board being then put upon the hive, it is instantly reverted, and placed upon the stand. When a hive is merely to be deprived of a part of its store, the hive with the bees in it may be placed upon the pedestal from which the full one was removed, and the hive from which the bees have been driven must then be taken into the house. A few bees will be found still straggling about the combs, but they will be too frightened to use their sting. W hen the re- quisite quantity of comb is cut out, breaking it as little as possible, the hive should be cleared of every noxious matter, and returned to its former position ; but first in- vert the hive containing the bees, and place the deprived hive over it; leave them in this situation till the morn- ing, when the bees will be found to have taken posses- sion of their native home. At any season of the year, a weak hive may be strengthened from a strong one, by the following method: Take a strong hive from its pe- destal, and place on it that which has few bees in it; then turning up the strong one, give it several raps on its sides, when many of the bees will fly to their old sta- tion; then place the strong hive where the weak one stood, or the other at a considerable distance. The bee-master, in approaching a hive, should avoid breathing on the bees; and, if his manner be soft, calm, and gentle, he will in general need no protection from being stung; but when swarms are to be united, or hives deprived of a part of their store, the operator should be provided with thick worsted gloves, and a gauze, or piece of thin cloth, such as milk is usually strained through, for the head; this last must be large enough to go over a manâ€™s hat, and round the neck, so as to tie before with

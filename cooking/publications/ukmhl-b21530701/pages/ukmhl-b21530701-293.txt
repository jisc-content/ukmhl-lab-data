THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 249 Maids of Honour. Beat with the yolks of seven eggs half a pound of pounded loaf sugar; pound not too finely the same quan- tity of blanched sweet almonds with a few bitter ones, and two table-spoonfuls of orange-flower water; mix in the almonds the last thing, and bake in patty-pans lined with paste. Cheese Cakes. Take one pound of loaf sugar pounded, six yolks, and four whites of eggs beaten, the juice of three fine lemons, the grated rind of two, and a quarter of a pound of fresh butter; put these ingredients into a sauce-pan, and stir the mixture gently over a slow fire till it be of the con- sistence of honey; pour it into small jars, and when cold put paper dipped in brandy over them. It will keep good for a year. Apple Pudding. Pare and core twelve large apples, put them into a sauce-pan with water sufficient to cover them, stew them till soft, and then beat them smooth, and mix in three quarters of a pound of pounded loaf sugar, a quarter of a pound of fresli butter, the juice and grated peel of two lemons, and the well-beaten yolks of eight eggs; line a dish with puff paste, put in the pudding, and bake it for nearly three quarters of an hour; before serving, grate loaf sugar all over the top till it looks white. Another way to make Apple Pudding. Peel and core six very large apples, stew them in six table-spoonfuls of water, with the rind of a lemon ; when soft, beat them to a pulp, add six ounces of melted fresh butter, the same of good brown sugar, six well-beaten eggs, half a wine glass of brandy, and a tea-spoonful of lemon juice ; line a dish with puff paste, and when baked, stick all over the top thin chips of candied citron and lemon peel.

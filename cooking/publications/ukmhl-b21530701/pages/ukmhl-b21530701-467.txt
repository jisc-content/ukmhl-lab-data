THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 423 and a gallon or two of warm water; then put into the cask, which is to be filled up with water, and the yeast added. Another way to make Spruce Beer. The proportions are ten gallons of water, three quarts of treacle, a tea-cupful of ginger, the same of allspice, three ounces of hops, three ounces and a half of the es- sence of spruce, and half a pint of good yeast. The hops, ginger, and allspice, must be boiled together till the hops fall to the bottom ; the treacle and spruce are then to be dissolved in a bucket- full of the liquor, the whole strained into a cask, and the yeast well stirred in ; when the fer- mentation ceases, the cask is to be bunged up. Ginger Beer. For a ten-gallon cask, eleven gallons of water, four- teen pounds of sugar, the juice of eighteen lemons, and one pound of ginger are allowed ; the sugar and water are boiled with the whites of eight eggs, and well skimmed; just before coming to the boiling point, the ginger, which must be bruised, is then added, and boiled for twenty minutes; when cold, the clear part is put into the cask, together with tiie lemon juice and two spoonfuls of yeast; when it has fermented for three or four days, it is fined, bunged up, and in a fortnight bottled. It may be made without the fruit. Another Ginger Beer Quickly Made. A gallon of boiling water is poured over three quar- ters of a pound of loaf sugar, one ounce and a quarter of sliced ginger, and the peel of one lemon ; when milk- warm, the juice of the lemon and a spoonful of yeast are added. It should be made in the evening, and bottled next morning in half-pint stone bottles, and the cork tied down with twine.

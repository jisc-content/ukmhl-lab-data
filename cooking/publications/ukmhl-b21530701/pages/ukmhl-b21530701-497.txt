THE PRACTICE OT COOKERY. 153 CHAPTER XXL THE DAIRY. A Dairy-House ought to be well aired, free from damp, and situated so that a proper temperature may be preserved,—from 50° to 55° Fahrenheit. A milk dairy requires two apartments; one for the milk, the other for scalding and cleaning the different utensils. To secure a proper degree of heat for common purposes, a vacuity of eight or ten inches, left betwixt the wall and the lath and plaster, will be sufficient. The roof should be of thatch, three feet thick at the least, and should project completely over the walls on each side. To afford shade and a beneficial degree of coolness to the whole building, the outer doors may be made to open under a penthouse, or lean-to shed. It would be advantageous to have an ice- house attached to the dairy, as a small quantity of ice, placed when necessary in the milk room, would soon lower the temperature to any degree that might be want- ed. If the cold in winter should become too great, a bar- rel of hot water, close stopped, or a few hot bricks, placed on the floor or table of the milk-room, would readily counteract its effects ; a chafing-dish with burning coals should never be used. The utensils required for a dairy of twenty cows, may, in most cases, be provided for L.20 or L.30. Wood has in general been employed in their construction, and is, upon the whole, the most eligible ma- terial ; lead, brass, and copper, are altogether inadmissi- ble ; the least objectionable of all the metallic milk-dishes, are probably those which have been lately invented by Mr Braid of the Sliotts iron-works in Linlithgowshire.

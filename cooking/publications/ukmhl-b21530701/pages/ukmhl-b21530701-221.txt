THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 177 becomes like ft paste, carefully stirring it all the time, put it for a few minutes upon a quick tire, and then return it to where there is less heat, and stir it till it assumes a light brown colour, when it may be put into a jar. These thickenings keep for some time. Gravy made from Bones. Break into small pieces a pound of beef, mutton, or veal bones, if mixed together so much the better; boil them in two quarts of water, and after it boils, let it simmer for nearly three hours; boil with it a couple of onions, a bunch of sweet herbs, some salt and pepper ; strain, and keep it for making gravy or sauces. The bones of broiled and roasted meat beiHg scraped, washed clean, and boiled in less water, answer equally well for this purpose. To make Gravy. Cut down into slices four pounds of lean beef, rub the bottom of the pot with butter, and put in the meat; turn it frequently till it be well browned, and do it slowly, then add four quarts of cold water; when it has boiled two hours, put in a dessert-spoonful of whole black pepper, and the same of Jamaica pepper, one carrot, and three onions ; let it stew gently for four hours longer, strain it, and when it is required for use, take off the fat. This gravy answers for all made dishes when brown gravy sauce is used. Another way to make Gravy. Dip a beef liver into water, wipe it, and rub over it some salt and coarse brown sugar; let it lie seven or eight days, turning it frequently; boil in as much water as will quite cover the liver, one ounce of saltpetre, and three of common salt; wipe the liver dry, and put it into the pickle ; let it lie for six weeks, then hang it to dry. Boil for an hour and a half, in a pint of water, a slice of this nearly the size of threo fingers, a carrot, an onion, and some pepper ; strain, and use it for gravy. M

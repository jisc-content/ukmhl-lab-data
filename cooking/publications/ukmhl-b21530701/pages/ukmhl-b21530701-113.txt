(>9 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. To Stew Oysters. Stew with a quart of oysters, ami their liquor strained, a glass of white wine, one anchovy bruised, seasoned with white pepper, salt, a little mace, and a bunch of sweet herbs; let all stew gently a quarter of an hour.

Another way to Scallop Oysters. Take off the beards, stew them in their liquor strain- ed, with a little mace, white pepper, and salt. Fry in a stew-pan, with a bit of butter, some grated bread crumbs, till of a nice brown; put them alternately with the oysters into a dish. To Pickle Oysters. Open them carefully, preserving all their liquor; put them into a sauce-pan over the fire, stirring them now and then, and when the liquor boils take them off, skim the

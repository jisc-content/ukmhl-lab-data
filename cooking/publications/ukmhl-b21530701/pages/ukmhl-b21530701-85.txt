11 THE PRACTICE OP COOKERY. To Salt a Salmon. Cut the fish up the back, and cut out the bone; wipe it clean, and sprinkle it with salt; let it lie a night to drain off the liquor ; wipe it dry; nib on it two or three ounces of pounded saltpetre ; cut it into pieces ; pack it close in a pot, with a thick layer of salt between each layer of fish.

Boil in two quarts of vinegar three heads of shalots, half an ounce of whole black pepper, three cloves, two blades of mace, and a little salt.

Take off the head ; cut the salmon in thick slices; wipe it dry, but do not wash it; pound half an ounce of nutmeg, mace, and cloves, the least part of cloves, half

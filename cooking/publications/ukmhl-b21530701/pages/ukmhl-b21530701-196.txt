THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 152 pan three ounces of butter with a table-spoonful of flour, add as much gravy or water as will nearly cover the pigeons, put them in with the livers, gizzards, and pi- nions, salt, and some minced parsley, spinach may also be added; let them stew for three quarters of an hour, add, a few minutes before serving, the yolks of four or six hard-boiled eggs. Another way to Stew Pigeons. Wash and clean six pigeons, cut them into quarters, and put all their giblets with them into a stew-pan, a piece of butter, a little water, a bit of lemon peel, two blades of mace, some chopped parsley, salt, and pepper; rover the pan closely, and stew them till they be tender; thicken the sauce with the yolk of an egg beaten up with three table-spoonfuls of cream and a bit of butter dusted with flour; let them stew ten minutes longer be- fore serving. Fowl a la Condd. Draw the sinews of the legs of two fine white fowls, and take out the breast bones, truss them, and put into each a little lemon juice, and salt, mixed with a piece of butter, place them in a stew-pan, and cover them with thin slices of fat bacon, pour over them the following sauce: Cut into dice a pound of veal, the same quantity of fat bacon, and a little fat of ham, fry all this white in half a pound of butter, adding a bunch of parsley, a little thyme, half a bay leaf, a clove, some salt and pepper, and some boiling water; when sufficiently stewed, strain it over the fowls, and let them stew for three quarters of an hour upon a slow fire, but have a pretty brisk one upon the cover of the stew pan; drain and serve them with a rich brown sauce, and a scarlet tongue placed be- tween them in the dish. To Stew a Fowl with Onions. Wash it clean, dry and truss it as for boiling, put a little pepper and salt into it, rub it with a bit of butter,

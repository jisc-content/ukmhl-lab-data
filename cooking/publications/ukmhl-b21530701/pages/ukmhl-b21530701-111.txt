67 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Indian Fagadu. Clean and wash a quantity of spinach, put it into a sauce-pan without any water, and the meat of a lobster, oT a pint of shrimps, picked from the shells and cut small, an onion, and a clove of garlic minced fine, some salt, a few chilies, or cayenne ; when nearly done, add some onions sliced, and fried brown ; cover the stew-pan close for a short time, then keep stirring it till it becomes quite dry ; sour it with lemon juice. Lobster Salad. Broil a boiled lobster, mince the meat with minced onions, pickled green apples, green capsicums, lemon juice, and salt. Dressed Crabs. After the crabs are boiled, break the claws, and pick out all the meat carefully from them, and the breast; ta- king the red part along with a little of the inside. Keep the shell whole; mince up the meat, season it with gra- ted nntmeg, white pepper, salt, some white wine, and a little vinegar; mix in a few bread crumbs, and a good bit of butter; put it into a sauce pan to heat, stirring it all the time; when thoroughly heated/fill the shells, pre- viously washed clean, with or without puff-paste round the edge. Brown them in an oven. Another way to prepare Dressed Crabs. Pick out the meat from the shell, mince it finely with a bit of butter, and season it high with pepper, salt, and nutmeg, a glass of port wine, and a dessert-spoonful of vinegar; mix it all together, put it into the shell, and strew over finely grated bread crumbs. Brown it in a Dutch oven, and serve it hot. Dressed Cold Crabs or Lobsters. Pick the meat from the shells, and dress it with a sauce as for salad, adding a little pepper and cayenne.'

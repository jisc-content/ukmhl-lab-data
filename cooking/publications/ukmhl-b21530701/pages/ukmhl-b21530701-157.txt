THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 113 fat, indicates good veal. The fillet of a cow calf is to be preferred, on account of the udder. The prime joints are the fillet, the loin, the chump end of the loin, and the best end of the neck. To keep it, the same directions may be followed, which are given for keeping beef. When the fillet is to be roasted, it should be washed, well dried, and the bone taken out, the space filled with a fine stuffing, part of which should be put under the flap, then formed into a round, and firmly skewered. T hat the fire may be clear and strong, it should be made up some time before putting down the roast, which should at first be placed at some distance from it, and be fre- quently and well basted with butter. When about half roasted, a piece of white paper is tied over the fat; a lit- tle before serving, it is removed, the meat is then sprinkled with salt, dredged with flour, and well basted to froth it. When dished, finely melted butter is poured over it, with which may or may not be mixed some lemon pickle or brown gravy. It is garnished with cut lemon. A fillet weighing ten or fourteen pounds requires four hours to roast. The loin will take about three hours to roast; and is basted, the fat covered with paper, and served like the fillet. A slice of thin toasted bread is also served with it, on which the carver should lay a part of the kidney fat, and sprinkle it with salt and pepper. A shoulder stuffed with forcemeat will take from two to three hours to roast. The best end of the neck may be roasted or boiled; if boiled, melted butter, made thick with parsley, is pour- ed over it. A knuckle of veal may be boiled and served in the same way. Pickled pork, ham, bacon, tongue, or sausages, is the general accompaniment to roasted or boiled veal. ii

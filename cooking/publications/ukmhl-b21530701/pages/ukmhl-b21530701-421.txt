When the plums rise to the top, take them off, and carefully pare off the skin, and put them upon a sieve. Drain the water from the leaves ; with fresh ones again heat the plums in it, and closely cover the pan ; they must be done very slowly, and will take some hours to become green. Take them out and drain them upon a sieve. Cla- rify the sugar, boil it for eight minutes, put in the plums, boil them gently till transparent, and carefully put them into jars. Boil the sirup a few minutes, and pour it over them when cold. In three or four days pour' off the sirup, boil it up, and, when cold, put it over the fruit. Another way to Preserve Green Gages". Put the plums into boiling water, pare off the skin, and divide them ; take an equal quantity of pounded loaf sugar, strew half of it over the fruit; let it remain some hours, and, with the remainder of the sugar, put it into a preserving pan ; boil till the plums look quite clear, take off the scum as it rises, and, a few minutes before taking them off the fire, add the kernels. Apple Jelly. Pare and cut into slices eighteen large acid apples ; boil them in as much water as will cover them ; when quite soft, dip a coarse cloth into hot water, wring it dry, and strain the apples through it; to each pint of juice allow fourteen ounces of fine loaf sugar, clarify it, and add, with the apple juice, the peel of a large lemon ; boil it till it jellies, which may be in twenty minutes ; pick out the lemon peel, and immediately put it into

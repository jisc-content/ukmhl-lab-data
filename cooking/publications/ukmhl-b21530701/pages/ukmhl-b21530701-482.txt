THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 438 To make Coffee when much is required. In the morning, pour upon a quarter of a pound of fresh-ground coffee about two quarts of boiling water; stir it for three or four minutes; cover it closely, and let it remain till the evening; pour it off quite clear, and boil it up for use. Another way to make Coffee. Beat an egg, shell and all; mix it with a quarter of a pound of coffee, then pour two quarts of boiling water on it, and boil it for five minutes ; let it settle a little that it may be fine ; or, instead of clearing it with an egg, pour a little cold water into the coffee-pot before taking it off the fire. It may be made in this way in a larger quan- tity, the clear part poured off, bottled, and corked. Thus prepared, kept in a cool place, it will continue good for ten or fifteen days. Milk Coffee for Breakfast. Boil one ounce of good coffee for fifteen minutes in a pint and a half of water. The next day pour off the clear liquor, and the following morning add to it one pint of new milk; make it quite hot, but do not allow it to boil. Sweeten it with pounded sugar-candy, or brown sugar. Cocoa. Put into a sauce-pan one ounce of patent cocoa and one quart of water; cover it, and when it boils, set it by the side of the fire to simmer for two hours. It is sometimes made in a larger quantity, poured from the sediment, and boiled up as it is required. Chocolate. Scrape down one square of chocolate, and mix it with one pint of boiling milk, or milk-and-water; then mill or stir it well, and serve it with the froth.

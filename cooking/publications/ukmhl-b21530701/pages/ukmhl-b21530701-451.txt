Elderberries Can be made to produce excellent wine, allowing to a ten-gallon cask forty pounds of fruit, forty pounds of su- gar, and a quarter of a pound of tartar. When elderberry wine is desired for a warm cordial, it is made in the follow- ing manner:â€”Twenty-five pounds of fruit are to be boiled for an hour, in eleven gallons of water, and along with it, tied in a piece of linen, one ounce of allspice, and two of ginger; forty pounds of sugar being put into a tub, the boil- ing liquor is strained over it, pressing the fruit quite dry; a quarter of a pound of crude tartar, or cream of tartar, is then added to the liquid. When it has stood two days in the tub, it may be removed to the cask, treated, as for sweet wine, in the usual manner, and bottled in March following. When to be drank, a portion of it is heated with some sugar, two or three cloves, and a little nutmeg. Wine from Mixed Fruit. * The three varieties of currant may be used in the largest proportion, and being nicely picked from the stalks, they are allowed just to boil in as much water as to pre- vent their burning; of raspberries, strawberries, and cher- ries, black-heart are the best, equal quantities may ho allowed ; they are masked with a little water; goose- berries may be used to advantage, but must be prepared separately by more powerful bruising, in an equal quan- tityof water,and straining through a canvass bag,theother fruits being also strained ; to each gallon of juice thus ob- tained, four pounds of loaf sugar, and half an ounce of crude tartar, are allowed; when the material has stood some hours in the tub in which it was mixed, it is removed to the cask, and managed as currant wine.

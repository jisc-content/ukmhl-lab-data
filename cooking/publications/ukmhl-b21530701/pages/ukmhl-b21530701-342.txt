Boil the grated peel of a large lemon, and three quar- ters of a pound of pounded loaf sugar, in a pint of cream ; squeeze the juice of the lemon upon a table-spoonful of flour, work it well together, and gradually add to it the boiling cream, and heat it all over the fire ; pour it into a basin, and when nearly cold, put it into a glass or chi- na dish, and garnish it with candied orange peel, and ci- tron cut into straws.

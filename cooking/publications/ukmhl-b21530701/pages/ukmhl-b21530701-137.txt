93 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. To Broil Beef Steaks. Cut the steaks off a rump or the ribs of a fore-quar- ter ; beat them well with a rolling-pin. Have the grid- iron perfectly clean and heated over a clear quick fire; lay on the steaks, and, with meat tongs, keep turning them constantly, till they are done enough ; throw a lit- tle salt over them a little before taking them off the fire. Serve them as hot as possible, plain, or with a made gra- vy and sliced onion, or rub a bit of butter upon the steaks the moment of serving. Mutton chops are broiled in the same manner. Ox-feet or Cow-lieel. Wash them well; boil them in plenty of water, till the hoofs come off, and the hair can be pulled off, and scraped clean ; wash them well, and boil them in fresh water till all the bones can be easily taken out. To pot them, cut them into small pieces, add a little of the liquor, heat it, and season it with some salt and vinegar; put it into a mould, and when it becomes cold, turn it out. It is eaten with vinegar and mustard. They may be served without being cut small, either hot or cold; if hot, serve with thick parsley and butter. Another Ox-feet or Cow-lieel. Cut them into small bits ; dip them into the yolk of an egg beaten up ; roll them in bread crumbs, seasoned with pepper, salt, and minced parsley; fry them in butter. Cut into thin slices a good dish of onions, fry them in but- ter, and serve them hot, with the fried heel laid upon them. The liquor may be made into jelly, or used to enrich sauces and gravies. Ox-blood Puddings. Let the blood run into a deep pan, stir it all the time, and when it is nearly cold, throw in a little salt; rub it through a hair sieve ; mix a pint of milk with two quarts of blood. Chop some suet, mix it with minced onion,

501 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. be propagated in the spring months by seeds, by rooted slips, and by cuttings. Costmary. Costmary does best in a dry soil. It is propagated by parting the roots in autumn. Rosemary. Rosemary is easily propagated by slips or cuttings in spring. It should be planted in a dry soil, in a sheltered situation ; but if its roots enter the crevices at the base of an old wall, the plant will not be injured by the seve- rest frosts. Lavender. Lavender is propagated by cuttings, in young slips, any time in the spring months. It should be planted in a dry, gravelly, or poor soil. Balm. Balm is readily propagated by parting the roots, pre- serving two or three buds to each piece; or by slips, either in autumn or spring. In order to have young leaves all the summer, some of the stalks should be cut down every month. The balm plantation need not be renewed oftener than every third or fourth tear. Coriander. The seeds of coriander should be sown in autumn, and the plants afterwards thinned out to five or six inches asunder. Caraway. The caraway is a biennial plant, and should be sown soon after the seed is ripe, in autumn, thinning out the plants the next spring, to within four or six inches apart. A moist soil suits the caraway the best.

285 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. warmed preserve, or stew for a few minutes, in sweet wine and a little sugar, some stoned bloom raisins, and put tliem upon and round the toast. The preserves may be heated by placing the jars in hot water by the side of the fire. Fondeux. Beat separately the yolks and whites of four eggs; add to the yolks a pint of cream, and half a pound of grated Parmesan cheese; mix in the whites of the eggs just before putting it into paper cases ; or bake it in a round tin about three inches high, and before serving it, which should be instantly when taken out of the oven, put round it a sheet of white paper folded, and cut so as to form a fringe at the top. Any mild, dry cheese may be used, and butter beat- en to a cream substituted for cream. Another way to make Fondeux. Mix by degrees, with a quarter of a pound of flour, half a pint of cream, and half an ounce of butter; put it into a sauce-pan, and stir it over the fire till quite thick; add five yolks of eggs well-beaten, with half a pint of new milk, and two ounces of grated Parmesan cheese ; stir it together in a basin, and mix in lightly the five whites of eggs beaten to a stiff froth; bake it in a tin, lined with puff paste, for half an hour; turn it out instantly to serve. A soufflet pudding may be made exactly in this way, substituting sugar for the cheese. Omelette Soufflet. Beat, with the yolks of ten eggs, four table-spoonfuls of pounded sugar, and half the peel of a grated lemon : add, the instant before putting into the pan, the well-beat- en whites of the eggs ; fry it in a quarter of a pound of fresh butter ; shake it, to prevent its adhering to the pan ; when firm, sift grated sugar over the top, and brown it with a salamander or hot shovel; serve it immediately, when done.

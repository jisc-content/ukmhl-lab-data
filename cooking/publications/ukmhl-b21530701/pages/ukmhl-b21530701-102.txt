58 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. To Boil Soles, Brill, or any otlier Flat Fish. Clean them, cut off their fins, and put them on in boiling salt and water, and let it boil fast till the fish rises to the surface, when they will be done enough. Sauce ;—anchovy, and shrimp sauce. To Boil Trout. Clean and gut them ; make the water as salt as for boiling salmon in, and when it boils put in the trout, and let them boil fast from fifteen to twenty minutes, accord- ing to their size. Sauce ;—melted butter. To Fry Trout. Cut off the fins, clean, and gut them ; dust them with flour, and dip them into the yolk of an egg beaten ; strew grated bread-crumbs over, and fry them in fresh dripping ; lay them upon the back of a sieve before the fire to drain. Sauce ;—melted butter, with a table-spoonful of catsup, and one of lemon pickle in it. When they are small, roll them in oatmeal before they are fried. To Broil Trout. Cut off the fins, and cut the fish down the back, close to the bone, and split the head in two. Another way is, after they have been cut open, to rub a little salt over them ; let them lie three or four hours, and then hang them up in the kitchen. They will be ready to broil the next morning for breakfast. To Collar Trout. Wash them clean, split them down the back, bone and dry them well in a cloth ; season them well with finely- pounded black pepper, salt, and mace ; roll them tight, and lay them close into a dish ; pour over an equal quantity of vinegar and beer, with two or three bay leaves, and some whole black pepper ; tie over the dish a sheet of buttered paper, and bake them an hour.

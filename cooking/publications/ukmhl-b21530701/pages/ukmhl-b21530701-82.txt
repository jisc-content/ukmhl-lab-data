38 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. A lobster should be rather heavy, in proportion to its size. When in perfection, the shell on the side will not yield to moderate pressure. Barnacles and other marine animals adhering to it are certain indications of superior goodness. If the berries appear large and brownish, it will he found watery and poor. The cock lobster is in general better than the hen, and is distinguished by its narrow tail. Crabs;—the male is the best, and may be known by its narrow breast. When light they are watery ; which may more easily be detected after they are boiled ; by then holding them firmly and shaking them, the rattling of the water will be heard. Prawns and shrimps are good when their tails turn strongly inwards, and when they have no unpleasant smell. When oysters are alive and strong, the shell, in opening them, will close upon the knife. Those from the coast of Kent, and those called Pandore, from the Firth of Forth, are the most esteemed. On Dressing Fish. Fish must by no means be allowed to remain in the water after it is boiled ; if therefore it should be ready before it can be sent to table, it must be dished, the cover put on, and a cloth put over it. The dish is then to be set across the fish-kettle. Fish should be fried over a clear quick fire, and with dripping, or hog’s lard, in preference to butter. The pan should be deep ; and to ascertain that it is clean, a little fat is first fried in it, poured out, and the pan wiped with a clean cloth ; as much dripping or lard is then put in as will entirely cover the fish. When it is boiling hot, and begins to smoke, the fish is put in ; if small, they may be turned in three or four minutes, by sticking in a fork near

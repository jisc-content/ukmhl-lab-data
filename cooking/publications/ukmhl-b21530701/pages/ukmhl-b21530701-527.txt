A light deep soil is most suitable for the skirret, and should it be naturally moist, so much the better. In dry soils, or in long continued droughts, watering is advi- sable. The seeds are sown in April, and repeated thin- ning and hoeing are necessary. When the leaves begin to decay in autumn, the roots are fit for use ; they will not be injured by frost, and may therefore remain in the ground till wanted. Red Beet. Red beet requires a light, but rich soil, of considera- ble depth, that has not recently been manured. The ground should be trenched, or very deeply delved, and broken small with the spade. The seed is sown in April, in drills an inch deep, and fifteen inches asunder. In autumn, beet-root is generally stored amongst sand in a cellar, or some place that will completely exclude the frost. In lifting it, great care must be taken that the roots be not anywise injured or broken, as they bleed much; for the same reason, the leaves must be cut off at least an inch above the top of the root. White Beet. This kind of beet is cultivated only for its leaves, which are used as spinach. The seeds are sown in the beginning of March, in an open spot of ground. When the plants have put out four leaves, they are hoed, and thinned out to at least four inches asunder. A month afterwards a second hoeing is given, leaving the plants about eight inches separate. The outer leaves being first picked off for use, a succession is afforded for the whole season. Jerusalem Artichoke. This plant is propagated by means of the tubeus,

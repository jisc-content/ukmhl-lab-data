THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 346 Plum Cake. To one pound of dried and sifted flour, allow three quarters of a pound of sifted loaf sugar, eight eggs, the yolks and whites separately beaten; three quarters of a pound of butter beaten to a cream, three pounded cloves, half a grated nutmeg, half a pound of cleaned and dried currants; add the sugar to the butter, and next the eggs by degrees, then the flour and spices. Beat all well together for nearly an hour, mix in the currants with the grated peel of a lemon, half a glass of white wine, and the same quantity of brandy; put it into a cake-pan lined with buttered paper; bake it in a moderate oven. Gateau a la Dauphine. Beat separately the whites and yolks of twenty eggs ; to the yolks add a pound of pounded and sifted loaf sugar, the grated peel of one lemon, and two or three table- spoonfuls of orange-flower water; then stir in the whites, and lightly mix in half a pound of dried and sifted flour. Bake in a buttered tin, in a moderate oven. Gingerbread Cake. Take two pounds of treacle, two and a quarter of flour, of brown sugar and fresh butter three quarters of a pound each, four ounces of caraway seeds, the same quantity of candied orange peel cut small, four well-beaten eggs, and half an ounce of pearl ashes ; beat the butter to a cream, and mix it with the rest of the ingredients. The next day work it well up, and bake it in a buttered tin. Gingerbread Nuts.

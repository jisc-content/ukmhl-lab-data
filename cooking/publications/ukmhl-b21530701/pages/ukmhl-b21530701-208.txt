THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 164- A Fish Currie. After a cod-fish, haddock, or mackerel has lain some hours in salt, cut it into pieces, and stew it in water suffi- cient to cover it, into which a large table-spoonful of cur- rie powder has been mixed. Fry in a quarter of a pound of butter, a shalot and two or three onions minced, a lit- tle pepper and salt. When well browned, add it to the fish, and stew all together till it be quite tender. Sprats make a good currie, but should be stewed in less water. Cold Fish Currie. Cut into round thick slices cold boiled salmon, soles, cod, or haddocks; fry them in butter. In as much vine- gar as will cover the fish, boil a little salt, two or three cloves of garlic, a good deal of turmeric finely pounded, three cloves, a little nutmeg, ginger, and black pepper pounded, as much as will season it highly, and pour it hot over the fish. Cover it closely, and when it has stood twenty-four hours, it will be fit for use, and should be eaten cold with boiled rice. Indian Currie. Stew in two ounces of butter, for ten minutes, a tea- spoonful of cayenne, and one of Jamaica pepper, a des- sert-spoonful of pounded coriander seed, six small onions, and two heads of garlic minced. Cut the fowl or rabbit into small pieces, and cover it over with the curd of sweet milk. Put the whole into a stew-pan, with as much boil- ing water as may be desired for sauce, and let it simmer till very tender. Currie of Veal, Rabbit, or Fowl. Fry sliced veal, rabbit, fowl, or sweetbreads, in a good deal of butter, dusting it with flour. Dust one side with currie powder ; then turn and dust the other, strew- ing over it finely-minced onions, taking care not to burn them. When the meat is of a light brown, add some white 6tock, with a little salt; stew it till tender. Be-

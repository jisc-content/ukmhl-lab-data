THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 350 a day and a night, then roll it out very thin, and cut it into oblong cakes. Oatmeal Cakes. One only should be made at a time, as the mixture dries quickly. Put two or three handfuls of meal into a bowl, and moisten it with water merely sufficient to form it into a cake; knead it out round and round with the hands upon the paste-board, strewing meal under and over it; it may be made as thin as a wafer, or thicker, according to taste, and put it on a hot iron plate, called a girdle. Bake it till it be a little brown on the under side, then take it off, and toast that side before the fire which was uppermost on the girdle. The toaster is such as is commonly used for heating smoothing irons, having a back to support the cake. To make these cakes soft, they must not be toasted before the fire, but both sides done quickly on the girdle. Girdle Cakes. Rub three ounces of fresh butter into one pound of flour, with half a tea-spoonful of salt; moisten with a suf- ciency of sweet butter-milk to make it into a paste ; roll it out, and cut it into cakes with a cup or tumbler, and bake them upon a girdle. Bath Buns. To four pounds of dried and sifted flour allow onepound of fresh butter, three quarters of a pound of caraway com- fits, the well-beaten yolks of four, and the whites of two eggs, six table-spoonfuls of cream, and the same quanti- ty of fresh yeast. Melt the butter, mix it with the flour, and add the eggs, cream, and yeast, previously beaten together ; cover it, and let it rise for twenty or thirty mi- nutes, then shake in the caraway comfits, keeping a few to strew over the tops; form the buns, and bake them upon buttered tins.

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 228 sides thick and stiff. Take the bones out of a goose, turkey, and fowl, cutting each down the back; season them highly with pepper, salt, mace, cloves, and nutmeg, all finely pounded and well mixed. Lay the goose upon a dish, with the breast skin next the dish ; lay in the tur- key, put some slices of boiled ham and tongue, and then the fowl; cover it with little bits of ham or bacon. Put it all into the pie, made of an oval form, and the sides to stand an inch and a half above the meat; put on the top, and make a hole in the centre of it. Brush the outside of the pie all over with the beaten whites of eggs, and bind it round with three folds of buttered paper; paste the top over in the same way, and when it comes out of the oven, take off the paper, and pour in at the top, through a funnel, a pound and a half of melted butter.

Lay them into the pie-dish, and break down in the sauce the yolks of two hard-boil- ed eggs, and add it. This pie is better to be prepared the day before it is required. Cover it with a rich puff paste, and when the paste is sufficiently baked, the pie may be served. Another Sweetbread Pie.

Put them into a pie- dish, with some asparagus tops, forcemeat balls, and hard-boiled yolks of eggs, and slices of fat bacon on the top; cover it, and bake it till the paste be done enough ; or it may

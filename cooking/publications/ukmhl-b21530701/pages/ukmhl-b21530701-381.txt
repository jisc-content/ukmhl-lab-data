THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 337 raspings over it, put the cake into it, over the top of which strew sifted loaf sugar. Bake in a quick oven for half or three quarters of an hour. Water Cakes. Mix together three quarters of a pound of sifted loaf sugar, and one pound of dried and sifted flour, and some caraway seeds ; make it into a stiff paste, with the white of an egg beaten with a little water; roll it out very thin, cut the cakes round with the top of a glass or tin, prick them with a fork, and bake them upon buttered tins. Caraway Cakes. Mix half a pound of sifted loaf sugar with a pound of Hour and a quarter of a pound of butter, add some cara- way seeds; make it into a stiff paste, with three well- beaten eggs, and a little rose \yater; roll it out thin, cut it into round cakes, prick them with a fork, and bake them upon floured tins in a quick oven. Another way to make Caraway Cakes. Three quarters of a pound of flour, half a pound of butter well rubbed into it, a quarter of a pound of sifted loaf sugar, and some caraway seeds; make these into a stiff paste with a little cold water, roll it out two or three times, cut it into round cakes, prick them, and bake them upon floured tins. For a change, currants may be substi- tuted for the caraway seeds. Banbury Cakes. Strew some nicely-cleaned currants over a piece of puff paste, roll it out, cut it into round cakes with the top of a dredging box ; bake them upon floured tins, and the moment they are taken out of the oven, sift sugar over them, and put them upon a dish to cool. After ma- king pies, they may be made with the remainder of the paste. Y

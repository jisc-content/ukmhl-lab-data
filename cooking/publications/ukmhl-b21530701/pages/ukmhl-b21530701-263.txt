210 TIIE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. fruit pudding in paste, it must be buttered before being floured. All puddings in paste are tied tightly, but other pud- dings loosely, in the cloth. When a pudding is to be boiled in a shape, a piece of buttered white paper is put upon the top of it, before the floured cloth is tied on. The pan, dish, or shape, in which a pudding is to be either boiled or baked, must always be buttered before it is filled. It is an im- provement to puddings in general to let them stand some time after being prepared either for boiling or baking. When a pudding is to be boiled, it must be put on in a covered pot, in plenty of boiling water, and never for a moment be allowed to be oflf the boil until ready to be served. As the water wastes, more, and always boiling, must be added. A plum-pudding is the better for being mixed the day before it is to be boiled. It may be useful to observe that this pudding will keep for months after it is dressed, if the cloth be allowed to remain upon it, and if, when cold, it be covered with a sheet of foolscap paper, and then hung up in a cool place. When about to be used, it must be put into a clean cloth, and again boil- ed for an hour; or it may be cut into slices, and broiled as wanted. If in breaking eggs a bad one should acci- dentally drop into the basin amongst the rest, the whole will be spoiled ; and therefore they should be broken one by one into a tea-cup. When the whites only of eggs are required for jelly, or other things, the yolks, if not bro- ken, will keep good for two or three days, if the basin they are in be covered. A slab of marble, stone, or slate, is preferable to wood for rolling out paste on. The rolling-pin, cutters, and every other implement used in these processes, must be kept particularly clean ; they should always be washed

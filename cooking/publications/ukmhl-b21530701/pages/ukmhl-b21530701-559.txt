THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. From the different varieties having become so much intermixed and blended together, (this is especially the case in Scotland,) it is difficult to describe any particu- lar breed of swine. The Berkshire is allowed to be a good kind. They are generally of a brown, or rather a reddish colour, with black spots, the ears bending for- ward, but not hanging down so much as those of the large Cumberland kind ;—they are short-legged and small-boned ; their flesh is fine ; and they are well dispo- sed to fatten on common fare.—The large spotted Wo- burn breed is well formed, prolific, hardy, and kindly disposed to fatten.—The Chinese black, or pot-bellied breed, are small in size, their necks thick, and legs short. They are one of the most profitable sorts in this island, as their flesh is delicate, and they fatten on very indif- ferent food, and more readily than any other small breed ; indeed they may be said to be always ready for killing. They are excellent for bacon, and are well adapted for being used as pork. When young, that is, when about four months old, they are very mischievous when not well ringed.* And for those who do not like very fat pork, the small breeds before mentioned will be prefer- able, their flesh being equally delicate.—There is another small breed, which is by far the best for the farmer, but it cannot be classified ; they will feed in a shorter period, and will thrive upon articles that would starve the larger- sized animals. The kind in view will feed upon com- mon fare to seven or eight stones Amsterdam when ele- ven or twelve months old, or to nine or ten stones when put up in the house to receive better food. For a large establishment, a boar and two good sows, of a proper age, should constantly be kept; and one young sow annually reared, in order to supply the others, when they pass maturity, that is, when they arrive at * The usual method of ringing swine is now superseded by an improved method adopted by Mr Tubb, which is to pare oft', with a sharp penknife, the gristle on the tops of the noses of youn’• pigs.

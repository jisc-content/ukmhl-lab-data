When hot, add the venison cut into thin slices, heat it thoroughly, and serve with sippets of toasted bread. To Stew Partridges.

Stuff the in- side of the birds, tie them at both ends, and put them in- to a stew-pan lined with slices of bacon; add a quart of good stock, half a pint of white wine, two onions, a bunch of sweet herbs, and a few blades of mace; let them stew gently till tender; take them out, strain and thicken the sauce with flour and butter, make it hot, and pour it over the partridges.

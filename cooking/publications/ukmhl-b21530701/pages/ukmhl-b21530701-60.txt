]() THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Boil some whole carrots and turnips, or cut them in half, to put round the head, trotters, and neck in the dish. In summer, green peas are a great improvement to this broth. Scotch Barley Broth. In two gallons of cold water, boil six ounces of bar- ley ; when it boils skim it, and put in a fowl and one pound of beef, or three pounds of the latter without the fowl; add three pounds of carrots and turnips, and three onions, cut very small. If greens are to be used, they will only require to be boiled an hour, and one ounce more of bar- ley is requisite. Skim it when the vegetables come to a boil, (ind keep the pot boiling constantly for five hours. The fowl ought to be taken out when boiled enough, and heated in the broth, so as to be served up with it, or in another dish. Or it may be made exactly in the same manner as the Sheepâ€™s Head Broth of the last receipt, substituting for the head, ribs of mutton, beef, veal, or fowl, and is better to be composed of a variety of these meats. Scots Kale. Put barley on in cold water, and when it boils take off the scum, put in any piece of fresh beef, and a little salt; let it boil three hours, have ready a cullender full of kale, cut small and boil them till tender. Two or three leeks may be added with the greens, if the flavour is ap- proved of. This broth is also made with salted beef, which must be put in water over night to soak. Leek Soup, which in Scotland is called Cocky Leeky. Wash and clean three or four dozen leeks, cut the white and tender green part in bits, about an inch long, and wash them again, and put them to drain in a cullender or sieve. Have ready boiling four quarts of stock, made from beef, seasoned with pepper and salt; put in the leeks, and boil them gently for three hours, adding a fowl time

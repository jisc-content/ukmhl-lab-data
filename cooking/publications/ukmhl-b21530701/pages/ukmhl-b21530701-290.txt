216 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Another way to make Tartlets. Roll out the paste about a quarter of an inch thick, and lay upon it the top part of the patty-pan; cut it round with the paste cutter. Rub the patty-pans with a little butter, and line them with the paste, and place in the middle a little bit of bread, which take out when they are baked.

Role out puff paste nearly a quarter of an inch thick, and, Avith a small saucer, or tin cutter of that size, cut it into round pieces; place upon one side raspberry or strawberry jam, or any sort of preserved fruit, or stewed apples ; wet the edges, fold over the other side, and press it round with the finger and thumb. Or cut the paste into the form of a diamond, lay on the fruit, and fold over the paste, so as to give it a triangular shape. Pyramid of Paste. Make a rich puff paste, roll it out a quarter of an inch thick, and cut it into five or seven pieces with scolloped tin paste cutters, which go one within another; leave the bottom and top piece entire, and cut a bit out of the cen- tre of the others; bake them of a light broAvn upon but-

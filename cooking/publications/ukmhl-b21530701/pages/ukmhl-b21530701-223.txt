179 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Another way is: About a quarter of an hour before the meat is taken from the fire, put a common dish with a tea-spoonful of salt in it under the meat; pour over it a small tea-cupful of boiling water; when it has all run into the dish, remove it, baste and froth the meat, and pour the gravy into the dish on which the roast is to be served. To draw Gravy. Put a few pounds of gravy-beef sliced, and a little whole black pepper, into a jar with a cover to fit closely; set the jar into a pot of cold water, and when it boils, add as it wastes more hot water, and keep it boiling gently for six or seven hours, when the richest gravy imaginable will be obtained. It may be used in that state, or reduced with water. To make a Pint of Rich Gravy. Brown a quarter of a pound of butter, dredging in two table-spoonfuls of flour, and stirring it constantly; add a pound of gravy-beef cut into small bits, and two or three onions chopped. When it becomes brown, add some whole black pepper, one carrot, a bunch of sweet herbs, and three pints of water; let it boil gently till reduced to one, then strain it. This gravy may be served With roasted turkey or fowl. Essence of Ham for Gravies. Pick off all the bits of meat from a ham-bone, pound it, break the bone, and put both into a sauce-pan, toge- ther with nearly half a pint of water, and a bunch of sweet herbs; simmer gently for some time, stirring it occasionally; then add a pint of good beef gravy, and some black pepper, and continue to simmer it till it be well flavoured with the herbs ; strain, and keep it for im- proving rich gravies and sauces of all descriptions.

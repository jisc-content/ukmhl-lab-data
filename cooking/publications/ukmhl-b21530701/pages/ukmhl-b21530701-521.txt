THE PRACTICE'OF COOKERY. 477 or soft water, is always to be preferred to that taken immediately from a spring or well. The best general soil for a garden is a loam of a mid* dling quality, partaking more of the sandy than the clayey nature. If a strong and a light soil can both be had, it will be so much the better, as the different plants may thus have the ground best adapted to their respective kinds. Cabbages. The best soil for cabbages is a rich mould, rather clayey than sandy; and it can scarcely be too much manured, as they are an exhausting crop. The kinds generally preferred for summer use, are, the small early dwarf, large curly Yorkshire, early dwarf Yorkshire, early Battersea, and early sugar loaf. These are ready for use from April or May to July; for autumn and winter, the imperial, large sugar-loaf, hollow sugar-loaf, and the long or large-sided. The large Drum, white Strasburg, the Scots, and the American cabbage, resist the severity of winter, and grow to a very large size ; but they are coarse kinds. The time of sowing for the summer crop is the beginning of the August of the preceding year. An open spot of rich light earth must be chosen, and the seeds of this, and of all the kale tribe, require a covering of no more than an eighth, or a quarter of an inch, in thickness of mould. In about six or eight weeks after the sowing, or when the plants have got several leaves, they are thinned ; and those plants taken out of the seed- bed are pricked into other beds, at three inches distance every way. By these means, they have room to grow firm and shapely. In October and November, part of this crop is finally planted out, the remainder early in

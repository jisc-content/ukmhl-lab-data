422 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Balm Beer. Eleven gallons of water and ten pounds of brown sugar are to be clarified with the whites of twelve eggs, carefully skimmed, and boiled till nearly reduced to ten gallons; two pounds and a half of the yellow flower of lemon balm being put into a cask, the liquor, when milk- warm, is to be poured over it, and four or five table-spoon- fuls of thick yeast added. The cask must be filled up morning and evening with what works over it, and bung- ed up when the fermentation ceases; in a month the beer may be bottled, and in trvo or three months it will be fit for drinking. Half the quantity of the flower of lemon balm will probably be found to communicate a flavour suf- ficiently strong, if added when the fermentation is nearly over. Soda Water. Tartaric acid, half an ounce, arated soda, half an ounce. Have two tumblers about one-third full of wa- ter, put a tea-spoonful of the soda into one glass, and the same of the acid into the other; when dissolved, mix them together, and drink it immediately. The two sorts of salts must be kept in separate bot- tles, and should be bought ready powdered. Spruce Beer. When ten gallons of water, six pounds of treacle, and three ounces of bruised ginger have boiled together for half an hour, two pounds of the outer sprigs of the spruce fir are to be added, and boiled for five minutes ; the wlmle is then to be strained through a hair sieve, and when milk-warm, put into the cask, and a tea-cupful of good yeast stirred well into it. When it has fermented a day or two it is to be bunged up, and the following day bot- tled. It will be fit for use in a week. The ginger is sometimes omitted, and instead of the spruce fir, three ounces of the essence may be used, which is to be well whisked, together with the treacle,

There are the spindle-rooted and turnip-rooted ra- dishes ; of the turnip-rooted variety, there is a white and a red kind. - The short-topped purple or the pink radish, both spindle-rooted, may be sown for the earliest crop in the beginning of November, in a sheltered border; and they w'ill be ready for drawing early in March. More seed is sown in December and January, and sowings are con- tinued once a fortnight until April, in order to secure a succession of young roots. Any sort of soil will suit this plant. In the end of March, should the weather happen to be very dry, the crops must be regularly watered ; a slight covering of fern is useful early in spring, when sharp frosts occur; it may be raked off in the day timo and restored at night. If radishes are to be drawn small, they may stand at two inches apart; but if it be intended that the roots should grow large, they must be allowed twice that distance. The turnip-rooted radish is sown in February or March, and thinned out with a small hoe to within six inches apart. Indian Cress, or Nasturtium. A fresh, but poor soil, is better for this plant than a rich one. The seeds may be sown in April, in drills about two inches deep. The plants must have a support, as the stalks will grow to the height of six or eight feet. The seeds will be ready for use in August or September. There is aâ€™so a dwarfish variety, which may be allowed to spread on the ground. Burnet. A few plants only of this are sufficient. It may he raised from seeds sown in autumn, or by parting the roots. The stems should be two or three times cut over 2 i in summer.

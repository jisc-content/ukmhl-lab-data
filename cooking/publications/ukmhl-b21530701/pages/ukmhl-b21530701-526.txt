THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 482 drawing young plants for use, or by hoeing till they are within eight or ten inches of each other, if broadcast; but if in drills, which should be a foot apart, till they are six or seven inches separate. If the hoeing is not done in showery weather, a regular watering must be given after the operation. For an early crop, the early horn-carrot is used ; it is sown before the first of February in a warm border, which must be hooped over, and covered with mats during frost. A bed of the late horn-carrot may be sown in June or July, to afford young roots in the autumn months. Carrots are taken up at the first approach of winter, cleaned, and stored up with sand in a place that will exclude the frost. Parsnip. This plant requires a stronger soil than the carrot; it prefers a light loam ; but any soil will do, provided it be pretty deep. The seed, which should never be more than a year old, is sown in March; the plants are after- wards thinned out to about eight or ten inches asunder, and are kept clear of weeds. When the leaves begin to decay, the roots are fit for use. They may be stored as carrots; or, as frost will not injure them, they may be allowed to remain in the ground till the beginning of February ; but not longer, as then the flower-stalks be- gin to form, when the roots would become stringy. Scorzonera. The seeds of scorzonera are sown in the middle of April, in a cool deep soil, in drills about a foot separate. Afterwards the plants are thinned out to within four inches apart. The roots may be either lifted in November, and stored as carrots, or they may remain in the ground all winter. Salsify. Salsify is sown in April, and afterwards thinned to within six or eight inches apart. A mellow and deep *oil affords the best plants. The roots may remain in

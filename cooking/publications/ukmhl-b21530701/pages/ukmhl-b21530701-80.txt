Let the whole cool so that it may be formed into balls about the size of the yolk of an egg, poach them in boil- ing water, and add them to the turtle. Before serving, mix a little cayenne with the juice of two or three lemons, and add it to the soup. It is generally preferable to pre- pare the soup the day before it is required for use, and it will be best heated in a water bath, or flat vessel con- taining water, which is kept always very hot, but not al- lowed to boil. By the same method, sauces, stews, and other made dishes may be kept hot. When the fins of the turtle are to be served as a side dish, they must be first parboiled, then skinned, and stewed in a little turtle sauce, with some port wine, and seasoned with cayenne, salt, and a little lemon juice, and thickened with butter and flour. Fricandeaux and Blanquettes may also be made of the flesh of the turtle, in the same way as those of veal.

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 425 ter, one pound of sweet almonds blanched, and one pound of honey; put into small pots, and pour over a little orange- flower or rose water; tie them over closely with paper. Lavender Water. Put into a large bottle, eight ounces of the best recti- fied spirits of wine, three drachms of oil of lavender, one drachm of essence of ambergris, and threepence-worth of musk ; cork it tightly, and shake it well every day, for a fortnight or three weeks. To make Ink. To four ounces of bruised galls, allow two of copperas, and two of gumarabic; put the galls into a large bottle, with three pints of rain-water, and in three or four days dissolve the gum in hot water, and add it with the cop- peras ; shake the bottle frequently for some days.

Or mix in a tea-cup one tea-spoon- ful of oil of vitriol, and two of common salt; place it in warm ashes ; hold the stained part over it, and the stain will soon disappear; then wash the part in cold water.

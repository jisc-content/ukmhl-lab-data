THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY 162 CHAPTER IX. CURRIES. Currie. Cut a fowl into small pieces, skin it, and let it blanch in cold water for two hours ; mince an onion very small, and put it into a sauce-pan, with two ounces of butter, and a large table-spoonful of flour of rice stirred in by degrees; brown it well, and when just boiling, add a quart of cold water, with the pieces of fowl and a large table-spoonful of currie powder mixed in it. Let it boil till the fowl be quite tender, and just before serving, squeeze the juice of half a lemon over the blade of a knife into it. Vinegar will answer instead of the juice; and if it be required very fine, in place of rice, thicken it with an ounce of sweet almonds blanched and pound- ed. Currie of Veal. Cut part of a neck of veal into cutlets, and make a gravy of the trimmings ; season it with pepper, salt, and an onion ; strain and thicken it with flour and butter, and add two spoonfuls of currie powder. Fry the cutlets with an onion minced very small, in butter, of a light brown colour, and then stew them in the prepared gravy- till they become quite tender. Before serving, add the juice of half a lemon, and a little Chili pepper.

3 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Mullagatawny Soup. 1â€™ut hall a pound of fresh butter, with six large onions sliced, three cloves of garlic, some chopped parsley, and sweet marjoram, into a stew-pan, let it stew over a slow tire till of a light brown colour ; cut in small pieces five pounds of lean beef, and let that stew till the gravy be ex- tracted, and then put in three quarts of boiling water, and half a pound of Scotch barley, ami let it simmer four hours very slowly ; mix four table spoonsful of currie-pow- der with cold water, and add it to the stock ; take out the beef, and rub the barley through a sieve, to thicken the soup. Cut a fowl in joints, skin it, and put it in a stew-pan with a piece of butter, and let it stew till quite tender; the stew-pan must be kept closely covered : this to be added to the soup, the last thing, with a pint of boiling milk, and the juice of two lemons. Boiled rice must always be served with this soup. Another Mullagatawny Soup. Make a strong stock of the bones of roasted beef, mut- ton, and fowl; while it is preparing, put into a stew- pan, with six ounces of butter, three quarts of sliced turnip, two quarts of carrots, and eight large onions also sliced; let them stew upon the stove till tender; then add three quarts of the prepared stock, a large slice of the crumb of bread, and two table-spoonsful of currie-powdei; let them stew four or five hours ; strain it through a tammy cloth, with two wooden spoons, taking care that no bones be left amongst the vegetables ; if too thick to go through, add more stock. Then cut a fowl in pieces, fry it in a frying-pan with butter, and add it to the soup; af- ter it has boiled a little, draw it to the side of the stove, and let it simmer, that the grease may be taken off. A little good beef stock, in addition to that made of the bones, will be an improvement. It is sometimes thicken- ed with whole or ground rice, instead of bread, and ought to be made upon a stove,

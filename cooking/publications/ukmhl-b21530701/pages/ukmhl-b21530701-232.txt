THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 188 Lobster Sauce.

Another Lobster Sauce. Pound very finely the spawn of a lobster, rub it through a sieve, mix it with a quarter of a pound of melt- ed butter, then add the meat of the lobster cut into small bits. Make it quite hot, but do not allow it to boil. Sauce Robart, for Beef Steaks or Mutton Chops. Put into a sauce-pan a little gravy, two ounces of but- ter dredged with flour, a small slice of raw ham, and two or three minced onions; when the onions are browned, dust in a little more flour, and add nearly a pint of gra- vy, a little salt and pepper, a tea-spoonful of mustard, and a table-spoonful of vinegar. Boil it for some minutes, strain and serve it. A Sauce for Broiled Meat, Game, and Poultry. Bruise the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs with a little water and salt; bone one anchovy, and mince it, a small onion, two shalots, a little parsley and tarragon, and a few capers; mix them with the egg, add a table-spoonful of tine oil, a little mustard, two table-spoonfuls of lemon, and one of tarragon vinegar; mix all exceedingly well together, put it into a sauce-tureen, and serve it with the broil; or it may be served with cold veal.

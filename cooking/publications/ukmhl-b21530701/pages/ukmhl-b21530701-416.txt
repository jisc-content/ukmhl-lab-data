372 THE PRACTICE OT COOKERY. To Dry Apricots. Pare the apricots, and carefully take out the stones ; blanch the kernels, and put them into the apricots; strew over a pound of fruit the same quantity of finely-pound- ed loaf sugar, and let them stand till the sugar lias ex- tracted the juice, then boil all together gently; when the fruit is tender, take it out with care, and boil the sirup till very rich; pour it over the fruit, and in three days put it upon dishes, and dry them in the sun under gar- den glasses, turning them once or twice a-day, to keep the shape as round as possible. Any inferior apricots may be cut down and boiled in the sirup, for tarts. To Candy Angelica. Cut the stalks when thick and tender, put them on in boiling water, and when very tender, drain it off, and throw them into cold water; peel off the skin, and scald them in a thin sirup, made with the same proportion of sugar that there is of fruit; heat it twice a-day till the sirup is almost dried in, and then dry them under garden glasses, or in a stove, and turn them twice a-day. To Preserve Quinces. Pare the quinces, and at the end scoop out the core. Put them into a preserving-pan with water, and closely covered; let them boil till soft and of a fine red; when they are cold, put them into a sirup made with the same proportion of sugar as of quinces. The following day, boil them two or three times till clear, and the last time for twelve minutes. Cut some small quinces into quar- ters, put them into a sauce-pan with as much water as will cover them, boil it fast, till strongly flavoured of the quinces; strain it through a flannel bag, and boil a pint of the liquor with a pound of sugar till it be a rich sirup, and when cold, pour it over the quinces.

336 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Wafers. Mix, with six table-spoonfuls of dried and sifted flour, nearly a pint of thick cream, the well-beaten yolks of four eggs, three table-spoonfuls of sifted loaf sugar, and one of orange-flower water; beat all these well together. Heat the wafer irons, and put into them a table-spoonful of the batter; turn the irons, that the cake may be baked equally, and while hot, roll them round a stick. When cold, they will be very crisp. Rich Cake. To two pounds and a half of dried and sifted flour allow the same quantity of fresh butter washed with rose water, two pounds of finely-pounded loaf sugar, three pounds of cleaned and dried currants, one nutmeg grated, half a pound of sw eetmeats cut small, a quarter of a pound of blanched almonds pounded with a little rose water, and twenty eggs, the yolks and whites separately beaten. The butter must be beaten with the hand till it become like cream ; then add the sugar, and by degrees the eggs, after these the rest of the ingredients, mixing- in at the last the currants, with a tea-cupful of brandy, and nearly as much orange-flower water. This mixture must be beaten together rather more than an hour, then put into a cake-pan, -which has previously been buttered and lined with buttered paper; fill it rather more than three parts full. It should be baked in a moderate oven for three hours, and then cooled gradually by at first let- ting it stand some time at the mouth of the oven. Almond Cake. Blanch half a pound of sw^eet, and three ounces of bitter almonds; pound them to a paste in a mortar with orange-flower water; add half a pound of sifted loaf su- gar, and a little brandy; whisk separately, for half an hour, the whites and yolks of twenty eggs, add the yolks to the almonds and sugar, and then stir in the whites, and boat them all well together.

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 118 boiling water; let it boil gently for three hours. Boil the bones with an onion, a bunch of sweet herbs, salt, and white pepper; strain and thicken it with three table- spoonfuls of cream, the yolks of two eggs beaten up, and a bit of butter mixed with flour. Parboil and slice the sweetbread, dip it into an egg, and strew over it grated bread ; fry it with forcemeat balls. Serve the veal with the sauce poured over it. Garnish with the sweetbread and forcemeat balls. To Collar Veal. Bone a breast of veal, and beat it flat; cover the in- side with a nice stuffing moistened with eggs ; roll it very tightly, bind it, and bake it in an oven with some weak stock in the dish. Make a rich gravy; strain and thick- en it, and pour it over the veal. Serve with or without forcemeat balls, and garnish with cut lemon. It will keep for a long time, in a pickle made with bran and water, a little 6alt, and vinegar, poured cold over it. Neck of Veal k la Chreme. Cut the bones short of a small breast of veal, and skewer the flank underneath, and make the joint as square as possible. Lay it for two hours in oil, with chopped parsley, sliced shalots, pepper, salt, thyme, and bay leaves. Fold it in buttered paper, and fasten it upon the spit, so as to preserve the square form ; roast it about an hour and a quarter; take off" the paper, baste it with, and pour over it, a thick veloute sauce. Neck of Veal a la Barbarie. Trim a neck of veal neatly; lard it in chequers, with black truffles cut into nails. Stew the neck the same way as a fricandeau, putting bacon over the top, that the colour of the veal and truffles may he preserved. When done, glaze it slightly, and serve it with a sauce Italienne, with truffles.

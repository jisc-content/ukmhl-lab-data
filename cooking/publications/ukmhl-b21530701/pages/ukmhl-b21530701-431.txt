THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 387 nutmeg ami three cloves, steep them in a quart of vine- gar for a week, shaking it daily; then strain and bottle it. Shalot vinegar is made in the same manner. Harveyâ€™s, or Camp Vinegar. Put the following ingredients into two quarts of strong vinegar, three table-spoonfuls of Indian soy, and the same quantity of mushroom catsup, six anchovies, two heads of garlic, a quarter of an ounce of cayenne, and as much cochineal as will colour it; shake it two or three times a-day for a fortnight, then filter, and bottle it for use. Two tea-spoonfuls of this vinegar improves salad sauce, fish and sauce also, and is good in most made dishes. Elder Flower and Tarragon Vinegar. Fill a quart bottle with the flowers of elder, or the leaves of tarragon, when it is in flower; pour vinegar upon them, and let them infuse for a fortnight; then strain it through a flannel bag, and put it into small bottles. By the same means, vinegar may be flavoured with the fi esh-gathered leaves of any sweet herb. Vinegar front the Refuse of Raisin Wine. On the raisins from which ten gallons of wine has been made, five gallons of nearly boiling water is poured, the dregs or lees, and stalks, are added; it is then covered up, and stirred occasionally. When the taste is com- pletely extracted from the fruit, it is squeezed, and the vinegar strained and put into a cask, in which it should remain nine or ten months. Vinegar from Honey. Half a pound of honey must be put to a pint of water, and the honey well dissolved. This mixture is then ex- posed to the greatest heat of the sun, without closing wholly the bung-hole of the cask, which must be merely covered with coarse linen, to prevent the admission of in- sects. In about six weeks, the liquor becomes acid, and changes to a very strong vinegar, and of excellent quality.

The size of the tub must be adapted to the mode of brewing to be pursued. If it is proposed to mash only twice, its capacity should be eighteen gallons ; it ought to be nar- rower at top than at bottom. Two-third parts of any broad-bottomed cask will do very well for carrying on the operations of mashing in the small way. A metal cock is preferable to a wooden. For coolers, common washing-tubs will do tolerably well. For each firkin (nine gallons) of liquor to be brew- ed, (containing ale and beer together,) let these tubs contain on the whole fourteen gallons; if the number can be conveniently increased, it will expedite the cool- ing process. For a brewing of eighteen gallons, whether of the same or different liquors, one sixteen and one

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 220 immediately after being used, and then well dried. Before using butter for paste, it is laid for some time into cold water, which is changed once or twice. When salt butter is used, it is well worked in two or three waters. If it should not be convenient to make the paste immediately before it is baked, it will not suffer from standing, if made early in the morning, and the air excluded from it, by putting first a tin cover over the pie or tartlets, and above that a folded table-cloth. To ascertain if the oven be of a proper heat, a little bit of paste may be baked in it, before any thing else be put in. Puff paste requires rather a brisk oven. If too hot it binds the surface and pre- vents the steam from rising, and if too slow it becomes sodden and flat. Raised crusts require a quick oven; puffs and tartlets, which are filled with preserved fruit, are sufficiently done when the paste is baked. When large pies have been in the oven for a few minutes, a paper is put over them to prevent their being burned. Cheese cakes, queen cakes, spunge biscuits, and small spunge cakes, require a quick oven till they have risen ; afterwards the heat should be more moderate. Plum, seed cakes, and all large kinds, must be well soaked, and there- fore do not require a brisk oven. To preserve their colour, a sheet of white paper is put over them, and after they have risen and become firm, they are turned round. To ascer- tain if a large cake be sufficiently done, a broad-bladed knife is plunged into the centre of it, and if dry and clean when drawn out, the cake is baked; but if anything ad- heres to the blade, it must instantly be returned to t{ie oven, and the door closed. When the oven is too hot, it is better to lessen the fire than to open the door.

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 360 tie for fifteen minutes; carefully take off all the scum ; put it on the fire, and boil it till sufficiently thick, or if required, till candy high, in order to ascertain which, drop a little from a spoon into a small jar of cold water, and if it become quite hard, it is then sufficiently done; or dip the thevil into the sugar, plunge it into cold water, draw off the sugar which adheres to the stick, and if it be hard and snaps, the fruit to be preserved must be instantly put in and boiled. To Boil Sugar. To every pound of sugar allow half a pint of water ; stir it over the fire till the sugar be entirely dissolved ; when it first boils up, pour in a little cold water, and when it boils a second time, take it off the fire ; let it settle ten minutes, carefully scum it, and boil it for half an hour or a little longer, and then put in the fruit. Orange Marmalade. Allow equal weight of bitter oranges and fine loaf su- gar ; wash the oranges, wipe them dry, and grate off any discoloured part; cut the rind in half, and with a dessert- spoon loosen it all round to take off each of the halves en- tire ; take the core and seeds clean from the oranges, lea- ving the juice with the pulp ; put the skins into a sauce- pan with plenty of cold water, and cover it closely with a cloth underneath the cover; let them boil for some hours, till so tender that the head of a pin will easily pierce them; drain off the water, and while they are hot, with a silver spoon scoop out all the soft part, leaving the skins quite thin ; cut them into thin parings half an inch long ; cla- rify and boil the sugar candy high ; put in the parings, and in ten minutes add the juice and pulp, and boil all together till transparent. Part of the peel may be grated to heighten the colour, and a pound and a half of sugar to the pound of oranges may be used. Another way to make Orange Marmalade. t o three pounds of fruit allow five of sugar ; pare the

142 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Pickled Leg of Pork. Salt it eight or ten days, turn and rub it daily. Be- fore being dressed, let it lie in cold water for half an hour; put it on in cold water; when it boils, take off the scum, and let it simmer till done. ' If weighing seven or eight pounds, it will take nearly three hours to boil. Serve with peas-pudding and boiled greens.

Mix them with the grits and fat, and add a sufficiency of the blood to make it of a dark colour. The skins or guts must be very well washed, and when perfectly cleansed, laid into salt and water the night before. When they are to be filled, tie one end, and turn the inside out; half fill them, tie them of equal lengths or in rounds ; put them into hot water, and when they have boiled five minutes, take them out, prick them with a large needle, and then boil them half an h<Â£kr. When they are cold, hang them up in a cool dry place. Another way to make Black Puddings.. Prepare the blood as before directed, and to a pint and a half allow six ounces of rice boiled in a quart of milk till it be tender, the grated crumb of a lnlf-quar-

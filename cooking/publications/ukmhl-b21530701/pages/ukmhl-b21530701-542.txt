THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 498 Horse-Radish. The soil for horse-radish should be rich and deep. It is propagated by cuttings of the knotty parts of the root, provided these be furnished with one or two eyes. They are planted in February or March, in lines, leaving a foot and a half between each line. The sets are placed at the depth of at least a foot. The roots are not used till the second year, and then they are raised only as they are wanted. The bed will last for four or five years, care be- ing taken, in digging the roots, to leave the original set, or stock, untouched. Parsley. The curled parsley is the preferable variety. It may be raised in drills on the edge of a border. The seeds, which lie for a month or six weeks in the ground before springing, may be sown in February or early in March. In order to have fresh parsley leaves throughout the win- ter, some larch or beech branches may be laid over the parsley borders; and in hard weather, above these are spread dry bean-haum, fern, or reeds. Angelica. Angelica is easily raised from seed, which should be sown soon after it is gathered. It grows best in a moist soil, and thrives exceedingly well by the side of a ditch. Though a biennial plant, it may be made to con- tinue for several years, by cutting down the flower stem before it ripen to seed. Rhubarb. The kind cultivated for the table is called monkâ€™s rhubarb. It is propagated by means of offsets, which should be planted any time between November and Fe- bruary, in good soil, at the distance of three feet from each other. If the rhubarb plants be covered in No- vember with a good deal of stable-litter, the leaves will

Nests for breeders are generally preferred upon the ground, on account of the danger of chickens falling from those which are placed above. In making the nest, soft and short straw should be chosen. Various beds or heaps of sifted ashes or very dry sand should be placed in the yard, in which the fowls may have the com- fort and benefit of rolling and bathing themselves; and a place of refuge should be provided for such liens or chickens as the cock has taken a dislike to.

The floor may be slightly littered down; the litter often changed. The greatest cleanliness should be observed, and sandy gravel placed in several layers, and often changed. A sufficient number of troughs, for both water and food, should be placed around, that the stock may feed with as little interruption as possible from each other.

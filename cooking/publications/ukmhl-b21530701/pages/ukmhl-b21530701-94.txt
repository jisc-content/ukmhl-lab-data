50 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. White Fisli and Sauce. Make a rich gravy with a hit of veal, the heads and fins of four or five haddocks, three or four onions, some parsley, a little cayenne, black pepper and salt, the juice of a lemon, half the peel, a table-spoonful of catsup, half a pint of white wine, and two quarts of water; simmer them for an hour, strain, and put to it the meat of a lob- ster or crab minced, and forcemeat balls ; thicken it with half a pint of cream, the yolks of three eggs beaten, and a bit of butter kneaded in Hour.

Boil all these, and having put in the pieces of fish, let them boil fifteen mi- nutes, and add, just before dishing, a glass of white wine, and a little mushroom catsup and soy. Pick out the lemon peel and mace. Another Fish and Sauce with White Sauce.

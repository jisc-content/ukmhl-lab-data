31 THE TRACI'ICE OF COOKERY. Hard biscuit pounded may be used in place of short- bread., when a little fresh butter must be added. If any ot the force-meat is over, make it up in small balls. Water Souchy. Make a stock with three or four flounders, boiled in three quarts of water, two onions, and a bunch of parsley, till they are soft enough to pulp through a sieve with the liquor they were boiled in ; then season it with pepper, salt, and some parsley chopped, and boil in it a few flounders, with the brown skin taken off, some nicely cleaned perch or tench. Serve in a tureen, and with slices of bread and butter to eat with it. Pepper Pot in a Tureen. Stew gently in four quarts of water, till reduced to three, three pounds of beef, half a pound of lean ham, a bunch of dried thyme, two onions, two large potatoes pared and sliced ; then strain it through a cullender, and add a large fowl, cut into joints and skinned, half a pound of pickled pork sliced, the meat of one lobster minced, and some small suet dumplings, the size of a walnut. When the fowl is well boiled, add half a peck of spinach, that has been boiled and rubbed through a cullender; season with salt and cayenne. It is very good without the lean ham and fowl. Soup for the Poor. Wash an ox head very clean; break the bones, and cut the meat in pieces; put it on in thirteen gallons of water, with a peck and a half of potatoes, half a peck of turnips, the same quantity of onions, and some carrots ; peel and cut them all down. A handful of pot herbs, and two quarts of oatmeal; season with pepper and salt. Cover the pot closely, and let it stew till the next morning ; add as much hot water as may have wasted in boiling, letting it stew for some hours longer, when it will be fit for use. This soup will be found very good for a family dinner.

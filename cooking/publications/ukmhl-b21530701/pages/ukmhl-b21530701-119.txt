75 THE PRACTICE OE COOKERY. To Stew a Rump of Beef. Tie up the beef, and put it on to stew with nearly as much cold water as will cover it; add three pounds of fat bacon cut into slices, a handful of thyme, eight onions, four small carrots, two turnips, two or three bay leaves, some black pepper, a little allspice, mace, and three cloves, a pint of port wine and one of sherry. Let it stew gently between seven and eight hours. Take out the beef, strain the liquor, and skim off all the fat; thicken it with a little flour rubbed down in cold water, boil it up, and pour it over the beef. Have ready carrots and turnips, cut according to fancy, and boiled tender in weak gravy, and put them round the beaf before serving. Another way to Stew a Rump of Beef. Bind the beef tightly, stick in four cloves, and put it in a sauce-pan, with three quarts of water, a quarter of an ounce of black pepper half beaten, some salt, a bunch of sweet herbs, and three anchovies; turn it often, and when half done take it out, pour off the liquor; put in the beef again, with a pint of port wine and half a pint of table-beer made scalding hot, and some of the liquor strained; stew it till tender, clear offâ€™ the fat, and if the sauce is not strong enough, add well-seasoned beef gravy ; thicken it with flour rubbed down in a little cold water. Dish the beef, and pour the gravy round it. Another way to Stew a Rump of Beef. Fry a small rump, or fore rib of beef, in butter till it is brown all over. Make a sauce with butter browned with flour, and some water in which two or three onions have been boiled ; season with pepper, salt, and three table-spoonsful of vinegar; put in the beef, turn it fre- quently, and stew it gently for three hours. A little be- fore serving, add a tea-cupful of port wine. Carrots and turnips, cut into dice, may be stewed with it.

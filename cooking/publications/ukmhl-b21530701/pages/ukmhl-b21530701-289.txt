545 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Cherry Tart. The cherries may be stoned, and a few red currants added ; sweeten with loaf or brown sugar, and put into the bottom of the dish a small tea-cup; cover it with paste. Rhubarb Tart. Strip off ihe peel, and if the rhubarb is large, cut it into two or three strips, and then into bits about an inch long; sweeten well with brown sugar, and cover the dish with paste. Gooseberry Tart. Gooseberries, green-gage, magnum-bonum,and pur- ple-egg plums, damsons, and cranberries, are sweetened with brown sugar, and made into tarts in the same man- ner as the preceding. The tops and tails must be taken off the gooseberries, and the plums may be scalded and skinned. Cheshire Tart. Line a tart-dish with puff paste, fill it with a rich cus- tard ; pare and take out the core of three or four apples, place them in the custard, and put upon each some orange marmalade, or any other preserve. Bake it in an oven. Tartlets. Rub over patty-pans a little bit of butter, and line them with tart or puff' paste; fill them with marmalade, pre- served strawberries, raspberries, currants, or any sort of fruit. Take a small bit of the paste, and, with the hand, roll it upon the paste board with flour till it be stiff, and will draw out in straws; hold it on one hand, and with the other draw it out. With these small strings cross the tartlets according to fancy; wet the edge, and lay on a narrow rim of paste cut with the paste cutter.

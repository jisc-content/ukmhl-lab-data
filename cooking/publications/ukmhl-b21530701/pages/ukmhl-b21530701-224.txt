THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 180 Lobster Catsup. Choose a lobster that is full of spawn, and weighing as nearly as possible three pounds; pick out all the meat, and pound the red part or coral in a marble mortar ; when completely braised, add the meat, pound, and moisten it with a little sherry wine, mix with it a tea-spoonful of cayenne, add the rest of the bottle of sherry, and mix it thoroughly ; put it into two wide-mouthed bottles, and on the top put a small table-spoonful of whole black pepper, cork the bottles tightly, and tie them over with leather.

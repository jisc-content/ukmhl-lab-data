52 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. small haddock, strain it, and then make a stuffing with the boiled fish picked from the bones, a few bread crumbs, chopped parsley, and some butter, and season it with salt and pepper; stuff the haddocks, and put them with the sauce into a deep dish, and bake them. A pie is made in the same tvay, taking off the skin and the heads of the fish, cutting them in two, and adding a glass of white wine. Another way to Bake Haddocks. Clean, skin, and take off the heads of three good-sized haddocks ; season grated bread crumbs with pepper, salt, and finely minced parsley ; strew some over the bottom of a dish, put in the fish, and strew more seasoned bread crumbs all over, then put a little bit of butter here and there, and pour in as much gravy or water as the dish will hold. They will take an hour to bake, and when they begin to look brown, strew over a few more bread crumbs, seasoned as at first. To Fry Small Fresh Haddocks. Clean and scrape off the scales; cut offâ€™ the fins and tails, the heads may be taken off or not, wipe them dry, rub them over with the yolk of an egg beaten, and dust them with flour; fry them in boiling lard or beef drip- ping, when one side is of a brown colour, turn them, and when done, lay them upon the back of a sieve before the fire to drain ; garnish writh fried parsley. Another way to Fry Haddocks. When perfectly fresh, take off the heads and skins, and cut out the bones very carefully; divide each side in two, wash them well, and lay them in a cloth to dry ; have the yolk of an egg be.at up in a plate, dip the fish into it, and strew over sifted bread crumbs mixed with chopped parsley that has been boiled, and fry them in fresh beef dripping or lard ; garnish the dish with fried parsley. Haddocks dressed in this way make a nice garnish for boiled cod fish, or plain boiled haddocks.

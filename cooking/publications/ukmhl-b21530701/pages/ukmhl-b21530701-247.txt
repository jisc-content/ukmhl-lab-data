THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 203 put for a large dish four ounces of butter, two eggs beat up in half a pint of good milk, and some salt; mix them well together, heap it upon the dish with a table-spoon to give it a rough and rocky appearance, or put it on the dish and score it with a knife, dip a brush or feather into melted butter, and brush over the top lightly ; put it into a Dutch oven, and let it brown gradually for an hour or more. To mash potatoes in a plain way, mix with them two ounces of butter, half a pint of milk, and a little salt. When mashed potatoes are not browned, it is a great improvement to add white pepper, salt, and one onion minced as finely as possible ; heat the potatoes in a sauce- pan, and serve them hot. To Broil Boiled Potatoes. After boiling potatoes, not quite sufficiently to send to table, put them on a gridiron over a clear fire, and turn them frequently till they are'of a nice brown colour all over; serve them hot; take care they do not become too hard, as that spoils the flavour. To Brown Potatoes under Meat while Roasting. After being boiled, lay them on a dish, and place it in the dripping-pan, baste them now and then with a little of the meat dripping, and when one side is browned, turn the other; they should all be of an equal colour. Potatoe Ribands. Wash four or five large potatoes, scrape them, and cut them into thin strips round ahd round, keeping as nearly to one width as possible; throw them into cold water as they are cut, and then fry them of a light brown in boiling beef dripping; strew over them a little 6alt and pepper, and before serving, drain them upon a dish turned up before the fire.

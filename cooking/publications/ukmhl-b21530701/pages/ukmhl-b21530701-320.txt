Wash in four or five waters half a pound of good rice ; tie it into a pudding cloth, not too tightly; put it on in a pot of cold water, and when it boils, let it boil for two hours. It may be eaten with cold butter and sugar, or treacle. Oatmeal Porridge. Boil some water in a sauce-pan with a little salt, and stir oatmeal into it with a thevil; when of a proper thick- ness, let it boil for four or five minutes, stirring it all the time ; then pour it into a dish, and serve with it cream or milk. It is sometimes eaten with porter and sugar, or ale and sugar. If made with milk instead of water, less meal is re- quisite, and it is then eaten with cold milk. Bread and Butter Pudding. Butter a mould ; lay into the bottom thin-cut bread and butter, with the crust pared off; strew over it a layer of currants and stoned raisins mixed ; half fill the shape, and add half a pint of brandy or rum, or currant wine may be used ; in an hour, pour over it a quart of good milk, mixed with six â€¢well-beaten eggs, half a nutmeg grated, and some brown sugar ; boil it for one hour and a half, and serve it with melted butter, cun-ant wine, and sugar. Yorkshire Pudding.

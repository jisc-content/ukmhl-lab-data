28 G THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Another way to make Omelette Soufflet. Beat six yolks of eggs with two table-spoonfuls of su- gar, one of flour, a little salt, half a wine glass of orange- flower water, or the grated peel of half a lemon ; mix in the well-beaten whites the last tiling ; fry, and serve it with grated sugar over the top. Apple Soufflet. Prepare apples as for baking in a pudding, put them into a deep dish, and lay upon the top, about an inch and a half thick, rice boiled in new milk with sugar; beat to a stiff froth the whites of two or three eggs, with a little sifted loaf sugar, lay it upon the rice, and bake it in an oven a light brown. Serve it instantly when done Rich Soufflet. Soak in white wine and a little brandy, sweetened with sugar, some slices of spunge-cake; put them into a deep dish, and pour over them a rich custard; beat to a stiff froth the whites of three or four eggs, and with a table-spoon lay it over the top in heaps to look rough; brown it in a Dutch oven, and serve quickly. Rice Soufflet. Soak in half a pint of milk, for an hour, one ounce of rice, and the peel of a lemon cut thin ; put it into a sauce- pan, with a little salt, and add by degrees a pint of new milk, and a bit of butter the size of a walnut; stir it till it boil, and for five minutes after. When cool, add the yolks of six eggs, beaten with two table-spoonfuls of pounded loaf sugar, and stir in the well-beaten whites of the eggs, and dress the soufflet in the dish like a pyra- mid. Bake it in an oven. It may be made with two table-spoonfuls of potatoe flour, which mix with a little milk, and a little salt, and then thicken it over the fire with more milk ; put a little orange-flower water, or any other perfume ; whilst in the oven, it may be glazed with sifted loaf sugar.

TIIE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 165 fore serving, skim off the fat, anil add a tea-spoonful of lemon juice or vinegar. Rabbit, fowl, and sweetbreads should be parboiled. To Boil Rice. Wash the rice perfectly clean, and put on one pound in two quarts of cold water; let it boil twenty minutes, strain it through a sieve, and put it before the fire; shake it up with a fork every now and then, to separate the grains, and make it quite dry. Serve it hot. Currie Powder. Pound extremely fine, in a mortar, six ounces of co- riander seed, three ounces of black pepper, one ounce and a half of fennigreck seed, one ounce of cummin seed, three ounces of turmeric, and three quarters of an ounce of cayenne; sift it through muslin, and put it before the fire for four or five hours, stirring it every now and then. Keep it in a bottle with a glass stopper. Another way to make Currie Powder. One pound of rice picked clean, eight ounces of co- riander seed, four ounces of cummin seed, and four oun- ces of yellow mustard seed. Put all these into a frying- pan, stir it constantly until it becomes quite hot, taking care it does not brown ; then grind it in a pepper-mill, with six ounces of cayenne, and two ounces of turmeric. Sift it through muslin, and grind the coarser part, repeating this till it is all sufficiently fine, and keep it in bottles with glass stoppers. Another way to make Currie Powder. Dry and finely pound the following ingredients: half a pound of turmeric, two ounces of ginger, the same of black pepper; of cummin seed, fennigreck seed, and cay- enne, half an ounce each. Mix them thoroughly, and dry it before the fire for some hours. Keep it in a well- corked bottle.

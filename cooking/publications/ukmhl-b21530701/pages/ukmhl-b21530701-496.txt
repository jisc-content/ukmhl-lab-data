THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 452 pend on convenience. One general rule must, however, be observed, that every pair of pigeons have two holes or rooms to nest in. Cleanliness is one of the first and most important considerations. They will thrive the better if cleaned daily, and thoroughly once a-weekâ€”the floor, covered with sifted gravel, often renewed. They are exceedingly fond of water, and when confined in a room, should have a pan of water, often renewed, as a bath ; and to take their attention from the garden, and to prevent their picking the mortar from buildings, they should be provided with a salt cat, which is a dish of the following composition : loam, sand, mortar, fresh lime, bay salt, cummin, coriander, carraway seed, and allspice, moistened with wine, heaped up in the dish, and a piece of board placed upon the summit to prevent the birds from dunging upon it. It is always injudicious to purchase old pigeons for stocking, as even cutting their wings will not ensure their remaining. Squeakers, or such as have not yet flown, will become perfectly domesticated if confined for a short time. In justice to the farmer, the proprietor of pigeons ought to feed them regularly, more particularly in seedtime, and towards harvest, and also when the ground is bound by frost, or covered with 6now. Tares, and the smallest kind of horse-bean, commonly called pigeon-beans, are both the best and cheapest food, and the pulse is better to be of the previous year.

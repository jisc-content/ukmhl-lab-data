THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 491 unless when they rise absolutely in clusters. They will be lit for use in August. Leek. Leeks are raised much in the same way as onions. There are three varieties of them ; the narrow-leaved or Flanders, the broad-leaved or tall London, and the Scotch or flag-leek ; this last is by much the most hardy. They are, about the beginning of March, sown closely in beds, and in June or July are planted out in rows, first trim- ming oft" the tips of the leaves and the points of the fi- brous roots. A good way is, to make a deep hole with a dibble, and merely lay in the leek plant up to the leaves without closing the earth about it; this encourages the stem to swell and lengthen, while at the same time it blanches it. But this plan may be adopted only in moist weather, or the plants must be well watered, to ensure their taking root. If the leaves be topped two or three times during the summer, the leeks will grow to a larger size. They are ready for use in autumn and winter. Cibol. Cibols are raised from seeds, which are sown in July. The seedling plants soon appear; but, in the course of the month of October, the leaves go oft", and the ground seems quite bare. In January, however, they again be- gin to shoot, and by March they are fit for use. Chives. Chives are readily propagated by parting the roots, either in autumn or spring, and they will grow in any soil or situation. They should be repeatedly cut during the summer, the successive leaves produced in this way being more tender. A small bed or border thus ma- naged will afford a sufficient supply ; it will continue pro- ductive for three or four years, when a new plantation should be made.

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 83 beef, with some salt, pepper, and a finely minced onion â€”half a minced apple is an improvement; add a little hot water; cover the pan closely, and let them stew till tender. Another way to make Scots Collops. Cut some very thin slices of beef; rub with butter the bottom of an iron stew-pan that has a cover to fit quite closely; put in the meat, some pepper, and a little salt, a large onion, and an apple minced very small. Cover the stew-pan, and let it simmer till the meat is very ten- der. Serve it hot. Beef Rissoles. Chop finely a pound of lean tender beef, and a quar- ter of a pound of beef-suet; pound them in a marble mortar; mix with it a quarter of a pound of grated bread, a little onion, and a head of garlick bruised ; season with salt and pepper; bind it with three eggs well beaten ; make it up into small cakes, fry them of a light brown, then stew them in gravy for fifteen or twenty minutes. To Stew a Tongue. Wash it very clean, and rub it well with common salt and a little saltpetre; let it lie two or three days, and then boil it till the skin will pull off. Put it into a sauce-pan, with part of the liquor it has been boiled in, and a pint of good stock. Season with black and Jamaica pepper, and two or three pounded cloves; add a glass of white wine and a table-spoonful of mushroom catsup, and one of lemon pickle; thicken the sauce with butter rolled in flour, and pour it over the tongue. Pickled Tongue Glazed and Bigarree. Boil a large tongue till it be tender, skin and glaze it, and serve it with mashed turnips on one side, and mashed carrots, or carrots and spinach, on the other.

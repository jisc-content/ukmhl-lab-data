THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 53 To Fry Haddocks in Sauce. Skin and cut oft’ the heads of three or four haddocks, divide eacli into four pieces, wash them clean. Put a large table-spoonful of butter, with two spoonsful of Hour into a frying-pan, and brown it; mince small two onions and put pepper and salt upon them, and add them to the browned butter, and pour in as much boiling water as will nearly cover the pieces of fish ; let it boil, put in the fish, and when one side is done, turn the other ; dish it hot, and pour the sauce over ; garnish with parsley. Omit the onions if the flavour is not liked, and substitute a ta* ble-spoonful of mushroom catsup, and one of lemon pickle. Finnan or Aberdeen Haddocks. Clean the haddocks thoroughly, and split them, take off’ the heads, put some salt on them, and let them lie two hours, or all night, if they are required to keep more than a week ; then, having hung them two or three hours in the open air to dry, smoke them in a chimney over peat or hardwood saw-dust. Where there is not a chimney suitable for the purpose, they may be done in an old cask open at both ends, into which put some saw-dust with a red-hot iron in the midst; place rods of wood across the top of the cask, tie the had- docks by the tail in pairs, and hang them on the sticks to smoke; the heat should be kept as equal as possible, as it spoils the fish to get alternately hot and cold ; when done, they should be of a fine yellow colour, which they should acquire in twelve hours at furthest. When they are to be dressed, the skin must be taken off. They may be boiled, or broiled; and are generally used for breakfast. To Fry Whiting. Scrape off the scales and cut off the fins, wipe them dry with a clean cloth ; dredge them with flour, or heat up the yolk of an egg, and with a feather rub them over with it, and sprinkle them with finely grated bread crumbs.

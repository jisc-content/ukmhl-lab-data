THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 345 beaten eggs; break the paste into small bits or knobs, and bake them upon floured tins. Small Rout Cakes. Rub into one pound of dried and sifted flour, half a pound ot butter, six ounces of pounded and sifted loaf sugar, and the yolks of two well-beaten eggs; mix them all into a paste with a little lâ€™ose water; divide the quan- tity, put a few dried currants or caraway seeds into one half; roll out the paste, cut it into small round cakes, and bake them upon buttered tins. Sugar Biscuits. Mix together one pound of dried and sifted flour, the same quantity of pounded and sifted loaf sugar, ten well- beaten eggs, and a few pounded cloves. Drop this upon floured tins, and bake it. Handsch Kirchen, or Glove Cake. With flour make into a paste thick enough to roll out, the beaten yolks of ten eggs, five table-spoonfuls of rich sweet cream, a little sugar, and some cardamoms ; cut it into fanciful forms with small tins, and throw them into fresh boiling lard or butter; when of a light brown colour, drain them before the fire. If fried in butter, add a little water to the butter, and make it boiling hot. Cake without Butter. Take the weight of three eggs in sugar, and the weight of two in flour; when the five eggs are well beaten, gra- dually add the sugar, and then the flour, with a little grated lemon peel, or a few caraway seeds. Bake it in a tin mould, in rather a quick oven. Common Cake. One pound and a half of flour, one pound ofgood brown sugar, eight well-beaten eggs, and one ounce of caraway seeds, are to be mixed together; then add of fresh yeast, milk, and of water, one table-spoonful each. Let it stand a little time, and bake it in a floured tin.

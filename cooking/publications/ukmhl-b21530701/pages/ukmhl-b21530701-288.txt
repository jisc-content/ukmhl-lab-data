Mix all these ingredients well with a quart of brandy. Lemon Mince Pies. Weigh one pound of fine large lemons, cut them in half, squeeze out the juice, and pick the pulp from the skins ; boil them in water till tender, and pound them in a mortar; add half a pound of pounded loaf sugar, the same of nicely cleaned currants, and of fresh beef suet minced, a little grated nutmeg, and citron cut small. Mix all these ingredients well, and fill the patty-pans with rather more of the mince than is usually put. Apple Pie. Pare, quarter, and core the apples; cut them into thin bits. Put into the bottom of a pie-dish a table- spoonful of brown sugar, with half a tea-spoonful of gra- ted ginger and lemon peel, then a layer of apples, and so on alternately, till the dish is piled as full as it will hold. The next day wet the rim of the dish, line it with puff or tart paste, brusli it with water, and cover it with paste ; press the edge all round, notch it with a paste cutter, and make a small hole with the point of a knife in the middle. It may be seasoned with two table-spoonfuls of lemon or orange marmalade, pounded cinnamon, mace, and cloves, in addition to the ginger and lamon peel. Currant Tart. To a quart of red currants add one pint of red rasp- berries, strawberries, or cherries; sweeten them well with brown sugar; before putting in the fruit, line the side of the dish with tart paste, place in it a small tea-cup, put in the fruit, and cover it with paste. Four ounces of brown sugar are generally allowed to a quart of fruit.

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 493 close to tlie ground. In November a portion of earth is drawn towards each plant, and some long dung, peas- haum, or the like, is laid around, but kept at some dis- tance from the stems and leaves of the plants. In March or April, the litter and earth are removed, the stocks are examined, and two or three of the strongest and best shoots being selected for growing up, the rest are detach- ed. Every season, at the winter dressing, some small rotted dung or fresh sea-weed should be dug into the ground. It is advisable to renew the artichoke planta- tion every six years. Cardoon. The best soil for cardoons is one that is light, and not too rich, but it ought to be deep. The seed is sown in the middle or end of May, in small hollows, about three inches deep, and four feet distant from each other every way. Two or three seeds are placed in each hollow to ensure a crop, but only the strongest plant is allowed to remain. The cardoon requires a good deal of water, and in very dry weather, this should be copiously supplied. In September, when the leaves will be large, they are tied up with hay or straw bands for blanching, leaving on- ly the top free, but a dry day must be selected for the pur- pose ; at the same time a hillock of earth is formed around each plant to the height of a foot or eighteen inches, and this is smoothed on the surface that the rain may run off, and not fall into the centre of the plants. As they ad- vance in growth, additional bands of straw are added, and the earth is raised higher. They will be ready for use in two months after the commencement of the blanching. In severe frost, the tops are covered with haum or long litter. Lettuce. Of each of the two kinds of lettuce, the coss, also call- ed the Roman and ice, and the cabbage lettuce, there are many varieties. Of the coss lettuces, the Egyptian green, the white coss or Versailles, and the royal cape lettuce,

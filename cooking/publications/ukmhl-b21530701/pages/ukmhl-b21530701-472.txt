TI1E PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 428 the floor, and with a scrubbing-brush and cold water, scrub the boards up and down, but not across, and finish by scrubbing with plenty of cold water. Very fine sand and cold water may be used in general; and to extract grease, mix some pearl-ashes in hot wrater, and use it with fine sand. Equal proportions of spirits of salt, and of vi- negar mixed, will extract all stains out of floors. To Wash Stone Stairs and Halls. Wash them first with hot water and a clean flannel, and then wash them over with pipe-clay mixed in water. When dry, rub them with a coarse flannel. To take Oil and Grease out of Floors and Stone Halls. Make a strong infusion of potash with boiling water ; add to it as much quick-lime as will make it of the con- sistence of thick cream ; let it stand a night, then pour oft' the clear part, which is to be bottled for use. When wanted, warm a little of it; pour it upon the spots, and after it has been on them for a few7 minutes, scour it off with warm water and soap, as it is apt to discolour the boards when left too long on them. When put upon stone, it is best to let it remain all night; and if the stain be a very bad one, a little powrdered hot lime may be put upon it before the infusion is poured on. To Clean Floor Cloths. Sw7eep them clean, and wash off any dirty spots with a spunge and cold w^ater, then rub them with a coarse flan- nel, and polish with a clean one. To Prevent Creaking Hinges.

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 431 upon a cloth on the floor, and when dry, beaten in the same manner. To Wash Head and Clothes Brushes. In a pint of boiling water, put a dessert-spoonful of pearl-ashes, and shake the brush about in it till it be per- fectly clean ; then pour some clean hot water over it; shake, and dry it before the fire. To Wash Flannels and Worsted Things, to prevent their Shrinking, and to keep them of a good Colour. Take half the weight of soda that there is of soap ; boil them with water, allowing a gallon to every pound of soap, and use it when perfectly cold. Wet the flannels in cold water, then wash them in fresh cold water, with some of the boiled mixture amongst it; wash them in this, changing the water till they become perfectly clean; then rinse them well in cold water, and dry them in the shade. Worsted stockings, washed in this manner, will be made quite clean; but particular care must be taken to wet them in clean cold w-ater, previous to washing them in the cold suds. Blankets should be washed in this way also, and when nearly dry, frequently shaken to raise the pile, and to make them soft. All dirty clothes should be laid in cold water the night before being washed. To Wash Cotton Stockings. Lay them in cold water at night; next day boil them in a copper with some soda and soap; stir them well about, and they will become quite clean without any rub- bing; rinse them well in cold water, and bleach them ; when nearly dry, draw them smooth, folding them straight over the instep. Place them under a heavy weight, or iron them.

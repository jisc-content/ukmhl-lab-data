480 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. feet and a half asunder, and two feet apart in the rows; but they must not be set deep in the ground. After this they must have repeated hoeings, and the earth must be drawn close up to the roots and stems. To diversify the time of forming heads, some of the early cauliflowers are planted out on different successive occasions. Cauli- flower will thrive the better that it have liberal supplies of the cleanings of the stable and cow-house. Brocoli. There are many varieties of brocoli; but the most useful kinds are the dwarf sulphur-coloured, and the kind called green brocoli. For an autumn crop, the seed is 6own in April, and planted out in the beginning of June. For a spring crop in the following year, the seed is sown late in May, or even in June; the seedlings are after- wards placed in nursery beds, where they remain till the middle or end of July, when they are finally transplanted in lines, two feet asunder, and a foot and a half apart in the lines. Water is given in dry weather; and they are hoed and earthed up like cauliflower. The heads of win- ter brocoli generally appear early in January, and con- tinue till April. A light and deep, but rich soil, in an open situation, is to be preferred for them. Sea weed is a useful manure for brocoli, and will prevent the grubs infesting its roots. Kohl-rabbi. Of the kohl-rabbi, or turnip-rooted cabbage, there are two varieties; the one having the stem swelling above ground ; the other having this turnip-like protuberance in it. i his plant may be cultivated in the same manner as brocoli; it is very hardy. Turnip. Most sorts of turnip like a sandy soil, not recently manured; but the yellow Dutch turnip does best in a good soil. For a spring crop the early Dutch is usually preferred; it may be sown, broadcast, in the month of

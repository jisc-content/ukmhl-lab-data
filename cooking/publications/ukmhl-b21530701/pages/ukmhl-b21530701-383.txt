339 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Small Almond Cakes. One pound of butter beaten to a cream, half a pound of finely-pounded and sifted loaf sugar, half a pound of dried and sifted flour, and the same quantity of blanched sweet almonds cut into thin small bits, one well-beaten egg, and a little rose water, must be mixed well together, and with a spoon dropped upon wafer paper or tins, and then baked. The Queenâ€™s Tea Cakes. Mix together half a pound of dried and sifted flour, the same quantity of pounded and sifted loaf sugar, the weight of two eggs in fresh butter, the grated peel of a lemon, and a little salt; beat the two eggs with a little rose water, and with them make the ingredients into a paste ; roll it out, cut it into round cakes, and bake them upon floured tins. Potato-Flour Cake. Mix half a pound of potato-flour, very much dried, with three quarters of a pound of pounded and sifted loaf sugar; roll it with a bottle. Beat separately the yolks and whites of eight new-laid eggs, and then mix them together ; whisk all the ingredients till quite light. Pleat the tin shape well, butter it, as also the paper, put in the cake, and bake it in a moderate oven for half an hour. If properly done, it will rise high and be light. Common Cake. Take two quarts of flour, mix with it three quarters of a pound of butter, a tea-cupful of fresh yeast, one pint of milk, nine well-beaten eggs, two pounds of well-clean- ed currants, one pound and a half of good brown sugar, the grated peel of a lemon, and one nutmeg; a glass of brandy must be stirred in just before it be put into a but- tered tin. Bake it for two hours or more.

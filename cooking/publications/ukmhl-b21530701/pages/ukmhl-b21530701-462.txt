THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 418 Milk Punch. The rinds of nine lemons are to be steeped, for eight- een hours, in two quarts of brandy, then mixed with the strained juice of the lemons, one and a half pound of su- gar, five pints of water, and one grated nutmeg; one quart of new milk, made boiling hot, being added, it is to be strained through a jelly-bag. Another way to make Milk Punch. In twenty quarts of brandy, the peel of thirty Seville oranges, and thirty-six lemons, are to be infused for twelve hours; thirty quarts of water and fifteen pounds of double-refined sugar are to be boiled, and when cold, the strained juice of the oranges and lemons is to be added to it; it is then to be put into a cask, together with the brandy, strained from the peel; a quart of boil- ing milk being poured into the cask, it is to be bunged up, and allowed to stand till it become fine before being bottled. It will be the better for remaining a year in the cask. Another way to make Milk Punch. Eight pounds of refined sugar are to be dissolved in the strained juice of three dozen lemons, and, when quite settled, two gallons of brandy, and two gallons and a half of cold water, are to be added, and also the lemon peel; one gallon of boiling milk being then poured over the in- gredients, they are to stand closely covered for twenty- four hours; when, being skimmed and run through a very thick jelly-bag, it may be quickly bottled, and will be fit for immediate use; but it improves by keeping. Ratafia. One gallon of brandy, three hundred kernels of apri- cots, the juice and very thin parings of eight lemons, and half an ounce of saffron; when these ingredients have, stood a fortnight, they are to be strained, and one pound

H5 TIIE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Stock made with bones may be substituted for fresh beef stock. Another Carrot Soup. Wash, scrape, and slice ten or twelve carrots, put them, with an ounce and a half of butter, into a stew- pan, cover it closely, and let them stew till sufficiently soft to press through a tammy or hair sieve ; add the pulp to as much well-seasoned stock as will make it of the thickness of rich cream, and boil it for twenty or thirty minutes. Hotch Potch. Cut in dice a good quantity of young turnips, carrots, and the tops of cauliflowers, with one or two lettuces, cut very small; put these vegetables, with a pint of full- grown peas, into four quarts of boiling water, and let it boil gently for two hours ; cut in neat chops a loin, or the best end of a neck of mutton, add them to the vege- tables, with salt, pepper, and some onions cut small; let them boil an hour and a half, then add three pints of green peas, and boil half an hour longer, when it is ready to serve. Another Hotch Potch. Put on, in three quarts of water, a small bit of the neck of mutton, or any scraps, one quart of carrots and turnips when cut in dice, and some salt; boil them gent- ly for an hour, then add a little cauliflower, lettuce, parsley, and onions cut small; boil a quart of full-grown peas in another sauce-pan, till sufficiently tender to press through a sieve; add it to the soup, taking out the bits of mutton, with three pints of young peas, and some nice mutton chops, and let it all boil till they are done enough. If the soup be too thick, a little before serving pour in some boiling water. Winter Hotch Potch. Boil for two hours or more, if not perfectly tender,

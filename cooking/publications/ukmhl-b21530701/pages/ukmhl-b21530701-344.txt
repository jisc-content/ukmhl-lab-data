Squeeze and strain the juice of eleven oranges, sweet- en it well with pounded loaf sugar, stir it over a slow lire till the sugar be dissolved, and take off the scum as it rises; when cold, mix it with the well-beaten yolks of twelve eggs, to which a pint of cream has been added ; stir it again over the fire till thick. Serve in a glass dish or custard-cups. Another way to make Orange Cream. Boil three quarters of an ounce of isinglass in halt a pint of water, till half reduced; sweeten well, with pounded and sifted loaf sugar, the strained juice of four oranges and one lemon; mix in the isinglass when nearly cold, and immediately stir in a pint of cream previously beaten to a froth ; stir it occasionally till it begin to stiff- en, and then put it into a mould. The juice of any sort of fruit may be managed in the same way, always add- ing the juice of a lemon. Another way to make Orange Cream. Sweeten, with pounded loaf sugar, a quart of good cream; mix with it a small wine-glass of orange-flower water, the grated rind and the juice of a Seville orange; whisk it till quite thick; soak some macaroons in white wine, and pile them in the middle of a glass or china dish, and heap the whipt cream over them as high as possible. Some hours after, ornament it with slices of green citron cut into straws, and stuck into the cream. Caledonian Cream. Mince a table-spoonful of orange marmalade; add it, with a glass of brandy, some pounded loaf sugar, and the juice of a lemon, to a quart of cream ; whisk it for half an hour, and pour it into a shape with holes in it, or put it into a small hair sieve, with a bit of thin muslin laid into it.

Sweetbreads a la Dauphine. If for a round dish, take four large and fine sweet- breads. If for a long dish, three will suffice. Pare off the fat and sinews, and blanch them in warm water, par- boil them, and when cold, lard them. Rub a stew-pan with fresh butter, and put into it a few sliced carrots and onions, then a layer of slices of fat bacon, place the sweet- breads upon the bacon, sprinkle a little salt over them, and stew them with a great deal of fire on the top, and a very slow one beneath ; when they are nicely brown- ed, cover them with a piece of buttered paper, cut round, and lessen the fire upon the top. They will require to stew for three quarters of an hour, then drain and put them into a pan, with some glaze, and the bacon under- neath. Leave them in the glaze till dinner time, drain them again, glaze them of a fine brown, and serve them with sorrel or endive. Italian Attelets of Sweetbreads.

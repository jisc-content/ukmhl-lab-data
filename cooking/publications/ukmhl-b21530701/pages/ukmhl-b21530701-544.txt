THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 500 Thyme. Thyme grows best in a light dry soil that has not been recently manured ; it is propagated by parting the roots, planting slips, or by sowing the seed in spring, Marjoram. Sweet-marjoram, or knotted-marjoram, is propa- gated by seed, a little of which should be sown every spring. Pot-marjoram is easily propagated by slips or cuttings, and is sufficiently hardy to withstand our win- ters. Winter sweet-marjoram requires a sheltered bor- der and a dry soil. It is a perennial plant, and is propa- gated by parting the roots in autumn. For winter use, both the kinds of sweet-marjoram should be dried slowly in the shade, and afterwards hung up in a dry place. Savory. Winter-savory is propagated by slips, or by cut- tings of the young roots, and also by seeds. It is hardy, and continues good for several years, especially in poor soils. Summer savory must be sown every spring, in shallow drills, thinly; the drills being eight or nine inches apart. Tarragon. In a dry loamy soil, tarragon proves quite a hardyplant; but it is apt to perish in a wet situation. It is easily propagated by parting the roots, or by planting in the spring young shoots with only two or three fibres. Tansy. Tansy is extremely hardy, and will grow in any soil. It is easily propagated at any season by parting the roots. Hyssop. A poor dry soil is most suitable to hyssop. It may

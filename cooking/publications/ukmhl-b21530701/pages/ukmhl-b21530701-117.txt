THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 73 PREPARATORY REMARKS ON REEF. Ox Beet' is considered the best. The flesh should feel tender, be fine in the grain, and of a bright red colour, nicely marbled or mixed with fat. The fat should be white, rather than of a yellow colour. Heifer Beef is excellent when finely fed, and is most suitable for small families. The bone should be taken out of a round of beef before it is salted, and it must be washed, skewered, and bound round firmly before being boiled. Salt beef should be put on with plenty of cold water, and when it boils the scum removed. It is then kept simmering for some hours. A piece weighing fif- teen pounds will require three hours and a half to boil. Carrots and turnips for garnishing should be put on to boil with the beef. If in the least tainted, a piece of charcoal may be boiled with it. When beef is to be kept any length of time, it should be carefully wiped every day. In warm weather, wood vinegar is an excellent preservative : it is put all over the meat with a brush. To protect the meat from flies, it may be sprinkled over with pepper. Tainted meat may be restored by washing in cold water, afterwards in strong camomile tea, after which it may be sprinkled with salt, and used the following day, first washing it in cold water. Roughly pounded charcoal rubbe 1 all over the meat also restores it when tainted. In si mmer, meat in Scotland is frequently kept a fortnight smothered in oatmeal, and carefully wiped every day; and if it should be a little tainted, it is soaked for some hours be- fore it is used, in oatmeal and water. These directions apply equally to all sorts of meat.

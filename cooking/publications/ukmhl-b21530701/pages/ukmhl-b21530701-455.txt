THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 41 1 fifteen pounds of sugar, are allowed ; the parsnips, being well cleaned, and cut into slices, are to be boiled in the whole or in a portion of the water ; when quite soft, they are to be taken out and mashed, then returned to the wa- ter they were boiled in, and being well stirred, are put through a hair sieve ; the sugar is then to be added to the strained liquor, and the quantity made up with boiled wa- ter ; when nearly cold, it is to be put into the cask with two spoonfuls of yeast, and three ounces of crude tartar, and stirred every day till the fermentation subsides, which may be in ten days or a fortnight; it is then bunged up, and may be racked and fined iu three or six months, and bottled iu six months more.

The fermentation having ceased, the almonds are to be withdrawn, and the cask bunged up, to stand about five months, when it may be fiued and bottled. Ginger Wine. To eight gallons of water, twelve pounds of sugar, three pounds of bitter oranges, five pounds of lemons, and thirteen ounces of ginger are allowed; the sugar and the ginger, bruised, are to be boiled with the water half an hour, and allowed to stand till next day; the fruit is to be pared very thin, and the strained juice, and half the peel, put into a cask with two gallons and a half of good whisky, or other spirit; when it has stood a night, the clear part of the boiled liquid is to be poured over it, the sediment being kept back; it does not ferment, and there- fore it is not necessary that the cask should be full; it is

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 302 Put into the dish it is to be served in one-third of Curds and Cream, as in Scotland. Put two quarts of uew milk into the dish in which it is to be served, and turn it with a tea-spoonful of rennet; when the curd has come, serve it with cream in a sepa- rate dish. Naples Curd. Put into a quart of new milk a stick of cinnamon, boil it a few minutes, take out the cinnamon, and stir in eight well-beaten eggs, and a table-spooniul of white wine ; when it boils again, strain it through a sieve ; beat the curd in a basin, together wTith about half an ounce of butter, two table-spoonfuls of orange-flower water, and pounded sugar sufficient to sweeten it. Put it into a mould for two hours before it is sent to table. White wine, sugar, and cream, may be mixed toge- ther, and poured round the curd ; or it may be served in a sauce-tureen. Kerry Butter Milk. Put six quarts of butter-milk into a cheese clot h, hang it in a cool place, and let the whey drip from it for two or three days ; when it is rather thick, put it into a basin, sweeten it with pounded loaf sugar, and add a glass of brandy, or of sweet wine, and as much raspberry jam, or sirup, as will colour and give it an agreeable flavour. Whisk it well together, and serve it in a glass dish. Haltered Kit. Make two quarts of new milk scalding hot, and pom it quickly upon four quarts of fresh-made butter milk, after which it must not be stirred ; let it remain till cold and firm, then take oftâ€™ the top part, drain it in a hair- sieve, and pifljffi into a shape for half an hour. It is eaten with cream, staved in a separate dish. Another way to make Haltered Kit.

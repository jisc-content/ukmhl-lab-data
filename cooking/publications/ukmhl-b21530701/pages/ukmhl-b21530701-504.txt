460 THE PRACTICE OP COOKERY. The best season for curing butter is from the begin- ning of August until the end of September; but if the pasture be rank, whether through soil, manure, or herb- age, it is generally injudicious to put down butter from it. Care must be taken that the firkin be well seasoned before butter be put into it. The readiest method is by the use of unslaked lime, or a large quantity of salt-and- water well boiled, with which it should be scrubbed, and afterwards thrown into cold water, to remain three or four days, till wanted; and before receiving the butter, scrubbed and rubbed with salt. To Put down Butter. i After being worked up with salt, in the proportion of half an ounce to the pound and half of butter, and ha- ving lain in pound lumps twenty-four hours, the dairy- woman takes two or three of the lumps, joins them to- gether, and kneads them in the manner in which paste is kneaded. This brings out a considerable quantity of wa- tery brine, which being poured out of the bowl, the butter is beaten with a cloth as before. The jar having been pre- viously boiled, or otherwise thoroughly cleaned, and having stood to be perfectly cool and dry, the butter is thrown into it, and kneaded down, as firm and close as possible, with the knuckles and the cloth alternately ; being careful not to have any hollow cell or vacuity for the air to lodge in more particularly round the outsides, between the butter and tbe jar; for this purpose, she repeatedly draws her finger round the sides of the jar, pressing the butter hard, and thereby uniting intimately the jar and the butter. It is fortunate when the jar can be filled at one churning; but when this cannot be done conveniently, the top is left level, and when the next churning of butter is to be add- ed, the surface is raised into inequalities, and the two churnings mixed into one mass. The jar being filled with butter to within two or three inches of the top, it is filled up with brine, made by boiling salt and water, in the proportion of a handful to a pint, ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, straining it into a cooling vessel, and,

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 485 two. In autumn the principal crop will be known to be ripe, when the tops of the plants change to a yellow colour; they should then be taken up, and stored in as clean and dry a state as possible. The best way of keep- ing them is in heaps on the ground, covering well with straw and earth, So as completely to exclude the frost. Peas. If peas be sown in newly-enriched ground, they will be apt to run to haums ; they are therefore seldom sown till the second year after manuring. Some of the early kinds, as the Charleton, golden, and Reading, are gene- rally sown towards the end of October, in front of a south wall; and if slightly protected by means of branches of evergreens, or old peas-haum, the crop will survive the winter, and produce young peas by the end of May. In January and February, more of the early sorts are sown for a succession ; and in March and April, full crops of the later peas must be sown. Some of the smaller late kinds, as the blue Prussian, dwarf marrowfat, Spanish dwarf, and Leadmanâ€™s dwarf, if well earthed up, and the rows not too near each other, may do without sticking. Of the large and late kinds, the tall marrowfat, green marrowfat, grey rounceval, and the sugar pea, have long retained their character. The larger kinds require nearly four feet distance between the rows. The young plants are frequently hoed ; when they are three or four inches high, the earth is drawn to the rows ; and when about eight or ten inches high, they must be sticked ; the smallest kinds may have sticks three feet, the early sorts and dwarf marrowfats five feet, and the larger sorts seven or eight feet high. When branches for sticking cannot be procured, two lines of strong pack thread, on each side of the rows, may be substituted. To prevent the attacks of mice, it is necessary to be careful in sowing peas, that none be left exposed on the surface of the ground.

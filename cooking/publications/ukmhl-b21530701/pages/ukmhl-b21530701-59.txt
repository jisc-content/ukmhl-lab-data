THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 15 Ox Cheek Soup. Separate the bones from the meat, ami break the former, cut the meat into pieces the length of a finger and the breadth of two, put a quart of water to every pound of meat, with a little salt, set it on a gentle fire, and skim it well during the first boiling ; after it has stewed gently two hours, add carrots, turnips, onions, celery, a head or two of cabbage, and a bunch of sweet herbs, pepper, salt, and a quarter of a pound of vermicelli; let it stew two hours and a half longer, skim it, and take out the herbs and bones. Chestnuts are a good substitute for vermicelli. Another Ox Cheek Soup. Wash the cheek clean, and cut it in small pieces, stew it till tender, in four or five quarts of water, with turnips, thyme, parsley, black-pepper-corns, and a few peas ; strain off the gravy and let it stand till the next day, then take off the fat, and cut the meat from the bones in small pieces, and stew it a little longer in the gravy with six or seven onions sliced and fried a light brown, some carrots, and celery cut small, a little salt, and cayenne. Sheep’s Head Broth. After having the sheep’s head and trotters singed, which is done with a red-hot iron, (the head and trotters are usually sent for this purpose to a blacksmith’s forge,) split the head, and take out the brain, which is not used, cut out the white of the eye, and rub the head and feet well over with it; let them lie for two hours, then wash them very well in lukewarm water, and rinse them tho- roughly. Cut out the tough membrane from between the toes, and lay them in cold water for two hours. Put on two gallons of water, and three quarters of a pound of Scotch barley; when it boils put in the head, trotters, and neck of the sheep, of carrots, and turnips, a quart; when cut down in dice, add a little salt, cover the pot closely, and let it boil four hours; take off the scum as it rises; put in some chopped onions about an hour before serving.

At whatever time it is racked, it should be fined in the usual way with isinglass. Sometimes it is found expedient to rack it a second time, and to repeat the fining; and in any case, bottle it during the month of March. If it is wished to have a very sweet wine, as well as a brisk wine, the quantity of sugar may be increased to forty pounds, and to insure briskness, without excessive sweet- ness, the proportion of fruit may be fifty pounds when the sugar is thirty. If there should appear any danger of the sweetness vanishing altogether from wine thus formed, the fermentation may be checked by racking and fining, same when it will be speedily fit for use. Wine from Unripe Currants. This fruit is perhaps better calculated for brisk wines than the gooseberry ; greater care must be taken in se- parating the stalks, but otherwise the mash is more easily managed. By working the juice and solid matter toge- ther in the vat along with the sugar, the wine will prove stronger, and less sweet, but it will acquire more flavour. When the skins are not to be fermented with the liquid, it may be introduced at once into the cask, without being previously fermented in the vat, and in all cases strained before it is put into the cask. The same proportions are allowed for this wine as for gooseberry wine, and the same rules may be followed. Sweet Wine from Ripe Currants. Tiie fruit is gathered when quite ripe, nnd the stalks being carefully picked out, it is bruised in the hands, and then strained through a canvass bag ; to a ten-gallon cask, forty pounds of fruit, thirty of sugar, and a quarter of a pound of tartar are allowed ; the material having remain- ed some hours in the tub in which it was mixed, it is re*

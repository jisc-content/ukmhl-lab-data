THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 386 put two of water; mix them well together; let it work for three weeks, stirring the mass two or three times each day; then strain the liquor through a hair sieve, and put to every gallon one pound of brown sugar, one pound of treacle, and a table-spoonful of fresh yeast; let it work for three or four days in the same tub, which has been well washed; then run it into iron-hooped casks. Let it stand twelve months, and bottle it for use. This is a very strong vinegar. Another way to make Gooseberry Vinegar. Bruise to a mash any kind of gooseberries, when quite ripe, and mix thoroughly with a gallon of the mash three of cold boiled water; let it stand twenty-four hours, strain it through a cloth, and to each gallon of the liquor, put one pound of brown sugar; mix it well, and when quite dissolved, put it into a cask. It must stand nine or ten months before being bottled. American Vinegar. Boil six gallons of water, and add, while it is hot, four quarts of molasses ; put it into a tub to cool; when milk* warm, stir in a pint of fresh yeast; put it into the cask, and set it by the fire for twenty-four hours ; then put it in the sun, with a bottle in the bung-hole. Bottle it three months afterwards. Cucumber Vinegar. Pare ten large cucumbers, cut them into thin slices ; pour over them a quart of vinegar; add a clove of garlic, and one or two shalots, a tea-spoonful of ground white pepper, and one of salt; let it stand for ten or twelve days; strain and bottle it; put a little whole pepper into the mouth of each bottle, and cork it tightly. The flavour of the cucumber may be very well preserved, by simply steeping them in vinegar. Garlic Vinegar. Cut small one ounce and a half of garlic, bruise one

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 297 tie water some pounded loaf sugar, till it turn brown, but do not stir it till taken off the lire; by degrees pour it in figures over the top of the cream. It may be eaten hot or cold. White Lemon Cream. Rub, with some lumps of loaf sugar, the rinds of six lemons, and grate off the remainder; squeeze and strain the juice, and add the grated peel and sugar, with three quarters of a pound of pounded loaf sugar; put to this a quart of rich cream, and whisk it till very thick. The following day, soak five or six spunge biscuits in white wine, and put over them the cream. Another way to make White Lemon Cream. Boil the thin peel of two lemons in a pint of cream; strain, and thicken it with the well-beaten yolks of three, and whites of four eggs; sweeten it with pounded loaf sugar, stir it till nearly cold, and put it into glasses. Stone Cream. Put three table-spoonfuls of lemon juice, and the gra- ted peel of one, some preserved apricots, or any other sweetmeat, into a glass or china dish. Boil a quarter of an ounce of isinglass in a little water, till dissolved ; add it to a pint of cream, sweetened well with pounded loaf sugar; boil it, and stir it all the time ; pour it into a jug, stir it now and then till milk-warm, then pour it over the sweetmeat round and round. It may be made the day before being served. Apple Cream. Boil twelve large apples in water till soft, take off the peel, and press the pulp through a hair sieve upon half a pound of pounded loaf sugar; whip the whites of two eggs, add them to the apples, and beat all together till it becomes very stiff', and looks quite white. Serve it heap- ed up on a dish.

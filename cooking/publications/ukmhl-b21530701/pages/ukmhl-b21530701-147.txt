103 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Jamaica pepper, and rub them over the mutton, pour a bottle of port wine over it, and let it remain in this five days, basting it frequently every day with the liquor, take it out and hang it up four or five days more, or as long as the weather favours its keeping; wipe it three or four times a-day, with a clean cloth. While it is roasting baste it with the liquor it was steeped in, adding a little more port wine ; a quarter of an hour before taking it from the tire, haste it well with butter, and dredge flour over it to froth it up. Serve it with sauces as for venison. Baked Mutton Chops. Cut a neck of mutton into neat chops, season them with salt and pepper, butter a dish, lay in the chops and poui- over them a batter made of a quart of milk, four eggs beaten up, four table-spoonfuls of flour, and a little salt. An bom- will bake them. To Dress Mutton Chops. Pare and trim the chops,dip them into hot melted but- ter, and cover them with grated bread mixed with chop- ped parsley, a little sweet marjoram, salt, and pepper, then dip the chops into the yolks of eggs beaten up, and cover them with the crumbs as before; fry them in butter and serve them with onions browned in butter and seasoned with salt and pepper, or with a thickened brown gravy. Another way to Dress Mutton Chops. Cut the chops off a loin or the best end of a neck of mutton, pare off the fat, dip them into a beaten egg, and strew over them grated bread, seasoned with pepper, salt, and some finely minced parsley; fry them in a little but- ter, and lay them upon the back of a sieve to drain be- fore the fire. Thicken about half a pint of gravy, add a table-spooriful of catsup, and one of port wine; put the gravy into the dish, and lay in the chops ; garnish with fried parsley or cut lemon.

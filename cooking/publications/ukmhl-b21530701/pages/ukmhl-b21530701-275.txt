If the loin, divide the kidney in two, season it with pepper and salt, lay the steaks into a dish, and add a little stock made with the trimmings, three table-spoon- fuls of port wine, and one of mushroom catsup ; cover the tlish with puff' paste. Pork Pies. With a raised crust make round shapes about the size of a small plate, and nearly three inches high; pare off the rind and part of the fat, and cut into neat short steaks a loin or neck of pork, beat them with a rolling-pin, sea- son them highly with pepper and salt, pack them closely into the shapes, wet the edges, put on the top, and pinch it all round; make a small hole in the middle of the crust, and if to be eaten hot, pour in, before serving, some white gravy, with a little white wine, and a tea-spoonful of vinegar in it.

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. S27 a china basin one pound of double-refined sugar finely- pounded and sifted, add the lemon juice, and stir it with a silver spoon till the sugar be perfectly dissolved. Bottle it, and cork it tightly; seal the cork, or tie bladder over it, and keep it in a dry cool place. To Purify Lemon Juice. To one quart of strained lemon juice add one ounce of well-burned and finely-pounded charcoal; in twelve hours filter it through filtering paper, and put it into small phials, which cork tightly, and keep in a cool place; a thick crust will form beneath the cork, and the mucilage will fall to the bottom. Hang up the peels, and when dried keep them in a paper bag. Colouring for Jellies, Creams, Ices, and Cakes. Boil very slowly in a gill of water, till reduced to one half, twenty grains of cochineal, the same quantity of alum and of cream of tartar finely pounded ; strain, and keep it in a small phial. For yellow, use an infusion of saffron. For green, wash well, and pull into small bits, a hand- ful of spinach leaves; put them into a closely-covered sauce-pan ; let them boil for a few minutes, and then ex- press the juice.

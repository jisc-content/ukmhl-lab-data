373 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. To Preserve Cucumbers. Lay, in a strong brine of salt and water, some large, smooth, green cucumbers; put vine or cabbage leaves over them, cover the jar or pan, and keep them near the fire till they turn yellow, which may be in three or four days; take them out, wash them, and put them into a pan with leaves under and over, and a little salt in the water; let them simmer, but not boil; when cold, if not sufficiently greened, again put them into fresh water, with fresh leaves. Take them out when cold, divide them into four, scoop out the seeds and soft part, lay them in- to cold water, which change frequently through the day, till it be quite clear and tasteless. Clarify the same weight of sugar as of cucumbers ; soak, in boiling water, some white ginger, scrape it, and put one ounce to a pound of sugar, and the thinly-pared rind of a lemon. Boil them with the sirup, and when cold, put in the cu- cumbers, and boil them slowly for half an hour; put them into jars, and in five days, boil them again for ten minutes; carefully take out the cucumbers, boil up the sirup, and when cold, put it over them. Another way to Preserve Cucumbers. Weigh equal quantities of sugar and the large smooth green cucumbers. Split them down the middle, and take out all the seeds ; cover four large cucumbers, cut in this way, with cold water, mixed with a dessert-spoon- ful of salt; let them stand by the fire-side, or in a warm place, for three or four days. Boil the sugar with as much water as will dissolve it, and as long as any scum rises ; then put in the cucumbers, and simmer them for a little time. Repeat this till they are clear and green, and, the last time of boiling, add some white ginger soaked in hot water and scraped, a few grains of all- spice, and the peel of a lemon cut very thin. Put tlie cucumbers into jars, cover them completely with the sirup, and the following day tie them over with bladder.

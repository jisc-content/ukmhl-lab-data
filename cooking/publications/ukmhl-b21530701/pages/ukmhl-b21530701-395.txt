THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 351 Biscuit. Make a9 stiff a paste as possible of the finest flour, mixing it with cold water, and adding a little salt; beat it out with a rolling-pin, cut it into pieces, lay them one over the other, and again beat it out; roll it very thin, cut it into biscuits, and prick them well with a fork. To make the Prince of Wales’ biscuit, roll the paste into small balls, and press it with a stamp. Another way to make Biscuit. Rub seven ounces of fresh butter into two pounds of flour, mix with it two large spoonfuls of yeast, cover it with a cloth, and let it stand an hour; then add as much warmed new milk as will make it into a paste as stiff as pie-crust; form it into biscuits of about an ounce and a half each ; bake them in a quick oven. The following day, after bread has been baked, put them again into the oven, and let them remain for nearly three hom-s. Sweet Biscuit. One pound of flour, half a pound of butter, the same quantity of finely-pounded sugar, and two eggs, without being beaten; make it all into a very stiff paste with cold water, roll it out, and to form the biscuits, roll a bit of the paste into a ball about the size of the yolk of an egg, flatten it a little, and place them upon tins to bake. Another way to make Sweet Biscuit. To one pound of flour allow half a pound of sugar, two beaten eggs, a tea-spoonful of caraway seeds, and a quar- ter of a pound of melted butter; mix all well together, roll it out thin, and cut it into round biscuits ; prick them, and bake them upon tins. Oliver’s Biscuit. Melt a quarter of a pound of fresh butter in half a pint of new milk; add a table-spoonful of fresh yeast, and stir it into one pound and a half of flour; knead it well,

227 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. inside of the pheasants, and fry them for a few minutes. Put them into a standing crust, or a deep dish, lined with slices of fat bacon and some forcemeat laid at the bot- tom ; add a glass of brandy, some truffles, and more of the forcemeat; then lay slices of fat bacon over the whole. If in a dish, cover it with a coarse paste, and bake it for four or five hours. When the pie is to be used, take off the coarse paste, and put over the dish a rich puff paste, and when this is sufficiently baked, it may be served. Chickens, partridges, or grouse, may be substituted for pheasants, and mushrooms for truffles. Partridge Pie. Truss half a dozen partridges in the same way in which chickens are done for boiling, and season them with pepper, salt, and mace. For a forcemeat, bake in an oven two pounds of lean veal, and half a pound of lean ham sliced, and seasoned with a shalot, parsley, and le- mon thyme minced, white pepper, nutmeg, and salt, and with half a pound of butter put over it. When the meat is perfectly tender, drain it, pound it in a mortalâ€™, and then mix with it the liquor. To a part of this forcemeat add grated bread and a little chopped fat bacon; put a bit of it, the size of a walnut, into each bird. Make a raised crust, and form it of an oblong shape; put into the bottom a layer of sliced bacon and one of veal, and some artichoke bottoms, cut small; lay in the partridges, over them a layer of forcemeat an inch thick, and then slices of fat bacon ; brush the edges of the top and sides with the beaten-up white of an egg, put on the top, and pinch it close. It will take three hours and a half to bake; and before serving, the outside should be brushed over with the white of an egg, and covered neatly with foolscap paper, cut into a fringe, round the top. This pie may be baked in a dish, and the forcemeat made of cold ham and roast veal pounded. Goose Pie. Prepare a very strong raised crust, and make the

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 24 three turnips, one parsnip, two carrots, two heads of ce- lery, without the green part, a bunch of sweet herbs, half an ounce of white pepper, a little salt, and a quarter of a pound of bam ; when sufficiently tender, press all the ingredients through a tammy, and let the soup stand till cold: pound the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs, mix them with a pint of thick cream, and stir it into the soup and heat it, but be careful not to boil it; new milk and the yolks of six eggs will answer instead of cream. Toast a piece of bread the size of a small roll, and put it into the soup before serving it. Another Onion Soup. Boil in four quarts of water six pounds of a knuckle of veal, with a dessert-spoonful of whole white pepper, and a few blades of mace ; when the meat is so much boiled as to leave the bone, strain off the stock. The follow- ing day boil nine or ten large Spanish onions in milk and water, till sufficiently tender to pulp through a sieve ; take the fat off from the top of the stock, boil it up, and add the onions with about a quarter of a pound of fresh butter worked with two heaped table-spoonsful of sifted flour of rice, and a little salt; boil it gently for half an hour, stirring it constantly, and, a little before serving, stir in half a pint of rich cream. Carrot Soup. Make a rich stock with a shin of beef, a quarter of a pound of lean ham, a fowl, or a piece of veal, a bunch of sweet herbs, two onions, a carrot, black and Jamaica pepper, salt, and three cloves ; strain it, and when cold take off all the fat; clean and boil, till they become very tender, the red part of twelve or thirteen carrots, accord- ing to their size, and two turnips; pound them in a mortar ; pound half a pound of cold roast beef, or beef steak ; warm it, and rub it with the carrots through a tammy or sieve ; add this to the soup, and serve it boil- ing hot.

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 17 Another way to Stew Beef. Pound and mix together two ounces of Jamaica pep- per, half an ounce of black pepper, and a little ginger, and half a pound of bay salt; rub it well into a round or rump of beef weighing fourteen or sixteen pounds ; let it lie five or six days, turning it daily. Put a fiat plate at the bottom of a sauce-pan, put in the beef, cover it with water, and let it stew for five hours, keeping the pan perfectly close. If the water wastes, add more boiling- hot. Before serving, take out about a quart of the gravy, skim, and add to it some grated nutmeg and pepper, and some cut pickles; heat and pour it over the beef. Gar- nish with cut pickles. Hunting Beef. Rub well into a round of beef weighing about forty pounds, three ounces of saltpetre ; let it stand five or six hours; pound three ounces of allspice, one of black pep- per, and mix them with two pounds of salt and seven ounces of brown sugar. Rub the beef all over with the salt and spices, let it remain fourteen days, and every other day turn and rub it with the pickle; then wash off the spices, and put it into a deep pan. Cut small nearly six pounds of beef-suet, put some into the bottom of the pan, but the greater part upon the top of the beef. Co- ver it with a coarse paste, and bake it eight hours. When cold, take off the crust, and pour off the gravy. It will keep good for three months. Preserve the gravy, as a little of it improves the flavour of hashes, soups, or any made dishes. Beef a la Braise. Bone a rump of beef; lard it very thickly with bacon seasoned with pepper, salt, cloves, mace, and allspice, and season the beef with pepper and salt; put some slices of bacon into the bottom of the pan, with some whole black pepper, a little allspice, one or two bay leaves, two onions, a clove of garlick, and a bunch of

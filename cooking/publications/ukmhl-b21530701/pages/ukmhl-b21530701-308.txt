THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 264. Vermecelli Pudding. Wash three ounces of vermecelli; boil it for fifteen minutes in a pint of milk, with a bit of cinnamon and le- mon peel. When nearly cold, pick out the cinnamon and peel, sweeten it, and add the well-beaten yolks of six, and the whites of two eggs. Mix it well, and bake it in a buttered dish for half an hour. It may be boiled for one hour and a half, and served with a sweet sauce. Chous. Stir into a pint of boiling water half a pound of but- ter, and add by degrees the same quantity of flour; stir it constantly till quite smooth, and then add eight eggs well beaten with half a tea-spoonful of salt, and a wine-glass of orange-flower water; take it off the fire, and beat it for a few minutes, then with a spoon form it into small balls; place them in rows upon a floured tin, and bake them in a moderate oven for a quarter of an hour. Serve them with grated loaf sugar sifted over them. Arrow-Root Pudding. From a quart of new milk take a small tea-cupful, and mix it with two large spoonfuls of arrow-roof. Boil the remainder of the milk, and stir it amongst the arrow-root; add, when nearly cold, four well-beaten yolks of eggs, with two ounces of pounded loaf sugar, and the same of fresh butter broken into small bits ; season with grated nutmeg. Mix it well together, and bake it in a buttered dish fifteen or twenty minutes. Scotch Pudding. Eight well-beaten yolks and three whites of eggs, half a pound of pounded loaf sugar, a quarter of a pound of melted butter, the grated peel and juice of one lemon ; mix all together, and bake it in a dish lined with puff paste; turn it out to serve, and strew over the top grated loaf sugar.

475 THE rilACTICE OF COOKERY. The best seasons for brewing are October and March. Ale and porter should be perfectly transparent before they are bottled. Let the bottles be dry, and leave them, when filled, open for six or eight hours ; then cork them perfectly air-tight with good sound corks. The bottles should be straight-necked, smooth, and even in the mouth, narrowing a very little about the neck where the middle of the cork comes ; one inch and a half of empty space should be left between the liquor and the lower surface of the cork in the bottle.

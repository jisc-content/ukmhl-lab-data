The red kind is preferred for kitchen use; and the lighter and poorer the soil is, the better will the sage plants stand the winter. It is propagated in the spring by slips, and in the summer by cuttings. The cuttings should be five or six inches long, stripped of all the lower leaves, and plunged nearly to the top in the earth, being at the same time well watered. The plants should be removed every three or four years. Clary. Clary is propagated by seeds sown in spring, trans- planting the seedlings, in the summer months, to fifteen inches apart. Mints. Spearmint is the kind required for culinary purposes, peppermint being little used except for distilling. These mints like a moist soil, and are readily propagated by slips in spring, by parting the roots in autumn, and by means of cuttings in summer. In the latter end of sum- mer, when the spearmint is coming into flower, it may be gathered, dried gradually in the shade, and kept for winter use.

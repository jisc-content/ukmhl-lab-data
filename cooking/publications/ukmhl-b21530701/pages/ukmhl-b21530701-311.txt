THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 267 loaf sugar, half a nutmeg grated, a little candied orange or lemon peel, four well-beaten eggs, one ounce and a half of melted butter just warm ; mix all the ingredients well together, and boil it in a buttered shape for four hours. If the pudding does not fill the shape, add a slice of the crumb of bread at the bottom. Serve with a sweet sauce. Plum Pudding without Eggs. Half a pound of grated bread, a quarter of a pound of finely-minced suet, a table-spoonful of flour, half a pound of currants cleaned, rather more than two ounces of brown sugar, a glass of brandy ; mix all together with a sufficient quantity of milk to make it into a stiff' bat- ter ; boil it in a cloth for four hours. It may be baked, adding half a pound of stoned raisins, and a little candied orange and lemon peel. Treacle Pudding. Half a pound of flour, the same of finely-minced suet, of raisins stoned, and cut small, and well-cleaned currants, a quarter of a pound each, three table-spoonfuls of treacle, and half a pint of water; mix it all well to- gether ; boil it in a cloth for four hours, and serve it with a sweet sauce. Jeneton Pudding. Butter a mould, and ornament it with raisins in fes- toons, or in any other form ; line it with sponge biscuit, and fill it up with a mixture of ratafia and sponge biscuit, then pour a rich custard over the whole, and let it stand for two hours, adding more custard as it soaks into the biscuit. The mould being quite full, tie a cloth over it, and boil it for about an hour. Batter Pudding. Beat seven eggs for fifteen or twenty minutes ; mix with six large table-spoonfuls of flour a quart of new milk, and add the eggs, with a little salt; stir it well together,

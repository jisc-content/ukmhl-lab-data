401 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. To have a wine resembling champagne, a partially close mode of fermentation is adopted. For rich and strong sweet wines, the whole fermentation may be carried on openly; but, in all cases, it seems a useful practice to cover the vat with boards and blankets. The fermenta- tion is much sooner completed in a large than in a small vessel. The sweeter and thicker juices require to be treated on a larger scale than the thinner ones. It is easy to make lemon wine in a cask of two gallons; but it is a very difficult task to operate on so small a quantity of thick and sweet raisin wine. The most favourable tempe- rature for fermentation is about 54 degrees of Fahrenheit. When it languishes from cold, a portion of the fluid may be heated to a high degree of temperature, and mixed with the mass. The sweetest wines are most durable, and are improved by keeping; the thinnest and briskest ought to be drank comparatively new. Boiling the fruit tends to make the wine sweet; and white sugar should always be used in preference to brown. The introduc- tion of brandy neither prevents wine from turning sour, nor does it add to its durability, while it increases the expense, and diminishes its salubrity ; but, for those who cannot overcome their prejudice in favour of established practices, it may be observed, that brandy will be least injurious when added before the fermentation is com- pleted, in the proportion of a quart to every ten gallons. The necessity of making the vats and casks clean, re- quires to be particularly inculcated on the makers of do- mestic wines. The taste communicated by new casks is not usually thought unpleasant; where it is so, first rinsingwith hot salt-and-water, and afterwards with move hot water, will remove it. Old and musty casks should be unheaded and scraped, then cleaned as before direct- 2 c

To broil them, they are previously prepared in the same way. If boiled, the gut is drawn out, but they must not be washed. To Boil Mackerel. Clean them well, and let them lie in vinegar and wa- ter for a short time, put them on in boiling salt-and-wa- ter for a quarter of an hour. Serve garnished with fennel.

To souse them ; put in the proportion of half a pint of vinegar to a quart of the liquor the fish has been boiled in, half an ounce of whole black pepper, a little mace, two or three bay leaves ; and when cold, cover the mack- erel completely with it; pick out the bay leaves. To Broil Mackerel. Clean and split them open, wipe them dry, rub them over with butter, and sprinkle them with pepper and salt. To Bake Mackerel. Clean them ; cut off the heads and tails ; put them into a deep dish, and pour over equal quantities of water and vinegar, some whole black pepper, a little mace, salt, and one or two bay leaves, and a small quantity of port wine ; tie over the dish a sheet of thick white paper but- tered.

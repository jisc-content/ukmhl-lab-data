125 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Calf’s Head Bigarde. Clean and blanch a calf’s head, boil it till the hones will come out easily, then hone and press it between two dishes, so as to give it an oblong form; beat with the yolks of four eggs a little melted butter, pepper, and salt. Divide the head when cold, and brush it all over with the beaten eggs, and strew over it grated bread ; repeat this twice. With the grated bread, which is put over one half, a good quantity of finely-minced parsley should be mixed ; place the head upon a dish, and bake it of a nice brown colour. Serve it with a sauce of parsley and butter, and with one of good gravy, mixed with the brains which have been previously boiled, and chopped and seasoned with a little cayenne and salt. To Plain Boil a Calf’s Head. Split the head and take out carefully the brains and tongue, wash the head well, and let it lie twro or three hours in cold wrater. Boil it with the tongue and brains gently in plenty of water, till it be quite tender; take out the bones, and pour over the head parsley and butter made very thick; rub the brains through a sieve; add to them a little chopped parsley, some pepper, salt, flour, and butter; mix all wrell together, and put it round the tongue, which may be served as a comer dish, or it may be salted. When salted, the brains, with the addition of a little butter and chopped parsley, may be put over the head, or served in a sauce tureen. Calf’s Brains, with Fried Parsley. Blanch three or four brains, of nearly an equal size; parboil them, and take off the skin; then boil them in water, with a little salt, vinegar, and butter. Serve them with a sauce made of a little broumed butter, a table- spoonful of vinegar, some salt and pepper, and some pars- ley fried very green.

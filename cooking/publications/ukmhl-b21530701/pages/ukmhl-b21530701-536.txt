THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 492 Garlic. Garlic has a bulbous root, made up of a dozen or fifteen smaller bulbs, called cloves ; it is propagated by detaching the cloves, and planting them. The soil should be light and dry, well delved, and broken fine. The sets are placed four inches distant from each other in every direction, and between two and three inches deep. The smaller the cloves, the more healthy and productive will be the plants. They are put in in February or March ; about the middle of June the leaves are tied in knots, to prevent the stronger plants from running to flower. The crop is taken up in August, when the leaves begin to wither. The roots are tied in bunches, and hung in a dry room for use. Slialot. The culture of the slialot is very similar to that of garlic. They are planted about the middle of October, the ground having been previously manured with old well-rotted dung, mixed with house ashes. The crop is taken up in the end of summer, when the leaves become discoloured, and the bulbs are hung up in nets, in a cool airy place, for use. Artichoke. Artichokes may be planted in any open situation. They are propagated by means of rooted slips, or suckers, taken off at the time of the spring dressing, in the begin- ning of April. They like a light loam, cool, but dry, and which is at the same time rich and deep. In preparing for this crop, the soil should be trenched to the depth of three feet, and manure should be liberally supplied at the bottom of the trench. The plants may be placed four feet apart every way; and at the end of the first season after planting, a small and late crop of artichokes may generally be cut in October. In the second year they will be plentiful; and in autumn, as soon as all the heads are gathered, the whole 6talks are broken down

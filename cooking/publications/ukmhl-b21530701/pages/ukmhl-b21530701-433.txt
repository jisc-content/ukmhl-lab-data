French beans done in this way are beautiful, and answer well pickled with the gherkins, and kept together. Nasturtium buds or imitation capers may be done after this receipt. There is no method adopted which produces so fine a green in pickles, as the use of a brass pan ; but where it is objected to, they may be done by the following re- ceipts. Gherkins. Make a pickle of salt-and-water strong enough to bear an egg, carefully skimming it while boiling; when cold, put in gherkins or French beans, or whatever is to be pickled, and let them stand at the side of the fire for three days; pour off the brine, wipe them dry, and put them into a stone jar. In another stone jar, boil, upon a hot plate, or in a water bath, as much strong vinegar as will cover the pickles; pour it over them, and cover them with fresh-gathered vine or cabbage leaves; place a cloth or plate over the jar, and let it stand by the side of the fire. Next day pour off the vinegar, boil it as before, and pour it over the pickle, and cover them with fresh leaves; and if they are not a good green colour, repeat the same process a third time. Then put them into wide-mouthed glass bottles, or into strong stone-ware jars ; boil vinegar, together with spices, in the following proportions: bruised nutmeg half an ounce, black peppercorns, whole allspice, and ginger, one ounce each to a quart: pour it hot over

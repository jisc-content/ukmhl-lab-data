THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 502 Samphire. Samphire is not easily cultivated; it seems to suc- ceed best in a rich light soil, having sand and gravel mix- ed with it. It must be in a well-sheltered situation, and requires to be freely watered in dry weather, till the roots have struck deep among the soil. If a few plants can be induced to take root in an old wall, or on an ar- tificial rock-work, they will have a good chance of re- maining.

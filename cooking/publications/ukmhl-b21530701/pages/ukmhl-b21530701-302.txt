258 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Irish Puffs. Add to five well-beaten yolks and two whites of eggs, a large table-spoonful of flour, not quite an ounce of melt- ed butter, and half a tea-spoonful of salt; beat it all well for ten minutes, and add half a pint of cream ; bake it in buttered tea-cups; turn them out, and serve them with a sweet sauce. Citron Pudding. Mix together one pint of cream, one large spoonful of flour, four ounces of pounded loaf sugar, half a grated nutmeg, the beaten yolks of four eggs, and three ounces of citron cut very small; bake it in a dish lined with puff paste. Rich Ground-Rice Pudding. Stik into a quarter of a pound of ground rice, a pint and a half of new milk ; put it into a sauce-pan, and keep stirring it till it boils; then add three ounces of melted butter, the same quantity of sugar, half a grated nutmeg, and a tea-spoonful of grated lemon peel; mix it very well, and when cold, add the well-beaten yolks of four, and the white of one egg, with a glass of ratafia, and half a one of orange-flower or rose water; bake it, in a dish lined with puff paste, for three quarters of an hour. Before serving, strew over the top grated loaf sugar. Another way to make Ground-Rice Pudding. Mix till quite smooth, with a small tea-cupful of ground rice, a quart of good milk, stir it over the fire till it boils, and let it boil for three minutes ; put it into a basin, and when nearly cold, add the well-beaten yolks of six, and the whites of two eggs, with a tea-cupful of sweet wine, or a glass of spirits ; put it into a buttered dish, and bake it for three quarters of an hour, or for one hour in a Dutch oven, in the same way as the marrow pudding is done. (See p. 259.) Any sort of preserve may be put into the bottom of the dish, and a sweet sauce may be served with it.

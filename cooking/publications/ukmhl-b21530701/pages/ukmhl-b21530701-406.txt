THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 362 ted peel, and let it Toil for five minutes more; take it off; and stir it till half cold, before putting it into jars. Red Currant Jelly. Gather the currants upon a dry day, pick them clean, pound them in a mortar, and drip them through a tammy or flannel bag ; to every pint of juice allow a pound of fine loaf sugar; it may be broken small and boiled with the juice ; but to make the jelly beautifully clear, clarify and â€¢ boil the sugar candy high, add the juice, and boil it six minutes.

Put them into a prq^erving pan, adding one pint of raspberries to four of entrants ; allow them to become quite hot, but not to boil; shake the pan, to prevent the fruit adhering to the bottom or sides ; strain it through a jelly bag. To every pint of juice allow one pound of pounded loaf sugar, and when it comes to a boil, boil it one minute. Only remove the scum when the pan is taken off the fire. Wash and prepare black currants as the red are direct- ed to be done ; put them into a preserving pan, adding a pint of water to a quart of fruit; let it be so hot as merely to admit of its being squeezed through a thin linen cloth with the hand. To a pint of juice allow a

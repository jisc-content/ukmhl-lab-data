THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 156 Chicken Baked in Rice. Cut a chicken into joints as for a fricassee, season it well with pepper and salt, lay it into a pudding dish lined with slices of ham or bacon, add a pint of veal gravy, and an onion finely minced; fill up the dish wfith boiled rice well pressed and piled as high as the dish will hold, cover it with a paste of flour and water; hake it one hour, and before serving take off the paste. To Fricassee a Chicken with White Sauce. Cut the chicken into joints, parboil it with the liver and gizzard, and take off the skin ; thicken a little of the liquor with a bit of butter mixed with flour, heat it, and put in the chicken with a little white pepper, grated lemon peel and nutmeg, a blade of mace, and some salt; boil it for about twenty minutes, take it off the fire, pick out the lemon peel and mace, and stir in gradually half a pint of cream with the yolk of two eggs well beaten, make it hot, but after adding the cream do not let it boil; the liver and gizzard may be dressed with it, or scored, seasoned with pepper, cayenne, and salt, broiled and served with the fricassee. A cold chicken or fowl may be dressed in this way, with a little white stock for sauce ; or they may be dress- ed with a little brown sauce, browning some butter and flour, adding with the liquor a minced onion, a little cat- sup, black pepper, nutmeg, salt, and a bit of lemon peel, which last take out before serving.

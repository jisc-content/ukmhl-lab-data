THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 381 Lemon Drops. Squeeze and strain the juice of six good-sized lemons ; mix with it pounded and sifted loaf sugar, till so thick that it is stirred with difficulty ; put it into a preserving-pan, and, with a wooden spoon, stir it constantly, and let it boil five or six minutes ; then drop it from the point of a knife, upon writing paper, in drops as large as a shilling. When cold, they will readily come off. Barley Sugar Drops. Clarify and boil the sugar to that degree, that upon dipping in a wooden stick and plunging it into cold wa- ter, the sugar becomes crisp, and will snap; boil with it the thinly-pared rind of one or two lemons ; drop the su- gar upon a stone or marble slab in round drops ; when quite cold, roll them in sifted loaf sugar, and lay them be- tween layers of white paper, or fold them in little bits of square paper, and twist it at the end. Barley Sugar. Boil the sugar as for the drops, and flavour it with le- mon juice, or oil of lemons ; rub a little fresh butter over a stone or marble slab, and pour the sugar along it in nar- row strips; twist it while warm, and when cold, with a knife mark it across, and it will break into any lengths.

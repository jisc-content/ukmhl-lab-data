Dissolve one ounce of isinglass in five or six tea- cupfuls of water; strain, and add to it, when boiling hot, one tea-cupful and a half of brandy, the same of rum, and one of lemon juice, with half a pound of pounded loaf sugar; stir till the sugar is dissolved, and pour it into a shape. Orange Jelly. Squeeze the juice of eight oranges and six lemons, grate the peel of half the fruit, and steep it in a pint ol cold water; mix it with the juice, three quarters of a pound of loaf sugar, one ounce and a quarter of isinglass, and the beaten whites of seven eggs; put it into a sauce- pan, and stir it till it boils ; let it boil a few minutes, and strain it through a jelly-bag till clear; put it into a mould or glasses. Another way to make Orange Jelly. Dissolve three quarters of an ounce of isinglass in half a pint of water; add it to a quart of cream, and the strained juice of three sweet or bitter oranges, and six ounces of loaf sugar, part of which has been previously rubbed upon the rind of the oranges; stir it in a sauce- pan over the fire till it boils, put it into a basin, stir it till nearly cold, and then pour it into a mould. Another way to make Orange Jelly. Dissolve two ounces of isinglass in boiling water, add it to the strained juice of twelve oranges and one le- mon ; sweeten with pounded loaf sugar; boil and strain it. The oranges may be cut into half, and the pulp ta- ken out, the skins placed in a dish to keep them steady, and filled with the jelly.

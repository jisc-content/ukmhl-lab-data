THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 270 flour, a quarter of a pound of currants, some sugar, a little grated lemon peel, nutmeg, and three well-beaten eggs; roll the mixture into round balls, tie them in bits of linen, and boil them for half an hour. Serve with melted butter and sugar poured over them. Shropshire Pudding. Of fresh beef suet finely minced, of brown bread grated, and of brown sugar, one pound each, one nut- meg grated, a tea-cupful of brandy, eight well-beaten yolks, and four whites of eggs; mix all well together, and boil it in a cloth or mould for four hours. Serve it with a sauce of melted butter, sugar, and two table- spoonfuls of brandy. Apple Pudding. Weigh one pound and three quarters of apples, pare, core, and cut them into thin bits ; weigh also ten ounces of brown sugar; make a suet paste, rolled thinner towards the edges than in the middle, and sufficiently large to lay into a two-quart basin, previously buttered; put in the apples and sugar alternately, wet the edges of the paste, and fold it closely over; dredge it with flour, and tie a pudding cloth over the top of the basin ; boil it for three hours. A light paste may be made with flour, half its quantity in bulk of grated bread and suet, mixing it with milk or water, and, instead of apples, currants, damsons, or nny other fruit, may be enclosed in it. West Country Pudding. Mix, with four well-beaten eggs, half a pound of ap- ples finely minced, the same quantity of grated bread, and of well-cleaned currants, a quarter of a pound of brown sugar, and half a tea-spoonful of grated nutmeg. This pudding may be either boiled or baked, and instead of grated bread, four ounces of whole rice may be used, which must be boiled in milk, strained, and allowed to be cold before being mixed with the other ingredients.

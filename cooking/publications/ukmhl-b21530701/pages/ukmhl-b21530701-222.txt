178 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 9 - To Clarify Gravy. Clarify gravy drawn from beef or veal, with the beat- en whites of eggs, allowing one white to a quart. Gra- vies and soups which are to be clarified should be made very strong, and be highly seasoned. To make Gravy without Meat. Slice three onions, and fry them brown in a little but- ter ; add them to half a pint of water, and the same of beer, put in some peppercorns, salt, a little lemon peel, three cloves, a little mace or Jamaica pepper, a spoonful of walnut pickle, and one of mushroom catsup, of soy and es- sence of anchovy a dessert-spoonful each, a small bunch of sweet herbs, and a quarter of a slice of bread toasted brown on both sides; simmer all together in a closely covered sauce-pan for twenty minutes, then strain it for use, and when cold take off the fat. It will taste exactly like a gravy made with meat. Another way to make Gravy without Meat. Knead a good deal of Hour into a piece of butter the size of an egg, fry it in a frying-pan over a clear fire, stir it constantly with a wooden spoon till it become a nice brown colour, taking particular care that it be made per- fectly smooth ; pour in some boiling water, add a little finely-minced onion, some whole black pepper and a lit- tle salt, put it into a small sauce-pan, cover it closely, and simmer it for a short time ; strain, and mix with it a little mushroom catsup, and port wine. To make Gravy for Roast Meat. When the spit is taken from the meat, a good deal of gravy will run into the dish ; pour in addition to this a little boiling water and salt over the under part of the bone of the beef, or over the shank-bone of a leg or shoulder of mutton, taking great care not to let it run over the meat.

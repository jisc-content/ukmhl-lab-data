469 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. twelve gallon tub are required, the larger tub being in- tended to serve in the threefold capacity of receiver, cooler, and gyle-tun. The tub intended to serve as un- derbade or receiver of the running wort from the mash- tub, ought to have its capacity divided into gallons; it may be done by notches cut in the surface, or small nails driven into the wood. A few pails should also be ready at hand. A gyle-tun ought properly to be narrow in proportion to its depth ; but a cask of any shape, simply deprived of its head, allowing fifteen gallons capacity for every nine gallons of liquor intended to be suffered to ferment in it, will do very well. A common thermo- meter, with a metal scale, enclosed in a tin case, should be provided, to ascertain the temperature of the water; but if there should not be one at hand, heat 220 mea- sures, gallons, or quarts of water, according to the quan- tity required, and, when it boils, add 100 similar mea- sures of cold water. Barrels of eighteen gallons capacity are most conve- nient and economical for storing beer. Cleanliness cannot be too much attended to in the brewing process. Some days before brewing, all the casks and tubs should be filled with water, to render them tight; and, after the brewing utensils are made use of, they should be thoroughly washed out; during the sum- mer, the vessels may be scoured with lime water; and the copper ought to be kept especially clean. The mo- ment a cask is empty, fasten down the vent peg, and stop the tap-hole with a cork well fitted and hammered into its place.

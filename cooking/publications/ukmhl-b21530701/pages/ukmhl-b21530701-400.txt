THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 356 yeast will then be found at the bottom of the vessel, quite thick. To preserve that which may be left over the baking, it should be put into a bottle, corked tightly, and kept in a cool place. In cold weather it will continue good for a fortnight, but fresh yeast is always preferable. When it does not appear sufficiently strong, honey or brown sugar may be mixed with it, in the proportion of a tea-spoonful to half a pint. Bran Yeast. Boil for ten minutes, in two quarts of water, one pint of bran, and a small handful of good hops; strain it through a sieve, and when milk warm, add three or four table- spoonfuls of beer yeast, and two of brown sugar or trea- cle ; put it into a wooden stoup or jug ; cover it, and place it before the fire to ferment. It may be bottled, tightly corked, and kept in a cool place. Potato Yeast. Boil some good mealy potatoes; peel and weigh them; while hot, bruise them finely, and mix them quickly with boiling water, allowing one quart to each pound ; rub it through a hair sieve, then add honey or brown sugar in the proportion of one ounce to each quart of water; boil it to the consistency of batter, and when nearly cold, add a large table-spoonful of good yeast to every quart of wa- ter ; cover it w ith a cloth to rise, and the following day it will be ready for use; keep a bottle of it, which may be used instead of beer yeast for the next making, first pouring off the thin liquid that is on the top. It must be made with fresh beer yeast every two or three months. Double the quantity of this, as of beer yeast, is required to make bread light. A Bakerâ€™s Yeast. Boil two ounces of hops in four quarts of water one hour, adding more water as it decreases, carefully stir- ring it all the time, and taking care that it do not boil over ; strain the liquor, and mix well with it two pounds

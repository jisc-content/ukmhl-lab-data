Batli Cream Cheese. Three gallons of new milk, one of hot water, and ono pint of cream, are mixed together, and a larger proportion of rennet added than for milk alone ; when the curd is come, it is broken a little, and the whey dripped from it; a gallon of cold water is then poured over it, and it is again broken and dripped ; the same process being re- peated a third time, the curd is put into two quarts of boiling water, and the most of the whey squeezed out; it is then drained, put into the vat, and pressed for three hours ; turned, and pressed for three hours more, which is sufficient. No salt nor colouring is necessary. A Day Cheese. One pint of cream being mixed with twelve pints of noon-day milk, warm from the cow, a little rennet is added, and when the curd is come, the whey is pressed out gently, so as to break the curd as little as possible; it is then laid in a cloth, and put into a small sieve; the cloth is changed every hour during the day, and in twenty- four hours it will be fit for use. It. may be served on a breakfast plate, with vine leaves under it, and will keep perfectly good only one day. New Cheese. To six quarts of new milk from the cow, a little hot water and rennet to turn it, is added ; when the curd is come, it is cut twice across with a cheese-knife or spoon ; then put into a cheese-cloth, and hung up ; in half an hour it is again divided with the cheese-knife, hung up, and al- lowed to remain till night, when it is put into the press ; the following day it is taken out, and each side well rub- bed with a little salt. It will be fit for use in two days.

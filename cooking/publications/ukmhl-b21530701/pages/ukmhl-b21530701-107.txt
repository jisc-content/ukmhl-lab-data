THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 63 shalots, a bunch of parsley, thyme, two bay leaves, a lit- tle mace, black and Jamaica pepper, a pint of good gravy, the same of port wine, and the same of vinegar, six an- chovies bruised ; let all boil together for ten minutes ; take out the eels ; boil the sauce till reduced to a quart; strain and thicken it with a table-spoonful of flour, mixed smooth in a little cold water. Put in the eels, and boil them till they are tender. Eels may also be roasted with a common stuffing. Another way to Stew Eels. After the eels are cleaned and skinned, cut them into pieces, season well two pounds and a half with salt and black pepper, put an ounce of butter into a stew-pan with a large handful of sorrel, three or four sage leaves, half an onion cut small, a little grated lemon peel, and one anchovy chopped ; put in the eels and pour over half a pint of water, stew them gently for half an hour, shaking them occasionally; before serving, add a little grated nutmeg, and the juice of half a lemon. To Stew Lampreys. Clean them well with salt and warm water, and re- move the cartilage which runs down the back, season them with black and Jamaica pepper, grated nutmeg, two or three cloves and some salt; stew them till tender in equal parts of port wine and water, with some horse-ra- dish and an onion ; strain and thicken the liquor with flour and butter, and add a table-spoonful of lemon pickin' and one of mushroom catsup ; heat it, and pour it hot over the lampreys. Eels may be stewed in this way, keeping on the skins, curling and first frying them of a good brown. Fish Soup Cake. Pick free from bones and skin any cold boiled white fish, weigh it, and add one third of grated bread crumbs, a little cold melted butter, a small onion minced very fine,

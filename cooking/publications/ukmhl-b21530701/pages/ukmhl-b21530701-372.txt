328 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. CHAPTER XV. CAKES, BISCUITS, AND BREAD. PREPARATORY REMARKS. The currants and raisins should be prepared as directed under the article headed, Remarks on Puddings, Pies, and Tarts (page 218); and the flour dried before the fire on a large sheet of white paper, then sifted and weighed. Al- monds should be blanched by pouring hot water over them, and, after standing some minutes, taking off the skin, then throwing them into rose or cold water. When not pounded, they should be cut lengthwise into thin bits. Sugar should be roughly pounded, rolled with a bottle upon white paper, and then sifted. All spices, after being well dried at the fire, should be finely pounded and sifted. Lemon and orange peel must be pared very thin, and pounded with a little sugar. The butter, after being weighed, should be laid into cold water, or washed in rose water, and if salt, be well washed in several waters. The yolks and whites of eggs should be separately and long beaten, then strained; two whisks should be kept exclusively for that purpose, as the whites especially re- quire to be managed with the greatest care.

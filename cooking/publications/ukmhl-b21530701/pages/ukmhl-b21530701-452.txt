THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 408 Wine from Unripe Grapes. The proportions and treatment are exactly the same as those laid down for the gooseberry, only that the husks may always be fermented in the vat with the fluid, and also the stems when young; with the exception of the seeds, there is no objection to bruising the solid matters. Wine from Vine Leaves. The leaves are best when young; at farthest they should not be full grown, and must be plucked with their stems ; the tendrils are equally useful; they may be taken from vines from which no fruit is expected, or from the sum- mer prunings; when tainted with soot, they must be carefully washed. Forty or fifty pounds of such leaves being put into a tub, seven or eight gallons of boiling wa- ter are to be poured on them, in which they are to infuse for twenty-four hours; the liquor being poured off, the leaves must be pressed in a press of considerable power, and being then washed with an additional gallon of wa- ter, they are again to be pressed. Thirty pounds of sugar, and a quarter of a pound of tartar, are now to be added to the mixed liquor, and the quantity being made up to se- ven gallons, the process recommended in the case of gooseberries is to be followed ; or that for ripe currants, if a sweet wine is desired. Kaisin Wine. To every gallon of water, eight pounds of good raisins, and half an ounce of tartar are allowed ; the raisins being picked, they are to be put, together with the tartar, into a tub, which should be covered ; the mash must be stir- red every day till the sweetness has gone off, and the fruit lias fallen a little, which may be in a month or six weeks ; it is then to be strained, the raisins pressed to dryness, and the liquid put into the cask no filling up is neces- sary, and the bung-hole is only to be so covered as to keep out the dust.

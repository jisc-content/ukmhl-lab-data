104 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Hashed Mutton. Cut the meat into small thin bits, pare off the skin and sinews, leaving a little fat; thicken some well-seasoned gravy, add the meat, and let it simmer till it be hot, hut do not allow it to boil. A little catsup, port wine, or vinegar may be put in just before serving. Garnish with sippets of bread or with cut pickles. China Chilo. Skin and chop the meat finely, and also part of the fat of a loin of mutton, and season it with a large spoonful of salt, and a tea-spoonful of ground pepper; add two large onions shred, half a pint of green pease, one lettuce cut small, four spoonfuls of water, and a quarter of a pound of clarified butter. Let all this stew in a pipkin for three hours and serve it in the middle of a pound of rice boil- ed dry. Sheep’s Liver. Cur it into slices ; wash it well, and dry it in a cloth ; flour and season it with pepper and salt, and fry it in but- ter, with a good deal of minced parsley and an onion ; add a sufficient quantity of gravy or hot water to make a sauce, and let it stew a few minutes. It may be fried quite plain, and when cut into slices, should be washed in milk and water. Sheep’s Mince. Wash the heart and lights very clean ; boil them about half an hour ; mince them finely; mix a piece of butter with flour, brown it in a stew-pan, and add some of the liquor the heart and lights were boiled in. Put in the mince with some chopped onion; season with salt and pepper, cover it closely, and let it stew half an hour. Be- fore serving, add a table-spoonful of mushroom catsup.

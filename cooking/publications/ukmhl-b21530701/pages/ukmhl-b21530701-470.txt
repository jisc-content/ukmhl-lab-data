THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 426 ly pure, and free from smell, may be used with the French lights in a sick room. To Discharge all Stains which are not Metallic. Mix two tea-spoonfuls of water with one of spirit of salt; let the stain lie in it for one or two minutes ; then rinse the article in cold water. This will be found par- ticularly useful in removing stains from white doilys. To Wash Paint. Brush off the dust with a small long-haired brush ; mix finely-powdered whitening and bullockâ€™s gall, till of the consistence of a batter ; with a flannel, rub it on the walls up and down, and then wash it off with a clean flannel and plenty of cold water, and when nearly dry, rub it hard with a clean linen cloth ; the unpleasant smell from the gall will go off almost immediately. If the paint is not very much soiled, it may be washed merely with the whitening mixed with cold water, first wetting below the hand. To Wash Imitation Wainscot. Wash first with cold water and a clean flannel, and then with sour porter ; after which it is not to be wiped. Or wash with whitening mixed with cold water; wash off with clean water ; dry it well, and then rub hard with linseed oil. To Clean Papered Rooms. Blow off the dust with a pair of bellows ; cut the up- per crust off a stale loaf of bread; hold the crust in the hand, and rub gently downwards, about half a yard at each stroke. The next time of going round, commence a little above where the last stroke ended, and take care not to cross the paper, or go up again. The process may be repeated ; and, if carefully done, the paper will look near- ly as well as new.

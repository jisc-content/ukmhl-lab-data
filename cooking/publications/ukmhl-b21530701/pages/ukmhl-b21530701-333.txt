289 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Another way to dress Macaroni. Simmer the macaroni with a little salt, gravy, anil water, half and half; when tender, 6train, and put it into a sauce-pan with a quarter of a pound of butter, a finely- minced onion, and a tea-cupful of cream; grate half a pound of cheese, and heat the half of it with the maca- roni ; dish it, and strew over the top the remainder of the cheese; brown it with a salamander. Another way to dress Macaroni. Put the macaroni into boiling milk and water, with a little salt, and about an ounce of fresh butter; let it simmer till tender, drain oft' the water, and mix with it a cupful of thick cream ; make it quite hot, and if approved, add some grated nutmeg. Another way, Plain Dressed. Throw a little salt into a sauce-pan of boiling water, put in half a pound of macaroni, let it simmer three quar- ters of an hour, stir it occasionally, strain off* the water ; have ready a breakfast-plateful of grated Dutch cheese, put little bits of butter in the bottom of the dish, then some macaroni, and a layer of cheese; put them alter- nately, mix all together, and serve it hot. To make Macaroni. Beat four eggs for eight or ten minutes, strain them, and stir in flour till stiff enough to work into a paste upon a marble, or stone slab; add flour till it be a stiff paste, and work it well; cut oft’ a small bit at a time, roll it out as thin as paper, and cut it with a paste-cutter or knife into very narrow strips ; twist, and lay them upon a clean cloth, in a dry, warm place ; in a few hours it will be per- fectly hard ; put it into a box, with white paper under’fcnd over it. It may be cut into small stars, or circles, to be used for soup, and does not require so much boiling as the Italian macaroni. T

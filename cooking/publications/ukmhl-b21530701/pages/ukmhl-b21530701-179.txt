135 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Hog’s lard is the inner fat of the bacon hog. Porkers are not so old as hogs; they make excellent pickled pork, but are chosen more particularly for roast- ing. To roast a leg, a small onion is minced together with three sage leaves, seasoned with pepper and salt, and put under the skin at the knuckle bone; the skin is cut into strips nearly half an inch apart, and rubbed over with a bit of butter. If weighing seven or eight pounds, it will require nearly three hours to roast. A spare rib should be roasted, is basted with butter, and has sage leaves dried, rubbed to a powder, and mix- ed with salt and pepper, sprinkled over it. Both a loin and neck are jointed, the skin scored in nar- row strips, and rubbed with butter. If weighing six or seven pounds, it will require rather more than two hours to roast. A griskin may be either broiled or roasted. A chine is stuffed here and there with bread crumbs, mixed with a little butter, and seasoned with some finely shred sage, parsley, and thyme, some pepper and salt. The skin is cut into strips, and rubbed with butter; it is then roasted, and served with apple sauce, as are also the preceding roasts. A porker’s head is stuffed like a sucking pig, sewed firmly, and hung on a string to roast. The shoulder may be roasted, but, being very fat, it is generally preferred pickled. The breast may be made into a pie, or broiled. To boil hams, they should be put on in water, the chill taken off, and simmered for four or five hours, ta- king care not to allow them to boil.

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 406 moved to the cask, the bung-hole covered with a tile, and the cask is stirred every other day, for ten days, and filled up every day as the fluid wastes. The fermentation may con- tinue from three to six weeks; when it has subsided, the wine is racked into a cask in which matches, dipped in sul- phur, have been burned, or in which a little of the sul- phate of potash, or of oxymuriate of potash, has been put. It should be again racked and fined in March, when the wine is completed, and may be bottled, or allowed to re- main in the cask. Ripe Gooseberry Wine May be made by the same rule, excluding carefully from it all the husks. Black Currant Wine. The same varieties of proportions are allowed in this as in the others already mentioned. The fruit being pick- ed, it is brought to the boiling point in as much water as to avoid any risk of burning; it may then be strained and put into the cask, or the liquid and skins may, with the other ingredients, be first fermented in the vat or tub, by which the wine will acquire a higher colour and flavour. Strawberries and Raspberries. From either of these fruits agreeable wine may be ob- tained, by following the rules given for making currant wine ; but it will be found a cheaper and a better method, to add a little sirup or juice of the fruit to any flavour- less currant wine ; when the fermentation begins to de- cline, currant wine may also be flavoured with odoriferous flowers, such as cowslip, elder, or mignionette. The qua- lity of roughness is communicated by catechu and keno, chips of oak and of beech, and also the sloe; a small quantity of these, or of the flowers, is put into the cask when the first fermentation is over, and as soon as the wine has acquired the desired flavour, it is racked and fined. The flavouring articles, such as orris-root, cloves, ginger, sweet and bitter almonds, are put into a muslin

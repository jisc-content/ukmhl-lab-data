Boil in four quarts of water a shank of ham, or a piece of bacon, and about half a pound of mutton, or salt beef, and a pint of split peas; boil all together very gently till the peas are quite soft, strain them through a hair sieve, and bruise them with the back of a spoon till all is pulped through, then boil the soup gently for one hour before serving. Thin slices of bread toasted and cut in dice to be served with it, either upon a dish or in the soup ; if in the soup, it should be fried in butter, and dried mint rubbed fine sent to table in a small dish. It may be also made with fourpence worth of bones, boiled for some hours in four quarts of water, with a carrot, a head of celery, three onions, some pepper and salt, strained, and the next day the fat taken off, and the peas boiled in the liquor with a little bit of butter, till sufficiently tender to pulp through a sieve. Green Peas Soup. Put a pint of old green peas into three quarts of water, a slice of the crumb of bread, two onions, a sprig of mint, some salt and pepper; boil them till the peas are perfectly soft, and then pulp them through a sieve ; have ready two lettuces stewed tender in butter, and a pint and a half of young green peas boiled ; put them into the soup with a little spinach juice, and a quarter of a pint of the juice of the youngest pea pods, and boil it all to- gether before serving. Another Green Peas Soup. Shell a quart of green peas not very old, put the shells into a gallon of cold water, with a bit of bacon or mutton, boil them till very soft, pour the liquor through a hair sieve, and bruise the shells with a spoon till no- thing remains but the skin.

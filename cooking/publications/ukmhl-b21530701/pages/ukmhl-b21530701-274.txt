THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 230 a little lemon peel mixed; lay them into the bottom of a dish, and then a few slices of sweetbreads seasoned with the spices; add some oysters, forcemeat balls, and hard-boiled yolks of eggs, half a pint of white stock, a glass of white wine, and a table-spoonful of lemon pickle ; put puff paste on the edge of the dish, and cover with the same; bake it for one hour. Another Veal Pie. Cuor, but not very small, the meat of a cold loin of veal, season it with minced parsley, white pepper, salt, grated lemon peel, and nutmeg; add rather more than half a pint of stock made with the bones, thickened with a bit of butter rolled in flour, and seasoned with a tea- spoonful of lemon pickle, and a table-spoonful of white wine ; make a paste of the fat of the loin, and an equal quantity of flour, rub it together, and mix with it a little cold water, roll it out two or three times, line the sides of the dish, put in the meat, and cover it. Solid Veal Pie. Stew in veal stock, till it be perfectly tender and like a jelly, a piece of a knuckle of veal, with the gristles adhe- ring to it; let it cool, and then pull the meat and gristles into small bits ; butter a pie dish or shape, and lay at re- gular distances some hard-boiled yolks of eggs, and some of the white part cut into rings or strips; then put over some bits of the meat and gristle, and strew over it some white pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg mixed, add a little of the gravy, and then more eggs, with small bits of beet- root, green pickles, and the red part of a carrot cut to fancy ; add more meat-seasoning, and all the gravy; when the shape is full, put it into an oven for twenty minutes, and when quite cold turn it out. If rightly done it will have a glazed appearance, and the variety of colours look well by candle light. Mutton Pie. Cut into neat steaks a loin or the best end of a neck

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 397 red cabbages, shred them very finely, first pulling off the outside leaves; mix with them nearly half a pound of salt, tie it up in a thin cloth, and let it hang for twelve hours; then put it into small jars, and pour over it cold vinegar that has been boiled with a few barberries in it ; tie the jar over closely with bladder; or boil, in a quart of vinegar, three bits of ginger, half an ounce of black and Jamaica pepper, and a quarter of an ounce of cloves. When cold, pour it over the red cabbage. To Pickle Barberries.

They may also be kept in a jar, with a strong brine of salt-and-water poured over them. When any scum is observed upon the surface, the brine must be poured off, and some fresh added. They are kept closely covered. To Pickle Green or Red Capsicums.

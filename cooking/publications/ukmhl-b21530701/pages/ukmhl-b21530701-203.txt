Another way to Stew Duck. Put into a duck some pepper, salt, a minced onion, and one leaf of sage also minced; half roast it; brown with two ounces of butter, a table-spoonful of flour; add as much weak stock or water as will half cover the duck, and some pepper and salt; put in the duck, and a quart of green peas ; let it stew for half an hour, stirring it now and then. For a variety, a dozen of middling-sized onions may be substituted for the peas, and stewed the same length of time. Cold roasted duck may be dressed exactly in the same manner; and to hash it, cut it into joints, and heat it tho- roughly in gravy, adding a little soy, and a glass of port wine. To Stew Goose Giblets. Clean the giblets nicely, parboil them. Cut the necks into three, the gizzards into four, the livers, pinions, and heads into two ; take the outer skin off the feet, stew them in one quart of good stock, with a bunch of sweet herbs, a few peppercorns, two cloves, one anchovy, two large onions, and a table-spoonful of catsup. When the giblets are tender, take them out, and strain the sauce; thicken it with flour and butter, and a table-spoonful of white wine or cream. Add the giblets, and serve them quite hot; put sippets of thin toasted bread round the dish. Ox tails may be dressed in the same way as the above. Another way to Stew Goose Giblets. Prepare the giblets as before directed, parboil them ; thicken a pint of gravy soup, or the liquor they have been parboiled in, with flour and butter, boil and skim it; add the giblets, with an onion cut small, some pepper

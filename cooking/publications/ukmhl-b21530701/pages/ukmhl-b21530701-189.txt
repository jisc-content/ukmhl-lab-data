145 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. some tongue cut into slices, then the rest of the meat and the remainder of the tongue, draw the cloth tightly across the top ; put on it a board or a plate that will fit into the shape, and place on it a heavy weight, which must not be taken off till it be quite cold. It is eaten with vinegar and mustard, and served for luncheon or supper. To Stew a Ham. Soak the ham in lukewarm water for twelve hours, drain it, and scrape the rind ; put it into a stew-pan with some slices of fat bacon round the sides, four quarts of weak stock, a good deal of parsley, a bunch of sweet herbs, six large onions, four carrots, a little allspice and black pepper, a pint of Madeira, and one of port wine. Cover the ham with slices of fat bacon, and put over it a sheet of white paper ; stew it eight hours, or ten if it be a very large ham. Before serving, take off the rind, strain the sauce, skim it well, and boil it till reduced to a glaze, and pour it round the ham, or serve it with any other sauce that may be preferred. Bacon. For one side of a large pig allow one pound of coarse common salt, the same quantity of coarse brown sugar, two ounces of saltpetre, and two of rock salt finely pound- ed. Mix them well, and nib it on both sides of the pork, and when all is rubbed in, then lay it upon a wooden table placed slopingly, and put on it a board and weight. Place under it a vessel to catch the brine. Turn it once in two or three days, and baste it with the brine. Let it remain in this way for three weeks, and then hang it up to smoke for twenty-four hours, which will be a sufficient length of time, if the smoke is powerful. K.

THE PRACTICE Ol COOKERY. '<(> A Rump of Beef a la Braise.- Atter a rump of beef has hung for five or six days, bone, and lard it thickly, but so as not to appear upon the surface, witli bits of bacon or ham cut about half an inch square, and rolled in the following seasoning well mixed : Finely minced onion, parsley, thyme, a little garlic, pep- per, and salt. What is left over of the seasoning add to a pint of vinegar, one of port wine, and a tea-cupful of salad oil; steep the beef in this for one night; the follow- ing day paper it, and roast it in a cradle spit. Baste it well, and serve it with a thick brown gravy. A little lemon juice and sliced pickled cucumbers may be added. Garnish with slices of boiled carrot and scraped horse- radish. Stewed Beef. Stew in five quarts of water the middle part of a brisket of beef weighing ten pounds, add two onions stuck with two cloves, one head of celery, one large carrot, two turnips cut small, a handful of sorrel leaves, half an ounce of black pepper, and some salt. Stew it gently for six hours. Make a strong gravy with carrots and turnips, the turnips to be scraped and fried of a brown colour in butter; add pepper, salt, and a little cayenne ; thicken it with flour and butter, and pour it over the beef, with the carrots and turnips. Another way to Stew Beef. Take ten pounds of a brisket of beef, cut the short ribs, and put it into a well-buttered sauce pan, with two large onions, stuck with three or four cloves, two or three carrots cut into quarters, a bunch of sweet herbs, a small lemon sliced, and five quarts of water ; let it stew seven hours. Strain and clarify the gravyâ€”thicken it with butter and flour. Chop the carrots with some capers, mushroom catsup, and cayenne. Any other pickle that is liked may be added.

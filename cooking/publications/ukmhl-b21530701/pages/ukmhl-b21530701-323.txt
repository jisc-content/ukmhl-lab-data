Four well-beaten eggs, half a pint of cream, two table- spoonfuls of yeast, three of white wine, and two of rose water ; half a tea-spoonful of grated nutmeg, and of salt; make it into a thick batter with flour, peel and core two or three apples, cut them into thin bits, and mix them with the batter; cover it over, let it stand, placed near the fire, about an hour; drop it into boiling lard, and serve them in a napkin with sugar strewed over them.

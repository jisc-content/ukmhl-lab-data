THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 66 body shell, with the small claws put underneath to re- semble a lobster. To butter Lobsters or Crabs. Pick all the meat from the bodies of either, mince it small, put it into a sauce-pan with two or three table- spoonsful of white wine, one of lemon pickle, and three or four of rich gravy, a bit of butter, some salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg; thicken it with the yolks of two eggs beat up, and when quite hot, put it into the large shells ; garnish them with an edging of bread toasted. Cutlets of Lobster, Crab, or Oyster. Pick out carefully all the meat of a large lobster, mince it, and add it to two ounces of butter, which has been browned with two table-spoonsful of flour, and seasoned with a little white pepper, salt, and cayenne ; add about half a pint of strong stock, stir it over the fire till it is quite hot; put it in separate table-spoonsful upon a large dish. When cold, make them up into the form of mutton cutlets, brush over them the beaten yolks of eggs, dip them into grated bread, and fry them of a light brown colour, in boiling clarified beef dripping. Stick into the narrow end of the cutlet a bit of a small claw, about an inch long; place the cutlets round the dish, one a little over the other, and lay fried parsley in the centre of the dish. Instead of the claw, a bit of stick may be put into the end of the oyster cutlet. Bradu Fagadu.

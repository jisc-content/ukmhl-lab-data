THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 341 essence of lemon, and one ounce of caraway seeds ; beat all these well together; bake it in a cake tin, which must be buttered and lined with paper, also buttered. It will require about one hour and a half to bake in a quick oven. It may be made without the almonds or the es- sence of lemon. Bairn Brack. To three pounds of dried flour allow one pound of fresh butter, one pound of good brown sugar, two ounces of caraway seeds, eight well-beaten eggs, three table- spoonfuls of fresh yeast, and some grated nutmeg; dis- solve the butter in a pint of milk, so as to make the whole into a dough, not very stiff; work it well; cover it with a cloth, and set it before the fire to rise ; when well risen, bake it in a buttered tin. When it becomes dry, it may be toasted and eaten with butter. Short Bread. For two pounds of sifted flour allow one pound of butter, salt or fresh; a quarter of a pound of candied orange and lemon peel, of pounded loaf sugar, blanched sweet almonds, and caraway comfits, a quarter of a pound each ; cut the lemon, the orange-peel, and almonds into small thin bits, and mix them with a pound and a half of the flour, a few of the caraway comfits, and the sugar; melt the butter, and when cool, pour it clear from the sediment into the flour, at the same time mixing it quick- ly. With the hands, form it into a large round of near- ly an inch thick, using the remainder of the flour to make it up with ; cut it into four, ami with the finger and thumb pinch each bit neatly all round the edge ; prick them with a fork, and strew the rest of the caraway comfits over the top. Put the pieces upon white paper dusted with flour, and then upon tins. Bake them in a moderate oven. Plain Short Bread. Tiie same proportions of flour and butter must be used as in the above receipt for short bread ; this must be

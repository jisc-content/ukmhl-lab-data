THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 335 finely-pouruled loaf sugar, half that weight of fresh but- ter, washed in rose water, and beaten to a cream; whisk the eggs, add to them the sugar, and beat these for twen- ty minutes; then mix in the butter and the rice flour, along with a few pounded bitter almonds, or the grated peel of a lemon, and beat all together for ten minutes. Butter small tins, half fill, and bake them in a quick oven. Another way to make Rice Cakes. Beat, till extremely light, the yolks of nine eggs; add half a pound of sifted loaf sugar, and the same quan- tity of sifted rice flour; melt half a pound of fresh butter, and mix it with the eggs, sugar, and flour, along with a few pounded bitter almonds; half fill small tins buttered with the mixture, and bake in a quick oven. * Currant Cakes. Take half a pound of cleaned and dried currants, the same quantity of dried and sifted flour, a quarter of a pound of pounded sugar, a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, four yolks, and three whites of eggs, both well beaten, and a little grated nutmeg or pounded cinnamon ; then beat the butter to a cream ; add the sugar, and then the eggs and the flour; beat these well for twenty minutes, mix in the currants and the grated nutmeg. Drop the cakes in a round form upon buttered paper, or bake them in small tins in a quick oven. Another way to make Currant Cakes. Take six ounces of currants, the same quantity of pounded loaf sugar, a little grated nutmeg, half a pound of butter, and three quarters of a pound of dried and sift- ed flour; rub the butter with the flour till they be well mixed, then add the other ingredients, and bind them with three beaten yolks of eggs, and two or three spoonfuls of rose or orange-flower water; roll it out, and cut it into round cakes with the top of a wine glass or a tin.

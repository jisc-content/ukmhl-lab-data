THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 1(51 drop in four or five eggs; put upon each a little pepper and salt, set the dish upon a stove, and serve it when the eggs are firm, which may be in ten or fifteen minutes. Poached E^s. OO Fill a frying-pan with boiling water, break some eggs one by one into a tea-cup, and slip them one by one into the water. When the white part is sufficiently done, take them out with an egg slice, and lay them upon toasted bread cut into square bits, or upon spinach. To poach eggs nicely, they must be quite fresh. Buttered Eggs. Beat and strain ten or twelve eggs; put a piece of butter into a sauce-pan, and keep turning it one way till melted ; put in the beaten eggs, and stir them round with a silver spoon till they become quite thick. Serve them in a dish upon buttered toast. They may be eaten with fish, fowl, or sausages. Fried Eggs. Eggs boiled hard, cut into slices, and fried, may be served as a second course dish, to cat with roasted chickens. To Preserve Eggs. Pour a gallon of water over a pound of unslaked lime, stir it well; the following day, pour off the clear water into ajar, and put in the eggs as they are laid. In this manner they will continue perfectly good for six months or more. L

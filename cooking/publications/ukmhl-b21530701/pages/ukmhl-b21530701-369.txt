THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 325 brandy ; pour over them a rich boiled custard, and when quite cold, lay on the whipt cream, piled as high as pos- sible. Coloured comfits may be strewed over the top. Another way to make Trifle. Mix three table-spoonfuls of white wine, and one of sugar, with a pint and a half of thick cream ; whisk it, and take off as much froth as will heap upon the dish, into which lay some pieces of spunge cake, or some spunge biscuit, soaked with sweet wine, and covered with pre- served strawberries, or any other fruit; pile the froth upon this, and pour the remainder of the cream into the bottom of the dish ; garnish with flowers. A Large Syllabub. One pound of ratafia cakes pounded and steeped in two bottles of port wine, one of claret, and one of brandy, the grated peel and juice of two lemons, one large nutmeg grated, and two ounces of sweet almonds, blanched and pounded with a little rose water, and pounded sugar suf- ficient to make it sweetâ€”Put all these ingredients, well mixed, into a large china bowl, or bowls of an equal size, and let the milk of a good cow be milked upon them ; add a little rich cream and sifted loaf sugar, and cover it to keep it warm. It may be served out into glasses with a silver ladle. Another way to make Large Syllabub. A large glass of madeira, one of rich sweet wine, and half a one of ratafia, half a pound of pounded loaf sugar, the grated peel of a large lemon, the juice of two, and a little pounded cinnamon ; stir it all together till the sugar be dissolved, and add a quart of rich cream ; whisk it well; lay some macaroons into the bottom of a dish, and pile the frothed syllabub high upon it. It may be kept nine or ten days, and is better the third and fourth than when first made.

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 848 of fi'esh butter washed in rose water, one pound of trea- cle, one nutmeg grated, the weight of a nutmeg of pound- ed mace, and as much of pounded cinnamon, one ounce of pounded ginger, one and a half of candied orange and lemon peel, cut small, half an ounce of blanched sweet al- monds, cut into long thin bits, and two well-beaten eggs. Melt the butter with the treacle, and when nearly cold, stir in the eggs and the rest of the ingredients; mix all well together, make it into round cakes, and bake them upon tins. Indian Gingerbread. Take twelve ounces of pounded loaf sugar, a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, one pound of dried flour, two ounces of pounded ginger, and of cloves and cinnamon a quarter of an ounce each. Mix the ginger and spice with the flour; put the sugar and a small tea-cupful of water in- to a sauce-pan ; when it is dissolved, add the butter, and as soon as it is melted, mix it with the flour and other things ; work it up, and form the paste into cakes or nuts, and bake them upon tins. Breakfast, or Tea Cakes. Take one pound of flour, and mix it with half a pound of butter dissolved, together with a little cream, milk, or water, and half a tea-spoonful of salt; work it well, and roll it into round balls. Have wafer-irons ready heated, put into them a ball of the paste, press them, and hold the irons upon the fire for a minute or two. Slim Cakes for Breakfast or Tea. To one pound of flour, allow two beaten eggs, one ounce of butter, half a tea-spoonful of salt, and as much warmed milk as will make the whole into a pretty stiff paste; work it well, cover it over, and let it remain be- fore the fire for half an hour; roll it out, and cut it into round cakes, with a small saucer or the top of a tumbler; do them in a nicely-cleaned frying-pan ; dust them with a little flour. They may be baked upon a plate of iron, or what is called in Scotland a girdle.

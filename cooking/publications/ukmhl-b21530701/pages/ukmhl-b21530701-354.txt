THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 310 more than half a bottle of strong ale or porter, a pound of loaf sugar, the peel of one, and the juice of four large lemons, a stick of cinnamon, and the beaten whites of eight eggs; put it all into a sauce-pan, stir it gently; let it boil for fifteen minutes, and pour it into a jelly-bag till it runs perfectly clear. Ox Feet Jelly. Put a little hot water over the top of the stock, pour it off, and wipe it dry with a clean cloth ; put a quart of it into a sauce-pan with the beaten whites of five or six eggs, the juice of five lemons made very sweet with good brown sugar, a clove or two, and a little cinnamon pounded; let it boil twenty minutes, stirring it all the time; take it off the fire, and add a pint, or half a pint of white wine, and run it through a jelly-bag till clear.

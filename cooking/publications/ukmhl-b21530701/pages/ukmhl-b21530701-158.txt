THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 114 Veal Collated White. Bone a breast of veal; chop and strew over it some finely-chopped sweet herbs; make a forcemeat of beef suet, grated bread, lemon peel, a small onion pounded ; season with white pepper, grated nutmeg, and salt; pound it in a marble mortar, and lay it thickly over the veal; roll it up firmly, sew it in a cloth, and boil it for three hours.

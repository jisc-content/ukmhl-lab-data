THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 221 Puff Paste. Weigh an equal quantity of flour and butter, rub ra- ther more than the half of the flour into one-third of the butter, then add as much cold water as will make it into a stiff paste; work it until the butter be completely mixed with the Hour, make it round, beat it with the rolling- pin, dust it, as also the rolling-pin, with dour, and roll it out towards the opposite side of the slab, or paste-board, making it of an equal thickness ; then with the point of a knife put little bits of butter all over it, dust dour over and under it, fold in the sides and roll it up, dust it again with dour, beat it a little, and roll it out, always rubbing the rolling-pin with dour, and throwing some underneath the paste, to prevent its sticking to the board. If the butter is not all easily put in at the second time of roll- ing out the paste, the remainder may be put in at the third; it should be touched as little as possible with the hands. Another Puff Paste. Make nearly all the dour into a stiff paste with cold water, knead it well, and divide it into two, roll out each piece rather more than a quarter of an inch thick; take the butter out of the water, and with the hands pat it out into a cake or dat piece, dour one piece of the paste, lay on it the butter, which is then domed and covered with the other piece of paste; datten it a little with the roll- ing-pin, and then roll it out, dusting the paste and the pin with dour before and after rolling, fold in the sides, roll it up and repeat the rolling out, folding up, and dust- ing with dour, till the buttpr is incorporated thoroughly with the paste. Puff paste, if good, will rise into blisters in the course of rolling it out; it may be made with three quarters of a pound of butter to one of dour; the dour should be dried, and is the better for being sifted. When the paste is rolled out for the last time, and made a quarter of an inch thick, place upon it the dish to be covered, and

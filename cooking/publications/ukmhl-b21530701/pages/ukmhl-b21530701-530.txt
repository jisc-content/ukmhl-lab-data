THE PRACTICE OF COOKE RT. 4-8 6 Beans. The early sorts, such as the Mazagon and Lisbon, are sown in the end of October, in front of a wall or hedge. The plants are earthed up in November, as they advance; but, in earthing up beans, it is necessary to be very careful that the earth do not fall on the centre of the plant. In severe frost some haum or fern is laid over them. In March and April, as they begin to show flower, they are kept close to the fence by means of pack- thread ; and, in order to forward the production of pods, when the lower blossoms begin to fade, the tops of the steins are pinched off. In February and March, full crops of the late and large beans, as the Windsor, Sand- wich, and long podded, are planted in drills two inches deep, allowing two and a half or three feet between the rows. Kidney, or French Bean. The dwarf kidney-bean requires no support from sticks, but, as it is tender, must be sown before the mid- dle or end of April; it may then be sown in drills, from two to three feet asunder, and about three inches sepa- rate in the lines, covering with something less than two inches of soil. As the plants advance, they are hoed and cleared of weeds, a little earth being, at the same time, drawn to the stems. The most esteemed kinds are, the speckled dwarf, early black or negro, and early white dwarf. The scarlet runner, being more tender than the dwarf kinds, must not be sown till about the middle of May ; and, as tall slight stakes must be placed for it to climb upon, the distance between the rows is general- ly four feet. The kidney-beans like a good, light, rich soil. Spinach. There are two kinds of spinach ; the prickly-seeded, for winter, and the smooth-seeded, for summer use. The winter crop is sown, either in drills or broadcast, in the

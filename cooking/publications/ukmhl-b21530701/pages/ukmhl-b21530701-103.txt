Mix together the following quantity of finely-pounded spices :—One ounce of cloves, half an ounce of Jamaica pepper, quarter of an ounce of black pepper, quarter of an ounce of cayenne, two nutmegs, a little mace, and two tea-spoonsful of ginger ; add the weight of the spices, and half as much again of salt, and mix all thoroughly. Clean the fish, and cut off the heads, fins, and tails ; put a tea- spoonful of the mixed spices into each fish, and lay them into a deep earthen jar, with the backs downwards ; cover them with clarified butter, tie a paper over the mouth of the jar, and bake them slotvly for eight hours. When the back bone is tender, the fish are done enough. Take them out of the jar, and put them into a milk-pan with the backs upwards ; cover them w'ith a board, and place upon it a heavy weight. When perfectly cold, remove the fish into fresh jars, smooth them with a knife, and cover them tvith clarified butter. To Broil Fresh Sturgeon. Cut it into cutlets ; rub them with the yolk of an egg beat up ; strew them over with some parsley, minced very fine, and mixed with grated bread-crumbs, pepper, and salt; put them into pieces of white paper buttered, and broil them gently.

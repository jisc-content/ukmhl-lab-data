THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 265 Potatoe-Flour Pudding. Boil some cinnamon, lemon peel, and sugar, in a quart of milk; strain, and stir it with three table-spoonfuls of potatoe flour previously mixed smooth with a little cold milk ; stir it till it be nearly cold ; add four well-beaten eggs, a glass of sweet wine, or two table-spoonfuls of spi- rits, and a little marmalade. Bake it in a Dutch oven. Potatoe Flour, or Starch. Wash some large mealy potatoes, peel, and throw them into a deep pan of cold water, in which grate them down upon a bread grater; then strain the mass through a hair sieve, let it settle for ten or fifteen minutes; pour off the water, put on fresh, stir it up, and again let it set- tle for half an hour or longer; repeat this until the wa- ter be perfectly clear, and the powder blanched of a pure white. Lay a linen cloth upon a riddle, put the flour upon it, and dry it in the sun or before the fire; turn, and stir it frequently; or it may be dried upon large flat dishes. Put it into jars, and tie them over with paper. Plum Pudding. Take one pound of fresh beef suet, very finely min- ced, one pound of good raisins stoned and chopped, one pound of currants nicely cleaned and dried, one pound of flour, the grated peel of one lemon, and half a large nut- meg, six well-beaten eggs, one ounce of candied orange, and half a one of candied lemon peel minced, half a pound of brown sugar, one glass of brandy, and a tea-cupful of cream. Mix all the ingredients well with the flour. Boil it in a cloth, put it on in a copper of boiling water, and keep it boiling for seven hours. Before serving, strew grated loaf sugar over it. Sauces :â€”Half a pint of white wine, three table-spoonfuls of water, three or four of pounded loaf sugar, and one ounce of butter, stirred till boiling hot; and plain melted butter, sweetened with su- gar. Brown sugar and currant wine may be used for the sauce.

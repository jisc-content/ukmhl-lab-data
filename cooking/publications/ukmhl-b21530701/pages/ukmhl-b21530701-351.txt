THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 307 add the grated peel and juice of two lemons, with half a pound of pounded loaf sugar, and the well-beaten yolks of six eggs; stir it over a slow fire till it thickens, pour it into a basin, and stir now and then till cold; put it into a dish, or cups, with sifted loaf sugar over the top. Another way to make Lemon Custard. Put the juice of four lemons, with three ounces of pounded loaf sugar, into a deep dish.

Beat the yolks of two eggs with a little cream; add it to nearly half a pound- of brown sugar burnt; strain it through a sieve, and when cold pour it round the custards. Orange Custard.

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 451 der shelter if otherwise; a wide and flat dish of water, often to be renewed, standing at hand ; barley, or any meal, the first food. In rainy weather particularly, it is useful to clip the tails of the ducklings, and the surround- ing down beneath, that they may not draggle and weaken themselves. The duck should be cooped at a distance from any other; their confinement to the coop need sel- dom extend to a fortnight. Oats whole or bruised are the standard fattening material for ducks and geese, to which may be added peasemeal, as it may be required; and if they are confined, the house-wash may be mixed with their food. They are very fond of acorns, and will get fat on them alone. The Goose. The best geese in England are probably to be found on the borders of Suffolk and Norfolk, and in Berkshire. The foreign varieties are kept only for ornament. Their treatment is similar to that of ducks. Some cooling greens, clivers, or the like, may be mixed with their first food, namely, barleymeal, bruised oats, or fine pollards. Hemlock or deadly nightshade should be removed from the range of young geese; and both old and young are often killed by swallowing slips of yew after they are able to frequent the pond. The young geese will obtain their living, and few people favourably situated allow them any thing more excepting the vegetable produce of the garden ; but to have fine geese, a little solid corn or pulse may be given morning and evening. Equal quan- tities of the meal of rye and pulse, mixed with skimmed- milk, form an excellent feeding article for geese and ducks. Pigeons. The proper place for the pigeon-house, or cot, is the poultry-yard ; it should have a south-west aspect. The common barred dovecot is well adapted to every situa- tion, and pigeons do well near dwellings, stables, bake- houses, or such offices. Its situation will necessarily de-

313 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. when nearly cold, mix with it the strained juice of eight or nine oranges; sweeten with pounded loaf sugar, and stir it till it be dissolved; strain it through a lawn sieve, and pour it into a shape. . Strawberry Jelly. Put some fresh-gathered strawberries into an earthen pan, bruise them with a wooden spoon, add a little cold water, and some finely-pounded loaf sugar. In an hour or two, strain it through a jelly-bag, and to a quart of the juice add one ounce of isinglass, which has been dis- solved in half a pint of water, well skimmed, strained, and allowed to cool; mix all well, and pour it into an earthen mould. Raspberry jelly, red currant jelly, and red currants mixed with raspberries, may be made exactly in the same manner; and the bright red colour may be improved by mixing in a little carmine or lake. When this kind of jelly is to be made with cherries, the fruit should be boil- ed a' few minutes in clarified sugar, and when cold, the juice of one or two lemons may be added with the isinglass. A little lemon-juice may be added to any of the other jellies, in proportion to the acidity of the fruit. They may be iced by covering and surrounding the mould with ice, without any salt. Floating Island. Boil, with a pint of milk, a bit of cinnamon, and half the peel of a lemon ; when almost cold, strain it, and mix with it the beaten white of one, and the yolks of three eggs; stir it over the fire till thick, pour it into a dish, and stir it now and then till cold. Whisk the whites of two eggs, and half a pint of Guava quince or red cun-ant jelly, till it be a very stiff froth, and heap it upon the custard. Another way to make Floating Island. Three spoonfuls of raspberry or currant jelly, and the

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 3G9 boil tlie melon in it for ten minutes. To every pint of sirup put the rind of a lemon, pared very thin, and cut into straws. This sweetmeat ought to be hept for a year before it is eaten. A melon of six pounds weight will require four pounds of refined sugar, and half a pound of ginger. To Preserve Red Pears. Parboil a dozen of pound pears in water; peel them. Clarify the same weight of fine loaf sugar that there is of pears ; add a pint of port wine, the juice and rind of one lemon, with a little cochineal, a few cloves, and a stick of cinnamon ; boil the pears in this till they become clear and red ; take them out, boil up the sirup, strain, and put it over the pears. To Preserve Large Smooth Green Gooseberries. Weigh equal proportions of sugar and of fruit; with n pen-knife, slit the gooseberries on one side, and lake out all the seeds; put them into a preserving-pan with cold water, scald them ; pour oft’ the water when cold ; put over and under them vine leaves, with more cold wa- ter; set them over the fire to green. Clarify the sugar; put the gooseberries into a deep jar, and pour the boiling sirup over them; in two days pour it oft’, boil, and put it over the fruit; repeat this till the sirup becomes thick, then put them into small jars. To Preserve the same, before they are Ripe. Gather the largest-sized gooseberries, and allow an equal quantity of pounded loaf sugar; cut the gooseber- ries in half, and take out the seeds ; wet the sugar with a little water, and put all together into a preserving-pan; carefully stir and scum them, and boil them till the sirup is clear and the fruit soft. 2 A

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 232 hours; when cold, take off the crust, and cover the dish with a rich puff paste, and bake it nearly an hour. It will keep for some time if the coarse paste be not re- moved. In this manner most meat pies may be made when required to be kept. Moorfowl Pie. Pick, clean, and wash very nicely five or six moor- fowl ; truss them as chickens are done for boiling, season them highly with two or three pounded cloves, some salt, black and Jamaica pepper, all mixed ; put into each bird a bit of butter rolled in the spices, lay them closely into a dish, and add half a pint of rich brown stock, and a wine glass of port wine; cover the dish with puff paste, and bake it one hour. Hare Pie. Cut the hare into small joints, divide the back into five or six pieces, wash it extremely well, and let it lie some time in cold water; dry and season it highly with two pounded cloves, some black and Jamaica pepper; lay it in a dish, with half a pint of brown stock, and two wine glasses of port wine ; cover the dish with puff paste. For a family dinner, and when it is to be eaten hot, the paste may be made of lard or dripping. Giblet Pie. Scald two or three sets of goose-giblets, pick and singe them ; take the outer skin off the feet, which, with the pinions, cut into two, the neck into three, the gizzard into four, and the liver and heart into two bits; wash them all clean, put them in a sauce-pan, cover them with water, add two onions, a little salt, and a tea-spoonful of whole black pepper; stew them till the gizzards be tender; take them out, and put them into the pie dish, season them with more pepper and salt, strain the liquor, and add half a pint of it with a glass of port wine ; when cold, put puff paste round the edge of the dish, and cover it with the same. A beef-steak, well seasoned, may be laid in the hottom of the dish.

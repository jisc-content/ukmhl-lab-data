Mince some cold roast veal together with a little ham, season it highly with pepper, salt, mace, and lemon peel; add a large table-spoonful of mushroom catsup, and a quarter of a hundred of oysters, with their liquor, and three or four table-spoonfuls of rich gravy.

Lambs’ tails may be made into a pie, with lamb chops seasoned in the same manner as the above. Another Veal Pie. Cut into steaks a loin or breast of veal, season them highly with white pepper, salt, grated nutmeg, mace, and

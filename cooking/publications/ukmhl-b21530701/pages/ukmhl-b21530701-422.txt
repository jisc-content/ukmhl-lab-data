378 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Another way to make Apple Jelly. Pare and mince three dozen of juicy acid apples, put them into a pan, cover them with water, and boil them till very soft; strain them through a thin cloth or flannel bag; allow a pound of loaf sugar to a pint of juice; clarify and boil it; add the apple juice, with the grated peel and juice of six lemons ; boil it for twenty minutes ; take off the scum as it rises. Gooseberry Cheese. Top and tail some red gooseberries, put them into a jar, tie it over, and boil it in a pan of water till the fruit will easily pulp through a fine hair sieve ; allow a quarter of a pound of loaf sugar to a pint of the juice, stir, boil, and skim it for twenty minutes, put it into saucers or small plates, dry it before the fire, and when dry, keep it between folds of white paper. To keep Currants for Tarts. Gather the fruit perfectly diy, and before it be too ripe, pick it from the stalks, and put it into clean, dry, wide-mouthed bottles ; if the flavour of raspberries is ap- proved, some may be added with the currants ; tie tightly over each bottle a piece of sound bladder previously soak- ed in water; set them into a pan of-cold water with a lit- tle straw at the bottom, and a little between the bottles ; put them on the fire, and when they begin to simmer, keep them in that state about three quarters of an hour, but they must not be allowed to boil; take the pan off the fire ; the bladders will be raised, but will fall soon after, and 6ink into the mouth of the bottles ; in an hour, take them out, and tie strong paper over each, and set them in a dry cool place. The bottles may be placed in a bottle rack with the neck downwards. Damsons, cherries, and gooseberries, may be done in this way; any sort will keep for a year. Cut offâ€™ the stalks of the cherries, and top and tail the gooseberries.

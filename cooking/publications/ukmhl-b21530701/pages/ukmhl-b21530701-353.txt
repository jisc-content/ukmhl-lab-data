THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 309 and place them at a little distance from the fire, that it inay dry gradually; when clear and hard put it up in paper bags. Six ounces of this jelly, dissolved in three pints of water, and boiled to a quart, is sufficient to make what will fill two middling-sized moulds. Ox feet may be substituted for calf’s feet; the jelly made from them is equally good, but not so delicate in colour. Jelly. To a quart of the stock jelly put half a pound of loaf sugar pounded, a stick or two of cinnamon broken into small bits, the peel of a lemon, a pint of currant wine, and one of sherry or teneriffe, and the beaten whites of five eggs; put it all into a nicely-cleaned sauce-pan, stir it gently till it boils, and boil it for three or four minutes. Pour it into a jelly-bag, with a basin or mug placed un- derneath ; run it immediately through the bag again into another basin, and repeat this till it begins to drop. It will then be as transparent as possible, and may be put into moulds or glasses. When all lias apparently dripped, pour about a pint of boiling water into the bag, which will produce a little thin jelly fit to drink; the stand with the jelly-bag should be placed near to the fire; sherry alone, or teneriffe, may be used. The jelly may be put into quart bottles corked tightly, which will make it keep good for some weeks; place the bottle in warm water when it is required for use. Fresh Calf’s Feet Stock. Scald, take off the hair, and wash very clean four feet; put them into a sauce-pan with two quarts of cold water, and when it comes to a boil let them simmer for six or seven hours ; take out the feet, and strain the liquor into a deep dish. The following day remove the fat care- fully from the top, and give it another boil, which will reduce it to one quart of stiff stock or jelly. Ale or Porter Jelly. For a large shape, put to the prepared stock or jelly,

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 514 CHAPTER XXV. ON PIGS. Pigs may be considered of primary importance to the farmer, and to every other householder, as to them the refuse of the fields, the dairy, and the kitchen, is a feast. Though that food should be gross and dirty, they will not reject it; and theyare often reared in cold and filthy habi- tations ; but it is only by order and cleanliness that suc- cessful feeding can be ensured. Where a large stock is kept, their feeding-house should be thirty feet by fifteen : it may be divided into four rooms, the two in the middle to be adapted for eating, and the others for sleeping apartments ; each should have an outside door, and also an inner communication, that the keeper may get their eating-rooms swept out, their mangers cleaned, and their food put in, while the pigs are at rest. Each of the above- mentioned eating and sleeping rooms, in case of being required for sows and young pigs, may be divided into two by partitions, made to remove at pleasure. The sleeping apartments ought to be dark ; and the house, as also the square, or yard, formed by the huts or other buildings for sows, should be paved, and well littered ; and water should be within reach of the pigs. The man- ger, or trough, must be always washed out before put- ting in their victuals; and that which remains in it after the pigs are satisfied, should be given to some of the young stock.

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 314 whites of as many eggs; beat them together one way till the spoon will stand erect; pile it upon cream beaten up with wine and sugar, and a little grated lemon-peel; or upon apple jelly. Un Turban de Ris, et de Pommes. Boil, in milk, some fine whole rice, with half the peel of a lemon. Pare and core some apples, and cut them in- to quarters; stew them in a sirup of sugar and water, with a little orange marmalade, taking care to keep them quite whole. Make a rich custard as follows: Sweeten a quart of thin cream or good milk, and boil it with le- mon peel and cinnamon ; strain the cream, and let it cool. Beat up the yolks of ten eggs, and mix the cream gra- dually with them ; put it over a slow fire, and Peep stir- ring constantly till it is pretty thick ; pour it into a dish, and stir in a table-spoonful of rose water or brandy, but both will enrich the flavour; keep stirring it occasional- ly till nearly cold. Place the rice round a dish in the form of a wall, put the custard into it, and build the ap- ples all round the outside, so as to hide the rice. It may be sent to table quite cold, or in some degree warm. Orange Fool. Mix the strained juice of three Seville oranges with six well-beaten eggs, a pint of cream, some grated nut- meg and lemon-peel; sweeten with pounded loaf sugar, and stir it over a slow fire till it is as thick as a custard, but do not allow it to boil; pour it, when a little cool, into a glass dish or custard-cups; put sifted loaf sugar over the top. Gooseberry Fool. Scald a quart of gooseberries with half a pint of wa- ter; when quite soft, rub the pulp through a sieve. Boil half a pint of milk, and the same quantity of cream, with half the peel of a lemon, and a stick of cinnamon ; strain it when nearly cold, and mix it with the pulped fruit, and sweeten with good brown sugar. Serve in glasses or

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 393 Oyster Catsup. Boil one hundred oysters with their liquor, till the strength be extracted from them ; strain them well, and add to the liquor an equal quantity of wine, one half port and the other sherry, also a quarter of an ounce of mace, the same of white pepper and of allspice, a drachm or tea-spoonful of ginger, and six anchovies; boil all toge- ther about fifteen minutes. Put into a jar twelve shalots, the peel of a lemon, and a piece of horse-radish cut small; pour upon them the boiling liquor, and when cold, bottle it, together with the spices. Prince of Wales’s Catsup. Strip and fill a jar with ripe elder-berries; add as much vinegar as the jar will contain, put it into a cool oven, and let it stand all night. Run the liquor through a jelly-bag, and to every pint put two ounces of ancho- vies, one of shalots; of cloves, mace, nutmeg, and ginger, a drachm or tea-spoonful each; boil it till the anchovies are dissolved. When cold, strain and bottle it. Lemon Pickle. Cut into quarters, and pick out all the seeds of six middling-sized lemons; put them into a jar, strew over them two ounces of well-beaten bay salt; cover the jar with a cloth and plate, and let it stand three days; then put to them cloves and a quarter of an ounce of mace beaten fine, one ounce of garlic or shalot, two of mus- tard-seed bruised, and one nutmeg sliced. Make a quart of vinegar boiling hot, and pour it over the ingredients; cover the jar, and in three or four days close it with a bung, and tie-leather over it. It will be fit for use in a week, and is an improvement to most sauces, and parti- cularly to fish sauce. Another way to make Lemon Pickle. Grate oft’ a little of the outer rind of two dozen of lemons, divide them into four rather more than half way

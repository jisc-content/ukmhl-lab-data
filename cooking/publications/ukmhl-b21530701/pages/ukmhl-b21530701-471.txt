THE PRACTICE OE COOKERY. 427 To Clean Polished Grates and Irons. Make into a paste, witli cold water, four pounds of putty-powder, ami one of finely-powdered whitening; dip a duster into the mixture ; rub oft’ carefully all the spots, and with a well-aired clean duster, rub the grate or irons one way till bright and clear. Plain dry whitening will keep it highly polished if well attended to every day. The putty-mixture should be used only to remove spots. To remove rust from the poker, tongs, and shovel, boil one pound of middling-sized emery-powder with half a pound of soft soap, till it is as thick as paste; when cold, nib the irons with it; rub it oft' with a dry cloth, and polish with finely powdered and sifted brick dust, or whitening. To keep steel grates, fenders, and tire-irons from rust- ing, rub them over with fresh mutton suet, melted, and then dust them with unslaked lime, tied up in a bit of coarse muslin. To Clean Brass and Copper. Rub it over slightly with a bit of flannel dipped in sweet oil; next, rub it hard with another bit dipped in finely- powdered rotten stone ; then make it clean with a soft linen cloth, and finish by polishing it with a plate-leather. Another way to Clean Brass and Copper. Put one penny-worth of powdered rotten stone into a dry clean quart bottle ; nearly fill it up with cold soft water ; shake it well, and add one penny-worth of vitriol. Rub it on with a rag, and dry it with a clean soft cloth, and then polish it with a plate-leather. This mixture will keep for a long time, and becomes better the longer it is kept. But the first method gives the most lasting polish, as well as the finest colour. For Scouring Floors. Dry some fuller’s earth, and with boiling water make it into a thick paste ; mix it with one-third of its quan- tity of very fine sand, sifted ; sprinkle this mixture over

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 311 Apple Jelly. Pare, core, and cut thirteen good apples into small bits ; as they are cut, throw them into two quarts of cold water; boil them in this, with the peel of a lemon, till the sub- stance is extracted, and nearly half the liquor wasted; drain them through a hair sieve, and to a pint of the li- quid add one pound of loaf sugar pounded, the juice of one lemon, and the beaten white of one or two eggs ; put it into a sauce-pan, stir it till it boils, take oftâ€™ the scum, and let it boil till clear, and then pour it into a mould. Jaune Mange. Boil, till dissolved, in a pint of water, two ounces of isinglass, and the thinly-pared peel of one lemon and a half; strain, and add to it a pint of white wine, the juice of three Seville oranges or lemons, and the beaten yolks of eight eggs; sweeten it with pounded loaf sugar, put it into a sauce-pan, and stir it over the fire till it thick- ens ; pour it into a mould, and turn it out when cold. Arrow-Root Jelly. Steep for some hours, in two table-spoonfuls of wa- ter, the peel of a lemon, and three or four bitter almonds pounded; strain, and mix it with three table-spoonfuls of arrow-root, the same quantity of lemon-juice, and one of brandy; sweeten, and stir it over the fire till quite thick, and when quite cold, put it into jelly glasses. Rum Jelly. Clarify, and boil to a sirup, a pound of loaf sugar; dissolve one ounce of isinglass in half a pint of water, strain it through a sieve into the sirup when it is half warm, and when nearly cold, stir in a quart of white wine ; mix it well, and add one or two table-spoonfuls of old Jamaica rum, stir it for a few minutes, and pour it into a mould, or into glasses.

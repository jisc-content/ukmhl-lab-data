THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 413 small quantity of water, anil strained ; the rinds are to be steeped in the spirits all night, and the boiled liquid being cold, the whole is to be put into the cask, together with two drops of isinglass. In six weeks it may be bottled. Vinous Mead. To one gallon of water allow three pounds of honey; boil the mixture for a quarter of an hour ; skim it, and when nearly cold, pour it gently into a cask, in which crude tartar has been put in the proportion of an ounce to the gallon. As the fermentation may be long continued, a large portion of the liquid must be reserved for filling up the cask; it is put into bottles, which are closed with muslin or coarse linen. To excite fermentation, expose the cask to the influence of the sun, or put it into the corner of a chimney in which a constant fire is kept. In about seven or eight days, the liquor emits a thick and dirty froth ; the barrel must then be filled up from the bottles, and when the fermentation ceases, the cask must be bunged up and placed in the cellar. It may be bottled in twelve months. It is sometimes flavoured with flowers, or with the juice of fruits. Another way to make Mead. For a ten-gallon cask allow twenty pounds of honey, and fourteen gallons of water; boil and skim it; then add one ounce of cinnamon, one ounce of cardamoms, one and a half ounce of Jamaica pepper, two ounces of ginger, a quarter of an ounce of coriander seed, two large pieces of orris-root, and a few shavings of isinglass; boil these ingredients for about half an hour, and when the mixture has cooled, stir in a wine-glassful of yeast; next day pour it through a cloth into the cask, and allow it to ferment for about ten days; in a fortnight more it may bo bottled, and the corks sealed. A variety of this mead may be made by adding a gallon of cranberry juice to

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 479 till February or March. Savoys are reckoned better when somewhat pinched by the frost. If cabbages be planted, year after year, in the same ground, they will become sickly and stunted ; it is there- fore advisable to change the cabbage ground every year. Open Kale. Young plants of the common cabbage are now ge- nerally used as coleworts; for this purpose, either the I sugar loaf or the large York are sown about the middle or end of June, and planted out in the end of July, or beginning of August, to be ready for use in winter. Scots Kale Is sown in the beginning of July ; and in the course of the month of August, the young plants are set out in rows a foot and a half wide, and ten inches distance in the rows. This green will not be tender until it have endured some sharp frosts. When kale is planted out, it will be necessary to give water to the roots, should the weather be dry: no other attention is requisite, except that of drawing the earth to the stems before winter. Brussels Sprouts Are sown in March or April; the seedlings planted out in June preferring showery weather, or watering care- fully at the root: they are earthed up in October, and are ready for use by midwinter. As they grow upright, they may be planted closer than other kinds of greens. Cauliflower. The seed of the early crop of cauliflower is sown about the 20th of the August of the preceding year in beds. In September the seedlings are pricked into a dry bor- der, near a wall, where they may be hooped over, and defended with bass mats, during the severe frosts of win- ter. In the month of March they are finally planted out, giving water liberally now and afterwards, should the weather be dry. They are planted in rows about two

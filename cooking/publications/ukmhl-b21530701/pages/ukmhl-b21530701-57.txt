THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 13 red to be richer, boil a fowl in the stock, with two ounces of pounded blanched sweet almonds. Another White Soup. Put on in five quarts of water four pounds of a shank of veal, break the bone well, let it simmer till it be redu- ced nearly half; boil a tea-cupful of whole rice till very tender, pulp it through a cullender, strain the liquor, and add the rice, season with salt and white pepper, let it sim- mer for nearly an hour, and add, a little before serving, six yolks of eggs beaten extremely well. Moor-Fowl Soup. It may be made with or without brown gravy soup ; when with the former, six birds are sufficient, when with moor-fowl only, boil five in four quarts of water, pound the breasts in a mortar and rub it through a sieve, put it with the legs, backs, and three more moor-fowl, cut down in joints, into the liquor, season with a pint of port wine, pepper, and salt, and let it boil an hour. When only six birds are used, pound the breast of three or four. Pigeon Soup. Make a strong beef stock, highly seasoned as if for brown soup, take six or eight pigeons according to their size, wash them clean, cut off the necks, pinions, livers and gizzards, and put them into the stock ; quarter the pi- geons and brown them nicely ; after having strained the stock, put in the pigeons; let them boil till nearly ready, which will be in about half an hour, then thicken it with a little flour, rubbed down in a tea-cupful of the soup, season it with half a grated nutmeg, a table-spoonful of lemon juice or of vinegar, and one of mushroom catsup ; let it boil a few minutes after all these ingredients are put in, and serve it with the pigeons in the tureen ; a better thickening than flour is to boil quite tender two of the pigeons, take off all the meat and pound it in a mortar, rub it through a sieve, and put it, with the cut pigeons, into the strained soup.

THE PRACTICE OE COOKERY. 288 salt, aiul a table-spoonful of mushroom catsup ; fry it lightly in three ounces of butter, and hold it for a minute or two before the fire. Another way to make Omelet. Beat well and strain six eggs ; add them to three ounces of butter made hot; mix in some grated ham, pep- per, salt, and nutmeg, some chopped chives and parsley. Fry it of a light brown colour. Omelet with Kidney of Veal. To eight well-beaten eggs, add a little salt, and part of a cold roasted kidney of veal, finely minced ; season with pepper, and a little more salt; melt in a frying-pan one ounce and a half of butter, and pour in the omelet; fry it gently, and keep the middle part moist; when done, roll it equally upon a knife, and serve it very hot. Macaroni. Break the macaroni into small bits ; wash it, and sim- mer half a pound in a quart of good veal stock, and when quite tender, add some grated Parmesan cheese, and make it quite hot; put grated cheese into the bottom of a dish, and put over it the boiled macaroni; strew more cheese upon the top, and put small bits of butter here and there ; brown it with a salamander, or in an oven. A border of puff paste may be put round the dish, when it is baked, and the cheese ought not to be previously heated with the macaroni. Another way to dress Macaroni. Simmer the macaroni in milk, and when quite tender, mi> with it two ounces of salt butter, put grated cheese into the bottom of the dish, and "then a layer of macaroni; begin and end with the cheese, and over the top strew sifted bread ; put on it small bits of butter, and brown it in a Dutch oven, or with a salamander. 1

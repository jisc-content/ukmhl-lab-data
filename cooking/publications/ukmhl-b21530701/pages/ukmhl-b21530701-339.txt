THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 295 is whisked, then heap it upon a dish, or put it into glass- es. Garnish with thinly-pared citron, or cedraty, cut in- to small leaves, or into any fanciful shape. To colour the rose cream, or to heighten that of straw- berry, a little carmine or lake may be mixed with the cream, which may be iced when made. Spanish Cream. Boil, in half a pint of water, half an ounce of isinglass, till dissolved; strain, and mix it with a quart of cream or good milk; if cream, not so much isinglass; stir it over the fire till it comes to a boil; when a little cooled, add gradually the beaten yolks of six eggs, and a glass of white wine. Pour it into a deep dish, sweeten with pounded loaf sugar, stir it till cold, and then put it into a shape. Coffee Cream. Pu r two handfuls of fresh-burnt coffee, while hot, in- to a quart of boiling new milk ; cover it closely for three or four hours, strain, sweeten it with pounded loaf sugar, and add the well-beaten yolks of eight eggs; strain it again, and put it into custard-cups, which place in a sauce-pan of boiling water, to remain till they become firm. Another way to make Coffee Cream. Dissolve half an ounce of isinglass, boil it with a quart of cream, and mix with it about a pint of very strong coffee, sweeten it well with pounded white sugar- candy; whisk it for a few minutes, and serve it in custard- cups. It may be perfumed with a tea-spoonful of the essence of the cedrat fruit. Solid Cream. Squeeze the juice of a large lemon upon three or four table-spoonfuls of pounded loaf sugar, add two table- spoonfuls of brandy, and one pint of cream ; pour it from one cup into another, till it be sufficiently thick.

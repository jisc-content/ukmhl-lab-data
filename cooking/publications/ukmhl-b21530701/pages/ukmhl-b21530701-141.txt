The flesh of the ewe is of a paler colour; that of the ran) is strongly flavoured, is of a deep red co- lour, and the fat spongy. For keeping mutton, the same directions may be ob- served as for keeping beef. The haunch is the prime joint. It should be roasted at a good brisk fire, and basted as beef, the fat being first covered with a piece of white paper. Before serving, half a sheet of foolscap paper, folded and fringed, should be put round the shank bone. The haunch weighing fourteen pounds, will require two hours and a half to roast. Currant jelly sauce should be served with it. When a leg of mutton is to be boiled, it should first be washed clean, then put on, in boiling water, and careful- ly scummed. If weighing eight or nine pounds, it should be boiled nearly three hours, and then served with caper sauce. A saddle or a chine, that is to say, two necks or two loins, a joint, generally called, indifferently, a saddle of mutton, being broad, requires a high and strong fire. The skin should be taken off, and skewered on again, or paper may be substituted for it, tied on with a buttered string. It should be well basted, and a quarter of an hour before serving, the skin or paper removed; it is then allowed to brown a little, is sprinkled with salt, basted and dredged with flour, served with gravy in the dish, and currant jelly sauce. A shoulder of mutton should be roasted an hour and a half, and served with onion sauce, in a sauce tureen. A loin of mutton should be carefully jointed, roasted the same length of time as a shoulder, and is carved lengthways. G

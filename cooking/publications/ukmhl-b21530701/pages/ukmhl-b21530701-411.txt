THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 3GT the finest rose strawberries, gathered when perfectly dry ; then weigh them, and to each pound allow one of fine loaf sugar, which clarify and boil candy high ; pour it over the strawberries; wash out the preserving pan ; re- turn the fruit and sugar into it, and boil the strawberries for five minutes ; strain them through a large sieve, and boil the sirup for twenty minutes; then with a silver spoon carefully add the strawberries to it; and, if approved, half a pint of dripped red currant juice, and half a pound of sugar, to each pound of strawberries, and boil all together for ten minutes; carefully scum it. The large Bath, or Hautboy Strawberries May be preserved with an equal quantity of fine loaf sugar, which must be scummed and boiled for half an hour ; then, the fruit being added, it is boiled for half an hour or three quarters, and carefully scummed. Or the sugar maybe finely pounded and boiled with the fruit. Another way to Preserve Strawberries. * Gather the strawberries in the middle of a dry day, taking care that they are quite ripe, sound, and.good ; the best kinds are the rose, and large scarlet pine ; iu gather- ing, pick them carefully from the stalks. Pound fine loaf sugar, and allow equal weight of each ; lay the strawber- ries into one or two large dishes, and cover them complete- ly over with the sugar. On the following day, put theip into a preserving-pan, and place them over the fire till they are heated through ; do the same the next day, and on the third boil them up very fast, allowing them fifteen minutes after they come to boil all over; take them off I the fire, and have ready some aired silver paper to put upon them, to take oft’ the scum, instead of using a silver • « I spoon, which is apt to break them. This preserve may be eaten with cream. The process of boiling may be completed in one day, if begun at an early hour. * i rife* i -

Ill TiiE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. or two into cold water; rub it over with resin beaten ex- ceedingly fine ; it is sometimes rubbed with its blood be- fore the resin is put on ; dip it into a pail of scalding wa- ter, take it out, and rub off all the hair as quickly as pos- sible; if it should not all come off, repeat the scalding and rubbing with resin. When quite clean, wash it in warm, and frequently in cold water. Cut off the feet at the first joint; take out all the entrails ; put the pettitoes, heart, liver, and lights together. Wash the pig well in cold water, and dry it thoroughly. Make a stuffing of grated bread, butter, a small onion, and three or four sage leaves minced; season with pepper and salt, put it in- side, and sew it up. The pig being made perfectly dry, put the well-beaten white of an egg all over it with a feather. Put it down to roast before a very quick fire, and under it a small basin to catch the gravy. Do not flour it, and be sure to cover it well with the egg, which will crisp it nicely, and make it of a delicate light brown. It will take from one to two hours to roast. When done, cut off the head, part it and the body down the middle; mix with the chopped brains a little finely-minced boiled sage and some melted butter, add to it the gravy that- has ran from the pig, also mix with the stuffing some melted butter. Lay the pig on the dish, placing the shoulder of the one side to the hind quarter of the other. Observe in roasting the pig to skewer the legs back, so that the under part may be crisp. A pig prepared as above may be baked. Ham and Eggs. Cut some ham into thin slices, and broil them on a gridiron. Fry some eggs in butter. Serve it, laying an egg on each slice of ham. Pigâ€™s Harslet. Parboil the liver and lights, slice and fry them along with thin bits of bacon. Garnish with fried parsley.

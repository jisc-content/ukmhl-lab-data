462 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. must never be stirred. When cold, the froth is taken off the top, and the dregs removed ; it is then well wash- ed and worked up with honey, in the proportion of an ounce to each pound of butter. Preserved in this way, and potted, it will keep as long as salted butter, will be found more suitable for the table when to be eaten with sweetmeats, and in many respects better adapted for kit- chen use. To make Salt Butter Fresh. Put four pounds of salt butter into a churn with four quarts of new milk, and a little arnatto; churn them to- gether, and in about an hour take out the butter, and treat it exactly as fresh butter, washing it in water, and adding the customary quantity of salt. Cheese. In cheese-making, it is of the utmost consequence to have good rennet, which mav be obtained from the sto- machs of calves, hares, or poultry; that from the maw or stomach of calves is most commonly used, and the fol- lowing Scots method of preparing it seems to be the sim- plest and best:—When the stomach or bag usually term- ed the yirning, in dairy language, is taken from the calf’s body, straw, or any other impurity found in it, ought to be removed from the curdled milk, which, with the chyle, must be carefully preserved; a handful of salt is put inside; it is then l’olled up, and put into a basin or jar, and a handful of salt strewed over it; after standing closely covered for eight or ten days, it is taken out and tied up in a piece of white paper, and hung up near a fire to dry, like bacon, and will be the better for hanging a year before it is infused. When rennet is wanted, the bag with its contents is cut small, and put into a jar or can, with a handful or two of salt; new whey, or boiled water, cooled to 66°, is put upon it. If the stomach is from a newly-dropped calf, about three pints of liquor may be employed. If the calf has been fed for four or five weeks, which will yield more rennet than that of one twice that age, eight pints

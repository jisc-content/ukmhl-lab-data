THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 466 peated once every day, for some weeks, or till the cheese has acquired a rich golden polish, and the blue coat be- gins to appear. Stilton Cheese. Take fifteen gallons of milk, warm from the cow; put twelve pints of sweet cream in a small tub, and pour on it a kettle full of boiling water; stir it till it be well mixed, and then put it into the cheese-tub, with the milk ; when it is at 90Â° Fahrenheit, add the rennet; when it has coagulated, break the curd a little ; put a thin cloth over it, and take the whey off through it; when as much has been taken off as will come easily, put the curd into a bag or net, and let it hang till it give over dripping, then cut the curd in pieces, and lay it in as much cold water as will cover it; let it lie an hour, and as the pieces are taken out, strew a little salt upon them, and put them into the vat, first breaking the top a little, to make it join with the next piece ; then lay a small weight upon it, so as not to occasion the whey to come off white. It must be turned ever}? three hours the first day, and three times a-day for three days, changing the cloth every time it is turned in the vat, and keeping it under a moderate pres- sure ; it is then taken out of the vat, swathed tight till it begin to dry the bandage, which must be changed every twenty-four hours ; it ought to be rubbed with a little salt before it is bandaged, and, for a considerable time, wiped and turned every day. The best season for making this cheese, is from July till October. Another way to make Stilton Cheese. The rennet being added to fifteen gallons of milk, it is allowed to stand an hour, when the whey is taken off slowly, breaking the curd as little as possible ; this ope- ration will occupy about the space of an hour and a half; cold water is then poured over the curd, so as to cover it, and when it has stood twenty minutes, the water is drain- ed off, and the curd is broken, and salt added ; a pound of newly-churned butter, or a quart of fresh cream, is then

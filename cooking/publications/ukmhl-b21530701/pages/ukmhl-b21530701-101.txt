THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 57 To Bake Sprats. Clean them ; take off the heads ; put them into a deep dish, and cover them with vinegar and water, equal quan- * tities of each. To a quart of liquid, put half an ounce of whole black pepper, a little allspice, two or three bay leaves, some salt, and an onion. 'Fie paper over the dish, and bake them in a cool oven, or do them over a slow lire in a water bath. Herrings may be done in this way. Both will keep good some weeks. To Fry Smelts. This delicate little fish, when perfectly fresh, must not be washed, but wiped with a clean cloth, and dredged with flour, or brushed over with a feather, dipped into the yolk of an egg beaten, and rolled in a plate of finely- grated bread-crumbs, and fried in boiling dripping, or fresh lard. They vary in size, and some will be done sooner than others. When of a clear yellow brown, take them out carefully, and lay them before the fire upon the back of a sieve to drain and keep hot. Dish them, heads and tails alternately. Garnish with fried parsley. Sauce ; —melted butter. They may also be broiled. To Fry Soles.

Serve them with plenty of fried parsley. Sauces ;—shrimp sauce and melted butter.

THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 120 pickle, and three of white wine; boil it quick to a glaze ; keep the fricandeau over hot water and covered, then glaze it, and serve with the rest of the glaze poured round it, and sorrel sauce, in a sauce tureen. Another way to make a Fricandeau of Veal. Cut some slices of veal, lard them all through, and put them into a sauce-pan with some white stock, and a hit of ham, one onion, a little mace and pepper. Stew them gently an hour and a half; take them out, strain the gravy, and take off all the fat; boil it up quickly, lay in the fricandeau, and stew them till the liquor becomes like a brown jelly, take care they do not burn. Scald in boiling water three handfuls of sorrel, chop it, take out the meat, and make the sorrel hot in the sauce, and serve the fricandeau upon it. Another way to make a Fricandeau of Veal. Chop very finely one pound of the lean of a loin of veal, and half a pound of the kidney fat; season it with white pepper, salt, grated lemon peel, the juice of one lemon, and a finely-shred anchovy. Soak, in boiling milk, two rusks, or biscuits, and mix it all well together; make it into balls, with a little flour. Fry them of a light brown, in butter, then stew them in some highly- seasoned gravy, dish them carefully, and strain the gravy over them. Garnish with cut lemon. Veal Cake, to be eaten cold. Pound in a mortar as much cold roasted lean veal as will fill a small mould, together with a slice of ham, or bacon, a piece of the crumb of bread soaked in cold milk, two beaten eggs, a small bit of butter, the same of shalot, or onion; season with pepper and salt, and mix all well together; butter the mould, fill it and bake it in an oven for about an hour; turn it out when cold, and cut it into slices. Garnish with pickled eggs and parsley.

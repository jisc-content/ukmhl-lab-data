T1IE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 457 half a pint, and gin a tablo-spoonful, well mixed to- gether. Cordial. Caraway seeds, recently powdered, half an ounce, ginger half a dram, carbonate of soda one dram, water eight ounces, and brandy or gin one ounce, mixed well. Calves Should be taken from the cow immediately, and whether to be reared or fatted, are best fed entirely on milk ; but if it be scarce, they may get milk-porridge, or turnips boiled to a mash, and mixed with two pints of milk at each meal, which should be given three times a-day the first month, twice the second, and once the third. When the calf is to be fed for the table, it should have as much milk, warm from the cow, the last-drawn to have extremely fine veal, as it will take three times a-day. When it is five weeks old, it should be bled, and again a week after; in a few days more, it may be killed. Some persons consider bleeding unnecessary. Butter. In the production of good butter, more depends on management than on the quality of the cow, or the rich- ness of its food. When dairying is conducted on a great scale, the horizontal, commonly called the barrel- churn, is the best; the vertical, or pump-churn, is well adapted to the operation of making butter from the pro- duce of a few cows only. Milk is not at the best till about four months after the cow has calved ; and the de- gree of heat most favourable to the production of cream from milk, is from 50° to 55° Fahrenheit. In summer, the milk should be allowed to stand half an hour before it be put into the pans, which should not exceed two inches in depth. In winter, it should be set as soon as possible. From the last-drawn half of the milk, if al- lowed to stand till it tastes perceptibly sourish, cream of a superior quality will be obtained, and its quantity

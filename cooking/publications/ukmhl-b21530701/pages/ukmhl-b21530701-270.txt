Brush round the bottom with well-beaten whites of eggs; set on the sides, keeping the paste la- ther within the edge of the bottom ; pinch it all round, to make the pieces adhere, then fill the pie, and brush round the upper sides of the crust and the outer edges of the cover with egg; lay on the cover, pinch it round neatly, and ornament it according to fancy with leaves, festoons, or chains of rings made of the paste.

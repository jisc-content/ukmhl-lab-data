338 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. Rout Cakes. Rub into one pound of flour half a pound of fresh but- ter washed in rose water; of brown sifted loaf sugar, sweetmeats cut small, and well-cleaned cun-ants, a quar- ter of a pound each; mix all the ingredients with three well-beaten eggs, and add one or two table-spoonfuls of brandy. Drop it in rough knobs upon floured tins, and bake them in a quick oven. Rich Currant Cake. Have ready three pounds of dried and sifted flour, two pounds and a half of fresh butter, one pound of sift- ed loaf sugar, one pound of citron and lemon peel cut small, three quarters of a pound of blanched sweet al- monds cut into thin bits, and steeped in rose water, five pounds of well-cleaned currants, one nutmeg grated, half an ounce of pounded mace, the yolks of fifteen, and the whites of seven eggs, separately beaten, half a pint of fresh yeast, a pint and a half of cream, an eighth of a pint of orange-flower water; then mix the spice with the flour; melt the butter and cream together, and when cold, stir them into the flour; add the yeast to the beaten eggs, and strain them into the flour, then mix in the rest of the in- gredients, and beat them well together. Butter a cake- pan, line it with buttered paper, pour in the cake, and put it immediately into the oven. As soon as it rises, and is a little coloured, cover the top with paper. It will take nearly three hours to bake. Macaroons. Beat to a froth the whites of eight eggs, then add two pounds of finely-pounded and sifted loaf sugar, one pound of blanched sweet almonds, which must be pounded to a paste with rose water. Beat all these together till they become a thick paste, then drop it from a spoon upon wafer paper or tins, and bake them in a slow oven.

In removing the wine from the vat to the casks, it is requisite that the vat should be tapped at such a distance from the bottom, as to allow the wine to flow clear of the sediment which may have collected at the lower part of the vessel, by which means the scum may be easily prevented from running into the receiver. If the wine is not disengaged from the solid matters, straining will be further necessary. The skins are sometimes fermented with the juice in the vat, but they must in no case be introduced into the cask. To clarify the wine completely, prepared fining* may be used, in the proportion of a wine-glassful to every five gallons of liquor; also isinglass or whites of eggs ; half an ounce of isinglass, or nine eggs, is sufficient for fifty gal- lons of wine : whichever of these is employed, it is first diluted in a portion of the wine, and then strongly agi- tated with the whole. In about ten days, when the wine has become clear, it is again drawn oft'. Instead of the common method of sulphuring, the sulphate of potash is to be preferred, which may be used in the proportion of a drachm to a pipe of liquor, or the oxymuriate of potash, which is more easily procured. Dry, cold weather ought to be selected for racking. Various kinds of wine, not to be distinguished from those of foreign growth, can in this country be made from grapes, and at a moderate expense ; their being ripe is not a necessary circumstance; they may be used in any state, however immature, the quantity of sugar being propor- tionally increased. Where the vine is largely cultivated, the thinnings may be used, as various kinds of grapes, * Sold by James Edwards, Crutched Friars, London.

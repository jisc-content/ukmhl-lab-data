THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 60 To Boil Pike. Wash clean, and take out the gills ; stuff them with the following forcemeat: equal parts of chopped oysters, grated bread crumbs, beef suet, or butter, two anchovies, a little onion, pepper, salt, nutmeg, minced parsley, sweet marjoram, thyme, and savoury; an egg to bind it. Stuff the insides, and sew them up ; put them on in boiling salt-and-water, with a glass of vinegar, and let them boil for half an hour. Sauces;â€”oyster, and melted butter. They may also be broiled. Baked Pike. Scrape the scales off a large pike, take out the gills, and clean it, without breaking the skin ; stud' the fish with a forcemeat made of two handfuls of grated bread, one of finely-minced suet, some chopped parsley, and a little fresh .butter, seasoned with pepper, salt, mace, gra- ted lemon-peel and nutmeg, pounded all together in a mortar, with two whole eggs. Fasten the tail of the pike into its mouth with a skewer, and then dip it, first into a well-beaten egg, and then into grated bread, which repeat twice ; baste it over with butter, and bake it in an oven. If two of them are to be served, make one of them of a green colour, by mixing a quantity of finely-minced parsley with the grated bread. When the fish is of a fine brown colour, cover it with paper until it is done. Serve with a Dutch sauce in a sauce-tureen. Maids.

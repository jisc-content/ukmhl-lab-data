THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 400 CHAPTER XVIII. WINES. PREPARATORY REMARKS UPON DOMESTIC WINES. All wines are reducible to four general divisions of dry and strong; sweet; light and flavoured ; and brisk. When a dry wine is desired, the liquor is suffered to re- main in the vat for three, four, or more days, according to circumstances ; and a cask is provided for it sufficiently large to prevent the yeast from escaping at the bung- hole. To make a sweet wine, the fermentation must be discouraged by speedily removing it from the vat to the cask, which is carefully filled as the fluid subsides, and by frequent racking or sulphuring, or by both. To pro- duce a light flavoured wine, similar to burgundy, the fluid is allowed to remain from six to twenty hours in the vat; and, for wines to resemble champagne, it is necessary the juice should remain in the vat hut a few hours. Where small quantities are operated upon, the fermentation may be begun in the cask, the mask or mash being previously strained; for in no case should solid matter be introduced into the cask. The wine is strong- est when the fermentation has been partially carried on in close vessels ; and the flavour is also better preserved.

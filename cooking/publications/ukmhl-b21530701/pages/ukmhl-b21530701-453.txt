For a ten-gallon cask, fifty pounds of Malaga, and twenty-five of Smyrna raisins, ten pounds of loaf sugar, and a quarter of a pound of crude tartar are allowed. The raisins being separated from each other, and the strong stalks picked out, they are to be put, together with the other ingredients, into a vat, and thirteen gallons of cold spring water is to be poured over them ; the whole is then to be well stirred, and the vat covered ; it must be stirred twice a-day during the first fortnight, and afterwards once a-day. When the fermentation has become very strong, and the liquor acquires a vinous smell and taste, which may be in three or four weeks, it is to be prepared for the cask in the following manner:â€”A sieve or a drainer, such as is used for sowens in Scotland, is to be put over a tub ; in this the raisins are to be squeezed very hard with the hand ; all the liquor is then to be run through a hair sieve, and put into the cask, and the remainder into bottles, from which the cask must be filled up twice a-day for a week, then once a-day, and less frequently as the fermentation begins to decline ; when it is completed, the cask is to be bunged up, and allowed to stand for four months.

The raisins are then to be squeezed to dryness, and the liquor strained, put into a cask, and treated as wine from ripe currants. Orange Wine. For a ten-gallon cask, ninety bitter oranges are to be

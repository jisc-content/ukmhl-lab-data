THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 414 the boiled boney and water, and substituting two ounces of cloves for the coriander and the cardamom seeds. Simple Mead. One part of boney is dissolved in three parts of water, and boiled over a moderate fire till it is reduced to two- thirds of the quantity. It is then skimmed, and put into a barrel, which must be quite full; it is allowed to subside for three or four days, and then drawn off for use. To make it from the combs from which honey has been drained, they are to be beaten in warm water, and after the liquor has subsided, it is to be strained.

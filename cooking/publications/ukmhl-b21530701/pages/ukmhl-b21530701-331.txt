THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 2S7 Orange Soufflet. Mix with a table-spoonful of flour a pint of cream, put it into a sauce-pan, with two spoonfuls of rose water, a lit- tle cinnamon and orange-peel; stir it till it boil ; strain and sweeten it, and when cold, mix in two table-spoonfuls of orange marmalade ; beat well six eggs with a glass of brandy ; mix all together ; put it in a buttered shape ; place it in a sauce-pan of boiling water, over a stove ; let it boil one hour and a quarter without a cloth or cover over it. Omelet. Beat up eight eggs extremely well, strain and season them with pepper, salt, nutmeg, minced parsley, and sha- lot, some grated lean ham, and a little good gravy; fry it lightly in a quarter of a pound of butter; hold a sala- mander, or a hot shovel, over the top, to take off the raw appearance of the eggs; serve with a rich thick brown gravy, or without it if preferred dry. In frying the ome- let, raise it frequently as it begins to fasten, with a knife, from the bottom of the pan, so that the butter may get under it. Another way to make Omelet. Beat eight eggs till they are very light; add a tea- cupful of rich cream, two middling-sized onions pounded, and some boiled parsley minced, half a tea-spoonful of salt, and a little pepper ; mix all well together, and fry it of a light brown, in three or four ounces of butter; before serving, let it stand a few minutes before the fire. If onions are disliked, finely-minced sweet herbs may be substituted. Another way to make Omelet. Beard and parboil twelve or sixteen oysters, season- ing them with a few white peppercorns, strain and chop them ; beat ivell six eggs ; parboil and mince a little pars- ley ; mix all together, and season with a little nutmeg,

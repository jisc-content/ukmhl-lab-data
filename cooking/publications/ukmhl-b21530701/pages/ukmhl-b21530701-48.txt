Serve boiled rice to eat with this broth. Mullagatawny. Boil slowly in two quarts of water one pound of split peas, half an ounce of butter, two onions sliced, a little salt, cayenne, and two blades of mace. When the peas are tender, put in a large fowl, cut in joints and skinned, two quarts of boiling-water, or stock, if the soup be re- quired very rich; twenty minutes before serving, add a large table-spoonful of currie-powder, and the same of ground rice.

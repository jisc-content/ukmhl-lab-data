THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 55 to six large-sized fish, pound and mix well together one ounce of black pepper, three nutmegs, six blades of mace, and a handful of salt; rub each bit of fish extremely well with the spices, and fry them brown in oil; when they are cold, put them into a jar ; fill it up with the best vine- gar, and pour oil upon the surface; tie it down closely. They are best to be done in the height of the season, and will keep good a twelvemonth, if not opened too soon, and answer well for a winter or spring dish. To Fry Herrings. Scrape off the scales ; cut off the fins ; draw out the gut, keeping in the roes and milts ; wipe them in a clean cloth ; dredge them with flour, and fry them in boiling dripping ; put them before the fire to drain and keep hot. Sauces;â€”melted butter, and parsley and butter. When herrings are to be broiled, they are prepared in the same manner, and done upon the gridiron. They must not be washed. Red Herrings. Plain broil them, or pour over some beer made hot, and when it is cold drain and wipe them dry ; heat them thoroughly, and rub over a little butter, and sprinkle them with pepper. To Bake Herrings. They must be perfectly fresh, and well cleaned, but not washed ; the heads and fins cut off, and the bones cut out; strew over them pepper, salt, and a slice of onion minced very finely, to each ; roll them up tight; pack them into ajar, and pour over in the proportion of a pint of vine- gar to two of water, with half an ounce of whole black pepper ; tie over the jar a piece of bladder or paper, and bake them in an oven for an hour. Take off the cover when they are cold, and pour over a little cold vinegar, and tie them up.

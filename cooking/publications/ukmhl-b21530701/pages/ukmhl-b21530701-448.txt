THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY-. 401 successive proportions, by a pressure sufficient to burst the berries, without breaking the seeds, or materially com- pressing the skins. Four gallons of water are then to be poured into the vessel, and the contents are to be care- fully stirred, and squeezed in the hand, until the whole of the juice and pulp are separated from the seeds and skins; the materials are then to remain at rest from six to twenty-four hours, when they are to be strained through a coarse bag by as much force as can conveniently be applied to them; one gallon of fresh water may after- wards be passed through the mash. Thirty pounds of loaf sugar are now to be dissolved in the juice thus procured, and water added, to make the whole eleven gallons in quantity; this, together with three ounces of tartar in its crude state, being put into a tub, a blanket is thrown over it, which is again covered with a board, and the vessel placed in a temperature vary- ing from 55° to 60° of Fahrenheit; here it may remain for twenty-four hours, or two days, as the fermentation may be more or less rapid ; from this tub it is to be drawn off into tbe cask in which it is to ferment, and as the fer- mentation proceeds, the superfluous portion of juice made for the purpose, must be poured in, so as to keep the liquor still near the bung-hole for ten or twelve days, or until the fermentation becomes a. little languid, as may be known by the diminution of the hissing noise'; the bung is to be driven in, and a hole bored by its side, into which a wooden peg is to be fitted ; it may be loosened every two or three days, for the space of eight or ten days, to give the air vent, so as to prevent the cask from bursting. When there appears no longer any danger, the spike may be per- manently tightened. The wine thus made may remain over the winter in a cool cellar. If the operator is not inclined to bestow any farther labour or expense upon it, it may be exa- mined in some clear cold day towards the end of Fe- bruary or beginning of March, when, if fine, as it will sometimes be, it may be bottled without farther precau- tion. To insure its fineness, however, it is a better prac-

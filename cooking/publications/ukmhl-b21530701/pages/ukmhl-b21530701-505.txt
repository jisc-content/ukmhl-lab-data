THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 461 when perfectly cold, putting it upon the butter, about one and a half or two inches deep. If a wooden bung be put upon this, a bladder laid over it, and the jar kept in a dry place, the butter thus preserved will remain perfectly sweet for almost any length of time. The jar should be wider at the bottom than at the top, resembling the up- right churn, the top of it being sufficiently wide to admit of its being filled conveniently, but not wider. Another method of Preparing Butter. Mix one part of saltpetre, one of common salt, and two of sugar. This, thoroughly wrought into the butter, will keep it for a very long time, and communicates to it no salt nor disagreeable taste. Scotch method of Salting Butter. Wash the butter thoroughly in cold water, pressing it strongly and frequently with the hands or broad pieces of wood, and changing the water till it come off clear; then spread it out in thin layers, sprinkle it with salt, in the proportion of one ounce to every three pounds of but- ter, and work it well. In this manner each churning is prepared, till the quantity required to fill the kit is obtain- ed. Make a pickle of salt and water, strong enough to bear an egg, and boil with it two ounces of loaf sugar. Take each making separately, press all the watery brine from it, and work it in a little of the prepared pickle; if it should not come oft' clear, repeat the washing in fresh pickle. The kit having been well scoured, nibbed with dry salt, and rinsed out with a little of the pickle, pack into it separately each making of butter to within two inches of the top; put some pickle on it, and a clean linen rag; the head of the vessel is then put on, and should always be kept close upon it. Method of Preserving Butter with Honey. The butter being cleaned from the milk, it is put into jars, and melted on a stove, or in a water bath on the fire; just before it boils, it is put in a cool place to settle, and

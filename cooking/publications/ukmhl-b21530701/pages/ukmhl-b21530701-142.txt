L 98 THE PRACTICE OF COOKERY. The best end of a neck of mutton should be jointed, and roasted, the same as the loin; or it may be boiled.

Cut a neck of mutton into neat steaks ; put them in- to a sauce-pan, with sufficient water to cover them; add a 6mall bunch of sweet herbs, two or three onions, and some pepper. Let them boil two minutes; take them out, and stew the trimmings of the steaks with the herbs, till the gravy is sufficiently strong, then strain it, and take off all the fat. Ilub the steaks with a well-beaten yolk of an egg, and strew over them bread crumbs mix- , ed with finely chopped sweet herbs. Thicken the gravy with a little browned butter and flour, add a table-spoon- ful of vinegar, and when it is quite hot, pour it into the dish, and lay in the steaks. Mutton Cutlets.

PANADAS. 49 PANADAS. CHICKEN PANADA. One full-grown, tender chicken. Three pints of hot water. One teaspoonful of salt. Pepper or nutmeg. After the chicken has been well cleaned, and al- lowed to cool, put it (whole) into a kettle with the water and salt, and boil slowly until it is well done, but not so that it will drop to pieces. Take the chicken out of the broth and set both away for three or four hours to cool. Then remove the skin from the white meat, cut it up, put it into a mortar with two tablespoonfuls of the broth (free from fat), and pound it to a smooth paste. Add as much broth as will make it thin enough to drink as you would soup. Boil up once, season with a very little pepper or nutmeg, and strain through a fine sieve. Serve hot, Avith toast or unleavened wafers. Time required, about six hours. N. B.â€”Be careful to remove every particle of the fat from the broth before it is added to the paste. If desired richer, stir in two tablespoonfuls of cream; if it is too rich, dilute with boiling water.

109 CREAMS. ICE CREAM. One tablespoonful of Bermuda arrowroot Four tablespoonfuls of cold milk. Half a pint of sugar. One quart of boiling milk. One pint of rich cream. Six drops of any flavoring preferred. Blend the arrowroot with the cold milk, and strain it through a double piece of bobbinet. Dissolve the sugar in the boiling milk (which should be in a double kettle), and pour the arrow- root into it, stirring gently to prevent lumps. Simmer until it thickens, and turn it into a dish to cool. When cold, stir in the cream and flavoring. Freeze. Time required, about two hours. ICE CREAM. One pint of thick, sweet cream. Two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. Whip the cream to a stiff froth, stir in the sugar, a little at a time, and flavor if desired. Put it into a freezer, packed in ice and salt, just as vou would for other ice cream; do not stir it, but let it stand until frozen. If the weather is cold enough, it will freeze by leaving it out-of-doors.

CREAMS. 107 WHITE BAVARIAN CREAM. Half a box of Cox's gelatine. Five tablespoonfuls of cold water. One pint of fresh milk. One-fourth of a pint of sweet cream. Two tablespoonfuls of granulated sugar. The stiff-beaten whites of four eggs. Two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. One tablespoonful of brandy. Soak the gelatine in the cold water one hour, or until it is dissolved. Heat the milk and cream to the boiling point, add the granulated sugar, and stir until it is dissolved. Strain the gelatine through a piece of fine net into the milk, stir well, and set it aside to cool and harden. Beat the eggs to a stiff, dry froth, and whip in the powdered sugar and brandy. When the gelatine mixture is quite cold, and has begun to harden, stir it until it is perfectly smooth, then as lightly as possible whip the eggs into it. Turn the whole into a glass dish, and set it in the refrigerator to stiffen, which will take two hours. Serve very cold. Time required, about three hours and a half. N. B.â€”If this cream is desired soft like a custard, use one-third of a box of gelatine instead of half a box.

32 INVALID COOKERY. SCRAPED BEEFSTEAK. Scrape three or four tablespoonfuls of raw beef from a tender, juicy piece, and with a knife press it into an oval cake about three-quarters of an inch thick. Rub a little warm (not melted) butter over it and lay it on a very hot frying-pan; when sufficiently cooked on both sides, season daintily with butter, pepper and salt. Serve between hot plates. Time required for cooking, about three minutes. BROILED MUTTON CHOP. Remove all skin and fat from a loin chop about three-quarters of an inch thick. Place it on a heated broiler over a bright, clear fire, and turn it frequently while cooking. When sufficiently done on both sides, remove it from the broiler to a hot plate, and season with salt,, and, if allowed, a little butter and pepper. Serve between hot plates. Time required, about six minutes. BROILED SWEETBREADS. Select a fine, large pair of sweetbreads, remove every particle of shin and fat from them, and let them lie in cold water one hour to whiten.

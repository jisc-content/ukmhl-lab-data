56 INVALID COOKERY. Put the coffee, cold water, and egg into the coffee- pot, and stir well. Pour in the boiling water, simmer slowly two min- utes, then stir down the grounds. Let it stand where it will keep very hot (but not boil), five minutes longer. Strain, and serve hot with cream and sugar; if too strong, dilute with boiling milk or water. Time required, not over ten minutes. COFFEE AND EGG-. One large tablespoonful of ground coffee. One-fourth of an egg. One-fourth of a pint of boiling water. One-fourth of a pint of fresh milk. Four teaspoonfuls of sugar. One whole egg. Two tablespoonfuls of hot cream. Put the first four ingredients into a small coffee- pot, and boil five minutes. Beat the sugar and egg together until stiff and light, and strain the boiling coffee into it, stirring all the while to prevent curdling. Acid the cream, and serve either hot or cold, though it is more palatable when taken hot. Time required, about ten minutes. N.

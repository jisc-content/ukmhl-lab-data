105 JELLIES. Soak the gelatine in the cold water one hour, pom- it into a saucepan with the boiling water and sugar, and stir until both gelatine and sugar are dissolved. Then add the wine, lemon, egg, nutmeg, and cinna- mon, and boil briskly half a minute. Remove from the fire, and let it stand half a min- ute, then skim, and strain through a flannel jelly-bag into a mould. The mould should be wet in cold water before straining the jelly into it. Place it on ice to harden. If required in haste, use a shallow dish instead of a mould to cool it in. Time required, five or six hours. JELLIED WINE. One tablespoonful of gelatine. Two tablespoonfuls of cold water. Two tablespoonfuls of sugar. One-fourth of a pint of wine. Dissolve the gelatine in the water by slowly heat- ing it, stirring at the same time.

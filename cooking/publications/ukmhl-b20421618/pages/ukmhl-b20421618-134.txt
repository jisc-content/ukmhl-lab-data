124 INVALID COOKERY. in the afternoon ; their presence interferes with the routine duties of the nurse, fatigues the already weary- patient, who, unconscious of the cause, becomes nervous and restless; and the result is often the loss of sleep which otherwise might have been obtained. Extra care should be taken not to disturb the sleep or rest of a sick person. Always remember the sick-room should be kept quiet. Much suffering would be avoided if thoughtless friends would heed these admonitions. When making up a bed for a patient that is feeble and unable to help himself, take two sheets and fold them twice, lengthwise; lay them across the bed â€” one under the hips, the other under the shoulders; by taking firm hold of the ends of the sheets on one side of the bed, and gently drawing toward you, it will be easy to move the patient from one side to the other. To twrn the patient, slightly lift the sheets as you draw them. A little practice will soon enable the attendant to change the position of the patient with ease and com- fort. If possible, change the bed linen daily, and air the blankets and other bedding as often, but not in the room with the patient. Avoid drafts of air on the patient, and do not let him sit up long enough to become wearied. An extra bed in the room, to which he can be moved daily, will be a grateful and salutary change, and will allow time to make up and air the bed.

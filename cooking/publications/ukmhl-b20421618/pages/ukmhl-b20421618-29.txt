SOUPS. 19 SOUPS. STOCK FOR SOUP. Two pounds of the shin of beef. Two pounds of round or shoulder steak. Two quarts of cold water. Two teaspoonfuls of salt. Wash the meat, put it into a soup-kettle with the cold water and salt, bring slowly to a boil, and skim. Then let it simmer until the meat is ready to drop to pieces, strain, and set the stock aside to cool; when cold, remove all fat and dregs. This should be kept in a cold place, but not where it will freeze, and used, when required, for the founda- tion of soups. Time required for cooking, about six hours. MACARONI SOUP. Half a stick of macaroni. One-fourth of a pint of cold water. One pint of boiling stock. A light shake of black pepper. Soak the macaroni in the water ten minutes, and simmer in the same thirty minutes. Then cut it into small pieces and drop them into the boiling stock.

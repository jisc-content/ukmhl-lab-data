INVALID COOKERY. 108 GOLDEN BAVARIAN CREAM. Half a box of Cox's gelatine. Five tablespoonfnls of cold water. One pint of fresh milk. One-fourth of a pint of sweet cream. Two tablespoonfnls of granulated sugar. The stiff-beaten whites of four eggs. Two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. Eight drops of any essence preferred. The yolks of two eggs. Soak the gelatine in the cold water one hour, or until it is dissolved. Heat the milk to the boiling point, add the granu- lated sugar and stir until it is dissolved. Strain the gelatine through a piece of fine net into the milk, stir well, and set it aside to cool and stiffen. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff, dry froth, and whip in the powdered sugar and flavoring. When the gelatine mixture is quite cold, and has begun to harden, beat it until it is perfectly smooth, then stir in the yolks of the two eggs which have been beaten until very light. Lastly, whip in the whites of the eggs. Turn the whole into a glass dish, and set it in the refrigerator to cool and harden, which will take two hours. Time required, about three hours and a half.

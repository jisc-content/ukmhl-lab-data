SUGGESTIONS FOR THE SICK-ROOM. 125 It is a great convenience, and almost a necessity, to have two or three small pillows to place under the knees and other parts of the body, as rests or props to relieve the strain upon the enfeebled muscles. Do not sit or lie down on the bed; for no matter how quiet you may be, it is thoughtless to subject a sick person to anything that may annoy. Chloride of lime is a good disinfectant and great purifier. One pound of chloride of lime requires three gallons of water. Put the solution in earthen vessels and place them in different parts of the room. A solution of carbolic acid can be used in the same manner, or saturate cloths with it and pin them to articles of furniture in the room. Phenol sodique, as a disinfectant, is prompt and reliable, and highly recommended by physicians. It can be procured at any drug-store, with labeled in- structions for use. Dissolve copperas, and put a small quantity in the vessels used, to prevent unpleasant odors. A stool-chair for the convenience of the patient is a positive necessity, and all matters discharged should be removed immediately, in the same vessel, from the room. To wring flannels out of hot water, fold the cloths the desired size; place them in the center of a small towel, and dip it in the hot water, keeping the ends of the towel dry to handle. By using the towel as a wringer, the cloths will be much hotter than if wrung with the naked hands.

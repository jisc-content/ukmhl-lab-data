46 INVALID COOKERY. UNLEAVENED WAFERS. One quart of sifted flour. Half a pint of cold water. One teaspoonful of salt. Mix the ingredients well together, roll out thin, and cut into small cakes with a biscuit-cutter. Then roll the cakes as thin as possible, lay them in a pan that has been dredged with flour, and bake in a brisk oven. Time required, about half an hour. DRY TOAST. Toast should be made of very light bread, at least twenty-four hours old. Cut the bread into slices about three-quarters of an inch thick, and toast slowly over a clear fire â€” turning frequently, that it may heat through before it begins to brown. When a delicate brown on both sides, cut the crust edges off, or break them down with the handle of a knife, and butter sparingly. Serve as hot as possible. WATER TOAST. One slice of very light bread, not too fresh. A piece of butter the size of a chestnut. Half a saltspoonful of salt. Five tablespoonfuls of boiling water.

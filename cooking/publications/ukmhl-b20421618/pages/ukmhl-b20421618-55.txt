45 BREADS. Stir all the ingredients well together, and let it stand one minute. Sprinkle a little meal on a hot griddle, and as soon as it browns, mould the dough with the hauds into a smooth, round ball; lay it on the griddle, and pat it down until it is about half an inch thick. Brown quickly on one side (be careful not to burn it), and turn it before the upper side becomes dry: bake slowly until the cake is done through, and brown on both sides. Time required, about half an hour. DELICATE MUFFINS. One egg. Half a pint of flour. One saltspoonful of salt. Half a pint of milk. Beat the egg (yolk and white together) until very light. Blend the flour and salt well with the milk, and stir it into the egg. Pour the batter into hot, well-buttered muffin-tins, or (what is better) gem-irons, only half filling them; bake in a quick oven. Time required for baking, about half an hour.

Beat the egg and sugar together until very light, and pour the spiced water onto it, stirring briskly until well blended. Simmer until it begins to thicken, then add the brandy, and pour the caudle from one glass to another two or three times, to make it foamy and light. Serve either hot or cold. Time required, about fifteen minutes. N. B.â€”This is very nice without the brandy, which, if not desired, can be left out. ORANGE CAUDLE. One tablespoonful of Cox's gelatine. Two tablesjDoonfuls of hot water. One pint of new milk, boiling hot. One teaspoonful of sugar. Two tablespoonfuls of orange juice. Dissolve the gelatine in the hot water, and pour it into the boiling milk. Simmer slowly two or three minutes, and remove from the fire.

i BROILS. OA about tne consistency of cream, and pour it into the boiling broth. Simmer one minute; add the cream, pepper and oysters, and boil up once. Serve immediately, with oyster crackers. Time required, about ten minutes. BROILS. BROILED BEEFSTEAK. Select a tender, juicy piece of beef, about an inch thick (a cut from the tenderloin if possible), also a cut of the same size from the round. Place both on a heated broiler over a bright, clear fire (of charcoal if convenient), and as soon as the steak is seared on one side, turn and sear the other to 'prevent the escape of juice. Turn several times while cooking, and when sufficiently done, remove the tenderloin from the broiler to a hot plate and season with salt, butter and pepper. Sprinkle a little salt over the other piece of steak, and with a meat or lemon squeezer press all the juice from it over the tenderloin. Cover with a hot plate and serve immediately. Time required, six or seven minutes.

36 INVALID COOKERY. BROILED FISH. After the fish has been thoroughly cleaned, washed, and wiped dry, split, and lay it in a folding boiler over a clear, bright fire. Turn frequently while cooking. When well done (not dry), and a delicate brown on both sides, season sparingly with butter, salt and pepper. Serve between hot plates. Time required, about twenty minutes for a two-pound fish. N. B.—Broiling is the best mode of cooking brook trout, whitefish or shad. Do not attempt to broil a fish unless it is perfectly fresh. BROILED OYSTERS. Select large, fat oysters, wash, and wipe dry. Place them in the folds of a clean towel, and pat gently with the hands to plump them. Season with salt and a little pepper. Heat and butter the wires of a folding broiler—one with the wires close together,— and place the oysters in it over a very hot fire. Broil quickly, and, when just cooked through, lay them on slightly buttered and moistened toast, which should be ready before you begin to cook the oysters. Serve between hot plates. Time required for broiling, two or three minutes.

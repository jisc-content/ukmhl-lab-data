23 SOUPS. CHICKEN SOUP. One pint of chicken broth. Two tablespoonfuls of cooked rice. One-fourth of a teaspoonful of chopped parsley. A light shake of black pepper. Put all the ingredients into a stew-pan and simmer together twenty minutes. Serve hot, with dry toast or unleavened wafers. Time required, about twenty minutes. OYSTER SOUP. One pint of oysters. Half a pint of cold water. Half a teaspoonful of salt. One teaspoonful of butter. One teaspoonful of cracker flour. Three tablespoonfuls of cream. A shake of black pepper. Six fine, whole oysters. Cut the pint of oysters into small pieces, put them into a stew-pan with the water and salt, and simmer ten or fifteen minutes; skim well and strain. Rub the butter and cracker flour to a smooth paste; blend enough of the broth with it to make it the con- sistency of cream, and pour it into the boiling broth.

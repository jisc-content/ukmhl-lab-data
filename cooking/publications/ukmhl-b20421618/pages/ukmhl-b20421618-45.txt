35 BROILS. BROILED SQUABS. When the squabs (young pigeons) are about one month old, they are in their prime for broiling, and are considered a very delicate dish. They should be prepared and broiled the same as quail. Time required, about twenty minutes. BROILED BIRDS. When preparing small birds for broiling, never skin them, or even break the skin if it can be avoided. After they have been carefully cleaned, and wiped dry, rub a little warm butter over each, and broil them over a bright, but not too brisk, fire, turning frequently while cooking. Season with butter, pepper and salt. Serve on thin slices of slightly buttered toast. Time required, ten or fifteen minutes. Plover, reed-birds and snipe are especially tempting to the palate of the invalid. BROILED SQUIRREL. Select a young, tender squirrel; in cleaning it, great care should be taken to prevent any of the fur from remaining on the meat. When thoroughly cleaned, and wiped dry, broil in the same manner as quail. Time required for a young squirrel, about twenty mmutes.

INVALID COOKERY. 86 Put the oats into a bowl, stir the water into it, and let it soak one hour. Then rub and squeeze with the hands until all the flour which adheres to the grain is washed off. Strain through a fine sieve, pressing and squeezing until the oats seem quite dry. Put the starchy-looking water thus obtained into a double kettle, add the salt, and cook until the flum- mery looks clear, stirring occasionally to prevent lumps. Serve with cream and sugar. Time required, about an hour and a half. N. B.â€”If in haste, the soaking may be omitted. Flummery made from this preparation of oats is entirely free from the bitter taste which is so objec- tionable in the common oatmeal. OATMEAL FLUMMERY NO. 2. One quart of medium oatmeal. One quart of tepid water. One quart of boiling water. One teaspoonful of salt. Put the oatmeal into a large bowl, pour two gallons of cold water over it, stir well, and let it stand over night. In the morning drain off the water as long as it looks clear; add to the meal two gallons of fresh water, stir well, and strain it through a wire sieve into a broad pan.

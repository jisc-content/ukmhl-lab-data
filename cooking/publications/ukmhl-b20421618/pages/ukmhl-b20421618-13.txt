PREFACE. This work has been compiled with a desire to contribute as far as possible to the comfort and pleasure of suffering invalids, and to aid those on whom devolves the sacred obligation of ministering to their wants. The preparation of nourishing food for the sick is an art in which few persons are skilled, and it has been the endeavor of the author to supply a long- felt necessity by giving a varied assortment of tested recipes for plain, digestible, nutritious diet, all of which have been submitted to, and approved by, physicians of high authority, to whom I am indebted for books, valuable advice, and encouragement. Great care has been taken to make it of practical value to the most inexperienced in culinary matters. The Author.

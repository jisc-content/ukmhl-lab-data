Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon till well mixed, then add the remainder of the flour, and when that is well worked in, put it on the bread- board and knead twenty minutes, using only enough extra flour to keep from sticking. Mould into four loaves, rub a little melted lard over each, and put them into buttered pans, which they should only half fill; set them in a warm place to rise, and when the bread puffs a little over the tops of the pans, place them carefully in the oven and bake until thoroughly done.

If kneaded and raised twice, it will be much finer grain; and if three times, will be very light and nice for toast. BEEF-TEA BREAD. Two quarts of sifted flour. Half a pint of bran water. Half a pint of hot beef tea. Half a teaspoonful of salt. A piece of compressed yeast three-quarters of an inch square. Four tablespoonfuls of cold water.

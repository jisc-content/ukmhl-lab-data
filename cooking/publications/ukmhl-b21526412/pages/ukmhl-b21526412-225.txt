•2 1 VEGETABLES. Potatoes fried Ti'hoh.—(No. lOo.) When nearly boiled enough as per tlie first receipt, put them i)ito a stewpan with a bit ol' butter, or some nice clean beef drippings ; shake them about often (for fear of burning them,) till they are of a fine brown, and cri.sp; drain them well from the fat. It will be an elegant improvement, to the three last receipts, previous to frying or broiling the potatoes, to flour them, and then to dip them in the yolk of an egg, and then roll them in fine sifted bread crumbs, and you mav then call them potatoes full dressed. Vb mash Potatoes. — (No. 106.) See also, (No. I 1<2.) When your potatoes are boiled, drain and dry them perfectly, and rub them through a cullender, into a clean stew])an; to a pound of pf)tatoes put about half an ounce of butter, and a large tablespoonful of milk ; mix them well together, and put them by the. side of the fire to keep warm ; if you put them too near they will get a bad taste. Obs. — After Lady-day, when the potatoes ar(' getting old and spccky, this is the best wav of dressing them.

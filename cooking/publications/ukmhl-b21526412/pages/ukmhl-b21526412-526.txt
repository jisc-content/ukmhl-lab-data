GRAVIES AND SAUCES. 516 To clean Plate. First. Take care that your plate is quite free from grease. Second. Take some whitening mixed with water, and a sponge, rub it well on the plate, which will take all the tarnish off; if it is very bad, repeat the whitening and water several times, making use of a brush, not too hard, to clean the intricate parts. Third. Take some rouge powder, mix it with water to about the thickness of cream, and with a small piece of leather, (which should be kept for that purpose only) apply the rouge, which, with the addition of a little “ Elbow Grease,” will in a short time produce a most beautiful polish. P. S. The Rouge Powder may be had at all Silversmiths and Jewellers. Obs.—The above is the actual manner in which silversmiths clean their plate, and was given to us by a respectable tradesman.

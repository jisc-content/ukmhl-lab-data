BROTHS, GRAVIES, AND SOUPS. 31fi Soup and Bouilli. â€” (No. 238.) The best parts for this purpose, are either the shin, or a piece of the middle of brisket of beef, about seven or eight pounds weight; bind it round with a fillet of tape, to prevent its coming to pieces when you take it up : put a slice under it, which will enable you to put it on the dish entire; put it into a soup-pot or deep stewpan with cold water enough to cover it, and a quart over, set it on a quick fire to get the scum up, which remove as it rises; then put in two carrots, two turnips, two leeks, two heads of celery, a large onion with two cloves sticking in it, and a faggot of parsley and thyme, set your pot by the side of the fire to simmer very gently, till the meat is just tender enough to eat; this will require about five or six hours. Put a large carrot, a turnip, a large onion, and a head or two of celery into the soup whole, but take them out as soon as they are done enough, lay them on a dish till they are cold, then cut them into small squares ; when the beef is done, take it out carefully, and strain the soup through a h'lir sieve into a clean stewpan, take oli all the fat, put the vegetables that are cut into tlie soup, the flavour of which you may heighten.

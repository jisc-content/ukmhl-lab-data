(iRAVIES AXD SAUCES. 405 i Woodcock Sauce*. — (No. 339 ) When the Cocks are roasted, take out tlie guts and livers, bruise them to a mash with a spoon, press it through your sieve, and sprinkle on them a little pepper and salt, add two large spoonsful of good gravy, and a small piece of butter rolled in flour; boil up together. Pour it into a hot dish, cut up the woodcocks in it, and send them to table. Snipe Sauce.—(No. 340.) The snipe in a great measure owes its sauce to itself, and there is a way of making it very fine. It is usual to roast these birds without drawing; when they are done enough take them off the spit, and take out the entrails and the liver, chop them upon a trencher: set on a small saucepan, with some veal gravy and red wine, seasoned with a little pepper and salt; put in the entrails and the liver, mash them well together, and squeeze in the juice of an orange; thicken your sauce with a little flour, and give it a boil, and skim it and strain it. • See (No. 76.)

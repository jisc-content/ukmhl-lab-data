RUDIMENTS OF COOKERY CHAPTER HI. FRYING. Fr YiNG is often a convenient mode of cookery, as it may be performed on a fire which will not do for roasting or broiling; and by the intro- duction of the pan between the meat and the fire, things get more equally dressed. The Dutch Oven is another very convenient utensil for small things, and a very useful substitute for the jack, the gridiron, or fryingpan. A frying- pan should be about two inches and a half deep, with perpendicular sides, and the articles should float in the hot fat, carefully keeping them from the sides. Be very particular, in frying, never to use any oil, butter, lard, or drippings, but what is quite clean, fresh, and free from salt. Any thing dirty spoils the look; any thing bad tasted or stale spoils the flavour; and salt pre- vents its taking a browning. Fine Olive oil.

370 GRAVIES AND SAUCES. Tomuta, or Love-apple Sauce. — (No. 2Q2.) See also (No. 443.) Have 12 or 15 tomatas very ripe and very red; take off the stalk; cut them in half; squeeze them just enough to get all the water and seeds out; put them in a quart stewpan, with a capsicum, and two or three table- spoonsful of beef gravy ; set them on a slow stove for an hour, or till properly melted; then rub them through a tammis into a clean stew- pan with a little white pepper and salt, and let them simmer together a few minutes. To PRESERVE TOMATAS. — Choose them quite ripe ; put them into an earthen jar, and bake them till they are tender, pulp them through a hair sieve, and to each pound add a quarter ounce of ground white pepper, two drachms of mace, one ounce of minced shallots, and three ounces of glaze, or portable soup; boil the whole together till every ingredient is tender; rub through a hair sieve, and boil the whole together again till it is the thickness of good Cream ; put it into half-pint preserving pots or bottles; take care they are closely corked ; when once opened, the air soon spoils it: it should be kept in a cool dry place.

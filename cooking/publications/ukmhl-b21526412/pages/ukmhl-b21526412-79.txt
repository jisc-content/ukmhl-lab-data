When the joint to be roasted, is thicker at one end than the other, place the spit slanting, so that the thickest part is nearest the fire, and the thinnest preserved from being i overmuch roasted. Take care not to put your meat too near the fire; the larger the joint, the farther it must be kept from the fire‘s ; if once it gets scorched, the outside will become hard, (and acquire a dis- agreeable empyrheumatic taste,) and the fire being prevented from penetrating into it, the meat will ; appear enough, before it is little more than half | done, besides losing the pale brown colour, which it is the greatest Beauty of Roast meat to have. ‘ ‘I * From 14 to 10 inches is the usual distance at which 4 meat is put from the grate, vvlien first put down ; ^ it is extremely difficult, to offer any thing, like an accurate general rule for this, as it depends so mncli upon the size of the lire, and of that of the tiling to be roasted. Till some Culinary riiilosopher shall invent a thermometer to ascertain the degree of heat of the * fire, and a graduated spit rack to regulate the distam e * from it, the process of roasting is attended by so many ever-varying circumstances, that it must remain among those which can only be performed well, by . very frequent practice and attentive observation. .

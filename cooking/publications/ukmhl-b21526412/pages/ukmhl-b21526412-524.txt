GUAVIES AND SAUCES. ol4 Slirab. — (No. 479.) A quart of bi'andy, the filtered juice of two Seville oranges, and the peel pared very thin and steeped for three days, a quarter pound of lump sugar then added to it, and then strained through flannel, produces this very palatable but seductive liquor, incomparably more tempt- ing and insinuating than any of the simple spirits, because, in combination with swat in- gredients, it imperceptibly stimulates, and gra- dually impairs the digestive organs. Obs.—The addition of a quart of Sherry or Madeira makes this “ Punch Royal if, instead of wine, the above quantity of water be added, it will make “ Punch I'OR Ciiambek- MAiDs,” according to Salmon’s Cookery, 8vo. London, 1710 ; see page 405. Mock Arrack. — (No. 480.) Dissolve two scruples of flowers of Benjamin in a quart of good Rum, and it will give it the flavour ol the linest Arrack.

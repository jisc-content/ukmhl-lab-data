490 GRAVIES AND SAUCES. Dr. Kitchiner’s Curry Powder. (No, 455.) Dry and reduce the following spices, &c. to a fine powder, in the same way as in the fore- going receipt. Coriander seed, three ounces. Turmeric, three ounces. Black pepper, one ounce. Ginger, one ounce. Lesser Cardamoms, one ounce. Cayenne pepper, quarter of an ounce. Cinnamon, quarter of an ounce. Cummin seed, the same. Mix together, and keep them in a ivell-stopped bottle. Obs.—The first of these receipts was given me by a friend ; as I have not tried it, I cannot vouch for its being the actual ingredients of Avhat is sold as the Indian composition. This last receipt, was an attempt to imitate some of the Best Real India Curry Powder, selected for me, by a friend at the India House; the flavour approximates to the Indian Powder so exactly, the most profound Palatkians, have pronounced it a perfect copy of the original Curry stuff. See (No. 348,) for Curry Sauce.

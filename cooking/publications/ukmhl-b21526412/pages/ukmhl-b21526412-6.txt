“ The main business of my book is to increase the comforts of moderate Families and moderate Fortunes, and I have taken as much pains to bring the Enjoyments and Indulgencies of the most Opulent, within reach of the middle ranks of Society, as I have in directing the pre- paration of those elaborate made dishes, and piqtiante relishes, the most ingenious and ac- complished ‘ Officers of the Mouth’ have in- vented for the amusement of profound Palaticians, and thorough bred Grands Gourmands of the first magnitude. These are so composed as to be as agreeable and useful to the stomach, as they are inviting to the appetite; nourishing without being inflammatory, and savoury without being surfeiting, endeavouring to hold the balance even, between the agreeable and the wholesome, and the Epicure and the Economist.” Vide Rudiments of Cookery, page 120.

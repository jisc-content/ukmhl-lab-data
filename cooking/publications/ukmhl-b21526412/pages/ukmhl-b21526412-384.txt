GRAVIES AND SAUCES, 374 White Onion Sauce. — (No. 298.)^ The following is a more delicate preparation ; —Take half a dozen of the largest and whitest Onions, (the Spanish are the mildest, but these can only be had from August to December,) peel them, and cut them into thin slices, and boil them in a pint of milk, and a pint of water; when they are tender, which will sometimes take an hour (the quicker they are boiled, the whiter they will be,) drain them well on a hair sieve, and put them into a clean saucepan, with an ounce of butter, a tablespoonful of flour, half a teaspoonful of salt, and two tablespoonsful of cream, or good milk; stir it till it boils; then rub the whole through a tammy, adding cream or milk to make it the consistence you wish to have it. Obs. — This is the usual sauce for boiled rabbits or ducks: they are laid dry in the dish, and this sauce is poured over them. There must be plenty of it; tlie usual expression signifles as much, tor wc say, smother them.

ADVICE TO COOKS‘S. N. B. Read the preceding Pixface before you read the following Address. On your first coming into a family, lose no time in immediately getting into the good graces of your fellow-servants, that you may learn from tliem the customs of the kitchen, and the various rules and orders of the house; especially, take care, to be on good terms with the servant who waits at table; you will then hear how your work has pleased in the parlour, and be enabled to rectify any mistake: and request the favour of an interview with your master or mistress, that you may depend as little as possible, on second-hand opinions: if you are a good Cook, * A Chapter of Advice to Cooks, will, we hope, be found as useful as it is original: all we have on this subject in the works of our predecessors, is the follow- ing : “ I shall strongly recoinineud to all Cooks of either sex, to keep their stomachs free from strong liquors, and their noses from snuft'.”—Vide Clermont’s Prqfessed Cook, page 30, 8vo. London, 1776.

392 GRAVIES AND SAUCES. Gravy for Roast Meat. — (No. 3'i6.) Most joints will afford sufficient trimmings, &c. to make half a pint of plain Gravy; and for those that do not, about half an hour before you think the meat will be done, mix a teaspoonful of salt with a full quarter pint of boiling water; and drop this by degrees on the brown parts of the joint; set a dish under to catch it, (the meat will soon brown again,) set it by, as it cools the fat will settle on the surface; when the meat is ready, remove this, and warm up the gravy, and pour it into the dish. N.B. If any gravy comes down in the dish, the Cook (if she is a good housewife) will pre- serve it to enrich the hash. Obs. — Some culinary professors, who think nothing can be excellent,^ that is not extrava- gant, call this “ Scots gravy;” not, I believe, intending it, as it certainly- is, a compliment to the laudable and rational frugality, of that intelligent and sober-minded people. N.B. Apicius has this gravy brought to table in a sauce-boat, and preserves the intrinsic gravy that flows from the meat, in the Argyll.

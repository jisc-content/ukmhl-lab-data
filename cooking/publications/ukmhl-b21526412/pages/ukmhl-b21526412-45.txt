PREFACE. (Inulgery, attending an apprenticeship at the stove; an ordeal so severe, that lew pass it without irreparal)lc injury to their liealtli*; and many, lose their lives, l^etbre tliey learn their business. A good dinner is one of the greatest enjoy- ments of human life ; but the practice of cook- ery is attended with not only so many disgusting and disagreeable eircnmstances, and even dan- gers, that we ought to have some regard for those who encounter them for o\ir pleasure, and WT, ought to reward tlieir attention, l)y render- ing their situation every way as agreeable and comfortable as we can, for mere money is not a sufficient compensation to a complete Cook. * “ Piiiy it, with hcaltli, strength, and resolution, Ami i>ay for it, a lohiist eonstitntion.'’ Sec the preface to “ The Cook's Cuiiku-:j,'' page 9. This work, wliieh is very scarce, was, we believe, written to (levelopc the niistake.s in what he calls “ the Thousand Error.s,” i. e. “ The Lady's i.’ookery,'' i. e. IMrs. tllassr’s, i. e. Sir John Hill’s. “ Cleanliness, and a proper ventilation to carry off .smoke and steam, should he particularly attended to in the construction of a kitchen; and the grand scene of action, the fire-place, .should be placed where it may receive plenty of light: hitherto the contrary has pre- vailed, and the poor Cook is continually hasted with her own perspiration.”—A.

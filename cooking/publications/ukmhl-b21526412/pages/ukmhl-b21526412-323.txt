BROTHS, GRAVIES, AND SOUPS. 313 ISluccnroui Soup, the new zcup.—(No. 234.) This is called, in the French kitchen, “ Potage a la Camtrani,” the erudite gourmand who in- vented it. Prepare your maccaroni and broth as in the last receipt; mince fine all the vegetables that have been boiled in the broth, with two dozen of fowls’ livers that have been parboiled; mix and chop small these with the vegetables, and lay a bed of these ingredients between the maccaroni and the cheese, of which yon will want a pound. Thin is one of the lust produclions, and the reigning favourite of the French kitchen, xchcre the desire for noveltij is insatiable, and folios might i be filed with their innumerable receipts for soups.

Take two or three flounders, eels, eudo-eons &c. and set them on to boil in a gallon of cold water ; when it is pretty nigh upon boiling, scum it well, and put in a couple of onions, and as many carrots cut to pieces, and some parsley.

IlOASTl .N G. 1R9 IS almost roasted enoug'li, put a cjuarter of a pound of butter into your basting-ladle, and baste it with this, and flour it, and froth it nicely. Serve with good gravy, see (No. 329,) or (No. 347,) and currant-jelly. P'or another Stuffing, see receipt (No. 379.) Some Cooks cut oft’ the head, and divide it, and lay one half on each side of the hare. Obs.— Hares should be paunched in the field when caught, or as soon as they are brought home; make an incision in the belly, about four inches long, then lay hold of the head and ears with one hand, and the rump with the other, shaking it for a little while backwards and for- wards, and the guts and stomach will fall out, leaving the heart, kidneys, and liver behind; wipe it, &c. as we have directed in the begin- ning of this receipt, and put in a wisp of dry straw, or hay, and sew it up; it will then keep as long again. Cold roast hare will make an excellent Soup, see (No. 241,) chopped to pieces, and stewed in three quarts of water for a couple of hours; the stuffing will be a very agreeable substitute, for sweet herbs and seasoning.

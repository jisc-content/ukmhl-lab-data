ROASTING. 178 place the liver under one wing, and the giz.- zard under the other, baste it with butter, and dredge it with flour, keep it at a distance from the fire for the last half hour, that it may warm gradually, then put it nearer, and when it is plumped up, and the steam draAvs in to- ward the fire, it is nearly enough; now take off the paper., put a bit of butter into your basting ladle, and as it melts, baste the turkey with it, and dredge it lightly again Avith flour; this, will raise a much finer froth, than using the drippings out of the pan. A very large Turkey, of fourteen or fifteen pounds Aveight, will require three hours, to roast it thoroughly; a middling sized one, of eight or ten pounds, about two hours; a small one, may be done in an hour and a half. Fried pork sausages, see (No. 87) are a very savoury and relishing accompaniment, to either roasted or boiled poultry. A Turkey, thus garnished, is called “ an Alderman in Chains.” Sausage meat is sometimes used as stuffing, instead of the ordinai'y forcemeat. In cold weather, a turkey eats the better, for being kept eight or ten days. If you Avish it to be tender, never dress it till at least four or five days after it has been killed, or a foAvl till after three. Hen turkeys are preferable to Cocks,

MADE DISHES, &C. 589 Dr. Cullen’s Receipt to make Water Gruel. (No. 571.) The following is the most agreeable manner of making water gruel. One ounce of oatmeal is sufficient to make two quarts of water gruel. Put the oatmeal into three quarts of soft cold water, and set it over the fire. It must be constantly stirred till it boils; then let it boil till a third part of the water is boiled away; then pour it through a linen cloth into a bowl a little larger than sufficient to contain it. In this bowl leave it to cool; when it will be found separated into two parts, one of them a mealy cloud or sediment, and the other a very thin and clear liquor. The latter is to be carefully decanted, or poured off for use. To render tnis more agreeable by the addition of sugar, acids, or aromatics, or to impregnate it with medicinal substances, I leave to the judgment of the nurse or physician. See Cullen’s Mat.

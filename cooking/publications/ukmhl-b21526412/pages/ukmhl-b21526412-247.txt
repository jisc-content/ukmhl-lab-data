The best way to ascertain the heat of the fat, is to try it with a bit of bread as bigas a nut; and if it is quite hot enough, the bread will brown immediately. Put in the fish, and it will be crisp and brown on the side ne.xt the fire, in about four or five minutes; to turn it, slick a two-pronged fork near the head, and support the tail with a fish- slice, and fry the other side: one sole is enough to put in at a time, except the pan is very large, and you have plenty of fat.

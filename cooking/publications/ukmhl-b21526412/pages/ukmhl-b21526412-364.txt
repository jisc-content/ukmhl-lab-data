GRAVIES AND SAUCES. 354 Farshy and Butter. — (No. 26l.) Wash some parsley very clean, pick it care- fully leaf by leaf, and put a teaspoonful of salt into half a pint of boiling water, and boil the parsley two or three minutes, drain it on a sieve, and mince it quite fine, and then bruise it to a pulp. The delicacy and excellence of this elegant and innocent Relish depends upon the parsley being minced very very fine ; put it into a sauce boat, and mix with it by degrees about half a pint of good melted butter, (No. 256,) only do not put so much flour to it, as the parsley will add to its thickness. Obs.—This, with the addition of the juice of half a lemon, is in Foreign Cookery books generally called “ Dutch Sauce.” Mock Parsley Sauce. — (No. 262.) If you cannot get any parsley, you may easily communicate the flavour of it to your sauce, by tying up half a drachm of parsley seed in a piece of clean muslin, and boiling it for ten minutes in five tablespoonsful of water; use this water to melt your butter with; this will impose on the Palate; to cheat the Eye, parboil a little spinage, and chop it fine, and stir it into melted butter.

PREFACE. xl mere receipts to those who have never shook hands with a stewpan, nor had any opportunity of seeing; the work performed. Tn my anxiety to be readily understood, I have, perhaps, been under the necessity of occasionally repeating the same directions in different parts of the book: but I chose rather to be censured for repetition, than for omission or obscurity. It has been customary to fill a certain number of pages with the Jrt <y' Carving*, and Bills of * Buy Dr Triisler’s Art of Carving. You will find a wholesome hint on this subject in pave xxi. of this Pre- face. Ceremony, does not in any thin", more com- monly and completely triumph over comfort, than in the administration of “ the honours of the table. ” Those who serve out the loaves and fishes, very seldom seem to understand, that he fills that situation best, W'ho in the shortest time, fills the plates of the greatest mnnber of hnnvry guests surrounding him. A dexteidus Carver, (especially if he be possessed with that determined enemy to ceremony and sauce, a keen apiietite,) will help half a dozen people, in half the time, one of your would-be-thought polite folks, occupies in making civil faces and compliments, to a single guest. Hall'the trouble of waiting at table, may be saved, by giving each guest, two plates, two knives and forks, two ))ieci's of bread, a spoon, a wine glass, and a tum- bler, and placing the wines and sauces, and the INIaga- zine of Taste, 463, <!vc. as a dormant, in the centre of the table ; one neighbour may then help another.

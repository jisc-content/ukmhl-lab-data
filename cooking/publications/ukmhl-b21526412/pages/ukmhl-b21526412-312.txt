To make Extempore Pease Soup, see (No. .5.55.) Pease mid Dripping Soup. — (No. 219-) Pease soup may be made savoury, full to the palate, and most excellent and agreeable, without any meat, by incorporating two ounces of fresh beef, mutton, or pork drippings, with two ounces of oatmeal, and mixing this well into the gallon of soup, made as in (No. 221.) * My witty predecessor. Dr. Hunter, {see Ciiliiia, page !(7,) says, “ If a proper quantity of curry powder be added to pease soup, a good soup might be made, under tlie title of curry pease soup. Heliogabalus offered rewards for tlie discovery of a new dish, and the Uritish Parliament have given notoriety to inven- tions ot much less importance than ‘ curry pease soup.’ ” N.H. Celery cut into bits about an inch long, and boiled separately, and thrown into the tureen when the soup is going to table, will give another agreeable variety, and may be called Cei.ery and Pease .Soup.

GRAVIES AND SAUCES. 3.55 Goosebevrif Sauce. — (No. 263.) Boil half a pint of green Gooseberries for Hve minutes, drain them on a hair sieve, and put them into half a pint of melted butter. Some add grated Ginger; and the French, minced Fennel. Chervil and Butter. — (No. 264.) This is the first time this very delicious herb, which has so long been a favourite with the sagacious French cook, has been introduced into an English book. Its flavour is a strong concentration of the combined taste of Parsley and Fennel, but more aromatic and agreeable than either; and is so excellent a sauce with boiled Poultry or Fish, I cannot account for its being so little known in the English kitchen. You may make most exquisite sauce with it by preparing it, &c. as we have directed for Parsley and butter. Obs. — Drs. Lewis and Aitken are most respectable and well-accredited writers on che- mistry, &c. and I trust those, who feel “ I’csprit ilu corps,” will forgive me, for saying they l)Hve written also like men of taste on culinary subjects, as the following quotation from their Materia Medica, 8vo.

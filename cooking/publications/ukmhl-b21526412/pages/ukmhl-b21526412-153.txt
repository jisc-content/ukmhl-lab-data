Cut off tlie shank bone and trim the knuckle of a leg of mutton, and put it into lukewarm water for an hour; wash it clean, put it on in plenty of cold water; let it boil gently; and skim it carefully. A leg of nine pounds will take three hours very gentle boiling. Neck of Mutton.—(No. 2.) Put four or five i)ounds of the best end of the neck, into a gallon and a half of water, and let it simmer slowly for two hours; it will eat most deliciously tender: it will look most de- licate if you do not take off the skin till it has been boiled. Send up for sauce, that elegant and innocent relish, parsley and butter, (No. 'ifil)

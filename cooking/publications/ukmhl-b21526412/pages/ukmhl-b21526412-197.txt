187 ROASTING. Send up venison sauce with it. See the pre- ceding receipt, or (No. 344,) &c. Hare —(No, (36.) This Receipt was given us by Dr. Kitchiner’s Housekeeper. The first points of consideration are, how old is the hare? and how long has it been killed ? When voung it is easy of digestion, and very nourishing; but when old, the contrary in every respect. To ascertain the age, examine the first joint of the fore foot; you will find a small knob, if it is a leveret, which disappears as it grows older; then examine the ears ; if they tear easily, it will eat tender; if they are tough, so will be the hare; which will eat better made into soup (No. 241,) or stewed, or jugged, see (No. .529,) than it will roasted. When newly killed, the body is stiff; as it grows stale, it becomes limper. As soon as you receive a hare, take out the liver, parboil it, and keep it for the stuffing, for some are very fond of it; but do not use it, if it be not quite fresh and good. Wipe the hare quite dry, rub the inside with pepper, and hang it up in a dry cool place. Do not prepare too fierce a fire, or you will burn the outside before the inside is warm.

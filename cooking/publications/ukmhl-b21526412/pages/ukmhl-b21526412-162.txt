BOILING. 152 or sauce superlative, (No. 429;) give it a boil up, skim it, and then put in the calf’s head and bacon to warm, (it must nut boil after",) and it is ready. N. B. You may garnish the edges of the dish with slices of bacon toasted in a Dutch oven, see (Nos. 526 and 527,) and slices of lemon. Pickled Pork — (No. 11.) Requires more time than any meat. When you cook a leg, which, when well dressed, is a favourite dish with almost every body, take care it does not boil fast; if it does, the knuckle will break to pieces, before the thick part of the meat is warm through: a LEG of seven pounds will take nearly three hours very slow boiling.—To make pease soup, extempore, see (Nos. 218, and 555.) If not done enough, nothing is more dis- agreeable ; if boiled too long, it not only loses its colour and flavour, but its substance becomes soft like a jelly. It must never appear at table without a good large pease pudding, see (No. 555,) and if you please, parsnips, (No. 128,) or carrots, (No. 129,) turnips and greens, or mashed potatoes, &c. (No. 106.) Ohs. Remember not to forget your mustard pot, (No. 369, and No. 370.)

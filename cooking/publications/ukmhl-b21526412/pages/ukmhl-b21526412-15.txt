A sound Stomach may be said to be the mainspring of all our comfort; and (lions appetite only to ho excited by fantastic dainties, as the brains of peacocks or parrots, tlie tongues of thrushes and nightingales, or the teats of a lactiferous sow. Ill the liberal acceptation which I give to the teiiii Epieiire, it means only the person who relishes his food cooked according to scientific prinei|)les; that is to say, so prejiarcd, that the |ialate is delighted, rendered of easy solution in the stoniatdi, and ultimately contributing to health; exciting him, as an animal, to the vigorous enjoyment of those leereatioiis and duties, physical and intellectual, which constitute the ha|)pi- ness and dignity of his nature.‚Äù For this etymological illustration, I am indebted to my scientific iiiciid, Apicius Cadiiis, junr., with whose erudite observations several of the pages of this work arc enriched, as will he understood when the signature A.

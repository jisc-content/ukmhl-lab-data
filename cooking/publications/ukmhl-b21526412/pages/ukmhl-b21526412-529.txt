MADE DISHES. 519 To Hash Beef, a la Moost-Aye, or the Gipsies way. â€” (No. 4&G.) Put a pint of broth, or a pint of water, with a large tablespoonful of mushroom catsup into a stewpan with the gravy you have saved that was left from the beef; slice a large onion very fine, and boil it till it is quite done, which will take about ten minutes ; put two tablespoonsful of flour into a basin, just wet it with a little water, mix it well together, and then stir it into the broth and give it one boil up; now put in the beef, and let it simmer very gently for twenty minutes. N. B. A teaspoonful of parsley chopped as fine as possible, and put in five minutes before it is served up, is a great addition. See also (Nos. 360, 484, 485, and 506.) Cold Meat Broiled, zcith Poached Eggs. (No. 4S7.) Cut some slices of meat of even and equal thickness, and broil and brown them carefully; give those slices most fire that are least done; when done, lay them in a disli before the fire to keep hot, while you poach your eggs. See (No. 546.) This makes an excellent luncheon or supper. Y y 2

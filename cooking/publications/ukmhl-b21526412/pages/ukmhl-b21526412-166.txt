A Tongue is so hard, whether prepared by drying or pickling, that it requires much more time, &c. than a ham; nothing, of its weight, takes so long to dress it properly. A tongue that has been salted and dried, should be put to soak 24 hours before it is wanted, in plenty of water; a green tongue fresh from the pickle requires soaking only a few hours; put your tongue into plenty of cold water, and give it from three and a half to four hours very slow simmering, according to its size: about half an hour before it is done, take it up, peel it, and put it into the pot again to finish it. It is a general rule with most cooks, to try if the tongue will peel, and then allow it half an hour after that. Ohs. — When you choose a tongue, pick out that which has the smoothest skin, which de- notes its being young, and of course it is more likely to be tender.

GRAVIES AND SAUCES. 386 Fried Parsley, — (No. 317*) Let it be well picked and washed, and then put into a cloth, and swung backwards and forwards till it is perfectly dry; put it into a pan of hot fat, fry it quick, and have a slice ready to take it out the moment it is crisp, (if you let it stay too long, it will look black;) put it on a sieve or coarse cloth before the fire to drain. N. B. It is not very easy to do this nicely. Crisp Parsley.—(No. 318.) Pick and wash a handful of young parsley, and then shake it in a dry cloth to drain the water from it; spread it on a sheet of clean paper, in a Dutch oven before the fire, and lay some very little bits of butter on it; turn it frequently until it is quite c/'isp. This is a much more easy and elegant way of preparing it, than the usual way of frying it, which is not seldom ill done. Obs.—It is a very pretty garnish for Lamb Chops, Fried Fish, &c.

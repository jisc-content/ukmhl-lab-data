MADE DISHES. 120 for the most easy and simple way to make hashes, &c.; for only those who are well skilled in Culinary arts, know how good things may be dressed up in this way, so as to be as agi’eeable and nutritious as they were the first time they were cooked; the main business of this book is to increase the comforts of moderate families and moderate fortunes. I have also given the plainest directions, for preparing the more com- posite and elaborate made dishes, still keeping constantly in mind, not to make either the Stomach or the Purse suffer for the pleasure of the Palate; endeavouring to hold the ba- lance even, between the agreeable and the wholesome, and the Epicure and the Economist, This is by no means so difficidt a task as some gloomy philosophers (uninitiated in Culinary Science,) have tried to make the world believe, by telling us, that every thing that is nice, must be noxious; and evei’y thing that is nasty, must be wholesome. But as honest Will Shakspeare, declares he never found a Philo- sopher who could endure the tooth-ach pa-, tiently: Apicius, protests he has not yet over- taken one who did not love a Feast. 1 promise those who do inc the honour to put my receipts into practice, tliey will find tliat the most nutritious and tndv elesfant dishes.

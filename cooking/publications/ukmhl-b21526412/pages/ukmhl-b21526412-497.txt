487 GRAVIES AND SAUCES. Hash* Sauce.— (No. 451.) Mushroom catsup, (No. 439,) three ounces. Eshallot wine, (No. 402,) half an ounce. Walnut pickle, one ounce. Browning, (No. 436,) or (No. 322,) one ounce. Mix. If you wish it to keep for a great length of time, add half an ounce of (No. 422) to it. Obs. — This is not only a most convenient and agreeable Relish for Hashes, but beins: com- posed of proper proportions of the ingredients usually employed to flavour and make sauce for hashes, it will save you much time and trouble, and is thus easily made. Put a piece of butter about as big as a large egg, into a stewpan, set it on the fire; and when it looks brown, put to it a tablespoonful of flour; stir it thoroughly together, and add to it six berries of black pepper, the same of allspice, and three table- spoonsful of hash sauce, (No. 451 ;) put to it almost a pint of boiling water, and let it simmer gently over a slow fire for a quarter of an hour, strain it through a sieve, and it is ready to receive the meat that is to be warmed in it. • See also (Nos.

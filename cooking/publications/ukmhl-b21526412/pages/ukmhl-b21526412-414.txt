404 GRAVIES AND SAUCES. Orange Gravy Sauce, for Wild Ducks. (No. 338.) Set on a saucepan with half a pint of Veal Gravy, (No. 192,) add to it half a dozen leaves of basil, and a small onion; let it boil up two or three times, and strain it off. Put to the clear gravy the juice of a very fine Seville orange, or two lemons, half a teaspoonful of salt, the same of pepper, and a glass of red wine; send it up hot. Ohs.â€”This is an excellent Sauce for Widgeon, Teal, and all kinds of wild water-fowl. The com- mon way of gashing the breast, and squeezing in an orange, cools and hardens the flesh, and compels every one to eat duck that way; those who have the true taste for wild fowl, eat them very little done, and without any sauce. Gra- vies should always be sent up in a boat; tliey keep hot longer; it leaves it to the choice of the company to partake of it or not, as they like; and for those who choose it, there is no way of having the flavour of the pepper and orange so well.

•259 FISH, oysters are orought to market on the 5th of August; the Milton, or as they are commonly called, the melting natives*, do not come till the beginning of October, continue in season till the 12th of May, and reach the meridian of their perfection about Christmas. Some piscivorous Gourwaiuls think that oysters are not best when rpiite fresh from the beds; the flavour they have is too brackish and harsh, and is much ameliorated by giving them a feed, by covering them with clean water, with a pint of salt to about two gallons; (nothing else, no oatmeal, nor any other trumpery;) this will cleanse them from the mud and sand, &c. of the bed ; after they have Iain in it twelve hours, change it for fresh salt and water, and in twelve hours more, they will lie in prime order for the mouth, and remain so two or three days; at up on tlie Fri'iicli coast, and laiil in tlie Colcliester beds. Tlu'.se are never so line and fat as the Natives, and never recover the sliock their feeliiii;s receive, from being transported from their native place; tljese delicate little creatures are a.s excpiisite in their own taste, as they are to the taste of others. •* Those oysters arc thus called, that arc born as well as bred and fed in this country, and are mostly spit in the Burnham and Mersey rivers; they do not come to their lincsl condition till they arc near four years old.

GRAVIES AND SAUCES. 451 Quint-Essence of Lemon-Peel.— (No. 408.) Best oil of lemon, one drachm. Strongest spirit of wine, two ounces, introduced by degrees, till the spirit kills or overpowers, and completely mixes with the oil. This is a most elegant and useful preparation, possessing all the delightful fragrance and flavour of the freshest Lemon-peel. Obs.—A few drops on the sugar you make punch with, will instantly impregnate it with as much flavour as the troublesome and tedious method of grating the rind, or rubbing the sugar on it. It will be found a superlative sub- stitute for fresh lemon-peel, for every purpose that it is used for; blanc mange, jellies, custards, ice, negus, lemonade, and pies, puddings, stuf- fings, soups, sauces, and ragouts, to which it immediately gives a most delicious Zest.

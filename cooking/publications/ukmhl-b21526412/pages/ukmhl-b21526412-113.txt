BROTHS, GRAVIES, AND SOUPS. 103 quality of taste, so much admired in mock- turtle, there is nothing like a cow-hcd, (which is an improvement to almost every soup,) it must not be a ready dressed one, such as are sold at the tripe shops, from which all the glutinous part has been extracted, but one that has only been scalded and scraped. To their very rich gravies, &c. the French add the breasts of partridges and fowls, beaten to a pulp in a marble mortar; a piece of the beef you have, which has been boiled to make broth or gravy, pounded in the like manner, with a bit of butter and flour, and gradually well in- corporated with the gravy or soup, will be found an excellent substitute for these more expensive articles. ISIcat from which broth has been made, and all the juice has been extracted, is then excellently well prepared for potting, see (No. 503,) and is quite as good, or better than that which has been baked till it is dry*; indeed if it be pounded, and seasoned in the usual manner, it will be an elegant and savoury at least, iialfaii hourâ€™s gentle simmering after; if it is at all lumpy, pass it through a fine hair sieve. Sec (No. 257.) * If the Gravy, is not completely drained from it, the article potted, will turn sour in a couple of days.

MADE DISHES. 520 Mushroom catsup and melted butter for sauce, with a few drops of shallot wine or vinegar in it. See (No. 402,) or (No. 439.) Irish Slew*.—(No. 488.) I'rim your chops the same as for Harrico, put them into a stewpan, with as much water as will just cover them; when it has boiled, and you have skimmed it, for six or eight chops put in one ounce of onion chopped very fine, with a tea spoonful of salt, and half the quantity of ground black pepper; let it stew very gently for an hour and a quarter; and then peel six potatoes, and when they are quite done, it is ready to serve up. N. B. Beef steaks may be done the same way, but require more doing. Obs.—Two sliced onions may be added to each pound of meat; fiour and butter, and flavour to the palate. * III all slews and made dishes, take care the meat does not to rass, by doing too fast.

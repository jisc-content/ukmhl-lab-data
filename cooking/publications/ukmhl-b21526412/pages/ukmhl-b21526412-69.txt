On this, depends the good appearance of all boiled things. When yon have scummed well, throw in some cold water and a little salt, which will throw up the rest of the scum. The oftencr it is scummed, and the cleaner the top of the water is kept, the cleaner will be the meat. If let alone, it soon boils down and sticks to the meat*; which, instead of looking delicately white and nice, will have that coarse and filthy appearance we have too often to complain of, and the butcher and poulterer, get blamed for the carelessness of the Cook in not scumming her pot. Many put in milk, to make what they boil look white ; but this does more harm than good: others wrap it up in a cloth; but this is needless; if the scum be attentively removed, it will have a much moi'e delicate colour and finer flavour â€¢ * If, unfortunately, tlii.s should lia|))>en, tlic Cook must carefully take it off when slie dishes up, either with a clean sponge or a paste-hruslK

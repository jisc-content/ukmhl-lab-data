TABLE OF WEIGHTS AND I\1EASHHES. To reduce our culinary operations, to as exact a certainty, as the nature oi’the processes would admit ol’; we have, wherever i(, was needful, given the quantities of each article. The WeigIll's, are avoirdupois. The Mi'.a- suRE, — the liquid graduated glass of the apothecaries; this appeared the most accurate and convenient; the pint being divided into six- teen ounces, the ounce into eight drachms. A middling size teaspoon will contain about a draclim ; four such teaspoons are ecpial to a middling size tablespoon, or half an ounce ; four tablespoons to a common sized wineglass. The specific gravities, of the various substances, being so extremely diH'crcnt, we cannot offer any auxiliary standards’' for the weights, which we earnestly recommend the cook to employ, if she wishes to gain credit for accuracy (and refer her to our remarks on Palalic.s, and the education of a Cook’s ’ronguc in the 1. page of the preface) .iml uniformity in her business ; these she will lind it necessary to have as small as the ipiarter ol ' \ lavf,'e lal)k'.si)ooufiil of Hour wtiglis about half an JUllCl'.

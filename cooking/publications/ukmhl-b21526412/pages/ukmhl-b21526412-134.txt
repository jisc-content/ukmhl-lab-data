A bottle of pale slierry, three years old, containing twenty-five ounces, produced three ounces. A bottle of Madeira, two years old, containing twen- ty-five ounces and a half, two ounces and five drachms. A bottle of Cape Madeira, one year old, containing twenty-five ounces, two ounces and a half. A bottle of old hock, containing twenty-one ounces, nearly an ounce. A bottle of brandy, containing twenty-four ounces, ten ounces. A bottle of rum, containing twentj’-four and a half ounces, nine ounces and a half. A quart of public-house ale (not bottled,) from the brewery of Rlr. Wyatt, one ounce. From a quart of common draught porter, from the brewery of Messrs. Elliot and Co., five and a half d raclims. From the foregoing results, it appears that four bot- tles either of port, sherry, or IMadcira, contain more ardent spirit than a bottle of brandy. Three bottles of sherry are nearly equal to one bottle of rum. That ten bottles of hock, or ten quarts of ale, or about fourteen and a half quarts of pwter, are equal to a bottle of brandy. — From Dr. Keece’s Gazette of Health.

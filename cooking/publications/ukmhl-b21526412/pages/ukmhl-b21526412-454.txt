444 GRAVIES AND SAUCES. Hannel bag; add a drachm of isinglass, and put it into a dry jar; let it stand four-and- twenty hours, till it is fine; pour it into half pint bottles; cork them carefully, and keep them in a dry place. Obs.—You may prepare Elder-flower, and other vinegars in the same manner: elder and tarragon are those in most general use in this country. Our neighbours, the French, prepare Vinegars flavoured with celery, cucumbers, cap- sicums, garlick; onion, capers, burnet, truffles, Seville orange-peel, ginger; in short, they im- pregnate them with almost every herb, fruit, flower and spice separately, and in innumerable combinations. Basil Pinegar or JVme. — (No. 397.) Steep two ounces of dried and tifted Sweet Basil, (this is in full perfection about the middle of August,) in a pint of the best white-wine vinegar, or white wine, for fourteen days, or a better way is to fill a wide mouthed bottle with the fresh green leaves of Basil, and cover them with vinegar or wine, and let them steep as above; it you wish a very strong essence, after the first fourteen days, strain the liquor on some fresh leaves, and let them steep fourteen days more.

ROASTING. 66 take especial care it be even balanced on the spit, that its motion may be regular, and the fire operate equally on each part of it; therefore be provided with balancing* skewers, and cook- holds, and see it is properly jointed. All your attention in roasting, will be thrown away, if you do not take care, that your meat has been kept long enough to be tender The only uppermost, and tlie whole joint cut and eat most deli- ciously gravy-full. A Bottle-Jack, as it is termed by the furnishing ironmongers, is a valuable instrument for roasting. A Dutch Oven, is another very convenient utensil, for roasting tight joints, or warming them up. * Amongst the inventions, in the collection of the Society of Arts, in the Adelphi, is the model of a roasting balance, called the Oxford Balance, which it not thrust into the meat, but is screwed temporarily on the spit, and adjusted to the utmost nicety. t The time, meat should hang to be tender, depends, entirely on the degree of heat and humidity of the air ; if not kept long enough it is hard and tough; if too long, it loses its flavour; it should hang where it will have a tliorough air, and dry it well with a cloth night and morning, to keep it from growing damp and musty. When yon dress it, pare off the outsides, for they sometimes get a bad taste. If you fear meat will not keep till the day it is wanted, par-roast or par-boil it, and it will then keep a couple of days longer; then dress it in the usual way, only it will require rather less time.

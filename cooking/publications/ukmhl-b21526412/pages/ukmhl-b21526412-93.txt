Let tlie bars of the gridiron be all hot through, but yet not burning hot upon the surface: this is the perfect and fine condition of the gridiron ; for if it is hastily heated, the bars will be hot enough to scorch the things laid on them on the outside. The bars keep away as much heat as their breadth covers. It is absolutely necessary they should be tho- roughly hot before the thing to be cooked be laid on them. The bars of gridirons should be made concave, and terminate in a trough to catch the gravy; and also keep the fat from dropping into the fire and making a smoke, which will spoil your broil. The Upright fliuDiRONS are the best, as they can be used at any hre, without fear of smoke; and the gravy is preserved in the trough under them.

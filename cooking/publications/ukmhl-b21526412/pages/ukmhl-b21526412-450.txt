440 GRAVIES AND SAUCES. M. Birch’s Receipt for Mock Cream. • (No. 388.) Mix half a tablespoonful of flour, with a pint of new milk ; let it simmer five minutes, to take off the rawness of the flour; then beat up the yolk of an egg, stir it into the milk while boiling, and strain it through a fine sieve. Raspberry I'inegar. — (No. 390.) Take fine fresh gathered red raspberries that have been well picked; put them into a wooden or china bowl, with as much good distilled wine vinegar as will cover them; bruise and stir them frequently for three or four days ; strain them ; and to every pint of the liquor add a pound of lump sugar; boil for a quarter of an hour, taking off the scum as it rises; add to each pint a glass of brandy, and bottle it: mixed in about eight parts of water, it is a very refreshing and delightful summer drink. A most excellent cooling beverage to assuage thirst in fevers, and colds, &c., and is agreeable to most palates.

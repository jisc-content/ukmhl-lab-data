60 BOILIXG. than it has when muffled up. This may give rather more trouble — but those who wish to excel in their art must never consider any thing, but how the processes of it can be most perfectly performed; and a Cook who has a proper pride and pleasure in her business, will make this her maxim on all occasions. Remove the dirt, instead of defending the meat against it. Put your meat into plenty of cold* water, not less than a quart to a pound, so that it may get gradually warm through before the outside becomes hard ; begin to reckon the time from its first coming to a boil. The old nde of 15 mi- nutes to a pound of meat, we think rather too little; for the slower it boils, the tenderer, plumper, and whiter it will be. From 20 to 30 minutes to a pound will not be found too much for gentle simmering by the side of the fire; allowing more or less time, according to the thickness of the joints; always remembering, the slower it boils the better: without some practice it is difficult to teach any art; and * Cook.s, liowevcr, as well as doctors, disagree ; for some say, tliat “ all sorts of fresh meat should be put in when the water boils.” I prefer the above method, for the reason given.

GRAVIES AND SAUCES. 402 blade of mace, or twelve berries of allspice, the same of black pepper, a tablespoonful of mush- room catsup, and the same quantity of Port wine. Put an ounce of butter into a saucepan; when it is melted, put in a quarter of an ounce of sliced onion, shake in about half an ounce of flour, stir it well with a wooden spoon till the froth sinks, and it has caught a bright brown colour; then by degrees stir in the above in- gredients, and let it stew for half an hour, and strain it well through a tammis or fine sieve. Obs. — Mushroom Catsup, supplies the place of meat, better than any thing: if you have not this, beer, wine, spices, and the aromatic roots and herbs, onions, anchovy and soy, variously combined, and thickened with flour and butter, are the usual substitutes; but those families who are frequently in want of Gravy Sauces, (witliout plenty of which, no Cook can support the credit of her kitchen,) should always keep by them a stock of Portable Soup or Gl.aze, see (No. 18.5,) and (No. 251): this, with a portion of the above materials, or a tablespoonful of “ double relish,” or “ sauce superlative,” (No. 429), or (No. 255), will make gravy immediately.

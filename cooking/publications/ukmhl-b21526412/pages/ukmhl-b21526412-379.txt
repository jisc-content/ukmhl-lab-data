369 GRAVIES AND SAUCES. Celery Sauce, Brozem. — (No. *290.) Pick and wash the celery very clean, ami cut it into thin slices; let it boil gently in a little water till it is perfectly tender, then add a little pepper and salt; let these simmer together for a few minutes, and add a piece of butter rolled in flour, and boil up together with half a pint of beef gravy, (No. 329.) Obs. — This is more in the French style of cookery than the former sauce, and some think it more agreeable. The other is simple and elegant; the beef gravy makes this very fine and high flavoured. If you wish for Celery sauce, when Celery is not in season, half a drachm of celery-seed, or a little Essence of Celery, (No. 409,) will im- pregnate the sauce with all the flavour of the vegetable. Sorrel Sauce. — (No. 29E) Pound sorrel leaves sufficient to get from them two tablespoonsful of juice; pass it through a sieve, and add it to some good melted butter, with the yolk of two eggs, and a little salt, pepper, and nutmeg; warm it together without boiling.

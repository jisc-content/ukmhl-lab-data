ADVICE TO COOKS, liv after the time, is so frequent a fault, that there is the more merit attached in being ready at the appointed hour*. This is certainly sometimes a rather difficult task to perform ; and in the best regulated families, you can only be‘sure of your time by thus properly arranging your businessf. “ would use those unpleasant moments to sum up all “ my faults. Roileau, is indeed a man of genius,” they would say, “ and a very honest man ; but that dilatory procrastinating way he has got into, w'onld mar the virtues of an angel.” * Those who desire regularity in the service of their table, should liavc a DI.AL, of not less than twelve inches diameter, placed over the kitchen fire-place, carefully regulated, to keep time e.xactly witii tlie clock in the hall or dining parlour; with a frame on jone side, containing a taste table, of the peculiarities of the master’s palate, and the particular rules and orders of his kitchen; and on the other side, of the rewards given to tho.se who attend to them, and for long service. t With all onr love of punctuality, wo must not for- get that the first consideration must still be, that the dinner “ be well done when ’tis done.” If any accident occurs, which is likely to prevent your sending the, soup, &c. to table at the moment it is expected, send up a message to your employers, stating the circum- stance, and bespeak their patience for as many minutes as you think yon shall want to be ready. This is better than cither keeping the company waiting without an apology; or dishing your diuner before it is done enough, and so disgusting the stomachs of the guests at the first appearance of it.

MACE DISHES. 527 witli a “ STARVED TURTLE;' the latter with a “ FATTED CALF.” See (Nos. 247, 343, and 343.*) The scarcity of tolerable good cooks, ceases to be surprising, when we reflect how much more astonishing is the ignorance of most of those who assume the character of Scientific GOURMAXDS, SO extremely ignorant of “ the Affairs of the Month,” they seem hardly to “ know a Sheep's head from a Carrot,” and their real pretensions to be profound Palaticians, are as moderate, as the wine merchant’s customer, whose sagacity in the selection of liquors, was only so exquisite, that he knew that Port wine was black, and that if he drank enough of it, it would make him drunk. Brisket of Beef Stewed. — (No. 494.) This is prepared in exactly the same way as “ soup and bouilli.” See (No. 5,) and (No. 238.) Ilarricot of Beef. — (No. 495.) A stewed brisket cut in slices, and sent up with the same sauce of roots, &c., as we havE directed for harricot of mutton, (No. 489,) is a most excellent dish, of very moderate expense.

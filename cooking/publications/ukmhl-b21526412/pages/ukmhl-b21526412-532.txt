Have ready boiled two dozen round young onions, about as big as nutmegs, five ounces of carrots cut into slices, or shaped into balls as you please, and twelve ounces of turnips divided into pieces about as big as a nutmeg; (to these some Cooks add two or three heads of Celery, cut the size of a shilling, or Stewed Cucumber, (No. 135); have them drained dry, put them into a clean stew- pan, and strain to them (by passing it through a tammis or hair sieve) the gravy the cutlets were stewed in; when the carrots and turnips are hot, put them in the middle of your chops, and serve up. Obs. â€” Rump steaks, Veal cutlets, and Beef tails, make excellent dishes dressed in the like manner. * If they are stewed too fast, or too mncli, they arc spoiled, and no more lit to be eaten tlian meat that lias been boiled down for gravy.

GRAVIES AND SAUCES. 413 some carrot and an onion cut into slices, pour in two or three tablespoonsful of broth, or water, and set it over a slow fire for about ten minutes; stir it about till it sticks to the bottom of the stewpan; then dreds^e in a little flour, and keep stirring it about for some time, for it will more and more stick to the bottom ; after some time, add to it its own gravy that you have saved, and pour in half a pint of gravy, (or water and a tablespoonful of mush- room catsup, if you have no gravy,) a small sprig of lemon-thyme, sweet marjoram, or winter savory, a few leaves of sweet basil, an eshallot, cut in half, a couple of bay-leaves, and a dozen corns of black pepper; cover up, and let it stew very gently, over a very slow fire, for about forty minutes; strain off the gravy through a fine sieve; skim it well; clear it with the white of an egg, give it a boil up, strain through a tammis, and when cold, bottle it for use. Obs. â€” This ham sauce is made at very moderate expense, and is equal to the most extravagant essences of ham: and though thus easily and cheaply obtained, it is a very rich article of the sauce kind, and very convenient to heighten the flavour of ragouts, gravies, &c., and for veal, capons, &c.

Peel off' half an inch of the stringy outside; full-grown turnips will take thirty minutes gentle boiling; (if they boil too fast, they will burst;) try them with a fork; when tender, take them up, and lay them on a sieve ten minutes, to drain the water thoroughly from them: send them up whole; do not slice them. Obs. — Young turnips should not be peeled; and, indeed, some experienced people never peel the older ones, because the rind will readily separate from the main body, after it is boiled, and the root will be less watery and higher flavoured. To Mash Turnips,—(No. 131.) When they are boiled quite tender, squeeze them as dry as possible between two trenchers, put them into a saucepan, mash them with a wooden spoon, and rub them through a cidlender, add a little bit of butter, keep stirring them till the butler is melted and well mixed with them, and they are ready for table.

My facetious predecessor, Dr. King, in his letter to Dr. Lister (vide “ King’s Art uf Cookery”) says; “ The following is tlie true receipt for making ‘ the carrier sauce,’ whicli I have from an ancient manuscript, remaining at the Bull Inn, in Bishopsgate Street;—Take seven spoonsful of spring water, slice two onions, of moderate size, into a large saucer, and put in as much salt as you can hold at tiirice betwixt your forefinger and thumb if large, and serve it up. Probatum at, Hobson, carrier to the University of Cambridge.” Green 3Iiiit Sauce. — CNo. 303.) Wash half a handful of green mint, (to this some add one third the cpiantity of parsley,) pick the leaves from the stalks, mince them \ery fine and put them into a sauceboat, with a teaspoonful of moist sugar, and four table- spoonsful of vinegar ; mix well together. Obs. — This is an inseparable companion to !»ut Lamb; we think it an equally agreeable rdish with cold lamb. If Green mint cannot be procured, this sauce may be made with Mint vinegar. See (No. 398.)

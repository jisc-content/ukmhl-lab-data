Is a very convenient article in the kitchen, to add to those Soups or Sauces, of which it is supposed the deep brown of their Complexion, denotes the strength and savouriness of the Composition; and it is a very good substitute for what is called “ Indian, or Japanese soy,” see (No. 436.) Put half a pound of Sugar, (Lump sugar is best) and a tablespoonful of water into a clean iron saucepan, set it over a slow tire, and keep stirring it with a wooden spoon till the sugar is burnt to a dark brown colour; then add to it an ounce of salt, and dilute it (with about three wineglasses of water,) till it is the thickness of Soy; let it boil, take off the scum, and strain the liquor into bottles. * This is u favourite ingredient, witli (he Brewers, wlio use it under the name of “ Essentia Hina” to colour their Beer; it is also employed by the Brandy makers, in considerable quantity, to colour Brandy ; to which, besides enriching its complexion, it gives that sweetish taste, and fulness in the mouth, which custom, has taught Brandy drinkers to admire, and prefer to the finest Cogniac in its gentiine state.

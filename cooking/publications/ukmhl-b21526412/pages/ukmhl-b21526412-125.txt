On the contrary, of compound sauces the ingre- dients should be so nicely proportioned, that no one be predominant; so that, from the equal union of the combined flavours, such a fine mellow mixture is produced, wliose very no- velty cannot fail of being acceptable to the per- severing gourmand, if it has not pretensions to a permanent place at his table.

BOILING. 154 Bacon. — (No. 13.) Put a pound of nice streaked bacon into two quarts of boiling water, and let it boil for three quarters of an hour; take it up, scrape the under side well, and cut off the rind; grate a crust of bread over it, and put it before the fire for a few minutes; it must not be there too long, or it will dry it too much and spoil it. Two pounds will require an hour and a half, the hock or gammon being very thick, will take full a quarter of an hour to a pound more. Ham. — (No. 14.) Though of the bacon kind, has been so altered and hardened in the particular way of curing, it requires a very different manner of dressing. Ham is generally not half soaked, as salt as brine, and hard as flint; if it is a very dry Westphalia ham, it must be soaked from 12 to 24 hours; but for a Yorkshire or Westmoreland ham, from 4 to 8 hours will be sufficient. Give it plenty of water room; a copper is the best thing to boil it in; put it in while the water is cold, and keep it well scummed : a middling sized ham of fifteen pounds will be enough in three hours, or three and a half;

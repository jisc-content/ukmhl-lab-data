GRAVIES AND SAUCES. 476 and some more salt on them, and so on al- ternately, salt and mushrooms ; let them remain two or three hours, by which time the salt will have penetrated the mushrooms, and rendered them easy to break; mash them well with your hands, and let them remain in salt for a couple of days, stirring them up and mashing them well each day; then pour them into a stone jar, and to each quart add half an ounce of whole black pepper; stop the jar very close, and set it in a stewpan of boiling water, and keep it boiling for two hours at least. Take out the jar, and pour the juice clear from the settlings through a hair sieve (without squeezing the mushrooms) into a clean stewpan ; let it just boil up, skim it, and pour it into a clean dry jar or jug; let it stand till next day, then pour it off as gently as possible, (so as not to disturb the settlings at the bottom of the jug,) through a tammis, or thick flannel bag. Bottle it in pints or half pints ; (for it is best to keep it in such quantities as are soon used ;) in each pint, put a dozen berries of black pepper, the same of allspice, and a tablespoonful of brandy. Take especial care that it is closely corked, and sealed down, or dipped in Bottle Cement, (to make this, sec last page of observations on Sauces, in the 8th chapter of the Iludiments of Cookery.)

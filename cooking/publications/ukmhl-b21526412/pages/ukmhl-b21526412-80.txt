ROASTINa. 70 If you wish your jack to go well, keep it as clean as possible, oil it, and then wipe it; if the oil is not wiped off again, it will gather dust to prevent this, as soon as you have done with your jack, cover it up. Never leave the winders' on whilst the jack is going round, unless, you. do it, as Swift says, that it may fly off, and knock those troublesome servants on the head who will be crowding round your kitchen fire. Be very careful, to place the dripping-pan at such a distance from the fire, as just to catch the drippings : if it is too near, the ashes will fall into it, and spoil the Drippings * ; (which Ave shall hereafter show, Avill be found not only an excellent substitute, but for many purposes decidedly superior to either butter or lard; —to clarify drippings, see No. 83, and Pease and Dripping Soup, No. 219); if it is too far from the fire to catch them, you will not only lose your drij)pings, but the meat will be black- ened, and spoiled by the foetid smoke, whicli. Avill arise when the fat falls on the live cinders. * Tills the good lionscwife will take up occasionally, as hy leaving it all in the dii|)ping-pan, until the meat is taken up, it not oidy becomes very strong, but when the meat is rich and yields much of it, it is apt to be spilt in basting.^—To clarify Drippings, see No. 83.

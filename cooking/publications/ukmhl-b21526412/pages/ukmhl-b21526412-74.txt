RUDIMENTS OF COOKERY CHAPTER II. ROASTING. In all studies, it is the best practice, to begin with the plainest and easiest parts ; and so on, by degrees, to such as are more difficult; we, therefore, treated of plain boiling, and we now proceed to roasting * ; we shall then gra- * The innscular flesh of animals, which is the subject of culinary operations, is composed of many elements. A nice discrimination of these parts is by no means necessary for our present purpose ; it will be sufficient to point out, that of muscular flesh one part becomes coagulated at the boiling heat of i2l2Â° of Fahrenheit, and resembles, in its properties, the white of an egg; it has, therefore, been called albumen. Another com- ponent part is the animal glue or Jelly, termed gelatin ; and the otiicr is the coloured juice contained within the smaller vessels, which, in compliance with custom, we denominate gravy. In the preparation of food by boiling and roasting, the albumen is coagulated : the same effect takes place in the drawing of gravy. In this latter operation, the gelatin and fluids contained

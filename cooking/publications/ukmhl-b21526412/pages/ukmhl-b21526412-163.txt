1.53 UOILING. Fig^s Pettitoes. — (No. KJ.) Put a thin slice of bacon at the bottom of n stewpan, witli some broth, a blade of mace, a bay-leaf, a few peppercorns, and a bit of thyme : boil the feet till they are quite tender; this will take full twenty minutes; but the heart, liver, and lights, will be done enough in ten ; when they are to be taken out, and minced fine. Put them into a stewpan with some gravy, and thicken it with a little butter rolled in flonr, season it with a little pepper and salt, set it over a gentle fire; let them simmer for five minutes, shaking them about very often. While tins is doing, have a thin slice of bread toasted very lightly, divide it into sippets, and lay them round the dish; pour the mince and sauce into the middle of it, and split the feet and lay them round it. N. B. The pettitoes arc sometimes fried in batter. Ohs. — If you have no gravy in the water you stew the pettitoes in, put an onion, a sprig of lemon thyme, or sweet marjoram, with a blade of bruiseil mace, a few black peppers, and a large teaspoonful of lemon pickle; and you will have a very tolerable substitute for gravy.

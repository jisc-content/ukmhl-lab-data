Beer, and Wine, are occasionally very convenient auxiliaries to finish soups, &C.: the proportion of wine should not exceed a large wineglassful to a quart of soup : this is as much as can be admitted, w’ithout the vinous flavour be- coming remarkably predominant; though much larger quantities are ordered in many books; so much are they overloaded with relish, that if you make soups according to their receipts, and will eat enough of them, they will certainly make you drunk, if they don’t make you sick — all this, frequently arises from an old Cook measuring the excitability of the eaters' palates, by his own, which may be so blunted by incessant tasting, that to awaken it, requires wine instead of water, and Cayenne and garlick, for black pepper and onion. Cooks too often season SOUP, (wbicb is intended to constitute a principal part of a meal,) as highly as SAUCE, of which only a spoonful may be relish enough tor a plate of insipid Viands. t IMany a good dish is spoiled, by the cook not knowing the proper use of this, which is to give a flavour, and not to be predominant over the other in- gredients; a morsel mashed with the point of a knife, and stirred in, is enough. .See (No. 405.')

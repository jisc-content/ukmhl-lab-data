PREFACE. but without familiarity. When you make out the bill of fare for the next day, do not pass any dish without observation, but never betray the slightest discontent at any other time — (unless the other domestics think the Cook is in favour with her master, it is impossible she can command those in his kitchen,) qualifying your censure by telling her, “ Tlie reason, whj’ I point out faults so small, Is, ’cause ’tis better to have none at all.” Dr. King’s Art of Cookery. who do not like this doctrine, must put up with such poor creatures, as dire necessity drives to them, and the mistress of the house, be content, to do half the work, herself. Ye, who think, that to protect and encourage Virtue, is the best preventive from Vice, give your female servants liberal wages, and let your charity begin at home—not, that (if after doing your duty there, your hearts still swell big with benevolence,) I have any objection, to see, your names ornamenting the lists of subscribers, to Foundling Hospitals, and Female Penitentiaries. Good mistresses make good servants ; and on tlic contrary, bad mistresses make bad servants. I asked a Cook once, who liad lived some years in her place, how she could think of sending up a dinner so ill- dressed, when (having lived with me) I knew she was capable of dressing it better : her answer was, she had no satisfaction, in taking pains, to dress a dinner well, for lier mistress had neither sincll nor ia.ste. It is the connoisseur who makes the artist. — Vide Domestic Management. Symonds, (52, M'ardour-strcet, .Soho, 8vo. l>age !!.

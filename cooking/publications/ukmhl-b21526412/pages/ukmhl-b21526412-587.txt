MADE DISHES, PUDDINGS, &C. 577 milk with them by degrees, then the rest of tlie ingredients; dip a fine close linen cloth into boiling water, and put it in a hair sieve; flour it a little, and tie it up close; put it into a saucepan containing six quarts of boiling water; keep a kettle of boiling water alongside of it, to fill up your pot as it wastes ; be sure to keep it boiling six hours at least. Ohs.â€”Mem.'//' the water ceases to boil, your pudding will become heavy, and be spoiled; but, if properly managed, this and the following, (No. 554,) will be as fine puddings of the kind as art can produce. Puddings are best when mixed over night, as the various ingredients by that means amalgamate, and the whole becomes more rich and fuller of flavour. The stiller they are mixed the better; though the cook who consults her ease will not thank me for this remark, if with it she joins that which is indispensable, that the various ingredients be THOROUGHLY Well stirrcd together. A wine- glass of brandy, is an improvement to this excellent British Pudding; if yon wish it to be most superlative, use fine Muscatel Raisins; and instead of Brandy, Noyeau or Cherry Brandy. A tablespoonful of Treacle will give it a rich brown colour. See Pudding Sauce, (No. 269,) and Pudding Catsup, (No. 446.) 3 D

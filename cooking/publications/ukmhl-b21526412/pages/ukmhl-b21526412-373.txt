GRAVIES AND SAUCES. 363 Street, Mary-le-bone, see (No. 245,) by the Publisher of this Work, and by Messrs. Balls, 81, New Bond Street. Obs. — This extract, is a most incomparable snccedaneum, while Oysters are out of season, and in such inland parts as seldom have any, is an invaluable addition to the list of tish sauces ; it is also equally good with boiled fowl or rump steak, and is especially worthy the notice of country housekeepers—and as a Store Sauce for the Army and Navy. Cockle Sauce.—(No. 281.) Wash a quart of cockles very clean, put them into a saucepan without any water, cover them close, and stew gently till they open; take the fish out of the shells, wash them in the liquor, strain it, let it stand to settle, and pour the clean liquor from the settlings into a clean stewpan with two ounces of butter, mixed with a tablespoonful of flour; you may put in half a tablespoonful of anchovy liquor, or mushroom catsup, and season it with salt; boil up together till your sauce is thick and smooth. Muscle Sauce — (No. 282.) Is prepared exactly in the same manner as llie preceding Cockle sauce.

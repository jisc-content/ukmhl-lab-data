FISH, 270 stone, and all the way up the Channel, and to Torbay; it being very deep water, and the ground a fine gravelly bottom, they feed very solid, and are caught frequently very large, eight or ten pounds per pair; they are generally brought by water to Portsmouth, and thence by land ; but the greatest quantity are caught off Yarmouth and the Knole, and a great many are caught off the Forelands. “ Red Mullets are a very delicious fish, com- monly called the sea woodcock, and are dressed with their entrails in, there being no gut, only like a string, which is like marrow itself; they only require scraping; washed tenderly with a cloth, and broiled in a buttered paper: they are so rich, they require scarcely any sauce. The best are caught off Plymouth, and all the way up the channel to Portland, and some few off' Brighton. “ Grey Mullets, when in season, are very rich, good fish, but not equal to the red; those generally keep in the season near the fresh water. The best way of dressing those, is by baking them in a pye, or roasting, or baking them, with a pudding in their belly, and put m a tureen willi some good gravv, anti thev eat very fine.

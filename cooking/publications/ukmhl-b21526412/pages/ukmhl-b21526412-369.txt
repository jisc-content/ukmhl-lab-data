GRAVIES AND SAUCES. 359 Lemon Sauce.— (No. 273.) Pare a lemon, and cut it into slices twice as thick as a half-crown piece; divide these into dice, and put them into a quarter of a pint of melted butter. Obs. — Some Cooks mince a bit of the Lemon Peel (pared very thin) very Jine, and add it to the above. Caper Sam&. — (No. 274.) To make a quarter pint, take a tablespoonful of Capers, and two teaspoonsful of Vinegar. The most elegant manner of cutting Capers, is to miuce one third of them very fine, and divide the others in half; put them into a quarter of a pint of melted butter. Remember to stir them the same way as you did the melted butter, or it will oil. Obs. — Some boil, and mince fine a few leaves of Parsley, and qdd these to the sauce; others squeeze in a quarter of a Seville orange, or half a lemon; take care that nothing but tho clear juice goes in. Keep your Caper bottle very closely corked, and do not use any of the Caper liquor; if the capers are not well covered with it, they will soon spoil, and it is an excellent ingredient iri

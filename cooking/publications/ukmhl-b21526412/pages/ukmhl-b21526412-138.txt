1 128 MADE DISHES. will find of infinite advantage; those, who are poor in health, must live as they can; certainly, the less stimuli, any of us use, the ales in ns an aversion to any i)articnlar food, does not the gullet recoil at the approach of it? and does not the stomach immediately discharge its disagreeable contents? Hunger, thirst, and taste, arc therefore three etfects of the same organ. Hunger and thirst are the motions of tiie organ desirous of its object. The taste is the motion of the organ, in the enjoyment of this object. This unity of the organ, in regard of hun- ger, thirst, and taste, is the cause of these three effects being almost always in the same proportion in the same persons. The more violent the appetite for food is, the greater is the enjoyment in eating; and the more the taste is gratified, the more easily the organs defray the expense of this gratification, by digestion. This rule is general, in regard of all the sensations and all the passions. Genuine desire constitutes the propor- tion of the pleasure, and of the power without this mutual consent, founded on the sympathy of these organs, our sensations would destroy that being, for whose benefit they are established. It is very natural that the month, which first receives the aliment, and of course becomes the taster, as it were, in respect of the gullet and stomach, should be endued with a dis- cerning property beyond them ; as it is the part of a good clerk of the kitchen to distinguish himself by an elegant choice of provisions, to prevent his incurring the displeasure of his employers.”—Vide the ingenious Le Cat’s I-'smy on lltc Senses. ]

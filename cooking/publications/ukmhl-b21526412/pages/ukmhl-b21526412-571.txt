MADE DISHES. 561 Stezeed Giblets. — (No. 531.) Clean two sets of giblets, as in the receipt for giblet soup, (No. 244;) put them into a saucepan (leaving out the Livers,) and just cover them with cold water ; set them on the tire ; when they boil, take oft' the scum, and season them with an onion, three cloves, two blades of mace, four berries of black pepper, the same of allspice, and half a teaspoonful of salt: cover the stewpan close, and let it simmer very gently till the giblets are quite tender; this will take from an hour and a half to two and a half, according to the age of the giblets, the pinions will be done first, and must then be taken out, and put in again to warm when the gizzards are done : watch them that they do not get too much done: take them out, and thicken the sauce with flour and butter: let it boil half an hour, or till there is just enough to eat with them; and then strain it through a tammis into a clean stewpan : cut the giblets into mouthfuls, put them into the sauce, with the juice of half a lemon, and a tablespoonful of mushroom catsup; pour the whole into a soup dish, with sippets of bread at the bottom. Obs. — Ox-Tails, prepared in the same way, are excellent eating.

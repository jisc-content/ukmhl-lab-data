.171 GRAVIES AND SAUCES, Mock Toniata Sauce.—(No. 293.) Reduce sharp tasted apples to a pulp, as in making apple sauce; pound them in a mortar with as much turmeric as will give them colour, and as much Chili vinegar as will give the same degree of acid flavour that the tomata has ; add to each pint a quarter of an ounce of shallots, shred fine; put all into a well-tinned saucepan, and mix them, well together, and give them a gentle boil; when cold, take out the shallot, and put the sauce into small stone bottles: your sauce should be of the consistence of a thick syrup; this may be regulated by the Cliili vinegar. Obs. — The only difference, between this, and genuine Love-apple Sauce, is the substituting the pulp of Apple for that of Tomata, ami colouring it with turmeric. Shallot Sauce. — (No. 294.) Mince four shallots very fine ; put them inti^ a stevvpan with a quarter pint of water, two tal)lespoonsful of vinegar, one of white wine, a quarter teaspoonful of pepper, and a little salt; stew for a quarter of an liour.

ROASTING. 163 Roast MUTTON*.—(Ko. 23.) As beef re<|uires a large sound fire, mutton must have a brisk and sliarp one; it is never well done unless the fire is quick and clear; and if you wish to have mutton tender, it should be hung as long as it will keep f; Rnd then, good eight-tooth Mutton, is as fine eating as Venison. * Dean Swift’s Rixcipt to Roast Mutton. “ Gi’iitly stir and blow tlie tire. Lay tile mutton down to roast, Diess it quickly I desire, In tlie dripping put a toast. That I hunger may remove,— INIntton is the meat I love. “ On the dresser see it lie; Oh! the charming white and red; Finer meat ne’er met the eye. On the sweetest grass it fed ; Let the jack go swiftly round. Let me have it nicely brown’d. “ On the table spread the cloth. Let the knives be sharp and clean, l^ickles get and salad both. Let them each be fresh and green. With small beer, good ale, and wine, O ye gods I how I shall dine!” t .Sec the 2d chapter of the Rudiments of Cookery, page eg.

282 BROTHS, GRAVIES, AND SOUPS. thus easily prepared ; cut a pound of bacon into slices about half an inch thick, lay it at the bottom of a soup kettle, or deep stewpan, and on this place the knuckle of veal, having first chopped the bone in two or three places, furnish it with two carrots, two turnips, a head of celery, two large onions, with two or three cloves stuck in one of them, a dozen corns of black, and the same of Jamaica pepper, and a good bundle of lemon-thyme, winter savoury, and parsley. Just cover the meat with cold water, and set it over a quick fire till it boils; having skimmed it well, remove your soup- kettle to the side of the fire, let it stew very gently for four hours, till it is quite tender; then take out the bacon and veal, and strain the soup, and set it by in a cool place till you want it, when you must take off the fat from the surface of your liquor, and decant it (keeping back the settlings at the bottom,) into a clean stewpan; put three tablespoonsful of the fat you have taken off the soup, into a small stew- pan, and mix it with four tablespoonsful of flour, pour a ladleful of soup to it, and mix it with the rest by degrees, and boil it up till it is smooth. Cut the meat and gristle of the knuckle, and the bacon into mouthfuls, and put them into the soup, and let them get warm.

GRAVIES AND SAUCES. 118 always use the best superfine velvet corks. Economy in corks is very unwise, as in order to save a mere trifle, in the price of the cork, you run the risk of losing the valuable article it is intended to preserve. It is a vulgar error, that a bottle must be well stopped, when the cork is forced down even with the mouth of it, this being a sure sign that the cork is too small, it should be re-drawn and a larger one put in. TO MAKE BOTTLE CEMENT. Half a pound black rosin, same quantity of red sealing wax, quarter oz. bees wax, melted in an earthen or iron pot; when it froths up, before all is melted and likely to boil over, stir it with a tallow candle, which will settle the froth till all is melted and fit for use. Red wax lOd. per lb. may be bought at Mr. Dewâ€™s, Blackmore Street, Clare Market. N. B. This cement is of very great use in preserving things that you wish to keep a long time, which without its help would soon spoil, from the clumsy manner the bottles are corked.

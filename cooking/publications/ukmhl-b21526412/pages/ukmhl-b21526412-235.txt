225 VEGETABLES. Dutch-oven, before a steady fire, turning it occasionally, until its tenderness be ascertained by a fork. Its flavour is highly improved, and its deep rich red colour is excpiisite; the peel will pull ofl'readily, when it is done. Parsnips — (No. 12S.) Are to be cooked just in the same manner as carrots, only give them as much w’ater as you can; they require more or less time according to their size, therefore match them in size, and you must try them by thrusting a fork into them as they are in the water; when that goes easily through, they are done enough: from half an hour to an hour, according to their size and freshness, will boil a large parsnip. Obs. —Parsnips are sometimes sent up mashed in the same w'ay as Turnips, and most cooks cut them in half before they boil them. Carrots. — (No. 129.) Let them be well washed and brushed, not scraped; half an hour is enough for young spring carrots; grown carrots must be cut in half, will take an hour and a half; and the large Sandwich kind full two hours. When done, rub off the peels with a clean coarse cloth.

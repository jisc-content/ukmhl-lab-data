MADE DISHES. 540 and easy of digestion.” Hunter’s Culina, page 117. Obs. — Meat that has been builtd down for gravies, &c. (which has heretofore been con- sidered the perquisite of the Cats,) and is completely drained of all its succulence, beaten in a mortar ivith salt, butter and spice, will make as good potted beef, as meat tliat has been baked till its moisture is quite evaporated, which it must be, or it will not keep two days. ]\Icm.—Meat that has not been previously salted, will not keep so long as that which has. Beef Cakes. — (No. 504.) If you have any cold roast beef that is under- done, mince it fine, and pound it in a marble mortar, with a little fat bacon or ham, or an anchovy ; season it with a little pepper and salt; mix well, and make it into small cakes three inches long, half as wide, and half an inch thick ; fi-y these a light brown, and serve them with good gravy. N.B. Bread crumbs and hard yolks of eggs may be added to these Cakes.

394 GRAVIES AND SAUCES. To make Gravy. As the object in making gravy is to com- pletely extract the nutritions succulence of the meat, it is necessary that the meat should be well beaten, to comminute the containing ves- sels and scored, to augment the surface to the action of the water. Take a pound of lean beef, beat it well with a rolling pin, score it in all directions, add pepper and salt, some scraped carrot, sliced onion or shallot, and allspice; put a small piece of butter at the bottom of the saucepan, and keep it over a very gentle fire for half an hour, when about a quarter pint of rich and intrinsic gravy will be obtained; add to the remaining meat as much water as will cover it, a small quantity of isinglass, and a piece of bread gradually toasted very brown; let this gently simmer for an hour, or till more than half is evaporated; strain it, and add it to the former.

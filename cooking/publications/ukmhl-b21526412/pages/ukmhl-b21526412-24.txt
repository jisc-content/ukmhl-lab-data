Every man must consult his Stomach ; whatever agrees with that perfectly well, is whole- some for him, whilst it continues to do so, when- ever natural appetite calls for food. Celsus spoke very sensibly when he said, “ that a healthy man under his own government, ought not to tie himself up by strict rules, nor to abstain from any sort of food ; that he ought sometimes to fast and sometimes to feast.” When ap- plied to eating, nothing is more true than that “ Bmarvm remm, cnmiictudo pcssima est.” The author of this work wishes he had leisure to devote more time to the subject. An ingenious chemist, and an intelligent cook, might form a very complete work, by taking for their text Dr. George Pearson’s admirably arranged catalogues of Food, Drink, and Seasoning ; the most comprehensive abstract of this subject we have ever seen. This epitome was printed for his Lectures on Therapeutics, &c. which the author attended in l801. No regimen of life can be laid down that will suit every body: “ Try all (lie Iioiiiities of this fertile globe, There is not siieh a salutary food .A.s suits will) every stomach." 1)r. \misTRONT.’S rl’ t I’/Pvfxcrr.'n^ Ilra’lii, hook ii. line Ija.

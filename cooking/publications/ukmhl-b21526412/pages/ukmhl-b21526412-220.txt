BROILING. 210 The Inside of a Sirloin of Beef. —(No. y6.) Cut out the inside of a sirloin of beef, close to the bone, in steaks nearly a quarter of an inch thick; take off all the skin, and season it with pepper and salt; then warm an ounce of butter on a plate, just enough to melt it a little, (but not to make it into a thin oil), nnx the yolk of an egg with it, dip the steaks in on both sides, and then in fine bread crumbs; lay them on a clean gridiron, over a clear slow fire; (if the fire is sharp, the bread crumbs will be burnt before the beef is done); when you turn them lay them on a dish, to catch the gravy ; when they are dressed, put them on a hot dish with their own gravy, and a spoonful of mushroom catsup. ^ Fowl or Chicken. — (No. <)7.) Pick and truss a fowl the same as for broiling, cut it open down the back, wipe the inside clean with a cloth, season it with a little white pepper and salt, and lay it on a gridiron over a clear slow fire, with the inside of the fowl towards the fire; turn it in about ten minutes, and it will take about ten minutes more to broil it till it is a fine brown. Lay it on a hot dish, pickled mushrooms, or mushroom sauce thrown

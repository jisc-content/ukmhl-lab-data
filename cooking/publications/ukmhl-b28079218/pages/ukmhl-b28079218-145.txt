To grin a chop or steak it must be placed on a gridiron without any pepper or salt, and exposed to a very hot, bright fire, turned frequently, but on no account must a fork be put into the meat, as this will let out the gravy; if grilling tongs are not at hand to turn the meat it is best to use a spoon.

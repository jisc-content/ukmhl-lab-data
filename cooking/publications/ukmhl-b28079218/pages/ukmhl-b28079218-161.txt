161 TO GRILL. The gas burner used for this purpose is generally larger than the rest; it is made reversible so that the flame may be turned over to face the top of the oven, or something is supplied by which the heat of the burner is deflected, grilling always being done in gas cooking ranges underneath the gas, and not in any case over the top of the burner j if the latter is attempted a most disagreeable smell will be caused, besides the stopping up of the burners, causing them to light back in the pipes. The rule for grilling is to place the chop, steak, fish, &c., over a red-hot fire, or an equivalent. The equivalent is got by lighting the large burner, turning it over or placing the deflector over it to throw down the heat, and allowing it to get red-hot. Place the chop or steak on a grid inside a dripping tin (this is supplied with the Range), place this underneath the red-hot burner ; when done on the one side, turn over with the grilling tongs or a spoon. Never use a fork, as this will make holes in the meat, and the gravy will be lost, and, in consequence, the steak spoiled. The secret of a good grilled chop or steak is to accomplish the grilling without the loss of any gravy. When grilled on the under side, serve at once with a pat of plain or Maitre d’Hotel butter (page 116) on the top. A steak or chop about one inch thick will take seven to eight minutes. Salt should never be put on the meat before it is grilled, as this has a tendency to draw out the gi’avy. Bacon or ham may be grilled in the same way, always removing the rind first. A kettle or sauce- pan may be boiled over the top of the burner at the same time as the grilling is being done, so that the whole of the heat produced by the gas is utilized.

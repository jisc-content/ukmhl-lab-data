127 No. 299. BREAD. 6 lbs. flour 1^ oz. German yeast 1 dessertspoonful salt Some water Crumble the yeast into a basin, add to it one teaspoonful sugar and the same of flour, pour over it half a pint of luke- warm water, cover and set in a warm place to rise ; mix the salt with the flour, make a well in the centre, mix the yeast together with the water; pour into the flour with a little more lukewarm water, stir in a little flour and allow this to stand 1^ hours, covered; add enough warm water to make into a dough, knead lightly with the hands until the dough leaves them quite clean ; turn the smooth side uppermost, cut across, cover, and leave in a warm place to rise, two hours: divide, and knead slightly, make into loaves, allow it to rise 10 to 15 minutes. Bake in a hot oven until it is risen and slightly browned, then reduce the heat until it is bakedâ€”three-quarters of an hour should be allowed for a 2 lb. loaf. If bread is required in a hurry, the yeast may be added and kneaded without allowing it to stand. The principal thing in making bread is to get good yeast, and take care that the water is lukewarm. Rub the butter into the flour, add the salt and baking powder, mix thoroughly; then stir in the milk and knead lightly; divide into two, roll each piece into a round, and cut in four ; paint over the top of each with a little milk or egg. Bake 6 to 10 minutes in a rather quick oven. 1 oz. sugar and 2 oz. sultanas may be added, if liked.

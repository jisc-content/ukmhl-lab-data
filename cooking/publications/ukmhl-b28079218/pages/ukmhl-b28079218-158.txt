The time will depend upon the size of the loaf; a 21b. loaf will take from 40 to 45 minutes. Sometimes it will be found necessary to reverse the bread from one shelf to the other, as the top part of the oven is the hottest TO BAKE CAKES. Heat the oven as described, arrange the shelves as near the centre of the oven as possible, turn the gas down to one-half, put in the cakes, and when risen and slightly browned, turn the gas down as lota as possible until they are finished. This is most important, as many cakes will take several hours to bake, and as they contain an amount of sugar they are more likely to bum. For cakes that require three or four hours baking, the gas may be put out entirely for the last half hour, and then the oven will be found hot enough to cook them through. TO BAKE PASTRY. For puff pastry it is advisable to bake it alone, not only in the gas oven, but in any kind of oven. The oven must be very well heated, the gas on full for 16 minutes. Put in the pastry, turn down the gas to three-quarters. Puff pastry must be baked quickly. Patty cases should take about 10 to 16 minutes.

146 3s. 6d. per 1,000 feet, it is calculated that the whole of the cooking for a middle-class family may be done at a cost not exceeding 2^d. per day, whereas to do the same amourit of work in a Coal Range, including keeping in the fire during the intervals, would cost 7d. to Is. per day ; thus it will be seen that the cost of gas for cooking is only about one-third that of coal. Another very important item is the question of economy in food cooked by gas. For example, a joint weighing lOlbs. when cooked by a Coal Range yields 61bs. when done, but when cooked by a Gas Range yields 7^1bs., showing a differ- ence of l^lbs. in favour of the Gas Range; so that this item alone would more than cover the cost of gas. And according to our best authorities on the subject, meat cooked by gas retains more of its juices, and in consequence becomes more nutritious and wholesome than when cooked by coal. Then there is the saving of time, which we are often told is money. The cooking operations occupy less time and require less attention than under the old system ; for instance, a break- fast for a medium family, say coffee, chops, steaks, or bacon, eggs, and toast, may be prepared easily in 16 minutes ; and when we recall its cleanliness, coolness, instant readiness at all hours, the ease of its regulation and its reliable action, we are not surprised at the verdict of those who now possess those excellent inventions when they say, “ They would not be without them for double or treble their first cost.”

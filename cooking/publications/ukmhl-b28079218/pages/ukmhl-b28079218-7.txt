PEEFACE. -:o:- At the request of many Ladies who have attended my Lectures on Cookery, I have been induced to write the following pages, and, in doing so, I have striven to give the information as plainly and practi- cally as possible. The Kecipes will not be found High-Class, but Domestic and Economical, and, I trust, useful. I have added some remarks on Cooking by Gras, together with a few instructions upon the use of the Gras Rangeâ€”not because it is absolutely necessary to the success of the dishes which may be prepared from the Recipes, but because my personal experience has taught me its extreme utility and convenience.

163 TO CLEAN THE RANGE. See that the grid shelves are washed after roasting meat. The sides of the oven must occasionally be wiped or washed. The enamelled oven is easily washed and kept clean; to lime- wash the oven occasionally is also a good plan if not enamelled. The burners must never be blackleaded, as this is likely to stop them up and become burnt and bard, and very difficult to remove. Should they become stopped at any time, they may be cleaned with a skewer, knife, or a brush. UTENSILS TO BE USED ON THE GAS RANGE. Tin, copper, or enamelled saucepans should be selected for use on the Gas Range, being bghter; consequently, the heat penetrates more quickly, and, in the end, they are the least costly. The pans should be kept as clean on the outside as in the inside, and on no account should sooty or greasy pans be used over the gas burners ; if they are, a most disagreeable smell will be caused with the soot and "^ease burning on the outside of the pan, besides the risk of the bits falling from the pans and stopping up the bmners and causing them to light back in the pipes. Should this lighting back in the pipes occur at any time, the gas must at once be put out and re-lighted. When the gas burner is properly lighted it bums blue ; if lit back it burns white, and will smoke the pans and smell very disagreeably.

Should the joint be too large to lay on the grid shelf, it may be suspended from the top by means of one or two hooks, which are generally supplied with the Bange,but on no account must a joint be placed in a dripping tin, or it will be baked, and not roasted. TO ROAST GAME, FOWLS, &c. Observe the same rules as in roasting a joint, only it will be necessary to baste the birds occasionally, and a good plan is to tie over the breasts a piece of fat bacon or buttered paper so as to keep the skin moist. Remove this about 16 minutes before they are done, dust with flour, turn on the gas a little, and brown quickly. THE HOT PLATE. This is generally arranged about six inches above the top of the oven, and contains a variety of burners suitable for. grilling^ toasting, boiling, stewing, &c. The space between the oven and hot plate will be found most useful for heating plates and dishes, also for keeping some things warm.

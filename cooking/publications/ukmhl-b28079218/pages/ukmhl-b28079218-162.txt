162 TO MAKE TOAST. Arrange the burner as for grilling, and see that it is quite hot; cut the bread, which must not be too new, evenly, place it on the grid used for grilling, or in a tin supplied for the purpose, place this underneath the burner until brown, turn over and brown the underside; it should only take about 1J minutes to toast the bread on both sides. If the burner is a large one, two or three rounds of bread may be toasted at the same time, also a kettle or saucepan boiled over the top, the same as when gi-illing. TO BOIL, SIMMER, &c. To boil a saucepan, light the burner and place over it the pan, selecting a burner that the flame will well cover the bottom only of the pan; when boiling, if the contents are required to simmer or stew any time, turn off the large bm-ner and light the smallest one, turning on the least jet of gas, and place the pan over it; by this means it is an easy matter to keep a pan simmering for any length of time without any fear of it boiling. TO HEAT WATER FOR THE KITCHEN, &c. One of the bm-ners may be used for this purpose, or a better plan is to secure a range with a boiler attached. These are arranged with a burner underneath, so that they can be used separately from the range at any time.

88 become brown, then add the flour, milk, cream, and season- ing; simmer slowly five minutes. Eoll the pastry out a quarter of an inch thick, cut in rounds about 2^ inches in dia- meter, wet a small cutter about three-quarters of an inch in diameter, and cut half way through the centres ; roll out a little pastry very thin, and cut in rounds with a cutter 1 inch in diameter ; these are for lids for the patties ; paint over the top of each with a little beaten egg, place on a baking sheet, and bake 10 to 15 minutes in a hot oven; the lids will only require about five or six minutes to bake. The patties should rise about two inches high; when done, take a skewer and remove the centres, fill with the patty mixture, place a lid on the top of each, and serve. If there is time, it is a good plan after the patties are cut to allow them to stand half-an-hour in a cool place before baking them. Cooked chicken may be used for the above, it must be finely minced and added after the sauce is made, and only allowed to warm through after the chicken is added. No. 203.

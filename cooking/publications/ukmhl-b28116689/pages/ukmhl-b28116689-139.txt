POULTRY AND GAME. 125 DUCK, ROAST. No. 1S3. Truss, lard, and roast before a quick fire. A duck should have the gravy in it, that is, pink at the bone ; if dried up it is spoilt, GROUSE, ROAST. No. 184. Trim, truss, rub with butter or cover with slice of fat bacon, and roast before a clear fire for half an hour. Serve with good bread sauce made with cream (this is half the battle), and some fried bread-crumbs. GROUSE, EILLET OF. No. 185. Roast and fillet as in direction for Filleting (No. 162). GROUSE, DEVILLED. No. 186. Fillet as in receipt for Filleting (No. 162), cook and serve as in Receipt No. 173, and add what is left of the sauce the same way as in receipt quoted (No. 173). GROUSE, GRILLED. No. 187. Fillet in the same way as the foregoing receipt, put in a wire gridiron, rub with butter, dust with pepper and salt and grill over a clear fire. Grouse are such excellent birds that I think this the best way of cooking them for break- fast ; there is no sauce to destroy their flavour. GUINEA FOWL, ROAST. No. 188. The same as Chicken (No. 165). GUINEA FOWL, DEVILLED. No, 189. It can be filleted, and cooked in the same three ways as Chicken (No. 172, No. 173, No. 174).

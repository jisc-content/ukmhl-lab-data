Fill the pot-pourri dish (which should be of an oblong shape, about seven inches wide in the centre, twelve inches long and six inches deep) with the fillets, and garnish, and cover it with a thick covering of flour and water paste made very thick so as to hermetically seal it. It should be braised in a sloiv oven for four hours and allowed to get cold, the covering should be taken off, the fat, if any, on the top be removed, it should then be warmed and filled up with stock. The trimmings should be stewed in the same way as in Receipt No. 159, and the stock therefrom poured into the pot-pourri.

CHAPTER II. BREAKFASTS FOR LADIES, AND GENTLEMEN OF SEDEN- TARY OCCUPATION AND OF A CERTAIN AGE. It will be only necessary for the Author to say a very few words as a preface to this chapter, and those to explain why he has classified the ladies with men of such occupation and age. Ladies as a rule are much wiser, much more abstemious, and capable of practising much more self-denial in the feeding business than the male sex ; the Author frequently admires the way in which they pass dish after dish, which men seldom, very seldom, have the wisdom or strength of mind to pass ; they rarely, too, eat meat for breakfast. He thinks, therefore, that it is wiser and kinder to put the men out of temptation, and although he may raise a hornetsâ€™ nest about his ears he must say that men who take no exercise, or who are over fifty years of age, should, if they wish to preserve their health, and avoid what the Author is told is not a particularly pleasant pain to endure, viz. the gout, never eat meat more than once a day; and for this reason he strongly advises them to adhere to the sort of breakfasts he recommends, and join the ladies in their abstemiousness and self-denial. All meat will therefore be excluded from the Bills of Fare given for the fair sex, and gentlemen who come under the above-named categories. Bread, of all sorts, buns, jams, fruits, and table requisites must be supplied in the same manner as for large parties in Chapter I., which it would be mere repetition to give again.

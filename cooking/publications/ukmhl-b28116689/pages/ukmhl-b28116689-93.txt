STOCKS, SAUCES. 79 process : Whisk the whites of two eggs in a pint of water, warm up the jelly, and pour it into it, stir it well in, allow it to boil a quarter of an hour, and strain through a jelly-bag. When it is clear, warm it up and flavour with some sprays of green tarragon and the juice of three or four lemons, GLAZE. No. 30. Glaze is made by reducing stock by means of boiling to the substance of liquid glue ; when it begins to thicken, it should simmer gently until it is fit for use, which is when it drops from the spoon like a thick syrup. When required for use, the basin in which it is should be placed in hot water to warm, and the quantity required for use taken out with a spoon. No salt should be used in stock intended for reduction to glaze, as the salt does not reduce with the stock, BROWN THICKENING, OR ROUX. No. 31. Put half a pound of clarified butter (that is, butter cleared of all milk by boiling) into a stewpan, dissolve it, and stir in with a wooden spoon half a pound of flour until quite smooth; put it on a slow fire and let it simmer for an hour, or until it becomes a nice brown colour, stirring it all the time so as to prevent its catching the bottom of the stewpan, and then put it in a basin for use. It depends greatly on the heat of the fire how long it is before it is a nice brown, but if it is burnt it is spoilt. A dessert-spoonful will thicken a pint of gravy. WHITE THICKENING. No. 32. The same as above, only the fire over which it is mixed must be a very slow one, and care must be taken not to allow it to become coloured. G

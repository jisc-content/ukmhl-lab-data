BREAKFASTS FOR LARGE PARTIES. j be served at small tables, and that each guest should order, from a Bill of Fare, sent up to his room when called, what he requires, and name his own time, as at a club or military mess ; or, if preferred, in parties of four or six. The liberty of the subject is less interfered with by this method ; the small breakfast eater is not bored by waiting until the more hearty one is satisfied, or in wondering how much longer, in racing parlance, he can possibly stay. The Author feels sure there are many, especially ladies, who read these lines will remember how frequently they have schemed to avoid sitting out so long a meal; how they have had to put up with everything being cold by coming down very late, and to make every excuse, except the true one, for putting in so late an appearance. Two other excellent reasons suggest themselves for recommending that breakfasts should be served in this manner: firstly, it is more economical ; when twenty people have to be provided for in a house where every- thing is well done, sufficient of each dish for each person should be served, and more than half is frequently un- touched and probably wasted. Secondly, and / think the most unanswerable argument in its favour, and the best of all possible reasons why this meal should not unnecessarily be prolonged, is, that the post in the country generally comes in about this time, and if letters require replies every minute is of consequence to those who are going out on business or pleasure. To save repetition in the Bills of Fare the Author begs to observe that tea, coffee, and cocoa should be served at each breakfast; that brown and white bread should be handed round, and the loaves if cottage be cut straight through, from top to bottom, in eight 'divisions, making sixteen portions; that hot rolls, toast, muffins, fancy bread and buns, and jams and fruits, should decorate the table; and that pepper and salt, a sugar- basin, a cream-jug, and a butter-dish should be within reach of each person.

The quantity to be used is a some- what disputed point; in cafe au lait an ounce for a breakfast cup is the usual measure, but if cafe ?ioir is to be good that quantity is very insufficient.

Coffee machines, like the kinds of berries, are endless, but I really think “Adams’ Coffee Percolator” is the best; it is less liable to get out of order than any other, and with common care makes very good coffee. Directions for Use. Remove the cover, take out the percolator and put the coffee in the well on top of the strainer; return the percolator, pour in the amount of boiling water required, put on the cover and put the pot on the side of the fire until the water has drained through. Remove the well part from the top of the pot and let the coffee get very hot before serving or pouring into the coffee-pot,^^which is to be sent to the table. For “ Cafe au Lait, send in with the coffee a jug of boiling milk, and let me beg of the mistress, master, or servant who fills the cups to take the coffee-pot in one hand, the boiling milk in the other, and pour both at the same time into the cup; it mixes so much better and the flavour is greatly improved thereby. . , , For “ Cafe Noir,” if the coffee is good, strong, and hot, nothing is required except a little crushed sugar-candy, but as ''somepeople'’ take cream witli it, I suppose I must say, “ hand round cream.”

CHAPTER XVII. MEATS, MEAT PIES AND PUDDINGS, FILLETS OF BEEF BROILED A LA FRANCAISE. No. 120. Cut as many fillets, three-quarters of an inch thick, as are required from a rump fillet of beef, and broil over a quick fire, but not too close to it, turning frequently ; rub with a bit of butter, and serve with fried potato chips. FILLETS OF BEEF A LA DIABLE. No, I2I. Boiled in the same way as No. 120, and pour over on an entree dish half a pint of Devil Sauce (No. 44). BEEFSTEAK. No. 122. This is a very difficult dish to serve really good in a small house. A rump-steak to be good should be cut from a well-hung rump, and cooked immediately. Butchers out of London do not hang their meat, and, except in a large house, the consumption is not sufficient to hang a rump of beef, especially for rump-steaks. I will, however, give the proper directions, and it will not be my fault if they are not carried out. Cut a steak one and a half inch thick from a well-hung rump of beef, beat it, put it between a wire gridiron, and broil over a quick fire, but not too near, or the outside will be burnt, the inside raw. It will take about five minutes to do each side. Rub it with butter, a sprinkling of salt, a squeeze of lemon, and put it on a very hot dish and very hot cover; and there are few better things.

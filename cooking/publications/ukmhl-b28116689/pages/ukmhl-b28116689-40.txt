LUNCHEONS. CHAPTER IV. ORDINARY HOUSE LUNCHEONS. How to commence this chapter the Author hardly knows, this being the ladies’ meal. Oh that some fairy would assist him in arriving at their ideas, their wishes, their desires ! Sorry will he be if his estimate of their powers, his Bills of Fare are not to their taste. Breakfast not being their meal, and dinner in many cases only very slightly patronised, nature demands, if health is to be retained, that one meal in the day should be a substantial one. Why they select the middle of the day for this repast, perhaps some fair but kindly critic may enlighten the Author before his Second Edition, and so assist in giving the real reason. Being at present somewhat in the clouds as to their taste, the Author will endeavour to give his ideas of what good ordinary luncheons should consist of; he is totally opposed to the system of a hot dinner of three courses in the middle of the day, he thinks an entree, a roast, and a pudding quite sufficient, and on that basis will his Bills of Fare be drawn up; and as this meal so nearly resembles dishes used at dinner, he must request his readers to refer to the “ Pytchley Book of Refined Cookery,” for instructions how to serve any dishes in the Bills of Fare not given in this work. Vegetables and salads are omitted from the Bills of Fare for the same reason as stated in the “ Pytchley Cookery Book,” page 5, viz.; that the cook will be much better able to select each morning what are ready for use, than he possibly could, climates and seasons making so great a difference.”

5. Hunting Luncheons. INTRODUCTION. The “ Pytchley Book of Refined Cookery ” having been so well received by the Public, the Author is encouraged, with some diffidence, to give his ideas of what good Break- fasts and Luncheons should consist; and, although he does not intend to go largely into Ball Suppers, he thinks perhaps a few menus and a few hints on that subject may be useful. He proposes to treat on the various subjects in nine different chapters, giving a certain number of Bills of Fare in each, and at the conclusion of those chapters Receipts for the various dishes will be given. He has divided Breakfasts into three chapters, under the following headings : 1. Breakfasts for Large Parties. 2. Breakfasts for Ladies and Men of Sedentary Habits and Pursuits. 3. Breakfasts for Sportsmen and those of active habits. Luncheons he has divided into five chapters, viz.: ✓ 4. Ordinary House Luncheons.

FISH AU GRATINS. 95 HADDOCK, BROILED. No. S3. Split, remove the bone, cut off the head, and put between a wire gridiron, a haddock about one or two pounds weight, pepper and salt, and broil before a clear fire; rub with soft butter, and serve. Allow one haddock for two people. KIPPERED HADDOCK. No. 84. Skin, trim, and bone a kippered haddock, cut it into fillets, about three inches square, and fry in butter for three or four minutes, and dish them up on an entree dish ; pour the butter from the pan over them, and serve. Allow a moderate-sized kipper for every two people. HERRING, BROILED. No. 85. Scale, wash, take out the gills and eyes of one herring for each person, dry them, and grill them on a reversible gridiron for about ten minutes; pepper and salt them, and serve very hot. KEDGEREE. No. 86. Boil two ounces of rice, put it in a sieve to dry; when dry put it in a stewpan with half a pound of any fish over from dinner, pulled into flakes, or a bloater boned and pulled into small pieces, two hard-boiled eggs cut in quarters or in pieces the size and shape of dice, an ounce and a half of butter, and a tea-spoonful of pepper and salt; simmer over a clear fire until very hot, stirring with a wooden spoon, and be careful not to break the egg or fish. For a change, a dessert-spoonful of dry curry powder can be sprinkled over the mixture, which I think greatly improves it. BLOATERS. No. 87. Cut off the head and tail, split in half, cutting down the back, take out the back-bone, broil over a clear fire, and serve on hot buttered toast. H

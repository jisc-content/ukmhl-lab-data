When the batter has risen, and begins to crack on the surface, add three tea-spoonfuls of salt, and mix in the whole of the flour with your hands, adding sufficient tepid soft water to enable you to work it into a smooth firm dough, knead it well with your fists until it becomes firm, sift some flour over it, cover it with a cloth and allow it to rise again for half an hour.

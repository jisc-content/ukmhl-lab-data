CELERY. 1 head celery. | ^ pint Bechamel sauce. Wash and scrape the celery very thoroughly; cut it into lengths, and tie it into bundles. Put them in a pan, cover with cold water, and bring to the boil; skim and strain off the water. This blanching removes the strong taste and whitens the celery. Put sufficient milk and water into a pan to almost cover the celery; add a pinch of salt. When boiling, put in celery and stew till tender, about one hour. Drain thoroughly; dish on a square of toast, and coat with the Bechamel sauce.

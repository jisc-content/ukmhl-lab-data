The custom of setting several glasses before each person for the different wines that are served, belongs only to the nineteenth century. In the eighteenth century, the glass was dipped, at each new wine, into small earthenware bowls filled with water, and which were placed upon the table in reach of the guests. The cups that kings drank from were of metal; gold for choice, heavily set with jewels. The origin of the word “ tumbler ” is, that formerly these drinking vessels were made with rounded bottoms, and could not be made to stand up. The idea was to make the drinker empty his glass promptly, which, in olden times, when hard drinking was in fashion, and thought to be the correct thing, were generally made of silver, and when they became empty, they were placed on the table, mouth downwards, when instantly they flew back into place again, as if asking to be filled again.

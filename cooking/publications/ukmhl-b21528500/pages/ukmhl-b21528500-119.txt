107 ANCIENT COOKERY. SHELL-FISH was a passion among the ancients; quite late in all feasts, oysters, cockles, and mussels, and periwinkles, would be introduced. A passage from the late Professor Yonge’s translation from a poem celebrating the marriage of Hebe says : “ There is the cockle which we call the Tellis, Believe me, that is most delicious meat.” Homer mentions the oyster, and Diodes pronounces the best of all shell-fish to be mussels, oysters, scallops, and cockles. “ A little polypus or a small cuttle-fish, a crab, a craw-fish, oysters, cockles, limpets and periwinkles.” Onions, olives, and garlic, figs, herbs, and tunny cutlets were loved by the ancients.

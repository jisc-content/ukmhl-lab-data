82 ANCIENT COOKERY BOOKS. Spain has the honour of having furnished the first cookery book, entitled “ Libro de Cozina compuesto por Ruberto da Nola,” and was printed about 1590, though the first attempt at a cookery book was made in the twelfth century by Alexander Neckham. Then the Liber Cure Cocoriam or the form of cury, a vellum roll, is supposed to have been written by the master cook of Richard II., who reigned from 1377 to 1399. The roll comprises 196 recipes. In it, directions are given to enable one “ to make common pottages and common meats for the household as they should be made carefully and wholesomely.” This roll presents the earliest mention of olive oil, cloves, mace, and gourds.

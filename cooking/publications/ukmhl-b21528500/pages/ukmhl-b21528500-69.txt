57 Gourmets, Gourmands, and Gluttons, kitchen and bringing me the remains of that polypus ! ” Lucullus, that wealthy Roman, who lived B.C. 110-57, noted for his banquets and self-indul- gence, never dined more sumptuously than when he dined alone, and on one occasion, when a superb supper had been prepared for him, being asked who were his guests, he replied, “ Lucullus will sup to-night with Lucullus,” and on another occasion he upbraided his cook for serving him with a cheap repast, which, when “ Lucullus dined with Lucullus,” cost only one hundred pounds. Longfellow, in his Drinking Song, quotes him,— “ Ne’er Falernian threw a richer Light upon Lucullus’ tables.” The great Charlemagne was a great epicure, and took immense interest in the management of his table. Mark Antony was also a cele- brated glutton, and it is written of him that he had roasted eight whole boars for supper.

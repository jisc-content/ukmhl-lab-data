PREFACE —o—• It having been suggested to me some years ago to write a short treatise on the origin of cookery, with gastronomical anecdotes, I have followed the suggestion, and venture to offer to the public this little volume, trusting it may prove both interesting and amusing. The facts and recipes have been gleaned from old culinary works found in the British Museum, and old diaries. I am also indebted to the Gentleman's Magazine, whose pages I have consulted, as well as those of Howe, Brand, Chambers, and old French books.

100 ANCIENT FOODS. ANCIENT epicures delighted in fish ; the variety of them was immense, and many not known to our tables. One of their favourites was the anthea, which was looked upon as a sacred fish. Aristotle states “ that where the antheas are found no beasts nor fish of prey is ever seen ” ; and the sponge- gatherers used them as guides, and would dive fearlessly into the waters they frequent, and call them the sacred fish. Icesins says, “He was an excellent fish, with very solid meat, full of delicious juice, and easy of digestion.” In “Table Talk ” we read of an ancient fish much too holy for even a gourmet, the pompilus, which was supposed to guide the mariner through the dangers of the deep.

Ebe Hrt of Cooftcrp. 20 Cookery in the times of Charles II. is famous for the names of Cheffinch and Chaubert, to whose skill Sir Walter Scott has in his Waverley described the dinner prepared for Smith,Gaulesse, and Peveril of the Peak, at the little Derbyshire inn. “ We could bring no chauffettes with any convenience, and even Chaubert is nothing unless his dishes are tasted in the very moment of projection. Come, uncover, and let us see what he has done for us. Hum! ha ! ay ! squab pigeons, wild fowl, young chickens, venison cutlets, and a space in the centre wet, alas! by a gentle tear from Chaubert’s eye, where should have been the soup aux ecrevisses. The zeal of that poor fellow is ill repaid by his paltry ten coins per month.” In the last century the middle-class English had a hatred of made dishes, and loved to feed only upon joints and puddings, varied now and then with a little fish or poultry cooked very plainly. Some of the favourite menus were, for the first course, at the top a pig with prune sauce, at the bottom a calfs tongue and brains.

Zbc art of Goohcrg. 2 ledged that good cookery deserves to be classed as one, for the world owes more to it than to the doctorâ€™s aid, therefore the power of the cook to make or mar health should be considered. It is most necessary to call attention to the great influence on health exercised by cooks. A good dinner not only gives pleasure, but it satisfies hunger. A hungry man is generally irritable and cantankerous, and a badly fed man is always miserable, which makes it evident to everyone that good cooking opens both heart and mind. Savages who had to hunt and fish for their food, and field labourers at work all day long, ccm and do digest their food prepared in the roughest way; but that same food, if eaten by students and clerks, etc., would soon cause that scourge indigestion, which is the bane of so many people, and often the primary cause of fatal illnesses. It may therefore be interesting to give my readers a short history of cooking from the be- ginning, and of the progress of civilisation in cookery.

Probably salt was the first seasoning discovered, for we read of salt in Gen. xiv., and this seems to be necessary, especially to those who were advanced in age, whose palates had lost their vigour, and whose digestions were weak, and thence came the use of soups and savoury messes. Thus we read that Jacob made such palatable pottage that Esau purchased a mess of it at the extravagant price of his birthright. And Isaac, before he died, required Esau to make him some savoury meat such as “ his soul loved,” and bequeathed to him a blessing for it. That Esau was the first cook, as many say, cannot be asserted, for Abraham gave orders to dress a fatted calf, but Esau is the first person mentioned who made any advances beyond plain boiling and roasting, though we find his mother Rebecca was accomplished with the skill of making savoury meat as well.

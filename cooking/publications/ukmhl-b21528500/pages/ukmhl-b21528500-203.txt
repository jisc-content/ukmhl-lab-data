191 Cultnarv? proverbs. As dry as the remainder biscuit after a voyage. Take heed of enemies reconciled, and meat twice boiled. Hungry men think the cook lazy. Prettiness makes no pottage. The kingâ€™s cheese goes half-way in parings. All should profit by the cook except the apothecary. Court the onion and flee the doctor. A wise cook fondles his fire. True economy in the kitchen has heaven for its banker. He who eateth without drink, buildeth his wall without mortar. Fast well, feed well. The lean buyer maketh the fat seller. Wise counsel cometh not from an empty stomach. Peace hideth herself under the lid of the well- managed pot. Neither the nibbler nor the glutton knoweth the value of the feast.

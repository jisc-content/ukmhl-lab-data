ftbe art of Cooken?. 192 Diplomacy lieth under the dish-cover. All straw is alike to the hungry donkey. A bad dinner is often redeemed by a good salad. Roast beef and well-cooked fish betray a wise cook. A good saver is a good server. Two weak evilsâ€”age and hunger. THE END. Printed by Cowan & Co., Limited, Perth.

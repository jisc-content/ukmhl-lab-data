123 Bncicnt IRecipcs. Kidney Pancakes. Take a veal kidney and parboil till tender ; then chop it small with the yolks of three hard- boiled eggs. Season with dates and raisins cut small, cinnamon, saffron, and a little salt. To make the covering, use a dozen eggs well beaten together with a little butter. Fry in the same manner as pancakes. Lay the mince-meat in them, turn the pancake over, and fry again. To make Buttered Loaves. Take the yolks of twelve eggs and six whites and a quarter of a pint of yeast. When you have beaten the eggs well, strain them with the yeast into a dish, then put to it a little salt, and two rases of ginger beaten very small. Then put flour to it till it comes to a high paste that will not cleave ; then you must roll it upon your hands, and afterwards put it into a warm cloth, and let it lie there a quarter of an hour, then make it up in little loaves. Bake it again.

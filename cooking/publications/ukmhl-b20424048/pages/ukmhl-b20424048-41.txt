THE PRIKCirLES OF COOKING. 35 TO SIMMER. {See above, To BoiL.) There is one simple reason for plunging meat into boiling water (212° Fahr.). By so doing the albumen coagulates, an envelope is formed which prevents the escape of the internal juice and excludes the water. This attained, the meat need only be kept in a temperature of from 158° to 165° to unite the best conditions for eating.—{Liebig.) I insist, therefore, that it is misleading to use the term " boiled" to what is simmered, although we may still be remote from the process of stewing, which involves less water, and that never brought to boiling-point, a smaller pan, and a still less degree of heat Simmering Eggs. Precisely the same principle of simmering may be applied to the cooking of an egg. Put it into a deep saucepan on the point of boiling, let it boil, take it off the fire immediately and let it stand on the side of the stove for five minutes from the time of first putting it in. So done, it will be hard nowhere and raw nowhere. An egg kept boiling at a galloping pace for the conventional three minutes and a half will have a fine hard crust of albumen (the white), but the yolk may possibly be raw. The following observations by Mr. Mattieu Williams on the cooking of an egg still further bear out my contention in favour of simmering, as opposed to the boiling process. " By the ordinary method of the three minutes' immer- sion in continually boiling water, the white of the egg becomes hard and indigestible before the yolk is fairly warmed, and half a minute too much, or half a minute too little, will nearly ruin the operation. Cockney cooks know very little concerning new-laid eggs, but farmhouse cooks are well aware that a new-laid egg demands nearly a D 2

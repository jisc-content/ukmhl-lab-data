82 THE PRINCIPLES OI LOOKING. amusing way, recounts that, failing everything, he at last got a landlord to lend him a punch-bowl, in which to make a salad. As in the case of sauces, the rules laid down for the compilation of this Handbook preclude me from giving you general recipes. I am obliged to stick to principles, and I will endeavour to explain to you the general principles which underlie the preparation of a salad. These are—I, that something of a fatty or oily nature should be applied ; 2, that you should have a condiment of salt, sugar, pepper (red or black) • and that, 3, you should apply an acid (vinegar or lemon) to temper and amalgamate these elements.

49 THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING. TO STEW. (Made Dishes and Sauces^ Time and the application of heat in a moderate form is the basis of all success in stews, hashes, ragouts, Irish stew, curries, and made dishes, &c.; and let no one despise " made dishes," because the term has in some way obtained a dis- agreeable tincture of vulgarity. It has been well observed that the national dishes which constitute the fare of mil- lions of men are nothing more or less than " made dishes ;" witness the Irish stew, the Scotch brose and haggis, the olla podrida of Spain, the curry of India, and the pillaw of Persia, where princesses study the art of cookery to the great advantage of their guests. The above list, with a certain pretension to accuracy, has something rhetorical about it. The Irish stew does not belong to Ireland, and if we could really say that it was a true English dish, we should not have to seek further for something answering to the olla podrida of Spain or the pot-au-feu of France to represent the greatest nation (boast- ing suppressed) that the world has ever seen. But Irish stew, good as it is, does not represent a permanent dish among us. Many of us might wish that it did, and that, as a matter of fact, enter into whatever inn or hostel we might, that, at any rate, as a toothsome dish should be ready for us. Were it permitted me to philosophise, nothing could be more curious than to reflect on this fact, that we have no such national dish. If Henri IV. justly gained popular applause for the mere expression of a wish that every Frenchman should have a fowl for his pot-au-feu, how much better it would be if one could devise some national dish that might suit all tastes. I am far from thinking this an impossibility. I do not think it should be quite an Irish stew. I think that fewer potatoes and some cabbage might enter into it I am lost between my admiration of mutton and my leaning [H. 9-] E

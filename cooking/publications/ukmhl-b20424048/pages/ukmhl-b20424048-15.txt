9 THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING. much the same style of victuals as the rest of the civilized world. The introduction of iron pots and pit-coal firing has largely to answer for the sorry pass to which the culinary art has come here." Of course, the writer referred more particularly to pit-coal firing in open ranges. For the same reasons, economy of heat and cleanliness, gas-stoves are much to be commended, and the existence of one or two jets in combination with the usual kitchener is of great value where you want to have your stock-pots constantly at work.

There are pieces of meat where the simmering process will come in. Tlu Frying-pan. Of all the utensils of the kitchen, this is the most common, the most world-pervading, and yet is constructed in defiance of the rules that govern the process of frying. The frying-pan of commerce—I mean by that what you can buy at the ordinary ironmonger's—is never deep enougL A false economy is invariably practised in the matter of the fat, which should completely cover most articles to be fried, and, when used, be strained off into hot water.

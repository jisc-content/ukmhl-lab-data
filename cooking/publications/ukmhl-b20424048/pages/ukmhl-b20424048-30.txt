THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING. 24 I ounce of fresh German yeast; l pinch of salt. Mix the yeast with half a pint of the liquid smoothly into a cream ; stir this into the flour with a wooden spoon, and add the remainder of the liquid when thoroughly mixed. Knead it well, and put it into a tin properly buttered. Set it near the fire for tiventy minutes, and then bake in a moderate oven about one hour. Turn it at the half hour gently, so that each side in turn shall get the greater heat, and do not slam the oven door. The difference between this process and that of making white bread, is to be found in the above italics ; i.e. white bread would be placed before the fire for an hour or up- wards before you arrived at the process of kneading, whereas the whole time employed in making a loaf of whole-meal bread may be comprised in thirty minutes. There are some things, such as soufflh, which can only be supplied in an eatable form by proceeding direct from the pan to the dining-room. I recollect the chef to a Rus- sian nobleman telling me a story about these. His master was a gourmet, but sometimes had personages as guests who were liable to be unpunctual. On these occasions he would proceed to make souffli after souffle until the appointed time came for the dish to be eaten. He was a f/^^/who considered his reputation would have gone for ever if he had served a souffle that had passed the first and only rise. Ovens differ much even if constructed on the same basis. It is of great importance that you should study your oven. You can regulate the heat of an oven by putting in a tin plate at times to absorb extra heat. In baking meat take care to baste at intervals. See above, to Roast. Take the precaution not to make a pie too large for your oven, as the Strasbourg pastry-cook did, who was ordered to supply a German personage with an enormous pati.

5 THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING. Holding, as I have done, very strong convictions on most points connected with household cookery, and, without any leaning to what is called the French school, except for so much as is good in it, I have, of course, had to apply on technical points to experts and authorities. Rarely, indeed, have I found those I deemed the best of them to differ from each other, although, I admit, that on the question of closing the stock-pot I could get no unanimous opinion. I have made it my rule to quote my authority where I have adopted the said authority entirely. I particularly desire to recognise the value of Mrs. Reeve's ' Cookery and House-keeping' (Longmans), from which I have extracted observations on the defects of English cookery, which repeat in greater detail the views I expressed some years ago.* THE ELEMENTS OF COOKING. Those things which mainly assist us in the art and science of cooking may be said to be :â€” A. Food (animal and vegetable) and liquid (generally water, but sometimes fat or oil, wine, and vinegar). B. Fire. C. The utensils in which we place, or by which we apply the food to the action of heat. Yet this will not be correct unless I point out the excep- tions to the rule of using fire. Of course where oysters, &c., are eaten raw, or where we indulge in fresh fruit, no process of cooking intervenes. The same cannot be said if you prepare a salad with oil and vinegar, &c. It is true it is called preparing, but, effectively, it is cooking in a cold form, and requires as much attention as other methods where heat is employed. In other Handbooks issued by the Executive Council the reader will find most that is to be said on the character * Article "The Kitchen and the Cellar " [Quarterly Review, No. 286, 1877), now re-published in my work, ''A Scratch Team of Essays.'

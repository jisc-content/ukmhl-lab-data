Liebig has not told us more than this, and it comprises the very quintessence of utilising meat in the most econo- mical and tasty form. Julienne soup may be taken as the type of-herbal soups, and therefore it illustrates a principle. A soup a la Jar- dinihe differs little from it, nor one d, la MacMoine, and in spring you may call it d. la Printanihe; with the onion and the cabbage, it becomes d. la Paysanne (the peasant wife's soup), and with crusts of bread and the vegetables, somewhat less in number and cut more thickly, it becomes the cro{lte-au-pot. Vegetable puries, on the other hand, find a type, say, in the very well-known crecy (carrot soup), where you rub the cooked carrots through a sieve, and add such broth, &c., as the cookery book may advise. Parsnips, onions, Jerusalem artichokes, &c., may be treated in the same way, and each ptir^e has its predominant flavour.

The first portion will be cloudy, so pour again through the sieve, and so on until clear. Upon residue in sieve pour -i lb. distilled water. Do not heat and keep well cold to avoid fermentation.

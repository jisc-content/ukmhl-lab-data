56 THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING. Sauce or Stewpan. Clean and nice as enamelled pans are, the cook should remember that they retain the heat long, and you may have your sauce, which you only intended to bring to boiling point, continue to be acted on at a higher temper- ature than required after you have removed the pan away from the fire. If I now leave this subject, I shall have to recur again to many points involved when I come to the verb "To Flavour." TO BRAISE. You may place your earthenware pot in a bain marie, and the oven instead of the hot plate is sometimes utilised. Pieces of meat with gristle can be made digestible by braising or stewing, if the process is carried out by a slow fire and for the proper length of time, that is, upwards of four hours, and if it is basted about every twenty minutes with the gravy which surrounds, but does not cover the meat. To prevent the meat from burning, a round of buttered paper cut to the size of the stew-pan may be placed on the top of the meat, care being taken that it should not drop into the gravy. Of course it must be lifted each time the meat is basted. (Reeve.) " Braising is a combination of stewing and baking. The meat, which is always nearly boned, is put into a copper stew-pan with broth and vegetables, and set upon embers or upon the corner of the stove to simmer very gently. Thus far it is the easiest-going stew that can be imagined. It is at the same time on its upper surface subjected to another process of heat. The lid is tightly closed upon it, sometimes with clay or dough, and is in a form to hold burning embers which ought to generate upon the surface of the stew a heat, that, if applied below and in contact with the metal bottom, might burn it. Below there is a

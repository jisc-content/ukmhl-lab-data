72 THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING. what first stocks are to soups and sauces ; ... to succeed you must be particular in your proportions, and very care- ful in the mixing; for, although there is nothing more simple if pains be taken, so will the least neglect produce a failure ; nor is it only with the making of the paste that pains must be taken, but likewise with the baking, for, as paste badly made would not improve with baking, neither will paste, however well made, be good if badly baked ; should the oven be too hot, the paste will become set, and burn before it is done ; and again, if too cold, it will give the paste a dull heavy appearance. . . . For every description of pastry made from puff paste, try if the oven is hot by placing your hand about half-way in, and hold it there about a quarter of a minute ; if you can hold it there that time without inconvenience, it would not be hot enough ; but, if you cannot judge of the heat, the safest method would be, try a piece of paste previous to baking the whole." I may interpose here that the thermometer should be a better tell-tale, as the sensitiveness of the hand must vary with each person. To make puff-paste, from which Soyer says upwards of a hundred different kinds of cakes may be made, I give you his process:â€” "Put one pound offloar upon your pastry-slab; make a hole in the centre, in which put the yolk of one egg and the juice of a lemon, with a pinch of salt; mix it with cold water (iced in summer, if convenient) into a softish flexible paste with the right hand, dry it off a little with flour until you have well cleared the paste from the slab, but do not work it more than you can possibly help ; let it remain two minutes upon the slab, then have a pound of fresh butter from which you have squeezed all the butter-milk in a cloth, bringing it to the same consistency as the paste, upon which place it; press it out with the hand, then fold over the edges of the paste so as to hide the butter, and roll it with the rolling-pin to the thickness of a quarter of an inch, thus making it about two feet in length ; fold over

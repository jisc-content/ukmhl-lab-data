THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING. 55 Europe have become demented about ham, and have made all their sauces to run upon gammon." Among the white sauces are comprised horse-radish mayonnaise, fennel, gooseberry, sorel, asparagus, mint, caper, mushroom, tomato, apple, onion, vegetable mar- row, &C. Mint Sauce. Looking at the prevalence of lamb for one-fourth ot the year and the just esteem in which it is held when cold, it is singular that the only sauce that goes with it should, as usually made, be unworthy of the name. I allude, of course, to that of mint The restaurateur and the inn- keeper would lead you, by their specimens of the article, to suppose that mint sauce was a boat full of indifferent vinegar into which a pinch of mint had been dropped to give it a name, and half a pinch of sugar, because some tradition had indicated the latter. Such a sauce repre- sents the crimes of a portion of cooking humanity, ignorance and parsimony. Mint sauce, when made, should be, as we say of rich cream, so thick that a spoon may almost stand in it, that is, you must not spare the mint but you may the vinegar, and your proportion of pounded white sugar should be so large that you produce a sub-acid flavour. You should never make your mint sauce till near the time of serving. In the above remarks I endeavour to enforce a Principle, viz.:â€”that as extravagance is to be denounced, so parsi- mony is to be shunned, and that of all things in this world a sham sauce should never be concocted by the cook or served by the host. Bechamel sauce is one of the divisions of white sauces. It is simply cream and veloute, or velvet down in equal parts. {See Soups.) Mrs. Acton separated her gravies from her sauces, but as a gravy is a sauce, I do not see the necessity for the division ; the more so as some preparations that Mrs. Acton calls gravies form the base of important sauces.

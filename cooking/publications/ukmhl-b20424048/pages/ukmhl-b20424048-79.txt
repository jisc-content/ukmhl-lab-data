As the above is a somewhat difficult and extravagant formula, I would advise those of moderate means to refer to a simple cookery book for other modifications of it. Pastry or crust for puddings that are to be boiled must be made with simpler ingredientsâ€”flour, suet, and water chiefly, the quality depending on the greater proportion of suet You may use butter in place of suet, and you may use clarified dripping for kitchen puddings, but suet is the main principle in crusts that have to be boiled.

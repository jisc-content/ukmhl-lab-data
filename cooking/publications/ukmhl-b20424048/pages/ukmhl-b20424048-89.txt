THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING. 83 should sprinkle the leaves lightly, using the greatest judg- ment in not overdoing it. With the pepper-mill, a recent but most happy invention, you should apply the black pepper as you have done the salt, most tenderly. You now come to the application of the vinegar. The quantity of this is purely a matter of taste, and you must consult the tastes of those in the dining-room ; but whatever amount you are to apply, it should be done in detail.

With this you can apply your vinegar in detail to the several leaves or parts of your salad. Coming on the top of salt and pepper, already applied, an agreeable chemical action is produced. But you have not finished. Still with your hands alone will you turn and re-turn the precious mixture, and you will send it up with every leaf and particle saturated with this combination of oil, acid, and condiment. I should add that most homes where salads are prepared require bowls of different sizes. It is, for instance, a very small one that will do for preparing a salad for two, but, if you have ten persons at the table, the case is very different.

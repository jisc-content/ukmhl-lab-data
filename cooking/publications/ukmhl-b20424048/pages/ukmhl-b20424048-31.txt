25 THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING. TO GRILL, OR TOAST, OR BROIL. This is a process where you cook by radiation. You fail without a clear bright fire, and the utensil you employ is quite a secondary consideration. As in roasting, you form a crust on the outside of your steak or chop, and seal the juices within. The time you employ is purely a matter of taste for the person who is to eat it. In the case of toasted bread it is essential that you should begin by presenting the surface of the bread five or six inches from the fire, approaching each side gradually. You will then obtain crisp toast, and you must serve it in a rack. It is peculiarly an English plat, and is scarcely met with on the Continent, except when ordered. If by the conditions of your range* you are able to indulge in grilling without the flavour of coal smoke, remember that many fish grill well, and that for them you must have a separate ^and exclusive gridiron, which is sometimes chalked instead of greased. You may also have a double gridiron, by which the chop can be turned without touching it, but a pair of tongs is the proper implement for moving a chop or steak. TO FRY, ALSO TO SAUTER. " Good frying is, in fact, boiling in fat," says Dr. Kit- chener ; but Dallas, perhaps more scientifically correct, allies the process to roasting. There is no question that the greatest French cooks have included an article fried under the head of roti. Still, after this explanation, it will be better to confine ourselves to our national definition. We are not, at any rate, in the singular difficulty where the cooking books, directing us to " boil" when they mean, or ought to mean, to " simmer," have landed us. The follow- ing is one of the leading principles in frying most things. * I am happy to say that I have at last seen one at this Exhibition,

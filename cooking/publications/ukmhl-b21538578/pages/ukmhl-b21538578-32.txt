30 Recipes for the Breakfast Table. No. 16. POACHED EGGS. Average cost of Ingredients. 1 fresh egg About 6 drops of lemon-juice or vinegar Salt s. d. ijd. or o 2 1 " , f ... o oj o sj Time required, about five minutes. 1. Put a saucepan full of water on the fire to boil. 2. When the water is quite boiling sprinkle in a dessert- spoonful of salt, and squeeze in six drops of lemon-juice, or half-a-teaspoonfid of vinegar. N.B.—The lemon-juice, or vinegar, helps to set the white of the egg, and makes it poach much better, but an egg can be poached without it. 3. Take an egg and break it carefully into the boiling water, holding it as close to the water as possible, so that the egg may slip gently into the water. N.B.—Great care should be taken not to break the yolk of the egg, or it will be spoiled. 4. When the egg has boiled for three minutes take it carefully out of the water with an egg-slice, and drain all the water from it. N.B.—If there are any rough edges of the white of the egg, trim them neatly round with a knife. 5. The egg is now ready for serving, according to taste. N.B.—Poached eggs are generally served on squares of hot buttered toast, or on mashed potato, or spinach.

IO Recipes for the Breakfast Table. No. 2. COFFEE. Average cost of “ Coffee" (for Three Persons). Ingredients. s. d. ij oz. of Plantation coffee (whole) at 1/6 per lb o 2 Time required, about half-ati-hour. N.B.—Plantation coffee does for ordinary use, but Mocha coffee has a better flavour, or Plantation and Mocha coffee mixed if liked. 1. Put a kettle of fresh cold water on the fire to boil. 2. Take the coffee, put it in the coffee-mill, and grind it. There should be about four good dessertspoonsful (one dessertspoonful is allowed for each person, and one over). N.B.—Ground coffee can be bought, but whole coffee, freshly ground each time, has a better flavour. Half-a-teaspoonful of chicory may be mixed with the coffee. N.B.—If whole coffee is tossed in a frying-pan over the fire for about seven minutes and then ground, it will bring out the flavour afresh. 3. Take the coffee-pot (a French tin one is most recom- mended) and pour in some hot water to warm it; then empty it. 4. Take out the little strainer at the top, and put the coffee into the pot, on to the little tin plate, which covers the second strainer. N.B.—This little tin plate is so placed, in order to prevent the water running through the strainer too quickly, before the goodness of the coffee has been extracted. Care should, therefore, be taken to see it is always in its proper place.

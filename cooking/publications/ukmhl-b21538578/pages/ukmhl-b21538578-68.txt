OR THE EXCELLENCE OF PREPARED COCOA, The Best for Family Use. Sold only in Packets. BARRY & REYNOLDS, By using proper ingredients as absorbents of the Cocoa-oil or butter in the manufac- ture of their “ Excellence of Prepared Cocoa,” preserve the great sustaining and invigorating qualities which the Cocoa-bean possesses, and which to a great extent are lost when the butter is extracted ; they therefore confidently recommend this Cocoa as easy of digestion, highly nutritious, and economical for family use.— Vide “ Civil Service Gazette," October 23rd, 1869. “As an article of food, Cocoa differs essentially from both tea and coffee. While only an infusion of those substances is used, leaving a large proportion of their total weight unconsumed, the entire substance of the cocoa serds is prepared as an emulsion for drinking, and the whole is thus utilised within the system. While the contents of a cup of tea or coffee can only be regard d as stimulant in its effect, and almost entirely destitute of essential nutritive properties, a cup of ‘prepa>ed cocoa ’ is really a most nourishing article of diet, as, in addition to the value of the theobromine it contains, it introduces into the system no inconsiderable proportion of valuable nitrogenous and oleaginous elements.”—“Encyclopedia Britannica."

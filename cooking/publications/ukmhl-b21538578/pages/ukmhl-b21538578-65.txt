Boil the eggs in boiling water for ten minutes, when done take the shells off and put them in a basin of cold water for tzuo or three minutes. (This will prevent the white of the egg discolouring.) 2. Cut the steak up in equal-sized pieces, and put it at the bottom of the pie-dish (about one pint-and-a-half size). Sprinkle over some of the seasoning (about a teaspoonful op salt and half-a-teaspoonful of pepper mixed, will be sufficient altogether). 3. Cut each pigeonva four pieces,wash,and wipe them quite dry with a clean cloth. (All the trimmings from the steak and pigeons should be put aside.) Cut the eggs into quarters, lay the pigeon and eggs alternately on the top of the steak, sprinkle over the remainder of the seasoning, then add the chopped parsley and the bacon cut in small slices. 4. Make the paste, and cover the pie with it; use the trimmings of the paste to ornament it. Make a small hole in the centre of the crust to let the steam out.

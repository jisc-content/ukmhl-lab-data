Put the butter in an omelette-pan, add the half-tea- spoonful of chopped shalot (it must be very finely chopped), and cook it over the fire for about three minutes, until the shalot is soft. Care must be taken not to let it brown or burn. 2. Peel the tomato, and cut it in small pieces; put it in a basin, and add to it the polks of three eggs, and a tea- spoonful of salt and pepper mixed. Stir all well together. 3. Whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and stir them lightly into the yolks of eggs and tomato; then pour the mixture into the omelette-pan, and stir it lightly over the fire till cooked. Try and keep it in a good shape ; it will take about five minutes, and requires a very quick fire. Care must be taken not to let it burn, or stick to the bottom of the pan. 4. For serving, it should be turned on to a hot dish, and, if liked, some brown gravy may be poured round.

Take the kidney, wipe it with a clean cloth, and skin it carefully, cut it into little dice ; wash, dry, and chop up the shalot and parsley; put half-an-ounce of blitter into a small stew-pan, and add the kidney, shalot, and parsley ; put it over the fire and stir with a spoon until it is just cooked, but not too much. 2. Put the ounce of butter into a clean omelette-pan and melt it over the fire, break the eggs into a basin, add a teaspoonful of salt and pepper mixed, and beat them together. Now pour the eggs into the omelette-pan, and stir them quickly over a quick fire; when almost cooked, put the kidney, shalot, and parsley in the centre, fold the omelette over on to one side, and turn it on to a hot dish. N.B.—If made properly, the kidney should not be seen until the omelette is cut. N.B.—An omelette with mushrooms can be made in the same way, cooling the mushrooms first, and leaving out the shalot and parsley.

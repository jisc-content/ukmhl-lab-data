Wash and peel the potatoes, and cut them in thick slices, and then in strips about a quarter of an inch wide, and one inch long. 2. Heat the clarified dripping over the fire, and when quite boiling, put in the potatoes and fry them a light brown. 3. When they are done, take them out and put them on a piece of whitey-brown paper to drain off the grease. 4. Take the kidneys, wipe them with a clean cloth, and carefully remove the outside skin, and cut them in half. 5. Put the slices of bacon in a frying-pan, and fry them over the fire; take out the slices, and fry the kidneys in the bacon-fat, taking care not to fry them too much. 6. For serving put the fried potatoes on a hot dish, and tastily arrange the kidneys and bacon alternately on the top of the potatoes. Divide the butter, and put a small piece on each kidney; mix together a teaspoonful of salt and half-a-teaspoonful of pepper, and sprinkle it over each kidney. Serve very hot. N.B.—The potatoes can be omitted. C 2

Put the yeast in a jug with the lukewarm water, stir it up, and let it stand for ten minutes, then pour it gently on to the flour, but do not disturb the sediment at the bottom of the jug. Mix it well till it is a smooth batter, about the same consistency as for Yorkshire pudding, cover the basin with a cloth, and stand it aside in a warm place, or in some warm water, to rise for two hours. 3. Place the rings (made for the purpose) on to the hot iron or stove, for baking, and pour the batter gently into the rings (without disturbing the bottom of the batter) and bake them. They must be watched, and when the top of the batter is covered with small bladders turn the rings carefully to the other side with a palette knife, when they will soon be done. They will only take about five minutes to bake. For serving they should be toasted and buttered. N.B.—Crumpets must be baked on a hot plate, not in the oven, and it is necessary to bake them in rings or the batter will not keep in shape. German yeast (about one ounce) might be used, but brew ers’ yeast is better.

I B.T. BROWN & POLSON’S CORN FLOUR FOR THE FAMILY TABLE. IN the hands of an accomplished cook there is no known limit to the variety of delicate and palatable dishes which may be produced from Brown & Polson’s Corn Flour. It readily lends itself to the requirements of individual taste, and may be enriched with every variety of ingredient within the resources of the cuisine. It is equally susceptible of plain and simple treatment for ordinary domestic purposes, and one of its chief recommendations is the facility with which it may be prepared. Boiled with milk, and with or without the addition of sugar and flavouring, it may be ready for the table within fifteen minutes ; or poured into a mould and cooled, it becomes in the course of an hour a Blanc-mange, which, served with fresh or pre- served fruit, will be acceptable at any meal. Add sultana raisins, marmalade, or jam of any kind, and in about the same time it is made into an excellent Baked Pudding. To which facts may be added just two hints: i. Take care to boil with milk, when so required, for not less than eight minutes. 2. If time can be taken for it, the Baked Pudding will be the better for being allowed to cool, and should be re-warmed when about to be served. NOTE.—Unlihe many others, this Corn Flour bears the names of its Manufacturers, who offer the guarantee of their long-established reputation for its uniformly Superior Quality.

It has fallen to my lot to have all sorts and kinds of potatoes and divers cooks of late, but they sin ply cannot help cooking the potatoes properly. I have never had them served up so uniformly well in my life, and hope that in a short time no family or restaurant may be without your Steamers. “ August 20th, 1883." “ Believe me to be, etc." We are authorised by the NATIONAL SCHOOL OF COOKERY.

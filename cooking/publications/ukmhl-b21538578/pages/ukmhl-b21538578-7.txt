PREFACE. It has been suggested to me that a set of Recipes for the Breakfast Table, compiled in the same style as those in the “ Official Handbook of the National Training School for Cookery,” would be very useful, and the success which has attended the issue of that book has encouraged me to publish the present one. The oft-repeated cry, “ What can we have for break- fast ? ” has led me to make the present selection of Recipes, and my object has been throughout to try to have as much variety as possible, making use of the ordinary ingredients, without rushing into any great expense. I do not look upon this.little work as complete, and V V- " %k I shall hope to make-additions to it, from time to time. All the present Recipes have been practically and carefully tested by -Mrs. Berry, lately Chief Instructor at the National Training School for Cookery, and my thanks are due to her for her valuable assistance in the preparation of this little book.

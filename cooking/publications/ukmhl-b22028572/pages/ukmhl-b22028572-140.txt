BREAD AND CAKES. 1-20 VIENNA ROLLS. Warm a pint of milk, with two ounces of butter; add a little salt ; put it into a basin and thicken it with flour, as for bread ; knead it very well, put in the size of a nut of German yeast which has been allowed to work as usual; set the basin before the fire for an hour, but let it be covered with a cloth ; then on the baking board roll it out rather thin, cut it into triangular pieces, which roll up, leaving the corner out; bend them at the ends to form a cres- cent, then bake a light brown, and do the tops over with white of egg. BATH CAKES. Roll half a pound of butter into a pound of flour, and add four beat eggs and a glassful of yeast; set it before the fire to rise; then put in four ounces of sifted sugar; roll out the paste into thin sheets, and stamp it out in rounds; bake on tins: they should rise very light. SALLY LUNNS. Make them as French bread, but dissolve some sugar in hot milk, and when made into buns, spread it over the top. ALMOND BREAD. Take little fresh baked rolls, take out the centre, and fill them with sweet almonds and sugar bruised fine, quarter of a pound of each, mixed with three yolks of eggs ; then put the whites of the eggs well beaten in, and bake them; they can be put in milk soup.

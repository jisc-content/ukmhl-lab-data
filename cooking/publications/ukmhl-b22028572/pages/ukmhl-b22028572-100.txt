PUDDINGS. 80 LIGHT PUDDING. Pare and core six large apples; fill the centre of them with orange juice and sugar, place them in a pie dish, and pour a very light batter over them; it should be made of eggs, flour, and milk: bake the pudding half an hour, then sprinkle sugar on it. BOHEMIAN PUDDINGS. Beat four yolks of eggs very well, and mix them with half a pound of flour; whip half a pint of cream, and add it to the flour and eggs ; then pour in three tablespoonfuls of melted butter, and a very little sifted sugar; add a little salt, and mix all well together; place it near the fire for quarter of an hour, that it may rise before you put it into the moulds (which should be such as are used for small minced pies); butter them to prevent the puddings from burning; when done, they should be of a light brown; the oven should not be very hot: they are served up hot, placing two together, with preserve between. PLAIN DUMPLINGS. Make a very stiff batter with flour, a little milk, three eggs, and salt; work this up into balls, roll them in flour, and boil them in water ; they may be made sweet with raisins or currants, and brown sugar, and served with sweet sauce. HARD DUMPLINGS. Take a quarter of a pound of finely minced suet; mix it with a pound of flour, add a little salt, and wet it with water to the consistency of dough ; divide it into small dumplings, and put them into boiling water, and boil hem half an hour.

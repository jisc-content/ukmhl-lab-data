PRESERVES. 133 DRIED GOOSEBERRIES. Put five pounds of gooseberries into a stewpan, and strew over them one pound of sugar; set them on a slow fire; when the syrup begins to come out, take them off; scald them in this way for two or three days, then take them out of the syrup, place them upon a sieve, and put them before the fire to dry; they may be dipped into powdered white sugar when taken out of the syrup, and thus candied. They should be kept in a tin box, with paper laid between them. GOOSEBERRIES DONE LIKE HOPS. Take very large green gooseberries, but not ripe ones, cut them across the top, and half way down, in four petals; remove the seeds without breaking the skins; then take fine long thorns, scrape them, and skewer the gooseberries one over the other, throwing them into water as they are strung; then put them into a preserving pan with an equal weight of white sugar; boil them until they grow clear, and put them into pots used for dessert. GOOSEBERRY WAFERS. Gather the gooseberries when ripe, put them into a jar in a pan of water; after they have boiled, strain them through a sieve, and to every pound of fruit add ,three quarters of a pound of sugar and the white of an egg beaten into a stiff froth; mix the whole well together, and spread it upon dishes thinly; dry it sufficiently in a cool oven, cut it into shapes, set them before the fire to harden a little. Damsons or plums can be done in the same way.

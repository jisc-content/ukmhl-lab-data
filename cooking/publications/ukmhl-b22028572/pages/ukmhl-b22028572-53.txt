MEAT. 33 WHITE COLLOPS. Cut some veal into bits the size of half-a-crown, and not much thicker; butter the bottom of the stew pan, and lay the meat piece by piece upon it: having shaken a little flour upon the butter, set the pan on the fire, and toss it until the meat is white; then add half a pint of strong veal broth, and a quarter of a pint of cream ; toss the whole, and when simmered enough, let them just boil; add, if liked, the juice of an orange, some forcemeat balls, and either oysters or mushrooms ; the sauce may also be thickened with an egg. VEAL CUTLETS. Cut some veal into square pieces of about half an inch in thickness; beat it to make it eat the more tender, then fry them, covered with egg and bread crumbs: serve with nice thick gravy, and bread cut in different shapes and fried. Orange cut in slices may be used to garnish with. VEAL AND SWEETBREAD PIE. Cut the veal in pieces ; clean and blanch a sweet- bread, cut it into pieces, lay it with the veal in a deep dish, with the yolks of three hard boiled eggs and a pint of oysters, strain the oyster liquor and mix it up with a pint of milk or good gravy, pour it on the meat, and cover the dish with puff paste. SWEDISH DISH. Take two pounds of veal (either fresh or cold), mince it very fine, with half a pound of suet, a little salt, a teacupful of bread crumbs, and four eggs; mix all well together, place it neatly on a dish, bake it twenty minutes, and serve with a good brown sauce: if properly done it should cut quite smoothly.

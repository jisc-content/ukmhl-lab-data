MEAT. 34 FRICANDEAU OF VEAL. Cut a handsome piece from the fillet, lard it all over; half roast or fry it, put it into a stewpan with just enough water to cover it, let it stew gently until thoroughly done, boil the gravy down to a glaze, and cover the veal with it. FRICANDEL. Take three pounds of the best end of a loin of veal, chop fat and lean together, very fine; then soak a french roll in some milk, beat three eggs and a little salt, mix all well together, and make it up into the size and somewhat the shape of a chicken; rub it over with eggs and bread crumbs, fry till brown, pour off the fat, boil water in the pan, and stew the fricandel in this gravy: thicken the gravy with flour before it is served. DUTCH SWEETBREADS. Two pounds of lean veal and half a pound of suet beat in a mortar, a slice of bread soaked in milk, with a little salt, mix all well together, and make it into the shape of kidneys, which cover with egg and bread crumbs, and fry them light brown : serve them with gravy. VEAL STEWED WITH OYSTERS. Cut the veal into handsome pieces, put them into a jar with some dozen oysters and their liquor strained, and a piece of butter rolled in flour; put the jar into a kettle of water, and let it stew until tender: if the veal has been cooked, merely warm it up with the oysters, in white sauce made of veal stock and cream.

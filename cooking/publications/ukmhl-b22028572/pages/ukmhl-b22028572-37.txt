17 SOUPS. SOUP WITH VIENNA BALLS. Beat twelve ounces of butter with two whole eggs and four yolks to a foam; add fine flour, and some salt to it; stir all slowly together, and try it in boiling water: if it is still too soft for balls, add some more flour, and spread the dough the thickness of a fingerâ€™s breadth upon a flat plate: a quarter of an hour before the soup is ready, boil some salt and water in a pan, cut four-cornered pieces from the dough, boil the balls five minutes, lift them with a draining spoon to allow the water to run away, then pour a good gravy soup on them. SOUP WITH EGGS.

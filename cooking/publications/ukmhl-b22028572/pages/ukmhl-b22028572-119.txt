SWEET DISHES, ETC. 99 FLOUR FRITTERS. Mix three ounces of flour with a teacupful of warm milk and a spoonful of yeast; let it rise before the fire for about an hour, then mix four eggs well beaten, and as much milk as will make the batter the usual thickness for pancakes, and fry them in the same way. PLAIN FRITTERS. Grate the crumb of a penny loaf, put it into a pint of milk over the fire, and beat it very smooth ; when cold add the yolks of five eggs, and three ounces of sifted sugar; fry them in lard, and serve with sweet sauce and preserves. ORANGE FRITTERS. Take off1 the rind of two oranges, remove all the white skin, cut the oranges in slices across, and take out the pips; dip the slices in batter, and fry them : serve with powdered sugar upon each fritter. CURD FRITTERS. Rub down in a mortar a quart of dried curd, with the yolks of eight and the whites of four well beaten eggs, two ounces of sifted sugar, and half a spoonful of flour; drop the batter into a frying pan, with a little butter or fine lard.

58 VEGETABLES. BROCOLI AND BUTTERED EGGS. Boil the brocoli; then put six well beaten eggs into a saucepan, with a quarter of a pound of butter and a little salt, stir it over the fire until the mixture is thick enough; toast a piece of bread to fit the inner part of the dish on which the brocoli is to be served, place it on the toast, and pour the sauce over it. PEAS WITH EGGS. Boil some green peas; add a little broth to them, and put them on a dish with fried eggs on the top. PEAS PUDDING. Take a quart of split peas, tie them in a cloth, leaving plenty of room for the peas to swell; boil till they are quite soft, which will take from two to three hours; take the pudding from the water and put it in a basin, bruise the peas well, mix in a bit of butter and a little salt; then put it into a mould, tie it up tightly and put it into the pan again, and let it boil half an hour; when served turn it out. PEAPODS STEWED. Take the sugar pea when young, pare off the outer edges of the pods, carefully removing the strings; then put them into good gravy, and thicken with a little butter and flour; and let them stew gently until quite tender. VEGETABLE MARROW Can be dressed in many ways, either plain, boiled, cut in slices and served upon toast with melted butter, or stewed in a good gravy, or mashed in the same way as turnips, or made into pur^e with cream.

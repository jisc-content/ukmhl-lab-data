FISH. â– 21 SOLE ROLLS. Take two or three soles, divide them from the back bone, and take off the head, fins, and tail ; sprinkle the inside with salt, roll them up tight from the tail end upwards, and fasten it with a small skewer ; if the soles are large put half a one in each roll; dip them into yolk of eggs, and cover them with bread crumbs ; do this twice and fry them a beautiful colour in lard. CUTLETS OF SOLES. Cut the soles, whether previously dressed or ra\y, into handsome pieces, and stew them gently in a little clear gravy ; add a little salt and a teaspoonful of soy; any white fish may be dressed in the same way. MACKAREL A LA MA1TRE DHOTEL. Clean your mackarel, split it, soak it for an hour or more in oil seasoned with salt, grill it, brush it over with the oil, and serve very hot. BAKED PIKE. Prepare the fish, let them dry for an hour, brush them over with an egg, cover one half with butter, the other with bread crumbs, and bake them in hot butter. Perch can be done the same way, and so can many other fish. FISH PIE. Three middling sized haddocks, mackarels, or soles, will make a pie: they may be stuffed with a little minced veal or fowl, with bread crumbs and salt; put them on a flat dish, with a neat border of potatoes

POULTRY. 47 MINCED TURKEY. Take some cold turkey, mince it ; make some sauce of milk thickened with flour, a little butter, and some salt; a few oysters can also be added: heat up all together; and if there is a leg, grill it, and place it on the top: garnish with toasted bread or fried potatoes. PIGEONS WITH PEAS. Put the pigeons into a stew pan with a little butter, just to stiffen them and give them a good colour; dredge them with flour, then moisten them with gravy, and make it into the consistence of sauce: when half done put in a quart of peas; stir them often. STEWED PIGEONS WITH MACARONI. Either stew the pigeons whole or cut in pieces, in a good gravy seasoned with salt, and a very little ketchup: when half done, put in some macaroni, and let it stew gently in a closed pan, till quite tender. Fowls may be done in the same way. ROASTED PIGEONS. Stuff the whole of the body of the pigeon with veal finely pounded, and mixed with a little salt and bread steeped in milk; then roast them. PIGEONS IN JELLY. Prepare three or four pigeons; stew them, and let them get cold, glaze them over; have a clear stock made from a knuckle of veal, so strong that it will cut; melt it, season it with salt, fill a deep mould half, let the jelly get cold; then place the pigeons with four yolks of eggs hard boiled on it, and pour in the rest of the jelly. Serve it cold.

Choose haddocks of two or three pounds weight, take out the gills, eyes, and entrails, and remove the blood from the backbone ; wipe them dry, and put some salt into the bodies and eyes ; lay them on a board all night, then hang them up in a dry place, and after three or four days they will be fit to eat; skin and rub them with egg, and strew crumbs over them, lay them before the fire, and baste with butter till brown enough; serve with egg sauce.

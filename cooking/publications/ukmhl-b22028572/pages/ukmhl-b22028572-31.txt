SOUPS. 11 RICE SOUP. Take about two quarts of fowl stock, in which put three ounces of rice ; let it boil until the rice swells, season it with a little salt, and add some pounded Teal or fowl, then let it boil up once. BARLEY BROTH. Take a breakfast cupful of pearl barley, boil it in a gallon of water gently for half an hour ; take then three pounds of lean beef or mutton, dress it with a little water in a separate stewpan, add to it some cut carrots and turnips, season with salt, and mix the barley and water with it; then let it boil two hours or even longer ; skim off the fat well. PEARL BARLEY SOUP. Cook some meat until it is sufficiently done, put some barley in good stock with some butter, and let it swell out; cut a carrot into fine slices and let it stew slowly in a pan with some butter ; then add the barley, and strain the fowl or veal soup through a sieve ; the meat that is not sufficiently done, allow to boil tender with the barley : if the soup be not thick enough, mix a spoonful of flour in butter and let it boil with the barley; season with salt and serve it. SAGO SOUP. Make a fine gravy soup quite clear and brown, add to it a little salt, and a sufficient quantity of sago to thicken it.

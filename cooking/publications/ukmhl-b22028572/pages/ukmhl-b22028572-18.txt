XIV FISH. Cocl, haddock, whiting, sole, flounder, turbot, trout, perch, carp, pike, and in fact all fishes in common use whose flesh is not of an oily nature, but no highly seasoned sauces, vinegar, or mustard must be eaten with them. A little plain mushroom ketchup, (such as we have given a receipt for,) soy, or plain butter sauce, may be sued. Salted and smoked fish should be avoided. With respect to shell jisli, oysters alone are admissible, and these only in very moderate quantities. BUTCHER MEAT. Fresh beef, mutton, veal, (not too young,) lamb, (sometimes,) tripe, kidney, sweetbread, brains, cow heel, calf’s, sheep’s, and lamb’s head, fresh tongue. We have not admitted salt or smoked meats among our receipts, though these may occasionally be partaken of. POULTRY. Fowl, chicken, turkey, pigeons, larks, or other small land birds. The fat of geese and ducks is considered to have a medicinal action; these birds must therefore be shunned.

BREAD AND CAKES. 122 hour, then add a very little more flour to make it stiffer; work it well, and divide it into small loaves about five inches wide, and flatten them ; when baked and cold, slice them the thickness of rusks, and put them in the oven to brown a little. BISCUITS TO USE WITH PRESERVES. Take equal quantities of butter and flour, a little salt, and two eggs; knead the whole together into a paste, roll it out thin, and cut it in large rounds; mark them with the back of the knife in lines, so as to form diamonds; put them into the oven for quarter of an hour; take them out; beat up two eggs with a little cream and some salt, pour it over the cakes, and return them to the oven to bake for another quarter of an hour. PLAIN BISCUITS. Rub a pound of flour, six ounces of butter, and three large spoonfuls of yeast, and make it into a paste, with a sufficient quantity of new milk; cut the biscuits, and prick them with a fork. KRINGLES. Beat well the yolks of eight eggs, and whites of two, and mix with four ounces of butter just warmed; with this knead a pound of flour and four ounces of sugar to a paste ; roll into thick biscuits, prick them, and bake on tin plates. OAT CAKES. Have a basin with a pint of cold water in it, put in a very little salt, mix well with the water three handfuls of oatmeal, turn it on to the baking board,

LOZENGES, ETC. HO HOMOEOPATHIC COFFEE. A very good substitute for coffee is made by roasting whole barley, wheat, rye, or maize, with a very little butter; grinding it, and preparing it like ordinary coffee. It has very much the taste of the real Mocha without its injurious effects. TREACLE POSSET. Boil a pint of milk and drop into it a tablespoonful of treacle; then let it boil three minutes: serve it quite hot. LOZENGES, &c. GUM LOZENGES.* To four parts of gum arabic add one part of starch and twelve parts of sugar, add sufficient water to dissolve it; put it by the side of the fire, and when completely dissolved pour it into a shallow dish; when hard cut it into neat lozenge shapes; they may be coloured and seasoned by the addition of beetroot juice, red currant jelly, or orange juice. JUJUBES. Dissolve four ounces of isinglass in as little water as possible; mix with it two ounces of extremely fine sifted sugar; a little orange or red currant jelly may be used to colour it; let it heat well in a jar by the fire ; then pour it on a slab, and when cold cut it in diamonds. * Mr. Headland, Homoeopathic Chemist, prepares a very agreeable lozenge, composed of perfectly unmedicinal sub- stances, which he calls “ Homoeopathic Cough Lozenges.”

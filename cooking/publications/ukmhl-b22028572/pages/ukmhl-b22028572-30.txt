SOUPS. 10 brown; then put in a quarter of a peck of minced turnips, and stir on the fire until the turnips have parted with their moisture, then put on the cover and boil slowly, fill up afterwards with stock. In the meantime the partridges are to be roasted and cut in pieces, add them to the soup, and serve in a tureen. The quantity of stock should be proportioned to the company. BROWN FISH SOUP. Either cod, skate, haddock, whitings, or flounder may be used for making the stock, and it is best to fry the fish first when for brown soup, then allow it to stew until the stock is sufficiently strong; strain it, and season it with salt and ketchup ; a piece of toast may also be put in. BROWN FISH SOUP. Take some white fish, boil it in two quarts of water until all the strength is out of the bones and meat; strain it, and add to it a quart of good brown gravy taken from beef; thicken a little with flour, season with salt, and serve with fried bread in it. WHITE FISH SOUP. Take two good sized haddocks, cut them in pieces, boil them till the flesh comes from the bones, in a gallon of water; take out some of the nicest parts of the fish, mince it, and make it up with egg and bread crumbs into little balls; strain the soup, add half a pint of cream and a pint of new milk, boil it up, adding a little salt, thicken it with a little flour, and serve it with the balls in it.

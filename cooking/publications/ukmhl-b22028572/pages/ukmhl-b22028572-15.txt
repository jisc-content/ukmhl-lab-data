XI The usefulness of this hook need not he con- fined to patients under homoeopathic treatment, for with it as a guide invalids of all classes may derive benefit, and persons in health may often preserve that most precious of gifts, by abstaining from the injudicious use of spices and stimulants, which serve but to excite an artificial appetite, giving rise to repletion and overloading the stomach, the injurious effects of which are only too well known. In conclusion I may observe, that though the following dishes are in strict accordance with homoeopathic principles, I would not thereby have it to be supposed, that they all may he par- taken of by all individuals, for almost every one has an idiosyncrasy of stomach, if I may so express myself, which causes certain substances, harmless in themselves, to disagree; thus milk cannot be borne by one, butter by another, eggs by a third, and so on. In the face of such pecu- liarities it is impossible to lay down any rules for diet which shall be universally applicable; expe- rience alone can teach every one what articles agree, what disagree with him, and his choice or rejection of viands must be made accordingly.

GAME. 48 GAME. TO STEW GAME. Brown some butter and flour; put the game into a stew pan with a very little water, and turn it frequently; when it begins to get dry put in some more water: when the birds are done take them out, and make the sauce by adding cream to clean out the pan ; this is best done by a small switch. If not a good colour, add some soy, and strain it through a sieve. MINCED VENISON. Mince some cold venison finely, season with salt, make it up into balls, with sufficient gravy to make them stick, dip them in batter, roll them in bread crumbs, and broil them: serve with brown sauce. STEWED VENISON. Cut some slices of cold venison, stew it in some of its own gravy, dredge some flour over it, and add a mixture of butter, ketchup, and red currant jelly : serve with square pieces of fried bread on it. HARE ROASTED IN BATTER. Take three or four eggs, a pint of milk, a couple of handfuls of flour; make them into batter, and when the hare is roasting baste it well, repeating the operation until the batter thickens and forms a coating all over the hare; this should be allowed to brown, but not to burn.

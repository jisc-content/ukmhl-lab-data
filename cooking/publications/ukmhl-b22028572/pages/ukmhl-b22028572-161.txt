141 LOZENGES, ETC. SUGAR KISSES. Melt a quarter of a pound of pounded sugar over the fire; mix with it the juice of a sweet orange; let it boil, and then put it in drops on a slab; before they are cold stamp them with a common wafer stamp. BARLEY SUGAR. Clarify and boil some sugar, rub a small slab with oil, and when the sugar is ready pour it on it; cut it in slips, and then while hot twist it. ALMOND GLASS. Take a pound of sweet almonds, bruise them very fine after they have been peeled, mix them with two eggs and three quarters of a pound of sifted sugar; then mix it with other four eggs well; then spread it on wafers and cover it with sugar; then bake it on a flat tin slowly. ALMOND TABLET. Blanch and bruise half a pound of almonds fine, mix them with the whites of two eggs, six ounces of sugar, and with the whites of two more eggs ; spread it on buttered tin, and bake it a light brown; then cut it in long stripes. FRUIT LOZENGES. Boil a jar of black currant jelly until it is so thick that it will cut nicely; pour it on a buttered plate, cut it in small squares, and when cold take them off the plate and dip them in a little flour to prevent them sticking together when put into a box: red currant jelly can be used in this way.

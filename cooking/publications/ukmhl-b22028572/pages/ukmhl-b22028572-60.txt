40 MEAT. MUTTON OR LAMB CHOPS. Cut the chops very nicely, pare off the fat, and fry them a fine brown; pile them up on the dish, with the bones meeting at the top, and place between each pieces of fried bread, cut in the shape of half a large pear; make a puree of vegetables, and lay it round in the bottom of the dish: peas or spinach with lamb, turnips or potatoes with mutton. MINCED MUTTON. Mince the meat very finely; make a very good gravy, season with salt, put the meat in it, and stew it ten minutes: serve it up with fried bread round the dish. MUTTON CUTLETS. Cut the back end of a neck of mutton into neat pieces, and cut each bone short; brush them with egg, and cover them with crumbs of bread, mash some potatoes with a little butter and cream; fry the cutlets and put them round the potatoes piled in the middle of the dish. MUTTON CUTLETS. Take cutlets from the neck of mutton, remove the fat, steep them in salad oil, drain them, and sprinkle them with the raspings of bread and a little salt: broil, toast, or fry them. MUTTON STEAKS WITH FRENCH BEANS. Having dressed french beans as usual, and simmered them with salt and a good piece of butter, add the yolk of an egg, and shake the pan over the fire for a minute or two; prepare a few mutton steaks, cover with egg and bread crumbs, and either boil or fry them: serve them on the beans.

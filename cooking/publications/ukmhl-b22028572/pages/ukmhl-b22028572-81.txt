61 PASTRY. A VEGETABLE TOWER. Take a high mould which is larger at the bottom than the top, place at the top of the mould a layer of turnips, then one of carrots, next one of any green vegetable in season, and allowed; then put alternately pieces of carrot and turnips cut in square pieces round the side of the mould to the top, and fill it with potatoes; put the mould in a pan of water, and allow it to remain until the vegetables are done ; be sure to put the top of the mould downwards in the pan: serve the tower with brown gravy round it, or with white sauce. PASTRY. CRUST TO USE WITH MEAT. To one pound of flour put half a pound of butter and two eggs, mix them all well with warm water, and roll the paste rather thick ; line the dish except at the bottom, put in the meat and cover with the paste thick enough to bear long continuance in the oven. TRANSPARENT CRUST FOR TARTS. Beat an egg until it is quite thin ; have ready twelve ounces of the purest well-washed fresh butter, melt it without oiling; when cold mix the egg with it, and stir it into a pound of well dried flour: make the paste very thin, line the patty pans as quickly as possible, fill and cover them, and just before putting into the oven brush them over with water, and sift sugar on them : if baked in a moderate oven they will look clear.

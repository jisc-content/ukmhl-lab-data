20 FISH. BAKED HADDOCKS. Put three nicely cleaned haddocks on a flat dish, with a border of mashed potatoes neatly marked, put a bit of butter and a little salt inside of each fish, glaze them with an egg, and place bits of butter over the fish, garnish the top with potato balls, bake it half an hour, and pour melted butter and a little ketchup over it. FISH AND SAUCE. Cut off the tails, fins, and heads of three haddocks, boil them in a little water to make stock, cut the haddocks in three pieces, mix the stock with a little salt and a cupful of ketchup, stew the fish in it; the sauce may be made richer by adding a little flour and butter to it. CROPPED HEADS. Parboil the roe of haddocks or cod, mix it with double its quantity of pounded hard biscuits, salt, and a beaten egg, stuff haddocksâ€™ heads with this mixture, and fry them in beef dripping ; prepare a sauce of beef gravy and flour, with a teacupful of ketchup, add it to the heads ; let them simmer fifteen minutes. SOLE PIE. Take out the bones of two middling sized soles, cut them in pieces, put them on a dish with a layer of bearded oysters, then another of fish, season with salt, and cover it with mashed potatoes, brown it before the fire, and serve with melted butter and soy, or put in some gravy, the liquor of the oysters, and some cream, putting a crust on it, and baking in the oven.

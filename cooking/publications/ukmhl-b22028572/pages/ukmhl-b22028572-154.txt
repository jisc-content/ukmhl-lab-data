134 PRESERVES. PRESERVED PEARS. Take two dozen pears, take off the skin, cut them in halves, soak them in boiling water for ten minutes, then pour clarified syrup on them, and boil them for a short time. Apples can be done in the same way, only they must be cored, and longer boiled. JARGANEL PEARS. Pare them very thin, and simmer them in thin syrup; let them lie a few days in it; make the syrup richer, and simmer them again; then strain them, and dry them in a cool oven, or in the sun: they are best kept in syrup, and dried again when wanted. APRICOT JELLY. Boil some ripe apricots until they will mash, add some syrup ; strain it through a coarse sieve, boil it up with some more sugar, skim it until it is clear. Nectarines can be done the same way. APRICOT JAM. Take some ripe apricots, pare them as thin as possible, cut them in quarters, and put away the stones ; put the fruit, with an equal quantity of finely sifted sugar, into an enamelled pan, and boil gently until sufficiently done. DAMSON CHEESE. Gather the damsons on a dry day, bake or boil them till they are quite done; let the juice pass through a fine sieve, and put to every pint of juice a pound of sifted sugar; fill little shapes with it; the remainder of the fruit, if boiled with some biown sugar, will do for common purposes.

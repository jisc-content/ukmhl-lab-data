Ill SWEET DISHES, ETC. CURRANT FRITTERS. Make a light batter of flour, one egg, and milk, sweeten with sugar; have some dried currants washed and mix with the batter; drop a spoonful in a pan with lard, fry them, and serve with sifted sugar and melted butter. BAKED PEARS. Pears which are not so good to eat raw can be used; choose ripe ones, and without paring them, lay them on tin plates and bake them in a slow oven ; when enough done flatten them with a spoon, put them on a dish with sifted sugar over them, and serve with cream. STEWED PEARS. Pare and cut in quarter some large pears, put them into water; pack them round a block tin stew- pan, and sprinkle as much sugar over as will make them rather sweet; just cover them with water; cover the stewpan, and allow them to stew three or four hours : the juice of an orange may be added. SPANISH TART. Pound a quantity of sugar equal to the weight of eight eggs extremely fine ; beat the whites of the eggs to a very firm froth, add the sugar by degrees whilst beating; spread this mixture on paper in oval shaped flat portions of equal size, and bake them in a very moderately heated oven, so that the outside becomes light yellow and the inside quite crisp : arrange them now on a dish with preserves of any kind between them, and cover the top with icing.

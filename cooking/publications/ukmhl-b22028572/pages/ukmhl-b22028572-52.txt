STEWED VEAL. Take some veal cut for cutlets; stew it in some veal stock ; have some Brussels sprouts boiled, strain off the water, arrange them round the veal, on a dish: take the gravy in which the veal was stewed, strain it, thicken it with cream and flour, season with salt, and pour it over the meat. HARICOT OF VEAL. Shorten the bones of the best end of a loin of veal, either leave the meat whole or cut it into chops, brown it and stew it in good brown gravy, thickened with butter and flour; a little soy may be added, and when nearly ready, a quart of green peas. VEAL RISSOLES. Take a pound of veal; chop it very fine, with six ounces of suet, and soak two pounds of the crumb of a quartern loaf in milk for a quarter of an hour ; then press it dry, add a little salt, mix it with the meat. Beat up one or two eggs to moisten the mass, so that it may be rolled into balls without the addition of flour; fry them with some dry crumbs of bread, and serve with a good gravy.

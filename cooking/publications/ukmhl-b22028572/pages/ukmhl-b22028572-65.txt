45 POULTRY. FRITTERS OF FOWL. Take the remains of a cold fowl, bone it, cut it in neat pieces, and fry it in batter; make a little gravy from the bones, thicken it with cream and flour. FOWL CUTLETS. Cut up a fowl and bone it; make the legs, wings, breast, and merrythought into six cutlets, by flatten- ing them and giving them a good shape; then take the meat from the remainder of the fowl: pound it in a mortar with a little salt and a spoonful of gravy; brush the cutlets with an egg, lay on the minced meat, dredge fried crumbs on the top, and fry them a light brown: serve them either with or without gravy. FOWL WITH OYSTERS. Fill a fowl, either boned or plain, with oysters; if not boned a dozen will be sufficient. Put the fowl into a jar, and plunge the jar into water; let it stew for an hour and a half if a small fowl, and two hours if large. There will be nearly a pint of gravy found in the jar, skim and take off the fat, and convert it into a white sauce by the addition of a little butter and flour, eggs, or cream; add it to the oyster liquor, and warm in it a dozen bearded oysters. MINCED FOWL. Mince the white part of cold fowl or turkey very finely; then pound it in a mortar: put in some spoonfuls of cream, mixed with veal stock, and pass it through a sieve, adding a little salt ; warm the whole : serve it up with the legs grilled, and garnish with fried bread, or paste cut in shapes; or put a wall of rice or mashed potatoes round it.

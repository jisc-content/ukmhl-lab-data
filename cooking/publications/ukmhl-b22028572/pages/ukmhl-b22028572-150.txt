130 BREAD AND CAKES. ICING FOR CAKES. Beat up the white of an egg very well; have ready three ounces of sugar sifted as fine as possible, mix it by degrees with the white of egg with a spoon, cover the cake with it; put it in a cold place, and when quite firm it can be ornamented by taking some of the same mixture and colouring it to a light pink with beetroot juice, or red currant jelly: the pink icing is best put on in the following manner:â€” take a piece of writing paper and twist it in the form of a loaf of sugar, half fill it with the sugar and egg, leaving a small hole for the stuff to run through; make what figures you please with it. BALAS. A pound and a quarter of flour, a small teacupful of yeast, half a pint of warmed milk, one pound of butter, and four eggs; make a hole in the flour, and pour into it the milk, eggs and yeast, mix them all well together; beat the dough, adding the butter by degrees; let it stand for an hour to rise; then mix * with it half a pound of sifted sugar, and put it into buttered tins. SHORT BREAD. Mix half a pound of the best flour with half a pound of quite fresh butter, work it as little as possible; the butter should be melted before being mixed with the flour; sweeten with half an ounce of very finely sifted sugar, roll it out an inch in thick- ness, and put it into a flat buttered tin; bake in a quick oven till it is quite short.

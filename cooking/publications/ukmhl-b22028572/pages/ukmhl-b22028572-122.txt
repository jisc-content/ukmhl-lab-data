Beat the whites of eight eggs to a stiff froth, then beat them up with the yolks; add a little sugar; with this bake three or four omelettes at once; put them on a dish in the oven, in such a manner that one side only is browned; then take them out, strew them with sugar; bake now another portion in the same manner, lay them on the first, strew them with sugar, and go on thus until all the mixture is used. EGGS ON TOAST. Beat up four eggs, put them into a saucepan with a piece of butter, a little salt, and a spoonful of gravy ; let them get very hot; pour them on toasted bread, with a few mushrooms on the top. EGG ALB.

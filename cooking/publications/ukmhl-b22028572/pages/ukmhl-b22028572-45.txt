MEAT. 25 OYSTER SAUSAGES. Take a pound of veal and a score of oysters, beard them; then pound the veal very finely in a mortar with a little suet, soak a piece of bread in the oyster liquor, pound, and add it with the oysters cut in pieces to the veal, beat up an egg to bind them together, and roll them into little lengths like sausages ; fry them in butter a delicate brown. MEAT. STEWED BEEF. Take a piece of the brisket or rump of beef, put some butter in the bottom of a stewpan, then put in the meat, and partially fry or brown it all over; then take it out and lay two or three skewers at the bottom of the pan, after which replace the meat, which will be prevented sticking to the pan by the skewers, next put in as much water as will half cover the meat, stew it slowly, keeping the pan covered till done ; then take out the meat and thicken the gravy with a little butter and flour; have some boiled carrots and turnips neatly cut, season the gravy with a little salt and ketchup, put the vegetables in it for a few minutes, and then arrange them all round the beef. BEEF STEWED WITH CARROTS. Take a small piece of juicy beef, cut some carrots in thin slices, add a spoonful of flour and four ounces of butter, let them stew well with the beef, put in some salt and some stock if necessary, serve with the carrots over the beef.

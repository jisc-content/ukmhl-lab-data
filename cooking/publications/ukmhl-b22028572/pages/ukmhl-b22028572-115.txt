95 SWEET DISHES, ETC. STANDING CUSTARD. Make custard according to the above receipt, but while it is hot put in the white of the eggs, which must be well beat; then pour it into a mould, in which there should be placed a piece of thin muslin, which will make the shape take out better; steam it in a steamer for twenty minutes, and serve it quite cold, with or without preserves. BAKED SAGO. Pour on half a pound of sago some cold water, then strain it, and boil it in a pint of milk ; add then four ounces of sugar, two ounces of butter, and four yolks of eggs ; mix all well together, with two ounces of raisins and two ounces of currants; put it on a buttered dish with a border of paste; beat up the whites of the eggs, which put on the top, and then bake it for an hour. RICE SHAPE. Wash half a pound of rice, drain it, and put it in a pan with a pint of milk and two ounces of butter; allow it to swell; when cold mix with it the yolks of six eggs, four ounces of butter, a little salt, and quarter of a pound of raisins ; add a cupful of cream and some sifted sugar; put all in a sha]pe, and boil it. EGG AND MILK. Beat up an egg very well in a cup, boil a pint of new milk and pour in into the cup, stirring all the time ; sweeten with sugar, and serve with toasted bread. This will do for breakfast, instead of tea or coffee.

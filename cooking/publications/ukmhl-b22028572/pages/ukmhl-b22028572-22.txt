o SOUPS. TURKISH SOUP. Take some good gravy from a leg of beef; put in it some carrots, turnips, potatoes, peas, and parsnips, with a little salt ; stew all together, and when strained and cleared from the fat, set it on the fire; when it boils add half a pound of rice to three quarts of soup; beat the yolks of two eggs with a quarter of a pint of cream; stir it into the soup. OX TAIL SOUP. Two tails, if properly stewed, will make soup without any addition of meat: they must be cleaned and cut into pieces, and boiled very quietly for several hours in water; put in a crust of bread and a little salt. When tender the liquor must be strained and the fat removed ; thicken it with a little cream, and put in two table spoonfuls of ketchup ; serve up with the tails cut in pieces. Calvesâ€™ tails can be used instead of ox tails. BROWN OR GRAVY SOUP. Take a shin or piece of the rump of beef; cut it in pieces, separate the beef from the bones, put some butter in a pan, and lay the, meat and bones on it to brown ; take care that it does not burn. When thoroughly browned add a pint of cold water and some salt, let it stew quarter of an hour, and then put in sufficient water to make the quantity of soup desired, and let it boil slowly for four or five hours, then let it cool and skim it; then pass it through a sieve. Rice, maccaroni, vermicelli, or sago, may be served in it.

Steep a quarter of a pound of either sago or tapioca in a pint of milk; put it into a pudding dish with four well beat eggs and some sugar : bake it in the oven. SOUFFLE PUDDING. Take a quarter of a pound of sifted sugar, half a pound of flour, and the same quantity of butter, the yolks of six eggs, and, if liked, a tablespoonful of orange juice; beat the whole together very smoothly; then beat the whites of the eggs to a strong froth, and add them to the rest; boil in a mould: it may also be baked; if so, the dish it is baked in must not be filled. EGG PUDDING. Mix two ounces of flour with two teacups of milk and a little butter; boil these things together until they are quite thick, stirring all the time ; when nearly cold, add three ounces of butter and sugar, with six yolks of eggs; beat the whites of the eggs to a froth, and mix them with the rest; boil or bake an hour in a buttered mould. EGG PUDDING. Beat up five or six eggs with half a pint of good cream and a couple of spoonfuls of flour; melt a little butter in a pan on the fire; when it is hot, pour in the mixture, let it brown on one side, turn it out in a dish, heat a little more butter in the pan, lay the pudding gently in on its other side; when this too is brown, serve it in a dish as quickly as possible. This may be eaten with sugar or jam.

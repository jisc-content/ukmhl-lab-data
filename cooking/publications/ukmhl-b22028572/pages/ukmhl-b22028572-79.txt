Boil a few parsnips in milk until they are soft; then cut them lengthwise into bits two or three inches long, and simmer in a white sauce, made of two spoonfuls of broth and half a cupful of cream, a bit of butter, some flour and salt. MASHED PARSNIPS. Boil them tender, scrape, then mash them in a stewpan with a little cream, a good piece of butter, and some salt. SEA-CALE. Wash and prepare nicely sea-cale, boil it tender; toast a thin slice of bread, spread it with butter, lay the sea-cale on it, and pour a simple white sauce made with milk, one egg, and a little flour over it. FRENCH BEANS. Boil quite tender nicely cut french beans ; strain the water from them, and pour over them some sauce made of a little gravy thickened with brown flour and butter. STEWED BEETROOT. Bake the beetroot in an oven until it is quite tender, and when cold scrape off the outside coat; cut it into slices, then put it into a stewpan and cover it with gravy; stew it gently for half an hour, then thicken it with cream; the sauce can be made a brighter colour by pounding some slices in a mortar and extracting the juice.

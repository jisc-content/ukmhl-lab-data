PASTRY. 68 RAMA REINS. Take any bits of puff paste that remain from covering pies, tarts, &c., and roll them out, sprinkle grated cheese over them, double them up, and again sprinkle cheese over them; then cut them into neat shapes and make them very hot: serve in a napkin. CHEESE PATTIES. Beat half a pound of cheese fine in a mortar; then add a quarter of a pound of butter, beat them well together, add five yolks and the white of an egg, continue beating until they are quite smooth; then put into tart pans lined with paste, and bake them. PATTY OF MACARONI. Cover a dish with brioche paste; then having stewed some macaroni in butter and water, or broth, strain it, cut it into pieces and lay it at the bottom of the dish; make up some forcemeat balls mixed with butter, grate some cheese over them and the macaroni; put in some fowl, game, veal, or ox palates cut in slices, on that put some blanched sweetbread cut in slices, and some mushrooms; stew all in a good sauce, put them in layers on the macaroni, fill up the dish with gravy, cover it with paste, and bake it. PRUNE TART. Stone some large prunes, put them in a deep dish with some brown sugar; the stones may be stewed in a very little water, that nothing may be lost of the flavour of the fruit; cover the dish with a light paste, and bake it.

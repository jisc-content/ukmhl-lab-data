After mixing a little salt with the soup, pour it into the tureen, and add pieces of bread. PORTABLE SOUP. Break the bones of a shin of beef, a small knuckle of veal, and a couple of cow’s-heels ; put them into a soup pot that will hold four gallons of water; first cover the meat with water, and set it on the fire to heat gradually till it nearly boils: watch it and skim it carefully while any scum rises ; pour in a quart of cold water to make it throw up any scum that may remain, let it come to a boil again, and skim it with care; when no more scum rises, and the broth ap- pears clear, add the remainder of the water, and let it boil very gently for eight hours. Strain it through a hair sieve into a large brown stone pan, skim off all the grease, and set it where it will cool quickly. Next day pour it as quickly as possible into a three- gallon stew pan, taking care not to allow any of the settlings at the bottom of the pan to get into the stew pan, which is better than straining it. Let it boil as fast as possible in an uncovered stew pan, on a quick fire : pour it into a three-quart stew pan, and if any scum rises take it off with the skimmer. Now watch it all the time till it is reduced to the thickness of a very thick syrup. Take the utmost care it does not burn, for a moment’s inattention at this stage would lose all the previous labour, and spoil the soup. Take a little out in a spoon, and allow it to cool: if it sets into a strong jelly, it is done enough; if it does not, boil it a little longer, until it will jelly. Have ready some small preserve

BREAD AND CAKES. 119 a quarter of a pound of cheese on the top, and cover the whole with grated bread crumbs; then pour some nicely melted butter over the crumbs, and brown it in the oven. MACARONI BROWNED. Boil the macaroni in milk until it is soft, adding salt for seasoning; when tender drain it, and lay it in concentric circles on a dish, placing small pieces of butter and grated cheese on every layer; put a good deal of grated cheese and butter on the top, and put it into the oven for a quarter of an hour; let it be brown on the top. PORRIDGE. Have a quart of water boiling in a pan, stir in by degrees oatmeal until it is thick, let it boil a while, adding a little salt; then pour it out into soup plates, and serve it quite hot with cream or milk: barley meal is made in the same way. BEE AD and CAKES. FRENCH BREAD. To two quarts of flour put a pint of milk, a little salt, two ounces of melted butter, and one ounce of German yeast; whisk the fluids together, and add two beat eggs; mix the flour with it, handling it as little as possible; let the dough rise, and mould the bread into rolls: bake on tins, in a quick oven.

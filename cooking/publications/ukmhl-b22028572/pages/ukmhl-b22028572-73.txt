SAUCES. â€¢33 MUSHROOM KETCHUP. Take the largest mushrooms, which are the juici- est; break them in pieces, put them into a jar with salt sufficient to extract the juice ; cover the jar, and set it by the fire: let it remain thus for twenty-four hours; strain off the juice, and put it into a stewpan, and let it boil ten minutes; then put it into bottles, and cork them well. ALMOND SAUCE. Mix a spoonful of flour in a pint of milk on the fire until it boils; then add half a quarter of a pound of blanched and pounded almonds, and a little sugar. CUSTARD SAUCE. Put a pint of cream into a saucepan, let it boil; mix in the yolk of two eggs, with some fine sifted sugar; put it into a basin, and pour it several times from one to another, to prevent it curdling. SWEET SAUCE. Brown two ounces of butter with the same quantity of sugar over the fire, mix in a table spoonful of flour, add two spoonfuls of water, let it boil, and then put in about two dozen of raisins and a dozen of blanched sweet almonds cut in little bits: add a glass of cream, and boil it half an hour.

63 PASTRY. PUDDING CRUST. Four potatoes boiled, and well mixed with a pound of flour and a little very finely chopped suet, will make a good light pudding crust. CRUST FOR SWEETMEATS. Dry a pound of the finest flour, mix it with three ounces of refined sugar ; then work half a pound of fresh butter with the hand until it is a froth; put the flour into it by degrees, and work into it, well beaten and strained, the yolks of three and whites of two eggs; if too limber, put some flour and sugar to make it fit to roll: line your pattypans, fill them with preserve and cover them; a quarter of an hour will bake them; have ready some refined sugar beat up with the white of an egg till quite thick, ice them all over, set them in the oven to harden, and serve cold. VERY LIGHT PASTE. Mix the flour and water together, roll the paste out, and lay bits of butter upon it; then beat up the white of an egg, and brush it all over the paste before it is folded; repeat this when rolling out, and adding the butter each time, till the whole of the white of egg is used; it will make the paste rise and become very flaky. TART PASTE. Half a pound of sifted flour, a quarter of a pound of butter, two ounces of sifted sugar and two eggs beaten; mix them with cold water, and knead the paste well.

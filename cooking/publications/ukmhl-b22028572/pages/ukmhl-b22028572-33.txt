SOUPS. 13 them through a hair sieve, and add them to some good stock; this soup will be the better for a few spoonfuls of rice boiled until tender, and the beaten yolks of one or two eggs ; the latter must only be heated in the soup, for if allowed to boil they will curdle ; serve up with fried bread. SPLIT PEAS SOUP. This soup can be made with merely the bones of roast beef, which break and put into a pan with about a gallon of water, put in a sufficient quantity of split peas to make the soup rather thick, add also two mashed carrots and two turnips, let it boil two hourp, but stir it often, in case it should burn; when the peas are quite soft pass the soup through a sieve, season it with salt, add a pint of water, and boil the soup up once: serve it with fried bread. VEGETABLE SOUP. Boil a quantity of yellow peas, haricots, or lentils, in water, till they are quite tender; press them gradually through a sieve with the water, working the mixture with a wooden spoon : it should be sufficiently liquid to bear boiling down. Cut some carrots, turnips, and spinach into fine strips, and throw them into boiling water for a few minutes to blanch them ; take them out with a strainer, mix them with the peas, and boil the whole gradually for at least two hours : the soup should be frequently stirred. Add a little salt before serving it. COMMON VEGETABLE SOUP. Three potatoes, three turnips, three parsnips, and three carrots, boiled in a gallon of water, with a handful of green peas, until reduced to nearly half the quantity: add a little salt, and some weak slock, if thought requisite.

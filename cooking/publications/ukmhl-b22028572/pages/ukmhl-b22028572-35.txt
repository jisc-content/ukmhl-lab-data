FOWL SOUP WITH FORCED MEAT BALLS. Take as much stock as will be required; cut the meat off a raw fowl, and make a mince of any per- mitted kind of meat: beat the bones of the fowl in a mortar quite small; let them boil in the soup, and strain all through a hair sieve. Make with the minced meat and fowl some balls,* put them into the soup, and let it boil slowly again: add the necessary salt, and serve it. * In Germany these balls are generally made of paste, with the meat put inside, and are the size of a small orange.

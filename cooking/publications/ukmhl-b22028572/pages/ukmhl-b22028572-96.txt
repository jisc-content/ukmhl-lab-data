PUDDINGS. 76 LIGHT FRUIT PUDDING. Beat four eggs, and mix four tablespoonfuls of flour with them, and a little milk and sugar; let it be a thick batter: spread it over a deep oval pudding dish to the very edge, fill the centre with ripe and juicy small fruit, quite fresh; damsons do best: put the dish in the oven; when done, slip it off the deep dish, and let it stand on a flat one with plenty of juice; if no fresh fruit is in season, preserved will do. FRUIT PUDDING. This pudding may either be made of apples pared and cut in pieces, green unripe gooseberries, currants, cherries, damsons, or bramble berries. The paste generally used for this pudding is made with beef suet finely chopped, and flour, in the proportion of four ounces of suet to a pound of flour; mix it into a dough with water and a little salt, then knead it and roll it out; place the fruit in it, gather up the edges, and tie it in a cloth, or put it in a mould with paste at the top, and tie it in a cloth and boil it. GOOSEBERRY PUDDING. Stew green gooseberries till they will pulp through a sieve; add to them six ounces of butter, four ounces of sugar biscuit, pounded, four eggs well beat, and a little pounded sugar; bake in a deep dish, with a border of paste. CURRANT PUDDING. A pound of minced suet, a pound of bread crumbs or flour, three quarters of a pound of currants, a very little salt, and some sugar; beat in two eggs, and mix it with as much milk as will wet the whole; tie it in a cloth, and boil it three hours; serve it with sweet sauce.

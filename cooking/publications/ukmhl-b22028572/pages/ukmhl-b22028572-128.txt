SWEET DISHES, ETC. 108 apple on each piece of bread; fill the hole made by the removal of the core with white sugar, place a bit of butter the size of a walnut on each hole, put them into a gentle oven, and renew the sugar and butter several times ; they will require twenty minutes or half an hour: be very careful not to let the bread burn, or the apples lose their shape. APPLES IN THEIR DRESSING GOWNS. Roll out a paste made with butter very thin; cut it into square pieces about as large as the hand, touch each corner with beat egg, place a nice small apple in each piece of paste, fold up the ends over the apple, brush all over with beat egg, and bake slowly. RAMARKINS. Take two eggs, two spoonfuls of flour, two ounces of melted butter, and two ounces of grated cheese; mix all well together, and bake it in moulds or tartpans for a quarter of an hour. FRIED RAMARKINS. Grate half a pound of cheese and melt two ounces of butter; when the latter is getting cold mix it with the cheese, and the whites of three well beaten eggs; lay buttered papers on a fryingpan, put slices of bread upon it, and lay the cheese on the top ; set it on the fire for five minutes, then brown it with a salamander.

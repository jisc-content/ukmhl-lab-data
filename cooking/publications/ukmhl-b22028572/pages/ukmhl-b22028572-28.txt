8 SOUPS. season with salt and a tablespoonful of soy: if more soup is wished, add another kidney, or some clear stock drawn from beef. WHITE SOUP. Take two quarts of stock which has been made from a fowl, boil the crumbs of a roll in half a pint of milk, and add to the stock; beat the yolks of two or three hard boiled eggs in a mortar with a little salt, and add it to the soup: the meat of the fowl can also be beaten in a mortar and put in the soup. FOWL AND CARROT SOUP. Steep a fowl in hot water, take it out, wipe it well, and in lieu of a better stock, pass the water in which it was steeped through a cloth, put the fowl in again, add a couple of minced carrots, boil all well in a pot, and add a little salt and butter to taste. Then pass the soup through a hair sieve, enrich it with one or more yolks of eggs, put into the tureen a slice or two of bread, and lay the fowl thereon. Whilst the soup is boiling, cut down a few carrots, stew them in butter, add a handful of flour, and when it is ready pour the soup from the fowl upon it, mix together and pour it upon the fowl in the tureen. STUFFED FOWL OR PIGEON SOUP. The birds for this soup are prepared in the usual manner, only that they are stuffed with veal; the bones are taken out and the skin taken off before they are filled with the stuffing, then they are allowed to boil slowly in weak stock; while the soup is still boiling the fowl or pigeons are taken out and arranged in the tureen before the soup is poured in.

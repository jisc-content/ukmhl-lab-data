23 FISH. CROQUETTES OF FISH. Take some dressed fish, separate it from the bones, mince a pound of it with a little salt, add an egg beaten, with a teacupful of flour, and one of milk, roll it into balls and brush the balls with egg, dredge with bread crumbs, fry them a nice colour, make gravy from the bones and tail stewed in a pint of water. FISH PATE. Raise a wall of mashed potatoes round a dish, divide some fish in flakes, and warm it with a little melted butter, brown the potatoes in the oven or before the fire, pour in the fish, and cover the top with egg sauce. FISH SCALLOPED. Flake some fish, and embed it in bread crumbs moistened with thin melted butter or cream, flavour with a very little ketchup ; cover the top thickly with bread crumbs, lay bits of butter over, and bake it either before the fire or in an oven. OYSTER PIE. As the oysters are opened separate them from the liquor, which strain; parboil the oysters after taking off the beards; do the same to a sweetbread, cut it in slices and put it in layers with the oysters in a deep dish, then put in half a teacupful of the liquor, and the same quantity of gravy; slices of bread should be placed between the oysters and the sweetbread; if no crust is put on, let bread be put at the top ; just before baking, add a teacupful of cream.

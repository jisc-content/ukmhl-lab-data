XVI BEVERAGES. The best of all beverages is water; but as many object to drinking this alone, it may be flavoured with sugar, orange juice, raspberry, strawberry, or currant jam, and in some cases by the addition of a little pure wine- To most individuals accus- tomed to its use light table beer, prepared without the addition of any drugs, may be allowed in moderation. For other permitted beverages we must refer the reader to those described under that head in the text of this work; but we may just observe, that though the employment of tea is altogether condemned by Hahnemann, most of his followers in this country find no bad effects to result from the use of a weak infusion of good black tea. There is no objection to the moderate use of water ices prepared from any of the fruits we have above enumerated. The propriety of partaking of cream ices is to say the least doubtful. One observation it is necessary to make before concluding these preliminary remarks; in no case should any thing be eaten or drunk which expe- rience shews will disagree with the stomach, or otherwise be productive of injurious consequences, and the attendant physician must always be referred to for particular directions relative to the diet in each individual case.

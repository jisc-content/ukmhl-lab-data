SWEET DISHES, ETC. f)8 PANADA. Cut a slice of stale bread in pieces, boil it in water gently, then mash it, and sweeten it with sugar; chicken broth may be used instead of water, and then the seasoning must be salt. BARLEY AND MILK. Boil three ounces of pearl barley in a quart of milk; add two ounces of currants, and if it is too thick add some more milk; the barley must be well boiled. Rice can be done in the same way. ARROWROOT. Have a pint of boiling milk, stir into it an ounce of arrowroot, and sweeten with sifted sugar. RICE PANCAKES. Boil half a pound of rice to a jelly, in a small quantity of water; when cold, mix it with a pint of cream, eight eggs, and a little salt; stir in eight ounces of butter just warmed, and add as much flour as will make the batter thick enough; fry in as little lard or dripping as possible. CREAM PANCAKES. Mix the yolks of two well beaten eggs with a pint of cream and two ounces of sifted sugar; rub the pan with butter, and fry the pancakes thin.

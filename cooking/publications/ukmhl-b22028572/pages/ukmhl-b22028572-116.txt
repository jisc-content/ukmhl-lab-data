SWEET DISHES, ETC. 96 SAGO AND MILK. Boil half a teacupful of sago in two pints of milk ; let it be quite tender; put it into a cup, and serve with cold milk and sugar, or drain it, and press it into little cups, and serve it with cream and preserves. FLOATING ISLAND. Scald an apple before it is quite ripe; beat the whites of two eggs with sugar, and a spoonful of orange juice; mix in the apple, which must have been passed through a sieve ; beat all together, until there is a quantity of froth; serve it on raspberry cream, or the froth may be coloured with beetroot, raspberry or currant jelly, and set on a white cream. FRUMENTY. Boil a quart of wheat, and by degrees mix it with two quarts of new milk ; add four ounces of currants well washed; stir them and boil them well; beat the yolks of three eggs with two or three spoonfuls of milk, mix this to the wheat, allow it to warm, sweeten it with sugar, and serve either hot or cold, in a deep dish. SHAPE OF RICE. Put half a pound of Carolina rice into boiling milk, and let it boil an hour; then put in some butter, sugar, and the yolks of three eggs; beat the whites separately, mix them all well together; butter a mould thickly, and cover it with bread crumbs; put in the rice and allow it to bake an hour; some currants may be mixed with the rice at first : it should be served with custard, or with cream and preserve.

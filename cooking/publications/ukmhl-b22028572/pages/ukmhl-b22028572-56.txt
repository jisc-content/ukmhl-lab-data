MEAT. 3G POTTED HEAD. Take half a bullock’s head, clean it well, and soak it in warm water with a cow’s heel, for two or three hours, then boil it with the heel till tender; when done, cut them in small pieces; strain the liquor in which they were boiled, let it stand till cold, then take off the fat, and put it with the pieces into a stewpan, and let it boil half an hour, season it with salt, pour it into moulds, let it be quite cold ; then turn it out and serve it so. calf’s or lamb’s head. When thoroughly cleaned, the brains should be taken out, the head washed, soaked, blanched, and boiled; the brains well mixed with a little melted butter : brush the head over with the yolk of an egg, cover it with bread crumbs, and brown it before the fire: serve the melted butter and brains for sauce. calves’ ears stuffed. The hair being scalded off the ears, after they have been cut off close to the head, scald and clean them as well as possible; boil them quite tender, and blanch them in cold water: cut the gristle next the head, so as to allow the ears to stand upright. They may be boiled in white gravy instead of water, which will make them richer. When become cold, fill up the cavity with a fine stuffing, either of calf’s liver or cold chicken, with some bread soaked in gravy, an egv, and a little salt; rub an egg over the ears and stuffing, and fry a good brown, and serve with sauce.

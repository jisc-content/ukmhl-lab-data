67 PASTRY. PIGEON PIE. Line the sides of a dish with paste, and put at the bottom either a beef steak or veal cutlet, dredge with flour; clean six young pigeons very nicely, pound a little of the white part of chicken, veal, or turkey very fine; mix four hard boiled yolks Of eggs with it, and a little butter; roll the forcemeat in flour and stuff the pigeons with it; place them in the dish with their breasts downwards, pour some good gravy over them, put on the crust, and stick the feet of the pigeon in the middle. VOL AO VENT OF CROQUETTES. Make croquettes the size of a pigeon’s egg, of veal and of calves’ brains, an equal number of each, fry them a pale gold colour; make a good white sauce and put in some very small mushrooms ; put all into the vol au vent when taken out of the oven. VOL AU VENT OF VEAL. Cut veal into thin pieces the size of half-a-crown, heat them, and fry them a pale brown; make some forcemeat and egg balls, fry the former, and put all into the vol au vent with a good brown gravy. A VOL AU VENT. The brioche paste is the best adapted for this purpose; bake it with a piece of bread to preserve the shape, or round a mould; pour in a mixture of boned chicken, sweetbreads cut in pieces, and cock’s combs, previously stewed in a thick white sauce; make a little of the paste into small balls or bean- shaped pieces, boil them in the gravy, and lay them on the top with leaves and flowers of the crust baked. r 2

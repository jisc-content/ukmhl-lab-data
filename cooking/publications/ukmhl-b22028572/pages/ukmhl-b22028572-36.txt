SOUPS. 16 SOUP WITH PASTE! Make a light dough of about one pound of flour, four yolks of eggs, three-quarters of a pound of butter, and a little milk; make a little ragout of some permitted meat, which season with orange juice. Cut the paste in small pieces, and fill each with the meat, covering it with the paste; dip them quickly into the yolk of an egg, and cut them neat with a paste wheel: bake in butter, and put them into a plain brown soup. FORCED ROLL SOUP. Make a plain soup; take little rolls about the size of a crown piece, cut off the top to form a cover, take out all the crumb, put in instead minced meat, re- place the top, and cement the edges with mixed flour and white of egg, so that in the baking the meat may not come out: then each roll must be covered with a brush dipped in a beat egg, and sprinkled over with flour and grated bread, then baked in plain butter. When served, put the rolls in the tureen, and pour the soup on them. SOUP WITH ITALIAN BALLS. Beat half a pound of butter to a cream, with six yolks, and one whole egg ; soak eight ounces of bread in milk, press it out, and add quarter of a pound of flour. Boil a fowl; cut the breast off, mince it quite fine, and mix it up with the other materials, and of this form small balls. When the soup is nearly done, put these balls into the soup, and let them boil well.

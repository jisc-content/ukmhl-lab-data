139 BEVERAGES. TOAST AND WATER. Toast slowly a piece of bread ; let it be very brown but not black; plunge it into a little boiling water and fill up the jug with cold water; cover it up and let it become quite cold, and of' a bright brown. ORANGEADE. Squeeze and strain the juice of a large orange, put it into a pint of cold water, and if necessary add a little sifted sugar. ORGEAT. Beat two ounces of sweet almonds with a spoonful of orange juice, and pour on it a quart of milk and water; sweeten with sugar. SWEET BUTTER MILK. Milk a cow into a small churn and begin to churn the milk ten minutes after it has been drawn; continue churning until the flakes of butter swim about pretty thick, and the milk is thin and blue; strain through a sieve. COCOA* Take two ounces of cocoa nibs and put them in a coffee boiler (but which has never been used for making coffee) with two pints of water; allow it to simmer for eight hours by the side of the fire, and then pour it gently off for use, leaving the nibs in the boiler, to which, if another ounce is added, it will make other two pints, but it should not be used oftener than twice. * Prepared cocoa and chocolate, without any admixture of spices, are to be had of any of the Homoeopathic Chemists. From experience we can recommend those prepared and sold by Mr. Headland, Princes-street, Hanover-square, as very delicious beverages. By those however who dislike the prepared cocoa, that given in the text will often be relished.

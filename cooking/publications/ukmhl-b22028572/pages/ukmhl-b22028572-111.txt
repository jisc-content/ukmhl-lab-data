SWEET DISHES, ETC. 91 CARSTORPHINE CREAM. Take two quarts of new milk, put it into a deep basin, set the basin inside a much larger one, and pour quite boiling water into it, taking care that no water gets into the milk; when the water gets cold change it until the milk seems to be quite thick, let the whey run off and squeeze the thick part dry: serve it with sifted sugar. RUSSIAN CREAM. Three whites of eggs to eight ounces of fine sifted sugar, the whites of the eggs to be first beat up alone, and then the sugar put in by degrees while beating: take five pieces of writing paper, on each with a spoon put an oval ring, an inch in thickness, of the prepared sugar and eggs; the largest ring should be made so as to go easily into the dish in which it will be sent to table, the other rings to decrease gradually so as just to rest on each other, when placed according to size on one another; place the papers with the rings in a slow oven; the rings must only be done to a very light brown, and should when cold be quite crisp, which chiefly depends on the eggs being well beat; when arranged on the dish fill the centre with whipped cream. ARROWROOT CREAM. Take a teaspoonful of arrowroot, mix it till quite smooth in a little cold milk; boil a pint of fresh milk with a lump of sugar, pour it boiling on the arrow- root, and stir it till it thickens: this may be put in a form, then allowed to cool, turned out, and served with cream.

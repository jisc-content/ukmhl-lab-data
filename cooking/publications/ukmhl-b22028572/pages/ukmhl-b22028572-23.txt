SOUPS. 3 CHEAP SOUP. Take one pound of lean beef, cut into small pieces; add to it seven pints of water, one pint of whole or split peas, one pound of potatoes sliced, three ounces of rice, and a little salt; boil gently until it is reduced to four pints ; if considered too simple, add fried cabbage, or it may be pulped through a cullender and sent up with fried bread. A SIMPLE SOUP. Take three quarts of good broth ; cut into a stew pan two carrots, three or four turnips, and a little butter, salt, and gravy; stew until the vegetables become quite tender, so as to permit them to be rubbed through a sieve ; to this may be added a few spoonfuls of rice or pearl barley, boiled separately : add the whole together, and boil for quarter of an hour. GRAVY SOUP WITH RED CABBAGE. Cut a red cabbage after it is cleaned in quarters or half quarters, arrange it with a quarter of a pound of butter in an appropriate pan, and allow it to steam slowly ; then fill it up with good soup, and when sufficiently boiled season it with the necessary salt. MARROW BONE SOUP. Make a good gravy soup ; saw through the marrow bone, put it in the soup, and let it boil one hour; while this is doing put a pan on the fire with water, and as soon as it boils, put in a little salt and the juice of a ripe orange ; drop twelve or more eggs into this water, but only leave them in it until they swim on the top; put them as you take them out 15 2

PRESERVES. 136 APPLE JELLY. Pare and core a peck of codlins; put them into a well tinned stewpan with sufficient water to cover them ; boil the whole to a pulp, and let it run through a flannel bag ; to every pint of juice put half a pound of loaf sugar; let it boil until it jellies; skim it, and put it into pots or moulds. August is the best time to make this jelly, when the codlins are full grown, but not turned. DRIED CURRANTS. Dissolve a sufficient quantity of gum Arabic in a basin of water to make it rather thick; have also a plateful of pounded sugar; dip bunches of ripe red currants into the gum water, and then roll them in the sugar; lay them separately on a dish to dry in the sun: they will not keep well. FRUIT LOZENGES FOR DESSERT. Take currants, cherries, or apricots, stoned; put them into a jar in a pan of water, scald them, and strain them through a sieve, and put to every pint of juice the same weight of finely sifted sugar, and the white of an egg ; beat all together until it becomes quite thick ; then put it upon buttered paper in a slow oven; let it remain there until it will quit the paper; then let it dry, and cut it in shapes.

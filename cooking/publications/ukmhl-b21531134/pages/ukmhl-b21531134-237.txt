MADE DISHES, 151 Chap. VIII.] LIVER PUDDINGS.—E. R. Take a pound of calves’ or hogs’ liver, boil it, ai>d chop or pound it fine; take half a pound of bacon, and mince it small; steep the crumbs of two penny-rolls in milk, and press it; add pepper and salt, and a small quantity of sweet herbs ; mix it up with a little cream and a little melted lard, in order that the puddings may be moist, without offending the stomach by too much fat. These puddings may be varied by toasted oatmeal, boiled rice, or groats; but in adding these things pounded suet should be added in proportion, or they will be dry, FOWL OR RABBIT PUDDINGS.—E. R. Take the remains of a fowl, rabbit, or hare; when boiled or roasted, free it from the bones, and cut it small. Boil some onions in strong gravy; when the onions are quite soft, pound them, season with salt, pepper, parsley, two cloves, and a blade of mace; pound the meat also, cut some bacon into small pieces, and add it. Mix up these ingredients with the yolk of egg, add a little lemon-juice or lemon-pickle, or chop a little sorrel with the herbs, fill the skins, and broil the puddings. POTATO PUDDINGS —E. R. Take an equal quantity of the flour of roasted pota- toes, and the meat of cold fowl, rabbit, hare, «&c., well chopped and pounded. Pound them well together with a little butter, season with salt, pepper, and spices ; moisten it with yolks of eggs, one after the other: when well mixed, whip the whites, and add them; roll them in dour into shapes, then brush them with yolk of egg or clarified butter, roll them in bread-crumbs, and either broil or roast them in a Dutch oven. Make a gravy from the bones of the fowl, &c., and serve it up.

FISH. Chap. II.] 47 I BAKEn COD.—E. B. r ! Butter a pan, lay the fish in it, with a bundle of sweet I I herbs, an onion stuck with six cloves, a spoonful of f ( black and white pepper, salt, and a quart of water; 1 flour the fish, stick it over with pieces of butter, and add to it raspings of bread. When sufficiently baked, I take out the fish carefully, strain the gravy, thicken it, i and add to it a pint of shrimps, half a pint of oysters, a , spoonful of essence of anchovies, and a glass of Harvey 1 or Reading sauce; warm altogether, and pour it round the fish ; garnish with lemon, crisped parsley, and fried ■ bread, or paste. Codlings are very good dressed in this manner. COD ESPAGNOLE.—E. R. Bone the tail of a cod, and cut it into slices, season ' them with white pepper and salt, then fry them, and I when cold put them into a pickle made of vinegar ■ boiled with peppercorns, a few cloves, and mace, and i bay leaves; add when cold a tea-cupful of sweet oil; lay the fish in a jar with slices of onion between each, and cover the whole with the vinegar. Salmon may be pickled in the same manner. When served up at table put a sufficient number of pieces in the centre of a dish, and raise round it a wall of salad. STEWED COD.—E. R. Cut the cqd into slices, season them with peppdrand salt, put them into a stewpan with half a pint of water, and some good gravy. After stewing a few minutes, add half a pint of wine, the juice of half a lemon, a dozen or two of oysters with their liquor, a piece of butter rolled in flour, and two or three blades of mace. When the fish is sufficiently stewed, which will be in a quarter* of an hour, serve it up with the sauce. Any ki"d of fish-sauce may be substituted for the wine, and a variety offered by employing anchovies instead of oysters.

Chap. III.] G.4ME. 99 PHE.\SANTS.—E. R. It is not in general usual to stuff pheasants: they , are sometimes larded; but the following forcemeat will be found a great improvement. Cut a piece of lean veal into small dice, with about a third of bacon also minced, season it with a little pepper, and put it into the body of the pheasant, which must be tied, to prevent the escape of the stuffing, or roasted with the head down- wards. The gravy from the veal will diffuse itself through the pheasant, and render it more juicy and ten- ■ der; while the bacon is always to be preferred when put inside a bird, though the outer larding may be more ornamental. Beef is sometimes substituted for veal. PARTRIDGES—(E. R.) Being less dry than pheasants, do not require stuffing, although they are improved by it, made either of chest- ! nuts, or truffles, and bacon. They are sometimes roast- I ed, wrapped in bacon and vine-leaves: the bread-crumbs 1 are essential. In some parts of Kent partridges are sent up with forcemeat-balls in the dish. GROUSE .AND MOOR COCK—(E. R.) ' Are sent to table plainly roasted, with fried bread- • 1 crumbs and bread-sauce. WTLD DUCKS—(E. R.) Must be roasted at a very brisk fire: they take from five to twelve minutes, according to the preference for raw meat, and will not be thoroughly cooked under a quarter of an hour. Some people are of opinion that they should only fly through the kitchen ; by epicures they are considered to be in true perfection when they come up dry and brown, and, when cut, flood the dish with gravy. The means of ensuring success consists in a very ardent fire, rapid motion of the spit, and con- stant basting. The carver should score the breast of the duck, put a piece of butter on it and squeeze a H 2

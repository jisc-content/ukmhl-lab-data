[Chav. III. 86 DOMESTIC COOKEUY. the kitchen to be broiled, will be found a great improve- ment upon boiled mutton. It is sent to table with caper-sauce. Members of the Yacht Club and captains of ships arc recommended, when they have fresh mutton, to tow it overboard for some hours, and then lay it up in the shrouds. It will then be coated with briny par- ticles, which will effectually keep in all the juices. Shoulder of mutton is sometimes salted and boiled, and served up smothered with onions. NECK OF MUTTON.â€”E. R. Boil the neck very gently until it is done enough, then, half an hour or twenty minutes before serving, cover it thickly with bread-crumbs and sweet herbs chopped, with a little drawn butter or the yolk of an egg, and put it into a Dutch oven before the fire. By this pro- cess the meat will taste much better than if merely roasted or boiled; the dryness attendant upon roasting will be removed, and the disagreeable greasiness which boiled meat, mutton especially, exhibits will utterly disappear. Too much cannot be said of this method of dressing neck and breast of mutton, for the liquor they have been boiled in will make very good soup. The latter, the breast, after being boiled, may be boned, covered with forcemeat rolled round, and then roasted. The best end of a neck of mutton makes a good roast, but even the scrag may be sent to table, when cooked according to the above directions. TO KEEP VErVL. The first part that turns bad of a leg of veal is where the udder is skewered back. The skewer should be taken out, and both that and the whole of the meat wiped every day, by which means it will keep good three or four days in hot weather, if the larder be a good one. Take care to cut out the pipe that runs along the chine of a loin of veal, as you do of beef, to hinder it from tainting. The skirt of the breast of veal is like- wise to be taken off, and the inside of the breast wiped and scraped, and sprinkled with a little salt.

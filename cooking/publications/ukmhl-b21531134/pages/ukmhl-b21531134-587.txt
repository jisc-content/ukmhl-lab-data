CHiP.XXIV.] MILK. 507 SAGO. To prevent the earthy taste, soak it in cold water an hour, pour that off, and wash it well; then add more, and simmer gently till the berries are clear, with lemon- peel and spice, if approved. Add wine and sugar, and boil all up together. SAGO MILK. Cleanse, as above, and boil it slowly, and wholly with new milk. It swells so much, that a small quantity will be sufficient for a quart, and when done it will be diminished to about a pint. It requires no sugar or flavouring. ASSES’ MILK Far surpasses any imitation of it that can he made. It should he milked into a glass that is kept warm by being in a basin of hot water. The fixed air that it contains gives some people a pain in the stomach. At first a tea-spoonful of rum may be taken with it, but should only be put in the moment it is to be swallowed. ARTIFICIAL ASSES’ MILK. Boil together a quart of water, a quart of new milk, an ounce of white sugar-candy, half an ounce of eringo- root, and half an ounce of conserve of roses, till half be wasted. This is astringent, therefore proportion the doses to the effect, and the quantity to what will be used while sweet. ANOTHER. Mix two spoonsful of boiling water, two of milk, and an egg well beaten; sweeten with pounded white sugar- candy. This may be taken twice or thrice a-day.

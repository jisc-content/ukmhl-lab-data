DOMESTIC COOKERY. 476 [Chap. XXII. for the above is twelve quarts. Those who gather from their own garden may not have sufficient to put in at once, and may add as they can get them, keeping ac- count of each quart. When it ceases to hiss, and the flowers are all in, stop it up for four months. Rack it off, empty the barrel of the dregs, and, adding a gal- lon of the best brandy, stop it up, and let it stand six or eight weeks, then bottle it. EXCELLENT COWSLIP WINE. To every gallon of water weigh three pounds of lump-sugar, b^oil the quantity half an hour, taking off the scum as it rises. When cool enough, put to it a crust of toasted bread dipped in thick yest, let the liquor ferment in a tub thirty-six hours ; then into the cask put for every gallon the peel of two and rind of one lemon, and both of one Seville orange, and one gallon of cowslip-pips, then pour on them the liquor. It must be carefully stirred every day for a week ; then to every five gallons put in a bottle of brandy. Let the cask be close stopped, and stand only six weeks be- fore you bottle off. Observe to use the best corks. GINGER WINE.â€”E. R. Peel three large lemons very thin, and put with them two ounces of the best white ginger bruised. Mix two pounds of loaf-sugar with a gallon of water on the fire, and boil until the scum rises; take this clearly off; then add the lemon-peel and ginger, let them boil half an hour, then put the whole into a tub, allow it to cool, and, when rather more than milk-warm, add the juice of the lemons, and half a pound of raisins well chopped. Then put the liquor into a cask, and stir in about three table-spoonsful of good yest. Fill up the cask once a- day for six days. Then put in about the fifth part of a bottle of brandy to each gallon, or half an ounce of isinglass as the proportion to five gallons. Reserve a pint of wine to fill up with while working.

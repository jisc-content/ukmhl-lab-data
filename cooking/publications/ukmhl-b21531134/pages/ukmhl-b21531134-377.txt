297 Chap. .\V.] CURRY. PISH PASH.—E. R. Take about three pounds of the neck of mutton, boil it until tender; prepare a small tea-cupful of rice by bruising it raw in a mortar; then cut the meat into email pieces ; throw the rice, meat, and an onion sliced into the water in which the meat was boiled, adding a small piece of mace, and a few peppercorns tied in a muslin bag ; boil till the rice and onions are sufficiently done; take out the muslin bag, season with salt, and serve up. A chicken may be used instead of tht mut- ton. COUNTRY CAI>TAIN.—E. R.

When the onion is perfectly brown, it is enough. It may be served up with rice. HINDOSTANEE KUWAB FOWL.—E. R. Rub smooth in a mortar half an ounce of coriander- *seed, three onions, a drachm of red pepper, the same of pounded ginger, and four cloves. Put four ounces of salt butter on the fire in a stewpan. Rub a fowl inside and outside with the pounded ingredients; truss it nicely; put it into the butter, and fry it a fine brown, turning it continually. This is a sort of salamander very acceptable to the lovers of fiery dishes : it should be eaten with lemon-juice squeezed over it.

Chap.V. DOMESTIC COOKERY. 120 CHAPTER V MADE DISHES OF BEEF. RUMP OF BEEF A-LA-MODE.—E. R. The Dame of this dish is rather against it, suggesting ideas connected with London eating-houses; but it would be very erroneous to suppose that the old family receipts now given hear any resemblance to the degene- rate successors of those cooks who formerly established a reputation for this savoury compound. Cut out the bone from the beef, and convert it, with the trimmings, into gravy; then stuff the orifice with rich forcemeat, made with veal and oysters, and the crumb of a roll steeped in milk. Half roast it, and before it is put into the stewpan lard the top with dried and pickled mush- rooms, adding mushroon-powder in the orifices; then put in two quarts of gravy from the bones, a large onion stuck with cloves, and two carrots cut in slices. When the beef has stewed till it is quite tender, strain and thicken the sauce, add to it a glass of wine, mushrooms and oysters, and sippets of fried paste: either the mush- rooms or oysters may be omitted, if the pure flavour of either should be more desirable; warm a few pickles with the garnish, and send it up very hot. A LA-MODE BEEF.—E. R. Take a part of the rump of beef, or two of the ribs, boned and rolled, stick it with some whole allspice, whole pepper and cloves, and cover it well with vinegar. Let it remain in pickle for ten days, and then put the whole into a stewpan with two or three bay-leaves; stew the beef for several hours until it is tender ; then strain the gravy, and add that of two calves’-feet, or ox-tail boiled down to a jelly, and nicely seasoned.

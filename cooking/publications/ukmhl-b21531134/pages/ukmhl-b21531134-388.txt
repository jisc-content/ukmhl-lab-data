308 DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XVI. any butter or fat, and set it on a fire covered, but take care it does not burn; let it stay till all the gravy that comes out of the meat is dried up into it again, often shaking it: put as much water as will cover the meat, and let that stew away. Then put to the meat a small quantity of water, herbs, onions, spice, and a bit of lean ham; simmer till it is rich, and keep it in a cool place. Do not take off the fat till going to be used. ANOTHER WAY. Lay meat at the bottom of a stewpan, with two or three ounces of butter, and herbs and roots strewed over it: cover close, and set it on a slow part of the stove. When the gravy is drawn out, shake it into the meat, and let it remain till nearly dried up again; then add as much water as required. CONSOMMkE.â€”E. R. Consommde forms the basis of all the finer kinds of sauces and gravies, and is known to the plain English cook by the name of stock. Put into a stewpan a part of the scrag of veal cut into pieces, with the bones, and some slices of ham or gammon of bacon, together with any trimmings of meat at hand, adding an onion, a bundle of parsley and mushrooms, if they can be ob- tained. Moisten the meat with a small quantity of water or broth; when the gravy is well drawn, add boiling water or broth, skim it well, and stew it until it is strong enough to jelly. When cold, strain it, and the next day remove every particle of fat. The consommee of game, poultry, and rabbit is made exactly in the same manner. Get all the bones and trimmings, and when the best portions are only required for fricassee, &c., take the backs and legs, stew them in broth with a ham-bone, onions and parsley, until all the goodness is extracted; then, after straining and re- moving the fat, boil it down to a glaze, and thicken it with white or hrown roux; consommde of game, when thickened, is known as Espagnole.

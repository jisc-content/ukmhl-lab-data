24 [Chap. I. DOMESTIC COOKERY. a lobster, and add this to it, with a quart of good beef-gravy; and also the tails of the cray-fish, or the prawns. LOBSTER SOUP.—E. R. The stock of this soup may he made of small codlings, small eels, plaice, flounders, or any fish not of sufficient consequence to be dressed in any other way. Clean and cut them in pieces, take the meat out of one or two lob- sters, cut it into small but handsome pieces, and lay it aside; break the shell and add it to the fish for the stock, which should be boiled gently for several hours; take the coral of the lobster, pound it in a mortar, with a small piece of the stock partly pounded, and make it up into forcemeat-balls, with a little chopped pai’sley, bread-crumbs, and an egg. When the stock is suffici- ently done, strain it, thicken it with butter and flour, or cream ; warm the lobster in it, and send it up with the forcemeat-balls. OYSTER SOUP.—E. R. Open two or three dozen of oysters very carefully, in order to save all the liquor; take off the beards, and put them with the liquor into a stewpan, with some small fish, or slices of any of the common kind that are cheap, such as skate, ling, &c. Stew the whole for some hours, strain, and thicken it, adding, if thought proper, some essence of anchovies, or any fish-sauce ; put in the oysters, which should be of the small kind, just long enough to be warm through before serving up. CODLING SOUP.—E. R. Take the meat from a codling, pound it in a mortar with half a pint of shrimps shelled; shred some parsley, and pound the whole with the crumb of a roll pre- viously soaked in milk; make the mixture up into balls with an egg; season with mace and pepper, and stew down two or three codlings into good broth , strain it, take out the meat, pulp it through a sieve,

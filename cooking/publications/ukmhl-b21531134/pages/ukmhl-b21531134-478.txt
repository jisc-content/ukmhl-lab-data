DOMESTIC COOKERY. 398 [Chap. XIX. N.B. Though simple, this will be found a good re- ceipt. COMPOSITION SWEETMEAT.—E. R. Take two pottles of ripe red gooseberries, two of red raspberries, two of strawberries (the pines are best), and three pints of ripe red currants; bruise and mix them together in a deep dish, and to every pint of the fruit put a pound of sugar beat pretty fine ; then boil it for half an hour, stirring it all the time it is on the fire. Cherries may also be added, first taking out the stones: measure them with the other fruit for the weight of sugar. CHERRY J.4.M.—E. R. Stone four pounds of cherries, and put them in a preserving-pan with two pounds of fine white sugar and a pint of red currant-juice. Boil the whole together rather fast, until it stiffens, and then put it into pots for use. GOOSEBERRY JAM.—E. R. Stalk and crop six pounds of the small red rough gooseberry, put them into a preserving-pan, and, as they warm, stir and bruise them to bring out the juice. Let them boil for ten minutes, then add four pounds of sugar, and place it on the fire again: let it boil, and continue boiling for two hours longer, stirring it all the time to prevent its burning. When it thickens, and will jelly upon a plate, it is done enough. Put it into pots, and allow it to remain a day before it is covered. CURRANT JELLY WITHOUT BOILING.—E. R. Press the juice from the currants, and make it quite hot, but it must not be allowed to boil. To each pint of juice add a full pound of loaf-sugar, pounded very fine, and made quite hot in the oven, and then stirred gradually into the hot juice until it is melted.

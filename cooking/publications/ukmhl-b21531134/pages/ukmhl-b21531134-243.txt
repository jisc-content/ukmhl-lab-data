Let them stew in this way for about three - quarters of an hour, taking off the butter and scum; then reduce the sauce made from the bones and thicken it with cream and the yolk of an egg, and send it to table. Another side dish may be made of the legs boned and filleted, and fried in batter. In filleting, take out the bone, skin, sinews, &c.; make a nice force- meat ; stuff, and roll the fillets round. The four legs will thus make eight pieces, which will be sufficient for a small dish, and these may be augmented by small pieces of fried paste cut into crescents, cockscombs, or other shapes. They must be served round a puree of some kind in the centre. FRICASSEE OF FOWL.â€”E. R.

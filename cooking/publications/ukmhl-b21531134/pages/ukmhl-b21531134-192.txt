I^Chap. IV. DOMESTIC COOKERY. 112 . veal, with layers of pounded ham between; cut some pickled cucumbers and mushrooms into small pieces, with some sweet herbs well seasoned j strew them over the surface, then roll up the veal very tightly, tie it in a cloth, and let it stew gently for six hours. Then put a heavy weight upon it, and let it stand two days before it is cut; serve it in slices with savory jelly ; any kind of boned game or fowl may be added. VEAL CUTLETS.—E. R. Some persons have deprecated the practice of beat- ing meat, but it is essentially necessary in veal cutlets, which otherwise, especially if merely fried, are very in- digestible. They should be cut about three-quarters of an inch in thickness, and beaten until every fibre is separated; they will then, when fried, taste like sweet- bread, be quite as tender, and nearly as rich. Many cooks after frying the cutlets stew them in water boiled in the pan. CUTLETS A LA ITALIENNE.—E. R. Chop a quantity of sweet herbs, parsley being the predominant; melt a little butter on tbe fire and then warm the herbs in it; cut the cutlets into handsome shapes, brush them with the yolk of egg, then lay on the butter and herbs with a knife, and cover them well ' % with bread-crumbs; this process should be repeated; fry them of a fine brown, if glazed; they must be put be- tween papers to press all the grease out, then brush them over with the glaze, and send them to table. CUTLETS WITH WHITE SAUCE.—E. R. Cut thin slices of undressed veal, hack them with the back of a knife each way, dip them in eggs and bread- crumbs, with a little chopped parsley; fry them in butter, lay them on a sieve as they are done, and serve them with white sauce as for fricassee.

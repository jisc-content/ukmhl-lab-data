PRESERVES. 377 Chap. XIX.] aware that in two or three minutes a syrup over the fire will pass from one gradation to another, called by the confectioners degrees of boiling, of which there are six, and those subdivided. But I am not versed in the mi- nutite, and only make the observation to guard against underboiling, which prevents preserves from keeping ; and quick boiling, and long, which brings them to candy. Attention, without much practice, will enable a person to do any of the following sorts of preserves, &c., and they are as much as is wanted in a private family; the higher articles of preserved fraits may be bought at less expense than they can be made. Jellies of fruit made with equal quantity of sugar, that is, a pound to a pint, require no very long boiling. A pan should be kept for the purpose of preserving; of double block-tin, with a bow-handle opposite the straight one for safety, will do very well ; and if put by nicely cleaned in a dry place, when done with, will last for several years. Those of copper or brass are im- proper, as the tinning wears out by the scraping of the sweetmeat-ladle. There is a new sort of iron with a strong tinning, which promises to wear long. Sieves and spoons should be kept likewise for sweet things. Preserves keep best in drawers that are not connected with a wall. If there be the least damp, cover them only with paper dipped in brandy, laid quite close; putting a little fresh over in spring, to prevent insect mould. Dried sweetmeats, cakes, &c., should be kept in tin boxes, between layers of white paper, in a very dry, but not hot room. When any sweetmeats are directed to be dried in the sun or in a stove, it will be be.st, in private families, where there is not a regular stove for the purpose, to put them in the sun on flag-stones, which reflect the heat, and place a garden glass over them to keep insects off; or if put into an oven, take care not to let it be too warm, and watch that they do properly and slowly.

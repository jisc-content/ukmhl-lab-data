DOMESTIC COOKERY. 506 [Chap. XXIV, CHOCOLATE. Those who use much of this article will find the following mode of preparing it both useful and eco- nomical :â€”cut a cake of chocolate in very small bits ; put a pint of water into the pot, and, when it boils, put in the above; mill it off the fire until quite melted, then on a gentle fire till it boil; pour it into a basin, and it will keep in a cool place eight or ten days, or more. When wanted, put a spoonful or two into milk, boil it with sugar, and mill it well. This, if not made thick, is a very good breakfast or supper. PATENT COCOA Is a light wholesome breakfast. SALOOP. Boil a little water, wine, lemon-peel, and sugar toge- ther: then mix with a small quantity of the powder, previously rubbed smooth with a little cold water; stir it all together, and boil it a few minutes. MILK PORRIDGE. Make a fine gruel of half-grits, long boiled; strain off; either add cold milk, or warm with milk, as may be approved. FRENCH MILK PORRIDGE. Stir some oatmeal and water together, let it stand to be clear, and pour off the latter; pour fresh water upon it, stir it well, let it stand till next day ; strain through a fine sieve, and boil the water, adding milk while doing. The proportion of water must he small. This is much ordered, with toast, for the breakfast of weak persons abroad. GROUND RICE MILK. Boil one spoonful of ground rice, rubbed dovm smooth, with three half-pints of milk, a bit of cinna- mon, lemon-peel, and nutmeg. Sweeten when nearly done.

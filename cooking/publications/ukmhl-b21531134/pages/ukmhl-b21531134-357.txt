OMELETTE SOUFFLfi.—E. R. Separate the whites from the yolks of six eggs, taking I care to remove the specks : add to the yolks two spoons- ful of dry pounded sugar and a little lemon-juice, work them well together. Whip the whites until they are I firm, then mix them with the rest. Put a small piece I of butter into the frying-pan, let it melt upon a slow fire, then add the omelette, taking great cai’e that it does I not burn; turn it out upon a dish, glaze by strewing sugar over it; then put it into the oven: when it has risen glaze it again, and serve it. Orange-flower water i may be used instead of lemon-juice. FRENCH OMELF.TTE.—E. R. Take four eggs, beat the yolks and whites together I with a table-spoonful of milk, a little salt and pepper; I put two ounces of butter in the pan, and let it remain 1 for five minutes; beat the eggs for the same time, pour I them into the pan, and allow them to remain quiet for a few minutes, taking care to separate the omelette gently I from the bottom of the pan with a fork : now shake it 1 to keep it from burning at the bottom. It will not take I more than five minutes frying. Chopped parsley, onions, or kidney may be added; and omelettes are judiciously varied by mixing grated ham or tongue, an- I chovies or oysters, chopped. Any kind of vegetables will be admissible, particu- larly asparagus-tops previously boiled: tomatos, scalded I and beaten through a sieve, are much approved. Some ’ cooks add a spoonful of rich gravy to the beaten eggs, ( others the juice of an orange or lemon ; the omelette is I only to be fried on one side, and served up doubled I over; the pan should be one made on purpose, and rather deep, but a common frying-pan will suffice,

[Ch\p. III. 90 DOMESTIC COOKERY. rub it after the first. When to be dressed weigh it; let it lie half an hour in cold water to make it white; allow a quarter of an hour for every pound, and half an hour over from the time it boils up: skim it as soon as it boils, and frequently after; but do not boil it fast, or it will be hard. Allow water enough. Save some of it to make peas-soup. Some boil it in a very nice cloth, floured, which gives a very delicate look. Serve peas- pudding and turnips with it. The moment the pig is killed put it into cold water for a few minutes ; then rub it over with a little reein, beaten extremely small, and put it into a pail of scald- ing water half a minute ; take it out, lay it on a table, and pull off the hair as quickly as possible : if any part does not come off, put it in again. When quite clean, wash it well with warm water, and then in two or three cold waters, that no flavour of the resin may remain. Take off all the feet at the first joint; make a slit down the belly, and take out the entrails: put the liver, heart, and lights to the feet. Wash the pig well in cold water, dry it thoroughly, and fold it in a wet cloth to keep it from the air. If you can get it when just killed this is of great ad- vantage. Let it be scalded, which the dealers usually do; then put some sage, a large piece of stalish white bread, salt, and pepper, into the belly, and sew it up. Observe to skewer the legs back, or the under part will not crisp. Lay it to a brisk fire till thoroughly dry; then have ready some butter in a dry cloth, and rub the pig with it in every part. Dredge as much flour over as will possibly lie, and do not touch it again till ready to serve; then scrape off the flour very carefully with a blunt knife, rub the pig well with a buttered cloth, and take off the head while at the fire; take out >rains and mix them witli the gravy that comes fro e pia!

SWEET DISHES. Chap. XX.] 409 .\N EXCELLENT TRIFLE. Lay macaroons ami ratafia-drops over the bottom of your dish, and pour in as much raisin-wine as they will suck up; which when they have done, pour on them cold rich custard made with more eggs than directed in tlie foregoing pages, and some rice-flour.

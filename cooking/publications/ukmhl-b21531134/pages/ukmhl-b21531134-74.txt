[Chat, I. DOMESTIC COOKERY. 4 GENERAL DIRECTIONS RESPECTING SOUPS AND GRAVIES. When there is any fear of gravy-meat being spoiled before it is wanted, season well, and fry it lightly, which will preserve it two days longer; but the gravy is best when the juices are fresh. When soups or gravies are to be put by, let them be changed every day into fresh scalded pans. What ever has vegetables boiled in it is apt to turn sour sooner than the juices of meat. Never keep any gravy, &c., in metal. When fat remains on any soup, a tea-cupful of flour and water mixed quite smooth, and boiled in it, will take it off. If richness or greater consistency be wanted, a good lump of butter mixed with flour, and hoiled in the soup, will give either of these qualities. Long boiling is necessary to give the full flavour of the ingredients, therefore time should be allowed for soups and gravies; and they are best if made the day before they are wanted. Soups and gravies are far better when the meat is put at the bottom of the pan, and stewed, and the herbs, roots, &c., with butter, than when water is put to the meat at first; and the gravy that is drawn from the meat should be almost dried up before the water is put to it. Do not use the sediments of gravies, &c., that have stood to be cold. When onions are strong, boil a turnip with them, if for sauce : this will make them mild. If soups or gravies are too weak, do not cover them in boiling, that the watery particles may evaporate. STOCK FOR SOUPS.â€”E. R. Ox-cheek, shin or leg of heef, make an excellent stock for soups. Break the hone, and cut the meat in pieces; add to it a piece of leap bacon, or ham, or the bones of either : the proportion of the former should be a pound and a half to seven pounds of the beef.

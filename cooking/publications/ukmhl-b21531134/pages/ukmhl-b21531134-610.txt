DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. X.\IV. 530 TO BLACKEN THE FRONTS OF STONE CIIIMNEY-FIECES. Mix oil-varnish with lamp-black, and a little spirit of turpentine to thin it to the consistence of paint.

An equal quantity of fresh spirit of vitriol and lemon- juice being mixed in a bottle, shake it well; wet the spots, and in a few minutes rub with soft linen till they disappear.

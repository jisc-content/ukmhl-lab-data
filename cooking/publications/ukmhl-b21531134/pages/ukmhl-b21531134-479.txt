Take of red and white currants equal quantities, tie them down close in a jar, put them into a kettle of water over a slow fire to boil for two hours: strain the liquor through a fine sieve, but do not squeeze the cur- rants hard: then to every pint of juice .put three- i quarters of a pound of loaf-sugar pounded : «et it over I a very slow fire until the sugar is dissolved.

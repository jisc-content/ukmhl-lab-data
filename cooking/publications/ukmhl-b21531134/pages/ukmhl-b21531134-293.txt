Mix three-quarters of a pound of currants or raisins, one pound of suet, one pound of flour, six eggs, a little good milk, some lemon-peel, a little salt. Boil it in a melon-shape six hours. PUDDINGS IN H.\STE. Shred suet, and put, with grated bread, a few currants, the yolks of four eggs and the whites of two, some grated lemon-peel, and ginger. Mix, and make into little balls about the size and shape of an egg, with a little flour. Have ready a skillet of boiling water, and throw them in. Twenty minutes will boil them ; but they will rise to the top when done. Serve with pudding-sauce. MADEIR.4. PUDDING.—E. R. Have a tin cake-mould, of which the bottom will come out; butter it, and lay upon it a piece of paste the size of the mould; cover it with jireseiwe of apricots ; then lay another piece of paste, and cover this with red preserves, and so on in different layers, with paste be- tween, until the mould is filled. Boil; and serve with brandy sauce. This is a rich pudding, for which the island of Madeira is very famous. Great care will be necessary in taking it out of the mould; and it will take a long time to boil it properly. AI.MOND PUDDING.—E. R. Take two ounces and a half of white bread-crumbs, and steep them in a pint of cream; then pound half a pint of blanched almonds to a paste with some water. Beat the yolks of six eggs, and the whites of three ; mix all together, and add three ounces of sugar, and an ounce of beaten butter; put all over the fire; stir it un- til it thickens, and then bake it in a puff-paste.

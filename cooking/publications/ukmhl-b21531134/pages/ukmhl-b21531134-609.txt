Chap. XXIV.] 52y DIRECTIONS TO SERVANTS. turn it the right side upwards, and scour it with ox-gall and soap and water very clean, and dry it with linen cloths. Then lay it on grass, or hang it up to dry. TO GIVE TO BOARDS A BEAUTIFUL APPEARANCE. After washing them very nicely clean with soda and warm water and a brush, wash them with a very large sponge and clean water. Both times observe to leave no spot untouched; and clean straight up and down, not crossing from board to board; then dry with clean cloths, rubbed hard up and down in the same way. The floors should not be often wetted, but very tho- roughly when done ; and once a-week dry-rubbed with hot sand and a heavy brush, the right way of the boards. The sides of stairs or passages on which are carpets or floor-cloth should be Wcished with sponge instead of linen or flannel, and the edges will not be soiled. Dif- ferent sponges should be kept for the above two uses; and those and the brushes should be well washed when done with, and kept in dry places. TO EXTRACT OIL FROM BOARDS OR STONE. Make a strong ley of pearl-ashes and soft water, and add as much unslaked lime as it will take up; stir it together, and then let it settle a few minutes; bottle it, and stop close; have ready some water to lower it as used, and scour the part with it. If the liquor should lie long on the boards, it will draw out the colour of them: therefore do it with care and expedition. TO CLEAN STONE STAIRS AND HALLS. Boil a pound of pipe-makerâ€™s clay with a quart of water, a quart of small beer, and put in a bit of stone- blue. Wash with this mixture, and, when dry, rub the stones with flannel and a brush. 2 M

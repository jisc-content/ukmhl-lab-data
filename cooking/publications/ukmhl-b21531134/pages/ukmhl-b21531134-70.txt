liv directions for CABVING. by passing the knife under it towards ?he neck. Cut the other parts as in a fowl. The breast, wings, and merrythought are the most esteemed; but the leg has a high flavour. Partridges.—The partridge is here represented as just taken from the spit; but Jjefore it is served up the skewers must be withdrawn. It is cut up in the same manner as a fowl. The wings must be taken off in the line a, 6, and the merrythought in the line c, d. The prime parts of a partridge are the wings, breast, and merrythought; but the bird being small, the two latter are not often divided. The wing is considered as the best, and the tip of it is reckoned the most delicate morsel of the whole. Pigeons.—Cut them in half, either from top to bot- tom or across. The lower part is generally thought the best; but the fairest way is to cut from the neck to a, figure 7, rather than from c to b, by a, which is the most fashionable. The figure represents the back of the pigeon ; and the direction of the knife is in the line c, 6, by a, if done the last way.

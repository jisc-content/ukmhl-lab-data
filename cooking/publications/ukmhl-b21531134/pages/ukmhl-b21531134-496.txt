416 DOMKSTIC COOKHRY. [Cmap. X\. WEST INDIAN BLANC MANGE.â€”E. R. Mix with a little cold milk three tahle-spoonsful of arrow-root and one of flour; boil a quart of milk fla- voured with bitter almonds, lemon-peel, and sugar ; strain it through a sieve upon the arrow-root, stir it well together over the fire; let it boil until quite thick, then put it into a mould; when cold, ganiish it with sweetmeats. This may be kept moderately warm, and eaten as a pudding, with a sauce made of the yolk of an egg well beaten, a glass of sherry, a spoonful of brandy, and a little sugar, warmed and put round, and not over the pudding. TO FILL PRESERVED ORANGES; A CORNER DISH. For five take a pound of Naples biscuits, some blanched almonds, the yolks of four eggs beaten, sugar to your taste, four ounces of butter warmed; grate the biscuits and mix with the above and some orange-flower water. Fill preserved oranges, and bake in a very slow oven. If you like them frosted, sift sugar over them as soon as filled; otherwise wipe them. Custard to fill will do as well; if so, you need not bake the oranges, but put it in when become cold. BUTTERED ORANGE-JUICE, A COLD DISH. Mix the juice of seven Seville oranges with four spoonsful of rose-water, and add the whole to the yolks of eight and whites of four eggs well beaten; then strain the liquor to half a pound of sugar pounded, stir it over a gentle fire, and when it begins to thicken put about the size of a small walnut of butter; keep it over the fire a few minutes longer; then pour it into a flat dish, and serve it to eat cold. If you have no silver saucepan, do it in a china basin in a saucepan of boiling water, the top of which will just receive the basin.

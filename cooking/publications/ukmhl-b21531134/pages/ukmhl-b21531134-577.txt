BROTHS. CuAP. XXIV.] 497 close with a dish or coarse crust; bake till the beef is done enough for eating, with only as much water as will cover it. When cold, cover it close in a cool place. When to be used, give what flavour may be approved. A QUICK-MADE BROTH. Take a bone or two of a neck or loin of mutton, take off the fat and skin, set it on the fire in a small tin sauce- pan that has a cover, with three-quarters of a pint of water, the meat being first beaten and cut in thin bits; put a bit of thyme and parsley, and, if approved, a slice of onion. Let it boil very quick ; skim it nicely; take off the cover, if likely to be too weak; else cover it. Half an hour is sufficient for the whole process. A VERY SUPPORTING BROTH AGAINST ANY KIND OF WEAKNESS. Boil two pounds of loin of mutton, with a very large handful of chervil in two quarts of water to one. Take off part of the fat. Any other herbs or roots may be added. Take half a pint three or four times a day. A VERY NOURISHING VEAL BROTH. Put the knuckle of a leg or shoulder of veal, with very little meat to it, an old fowl, and four shank-bones of mutton extremely well soaked and bruised, three blades of mace, ten peppercorns, an onion, and a large bit of bread, and three quarts of water, into a stewpot that covers close, and simmer in the slowest manner after it has boiled up and been skimmed; or bake it; strain, and take off the fat. Salt as wanted. It will require four hours. BEEF TEA TO DRINK COLD.â€”E. R. Take a pound of lean beef, clear it from every particle of skin fat, or sinew, rasp or divide it into very small pieces ; then put it into a jar, and pour a quart of boiling water upon it; plunge the jar into a kettle of boiling water, let it stand by the side of the fire, but not near 2 K

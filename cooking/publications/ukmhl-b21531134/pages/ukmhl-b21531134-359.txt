Boil the maccaroni in milk, or a weak veal-broth, until it is soft, adding salt for seasoning. When tender, drain it, and put it on a dish, placing small bits of but- ter and grated cheese upon every layer. Put a larger quantity of grated cheese and butter on the top, and place the dish in a Dutch oven for a quarter of an hour, but do not allow the cheese to become hard. M.VCCARONI WITH BREAD-CRUMBS.—E. R. Wash the maccaroni, then simmer it in half milk and half broth, with a little pounded mace and salt. When quite tender, take it out of the liquor, and lay it on a dish; grate a quarter of a pound of cheese over the top, and cover the whole with grated bread-crumbs. Then warm butter without oiling, and pour it from a boat through a small earthen colander all over the crumbs. Then put the dish in a Dutch oven, to toast the cheese and brown the bread, which should be of a pale colour, but in separate crumbs, and very light. It will take two ounces of butter at least, and, if intended for Italians, a larger quantity. FONDUE.—E. R. Grate four ounces of Parmesan cheese, and beat in a j- mortar to a paste ; add a piece of butter, and beat it < well; stir in the yolks of six eggs and a quarter of a pint .tof cream; mix the whole well together, and then add slowly the whites of the eggs, separately beaten, and in a froth. Pour the mixture into a round deep dish, made for the purpose, either of block-tin or silver. Fill it '6nly three parts full, to admit of its rising, and keep stirring it for a few minutes after it is put into the oven. FONDUE A LA PARISIENNE.c-E. R. .

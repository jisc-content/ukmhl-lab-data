[Chap. XXIV. DOMESTIC COOKERY. 510 before used. This is of particular use in weak bowels. It should be of a fine brown colour before drinking it. WHEY.-E. R. Put a pint of milk, milk-warm, into a stewpan or ether vessel before the fire, add to it half a table-spoon- ful of rennet. When the curd forms, cut it into squares to allow the whey to escape. Then put it on a sieve carefully, for it must not be burned. LEMON WATER, A DELIGHTFUL DRINK. Put two slices of lemon thinly pared into a tea-pot, a little bit of the peel, and a bit of sugar, or a large spoon of capillaire; pour in a pint of boiling water, and stop it close two hours. APPLE WATER. Cut two large apples in slices, and pour a quart of boiling water on them ; or on roasted apples ; strain in two or three hours, and sweeten lightly. WHITE-WINE WHEY. Put half a pint of new milk on the fire; the moment it boils up, pour in as much sound raisin wine as will completely turn it, and it looks clear; let it boil up, then set the saucepan aside till the curd subsides, and do not stir it. Pour the whey off, and add to it half a pint of boiling water and a bit of white sugar. Thus you will have a whey perfectly cleared of milky par- ticles, and as weak as you choose to make it. VINEGAR AND LEMON WHEYS. Pour into boiling milk as much vinegar or lemon- juice as will make a small quantity quite clear, dilate with hot water to an agreeable smart acid, and put a bit or two of sugar. This is less heating than if made of wine; and, if only to excite perspiration, answers as, well.

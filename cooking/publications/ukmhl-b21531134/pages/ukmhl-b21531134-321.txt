MEAT. 241 Chap. XII.] breast of a fowl, or cold veal, are the principal ingre- dients* It may be served in a tureen as soup, or in an orna- mented crust previously baked. If to be white, beat as many yolks of eggs as the quantity may require, and simmer in the ragout two minutes: it must not boil. Sometimes one or two whole pigeons, nicely prepared, form a part of this much-admired dish, which in one way or other is rarely omitted on well-covered tables. • CALVES’-EARS STUFFED. The hair being scalded off the ears, after they have been cut quite close to the head, scald and clean them as well as possible; boil them quite tender, and blanch them in cold water. Observe that the gristle next the head be cut so smooth as to allow the ears to stand upright. They may be boiled in white gravy instead of water, which will make them richer. When become cold, fill up the cavity with a fine stuffing, either of calf’s-liver, fat bacon, grated ham, bread soaked in cream or gravy, herbs, an unbeaten egg, a little salt, and a small piece of mace; or substitute cold chicken for the liver. Rub egg over the ears and stuffing, and fry of a beautiful light brown. Serve in brown or white gravy. If the calf be large, one ear will be sufficient for a corner dish. ANOTHER WAY. When prepared as above, boil them quite tender in gravy, and serve them in chervil-sauce; or else boil chervil to a mash, put to it melted butter, pass it through a sieve, and add to it white sauce, or use the latter solely ; in which case put a little mushroom pow- der into it: the same forcemeat may be used, or the ears may be served without. They likewise eat well (served in white or brown gravy) cut in slices: in the latter case fry them before stewed in gravy. R

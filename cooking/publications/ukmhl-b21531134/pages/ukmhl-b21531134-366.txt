[Ch.\p. XIV. DOMESTIC COOKERY, 286 SAL.A.D.—E, R Purslain, a herb now little cultivated in England, is an excellent ingredient in summer salad, which should consist of young Cos lettuces, mustard and cress, very young radishes, any kind of fine herb in season, and chives placed round the edge of the dish, and not cut into it: in winter endive, cabbage lettuce, beet- root, celery, and onions. The excellence of a salad consists in the vegetables being young and fresh ; they should he prepared only a short time before they are wanted, the salad mixture being either poured into the bottom of the bowl, or sent up in a sauce-tureen, and not stirred up with the vegetables until they are served. Any cold boiled vegetables make excellent salad in winter. Beet-root, celery, Spanish onions, carrots, and broccoli, should be cut small, and served with the same mixture as that employed for vegetables in their raw state. In summer, cold peas, French beans, cauli- flowers, asparagus-tops, or 'a portion of anything in season may be employed, and they are particularly nice with cream instead of oil. ut boiled potatoes in thin slices, and chop very small pickled cucumbers, onions, and chillies, an an-- chovy or two, and some capers or nasturtiums; serve’ them with a salad mixture. Chop three anchovies, a shalot, and some parsley? small, put them into a bowl with two table-spoonsful off vinegar, one of oil, a little mustard, and salt.

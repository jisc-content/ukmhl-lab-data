When sufficiently done, take it up, strain the gravy that will be found in the pan, and which, when cold, will be a fine jelly; thicken it with a little flour, add the liquor of the oys- ters intended for sauce, also stewed, and warm the oys- ters up in it. A fowl may be boiled in the same man- ner ; and, if there should be no steam apparatus, a small one can be put in a jar and immersed in a kettle of water. Should a fowl or turkey prove of a bad colour, smother it in sauce, celery-sauce, or any white sauce. Pepper fowls and turkeys in the inside, and when roasted baste them well with butter. Obs. A small hen-bird boils better than the larger sort, and may be stuffed in a variety of ways, with herbs like veal stuffing, or sausage-meat, or chestnuts and bacon, and it may be served up with celery-sauce, plain white sauce, or both. Boiled fowls should be very young and white-legged to cook well. They should come to table very plump, and as delicate as possible.

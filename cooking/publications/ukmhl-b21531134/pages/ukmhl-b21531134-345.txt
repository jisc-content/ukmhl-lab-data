Pick the spinach well from the stalks, and wash it very clean in different waters; boil it quickly in a large quantity of water and salt; stir, and skim it. When it breaks easily it is enough done. Strain it, and put it immediately into fresh water for a quarter of an hour, then strain it, pressing it gently. Chop it fine, and put it into a stewpan with just enough butter to moisten it, set it on a quick fire, stir it with a wooden spoon, and, when dry, moisten it with some highly-seasoned gravy soup,,until it is of the consistence of pea soup ; grate a little nutmeg on it, and serve it up hot. Rogers, in his ‘ Vegetable Cultivator,’ states that a handful of sorrel boiled with the New Zealand spinach (I'etragenid) im- proves the flavour. POIS X L.\ FRANCAISE.—E. R. i Stew old peas with sliced onion and lettuce in a little butter and water, season it well; thicken with a cupful of good gravy, a piece of butter rolled in flour, adding a spoonful of soy, or other strong sauce. STEWED PEAS.—E. R. Put a quart of fresh peas into a stewpan, cut four cabbage lettuces, and add them, with three ounces of butter and a small fagot of parsley; fill up the stewpan with spring water, mix the whole well together; then pour off the water, add six young button onions, two lumps of sugar, and a very little salt; place the stew- pan on a very gentle fire, and shake it occasionally. They will take about a quarter of an hour to stew pro- perly : when ready, finish them with a little butter, mixed with a tea-spoonful of flour, and a table-spoonful of cream.

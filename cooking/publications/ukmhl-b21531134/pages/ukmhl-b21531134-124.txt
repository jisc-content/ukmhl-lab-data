Sprats are done in the same way, but being too small to roll, merely cut off the head and take out the bone, after they have been very nicely cleaned. EEL.-E. R. Clean the eel well, and cut it into pieces, leaving it in water; put them into a stewpan with butter, set them for a minute on the fire; then dust flour; add some gravy, and stir it with a wooden spoon until it boils; add parsley, shalot, half a bay leaf, a clove, salt, pepper, and small onions; simmer all together, and reduce.

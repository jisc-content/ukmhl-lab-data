When the syrup grows thin take out the cucumbers and enrich it with mor^ugar. , A FINE PRESERVE OF CUCUMBERS.—E. R. Cut the cucumbers in halves, and scoop out the in- side. Put them into a stone jar with spring water, cover it close; let it stand near the fire, so as not to be quite warm, for ten days or a fortnight; then take them out and throw them into spring water; they will look quite yellow, and be offensive, but that must be disre ■ garded.

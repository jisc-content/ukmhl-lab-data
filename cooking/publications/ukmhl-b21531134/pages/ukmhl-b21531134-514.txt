434 [Chap. XXI. DOMESTIC COOKERY. CHAPTER XXL OBSERVATIONS ON MAKING AND BAKING CAKES. It is indispensably necessary in making cakes that all the ingredients should be heated before they are mixed together; for this purpose every thing should be pre- pared for an hour or two previously to their being wanted, and placed near the fire, or upon a stove : the flour thoroughly dried and warmed; the currants, sugar, caraway-seed, and any thing else required, heated in the same way. Butter and eggs should be beaten in basins fitted into kettles or pans of boiling water, which will give them the requisite degree of temperature. With- out these precautions, cakes will be heavy ; and the best materials, and the greatest pains, will fail to produce the desired results. They are especially necessary in sponge-cakes. Currants should be very nicely washed, dried in a cloth, and then set before the fire. If damp, they will make cakes or puddings heavy. Before they are added, a dust of dry flour should be thrown among them, and a shake given to them, which causes the thing that they are put to to be lighter. Eggs should be very long beaten, whites and yolks apart, and always strained. Sugar should be rubbed to a powder on a clean board, and sifted through a very fine hair or lawn sieve. Lemon-peel should be pared very thin, and with a little sugar beaten in a marble mortar, to a paste; and then mixed with a little wine, or cream, so as to divide easily among the other ingredients. After all the articles are put into the pan, they should be thoroughly and long beaten, as the lightness of the cake depends much on their being well incorporated. Whether black or white plum-cakes, they require less butter and eggs for having yest, and eat equally light and rich. If the leaven be only of flour, milk and water, and yest, it becomes more tough, and is less easily

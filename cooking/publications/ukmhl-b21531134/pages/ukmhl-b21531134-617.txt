537 Chap. XXIV.] MISCKLL.VNEOUS RECEIPTS. THE BEST METHOD OF CLEANING KNIVES. Have the board properly prepared with leather, and clean the knives with equal quantities of rotten-stone and iron filings. EXCELLENT METHOD OF CLEANING GOLD. Make a paste of whitening with sal volatile, cover the gold ornaments with it, and, when dry, brush it off. This will remove all the stains, and restore the gold to its original colour. TO CLEAR COFFEE. Scrape and clean the white skins of soles, then steep them in cold water for an hour or two ; then take them out, and stretch them upon a clean hoard to dry; cut them into very narrow strips, about two inches long. This answers the same purpose as isinglass, and is much more economical. The black skin will clear coffee; but it makes it taste fishy. The cook who furnished this receipt always removes both the skins of soles, dries the soles well, and eggs and ciurabs them before they are put into the pan.

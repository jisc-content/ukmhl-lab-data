Chap. IV.] MADE DISHES. Ill done, boil the gravy down to a glaze, cover the veal with it, and serve it upon a bed of sorrel. A frican- deau may also be larded, and half-stewed, then roasted; wash, pick, and steam the sorrel, press it, and put it under the veal for half an hour before serving. Gre- nadines of veal are cooked in the same way, only made of smaller pieces, four for a dish. FRICANDELS.—E. R.

Divide the ribs from the brisket of a breast of veal, and take out the long bones, beat the veal for four minutes with the flat part of a hand-chopper, in order that it may roll easily. Spread it on the table, and. brush it over thickly with the yolk of egg, and then sprinkle it with chopped herbs; and then make two omelettes, one of the yolk, and one of the white of egg, well seasoned, and cut them in strip, lay them upon the

Strew this over the hare, after having carefully taken it out of the pan clear of fat; slice half a pound of fat bacon very thin, put it into a jug or jar, a layer of hare and one of bacon upon it, until the whole is put in, then add rather le5S.tlW half a pint of ale; cover the jug yerjj closely, so as perfectly to keep in the steam; put it into a kettle of cold water, lay a tile on tlie top of the jar, and let it boil three hours if the hare be young, or four or five if an old one.

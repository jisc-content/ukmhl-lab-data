Chap. III.] ME.\T. 77 What is called measly pork is very unwholesome, and may be known by the fat being full of kernels, which in good poi'k is never the case. Pork fed at still-houses does not answer for curing in any way, the fat being spongy. Dairy-pork is the best. Bacon.—If the rind be thin, the fat firm, and of a red tinge, the lean tender, of a good colour, and adhering to the bone, you may conclude it good and not old.

OBSERVATIONS ON PURCHASING, KEEPING, AND DRESSING MEAT. The flesh of cattle killed when not perfectly clear of ^ food soon spoils. They should fast twenty-four hours in winter, and double that time in summer, before they are killed. In every sort of provisions, the best of the kind goes furthest, cuts out to greatest advantage, and affords most nourishment. Round of beef, fillet of veal, and leg of mutton, are joints that bear a higher price; but as they have more solid meat, they deserve the preference.

In loins of meat, the long pipe that runs by the bone should be taken out, as it is apt to taint; as also the kernels of beef. Rumps and edgebones of beef are often bruised by the blows the drovers give the beasts, and the

[Chap. XVI. DOMESTIC COOKERY. 330 VERY FINE FORCEMEAT BALI.S, FOR FISH SOUPS, OR FISH, STEWED ON MAIGRE DAYS. Beat the flesh and soft parts of a middling lobster, half an apchovy, a large piece of boiled celery, the yolk of a hard egg, a little cayenne, mace, salt, and white pepper, with two table-spoonsful of bread-crumbs, one ditto of oyster-liquor, two ounces of butter warmed, and two eggs long beaten: make into balls, and fry of a fine brown in butter. FISH FORCEMEAT.—E. R. Chop, and afterwards pound in a mortar, any kind of fish, adding an anchovy or two, or a tea-spoonful of the essence of anchovies; but do not allow the taste to pre- vail ; and the yolk of a hard-boiled egg : if for maigre, pound butter with it; but otherwise, the fat of bacon pounded separately, and then mixed; add a third por- tion of bread, prepared by soaking and pounding pro viously, and mix tbe whole up with raw eggs. DRESSING FOR CUTLETS, &c.—E. R. Grate some stale bread; add to it an equal portion of chopped sweet herbs, parsley being the principal ingrcdiertt; season it, and mix it on a plate with clari- fied butter: have another plate of dry bread-crumbs. Brush the cutlets with yolk of egg, and put the mixture on thickly with a knife; then roll them in the bread- crumbs. Upon some occasions this process should be twice performed, in order that the coating should be sufficiently thick. LITTLE EGGS FOR TURTLE.—E. R.. Beat three hard yolks of eggs in a mortar, and make into a paste with the yolk of a raw one; roll it into small balls, and throw them into boiling water for two minutes to harden.

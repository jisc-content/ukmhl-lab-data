446 [Chap. XXI. DOMESTIC COOKERY. PORTUGAL CAKES. Mix a pound of fine dried flour with the same of sifted loaf-sugar; rub into it a pound of fresh butter till it resembles crumbled bread. Then add two spoons- ful of rose-water, two of white wine, and ten eggs; whisk it well, and add eight ounces of currants. Butter small tin pans and half fill. SHREWSBURY CAKES. Sift one pound of sugar, some pounded cinnamon, and a nutmeg grated, into three pounds of flour, the finest sort; add a little rose-water to three eggs, well beaten, and mix these with the flour, &c.: then pour into it as much buttei: melted as will make it a good thickness to roll out. Mould it well, and roll thin, and cut it into such shapes as you like. BUTTER CAKES.—E. R. To half a pound of butter add the same quantity of brown sugar, three eggs, the rind of two lemons, a quarter of an ounce of pounded cinnamon, and half the quantity of powdered ginger. Work into it as much flour as will make it a paste; cut it into shapes, and strew over the top some pounded almonds, and candied orange-peel. Bake in a slow oven. A LIGHT SEED-CAKE.—E. R. Take the yolks of six eggs, and the whites of three, heat them well for half an hour; then put in srx ounces of powdered loaf-sugar, mix it well with the eggs, and gradually seven ounces of flour, and a few caraway- seeds ; stir the whole well together, and put it into a pan or dish for baking. If the oven is hot, half an hour will bake it. The moment it is taken out of the oven, turn it out of the mould, and let it lie upside down until quite cold. Great care should be taken in the baking. A less rich cake may be made by omitting an ounce of the sugar, and adding one more of flour. c

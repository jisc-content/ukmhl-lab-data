27 SOUPS. Chap. I.] I for an hour, substituting for the lemon-juice a table- j spoonful of Harvey’s sauce, or a little lemon-pickle. I MULTAANEE SOUP, WITH PEA.S.—E. R. [ Steep a quart of peas in water, put them into a pan I with as much water as will cover them; when thoroughly boiled pulp them into good broth, then add any kind of meat or fowl, fried in butter, with onions and curry- powder, as before directed. English peas are a substitute for the dhal, with which in India multaanee soup is fre- quently thickened. CHLODNIK OR COLD SOUP; A POLISH DISH.—E. R. Take sorrel and leaves of beet-root, boil them well, and after having drained, chop them fine, and allow them to become cold. Then take cold boiled water and mix it with the vegetables, until it is of the consistence of gruel. Add to it a little of the green of onions cut into small pieces, some cream ad libitum, and some vinegar, if not sufficiently acid. Slice in cucumbers, the beet-root, and add hard-boiled eggs cut into small pieces. This soup must be put upon ice, or lumps of ice put into it, and served quite cold. I3ARSHCH.-E. R. Boil beet-root for some time in water in order to take away the bitter taste; then peel it and cut it into very small pieces. Meanwhile take some fat, with_ bones containing marrow; having boiled it some time, take the scum off. Add to it some bacon, about a table- spoonful of pearl-barley, one or two onions, and a stick of celery cut into pieces ; having boiled them a little, put in the beet-root. When the meat is sufficiently dressed and the beet-root quite tender, add two spoonsful of good vinegar, that the soup may have an agreeable acid flavour; boil it a little longer; when ready take sour cream quite thick, put it into a little of the soup, in order to dilute it, and then mix the whole well together.

At a dinner in which two of the dishes consist of rolled veal and pork-chops, the fat pared from si.v nicely-cut thin pork-chops will be sufficient to braise the veal. When fowls are boned, the bones should be added to the braise. When brought to table, the gravy of braised meat should be cooled by placing the vessel containing it in cold water, the fat removed, the gravy then strained, thickened, heated, and sent up with forcemeat-balls, egg-balls, fried paste, or all three, mushrooms, or any other vegetables, cut into orna- mental shapes; or the gravy may be boiled down to a glaze, and laid over the meat: sent to table on a pur^e of vegetables. ir.\SHED CALFS-HEAD.—E.

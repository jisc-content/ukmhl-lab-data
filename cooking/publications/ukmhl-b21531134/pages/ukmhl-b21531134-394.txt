[Chap. XVI. DOMESTIC COOKERY. 314 BROWNING IN A MINUTE.—E. R. Put two lumps of powdered sugar into a small sauce- pan, with a piece of butter the size of a walnut, melt them together; add a glass of ketchup, and stir it well. A very small quantity may be made in an iron spoon. MELTED BUTTER.—E. R. Mix very well with a spoon a small quantity of flour into a piece of butter; about a tea-spoonful will be re- quired for three ounces; the excellence of melted but- ter greatly depends upon the pains taken to blend it with the flour before it is put upon the fire. When well mixed, add two table-spoonsful of hot water, or the same quantity of milk, put it into a small saucepan, shaking it one way until it boils : it must boil a minute to take off the rawness. By attending to these direc- tions, and only using sufficient flour to prevent the but- ter from oiling, it will he rich and smooth. When thin melted butter is required to pour over puddings, roast veal, &c., make it the same way, adding a larger pro- portion of water. ONION SAUCE.—E. R. Peel the onions, and put them into cold water, when it boils pour the water off, and fill up the saucepan from a kettle of boiling water; do this three or four times to take out the strength of the onions; when they will pulp, beat them through a sieve, add white gravy, cream, or milk thickened with butter and flour; warm the whole together, and send it up. GARLIC SAUCE.—E. R. Peel the garlic and divide it into cloves, boil it for five minutes in water, then pour it off; add boiling water, boil it five minutes longer; repeat the process a third and fourth time, then strain the garlic, and send it to table in white sauce. If properly done it will taste like almonds.

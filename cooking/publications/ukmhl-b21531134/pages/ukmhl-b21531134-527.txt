Mix two pounds of flour, one pound of sugar, and one ounce of caraways, with four or five eggs, and a few spoonsful of water, to make a stiff paste: roll it thin, and cut it into any shape. Bake on tins lightly floured. While baking, boil a pound of sugar, in a pint of water, to a thin syrup: while both are hot, dip each cake into it, and put them on tins into the oven to dry for a short time; and when the oven is cooler still, return them there again, and let them stay four or five hours.

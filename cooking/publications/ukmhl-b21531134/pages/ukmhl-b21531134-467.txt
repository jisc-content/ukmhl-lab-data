I'UESCRVES. Chap. XIX.] •387 water, without the pulp; let them remain in the same a fortnight, adding no more., boil them therein till tender, strain it from them, and when they are tolerably dry throw them into any jar of candy you may have remaining from old sweetmeats; or, if you have none, boil a small quantity of syrup of common loaf-sugar and water, and put over them: in a week or ten days boil them gently in it till they look clear, and that they may be covered with it in the jar. You may cut each half of the fruit in two, and they will occupy small space. TO rilESERVE CITRONS. Throw them into water over-night; boil until so tender that you can run a straw through them. Cut them in half, remove the pulp, but do not touch the nnd ; lay them in a china bowl for two or three days covered with double-refined sugar (a pound to each citron of a moderate size). Boil the sugar, fruit, and two or three spoonsful of water together for a quarter of an hour. Two days after, pour the syrup off, and boil it with one pound of sugar; skim, and pour it boiling- hot upon the citrons. If the syrup be not rich enough, the boiling must be repeated. Soak twelve races of { white ginger in water three days, scrape them well, and boil them in a little thin syrup. When the preserving syrup is boiled the last time, add the ginger to the fruit. _ When cold, cover with paper and bladder. ® QUINCE MARMALADE.—E. R. Pare and quarter the fruit, put it in layers in a stone jar with sugar sprinkled between each; add a tea-cup- ful of water, and bake it in a cool oven. Have a quan- tity of sugar equal in weight to the fruit; allow a quart of water to every four pounds ; boil the sugar and water together, skimming it well. When the quinces are soft add them, with a quart of the juice which will be found in the jar; boil them in the syrup, beating it with a spoon until the marmalade is quite smooth. 2 c 2

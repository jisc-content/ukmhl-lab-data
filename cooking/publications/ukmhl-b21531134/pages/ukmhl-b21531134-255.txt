PIES. 175 Chap. X.] the following process;â€”Cut a pound of beef-suet, remove all the skin and chop it very fine; have ready a kettle of boiling water, and mix the water and suet gradually together, beating it until it is like lard. In making savoury pies, the cook should always take care to have a good stock that will jelly, made from the bones and trimmings, to fill up the pie when it comes from the oven, and also that when cold there may be enough jelly. For want of this precaution pies become dry before they can be eaten. It is essential to lay the meat of a pie lightly in the dish, as otherwise there is no room for jelly; and the whole will be too hard and solid. OBSERVATIONS ON PASTRY. An adept in pastry never leaves any part of it ad- hering to the board or dish used in making. The best thing to make it upon is a slab of marble or slate; which substances cause less waste, being cold and smooth. 'I'he coolest part of the house, and of the day, should be chosen for the process: the hands should be pre- viously washed in very hot water; and the less they touch the paste the better and lighter it will prove: nor should it be rolled much. In whatever way paste be made, wetting it much will render it tough. Salt butter of the best quality makes a fine flaky crust: for sweet things, wash it. REMARKS ON USING PRESERVED FRUITS IN PASTRY. Preserved fruits are usually too dry when put into paste that requires long baking ; those that have been done with their full proportion of sugar require no baking: the crust for them should be baked in a tin shape, and the fruit afterwards added, and a cover may be baked on croquant tins. For fresh fruits short crust is very suitable. Tarts may sometimes be iced.

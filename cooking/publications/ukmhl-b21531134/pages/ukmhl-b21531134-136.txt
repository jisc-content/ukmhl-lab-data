DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. U GG OYSTERS. TO FEED OYSTERS. Put them into water, and wash them with a birch besom till quite clean ; then lay them bottom down- wards into a pan, sprinkle with flour or oatmeal and salt, and cover with water. Do the same every day, and they will soon fatten. The water should be pretty salt. N.B. A peck of the best native oysters may be pur- chased out of the boats at Billingsgate for nine shillings; there are about 436 in a peck, about four for a penny. The common oysters are from two shillings to half a crown the peck. STEWED OYSTERS WITH WINE.—E. R. Wash the oysters in their liquor, and then strain it, add a glass of wine, some whole pepper, a little salt, a piece of butter rolled in flour, and a spoonful of lemon- juice ; boil the whole, stirring it until it is smooth, then put in the oysters, and warm or plump them up without boiling. STEWED OYSTERS PL.YIN.—E. R. Beard the oysters, wash them in their own liquor, then strain it, thicken it with thin melted butter, or white sauce made of cream; season it with a blade of mace and a few whole peppercorns tied in a muslin bag. Simmer the oysters very gently, and serve up with sippets of bread : they will require only a few minutes, and if allowed to boil will become hard. SCALLOPED OYSTERS.—E. R. Beard the oysters, and wash them in their liquor, then strain the liquor and pour it over a quantity of bread-crumbs. Lay the crumbs into scallops of china or tin, and put the oysters in layers, with bread-crumbs, pepper, and butter between, cover the top with bread- crumbs and butter, and bake them in an oven or before the fire.

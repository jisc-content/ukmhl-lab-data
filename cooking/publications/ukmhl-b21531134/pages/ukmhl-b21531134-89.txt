19 Chap. 1.] SOUPS. I will require the addition of a little ketchup, Harvey’s I sauce, and a glass of wine, and should be thickened I* with butter or cream. Serve up with the tails cut in j pieces. A much more delicate and elegant soup may I be made with calves’-tails. A Sl’RING SOUP.—E. R. Stew some cabbage lettuces and spinach in broth, I with the crumb of a French roll. When sufficiently I tender, pulp them through a sieve, add them to two I quarts of stock; and before sent up to table, add the tops of asparagus, boiled long enough in the soup to become tender.

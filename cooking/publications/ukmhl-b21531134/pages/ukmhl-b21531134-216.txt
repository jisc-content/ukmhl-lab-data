Then put it into a stewpan with the knuckle-bone broken, the trimmings, a few slices of fat bacon or two ounces of butter, an onion stuck with cloves, and a bundle of sweet herbs. Shake the stewpan over the fire until there is gravy enough from the meat and the trimmings to stew the mutton ; and take care to turn it in the braise. When very tender, take it up, remove the fat from the gravy, strain it, and boil it quickly until it is reduced to a glaze. Cover the mutton with this jelly, and serve it up with a puree of vegetables beneath. The best is that of garlic. Boil a sufficient quantity for five mi- nutes, then strain off the water, and pour on fresh from a kettle boiling ; when the garlic has boiled five minutes more, pour this away, adding fresh a third and fourth time, and boiling the garlic five minutes between each change of water. Taste the garlic, and ’if it has not lost all its disagreeable flavour, boil it in fresh water until it is rich and delicate. A small shoulder of mut- ton may be boned and stuffed, and dressed the same way. STEWED SHOULDER OF MUTTON.—E. R. Cut off the knuckle, take out the blade-bone, and trim the shoulder into a handsome form; break the bone and stew it for some time in water with the knuckle and trimmings; stuff the shoulder with good force- meat, skewer it into shape, put a little butter into a stewpan, melt it, and brown the mutton by turning it in the frying butter ; then dredge it with flour, put some of the broth made with the bones into the stewpan, with an onion, and let it stew until the meat is quite tender ; serve it up with pickles warmed in the sauce.

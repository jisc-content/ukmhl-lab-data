[Chap. I. 28 DOMESTIC COOKERY. L.\MB SOUP.—E. R. Cut a loin of lamb into steaks, put it into a stewpan with a basin of gravy, or a piece of lean beef; add a quantity of carrots, turnips, and onions cut small, a bunch of sweet herbs, pepper, and salt.

When the meat has boiled once, skim it well, then add salt, a carrot, two large leeks, one large turnip, a small bit of celery, and a burnt onion; the soup must now only be allowed to simmer gently till five o’clock. Skim the soup well, and put in a little vermicelli, or thin slices of bread. It will be sufficient for eight persons. ITALIAN SOUP.—E. R.

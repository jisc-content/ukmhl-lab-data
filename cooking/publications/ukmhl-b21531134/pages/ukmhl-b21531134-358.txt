DOMESTIC COOKERV. [Chap. XIV. 278 though not SO well. There are hundreds of receipts for omelettes, but the principle is the same. OMELETTE WITH HERBS.—E. R. Beat up two eggs with a little water or milk, salt, pepper, chives, and parsley, minced very small. Put a piece of butter half the size of an egg into the frying- pan, let it boil, but not brown ; pour in the omelette and allow it to set a little; then raise it round the edge with a fork, to allow more of the mixture to become cooked. When it is done, a good deal of the ome- lette remaining liquid, turn it over to double it: this will absorb much of the liquid, but keep it soft. Put the dish on the frying-pan and turn it over. Let the fire be clear, but not too hot. TALLIANNI.—E. R. Take three eggs, a little salt, and as much flour as will make a stiff paste; then break it into two pieces, and roll it out as thin as possible. Lay a clean cloth on the table, and with the hand spread out the paste as thin .as a leaf. Let it remain on the cloth for two hours, then fold up the sheets and cut it into narrow strips. Have ready a saucepan of boiling water, put a little salt into it, then put in the tallianni, and let it boil for ten minutes, stirring the water about as it boils with a fork. .Strain the water through a colander, and when the talli- anni is drained dry, put it into a dish with a sauce made of a little brown gravy and a lump of butter. MACCARONI —E. R. A quarter of a pound of maccaroni and the same of grated Parmesan. Boil the maccaroni in water with, some salt; when tender take it out and put it into a stewpan with a quarter of a pound of butter, and a part of the cheese, a little white pepper, and a spoonful o> two of milk. Toss it until the cheese is well mixed with the other things, and then put it into a di$h with the remainder, the larger portion of the grated cheese

Take twelve lemons, pared so thin that none of the white can be seen, cut them across at each end, and work in as much salt as they will contain, rubbing them very well within and without. J^et them remain for three or four days covered with salt. Dry the lemons in a slow oven until they have no moisture in them ; and dry also twelve cloves of garlic, and a large hand- ful of scraped horse-radish, but not quite so much as the lemons, which must be as hard as a board, but not in the least burned; then take a gallon of vinegar, half an ounce of mace, the same quantity of cloves and of nutmeg roughly broken, and half an ounce of cayenne, pepper: boil them all together, and when cold stir in a quarter of a pound of flour of mustard, pour it upon the lemons, garlic, and horse-radish, and shake them every day for a fortnight.

383 Chap. XIX.] PRESERVES. TO DRY APRICOTS WHOLE.—E. R. Gather the apricots when not too ripe, but sufficiently so to leave the stone. Thrust out the stones with a skewer; pare the apricots, and sift sugar over each as tliey are done to keep their colour. Make syrup to cover them of a quarter of a pint of water to a pound of sugar. Boil the syrup, skim it, and let it stand until nearly cold; then put in the apricots, and heat them gradually over a slow fire, allowing them to scald, but not to boil, and taking care to turn them on every side. Place them on one side in the syrup until the next day; then scald them again very slowly for half an hour; allow them just to boil up, and lay them aside till the next day. Make a fresh syrup, by dipping lumps of sugar in the former one, and allowing it slowly to dis- solve ; then boil and skim it clear. Put in the apricots; let them boil gently until they are clear. Allow them to lie in the syrup all night; then drain them from the syrup, put them upon an earthen dish, cover them with a hair-sieve, and set them in a very cool oven to dry, turning them frequently. TO DRY APRICOTS IN HALVES.-E. R. Take them before they are full ripe, scald them in a jar plunged into boiling water, then pare and halve them. Put them into a syrup of half their weight of sugar, let them scald awhile, and then boil until they are clear. Let them stand for two days in the syrup, and then put them into a thin candy, and scald, but not boil, them in it. Keep them two days longer in the candy, heating them each day, and then lay them on glasses to dry. APRICOT MARMALADE.—E. R. Gather the fruit before it is too ripe, stone and blanch the kernels. To every pound of fruit take three- quarters of a pound of fine loaf-sugar; break the sugar into lumps, dip the lumps in water, allow them to dis- solve, put it over a clear fire, and let it boil to a candy;

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 176 IChap. X. Heating the oven properly is very material in baking. Light paste requires it to be moderately hot; if too quick, it will be burned and not rise well; if too slow, it will be soddened, not rise, and want colour. Raised pies must be put into a quick oven, or the crust will fall. The cook should accurately know the proper heat for each article, as opening the door, to observe their progress, lets in the air, and often spoils them. Cakes or tarts which are returned into the oven, after icing, require heat enough to harden only. RAISED CRDST FOR MEAT PIES, OR FOWLS, &c. Boil water with a little fine lard, and an equal quan- tity of fresh dripping, or of butter, but not much of either. While hot, mix this with as much flour as you will want, making the paste as stiff as you can to be smooth, which you will make it by good kneading and beating it with the rolling-pin. When quite smooth, put a lump into a cloth, or under a pan, to soak till near cold. Those who have not a good hand at raising crust may do thus : Roll the paste of a proper thickness, and cut out the top and bottom of the pie, then a long piece for the^ides. Cement the bottom to the sides with egg, bringing the former rather further out, and pinch- ing both together : put egg between the edges of the paste to make it adhere at the sides. Fill your pie and put on the cover, and pinch it and the side crust together. The same mode of uniting the paste is to be observed if the sides are pressed into a tin form, in which the paste must be baked, after it shall be filled and covered : but in the latter case, the tin should be buttered, and carefully taken off when done enough; and as the form usually makes the sides of a lighter colour than is proper, the paste should be put into the oven again for a quarter of an hour. With a feather put egg over at first.

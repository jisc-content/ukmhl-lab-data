[Chap. XII. DOMESTIC COOKERY. 248 FOULET AUX TRUFFES—FOWL WITH TRUFFLES. Bone and skin a fine young fowl; take the odd bits of it, four ounces of green truffles, a small carrot, (both in thin slices,) with mace, pepper, and salt, and stuff the inside of it; tie it lightly, and lay it on slices of fat bacon; and lay over it a whole lemon sliced, after cutting off the rind. Put into a casserole a bay- leaf, two cloves, a small carrot, an onion, and as much water as will cover the fowl. Simmer as slowly as possible, with embers over the pan, two hours, by which time the liquor will be much wasted; strain and add to it half a pint of very strong gravy, and two ounces of sliced truffles; continue to stew gently three-quarters of an hour, and then serve all together. To some tastes, mushrooms, substituted for truffles, might be more agreeable, with the addition of a little butter. SALADE DE PERDREAUX—PARTRIDGES IN SALAD. Bone two partridges, and put into them a few sliced truffles. Put them into a small casserole, with slices of lean ham under and over, some slices of lemon, and a small quantity of veal gravy, with which occasionally wet them. Serve them next day with clear jelly of veal, properly seasoned; and put round them, alternately, hard eggs split, but left in the whites, lettuces, cut short and in quarters, and nasturtium flowers. PUPTON OF PIGEONS Lay a forcemeat, made very savoury, in a small dish like a paste lining ; then put in layers very thin slices of fat bacon, squab pigeons, sliced sweetbreads blanched, asparagus-tops, mushrooms, cocks’-combs, a palate or two boiled quite tender and cut in slices, and the yolks of four eggs boiled hard. Lay more forcemeat over the dish as a pie-crust; bake it, and turn it out to serve with rich gravy in the dish.

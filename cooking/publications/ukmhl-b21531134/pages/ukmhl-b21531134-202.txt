DOMESTIC COOKERY, 122 [Chap. V. of carrots, they send up raisins boiled in the gravy, which come up quite plump in the dish. STEWED RUMP OF BEEF.—E. R. Half roast the beef, then put it into a pot with three pints of water, a pound of sliced bacon, a bunch of sweet herbs, two wine-glasses of vinegar, and a bottle of cider or small wine; stick three cloves into onions, add a few sage-leaves, and cover the beef closely, adding more water should there not be sufficient gravy from the meat. Boil or let it simmer for three hours; then strain the gravy. Boil or bake some onions, and lay them round the beef; cover it also with forcemeat balls, fried ornaments of paste, and mushrooms, if in season. Strain the gravy, add a glass of port-wine, and any sauce, boil down a part to a glaze, and put it on the beef. Thicken the remainder if necessary, and pour it round, garnishing the dish with pickles. N.B. The flank of beef may be rolled and stewed in the same manner. STEWED BRISKET OF BEEF.—E. R. Take about eight pounds of the brisket, and stew it in sufficient water to cover the meat; when quite tender, take out the bones, and skim off the fat; add to the gravy, when strained, a glass of wine and a little spice tied up in a muslin bag. Have ready either mushrooms, truffles, or vegetables boiled, and cut into shapes. Lay them on and round the beef; reduce part of the gravy to a glaze, lay it on the top, and pour the remainder into the dish. BROILED BEEF STEAK.—E. R. Cut the steaks from a rump of beef about half an inch thick; let the gridiron be hot, well rubbed with beef suet, and the fire clear. Lay on the steaks, let them broil till they begin to brown, then turn them, and, when browned on the other side, lay them on a hot dish for a few minutes with a piece of butter between each;

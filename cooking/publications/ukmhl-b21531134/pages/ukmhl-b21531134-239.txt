Chap. VIII,] M.\DE DISHES. 159 common salt and saltpetre, and let it lie five days. Boil it enough to take out the bones; then lay it on a dresser turning the thick end of one side of the head towards the thin end of the other, to make the roll of equal size; sprinkle it well with salt and white pepper, and roll it with the ears; and, if you approve,, put the pigâ€™s feet round the outside when boned, or the thin parts of two cow-heels. Put it into a cloth, hind with a broad tape, and boil it till quite tender; then put a good weio-ht upon it, and do not take off the covering till cold. If you choose it to be more like brawn, salt it longer, let the proportion of saltpetre be greater, and put in also some pieces of lean pork; and then cover it with cow- heel to look like the horn. This may be kept either in or out of pickle of salt and water boiled, with vinegar; and is a very conve- nient thing to have in the house. If likely to spoil, slice and fry it either with or with- out butter. TO KEEP BR.\WN, THE C.WIBRIDGE WAY. To two gallons of water put one pound of wheat- bran, and a pound of salt; boil one hour; when cold, strain it, and keep the brawn in it. In ten or twelve days fresh pickle will be required. If, by length of carriage or neglect, the brawn be kept too long out of pickle, make as above^ and having rubbed it well with salt, and washed with some of the pickle, it will be quite restored to its former goodness. AN EXCELLENT S.VUCE FOR BR.\WN, OR PIG'S FEET AND E.\KS Boil a quarter of a peck of wheat-bran, a sprig of bay, and a sprig of rosemary in two gallons of water, with four ounces of salt in it, for half an hour. Strain it, and let it get cold.

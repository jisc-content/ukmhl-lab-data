DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. XIII. 266 PE.A.S STEWED WITH MINT.-E. R. Take the hearts of four cabbage lettuces, cut them small, put them into a stewpan with three pints of young gi'een peas, and a little green mint chopped ; add pepper and salt; then take a lump of butter the size of the egg of a goose, and mix it well with the vegetables, taking care not to bruise the peas; then add two table-spoonsful of pump water, a bit of ham, and a whole onion. Put them on the fire to stew until ten- der: twenty minutes will suffice, shaking the pan con- stantly to prevent its burning: when tender, take out the ham and onion, and add a piece more butter rolled in flour, and half a pint of cream ; boil all together for five minutes, and add a tea-spoonful of loaf-sugar pounded. PEA-PODS STEWED.—E. R. Take the sugar pea when young, pare off the outer edges of the pod, carefully removing the strings ; then put them into good gravy, well seasoned, and thickened with butter and flour: let them stew gently until quite tender. The . sugar pea, not having a tough coating under the pod, is the one recommended to be dressed in this manner by the author of the ‘ Vegetable Culti- vator.’ CAULIFLOWER AND BROCCOLI.—E. R. If wanted to be very white, all the leaves must be stripped off, and the cauliflowers divided into handsome sprigs; boil it in butter and water, and send it to table in white sauce. CAULIFLOWER IN WHITE S.AUCE. Half boil it; then cut it into handsome pieces, and lay them in a stewpan with a little broth, a bit of mace, a little salt, and a dust of white pepper; simmer half an hour ; then put a little cream, butter and flour; shake, and simmer a few minutes, and serve.

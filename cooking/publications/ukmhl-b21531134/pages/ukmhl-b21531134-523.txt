Chap. XXI.] CAKES. 443 and a few cloves, the peel of a lemon chopped as fine as possible, a glass of wine, ditto of brandy, twelve yolks and whites of eggs beaten separately and long, orange, citron, and lemon. Beat exceedingly well, and blitter the pan. A quick oven. A VERY FINE C.AKF.. Wash two pounds and a half of fresh butter in water first, and then in rose-water; beat the butter to a cream; beat twenty eggs, yolks and whites separately, half an hour each. Have ready two pounds and a half of the finest flour, well dried, and kept hot, likewise a pound and a half of sugar, pounded and sifted, one ounce of spice in finest powder, three pounds of currants nicely cleaned and dry, half a pound of almonds blanched, and three-quarters of a pound of sweetmeats cut, not too thin. Let all be kept by the fire, mix all the dry in- gredients, pour the eggs strained to the butter, mix half a pint of sweet wine with a large glass of brandy, pour it to the butter and eggs, mix well, then have all the dry things put in by degrees; beat them very tho- roughly—you can hardly do it too much. Having half a pound of stoned jar-raisins chopped as fine as possible,» mix tliem carefully, so that there should be no lump, and add a tea-cupful of orange-flower water. Beat the ingredients together a full hour at least. Have a hoop well buttered, or, if you have none, a tin or copper cake-pan; take a white paper, doubled and buttered, and put in the pan round the edge ; if the cake batter, fill it more than three parts, for space should be allowed for rising. Bake in a quick oven. It will require three hours. ROUT DROP-CAKES.

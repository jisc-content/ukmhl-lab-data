In ten days they will be fit to eat Keep in a cool dry place. TO STEW TONGUE. Salt a tongue with saltpetre and common salt for a week, turning it every day. Boil it tender enough to peel; when done, stew it in a moderately strong gravy; season with soy, mushroom ketchup, cayenne, pounded cloves, and salt, if necessary. Serve with truffles, morels, and mushrooms stewed in gravy. In both this receipt and the next the roots must be taken off the tongues before salting, but some fat must be left. AN EXCEU.EN'^ WAY OF PKEPARING TONGUES TO EAT COLD. Season with common salt and saltpetre, brown sugar, a little bay-salt, pepper, cloves, mace, and allspice, in fine powder, for a fortnight: then take away the pickle, put the tongue into a small pan, and lay some butter on it; cover it with brown crust, and bake slowly till so tender that a straw will go through it. The thin part of tongues, if hung up to dry, grates like hung beef, and also makes a fine addition to the flavour of omelets. TO CURE A TONGUEâ€”E. R. Put the tongue into an earthen pan, rub into it a table-spoonful of saltpetre, a good handful of salt, and the same quantity of coarse brown sugar; allow the tongue to remain in the pickle for three weeks, and rub it over every day with the pickle. Then take it out of the pickle and put it into the meat-screen before the fire for two or three days, till the pickle has entirely drained from it. Then sprinkle it over with bran, and hang it up in any part of the kitchen.

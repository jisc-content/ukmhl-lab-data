POMESTIO COOKERY. 494 [Chap. XXIII. or damp kills them. They must be fed often, and at a distance from the hen, who will eat everything from them. They should have curds, green cheese parings cut small, and bread and milk with chopped wormwood in it; and their drink milk and water, but not left to he sour. All young fowls are a prey for vermin, therefore they should be kept in a safe place, where none can come : weasels, stoats, ferrets, &c., creep in at very small crevices. Let the hen be under a coop, in a warm place exposed to the sun, for the first three or four weeks; and the young should not be suffered to go out in the dew at morning or evening. Twelve eggs are enough to put under a turkey ; and when she is about to lay, lock her up till she has laid every morning. They usually begin to lay in March and sit in April. Feed them near the hen-house; and give them a little meat in the evening, to accustom them to roosting there. Fatten them with sodden oats or barley for the first fortnight; and the last fortnight give them as above, and rice swelled with warm milk over the fire twice a day. The flesh will be beautifully white and fine flavoured. The common way is to cram them, hut they are so ravenous that it seems unnecessary, if they are not suffered to go far from home, which makes them poor. PEA FOWL. Feed them as you do turkeys. They are so shy that they are seldom found for some days after hatching ; and it is very wrong to pursue them, as many ignorant people do, in the idea of bringing, them home : for it only causes the hen to carry the young ones through dangerous places, and by hurrying'she treads upon them. The cock kills all the young chiqkens he can get at, by one blow on the centre of the head with his bill; and he does the same by his own brood before the feathers of the crown come out. Nature therefore impels the hen to keep them out of his way till the feathers rise.

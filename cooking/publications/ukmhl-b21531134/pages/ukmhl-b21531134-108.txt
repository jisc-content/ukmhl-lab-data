[Chap. II. 38 DOMESTIC COOKERY. the freshness of other fish. They are not so delicate as carp and tench. Smelts, if good, are of a fine silvery hue, are very firm, and have a refreshing smell, like cucumbers newly cut. They are caught in the Thames and some other large rivers. Mullets.—The sea are preferred to the river mullets, and the red to the grey. They should be very firm. Their season is August. Gudgeons.—They are chosen by the same rules as other fish. They are taken in running streams; come in about Midsummer, and are to he had for five or six months. Trout and Grayling are excellent fish, and taken in running streams; but the latter is to be found in only a few counties. In season chiefly in the summer months. Eels.—There is a greater difference in the goodness of eels than of any other fish. The true silver eel (so called from the bright colour of the belly) is caught in the Thames. The Dutch eels sold at Billingsgate are very bad: those taken in great floods are generally good, but those in ponds have usually a strong, rank flavour. Except the middle of summer, they are always in season. Flounders.—They should be thick, firm, and have their eyes bright. They very soon become flabby and bad. They are both sea and river fish. The Thames produces the best. They are in season from January to March, and from July to September. Lobsters.—If they have not been long ta.ken, the claws will have a strong motion when you put your fin- ger on the eyes and press them. The heaviest are the best, and it is preferable to boil them at home. When you buy them ready boiled, try whether their tails are stiff, and pull up with a spring : if otherwise, they are not fresh. The cock-lobster is known by the narrow back part of his tail, and the two uppermost fins within it are stiff and hard ; but those of the hen are soft, and the tail broader. The male, though generally smaller.

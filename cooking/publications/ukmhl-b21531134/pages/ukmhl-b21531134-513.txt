COLOURINGS TO STAIN JELLIES, ICES, OR CAKES.* For a beautiful red, boil fifteen grains of cochineal in the finest powder, with a dram and a half of cream of tartar, in half a pint of water, very slowly half an hour. Add in boiling a bit of alum, the size of a pea. Or use beet-root sliced, and some liquor poured over. For white, use almonds finely powdered, with a little drop of water; or use cream. For yellow, yolks of eggs or a hit of saffron steeped in the liquor, and squeezed. Likewise the flower of the crocus, which has no taste. For yreen, pound spinach leaves or beet leaves, ex- press the juice, and boil in a tea-cup in a saucepan of water to take off" the rawness.

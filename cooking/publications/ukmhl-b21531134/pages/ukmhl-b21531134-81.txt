11 SOUPS. Chap. I.] MOCK-TUUTUE SOUP.—E. R. Take a calf’s-head with the skin on, and about two pounds of very delicate pickled pork, the part, without bones, that is chiefly fat. The head must be very well cleaned and soaked; wash the salt from the pork and soak it likewise in lukewarm water; put both into a soup-kettle, with two onions, a bundle of sweet herbs, two sticks of celery, pepper, and pounded mace; fill the kettle with water, and boil very gently till the meat is tender ; take out the head and the pork, separate the meat from the bones, and return the latter into the soup. , Let it stew for some hours longer; when cold take off I the fat, strain the soup, and thicken it; add half or I three-quarters of a pint of white wine, the juice of a 1 lemon, or two glasses of Harvey’s sauce ; cut the meat I of half the head into pieces, and that of the pork also, : and warm it up in the soup, together with egg-balls, i and forcemeat ditto. The pork will be found a most acceptable addition, improving the flavour of the soup, and affording a substitute for the fat of tlie turtle. The ' remaining portion, with the other half of the calf’s-head, I should be rolled according to the directions given in a future page. Half a calf’s-head is quite sufficient to 1 make mock-turtle soup for a party; but as it cannot always be had with the skin on, the receipt is given for I the whole. N.B. Though calves’-heads with the skin on bear a I higher price than those without it, they go farther: I there is no economy in purchasing the inferior article : 1 the tongue should be cured for use, and a very nice I dish may be made of the brains. MfXIK-TURTLE. Bespeak a calf’s-head with the skin on, cut it in half, I and clean it well; then half boil it; take all tbe meat 1 off in square bits, break the bones of the head, and boil them in some veal and beef broth to add to the richness. Fry some shalot in hutter, and dredge in flour enough

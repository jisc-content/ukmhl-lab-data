DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. V. 134 the thick end; then skewer it into the shape of a lyre. Put it into a large stewpan with the root, and any claws, heads, or trimmings of fowl, an onion stuck with cloves, a bundle of sweet herbs, some pepper and salt, a small quantity at first, and then as much water as will be re- quired for stock for a whole dinner. It must be cooked the day before it is wanted, and will be found an elegant and economical dish, as it will furnish the basis neces- sary for all the sauces at a dinner-party: any parings of meat or poultry, ham or bacon bones, may be put with it. Stew the tongue until quite tender, and then take it out. Reduce some of the sauce to a glaze; glaze the tongue, put it on a dish, have ready several slips of boiled carrots, lay them along for the strings of the lyre, and place a wreath of flowers cut in turnips and carrots at each end; it is thus very ornamental to the table, and will, as before remarked, supply all the consommde necessary for a set dinner. TONGUE IN CURRANT-JmCE.—E. R. Cut off the root of a fresh tongue, and split it down not quite to the end; put some butter into a stewpan, and fry the tongue in it, then add half a pint of currant- juice or currant-jelly, a little salt, pepper, and, if the juice be fresh, brown sugar, and stew the whole together for three hours. ROAST NEAT'S TONGUE AND UDDER —E. R. Blanch and boil the tongue and the udder, season them with pepper, salt, and nutmeg, lard them with lardoons, rub them over with yolk of egg, then spit them, and put them to roast. Baste them well with butter, and dredge them with grated bread, adding occasionally a little pounded spice; keep basting and dredging till they are well roasted. Put half a pint of gravy into a saucepan, with the juice of a Seville orange, two lumps of sugar, a glass of claret, and a piece of butter: toss the whole over the fire and serve

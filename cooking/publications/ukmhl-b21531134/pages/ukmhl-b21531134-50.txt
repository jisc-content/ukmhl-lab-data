xliv MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. Cold water thrown on cast-iron, when hot, will cause it to crack. In the following, and indeed all other receipts, though the quantities may be as accurately directed as possible, yet much must be left to the discretion of the person who uses them. The different tastes of people require more or less of the flavour of spices, salt, garlic, butter, &c., which can never be ordered by general rules ; and if the cook has not a good taste, and attention to that of her employers, not all the ingredients which nature and art can furnish will give exquisite flavour to her dishes. The proper articles should be at hand, and she must proportion them until the true zest be obtained, and a variety of flavour be given to the different dishes served at the same time. Those who require maigre dishes will find abundance in this little work; and, where they are not strictly so, by suet or bacon being directed into stuffings, the cook must use butter instead ; and, where meat gravies (or stock, as they are called) are ordered, those made of fish must be adopted.

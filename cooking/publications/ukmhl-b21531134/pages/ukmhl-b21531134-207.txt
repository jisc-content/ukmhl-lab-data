Chap. V.] 127 MADE DISHES. Ian inch and a half deep, and press in, very hard, force- meat made in the following manner : a pound and a half ( of suet sliced very fine, two ounces of cloves, pepper, I salt, winter savory, and sweet marjoram, mixed well C together. The beef must be baked in a deep pan, with \ water reaching about three-quarters of the way up, and j some forcemeat spread over the top, which, when the c meat is baked, is taken off, cut into shapes, and laid ) round the dish. BUBBLE AND SQUEAK.—E. R. Cut slices from a cold round of beef; let them be * fried quickly until brown, and put them into a dish to » keep hot. Clean the pan from the fat; put into it I ■ greens and carrots previously boiled and chopped small; I add a little butter, pepper, and salt; make them very ) hot, and put them round the beef with a little gravy. » Cold pork boiled is a better material for bubble-and- j squeak than beef, which is always hard; in either case i the slices should be very thin and lightly fried. RIBS OF BEEF IN BOUILLI.—E. R. ■ I Take the middle of the flat ribs of beef, stew it until ;4 the meat is tender and the bones will come out, em- J ploying as small a quantity of water as will cover the I j meat, and a bundle of sweet herbs.

R. Take a handsome boiling piece, draw it with a small < * quantity of water until the gravy is out; put it into the # stewpan with a very large bunch of parsley, pepper, salt, n and an onion.

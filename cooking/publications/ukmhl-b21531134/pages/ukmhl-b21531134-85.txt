SOUPS 15 Chap. I.") riOTCII POTCII.—E. R. Take any quantity of lamb-chops, pare off the fat, 1 lay them in a stewpan in this manner: a layer of chops at the bottom, covered with every kind of vege- table cut in small pieces, onions, celery, lettuce, carrots, I turnips, and green peas: then put on a layer of chops, and so on, with the vegetables, until the whole are added: fill up the pan with water, or rathei cover the ingredients with water, and let it stew several hours j very gently : it will be quite thick. j VEAL BROTH.—E.

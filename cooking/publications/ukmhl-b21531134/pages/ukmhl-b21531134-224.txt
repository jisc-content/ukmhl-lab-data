Chap. VI. DOMESTIC COOKERY. 144 MUTTON OR LAMB CHOPS.—E. R. Cut the chops very nicely, pare olF the fat, and fry them a fine brown ; pile them up like hop-poles in the dish, with the hones meeting at the top, and place be- tween each a slice of fried bread cut in the shape of half a large pear. Make a puree of vegetables of any kind, and lay it round in the bottom of the dish: peas or spinach with the lamb, turnips or tomatoes with the mutton. This is a cheap and elegant corner or side dish. BIFSTEAK OF MUTTON.—E. R. This is the name by which broiled mutton-cutlets are known in France and India. Cut them from the fillet of a leg of mutton nearly an inch thick, and broil them exactly like a beefsteak, over a brisk fire, turning them frequently. Serve up with shalot minced upon the dish. SHEEP’S-HEART.—E. R. Take a sheep’s heart and stuff it throughout, using a considerable quantity of chopped bacon in the stuffing ; half boil it, and when cooled a little rub it over with pepper and salt, and wrap it in paste in the shape of a cone. Rub the paste over with the yolk of an egg, and strew vermicelli loosely over it. Set it with the broad end downwards, and bake it in an oven. When baked, send it to table with gravy-sauce. SHEEPS TAILS AND TONGUES.—E. R. Take three tails and three tongues, cut the tails in half and split the tongues. Stew them gently for three hours in as much water as will cover them, adding three spoonsful of vinegar, three onions, a tea-spoonful of mixed spices, and one of salt; these ingredients to be put in after the pot has been skimmed. When the tails. &c., are very tender, take them out, score them, dip them in drawn butter, roll them in grated bread-crumbs.

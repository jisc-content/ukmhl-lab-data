DOMESTIC COOKERY. mixed, pour it upon the brandy and peels, adding the juice of the oranges and of twenty-four lemons; mix well; then strain through a very fine hair-sieve into a very clean barrel that has held spirits, and put two quarts of new milk. Stir, and then bung it close; let it stand six weeks in a warm cellar: bottle the liquor for use, observing great care that the bottles are per- fectly clean and dry, and the corks of the best quality, and well put in. This liquor will keep many years, and is improved by age. ANOTHER WAY. Pare six lemons and three Seville oranges very thin, squeeze the juice into a large tea-pot, put to it two quarts of brandy, one of white wine, and one of milk, and one pound and a quarter of sugar. Let it he mixed, and then covered for twenty-four hours: strain through a jelly-hag till clear, then bottle it. ORANGE PUNCH.—E. R. Dissolve nearly three-quarters of a pound of sugar in a little water, add the juice of two lemons, and pour two quarts of boiling water upon it for the sherbet; then add a glass of calf’s-foot jelly. Mix together a bottle of brandy, a bottle of rum, and one of orange-wine, add it to the sherbet, and drink it either hot or cold. If bottled, and kept in a cold cellar, it will keep for any time. The orange-wine imparts a very fine flavour, which may be heightened by the addition of a bottle of liqueur, cura<joa, or mareschino. REGENTS PUNCH.—E. R. Make the sherbet with green tea, capillaire, and lemon-juice; to five pints of this mixture add a pint of rum, one of brandy, one of arrack, and a bottle of cura^oa, together with a small jar or shape of Guava jelly. Pour in a bottle of champagne, and send up the punch in a bowl or jug, with a pine-apple sliced into it.

VEGETABLES. Chap. Xlll.] 2G9 N.B. The veal and ham simmered with the cucum- bers will also make a good farce. CHICOREE. OR ENDIVE IN VELOUTE.—E. R. Take off the exterior of the endive, leaving nothing but the white; let it lie in water to soak; have it thoroughly washed; then throw a handful of salt into a kettle of boiling water, keeping the endive under it to prevent its turning black; when it will mix with the water it is blanched; try with the finger if it be tender, and, if so, drain it on a sieve, and put it in cold spring water; when perfectly cold, strain it again, and squeeze it quite dry. Chop it, put a good piece of butter in a stewpan with the endive, a little salt and pepper, put in some veloute, that is, rich white sauce, or consommee stock that will jelly ; let it reduce till it becomes thick; send it up with croutons, i. e. fried paste, round. Chicoree la cr6me, or broth, should in either case be thickened with a little flour. LETTUCES FARCIE.—E. R. Having cleaned the lettuces, tie them separately with a string, and boil them. Leave them to drain and cool; then open the leaves and lay in farce or force- meat between each leaf; tie them up carefully, and stew them gently in a braise made of thin slices of bacon, a carrot, an onion, a small bunch of sweet herbs, and a little good gravy. Skim the gravy, strain it, add a glass of white wine, reduce it, and let it be served quite hot. LETTUCE AU FRITUR.—E. R. Tie the lettuces, and boil them; tlien press them quite dry in a cloth. Make the batter the same as for thick pancakes, adding a glass of brandy; allow it to remain four hours before it is wanted, then dip in the lettuces and fry them in lard.

93 Chap. III.] POULTRY. must acquire experience by practice, wild-fowl taking a much shorter time, wild-duck in particular. I <1 TU^EY.—E. R. There is a quaint ad(<^lhat says,— “ Turkey roast is turkey lost; Turkey boiled is turkey spoiled ; But turkey braised is turkey praised.” However, here are directions for roasting and boiling. A roast turkey may be stuffed in various ways, a veal stuffing being the most common. Where truffles are to be had, take about two pounds, peel them, select the small ones, and, after chopping, pound them in a mortar with an equal quantity of the fat of bacon rasped; make the stuffing with this, mixed with some of the larger truffles whole, put them into the body of the turkey, and let it hang for several days; then roast it with a piece of fat bacon laid over the breast, and a paper over that. This being an expensive pre- paration, chestnuts may be substituted for traffles, pounded and mixed with bacon in the same manner. The chestnuts should be boiled, if necessary, to take off the husk, peeled nicely, and pounded : raw chestnuts will impart the finer flavour. A stuffing of sausage or other meat may be put into the crop besides, but the chestnuts should be hung up for some day.s, and the turkey served with chestnut-sauce. Peeled and boiled chestnuts, put whole into the body of a turkey and hung for some days, improve the flavour; but a turkey thus stuffed will require long and careful roasting, and must be put at first at a distance from the fire. Fowls may be dressed in the same way. TURKEY WITH SAUSAGE-MEAT.—E. R. At the messes of European regiments in India, it is no uncommon thfng to bone a turkey and a fowl, and put one inside the other, filling the interstices with ; sausage-meat, a small pig being killed for the purpose. J A turkey thus prepared will take a long time roasting, and must be placed at a great distance from tlie fire at

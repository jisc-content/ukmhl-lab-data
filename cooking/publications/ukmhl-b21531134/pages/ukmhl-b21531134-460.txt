[Chap. XIX DOMESTIC COOKERY. 380 are tied over the bottles they will hang an inch all round below the string. Let the bladders be wet, and tied tightly; then put the bottles up to their necks into a copper of cold water, with some straw between. Light a fire under the copper, and, when the juice of the fruit has boiled up, let the fire go gradually out, and leave the bottles in the water until it is cold. The bladders will have sprung up to their extent, making the bottles perfectly air-tight. Some persons put two bladders and turn the bottles upside down, but this is unnecessary, one being sufficient if properly managed. Fruit, thus preserved, will keep for any number of years, retaining all its original freshness: the contents of every bottle must be used at once, for the air getting in will spoil, and they will require more sugar when put into tarts or puddings.

In making the pies of these gooseberries, the syrup found in the bottles will yield sufficient juice. TO KEEP GRAPES AS IN SWITZERLAND. Fasten packthread lines near the ceiling of a cool but not damp room. Pick the grapes before they are dead ripe: cut out every one that is decayed, but do not let their juice touch those that remain ; seal the extremity of the stalk to keep it from drying, and hang the bunches on the packthread. Pears may be kept in the same way. GRAPES IN BRANDY. Take some close bunches, black or white, not over- ripe, and lay them in a jar. Put a good quantity of pounded white sugar-candy upon them, and fill up the

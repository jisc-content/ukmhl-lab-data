Boil the old peas after separating them from the young, heat them in a mortar, then pass them through a sieve and add them to the stock. Take six large cabbage-lettuces, a few handsful of spinach, and some young onions, or chives; boil them together, strain off the water, and press them very dry; then fry them ' with butter, together with cucumbers pared, floured, and dried; add all these to the soup, with the young I peas, time enough to cook them, and the cucumbers the last thing.

Grey peas-soup is made the same way: the following is a cheaper method. Take a pint of whole peas, steep them in cold water for an hour, put them into a saucepan with a quart of water, and boil them until they can be pulped through a sieve, then add them to the broth, which must be already seasoned, boil together for a few mi- nutes, and serve up with fried bread in the tureen, and powdered mint in a plate. VEGETABLE SOUP.—E. R.

A CHEAP AND AVHOLESOME SOUP.—E. R.

A SIMPLE SOUP.—E. R. Take three quarts of good broth, cut into a stewpan two carrots, three or four turnips, two heads of celery, a lettuce, a little parsley, and some small onions, and a little butter and gravy. Stew until the vegetables be- come quite tender, so as to permit them to be rubbed through a sieve : to this may be added a few spoonsful of I'ice, or pearl-barley, boiled separately ; add the whole together, and boil for a quarter of an hour. BARLEY BROTH.—E. R. Take a breakfast-cupful of pearl-barley, boil it in a gallon of water gently for half an hour, then take three pounds of meat—lamb, or mutton-chops, with the fat cut off, or lean beef—put them into a separate stewpan, dress them with a small quantity of water, add to them any kind of vegetables, carrots, and turnips, with small onions, celery, and green peas if in season, salt, pepper, and, with the water and the barley, let the whole boil gently for two hours, or longer, and serve it up all together^

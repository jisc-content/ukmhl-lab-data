386 [Chap. XIX. DOMESTIC COOKERY. TO PRESERVE NECTARINES.â€”E. R. Split the fruit, take (-ut the stones, and put the nec- tarines into clarified sugar till they take it well. Skim the li jUor, cover the nectarines with paper, and set them hy until the next day. Add sugar to the syrup, boiling it until it will flow; put in the nectarines, give them a good boil, skim, cover them, and lay them on a stove. The next day take them out of the sugar, drain them, place them separately, dusting sugar over them; the next day put them on the stove, or into a cool oven, to dry. TO PRESERVE ORANGES OR LEMONS IN JELLY. Cut a hole in the stalk part the size of a shilling, and with a small blunt knife scrape out the pulp quite clear, without cutting the rind. Tie each separately in mus- lin, and lay them in spring-water two days, changing twice a-day ; in the last boil them tender on a slow fire. (')bserve that there is enough at first to allow for wast- ing, as they must he covered to the last. To every pound of fruit weigh two pounds of double-refined sugar and one pint of water; boil the two latter toge- ther with the juice of the orange to a syrup, and clarify it, skim well, and let it stand to be cold ; then boil the fruit in the syrup half an hour; if not clear, do this daily till they are done. Pare and core some green pippins, and boil in water till it tastes strong of them ; do not break them, only gently press them with the back of a spoon ; strain the water through a jelly-bag till quite clear ; then to every pint put a pound of double-refined sugar, the peel and juice of a lemon, and boil to a strong syrup. Drain off the syrup from the fruit, and, turning each orange with the hole upwards in the jar, pour the apple-jelly over it. The hits cut out must go through the same process with the fruit. Cover with brandy-paper. TO KEEP ORANGES OR LEMONS FOR PUDDINGS, &c. When you squeeze the fruit, throw the outside in

POULTRY. 165 Chap. IX.] brush the cutlets with an egg, lay on the forcemeat, dredge fried crumbs on the top, and fry them a light brown; serve them up with gravy in the dish, or dry, with a lemon squeezed over them. FOWL WITH PE.VS.—E. R. Put some butter into a stewpan, add flour until it is rather stiff, then put in some small pieces of bacon; let it brown a little, then cut up the fowl and put it in; moisten the gravy, mix it well, and season with pars- ley, sorrel, young onions, half a bay-leaf, and a clove, and let it boil. Put in the peas over a quick fire, skim, and when done enough pour the sauce over the fowl. PUREE DE VOL.\ILLE.—E. R. Mince the white part of cold fowl or turkey very finely, then pound it in a mortar; put in two or three spoonsful of white sauce, and paiss it through a sieve, adding a little salt and white pepper, and warm the whole. It may be served up with the legs grilled. It should not be too thin, but can be made the proper con- sistence by a greater or smaller quantity of white sauce, or cream. Garnish with fried bread, or paste cut in shapes. It may be also served up in a casserole, or wall of rice and mashed potatoes, or with poached eggs. souffle of PUREe DE VOLAILLE.-E. R. Make the puree as above directed, only much thicker, adding two ounces of butter; stir it well over the fire, and when warm, add the yolks and the whites of four or six eggs, according to the quantity of meat, well beaten, separately : mix the whole lightly together, then put it into a dish, and let it remain in the oven until it is firm. If put warm into the oven it will be ready a quarter of an hour sooner; then should the eggs be served with the puree cold. Observe. These dishes may be made of cold fillet of veal.

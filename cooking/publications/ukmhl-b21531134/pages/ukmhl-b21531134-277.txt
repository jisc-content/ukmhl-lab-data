197 PIES. Chap. X.J cut the other parts in small bits, put them in a small tosser with a grate of nutmeg, the least white pepper and salt, a morsel of lemon-peel, cut so small that you can scarcely see it, a little cream, and a little of the oyster liquor. Simmer a few minutes before you fill. Observe to put a bit of crust into all patties, to keep them hollow while baking. LOBSTER PATTIES. Make with the same seasoning, a little cream, and the smallest bit of butter. PODOVIES, OR BEEF PATTIES. Shred underdone dressed beef with a little fat, season with pepper, salt, and a little shalot or onion. Make a plain paste, roll it thin, and cut in shape like an apple puff; fill it with mince, pinch the edges, and fry them of a nice brown. The paste should be made with a small quantity of butter, egg, and milk; VEAL PATTIES. Mince some veal that is not quite done, with a little parsley, lemon-peel, a scrape of nutmeg, and a bit of salt; add a little cream and gravy just to moisten the meat; and if you have any ham, scrape a little, and add to it. Do not warm it till the patties are baked. TURKEY PATTIES. Mince some of the white part, and with grated lemon, nutmeg, salt, a very little white pepper, cream and a very little bit of butter warmed. Fill the patties. A GOOD MINCE FOR PATTIES. Two ounces of ham, four of chicken or veal, one egg boiled hard, three cloves, a blade of mace, pepper and salt, in fine powder. Just before you serve, warm the above with four spoonsful of rich gravy, the same of cream, and an ounce of butter. Fill as usual.

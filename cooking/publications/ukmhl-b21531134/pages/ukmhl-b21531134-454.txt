[Chap. XVIII. 374 DOMESTIC COOKERY. WINE VINEGAR. The raisins must not be pressed, but drained from the liquor; lay them in a tub, in a heap, to heat. ,In three or four days add fifteen gallons of water to every hun- dred weight. Let the mash he well beaten, and stirred often, for forty-eight hours; then strain and press them in a hair-bag. Put the liquor into a barrel, with a toast covered with yeast. Mind that the cask be full, and set over a tub to work. When it ceases to fernaent cover the bung-hole with a piece of slate. Keep it in a warm place. GOOSEBERRY VINEGAR. Boil spring water; and when cold, put to every three quarts a quart of bruised gooseberries in a large tub. Let them remain sixty hours, stirring often; then strain through a hair-bag, and to each gallon of liquor add a pound of the coarsest sugar. Put it into a barrel, and a toast and yest; cover the bung-hole with a bit of slate, &c., as above. Set the barrel in the sun, ob- serving that the cask be well painted, and the iron hoops all firm. The greater the quantity of sugar and fruit the stronger the vinegar; and as this is particularly useful for pickles, it might be well to make it of double the strength for that purpose. SUGAR VINEGAR. To every gallon of spring water put two pounds of the very coarsest sugar; boil and skim thoroughly; then put one quart of cold water to every gallon of hot. When cool, put into it a toast spread with yest. Stir it nine days: then barrel, and set it in a place where the sun will lie on it, with a bit of slate on the bung- hole. Observe the caution about the barrel, as above. Make in March: it will be ready in six months. VINEGAR MADE OF MALT. Pour ten gallons of boiling water on a bushel of

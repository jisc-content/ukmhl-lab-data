PREFACE. XX rably adapted to this purpose, since the heat can be regulated by the required temperature. The heads, brains, &c., of animals—everything, in fact, which in the cleansing process requires soaking—should be soaked in warm, not hot water, as the hot water will fix the blood and injure both the appearance and the flavour of the viand. All cooks must be particular in keeping their saucepans well skimmed: nothing will more completely spoil a dish of any kind than the neglect of this essential point. In order to take ofT the fat from a braise, or any other gravy, plunge the basin containing it in cold water: the fat will immediately coagulate, and may be removed. Coarse nets suspended in the store-room are vcrv useful in preserving the flner kinds of fruit, lemons, &c , which are spoiled if allowed to touch. Apples may be preserved in excellent condition for a long period, by being packed in large barrels with dry sand. Peach-leaves vdll answer the purpose of bay-leaves, giving the same flavour.

DAIRY. 4S5 Chap. XXIII.] Fresh nettles, or two pewter plates, will ripen cream- cheese very well. OB.SERV.ATIONS RESPECTING BUTTER. There is one article of family consumption more in use, of greater variety in goodness, of more consequence to have of a superior quality, and the economizing of which is more necessary, than this. The sweetness of butter is not affected by the cream being turned of which it is made. When cows are in turnips, or eat cab- bages, the taste is very disagreeable, and the following ways have been tried with advantage to obviate it;â€” When the milk is strained into the pans, put to every six gallons one gallon of boiling water. Or dissolve one ounce of nitre in a pint of spring water, and put a quarter of a pint to every fifteen gallons of milk. Or, when you churn, keep hack a quarter of a pint of the sour cream, and put it into a well-scalded pot, into which you are to gather the next cream; stir that well, and do so with every fresh addition. TO MAKE BUTTER. During summer, skim the milk when the .sun has not heated the dairy; at that season it should stand for butter twenty-four hours without skimming, and forty- eight in winter. Deposit the cream-pot in a very cold cellar, if your dairy is not more so. If you cannot chum daily, change it into scalded fresh pots; but never omit churning twice a-week. If possible, put the churn in a thorough air; and if not a barrel one, set it in a tub of water two feet deep, which will give firmness to the butter. When the butter is come, pour off the but- termilk, and put the butter into a fresh-scalded pan, or tubs which have afterwards been in cold water. Pour water on it, and let it lie to acquire some hardness be- fore you work it; then change the water, and beat it with flat hoards so perfectly that not the least taste of the buttermilk remain, and that the water, which must he often changed, shall be quite clear in colour.

nOMKSTIC COOK EH Y. 388 [Chap. XIX. ANOTHER WAY TO .M.AKE QUINCE MARMALADE. Pare and quarter quinces, weigli an equal quantity of sugar; to four pounds of the latter put a quart of water, boil and skim, and have it ready against four pounds of quinces are made tolerably tender by the fol- lowing mode; lay them in a stone jar, with a tea-cup of water at the bottom, and pack them with a little su- gar strewed between; cover the jar close, and set it on a stove or cool oven, and let them soften till the colour become red; then pour the fruit-syrup and a quart of quince-juice into a preserving pan, and boil altogether till the marmalade be completed, breaking the lumps of fruit with the preserving-ladle. This fruit is so hard that if it be not done as above it requires a great deal of time. Stewing quinces in a jar, and then squeezing them through a cheese-cloth, is the best method of obtaining the juice to add as above : dip the cloth in boiling water first and wring it. TO PRESERVE WHOLE OR HALF QUINCES. Into two quarts of'i^iling water put a quantity of the fairest* golden pippins, jn slices not very thin, and not pared, but wiped clean. Boil them very quick, close covered, till the water becomes a thick jelly; then scald the quinces. To every ]unt of pippin-jelly put a pound of the finest sugar; boil it, and skim it clear. Put ^ those quinces that are to be dpne whole into the syrup at once, and let it boil veiy fast; and those that are to be in halves by themselves^ 'skim it, and when the fruit is clear put some of the syrup into a glass to try wh ther it jellies before taking oft’ the fire. The quantity of quinces is to be a pound to a pound of sugar, and a })ound of jelly already boiled with the sugar. BIFFINS.—E. R. Take the red biffin apple, and put them into a cool

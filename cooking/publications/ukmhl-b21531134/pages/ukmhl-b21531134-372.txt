DOMESTIC COOKERY. 292 [Chap. XV, it is pretty thick, adding a little water if necessary. When about to serve it up, put in the onions chopped fine and a little lemon-juice.—Obs. To suit the English taste a larger quantity of gravy should be made, and the oiliness of the butter absorbed with a little flour. BENGAL CURRY.—E. R. Take a drachm of red pepper, six onions and one ounce of coriander-seed free from the husks, rub the seeds perfectly smooth in a mortar, and then add and pound the pepper and onions, mixing all well together. Set a quarter of a pound of butter in a stewpan on the fire, slice an onion into it, and when the latter is brown, take it out, and put in two drachms of turmeric. Let it fry until the raw flavour goes off; then mix half a pint of curds with--the pounded ingredients, and put the whole into the pan with the meat cut in pieces, two ounces of grated cocoa-nut, and a little salt. Stir the stew continually, and, while the meat is getting brown, sprinkle water to prevent it from burning. This is a dry curry; the addition of gravy will alter its character, and it may be varied with potatoes, boiled and sliced, peas, artichoke-bottoms, or any other vegetable. VEGETABLE CURRY —E. R. Put two ounces of butter into a stewpan, then roll ce- lery, onions, and broccoli in curry-powder, and stew them until tender ; add a cupful of good gravy, a small quan- tity of mashed potatoes mixed up with curry-powder, and salt. Stew the whole together until sufficiently done. MILK CURRY.—E. R. Take a dessert-spoonful of salt, and a tea-spoonful of mixed spices, a table-spoonful of flour, and four spoonsful of cream. Cut four onions and two shalots nito slices, and fry them in butter till tender; then take any kind of meat or fish, cut it into small pieces, flour and fry them brown; then take the meat out of the fryingpan, dredge it with curry-powder, put it into a stewpan with the onions, cream, &c., and stew it for

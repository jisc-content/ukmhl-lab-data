Chap. XXIV.] 505 COFFEE. TO MULL WINE. Boil some spice in a little watex* till the flavour is gained, then add an equal quantity of port, some sugar and nutmeg ; boil together, and serve with toast. .\NOTHER WAY. Boil a bit of cinnamon and some grated nutmeg a few minutes in a large tea-cupful of water: then put to it a pint of port wine, and add sugar to your taste; beat it up, and it will be ready. Or it may be made of good British wine. TO MAKE COFFEE. Put two ounces of fresh-ground coffee, of the best qnality, in a coffee-pot, and pour eight coffee-cups of boiling w'ater on it; let it boil six minutes, pour out a cupful two or three times, and return it again; then put two or three isinglass-chips into it and pour one large spoonful of boiling water on it, and boil it five minutes more, aixd set the pot by the fire to keep hot for ten minutes, and you will have coffee of a beautiful clearness. Fine cream should always be served with coffee, and either pounded sugar-candy or fine Lisbon sugar. If for foreigners, or those who like it extremely strong, make only eight dishes from three ounces. If not fresh roasted, lay it before the fire until perfectly hot and dry; or you may put the smallest bit of fresh butter into a preserving-pan of a small size, and when hot, throw the coffee in it, and toss it about until it be freshened, letting it be cold before ground. COFFEE MILK. Boil a dessert-spoonful of ground coffee in nearly a pint of milk, a quarter of an hour; then put into it a shaving or two of isinglass, and clear it; let it boil a few minutes, and set it on the side of the fire to grow fine. This is a very fine breakfast; it should be sweetened w'ith real Lisbon sugar of a good quality.

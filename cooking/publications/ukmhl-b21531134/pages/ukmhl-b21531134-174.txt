Cut a pound of veal and the same quantity of fat bacon into small pieces, and lay them in a stewpan with half a pound of butter; do not allo\i^^hem to brown, but while the meat is white pour on bdftfhg water, adding at the same time a clove, half a bay-leaf, a bundle of sweet herbs, and a little shalot.

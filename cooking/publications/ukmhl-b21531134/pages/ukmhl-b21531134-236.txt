VJII. • suet, season with a little pepper, soak a piece of bread in the oyster liquor, pound, and add it with the oysters cut in pieces to the veal, beat up an egg to bind them together, and roll them into little lengths, like sau- sages'; fry them in butter a delicate brown. WHITE PUDDINGS.—E. R. To two parts of beef-suet chopped, add one part of oatmeal previously toasted before the fire, boil an onion or two, and chop them with pepper and salt, mix the whole well together, put the ingredients into skins, and boil them for an hour, pricking them as they boil to prevent their bursting. They will keep for some time in bran after they have been allowed to become cold. Parboil them when wanted, and then broil them on a gridiron. Obs. The quantity of suet may in making seem disproportioned to the oatmeal, but unless there are two-thirds of the former to one of the latter, the puddings will be dry and bad. They require to be highly seasoned with pepper and onions. FARM-HOUSE RECEIPT FOR BLACK PUDDINGS.—E. R. Warm a pot, and put a handful of salt in it, to catch the blood; keep stirring while running, wash it well, and pass it through a sieve; and add a pint or more of groats immediately. Then set it in a cool place, and stir it occasionally; soften the remainder of the groats over the fire in as much new milk as will cover them, letting them simmer for a quarter of an hour. When cold put them to the blood, with a little cayenne pepper, one ounce of black pepper, and salt, one pint of cream, one pint of melted lard, a basin of bread-crumbs, some onions, leeks, and a very few shalots chopped small. Cut some fat into pieces, and when the other ingredients are mixed put them into skins, taking care that there shall be a due proportion of the fat. Boil them for ten minutes; then take them out and cover them in a sheaf of straw for half an hour; then boil them ten niinutes more, and cover them in the straw until cold.

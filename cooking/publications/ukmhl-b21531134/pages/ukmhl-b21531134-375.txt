When dry, add a pound of preserved pine-apples with some of the syrup; or, should pine- apples not be attainable, slices of apple boiled with sugar.

Take half a pound of the neck of mutton ; boil it well; boil also two cups of rice, the same as for curry. Cut the boiled mutton into small pieces and fry it in

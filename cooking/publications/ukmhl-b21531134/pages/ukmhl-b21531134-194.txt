Make the pieces up into handsome shapes of an equal size. Then take some of the stock in which the feet were boiled, removing the fat and straining the jelly when melted; make this into thick white sauce with cream or roux; warm up the calves’-feet in it, and send it to the table either plain or with a quantity of aspara- gus-tops, previously boiled, and cut into small pieces.

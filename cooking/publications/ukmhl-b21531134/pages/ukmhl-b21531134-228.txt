DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VII. 148 burning for five minutes, then dredge the ingredients witli flour, stir it over the fire for two minutes longer ; then add a pint and a half of broth, and a pint of cream ; stir the whole until it boils, and thicken ; then strain the sauce. Take a sufficient quantity to moisten the minced sweetbreads, season it with pepper and salt, and boil the mixture for three or four minutes, and then put it on a dish until cold. When cold make up the sweetbreads into balls not larger than a walnut, then roll them in bread-crumbs ; beat up three eggs, whites and yolks, upon a soup-plate, and roll the balls in it, turning them round three or four times with a silver spoon; then roll them again in fine bread-crumbs, and put them into a cool place until wanted. Fry them in fat or lard, as hot as possible, or they will burst; they will take six minutes. Serve them up upon a napkin with fried parsley : the remainder of the sauce will be found useful for white fricassee, or any other dish of the kind, for a set dinner. VEAL RISSOLES—E.K.

Beat up one or two eggs just to moisten the mass, so that it may be rolled into balls without the addition of flour ; fry them with some dry bread-crumbs strewed over, and serve them in a dish with a good way, gravy. N.B. Any other meat may be made in the same and the flavour varied by the admixture of chopped herbs. Vermicelli may supply the place of crumbs. RISSOLES, A-L’ESPAGNOLE.—E. R.

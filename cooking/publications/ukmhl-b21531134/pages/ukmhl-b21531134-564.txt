4P4 DOMESTIC COOKERY. [CiiAP. xxm. ANOTHER. Have ready a kettle of boiling water, put five quarts of new milk into a pan, and five pints of cold water, and five of hot; when of a proper heat, put in as much rennet as will bring it in twenty minutes, likewise a bit of sugar. When come, strike the skimmer three or four times down, and leave it on the curd. In an hour or two lade it into the vat without touching it; put a two-pound weight on it when the whey has run from it, and the vat is full. ANOTHER SORT. Put as much salt to three pints of raw cream as shall season it; stir it well, and pour into a sieve in which you have folded a cheese-cloth three or four times, and laid at the bottom. When it hardens, cover it with nettles on a pewter plate. RUSH CREAM CHEESE. To a quart of fresh cream put a pint of new milk warm enough to make the cream a proper warmth, a bit of sugar, and a little rennet. Set near the fire till the curd comes ; fill a vat made in the form of a brick, of wheat-straw or rushes sewed together. Have ready a square of straw or rushes sewed flat, to rest the vat on, and another to cover it, the vat being open at top and bottom. Next day take it out, and change it as above to ripen. A half-pound weight will be sufficient to put on it. ANOTHER WAY. Take a pint of very thick sour cream from the top of the pan for gathering butter, lay a napkin on two plates and pour half into each; let them stand twelve hours, then put them on a fresh wet napkin in one plate, and cover with the same: this do every twelve hours until you find the cheese begins to look dry, then ripen it with nut-leaves: it will be ready in ten days.

Chap. XXIII.] 483 DAIRY. all the whey pass through. Put on clean boards, and change and scald them. TO PRESERVE CHEESE SOUND. Wash in warm whey, when you have any, and wipe it once a month, and keep it on a rack. If you want to ripen it, a damp cellar will bring it forward. When a whole cheese is cut, the larger quantity should be spread with butter inside, and the outside wiped, to preserve it. To keep those in daily use moist, let a clean cloth be wrung out from cold water, and wrap round them when carried from table. * Dry cheese may be used to advantage to grate for serving with maccaroni or eating without. These observations are made with a view to make the above articles less expensive, as in most fami- lies where much is used there is waste. TO MAKE SAGE CHEESE. Bruise the tops of young red sage in a mortar with some leaves of spinach, and squeeze the juice; mix it with the rennet in the milk, more or less according as you like for colour and taste. When the curd is come, break it gently, and put it in with the skimmer, till it is pressed two inches above the vat. Press it eight or ten hours. Salt it, and turn every day. * CREAM CHEESE. Put five quarts of strippings, that is, the last of the milk, into a pan, with two spoonsful of rennet. When the curd is come, strike it down two or three times with the skimming-dish just to break it. Let it stand two hours, then spread a cheese-cloth on a sieve, put the curd on it, and let the whey drain; break the curd a little with your hand, and put it into a vat with a two- pound weight upon it. Let it stand twelve hours, take it out, and bind a fillet round. Turn every day till dry from one board to another; cover them with nettles or clean dock-leaves, and put between two pewter plates to ripen. If the weather be warm, it will be ready in three weeks. 2i2

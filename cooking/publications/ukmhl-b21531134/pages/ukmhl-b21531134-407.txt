Chap. XVI.] 327 FORCEMEAT. with some broth, and a little parsley chopped fine ; stir it with a wooden spoon till it becomes quite soft. Let it get cold, then pound the fowl until it will pass through a tammy; pound the bread also, and put it through the sieve ; then put equal parts of the meat, butter, and bread together, and pound them with yolks of eggs sufficient to make it into a proper consistence, and keep it in a jar for use. FARCE OF HAM AND VEAL.—E. R. Mince equal quantities of ham and veal, a bunch of parsley, and some pepper; put it on the fire with a little broth; let it stew very gently, then pound it in a mortar: add to it an equal portion of bread soaked in milk and pounded, pound the whole together with some butter, and mi.x it with the yolks of eggs. Obs.—Bacon and veal which have been used in braising, or anything being highly impregnated with the flavour of herbs and onions, and very rich, may he employed afterwards as a farce, pounded and mixed with panada. COMMON VEAL STUFFING.—E. R. Take equal quantities of beef-suet and crumbs of bread, chop the suet very finely: chop together a bundle of sweet, herbs; add to them a tea or salt spoon- ful of grated lemon-peel, and pepper and salt. Ude, who is good authority, observes, that “ it would not be amiss to add a piece of butter, and pound the whole in a mortar mix it up with eggs. Obs.—Grated ham or tongue may be added to this stuffing. By mixing with any potted meat or game an equal proportion of soaked bread, which will always be lighter than bread-crumbs, the cook will have at once a very fine species of farce, to be employed in stuffing olives, fillets of fowl, &c. Bacon or butter must always be sub- stituted for suet, when the forcemeat is to be eaten cold. At many tables, where everything else is well done, it is common to find very bad stuffing.

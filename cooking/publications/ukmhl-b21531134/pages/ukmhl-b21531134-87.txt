I ] SOUPS. o 17 quarts of soup, beat the yolks of two eggs with a quar- ter of a pint of cream, stir it into the soup, when the rice is tender, taking care not to let the soup boil, and stirring the same way till the soup is served. P£L\S PORRIDGE.—E. R. Fry a couple of onions, and a stick of celery, and put them, with a bundle of sweet herbs, a couple of anchovies, or half a red herring, into three quarts of water, with'a crust of bread floured, pepper and salt; boil all together, very gently, until the flavour is ex- tracted from the herbs; then skim the liquor, and strain it. Add a pound of raw potatoes grated, and a pint of split peas; when the peas are soft, beat them through a sieve, with the soup, and if the porridge should not be thick enough, add a little flour and but- ter. Cut half a dozen leeks into pieces, and, after the peas have been beaten, boil them in the soup, and send them to table. A PEPPER-POT TO BE SERVED IN A TUREEN. To three quarts of water put vegetables according to the season: in summer, peas, lettuce, and spinach; in winter, carrots, turnips, celery, and onions in both. Cut small, and stew with two pounds of neck of mutton, or a fowl and a pound of pickled pork, in three quarts of water, till quite tender. On first boiling, skim. Half an hour before serving, add a lobster or crab, cleared from the bones. Season with salt and cayenne. A small quantity of rice should be put in with the meat. Some people choose very small suet dumplings boiled with it Should any fat rise, skim nicely, and put half a cup of water with a little flour. Pepper-pot may be made of various things, and is understood to be a due proportion of fish, flesh, fowl, vegetables and pulse. c

Shake the'bottle three or four times a-day, then add fourteen ounces of loaf-sugar dis- solved in half a pint of boiling water, and let it stand one day and night longer, shaking the bottle frequently. Then strain it, and filter it afterwards in blotting-paper such as the chemists use : bottle it, and it will be fit to drink in six months, but will improve by keeping for a year. The author of the receipt recommends the gin to be purchased of Isaac Gillet, 204 and 205, Piccadilly, who sells an excellent spirit at 18s. per gallon. NOYE.4.U, No. 2. To one quart of English gin put three ounces of bitter almonds, blanched' and cut into pieces, and the rind of three lemons.

To every pound of cherries put half a pound of lump- sugar, half an ounce of bitter almonds, and four peach- leaves ; cut the stalks of the cherries, and put them with the sugar, &c. in bottles, filling the bottles with brandy. When Morello cherries are used, after three months the liquor may be poured off, and more brandy added. RATAFIA. Blanch two ounces of peach and apricot kernels, bruise and put them into a bottle, and fill nearly up with brandy. Dissolve half a pound of white sugar- candy in a cup of cold water, and add to the brandy after it has stood a month on the kernels, and they are strained off; then filter through paper and bottle for use. The leaves of peaches and nectarines, when the trees are cut in the spring, being distilled, are an excellent substitute for ratafia in puddings.

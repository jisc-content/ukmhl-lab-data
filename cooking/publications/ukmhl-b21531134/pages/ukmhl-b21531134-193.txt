MADE DISHES. . 113 Chap. IV'.] VEAL CUTLETS STEWED WITH CELERY.—E. R. Cut the cutlets from the best part of the neck, taking care in removing the meat from the bones to cut it in a good shape; make gravy of the bones, strewing them with three or four heads of celery cut and scalded, a little salt, pepper, and stewed onion; strain the gravy, returning the celery into it; thicken it with butter and flour, and pour it boiling hot upon the cutlets. Stew them till they ar^ tender, and garnish with lemon and small forcemeat-balls fried. SCOTCH COLLOPS.—E. R. Cut the collops thin, beat them a little, fry them in butter for about two minutes, after having seasoned them with a little beaten mace; place them in a deep dish as they are fried, and cover them with gravy. Put some butter into the frying-pan, and allow it just to change colour. Then strain the collops through a colander from the gravy, and fry them quickly; pour the burnt butter from the pan, and put in the gravy, adding a little lemon-juice. The gravy may be made of the trimmings of the veal; serve it up with forcemeat- balls. SCOTCH COLLOPS, WHITE.—E. R. Cut the collops the size of a crown piece, and not I much thicker; butter the bottom of the stewpan and lay the meat piece by piece upon it, having shaken a little flour upon the butter; add two blades of mace and a little ( nutmeg. Set the stewpan on the fire, and toss it to- gether until the meat is very white; then add half a pint of strong veal broth and a quarter of a pint of cream; toss the whole, and, when simmered enough, let them just boil; add a little lemon-juice, some forcemeat-balls, and either oysters or mushrooms, which must both be I very white; if necessary, thicken the sauce with the I yolk of eggs, but do not let it boil afterwards.

To a pound of mashed potatoes, while hot, add four ouufes of suet and two ounces of flour, a little salt, and as much milk as will give it the consistence of common suet pudding. Put it into a dish, or roll it into dump- lings, and bake of a fine brown. CUSTARD PUDDING.—E. R. Boil a quart of milk until it is reduced to a pint; take from it a feW'iipoonsful, and let it cool, mixing with it very perfectly one spoonful o^ floui’, wdiich add to the boiling milk, and stir it until quite cool. Beat four yolks and two whites of eggs, strain them, and stir them into the milk with two ounces of sifted sugar, two or three spoonsful of wine, and a little grated nutmeg. Put it into a basin, tie a cloth over it, and boil it half an hour, untie the cloth, cool the basin a little, lay a dish upon the top of it, and turn it out. CUSTARD.—E. R. Boil half a pint of new milk, with a piece of lemon- peel, two peach leaves, and eight lumps of white sugar. Should cream be employed instead of milk, there will be no occasion to skim it. Beat the yolks and whites of three eggs, strain the milk through coarse muslin, or a hair-sieve ; then mix the eggs and milk very gradu- ally together, and simmer it gently on the fire, stirring it until it thickens. RICE CUSTARD.—E. R. Take a cup of whole Carolina rice, and seven cups of milk; boil it by placing the pan in water, which must never be allowed to go off the boil till it thick- ens ; then sweeten it: add an ounce of pounded sweet almonds.

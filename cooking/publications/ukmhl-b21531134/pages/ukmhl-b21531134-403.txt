Chap. XVI.] S.iUCES. 323 APPLE SAUCE PIQUANT.—E. R. Pulp the apples, and, if wanted of a good colour, add to them a little juice of beet-root or cochineal: season with cayenne pepper, and a glass of vinegar or lemon- pickle, taking care not to make it too acid. This will prove a substitute for tomato, or sorrel sauce, when neither can be obtained ; if for the latter, a little spinach juice will give it a colour. HORSE-RADISH SAUCE FOR FISH.-E. R. Stew an onion in a little fish gravy until it will pulp; add a tea-spoonful of grated horse-radish, and one or two spoonsful of essence of anchovies. Beat all together over a fire, thicken it with a little butter, and finish with a spoonful of lemon-pickle or lemon-juice. Vinegar may be substituted, in which case it must be mixed with the horee-radish, and bciled with it; while the lemon, or lemon-pickle, being of a more delicate fla- should only be warmed. ANOTHER HORSE-RADISH SAUCE.—E. R. Scrape the horseradish thin and chop it small, or grate it, which is better; warm it in melted butter, adding a spoonful of mushroom ketchup, and one of walnut, or the vinegar from walnut-pickle. HORSE RADISH SAUCE FOR HOT OR COLD ROAST MEAT.-E. R. Scrape very fine or grate the horseradish; add a little made mustard, and two spoonsful of pounded white sugar, to four of vinegar. Mix the whole well together. This sauce should be very thick. HORSE RADISH SAUCE FOR A TURKEY.—E. R. Slice two or three onions very thin, scrape an equal quantity of horse-radish very fine; put them together into a stewpan with nearly half a pint of water, and half the quantity of good vinegar, and a little salt Y 2

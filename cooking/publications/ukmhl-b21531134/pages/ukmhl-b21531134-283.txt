Chap. XI.] PUDDINGS. 203 spoonsful of fresh table-beer, or one of yeast, will serve instead of eggs, as also will snow. Tw'o large spoonsful of snow will supply the place of one egg, and make a pudding equally good. This is auseftil piece of inform- ation, as snow generally falls in tlie season when eggs are dear. The sooner it is used after it falls the better,; but it may be taken up from a clean spot, and kept in a cool place some hours without losing its good qualities. Bottled malt liquors are also a good substitute for eggs; the sooner used after the cork is drawn the better.

If a pudding is to be turned out, the whole dish must be buttered, and lined with paste. The ingredients of puddings should not be put into the basin or dish till the minute they go into the water or oven. Great care is necessary to prevent rich crusts from becoming brown, which makes them rank. A piece of paper put over them will preserve the colour. Sago, and all sorts of seeds, should lie in water an hour before they are made'into puddings, and be well washed; the want of this caution, causes an earthy taste.

A small pinch of salt improves the flavour of all mix- tures, even when the other ingredients are sweet. Well-made raisin wine will serve, in most cases, when wine is ordered for puddings. As the goodness of boiled puddings greatly depends upon keeping the w'ater from the ingredients the cook

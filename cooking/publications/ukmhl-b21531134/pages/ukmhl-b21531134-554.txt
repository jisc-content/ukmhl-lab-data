A cask which has held brandy is to be preferred. Put in the bung after the expiration of the month; lay a piece of coarse cloth over it, and cover the whole with a thick coat of resin. Let it stand twelve months, and then bottle it. Obs.—A sample of this wine was sent to the Horti- cultural Society of Edinburgh, and exhibited amongst seventy different sorts, and being pronounced the best, the honour of the gold medal was awarded to it; but on understanding that the fruit was of English growth, it was considered as a foreign wime, and therefore not entitled to the prize. Honourable mention was, how- ever, made concerning it in the Report of the Transac- tions of the Society. GREEN GOOSEBERRY WINE.—E. R. Take thirty-two quarts of unripe gooseberries of the green kind, bruise them well, add thirty-two quarts of cold water; let them stand for four-and-twenty hours. Drain the gooseberries well from the liquor through a sieve. Put three pounds and a half of lump-sugar to every gallon of liquor; put it into a cask with a bottle of the best gin. Let it stand six months, and then bottle it.

R, Gather the grapes when they are just turning, or about half ripe. Pound them in a tub, and to every quart of fruit thus pounded put two quarts of water.

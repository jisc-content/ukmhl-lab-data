Mangoes should be done soon after they are gathered. Large cucumbers, called green turley, prepared as mangoes, are excellent, and come sooner into eating. Mark, the greater number of times boiling vinegar is poured over either sort, the sooner it will be ready. TO PICKLE W.VLNUTS. When they will bear a pin to go into them, put a brine of salt and water, boiled, and strong enough to bear an egg on it, being quite cold first. It must be well skimmed while boiling. Let them soak six days; then change the brine, let them stand six more; then drain them, and pour over them in a jar a pickle of the best white-wine vinegar, with a good quantity of pepper, t pimento, ginger, mace, cloves, mustard-seed,/an4-h©r9^ radish, all boiled together, but cold. To every hun- dred of walnuts put six spoonsful of mustard-seed and two or three heads of garlic or shalot, but the latter is least strong. This done they will be good for several years, if close covered. The air will soften them. They will not be fit to eat under six months. When the walnuts are used, boil up the pickle with half a pound of anchovies to a gallon, and a tea-spoonful of cayenne, and you will have a very good ketchup. TO PICKLE WALNUTS.—E. R. Gather the walnuts about the middle of July, and put them over the fire in salt and water. Let tliem lie until the outside can be rubbed off. Rub them with a cloth, and throw them into cold salt and water. Let them stand two or three days, changing the water every day. Boil double-distilled vinegar with spice, and pour it over them boiling hot in jars. / A*. r

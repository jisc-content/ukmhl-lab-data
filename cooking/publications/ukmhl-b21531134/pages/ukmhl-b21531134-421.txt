341 PICKLING. CUAP. XVII.] TO BOIL MUTTON IIAM^E. R. Put it on the fire in cold water, let it warm quickly, and allow it to boil only twenty minutes; then leave it in the pan of water till cold. This plan renders it moist, and answers when it is to be eaten cold. TO CURE TONGUES. Some persons like neatsâ€™ tongues cured with the whole root on, in which case they look much larger, ! but have not any other advantage, the latter being too hard to cut pleasantly when salted. If the root is to be removed, cut it off near the gullet, but without taking away the fat that is under the tongue. The root must be soaked in salt and water a night, and extreme- ly well cleaned before it be dressed, when it is very good stewed with gravy; or may be salted two days, and used for peas-soup. Having left the fat and a little of the kernel under the tongue, sprinkle it with salt and let it drain until next day. Then for each tongue mix a large spoonful of common salt, the same quantity of coarse sugar, and half as much saltpetre; rub it well in, and do so every day for a week ; then add another large spoonful of salt. If rubbed daily, a tongue will be ready in ten days; but if only turned in the pickle, it will not be too salt in four or five weeks, but should not be kept longer. When to be dried, write the date of the day on parchment, and tie it on. Smoke three days, or hang them in a dry place without smoking. When to be dressed, boil the tongue extremely tender; allow five hours, and if done sooner it is easily kept hot. The longer it is kept after smoking, the higher will be the flavour: if hard, it may require soaking four or five hours; but in the estimation of many persons, they are best dressed out of the pickle. ANOTHER WAY. Clean as above: for two tongues allow an ounce of saltpetre, and an ounce of sal-prunella; with which rub

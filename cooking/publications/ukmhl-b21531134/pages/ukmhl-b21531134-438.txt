Freshen them the day before they are to be used in warm water, changing the water more than once if necessary. MUSHROOMS DISGUISED AS TRUFFLES.—E. R. Take mushrooms of all sizes, peel and cut them into pieces the size of truffles. Put them into a stewpan over a slow fire with a little bit of butter, some salt, pepper, and mace ; let them stew until the liquor which flows from them is dried in again. Then lay them on tins in a slow oven, taking care that they do not remain long enough to grow hard. Keep them for use in can- vass- bags. TO PICKLE MUSHROOMS WHITE.—E. R.. Take the very small buttons, clean and rub them with a flannel, then put them into cold distilled vinegar, and allow it to come to a boil very slowly; drain and lay them in a cloth till cold, and then put them into fresh distilled vinegar. AN EXCELLENT WAY TO PICKLE MUSHROOMS, TO PRESERVE THE FL.YVOUR Buttons must be rubbed with a bit of flannel and salt, and from the larger take out the red inside; for when they are black they will not do, being too old. Throw a little salt over, and put them into a stewpan with some mace and pepper: as the liquor comes out, shake them well, and keep them over a gentle fire till all of it be dried into them again; then put as much vinegar into the pan as will cover them, give it one warm, and turn all into a glass or stone jar. They will keep two years, and are delicious. TO DRY MUSHROOMS. Wipe them clean; and of the large take out the brown, and peel off the skin. Lay them on paper to dry in a cool oven, and keep them in paper-bags, in a dry place.

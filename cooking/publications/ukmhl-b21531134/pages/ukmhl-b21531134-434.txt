[Chap. XVIII. DOMESTIC COOKERY. 354 TO PICKLE GOOSEBERRIES GREEN.—E. R. Take large green gooseberries, and cut them into four parts, but not to the bottom. Then take out the seeds, and string four together on a thread, giving them the appearance of an artichoke. Lay them in a strong brine of salt for twelve hours, take them out, and drain them quite dry : pour over them boiling vinegar with spice. A MELANGE.—E. R. As the spring advances, and the fruit-trees require thinning, take every kind that the garden produces, apricots, peaches, nectarines, plums, small apples, pears, &c., and throw them as they are gathered into a pan of cold vinegar: then collect also every sort of vegetable, gherkins, cucumbers cut into rings, nasturtiums, car- rots, French beans, cauliflowers in sprigs, and any- thing else that comes to hand, turnip-radishes, small onions, &c. &c. Throw all into the cold vinegar, and allow them to remain until September or October. Then to a gallon of vinegar put a quarter of a pound of black pepper, the same quantity of white ditto, the same- of ginger. Half a pound of yellow mustard-seed, one nutmeg grated, and a quarter of a pound of mixed spices, mace, allspice, and cloves, with five or six ounces of chilies, two or three sticks of horse-radish, two ounces of salt, and a quarter of a pound of flour of mustard mixed smoothly in some of the vinegar. Boil the whole together, and when cold cover it up. This will be found a most excellent pickle, and neither trou- blesome nor expensive where there is a garden. PICKALILLA.-E. R. Take a pound of ginger, let it lie in salt and water for a night, then scrape it; cut it in thin slices, put it into a bottle with dry salt, and allow it to stand till the other ingredients are ready. Take a pound of garlic.

The happy medium between injurious abstinence and injurious excess is unfortunately too seldom preserved; but there caimot be a doubt that light and nourishing food may be eaten, if the quantity be too large, with greater impunity than when its solid!tv renders it less easilv digestible. In England, cookery, in small respectable fa- milies, where it is necessary to study economy, has to contend with a prejudice concerning the vulgarity of certain viands—many portions of an animal, which in France are in great esteem, being rejected in this country upon very insufficient grounds. Vulgarity in eating can only be connected with grossness ; and sheep’s heads, shoulders of mutton, and even fat pork, may be so refined in the culinary process as to retain nothing offensive either to the eye or the palate, while the vulgarity must consist in the manner in which the viands are served and demolished, and not in the viands themselves.

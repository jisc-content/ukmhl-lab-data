Boil a pound of rice in a quart of broth until a small part of the centre of the grain alone remains hard, then strain it. Reserve a tea-cupful of the broth, and boil in it a scruple of saffron ; then strain it, and pour the broth thus coloured upon the rice. Set it near, not on, the fire, and stew it until the broth is absorbed by the rice. Koftahs must be served in a separate dish. MUTHA ZURDU.—E. R. Prepare the rice as in the foregoing receipt, only with water instead of broth, adding the saffron to the water, and mixing up in it, when thus coloured, two ounces of finely-powdered sugar.

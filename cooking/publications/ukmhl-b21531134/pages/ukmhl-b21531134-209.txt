Chap.V.] MADE DISHES- 129 BEEF A-LA-VINAIGRETTE. Cut a slice of underdone boiled beef three inches thick, and a little fat; stew it in half a pint of water, a glass of white (not sweet) wine, a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion, and a bay-leaf; season it with three cloves pounded, and pepper till the liquor is nearly wasted away, turning it once. When cold, serve it. Strain olf the gravy, and mix it with a little vinegar for sauce. ox CHEEK.—E. R. Soak half a head for three hours, and wash it very thoroughly; then put it into a stewpan, or into an earthen pan to bake, with two quarts of water, and let it simmer for eight hours with an onion stuck with cloves, a head of celery, a bundle of sweet herbs, and some whole pepper. When ready, take out the head, remove the meat from the bones, and cut it neatly, strain the gravy, remove all the fat, make some nice force- meat balls, and warm them with the meat and a part of the gravy, to which a glass of wine must be added. BEEF COLLAR.—E. R. Take the best part of a shin of beef, of which soup has been made, for it must be stewed until very tender, and an ox-tail, also well stewed; cut them into small pieces, season them well, add a glass of wine and a glass of ketchup, and put it into a stewpan covered with a part of the liquor in which the ox-tail has been boiled; stew it for about twenty minutes, and then put it into a mould. It must be very cold before it is turned out. This is a good way of employing the beef and heel when soup or jelly is made; a few chopped sweet herbs may be added, and hard eggs cut into slices, or pickles, such as sliced cucumbers, inter- mingled. The flavour may be varied in many ways. K

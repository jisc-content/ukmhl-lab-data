Take a fine fat pig of a month or five weeks old, pre- pared for the table; cut off the head and split the pig down the back, and bone it; chop a handful of sage very small, mix it with two nutmegs, and three or four blades of mace beaten fine; add to it a large handful of salt, and season the pig all over; roll it hard, tie it with tape, sew it in a clean linen cloth, and boil it in water with a little oatmeal and a good seasoning of salt; boil till very tender, which will take several hours. Hang it up in the cloth in which it was boiled until quite cold. Then make thin water-gruel of oatmeal; season it well with salt; add half a pint of white wine and half a spoonful of white pepper; boil it all together for half an hour; allow it to become cold; then take the cloth from the pig, and let it lie for eight days in this marinade. Eat it with mustard, sugar, and vinegar. THE MANNER OF CURING WILTSHIRE BACON; Sprinkle each flitch with salt, and let the blood drain off for twenty-four hours.

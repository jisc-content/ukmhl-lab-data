[Chap. V. 130 DOMESTIC COOKERY. FRICASSEE OF COLD ROAST BEEF. Cut very thin slices of underdone beef, shred a hand- ful of parsley very small, cut an onion into quarters, and put all together into a stewpan, with a piece of butter and some strong broth; season with salt and pepper, and simmer very gently a quarter of an hour; then mix into it the yolks of two eggs, a glass of port wine, and a spoonful of vinegar; stir it quick over the fire a minute or two, rub the dish with shalot, and turn the fricassee into it. HARICO OF BEEF TAILS.â€”E. R. Cut the tails in pieces, lay them^in a stewpan, with butter and a large onion ; set it over a smart fire to make them brown, peel and boil a couple of dozen of young button onions in about three pints of water, for fifteen or twenty minutes, set them by, and pour the liquor they were boiled in upon the tails, adding suf- ficient boiling water to cover them; put in six ounces of carrots, and eight of turnips, cut into slices or balls, the size of nutmegs; put in the carrots twenty minutes before the turnips. Be careful that they are not stewed too fast or too much. When they are tender, pass the gravy through a sieve; skim off the fat. Keep the meat and vegetables hot. Thicken the gravy by putting an ounce of butter into a stewpan; when melted, stir in as much flour as will stiffen it. Pour the gravy in by degrees, stirring it till it boils, strain it through a sieve into a stewpan, and let it simmer gently till the meat and vegetables are dished. Lay the tails round the dish, and the vegetables in the middle, pour the gravy over; minced gherkins or capers may be added. Pour boiling water over the onions to warm them, and put them round the dish the last thing. Rump steaks, veal cutlets, or mutton chops, may be di'essed the same way.

To a'pint of water put an ounce of isinglass, the rind of a lemon, and half a jx»und of lump-sugar; let it simmer for half an hour, and then strain it through a lawn-sieve ; when nearly cold, add the juice of three lemons and the white of one egg, whisk it until it is white and thick. In the summer it will require rather more isinglass. TRIFLE—E. K. Place at the bottom of the trifle-dish a layer of macaroons and ratafia-cakes, and pour over tliem as much sweet wine or brandy as they will absorb. Squeeze the juice of a lemon, and add it to a quart of cream not too thick : sweeten the cream with sugar rubbed upon the rind : add a little brandy and the white of an egg beaten to a froth. Whisk the mixture, and as the froth rises lay it on a sieve to drain : when enough' has been drained for the purpose, make a custard with the remaining cream and that which has drained from the froth; put it on a very slow fire with two laurel- leaves, and when nearly boiling take it off, and add the yolks of four eggs and the whites of two,—the number necessary for a pint of custard. Put it again on the fire, stirring slowly one way till it thickens, but taking care not to allow it to come to a boil. Cover the macaroons with raspberry or other jam, then pour on the custard; and when the custard is quite cold put on the froth, sprinkling harlequin comfits on the top, and garnishing with different-coloured sweet- meats. In some of the good old-fashioned receipts for trifle, a layer of calf’s-foot jelly is added to the others; but, should that be disapproved, it is necessary to state that " '<fie of the other ingredients should be omitted. Mo- /n trifles are often trifles indeed, merely consisting of a few cakes and a little froth.

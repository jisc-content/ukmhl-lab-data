In winter let the milk stand twenty-four hours, in the summer twelve, at least: then put the milk-pan on a hot hearth, if you have one: if not, set it in a wide brass kettle of water large enough to receive the pan. It must remain on the fire till quite hot, but on no ac- count boil, or there will be a skim instead of cream upon the milk. You will know when done enough by the undulations on the surface looking thick, and having a ring round the pan the size of the bottom. The time required to scald cream depends on the size of the pan and the heat of the fire : the slower the better. Re- move the pan into the dairy when done, and skim it next day. In cold weather it may stand thirty-six hours, and never less than two meals. The butter is usually made in Devonshire of cream thus prepared, and, if properly, it is very firm. BUTTERMILK, If made of sweet cream, is a delicious and most whole- some food. Those who can relish sour buttermilk find it still more light; and it is reckoned more beneficial in consumptive cases. Buttermilk, if not very sour, is also as good as cream to eat with fruit, if sweetened with white sugar and mixed with a very little milk. It likewise does equally for cakes and rice-puddings, and of course it is econo- mical to churn before the cream is too stale for any- thing but to feed pigs. TO REEF MILK AND CREAM. In hot weather, when it is difficult to preserve milk from becoming sour, and spoiling the cream, it may be kept perfectly sweet by scalding the new milk very gently without boiling, and setting it by in the earthen dish or pan that it is done in. This method is pursued

528 DOMESTIC COOKERY. rCHAP. XXIV. on these two particulars, hut more especially on the time it has been painted, and the goodness of the colours. It they have not been allowed sufficient space for becom- ing thoroughly hardened, a very little use will injure them; and, as they are very expensive articles, care in preserving them is necessary. It answers to keep them some time before they are used, either hung up in a dry barn where they will have air, or laid down in a spare room. When taken up for the winter, they should be rolled round a carpet-roller, and observe not to crack the paint by turning the edges in too suddenly.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. IX. 164 CHICKEN IN HASTE.-E. R. Take fresh-killed chickens, clean, cut them in pieces, and scald them in hot water, without giving them time to cool: fry them in butter with sweet herbs chopped, white pepper, and salt, then add some boiling water and flour; stew them until the sauce is reduced: strain, and add to the sauce a table-spoonful of cream, the yolk of an egg beaten, squeeze a little lemon-juice over the chickens, and serve them up. This dish will be useful when it is requisite to add to the dinner at a short notice; and if the chickens do not grow cool, they will he tender. FOWL WITH ONIONS.—E. It. Boil a dozen small onions in several waters, until the strength is out and they are tender; cut a piece of boiled pickled pork into dice ; take a spoonful of hot pickled vinegar, some sweet herbs chopped, and the yolk of an egg beaten; make this quite thick with herbs, mix it with the pork and onions, and then stuff the whole of the inside of a fowl: braise the fowl in a little broth and butter, and serve it up with white sauce. VOLAILLE EN FRITUR.—E. R. Take the remains of a cold fowl, bone it, cut it in pieces, and fry it in batter, or, if there he only a very small quantity, fry it without the hatter, with pieces of paste cut in oblong shapes. This is a most excellent and elegant way of dressing cold fowl. Place it round a dish, and fill up the centre with tomato, sorrel, or other sauce, made very hot and very acid. FOWL CUTLETS.—E. R. Cut up a fowl and hone it, make the legs, wings, breast, and merry-thought into six fine cutlets by flat- tening them and giving them a good shape; then take the meat from the remainder of the fowl, pound it in a mortar with pepper, salt, and a spoonful of gravy.

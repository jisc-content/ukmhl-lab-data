DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. VII. 152 upon toasted bread, brush the top with white of egg, put a bit of butter on it, and brown it with a salamander. GERMAN TOAST.—E. R. Take the remainder of any fricassee or ragout; any small quantity will do ; chop it finely, add a little chopped parsley, and a little bit of shalot or cbive : mix it up with one or two eggs beaten, according to the quantity. Put the whole with its gravy into a stewpan, and let it reduce and thicken on the fire. Let it remain until it is cold, then cut pieces of bread, toast them : lay the mixture thickly upon them. Boil an egg hard, cut it into small pieces, and stick them on the top; brush the whole with egg beaten up, sift bread- crumbs over, and bake them in the oven; squeeze a little lemon-juice on the top. This makes a good comer-dish. VEGETABLE TOAST.—E. R. Take any stewed vegetable, chop it if necessary : purees will not require chopping. Add a little more seasoning, mix it up with the yolk of an egg, and if too thin, reduce and thicken it over the fire, then spread it upon toast, brush it over with beaten egg, add bread- crumbs or vermicelli, and fry or bake them. KIDNEY TOAST.—E. R. Take a cold veal kidney, with a part of the fat, cut it into very small pieces; pound the fat in a mortar with a little salt, white pepper, and an onion previously boiled. Bind all together with the beaten whites of eggs. Heap it upon toast, cover the whole with the yolks beaten, dredge with bread-crumbs, and bake in the oven. HAM TOAST.—E. R. Grate or pound the cold ham: toast and butter a slice of bread; mix the ham with the yolk of an egg and a little cream, until it is thick and rich; warm it

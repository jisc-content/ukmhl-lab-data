[Chap. XVII, 33C DOMESTIC COOKERY. CHAPTER XVII. SALTING AND PICKLING. VVhen the pork is ready for salting, it should be sprinkled with a handful of common salt to fetch out the blood ; the brine thrown away on the following day, and the meat wiped with a dry cloth. Hams should be laid with the rind-side downwards; and it is a good plan to heat a quarter of a peck of common salt in a frying-pan and lay it at the bottom of the pan. A small quantity of saltpetre is necessary to produce the fine red colour either of ham or beef; but much will make the meat hard, and the proportions of sugar and salt should be varied according to the preference given to highly-salted provisions, or those which are cured with a milder sub- stitute. Skim-milk, or milk and water, will be found preferable to plain water for soaking hams; and they may also be boiled in milk and water. Where vegeta- bles are plentiful, it is desirable to boil ham with three heads of celery, a couple of turnips, half a dozen small onions, and a large bunch of sweet marjoram, thyme, &c., put in after the pot has been skimmed. These will extract the salt, and soften the meat: a piece of coarse fresh beef, in addition, will materially improve the ham, but the best way is to bake it. Send it to the oven in a deep pan, with half a pound of suet at the bottom, and half a pint of water.â€”E. R. TO DRESS HAMS. If long hung, and very hard, put the ham into water a night, and then let it lie either in a hole dug in the earth, or on stones sprinkled with Water, two or three days, to mellow, covering it with a heavy tub to'keep vermin from it. In either case let it be put into a linen bag, and carefully covered. Wash and brush it well; put it into a boiler of water, and let it simmer from three

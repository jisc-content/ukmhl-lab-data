Rub three table spoonsful of flour, smooth, by degrees into a pint of milk, strain it, and simmer it over the fire until it thickens; stir in two ounces of butter; when cool add the yolks of four eggs beaten and strained, and half a pound of currants washed and picked. Put the batter into a cloth w'ell buttered, tie it tight, and plunge it into boiling water, keep it in motion for five minutes, that it may be well mixed. SUET PUDDING. Shred a pound of suet; mix, with a pound and a quar- ter of flour, two eggs beaten separately, a little salt; and as little milk as will make it. ' Boil it four hours. * It eats well next day, cut in slices and broiled. The outward fat of loins or necks of mutton, finely shred, makes a more delicate pudding than suet; and both are far better for the purpose than butter, which causes the pudding to be black and close.

JELLIES. Chap. XXIV.] 501 peel: meanwhile grate some crumbs of bread. The moment the mixture boils up, keeping it still on the fire, put the crumbs in, and let it boil as fast as it can. "When of a proper thickness just to drink, take it off. ANOTHER. Make as above, hut, instead of a glass of wine, put in a tea-spoonful of rum, and a bit of butter; sugar as above. This is a most pleasant mess. ANOTHER. Put to the water a bit of lemon-peel, mix tne crumbs in, and, when nearly boiled enough, put some lemon or orange syrup. Observe to boil all the ingredients, for, if any be added after, the panada will break and not jelly. BREAD JELLY.—E. R. Take a penny-roll, pare off the crust, and cut the crumb into thin slices; toast them on both sides of a light pale brown. Put them into a quart of spring water, let it simmer gently over the fire until the liquid becomes a jelly, strain it through a thin cloth, and flavour it with a little lemon-juice and sugar, added when hot. If wine be permitted, it is an improvement. This jelly is of so strengthening a nature, that one tea- spoonful affords more nourishment than a tea-cupful of any other. It may be prepared without the lemon-juice and sugar, and a tea-spoonful put into every liquid the patient takes; such as tea, coffee, broth, &c. A RESTOR.\TIVE JELLY.—E. R. Take one ounce of rice, the same quantity of sago, pearl-barley, hartshorn-shavings, and eringo root, put them into three pints of water, and let it simmer till re- duced to one pint: then strain it off, and, when cold, put in a little wine or milk.

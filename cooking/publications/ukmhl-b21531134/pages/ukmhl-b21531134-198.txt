DOMESTIC COOKERY. 118 [Chap. IV. PIGS’-FEET A LA ST. MANCHAUD.—E. R. Clean tlie feet perfectly, cut them down in two, then hind them with a tape to prevent their shrinking or opening, and boil them gently until they are rather soft; take off the tape, dip them in yolks of eggs and butter about three parts melted; then cover them with crumbs of bread and finely minced parsley, with the smallest quantity of shalot. Broil them until highly browned. PETTITOES. Boil them, the liver, and the heart, in a small quan- tity of water very gently; then cut the meat fine, and simmer it with a little of the water and the feet split, till the feet are quite tender; thicken with a hit of butter, a little flour, a spoonful of cream, and a little salt and pepper : give it a boil up, pour it over a few sippets of bread, and put the feet on the mince. TO FORCE HOGS’-EARS. Parboil two pair of ears, or take some that have been soused; make a forcemeat of an anchovy, a little finely- minced veal, some sage, parsley, a quarter of a pound of suet chopped, bread-crumbs, pepper, and only a little salt. Mix all these with the yolks of two eggs; raise the skin of the upper side of the ears, and stuff them with the above. Fry the ears in fresh butter, of a fine colour, then pour away the fat, and drain them : make ready half a pint of rich gravy, with a glass of fine sherry, three tea-spoonsful of made mustard, a little bit of flour and butter, a small onion whole, and a little pepper or cayenne. Put these, with the ears, into a stewpan, and cover it close; stew it gently for half an hour, shaking the pan often. When done enough, take out the onion, place the ears carefully in a dish, and pour the sauce over them. If a larger dish is wanted, the meat from two feet may be taken from the bones and added to the above.

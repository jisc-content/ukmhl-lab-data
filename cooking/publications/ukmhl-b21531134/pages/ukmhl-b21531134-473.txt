PRESERVES. 393 Chap. -\1X.] TO DRY CHERRIES.—E. R. Weigh the clierries before they are stoned, and allow to every pound of fruit a quarter of a pound of lump- sugar ; when they are stoned set them over a slow fire to heat, then take them out of the^ liquor and put the sugar to them, and let them stand till it is dissolved. Then set them over the fire and let them just boil. Allow them to stand until they are quite cold, or, if more convenient, for two or three days in the syrup ; afterwards strain them, and spread them on sieves to dry, either on a stove or in the sun, or in an oven after the brown bread is drawn. TO DRY CHERRIES, No. 2.-E. R. For four pounds of cherries, stoned, allow one pound of sugar; dip the lumps into water in order to dissolve them, and when melted let it boil, then put the fruit in ; skim the liquor two or three times; then take them ofi’, and let them stand a day or two in the syrup; drain off the syrup and boil it again, and having poured it on the cherries, let them stand a day or two longer : then take them out and dry them on a sieve, either in the sun, or in a cool oven: when sufficiently dry, lay them in rows between paper, keeping them separate. TO DRY CHERRIES WITH SUG.-VR.—E. R.

The same syrup will do another six pounds of fruit. TO DRY CHERRIES WITHOUT SUO.VR.

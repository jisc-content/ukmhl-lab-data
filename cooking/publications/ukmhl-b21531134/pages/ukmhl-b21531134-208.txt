128 [Chap. V. DOMESTIC COOKERY. thicken the gravy with vegetables, and send it up. A brisket of beef, of ten pounds weight, when properly drawn in this manner, may be stewed with two gallons of water, added after the meat has yielded its gravy by slow simmering. The tops of the long ribs make good bouilli, simmered in a small quantity of water, and served on a bed of red cabbage, stewed separately, and flavoured with a glass of vinegar. BRISKET OF BEEF IN BOUILLI.—E. R. Take about nine pounds of the beef, tie it tightly with a tape, and put it into a stewpan, with just sufficient water to cover it: add onions, celery, a little parsley, and spice: allow it to boil gently, and, when about half done, add a large anchovy. Cut a small quantity of carrots, greens, and capers very fine; mix them with a part of the soup ; let them stew till tender, and then serve them with the beef, laying part on the top and the rest round. BEEF OLIVES.—E. R. Cut some handsome steaks, flatten them well with a roller, dredge them well with a small quantity of white pepper and salt, have some forcemeat made w'ith the fat and lean of veal mixed together, a small bit of lean ham or bacon, parsley, a few bread-crumbs, all beaten in a mortar, and mixed with an egg; lay a little over each steak, and roll them up tightly, fastening with a skewer; dip them in the yolk of egg, then in crumbs of bread, and fry them of a pale brown; dish them with brown sauce. BEEF OLIVE FRICANDEAU.—E. R. Take either slices of cold beef or of beef-steak cut rather thin; cover them with*'slices of fat bacon and chopped herbs, well seasoned, and moistened in vinegar, roll them up, skewer or tie them, fry them a little, and then stew them in gravy.

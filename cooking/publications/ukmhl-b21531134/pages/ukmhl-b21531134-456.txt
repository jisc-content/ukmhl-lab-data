DOMESTIC COOKERY. 376 [Chap. XVIII. bottle it, and secure the corks as above, leaving the spice in. At the end of three months strain the liquor and boil with fresh spice, which put into the bottles; and in a cool place it will keep two or three years. MUSHROOM KETCHUP, .\NOTHER WAY.

In two months boil it up again with a little fresh spice, and a stick of horse- radish, and it will then keep a year; which mushroom ketchup rarely does, if not boiled a second time. CHAPTER XIX. PRESERVES. OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES. Preserves should be kept carefully from the air, and in a very dry place. Unless they have a very small proportion of sugar, a warm one does not hurt, but when not properly boiled (that is, long enough, but not quick), hefit makes them ferment: and damp causes them to grow mouldy. They should be looked at two or three time^ in the first two months, that they may be gently boiled again if not likely to keep. It is necessary to observe, that the boiling of sugar more or less constitutes the chief art of the confectioner; and those who are not practised in this knowledge, and only preserve in a plain way for family use, are not

56 DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. II, TO COLLAR EELS.—E. R. Case the eels, cut off the head, split and take out the bone: lay the fish flat; season them with mixed spices, some parsley shred very fine, and a few chopped sage leaves; roll them up tightly in a cloth; bind it well; if the eels are of a middling size, boil them in salt and water for three-q^uarters of an hour: hang them up to dry all night. Add to the pickle a pint of vinegar or more, according to the quantity of eels collared, a few pepper-corns, and a sprig of sweet marjoram. Boil it ten minutes, and let it stand all night. Take the cloth from the eels, and put them into the pickle. They may be sent whole to table, or cut in slices. Gar- nish with parsley. Lampreys and pilchards may be dressed the same way. Eels, when collared, should not be skinned. TO STEW LAMPREY, AS AT WORCESTER.

Cover close : stew till tender, then take out the lamprey and keep hot, while you boil up the liquor with two or three anchovies chopped, and some flour and butter ; strain the gravy through a sieve, and add lemon- juice and some made mustard. Serve with sippets of bread and horse-radish. When there is spawn it must be fried and put round. Note.—Cider will do in common, instead of white wine. TO POT LAMPREY, AS AT WORCESTER. Leave the skin on, but remove the cartilage and a string on each side of it down the back. Wash and clean the fish very nicely in several waters, and wipe them. To a dozen of tolerable size use two ounces of white pepper, salt in proportion, six blades of mace, a dozen of cloves,

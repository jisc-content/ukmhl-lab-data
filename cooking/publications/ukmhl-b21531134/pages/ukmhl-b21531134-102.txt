When they are to be used, melt them in boiling water ; and if you wish the flavour of herbs, or anything else, boil it first, strain off the water, and melt the soup in it. This is very convenient in the country, or at sea, where fresh meat is not always at hand; as by this means a hasin of soup may be made in five minutes. , SAGO SOUP,—E. R.

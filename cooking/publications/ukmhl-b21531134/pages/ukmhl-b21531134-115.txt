45 Fisn. Chap II.] AN EXCELLENT DISH OF DRIED SALMON. Pull some into flakes ; have ready some eggs boiled hard and chopped large; put both into half a pint of thin cream, and two or three ounces of butter rubbed with a tea-spoonful of flour; skim it, and stir till boil- ing-hot; make a wall of mashed potatoes round the inner edge of a dish, and pour the above into it. TO rOT SALMON. Take a large piece, scale and wipe, hut do not wash it; salt very well; let it lie till the salt is melted and dmined from it, then season it with beaten mace, cloves, and whole pepper : lay in a few bay leaves, put it close into a pan, cover it over with butter, and bake it; when well done, drain it from the gravy, put it into the pots to keep, and, when cold, cover it with clarified butter. In this manner any firm fish may be done. COLLARED SALMON. Split such a part of the fish as may be sufficient to make a handsome roll, wash and wipe it, and having mixed salt, white pepper, pounded mace, and Jamaica pepper, in quantity to season it very high, rub it inside and out well. Then roll it tight and bandage it, put as much water and one-third vinegar as will cover it, with bay leaves, salt, and both sorts of pepper. Cover close, and simmer till done enough. Drain and boil quick the liquor, and put on when cold. Serve with fennel. It is an elegant dish, and extremely good. BOILED COD.-E. R. The finest portion of the cod, the head and shoulders and the middle, are not supposed to require foreign aid or sophistication to fit them for the table, but may be sent up simply boiled, with oyster-sauce ; the tail ma;/â€™ be boned, cut into pieces, floured and fried, or stewed, according to any of the receipts which will be given. Cod is occasionally cut into slices, and fried or broiled.

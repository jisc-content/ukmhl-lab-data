20 [Chap. I. DOMESTIC COOKERY. SOUP MAIGRE.—E. R. Take six ounces of butter, cut it into pieces, and put it into a stewpan. When melted, add three or four onions sliced, three or four heads of celery, two hands- ful of spinach, some cabbage, two or three turnips, par- sley, and other herbs. Stew all gently for about half an hour; then add two quarts of water; simmer till the vegetables are quite tender, and send up the soup with toasted bread, or the crumb of a French roll, cut in slices, at the bottom of the tureen. PEAS SOUP MAIGRE.—E. R. To a quart of whole or split peas put three quarts of water ; boil gently until the peas are dissolved, then pulp them through a sieve, and add three anchovies, or a red herring, carrots, turnips, leeks, thyme, and sweet marjoram, and stew them together. Before serving add some ketchup and salt, thicken the soup with butter, and send it up with fried bread. Frying the vegetables will make the soup richer. Fry any quantity in butter, then add two quarts of water, and stew till the vegetables are quite tender; strain the liquor, and add to the peas boiled separately, and pulped through a sieve ; serve with fried bread. GREEN PEAS SOUP MAIGRE.-E. R. Take a quart of old green peas, two sprigs of mint, and two quarts of water; boil all together until the peas are very soft; then pulp them through a sieve; put the liquor thus obtained in a stewpan, with a pint of young peas, two or three cucumbers cut into thick square pieces, and an onion or two, with three or four ounces of butter: melt the butter with a little flour, only sufficient to keep it from oiling, with some of the soup, and then add it to the remainder: the addi- tion of mushroom ketchup will give it a flavour of meat.

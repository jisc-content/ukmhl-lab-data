LIQUEURS. 465 Chap. XXII] a sieve; put it into a jar with eight pints of brandy and two of water; let it stand for a fortnight, shaking it frequently; strain it. Melt five pounds of sugar in three pints of water, mix it with the liquor and strain it. NECTAR.—E. R. Take two pounds of raisins chopped, and four pounds of loaf-sugar, and put them into a spigot-pot; pour two gallons of boiling water upon them. The next day, when it is cold, slice two lemons into it. Let it stand five days, stirring it twice a-day. Then let it stand five days more to clear; bottle it, put it into a cold cellar for ten days, and it will be fit to drink. SACK MEAD. To every gallon of water put four pounds of honey and boil it three-quarters of an hour, taking care to skim it. To every gallon add an ounce of hops; then boil it half an hour, and let it stand till next day: put it into your cask, and to thirteen gallons of the liquor add a quart of brandy. Let it be lightly stopped till the fer- mentation is over, and then stop it very close. If you make a large cask, keep it a year in cask. LEMONADE.—E. R. Pour a quart of boiling water on the rinds of six lemons, and let it stand for three or four hours; add the juice of eight lemons with three-quarters of a pound of sugar; simmer it well, and skim it; then add another quart of boiling water. Either run it through a jelly- bag, or mix a glass of calf’s-foot jelly, which will make it very rich. NEGUS.—E. R. One bottle of wine, half a pound of sugar, and a lemon sliced. Pour three quarts of boiling water upon this mixture, and grate nutmeg to the taste. 2 H

Butter which has become rank may be rendered palatable by another method:â€”Take the quantity wanted for immediate use, and put it into a pan of boiling water ; skim it off the top when melted, and it will be separated from the grosser particles, and become fit for use. B.ancid butter may also be melted in a saucepan, then thrown into cold water, and taken off when cold ; by repeating the process more than once, it will be purified. TO PRESERVE GAME WHICH IS LIKELY TO SPOIL. Pound a piece of charcoal, not very finely, and tie it up in thin muslin or gauze; put it inside a pheasant, hare, or partridge, and change the charcoal every day. It may also be placed upon venison with advantage. When game is very high, roast it with a muslin bag of charcoal in the interior, which must be carefully taken out before it is sent to table. If meat be turned, wash it perfectly clean, wipe it dry, and rub it over with charcoal, allowing it to Vemain for a day or two, then wash it clean ; dry and roast it. When game that is tainted is wanted immediately, prepare it for roasting, wrap it up well, or tie it in a linen bag; then take a fire shovel of hot charcoal, or live coal, throw it into a bucket of cold water; immerse the birds, hare, &c., for about five minutes, and then take them out; they will be per- fectly restored, but must be dressed directly. TO PRESERVE FISH FRESH FOR A DAY OR TWO. ^ Boil together three quarts of water and a pint of vinegar, in which, when quite boiling, put the fish, and just scald it, but not for more than two minutes. Then hang up the fish in a cool place, and it will dress as well as if fresh caught. AN EXCELLENT MIXTURE FOR CLEANING TIN, COPPER, AND BRASS ARTICLES. Two ounces of soft soap and a quarter of a pound of rotten-stone, beaten to a paste with boiling water.

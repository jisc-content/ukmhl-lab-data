•Chap. XX. DOMESTIC COOKERY. 418 pint of spring water; strain the isinglass, and, when nearly cold, have ready the grated rinds of two China and two Seville oranges, and the juice of four or five lemons; mix all together, strain through a sieve, and pour it in the mould. ORANGE JELLY—E. R. Peel twelve oranges very thin, and squeeze the juice over the rind; hut do not allow it to remain very long, as it will be disagreeably bitter : should the oranges be very sweet, add the juice of a Seville orange, or lemon. Dissolve two ounces of isinglass in as small a quantity of water as possible; melt half a pound of loaf-sugar, and, when the syrup and isinglass are cold, mix them with the juice, and strain them into the mould. The quantity of sugar requisite depends upon the sweetness of the oranges. FLOATING ISLAND. Mix three half-pints of thin cream with a quarter of a pint of raisin wine, a little lemon-juice, orange-flower water, and sugar: put into a dish for the middle of the table, and put on the cream a froth, which may he made of raspberry or currant jelly. ANOTHER WAY. Scald a codling before it be ripe, or any sharp apple; pulp it through a sieve. Beat the whites of two eggs with sugar and a spoonful of orange-flower W'ater; mix in by degrees the pulp, and beat together until you have a large quantity of froth; serve it on a raspberry cream ; or you may colour the froth wifh beet-root, raspberry or currant jelly, and set it on a white cream, having given it the flavour of lemon, sugar, and wine, as above : or put the froth on a custard. FLUMMERY. Put three large handsful of very small white oatmeal to steep a day and night in cold vvater; then pour it off

If there are no artichokes, a larger quan- tity of potatoes or a little rice may be added, or the soup may be made entirely of artichokes, omitting the potatoes. POTATO SOUP.—E. R. Take four large mealy potatoes; peel and cut them into small slices, with a little onion, boil them in three pints of water until tender, and then pulp them through a cullender; add a small piece of butter, a little cayenne pepper and salt, and just before the soup is served, two spoonsful of good cream. The soup must not be al- lowed to boil after the cream has been put into it. N.B.

When no more scum rises, and the broth appears clear, add the remainder of the water, and let it boil very gently for eight hours. Strain it through a hair-sieve into a large brown stone pan, skim off all the grease, and set it where it will cool quickly; next day pour it as quickly as possible into a three-gallon stewpan, taking care not to allow any of the settlings at the bottom of the pan to get into the stewpan, which is better than straining it. Let it boil as fast as possible in an uncovered stewpan, on a quick fire. Pour it into a three-quart stewpan, and if any scum rises take it off with the skimmer. Now

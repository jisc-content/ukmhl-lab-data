DOMESTIC COOKERY, [Chap. XXIV. 504 ANOTHER. Into a pint of fine gruel, not thick, put, while it is boiling-hot, the yolk of an egg beaten with sugar, and mixed with a large spoonful of cold water, a glass of wine and nutmeg. Mix by degrees. It is very agree able, and nourishing. Some like gruel, with a glass of table-beer, sugar, &c., with or without a tea-spoonful of brandy. COLD CAUDLE. Boil a quart of spring-water; when cold, add the yolk of an egg, the juice of a small lemon, six spoons- ful of sweet wine, sugar to your taste, and syrup of lemons one ounce. A FLOUR CAUDLE, Into five large spoonsful of the purest water rub smooth one dessert-spoonful of fine flour. Set over the fire five spoonsful of new milk, and put two bits of sugar into it: the moment it boils, pour into it the flour and water, and stir it over a slow fire twenty minutes. It is a nourishing and gently astringent food. This is an excellent food for babies who have weak bowels. RICK CAUDLE. When the water boils, pour into it some grated rice mixed with a little cold water; when of a proper con- sistence, add sugar, lemon-peel, and cinnamon, and a glass of brandy to a quart. Boil all smooth. ANOTHER.

Simmer ten minutes : if too thick, add a spoonful or two of milk; and serve with thin toas .

Cut a pound of fleshy beef in thin slices; simmer with a quart of water twenty minutes after it has once boiled and been skimmed. Season, if approved; but it has generally only salt. DR. RATCLIFFFS RESTORATIVE PORK JELLY, Take a leg of well-fed pork, just as cut up; beat it, and break the bone. Set it over a gentle fire with three gallons of water, and simmer to one. Let half an ounce of mace and the same of nutmegs stew in it. Strain through a fine sieve. When cold, take off the fat. Give a chocolate-cup the first and last thing and at noon, putting salt to taste. SHANK JELLY. Soak twelve shank of mutton four hours, then brush and scour them very clean. Lay them in a saucepan with three blades of mace, an onion, twenty Jamaica and thirty or forty black peppers, a bunch of sweet herbs, and a crust of bread made very brown by toasting. Pour three quarts of water to them, and set them on a hot hearth close covered; let them simmer as gently as possible for five hours, then strain it off, and put it in a cold place. This may have the addition of a pound of beef, if ap- proved, for flavour. It is a remarkably good thing for people vvho are weak.

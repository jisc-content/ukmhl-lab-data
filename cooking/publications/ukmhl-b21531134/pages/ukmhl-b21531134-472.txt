They are pretty for a dessert. GOO.SEBKRKY CHEESE.—K. R. Gather the rough red gooseberries when quite ripe ; hake them until they are a perfect mash; pass them through a hair-sieve, then put them into a preserving- pan, and boil them gently. To every pound of goose- berries put three ounces of sugar, which should be strewed in every now and then, a little at a time. It will take several hours to boil, in order to obtain the pi’oper thickness. TO DRY GOOSEBERRIES.—E. R. Put five pounds of gooseberries into a stewpan and strew over them one pound of sugar; set them on a slow fire; when the syrup begins to come out take them off; scald them in this way for two or three days, then take them out of the syrup, place them upon sieves, and put them before the fire or in the sun to dry. They may be dipped into powdered white sugar when taken out of the syrup, and thus candied. They should be laid between paper in tin boxes when put by for use. TO DRY C.OO.SEBERRIES, No. 2.—E. R. Add as much water to a pound of powdered sugar as will dissolve it, boil it for a few minutes, and skim it; then add seven pounds of gooseberries, scald them in the syrup, but do not let them boil or be very hot at first; scald them three or four times, making them hotter each time, and allowing them to grow cold between every scalding. The last time let them boil well. Take them out of the syrup whilst hot, and lay them upon hair-sieves to dry. When they are turned, which must he twice at least, dredge a little sugar over them.

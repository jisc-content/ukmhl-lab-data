Chap. XVIII.] KETCHUP. 375 malt: stir it well; let it infuse the usual time, and draw the wort olf as in brewing; but neither boil nor put hops. Work it with yest; and in two days tun it and put the barrel in the sun, with a bit of glass over the bung-hole. Observe, that as there must be enough to fill the cask, some little quantity of water must be allowed for waste. It must be brewed in February, and will be excellent in July, and fit for pickles. LOBSTER S.\UCE.—E. R. Pound the meat from three lobsters, with an ounce of mace, half an ounce of cloves dried and pounded, a nutmeg grated, a handful of salt, the rind of a lemon grated, and twenty anchovies pounded. Mix and pound these ingredients all together with a bottle of madeira, shake it well, and cork it very tight; one or two tea- spoonsful according to the quantity of butter melted will be enough. It must be kept very closely stopped. MUSHROOM KETCHUP.—E. R. Take the full-grown flaps of mushrooms, crush them with the hands, throw a handful of salt into every peck of mushrooms, and let them stand all night; then put them into stewpans, and set them in a quick oven for twelve hours; strain them through a hair-sieve, and press out all the juice. To every gallon of liquor put of cloves, Jamaica and black pepper, and ginger, one ounce each, and half a pound of common salt. Set it on a slow fire, and let it boil until half the liquor is wasted, then put it into a clean vessel, and, when cold, bottle it. MUSHROOM KETCHUP. Take the largest broad mushrooms, break them into an earthen pan, strew salt over, and stir them now and then for three days. Then let them stand for twelve, till there is a thick scum over: strain, and boil the liquor with Jamaica and black peppers, mace, finger, a clove or two, and some mustard-seed. When cold.

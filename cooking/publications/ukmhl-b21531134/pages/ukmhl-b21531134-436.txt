Make a brine of salt and water strong enough to bear an egg. To two quarts of brine put in a pint of white-wine vinegar, and half a pound of brown sugar; boil all together with the loose barberries, and let it stand till it is cold. Observe, they must not be allowed to boil long. Strain this liquor, and pour it upon the barberries in bunches, and tie them up closely in the jars. TO PICKLE L.ARGE ONIONS.—E. R. Slice large onions, and sprinkle them with salt. To every gallon take about a dozen capsicums, either dry or green, slicing only a part; add a few cloves, some pepper, and allspice, all w'hole. Put the onions into jars, distribute the spices pretty equally among them ; fill up the jars with vinegar and set them in a pan of cold water over the fire, taking care that they are closely tied down with a bladder: keep a wet cloth over them to prevent the bladder from bursting. In about an hour and a half the onions will be soft enough. Large cucumbers, gherkins, or small onions, may be pickled the same way: the cucumbers must lie all night in the salt, and the gherkins and small onions are to be pickled whole. TO PICKLE ONIONS.—E. R. Take the small silver onions, take off the outside skin, the tops and fibres, boil a strong brine, and, when cooled a little, pour it upon the onions; allow them to stand four hours covered, then strain them from the brine, peel off another skin, and then boil vinegar with ginger and pepper; pour it on the onions wh^en the steam has subsided.

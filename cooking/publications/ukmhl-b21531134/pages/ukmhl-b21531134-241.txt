('hap. IX.] 161 POULTUY POUL.^RD A LA ROYALE.—E. R. Bone the fowl and stuff it with sweetbread, liver, , and mushrooms well seasoned and made into a ragout. Sew up the fowl; cover it with thin slices of lard or bacon, and either tie paper over it and roast it or put it to braise ; if roasted, take off the lard and paper, be- fore serving, to brown it. Send it up on a puree of chestnuts. A turkey poult may be dressed the same way. DAVENPORT FOWLS. Hang young fowls a night; take the livers, hearts, and tenderest parts of the gizzards, the last being pre- viously boiled, shred very small, with half a handful of young clary, an anchovy to each fowl, an onion, and the yolks of four eggs boiled hard, with pepper, salt, and mace to your taste. Stuff the fowls with this, ancl sew up the vents and necks quite close, that the water may not get in. Boil them in salt and water till almost done; then drain them, and put them into a stewpan with butter enough to brown them. Serve with a good deal of melted butter, with either soy or ketchup in it. CHICKENS A LA CARMELITE.—E. R. Put a piece of butter the size of a walnut into a stewpan : as it melts, dredge in flour, and when the whole is well mixed add a tea-cupful of milk. Cut up the chickens and put them in, adding peppercorns, an onion, and a blacle of mace. Stew them until ten- der, adding milk and water if too dry. Take out the chickens; have some parsley ready boiled and chopped ; mix it with lemon-juice and a little white pep- per ; lay it upon the chickens.; strain and thicken the sauce; add a glass of white wine ; and send it to table garnished with chopped parsley and lemon or pickles. TO BROIL A FOWL.—E. R. Split the fowl down the back ; season it very well with pepper, and put it on the gridiron with the inner part next the fire, wliich must be very clear. Hold M

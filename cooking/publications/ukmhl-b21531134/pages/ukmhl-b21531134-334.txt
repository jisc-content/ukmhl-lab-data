DOMESTIC COOKERY. I,CHAP. XIII. 254 sugar in the water. Serve with scalded mint chopped â€”put a piece of butter to the peas after they are taken up. TO BOIL ASPARAGUS. Cut the white stalk off about six inches from the nead; throw them in cold water, and after soaking, tie them in small bundles, and boil them rather quick : if overdone the heads will be broken. Toast a slice of bread very brown on both sides; and when the aspara- gus is done, take it veiy carefully up, dip the toast quickly in the water, and lay the asparagus upon it, leaving the white ends outwards each way; and pour melted butter over the toast and green parts. ASP.ARAGUS FORCED. Cut a piece out of the top of three French rolls; take out all the crumb; do not enlarge the opening, or the crust will not exactly fit again. Fry the rolls brown, in fresh butter: have ready a pint of cream, the yolks of six eggs well beaten, a little salt and nutmeg. Stir this mixture over a .slow fire until it thickens. Boil a hundred of small asparagus : save tops enough to stick the tops of the rolls with, cut the remainder of the green part of the grass small: put it into the cream, and fill the rolls with it hot. Before the rolls are fried, make a few holes in the pieces of crust cut off, and stick the tops in. This is for a side-dish in a second course. TO DRESS ARTICHOKES. Trim a few of the outside leaves off, and cut the stalk even. If young, half an hour will boil them. They are better for being gathered two or three days first. Serve them with melted butter in as many small cups as there are artichokes to help with each, having clipped off the sharp points of the leaves.

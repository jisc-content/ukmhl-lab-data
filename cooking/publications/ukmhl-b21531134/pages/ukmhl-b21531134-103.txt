Let it stew gently for half an hour ; when nearly done put half a pound of dried French plums into the soup, take away the beef, and serve the fowl separately. CHERRY SOITP.—E. R, Stalk the cherries, put them on to stew, but be care- ful not to break them; cut slices of bread, fry them, put them into a deep dish, and pour the cherries on the top. Serve hot. WINE SOUP.—E. R. Take a pint of white wine, and a pint and a half of water, sweeten it to the taste with white sugar, fry one large table-spoonful of flour with a piece of butter until it is very brown, then pour the wine and water upon it, and hoil it a few minutes with lemon-peel and cinna- mon. Then take the yolks of six eggs, beat them well, and add the boiling soup, very slowly, stirring it well all the time, that it may not curdle; put a little toasted bread, cut very fine, into the soup, and serve it up hot. BERLIN MILK SOUP.—E. R. Put about six table-spoonsful of flour in a frying-pan upon a slow fii’e, stirring it about that it may not get lumpy. Boil three pints of milk, with a piece of lemon- peel, two or three lumps of sugar, and a stick of cinna- mon ; strain it, and mix the flour with the milk, adding a pint of water ; boil the whole together, and serve it up with bread cut into various shapes, and fried. This is a favourite soup in many parts of Germany, and has been introduced into England by a Prussian family with great success ; it should be of a pale brown colour. D

[Chap. XVIII 370 DOMESTIC COOKERY. white peppercorns; let it stand until cold, and then bottle it. WALNUT KETCHUP OF THE FINEST QUALITY. Boil or simmer a gallon of the expressed juice of wal- nuts when they are tender, and skim it well; then put in two pounds of anchovies, bones, and liquor, ditto of shalots, one ounce of cloves, ditto of mace, ditto of pepper, and one clove of garlic. Let all simmer till the shalots sink; then put the liquor into a pan till cold ; bottle, and divide the spice to each. Cork closely, and tie the bladder over. It will keep twenty years in the greatest perfection, but is not fit for use the first year. Be very careful to express the juice at home; for it is generally adul terated, if bought. Some people make liquor of the outside shell, when the nut is ripe; but neither the flavour nor colour is then so fine ; and the shells being generally taken off by dirty hands, there is much objection to this mode. WALNUT KETCHUP.—E. R. Take two hundred walnuts at the season for pickling, beat them very small on a marble mortar, add about six handsful of salt; put them into a clean earthen pan, and stir them two or three times a day, for ten days, or a fortnight. Then strain them through a cloth, pressing them very dry. Then boil up the liquor with mace, cloves, sliced nutmeg, and whole pepper. When nearly done, add six cloves of shalot; bottle and cork it closely. The bottle should be shaken when the ketchup is used. CAMP KETCHUP.—E. R. Take two quarts of old strong beer, and one of white wine, add a quarter of a pound of anchovies, three ounces of shalots peeled, half an ounce of mace, the same of nutmeg, three large races of ginger cut in slices; put all together over a moderate fire till one third is wasted. The next day bottle it with the spice and the shalots. It will keep for many years. "

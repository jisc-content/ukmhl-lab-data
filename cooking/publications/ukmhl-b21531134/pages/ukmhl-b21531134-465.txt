Put ' the fruit into an icepot that shuts very close ; throw tlie * sugar over it, and then cover the fruit with brandy. I ]>etween the top and cover of the pot put a piece of b double cap-paper. Set the pot into a saucepan of water I till the brandy be as hot as you can possibly bear to put I your finger in, but it must not boil. Put the fruit into I a jar, and pour the brandy on it.

Take fourteen pounds of loaf-sugar, clarify it, and make a light syrup of it; then put half in an earthen pan, and the other half in the brass preserving-pan upon the fire ; skim it well, and, when it begins to boil, put the peaches, which must be ripe, one by one into it; turn them with a spoon so that they may all boil equally; press them a little to discover whether they are rather ' soft, and, as they become so, take them out, and put them into the earthen pan with the other half of the sugar; then take them out, put them in jars, and pour brandy upon them to'harden them; then put the brass pan upon the fire again with a little more than a pint of water to make the syrup thinner, and when it begins to boil put in more peaches as before, until all, to the amount of a hundred, are boiled, the syrup being suf- ficient for that number. When the whole have been I put into jars, mix the syrup from the earthen pan with that in the preserving-pan, and boil it until it becomes as thick as a conserve; then take it off the fire, and put to it rather more than a pint of brandy, stirring it well together, and boiling to syrup; then pour out the brandy in which the peaches were put; measure it, and put an equal quantity of syrup to it; mix both well together, and fill uji the jars.

MEAT. Chaf.III,] 79 All meats should be well washed, and cleaned with a I brush kept for the purpose, before they are dressed. I If for boiling, the colour will be better for soaking an I hour or two; but if to be roasted, let it be dried after j washing. I Boiling in a well-floured cloth will make meat I white. Cloths for this purpose should be carefully I washed, and boiled in clean water between each using, I and not suffered to hang in a damp place, which would j give a bad flavour to the meat. The same observe of I tapes and pudding-cloths. All kitchen utensils should , be kept in the nicest order, and in a conspicuous part of the offices. Particular care must be taken that the pot is well i skimmed the moment it boils, otherwise the foulness I will he dispersed over the meat. The more soups or , broth are skimmed, the better and cleaner they will be. Vegetables should never be dressed with meat, except , carrots or parsneps with boiled beef. Old meats do not require so much dressing as young; not that they are sooner done, but they can be eaten with the gravy more in. In preparing meat for roasting, the cook must be I careful that the spit be wiped before it is used, and at I the time of serving, or its mark will appear in a black stain. She must avoid running the spit through the prime parts. In some joints, as necks, it may enter two bones from the end, run up the back until it comes 1 to nearly the other end, and the prime of the meat will not be pierced. Leaden skewers of different weights should be in readiness, for want of which un- skilful servants are often at a loss at the time of spitting. Cradle-spits answer best; they may be bought of dif- ferent sizes. The joints of all necks and loins should be nicked before they are dressed. Time, distance, basting often, and a clear fire of a proper size for what is required, are the first points of a good cookâ€™s attention in roiisting. A piece of writing paper should be twisted round

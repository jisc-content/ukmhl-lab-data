Put into a large china jar the following ingredients in layers, with bay-salt strewed between the layers:— two pecks of damask-roses, part in buds and part blown; violets, orange-flowers, and jasmine, a handful of each; orris-root sliced, benjamin, and storax, two ounces of each; a quarter of an ounce of musk ; a quarter of a pound of angelica-root sliced; a quart of the red parts of clove-gillyflowers; twohandsfulof lavender-flowers; half a handful of rosemary-flowers; bay and laurel leaves, half a handful of each; three Seville oranges, stuck as full of cloves as possible, dried in a cool oven, and pounded; half a handful of knotted marjoram; and two handsful of balm of Gilead dried. Cover all quite close. When the pot is uncovered, the perfume is very fine. A QUICKER SORT OF SWEET POT. Take three handsful of orange-flowers, three of clove- gillyflowers, three of damask roses, one of knotted mar- joram, one of lemon-thyme, six bay-leaves, a handful of rosemary, one of myrtle, half one of mint, one of lavender, the rind of a lemon, and a quarter of an ounce of cloves. Chop all, and put them in layers, with pounded bay-salt between, up to the top of the jar. If all the ingredients cannot be got at once, put them in as you get them; always throwing in salt with every new article.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 480 [Chap. XXIII. When the family is absent, or there is not a great call for cream, a careful dairy-maid seizes the oppor- tunity to provide for a winter store: she should have a hook to keep an account, or get some one to write down for her the produce of every week, and set down what butter she pots.

Those who direct a dairy in a gentle- manâ€™s family should consider in which way it can be managed to the best advantage. Even witLfew cows, cheese of value may be made from a toleraMfe pasture,

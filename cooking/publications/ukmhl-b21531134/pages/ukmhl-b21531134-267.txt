Bone a small rump or piece of sirloin of beef, or a fixt loin of mutton, after hanging several days. Beat it very well with a rolling-pin; then rub ten pounds of meat with four ounces of sugar, and pour over it a glass of port, and the same of vinegar. Let it lie five days and nights ; w'ash and wipe the meat very dry, and sea- son it very high with pepper, Jamaica pepper, nutmeg, and salt. Lay it in your dish, and to ten pounds put one pound or near of butter; spread it over the meat. Put a crust round the edges and cover with a thick one, or it will be overdone before the meat be soaked; it must be done in a slow oven. Set the bones in a pan in the oven, with no more water than will cover them, and one glass of port, a little pepper and salt, that you may have a little rich gravy, to add to the pasty when drawn. Note.—Sugar gives a greater shortness and better flavour to meats than salt, too great a quantity of which hardens, and it is quite as great a preservative, except from the fly. MUTTON PIE.—E. R. Cut the mutton into small pieces, season it very well, and stew it with the fat or suet also cut in pieces, putting in no water. When tender allow it to remain until cold; remove all the grease and fat very carefully ; have some gravy made from the bones, add to it the strained gravy from the mutton and a glass of port wine; put it into a dish or into small pattypans, and bake it. Observation,—A single particle of grease will spoil a pie, and mutton pie especially. VEGETABLE PIE. Scald and blanch some broad beans; cut young car- rots, turnips, artichoke-bottoms, mushrooms, onions

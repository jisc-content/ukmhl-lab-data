PREFACE. IX viz., saccharine, oily, and albuminous substances, the most perfect specimens of which are respect- ively sugar, butter, and white of egg. The sac- charine principle, in its most extended sense, in- cludes all those substances which are chiefly derived from the vegetable kingdom. A perfect know- ledge of these principles forms the basis of French cookery. In France,” continues the reviewer, “ most substances are exposed through the me- dium of oil or butter to a temperature of 600 Fahrenheit by the operation of frying, or some analogous process. They are then introduced into a macerating vessel with a little water, and kept for several hours at a temperature below the boiling point, 212", not perhaps higher than 180°; and by these united processes, properly con- ducted, the most refractory articles, whether of animal or vegetable origin, are more or less re- duced to a state of pulp, and admirably adapted for the further action of the stomach. In the common cookery of this country, on the contrary, articles are usually put at once into a large quan- tity of water, and submitted, without care or at- tention, to the boiling temperature : the conse- quence is, that most animal substances, when taken out, are harder and more indigestible than in the natural state; for it is well known that albuminous substances, as for example the white of an egg, become the harder the more they are boiled. These observations are often of the utmost

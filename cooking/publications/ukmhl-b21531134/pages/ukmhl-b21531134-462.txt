Having pared the apricots, thrust out the stones, with a skewer, and take the same weight of loaf-sugar as of fruit; strew a part of the sugar over the apricots, and let them stand until next day; then boil them up gently three or four different times, adding the kernels to the syrup. Let them cool between each boiling, then take them out of the syrup carefully one by one : boil the syrup with all the sugar: skim it carefully, then pour it over the apricots, and tie them down close with a brandy-paper and bladder. A BEAUTIFUL PRESERVE OF APRICOTS. When ripe, choose the finest apricots; pare them as thin as possible, and weigh them. Lay them in halves on dishes, with the hollow part upwards. Have^ ready an equal weight of good loaf-sugar, finely pounded, and strew it over them ; in the mean time break the stones, and blanch the kernels. When the fruit has lain twelve hours, put it, with the sugar and juice, and also the kernels, into a preserving-pan. Let it simmer very gently till clear; then take out the pfeces of apricots singly as they become so; put them into small pots, and pour the syrup and kernels over them. The scum must be taken off as it rises. Cover with brandy-papei TO PRESERVE APRICOTS IN JELLY.

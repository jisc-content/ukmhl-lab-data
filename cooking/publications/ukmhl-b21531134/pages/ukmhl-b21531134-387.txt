SAUCES. 307 CHiP, XVI.] mical will always contrive to procure the basis of these sauces in the manner pointed out in various parts of this volume. Where a calf’s-head or a breast of veal IS stewed, nothing more will be required; as both will yield an abundant supply, and it will only be necessary to give it the proper flavour with ham, or beef bone, &c. Gravy may be made quite as good of the skirts of beef, kidney, or milt, or of the liver of a fat ox, as of any other kind of meat, if cut in pieces, fried with onions, and seasoned with herbs and spices, as other gravies. Gravy may also be made of the knuckle of dressed mutton, if much be not required. The bones and pieces of meat cut off to make joints appear well, called trimmings, as likewise those of fowls, may be made by a skilful cook to answer the same purpose. All the shank-bones of legs and shoulders of mutton should be thrown into water, and, after good soaking and brushing, he long boiled; the water in which they are done will add greatly to the richness of gravy, as does the jelly of cow-heels. The latter must lie all night in water, which causes the jelly to be of a good colour. When boiled three hours, and become cold, let the fat be carefully taken off; and when apparently quite clear, lay some white paper upon it, rubbing it close with a spoon, which will remove every particle of grease, and it will be as pure as the jelly of calf’s- foot. Tarragon and knotted marjoram, by some called London thyme, give the flavour of French cookery, and are a great improvement to gravies; hut should be added only a short time before serving. Truffles and morels thicken and improve the flavour of gravies and soups: half an ounce being carefully washed of each, simmer them in a pint of water and add the whole.

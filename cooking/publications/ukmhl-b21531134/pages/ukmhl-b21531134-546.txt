466 [Chap. XXII. DOMESTIC COOKERY. EXCELLENT NEGUS.—E- R. Pour two quarts of boiling water upon three ounces of pearl-barley, a quarter of a pound of sugar, and a lemon sliced. When cold, strain the liquor and add a pint of wine and a glass, of brandy. PINE LliMONADE.—E. R. Take the juice of four lemons and the rinds of three pared very thin, half a pound of lump-sugar, half a pint of sherry, and one quart of boiling water. Let it stand all night covered close; boil half a pint of new milk, pour it hot into the lemonade, and run it through a jelly- bag until it is quite clear. BARLEY WATER.-E. R. One ounce of pearl-barley, half an ounce of white sugar, and the rind of a lemon, put into a jug. Pour upon it a quart of boiling water, and let it stand for eight or ten hours ; then strain off the liquor, adding a slice of lemon, if dosirable. This infusion makes a most delicious and nutritious beverage, and will be grateful to persons who cannot drink the horrid decoc- tion usually given. It is an admirable basis for lemon- ade, negus, or weak punch, a glass of rum being the proportion for a quart. BARLEY W.ATER WITH HONEY.—E. R. Add the juice and rind of one lemon to a table-spoon- ful of honey and two tea-cupsful of barley; put it into a jug and pour a quart of boiling water upon it. BARLEY WATER WITH ISINGLASS.—E. R. A table-spoonful of pearl-barley, six lumps of loaf sugar, half a lemon, and enough isinglass to clear it. Pour two quarts of boiling spring water on those ingre- dients, and let it stand until cold.

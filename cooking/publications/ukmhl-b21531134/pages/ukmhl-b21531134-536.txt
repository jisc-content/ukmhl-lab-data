456 DOMESTIC COOKERY. [Chap. .KXl flour, six ounces of lump-sugar sifted, half a nutmeg, a tea-spoonful of sifted ginger, and a large spoonful of caraway-seeds, and, after mixing, work them well into the butter; beat it half an hour; then add a large wine- glass of sherry. Bake in tin pattypans, in a moderately quick oven. RUSKS. Beat seven eggs well, and mix with half a pint of new milk, in which have been melted four ounces of butter; add to it a quarter of a pint of yest and three ounces of sugar, and put them, by degrees, into as much flour as will make a tjcry light paste, rather like a batter, and let it rise before the fire half an hour: then add some more flour to make a little stiffer, but not stiff. Work it well, and divide it into small loaves, or cakes, about five or six inches wide, and flatten them. When baked, and cold, slice them the thickness of rusks, and put them in the oven to brown a little. Note.â€”The cakes, when first baked, eat deliciously buttered for tea; or, with caraways, to eat cold. TO MAKE YEST. Thicken two quarts of water with fine flour, about three spoonsful; boil half an hour, sweeten with near half a pound of brown sugar ; when near cold, put into it four spoonsful of fresh yest in a jug, shake it well together, and let it stand one day to ferment near the fire, without being covered. There will be a thin liquor on the top, which must be poured off; shake the re- mainder, and cork it up for use. Take always four spoonsful of the old to ferment the next quantity, keep- ing it always in succession. A half-peck loaf will require about a gill. ANOTHER WAY. Boil one pound of potatoes to a mash; when half cold add a cupful of yest, and mix it well.

Grate off the outer portion of the citron; then I quarter them, remove the seeds, and put the juice and I pulp aside. Then boil the skins first in water, and , afterwards in sugar and water, until they are quite I tender; then cut them into very small pieces. Take 1 an equal weight of sugar with the juice and pulp, boil it together with the shred skins until it will jelly on a plate, and put it into jars. PU.MMELO OR SHAnnOCK PRESERVED.—E. R. Cut off, paring very thin, the outer portion; then quarter the fruit; take out all the inside, and boil the I peel in two or three waters to take off the bitter; I then boil it in syrup or sugar and water; then in a thicker syrup, boiling it three or four times, and allowing it to cool between each. When it is very I tender, and the last sugar has candied in tlie pan, j powder sugar over it, and place each piece separately on a large dish to dry in the sun; and when quite cold,, wrap them up in separate papers, and put them into a ' glass jar for use. — The outer peel, steeped in brandy, makes a I very fine bitter. TO PRESERVE LIMES IN SYRUP.—E. R. Gather the limes when nearly ripe, but quite green, I scrape them gently, and put each lime into water as it is scraped ; then prick them well with a large needle, and lay them upon towels to prevent their being bruised. Then steep them in water for a few hours ; afterwards put them into a stewpan covered with water, adding a little alum, and close the vessel. Boil them over a brisk and clear fire for a quarter of an hour. Take the juice of ten ripe limes, or of some citrons, in propor- tion to the quantity required for sixty green limes, and put it into the stewpan, when the latter begin to boil.

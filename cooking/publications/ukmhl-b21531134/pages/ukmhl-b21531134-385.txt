Strain it, and put in the tamarinds, let them remain for a few minutes on the fire, then take the pan off, and put them with the syrup into jars well covered. In the course of a short time a thick crust will appear on the top of the jar, which will exclude all the air, and preserve the tamarinds good for a long time if not disturbed. The tamarinds should be selected of the finest red, and gathered before they are ripe, otherwise they will be stringy, scarcely any pulp left, and the seeds difficult to extract. Care should be taken not to allow the tamarinds to remain long in any brass or copper vessel. The syrup should be thick at first, because the juice from the tamarinds will speedily thin it. HYBISCUS JAM.—E. R. Pare off the upper part of the fruit, and cut the seed from the lower or stem part; to each seer (two pounds) of fruit add a breakfiist-cupful of water. Put the whole into a stone jar, boil it in a kettle of water for four or five hours, take it out, weigh it, add an equal weight of sugar, and boil until it will jelly. Hibiscus jelly is made the same way, only the juice must be strained be- fore the sugar is added. CORUNDA JAM—E. R. Put the fruit into a jar, and boil it in a kettle of water until all the juice is expressed; then add an equal weight of sugar, and boil it until it will jelly, which will be shown by putting a little out upon a plate. Country gooseberries may be made into jam exactly the same way and make excellent jam, when care is taken to pre- serve them with sugar alone, and not to mix up any epice, which spoils them. TO PRESERVE PINE APPLES.—E. R. Gather the pines when half grown, of the Antigua sort, with small tops, if preferable. With a sharp knife X

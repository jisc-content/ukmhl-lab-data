43 MERTS AND BN TREES. _ — Jules CSoufFe’s instructions for Beeuf a la Mode. Take about 4 lbs. of thick beef steak cut square. Lard the meat and place it in a stewpan, with rather less than a pint of white wine, a pint of stock, a pint of cold water, two calves’ feet already boned and blanched, and 2 or 3 slices of bacon. Put it on the fire, adding about J oz. salt, and skim as for a pot-au- feu. Next, having skimmed it, add fully 1 lb. carrots, 1 onion, 3 cloves, 1 faggot herbs, and 2 pinches pepper. Place stewpan on corner of stove, cover it, and allow it to simmer very gently for 4 or 5 hours at least. Try the meat with a skewer to ascertain when it is sufficiently cooked, then put it on a dish with the carrots and the calves’ feet, and keep them covered up hot until serving. Next strain the gravy, remove carefully every atom of grease and reduce it over the fire about a quarter. Lastly, place the beef on the dish for serving. Add the calves’ feet (each having been cut in 8 pieces), the carrots cut into pieces the size of a cork, and 10 glazed onions. Arrange the calves’ feet, onions and carrots round the beef. Pour the sauce over the meat, keeping the surplus for the next day. Taste it to ascertain if sufficiently seasoned. Mrs. A. M‘William, 221 Upperthorpe, Sheffield.

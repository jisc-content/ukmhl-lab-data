Cut a dozen small blocks out of a good piece of cooked salmon. Lay the pieces in even rows on a shallow tin; the edge must come slightly above the salmon. Cover them completely with well-flavoured aspic, and set. When quite stiff, cut out each block, surrounded by a coating of aspic. Put a little salad in a dozen ramakin cases, lay one block in each case, and serve. Miss Ross Macdonald, “Home” School of Cookery, 175 Queen’s Drive, Crosshill. SALMON MOULD. 1 1 '. cold salmon.

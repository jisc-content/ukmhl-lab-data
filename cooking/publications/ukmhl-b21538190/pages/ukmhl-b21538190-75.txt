73 SAVOURIES and BREAKFAST DISHESL r COOKING OF EGGS in Low Temperature. The low temperature method is applicable either to tough materials, or those liable to become tough by use of a higher temperature. An egg may be cooked right through, and still remain quite tender, by keeping the water at about 170° Fahr., for say 10 minutes, or over according to taste. An invalid who could not assimiliate an ordinary boiled egg, and could not bear an egg underdone in the ordinary way, ate, enjoyed, and easily digested one done in this way, as both yolk and white set, but remained quite tender. The method may be imitated for ordinary purposes without using a thermometer, by putting the eggs to be cooked into boiling water and leaving them a longer time than usual merely in a warm place. Mrs. M‘William , 221 Upperthorpe, Sheffield. SWISS EGGS. 2 eggs. I 1 teaspoonful of butter. 3 tablespoonfuls of grated cheese. | A little chopped parsley. Salt and pepper. Butter a very small ashet, and sprinkle it with a little of the grated cheese. Next drop the eggs on, being careful not to break the yolk, sprinkle with salt and pepper, the rest of the cheese, and the parsley. Bake in a hot oven till set.

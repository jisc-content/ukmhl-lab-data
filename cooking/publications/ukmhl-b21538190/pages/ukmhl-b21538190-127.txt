123 MINCE MEAT (for Christmas Pies). 2 lbs. lean beef. 2 lbs. suet (beef). 2 lbs. of raisins. 2 lbs. of currants. 2 lbs. of apples. A tablespoonful of salt. 2 lb. moist sugar, f lb. mixed peel, i 07.. mixed spice, i pint of sherry. b pint of brandy. Prepare the lean beef by taking every scrap of fat away, and the suet by removing any skin or stringy bits, then chop them fine together. After stoning the raisins, and taking skin and core from the apples, chop them also together. Wash and pick over the currants, and rub them in a cloth, leaving them a short time near the fire to dry thoroughly. Sprinkle the salt over the beef and suet, mince the peel, and by degrees add all the other ingredients, mixing well all the time, and putting in the wine and brandy after everything else. Put the mince meat in a jar well tied down, and keep in a dry place. It is better to make it a few weeks before using, and it keeps good for many months. Lady King, Carstairs House, Carstairs, N.B. YORKSHIRE PUDDING (for Roast Meat). 4 eggs. I i teaspoonful of salt. 4 tablespoonfuls of flour. | 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of milk. Beat the eggs well and mix gradually with the flour, add the salt and the milk. Beat the batter till it is perfectly smooth, and in the meantime place the pudding tin beneath the roast meat to become hot and to be moistened over with the dripping from the meat. Pour in the batter and place under the meat, turning it round so that all parts may be equally done. The real Yorkshire pudding is not more than half an inch in thickness and is never turned, but requires about half an hour to make it well done. In most families it is about an inch thick, and when browned is cut into squares and turned over so that the other side may be equally browned. This will require 1J hours to bake and is usually served with roast beef. Mrs. Robertson, Haggs.

SWISS TOFFEE. 1 tin condensed Swiss milk. j $ lb. white sugar. 2 tablespoonfuls syrup. | A good bit of butter. 2 teaspoonfuls vanilla. Have a smooth saucepan, put into it a little water and the sugar and stir over a clear fire till it melts, then add the condensed milk and stir very well till it becomes brown, then add the butter. Now put some cold water into a teacup and drop some of the toffee into it, let it stand a minute and if it is hard it is ready, and can be poured into greased tins and cut in squares. The vanilla is put in just before pouring the toffee into the tins. This toffee should be stirred very carefully, as it is very easily burned. Miss Nancy Bell, 48 Grant Street.

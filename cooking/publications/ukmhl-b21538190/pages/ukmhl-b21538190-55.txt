63 salt, and lemon juice, and add as much water as will make a stiff paste. Turn it out roughly on a paste board and roll in a long strip, rolling from you. Fold in three and roll out three times, each time turning the folded edges to and from you. Double it and roll out a little larger than the pie dish. Cut off a band and lay it on the rim of the dish, which should first be brushed with egg, then brush the band of paste and lay on the cover, pressing lightly. Cut the edges with a sharp knife, make a hole in the centre, and brush round it with egg. Roll out the odd scraps of paste and ornament the pie, and then brush all over with egg to glaze it. Bake for ij hours; the first 15 minutes the oven should be very hot and afterwards cooler. Mrs. Thomson, Cransley, Pollokshields. SAVOURY CHBCKEN PIE. x fowl.

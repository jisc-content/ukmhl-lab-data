Milk. | Seasoning. Free a little cooked white fish from skin and bone while warm, and pound it into very small pieces, or cut it up and sieve it. For two tablespoonfuls of fish take the same measure of bread- crumbs, and soak them in fish stock or warm milk, just to cover and beat up, after pouring off any moisture add the fish and a beaten egg, with a dust of salt and pepper. Pour into a buttered basin and steam until just set, rather more than an hour. Sauce may be poured round. A few drops of anchovy sauce and a little colouring will improve flavour and appearance.

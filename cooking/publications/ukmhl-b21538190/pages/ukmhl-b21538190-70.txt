68 KOHL-RABI. Kohl-rabi, or kale-turnip as it is sometimes called, is a cultivated variety of kale or cabbage, distinguished by the swelling of the stem, just above the ground, in a turnip form, to the size of a man’s fist, the larger leaf-stalks springing from the swollen part. This swollen part is used for food. It may be served according to any recipe for turnip; or, uncooked, in slices for salads. It is not much known in this country, but is easily grown and is a delicious vegetable. As a vegetable, one good way to use it is to boil till tender, and serve with white sauce poured over. Decorate with a few of the tender leaves. Miss J. Brownlie, Hill Street. VEGETABLE MARROW OR CUCUMBER. Peel the vegetable, take out the seeds, and cut in rather large pieces.

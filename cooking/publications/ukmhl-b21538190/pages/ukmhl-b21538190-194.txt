Demerara sugar, or to every breakfastcupful of liquid allow Â£ lb. sugar, Soak the malt for 24 hours in about 10 breakfastcupfuls of water. You may require more, and if so add it by pouring it through the malt and allow to soak well in. Squeeze and strain through a hair sieve. You should have about 8 breakfastcupfuls of liquid. Add 1 or 2 cupfuls of water to allow for boiling in. Boil 2 hours, strain, and if you have not enough, add water and make up to 8 breakfastcupfuls again (you must judge the strength, it may not stand having water added, if so just leave it and use less sugar). When well strained through a jelly bag or cloth, add the sugar, lb. sugar to every breakfastcupful of liquid, and boil ^ to f hour. Put in jars, and begin by giving 1 teaspoon- ful three times a day and increase to a tablespoonful gradually, and keep on taking a good while. It should look like a brown thickish syrup.

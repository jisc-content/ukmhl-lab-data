Some white sauce. | Salt and pepper. 3 eggs. Take the white meat of a chicken and remove the skin and sinews. Mince it up as finely as possible, and then put the meat into a stewpan with some white sauce, a little finely-chopped parsley, salt and pepper. Set the pan on the fire and stir con- tents until it boils, then remove to one side to cool. Beat the yolks of the eggs and mix, and the whites to a stiff froth, and stir gently into the mixture. Butter a mould well and strew over the bottom and sides of it some fine breadcrumbs, and place a piece of white paper round the top to allow the souffle to rise.

remain a few hours more in cold fresh water. Take out and wipe very dry. Have the syrup made of sugar, water, and rind and juice of the lemon, and when pretty thick put one row of fruit at a time and do them very slowly until quite clear. They may be done in slices, and look very beautiful either dried or served in the syrup. A. H., Langside. TO PRESERVE ORANGES WHOLE. Seville oranges. | Sugar. Cut round the oranges as far round the rind as you can without touching the pulp, sliding the knife aslant and making the cut- tings as close as possible. When cut put into cold water for two days, changing the water twice a day. Then boil them in two or three different waters until they are quite soft. Make a syrup of f pint cf water to i lb. of sugar, allowing that quantity for each orange. Let them boil slowly for about half an hour two different times. Put each orange in a separate pot, with sticks across to keep them under the syrup. “ Samaritan.” ANOTHER WAY TO PRESERVE ORANGES WHOLE. Cut the rind in strips, cutting narrow strips out, taking care not to cut too deep, as the whites should be well cut into only not through to the juice. Thick skinned oranges are best. Put oranges in cold water for two days, changing the water twice a day, then boil them in plenty of water, changing it several times until tender, say 2 hours or so. Drain off water and boil them in the syrup for half an hour. Let them stand a week, and boil again for half an hour or even less if the syrup is a good colour and not very watery. Syrup.—4J lbs. loaf sugar, 3 pints of water to each six oranges. Boil a few minutes, and skim before putting in oranges. Miss Frew, Langside.

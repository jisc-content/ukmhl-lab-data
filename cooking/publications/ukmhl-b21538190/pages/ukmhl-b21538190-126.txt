Try SMITH’S Clascow FURNITURE POLISH Does not finger mark, is easily used, and gives a beautiful and lasting polish. TESTIMONIAL. Having first practically tested the “ Glasgow Furniture Polish,” prepared by Mr. Peter Smith, against other preparations for the same purpose, and thereby satisfied, ourselves of its superiority. We have for a long period used it exclusively in our own trade, and have recommended it when occasion offered, to our wholesale and retail customers, with so much appreciation, that our demand for it in both departments has largely and steadily increased. We are thus enabled to give our testimony in its favour. (Sgd.) WYLIE & LOCHHEAD, Limited. In Bottles, 3d., 6d., Is., and Is. 6d. SOLD EVERYWHERE. JAMES SMITH, MANUFACTURER, 104 MONTROSE STREET.

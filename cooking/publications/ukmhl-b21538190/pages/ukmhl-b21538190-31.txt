Beat up thoroughly with a fork and with floured hands roll in balls. Brush with egg, roll in breadcrumbs, and fry in hot fat. Serve on a hot ashet and garnish with parsley. Mrs. Jackson Northampton. CASSEROLE OF FISH. 8 or 9 potatoes. I A little white sauce 2 yolks and i white of egg. ^ oz. butter, i fresh haddock I ^ oz. tasty cheese. Salt and pepper. Boil the potatoes and mash them, add the yolks, butter, and the cheese grated, also salt and plenty of pepper. Form a border with this ; make it neat and smooth on a greased oven shelf, and put into the oven to brown. When a little firm, brush over with the white of egg to glaze it. Boil a fresh haddock, take away all skin and bone, make a little good sauce with milk, add the flakes of the fish. When the border is nicely browned, slip it on a flat dish and fill the middle with the fish and sauce. This makes a good children’s dinner.

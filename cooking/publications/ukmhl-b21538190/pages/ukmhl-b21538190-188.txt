Barley Water.—Wash well through two or three waters 3 ozs. of pearl barley. Pour over it 3 breakfastcupfuls of cold water. Simmer till the water has evaporated one-half, strain. Two tablespoonfuls of barley water made thus, added to half a cupful of beef tea, is sometimes a pleasant change. For a fever drink barley water should not be so thick; but after boiling half an hour it should be strained into a jug, in which are the rind of half a lemon and a teaspoonful sugar.

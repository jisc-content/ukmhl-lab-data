Set the pan on the fire again, and boil for three minutes or more, if the egg is quite fresh, or two minutes and a half, if the egg has been kept any time. Eggs to be boiled hard for salads and other dishes should be put into cold water, boiled for a quarter of an hour after the water comes to the boil, and then at once thrown into cold water. The shells should not be taken off till the eggs are cold. TO POACH EGGS. 3 eggs. i l table-spoonful vinegar. 1 pint water. I l teaspoonful salt. 3 pieces buttered toast. Take a shallow saucepan or frying-pan, about half-full of water, perfectly clean. Add the vinegar and salt. Break each egg into a separate teacup, and, when the water is boil- ing rapidly, slip it gently from the cup into the water. There is a knack in doing this so that the egg may not spread or become ragged. A good way is to allow a little water to enter the cup and get below the egg, which sets it to a certain extent, before it is allowed to lie freely in the water. About one minute is sufficient to cook the egg, but the eye is the best guide; the yolk should remain in a liquid state, lying in the centre of the white. Have buttered toast prepared on a dish, and cut in pieces rather larger than the eggs; then take up the eggs carefully with a small slice, pare off any ragged parts from the edges, and lay them on the toast. They may be laid on slices of fried bacon, or on spinach when preferred. BUTTERED EGGS. 2 eggs. I 1 oz. butter. Pepper and salt. I 1 slice buttered toast. Put the butter in a saucepan, and melt it; add the eggs well beaten with pepper and salt to taste, and continue stir- ring till the eggs are sufficiently cooked—about two minutes.

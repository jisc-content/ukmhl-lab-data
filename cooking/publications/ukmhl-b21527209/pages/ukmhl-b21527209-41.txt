This is a much more savoury mode of cookery than boiling; any part of the juices of the meat which may have been drawn out in cooking being preserved and served in the liquor, which should be highly seasoned. Generally, much more can be made of meat by stewing, than by roasting, broiling, or frying, because nothing is lost in the process of dressing. It also possesses the decided advantage of being a convenient way in which meat may be dressed for a person whose time of dining is uncertain. A stewed steak, for instance, will keep warm and in good condition for an hour, but a broiled or fried steak cannot be kept a minute after dressing. An iron pan is best, as it takes a longer time for the heat to penetrate. Stews which are highly dressed, and are composed of various parts prepared in a different manner, are called made dishes. A highly-seasoned stew forms what is termed a ragout.

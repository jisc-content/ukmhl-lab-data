FRIED BACON—LAMB’s OR CALF’S LIVER—CALF’S FEET. 31 TO FRY BACON OR HAM AND EGGS. 6 slices of ham or bacon. | 3 or 4 eggs. The bacon should be cut very thinly in slices, not more than a quarter of an inch in thickness. The best bacon is that which is alternately streaked with fat and lean. No butter or dripping is required in the pan when frying bacon, but constant turning is necessary. When done, take the slices from the pan, and place them in a hot dish before the fire. Have the number of eggs required previously broken, each in a separate cup, and place them gently in the pan, so as to preserve them in a round flat shape. Let them remain in the pan till the white is set; take them out carefully with a slice, and place them on the bacon. The tasteful appear- ance of this dish is spoiled if the eggs be either broken or ragged, which is very apt to be the case if they are not first broken into cups. TO FRY LAMB’S OR CALF’S LIVER. 1 lb. liver. 2 oz. lard. * lb. bacon. 1 oz. flour. 2 gills water or gravy. Pepper and salt. Cut the liver in thin slices; dust them with flour, and fry slowly in lard or dripping; let them be thoroughly cooked. When done, lift the slices out, pour away the fat, and fry the bacon; put the bacon with the liver; add the flour mixed with the water to the pan, which turn round for a minute or two to boil; season, and pour over the liver in the dish. Serve hot. TO FRY CALF’S FEET. 2 calf’s feet. Pepper and salt. Pat for frying. 1 lb. flour. 1 egg. 1 gill milk. After being washed and well boiled, take the meat off the bones.

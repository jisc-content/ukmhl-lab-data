47 SOUPS AND BROTHS. SOUPS AND BROTHS. No middle-class kitchen should he without a stock-pot, which with ordinary care and attention will, by the proper selection and use of scraps and hones, supply the stock without which no soup, sauce, or stew can he satisfactorily prepared. Into the stock-pot should he put all hones from roasted or boiled joints broken up, the carcasses of poultry and game, if not too high, gravy, and scraps in general; if necessary, a few pounds of hones can he bought and added. Cover these well with water, or the liquor in which a joint has been boiled ; bring it to the boil; throw in a little salt and a few flavouring vegetables, and allow to simmer gently for five or six hours. Then strain the liquor into a basin, and set aside to get quite cold. Remove the fat from the top before using. In warm weather this stock must he reboiled eveiy day, and in winter once in three days. The stock-pot must he washed and well scoured, rinsed, and dried each time after use. Another and very nutritious stock may be made from fish bones and trimmings, except those of mackerel, herring, and dried fish. Put them into a pan, with sufficient water to cover them, and a small piece of the various flavouring vegetables, twelve peppercorns, and a blade of mace. Cover and simmer for two hours, skimming carefully and frequently. Strain through a sieve and allow the stock to cool. Then remove the scum from the top, and it is ready for use. This stock forms the foundation for many fish soups. A codâ€™s head may he used instead of bones and trimmings, or the liquor in which a turbot has been boiled. The stock for the more elaborate soups, such as brown, clear, and white soups, must he specially made from fresh meat. It is better flavoured-when made from different kinds of meat. If brown stock is wanted, brown meat must pre- dominate ; if a paler stock, brown and white meat in equal quantities; and if white stock, white meat only must be Vised,

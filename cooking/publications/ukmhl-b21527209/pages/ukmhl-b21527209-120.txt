lie JAM-MAKING. JAM- M AKIN G. Home-made jam, when properly and carefully prepared, is much cheaper and superior to that which is offered for sale. When making jams or preserves, great care and attention must he given to carrying out the following rules. (1) Let the fruit be sound, dry, free from dust, and if possible gathered under a morning sun. (2) Preserve the fruit upon the same day that it is gathered, and as soon after gathering as convenient. (3) Let the sugar be of the finest quality, whether white or brown. Good loaf-sugar, or the large crystallised white sugar, we consider the best for delicate fruits such as strawberries, apricots, &c., and for making syrups, but the raw brown sugar may be used for ordinary jam. Sugar that is extracted from the beetroot and other vegetables does not easily solidify, and so frequently causes jam made with it to ferment. There is no economy in using inferior sugar: it throws up a great deal of scum, which has to be removed, and a large proportion of the jam is thus wasted. (4) Never stir with iron or pewter spoons, as they are liable to spoil the colour of the fruit; use a wooden spoon or spatula for the purpose. (5) If you do not possess a brass preserving pan, sub- stitute a porcelain-lined saucepan, but do not use an iron or tin-lined pan. Take care that the pan is scrupulously clean. Do not let it rest immediately on the fire, but fix it at least two inches above; the fruit and sugar are very apt to burn when close to the fire. (6) Skim away all froth as it rises, and continue to do this until no more comes. (7) If you wish to preserve the colour and flavour of the fruit, boil quickly and stir almost constantly, until the syrup will solidify when a little is dropped upon a cold plate. Then pour the jam at once into dry and sound jars, and set it aside for twenty-four hours to become cold and firm.

STEWED BEEF KIDNEYS—CALF’s SWEETBREADS—PIGEONS. 41 TO STEW BEEF-KIDNEYS. 1 ox kidney. 1 oz. flour. 2 table-spoonfuls ketchup. 1 table-spoonful vinegar. 1 pint stock. 2 onions. Pepper and salt. Cut the kidneys into slices, carefully removing all the tubes or passages; wash them and dry them; dust them with flour, and place them in a stew-pan with beef gravy, flavoured with minced onions, vinegar, pepper, and salt. Stew slowly for three hours, and add mushroom ketchup before dishing. Serve hot. TO STEW CALF’S SWEETBREADS. 1 pair calf’s sweetbreads. 1 pint good stock. A little ketchup. 1 oz. flour. 1 oz. butter. Pepper and salt. Wash the sweetbreads, and blanch them, by putting them into a saucepan with cold water and letting it boil; throw away the water; again wash the sweetbreads and pick away all pieces of skin and fat. Break them into conveniently- sized pieces. Toss them in flour. Melt the butter in a stew- pan, and fry the sweetbreads to a pale brown colour; add the stock and seasonings. Stew slowly for one hour. Turn on to a hot dish, and garnish with green peas. When a white stew is desired use milk instead of stock. Lamb’s sweet- breads are small, but very good, dressed in this manner. TO STEW PIGEONS. 2 pigeons. 1 pint stock. 1 oz. flour. 3 oz. butter. 4 table-spoonfuls bread crumbs. Pepper and salt. Pick and wash the pigeons well, and truss them in the same way as fowls for boiling. Mix two ounces of butter with the bread crumbs, pepper, and salt, and put half into the breast of each pigeon. Dust them with flour, and brown them in a covered stew-pan with a good piece of butter; put in a little flour for thickening; add the gravy or hot water. Season highly, and let them stew slowly for twenty minutes or half an hour. In serving, a piece of toasted bread may be put under each pigeon.

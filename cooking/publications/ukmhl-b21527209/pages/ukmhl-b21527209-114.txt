110 RICE RISSOLESâ€”MACARONI PUDDING. This makes an excellent cake, if put into a well-buttered tin shape, and baked for two hours in a slow oven. RICE RISSOLES. I lb. rice. 1 oz. butter. Cinnamon. Pat for frying. 1 pint milk. 2 oz. sugar. 2 eggs. Bread, crumbs. Wash the rice and boil it in the milk. Stir frequently to prevent burning. When the rice is soft, stir in the butter, sugar, cinnamon, and the yolk of one egg. Cook over the fire for a few minutes, then turn on a plate to cool. Roll small portions into a round shape, like a sausage. When quite smooth and free from cracks dip each rissole into a beaten egg, then toss it in bread crumbs until thoroughly covered, and fry in hot fat for about three minutes to a pale- brown colour. Drain on porous paper. Serve hot on a folded napkin, or clean dish paper. Sweet sauce, made with one table-spoonful of raspberry or currant jelly, dissolved in half a gill of hot water, may be served separately. MACARONI PUDDING. 2 oz. macaroni. 1 pint milk. A little nutmeg. 2 eggs. 2 oz. sugar. 1 oz. butter. Wash and break the macaroni in small pieces, put it into a saucepan with hot water and salt to cover it, and boil for ten minutes. Pour off the water, add the milk and cook slowly until the macaroni is tender. Add the butter and sugar, and turn it into a basin to cool. Peat the eggs to a stiff froth. Mix all thoroughly, and put it into a greased pie-dish. Grate a little nutmeg over the top, and bake in a moderately hot oven for about twenty minutes, to a pale- brown colour. This may be served hot or cold. Macaroni boiled in milk, with a little sugar, and thickened with an egg, makes a nice and simple pudding. When merely boiled in milk, and placed in a tin shape like a ring, it forms a pretty boundary to hashed meat or mince of any kind.

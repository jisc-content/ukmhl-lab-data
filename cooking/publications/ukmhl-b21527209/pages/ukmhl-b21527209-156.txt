Tumblers and wine-glasses should be turned down when they are put away, so that the dust may not get into them, and decanters and water-bottles which are not in constant use should be put away with a little whisky in them; this will keep them sweet. TO CLEAN STEEL KNIVES. Plunge the blades of the knives into very hot water and soda, wash them well, and then dry them. Scrape a little bath-brick on to a knife-board, and rub the knives quickly backwards and forwards till they are clean, being careful not to press too heavily towards the front of the knife, as the leather of the board is apt to cut. If the knives are stained, it may be necessary to rub them with a little powdered bath-brick moistened with water. When they are quite clean, wipe them carefully with a dry cloth. Should the ivory handles of the knives become discoloured, cover them with a coating of whiting moistened with lemon- juice or white vinegar; allow them to stand for eight or ten hours, and then rinse them in cold water, and polish them first with lemon-juice, and then with a soft cloth. TO WASH A CHAMOIS LEATHER. Dissolve some boiled soap in warm water, and wash the leather in it, pressing it with the hands, but not rubbing it; change the water several times until the leather appears clean, then rinse in clean water, and dry in the sun or by a fire, pulling and rubbing it until it is nearly dry.

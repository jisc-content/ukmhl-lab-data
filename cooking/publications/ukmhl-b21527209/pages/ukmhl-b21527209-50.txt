TO MAKE MEAT AND POTATO PUDDING. 2 lb. potatoes. £ pint milk. 2 eggs. 1 lb. cooked meat. 1 table-spoonful ketchup. Pepper and salt. Boil the potatoes, rub them through a colander, and make them into a thick batter with the milk and eggs. Lay some chopped and seasoned meat in a dish, then some batter; repeat, and let the last layer be of the batter. Bake to a light brown colour and serve hot. TO MAKE TOAD IN A HOLE. 1 lb. beef. h oz. dripping, i lb. flour. Pepper and salt. 1 pint milk. 2 eggs. Prepare a batter as for Yorkshire pudding. Place in the centre of a greased baking-dish a round piece of beef, seasoned to taste. Pour over sufficient batter to cover it. Bake in a moderately-heated oven for about an hour. This may be done with cold meat in slices, but then it will not require so long to bake. TO MAKE POTTED HEAD. J bullock’s head. i Water. 1 ox foot. I Pepper and salt. Take the head and cleanse it thoroughly ; soak it in warm water, with the foot, for two or three hours. Then boil both together until they are tender and the bones can bo easily removed. Next strain and cut the meat from the bones. Return the bones and liquor to the pan, and boil for two hours. Strain and set aside until it is cold, so that the fat may be easily skimmed. Put the meat and liquor into a saucepan, and boil for half an hour; season to taste. Pour it into basins, or earthenware shapes, and stand in a cool place. When quite cold, it forms a jelly, and should be turned out on a dish for use. If it does not come out easily, dip the shape in hot water, and the beat will immediately loosen it. Garnish with sprigs of fresh parsley.

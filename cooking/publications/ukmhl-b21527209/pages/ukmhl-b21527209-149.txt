145 CARVING AND HELPING AT TABLE. A tongue is cut across the middle or thick part, without going quite down to the bottom. Cut it in thin neat slices. In carving and serving a pie, begin by cutting the cover or paste in triangular pieces from the centre to the sides. Cut only two pieces before taking out and serving the meat. Serve a piece of paste, and also a little gravy, with each piece of meat. In carving roast hare, cut slices from the back on each side from head to tail; then take off the shoulders and legs; divide the legs into two. If more be required, cut the remainder of the body across in two or three places. Serve a portion of stuffing with each piece. Plum-pudding should be cut in slices from top to bottom, cutting always from the centre. Cheese should be served in small thick pieces. j

48 BROWN OR GRAVY SOUP—KIDNEY SOUP. TO MAKE BROWN OR GRAVY SOUP. 4 lb. shin of beef. 2 small carrots. 1 turnip. 1 stick of celery. Sprig of parsley. Sprig of thyme. 2 onions. 20 peppercorns. 8 cloves. 1 blade of mace. 1 teaspoonful salt. 4 quai’ts water. Cut the beef from the bones into small pieces; take the marrow from the bone, and lay it on the bottom of the saucepan. When it is melted lay in the meat and bones to brown. Turn occasionally, and take care that it does not burn. When browned, add the cold water and salt; let boil and skim thoroughly; then add the vegetables sliced, and the seasonings. Let the soup boil slowly for about five hours. Then strain it through a liair-sieve, and set it aside to get cold. When it is quite cold remove every particle of fat, by means of a heated metal spoon, and finally dip a clean cloth into boiling water, and carefully draw it over the top of the soup. It should now have a clear bright look, with a brownish tinge. It is best made the day before using, that it may be effectually skimmed of fat. Serve very hot, with toasted bread cut in small squares on a separate dish.

SALTING AND CUEING. The best vessels to be employed for salting meat are brown earthenware pans, with lids of the same material. Wooden vessels are apt to become tainted, and if they once acquire a taint, it is difficult to remove it. The proper seasons for salting are spring and the end of autumn, when the tempera- ture of the air is moderate—neither too hot nor too cold. The articles employed in salting are common salt, bay salt, sal prunelle, saltpetre, and brown sugar; in some cases, spices are also used. Those articles which are in lumps should be bruised.

BOILED LEG OF PORK—TONGUE—TRIPE. 3G hours, according to the size. Skim it frequently, to remove the grease which is constantly rising to the top. When done, skin it, and strew bread raspings over the upper side; then place it before the fire to dry and brown. Garnish with greens or cabbage. TO BOIL LEG OF PORK. 1 leg of pork. | Peas pudding (page IOC). Pork requires to be particularly well boiled. Place it in the pot with the skin side uppermost, with a plate below it, for pork is very apt to stick to the bottom of the pot. Peas pudding is generally served separately with this dish.

In all cases, the tripe should be well washed and scraped, put into a saucepan with cold water, brought to the boil; throw away that water and wash the tripe again in pure cold water. Return to the saucepan with plenty of cold water, and boil or rather simmer it very slowly until tender; for quick boiling hardens it.

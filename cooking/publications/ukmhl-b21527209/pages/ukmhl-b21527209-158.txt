154 THE STANLEY BOW. THE STANLEY BOW. Fold the serviette in three (or, if it is very large, in four), lengthways; then turn over one single thickness about an inch wide, and continue to fold this over and over until a band is formed lengthways in the centre of the serviette, as in fig. 12. lurn the serviette, and fold one end over about four or five inches; fold it over again, and then turn it neatly backwards and forwards underneath, when it should be as in fig. 13. Press all firmly together, and then bring down the centre of the upper fold, and tuck the corner under the band in the middle. Repeat this at the other end, and the bow is formed as in fig. 14.

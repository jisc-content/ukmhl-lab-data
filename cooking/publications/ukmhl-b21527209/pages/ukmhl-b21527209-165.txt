MELROSE’S TEAS FAMED FOR THREE-QUARTERS OF A CENTURY ANDW MELROSE & CO. were the first to abolish all intermediate profits between the grower and consumer, when more than fifty years ago they began to import their Teas direct from China to Scotland. In addition to China as a source of supply, they now have at their command the selection of the produce of the finest Tea Gardens in India and Ceylon. This enables them to continue selling Teas of the old-fashioned style that delighted a former generation. Within recent years increasingly large quantities of strong, bitter, and harsh Teas have been imported, chiefly from Assam and Ceylon. The use of these is highly injurious, and should be guarded against. Teas of this character find no place in Melrose’s stock, their reputation having been made by supplying the delicately flavoured Teas, which are the cheapest to buy as well as the most delightful to use.

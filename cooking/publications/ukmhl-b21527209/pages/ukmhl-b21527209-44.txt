Procure good ox palates. Wash in plenty of cold water and rub well with salt, and let them lie for some hours in warm salt and water, rubbing them occasionally to draw out the mucus. Then rinse thoroughly, and put them into a saucepan with cold water to cover them. Let the water heat slowly, but on no account boil. When hot, scrape off the tough horny skin from the palates. If the water boils this will be difficult to remove. Put them in a saucepan with the stock, and the vegetables cut into small pieces. Leo them stew very slowly for at least two hours till they are quite tender. Then season with pepper and salt, ketchup, and a little vinegar. Serve hot. TO STEW VEAL. 3 lb. fillet or breast of veal. I lb. bacon. 1 pint water; 2 hard-boiled eggs. 1 lemon. STUFFING. } lb. bread crumbs. 2 table-spoonfuls chopped parsley. 1 table-spoonful chopped thyme. Pepper. 2 oz. suet. 1 egg. A little lemon-juice. Salt. The best parts of veal for stewing are the fillet and breast. Remove the bones neatly, without disfiguring the meat. Flatten the joint, and season it in the place from which the bones were taken with white pepper, salt, and lemon- juice. Lay on the sliced bacon, the stuffing, and hard-boiled eggs. Roll neatly up and bind with tape; dust well with flour. Rub the bottom of a large stew-pan with butter; lay in the veal, and brown it on all sides. When sufficiently brown, put in the water, and stew it slowly for two hours, or two hours and a half. Before it is to be dished, pour off the gravy, and if not thick enough, brown a little butter, and flour, and add to it. Season with cayenne, salt, and the squeeze of a lemon; skim the sauce, and pour it over the meat before dishing. Garnish with slices of lemon.

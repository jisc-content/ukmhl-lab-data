Pepper. 1 cupful water. 1 table-spoonful ketchup. 1 table-spoonful vinegar. Salt. Cut the meat into thin slices; sprinkle them with pepper and salt, and lay them in a dish. Chop the pickles and sprinkle them over the meat. Then take the water; add to it a table-spoonful of vinegar from the pickles, the ketchup, and any gravy that may be set by for use. Stir all together, and pour it over the meat. Set the meat before the fire with a tin behind it, or put it in a Dutch oven, or in the oven of the kitchen-range, as may be most convenient, for about half an hour before dinner-time.

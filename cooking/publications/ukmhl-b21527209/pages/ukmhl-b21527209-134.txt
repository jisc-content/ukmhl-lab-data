In the preparation of pickles the greatest care must be taken as to the utensils used. Avoid, if possible, using any metal, except iron, or preferably silver, as the acid of the vinegar will act upon the lead used in tinning saucepans, and also upon copper or brass, producing upon the latter two the rust known as verdigris, which is poisonous. Porcelain- lined saucepans are liable to be cracked if used for heating vinegar. It is probably inattention to these details which so often causes pickles to disagree with delicate digestions. In preparing pickles the best and strongest vinegars should be used. When it is necessary to heat the vinegar, put it into an iron saucepan, or into a stone jar placed in a saucepan with hot water around it. As soon as the vinegar reaches boiling-point, remove it from the fire, as the heating process very much diminishes both the strength and flavour of the vinegar. Pickles, like preserves, must be carefully excluded from the air, and stored in a dry place to ensure their keeping for any length of time. Pickles should be kept in stone jars

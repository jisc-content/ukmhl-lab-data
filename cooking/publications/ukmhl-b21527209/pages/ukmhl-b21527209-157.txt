153 THE AFRICAN CROSS. THE FOLDING OF SERVIETTES. THE AFRICAN CROSS. Take a perfectly square serviette, and fold the four corners into the centre as shown in fig. 8. Again fold the corners to the centre, and press firmly down. Turn the serviette, and for the third time fold the corners to the centre. Turn it again, and once more fold the corners to the centre, this making four times. Turn the serviette, and it should resemble fig. 9. Pull up each corner, opening it as you do so, as shown in fig. 10. When all four corners are opened, turn the serviette, and the cross should be formed (fig. 11)â€™ and ready to receive the bread or roll in the centre.

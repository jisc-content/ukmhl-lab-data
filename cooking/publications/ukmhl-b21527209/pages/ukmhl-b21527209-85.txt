FISH WARMED WITH GRAVY—CURRIES—CURRY POWDER. 81 FISH WARMED WITH GRAVY. 1 lb. white fish. .5 pint brown sauce. Pepper and salt. 6 potatoes mashed. 1 oz. butter. 2 table-spoonfuls milk. Cut the fish into moderately-sized neat pieces, free from skin and bone; put them into a stew-pan with some highly- seasoned brown sauce, and set them by the side of the fire to get hot. Mash the potatoes with the butter and milk, and make a firm wall round a dish. When this is neatly done, place the fish and gravy in the centre. The attractiveness of the dish depends on the neatness of the wall of potatoes. Serve hot. CUEEIES. Almost any kind of food, cooked or uncooked, can be curried, cold cooked beef being perhaps the only exception. Uncooked meat will of course take longer in stewing than that Avhich has been previously cooked, and it should be first tossed in butter over the fire till it is of a pale golden colour. All skin, bone, and fat should be removed from whatever is to be curried, and it should then be cut up into small square pieces. Boiled rice (page 137) should always be served with or around curry. Curry powder can be bought from any chemist or Italian warehouseman, but for the benefit of those who prefer to make their own we give a genuine Indian recipe, which has been thoroughly tested.

19 ROASTED TOREâ€”SUCKING-PIG. The gravy for lamb may be made in the same manner as for beef or mutton. Serve with mint-sauce in a sauce tureen. TO ROAST PORK. 4 lb. loin of pork. 1 gill of water. 1 pint of apple sauce. A little salad oil. 4 chopped onions. 1 table-spoonful sage. Pepper and salt. When stuffing is to be iised, it must be composed of chopped sage and onion in the above proportions, with pepper and salt. The outer skin should be neatly and well scored in regular stripes, to enable the carver to cut slices easily. Before putting the joint to the fire, rub the skin with salad oil, to prevent it blistering, and baste very frequently. When there is not enough dripping, the basting may be done by rubbing it with a piece of butter in a muslin bag. The gravy for pork may be the same as for other joints. Apjale sauce helps to overcome the richness or lusciousness of the meat, and imparts a slightly acidulous flavour. It should be served in a sauce tureen. TO ROAST SUCKING-PIG. 1 sucking-pig. I pint beef gravy. I pint apple sauce. 5 lb. bread crumbs. 3 oz. butter. 1 table-spoonful chopped sage. Pepper and salt. The animal being properly prepared and cleaned by the butcher, proceed to cut off the feet, and fill the inside with a stuffing composed of sage, crumbs, and butter in the above proportions, pepper, and salt; sew up the slit. No skewering is required. In roasting, baste with butter, as directed for pork. The time for roasting will be from two to three hours, according to the size. The skin should be crisp and nicely browned. Before bringing to table, split down the back from head to tail, and lay it flat in the dish with the skin side uppermost. Cut the head off, split it in two, take out the brains, and lay half the head at each end. Have the liver boiled, chop it and the brains, and mix these with the gravy in a small tureen. Apple sauce should also be served in a separate tureen.

42 STEWED RABBITS JUGGED HARE—IRISH STEW. TO STEW RABBITS. 2 rabbits. 2 oz. butter. 1 oz. flour. Pepper and salt. 4 large onions. 1 table-spoonful ketchup. 1 table-spoonful vinegar. 1 pint hot water. Wash the rabbits well; cut them in pieces, and scald them for a few minutes. Melt the butter, and fry the rabbits for a short time. When slightly browned, dust in the flour; then add the hot water. Put in the sliced onions, ketchup, vinegar, pepper, and salt to taste. Stew slowly for two hours. JUGGED HARE. 1 hare. 1 dessert-spoonful arrow- root. 1 pint water. Ketchup. 1 onion. Bunch of sweet herbs. Pepper and salt. After having skinned, cleaned, and washed the hare, cut it into pieces, and put it into a jar with the onion, herbs, water, and seasoning. Cover the top of the jar closely, so that as little steam as possible may escape, or the hare will be dry. Place the jar in a saucepan of boiling water (the water must not come to the top of the jar), and keep it constantly boiling for from three to four hours. When done, put the pieces of hare into a hash dish, skim off any fat from the gravy, and thicken it with the arrowroot. Put it into a saucepan, and let it boil; pour it over the hare, and serve with red currant or rowan jelly separately. TO MAKE IRISH STEW. 2 lb. mutton. Pepper. Salt. 8 potatoes. 4 onions. 3 pint hot water. Take a piece of loin or back-ribs of mutton, and cut it into chops. Put them into a stew-pan alternately with parboiled potatoes, sliced onions, pepper, salt, and hot water. Cover closely, and let it stew slowly for an hour; shake the pan occasionally, to prevent the stew from sticking to the bottom. Serve very hot. When properly made, and well seasoned, this is a most savoury dish.

118 ROWAN JELLY—ORANGE MARMALADE—APPLE JELLY. MOUNTAIN-ASH BEllllY OR ROWAN JELLY. 6 pints liquid from the i 6 lb. lump sugar. berries. The mountain-ash berry, called in Scotland the rowan berry, makes an excellent jelly which, being a little bitter, may be eaten with game. The berries should be gathered when red, but not too ripe. Wash them well, and put them into a preserving pan, with cold water sufficient to cover them. Boil till the water is red, and the berries soft. Strain the liquor from the berries through a hair-sieve or jelly-cloth. Throw away the pulp and return the juice to the pan with the sugar. Now boil fast for half an hour, skimming thoroughly. Pour hot into the jars, cover and store like jam. ORANGE MARMALADE. 8 lb. bitter oranges. | 8 lb. lump sugar.

Put the pulp, juice, and chips into the pan, with the sugar, and stir until boiling. Let boil for half an hour; skim thoroughly, and pour the marmalade into jars.

Then chop it with a sharp knife; toss it upon some porous paper, and it is ready for use. TEA. Fill a well rinsed out kettle with freshly drawn cold water, and put it on a brisk fire to boil.

When the water is thoroughly and unmistakably boil- ing, do not lift the kettle off the fire, but bring the teapot to it, to ensure that the water may be poured bubbling on to the dry tea.

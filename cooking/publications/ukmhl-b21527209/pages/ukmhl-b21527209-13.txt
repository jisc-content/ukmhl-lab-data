CUTTING UP MEAT. 9 CUTTING UP MEAT. Butclier-meat is not cut up in the same manner in all parts of the country. There are two chief plans followed—the English and the Scotch—and consequently the pieces of meat in a carcase differ in number, size, and name in England and Scotland. This circumstance creates a certain degree of difficulty in giving directions for cooking; and to obviate this as much as possible, we subjoin the following drawings and explanations. These will assist a housewife in sending to market for what pieces of meat she requires. Eig. 1 represents a bullock marked for cutting up on the English plan. No. 1 is the loin or sirloin ; 2, the rump ; 3, the aitch or edge bone; 4, buttock; 5, hock; 6, thick flank; 7, thin flank; 8, fore-rib ; 9, middle-rib; 10, chuck- rib; 11, brisket; 12, leg of mutton piece; 13, clod, sticking, and neck pieces; 14, shin; and 15, the leg. From 1 to 7 is the hind-quarter, and from 8 to 15 is the fore-quarter. Nos. 1 and 2 on both sides, united, constitute what is called a baron of beef. Fig. 2 represents a bullock marked for cutting up on the Scotch plan. No. 1 is the sirloin or back sye ; 2, the hook bone; 3, buttock; 4, large round (3 and 4 together make the rump); 5, small round; 6, hough ; 7, thick flank; 8, thin flank; 9, nineholcs; 10 and 11, large and small runner; 12, spare or fore syc; 13, brisket; 14, shoulder Iyer; 15, nap or shin; 16, neck; and 17, the sticking piece.

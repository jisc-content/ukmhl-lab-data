PANCAKES—FRITTERS—MEAT PANCAKES. 134 PANCAKES. 1 lb. flour. 1 pint milk. 2 oz. lard. 1 lemon. 1 egg. Salt. Sifted sugar. Put the flour and salt into a basin, add half the milk, and heat- well with a spoon until there are no lumps ; next add the egg and beat well, and then add the remainder of the milk. Let the batter stand for at least half an hour. Set a clean frying-pan on the fire, and put a piece of lard into it, about the size of a walnut. When it is quite hot, pour in batter enough to cover the bottom of the pan. Let the pan stand over the fire quite still until the batter is set, slide a knife round the edges, and shake the pan to prevent it sticking. When the under side is of a light brown, turn the pancake and brown the other side. Then turn it on to a paper with some sifted sugar upon it. Sprinkle a little lemon-juice over it, and roll it up quickly. Pancakes should be served very hot, and the thinner they are the nearer they approach perfection. 5 oz. flour. 3 large apples. Sugar. FRITTERS. 1 table-spoonful salad oil. 2 whites of eggs. 1 gill warm water. Make a batter with the flour, oil, and water. Whip the whites of eggs to a stiff froth, and stir them lightly into the batter. Peel, core, and cut the apples in slices, sift sugar over them, and dip each slice separately in the batter. Drop each one thus prepared into a pot of hot fat to cook for about three minutes. Lift them with a perforated spoon on to porous paper, sift sugar over them, and serve hot on a folded napkin. Fritters may be made with oranges or apricots in the same manner. Serve all fritters with sugar sprinkled over them. MEAT PANCAKES. \ lb. flour. 1 egg. Pepper and salt.

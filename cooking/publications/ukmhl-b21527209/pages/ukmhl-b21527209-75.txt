Prepare the other slice of fish in the same way, and place both on a hot, well- greased gridiron; cook the salmon lor four or five minutes, turning it constantly that it may be thoroughly heated through.

Trout of a moderate size should be dressed whole, and are best fried. Clean the fish, scale, and wash them. Sprinkle a little pepper and salt over them, and toss them in oatmeal or flour; melt the dripping in a frying-pan, and let it get quite hot; then put in the fish, and fry them for six or seven minutes, turning them that both sides may be browned. Lift them on to a piece of porous paper to drain, and serve on a hot dish with a folded napkin under them. BOILED TURBOT. Turbot is considered to be the finest flat fish, and requires care both in the preparation and in cooking. It is best to choose a medium-sized fish, which should be thick in the middle, of a cream-coloured white, and elastic to the touch. Before it is to be cooked, alloiv it to lie for ten minutes in strong salt and water, and then rub it well with the hand to remove the slime. Wash it carefully in fresh water, and dry it. Leave the fins on, and make an incision in the black side to prevent the white skin from cracking; rub the white side with lemon-juice and a little salt to preserve the colour. See that the fish-kettle is roomy and scrupulously clean; then boil according to general directions for from twenty-five to thirty minutes, skimming very carefully when necessary. Serve with the white side uppermost, on a hot dish, with a folded napkin under the fish. Garnish with crimped parsley, cut lemon, and lobster spawn. Serve separately in a sauce-boat, lobster, hollandaise, or butter sauce.

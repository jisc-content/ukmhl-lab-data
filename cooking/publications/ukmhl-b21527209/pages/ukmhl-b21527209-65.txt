61 DRESSED VEAL PLUCK—MINCED COLLOrS. TO DRESS A VEAL PLUCK. 1 calf’s pluck. 1 onion. 2 oz. flour. 2 table-spoonfuls ketchup. J lb. bacon. Dripping. STUFFING FOR HEART. 2 oz. bread crumbs. 1 oz. suet chopped. 1 egg. 1 table-spoonful parsley- chopped. Pepper and salt. Wash the pluck and dry it. Stuff the heart in the opening at the top with a stuffing made of the above ingredients, and sew it up. Then roast it for from half an hour to three-quarters of an hour according to the size. Parboil the lights and half the liver; mince them finely, and stew them for half an hour in a little of the liquor in which they were boiled, with a chopped onion, pepper, salt, ketchup, and a little flour. Cut the remainder of the liver in slices, toss them in flour, and fry them with the slices of bacon. Place the heart in the centre of a hot dish, with the hash round it, and a slice of liver, and one of bacon alternately on the hash all round. Another way.—Parboil, and then mince the heart and lights with seasonings as above. Stew for half an hour with a little of the liquor in which the heart and lights were boiled. Cut the liver in slices, toss them in flour, and fry them with the slices of bacon. Pour the hash into a deep, hot dish, and garnish on the top with the liver and bacon. To make collops, take a slice of lean beef (steak from the round is best), remove all fat and skin, and mince finely. Put the butter into a stew-pan, and, when it is melted, add the collops and the onion sliced. Beat well with a spoon or beater until the collops are separated; then add the bread crumbs, water, ketchup, pepper, and salt. Cover closely, and allow all to simmer gently for one hour, stirring occasionally. Pour on to a hot dish, and garnish with toasted sippets. MINCED COLLOPS. 1 lb. beef collops. 1 small onion. Pepper. Salt. Toasted sippets. 1 oz. butter. 1 table-spoonful ketchup. 3 table-spoonfuls water. 1 table-spoonful bread crumbs.

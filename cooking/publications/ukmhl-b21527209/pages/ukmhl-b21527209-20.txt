Most dislies of meat have a hare appearance at table, unless they are decorated or garnished. In the following directions for cooking, the garnish used for different dishes is pointed out. When cold meat is brought to table, it is generally decorated with a few sprigs of fresh parsley. ROASTING MEAT. The best joints are selected for roasting, which should be done before the fire. Half an hour before the joint is to be put down, the dust should be raked from the grate, and the lire made up. The joint, which must be handled as little as possible, should be carefully wiped with a dry cloth, and weighed; a quarter of an hour being allowed for each pound, and a quarter of an hour over for brown meats; or twenty minutes for each pound, and twenty minutes over for white meats. The joint should be placed as close as possible to the fire, for the first six or eight minutes, after which it should be well basted, and withdrawn about sixteen or eighteen inches from the fire. It should be basted frequently the whole time it is cooking, and a clear, bright fire must be kept up. Another method of roasting, and one which is very useful for a small joint or a bird, is done in an iron saucepan large enough to admit of a small space around the joint. Rut into the pan enough butter or dripping to cover the bottom; when it is melted, put in the joint and cover with a close-fitting lid; turn and baste the joint from time to time over a slow fire. Allow the same time as for roasting before the fire.

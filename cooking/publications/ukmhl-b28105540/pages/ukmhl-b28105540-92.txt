80 BREAD, CAKES, AND BISCUITS. Boiled Icing.—Boil together |lb. caster sugar in a gill of boiling water till it will “thread” strongly, then beat the white of an egg to a stiff froth, when you add in a quarter of a teaspoonful of cream of tartar, and, lastly, beat in the sugar syrup. Beat it all till cold and thick, flavour to taste, and use. It must be understood that I claim no originality for the following cakes. They have mostly appeared in the columns of the Queen, and have been collected from all sorts of sources. The only thing I can claim is that, granted fair intelligence and good will, they are not difficult to make. Cake, Alexandra.—Cream together lib. of butter, 4oz. lard, loz. of “vol.,” and e'ght eggs beaten till light, with lOoz. moist sugar ; mix together in another basin 4oz. freshly ground almonds, fib. flour, and 4oz. finely shred lemon peel candied. Mix well and bake in a square tin — such as is used for tin loaf. Almond.—Beat £lb. of butter to a cream with rather more than 12oz. of caster sugar ; when this is quite creamed work in carefully, one or two at a time, lib. of eggs (this is about eight or nine, but it is best to weigh them); now work in 14oz. fine flour mixed with a short tea- spoonful of baking powder, l^oz. ground almonds, and a few drops of essence of almonds. Mix well and quickly, and bake at once in well papered hoops or tins, with some shredded almonds sprinkled over the top. If baked in lib. tins these cakes take thirty-five minutes, if in 2lb. tins they will require fifty minutes. Blanch and pound loz. bitter almonds, and beat them to the yolks of twelve eggs, beaten till light with a spoonful or two of rose water, then mix into them lib. of crushed and sifted loaf sugar ; next incorporate into this alternately the whites of the eggs whipped to a stiff froth, and lib. of freshly ground sweet almonds, lastly stirring in five good tablespoonfuls of pounded and sifted biscuit

HOUSEHOLD AND FANCY BREADS. 31 for an hour, or until they are well risen, when they must be thoroughly baked. The better bread is baked the more digestible it is. French Bread.—Sift 41b. of fine flour into a pan and make a bay in the centre; dissolve 4oz. of butter in half a pint of tepid milk and water, work it up with 2oz. of dried yeast, and pour the mixture when blended into the bay, drawing down a little flour from the sides to form a small pool of thin batter in the hollow ; then dust the top with some more fresh flour, and get the pan covered with a cloth inside the fender in a warm corner to rise. Remember that, though it must be kept warm, it must not be allowed to get hot. In about three hours knead it up again with about one and a half pints of tepid milk and water; then again cover it, and let it rise as before for three-quarters of an hour ; now dust a board lightly with flour, turn out the dough, and make it up into loaves, which must also be set to rise for fifteen minutes, then bake in a well-heated oven. Germ Bread—See Hovis Bread. Graham Bread.—Warm together lioz. to 2oz. of butter and 2oz. to 3oz. of molasses till the butter is quite dis- solved ; now add to it half a teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda, previously dissolved in a short half pint of tepid water with half a teaspoonful of salt; then stir this with a delicately clean wooden spoon into half a pint of ordinary white bread dough, working into it then enough Graham flour to produce a very thin dough. Turn it into a buttered pan, and let it rise till quite even with the top of the pan (which should only have been half full), and bake from one hour to one and a quarter hours in a moderate oven. Gluten Bread.—Mix together a pint of cold milk and a pint of boiling water, pour this on to a teaspoonful of butter, and the same of salt, and let it stand till it is all lukewarm. Now add a well-beaten whole egg, a quarter of a compressed yeast cake, previously dissolved, and enough

Charcoal.—Sieve carefully together lib. of fine, dry flour and 4oz. finest “ willow ” charcoal, and mix it all to a stiff paste with a little water, stirred in gradually; loz. or 2oz. of sugar may be added to the mixture, but it is better without.

Chestnut.—Put on the board 6oz. chestnut flour and 4oz. of either Coomb’s Eureka or the Paisley flour, make a hollow in the centre with your knuckles ; put into this 4oz. just warmed (not oiled) butter and 3oz. caster sugar, and

ROLLS, &c. 73 Scones, Yorkshire.—This, also sometimes called “York- shire girdle cake,” is made thus : mix Jib. dried and sifted flour to a dough with sour cream, make it into a large round cake the size of the girdle or pan, and bake on both sides (turning it only once) on a hot greased girdle or pan, then split it, butter generously, and serve hot. This is never a success if baked in an oven. Coomb’s.—Into Jib. of Coomb’s Eureka flour rub 2oz. of butter, and make it into a dough with a gill of curdled cream or sour milk; roll it out rather thin, stamp out into rounds with a tumbler, and bake on the girdle, turning it once in the process.

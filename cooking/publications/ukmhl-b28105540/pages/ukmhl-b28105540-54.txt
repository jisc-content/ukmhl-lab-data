BREAD, CAKES, AND BISCUITS. 42 used instead of the fine flour or oatmeal when this bread is made with yeast. It is well to remember that this dough can only be made in rings or as bannocks, for wholemeal is a bad heat conductor, and if made up into the ordinary loaves the outside would be hard and overcooked long before the inside was more than a pudding or stodgy mass.

30 BREAD, CAKES, AND BISCUITS. butter, two teaspoonfuls baking powder, one egg, and about a tablespoonful of milk. Either of these two breads, if cut into rusks as in the recipe for coffee bread, and baked on both sides, make excellent biscuits. Diet Bread.—Sift together 4lb. granulated wheat meal, 2oz. cream of tartar, and loz. bicarbonate of potash ; make a hollow in the centre of this meal with your knuckles (a “bay” as it is technically called), and into this put loz. fine salt, 2oz. caster sugar, and just enough churned milk to dissolve the salt and sugar; when these are quite melted, work to it just enough churned milk to bring it all to a nice smooth dough, then mould in buttered tins, and bake at once. Egg Bread.—Mash well together a breakfastcupful each of cooked rice and hominy, and work in alternately the well beaten yolks of four eggs, and three tablespoonfuls of fine flour, half pint new milk, and one tablespoonful of butter; when these are all well mixed, stir in the stiffly whipped whites of the eggs, shape the dough into loaves, and bake in a quick oven, Frame Food Bread.—Allow loz. of “ frame food extract ” to every 71b. of flour, making up the bread in the usual way. The extract adds greatly both to the flavour and the nutritive qualities of the flour. It may be added in the same way to any cake or biscuit mixtures. Dyspepsia Bread.—Mix together £oz. caster sugar, Joz. salt, 2oz. ground rice, loz. diastase, and £oz. German yeast, moistening it with half a pint of milk and one and a half pints of warm water; when well blended work into it 3^1b. to 41b. of whole meal or the finest flour till it becomes a fairly firm dough. Put this into a large pan capable of holding twice its capacity, cover it all over with a cloth, and set it in a cool place to rise till next morning (or, at all events, for six to eight hours); then turn it out, dust with a little more flour or ground rice, knead it well together, make it up into 21b. loaves, and put these away

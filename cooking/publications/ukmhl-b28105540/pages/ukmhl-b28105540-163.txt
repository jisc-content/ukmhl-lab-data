CHAPTER YI. FOREIGN CAKES. Apfel Kuchen.—Work well together Alb. fresh butter and lib. flour, and when well mixed work in 4oz. sugar, loz. mixed spice, and the yolks of two eggs; when this is well kneaded together cut the paste in two, and line the bottom of a round cake or fleur tin with one part. Cover this with apples stewed with a little sugar and some well washed and dried currants (use when cold) ; roll out the other piece of paste and cover the tart with this. Bake for half an hour and leave it till cold in the baking tin, then ice and garnish to taste. Some cooks instead of stewing the apples core and slice them thinly and arrange them on the paste, with powdered cinnamon and sugar to taste, and about 2oz. blanched and shred almonds strewed over all. Then the top is covered over with a lattice of pastry strips, brushed over with egg white and roughly strewn with sugar, the whole being then baked in a fairly hot oven till the apples are tender and the paste well coloured. It may be served hot but is prettier cold, when a little rose of stiffly whipped cream is forced out on to every alternate square between the pastry strips, a little cube of currant jelly or a halved crystallised cherry being set on each heap of cream. Apostel Kuchen.—This is an essentially German cake, and, indeed, mostly confined to certain parts of that country. Mix together 6oz. of fine sifted flour with four tablespoonfuls

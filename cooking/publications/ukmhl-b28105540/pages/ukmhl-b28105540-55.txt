CHAPTER III. ROLLS, &c. Even in houses where bread making is eschewed, hot rolls are often liked, and, indeed, looked on as an integral part of breakfast. Now of rolls there are many varieties, and most of them are easy to make. The following rules may be of use. In heating the oven for bread, the baker’s test is to put in a teaspoonful of flour, and watch how long it takes to brown, putting in the batch if the flour browns in five minutes, or perhaps a trifle under; but for I’olls the flour must brown in a minute. Yeast, baking powder, or a mix- ture of bicarbonate of soda and cream of tartar, are all used as a raising mixture ; if yeast is used, remember the dough, when shaped for rolls, will need ten to twenty minutes rising before it is baked, but if the chemicals are used, the dry ingredients must be mixed and sifted together separately, the liquids by themselves, and then when ready it is all mixed and shaped as quickly as possible, and put into the oven at once. The proportions for the soda and cream of tartar are one part of the soda to two of the cream of tartar. The usual allowance of baking powder is a full, but not heaped, teaspoonful to the pound of flour ; but this must, of course, depend somewhat on the strength of the baking powder, as different makers var}< the strength a little, so in trying a new brand always test it first. (I use Cowen’s baking powder, and reckon by that.) Again, in

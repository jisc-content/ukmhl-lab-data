BREAD, CAKES, AND BISCUITS. 70 scones to be. Have the girdle hot but ungreased, place the cakes on it, and let them cook for about five minutes, when they should have risen well and the surface be quite smooth; then turn them and cook for five minutes longer till the other side is equally done (they should only be a very pale colour). These cakes may be baked in a hot oven, turning them as above, but though nice enough in this way, they have not the same taste as if cooked on the girdle. Scones, Cream â€”Mix together lib. of flour and a tea- spoonful each of salt and baking powder, beat two eggs till light and mix them with a gill of cream or new milk, and stir this into the flour till it is a stiff dough (some flours require a little more cream or milk). Turn this dough out on to a floured board, roll it out fin. thick, stamp it out in small rounds with a tumbler, prick the top with a fork, and bake fifteen minutes in a quick oven. Serve hot. Mix together fib. of flour, loz. of butter, and a teaspoonful each of baking powder and sugar (or salt); rub the butter well into the flour till it forms a nice paste, moistening this with half a pint of new milk or single cream; divide this quantity in two, roll these halves into largish rounds, which are cut across and across into eight triangles, and bake for five minutes, turning them once, on the girdle. If you have no cream or new milk, use 2oz. of butter and swreet milk. Mix together one and a half breakfastcupfuls of sifted flour, one teaspoonful of baking powder, and a tea- spoonful of sugar ; mix this all to a paste with clotted or very thick cream (it takes about half a pint', halve the dough, roll each half into a thin round cake, cut these across and across into eight triangles, put these on a lightly buttered baking tin, and bake on the hot plate (not the oven) for five minutes, turning them once.

About three or four quarts of good stock boiled the previous day, well skimmed; whites of two eggs, well whisked, stirred into the stock ; then put on the fire to boil. After it has boiled up once, draw it away from the fire; pour in a cup of cold water; let it stand for five minutes; strain through a fine cloth placed over a sieve; it will be clear and good. Stock for clear soups must be made strong, as it loses strength by being clarified.

253 VEGETABLE MARROW AS AN IMITATION OF APPLES. [V butter, bread-crumbs, spices, the yolks of one or two eggs, and the flavouring. Cut average-sized vegetable marrows (the small, pretty-shaped ones) into halves, scoop out the seeds, etc., fill with the above mixture. Wrap up each marrow in a piece of buttered paper tied with a string, lay them all closely together in a buttered tin, cover this with a tin plate, and put in the oven. When you think they are done, remove the paper carefully, lay them in a dish, and serve with a nicely-flavoured gravy made with a little stock, thickened with the yolk of an egg, and a glass of wine or a little lemon mixed just before serving. VEGETABLE MARROW AS AN IMITATION OF APPLES. (Cape. Our own Recipe.) Take a large vegetable marrow—the white kind, with lumps all over the outside—cut it in thin slices, after having peeled and taken out the soft pulp and seeds. Proceed to slice it very thinly. Butter an enamelled pot; put layers of this sliced vegetable marrow, and sugar (for one good-sized marrow take a large breakfast-cup of sugar), a tablespoonful of flour or bread-crumbs, ten cloves, a tumbler of wine and vinegar mixed—pour the wine over the last layer of vegetable marrow and sugar— also a pinch of salt. Let the stewpan simmer for two hours, stirring carefully for fear of burning. Very good with roast duck or goose.

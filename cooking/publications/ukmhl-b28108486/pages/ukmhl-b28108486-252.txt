T] TART (COCOA-NUT—MILK). 238 TART {COCOA-NUT). (“ Klapper-Taart.” From a very old Dutch Book.) Rasp two cocoa-nuts into their weight in sugar, add a good spoonful of butter, a cup of milk, and some cinnamon. Boil all together till it is quite stiff; then line a tart-dish with puff paste, and pour the mixture in. Bake for half an hour. Very good. TART {COCOA-NUT), ANOTHER WAY. (Old Dutch Recipe.) Grate the cocoa-nut very fine, take the weight in sugar, half an ounce of butter, one egg, white and yolk whisked separately, some cinnamon. Mix well together; line a tart-dish (ordinary tin kitchen plate) with puff paste. Bake in a quick oven till a nice brown. Another way is to boil the cocoa-nut in a syrup made from the sugar, and when cold add the egg and butter; but the first has been tried and is very good. TART {MILK).

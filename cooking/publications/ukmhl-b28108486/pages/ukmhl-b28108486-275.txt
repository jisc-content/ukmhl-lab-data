261 Y. YEAST {FOR MAKING HOME-MADE BREAD). (Our own Recipe.) Take two quarts of boiling water, an ounce of salt, three cups of meal. Put the salt into a saucepan, pour on it the boiling water, strew on it gradually three cups of meal, then cover closely, putting a cloth between the lid and pot to absorb the steam. Set it over-night in the warmest corner of your stove. At six oâ€™clock next morning stir into it a cup of boiling water; stand the saucepan on some hot ashes, and soon it will begin to ferment. When ready for use it will have a frothy appearance and a disagreeable odour. Pour it into six pounds of meal, mix with warm water, and knead into bread.

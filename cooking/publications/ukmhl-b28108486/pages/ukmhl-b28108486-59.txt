CURRY (CHICKENâ€”CUCUMBER). [C 45 CURRY {CHICKEN). (Our Cape way.) Ingredients. i Fowl. ij tablespoons of Curry Powder, i "teaspoon of Sugar. J teaspoon of Salt. 2 tablespoons of Vinegar or 2 sour Apples. 1 oz. Butter. 2 Onions sliced and browned in butter or fat. The fowl must not be more than twelve months old, and must be killed the day before cooking. Cut it into small joints. Mix the onions with the curry powder, vinegar, salt, sugar, and butter, into a paste ; lay on the chicken. Cover the pot and let it simmer, or stew gently, for an hour, then stir well. If dry add a little water. A tablespoon of tomato sauce or lemon in half a cup of milk, stirred in shortly before serving, is an improvement, but it will be found excellent without. Serve with boiled rice. Sufficient as an entree for six or eight people. Some people fry the meat and onion together till brown ; but from experience I find it best to do the onions first, and then let all steam with the chicken. Take four large cucumbers that are turning yellow ; peel carefully (be particular that no bitter be left), take out the seeds, cut in halves, or if large in three pieces, stuff with forcemeat, made as follows: one pound of mutton (fresh or cold) minced, one slice of bread soaked in milk, one egg, a little salt and pepper, a dessertspoonful of curry powder. Mix well together, stuff the cucumber with this. Then take two large onions, fry a nice brown ; make a paste of curry powder one ounce, one teaspoonful of sugar, one tablespoonful of vinegar, a cup of stock, a good tablespoonful of dripping (butter is better); simmer in a flat stewing-pot. Arrange the stuffed cucumber in this, and let it simmer on a moderate heat for two hours. Serve with boiled rice. (This is a very nice entree or lunch dish.) CURRY {CUCUMBER). (A Cape Dish.)

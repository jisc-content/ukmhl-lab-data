Roll about a quarter of a pound of butter into one and a half pounds of flour, with the juice of half a lemon; mix with thin cream instead of water; add the yolk and white of one egg; a little water may be added if neces- sary. Roll out thinly and put the butter on in little dabs ; roll out again and spread the rest of the butter, fold up and let it lie for an hour, then use for tarts or savoury pies. This quantity would make crust for a large pie, two or three tarts, etc. Can safely be made the day before it is wanted in cool weather. *94

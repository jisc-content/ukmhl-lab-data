177 PRESERVE (WATER MELON PEEL—MELON). [P lay the slices of melon on a cloth to drain. Now boil the syrup, and pour it boiling hot on the slices of melon, repeating this process every morning for a week ; the last two days put the slices of melon in the preserving pot in which you heat the syrup, and let it boil gently for ten minutes or more, then let it cool. Repeat the next day, and go on till the fruit is quite clear and firm, and the syrup nice and thick. This process diminishes the syrup greatly, and you might make a little more if necessary. This mode of making preserve is rather tedious, but repays one for the trouble; it will keep for years, and becomes beautifully clear and quite firm. (The ginger to be put in a muslin bag, and boiled with the preserve, and taken out the last thing.) PRESERVE (WATER MELON PEEL). Cut the water melon peel in pieces; cut off the outer green peel and all the soft inside, cutting away all the red part; then cut into square pieces or shapes, prick well with a fork; lay the pieces in an earthen basin in lime water—two spoonfuls of lime to four quarts of water. Put a plate on the top to keep it under water; leave all night ; wash well in cold water next morning; put in some cold water; let it boil till you can put a stick into it; now drain. Having previously weighed the peel, take the same weight in sugar; set it on the fire in a saucepan, a layer of peel and a layer of sugar, a few sticks of cinnamon, two or three cups of water; close the lid of the stewpan ; let it simmer till the sugar is melted, then preserve gently (take the lid off if there is a good quantity of syrup). If the water melon was an “American Ice Cream,” it will preserve in two or three hours, and be beautifully crisp and soft, almost melting in your mouth. Four or six cloves to be put into the preserve. PRESERVE {MELON). Made in the same way, only take green melons, while the water melon peel preserve should be from a ripe one. N

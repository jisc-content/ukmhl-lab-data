Mince some chicken with some lean ham, and season with pepper, salt, and a little nutmeg, two tablespoonfuls of cream, or a little butter. Put into scollop-shells, cover with fine bread-crumbs ; set them in the oven to brown, with a small bit of butter on the top of each. CHICKEN {STEWED). (The old Cape way.) Ingredients. young Chickens, or 3 White Onions, tablespoonful Butter and a little clarified Dripping, ij pints of Water. 2 tablespoonfuls of Vermicelli. A few Allspice, Peppercorns, and a tiny bit of Mace (tied in a muslin bag). i tablespoonful Tomato Sauce. The yolk of an Egg. Glass of White Wine. Truss the chickens and stuff them with fine bread- crumbs, a little butter, a slice of white onion, flavoured with a little pepper and sweet herbs. Press down the breast-bone, put a skewer through the wings, in which put the liver and gizzard, and tie the whole together. Stew the chickens in a flat enamelled stewing-pot, with a pint and a half of water, the butter, dripping, onions (cutting two incisions on the top), and a little bag of spice. Turn the chickens breast downward, let them simmer for an hour. Now remove the spices and add vermicelli and tomato sauce. Stew for half an hour, and just before serving add the yolk of an egg whipped with the wineglass of white wine, stirred into the pot, and then poured over the chickens. Serve hot. Turkey done in this way is delicious. CHILLI VINEGAR.

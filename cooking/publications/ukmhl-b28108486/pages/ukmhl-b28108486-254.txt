T] TART (WALNUT)—TEA CAKES. 240 TART (WALNUT). (An old German Cake. Mrs. Van der Riet.) Ingrediefits. A stale Sponge Cake. i pint of Milk. ioo Walnuts. 2 Eggs. 1 spoonful of Sugar. Take a hundred walnuts (or a grated cocoa-nut) ; shell and pound the walnuts—it should be a teacupful. Make a custard of the milk and eggs, and a spoonful of sugar. Add the pounded walnuts, stirring until it thickens, then pour into a basin to cool. Cut your cake in slices (a plain round mould is best), putting them together carefully; then put the bottom piece on a dish, cover it with some of the walnut custard, put the next slice so as to fit, and put on some custard, and so on till the cake is built up again. Of the whites of the eggs make an icing. Ice the whole cake; ornament the top with pieces of walnut and some little bits of icing coloured with cochineal. If cocoa-nut is used instead of walnuts, boil it with sugar into a syrup, as you do cocoa-nut ice. An excellent way of using up a stale sponge cake. TARTLETS (MARMALADE CREAM).

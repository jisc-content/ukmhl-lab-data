(A. homely dish,) Put a quart of milk into a pie-dish ; take half a pint of rice, wash and crush slightly, and put into the milk , set the dish in the oven, with a tin plate over it to prevent scorching. Serve with sugar. Tapioca done in the same way is very good. RISSOLES.—See also “ Frickadels.” RISSOLES, OR CROQUETTES. (Mrs. Fleming.) Mince finely about one and a half pounds of cold meat cold roast beef, fowl, or veal is best; also a few slices of ham, raw or boiled j season with salt, white peppei, nutmeg’, a very tiny shred of onion chopped to powder, and a little chopped parsley. Put two ounces of butter into a stewpan ; when melted stir in gradually a large tablespoonful of flour ; then add a teacupful of milk and the "same quantity of stock. When this is sufficiently cooked to take away the rawness of the flour, stir in the meat, adding two tablespoonfuls of bread-crumbs, three ego-s ’ lightly beaten, a little catsup, tomato sauce, or Worcestershire sauce, and if liked, a little grated lemon- peel. Stir all this for a few minutes in the stewpan, then set it to cool before shaping into balls (which can be nicely formed by pressing them in a wineglass) or into rolls slightly flattened; dip them in egg and roll in crumbs after being formed. Then put into a saucepan as much lard as when melted would cover them ; when the lard boils, drop the rissoles in, and let them get a golden brown. The lard can be used again and again. This mixture is very nice in batter. Very good.

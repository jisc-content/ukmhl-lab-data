121 JELLY (CALVES’ FOOT)—FRUIT IN JELLY. [J JELLY (CALVES’ FOOT). Take four calves’ feet, slit them in two, take away the fat from between the claws, wash them well in lukewarm water, then put them in a large stewpan, and cover them with water. When the liquor boils, skim it well, and let it boil gently six or seven hours, that it may be reduced to about two quarts, then strain it through a sieve, and skim all the oily substance which is on the surface of the liquor. If you are not in a hurry, it is better to boil the calves’ feet the day before you make the jelly, as, when the liquor is cold, the oily part being at the top, and the other being firm, you may remove every particle of the oily substance without wasting any of the liquor with pieces of kitchen paper applied to it. Put the liquor into a stewpan to melt, with a pound of lump sugar, the peel of two lemons, and the juice of six, the whites and shells of six eggs (beat together), and a bottle of sherry or madeira. Whisk the whole together until it is on the boil, then put it at the side of the stove, and let it simmer a quarter of an hour. Strain it through a jelly-bag ; what is strained first must be poured into the bag again, until it is as bright and as clear as spring water. Then put the jelly into moulds to get cold and firm. When it is required to be very stiff, half an ounce of isinglass may be added when the wine is put in. It may be flavoured by the juice of various fruits, etc., or spices, and coloured with saffron, etc. N.B.—Ten sheep’s trotters, which may be bought for twopence-halfpenny, will give as much jelly as a calf’s foot, which costs a shilling. FRUIT IN JELLY. Put an inch of jelly into a mould ; when set, arrange any fruit you like. Put spoonfuls of jelly in between, to keep it in place. It must be done slowly, allowing the jelly to set before adding the fruit. Fill up with jelly. It is an improvement to steep the fruit in maraschino, or brandy, before putting into the jelly.

149 N, “NAARTJE COMFYTP (Mandarin Orange Preserve. From my Grandmother’s Dutch Recipe Book.) Take two pounds more sugar than the weight of the orange. Rasp the naartje with a piece of glass (which prevents it tasting of steel) or a blunt knife; cut two slits across the bottom of the naartje, lay in water for two or three days, giving clean water every day. Boil the syrup, and when tepid pour it over the fruit; leave it for a night; preserve the next day very slowly, only letting it simmer. Repeat the process the third day, then bottle and cork well. NASTURTIUM SEEDS USED AS CAPERS. Gather the seeds before they are too hard, keep them for a day or two with salt sprinkled over them, then put them into empty pickle bottles; pour boiling vinegar over them and leave them to cool. When cold, cork closely. The nasturtium flowers are very nice to eat with bread and cheese, and butter ; and look very pretty to hand round on a separate plate, with the cheese and butter, after dinner.

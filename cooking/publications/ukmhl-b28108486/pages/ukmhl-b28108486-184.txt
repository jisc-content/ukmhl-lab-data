P] PIGGIE, OR SUCKING-PIG-POLISH. 170 PIGGIE, OR SUCKING-PIG. (A very favourite Cape Dish.) When the piggie has been well cleaned and washed, make a stuffing of bread-crumbs, suet, some dried sage leaves, pepper, salt, lemon-peel. If eggs are plentiful, then moisten with an egg and some water. Stuff the pig, sew up with strong thread ; truss it as a hare is trussed, with its fore-legs skewered back and its hind-legs forward. Lay it on a trivet, in a dripping-pan, with a pint of water in the pan. Rub the piggie all over with butter (or sheep- tail fat), and set it in a hot oven. Will take two hours. I have heard that rubbing the piggie all over with the white of egg, before roasting, makes it nice and crisp. POLISH FOR FLOORS. (Home Recipe.) If your floors are white, scrub and scour well with strong soda; stain with oak staining or Vandyke brown, which can be ground in water and mixed with a little size. Go over the boards twice; let the floor get quite dry, then polish with beeswax and turpentine. Scrape the bees- wax and any remains of sperm candles in a round basin. Cover the wax with spirits of turpentine; leave all night. The next day the wax will be dissolved, and the mixture have a creamy appearance. Rub well into the boards with a piece of flannel, and polish by friction. A soft linen cloth gives a better polish than flannel. When done three times, an ordinary deal floor will have a beautiful polished surface. POLISH (FOR CLEANING AND POLISHING COVERS AND TINS). Shred half a pound of blue mottled soap in a jug; add half a cup of finely powdered whiting, pour in sufficient water to make it the consistency of thick cream. Rub well over the covers, and polish with a clean leather and powdered whiting.

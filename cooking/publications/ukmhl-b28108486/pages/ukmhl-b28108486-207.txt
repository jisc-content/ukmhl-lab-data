A tiny pinch of Salt. 3 Eggs. 1 teaspoonful of Vanilla Essence 2 tablespoonfuls of Sugar. or a bit of Cinnamon, or 20 3 breakfast-cups of Milk. drops of Essence of Almonds. A dessertspoonful of Butter. Set the milk to boil with the sugar, keeping half a cup to mix with the maizena and butter and the yolks of the eggs. When the milk boils pour in the maizena, etc.; stir till quite done, which can be told by the maizena coming off from the bottom of the saucepan. Have ready the whites stirred to a stiff froth, draw the saucepan to the side ; let the whites lie on the boiling mixture for a minute or two before stirring it lightly with the pudding, then pour into a wetted mould ; turn out when cold.

Very good cold pudding. o

230 S] SOUP (TOMATO)—SPRITZE—STEAK (PICKLED). SOUP (TOMATO). (My own Recipe.) Take about a dozen nice ripe tomatoes, boil quite tender, with an onion ; mash, and strain. Add to two quarts of good stock ; thicken with a pat of butter rolled in flour; flavour with a green chilli, cut up, just before serving. SPRITZE. (Another Dutch Sped a HR.) Ingredie7its. 3 lb. of Flour. $ lb. Butter. 10 Eggs. 2 bottles of Milk. Boil the butter and milk, stir in the flour and a quarter of a pound of sugar. Pour the paste in a dish, and when cold mix ten eggs with it; beat well till it drops clean off a spoon. Let it drop into a saucepan of boiling lard or fat in tiny balls. Fry a nice brown. Serve with sugar and pounded and sifted cinnamon. The old Dutch people had a tin through which they pressed the dough into the boiling fat. (Another recipe says, one pound of flour to eight eggs, a quarter of a pound of butter, and one pint of milk.) STEAK (PICKLED). Lay two pounds of steak in a dish with sliced onions, half a dozen cloves, two dozen whole pepper, a bay leaf, sprig of thyme, marjoram, and parsley, a tablespoonful of salad oil, tarragon vinegar enough just to come up to the steak; let it soak for twelve hours, turning occasionally. Then take it out, and grill the steak in a hot pan, turning constantly. Stew the mixture, add a teaspoonful of salt, and let the steak simmer in it, taking out the spices, etc., before serving in a hot dish. Enough for six people.

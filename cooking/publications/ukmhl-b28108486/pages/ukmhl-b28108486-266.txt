V] VENISON—VEGETABLE MARROW STUFFED. VENISON. (My own Recipe.) The “ Duiker” is considered very good, and also the “ Springbok,” which, however, is very rare in the western province of South Africa. The forequarter is generally used for “Buck soup ” ; the saddle (cut like a saddle of mutton) being the best joint for roasting, and must hang for six or seven days. After the outer skin is taken off, there still remains a thin white fleece, which must be taken off before larding the venison. Take a firm piece of fat bacon cut into equal strips, and proceed to lard either with a larding-needle or pointed knife. Venison is much nicer roasted in a flat Dutch baking-pot, with a good piece of butter and a spoonful of good lard or fat. Put the joint on with a little water. I f a saddle, turn it upper side down at first, and an hour after- wards put some wood-coals on the cover of the pot. Having basted the joint well, roast it a nice brown, and half an hour before serving pour over it a tumbler of dark wine and a little vinegar, with a dessertspoonful of flour mixed in them. Stir the gravy well. This gives a nice glaze to the meat, and imparts a very good flavour. If done in an oven, cover the joint with a buttered paper and baste frequently. The “ Steenbok ” and “Grysbok” are very plentiful in some districts, and are very good to eat too. VEGETABLE MARROW STUFFED. (Entree. Mrs. D. Cloete’s Recipe.) Ingredients. 1 lb.

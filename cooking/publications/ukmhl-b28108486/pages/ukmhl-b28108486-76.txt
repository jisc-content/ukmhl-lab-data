62 E] EGGS (ITALIAN—POACHED—SCRATCHED). EGGS (ITALIAN). (Mrs. Fleming’s Recipe.) Hard-boiled eggs, cut in two, the yolks to be taken out, minced, and mixed with very finely minced cooked bacon, and some chopped parsley; put back into the whites arranged on a dish. Serve with mayonnaise dressing. To be eaten cold. EGGS (POACHED). Eggs for poaching should be fresh, but not new-laid, or the whites will not set. A stale egg will not poach. The best are about thirty-six hours old. Strain boiling water into a deep, clean frying-pan. Break the egg into a cup, without damaging the yolk. When the water boils, gently slip the egg into it. Keep the water gently • simmering till the white looks nicely set; take up gently with a slice. Serve on toasted bread or slices of ham on spinach. (In slipping the egg into the water keep the cup over it for half a minute, so as to gather the whites together.) In doing eggs in a frying-pan never do more than four or five at a time. If liked, mix one tablespoonful of vinegar in the water in which you poach, one pint for an ordinary-sized frying-pan. Time, two and a half or three and a half minutes. EGGS (SCRATCHED). (A favourite Colonial breakfast dish.) Take five or six eggs, whisk them well together; take a dessertspoonful of butter in a frying-pan, let it get quite hot. Stir in the eggs ; keep stirring briskly over the fire till done. Serve on hot buttered toast with pepper and salt.

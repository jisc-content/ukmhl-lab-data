[I INVALID COOKERY. INVALID COOKERY (continued). STRENGTHENING JELLY. Ingredients. i oz. Gum Arabic. 1 a Nutmeg, grated. Sugar to taste. x pint of Port Wine. 2 oz. Isinglass. 2 oz. White Wine. Put these ingredients in a jar, tie it over; put the jar into a saucepan of warm water, let it remain in the saucepan till all is dissolved ; it must be stirred constantly. When cold it will be a firm jelly. Give the invalid a piece the size of a nutmeg at a time. Take the juice of two oranges, and peel of one, the yolks of four eggs, an ounce of isinglass (or a stiff jelly, procured from calves’ feet or sheep’s trotters, about one pint), half a pint of sherry or white wine, one wineglass of good cognac, ten cloves, a little cinnamon, and two tablespoonfuls of sugar. Stir all well together, put into a stewpan. When it boils up draw it aside for five minutes ; pour in two tablespoonfuls of cold water. Strain through a jelly-bag. Use good sherry, and freshly laid eggs. Boil two knuckles of veal in three quarts of milk till reduced to a half. Flavour with a little mace or nutmeg, salt to be added when done. Half this quantity does at a time. Take two pounds of good lean mutton or beef. Pass twice through a mincing-machine so that every particle is well mashed. Set it on the fire with two quarts of water. Let it boil slowly for three hours or more, so that it is reduced to one quart or less. Add salt, and any flavouring that is liked ; a few peppercorns and allspice. Strain through a gravy strainer before serving. A WINE JELLY FOR INVALIDS. STRENGTHENING SOUP. SOUP FOR INVALIDS.

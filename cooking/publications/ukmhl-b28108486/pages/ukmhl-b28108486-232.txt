Mix with a little salt, a teaspoonful of vinegar, a teaspoonful of sugar, and a tablespoonful of cream. Good with cold beef or mutton. Put the yolks with pepper, salt, etc., in a round-bottomed basin; stir with a wooden spoon, adding first salad oil, then vinegar, cream, etc. until all looks like thick cream. Will keep if closely corked. SAUCE {ONION), FOR SHOULDER OF MUTTON. Peel four or five white onions, put them in salt and water for half an hour; then boil in a saucepan, well covered with water, till soft; drain thoroughly; chop fine; mix with melted butter, according to the previous recipe for melted butter. This is a delicious sauce for boiled leg or shoulder of mutton. About one and a half dozen oysters, raw or potted, to half a pint of good melted butter; a seasoning of cayenne pepper. Cream used instead of milk is a great improvement. SAUCE (PARSLEY). Two spoonfuls of chopped parsley added to melted butter or white sauce. SAUCE (MAYONNAISE). (Mrs. Jackson’s Recipe.)

207 ROUND OF BEEF (SPICED). LR the pan with a cloth. The bone must be taken out and the meat hung for twelve hours to make it tender When it is to be dressed, dip it into water to take off the oose spice, and bind it round with tape. Put it into a large pot with a teacupful of water at the bottom ; cover the top'of the meat with shred suet, a brown crust, and paper over the whole. Bake for five or six hours. The gravy can be kept for flavouring soup or hash. Very good.

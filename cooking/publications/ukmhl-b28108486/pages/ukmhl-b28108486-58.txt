Take one large onion, cut small, fry a nice brown ; a tablespoonful of butter or dripping mixed, two green apples or a large quince (if not at hand, take two or three tomatoes), cut in slices ; simmer with a large tablespoonful of curry powder and the fried onion, a tablespoonful of vinegar or lemon, a dessertspoonful of sugar, half a cup of stock, and a little milk. Cut up some cold meat in nice little pieces, lay in this mixture, and simmer for an hour or more till the meat is thoroughly flavoured with the curry paste. Serve with hot boiled rice. Any cold boiled or roast meat will do. N.B.—Half an ounce of tamarinds, soaked in boiling water and strained, gives a delicious acid flavour to curry, and may always be substituted for vinegar.

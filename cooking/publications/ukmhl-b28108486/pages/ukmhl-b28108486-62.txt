48 C] CUTLETS—LAMB CUTLETS—CUTLETS (STEWED). CUTLETS. Trim your cutlets carefully; lay them in a little milk, which makes the meat white and tender. (Fresh meat laid for five or six hours in a little milk will be found nice and tender.) Have ready some fine bread-crumbs, nutmeg, pepper, salt, lard, or dripping. Roll the cutlets in egg and bread-crumbs, sprinkle with pepper, salt, and nutmeg, fry in hot lard. Serve with mashed potatoes. When tomatoes are plentiful, boil about a dozen with a small piece of onion ; strain, add a pat of butter, and serve round the cutlets. LAMB CUTLETS AND GREEN PEAS. Ingredients. 3 lbs. of the best end of Neck of Lamb. 2 Eggs. Bread-crumbs. Pepper, Salt, a little Nutmeg. Some Beef or Mutton Dripping, or Lard. Cut the cutlets from the best end of the neck. Chop off the thick part of the chine bone ; trim the cutlets neatly by taking off the skin and greater part of the fat, and scraping the upper end of the bone perfectly clean. Brush each cutlet with well-beaten yolk of egg, sprinkle them with fine bread-crumbs seasoned with pepper, salt, and nutmeg. After this dip them separately into clarified butter, sprinkle more crumbs over them, then fry a nice brown in a frying-pan with either butter, or lard, or dripping. Serve with a nicely-boiled dish of green peas arranged in a pyramid in the middle of the dish. Can also be served with tomato sauce. Time, eight or ten minutes for cooking. CUTLETS (STEWED). (A homely, nice dish.) Cut and trim your cutlets, roll them in fine bread- crumbs flavoured with nutmeg, pepper, salt, the tiniest shred of onion; lay them in a flat pot in layers. Cover the pot well, let them simmer for an hour. Put no water. A little before serving, stir in a little cup of stock, a spoonful of tomato sauce, and a tiny pat of butter. Let the cutlets simmer in this for a few minutes and then serve.

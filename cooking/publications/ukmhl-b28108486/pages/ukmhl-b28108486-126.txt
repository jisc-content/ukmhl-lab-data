I] INVALID COOKERY. 112 INVALID COOKERY (continued). CUSTARD PUDDING. Few invalids ever tire of the plain, old-fashioned custard pudding made in this way : Two eggs, well whipped, mixed with one pint of milk and a spoonful of sugar; bake in an oven, standing the basin in a tin dish with water in it to prevent it curding. The Schaum pudding (see PUDDINGS) is another favourite with most people.

[P PEARS (STEWED)—PICKLE (CABBAGE). 165 PEARS {STEWED). (Mrs. Etheridge’s Recipe.) For every pound of pears take half a pound of sugar (soft white) to make a syrup, taking the same quantity of water as sugar. Boil till clear, pour boiling hot over the pears; cover the stewing-pan close. Then boil briskly at first, then moderately, for four or five hours. Add the juice and peel of a lemon ; when nearly done, a glass of dark wine. Excellent. PEAS {GREEN), TO BOIE Shell your peas as soon as you have gathered them {if possible). For a large vegetable dish of peas take a quart of water, into which put a pinch of salt, a tiny pinch of carbonate of soda. Boil for fifteen minutes, if young and fresh, in an open saucepan. When tender drain through a colander, and put into a dish with a piece of butter, and if the peas have been gathered some time before being shelled they will have lost their sweetness, in which case add a teaspoonful of sugar. Shake well together in the dish, and keep the dish on the top of the saucepan for five minutes to melt the butter and sugar before serving. PICKLE {CABBAGE). (An old Dutch Recipe.)

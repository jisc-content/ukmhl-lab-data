145 MUTTON CHOPS (IN BATTERâ€”ANOTHER WAY). [M MUTTON CHOPS. (A favourite Cape dish.) Cut some nice chops, either from a loin or neck of mutton that has been well hung; beat them well with a wooden kitchen mallet; then dip in boiling fat or lard, then in bread-crumbs (made by drying stale bread in an oven, and pounding it, and keeping ready for use), or fine biscuit, some pepper and salt. Have ready your gridiron, well heated on wood coals ; lay your chops on this, and broil a nice brown over a quick fire, turning occasionally. Serve with a mould of mashed potatoes or tomato sauce. Very good. Pork chops done in the same way are very good. MUTTON CHOPS IN BATTER. (A Colonial Recipe.) Cut from a tender leg of mutton (uncooked), or loin, nice little slices. Season with pepper, salt, and a little nutmeg. Dip in a batter made of half a pint of milk, three tablespoonfuls of flour, and two eggs (if eggs are scarce, flour mixed with thick milk and half a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda makes a very light, nice batter). Fry in hot dripping or lard, as you would a cutlet. MUTTON CHOPS IN BATTER (ANOTHER WAY). (For Cold Mutton.) From a cold leg of mutton cut slices an eighth of an inch thick. Beat up an egg, stir in a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce ; dip each slice in this, roll in bread- crumbs. Fry quickly. Serve with fried or mashed potatoes. L

When well warmed spread on hot buttered toast. Serve. Another similar breakfast dish is as follows : Put into a stewpan three tablespoonfuls of cream or milk, some grated tongue, beef, pepper, and salt. When hot put in four eggs, well beaten; stir all the time till the mixture is quite thick. Have some buttered toast, spread the mixture on, and send to table very hot. HAM.—See Omelet (Ham). HARE (JUGGED). 1 Hare. A few Sweet Herbs. 2 Onions. 4 Cloves. 6 Whole Allspice. Ingredients. teaspoonful of Black Pepper, A strip of Lemon-Peel. Thickening of Butter and Flour. 2 tablespoonfuls of Mushroom Ketchup. J pint of Port or other dark Wine. Skin and wash the hare nicely ; cut it up into joints, not too large ; dredge with flour, and fry in butter a nice brown ; then put into a stewing-pan with the herbs, onions, cloves, allspice, pepper, and lemon-peel; cover with hot water, and when it boils carefully remove all the scum, and let it simmer gently till tender (which will be in about one hour and three-quarters if the hare is old). Then take out the pieces of hare, thicken the gravy with flour and butter, add the ketchup and port wine, let it boil ten minutes; strain through a sieve on the pieces of hare. Let it simmer for two minutes, so as to be nice and warm. A few forcemeat balls (see Forcemeat Recipe) stewed in the gravy ten minutes before dishing, is an improve- ment. Serve with quince or red currant jelly.

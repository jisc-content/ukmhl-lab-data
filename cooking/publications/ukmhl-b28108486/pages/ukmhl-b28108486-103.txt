89 H. HAMS (.HOW TO CURE THEM). (Proved by long experience to be an excellent Recipe.) After cutting the hams, rough-salt them for a night, letting all the water drain away. For a ham weighing twelve or fourteen pounds take as follows: two pounds of salt, one pound brownest sugar, two ounces saltpetre, four ounces black pepper, four ounces allspice, and a handful of coriander seeds. Bruise the spices and saltpetre, mix all well with the salt, and have the ham rubbed well with the hand and a little flat stone for half an hour every day for three days, till the skin feels soft, and the salt, etc., looks like a creamy substance. In rubbing divide the salt, sugar, etc., into portions, and take a fresh portion every time, taking care to turn the ham skin downwards, and cover with the salt, etc. When all has been used, and the ham rubbed three days, take all the brine that has formed and boil it with two pints of vinegar and two pints of good ale. Skim it well, and when cool pour over the ham, leaving it in this pickle for a month. Then dry it, put under a press, brush with a little tar mixed with treacle and some bran. Smoke for three weeks, and hang in a cool, dry place. The above pickle does beautifully for sides of bacon, or any other pork that has to be smoked. When wanted for use, before boiling soak the ham for a night, simmer gently for three or four hours. Let your water boil before putting in the ham, and then gently simmer.

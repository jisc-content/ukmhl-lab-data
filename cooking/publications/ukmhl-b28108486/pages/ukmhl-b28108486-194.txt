PRESERVE {TOMATO). (Mrs. Ahren’s Recipe.) Take middle-sized fruit; prick and cut an incision at the bottom. Lay in lime water for a night (a tablespoonful of lime in two bottles of water) ; the next day in a little salt water. Preserve in an equal quantity of sugar. Oil the saucepan, then put in layers of fruit and sugar alter- nately, and boil slowly. Half an ounce of ginger in a muslin bag to be added during the boiling, and taken out when done. PRESERVE (GREEN TOMATOES). Take six pounds of green, unripe tomatoes, eight pounds of sugar, boiled to a syrup, and four lemons, the rind very thinly cut and the juice squeezed. First boil the tomatoes gently till quite tender, but don't let them break. In the wrater in which the fruit is boiled put about two or three dozen green peach leaves ; drain, after taking out. Make a syrup, and put the toma- toes in it cold. Put in two or three pieces of ginger in a bag and the lemon-peel; let it boil slowly till quite clear, then take out the ginger. Just before taking the preserve off the fire add about two tablespoonfuls of brandy. PUDDINGS.—See “ Chippolata ” and “ Spritze.”

Take nine sponge biscuits ; slice thinly; soak in half a wineglass of Vanderhum, or the syrup in which peaches have been preserved. Garnish a buttered porcelain mould with little bits of citron preserve, tomato preserve, or Cape gooseberry ; then put in a layer of soaked biscuits. Have ready any kind of preserve, such as yellow peaches (pre- served in brandy), water-melon, or ginger (cut small) ; put in a layer of preserve; then some more soaked sponge biscuits; pour over the whole the custard (which must be warm), to fill the mould, and let it stand over-night.

Take four sheep’s kidneys; with a sharp knife cut each kidney open lengthways down to the root, but do not separate them ; skin them, and put a small skewer under the white part of each to keep them flat. Make the grid- iron warm and rub it over with butter ; place the kidneys with the inside downwards, and broil them over a clear fire. When sufficiently done on one side, turn on the other. Remove the skewers, season with pepper and salt, put a little piece of butter in the centre of each, and serve on a piece of well-buttered toast. They must be sent to table as hot as possible.

INTRODUCTION. It was at the suggestion of some friends in England— who had spent a few years at the Cape, and who have ever since shown a kindly interest in South Africa—that I have collected some homely and old-fashioned recipes from relations and friends, and from practical housewives some simple and dainty dishes. I trust that to some old friends in England my little book may bring back recollections of days spent at the Cape; and to my country cousins and far-off friends in South Africa—who, in the rush of life, have not found leisure to copy their mothers’ and grandmothers’ old recipe- books—this collection may prove useful. Few Colonial cooks of the present day understand the art of cooking ; it is therefore absolutely necessary for the lady of the house to know something about it, so that she can direct them. Let us look at some of the simplest terms. Simmering (to bring as near as possible to boiling without letting it boil) is one of the great difficulties. Cooks will not remember how much depends on slow cooking. Hashes, Curries, “ Bredees,” etc., etc., must simmer.

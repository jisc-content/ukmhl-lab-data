T. “ TAMELETTJES. (A favourite Cape Sweet.) For two basins of sugar take one basin of water, boil into a syrup, clarify with an egg, boil briskly till it is all frothy; then fill little square paper shapes or ramaquin cases with this, after having mixed it with some almonds and grated lemon-peel, or naartje (Tangerine orange) peek Let it cool before serving. Line a tin dish with puff paste, peel and quarter one dozen apples, lay them in the dish, also some blanched and pounded almonds, half a bottle of milk, butter beaten to a cream, four eggs, and one cup of sugar, and some cinnamon to taste, all mixed together, poured into the dish, covering the apples. Bake in an oven for an hour and more. I have found that anything requiring some time to bake must be covered with a tin plate at first, which can be removed when half-done. TAPIOCA.—See Rice Milk.

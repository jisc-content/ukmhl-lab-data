s. SADDLE OF MUTTON. The best joint at the Cape is a twelve pound saddle of mutton. When hung for four days it is most beautifully tender, resembling Welsh mutton. It is easily cooked by the most ignorant of cooks. Wash and wipe dry; dust with flour, salt, and pepper, and put into a baking-pan in a hot stove oven for two hours, basting occasionally. Serve with quince or red currant jelly. SALAD DRESSING. (Mrs. Spenceâ€™s Recipe.)

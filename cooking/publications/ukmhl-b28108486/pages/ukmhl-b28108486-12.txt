INTRODUCTION. viii Fry the onion with the meat, a light brown (ffsmoor/5 as Cape cooks say). This must be done rather quickly; then the meat must simmer with whatever ingredient you like to add. The old Cape families of Dutch descent, who had Malay and Indian cooks, and many of French descent, understood the art of ROASTING. They roast their Chickens, Partridges, Quail, Wild Duck, Venison, etc., not in an oven, but in a flat, round pot, about five and a half inches deep (Dutch baking-pot), with a raised lid. The meat is put into the pot with, say, half a pint of water, and the pot is put on the stove. About half an hour afterwards some live coals are put on the lid, and just before the joint or chicken begins to brown it is basted well with a little butter or dripping. Half an hour before serving the cook should pour half a tumbler of red wine, well mixed with a small dessertspoonful of flour, over the joint or chicken, while giving the gravy a good stir. This gives a delicious flavour to any Poultry or Venison. A leg of Mutton done in a Dutch baking-pot in this way is very good. In BOILING meat, a leg of Mutton, or Chicken, etc., be very careful that the water boils when you put it in, and then let it simmer. The meat will be tender and juicy— this is my experience.

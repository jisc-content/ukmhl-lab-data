[H HOME REMEDIES. HOME REMEDIES (continued). FOR NEURALGIA. Take a drachm of citrate of quinine and iron to a bottle of water. Take a tablespoonful in water three times a day. FOR WHITE SORE THROAT. Take half an ounce of chloride of potash, dissolved in a quart bottle of water. One tablespoonful three times a day. For a child of seven or eight, four grains of chloride of potash, in a little water, four times a day. FOR SORE THROAT—ANOTHER REMEDY. Four drops of sulphuric acid in a wineglass of water three or four times a day. I have heard that burning equal quantities of tar and turpentine (about two tablespoonfuls of each in a tin cup or pan) in the room of the patient suffering from diphtheria gives great relief. Families living far from medical aid should always keep Swedish tar, turpentine, and sulphuric acid in their houses. FOR DIPHTHERIC THROAT—GARGLE. A few drops of a strong solution of permanganate of potash, in water, make an excellent gargle. FOR SPASMS, OR ANY INTERNAL PAINS. Put a quarter of a pound of mixed cloves and allspice, some ginger, and cinnamon, on a quart bottle of the best brandy; let it stand in the sun, or by the fire, for a few days, till all the goodness is drawn out of the spices. Dose for an adult, one teaspoonful; for a child, ten drops in wineglass of water; or dropped on hot flannel, and applied externally, it will be found very effectual also. H 37

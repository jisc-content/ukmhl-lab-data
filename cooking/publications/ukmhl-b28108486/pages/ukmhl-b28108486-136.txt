J] JELLY (GUAVA—MEDLAR—QUINCE). 122 JELLY [GUAVA). (Mrs. Hiddingh’s Recipe.) Take nice ripe guavas, pee] them, cut them through, and just cover them with water. When quite soft, pour them into a large, coarse bag, something like a jelly-bag; leave it to drain all night. Next day, convert into jelly by adding to every two cups of the juice, when it boils, one cup of sugar. Boil briskly till the consistency of jelly. Pour a little into a tumbler of cold water; if it does not mix with the water, it is ready to be poured into moulds or jars. JELLY {MEDLAR). (A Swellendam Recipe.) / Let the medlars be quite soft; cut off the tops, put in a preserving-pan, cover with water, boil six or eight hours slowly, strain through a coarse sieve. To every pint of juice add one pound of sugar. Boil over a quick fire, stirring all the time. When it thickens, drop on a plate ; if it jellies it is done. Or drop into a tumbler of cold water; if it does not mix with the water it is good. This jelly is delicious, and ought to be a clear amber colour. JELLY {QUINCE). (Mrs. Cloete’s, of Constantia, Recipe.) Take about twenty-five quinces, wipe them clean, cut in quarters, lay in a large preserving-pot, cover with water (about six quarts to twenty-five quinces) ; boil till quite soft, then strain through a thin cloth or coarse milk strainer. To three cups of juice take two of white sugar ; boil in small quantities on a brisk fire. When it begins to get thick, pour a little into a tumbler of water; and if it congeals, and does not mix with the water, it is ready to be put into moulds or cups. Cover with paper dipped in brandy, and keep in a dry place. Will keep for years.

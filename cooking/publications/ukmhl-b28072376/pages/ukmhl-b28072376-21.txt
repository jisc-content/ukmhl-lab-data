CHAPTER II. CANNING- AND BOTTLING. The success of this process depends on heating the material to he canned till all germs are destroyed, then sealing it up till air-tight whilst it is boiling hot. You may can in two ways. 1. boil the fruit in the preserving pan either in syrup or water, till thoroughly cooked, then pour it scalding hot into the bottles, and pass the handle of a spoon down the sides of the bottle to set free any air-bubbles that may have been left in it; then wipe the neck of the bottle with a warm moist cloth, put the rubber ring on in its place, and fasten it down tightly according to the style of bottle you use, tightening it down again when cold. It should be held upside down after filling, to see if it is really air-tigbt (if it is not the syrup or liquid will exude), in which case it can be put away.

The drying frames can easily be made at home, as they only consist of four thin laths nailed together to fit the oven, and then covered with coarse canvas or sacking strained over them. Mushrooms, though susceptible of exactly the same treatment as other vegetables, are preserved generally somewhat differently from other vegetables, there- fore, various methods are here given.

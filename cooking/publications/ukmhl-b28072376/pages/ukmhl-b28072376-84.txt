Keep this closely covered and at the end of the time filter and bottle off in little bottles. Or Spirit of Bosolio.—Infuse for a fortnight fifty grammes of fresh orange blossom petals, five grammes of cinnamon, two of mace, two of cloves, ten grammes of rose and jessamine petals, half the thinly pared rind of one citron and one lemon, and a morsel of vanilla in a full quart of spirit, then filter and bottle. The addition of sufficient cold, clear syrup to taste will convert any of these so- called “ spirits ” into very nice liqueurs.

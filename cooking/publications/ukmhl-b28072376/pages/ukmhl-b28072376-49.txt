JAMS, JELLIES, AND PASTES. 37 to run easily, it should be at once put into pots. Jam must always be boiled fast, as slow cooking in- variably spoils the colour, and, as long as fruit and sugar are being cooked together, the preserving pan must not be left. The jam must be kept constantly and gently stirred the whole time it is cooking, and the scum must be carefully removed as it rises. The difficulty about jam making for the beginner is that experience is indispensable, as the fruit varies so much each year that no hard and fast rules can be given. Again, remember that, if the fruit is boiled before adding the sugar, it must be carefully watched, for, if allowed to thicken too much, the sugar, when added, will neither melt properly, nor throw up its scum as it should do, and in some seasons when the fruit is very good the juice thickens up almost in a minute, so attention is needed. It must be re- membered that these directions are given on the understanding that the best cane sugar is used. Inferior sugar takes longer, as it throws up far more scum than the best clarified sugar will do, and this in itself is a waste, as a certain proportion of jam is bound to rise with the scum, and so be wasted. The question as to quantities is another very anxious one for the beginner. The old rule was equal weights of fruit and sugar, and this is, on the whole, i very safe one ; but in these days many per- sons consider jam made in these proportions too luscious, and prefer three quarters of a pound of sugar to the one pound of fruit, and in this case the rule of boiling up the fruit well before adding the sugar, should be strictly adhered to.

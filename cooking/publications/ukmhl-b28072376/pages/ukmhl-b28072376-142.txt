PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 130 can; return this juice to the pan with l|lb. pure cane sugar to each quart of juice, stir it well till the sugar melts, then skim it very carefully, putting the shim- mings on a sieve, and return the juice that strains through to the preserving pan ; let it stand till cold, then for each quart of this syrup allow one and a half pints of best white wine vinegar, adding, if it is to keep, from half to a pint of plain spirit to each gal- lon of the vinegar. Red currant vinegar is made in precisely the same way. Gooseberry Vinegar. — Choose the hairy goose- berries, either red or green, when full ripe. Break down the fruit with a wooden pestle, and allow lib. of crushed cane loaf sugar to each 21b. of fruit. Let it all stand for two hours, then turn it all into the preserving pan and scald till the juice runs free. Now run it through a jelly bag wrung out of warm vinegar, and to this juice allow a gill of plain spirit or brandy to each quart of juice, and then mix with it all an equal quantity of best white wine vinegar. Mulberry Vinegar.—Put into an unglazed earthen- ware pan 61b. of ripe, sound mulberries, and pour over them enough good vinegar to cover them; let them soak, covered, for twenty-four hours, then crush them with a clean wooden spoon, and again cover them with a cloth for another twenty-four hours; again bruise them, mixing them well, and add in more vinegar till a gallon has been used altogether. When this has stood for a week (mind it is well stir- red up every day), strain off the liquid, and to each pint add lib. of cane loaf sugar, and boil it all up

158 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. and mix it to a paste with about a gill of new milk or single cream. Saucisse an Vin.—Prepare a farce as for the truffled sausage, only moistening it with champagne, Madeira, or any good Rhine wine as you please. A variation of this is made by mincing two parts lean to one of fat pork, and seasoning this with a pinch of saltpetre, pepper, salt, and a fairly strong flavour- ing of aromatics, such as juniper berries, marjoram, thyme, coriander, &c. Work these ingredients well together, moistening them with half a pint of light white wine, or best white wine vinegar ; fill, and tie in the usual way, then hang them up for five days in a cool, dry place ; even in summer these sausages re- quire keeping forty-eight hours before eating them. Smtcisse an foie gras.—Por this take any delicate sausage mixture, such as the one made with veal (but without bread), and to each pound of the sausage farce allow from 2oz. to 4oz. of foie gras, previously sieved, and, of course, add some sliced truffles. In private houses these are made very small, but in France this reckons amongst the saucissons, and is made as thick as a man’s wrist; the skins also are dyed with a little liquid carmine before the meat is put in; the sausages are then steamed till cooked (from half to three-quarters of an hour), and then left till thoroughly cold, when the outside is brushed well over with boiled olive oil, or else the sausage is dipped bodily into melted white paraffin wax. Either of these processes ensures its keeping for a certain time, but these sausages are delicate.

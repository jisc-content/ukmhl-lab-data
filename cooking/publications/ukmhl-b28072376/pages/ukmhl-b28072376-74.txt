PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 62 Damson Cordial.—Prick some sound, ripe damsons all over with a needle, then pack them into wide mouthed bottles, in alternate layers of fruit and caster sugar; when the bottle is half full put in a lemon and an orange sliced or chopped (remove the pips), six or eight cloves, a small bit of cinnamon, joz. whole ginger, and a vanilla bean. Now fill up the bottle with fruit and sugar as before, and pour on to it a bottleful of the best gin, cork tightly, and keep in a dark place for six months. Ducalyqqtus Liqueur.—Put into a jar lib. of dried eucalyptus leaves, lfoz. juniper berries, 2oz. orange- flowers, and a quart of spirit; close it down tightly, and infuse for fourteen days, shaking it daily for a week; then strain, mix with a pint of clear syrup, filter, and bottle off. Gin, Cherry.—Stalk lib. of cherries, and scald (but do not boil) them in a quart of syrup, then lay them in wide-mouthed bottles, and pour on to them a quart of good unsweetened gin, and two quarts of svrup, including that in which they were scalded, and a bottle of essence of cherries; cork down closely. It is ready for use almost at once, but improves by keeping. Filter as wanted. Damson.—Choose ripe, sound fruit, and prick them in several places with a darning needle. Have ready, clean, dry, and wide-mouthed bottles, and drop in the damsons, about half filling them, and shaking in, as you do so, from lfoz. to 2oz. of crushed sugar-candy, and the kernels of five or six damsons, or as many bitter almonds (shred), and fill up with good unsweetened gin; cork the bottles

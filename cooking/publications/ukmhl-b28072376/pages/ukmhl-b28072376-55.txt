43 JAMS, JELLIES, AND PASTES. Raw Currant Jelly.—Crusli the juice from fine, full-ripe, red currants with a new wooden spoon through a delicately clean sieve. For each pint of this juice take a pound of double-refined cane loaf sugar, broken and dipped till saturated with cold watei% and boiled to candy (i.e., till almost back to sugar again) ; then lift the pan from the fire, pour the currant juice to it, stirring it in quickly till it is all well mixed, then at once pour into small glass jars, and let these stand for a fortnight (before covering down) in a dry place, or in the sun, with just a paper laid over them to keep off the dust; then bladder them down, but on no account put any paper next the jelly, or it will crust the top. This is an old family recipe, over 100 years old, and jelly made by it has often kept for ten or twelve years. Strawberry Jelly.—Place the freshly gathered and stalked fruit in the preserving-pan over a clear slow fire; let the juice flow freely, stirring it all now and again with a silver or new wooden spoon, till it has been pretty well all extracted; then allow it to simmer gently for twenty-five to thirty minutes (but no longer, or it would thicken too much) ; now strain off the juice, weigh it, and then again boil it up sharply for twelve to fifteen minutes, stirring it constantly. Then lift the pan from the fire, and mix in, little by little, 12oz. of cane sugar to each pint of juice, being careful each lot is dissolved before the next is added in. When the juice and sugar are thoroughly blended, return the pan to the fire, and boil it sharply together till it will jelly when lifted in the spoon.

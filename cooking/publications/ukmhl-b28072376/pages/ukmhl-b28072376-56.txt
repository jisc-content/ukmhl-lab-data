PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 44 Guava Jelly (Mode).— Stew some perfectly ripe medlars in a stewpan, well covered with water, till thoroughly cooked (this will take several hours), when they must be turned into a jelly bag and the juice allowed to run through at its leisure, without the slightest pressure. When it has all run through, weigh it, and boil with an equal weight of broken up cane loaf sugar till quite clear, keeping it well stirred and skimmed; as it cools, pour it into glass jars, and when cold it should be a firm stiff jelly. Quince Jelly.—Peel, halve, and core the fruit, weigh it, and take a pint of cold spring water to every pound of fruit, dropping the latter into this as quickly as possible; let it all simmer together till the fruit is broken, but not mashed, or the colour will be ruined. Now run it all through the jelly bag at its leisure, being careful not to press or meddle with it in any way while the juice is running through ; when all the juice is extracted, weigh it, and boil in a delicately clean preserving pan for fifteen to twenty minutes, then for each pint of juice, when weighed, add three-quarters to one pound of cane loaf sugar (according to the ripeness and sweetness of the fruit), and boil it all up together again for ten or fifteen minutes, keeping it most carefully skimmed. Directly it jellies on the spoon pour it into pots or moulds. Quince Jam is a very good preserve, prepared thus: procure some juice as above from inferior fruit, then add half a pint of this juice to each pound of fruit, weighed after peeling, halving, and coring, and finish off in the usual way.

PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 108 the outside. Boil together half a gallon of vinegar for every hundred walnuts, with a tea-spoonful of salt, 2oz. black pepper, 3oz. bruised ginger, a drachm of mace, and from Â£ to -|oz. of cloves stuck in two or three small onions, and 4oz. mustard seed. Let this all boil together for five minutes, have the wal- nuts packed in a stone jar, and pour the vinegar, &c. over them straight off the fire. When this is all quite cold, cover down closely and keep in a dry place. Be careful to have the walnuts always covered with the vinegar, adding fresh, when necessary, but always boiling this up, before adding it to the pickle.

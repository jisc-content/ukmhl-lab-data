Grapes, to Keep.—When cutting the bunches from the vine, be careful always to leave a joint of the stalk on them ; now hang them up from a cord in a dry room, so that the bunches do not touch each other in any way, for unless the ah- can pass freely round and through them the grapes will mould and spoil. Many housewives close the ends of the stalk with sealing wax. Examine them at intervals to see how they are keeping.

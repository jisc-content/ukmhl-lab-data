PICKLES. 115 piece of ginger to each, bottle as yon close it down. (This is an old Eastern Counties recipe.) Elderberry Catsup.—Strip ripe elderberries from their stalks and put them in a stone jar with as much good vinegar as will cover them thoroughly, then place them in the oven when the bread is baked to extract the juice, and strain off whilst hot. Now boil this liquor with sufficient cloves, mace, pepper- corns and shallot to flavour it nicely, and then add to it 6 to 8oz. best anchovies, for every quart of liquor, and boil only just enough to dissolve these. When cold, bottle in small bottles, and be very particular in fastening down. This by the way applies to all catsups. Mushroom Catsup.—Break a peck of mushrooms (previously wiped with a flannel) into a large earthen- ware crock; strew -fib. of salt over them, and leave them all night in a cool oven, next day strain oft and measure the liquor, and boil it for a quarter of an hour. To each quart of this liquor add loz. pepper, ^oz, allspice, -|oz. ginger and two blades of mace, and let this all boil quickly together for half an hour.

Pour to this one and a half pints white wine, just bring it to the boil, and simmer it very gently for twenty minutes ; then strain through a muslin. Now add a teaspoonful each, of cloves, mace and nutmeg to this, boil it for ten minutes i 2

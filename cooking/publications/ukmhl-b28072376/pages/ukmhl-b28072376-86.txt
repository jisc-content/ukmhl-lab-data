PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 74 a little wooden tap, wlticli should have been fixed close to the bottom of the tub, being very particular not to break the crust; if there is no tap, this crust must be skimmed off, but this is very troublesome, as every scrap must be removed, or it will hopelessly cloud the wine. Now for each gallon of liquid allow 31b. of (cane) brown sugar, mix it well in, and pour the result into a cask, keeping back a gallon of the liquid to add later on. It will take seven to eight days to finish the fermentation, and this surplus liquor may be added in gradually during this process. Meanwhile, soak 2oz. of gelatine in a pint of the liquid, and then dissolve it over the fire, and pour this solution to the wine when the fermentation stops; then bung it down closely, and let it stand for five or six months. When ready add to it a quart of elderflower water and a gill of mock or real kirschwasser. Apple Wine— Put into a pan four quarts of apples, crush lightly, and pour on to it a gallon of boiling water. Cover, and let it stand a fortnight, then strain, and to each pound of juice allow lib. of loaf sugar slightly moistened in hot water. When this is dissolved, pour the liquid into crocks, covered with a sheet of paper or a cloth to keep out the dust, but do not cork down, Let this stand until it has worked, i. e. until it is all covered with a thick scum; remove this with a quill or by the tap, and if no more scum rises by the next day, bottle, cork, and seal. It improves greatly by keeping. Birch Wine.—To each gallon of the birch-tree sap boiled put 41b. loaf sugar, and the thinly pared rind

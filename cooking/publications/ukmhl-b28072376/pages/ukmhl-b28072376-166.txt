154 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. Hams, to Vickie {old Yorkshire way).—Rub two or three hams well with a mixture of half a peck of salt, ^oz. sal prunella, 2oz. saltpetre, and 41b. coarse sugar. Then lay them in a tub, covering them with the rest of the mixture. Let them he in this for three days, then take them out and let them hang for twenty- four hours at least. Meantime prepare a pickle with enough water to cover the hams thoroughly, and suffi- cient salt to float an egg; boil, skim, and strain this, and steep the hams in this when cool, for a fortnight. Pig’s cheeks are prepared in just the same way as either bacon or ham. The rest of the head, with the tongue and the pettitoes, are salted for a few days, then used for brawn. Ox Tongues, to Pickle.—Pound together very finely 4oz. common salt, 3oz. bay salt, |oz. of saltpetre, and the same of sal prunella, with 4oz. coarse sugar; then rub this mixture well into the tongue, rubbing and turning this daily for three weeks. It is best to do two or three tongues together. (This also is a well tried old family recipe.) Tongues need care in preparing them for the pickling tub; they must be freed from all root, gristle, and fat; and all the slimy sticky substance often found adhering to them must be carefully wiped off with a clean cloth ; if left on this would spoil the pickle used. Another way of preparing these is thus: make a pickle by boiling together 6oz. salt, 4oz. sugar, and a short i0z. of saltpetre, to each quart of water; skim this well till no more scum rises, then strain it, and pour it when cool over the trimmed tongues, which should have been previously lightly rubbed all over with salt.

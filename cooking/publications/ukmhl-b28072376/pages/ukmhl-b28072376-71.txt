59 LIQUEURS, WINES, &c. Brandy, Orange.—Slice three Seville oranges into a jar, pour a bottle of brandy on them and let them stand for six weeks, closely covered; then strain, bottle, and cork down closely. (Some thrifty house- wives put the oranges in whole and let them stand two months; then, when the liqueur is strained off, the oranges are candied and used for dessert. But this liqueur is not so good.) Or : Pare the rind very thinly from eight Seville oranges and eight lemons, put them into a jai with a gallon of good brandy; make a syrup with eight pounds of loaf sugar and three or four pints of water, and pour this boiling on to the peel, &c. Let it all stand forty-eight hours, stirring it constantly, then strain and bottle off into pint bottles. (This is an old family recipe.) Peach.—Peel and slice six fairly ripe peaches over a basin, so as to lose none of the juice, then add the kernels, lightly bruised, and 3oz. to 4oz. crushed sugar candy, pouring over it all lastly a bottle of good brandy, and let it stand closely covered for six weeks. Now strain and bottle, corking down closely. Some people prefer adding the sugar in a clear syrup when the liqueur has been strained, as then they can regulate the sweetening to taste. (N.B.—This remark applies to almost every kind of home-made liqueur.) Or: Peel and halve six good ripe and large peaches, and arrange them in layers, with the hollow upper- most in a large glass jar, placing a blanched kernel in every second half peach ; strew caster sugar over each layer, covering the top layer rather more thickly, and using about fib. in all. Let this stand

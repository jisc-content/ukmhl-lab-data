These cakes can be served plain (they rise beautifully, and are very flakey) or dusted with sugar and a few washed and dried currants. The rest of the fat is rendered down for lard, which is never so good as when home-made. Lard, to melt.â€”Strip off the skm from the inside fat of a fresh-killed pig, slice it down very thinly into a new or well scalded jar, set either in the bain- marie, or in a pan three parts full of boiling water, and let it all simmer till thoroughly dissolved ; now strain it into small stone jars, or a deep bowl, and leave it till cold, when you tie it over with some of the skin taken from the lard, or well washed and dried bladder. The last drainings of the fat should be kept separate as it will not be so good as the first. If flead is to be kept, rub it well with fine salt di- rectly it is taken from the pig, and leave it in this for two days, then drain well, and lay it in strong brine, changing this occasionally. When to be used lay this fat into cold fresh water for two or three hours, then wipe it perfectly diy, and it can be used as if fresh. The process of curing requires great care and at- tention; as said before, the best times are either when the pork is just killed, or when it has been hung long enough to become tender. This hanging must in great measure depend on the weather (it

PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 68 of fresh orange blossoms for four days in three and a half pints of pure spirit, or brandy ; then strain, mix with a clear syrup made by boiling l|lb. of best loaf sugar in one and a half pints of water, filter and bottle off. Jessamine flowers also make a delicious ratafia, if 4oz. are infused in three pints of white spirit for four days, then strained, mixed with a pint of syrup (thirty degrees) filtered and bottled off. Ratafia, Quince.—Grate some very ripe quinces to the core, and strew on it about loz. of caster sugar to the pound of fruit, and let it stand twenty- four hours. Now wring it well to extract every drop of liquid, and mix it with an equal quantity of brandy, adding 2oz. of loaf sugar to every pint of the mixture, and either a piece of stick cinnamon or jib. of angelica for every pound of quince. Let it stand for a little, then filter and bottle off. Another way is to steep the grated quince in the brandy or spirit, allowing a pound of quince, grated, to nearly a gallon of spirit, sweetening it when strained with about the same amount of clear syrup, (This recipe is a French one, and the liquid is measured by litres.) Raspail Liqueur.—Take a nutmeg, and of cloves, myrrh, and succotrin aloes each 2 grammes, 25 centi- grammes of saffron, 4oz. calamus aromaticus, and 8 grammes of vanilla; steep this in the sun for fifteen days, shaking the bottle daily, in a quart of brandy, then dissolve in it lib. of loaf sugar; when this is thoroughly melted, filter it off and keep it closely stoppered, in a dark cupboard. I have given the French quantities as this is a much praised French liqueur.

147 MEAT, &c., TO CERE. bacon, ham, &c., is much practised, it is easy enough to provide oneself at a relatively small cost, with a most convenient little smoking apparatus of which we give an illustration. (Fig. 3.) This smoking- cupboard is one approved by M. Gouffe, and could easily be copied by any local workman. It can, of course, be made to any scale, but a very convenient size for the use of a small household is 4ft. 6in. high, and 3ft. deep, and wide; this box should be lined with sheet iron throughout, and be fitted with iron rods across, by which the articles to be smoked can be hung from hooks.

This flue is slipped through a hole in the bottom of the cupboard cut to fit it exactly, so as not to waste the smoke. Another similar flue is fit- ted to the top of the cupboard, to carry off the smoke into the open air, or into a chimney. The method of using this cupboard is as follows: put into the fire- pot a layer of charcoal embers (braise), and over this a layer of oak, elm, or other hard wood sawdust and wood shavings, to about one and a half inches in depth, and on this lay three or four bay leaves, a few sprays of thyme, and eighteen or twenty juniper

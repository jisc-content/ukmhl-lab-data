168 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. Caveached Fish.â€”Cut the fish into slices, fillets, or pieces, as is most convenient, sprinkle them with pepper and salt (using white pepper for delicate fish), then fry these in oil. When cooked, drain, and put them aside to cool. Boil some vinegai (sufficient to cover the fish well), with enough white peppercorns, a few cloves, a blade or so of mace, and salt to flavour the vinegar well. Allow this to become cold, then pour to it a gill of oil; now pack the fish in a jar with very thinly sliced onion between each piece or layer of fish, and then pour the pickle over it all. Keep it well covered. Any fish can be treated in this way, salmon being particularly good, but requiring to stand for a day or two, as it breaks if put quite fresh into the pickle. Some people add a few peppercorns and bay leaves to the pickle.

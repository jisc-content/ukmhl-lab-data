134 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. off the vinegar, bottle in small bottles, and store tightly corked and sealed. Spiced Vinegar.—(This can be nsed at once for pickling any vegetables, or if bottled off cold like the other flavouring vinegars it makes an excellent addi- tion to salads, &c.) Bruise well 2oz. black whole peppers, loz. each of ginger and salt and -|oz. of allspice, then mix this in a bottle with a quart of good vinegar (whether malt or wine vinegar does not matter, but the quality must be first rate), adding if you like loz. of chopped shallot, an atom of garlic, and some chillies, or a little cayenne (this of course makes it pretty hot). Tie the bottle over with blad- der wetted with vinegar, and leave it in a warm place for a few days; then stand the bottle in the bain- marie, keep the water round it at simmering point for one or two hours, and bottle off in the usual way. If to be used for pickling purposes, boil up the vinegar with all the condiments mentioned, to which, if liked, a bay leaf and a good bouquet may be added ; then let it cool a little, and pour it on to the things to be pickled. Tarragon Vinegar.—Pick young tarragon shoots, and dry them in the sun for a day or two, then infuse them in good vinegar for a fortnight, after which you strain and bottle off the vinegar as before. You can let the tarragon infuse longer if you like, but that is a matter of taste; or you can pour a second supply of vinegar over the tarragon, allowing it to infuse for a month or so, when it will yield a very good vinegar for cooking purposes, though not as delicate as the first, which answers for salads, &c.

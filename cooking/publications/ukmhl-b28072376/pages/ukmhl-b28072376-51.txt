JAMS, JELLIES, AND PASTES. 39 will keep without deteriorating for three or four years, or even longer. I remember eating some jam which had been made very nearly five years, and certainly it could compare favourably with any other. Jam to keep well must be stored in a cool, dry place, free from draughts, and from any sudden changes of temperatureâ€”the evener the latter, the better the jam will keep. It is advisable when putting up jam to paste labels with the name of the jam and the date of its making on the sides of the jars, for when stored the names, if written, as they often are, on the top covering, are not visible, and so a good deal of confusion may arise. Be very careful when pouring the jam into the pots to keep the latter as free from splashes as possible, and if by any accident any is spilt, wipe it off at once with a damp cloth rung out of hot water; the importance of attention to this point is that, if not wiped off at once it cools and hardens quickly, and is then not easy to remove; and if the cover by any chance gets moistened by the stickiness thus left, the contents of the pot are very likely not to keep. The above are general rules applicable to all jams, but common sense must be used in applying them. For instance, jams, or marmalades as the French call them, should be cooked a little before adding the sugar; the same rule applies to jellies, which should be cooked first to extract the juice, and when tender should be drained through a fine sieve or jelly bag, and then boiled quickly with the requisite amount of sugar.

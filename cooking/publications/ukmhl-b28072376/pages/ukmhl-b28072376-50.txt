This juice is easily prepared by wiping, paring, and cutting up the stalks of rhubarb, then laying them on a dish, strewed with sugar, for an hour or so, to draw out the juice, the whole being then turned into a pre- serving pan, and heated very slowly and gradually till the juice is all drawn out; when it is strained and is ready for use ; this juice imparts little or no flavour to the fruit, yet is richer than plain water. Few people, by-the-way, know what an improvement a finely sliced stick of rhubarb is to almost any fruit tart, such as cherry, &c., improving both the quality and the quantity of the juice. Lastly, remember that the fire for jam making should be clear and strong, but not fierce, and on no account should the preserving pan rest directly on the fire itself, but should be placed on a trivet over the grate. As regards potting jam, authorities differ, some people declaring it must not be touched till jam and pots are alike cold; others, again, that it never keeps so well as when poured boiling hot into the pots and covered over at once, before it has time to cool.

PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 150 mixture with l^lb. each of brown sugar and bay salt, 41b. common salt, and 4oz. saltpetre. Use as in the preceding recipe, then hang for a day or two, and smoke for a week.

Rub the meat well first with the sugar and saltpetre, carefully removing any blood, &c., and then rub it well with the salt, which should have previously been slightly warmed before the fire, using only a part to begin with, and adding more as the first dissolves, or is absorbed. The meat should be laid on a clean stone or brick floor, and will take about a fortnight to three weeks to cure, according to the weather, which must be neither a severe frost nor damp when the curing is begun.

Before, however, proceeding to these, the method of pickling pork, and also the pre- paration of French or larding bacon, may be given. Porlc, to PicTcle.—Bone the pork, and cut it into

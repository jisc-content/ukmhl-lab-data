Repeat this drying till they are quite desiccated, which you will know is completed if on holding them up to the light they appear transparent. Now put them in paper bags, hang them up in a dry place, and they will keep good for a year. When required for use steep them in warm water for three or four hours, changing the water two or three times in the process. Lemons and Limes, to Keep.—These may be kept by the same recipe as is recommended for walnuts, i.e., in sand; or they can be hung up in nets in such a way that the air can get all round them freely, being careful they do not touch one another in any way. Abroad they are preserved in crocks full of cold water, which is changed weekly, care being taken to keep them well immersed.

The great secret about this process is to do it as slowly as possible, for if the least hurried the leaves will crisp up and discolour.

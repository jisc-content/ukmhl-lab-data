CHAPTER XI. MEAT, &c., TO CUKE—(Continued). After considering tlie most usual forms of cured meat, sausages appear the next tilings to claim one’s attention. These are of many kinds, from the ordinary farmhouse sausage made with equal parts of fat and lean pork, seasoned with pepper and salt to taste, to the delicate saucisse truffee au foie gras of the high class Italian warehouse. It is clearly impossible within the limits of this book to give an exhaustive list of these dainties, but perhaps the following recipes may at least be to some degree representative of the various types. As said before, sausages may be roughly divided between those requiring almost immediate consump- tion, and those which are smoked and otherwise prepared to make them keep, in some cases almost indefinitely. Before, however, considering the sausages themselves, a few words must be said concerning the mincer and the skins used in their manufacture. The simpler the mincer the better, for any complicated arrangements which render difficult its thorough and constant cleansing are to ve avoided. It should be taken to pieces.

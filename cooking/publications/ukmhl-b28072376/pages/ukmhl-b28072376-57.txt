45 JAMS, JELLIES, AND PASTES. little of tlie jelly as in the first recipe, and in this stew some peeled, halved, and cored fruit till soft enough to pulp through a sieve when cool. Replace this pulp over a very clear fire and keep it well stirred till it becomes thick and dry. Weigh this paste, add to it an equal weight of (cane) caster sugar and stir this all together over the fire till it “balls,” leaving the sides of the pan, and clinging to the spoon. Spread this paste out on shallow tins, and as soon as it is cool cut it up into any shapes you please and dry these in a slack oven, afterwards storing them in an air-tight tin. (N.B.— Almost any fruit can be made into a paste thus, though for very juicy fruit, such as currants, &c., the fruit from which jelly is made answers admirably if all the juice has not been drawn away.) Elderberry Jelly.—Strip the berries from their stalks and stir them over the fire with a new wooden spoon till the juice flows freely; then strain it off thoroughly, though without in any way touching or handling the jelly bag (which would make it thiek and cloudy), weigh it, and boil up sharply for fifteen to twenty minutes; next add in, off the fire, 14oz. cane caster sugar to every pint of juice, and boil it all together for fifteen minutes, stirring and skim- ming it carefully, till it jellies. If the fruit is dry, a very little water may be boiled with it in the first placv.. (This is a German recipe, and is much used abroad for colds, coughs, &c.) Cranberry Jelly.—Well wash the berries in several waters, then drain them roughly and lay them into the preserving pan, with half a pint of water to each

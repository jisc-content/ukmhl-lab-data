FLAVOURED WINES AND VINEGARS. 131 well for five minutes, skimming it very carefully. Then bottle off, like raspberry vinegar. Raspberry Vinegar.—Put three gallons of ripe and well coloured raspberries into a large unglazed earth- enware jar, and pour over them a gallon of white wine vinegar. Let it all stand for three or four days, lightly covered with paper to keep out the dust, then strain it off into a clean basin through a jelly bag or a fine and well scalded horsehair sieve. The juice should run clear and bright. Now measure it, and for each pint allow lib. of cane loaf sugar, and stir it over the fire with a clean wooden, or a silver spoon, till the sugar is quite dissolved, and skim it very carefully. Let it boil for about half an hour, then stir it till cool, when you add from half to a pint of spirit for each quart of liquid, then bottle off and cork down closely, Mind not to use anything iron or tin in making this as its beauty depends upon its perfect colour. Another simpler way (but one that does not keep so well) is to fill a large 71b. or 81b. jam jar with raspberries, and pour over them suffi- cient vinegar to cover them well and fill the jar, and let it all stand for nine days, stirring it daily; then strain it off, add 12oz. of cane loaf sugar to each pint of juice, and boil together till no more scum will rise, and then bottle off carefully. Strawberry Vinegar.—Gather the fruit when at the point of perfection, and use at once. Remove the stalks, weigh the fruit and put it into wide-moutlied glass bottles, pouring on to it a quart of best white wine vinegar to every pound of fruit. Cover the jars closely and let it stand for three days, then drain off k 2

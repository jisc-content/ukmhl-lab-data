MEAT. &c., TO CURE. 159 Chicken and Ham Sausage.—Mince finely some cold coolced .oliicken and ham, or tongue (using two parts cliicken to one of liam), and to each pound of this mixture allow 2oz. of ham fat or loz. of fresh butter, and two or three button mushrooms. Mix well, inn it through the mincer, season with salt, white pepper, a dust of pounded cloves, and the same of coralline pepper. Use the dyed skins for this sausage, steam it three-quarters of an hour or so, then let it cool, and, if to keep, oil, or dip in the melted white wax. Game can be used in the same way, only reduce the quantity of ham considerably, using, say, 4oz. to the pound, adding freshly-made breadcrumbs to make up the weight (say 2oz. to 4oz.), and, if at hand, the livers of the game previously tossed in a little butter, season with salt, mace, and a dash of coralline pepper, and finish as before. These do not require steaming, as the flesh is cooked. Leber-ruurst.—Boil, or rather stew, equal parts of lean and fat pork in a very little water, then run them through the mincer; well wash and dry the same quantity of calf’s liver as you have pork, and then grate it down finely. Prepare a seasoning by mixing well together (for every 41b. of meat and liver) a tablespoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of powdered cloves, a teaspoonful each of white and black pepper, and 4oz. of raw onion, or rather less shallot, cut up as small as possible. Mix this well with the pork and the liver, working it well together to get it thoroughly blended; and, lastly, take the fat which rose from the pork when cooking, adding to it sufficient good lard to make |-lb. altogether,

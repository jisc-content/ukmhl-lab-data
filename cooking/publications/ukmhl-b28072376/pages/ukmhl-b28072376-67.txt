55 LIQUEURS, WINES, &c. result, both as to flavour and keeping power. Inferior sugar necessarily involves clarification, if the liqueur is not to be cloudy (an unpardonable fault), which wastes both time and material considerably, and gives a good deal of unnecessary trouble. In the following recipes it is taken for granted that pure cane sugar of the best quality is used, therefore nothing is said as to clarification. If, however, there is any doubt on the matter, here is the way to clarify the syrup: Put six or seven pounds of loaf sugar in a large preserving pan with two quarts of cold spring water, and the whites and shells of two eggs; let it come as slowly as possible to the boil, whisking it all the time with a delicately clean wire whisk, till the sugar is entirely dissolved; as soon as it boils up and a thick scum forms at the top, stop whisking at once, let it rise up in the pan for a moment, then at once turn off the flame if using a stove or a gas ring, or lift it off if it is on the fire; let it stand for a minute or two to settle, then pom* it off through a jelly bag previously scalded in boiling water, and wrung dry, into a basin, when it should run perfectly clear. It is well on these occasions to have two basins, and then if the first filtering does not run clear, it can be returned very gently to the bag, and the rest allowed to run into the other basin. This syrup will be of a very pale straw colour ; pure cane sugar of first quality gives a much whiter syrup. Lastly, remember the spirit used must be of good quality. Liqueur made with inferior spirit is never satisfactory. It is to this fact that a great deal of the non-success of home-made liqueurs is

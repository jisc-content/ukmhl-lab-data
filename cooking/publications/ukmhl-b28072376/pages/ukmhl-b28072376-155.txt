MEAT, Ac., TO CURE. 143 must be remembered that nothing can be cured satis- factorily in hot, or even warm weather; abroad, pork is a forbidden food after May, until winter returns); from three days to a week is the usual time in win- ter, while if it is absolutely necessary to care in warmer times, one to two days is the outside limit of what can be allowed, and then the meat must be hung in a cool, dark place. A point that cannot be too strongly impressed on those responsible for curing meat, is the absolute necessity of removing all blood, and any pipes or kernels left in the meat; these if left in, are pretty certain to cause trouble by spoiling the meat. The next thing to consider is the salting trough; unglazed stoneware is excellent for small tilings, such as tongues, &c., but is too heavy and unwieldy where large joints such as flitches, &c., are concerned. About as nice a thing as any is a wooden trough, which any local cooper would make. This should be about 2ft. deep, and rather wider at the bottom than at the top, say 16in. or 18in. at the top, and 20in. to 22in. at the bottom, inside measure in both cases. This trough should preferably stand on a frame of some kind, and have a hole at the bottom to facilitate the removal of the extra pickle, or the washing out of the trough. The necessity for the strictest cleanliness must be insisted on, and the trough should be thoroughly scrubbed and scoured after use, and even before use again, if by any chance it has been left out of use for some time. All pickling utensils should be thoroughly scrubbed and scalded out after use, be left to dry in the ai", and be stored in a very dry, well ventilated

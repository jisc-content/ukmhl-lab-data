PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 36 a dry, and if possible, sunny day, and be carefully picked over that there may be no imperfect or damaged fruit amongst it. Moreover, the fruit, if not used at once, must be kept in a cool place, well sheltered from dust. With regard to putting the sugar and fruit into the pan opinions vary. Some persons put in both together ; others, again, boil the sugar first, and then lay in the fruit (this, by the way, is the best plan, if you wish to keep the fruit whole) ; but, perhaps, the safest plan, on the whole, is to bring the fruit to the boil by itself first, and then put in the sugar (which should have been warmed, but not dissolved), as the keeping powers of the jam depend greatly on the thorough boiling of the fruit, which may take some little time ; yet, if you have the sugar boiling all the time, it will sometimes become quite sticky, and what old cooks call “tacky,” a result always due to the overboiling of the sugar. Again, if the fruit is not boiled sufficiently it will neither jelly nor set, and indeed, will almost certainly ferment. It is said that boiling up the fruit first, without the sugar, is a sure preventive of fermen- tation, and is decidedly to be recommended if jam has necessarily to be made in damp, muggy weather. As a general rule, the fruit and sugar should boil together from ten to fifteen minutes, but never longer than twenty minutes—in fact, when the fruit has been first boiled up alone, the shortest period mentioned is the best, But the safest plan is always to try the jam (after skimming it till no more scum rises'), by dropping a little on to a plate, and if in about a minute it has jellied enough to be too stiff

CANNING AND BOTTLING. 31 perfect, and not over-ripe fruit, cut the stalks half an inch from the fruit, and then arrange the latter in wide-mouthed bottles. Now dissolve good cane loaf sugar, broken small, in brandy, using a pint of brandy for every 21b. of sugar, mix it thoroughly, and when perfectly melted pour it on to the cherries, being careful to cover them thoroughly. Cork the bottles very tightly to make them airtight, aud store them in a very cool place. A clove or two, or a piece of stick cinnamon may be put into each bottle with the fruit. Walnuts in Brandy.â€”Choose the walnuts before they are altogether ripe, and peel them carefully to keep them as whole as possible, throwing them into cold water as you peel them. Now bring some water to the boil, throwing in the nuts, but be careful to lift the pan from the fire the moment you see it is going to boil up again, then drain them off into more cold water, acidulated with a little lemon juice (use enough lemon juice to give the water a notice- able but not too strong acid flavour), meanwhile, boil some good cane sugar to the small thread (i.e., till on dipping your finger and thumb into cold water, and then into the sugar, you can draw out a tiny thread between them), drain the nuts, place them in a basin, pour the boiled sugar on them, and leave them in this for the night. Next day strain off the sugar, again boil it up till on testing it as before, it will form a longer thread than the first time, before it snaps ; again let the nuts stand in this for a night; next day boil the sugar again till the thread will be longer still, and again leave them a fourth night,

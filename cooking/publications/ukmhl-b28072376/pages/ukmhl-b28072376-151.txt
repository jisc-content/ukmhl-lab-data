MEAT, &c., TO CURE. 139 meat should be cured at once; but if the meat is bought in the shape of pork it should be hung long enough to ensure its being tender, i. e. to give the time for the death stiffness (or rigor mortis) to pass off. If the pig is home-killed be sure and save all the blood while the animal is still warm, letting it run into a bowl, and stirring it all the time with a wooden spoon to prevent its coagulating, when it would be utterly useless. The great thing in pig- killing is to make the blood run freely, if not it disperses internally and spoils the meat. Having taken away all the blood, scald the carcase well to facilitate the removal of the bristles, which is done by scraping the body with a blunt knife. Imme- diately this is accomplished hang the carcase up by the hind legs and slit it down the front, to allow of the removal of the intestines, &c. The gall must be carefully removed, and every vestige of blood any- where about the flesh wiped off most punctiliously. It does not do to wash the flesh of pork too much, as it would only soften, and so spoil, the meat. Set the parts removed aside in clean cold water to soak, as these must be thoroughly well washed and rinsed before use. When the carcase is perfectly cool it may be cut up.

The parts generally used fresh are the loin, either whole or in the shape of chops, the best end of the neck, used for cutlets; and the leg, often served fresh and roasted. Otherwise, the hind legs are reserved for curing hams, the front ones being cured as “hands” or “corner cushions” of

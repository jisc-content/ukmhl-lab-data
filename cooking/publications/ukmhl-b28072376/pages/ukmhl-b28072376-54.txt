PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 42 least touch of “ ropiness”—given by over-boiled sugar. Take for instance : Red Currant Jelly.—For every 21b. of red currants take lib. of white (mind they are ripe and very juicy, and carefully stripped from their stalks)'; ’place these in the preserving pan, and keep them well- stined over the fire, to make them render their juice freelyas soon as they have done so, pour it off’ and weigh it and for each quart of juice take If lb. of’cane loaf sugar, broken into fairly large pieces, dip these int o cold water, and throw them, when well drenched, into a pan and boil them to a thick syrup, stirrino- it all well together till it “ drapes ” the skimmer, and falls in thick folds from it. blow pour in the juice at once, stir it all well together, and, when well blended, let it all boil together sharply for five minutes; then skim most carefully, and pour it into glasses which have been previously scalded and dried. White Currant Jelly.—Choose very fine and deli- cately white currants for this (gathered on a warm, dry day), and remove the stalks very carefully. To each pound of fruit allow lib. 2oz. best cane loaf sugar, and boil these together very quickly for seven or eight minutes, then turn it out on to a delicately clean sieve, and allow all the juice to drain from it putting this into small jars, which must be left in a cool, dry place till cold. Red currants can be made into jelly in the same way, only using equal weights of fruit and sugar. This makes a delicious jelly though its stiffness cannot be depended on if the weather be cold, and, above all, damp.

PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 10 you have been careful to fill up the bottles brimful, and use patent bottles in good condition, this trouble should not occur. When stored look at them fre- quently for a week or two, and if you find the liquid has settled, and that there are no air-bubbles, you may set your mind at ease; the canned fruits are going to keep. If, however, the opposite is the case, fermentation has set in, and unless released, the bottles will burst. In this case open the bottles, turn out the fruit, and boil it up again, using it as soon as possible, as stewed fruit, puree, &c., for it is not satisfactory to attempt to keep fruit that has once tried to ferment. N.B.â€”If you do not use patent bottles, but simply wide-mouthed bottles corked with bladder-lined corks, or covered with bladder, melt some paraffin wax (which any chemist will supply) in a small pan at the side of the stove (a very low degree of heat will do), and after filling the bottle, and well wiping the rim with a damp cloth, pour in about a tables poonful of the wax, being careful not to touch the bottle again till this has set, when it will adhere to the glass and form a perfectly air-tight cover. (This paraffin can be lifted out of the bottle, well washed, dried, and used acrain.) The bottle can then be covered down in the usual way. Only remember in canning, bottling, or otherwise preserving anything, the jar must be air- tight, if its contents are to keep ; so never use paper as a cover, whether brown or white, no matter how nianv folds you use, for paper is not of itself air- tight. Another point must be noticed about canning, and that is the preparation of the

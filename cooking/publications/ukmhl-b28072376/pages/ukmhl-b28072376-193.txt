These pickles make the shell rather brittle, so that the eggs should never be boiled in the ordinary way, but be put on in cold water, and then brought gently to the boil. Either way the eggs will, if carefully packed, keep a long time perfectly fresh and good.

Fruit for pre- serving should never be quite dead ripe, save in the case of medlars, which are not really good till lightly touched by the frost, so that discretion must be used as to the best time for jam and jelly making. This being premised, here are the average seasons for various kinds of fruits :

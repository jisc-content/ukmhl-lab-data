In the Climax the wide mouth is fitted with an india-rubber band out- side it, on which a strong glass top fits, being made absolutely air tight at the last by a fire-gilt metal cap, which screws down over all, firmly pressing down the glass top into its place, over the elastic ring. These bottles can also be had with a small vent-hole in the glass top for use in pre- serving when the fruit has to be cooked after bottling; it can then be closed with a tiny bit of cork, and a drop of wax dropped over this before the outer cap is screwed on.

The Lightning bottle cap varies a little from both of these. It has a wire bail and lever, but after the glass cap has been fixed in position over the rubber band, the end of the bail is passed over the top, fitted in between two glass studs on the cap, and the lever is pressed down till it locks the bail, and so keeps the lid in an air-tight condition. To open the jar, the lever must be raised, and the bail pulled towards the lever, off the cap. This last kind is, I believe, the most generally popular.

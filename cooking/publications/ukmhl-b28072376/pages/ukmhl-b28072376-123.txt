Ill PICKLES. Pears in pickle.—For 91b. of fruit allow olb. of sugar, one quart of vinegar, joz. of cinnamon, and tlie rind of one lemon. This fruit pickles remarkably well. When just ripe, peel the pears very smoothly, halve them, remove the core, and wash quickly in fresh cold water. Meantime boil the vinegar, sugar, Ac., skim it, and put in as many pears as will lie side by side without overcrowding. Now boil these quickly, over a brisk fire, till soft. If left in too long they will turn brown and unsightly. Lift them out with a skimmer, and put them carefully in jars, round side uppermost, never touching them with a fork. Proceed thus till all are done, then pour the syrup over them. After a few days, boil up the liquor again as stated above. Large Plums (white or red), in pickle.—Wipe 61b. of picked fruit very gently with a clean cloth, scald them with very hot water, lifting them out quickly, and re- moving the peel at once. If they are to be stoned, the plums must be less ripe and should be stoned before scalding. Boil l|lb. of sugar in a pint of vinegar, with ioz. of cinnamon, the thinly peeled rind of one lemon, and a few cloves; when it is boiling scald the fruit, a few at a time, in this hot pickle (which must not be allowed to boil during the process) for two minutes, boiling up the pickle between each set of fruit. When all the fruit has been scalded, again boil up the pickle, then draw the pan to the side, off the fire, and put in all the fruit; let it soak till thoroughly moistened, then at once fill up the jars with the fruit and juice, tying them down whilst still warm. Be careful to boil up the liquor again every

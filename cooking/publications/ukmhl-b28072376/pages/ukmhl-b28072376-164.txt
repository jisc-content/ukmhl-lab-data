PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 152 covered board, weighted rather heavily. Let it lemain thus for six weeks, then hang in a drv airv room. This is the ordinary way, but for more deli- cate use here is the French mode, which, however, only keeps a week at the most. For this boil together common salt, bay salt, brown sugar, and water in the proportions of 21b. of salt, 4oz. brown sugar, and 2oz. bay salt to each gallon of water, stirring this fre- quently together; then when the salt, &c., is dissolved and the mixture has cooled, add an infusion of any spice or herbs to taste, as described above, and pour it over the pork, which should have been previously lightly rubbed with salt. This is ready for use in three days. Hams, to Pickle.—To each ham, if large, allow lib. bay salt, \\oz. saltpetre, and loz. black pepper, and pound and mix all these well together. Rub the ham very hard with this mixture, and let it lie in it for four days, turning and rubbing it daily ; then pour over it l|-lb. of treacle, and let it stand for a month, turning, basting, and rubbing it daily. Now lift it out, soak for twenty-four hours, then dry it carefully, sew it up in coarse cloth and hang it up to dry. This kind of ham requires no soaking before use. This is an excellent recipe, but for a hot or damp climate the following is better: lib. salt, lib. very dark sugar, 2oz. bay salt, l^oz. of saltpetre, and a gill each of ale and vinegar, with a little pepper. Keep it for a month or six weeks in pickle. These are both well-tested family recipes. (a la Ude).—Rub the hams well with salt and leave them to drain for three days. Throw

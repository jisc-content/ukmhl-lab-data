Let this all cool somewhat, then pour it over the pre- pared vegetables, and when this is all quite cold pack it into wide-mouthed bottles, dividing the spice between them all, and then fastening them down. Care must be taken to have the contents of the jar well covered with vinegar; the jars should be watched for a little time to see if more vinegar is needed, for if the vegetables absorb the vinegar, more must be added after scalding and letting it cool. It is best to put this pickle up in smallish bottles, as it keeps better so. To prepare the vegetables, take about equal quantities, as far as possible, of white cabbage, cauliflower, capsicums, small cucumbers or gherkins, French beans, onions small and large, green tomatoes, and nasturtium seeds. Shred, or break, up the larger vegetables, and boil them all for one minute in brine strong enough to float an egg, then lift them out and spread them on large dishes, and let them diy in the sun; they are then added to the hot vinegar.

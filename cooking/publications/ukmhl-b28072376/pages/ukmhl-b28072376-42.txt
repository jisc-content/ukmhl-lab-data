When the fruit is ready it will rise to the surface, and must then be lifted out with a skimmer and dropped into cold fresh water, well rinsed, and then drained on a sieve. Meanwhile, make a syrup by boiling sugar and water (in the proportion of two parts of sugar to one of water) together for a minute after the sugar is thoroughly dissolved, then lifting it off from the fire and skimming it carefully; now return it to the fire and let it boil till, on dipping your finger and thumb into cold water and then into the syrup, you can stretch them to the uttermost without breaking the thread that will form between them; then run it all through the jelly bag to clear it. (This syrup, if frequently wanted, can be made in .large quantities and bottled off for use as required.) Now lay the well-drained fruit into this syrup, give it one boil up, then lift it off the fire, and measure the syrup; mix this with the best brandy, allowing two parts brandy to one part syrup, put the fruit into wide-mouthed bottles, pour the brandied syrup over them, being careful to have them thoroughly covered, and when cold cork down the bottles as securely as possible. Pears preserved in this way are very delicious, but, after blanching and rinsing in cold water, must have their rinds taken off very thinly, and be again pricked to the core, and once more rinsed, drained, and finished off precisely as in the preceding recipe. Pine juicy eating pears should .be chosen for this purpose. Cherries in Brandy.â€”Choose large, well coloured,

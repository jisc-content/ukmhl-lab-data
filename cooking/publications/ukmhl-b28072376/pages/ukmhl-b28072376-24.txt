12 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. bottles, standing them on a warm, wet towel, and after removing the lid of each singly, fill up directly with more boiling syrup, kept ready on the hob, and screw down tightly at once.

Either fruit or vegetables can be done in this way, using boiled water instead of syrup, only of course it will take a considerably longer time. In syrup, berries and other small fruit will take ten to twelve minutes boiling to cook properly, whilst pears and such like will take two or three hours, according to their nature, and peaches or apricots will require from twenty to forty minutes; but if water only is used, a longer time (quite double, in fact) must be allowed. If properly cooked, fruit will keep quite as well without, as with sugar, and for many purposes it is more suitable unsweetened. Be careful to remember that for all kinds of pre- serves and pickles, the fruit or vegetables must be gathered on a dry day, after the dew is off ; they must be perfect in condition, rather under than over ripe, and as even in size and shape as may be had.

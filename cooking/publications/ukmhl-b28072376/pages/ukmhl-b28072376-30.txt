18 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. tender crush it all through a tine sieve (be sure and keep back all the skin and pips), and then after seasoning this pulp with a little salt aud pepper either pour it at once into hot, wide-mourhed bottles, cork, and cook in the bain marie for half an hour, and cork and store in the usual way ; or, return the pulp (after tammying) to the pan, and let it cook for half an hour, till it thickens to the consistency of peasoup or thick cream, and when cool put it in wide-mouthed, unglazed jars, and cover with oil, butter, or melted beef-suet; tie down and store in a dry place. This will keep for years if properly made. Almost all vegetables can be bottled by the above directions, and keep admirably if care has been taken to see that the covers are air-tight, so that full advantage may be taken of a year of extra plenty. Vegetables also, if reduced to a puree and stored in unglazed jars, with a covering of melted beef suet, &c., keep capitally. For instance, sorrel or spinach may either of them be preserved in this way: Remove the stalk and the spine or thread from the leaves, and boil up in a copper pan, till it has rendered all its liquid, then strain this off and return the puree of vegetable to the fire, and let it cook to a smooth puree; now turn it into wide- mouthed unglazed jars, smooth over the top, cover with paraffin wax, and cover down and store as usual. Endive, lettuce, &c., can be done in this way, but must first be broken up. The sorrel or spinach for this can be obtained by letting the bed grow after the first spring crop has been cleared off in the spring and then utilising the later crop.

The following will give an idea of this process: Have ready your fruit, whether strawberries, black currants, apricots, &c., as you please, and pick out a certain proportion of the finest; weigh these and put them in a pan sprinkled with an equal weight of fine preserving sugar (be careful when doing this to sprinkle the sugar in gradually in layers with the fruit, so as not to crush the latter), and leave them thus till next day.

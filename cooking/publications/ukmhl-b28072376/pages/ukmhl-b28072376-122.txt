PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 110 best vinegar with a good pinch of sugar, a few cloves, and some peppercorns (say seven or eight of each to each pint of vinegar used), let it cool, then pour it whilst still warm, on to the packed fruit, and cover down. Small plums can also be done in this way. Apricots in vinegar.—Boil three quarters of a pint of best vinegar with 21b. of sugar; after the latter is thoroughly dissolved, skim it well, and lay in the apricots, peeled, halved and stoned; let them get thoroughly hot, then drain them from the pickle and pack them in jars, strewing them as you pack them, with |oz. coarsely pounded and mixed cinnamon and cloves between the layers of fruit; then boil up the vinegar drained from them with a few Jamaica pep- pers, and pour it, when just hot, on to the fruit, close down the jars, and put them aside. After two or three days, pour off the liquor, let it just boil up again, then return it to the jars, and close these down very tightly. Melons in picTcle.—Choose melons that are not too ripe, peel them, cut them in slices, scoop out all the pithy part, and lay them in preserving jars. Boil one and a half pints of vinegar with l|lb. of sugar, some broken cinnamon, white peppercorns, lemon peel, twelve cloves, and a little ginger. Pour this over the melons when nearly cold. After twenty-four hours put the liquor back into the pan with a little more sugar, boil it till it thickens like a syrup, and pour it over the melons. This must be repeated twice, at the interval of a week, adding more vinegar if necessary. Tie down with parchment soaked in brandy, &c.

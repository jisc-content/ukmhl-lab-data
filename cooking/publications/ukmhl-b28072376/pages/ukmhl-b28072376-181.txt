CHAPTER XII. ODDS AND ENDS. In this chapter will be found odds and ends of recipes that did not appear properly to belong to any of the foregoing chapters, and are therefore gathered up here indiscriminately. Barberries, to Preserve.â€”Choose fine bunches of the berries, or, if needful, make up pretty groups by binding them delicately together with white filoselle or fine sewing silk, and stone them with a needle. Cover the bottom of a preserving pan three inches deep with syrup, boiled to the thread, now put in the fruit, and let it boil up again, lifting the pan off directly it boils; let it stand for half an hour, then boil up again and lift out the fruit; now boil the sugar again for ten minutes, and again pour it over the fruit. Let it all stand till next day, then boil up the syrup again, and strain it over the berries, after which tie down when cool, and store. Mind the syrup is well skimmed all the time, and if boil- ing the fruit in it should discolour it, clear it at the last boiling with the whipped white and shell of an egg. Rowan (or mountain ash) berries can be pre- served in the same way.

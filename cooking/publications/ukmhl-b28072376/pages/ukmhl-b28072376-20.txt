PICKLES AND PRESERVES. S' things are kept the better do they preserve their flavour. As not every gum or glue will stick paper on to tin, the following formula, may be found useful: dissolve loz. of powdered alum in a pint of boiling water, then add to it 2oz. of gum shellac, and boil to- gether till this also is dissolved; bottle and keep tightly corked.. For liqueurs you will find it con- venient to have a jar (say a two-gallon one) full of stock syrup, which can be used plain or diluted as necessary, and so saves time when it may be of im- portance. For essences, and, indeed, many liqueurs, thoroughly good, over-proof, plain spirit may be ob- tained from the wine merchant, infinitely better than the ordinary so-called “kitchen” or “cooking” spirits, though, if anything, cheaper than these. The great advantage of this plain spirit is that it does not detract from the flavour of the material to be preserved, as would very likely be the case with the more or less doctored cheap spirit. Of course, where first-class liqueurs for table use are in question, real good brandy, gin, &c., should be employed as required, for, naturally, the better the quality of this foundation spirit, the more mellow and perfect will be the liqueur. This is a fact, by the way, only too often ignored by amateur liqueur makers, who consequently bring home-made liqueurs, &c., into contempt.

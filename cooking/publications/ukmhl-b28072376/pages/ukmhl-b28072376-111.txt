Cucumbers with Mustard.—Slice some not too ripe cucumbers, or cut them into inch lengths, and quarter these ; slice also some good large onions very thinly, and arrange these in layers on a dish, with salt sprinkled upon each layer, turn another plate over them, and let them drain for six hours or so ; have ready some good spiced vinegar as for other pickles, mix with this a dessertspoonful of good mustard for each quart of vinegar (adding this when mixed with a little warm vinegar, when the spices and vinegar have been boiled up together), pour it, all hot, over the cucumber, &c., and leave till next day, when you bottle and cork it all down. This pickle, though excellent, does not keep over well, so should be eaten soon. Eggs, to 'pickle.—Boil the eggs well for half an hour, then let them cool, and shell them. Now place them in jars, and pour over them some scalding hot vinegar, previously boiled up with allspice, whole peppers, cloves, ginger, and a few cloves of garlic. Let it all stand till cold, then cork down very closely. They must be well covered with the vinegar. Excel- lent with cold meat. Elder Buds, to pickle.—Gather the elder buds when of the size of hop buds, and leave them in strong brine for nine days, stirring them daily.

89 LIQUEURS, WINES, &c. strain off the liquor, and boil it with 31b. of sugar for half an hour, then add to it the rinds of two sweet oranges and two lemons, very thinly pared, quite free from all white pith, and previously well bruised, and when milk warm add a toast spread with yeast. Let it stand seven to ten days before putting it into a cask, then bottle in three months, adding a lump or two of sugar to each bottle. In the country this wine is often not put into a cask at all, but simply drunk from the crock, which is kept covered with a cloth or a board to keep out the dust. Country wives consider it a splendid tonic, or as they phrase it, “ excellent for clearing the blood.” Lastly, it may be mentioned that foreign house- wives make all sorts of essences and tinctures by the simple process of infusing the desired aromatic in strong rectified spirit or even brandy, till the latter is strongly flavoured, keeping such tinctures very closely stoppered, as these flavours are usually very volatile. For instance, infuse the very thinly pared rind of some lemons in good brandy, keeping it closely stoppered, and shaking it daily. Essence of allspice, cloves, cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg, &c., can all be prepared in this way. Essence of ginger can be made by infusing loz. of bruised ginger in half a pint of strong spirit, with the thinly pared rind of half a lemon. These essences need no further treat- ment, if to be only used in the kitchen, but, if carefully filtered and mixed with a proportion of sugar syrup to taste, they will produce some very fair home-made liqueurs, which will, at all events, possess the merit of unconventionality.

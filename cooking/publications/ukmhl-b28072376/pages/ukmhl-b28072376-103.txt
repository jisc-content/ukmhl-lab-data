PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 91 spoons should alone be used. Glass bottles (Rviandâ€™s make are most useful for these) or jars are the best for storing, but of course where pickles in large quan- tities are made, stone jars may be used; only re- member in this case, to be particular in the covering if to be stored for some time, place a piece of bladder over the mouth of the bottle, force the cork in over this, and then tie down carefully with more moist- ened bladder. Another way is to put a piece of vegetable parchment into the neck, force in the cork as before, and then dip the mouth and neck of the bottle into boiling wax, which can be either bought ready made, or else mav be made thus at home : melt lib. of common red sealing wax, with lib. of black resin, and ^lb. of beeswax, melting it all over a very gentle fire, and stirring it during the process with a tallow candle to prevent its burning. Or the recipe for bottling-wax, previously given, will answer. Any way never think covering a jar with brown paper, however many the folds, will keep a jar airtight, for it will not, paper in itself not being airproof. Old- fashioned housewives, who always kept a store of pickles, &c., and prided themselves on their keeping powers,used to cork the jars and bottles but loosely for the firs'u two days, and then fill them up with scalded vinegar to the very neck, and lastly fasten them down closely; for the pickles absorb a great deal of the vinegar first poured into them, yet, unless they are perfectly covered with the liquid they will not keep. It must be borne in mind that all fermented liquors lose by boiling, so the vinegar should never (unless the contrary be expressly stated in the recipe) be

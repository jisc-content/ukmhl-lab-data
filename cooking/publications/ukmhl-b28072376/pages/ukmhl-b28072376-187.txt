Barley Sugar.—Prepare first of all some barley water, by pouring a quart of cold water ou to a handful of common barley; add the quarter of a thinly pared lemon rind, and let it all simmer to- gether for a couple of hours; let it stand for a little, and then pour it off carefully, when it should be quite clear. (If this is wanted simply as a drink, it must be flavoured and sweetened to taste, and if in a hurry a little can be got in half an hour, but it is not so good as when properly made ; if iced, this makes a delicious summer drink.) Now dissolve *21b. of best cane loaf sugar in a pint of this barley water, and bring it to the “ ball,” add a little lemon juice, and re-boil to the “ great crack ” ; now add a few drops of essence of lemon, pour the mass on to an oiled marble slab, and cut it into strips. Allow these to cool, and when nearly cold take each strip and twist it in your hands, and pack when perfectly cold in air-tight tins. Toffee (Assafrey).—This toffee is made by a well- known Glasgow confectioner, and is a form of the popular Bussian toffee. Put into a delicately clean stewpan a pound of brown (cane) sugar, with 4oz. of butter and a tablespoonful of water; bring this to the boil, then add to it a dessertspoonful of essence of vanilla and a gill of cream. Boil this till on dropping a little into cold water it will harden; then colour with a little cochineal or carmine, boil two minutes more, lift it off the fire and let it go off the boil before pouring it on to an oiled or buttered tin,

153 MEAT, &c., TO CURE. this brine away, and have ready a fresh one made by mixing together for each 141b. ham, l-^oz. saltpetre, 6oz. to 7oz. coarse salt, £lb. coarse sugar; lay the hams in the trough skin downwards, and rub them thoroughly with this mixture, being sure every part gets its share ; after three days of this treatment, pour over each ham a pint of vinegar, and keep it turned, basted, and well rubbed daily for a month; then smoke them for a month, hanging them rather high in the chimney lest the fat should melt, which it is apt to do when pickled in this way. (It may be observed that a flitch of bacon may be pickled by this recipe, and is particularly good, and keeps a long time, as the vinegar preserves it.) Hams pickled in this way are better baked than boiled, and at any rate must be cooked very gently and not overdone. The pork must be of first-rate quality. Hams, to Pichle (Italian fashion).—Mix together two quarts of Barolo wine (a rough red vin du pays, of the Burgundian type), three quarts cold water, 61b. coarse salt, nearly lib. bay salt, and about 6oz. salt- petre. Dissolve this all well, and when cool add to it an aromatic infusion as described above; then use it as in the preceding recipes. In Westphalia they boil together six quarts of water, 71b. of salt, nearly 21b. of sugar, lOoz. saltpetre, and 4oz. aromatic herbs, tied up in a piece of muslin ; when cold, strain and use. Bor Bayonne hams, make a pickle with two quarts good sound red Drench wine, three quarts cold water, 3|lb. of common salt, lOoz. bay salt, 5oz. saltpetre, and an infusion of rosemary, sage, and lavender.

19 CANNING AND BOTTLING. Though French beaus (like broad, or Windsor beans) can be perfectly bottled by the previous directions, the commonest method of preserving these most useful vegetables is this: Gather the French beans whilst young, and on a line day; put a fairly thick layer of salt at the bottom of a large, unglazed earthenware jar, and cover with a layer of beans, then more salt, and repeat these two layers till the jar is full, finishing with the salt. Cover with a clean cloth, lay a board on that, and lastly, a pretty heavy weight on that, to ensure its being air- tight. Be careful when taking out beans that the jar is carefully recovered, or they will not keep. To use them, wash them well when taken out, and then let them steep in soft water from twelve to twenty-four hours, changing the water pretty constantly. When boiled, do not salt them, but put a piece of butter with them, and season with lemon juice and white pepper. Again, it is not at all difficult to dry vegetables, and desiccated vegetables always form part of the winter stores abroad. For these, peel and shred fairly fine, potatoes, carrots, turnips, and such like, and boil them for five minutes in a wicker basket; (if you are drying cauliflowers, endive, parsley, spinach, &c., pick them over, and wash them well, then boil for five minutes) ; then rinse them all in cold water (iced if possible), drain them well and dry carefully on a clean cloth. When dry, spread the vegetables in thin layers on canvas frames, so that they do not stick together in lumps, and leave these frames in the oven for the night, in an even, c 2

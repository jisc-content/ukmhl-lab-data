Asparagus, to pickle.—Well clean and scrape the heads, removing the tough part of the white; lay the part to be preserved in cold spring water for two hours ; meanwhile boil some fresh spring or filtered water in a large pan with a handful of salt, and when this is boiling put in the asparagus a few pieces at a time, loose, and just scald them, lifting them out as soon as they are done with a skimmer, and lay them on a clean cloth, Have ready a boiling pickle, pre- pared as below, and as soon as the asparagus is cold lay it into jars, and pour on the spiced vinegar ; let it all stand, covered with a three or four times folded linen cloth, for a week, then pour off the vinegar, boil it up again sharply, and again pour this on the asparagus. Again let it stand a week, and repeat this boiling up a second time, then cover down closely with cork and bladder, or seal it well. For the vinegar: boil up two gallons of best white wiue vinegar, with 1 oz. baysalt, j oz. each of mace and white peppercorns and two nutmegs. Use when boiling.

They need no vinegar, their own acidity being sufficient. (Old- fashioned housewives prepared red currants in the same way.)

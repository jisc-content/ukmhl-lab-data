184 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. Pines.—Obtainable almost all the year round, but dear in the winter. Plums.—English, from beginning of August to the end of September; French begin and end a month earlier, whilst Californian are to be had from February to March. Pomegranates.—End of September to November. Quinces.—From the middle of September to the end of October. Raspberries.—From June to the end of August. Poivan (or Mountain Ash) Berries.—From August to October. Rhubarb.—From December to the end of August, counting forced and outdoor fruit. Strawberries.—From June to September, but usually end in August. Walnuts.—From September to Christmas, but for pickling in July.

Vegetables in Season.—As was said of fruit, the seasons for these can only be given approximately, but, unlike fruit, they are usually bottled or otherwise

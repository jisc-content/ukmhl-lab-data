167 MEAT, &c., TO CURE. over the meat in the pickling tub or barrel. This is an old Scotch recipe used when a “ mart ” or bullock was killed and the whole salted down for the winter use of the family. Mutton Hams:—These can be cured by almost any recipe given for pork ham, and if smoked make excellent rashers. Sprats, to Pichle.—Pound together 21b. common salt, 4oz. each of bay salt and saltpetre, 2oz. sal prunella, and a little cochineal. Now have ready a peck of sprats, and pack these in a stone jar, a row of sprats, then a layer of the above mixture, and repeat these two layers, pressing them down well till the jar is full; cover down closely, and keep in a cool, dry place for six months, when they will be ready. The sprats must be as fresh as it is possible to get them, and must be neither wiped nor washed. Salmon, to Kipper.—Cut up, clean and scale the dsh, and remove the bone neatly, then rub it well all over with equal parts of salt and brown sugar, to which you add a tiny pinch of saltpetre ; let the fish Lie in this for two days, covering it with a board rather heavily weighted, then hang it up to dry, if to be used as what is called “ green kipper” ; or if to be kept, smoke it. To prevent the folds spoiling, it is a good plan to spread open the fish, stretching it out with wooden skewers. Some housewives add freshly ground black pepper to the salt and sugar. It hardens very quickly, and if kept long in the smoking cupboard the slices should be soaked for twenty to thirty minutes before cooking. Herring and mackerel are delicious kippered in this way.

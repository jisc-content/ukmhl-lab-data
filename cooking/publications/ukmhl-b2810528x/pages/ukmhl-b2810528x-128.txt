Bread may be made in it very successfully when the boiling and baking processes necessary for a meal have been completed, and much heat remains still to be utilized.* (b) Roasting, or the cooking of meat by heat through radiation, and by heated dry air in front of a clear, bright fire ; the heat radiating from which into the “ roaster,” a metallic enclosure open towards the fire only, and containing the joint, turned therein by means of a bottle-jack.

This is accomplished in about eight to ten minutes for a large joint, or in four * “ The Art of Cooking,” by E. Atkinson, LL.D. New York : Appleton. 1889. A paper reprinted from the Science Monthly for November, 1889, and other reports and papers subsequently. Since that date Mr. Atkinson has carried his researches much further, embracing the economic and scientific bearings of food- production, the nature of man’s wants in relation thereto, with their results in the form of dietetics appropriate under varied circumstances, in a work full of information on all these subjects, entitled “The Science of Nutrition, and the Art of Cooking by the Aladdin Oven,” with directions and receipts.

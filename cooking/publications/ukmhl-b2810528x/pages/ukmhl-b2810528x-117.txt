Braising, two Modes. 109 it as exist in our cookery books, the process itself is scarcely understood. Certainly it is not one uniform method, to which the term is applied, and conse- quently an ordinary cook’s conception of it is apt to be somewhat loose and indefinite. The first principle essential to a braise is, that the meat so to be treated must be very Principles slowly cooked, that is, at a comparatively of braisin£- low temperature, and in a closely covered vessel, and with a small quantity of liquid. The second principle is, that the meat shall be im- pregnated in this process with the flavours of vege- tables, herbs, of highly flavoured cured meats, and some spices, and, if desired, with wine.

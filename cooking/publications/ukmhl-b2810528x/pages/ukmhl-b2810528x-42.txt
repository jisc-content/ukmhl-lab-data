Food and Feeding. 34 species of smaller monkeys, as well as the great baboons, all ranking lower in the scale of approach to man, live largely on insects * and small lizards, which abound in the African and South American forests; the baboons preying on eggs and young The large birds. The large anthropoids, just re- anthropoids. ferred to, also eat eggs and birds as well as small mammals, whenever they can get them, in addition to the fruits and nuts which form the great staple of their diet. Their mode of life, largely spent on the branches and higher parts of lofty trees, affords them great facilities for obtaining such food. Few people are aware that the large chimpanzee, The chim- so popular and well known as “ Sally,” andZatCS Zoological Gardens, was not in- Berlin. frequently supplied with animal food, which she evidently consumed with great satisfaction. It has been observed also that the gorillas and chimpanzees in the Zoological Gardens at Berlin have a marked preference for animal food, of which they enjoy a small proportion. As above noticed, their organization indicates that while they are certainly “ mixed feeders ”—that is, obtain their food from both the animal and vegetable kingdoms—they have been accustomed to consume a larger proportion of vegetable matter than is now usually adopted by Berlin.

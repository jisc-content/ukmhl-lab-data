Receipt for Beef-tea. 291 When cold, the fluid will be slightly gelatinous, varying somewhat as the meat used may vary in the amount of skin, tendon, or other fibrous tissue contained therein. If, however, “ shin of beef,” which, of course, includes bone, is used as well as gravy beef, say a pound of each, add the meat detached from the bone to the pound of gravy beef and treat them together as already described ; but utilize the bone by breaking it with a chopper or hammer, after which the pieces are to be placed in a small saucepan apart, with a pint of cold water, for an hour. Then the whole is to be slowly brought to boiling point, and to be maintained at the same until the liquid is reduced to the third of a pint, which is to be strained off and mixed with the beef-tea already made ; a firm jelly will result when cold. A strong solution of gelatine has thus been added to the meat extractives and albumen obtained by the first process, materially improving the value of the compound. When cold, remove the small quantity of fat which is always to be found on the surface, and heat what is required, as wanted. If the beef-tea is to be served as soon as made without cooling, remove as much of the fat as possible with a teaspoon, and the small remainder by means of white blotting-paper. No better vessel exists for the treatment of the meat (not for the bones) than a small Warren pot (see p. 99). Then it should be remembered that the beef-tea can be rendered far more nutritious, when the invalid is able to take any solid addition, by adding thereto a small quantity of well-minced rump-steak. For this purpose the meat should be brought to the condition of pulp by passing it three or four times through the best mincing machine which can be obtained, after having broiled the meat lightly only (see Mincing at pp. 168, 169).

Food and Feeding. 22 unless a sufficient quantity is supplied by food. It is a definite compound of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen with nitrogen, but often associated with a little sulphur and phosphorus also. “ Proteids ” from ani- are found in all animals used as food mals; by man ; and also in many produc- tions of the vegetable kingdom—from which two sources the body can alone be supplied. We find the proteid element abundantly in lean meat, the muscle of animals, where it is known as “ myosin,” also in the blood and other parts as “ fibrin.” There are, moreover, two modifications of nitrogenous com- pounds allied to, but not identical with, true proteids, viz. “gelatin” and “ chondrin,” in bones and cartilage respectively. Proteids are largely present in eggs, forming “ albumen,” or what is familiarly known as the 11 white of eggs ; ” and in milk as “ casein,” the nitrogenous constituent of cheese.

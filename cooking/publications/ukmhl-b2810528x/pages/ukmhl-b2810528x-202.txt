Food and Feeding. 194 than those conventional methods which have been universally employed in cookery are slowly adopted by the public, until attention has been thoroughly before the aroused on the subject. Nevertheless, fire> the method I am about to advocate is widely applicable, and well deserves at least to rank among the other and better known modes of pre- paring fish. It consists in placing the fish, after the usual cleaning, entire, if of moderate size, say from a sole to a small turbot or dory, in a block tin, aluminium, or pure nickel dish, adapted to the form and size of the fish, but a little deeper than the juices not to thickness of it, so as to retain all the evaporate, juices, which by exposure to the heat will flow out. First, however, the surface of the fish is to be lightly spread with butter, and a morsel or two added round it; the whole is then to be placed in a Dutch or American oven, in front of a clear fire.* The advan- tages of this method are, that the fish is cooked entirely in its own juices, which are abundant, and form the best sauce, and that these juices which contain part of the nutriment and much of the characteristic serving for basting and for sauce. Nutriment not wasted; * Mr. W. Burton, some time ago of Oxford Street, made for me an oven and dishes expressly for the purpose of cooking fish before the fire. The oven is a modification of that known as the “ American,” being rather deeper, from before backwards, and much shallower, from above downwards, on account of the flat \brm of fish not occupying the space which is required by joints sf meat.

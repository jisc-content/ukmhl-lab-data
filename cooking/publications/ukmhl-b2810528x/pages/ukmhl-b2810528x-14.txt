6 Preface. In the present and enlarged edition I have attempted to classify the various processes employed in cookery and its staple products in a more complete and natural order than heretofore, and to explain more fully the principles on which they are employed, the objects aimed at, and the rationale of each procedure. The subject of “slow cookery” is one which I have long practically studied with much interest, and I have recorded the result of various experiments. I am satisfied that in cooking food derived from the animal kingdom the longer application of low tem- peratures will render it more easily digestible and nutritious, as well as more agreeable than the old methods. By these latter I mean the long-established custom of cooking “joints” by the highest tempera- ture obtainable through boiling water, or by radiation from a fire in the course of two or three hours, viz. the familiar processes of “boiling” and “roasting” respectively. This subject is treated more fully here than in any previous edition. I venture to hope that the numerous elementary observations and practical hints relating to the very wide subject of Food and Feeding which have thus been brought together may prove useful, and tend to promote a still wider appreciation of one of the most important and interesting branches of inquiry demanded by the necessities of life and social intercourse. 35, Wimpole Street, July, 1901.

74 Food and Feeding, prepared by salting or other processes for transport, being not only less bulky, but more convenient for use without delay at any time. By no means to be depended on as a staple, or to take the place of fresh meat, it was a most valuable supplement when the latter was not available. It was better also, because it was relished cold, or could be con- verted in a few minutes into good soup with boiling water. But for our labourer probably the best of the legumes is the haricot bean, red or white, the dried mature bean of the plant whose pods we eat in the early green state as “ French beans.” * For this purpose they may be treated thus: Soak, say, a quart of the dried haricots in cold water for about sixteen to twenty-four hours, after which place them in a saucepan, with two quarts of cold water and a little salt, on the fire; when boiling remove to the corner and simmer slowly until the beans are tender ; the time required being about at least three hours.f This quantity will fill * What we call “ French beans ” may be the product of several kindred varieties of the kidney bean, dwarf or climbing, varying according to locality and soil, and distributed over a very large part of Europe. When gathered early, before it is fully grown, the bean is green, like a green pea, and forms an admirable dish, known in France as flageolets. When the ordinary French beans (immature green pods) are mixed in about equal propor- tions with the flageolets, the dish, which is a very palatable one, is well known in France as haricots vertspanacluts (variegated), and might be served at our tables with advantage. f If the water is hard, a little soda should be added to soften it.

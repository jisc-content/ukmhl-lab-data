If, instead of meat, we employ a good vegetable stock, agreeably flavoured with carrot, turnip, onion, and savoury herbs, a first- rate soup inaigre is produced. When, in place of meat, a broth chiefly made from game—especially from the remains of a hare, the prime parts of which have been consumed at table—is thickened with red haricot purte, the result is an excellent and other soup, which in texture and in flavour combina- would by many persons not be distin- tions. guishable from a common purie of game itself. A hint for those who do not despise economy in cuisine, when the value of the product is unquestionable.

The general outlines of a man’s mental character and physical tendencies are doubtless influence of largely determined by the impress of race- race and family. That is to say, the scheme of the building, its characteristics and dimensions, are in- herited ; but to a very large extent the materials and filling in of the individual’s framework depend, in regard of their quality, upon his food Influence and training. By the latter term may of food and , , training, be understood all that relates to mental and moral and even to physical education, assumed to be fairly provided for, and not to be considered here. No matter, then, how consummate the scheme of the architect, nor how vast the design, more or less of failure to rear the edifice results when the materials are ill chosen or for the most part un- worthy to be used. Other sources of failure there may be which it is no part of my business to note ; but the influence of food is not only itself cardinal in rank, but, by priority of action, is the source of various forces, injurious or the reverse, as the case may be. A very slight sketch of the course of development observed in the most ordinary types of human life will suffice to illustrate this truth.

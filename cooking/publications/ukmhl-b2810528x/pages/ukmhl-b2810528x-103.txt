Hence, if we desire to realize the first- named object, for stock soup or beef-tea, some meat, previously cut fine, is macerated for two x For or three hours in cool or tepid water beef-tea; after which the temperature is very slowly raised to about 150°, and maintained there for some time. At the end of the process, not only much soluble nutritive matter referred to as albumen, but other valuable constituents, “extractives,” and salts will be found dissolved in the liquid also. See the process for making beef-tea, which will be found in the Appendix. If, on the contrary, we desire to retain within the portion, say a leg of mutton, all its , P nutritive quality and its natural juices inS a joint°k" and Its flavour, for a dish at table, the joint is to be immersed in a capacious pot of boiling water, to which a little salt has been withToihhg added, and kept boiling for from five to seven minutes. The object of this is to solidify or coa“ ate, as it is usually termed, a thin layer of albunfen on the entire surface of the joint.

Food and Feeding. 286 clear soup, and the process of making it will be given with all necessary details. These are shorter and more simple than the extremely full directions given by Goufffi, in his classical work “ Le Livre de la Cuisine,” which in previous edilions of the present volume were translated at consider- able length.* Take an ordinary gallon stock-pot of copper tinned, with a cover for occasional use only. Ingredients: 2 lbs. of good fresh lean beef from the leg, with f lb. of bone ; six ounces each of carrots, turnips, leeks, and onions, one of celery and two of parsnips; a clove stuck in an onion, and a small bunch of kitchen herbs, parsley, thyme, and chervil; a rather small teaspoonful of salt; four and a half pints of water. Crush the bones well with a mallet, putting them into the pot first. Cut the meat into small morsels, an inch or a little more each way, removing all the fat, and laying them on the bones. Next, pour in all the water cold; and place the pot without its cover on the corner of a steady gentle fire or gas ring. Add the salt, and bring gently to the i>oil. As soon as the scum rises, remove it with a perforated spoon, and when the liquor boils, pour in a small cupful of cold water to check it and make the scum rise. Bring it slowly again to boiling at least twice, scumming and check- ing with cold water as before each time, which should suffice. Meanwhile, having sliced the vegetables named, now add them to the pot, which again checks the boiling for a time. When it begins again, draw the pot aside so that it now only simmers, which it should continue to do * J. Gouffe, “ Le Livre de la Cuisine,” pp. 39~47- Paris : 1867. Thus he writes : “The production of a goodpol-au-feu seems to me to be one of those operations, at the same time elementary and fundamental, with which it is of the highest importance to render every one familiar, as soon as domestic cooking is treated of ” (v. p. 299).

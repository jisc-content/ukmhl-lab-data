For Soups and Braising. 289 Gouffe continues: “ The important question, after the choice of the meat, is the cooking, which must be done entirely by slow simmering; and this is one of the most essential points for success. For when exposed to a hot fire the result is a white, watery, insipid gravy, such as is too often found in kitchens where cooking is carelessly done. The gravy ought to be red in colour, rather gelatinous in consistence, and full of the agreeable flavour and nutri- tive matter of both meat and vegetables, which is the dis- tinctive mark of the dish. To obtain this excellent quality, the vegetables should be put into the braising-pot at the proper time, so that all are cooked together.” * I cannot resist adding that Gouffe’s directions amount almost to an early step in the direction of the slow process in cookery, which I have advocated so much during the last few years. This braise would probably be still more excellent if, after the initial boiling and skimming, it were submitted only to a temperature not exceeding 1750 Fahr. during seven or eight hours.

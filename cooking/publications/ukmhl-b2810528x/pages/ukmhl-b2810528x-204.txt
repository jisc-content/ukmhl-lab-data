But the working man also can thus advantageously cook before his kitchen fire, in a common Dutch oven, some fillets of plaice or skate with a slice or two of bacon ; the dish to be filled or garnished with some previously boiled haricots; and by this means he may secure an economical and most savoury meal, which is at the same time nutritious. This is but a single illustration among many which might be adduced, of what may be done by this simple method for those whose resources are of the slenderest kind. Having regard to this question of economy and preserving the juices of the fish, it should Boiling fish, 1 r a wasteful never be forgotten that by boiling it in process. any manner considerable waste of nutri- tive material occurs. Relative to this subject, I have made numerous experiments, and find that the loss in weight by boiling varies with different fish, and also with the mode of operating. It is rarely as low as five per cent., it is generally much more, and I have known it to reach thirty per cent., the water in which the fish has been boiled containing of course a certain amount of lost solid animal matter. In order to avoid waste as much as possible, the fish should be placed in absolutely boiling water, which should contain a good proportion of salt. The liquor

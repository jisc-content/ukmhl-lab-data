Mincing, a Valuable Process. 169 rendering it more easily digested, which may be briefly described here. I refer to the use Minci. of a good mincing machine for the purpose of producing very fine divisions of the muscular fibres. I do not so much refer to its employment for serving afresh the c J ° useful for remains of food which have been already ordinary cooked, as for its preparation of fresh PurP0jes> meat with a special object in view. For the former, order to produce mince-meat, or in also for a special product; material for rissoles, etc., the process is, of course, extremely useful. I refer rather to the value of this treatment of fresh meat, where sufficient mastication is difficult, owing to imperfect teeth or tender gums, or where for fresh habitual mastication is neglected, or ®eftwhen when time cannot really be bestowed imperfect, on it. The human stomach being adapted almost solely for the digestion of flesh, and not at all for that of vegetable and farinaceous matters, which arc chiefly digested in the first intestine beyond the stomach, it is of the highest importance that animal fibre, whether of butcher’s meat, game, or poultry, should be minutely divided by a prolonged me- chanical action of the teeth before it is subjected to the chemical process, that is, digestion by the gastric juice which takes place in the stomach.

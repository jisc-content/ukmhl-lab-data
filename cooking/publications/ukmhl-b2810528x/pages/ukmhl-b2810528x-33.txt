Vegetable Food, its Components. 25 it will be seen that the proteids, as well as the fats, are not only less bountifully supplied, but exist in a form generally not so well adapted for man s digestion as those which are obtained from the animal kingdom. The most valuable proteid of the vegetable kingdom, since it is easily assimilated by the human stomach, is furnished in moderate quantity by certain members of the cereal class Gluten above named, viz. “ gluten,” and is con- sumed for the most part here in the form of wheaten bread. Next comes the extensive order of leguminous plants, beans, peas, and lentils, which, containing a very considerable amount of the proteid Legumin. “ legumin,” or “ vegetable casein, ’ furnish cheap and excellent food, although inferior to wheaten bread, which contains less of the nitrogenous element. It is quite true that chemical analysis shows the presence of a larger proportion of that element, the legumin, in dried peas, lentils, or haricots, than is found in an equal weight of butcher’s meat, of its corresponding proteid. But, on the other hand, none of the former furnish a proteid in so digestible a form as that of beef or mutton, many human stomachs failing to digest easily the leguminous product.* From the flesh of animals man acquires its * For further information respecting this indubitable fact, see the work below named, where it is attentively and impartially considered. The tabulated result is given of carefully made experiments by Fr. Hofmann, on the power of man’s digestive organs to assimilate the nitrogenous elements (albumen) from animal and vegetable sources respectively. From the data

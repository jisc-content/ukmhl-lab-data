Chloride of lime is an infallible preventive of rats. It should be put down their holes and spread about wherever they are likely to appear. If the cook has the misfortune to spill grease on the kitchen table, she may save herself a great deal of trouble by sprinkling the stain at onoe with coarse salt; this prevents the grease from sinking into the wood; or, if spilled on the floor, dash cold water over it, so as to harden it quickly, and prevent it sinking into the boards. Prepare new baking tins b^ placing in oven with thick layer of bran in them until bran is quite dry. Puddings, etc., will then never stick. To prevent tlie hands being burnt when dishing up Christmas puddings, put the hand repeatedly into cold water before handling the basin, and it will not be burnt. Do the same when using hot starch. Persons of sedentary and quiet occupations and habits, with much brain work, require food light and easily digested, avoiding all in- digestible and very concentrated foods (e.g., cheese), whieh are more suitable for manual work.

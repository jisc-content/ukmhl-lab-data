The bad way is that which they generally follow, viz., to swallow a large quantity at once. When milk goes into the stomach it is in- stantly curdled, and if it is curdled into one big mass, the juices of the stomach can work on only the outside of it. This is the reason that many people who like milk, and to whom it should be of the utmost benefit, cannot drink it. They say it gives them indigestion, and they are right. Let them give it another chance. But this time they must sip it slowly, not taking more than a good teaspoonful at one sip, and taking at least four minutes to finish the glassful. Each little sip thus becomes curdled up by itself when it passes into the stomach, the digestive juices percolate freely around it, and it speedily becomes assimilated. One of the best restoratives known after excessive fatigue, and one infinitely preferable to any fomi of alcohol, is a glass of hot milk. The heat seems to lighten it, and to deprive it of much of the sweetness which is so cloying tO' some tastes. A little bread should always be taken with milk. Oatmeal Drink (1).

PREFACE. success which has attended nine editions of Tried Favoukhes has abundantly proved that, even in these days when Cookery liooks flood the market, and almost every newspaper has its household . column, our book of ‘^tried” and proved “favourites” has found its place. The need for good, nourishing food, well cooked and tastefully served, is the need of all ages. It has been said that they who provide the food of the world decide the health of the world. That being the case, the more knowledge there can be disseminated on such an im- portant subject the better; and the result of long years’ knowledge bought by experience cannot fail to help many a perplexed housewife in these days of hurry and high pressure. I As was stated in the first edition, the book does not claim to be original. The idea is, that every housewife has her own special recipes, or tit-bits of household information, the result of practical experience. These tested recipes, gathered from a wide circle of friends, have formed a most useful Cookery Book, as has been amply proved by the success and rapid sale of nine editions. E. W. KIRK.

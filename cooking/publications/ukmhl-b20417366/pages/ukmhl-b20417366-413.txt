Punch,—Put a saltspoonful of black tea in a crockery pot, with one clove, a little cinnamon, and the rind of a lemon cut in pieces; pour on the whole half a pint of boil- ing water; let it remain thus five minutes, and strain. Put a bottle of rum or brandy in a crockery vessel, with twelve ounces of loaf-sugar, set the rum or brandy on fire, * and let burn till it stops. Then mix tea and rum together, and it is ready for use. It is drunk cold or warm, ac- cording to taste. "When wanted warm, if made previous- ly, set it on a moderate fire, in a tin or crockery kettle. It keeps very well if carefully bottled and corked when cold. Another way to make it is to mix the rum or brandy with the tea without burning it. It is v/armed, used, and kept like the above. The quantity of water may be re- duced or augmented, according to taste, and so also the sugar.

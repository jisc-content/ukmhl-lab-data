EGGS, MACARONI, AJ^D RICE. In the Shell.—Bear in mind that some eggs cook quicker than others. Put eggs in boiling water for two minutes, if liked soft or underdone; and three minutes, if liked more done. They are generally served enveloped in a napkin. In Matelote,—Put a bottle of claret wine in a stewpan and set it on a good lire; add to it two sprigs of parsley, one of thyme, a clove of garlic, a rniddling-sized onion, a clove, a bay-Jeaf, salt, and pepper; boil fifteen minutes; then take all the seasonings out and have your wine boil- ing gently; break one egg in by letting it fall gently in order to have it entire, and then take it out immediately with a skimmer, and place it on a dish; do the same with eight eggs; keep them in a warm (but not hot) place. After whicb put in the wine, without taking it from the fire, four ounces of butter kneaded with a tablespoonful of flour; boil till reduced to a proper thickness, pour it on the eggs, and serve. With Onions.—Cut in dice three middling-sized onions and put them in a saucepan with four ounces of butter; set it on a moderate fire and stir now and then till the onions are turning yellow, then sprinkle on them a teaspoonful i : flour, salt, and pepper; add a pint of warm water and boil gently till rather thick, but not too much so. Put into the saucepan half a dozen hard-boiled eggs cut in four pieces each, lengthwise, boil gently two or three minutes longer, and serve warm. With Green Peas.—Proceed as for eggs with asparagus, except that you boil a gill of peas instead of asparagus; prepare and serve in the same way. With Cauliflowers.—Blanch the cauliflowers and pro- ceed as for the above. Eggs are prepared as abovCj with celery, lettuce, etc. 16

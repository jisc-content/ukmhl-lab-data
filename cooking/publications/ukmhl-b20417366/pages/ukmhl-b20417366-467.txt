The above table sliows the number of dishes, but more than one dish of the same kind can be served; for instance, four kinds of potages, releveSy etc., are served for forty; but two or four dishes of each kind can be served. The size of the releves and rots should be according to the number of guests. It is just as easy to select dishes for a small family- dinner as for a grand one; two, three, four, or more dishes can be selected; for instance, you select a potage, an en- ^tree or rot^ or both, one vegetable or a sweet dish, or both; and one or as many plates of dessert as you please. Have a bouquet on the middle of the table, if possible, or at least a basket of fruit. Flowers during dinner have the same effect as music after it; they soften the manners, and gently and sweetly gratify the senses. To simplify and render the making of bills of fare easy, we have divided the different dishes into seven parts, each part being in the order the dishes of which must be served, and representing the seven kinds of dishes composing a dinner. By this means you select the dish or dishes which suit you, and which you can procure in any or all of the seven parts, and your bill of fare is made, and more to your liking than any steward on earth can do.

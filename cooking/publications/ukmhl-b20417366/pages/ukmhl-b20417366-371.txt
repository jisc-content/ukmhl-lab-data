EGGS, MACARONI, AND RICE. 365 the disli by raising the left side, place tlie edge of the pan (the one opposite to the handle) on the edge of the dish, turn it upside down—and jou have the omelet on the dish, doubled up and sightly. Cooks do not succeed in turning out a decent omelet generally, because they cook it too ranch, turn it upside down in the" pan, or because they do not know how to handle the pan. In holding the pan as it is generally and naturally held, that is, with the palm of the hand resting on the upper side of the handle, it is impossible for anybody, cook or other, to dish the omelet properly without extraordinary efforts; while by resting the thumb on the upper part of the handle, the fingers under it, the little finger being the nearest to the pan, it is only necessary to move the right hand from right to left, describing a circle and twisting the wrist, so that, when the pan is turned upside down, the fingers are up instead of downward, as they were when taking hold of the pan. An omelet is called soft if, when you commence to fold, only about two-thirds of'the eggs are solidified ; and hard, when nearly the whole of the eggs are solidified. With a good fire it takes only about four minutes to make an omelet. By following our directions carefully, it will be very easy to make an omelet, and make it well and sightly, even the first time, and will be child's play to make one after a few days' practice. With Apples.—Peel two or three apples, cut them in thin, round slices, fry them with a little butter, and take them from the pan ; then put a little more butter in the pan, and when hot, pour in it six beaten eggs, in which you have mixed the slices of apples ; cook, dish, and serve as directed above.

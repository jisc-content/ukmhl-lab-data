POULTRY. 239 put the bird on the tabic on its back, and with a chop- per or with a round .stick flatten the breast-bone, which you break at a sing-le blow if possible; the bird is much more sightly when served. Cut the legs off just above the first joint, or cut off only half of the claws and trim oU the ends of the wings. Place the bird on a table, the breast up and the rump toward you. Push the legs under the skin, so that, by holding them perpendicularly and pressing on them, the part from the second to the third jonit is alongside the chicken, or horizontally. Then run a trnss- ing-needle, with twine attached to it, just above the bone of the leg, as near the second joint as possible, on the side (toward you) of the bone of the leg that is perpendicularj through the leg (which leg is the left one of the bird), body, and also through the bird, and at the same place, that is, as near the second joint as possible. Turn the bird upside down and the neck toward you; turn the ends of the wings on the back, as seen in the cut (p. 240), turn the skin of the neck on the back also, between or under the wings and in order to cover the place where the neck has been cut off, then ran the needle again through the right wdng, the skin of the neck and part of the body, and through the other wing. Tie the ends of the twme fast together. As it is, the legs of the bird, when on its back, are pointing upward. Bend them gently dowTi till they are perpendicular and as seen in the cut, run the trussing- needle through both and also through the body, above the bones of the legs and under the end of the breast-bone; run it again the other wa}^ but under the bones of the legs, tie the two ends of the twine together, and you have a bird trussed exactly like the one represented in the cut on next page.

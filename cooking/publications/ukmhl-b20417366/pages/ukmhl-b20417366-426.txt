PASTRY. 420 With Veal.—Fill the vdl-au-vent with veal in hlan- quette^ in ragout, or in hourgeoise^ and serve. It is gen- erally filled with what has been left the day previous, as it requires very little for a vol-au-vent. With Brains,—It may he filled with brains of calf, pig, sheep, or veal; prepared in poulette, or stewed. With Rahhit,—Fill it with part of a rabbit saute. It may also be filled with any other meat or fish, ac- cording to taste, and being cooked previously. JVith Fruits.—Fill the vol-au-vent with any kind of stewed fruit, jelly, sweetmeats, etc. It may be only filled, or the fruit may be dressed in pyramid inside of it. Bouchees,-—Boudiees^ or petites houchees, as they are sometimes called, are small, round vol-au-vent, served warm. They are also called houchees de dames and petites houchees. Koll puff-paste dow^n to a thickness of about one-quarter of an inch, cut it w4th a paste-cutter of any size, mark the cover, and bake in an oven at about 450° Fahr. A good size is about three inches in diameter. When cut, take another paste-cutter about two inches in diameter, y^lace it on the piece of paste; press, on it just enough to mark the place where it was, but not enough to cut the paste, remove it and then the cover is marked; that is, you have a circle on the top of the paste, half an inch from the edge all around. Glaze with egg and bake. Make one for each person. Immediately on taking them from the oven, cut off the cover with a sharp-pointed knife. That is easily done ; it is only necessary to follow the mark made with the paste-cutter, which is just as visible as before baking. Eemove the cover and then carefully take out some unbaked paste inside of the houchee, fill with lobster prepared as directed below, put the cover on, and serve as warm as possible.

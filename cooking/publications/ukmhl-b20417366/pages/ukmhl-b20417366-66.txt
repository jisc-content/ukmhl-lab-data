60 DIVEES RECEIPTS. WELSH RAREBIT. This disli is not generally understood. It is tliougM by many to be Welsh rabbit, that is, a rabbit prepared Welsh fasldon. It is not a rabbit, but YV^elsh cheese (a certain kind only, and prepared for that purpose), ncielted to a certain degree, and then spread on toast of Welsh bread. Grate sonae Gloucester or Gruyere cheese and pepper it with Cayenne pepper. Fry some slices of bread with a little butter, but on one side only, until perfectly yellow, then spread a thick coat of grated cheese on the fried side of the bread, place the slices in a baking-pan, put them in a pretty warm oven, take oft* when it begins to melt, and serve warm. Then you have as good a Welsh rarebit as can be made here. The receipt was given to us by an English lady.

156 FISH. To blanch,—tlie oysters and a little water on the fire in a saucepanj take thern off at the first boil, skim off the scum from the top, strain them, and drop them in cold water. The skimming, straining, and dropping in cold water must be done quickly—the quicker the better. If allowed to stay in the warm water, or out of water, they get tough. In dropping them in cold water, see that they are free from pieces of shell; take them with a fork if necessary. As soon as in cold water they are ready for use, but they must always be drained again before using them. When the water used to blanch is employed in pre- paring them, it is explained in the different receipts. White wine may be used, instead of water, to blanch them, according to taste. Fried,—O^Qu the oysters, and put them in a colander for about half an hour. They must be as well drained as possible. Then dip them in egg and roll in bread-crumbs in the following way : Beat one or two, or three, eggs (according to the quantity of oysters to be fried),'as for an. omelet, turn the oysters into the eggs and stir gently; then take one after another, roll in bread-crumbs; place each one on your left hand, in taking them from the crumbs, and with the other hand press gently on it. Put them away in a cool place for about half an hour, and then dip again in egg, roll in bread-crumbs, and press in the hand as before. It is not indispensable to dip in egg and roll in crumbs a second time; but the oysters are better, and you are well repaid for the little extra work it re- quires, W^hile you are preparing them, set some fat on the fire in a pan, and when hot enough (see Frying) drop the oysters in, stir gently, take off with a skimmer when fried, turn into a colander, add salt, and serve hot.

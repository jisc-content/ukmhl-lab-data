Continue to run the knife between the bones and flesh, on tbe same side, till you come to the breast-bone. Do the same on the otber side. Full out the crop and cut off the rump from the body, but without touching the skin, as the rump must come off with the skin and flesh. Then by taking hold of the bird by the neck with the left hand, and pulling the skin gently down with the right, you partly uncover the upper part of the breast-bone; then again run the knife between that bone and the flesh, on both sides, till you come nearly to the end or edge of the bone. Then lay the bird on its back, have somebody to take hold of it by the neck, hav- ing the breast of the bird toward you. All along the edge of the breast-bone there is no flesh between the bone and the skin. The bird being held as described above, take hold of the skin of the neck with your left hand, pulling gently downward, and with the knife detaching the skin carefully from the bone, the carcass coming off* whole. Place the bird on the table, the inside up, pull out the bones of the wings and legs, scraping the flesli all around so as to leave it attached to the rest; pull or scrape ofl" all the tendons of the legs; push legs and wings inside the bird; see that the rump is clean; cut off* the ring under it if necessary.

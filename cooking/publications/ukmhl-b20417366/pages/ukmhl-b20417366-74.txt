68 POTAGES OR soups; *stuck in it, a bay-leaf, six pepper-corns, and two cloves of garlic. Simmer about three hours, and take the birds out of the kettle ; simmer then two hours longer; strain, and the broth is ready for use. Game-broth is warming and stimulating; it may be taken alone, or prepared with croutons^ rice, vermicelli, or other Italian pastes, the same as beef-broth. The prairie-hens are served in salmis^ and the beef is served as boiled beef. Snail,—Clean and prepare twenty-five snails as direct- ed. Put them in a saucepan, with a carrot, an onion, and a head of lettuce, all chopped, a small handful of chervil, a few leaves of sorrel, and a little salt; cover the whole with three pints of cold water. Boil slowly for about three hours, strain the broth, add a little butter to it, and it is ready for use. A tumblerful of this broth, taken warm before retiring, is certainly the best thing for a consumptive person. It is also excellent for a cough. Just salt the snails to taste, and eat them as they are, warm or cold. F«?aZ.—Procure two pounds of veal, from the neck or breast piece. Put the meat in a soup-kettle with two quarts of cold water and a little salt; set it on a good fire, and skim off the scum as soon as it gathers on the surface. When skimmed, add a head of lettuce, a leek (and a few stalks of chewii if handy) ; simmer for about three hours; strain, and use. This broth, as well as chicken and turkey broth, is ex- cellent for convalescent persons. It may be made richer by putting a little more meat, according to taste; but generally the physician gives di- rections.

PASTRY. 418 TalvG from the oven when baked, and immediately run the point of the knife all aroand and in the same place as you did before being baked, which place is well marked. Thus you cut off the cover and remove it, then remove also all the unbaked paste that is inside of the vol-au-vent^ so that you have left what may be called a shell Keep it then till the oysters or meat are ready to put in it. About five minutes before the filling is ready, put the shell or baked paste in a slow oven to warm it, turn the filling into it, enough to fill it entirely; place the cover on the top, and serve warm. The unbaked paste removed from the inside is baked, and makes an excellent cake, though not a sightly one. Another,—-Qui a piece of puft-paste the same as for the above one, that is, either round or oval, and of the size you wish. Instead of marking a cover, glaze the bor- der with egg.

Then cut a strip of puff-paste about three-quar- ters of an inch broad, long enough to cover the place or space glazed, w^hich strip you put all around the first paste, and you then have a border. The place between the two pastes being glazed, they will adhere in baking. Then also glaze the upper side of the border carefully with egg. With a knife or fork, prick the paste, inside of the border only, in ten, fifteen, or twenty places, according to the size of the vol-au-vent^ and in order to prevent thnt part from rising as much as it would if not pricked. Bake in the same oven as the above—a very quick one. A vol~au-vent thus made is deeper than the first one, having two thicknesses of paste. Generally there is little or no paste (unbaked) to remove; having pricked the cen-

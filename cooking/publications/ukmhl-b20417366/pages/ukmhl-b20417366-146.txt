FISH. 140 heurre noin When clean, boil tlie fish as directed, and disli it, sprinkling salt and pepper on it. While it is boiling, put about two ounces of butter to a pound of fish in a frying-pan, set it on a sharp fire, stir now and then, and when brown, throw into it about six sprigs of parsley, which you take off* immediately with a skimmer. As soon as the parsley is taken off", pour the butter over the fish, quickly put two tablespooufuls of vinegar in the frying-pan and over the fire, give one boil, and pour also over the fish. Frying the parsley and boil- ing the vinegar cannot be done too fast, as the fish must be served very warm. The warmer it is served, the better it IS. Salmon^ sturgeon^ and white-fish^ after being baked or boiled, may be served with a caper, and also with a Mayonnaise sauce. They may also be served in court • bouillon J like bass. They are broiled whole, or in slices, and served with a maitre hotel or a caper sauce. The same in Fricandeau.—Cut the fish in slices about half an inch thick, and place them in a saucepan with slices of fat salt pork, carrots and onions under them ; set on a good fire; ten minutes after, add a little broth, just enough to cover the bottom of the pan ; after about five minutes, turn the slices over; finish the cooking and serve with the gravy strained over the fish, or with a tomato- sauce. The same in Papillotes,—Fry slices of salmon with a little butter, and until of a golden color; take them from the fire. While they are frying, mix well together parsley chopped fine, salt, pepper, melted butter, grated nutmeg, and a little lemon-juice; spread some of the mixture on both sides of the slices of fish, envelop them in buttered or oiled paper; broil, and serve them hot.

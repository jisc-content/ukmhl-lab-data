161 FISH. FisJi Chowder,—Th.h is made exactly ris clairi chow- der^ using iisli instead of clams. Clam BaJce.—ThA^ is how it is made by tlie Harlem River clam-baker, Tom Eiley« Lay tbe clams on a rock, edge downward, and forming a circle, cover them with fine brush; cover the brush with dry sage; cover the sage with larger brash; set the whole on fire, and when a little more than half burnt (brush and sage)y look at the clams by pulling some out, and if done enough, brush the fire, cinders, etc., oft'; mix some tomato or cauliflower sauce, or catsup, with the clams (minus their shells); add butter and spices to taste, and serve. J3one on sand, the clams, in opening, naturally allow the sand to get in, and it is any thing but pleasant for the teeth while eating them.

11 COOKING. Broiling on live coals or on cinders without a gridiron is certainly not better than with one, as believed by many; on the contrary, besides not being very clean, it burns or chars part of the meat. That belief comes from the fact that when they par- took of meat prepared that way, it was "with a sauce that generally accompanies hunters, fishermen, etc.,—hunger— the most savory of all savory sauces. Frying,—That part of cooking is not as difficult as it is generally believed, and properly fried objects are good and do not taste greasy. To fry requires care, and nothing fried will taste greasy if it has been dropped in fat properly heated and in enough of it to immerse the object. When an object tastes greasy, it is not because it ha? been fried in grease, but because there was not enough of it, or because it was not properly heated; for, if heated enough it closes the pores of the object and carbonizes tho exterior, so that it cannot absorb any. Directions for Frying,—Prepare what you intend to fry according to the directions given in the diflerent receipts. Have fat, lard, or oil in a pan, enough to immerse the object or objects intended to be fried. "When the fat is hot enough (see below), place the object in a kind of wire basket made for that purpose, which drop in the fat and take off when the object is fried. It is handy, and there is no danger of breaking the object in taking it ofi*. There are objects that require to be stirred or turned over while frying. Every time you fry any thing, take the fat from the fire, let it stand in a cool place for about five minutes,

18 DIEECTIONS, EXPLAITATIONS, ETC. BRAISING. Braising, in cookery, means to cook any thing with lire under and upon the pan, kettle, or other utensil. A good oven is by far more easy, and answers perfect- ly the purpose. An oven not only warms the under and upper parts of the utensil, but all around it also. BUXCH OF SEASONINGS. It is composed of parsley, thyme, bay-leaf, and cloves, and sometimes a clove of garlic is added. Place the sprigs of parsley in the left hand, rather spread, lay the others on and in the middle of the parsley, and envelop them in it as well as possible, then tie the whole with twine. As all these seasonings are never served except when chopped, they are more easily taken out than if they were not tied together. BUTTERED PAPER. Dip in lukewarm butter a piece of white paper of the size you want, and envelop the piece to broil or roast with it. Tie the paper around with twine or coarse thread. OILED PAPER. ' The only difference between oiled and buttered paper is, that it is dipped in sweet or olive oil instead of butter. CATSUP.

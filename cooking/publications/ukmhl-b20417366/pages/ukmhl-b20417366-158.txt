Croquettes,—Lobster croquettes are made exactly like fish-hallsj and then fried according to directions for frying. They are served warm. It is an excellent disl\ for hreahfast. Fried.—To be fried, the lobster must be bled ; separate the body from the tail, then cut the tail in pieces, making as many pieces as there are joints. . Put these pieces in a fryiog-pan with, two or three ounces of butter, and one onion, chopped fine; set on J^sharp fire, stir now and then till the whole is fried, then add a bunch of seasoning composed of three sprigs of parsley, one of thyme, a bay- leaf, and a clove; salt, pepper, and three gills of Madeira wine; boil gently till reduced about half; dish the pieces of lobster according to faucy; add two or three tablespoon- fuls of gravy to the sauce, stir it, give one boil, and turn it over the lobster through a strainer; serve warm. Another way,—Proceed as above in every particular, except that you use Sauterne or Catawba wine instead of Madeira, and, besides the seasonings, add half a dozen mushrooms, or two truffles, or both.

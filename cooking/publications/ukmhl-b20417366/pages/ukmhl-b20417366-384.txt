SWEET DISHES. 378 same way as the preceding one, it will break under the teeth, but will not stick to them. Above 44 the mark is uncertain, the syrup being too thick ; it passes from that state to that of caramel; is colored, and would burn imme- diately. When that happens, make burnt sugar with it according to direction. Apples au Beurre^'—Yiifii and core tLi3 apples with a fruit-corer. Cut slices of stale bread about one-quarter of an inch in thickness, and then cut them again of a round shape with a paste-cutter and of the size of the ap- ples. Spread some butter on each slice and place an apple on each also. Butter a bakepan, place the apples and ^ bread in, fill the hole made in the middle of the apple to core it with sugar; place on the top of the sugar and on each a piece of butter the size of a hazel-nut, and set in a warm, but not quick oven. When about half done, fill the hole again with sugar and a pinch of cinnamon, place but- ter on top as before, and finish the cooking, serve warm. When done, they may be glazed with apple-jelly and put back in the oven for two minutes ; the dish is more sightly. Flamhantes.-—\j2i.y apples in a saucepan, after being peeled and cored, add sugar to taste, and water enough just to cover them, also a stick of cinnamon, and set on a rather slow fire, and leave till done. Take them from the pan carefully and without breaking them ; place them on a tin or silver dish, forming a kind of pyramid or mound ; turn the juice over them, dust with sugar, pour good rum all over, set it on fire, and serve immediately and warm. As soon as on tire it is placed on the table, and the host must baste with the rum so as to keep it burning till all the alco- hol is exhausted, then serve. The following cut represents either a dish of apples Jlamhantes before being in fiames, or apples with rice.

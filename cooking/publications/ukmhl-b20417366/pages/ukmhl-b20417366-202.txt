196 MUTTON. SHEEP'S KIDNEYS, BROILED. Split tbem in two, and put them in cold water for five minutes; trim off the pellicle or thin skin, run a skewer through, sprinkle salt and pepper on, place them on'the gridiron, and set on a good fire; turn over, and when broiled, serve them with a piece of butter and chopped parsley kneaded together, and placed on each kidney ; add also a few drops of lemon-juice. You may also, when broiled, serve them on a maitre dliotel sauce. The same, in Brochette.—Proceed as above in every particular,, except that you place the kidneys on the spit instead of on the gridiron. Serve them in the same way. The same, with Champagne.—Cut the kidneys in slices, each in ten or twelve pieces. Put in a stewpan a piece of butter the size of two walnuts, and set it on the fire; when melted, add a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, same of mushrooms, a pinch of grated nutmeg, salt, pepper, and the kidneys; keep tossing till they become stifi', then sprinkle on them a saltspoonful of flour, stirring with a wooden spoon the while ; add also a wine-glass of Cham- pagne, or of good white wine; subdue the fire, and let simmer till cooked; take from the fire, add about one ounce of fresh butter, and the juice of half a lemon, and serve. This is a very delicate dish. SHEEP'S TAILS.

157 FISH. Boasted.—Pl^ce the oysters on a hot stove or range, or on coals, and as soon as they open tahe off, remove one she]]; turn a little melted butter on each, and serve. Tliere are several other ways. When blanched, they are served on toast, a little gravy is added, the toast placed on a dessert-plate, and served thus.. Broiled and roasted as above is the same thing. Oysters scalloped on their own shell, and placed on the range instead of in the oven, are also called broiled. Scalloped,—^Place the oysters when thoroughly washed on a hot stove, and as soon as they open remove one shell, the flatter one of the tw^o, and take them from the fire. Sprinlile salt, pepper, chopped parsley, and bread-crumbs on them; place on each a piece of butter the size of a hazel-nut; put in the oven about ten minutes, and when done add a few drops of meat-gravy, to each, and serve hot. Another,—Put a quart of oysters and their liquor in a, saucepan, set it on the fire, take off at the first boil, and drain. Set a saucepan on the fire with two ounces of but- ter in it; as soon as melted, add a teaspoonful of flour, stir, and, when turning rather brown, add the juice of the oystersj about a gill of gravy, salt, and pepper; boil gen- tly for ab*out ten minutes, stirring now and then. While it is boiling, place the oysters on scallop-shells, or on silver shells made for that purpose, two or three oysters on each, turn some of the above sauce on each, after it has boiled; dust w^ith bread-crumbs, put a little piece of butter on each shell, and bake for about twelve minutes in a warm oven„ A dozen silver shells served thus make a sightly and excellent dish.

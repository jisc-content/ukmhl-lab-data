BEEF. badly-invented machine or contrivance, is not to broil it, but to spoil it. To make tender.—^When cut, trimmed, salted, and peppered, put tbem in a bowl, and sprinkle some sweet- oil or melted butter over tliem; turn tbem over in the bowl every two or three hours for from six to twelve hours.

Do not cut off the fat, but flatten a little eacb slice with a chopper.

Cooks and epicures differ about the turning over of steaks; also about broiling them with or without salt; some say that they must not be turned over twice, others are of opinion that they must be turned over two or three, and even more times; some say that they must be salted and peppered before broiling, others say they must not; wx have tried the two ways many times, and did not find any difference ; if there is any diflerence at all, it is in the quality of the meat, or in the person's taste, or in the cook's care. When the steak is served as above, place some fried potatoes all around, and serve hot. ((Instead of fried pota- toes, put some water-cress all around, add a few drops

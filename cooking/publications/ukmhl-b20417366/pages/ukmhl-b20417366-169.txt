BEEF. 163 A LA MODE. Take from six to twelve pounds of rump and lard it. To lard it you take a steel needle made for that purpose, flat near the pointed end and much larger than an ordinary larding-needie. It must be flat near the point in order to cut the meat go as to make room for the larger part of the needle to pass, and also for the salt pork. This needle is only used for beef a la mode. Cut the salt pork in square strips to fit the needle, {see Larding), and proceed. Examine the piece of beef, lard with the grain of the ^meat, so that when it is carved the salt pork shall be cut across. If the piece is too thick to run the strip of pork through, so that both ends stick out^ lard one side first then the other. We mean by one side first, this: to be easily handled, the salt pork cannot be cut longer than about four inches ; as half an inch of it must stick out of the meat, it leaves only three inches inside, and if the piece of meat be six inches or more thick, of course it would be impossible to have the strip of pork stick out on both sides; therefore, you lard one side first; that is, you run the needle through the meat, leaving the salt pork stick out on the side you commence, and when that side is larded, do the same for the other. You have then the salt pork sticking out on both sides of the meat and look- ing just as if the strips were running through the whole piece. Some like more salt pork than others in the beef; the strips may be run thickly or thinly. Thirty strips may be run into three pounds of meat as well as half a dozen; but about half a pound of salt pork to five pounds of beef is a pretty good proportion.

BEEF. 168 FILLET. The tenderloin and even the sirloin are sometimes called, or rather known, under tlie name of fillet, when cooked. It comes from the French filet—tenderloin. Sirloin means surloin; like stock and several others, sirloin is purely English. The surloin is the upper part of the loin, as its prefix indicates; it is surlonge in French. A fillet is generally larded with salt pork by means of a small brass larding-needle; the salt pork cut in strips to fit the needle {see Lardinq). If you use a tenderloin, trim off the fat. If it is a piece of ribs, prepared fillet-like, shape it like a fillet as near as possible; the rest is used as directed above. A piece of ribs is certainly cheaper, and can be had at any time, while the other is as difficult to procure as it is dear. To lard it.—Have a towel in your left hand and place the meat over it, the most flat and smooth side up, holding it so that the upper part will present a somewhat convex surface, and commence larding at either end and finishing at the other, in this way: Run the needle through the upper part of the convex surfacej commencing at about a quarter of an inch from the edge of one side, running through the meat a distance of about one inch and a hall* about half an inch in depth at the middle, and the strip of salt pork sticking out at both ends; that is, where the needle was introduced into the meat, and where it came out of it. Repeat this till you have a rov/ of strips across the meat, the strips being about one-third of an inch apart. Lard row after row in the same way, and till the whole fiat side is covered ; the ends of the strips of pork sticking out of each row being intermingled.

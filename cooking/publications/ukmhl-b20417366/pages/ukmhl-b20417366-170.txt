BEEF. 164 Then take a saucepan of a proper size for the piece of meat; it must not be too large or too small, but large enough to hold the meat without being obliged to bend or fold it; a crockery pan is certainly the best for that purpose, and one that will go easily in the oven. Put in the saucepan, for six pounds of beef, half a calf's foot, or a veal-bone if more handy, two ounces of butter, half a handful of parsley (cives, if handy), two bay-leaves, a clove of garlic, a sprig of thyme, two onions, with a clove stuck in each, salt, pepper, half a carrot cut in slices, the rind of the salt pork you have used, and what you may have left of strips; the whole well spread on the ^ bottom o^ the pan, then the piece of meat over, cover the pan, set on a rather sharp lire and after about ten minutes add half a gill of water; keep the pan covered to the end. After another ten or fifteen minutes, add about one pint of cold water, turn the meat over, and after about ten minutes more, place the pan in the oven, a rather slow oven (a little above 220 degrees Fahr.), for five or six hours. Dish the meat, skim off the fat on the top of the gravy, give one boil and turn it over the meat and carrots through a strainer. When the meat is dished, put some carrots au jus all around; serve warm. Cold.â€”Serve it whole or in slices, with meat jelly, or with a sharp sauce ; such as piquante^ rav 'tgote^ etc. STEWED. Stewed beef is called also dauhe or braised beef, but it is the same. It may be larded as beef a la mode^ or not; it may be put whole in the pan or in large dice, according to taste.

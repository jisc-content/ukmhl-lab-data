MUTTOK. 192 The saine, in another way.—Chop fine the slices of leg of mutton, put a piece of butter in a stewpan, and set it on the fire; when melted, place tlie dropped meat in, keep stirring with a wooden spoon for about ten minutes; then add two or three tablespoonfuls of broth, salt, pepper, and a pincli of allspice; simmer fifteen minutes, and serve with fried eggs all around the dish. Boiled,—Set a saucepan on the fire with cold water enough to cover the leg of mutton, add salt; at the first boil put the leg of mutton in, w^rapped up in a towel. Boil gently till done. For a middling-sized one, it takes about two hours. Remove the towel, dish the leg of mut- ton, spread a caper-sauce over it, and serve bot. The sauce may also be served in a boat or saucer.

This is easily done by scraping the meat off the bone on botb sides, and then pulling it off. Do the same with the remain- ing bone.

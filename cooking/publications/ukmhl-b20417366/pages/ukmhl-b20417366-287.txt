281 GAME. In Civet,—When the hare is cleaned as directed for game, cut in pieces. Have in a saucepan and on a good fire two ounces of butter and one of salt pork cut in dice. Stir, and when the salt pork is fried take it off the pan, and put the pieces of hare in it; stir with a wooden spoon now and then, till of a fine golden color; then sprin- kle on it a teaspoonful of flour, add ten small onions, four spriijs of parsley, two of thyme, two cloves of garlic, a bay- leaf, salt, pepper, about a pint of claret wine, same of broth, three or four mushrooms, and a little grated nut- meg ; boil gently till done ; dish the pieccG of hare; throw away parslej^, thyme, bay-leaf, and garlic; mix the blood of the hare, if any, in the sauce, boil it about ten minutes longer, turn it on the hare, and serve warm. Many epicures like a civet better when prepared one or two days in advance, and only warmed before serving. When the civet is done, and ready to serve, place the dish in a cool, dry place, and when you want to eat the civet, place the dish in a hain-marie^ or in an oven, and seiTe when warm. The same, roasted,—Lard the hare w^eli; place it on the spit before a good fire ; baste often with the drippings, and when properly cooked serve it with the following sauce : put in a stewpan a piece of butter the size of a wal- nut, and set it on a good fire; when melted, put in it the hare's liver w^ell pounded, then the blood, if any, also the dnppings, salt, pepper, a tablespoonful of white wine, same of broth, and one teaspoonful of vinegar; when of a proper thickness, serve with the hare. It takes about an hour to roast it well. In a small family, the hind part is roasted, and the fore part of the hare is dressed in civet. Baked,—Lard it with salt pork and bake it, basting often; serve in the same way as a roasted one.

SAUSAGE-MEAT, Butchers generally, with an eye to economy, make sausage-meat of bad or tainted pork. We recommend our readers, as far as possible, never to buy sausage-meat ready made, but to make it them- selves, or have it made according to their directions. A chopping-machine costs very little, and saves a great deal of work, besides chopping much better than can be done by hand. The proportions are : one pound of lean pork and one pound of lean veal, chopped very fine, well mixed, and both very fresh. Season with salt, pepper, nutmeg and clove grated, and with cinnamon, if liked. A yolk of egg may be added to a pound of meat. It may also be made with one pound of veal and half a pound or less of pork, or with veal only or pork only, according to taste. ^3*

51 DIVEKS KECEIPTS. Four teaspoontuls make a quart of very good coffee for breakfast. It would be rather strong for cbildren, but can be diluted to a proper state with milk. No matter what quantity of coffee is put in the filter, the liquor must be clear; the more is used, the blacker the substance is, but it must never be muddy. If muddy at all, be sure you have not used good coffee. One pound of good coffee to a quart of water, should make black but clear coffee. CAFE AU LAIT. This IS coffee and milk for breakfast. The milk is set on the firkin a tin saucepan, and taken off when it rises; then mixed with the coffee, either in the cup or any kind of vessel. The proportions are pint for pint. C AFE NOIR. Cafe noir is the name given to the coffee taken after dinner. It is generally made rather strong. Gentlemen sometimes put liquor in itâ€”a glass of brandy, or rum, or kirschwasser; and ladies, a little cold milk. Taken fifteen or twenty minutes after dinner, it helps digestion. It excites the faculties of the mind, and gives what physiologists call " agreeable sensations." Coffee is nutritious, and to a certain extent prevents waste of the system. CHOCOLATE. The quantity of chocolate for a certain quantity of milk is according to taste. Two ounces of chocolate make a good cup of it, and rather thick. Break the chocolate in pieces, put it in a tin saucepan with a tablespoonful of water to an ounce of chocolate, and set it on a rather slow fire. Stir now and then till thoroughly melted.

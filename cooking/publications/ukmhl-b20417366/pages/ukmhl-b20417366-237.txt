Besides the sauce, some green vegetables, boiled only, are served on separate dishes, but eaten with the ham. It is also served like game, with currant-jelly, apple- sauce, etc. Champagne Sauce,-—Proceed as for the above in every particular, except that you use Champagne instead of Ma- deira wine, and when done serve it with a Champagne sauce. Another.—It may be boiled as directed above, and served with a Champagne sauce also. Another,—^When soaked and dry, put it in a crockery vessel; put on and all around it four onions chopped fine, two bay-leaves, two sprigs of thyme, a piece of nutmeg, and pour on the whole a bottle of white wine; cover the vessel as nearly air-tight as possible, leave it thus for about twenty-four hours, turning it over two or three times, so as to let every side take the seasonings. Place the ham on the spit before a good fire, baste often with the seasonings from the crockery vessel, and when done take it off, dust it with fine raspings of bread, place it fifteen minutes in a slow oven, strain the drippings, boil them till reduced to a proper thickness, dish the ham, pour the drippings on it, and serve.

The best and only proper way to cook salted pork, is, to put it in a kettle, entirely cover it with cold water, boil gently till cooked, and serve it with a puree or with a gar- niture of cabbage. Any thing else that you might put with it would rather spoil than better it.

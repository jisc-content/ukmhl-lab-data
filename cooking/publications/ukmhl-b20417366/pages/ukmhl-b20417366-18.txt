If the object is desired brown, leave the pan on a brisk fire while it is frying; if otherwise, remove it to a slow or less ])risk fire. Fat is not like water, which, no matter how fast you boil it, you cannot augment the degree of heat, while you. can that of fat. If water, by boiling it fastj could be heated as much as fat, it would be used to fry in its stead, being cheaper.

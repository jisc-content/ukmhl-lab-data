PASTRY. 417 pan, on their sides, far apart, and bake in a very quick oven. When done, dust with sugar, and serve, Vol-au-vent and hoachees for the day's use are baked early in the morning. They are warmed in a slow oven just before filling them. Vol-au-vent.-â€”K vol-au-vent is made with pufF-paste and filled with oysters, meat, etc., when baked; that is, when the cake is baked and emptied, it is warmed in the oven, filled, and served warm. It is made of an oval or round shape. When made small it is generally of a round sliape, but when made rather large it is generally of an oval shape. When the puff-paste is ready to be used, roll down to any thickness from one-quarter to three- quarters of an incli; cut it v/itb a sharp-pointed knife of the size and shape you wish, then with the same knife cut what is called tbe cover, ^, e., make a cut all around, about half an inch from the edge or border, and about one-third through the paste, leaving two-thirds of the thickness of the paste uncut. This operation is called marking out the cover. Glaze the top of the paste with egg, and bake it in a very quick oven, about 500 deg. Fahr. In glazing, be careful not to glaze the sides or allow any egg to run on the sides; it would prevent tbe paste from rising. Some drawings may be made on the cover with the back of a knife, according to fancy: leaves, for instance, are very easily imitated; it is only necessary to run the knife on the paste, without cutting it. When in the oven, do not look at it for at least seven or eight minutes, for in opening the door of the oven it might cause the paste to fall, and even after that time open and shut the door quickly; take off when properly baked. Wlien the oven is hot enough it takes about twelve min- utes, and even less time wdien the vol-au-vent is small. 18*

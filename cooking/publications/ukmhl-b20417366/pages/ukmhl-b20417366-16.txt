10 professional cooks boil things that ought to be prepared otherwise, with a view to economy; but a great many do it through laziness. . Boiling requires as much care as any other branch, but they do not think so, and there- fore indulge in it. Another abuse is to boil fost instead of slowly. Set a small ocean of water on a brisk fire and boil something in it as fast as you can, you make much steam but do not cook faster; the degree of heat being the same as if you were boiling slowly. If the object you boil, and especially boil fast, con- tains any flavor, you evaporate it, and cannot bring it back. Many things are spoiled or partly destroyed by boil- ing, such, as meat, coffee, etc. Water that has been boiled is inferior for cooking pur- poses, its gases and alkali being evaporated. JBroilinr/.â€”Whateyev you broil, grease the bars of the gridiron first. Broiling and roasting is the same thing; the object in process of cooking by either must be exposed to the heat on one side, and the other side to the air. Bear in mind that no one can broil or roast in an oven, whatever be its construction, its process of heating, or its kind of heat. An object cooked in an oven is baked. It is better to broil before than over the fire. In broil- ing before the fire, all the juice can be saved. In broiling by gas, there is a great advantage. The meat is placed under the heat, and as the heat draws the juice of the meat, the consequence is, that the juice being attracted upward, it is retained in the meat. A gas broiler is a square, flat drum, perforated on one side and placed over a frame.

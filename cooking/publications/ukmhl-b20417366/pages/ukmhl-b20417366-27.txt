Sugar, etc., may also be sprinkled over dishes with a dredger, DRINKING. When weary, or cold, or warm, or exhausted, we drink in preference to eating, because we feel the effect instantaneously; while after eating even the most sub- stantial food, we do not feel the effect for some time. When exhausted and when immediate relief is neces- sary, the best drinks are broth, chocolate, milk, or water sweetened with sugar. It is more than a mistake to drink wines or liquors at such a time; it is really commit- ting slow suicide. When only thirsty, without exhaustion, we ought to drink cold water with a teaspoon. When thirsty and heated, the first thing to do is to dip the bands in cold water deep enough just to cover the wrists; then dip a towel in the water, lay it on the forehead, and then drink cold water with a teaspoon. A few drops of vinegar or lemon-juice may be added to the water. If exceedingly hot, keep your hands in cold water and the towel on your forehead at least one minute before drinking. HOT WEATHER. A remark or two on eating and drinking in hot weather are always in season. Green vegetables, properly cooked, are certainly healthful in warm weather; but it is a mis- take to think that meat should be excluded from sum- mer diet. The hotter the weather, the more the system wastes, and therefore the more we must supply.

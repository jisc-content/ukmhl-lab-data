VEAL. 211 Fricandeau.—lLskQ a piece of veal of any size, from the leg, loin, or cutlet piece, about three-quarters of an inch in thickness, krd one side with salt porlc, the same as a fillet of beef. Put in a saucepan (for two pounds of meat) one ounce of butter, half a middling-sized onion, and as much carrot in slices, two or three stalks of parsley, one of thyme, a bay-leaf, six or eight pepper-corns, and rind of the pork you have used ; spread all these season- ings on the bottom of the saucepan, put the piece of veal on them, the larded side up, set on a good fire for about fifteen minutesafter which you look if the under side of the meat is well browned; if so, add a gill of broth, put in the oven and baste often, if not, leave a little longer on the fire. Add a little broth once in a while, to keep the bottom of the pan wet, and to have enough to baste till a little overdone, and serve with the gravy strained all over it. It is then called au jus. With Spinach,—-Propare and cook the fricandeau as above; and when done, put some broth in the pan after having taken oft' tlie meat; give one boil; turn in the spin- ach au jus ; stir on the fire one minute; dish the spinach ; place fricandeau on it, and serve. With SorreL'—Troceed as with spinach in every par- ticular, except that you serve on sorrel au jus instead of spinacli. It makes a more delicate dish with sorrel, al- though excellent with spinach. It may also be served with green peas au jus or a Vanglaise. Finmiciere,—When prepared, cooked, and dished as directed, surround it with a fina.nciere garniture, and serve w^arm. Jardiniere.'—MiQV being cooked and dished, put a Macedoine garniture around it, and serve warm.

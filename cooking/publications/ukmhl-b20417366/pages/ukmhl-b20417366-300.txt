Sportsman-like,—Clean and prepare the rabbit, then cut off the neck, head, and the end of the legs, which you keep to make a potage au chasseur.

Then bake or roast it, and serve with the gravy and water-cress. Stewed,—^When cleaned and prepared, cut the rabbit in pieces. Put in a saucepan three ounces of butter and set it on the fire ; as soon as melted, put the pieces of rabbit in, stir now and then till they are turning rather brown, then take them from the pan but keep it on the fire. Put in it a rather small carrot and two or three onions, both sliced, a few slices of turnip, half a dozen sprigs of parsley, two of celery, one of thyme, the last three tied together with twine, and two or three cloves, also half a pint of Madeira or Sherry wine, salt, and pep- per; cover the whole with broth or water; boil gently till half done, when add the rabbit, and continue boiling till the whole is done, stirring once in a while. Dish the rabbit, mash the onions, carrot, and turnip, through a col- ander, which you put all around the pieces of rabbit, strain the sauce over the whole, and serve warm.

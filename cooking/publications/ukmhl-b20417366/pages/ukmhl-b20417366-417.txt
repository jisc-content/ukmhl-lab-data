PASTKY. 411 little of it, dredge both ends of the piece of butter with flour also, then by putting one end on the board and press- ing on the other end with your hands, you will flatten it of a rather round shape, and till of about half an inch in thickness. Put it thus on the corner of the board also. Immediately after having prepared the butter, take the dough and roll it down, of a round form also, and till large enough to envelop the butter in it easily. Ee- mcmber that during the whole operation of folding and rolling the paste down, you must dust the marble or paste- board with flour, very slightly and often; do the same on the top of the paste. It is done in order to prevent the paste from adhering to the board or to the rolling-pin. It must be dusted slightly, so that the paste cannot absorb much of it, as it would make it tough. Have a slab of marble or slate ; it is much easier than wood, and cooler. When the dough is spread, place the butter right on the middle of it. Turn one side of the dough over the butter, covering it a little more than half way; do the same vath the opposite side, the dough lapping over that of the first side turned; do the same with the side toward you, and also with the side opposite. Dough stretching easily when pulled, and contracting easily when let loose after having pulled it, you have now still four corners of the dough to bring over the butter and in the same way as above, and by doing which, you give to the whole a some- what round form, and also have the butter perfectly enveloped in the dough. Place the roliing-pin on the mid- dle of the paste, horizontally, and press gently on it so as to make a farrow; do the same from place to place, on the whole surface, making furrows about an inch apart. Ke- peat the process again, this time placing the rolling-pin right on the top of each elevated line; and again, repeat

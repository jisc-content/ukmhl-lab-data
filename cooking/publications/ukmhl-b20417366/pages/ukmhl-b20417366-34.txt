DIKECTIONSj EXPLANA'J lONSj ETC. 28 cleaned; sometliing will always remaiu between the lining and the iron, and spoil every thing cooked in them. The tin-lined are preferable, on account of being easily cleaned by means of a small birch-broom, washing-soda, and boiling water. LAIT DE POULE. Mix well in a tmnbler a yolk of egg and a teaspoon- ful of sugar; then add a few drops of orange-flower water {eau de fieur d'omnger); pour boiling water on the whole, little by little, stirring the while, and drink warm. The quantity of water is according to taste. A gill of water to a yolk of egg makes it thick enough. It makes an excellent drink, to be taken just before re- tiring, for persons with cough. LARD. Never buy lard ready made if you can help it, but take hog's fat, the part enveloping the kidneys, or leaf lard, and chop it fine, put it in a cast-iron or crock- ery kettle with a bay-leaf and a stalk of thyme to every two pounds of fat; set on a moderate fire, and as soon as it begins to melt, take the melted part out with a ladle, and put it in a stone jar or pot; be careful not to take any pieces of fat not yet melted. Contmue that process till it is all melted. The dry or hard part that remains at the bottom of the kettle when done is no good. Lard made thus is as white as snow, and may be kept a long time. When there is water in lard, it flies all over the fire ; in that case, boil it a few minutes with a cover on the panÂ» and then use.

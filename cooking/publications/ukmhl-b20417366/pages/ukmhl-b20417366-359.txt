When the fruit or vegetable is clean, and cut in pieces, if necessary, such as cabbage, have water on the fire, and drop it in at the first boil. If the fruit or vegetable is desired white, add to the water lemon or un- ripe grape juice. It is necessary to be very careful in blanching, for, if too much blanched or cooked, it will be soft and tasteless; if not enough, it will ferment. As a general rule, it is cooked as soon as it floats, but it can be ascertained by running a skewer or a small knife through it. By putting some fresh spinach-leaves or fresh grape- s'ine-leaves on the top of the fruit or vegetable, it will keep it more green than without. When blanched, take from the fire and drain. Drop it immediately in cold water, and drain again. When dry, put the fruit or vegetable in jars, cover it with boiling vinegar; season with pep- pers, pepper-corns, cloves, and tarragon, also some rock- salt. When perfectly cold, seal the jars air-tight, and keep in a dark, cool, and dry closet. Every kind of fruit or vegetables can be pickled in the same way; the only dif- ference is in the time of blanching or cooking, which is ac- cording to the nature of the fruit: apples, string-beans, beets, cabbages, cauliflowers, cherries,- cucumbers, lemons, melons, mushrooms, onions, peaches, pears, plums, pv/mp- hins, quinces, radishes, walnuts, etc., may also be preserved in salt and w^ater, and in the following way : When cooked

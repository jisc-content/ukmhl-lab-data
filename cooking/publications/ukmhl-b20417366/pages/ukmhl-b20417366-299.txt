293 it in the following way: Put tLe rabbit on the paste-board so that it appears as if it were resting, lying on its belly. Skewer the ears so that they seem to be naturally" bent on the back of the neck. With a trussing-needle fasten the forelegs so that they look also as if naturally bent by the animal when at rest. Roast or bake it, and serve it with the gravy and currant or raspberry jelly. It is placed on the dish lying on its belly, the skewers and twine are removed, and a few sprigs of parsley are placed in its mouth. The currant-jelly may be served in a saucer and the gravy in another. In Gihelotte.—The only difference between a gihelotU and a civet is that the latter is made with claret wine and the former with Sauterne or Catawba. Other white wine may be used, but the two kinds above mentioned are the best. Marengo,~WhQTL cleaned and prepared as directed, cut the rabbit in pieces; keep the head, neck, and trim- mings, to make a potage au chasseur^ and cook and serve the rest as a chicken a la Marengo. In Papillotes.—The four legs and two pieces cut on both sides of the backbone may be prepared, cooked, and served as veal cutlets in papillotes. The rest is used to make a potage au chasseur. With Olives,—When baked or roasted, serve it as a duck with olives, putting three dozen olives instead of two. Coasted.—It may be roasted with only a little buttei spread all over it, or enveloped in buttered paper; or larded with salt pork; or larded and enveloped in buttered paper. It must be basted often, and if enveloped with paper, the paper must be removed about fifteen minutes before tak- ing the rabbit from the fire. Ascertain when done by means of a skewer or a small sharp-pointed knife. It

Ten minutes before taking from the fire, add and mix with the whole two or three trufiies, weighing at least six ounces, and sliced; finish the cooking, and serve. To serve.—Dish the pieces tastefully and according to fancy, and put the dish away in a warm place, then mix a supreme sauce with what you have left in the pan, sauce, truffles, etc., boil the whole till rather thick, stirring con- tinually while it is boihng, turn over the pieces of chicken, and serve.

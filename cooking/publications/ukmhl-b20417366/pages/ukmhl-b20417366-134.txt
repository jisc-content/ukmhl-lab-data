FISH. 128 Baked.—Clean and prepare tlie fish, as directed for baking; put it in a baking-pan with salt, pepper, and but- ter spread all over it; just cover the bottom of the pan with water or broth ; place a piece of buttered paper over it and bake. Baste two or three times; take oft" when done, and serve warm with a sauce. While the fish is baking you prepare the sauce, put it in a boat, and serve warm with the fivsh. A baked fish may be served with its gravy only, add- ing a few drops of lemon-juice or vinegar, or with any kind of sauce, according to taste. Balls,—Fish-balls are often called fish-cakes or fish- croquettes. They are generally made wdth cold fish, but it may be cooked especially to make balls. Fish, full of bones, like shad, is not fit to make balls; cod is the easiest. Commence by chopping the flesh very fine, then chop fine also a small piece of onion and fry it with butter (half a middling-sized onion with two ounces of butter are enough for half a pound of fish) ; when'fried stir in it a tablespoonful of flour, and about half a minute after turn the fish in with about a gill of broth or water, salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg;'stir till it turns rather thick, which will take two or three minutes; take from the fire, mix two yolks of eggs with it; put back on the fire for about one minute, stimng the while; then add two or three mush- rooms or one trufQe, or both, chopped fine. Turn the mixture into a dish, spread it, and put it away to cool for two or three hours, or over night. Before cooking, mix the whole well, the upper part being more dry than that which is under; put it in parts on the paste-board, roll each part to the shape you wish, either round, oval, or flat; the paste-board may be dusted

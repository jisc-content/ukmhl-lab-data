Fried,—Put half a pound of lard in a frying-pan, and on a good fire; when hot, break gently, one by one (be- ing careful not to break the yolk), the quantity of eggs you can put in the pan without allowing them to adhere together; turn them upside down once with a spoon or skimmer; take from the pan with a skimmer as soon as the white part becomes hard, and serve with fried parsley around. Scrambled^ or Mashed,—Beat six eggs just enough to mix the whites and yolks together ; put two ounces of butter in a stewpan, and set on the fire; when melted, take from the fire, add salt, pepper, and a pinch of grated nutmeg, then the eggs, also a tablespoonful of broth ; put back on a very slow fire, stir continually till cooked, and serve warm.

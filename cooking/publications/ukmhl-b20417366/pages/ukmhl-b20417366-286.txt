GAME. 280 on the same skewer, as seen in the cut (p. 278) ; but when a little larger, like the robin or plover, they may be trussed as directed for snipes. Grouse or HeathcocJc,—These are good as long as the legs are flexibte ; if not, examine them carefully, they might be rotten inside. Lard them well, envelop each in buttered paper, and place on the spit before a good fire ; baste often, remove the paper after twenty or twenty-five minutes: leave two or three minutes more, basting coi^jtinuaily with the drip- pings ; dish the birds; mix with the drippings a few drops of lemon-juice, and a little salt and pepper, and serve with the birds. Baked.-—Lard the bird as for roasting; that is, the fleshy parts only are larded with salt pork, then truss them as directed for chicken, place them in a baking-pan, cover the bottom of the pan with cold water, put a piece of but- tered paper on each bird, place in a hot oven, haste often till done. Serve with the gravy some water-cress, and lemon juice, or vinegar. It is also prepared, cooked, and served in the different ways described for prairie-hen, either in chartreuse^ salmis, salad, or any other way. Hare.—No hares have yet been found in the United States, except in California. The reported hare of the West- ern prairies is, as far as known, a species of rabbit. That found in the Eastern markets comes from Canada and Eu- rope. Tbe Canadian hare is very inferior in quality. To select—When young it has rather soft paws, and not much opened, and also soft ears; but if old, the paws are hard and much worn, and the ears stiff and hard. If fresh, the body is stiff; it is soft, and the flesh is nearly black, if tainted. Save the blood as much as possible ; it improves the sauce very much.

Glazed.—Peel a dozen of middhng-sized onions and put them in a saucepan with four ounces of butter, and set them on a slow lire; stir occasionally till they are about three-quarters done, when add about two ounces of pow- dered sugar, stir now and then and finish the cooking.

Onions prepared that way are excellent, and generally used to decorate meat. Stewed,—Clean a quart of small onions, throw them in boiling water, add two sprigs of parsley, one of thyme,' a clove, a bay-leaf, a little piece of nutmeg, a clove of gar- lic, salty and pepper; boil twenty minutes, drain the onion? only, and throw away the seasonings. Put two ounces of butter in a stewpan on a good fire, and when melted sprinkle in it a teaspoonful of flour; then add the onions, cover with half broth and half white wine, boil gently till well cooked and the sauce reduced, serve warm. It is a very wholesome dish.

FISH. The following sauce is also served at the same time : Chop fine and fry till half done, with a little butter, two small green onions or four shallots. Put half a pint of good meat-gravy ia a small saucepan; set on the fire, and as soon as it commences to boil, pour into it, little by little, stirring the-while with a wooden spoon, about a gill of Bordeaux wine, then the onions or shallots, and also a piece of beef marrow chopped fine; give one boil, and serve in a saucer. In Salad,—Proceed as for salmon in salad. When boiled^ serve the turbot with anchovy-butter, lobster-butter, lobster-sauce, or muscle-sauce. Cold,—Any cold piece of turbot is served with a Mayonnaise sauce, or in vinaigrette. Cold Fish,—If the fish is with sauce, that is, if the sauce is in the same dish with the fisb, warm it in the bain-marie, and serve w^arm. Any other piece of cold fish, baked, boiled, broiled, or roasted, is served with a Mayon- naise sauce, or with a vinaigrette. Any kind of cold fish may be prepared in salad. Slice the fish or cut it in pieces and put it in the salad- dish, with hard-boiled egg sliced, onion and parsley chopped fine, salt, pepper, vinegar, and oil. Mix the whole gently and well, and serve. Anchovy,—It is imported preserved. It is used as a hors-d^oeuvre, to decorate or season. The essence of anchovy is used for sauce. The smallest are considered the best. To serve as a hors d^oeuvre, wash, wipe dry, and re- move the backbone, serve with tarragon or parsley, chopped fine, vinegar, and oil. They may also be served with hard-boiled eggs, chopped or quartered.

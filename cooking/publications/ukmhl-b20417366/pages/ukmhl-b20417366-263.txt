TURKEY. Tame and wild are prepared and served alike. The legs of a young hen-turkey are black; the cock has small spurs, and also black legs. The shorter the neck the better and fatter the bird. An old hen has red and rough legs; the cock also has long spurs. The fetter they are the better ; they cannot be too fat. The broader the breast the better; the skin must be white. It is fresh enough as long as the legs are not stiff. iioz'M,—-Clean and prepare a turkey as directed for poultry.

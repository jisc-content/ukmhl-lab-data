393 SWEET DISHES. cream: from four to six eggs; from eight to fourteen ounces of pulverized sugar; essence, or chocolate, or fruit- jelly to flavor and color. Our receipt is for six eggs and fourteen ounces of sugar to a quart of milk. Set tlie milk on the fire, and when it comes to a boil, mix well half the sugar and the essence with six yolks and three whites of eggs ; beat the three other whites sep- arately to a stiff froth, xis soon as the milk rises, take it from the fire, pul half the sugar in it and stir to melt it, then turn the mixture into it also, little by little, beating the while with an egg-beater; set on the fire, and take off at the first boilings While on the fire it must be beaten "gently, as, if it is allowed to boil, the eggs may curdle. As soon as off the fire, mix the three whites with the rest, beating with an egg-beater, just enough to mix the whole well; put in cold, salt water to cool, and then freeze. The smaller the ice is broken and mixed with plenty of rock-salt, the quicker it freezes. Custard.—Put four yolks of eggs in a bowl, then sprinkle flour on them, little by little, stirring anH mix- ing w^ell the while with a wooden spoon, and when the mixture is rather thick, stop sprinkling flour, but sprinkle milk, and mix again in the same way till the mixture is liquid; add sagar and essence to taste, beat the four bites to a stiff froth, mix them gently with the rest; butter a mould well, fill it about two-thirds full with the mixture, and set in a warm but not quick oven. Serve as soon as out of the oven. If intended to be served cold, omit the whites of eggs.

BAKED. Place the meat in a bake-pan, with cold water about a quarter of an inch deep; spread salt, pepper, and a little butter on the meat, cover it with a piece of buttered paper; baste often over the paper, lest it should burn; keep the bottom of the pan covered with juice: if the water and juice are absorbed, add a little cold water and continue basting; turn over two or three times, but keep the paper on the top ; if it is burnt, put on another piece. The paper keeps the top of the meat moist, and prevents it from burning or drying. When done, it is served like roasted beef.

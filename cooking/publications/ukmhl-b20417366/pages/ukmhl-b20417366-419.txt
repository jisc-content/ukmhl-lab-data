Beef-suet being more firm than butter, puff-paste can be made with it during sum- mer, but it must be eaten immediately, being very inferior after a while. The proportion of butter and flour may be varied. Weight for weight makes the real puff-paste, and very rich. If less butter is used it will not rise as much, but is excellent nevertheless, and is more handy to make different cakes, such as short-cakes with fruit. Therefore puff-paste may be made with the following proportions: to one pound of flour, use fourteen, twelve, ten, eight, or even four ounces of butter or suet. Another way is to mix one or two eggs in the flour, w^ater, and salt before rolling it down. When eggs are used, it requires less water. Envelop the butter in it in the same way. Allumettes.-—Cut strips of puff-paste of any length, about three inches wide and about one-fifth of an inch in thickness; mix well together, and for about three or four minutes, one ounce of sugar and about half the white of an egg; spread this mixture over the strips of paste, so as to have a rather thin coat of it; then cut the paste across, so as to make small strips about one inch broad and three inches long. Bake in an oven at about 400 deg. Fahr. ^ Feuillettes.—Eoll puff-paste down to a thickness of from one-eighth to one-half of an inch in thickness; cut

Pound the whole well together, then add a tablespoonful of essence of spinach, mix well, mash thrqugh a sieve, and use. This butter is excellent to decorate and to eat with cold fish. It is sometimes used with cold birds. Razel-nut Butter,—Pound some hazel-nuts or filberts and then mix throughly with good butter, mash through a sieve, and use as ordinary butter. The proportion ac- cording to taste. It is easily prepared, and is delicious. Do the same with pea-mits, or any other nut. Melted Butter,—Put butter in a crockery vessel and place it above a pan of water or some other liquid, heated but not boiling, so that the butter will melt slowly and gradually. Sometimes the butter may be wanted soft only, or what is called melted soft, or thoroughly melted. It is easy to obtain those different states above with heated liquor, and the butter, though melted, is more firm than when melted on the fire. Scented Butter,—Whenever a certain flavor is desired with butter, put a piece of firm and good butter in a bowl with a few drops of essence, knead well, and then mash through a sieve. PUREES. Purees are made with vegetables, but when the flesh of poultry or other birds is mashed through a sieve after being cooked, it is sometimes called puree also.

150 FISH. Use every thing but tlie stomach and the black or blaish vein running along its back and tail. Boil your lobsters yourself; because, it" you buy them already boiled, you do not kuow if they were alive when put in the kettle. A lobster boiled after being dead is watery, soft, and not full; besides being very unhealthy, if not dangerous. A lobster suffers less by being put in cold than in boil- ing water, and the flesh is firmer when done. In putting it in boiling water it is killed by the heat; in cold water it is dead as soon as the w^ater gets warm. To boil—Lay it in a fish-kettle; just cover it with cold water, cover the kettle, and set it on a sharp fire.

When boiled, take it from the kettle, break it in two, that is, separate the body from the tail, and place it in a colander to let the water drain. In the shell,—When the lobster is boiled, divide it in two, taking care not to break the body and large claws. The tail is then split in two, lengthwise, the flesh taken off, cut in small dice, and mixed with the inside of the lobster. The vein found immediately under the shell, all along the flesh of the lobster, is removed as soon as it is split. The stomach, found near the head, is removed also and thrown away; all the rest is good, including the liver. When the flesh and inside are properly mixed, season with salt, pepper, vinegar, oil, mustard, and chopped pars- ley. Place the body of the lobster on the middle of a dish, the head up, the two large claws stretched out, and the two feelers stretched out also and fastened between the

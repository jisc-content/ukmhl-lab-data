120 FAECES AND GARNITURES. The bones of a ham, after the flesli is disposed of, is the most excellent thing you can put with the vegetables to boil them in order to make purees. One-third of the bones of a middling-sized ham is enough for about a quart of vegetables. When you have no bam bones, use four ounces of good salt pork, as lean as possible; but ne\^er use smoked pork, it gives a disagreeable taste to iho, puree. Of Dry Beam, white or colored^ Kidney, Lima^ or any other kind.—Dry beans must be soaked in cold water, or even in lukewarm water, when in a burry. According to the nature of the beans, they must be soaked for from six to twenty-four hours. Soak a quart of beans as directed above; drain and put them in a saucepan with one-third of the bones of a ham, or about four ounces of salt pork; cover with cold water, season with a bay-leaf, a sprig of thyme, two of parsley, two middling-sized onions, with two cloves stuck in tbem, and a carrot cut in pieces; when the whole is well cooked, throw away thyme, bay-leaf, onions, and cloves; mash well through a colander all the rest except the bacon. While mashing them through the colander, wet them with some of the water in which they have boiled, else it would be difficult and long. When mashed, put them in a saucepan with a little brotb or water, salt, and two ounces of butter; stir now and then till the butter is melted and thoroughly mixed with the rest, and it is ready for use. The quantity of broth or water is according to how thick or thin they are wanted. The salt pork is good to eat. Of Lentils.—It is made in the same way as that of beans, except that they do not require to be soaked more than five or six hours in cold water.

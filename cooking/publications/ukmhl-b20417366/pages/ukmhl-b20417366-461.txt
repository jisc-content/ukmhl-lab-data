455 PASTRY, and saves a great deal of time and labor. It is not diffi- cult to make good bread with good flour. There are sev- eral ways of making and of using yeast. Some are better than others; but many, though differently manipulated, bring about the same results. The only difficulty is the baking of it. Bakers can almost always bake bread prop- erly, having large brick ovens. If they do not bake their bread enough, which is generally the case, it is not because they cannot^ but because under-baked bread is heavier, and people, especially the poorer class, buy it in preference to the other; judging by the weight, they think they have more of it for a certain sum of money. Under-baked bread is difficult of digestion. [See Food.) The best bread is made with the best wheat-flour, all that can be said by anybody to the contrary notwithstand- ing. Eye, corn, and barley bread are excellent, and may be partaken of by those whose constitution, occupation, etc., allow it. In every thing, bread included, the people, or what maybe called "the million," are wiser than soi-di- sant philosophers; and if oat-meal or Indian-meal were better than wheat-flour, they would be dearer. To de- scribe or discuss the innumerable methods of making bread would require several volumes. We have perused carefully hundreds of them; they nearly all differ theo- retically, but practically, when practical (which is not always the case), they amount to about the same thing. We think that the only difficulty, if difficulty there be, is in the use of the yeast, the making of the same, and the baking. Chemical processes for rising will never equal the processes of nature and time. Many bakers do not use the 5^east properly, their bread being sour or musty; some sweeten their bread, to disguise an inferior quality of flour, or as^an antidote to sourness or mustiness.

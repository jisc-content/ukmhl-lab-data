The taste of the meat is much improved by that process. The oil may be used for bast- ing instead of butter. Baked,—Vxit the chine in a bakepan, sprinkle salt over it, cover the bottom of the pan with cold water, and put in a rather quick oven, baste often, and in case there should be much fat in the pan, take it off and add a little cold water. When overdone, serve with any of the following purees: beans, lentils, Lima beans, onions, peas, potatoes, sorrel, or spinach. It may also be served with the following sauces: fines herhes, piquante, poivrade, Provencale, ravigote^ remolade, llohert, tarragon^ Tartar^ and vinaigrette. It is served also with a tomato-sauce. Make more sauce for pork than for other dishes, and make the tomato- sauce rather thick by boiling it gently for some time; it tastes better so with pork. Always use mustard with pork, if you like it. Horse- radish, also, is good with it. CUTLETS. Flatten the cutlets with a chopper (they may be im- proved in the same way as the chine), place them on the gridiron and set on a sharp fire; turn over two or three times, and when properly done, serve them with apiquante, .Robert, or tomato-sauce, adding to them some slices of pickled cucumbers just before serving. The same, sautees,—Instead of broiling them, when prepared as above, place them in a frying-pan with a little butter, turn over two or three times during the cooking, and serve as the above, or on a puree of sorrel.

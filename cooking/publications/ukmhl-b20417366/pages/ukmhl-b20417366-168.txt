BEEF. HOW TO SELECT, See if tlie meat is fine, of a clear red color, with yel- iowisli-wliite fat. COW BEEF. Cow beef must also be of a clear red color, but more pale than other beef; the fat is white. BULL BEEF. Bull beef is never good ; you recoguize it when you see hard and yellow fat; tlie lean part is of a dirty-reddish color. The rump piece is generally prepared a la mode. For steaks, the tenderloin and the piece called the porter- house steak, are the best; rump steaks are seldom tender. The roasting or baking pieces are the tenderloin, the fillet, and some cuts of the ribs. For soup, every piece is good; to make rich broth, take pieces of the rump, sucket, round, etc., but every piece makes excellent broth, and therefore excellent soup. [See Broth,) A good piece of rib, prepared like a fillet or tender- loin, makes an excellent dish, the bones and meat around them being used to make broth.

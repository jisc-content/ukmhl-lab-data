GAME. 297 slices of lemon are always placed around the meat and on the border of the dish. The lemon or orange is first split in two lengthwise, then cut in eight, twelve, or six- teen shoes, always commencing to cut on the inside and finishing by the rind.

We cannot say that we have had much experience in cooking the above animals, but they are all eaten by many persons, in different parts of this and other countries. We have tasted of all of them except the raccoon, and we must say that we found them palatable. It is well known that when our soldiers retook possession of Ship Island, they found plenty of raccoons on it, and ate all they could catch. One day we happened to meet a sub-officer^ who was there at the time, and inquired of him about it. He said he had never eaten any raccoons be- fore, and did not know that they were eatable ; but now he could eat them as readily as rabbits, as they were quite as good. 13*

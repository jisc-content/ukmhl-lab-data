If the nerve were not cut, it would contract in cook- ing, and instead of being straight, the legs would point upward. A bird stuffed is trussed exactly in the same way as above, with the exception that the skin of the neck must be sewed up with a trussing-needle before commencing to truss the legs, and the incision must also be sewed up as soon as filled and before trussing. The twine used to sew and truss the bird is removed just before dishing it. Some experiments have been made lately, in France, to find out the best way to kill chickens and make them tender.

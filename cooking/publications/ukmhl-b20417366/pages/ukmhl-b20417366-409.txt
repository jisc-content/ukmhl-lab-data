Candied or Comfited Fruit,—The best state of the fruit to be candied is just when commencing to ripen or a little before. It must be picked in dry weather, and be sound ; the least stain is enough to spoil it soon after it is preserved. Peaches.—Make a cut on the side of the fruit and re- move the stone without bruising it; then skin it carefully and drop it in a pan of cold water. When they are ail in, set on the fire, boil gently till they float. There must be much more water than is necessary to cover them, in order to see easily when they come to the surface. Then take them off carefully, with a skimmer, and drop them in cold water and drain. When drained, put them in a pan, cover them with syrup of sugar after it is skimmed and clarified. [See Sybup of Sugar.) The syrup must beboihngwhen turned over the fruit. Set on the fire, give one boil only, and turn the whole into a bowl, which you cover with paper, and leave thus twelve or fifteen hours. After that time, drain, put the syrup on the fire, the peaches in the bowl, and at the first boiling of the syrup, turn it over the fruit, cover the bowl with paper, and leave about as long, that is, twelve or fifteen hours. Repeat the same process three times more, in all five times. The last time the syrup must be at the first state as described for syrup of sugar. Inexperienced persons will do well to try at first with a few fruits, and go through the whole process, after which it will be comparatively easy. Every one is awkward in doing a thing for the first time, and does not do it well, however easy or simple it may be. That is the reason why societies of farmers make

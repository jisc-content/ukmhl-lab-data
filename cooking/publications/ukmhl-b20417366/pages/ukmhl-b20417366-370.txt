EGGS, MACARONI, AND EICE. 364 sons at the table; beat them well with salt and pepper, by means of a fork A little grated nutmeg may be added, if liked. The adding of milk to the eggvs makes the ome- let soft. To make it,â€”Always have a brisk fire to make an ome- let ; the quicker it is made tbe better, and the less butter it requires. If possible, have a frying-pan to make ome- lets only in; keep it in a clean place and never wash it if you can lielp it; by warming it a little before making the omelets and wiping it with a coarse towel, you can keep it as clean as can be without washing. To wash it causes the omelet to adhere to it while cooking, and in- jures its appearance. Commence by beating the eggs, then put the butter in the frying-pan, about two ounces for eight eggs; set on the fire and toss gently to melt the . butter as evenly and as quickly as possible, else some of it will get black before the whole is melted. As soon as melted, turn the beaten eggs in, and stir and move con- tinually with a fork or knife, so as to cook the whole as nearly as possible at the same time. If some part of the omelet sticks to the pan, add a little butter, and raise that part with a knife so as to allow the butter to run under it, and prevent it from sticking again. It must be done quickly, and without taking the pan from the fire. When ^ cooked according to taste, soft or hard, fold, dish, and serve warm. It is folded in this way: run the knife or fork under one part of the omelet, on tlie side nearest to the handle of the pan, and turn that part over the other part of the omelet, so as to double it or nearly so; then have an oval dish in your left hand, take hold of the frying-pan with tbe right hand, the thumb upward instead of the fingers, as is generally the case in taking hold of a pan, incline

POULTRY. 275 ASPIC OF MEAT. Cut four middling-sized onions in slices, lay tbem in a stewpan with a quarter of a pound of bacon (not smoked) ; then add about a quarter of a pound of each of the follow- ing meats: chicken, game (any kind), mutton, and beef, also a calf s foot split in two, two ounces of rind of bacon, two sprigs of parsley, two of tliyme, a clove of garlic, two carrots cut in two, one clove, and four small onions; wet witli half a pint of water, and set on a brisk fire; cover the pan well. "When nearly cooked, take the grease off witli a ladle; add then boiling water enough just to cover the whole, and finish the cooking. Strain the juice, skim off the fat, if any, and let it cool; if it is not found clear enough when strained, beat well two whites of eggs, put them in. the stewpan with the juice, set it on a sharp fire for about ten minutes, stirring the while, and take from the fire; add to it a few" drops of lemon-juice, and strain again. Put in a mould some of the above juice, about two- eighths of an inch in depth; place the mould on ice, and leave till the juice has turned into a jelly. Lay on that jelly some of the following meats, free from bones, and not allowing the pieces to touch the sides of the mould : chicken, game, tongues of beef, calf, and sheep, of all or of either of them (the meats must be cooked beforehand). Cover the whole with the remainder of the juice, so as to have about the same thickness at the top as at the bot- tom. Place the mould in a refrigerator to cool, and turn into a jelly; then dip the m.ould in very warm water, turn over on a dish, remove the mould, and you have a fine entree.

SAUCES. 110 1. Make an AUemande sauce; and when done, add to it two ounces of butter and half a gill of consomme; stir and mix, and place on a brisk fire to start it boilmg at once; take it from the fire as soon as it becomes thick; then add a few drops of lemon-juice, and use. 2. Make a roux; add to it about half a pint of chicken gravy ; stir or boil five or six minutes; then add two ounces of butter^ the juice of a lemon, a pinch of parsley chopped fine; give one boil, and use. 3. This is made like No. 2, except that you use an AUemande sauce instead of a roux^ and besides the pint of chicken gravy, etc., you add also half a gill of white wine. It is used especially with roasted chicken and game. Tomato,—If you use fresh tomatoes, blanch them first; if preserved, use them as they are in the can. Put one pint of tomatoes in a saucepan with a small onion and a clove of garlic sliced; also two stalks of parsley, one of thyme, a bay-leaf, one clove, six .pepper-corns, and salt; boil gently till reduced about one-third, when mash gently through a strainer or sieve ; all the tomato-seed, and sea- sonings must remain in the strainer; put back on the fire, with a little piece of butter; give one boil, and it is done. JVwj^e.—This sauce is made like a caper-sauce, using chopped or sliced truffles instead of capers. F^Zow^e'e—This and gTavy is nearly the same thing.

Vinaigrette.—-Put salt and pepper in a saucer (jmd mustard, if it is to be used with butcher's meat; but with fish, chicken, or birds, it is really too strong; it neutralizes the delicate flavor of the object), and pour vinegar over,

FISH. 140 FROGS. Tlie bind-legs of frogs only are used as food; former- ly they were eaten by the French only, bnt now, frog-eat- ing has become general, and the Americans are not behind any others in relishing that kind of food. Fried.—Skin well, and throw into boiling ater with a little salt, for five minutes, the hind-legs only ; take out and throw them in cold water to cool, and drain. Have hot fat in a pan on the fire {see Directions for Fry- ing) ; lay the frogs in, and serve when done Avith fried parsley around. Stewed.—Skin, boil five minutes, throw in cold water, and drain as above. Put in a stewpao two ounces of but- ter (for two dozen frogs); set it on the fire, and when melted, lay the legs in, fry two minutes, tossing now and then; then sprinkle on them a teaspoonful of flour, stir with a wooden spoon, add two sprigs of parsley, one of thyme, a bay-leaf, two cloves, one of garlic, salt, white pepper, and half a pint of white wine; boil gently till done, dish the legs, reduce the sauce on the fire, strain it, mix in it two yolks of eggs, pour on the legs, and serve them. LOBSTER. Never buy a dead lobster. Large lobsters are not as good as small ones. From about one to two pounds and a half in weight are the best. The heavier the better. Lobsters are better at some seasons of the year than at others. They are inferior when full of eggs. It is from mere prejudice that the liver (also called torn- alley) is eschewed. This prejudice may come from its turning green on boiling the lobster.

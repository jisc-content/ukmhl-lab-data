422 PASTKY. Pate a cAow^r.—-Weigli four ounces of fiour, to which iidd half a teaspoonful of sugar. Put two gills of cold w ater in a tin saucepan with two ounces of butter, and set it on the fire, stir a little with a wooden spoon to melt the butter before the water boils. At the first boiling of the water, throw into i^ the four ounces of flour and stir very fest with the spoon, holding the pan fast with the left hand. As soon as the whole is thoroughly mixed, take from the fire, but continue stirring for about fifteen or twenty seconds. It takes hardly half a minute from the time the flour is dropped in tbe pan to that when taken from the fire. The quicker it is done, the better. When properly donCj nothing at all sticks to the pan, and by touching it with the finger it feels as soft as velvet, and does not adhere to it at all. Let it stand two or three minutes, then mix well with it, by means of a spoon, one egg; then another, and so on ; in all four. It takes some time and work to ipix the eggs, especiall}?^ to mix the first one, the paste being rather stiff. They are added one at a time, in order to mix them better. If the eggs are small, add half of one or one more. To use only half a one, it is necessary to beat it first Let the paste stand half an hour, stir again a little, and use. If it is left standing for some time and is found rather dry, add a little egg, wdiich mix, and then use. Beignets Souffl,es—{also called Pets de JVonne).—MsLke some pate a choux; take a small tablespoonful of it,, holding the spoon with the left hand, and with the fore- finger of the right cause the paste to fall in hot fat on the fire [see Frying), turn over and over again till fried, then turn into a colander, dust with sugar, and serve hot. In frying, the paste will swell four or five times its size, and by dropping it carefully and as nearly of a round shape as possible, the cakes will be nearly round when done.

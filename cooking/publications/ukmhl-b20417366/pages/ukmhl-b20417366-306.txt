300 GAME. garlic, Olio onion sliced, two stalkB of thyme, four of pai's- ley, and twelve pepper-corns; set it on the lire, give one boil, and turn over the piece of venison. Turn the piece of meat over occasionally for one or two days, and then cook it. Another way,—Lard the piece of venison and put it in a crockery vessel; spread all over tvv^o or three onions and a clove or two of garlic (both sliced), half a gill of sweet-oil, same of claret wine, a pinch of allspice, four cloves, and two sprigs of thyme; baste twice a day for two or three days, and then cook. To hake.—Pot the venison in a baking-pan with the seasonings in which it has improved ; spread some butter on it, and bake in a rather quick oven; baste now and then, and turn over if necessary. When baked, serve with a ravigote sauce, to which you have added the gravy from the pan in which it has been baked. Serve it also with a cranberry, piquante^ Robert^ or Tarta.r sauce, or with cur- rant-jelly. In Civet.—-Shoulder, neck, and breast-pieces are cut and prepared in civet, in the same way as a civet of rabbit. It may also be kept three or four days and w^armed in a bain-marie ; it improves it as much as that of rabbit. With Mushrooms.—Any piece of venison, baked or roasted, may be served with a garnitare of mushrooms. Cutlets^ broiled.—The cutlets are much better when improved as directed. The seasonings are spread all over. They are then wrapped up in buttered paper and broiled on a quick fire. They may also be larded with salt pork, ^nd then broiled with or without being enveloped in paper. When broiled and dished, serve them warm with a maitre d'hotel or ravigote sauce. Sautees.—Put six cutlets in a stewpan, larded or not,

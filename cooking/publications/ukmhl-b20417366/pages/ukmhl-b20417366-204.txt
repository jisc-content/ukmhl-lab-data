198 MUTTON. LAMB. To select.—The flesh must be like that of mutton, rather black, and the fat white. There is no difference in the wether and ewe. The shorter the quarters are the better the meat, and the fore as well as the hind quarter. With the exception that the breast-piece is prepared also in epigramme, and that it is cut in quarters instead of dividing it like mutton, lamb may be prepared in the same and every way like mutton. The quarters may be prepared like shoulder, leg, and sad- dle of mutton. Chops may be cut and prepared the same as mutton- chops. Fore-Quarter.—According to the opinion of a gTeat many epicures, the fore-quarter is the best part of the lamb; but, as we have previously said, every one to his liking. Lard it slightly, and envelop it with buttered paper, place it upon the spit before a good fire; when done take from the fire, and take the paper off, sprinkle on it salt, pepper, and chopped parsley ; put back on the spit before a sharp fire, just Jong enough to allow it to take a fine color; then take off, run a knife under the shoulder to make a small hole, pour onaitre dlibtel sauce in it, and serve either as it is, with its gravy, or on a imree of sorrel. To hake it.—Put it in a baking-pan, spread a little salt, pepper, and butter over it; cover it with a piece of buttered paper; have the bottom of the pan covered with cold w^ater and put in a warm oven, baste often till done. If the paper burns, put on another piece. Kun a small knife or a skewer into the meat, to ascertain when proper ly done.

MUTrON. 191 roast or bake, and serve it with either of the following sauces: piquante, poivrade, ravigote^ remolade^ Robert, shallot, Tartar, tomato, and in vinaigrette. Decorated.—leg of mutton may be decorated the same as a fillet of beef. Stewed,—Take the large bone out, leaving the bone at the smaller end as a handle; cut off also the bone below the knuckle, and fix it with skewers; then put it in a stew- pan with a pinch of allspice, four onions, two cloves, two carrots cut in four pieces each, a small bunch of parsley, two bay-leaves, three sprigs of thyme, salt, pepper, two ounces of bacon cut in slices, a quarter of a pint of broth, and water enough just to cover it; set on a good fire, and after one hour of boiling add a liquor-glass of French brandy. Let simmer then for about five hours, in all about six hours; then dish it, strain the sauce on it, and serve. We would advise those who have never tasted of a leg of mutton cooked as above, to try it. It may be served also with white beans cooked in wa- ter and fried in butter, or on fried potatoes. The next day.—If you have a piece left for the next day, cut it in thin slices after dinner, place the slices on a dish, with parsley under, in the middle, and above, and keep in a cold place. A while before dinner you put in a stewpan a piece of butter (the quantity to be according to the quantitj^ of meat), and set it on a good fire; when melted, sprinkle in, gradually, a little flour, stirring with a wooden spoon ; when of a proper thickness, and of a brownish color, add a glass of broth, salt, pepper, a fev/ pickled cucumbers cut in slices, and two or three mushrooms; boil ten minutes; lay the slices of meat in, subdue the fire, simmer twenty minutes, and serve.

FISH. 160 Ifc is generally admitted that boatmen prepare it better than others, and the receipts we give below came from the most experienced chowder-men of the Harlem River. Potatoes and crackers are used in different proportions, the more used, the thicker the chowder will be. Pat in a pot (technical name) some small slices of fat salt pork, enough to line the bottom of it; on that, a layer of potatoes, cut in small pieces; on the potatoes, a layer of chopped onions; on the onions, a layer of tomatoes, in slices, or canned tomatoes; on the latter a layer of clams, whole or chopped (they are generally chopped), then a layer of crackers. Then repeat the process, that is, another layer of pota- toes on that of the clams: on this, one of onions, etc., till the pot is nearly full. Every layer is seasoned with salt and pepper. Other spices are sometimes added ac- cording to taste; such as thyme, cloves, bay-leaves, and tarragon. When the whole is io, cover with water, set on a slow fire, and v/hen nearly done, stir gently, finish cooking, and serve. As we remarked above, the more potatoes that are used, the thicker it will be. When done, if found too thin, boil a little longer ; if found too thick, add a little water, give one boil, and serve. Another vmy,â€”Proceed as above in every particular, except that you omit the clams and crackers, and when the rest is nearly cooked, then add the chopped clams and broken crackers, boil fast about twenty-five minutes longer, and serve. If found too thick or too thin, proceed exactly as for the one above.

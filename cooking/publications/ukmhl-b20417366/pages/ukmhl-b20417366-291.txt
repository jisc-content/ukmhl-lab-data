GAME. 285 hen as directed for birds; put it in a baking-pan with one ounce of butter spread on it, also salt and pepper^ and a gill of cold water in the pan, and bake till underdone, when cut it in seven pieces, making three slices in the breast, lengthwise. Peel and slice two carrots and two turnips; cut the slices about an inch thick; then cut again in small round pieces, with a frait-corer, about half an inch in diameter; set them on the hre with cold water and salt, boil gently till done, drain and turn immediately in cold water, and they are ready to be used. Put a small head of cabbage in a saucepan with half a pound of lean salt pork, just cover it with cold water, and boil gently till done. The prairie-hen, carrots, and turnips, and the cab- bage, may be cooked at the same time, but separately, as directed. When the cabbage is done, turn it into a col- ander, cut it rather fine with a spoon, press gently on it to get the water out as much as possible without mash- ing it through the colander, and it is ready to be used. Butter the mould well; place slices of boiled beets on the bottom ; some letters or flowers may be cut in beet, the intervals or holes filled with turnips and carrots; when the bottom is lined with beets, carrots, and turnips, lay hori- zontally a row of pieces of carrots all around and against the sides of the mould; place a similar one of turnips on the carrots, and so on, the last row being as high as the top of the mould. Then put a Ja^rer of the cabbage on the bottom, about half an inch thick—that is, on the car- rots, turnips, and beets—place a like layer on the sides with a spoon; put the pieces of prairie-hen in the middle, cover with a layer of cabbage, and bake about fifteen min- utes in an oven at about 350 deg. Fahr. The meat must not touch the carrots or turnips, but be entirely surrounded with cabbage, else it would crumble down in removing the

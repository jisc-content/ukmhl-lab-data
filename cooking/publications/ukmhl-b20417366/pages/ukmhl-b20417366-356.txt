VEGETABLES. 350 JVasiuriiiim.—Th.h is said to be a native of Mexico; it makes a good salad in summer time. Make and serve like a salad of lettuce. Chervil and SorreL—In Italy, Spain, and tlie south of France, they make salad with these two vegetables, half of each, prepared and served like lettuce. Some persons like a thick sauce with salad; it is made thus: Put a hard-boiled yolk of egg in a bowl, mash it, and then mix with it salt and a tablespoonful of vinegar; when these three are thoroughly mixed, add pepper and oil (about two tablespoonfuls of oil), little by little, stir- ring and mixing well the while; turn the mixture over the salad, and move as directed above. The mixture may be prepared in the salad-dish, and the salad put in afterward. Mustard should never be used with lettuce; it is too strong to be eaten with such tender vegetables. Of Salsify,—In the spring, when the top of the sal- sify has grown for one or two weeks only, and immedi- ately after the frost is out of the ground, cut it off, split it in four, wash it well, drain it dry, and prepare as a salad of lettuce. The root is prepared as described for salsify, and is never made in salad. Of Cucumbers.—Peel and slice them, then put them in a vessel, salt every layer, and leave thus in a cool place about one hour, drain them dry and then dress them with oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper; slices of onion may be added, if liked. Of Beans.—-Boil the beans in w^ater with a little salt, drain them dry, and then dress them with parsley chopped fine, salt, pepper, oil, and vinegar. Of Beets.—^Boil the beets in water only till done, and when cool, peel and slice them, and prepare them with pepper, salt, vinegar, and oil. The beets may be baked.

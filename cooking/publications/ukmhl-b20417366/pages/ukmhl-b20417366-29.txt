DIEECTIONS^ EXPLANATIONS, ETC, 23 It is not tlie amount tliat is eaten which nourishes, "but the amount that is digested ; an excess of food is as bad as a lack of it. Good and well-baked bread is nutritious and healthful, while unbaked bread is heavy and difficult of digestion. Take at least half an hour's rest after a hearty meal, for mind and stomach cannot work at the same time. "Never eat when angry, or tired, or when heated ; but be as cool and as gay as possible, for food being exposed to a heat of about 100 degrees Fahr, iu the stomach, would ferment instead of digesting. Take a hearty but by no means heavy dinner. Eat slowly, at regular hours, and masticate well, but do Dot bolt your food, or eat any thing that does not taste good. Drink slowly, moderately, and always taste before swallowing. Yary your food as much as possible. Always have at least one dish of vegetables for dinner, besides meat, and also ripe fruit. See that every thing you eat or drink is of a good quality, wholesome and properly prepared. ECONOMY. There is not a word so much misused in cooking as the word economy. Prejudice comes for a large share in the use of it. How many things are thrown away, or wasted by mere prejudice or ignorance! It is often from economy that a woman, washes meat, becanse some part of it does not look clean. Instead of washing it, do not buy it; or, if bought, cut off a thin slice and throw it away: it is more economical than wash- ing the whole piece, which you partly destroy by the process.

4:58 PASTEY. Have a towel w(^ii dusted witli flour, place the dougli on it upside down, that is, the furrowed side under; let rise as ordinary bread; turn it into a pan, but so that the fur- rowed side will be up (the side that was down in rising must be up in baking) ; dust the furrow well with rye- flour to prevent the paste from closing, so that the top of the loaf will be concave instead of convex when baked. Another,â€”Steam half a pound of potatoes and mash them well; then mix them immediately and while hot with about a pint of flour, a quart of water, and half a pint of good strong yeast. Leave the mixture six hours in a rather warm place, then strain through a sieve, press- ing the potato-skins so as to squeeze all the liquid out of them. Immediately add to the strained mixture flour enough to make ordinary dough, which you knead a little, and let stand as it is from one to two hours and a half, according to temperature. Knead then with it about six pounds of flour, salt to taste, and tepid water to make or- dinary dough, and leave it thus two hours, then shape in the same wa}^ as the above; put it to rise in the same way also (it will take from one to two hours, according to temperature) ; dust with rye-flour, and bake., French bread may be shaped like other bread, round or square; it is just as good. Eolls, or rather French rolls as they are generally called, are made, shaped, and baked in the same way. It is a mistake to call bread certain mixtures of flour, soda, and milk; or flour, milk, and butter, etc.; it is no more bread than a mixture of carbonic acid, water, alco- hol, molasses, vitriol, etc., is wine. No one can give a name to such a mixture except chemists.

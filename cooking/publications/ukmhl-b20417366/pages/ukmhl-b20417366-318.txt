VEGETABLES. ?A2 We must say that we have not been able to try the experiment, but we should like very much to see what kind and how much work forty men would do, and for how .ong, with such a diet. There are many things that look or seem well, and even magnificent in theory, though en- tirely impracticable. It sounds well, especially to those who do not understand the meaning of it, to say that we feed mostly on gluten, albumen, gelatine, etc., and that we require so many ounces of carbon, oxygen, etc., in twenty- four hours. Every thing that we eat may be, with the exception of salt, turned into charcoal; but no one has yet been known to feed on it. Colored Beans^ stewed,—Soak, boil five minutes, and drain a quart of beans. Put in a stewpan half a pound of bacon and set it on the fire; five minutes after, put the beans in, with four small onions, salt, and pepper, boil gently till cooked, and drain. Put two ounces of butter in a stewpan on the fire; when melted, sprinkle in it a teaspoonful of flour, same of chopped parsley, then the beans, without the bacon and onions ; toss now and .then for fen minutes, then add half a pint of claret wine, the same of the water in which they were cooked, boil gently twenty minutes; then put in it also the bacon and onions, boil five minutes "longer, and serve the whole on the same dish. JBeetSy stewed,—Clean and wash w^ell, but do not skin them. Put in a crockery vessel a layer of rye straw, moisten it slightly, place the beets on it, cover the vessel, and place it in a slow oven for five or six hours; cool and skin them. When cooked, cut them in thin slices. Put butter in a stewpan, and when melted sprinkle in it a pinch of flour, a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, salt, and pep- per, then the beets; simmer twenty minutes, add a few drops of vinegar, and serve.

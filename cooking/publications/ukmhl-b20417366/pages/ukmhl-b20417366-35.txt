DIKECTIONS, EXPLANATIONS, ETC. 29 FAT FOR FRYING. Take beef suet, the ^art around the kidneys, or any Mnd of fat, raw or cooked; remove as much as possible fibres, nerves, thin skin, or bones; chop it fine, put it in a cast-iron or crockery kettle; add to it the fat you may have skimmed from the top of broth, sauces or, gravies. Set the pan on a moderate fire; boil gently for about fifteen minutes, skim it well daring the process; take from the fire, let it stand about five minutes, and then strain. Put it in a stone jar or pot, and keep it in a dry and cool place. Cover the jar when perfectly cold. It is as good as lard and more handy; it does not fly over the pan like lard. A careful cook seldom buys fat; generally there is enough coming from skimming of broth, sauces, and gravies, for every purpose. TO CLARIFY FAT. Set the fat on a moderate fire in a pan, and as soon as it commences to boil, place a slice of bread dried in the oven in it, boil gently for about half an hour; take from the fire, let it settle for a few minutes; remove the bread, turn gently into a jar or pot, leaving the dregs in the pan.

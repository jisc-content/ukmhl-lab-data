377 SWEET DISHES. lumps, set on a rather slow fire, and as soon as it comes to a boil, mix -with it the half pint put away, little by little, skimming off carefully the while, and when no more scum gathers on the surface, strain through a towel and com- mence the working. If the' sugar does not require to be clarified, that is, when it is good white sugar, set five pounds of it on the fire, in a copper pan, with nearly two quarts of water, and skim off carefully as soon as the scum gathers. It may be stirred a little to cause the sugar to melt evenl}^, but as soon as it commences to boil, stop stir- ring, else it will turn white and stringy. It passes from one state or degree to another in a very short time, and must be watched closely. It is at the first degree when, ^ by dipping a piece of wood into it so as to retain a crop of it at the end, and which you touch with another piece of woodâ€”if, by pulling them apart, slowly and immedi- ately, instead of separating it at once, it forms a thread, but that soon breaks. It marks then 34 at the hydrometer. It is at the second degree when, by repeating the same pro- cess,, tlie kind of thread formed does not break as easily as the first. It marks then 36. It is at the third degree when, by dipping a skimmer in it, holding it horizon- tally and striking it on the pan, then blowing on it, it forms small bubbles. It marks 39 at the hydrometer. It is at the fourth degree by trying again with the skimmer after a short time, and when, instead of forming bubbles, it will fly away like threads. It marks then 41. The fifth degree is when, by dipping a piece of wood in the sugar and quickly dipping it also in a bowl of cold water, shaking it at the same time and then biting it; if it breaks easily between the teeth, but at the same time is sticky, it has attained the fifth degree, and marks 44. A few boil- ings more and it is at the sixth degree, and by trying in the

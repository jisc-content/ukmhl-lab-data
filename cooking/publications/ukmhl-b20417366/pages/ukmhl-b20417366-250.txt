The best way to shape them, is to roll each part round first with a few bread-crumbs, then with a knife smooth both ends, while with the left hand you roll them gently^ and if wanted flat, strike gently on tbem with the blade of a knife. If wanted of a chop-shape, when fiat, shape with the hands and strike again to flatten them. Croquettes are made with any kind of cold meat. In Fricassee.—Clean, prepare, and cut as directed.

Trim the sides if not straight; cut three rows of holes in the middle with a fruit-corer, then cut the strip of paste in two, length- wise and in the middle of the middle row of holes. Cut it again across in pieces about three or four inches long. Put it in a warm place to dry till hard enough to keep in

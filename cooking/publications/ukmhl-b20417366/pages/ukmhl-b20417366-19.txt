13 COOKIKG. cording to directions, remember that it cannot be basted too often. The time necessary for roasting a piece of meat or any thing else, depends as mucb upon the fire as upon the nature of tbe meat. Meat especially requires to be placed very near the fire at first, and then pnt back by degreesc There is nearly as much difference between roasted and baked meat as there is between broiled and fried meat. It is generally admitted here, that English roast-beef is so superior to American roast-beef that it cannot be compared to it. It is not in the quality of the meat that the difference lies, but in the process of cooking. Meat cannot be roasted in an oven, be it in an ordi- nary or in a patented one. That peculiar flavor in roasted meat is produced by the air coming constantly in contact with the heated meat while revolving on the spit. Cold roasted meat, when desired to be served warm, is enveloped in buttered paper and placed on the spit just long enough to warm it. Saiiteing,â€”There is no word, that we know, in the English language, corresponding to the French word saute. It differs from frying in this: that to fry any object requires fat enough to immerse that object; while to saute it, re- quires just ei^ough to prevent it from scorching. Yegetables, omelets, etc., are sauted^ and not fried. Meat or fish cooked in a frying-pan with a little bnttei or fat, is sauted, and not fried ; but the term fried is most generally used, the other being only known to prac- titioners. To saute requires a brisk fire; the quicker an object is cooked by sauteing the better.

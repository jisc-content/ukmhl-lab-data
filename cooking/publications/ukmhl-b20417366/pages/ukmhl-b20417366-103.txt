SAUCES. There is no good cooking possible without good sauces. Many excellent pieces of meat, etc., are spoiled by being served with a poor sauce. Let every one bear in mind that water is no substitute for broth ; that vinegar or water is no substitute for wine, etc. There is no place w^here the old proverb can be better applied than in the kitchen, " Waste not, spare not." The French J Italians, S2^cmiardSj and Germans, use broth and wine in their cooking, and do not spend as much as the Ameiicans for their food ; they could not afford it; but they waste not, neither do they lose any thing good through carelessness or prejudice. Good sauces are not as difficult to make as is gener- ally believed. This general belief comes from the fact that many, after having partaken of a certain dish somewhere, and liking it much, ask of their own cook to prepare the same. The cook, most probably, has never heard of it, but nevertheless prepares a dish which is hardly eatable, and is to the other what a crab-apple is to a raspberry. The most important thing in making a sauce is for the cook to put his or her whole attention and care to it. 5

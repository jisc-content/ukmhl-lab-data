five-o’clock tea. 4 No. 4.—BUTTERED TOAST, I?igredients. i tin loaf Salt butter. 1. Cut your slices of bread half an inch thick, and toast on both sides before a clear fire. 2. Put in a plate, butter thickly, and cut the crust off each slice. 3. The toast should be put in the oven a few minutes before being served, and sent to table in a hot muffin dish. The pieces of toast should be no larger than two inches and a half square. N.B.—A delicate, thin square of toast spread with fresh dripping is by no means to be despised, and indeed is ex- tensively ordered by doctors for persons suffering from dyspepsia and other disorders. A little salt sprinkled over the dripping is a great improvement.

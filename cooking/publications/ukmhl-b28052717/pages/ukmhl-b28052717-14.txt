3 five-o’clock tea. No. 2.—-COFFEE. A good mixture for ordinary use is half Mocha and half Plantation, at 2s. a lb. Coffee should be roasted at home and ground only a few minutes before it is used. 1. Place a kettle of fresh soft water on the fire to boil. 2. Grind the coffee and allow an ounce for each person. 3. Place a thick, pointed calico bag in the per- colator, put the ground coffee into it, and pour very slowly a quart of fast-boiling water. It must on no account be urged to run through quicker than it naturally would, as the brightness and clearness of the coffee depend on this. 4. After the water has all run through the per- colator it should be allowed to simmer a few minutes, but on no account boil. N.B.—The milk served with coffee must be boiling, and the cups filled two-tliirds with it before the coffee is added.

3 FIVE-O’CLOCK TEA. No. 3.—COCOA. (Van Houten’s.) Bought in tins, 3J. 9d, a lb. Two teaspoonfuls to be used for a breakfast cup. 1. Put the cocoa into an enamel-lined saucepan and mix it thoroughly with a little warm milk. 2. Place the saucepan on the fire and add half a pint of cold water for two teaspoonfuls of cocoa. 3. Let it boil up. 4. Half fill the cups with cocoa. 5. Add hot (but not boiled) milk to each, and a lump of sugar, if liked. 6. Serve at once. N.B.—Van Houten’s cocoa is so frequently ordered by physicians for dyspeptic and nervous patients, to be drank instead of tea, that a receipt showing how to prepare it will not be out of place in these pages.

PREFACE. K>« The great and unexpected success that has at- tended the publication of “ Breakfast Dishes ” and “ Savouries and Sweets,” induces me to offer to the public the present collection of receipts for that favourite meal known as “ Five-o’clock Tea.” Now that the marriage hours have been ex- tended to the afternoon, the old heavy “ wedding- breakfast ” will shortly be a thing of the past, and its place usurped by refreshments of a lighter and less expensive character, in view of which I have supplemented my English and Foreign cake receipts, with several for “ Savoury Sandwiches,” “ Cups,” “ Cooling Drinks,” etc., suitable for the purpose, and such as have been of late extensively used at afternoon teas in large establishments where the dinner hour is protracted beyond eight o’clock.

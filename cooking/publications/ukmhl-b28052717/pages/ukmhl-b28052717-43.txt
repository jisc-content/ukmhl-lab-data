Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth with a wooden spoon, having been very careful that no particle of yolk gets among them. 2. Roll the icing sugar and sift it through a fine sieve. 3. Mix the sugar gradually with the eggs. 4. Work the two together for a few minutes and add a drop or two of vanilla essence. 5. Now spread it smoothly over the cake to be iced. 6. Dry it very gently indeed, in quite a cool oven. N.B.—Should the icing be required of a pink colour, use a drop or two of cochineal, and thoroughly mix it with the icing before spreading it over the surface of the cake. From the difference in the size of eggs, a little more or less sugar may be required.

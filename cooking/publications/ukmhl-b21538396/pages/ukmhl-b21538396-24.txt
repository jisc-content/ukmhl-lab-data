AN OLD-WORLD RECIPE BOOK balls about the size of marbles and fry brown in the pan. This receipt is very excellent for gravy hare, carrot, or other soups—leaving out the skin and substituting either carrot or hare, but they will not require so much thickening. The bones of a calf’s head greatly im- prove soup. Three lbs. of skin and a tongue, with the balls ordered, is sufficient for one gallon of soup. For carrot soup, add more carrots, and pulp a few through a sieve to thicken with. All soups are in- finitely better for being made the day before you want them. May 14, 1844.

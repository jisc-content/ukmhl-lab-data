31 SAVOURIES A LA MODE. Asparagus Omelet. Omelettes aux Pointes d'Asperges. Boil about twenty-five heads of asparagus, and cut the green ends when tender into short pieces. Mix with them four well-beaten eggs, adding a little pepper and salt. Melt an ounce of butter (or perhaps rather more) in an omelet-pan, pour in the mixture, stir till it thickens over the fire, fold it nicely over. Asparagus sauce may be served with it, or clarified butter into which a few drops of vinegar have been poured. Asparagus with Cream. Asperges a la Creme. Cut up some heads of asparagus, wash and drain them, boil them for three minutes, and simmer for half an hour ; drain again, and stir some clotted cream into them, and serve in a glass dish. Asparagus a la Pompadour. Boil the asparagus in boiling salt and water. When cooked, cut it into lengths of about three inches, drain them, and let them lie before the fire for a few moments. Then take one ounce of fresh butter, two yolks of egg, a pinch of salt, a salt- spoonful of pepper, and a tablespoonful of vinegar. Cook in a saucepan till thick ; dish up the asparagus in a pyramid, and pour the sauce over.

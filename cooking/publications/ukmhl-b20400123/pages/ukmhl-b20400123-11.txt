PREFACE. Savoury dishes at the present time being so fashionable, and novelties in them so much in- quired for, I have been persuaded by my friends to publish a small book on the subject. Many of the recipes are new, a few original, and I trust all will be found welcome. I have endeavoured to give all the recipes in as practical a manner as possible, so that any plain cook could manage them, at all events after one or two trials, and with a few hints from her mistress. And as I am glad to know that in these days of Schools of Cookery many mistresses have become their own chef, bad cooking in an establishment should be a thing of the past. HARRIET A. DE SALIS.

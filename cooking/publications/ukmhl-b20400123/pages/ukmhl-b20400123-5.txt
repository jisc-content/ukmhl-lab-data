Third Edition, in crown Svo. with 8 full-page Coloured Plates and 37 Woodcuts, price Js. 6d. COOKERY AND HOUSEKEEPING; A MANUAL OF DOMESTIC ECONOMY FOR LARGE AND SMALL FAMILIES. By Mrs, HENRY REEVE, ' We can but hope that this book, which is both a manual for the givers of dinner parties and a recipe-book for cooks, and is adapted to all sorts and conditions of diners, may not only lead to a consider- able extension of culinary knowledge, but induce those who have gained that knowledge to practise what they know.'—Observer. ' It is impossible within the space of a notice to point out all the merits of this book, or to give in anything like detail the various points advocated by Mrs. Reeve ; but we can heartily recommend her Cookery and HouseJzeeping as one of the best, as it is certainly one of the least, technical books ever written on household and kitchen economics.' Bell's Life in London. * Bears the signs of a careful endeavour to get as far on the road to culinary perfection as possible. Mrs. Reeve has evidently made a serious study of domestic economy and the food of households, and her book is not a mere compilation tossed together without experience or counsel.'— Daily Telegraph. * If I had only had this book when I first viarried^ what a nu7)iberof foolish mistakes and ignorant extravagances I should have bee^i spared! was the exclamation of a lady, now an experienced and most successful housekeeper, as she looked through Mrs. Reeve's cookery-book. The * book is deserving of great praise, both in its arrangement and treat- ment, in which it differs greatly from most books of its class, and we think it will be found most practicable and reliable in the way the scheme is carried out. .... Mrs. Reeve need not fear that the publication of this book will be deemed presumptuous ; it will, on the contrary, be found most helpful, as it amply fulfils the intention with which it was undertaken.'—Spectator.

Salade Russe, Chop up some cold fillets of chicken and par- tridge with carrots, turnips, and asparagus, all of which have been cooked ; take some cold boiled peas, small French beans, beetroot cut into lozenges, crayfish tails, capers, stoned olives, and fillets of anchovy ; stir all these ingredients thoroughly to- gether, and add a little caviar, a pinch of cayenne, a minced shalot, black pepper, mustard, oil, and vinegar.

CHAPTER II. 17 No meats to be fried—All sauces, except the natural gravy, to be served separately—Grilling on char- coal—Eschew gas stoves for cooking of meats, and do not bake your joints. My first three points are—firstly, no meats are to be fried; secondly, they are not to be served with any gravy or sauce save their own, and that gravy not diluted to the extent of a soup, any other sauce being served separately ; thirdly, in- variably use a charcoal stove for grilling—nothing better than charcoal for developing the flavour of meat. This stove costs but a few shillings, and will often save a coal fire. No preparing of meats on gas stoves and no baking of meats to be permitted. 2

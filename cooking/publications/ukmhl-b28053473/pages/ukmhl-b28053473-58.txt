BEAL COOKEBY. 54 Curried Lobster. Being determined not to use any fishmonger- boiled lobsters, I have none but “ green” ones for a curry. Cut up the lobster and stew in its own juice and the curry IB minutes only. Pick the meat from the shells and return to the curry when the latter is sufficiently reduced and ready to serve. If you desire a rich dish, add the lobster butter, as described page 71 (crawfish butter). The fish thus prepared ought to be exquisitely tender. If you had taken a boiled lobster it would have been hard and dry. Why cook a thing twice? Shellfish twice boiled—in short, overcooked—must be indigestible. Baked Lobster. Stew the green lobster, as above shown, shred the meat and put back into the shells with a little of the court-bouillon (see page 51), a few bread crumbs and slightly bake in the oven, salamander. Serve with the lobster butter separately, or with the saiLce diplomate (see page 71).

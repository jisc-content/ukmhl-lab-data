PART II. You who have clone me the kindness to follow me thus far, do not, please, expect a complete treatise on the art of cooking, or a list of recipes, such as the professed cook is in the habit of referring to. My object is only to en- lighten you—and any intelligent cook—as to good and sound principles. The recipes I give are very few, and are only intended to illustrate these principles, which are :— I. Do not fry or bake meats. II. Do not cook meat on gas stoves. III. Grill whenever you can. IY. Do not overcook. Y. No shams, no “ messes,” no pretentious efforts. YI. Simplicity.

73 SWEETS. I cannot leave the subject of sauces without referring to the more than frequent cases of failure of shrimp and lobster sauce. The reason of their pasty taste is that they are, alas, prepared too often with the vilest “ drawn butter ” instead of with good white stock, and that the shrimps and lobster are over-cooked. Good drawn butter, how- ever, with the lobster or shrimps, just warmed and no more, will produce excellent results. I prefer not to flavour with anchovy in case of shrimp sauce; properly prepared it does not need any extra flavouring. Green lobster, again, makes a much better lobster sauce than the boiled lobster. Sweets. Caramel.—One of the best and most nourishing is a rich custard, steamed in a mould lined with caramel (burnt sugar), and flavoured with vanilla pod—not the essence. Serve with a cream and egg sauce, also flavoured with vanilla.

REAL COOKERY. 68 beyond you, unless you possess a very excellent cook and a good long purse. But we must discuss a few besides the very simple ones already men- tioned ; those of oil with lemon, salt, and pepper, and their development, into the vinaigrette, the sauce verte, or the ravigote, and we must also say a word about thickening and glaze. Glaze is the most important of bases for sauces. Take thick veal cutlets, reduce with carrots, onions, and peppercorns, little or no salt; reduce all day, strain. (Can be procured at Benoistâ€™s, in Piccadilly.) Thickening with flour and water, or flour and milk, or flour and stock should be prepared on the fire, passed through a tammy, and stirred five minutes with a wooden spoon while pouring into the sauce. Thickening with butter and flour (roux) is prepared on a low fire until a light brown, and then poured into the sauce on a brisk fire until it boils. Then put aside, let it simmer 1 hour, and skim. Thickening with egg is done after the sauce has been taken off the fire and cooled at least 2 minutes, otherwise it turns when the eggs are put into it.

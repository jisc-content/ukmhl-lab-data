ON GRILLING FISH AND FOWL. 19 should be altogether prohibited. If any wine be used, it must be sound, pure, grape-juice out of your own cellar, and not so-called “ cooking wine,” bought by the cook. It is only too often an adulterated article. Persuade your cook to substitute the grill for the frying-pan, as to fish and fowl as well as for meat. I am sure both your palate and your digestion will be the gainers by that change. Caution your cook in regard to overcooking. As a rule, fish and fowl are cooked more than neces- sary, much to the detriment of flavour and delicacy, not to mention both thereby being rendered tough and indigestible. This remark applies in par- ticular to shell-fish and to the sauces of which shell-fish are the basis. Nothing could be worse than overcooked shrimp or lobster sauce; and many a time, when you thought your fish was not fresh, I am sure it was simply overcooked. (See page 73 for my suggestions as to the preparation of such sauces.)

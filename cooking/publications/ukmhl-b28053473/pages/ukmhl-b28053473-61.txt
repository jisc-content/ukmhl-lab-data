OTHER FISH. 57 Other Fish. Frying being tabooed, you will readily discover other and excellent ways of preparing fish. Grilled, baked, or au gratin, or roasted as suggested by Sir Henry Thompson, or, if simply boiled, then served with plain melted butter and hashed parsley (not drawn butter), or with oil and lemon juice, or with a simple sauce verte (see page 68). Sir H. Thompson and Mr. Child draw attention to the much-neglected juice of the fish itself. Stew fish in its own court-bouillon and serve the latter, strained, but leaving the whole peppers and per- haps a laurel leaf or two in it, garnishing with slices of lemon. The addition of a little thicken- ing and a little white wine will bring you very close to the sauce au vin blanc. Let your grilled fish taste of the fire and serve with a pat or two of maitre d'lidtel butter, if a bit dry. Boiled white fish, as most good cooks know, are improved in colour by rubbing with lemon before boiling.

CHAPTER VI. Simplicity, and again simplicity—On the folly of trying to produce dinners on the same lines as the banquets of the rich, who employ first-class French cooks—An excellent dinner quite possible in any house, even in lodgings. Let your dinner, even for a party, be simple. Really good French cooking is simple and not a bit like the rich, make-believe French dishes we so often meet with, intended to charm the eye by decoration in doubtful taste rather than to rejoice the palate. Allow me also to say to those who are not dyspeptics, but who may be leading indoor lives, that simple, daintily cooked and judiciously varied meats would be far better for their health and comfort than the usual style of cooking at a London dinner party. •m

CHAPTER VIII. 29 Entrees (continued)—-Good entrees or none at all—Sauces to be served separately. You will readily conclude from the foregoing remarks that your entrees, simple though they be, must be more toothsome than the vapid dishes I have named. Lou will find later on abundant suggestions for entrees, but, I should suggest your being content with a good beefsteak and potatoes, rather than striving to produce a dish beyond your powers or simply worthless. In the matter of sauces let them be served separately. I do not know why the vile habit of drowning every piece of meat in sauce and allowing it to soalc has penetrated into almost every house. Let your grilled or roasted meat come to table hot and unimpaired in flavour, in its own gravy only; then, if I do not fancy your sauce, I may go without.

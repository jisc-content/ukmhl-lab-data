BEAL COOKEBY. 58 Above all things eschew purees of fish or shell- fish : they are hateful, and, I think, indigestible to boot. Many kinds of fish can be dressed au gratin in the oven. When you are tired of sole, take a good- sized whiting, remove the bones, then a little butter and a squeeze of lemon and a sprinkling of chopped mushrooms and chives will produce a capital result. Cover your fish with buttered paper. Cold trout and other fish are excellent with a sauce of oil, salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon. Finely-chopped chives, too, are a grateful addition to this sauce. Meat. In roasting as well as in grilling it is essential that the meat be exposed to a very fierce fire to begin with, in order to set the albumen which then forms a coat in which the juices remain unimpaired; no knife or fork ought to be put into the meat, be- cause then the juice would escape. For testing steaks or chops a pair of light tongs may be used.

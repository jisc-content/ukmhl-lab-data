64 REAL COOKERY. Vegetables. None to be peppered in the kitchen except tomatoes, mushrooms, &c. Potatoes.â€”Always prefer the mealy to the wraxy tuber. If you like them very mealy, put them into cold water, boil up quickly, and give them a good shaking in the pot when done. If mashed, they must not he a damp, firm paste. No milk or butter to be used. They are excellent simply passed through a close wire sieve ; and so are potato chips properly pre- pared, i.e., without a particle of grease sticking to them. Potatoes boiled or baked in their skins have more flavour than when cooked after peeling. French (string) beans should be carefully cleaned ; no strings left adhering. Excellent cold, dressed with oil, vinegar (very little), salt, and pepper. Caidifioicer should be served -with Hollandaise sauce (see page 69). Stewecl Cucumber, Chicory, Lettuce, and Celery are improved by a meat-stock sauce.

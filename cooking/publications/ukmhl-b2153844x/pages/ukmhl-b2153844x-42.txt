IN AID OF THE FUND FOR THE REMOVAL OF 26 Stuffed Fillets of Haddock. Take some filleted haddock from which the black skin has been removed, squeeze some lemon juice over it; prepare some stuffing of breadcrumbs, chopped parsley, mixed herbs and butter; mix these into a paste by pressing the butter into the other ingredients with a knife. Cut the fillets in half, and into each piece roll a little stuffing; put the fillets into a baking tin of boiling dripping, and bake for 15 to 20 minutes. Serve the fish with parsley or anchovy sauce poured over it. Mrs. Abbot. To Cook Plaice. Take a fine plaice, butter it thickly over, then sprinkle with breadcrumbs, chopped onions, parsley, pepper and salt, and bake it. Serve with the gravy that comes from it. Miss A. Todd. To Dress Crabs. Get two good crabs, take all the flesh out of the body and legs, pound it in a mortar to a paste, add 3 large handfuls of fresh breadcrumbs, and 3 table- spoonfuls of good cream, half the rind and juice of a lemon and cayenne to taste. When all these are mixed well together, put the mixture into the shells, which must be buttered first; shake breadcrumbs over .them, and brown them before the fire from 15 to 20 minutes.

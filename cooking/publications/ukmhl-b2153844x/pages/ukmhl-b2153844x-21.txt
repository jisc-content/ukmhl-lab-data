KING’S COLLEGE HOSPITAL TO SOUTH LONDON. Iced Soup. Take a good handful of sorrel and boil it till tender, press it through a sieve, chop it very fine, and lay it in a teacupful of cold water. Boil 4 eggs hard and chop them up fine, 4 small or 1 large lettuce, and 1 cucumber cut into slices; pepper and salt this mixture and pour white vinegar over it. A pint of cream and a little new milk, with some nice clean ice broken in lumps and added to the other ingredients. This soup must only be mixed about five minutes before it is sent to table. Miss M. Perkin. Jenny Lind Soup. Prepare a strong gravy stock free from grease, throw 2 tablespoonfuls of large sago into 3 pts. of boiling stock; cover closely and boil briskly for 40 minutes. Move the saucepan off the fire till it is a little cool, and stir in the yolks of 2 eggs. Shake on the fire till the proper thickness, and then stir in about 2 tablespoonfuls of cream. Mrs. Tunnard. Kidney Soup. Kidney soup made with this recipe is excellent and economical. Save the liquor in which a leg' of mutton has been boiled, place it on the fire, and in it boil a ilb. of bullock’s kidney. When it is half cooked, take it out and cut into dice of £in. square. Add to the stock 1 head of celery, 2 carrots, 1 turnip, 1 onion; boil together for 4 hours. Take it off the fire, strain it through a cloth, return the soup to the pan, add to it a teaspoonful of mushroom ketchup, pepper and salt to taste, and the pieces of kidney. Let it boil for 5 or 10 minutes, and serve. Mrs. McClintock. a

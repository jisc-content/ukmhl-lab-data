Take veal, lamb, or a fowl, boned; cut the cutlets and spread a little curdled milk or dye over each, and pat them well all over with a blunt chopper, almost to mincing, on both sides. Mix a large teaspoonful of pounded green ginger, or take a few pinches of dry ginger, and a spoonful of onions, with black pepper, cayenne, and salt to the taste. Mix all with an egg. When the cutlets are well patted, dip them or wet them all with the mixture. Have ready plenty of grated bread; roll the cutlets in it till well covered, forming them into a neat shape with the back of the knife. Melt 30ZS. of butter in a frying pan; when boiling, put in the cutlets; fry them a light brown. If served dry, throw fried parsley over them; if with sauce, make it, by boiling the bones with an onion, salt, and pepper, thickened with flour and butter, which pour over the cutlets. Warm them a few minutes. The juice of tomatoes makes a good addition if liked. Receipt by a Hindoo Cook of Dr. Playfair's Mother's. Braised Loin of Mutton.

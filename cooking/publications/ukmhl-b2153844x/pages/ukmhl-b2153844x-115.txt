Miss Baxter. Ham Cakes. A capital way of disposing of the remains of a ham and making an excellent dish for breakfast is: take i|lbs. ham, fat and lean together, put it into a mortar and pound it or pass it through a sausage machine. Soak a large slice of bread in |pt. of milk, and beat it and the ham well together; add one egg beaten up. Put the whole into a mould and bake a rich brown. Miss Baxter. Ham Toast. Grate and pound some cold ham; put it into a stew- pan with the yolk of an egg, a small piece of butter, and a little cream, pepper, and dry mustard. Stir till it is thick. Serve on buttered toast. A tomato may be added to the above, if liked. Mrs. II. W. Price. Hops d’oeuvre. Petites Bouehees a la Naylor. Stamp out sufficient rounds of bread for the number of people expected, and spread them with some cheese (doctored or seasoned Stilton, or any other at hand). Then spread with nice fresh butter.

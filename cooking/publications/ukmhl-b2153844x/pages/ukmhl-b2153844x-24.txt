IN AID OF THE FUND FOR TF1E REMOVAL OF 8 Melt the butter in a saucepan, then stir in the par- snips and onions skinned and cut into small pieces; cook for about five minutes, then add the tomato, sliced, and the stock. Cook until the parsnips are finite tender; pass all through a wire sieve; return the soup to the saucepan, and when it comes to the boil add the flour mixed with the cold milk; boil for three or four minutes, season with salt and white pepper, throw in the parsley and serve very hot.' If the soup is to be extra good, add the yolk of an egg and a tablespoonful of cream; they can be put in the tureen and soup poured over them. Artichoke Soup (2). Made in the same way as the above, allowing ilb. of artichokes to ipt. of white stock. Miss M. Pf.rkin. Polish Soup. Fill a good-sized jar with slices of beetroot cut in pieces, and cover them with cold water, to which should be added a slice of bread. The jar should then be covered and left until the juice, which be- comes a deep vermilion colour, is fermented, and has a sour taste; in warm weather three days will suffice for this, but in winter it takes five or six. The ferment which rises to the top must be re- moved and the juice passed through a sieve. It is then boiled with an equal quantity of strong beef stock, to which is added small pieces of ham. The soup comes to table looking clear and red, and for variety mav be made pink by adding a pint of sour cream. Miss Baxter.

KING’S COLLEGE HOSPITAL TO SOOTH LONDON. Chicken Brawn. Boil a fowl until tender; skin it, remove the bones, and cut the meat into small pieces (boil the bones and skin, and add a little veal to the stock the fowl has been boiled in to make a jelly). Add a small onion, mace, clove and peppercorns to flavour. Dis- solve some sheet gelatine, and clear with white of egg. Then arrange slices of hard-boiled eggs in a pattern at the bottom of the mould, and fill up with the meat and slices of ham or tongue. Then pour in the jelly as full as you can. A little beet or carrot could also be put in, if liked. Mrs. Smart. Chicken Cream for Invalids. Soak half a slice of bread in milk, then squeeze it dry; pound it in a mortar along with the breast of a raw chicken; pass it through a wire sieve; stir it in a bowl with a wooden spoon, add half a pint of cream, pepper and salt. When all is well mixed together, add in the white of one small egg, having previously switched it to a froth, put it into a small mould and steam it half an hour. Do not let it boil, but it must be in a constant heat on the point of boiling. Serve with white sauce, mushrooms, or spinach. The white meat of a cooked chicken may be thus used— a boiled one is best-—when not wanted specially delicate. Mrs. Rooke. Cigarettes a la Reine. Mince finely the meat of a cold chicken, mix with it a little chopped truffles, white sauce, pepper and salt. This forcemeat must be solid enough to roll like a paste. Shape like a cigarette, fry in egg and bread- crumb, very crisp, and serve with cress or parsley. Mrs. Crace. 8i

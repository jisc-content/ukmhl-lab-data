Stew the dates for 15 minutes, then cut up in rings and reject the stones. Make a syrup of good French vinegar in the proportion of rjlb. of good clean cooking sugar to a quart of French vinegar. After quartering the pippins, arrange them with the other fruit in a wide-mouthed bottle in alternate layers with finely-sliced ginger, peppercorns, sticks of cinnamon, and small sprink- lings of salt; then pour over the whole as much of the vinegar syrup as will entirely cover the fruit. Cork the bottle well down, expose it in a strong sun for a few days; leave to stand for a month, after which time it should be ready for use. Mrs. Macnamara.

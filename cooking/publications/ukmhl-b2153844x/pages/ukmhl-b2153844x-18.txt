Then have the stock warmed, but not hot, and have about ilb. of gravy beef free from fat. Chop this fine and add the whites of 3 eggs, a little salt, sugar, carrots, tarragon, onions, celery, pars- ley, marjoram, and a teaspoonful of tarragon vine- gar, a teaspoonful of Harvey and Worcester Sauce, and a little ketchup, and ipt. of cold water. Mix all well and add to the warm stock and whisk over the fire till it boils and let it simmer very slowly for an hour. Then strain through a fine cloth. This is quite enough soup for 10 or n people. The cook will be sure to take care not to put too much of the vegetables and herbs, and never add water after the soup is made, as it always tastes watery if this is done. Mrs. Rooke.

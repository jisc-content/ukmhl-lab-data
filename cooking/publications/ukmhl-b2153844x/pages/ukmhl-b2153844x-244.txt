Slice the pulp into a preserving pan. Add the rinds of half the oranges cut into thin strips, i^-lbs. loaf sugar broken small. Peel the rhubarb (iqt. cut finely), cut it into thin pieces, add it to the oranges, and stir all together over a gentle fire until the jam is done. Remove all the scum as it rises. Pot and cover down in the usual way. N.B.â€”Should the rhubarb be very old, cook it alone for quarter hour before adding to the other ingredients. Mrs. Bell. Rhubarb Jam (1). 61bs. Rhubarb. 61bs. lump Sugar. 6ozs. candied Lemon Peel. Chop up the rhubarb as for a tart and let the sugar remain in a large pan with it for 24 hours so that it may be dissolved. Then cut up the candied peel very small and boil all together for rather more than an hour. If the lemon peel is not liked ground ginger is a very nice flavouring; use ioz. to 61bs. rhubarb. July is the best month to make this jam. Miss Elderton. Rhubarb Jam (2). 61bs. Rhubarb. 5lbs. Sugar. 20ZS. bitter Almonds. 20ZS. ground Ginger (or less, according to taste).

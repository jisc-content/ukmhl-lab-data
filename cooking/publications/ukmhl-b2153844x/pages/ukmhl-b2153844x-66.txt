Then take it out and brown it before the fire with breadcrumbs. While that is doing, skim all the fat off the gravy, which should be served in a tureen; currant jelly should be served with it. One or two kidneys should be stewed with the mutton, but not sent to table. Mrs. Flux. Mushroom Pie. Fry very gently about 24 mushrooms in a little salt and butter, until they give a pleasant smell; then put them into a piedish with salt, pepper, a wine- glassful of cream, 2 of port wine, and quite a tumblerful of tomato juice, or peeled slices of the fruit. Cover with a light puff paste and bake. Mrs. Shepherd. Macaroni a lâ€™ltalienne, lib. Macaroni, jib. Butter. ^ an Onion. Grated Cheese. 6 or 7 large Tomatoes. Boil the macaroni in a great deal of water and salt, but do not break the pipes, or do it too much; then put into a stewpan the butter, the onion chopped fine, and the pulp of the tomatoes, that have been previously boiled and passed through a sieve.

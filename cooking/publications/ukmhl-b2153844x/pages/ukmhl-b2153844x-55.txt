KING’S COLLEGE HOSPITAL TO SOUTH LONDON. 39 MEATS AND ENTREES. Bredee. (/I favourite Cape dish.) Take 2lbs. thick ribs of mutton, cut into small pieces, and put into a stewpan with 2 onions cut small. Let meat and onion fry a nice brown, but don’t burn. Take 12 or more large tomatoes, cut into slices, add to the meat, with a little salt and red chilli; let the whole stew gently. If too watery remove the lid of the saucepan, till there is a rich gravy. Bredees should be made in shallow sauce- pans, as deep ones make it too watery. Mrs. McD. Troup. Beef au Gratin. Cut cold roast beef or mutton into thin neat slices and put them on a dish, overlapping each other. The same dish must be used on which they will go to table. Season them with chopped parsley and escha- lot, pepper and salt. Moisten them all over with good gravy or water mixed with Harvey’s sauce and ketchup. Strew some brown raspings over them, and sprinkle over a little dissolved butter. Put them in a hot oven for 10 minutes, and when quite hot send to table. Mrs. Hawkesworth.

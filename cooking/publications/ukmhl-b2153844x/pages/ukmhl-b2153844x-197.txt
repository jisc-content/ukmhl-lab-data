KING’S COLLEGE HOSPITAL TO SOOTH LONDON. 177 Oat Cakes. fib. fine Oatmeal (or medium). 2 teaspoonfuls of Bacon Gravy. 7j- teacupful cold Water, i teaspoonful Carbonate of Soda, i pinch of Salt. Take two good handfuls of meal, put them into a bowl with the water, soda, salt and bacon gravy (bacon gravy is the fat left on the dish or pan after frying bacon). Stir this mixture quickly with the hand; turn out cleanly on the board, on which you have ready two or three handfuls of meal. Knead more meal into the mixture till it is of proper con- sistency, but do not make it too stiff, as it will not work well. Work it between the palms of the hand to make it flat; lay it on the board and work it out, flattening it with the knuckles of the right hand, and keeping it to a round shape with the open palm of the left hand. Roll it lightly with the roller, cut it in four, rub each piece with meal on both sides. Put these pieces on the girdle, and when cooked on one side, put them on the toaster before the fire. If wanted very white, rub them with meal again, before putting them on the toaster. (Dripping may be used instead of bacon gravy, but then the water must be hot.) The cakes can be rolled out thinner and made with hot water. Potato Scones. ^lb. cold Potatoes. About 20zs. Flour. About £ g-ill sweet Milk. A pinch of salt. Mash the potatoes, add the salt, knead as much flour into them as they will take up, taking care not to allow the flour to go into lumps. Add as much milk as will form it into a stiff dough; roll out very thin on floured board; cut into rounds with tumbler or tin cutter, and prick with a fork. Bake in hot oven for about five minutes, turning when half cooked. Serve hot.

KING'S COLLEGE HOSPITAL TO SOUTH LONDON. 13 Stew all together, stirring often, for one hour. Have ready 2qts. peas, boiled in a gallon of water; pass them through a .sieve to the water they are boiled in, then put the lettuces to it, and stew it hours. When done take out the onions and put in it a sprig of mint before it is taken off the fire. It is best to do it in an earthen pot in the oven. Half the quantity is enough for one soup. Sept., 1836. Miss A. Hobill. Vegetable Soup (Brunoise). Take equal parts of carrots, turnips, onions and celery, cut them all in the shape of very small dice, put a good piece of butter in a saucepan with a little pepper and salt, and a teaspoonful of powdered lump sugar. Toss the carrots in this till they begin to take colour, then put in the celery, after a little time the onions, and then the turnips. When all the vege- tables are equally coloured add as much stock as you want soup, and set the saucepan by the side of the fire to simmer gently for two hours; then skim and serve. Miss Baxter.

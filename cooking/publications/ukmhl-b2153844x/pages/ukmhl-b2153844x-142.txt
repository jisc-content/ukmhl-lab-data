IN AID OF THE FUND FOR THE REMOVAL OF 122 Fig1 Pudding1 (2). Of luscious figs that Southern suns have dried, Take half a pound, in tiny squares divide; Of breadcrumbs, suet, sugar you shall weigh Six ounces each, and then shall make essay Two apples, with a critic’s eye to choose, Of flavour rich and free from speck and bruise. These also cut in squares. Of citron green Two ounces slice; and then with knife full keen A lemon’s rind chop into fragments small; Lastly four well beat eggs will leaven all. But stay, ere o’er the fire the whole you trust To boil four hours, throw in the merest dust Of grated nutmeg. When the pudding’s cooked A simple sauce should not be overlooked. Mrs. Beale.

KING’S COLLEGE HOSPITAL TO SOUTH LONDON. 219 Wafer Biscuits. Rub a piece of butter the size of a walnut into a handful of fine flour. Make it into a stiff, smooth paste, with warm milk, and the white of an egg beaten to a stiff froth. Beat the paste with a rolling pin for at least half an hour (the goodness of the biscuits depends on the length of time they are beaten). Take small pieces and roll them out to the size of a saucer. They must be so thin that they can be seen through when held to the light. Bake .them very lightly. Miss A. Hobill. Wine Biscuits. Mb. Butter. Mb. Sugar, ilb. Flour. 2 whole Eggs, or 4 yolks.

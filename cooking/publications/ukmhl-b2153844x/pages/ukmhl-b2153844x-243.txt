KING'S COLLEGE HOSPITAL TO SOUTH LONDON. 223 Orange Marmalade (3). Cut Seville oranges in halves and slice them very fine, taking out the pips only. To each pound of fruit add 3'pts. of cold water; let this stand for 24 hours, then boil till tender. Let it stand again for 24 hours and then weigh it, and to every pound of boiled fruit add ijjlbs. of sugar. Boil the whole for an hour or more (until the syrup jellies when dropped on a plate) and stir all the time after the sugar is added. Miss M. Perkin. Preserved Pears. Peel and quarter the pears, taking out the cores, then take equal weight of sugar to fruit, and to every 3lbs. of pears add ipt. of spring water; add cloves or sliced lemon, whichever is preferred (lemon is nicest). Put all in a large stewpan and put the skins which have been peeled off the pears on the top of the fruit, then cover closely and let them stew g'ently for five or six hours. You must be guided by the colour of the fruit; a little cochineal tied up in muslin improves the colour. The syrup will require boiling over again at the end of ro days. Pears when stewed according to this recipe will keep two years. Recipe 150 years old. Mrs. Tunnard. Raspberry Preserve. Equal quantities of raspberries and white sugar. Warm the sugar, squeeze the raspberries, or crush them thoroughly with a silver fork. Boil the fruit (done for seven minutes, then add the sugar, and just boil it up. F. Austin.

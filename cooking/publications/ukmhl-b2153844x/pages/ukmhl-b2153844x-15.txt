7 Mr. John Wood, Sir William Overend Priestley, Sir Alfred Garrod, Dr. W. S. Playfair, Lord Lister, and other great physicians and surgeons. Progress of tbe Appeal. At the time of going to press the appeal made to the public has realised £175,000, including the value of the site. The contract for the out-patient and casualty department is to be proceeded with almost at once, and the Committee appeals urgently for the remaining sum of £125,000. It must not be forgotten that the inhabitants of the district immediately adjacent to the new site are very poor, and such monetary help as they are able to give to the project can be but small. On the other hand, as patients from all parts of Great Britain are constantly under treatment in its wards, King’s College Hospital may fairly claim to be a national charity, and appeals for support to all generous benefactors through- out the country. As many donors desire their contributions to be earmarked, some for Hospital purposes, others for the Medical School, it it is now proposed to divide the Fund as follows:— FUND A.—For the Building of the New Hospital. FUND B. -For the Building and Endowment of the Medical School. FUND C.—To be applied at the discretion of the Committee to A or B. Subscribers are asked to specify to which Fund or Funds they desire their contributions to be paid. In the event of no such specification being made, it will be assumed that the donation is to go to Fund A.

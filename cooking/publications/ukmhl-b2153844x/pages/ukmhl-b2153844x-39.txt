KING'S COLLEGE HOSPITAL TO SOUTH LONDON. 23 Oyster Fritters. Drain the liquor from the oysters, and to a teacupful of this add the same quantity of milk, three eggs, a little salt, and flour enough for a thin batter. Have ready in the frying-pan a few spoonfuls of lard, heat very hot, and drop the oyster batter in by the table- spoonful. Fry a spoonful first to satisfy yourself that the lard is hot enough, and that the fritter is of the right size and consistency. Take rapidly from the pan as soon as they are done to a yellow brown, and send to table very hot. Some fry the oyster whole, enveloped in batter, one in each fritter. In this case the batter should be thicker than if chopped oysters were to be added. Miss Baxter. Oyster Kromeskies.

Take some remains of cold veal, chop it finely, add to it chopped ham, pepper, salt, and lemon peel to taste. Take about half as much crumb of bread as you have meat, soak it in milk and then squeeze it out. Add this to the meat. Melt i oz. of butter in a stewpan, and to it add the meat with 2 well- beaten eggs. Have ready rather high mould, grease it carefully and ornament it with slices of hard-boiled eggs and some strips of beetroot. Press the meat into it, tie it down with buttered paper and bake in the oven for half an hour. Turn out and serve with rich white sauce poured over. Chopped parsley or the yolk of an egg passed through a sieve can be used as a garnish. A. King. Veal Sausages.

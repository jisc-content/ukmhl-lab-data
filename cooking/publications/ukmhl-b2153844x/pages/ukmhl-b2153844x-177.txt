KING’S COLLEGE HOSPITAL TO SOUTH LONDON. 157 about foz. of gelatine which has been previously soaked and then boiled in about £pt. of water, and mix carefully; then add by degrees a spoonful or two of strawberry, raspberry, cherry, apricot, green- gage, and pineapple preserve, and a teaspoonful of each of any fruit syrups you may have, with a little vanilla essence. The preserves must be stirred in very carefully, so as to keep the fruit whole. When nearly cold pour into a wetted mould and stand in a cool place until wanted. Turn carefully out and cover with well-whipped cream that has been flavoured with vanilla and a little sugar. Original. H. C. Macaroon Cream. To i pint of cream put four or five crumbled maca- roons, the yolks of four eggs, well beaten, and a little lump sugar. Mix these well together; put on the fire in a copper pan, and stir till it is the thick- ness of a good custard. When cold pour it into the dish you intend sending it in to table; grate sugar thickly all over it, and brown it with a hot sala- mander. J. F. C. Meringues. Take ^lb. sifted sugar, 6 whites of eggs, whisk the whites until they are quite stiff, then with a spoon mix in the sugar lightly. Cut several bands of white paper, 2in. wide, and put on wood well seasoned; then put spoonfuls of the mixture, the size of an egg, a little apart, on the bands of the paper; dust the top with sifted sugar, and put the boards into a cool oven till the meringues dry and harden on the top. Then take them carefully off the board, scoop out the insides, and put back into oven to harden. Fill each half, when cool, with whipped cream, flavoured with vanilla essence; join two together and serve. Secret of a meringue is to dry, not to bake. Mrs. H. W. Price.

Cut off the crust from a stale bakerâ€™s loaf, spread the crumb with raspberry jam and set it in layers in a dish. Make a good thick custard and pour it over the bread and leave it to soak 12 hours, or more, before eating. It should not be baked or boiled or cooked in any way, because that would spoil it. You had better make plenty, as you will probably have a second helping. ^'RS- Iunnard. T36

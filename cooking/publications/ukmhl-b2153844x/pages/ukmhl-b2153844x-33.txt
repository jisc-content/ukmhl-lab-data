KINGâ€™S COLLEGE HOSPITAL TO SOUTH LONDON. Dublin Bay Prawns Casserole. Take five or six prawns out of the shells and put into a deep casserole case, and put the shells and feet and a fish bone into any saucepan with a small piece of onion and 2 peppercorns. Boil these well and strain the liquor, and with it make a good sauce with an ounce of butter and flour. Pass 2d. spawn through the sieve and put into the sauce; pour it over the prawns, and cook gently for about a quarter of an hour. Serve in the casserole. Filet de Sole a la Normande. Take rather large fillets of sole and beat them with a bat; season with salt, pepper, and a little lemon juice; have some potatoes cut about the size of a cork, and roll each piece of fish round, then tie up in a little band of buttered paper; place the fillets into a pan with a little fish stock, and cook for 15 minutes, and when cold remove the potatoes. Make a nice mayonnaise sauce, and have ready a lobster cut up in small pieces; mix a little of the sauce with the lobster, and farce the sole with it; allow this to get quite cold, then coat all over with the remainder of the sauce, and sprinkle a little coral from the lobster on the top, and a small piece of truffle. Serve on a border of aspic and garnish with shreds of cucumber in the centre. Lady Playfair. Fish Cakes.

3 PREFACE The compilers desire to convey their thanks to all those ladies who have so kindly furnished material for the production of this work. At the same time they take this opportunity of explaining that it was impossible to insert all the recipes received, partly owing to the restrictions of space, and partly because many of them were practically duplicates of recipes which appear in the book. With regard to the title, it must not be assumed that all the dishes contained in this work are comprised in the cuisine of King’s College Hospital, but the work may be said to justify its title inasmuch as all the contents have been contributed by friends of the institution. Many of the recipes are old family ones, which have never before been printed. Where a name appears at the foot of a recipe, it denotes the person by whom such recipe was sent in, and is not to be taken as an indication of authorship. As already stated on the cover the proceeds of the sale of this book, after paying expenses, will be devoted to the fund for the removal of King’s College Hospital to South London. Readers are therefore asked to recommend the work to their friends as widely as possible. The compilers trust that, as cookery books go, this one will be found to be no bad shillingsworth.

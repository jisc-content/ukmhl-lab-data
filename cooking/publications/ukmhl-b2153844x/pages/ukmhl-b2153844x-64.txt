Add pepper and salt and dip them into melted butter. Broil them over a clear fire on both sides, doing the cut side first; remove the skewers, have ready some maitre d’hdtcl butter, put a small piece in the hollow of each kidney, and serve very hot. Maitre d’Hotel Butter.—Beat butter up with chopped parsley, salt, pepper and a little lemon juice. Miss Baxter. Lobseouse. Cut cold meat (beef is the best) into small, square, thick pieces.

IN AID OF THE FUND FOE THE REMOVAL OF 176 Girdle Seones. 6ozs. Flour. 5 teaspoonful Baking- Powder. i teaspoonful Sugar. 20ZS. Currants. ioz. Dripping, or 20ZS. Butter. About i gill sweet Milk. Cleanse the currants, rub the dripping into the flour ' in a basin, lightly with the fingers; add the sugar, currants and baking powder; stir in as much milk as will make a stiff dough. Turn out dough on a floured board; knead lightly; roll out about half an inch thick; cut into small rounds with tumbler or tin cutter. Bake on hot girdle for about ten minutes, turning them when cooked on one side. When done, put them slanting against a plate to prevent them becoming sodden. Light Bread, Rolls or Buns. A basin that holds 2qts. three parts fill with flour, a pinch of salt, and i tablespoonful of yeast; pour over it ipt. of new milk—lukewarm. Stir it in with a wooden spoon, and leave it half an hour on the dresser in warm weather, rather nearer the fire in cold; then add 2ozs. butter, in a little flour, and knead all well together. Leave it half an hour after pouring it on the paste- board, and when it falls just roll it up again; then put it into tins, and set it in a warm closet with a basin of boiling water to cause a steam. When the bread (or rolls or buns) have risen so as quite to fill the tins (which will be in about half an hour) put them into the oven—they will be done in about io minutes. Buns require a little ground loaf sugar (about a teaspoonful) sprinkled in, and a few sultana raisins. Miss A. Hobili..

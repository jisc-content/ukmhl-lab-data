tN AID OF THE FUND FOR THE REMOVAL OF 62 Pickle for Beef op Tongues. 2 gallons Water. 2lbs. Bay Salt (or 5lbs. common Salt, but beef not so fine in flavour). 2lbs. coarse Sugar. 20zs. Saltpetre. 20zs. black Pepper (bruised or tied in muslin). Boil all together for 20 minutes; clear off the scum thoroughly as it rises. Pour the pickle into a deep earthen pan, and when it is quite cold lay in the meat, and take care that every part of it is per- fectly covered with the pickle. A moderate-sized round of beef will be fit for use in a fortnight. It should be turned occasionally in the pickle. The pickle will keep a long time if it is boiled up occa- sionally, and a little more salt added to it. Miss V. Merriman. Spiced Beef. ifb. Salt. 5OZ. Saltpetre. ^oz. Allspice, soz. black Pepper, gib. brown Sugar. Thoroughly mix and boil these ingredients in 2qts. of water and pour hot upon a piece of beef in a glazed jar: let it remain for a fortnight. It must be kept under the pickle with a weight. N.B.â€”The flank cut from the end of the sirloin is very suitable. After being boiled it should be pressed flat and glazed when cold. The pickle may be boiled up and used again. F. Austin. To Cure Hams (1). ilb. coarse Sugar, ilb. Salt, ioz. Bay Salt, ioz. black Pepper, ioz. Saltpetre. ioz. Juniper Berries (well bruised).

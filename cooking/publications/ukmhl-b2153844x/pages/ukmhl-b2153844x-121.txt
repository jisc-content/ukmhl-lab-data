KING’S COLLEGE HOSPITAL TO SOUTH LONDON. Welsh Rarebit. Make some slices of toast about a quarter of an inch thick, trim off the crusts, and spread them with butter. Slice very thinly some rich cheese (about £lb.) into a stewpan; add a small teaspoonful of flour of mustard, a little salt and cayenne, ioz. of butter, and pour over it a very little ale or porter; let it simmer until quite hot, pour it on the toast, and serve immediately. Miss Baxter.

Healthful Cookery 12 Cooking of Starchy Foods.— Substances in which starch predominates, need long cooking and high temperature in order so to change the starch as to render it easy of digestion. Starch passes through five stages in undergoing diges- tion. First, it is converted into amylodextrin, or soluble starch; second, erythrodextrin; third, achroodextrin; fourth, maltose; and fifth, levulose, or fruit-sugar. By cooking, it is possible to carry the starch through the first three stages. The last two changes are the result of digestive action. The preliminary digestive work done by cook- ing varies in degree with the method employed. The cooking in water of boiling temperature for a short period only, simply carries the starch through the first step of the digestive process by changing the raw starch, which is insoluble, into soluble starch, or amylodextrin. To secure a further con- version into erythrodextrin requires a prolonged cooking at or near the boiling temperature, or the application of a higher degree of heat, as by baking in an oven. The third stage of starch digestion is attained only in articles from which the moisture is already evaporated, by exposing such to the ac- tion of heat at a temperature of at least 320°, as in the browning of foods by toasting or rebaking.

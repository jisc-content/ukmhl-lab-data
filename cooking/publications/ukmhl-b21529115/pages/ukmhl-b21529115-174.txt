Healthful Cookery 172 Cream Salad Dressing.—Take one-half cup thick cream, one-third cup thin cream, three tablespoon- fuls sugar, one egg or the yolks of two. Put all in a double boiler, and cook as for a custard. When it is taken from the fire, add three tablespoonfuls of lemon juice and a little salt. *Sweet Salad Dressing.— Rub two rounded tablespoonfuls of Almond Butter smooth with two thirds of a cup of water; add two tablespoonfuls of sugar and one fourth of a teaspoonful of salt; cook as for Sour Dressing, and add two tablespoonfuls of lemon juice. When a yellow color is desired, with either the Sweet or Sour Dressing, have the beaten yolk of an egg in a bowl, and as you remove the dressing from the fire, pour it over the egg, a little at a time, stirring well at first. When the egg is used, a little less water and more lemon juice may be required. The dressing is especially pal- atable on apples, sliced fine, apples and celery, apples and very ripe bananas, strawberries and bananas, or pineapple and orange. The fruit will not turn dark if the dressing is put on as soon as it is sliced. *Sour Salad Dressing.— Rub two slightly rounded tablespoonfuls of Peanut or Almond But- ter smooth with two thirds of a cup of water

Sandwiches In the preparation of sandwiches, as in that of all other foods, good results depend upon good material to work with. If raised bread is the foun- dation, it should be well baked, of even texture, and at least one day old. Wafers, unfermented breads, and Granose Biscuits may be used for sandwiches when preferred. These should be rendered fresh and crisp by browning lightly in the oven before spreading. Very dainty sandwiches may be made from breads baked in round-shaped loaves or rolls. The butter, whether dairy or some one of the various nut butters, should be creamed and spread smoothly on the bread before the slices are cut from the loaf. These should preferably be cut thin, and after being spread, may be made into a variety of shapes, as oblongs, squares, triangles, etc. RECIPES *Salad Sandwiches.â€” 3 eggs, 1 tablespoonful thick cream, 2 teaspoonfuls lemon juice, salt, and chopped watercress.

Healthful Cookery 246 Almond Whipped Cream.—Reduce Almond But- ter to the consistency of cream, and pour slowly over the well-beaten white of an egg. Sweeten and flavor to suit the taste. For persons who can not use cow’s cream, this makes an excellent substitute for whipped cream. *Meltose Cream.— Beat the white of an egg to a stiff froth. Add three teaspoonfuls of Meltose, and beat until creamy. Take out about one third of this, and chop the yolk of the egg into the remainder. On the top lay the part taken out. Serve at once. Lemon Custard Sauce.— 1 quart rich milk, yolks of 6 eggs. Flavor with lemon, and sweeten to taste. Have the milk boiling, stir into it the eggs, and cook one- half minute. Stir all the time.

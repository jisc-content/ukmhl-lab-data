Healthful Cookery n Steaming.— Steaming, as its name implies, is cooking by hot vapor. For foods not needing the solvent powers of water, or for such as already contain a large amount of moisture, this method is preferable to boiling. The foods may be placed in a perforated utensil which admits of direct con- tact with the steam, or they may be cooked in a closed receptacle placed inside another vessel con- taining actively boiling water — a double boiler. Value of Different Methods of Cooking.—The superiority of these various methods as regards nutritive results, depends much upon the compo- sition of the food substance to be cooked. The effect of heat at different temperatures and of the length of exposure varies with the different food elements. Foods composed largely of albumin re- quire cooking at a low temperature, as albumin coagulates at i6o°, and the effect of heat as great as that of boiling water upon albumin is to harden, toughen, and render it leathery and indigestible in proportion to the period of exposure. Food articles containing considerable cellulose and fibrous material require the solvent aid of water, and are best cooked by boiling, stewing, or steaming.

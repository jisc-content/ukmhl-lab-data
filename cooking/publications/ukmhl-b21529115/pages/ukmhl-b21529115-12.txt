Healthful Cookery IO gas jet, or in other ways whereby the food ma- terial is brought in contact with the direct radiation of heat. This method is frequently approximated by what is termed “pan-broiling” the food being cooked on or in some heated utensil. Baking.— Moist foods may also be cooked by dry heat in some closed receptacle, as by baking in an oven. Only foods containing a considerable degree of moisture are adapted for cooking by this method. The hot, dry air which fills the oven is always thirsting for moisture, and will take from every moist substance to which it has access a quantity of water proportionate to its degree of heat. Foods containing but a small amount of moisture, unless protected in some manner from the action of the heated air, or in some way sup- plied with moisture during the cooking process, come from the oven dry, hard, and unpalatable. Boiling.— Food substances, both moist and dry, may be cooked in liquids at boiling temperature (2120). This method is termed boiling. Stewing.—The solvent property of liquids kept just a few degrees below boiling temperature (185°) is also employed for stewing foods. This process is necessarily more lengthy than ordinary boiling, but for many foods it is much superior.

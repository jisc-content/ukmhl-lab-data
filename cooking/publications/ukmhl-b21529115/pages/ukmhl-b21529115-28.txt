26 Healthful Cookery principles are involved in the production of bread from all kinds of wheat flour. Good material and good care are absolutely necessary to good bread. Flours and meals made from the entire grain of wheat ferment more readily than does ordinary white flour, and hence, without careful manage- ment, bread made from the former is more liable to become overfermented and sour. In making whole-wheat breads, use as short a course of fer- mentation as practicable, and let it proceed at a medium temperature. Knead the dough more thor- oughly than for white flour. Such breads require a hotter oven at first and a longer time for baking. From one to one and one- half hours are needed, according to the size of the loaf and the heat of the oven. Whole-wheat breads will be lighter if at least one-third white flour be employed. If the bread is made with a sponge, the white flour is best used for that purpose. The length of time the whole- wheat flour is undergoing fermentation will in this way be somewhat lessened, and thus the liability to become sour decreased. The use of butter or other fats in bread is un- desirable. Used in any considerable proportion, fat retards the action of the yeast, and dough contain-

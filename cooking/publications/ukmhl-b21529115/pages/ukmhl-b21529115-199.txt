Gruels and Liquid Foods 197 To the grape juice add the Malted Nuts and the Gluten rubbed smooth with the water. Add a pinch of salt, and cook two minutes. If a gruel is desired, thin with one-half cup of grape juice or water. Granose Gruel.— Moisten one-half cup of Gra- nose Flakes with one cup of hot water, press through a fine sieve, and add one-half cup of cream. Season with a little salt, and serve hot. *Toasted Corn Flakes Gruel.— Boil together for fifteen minutes one pint of water and one cup of Toasted Corn Flakes. When done, salt to taste, and serve hot. A little tomato or bean broth may be added. Almond Puree.—Mix Almond Butter with water to a thick cream, add salt to taste, and let it boil up over the fire. Serve at once. This is very del- icate and nourishing. *Hot Nut Milk.— Make Almond or other Nut Butters of the consistency of milk by the continued addition of water. Fleat to the boiling point, add a very little salt, and drink like hot milk. Many can take this who can not use cow’s milk. Granola or Granuto in this Nut Milk makes a very enjoyable breakfast dish. It is also excellent with Breakfast Toast, wafers, Zwieback, rolls, sticks, or any other hard breads.

A good rule to follow is to allow one egg and one tablespoonful of liquid (boiling water makes the more tender omelet) for each individual to be served. Beat the eggs, yolks and whites sep- arately; add the salt for seasoning, and the boiling water to the yolks; mingle thoroughly, then fold in the beaten whites so carefully that not an air-bubble is broken. Have the omelet-pan oiled and hot. Pour the eggs into it, and spread evenly. Heat slowly; and when puffed up and browned delicately on the bottom, fold in the middle, using a limber palette knife to turn it over. Test the omelet by touching it with the finger. When it feels dry in- stead of sticky to the touch, it is ready to turn. Serve on a hot dish. To Poach Eggs.— A shallow pan with water of a depth to completely cover the eggs, is the first requisite. The salt may be added to the water, which should be at just the boiling temperature, but not bubbling hard. Some oiled muffin-rings placed in the water, into each of which a carefully broken egg may be dropped, will insure a more shapely result. Let the eggs remain linger the water until 8

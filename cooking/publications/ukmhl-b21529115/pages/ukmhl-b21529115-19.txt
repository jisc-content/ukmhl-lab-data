Combining Ingredients i7 ways in which this is accomplished: stirring, beat- ing, kneading, cutting, and folding. Stirring.— By stirring is meant a continuous motion round and round with a spoon, without lifting it from the mixture except to scrape occa- sionally from the sides of the dish any portion of the materials that may cling to it. It is not alto- gether necessary that the stirring should be all in one direction, as some cooks suppose. The object of stirring is to thoroughly blend the ingredients, and this may be accomplished by stirring in one direction as well as in another. The blending of flour and water only can be more easily accom- plished, and the two more smoothly blended, with an egg-beater than with a spoon. Beating.— Beating is for the purpose of incor- porating as much air into the mixture as possible. It should be done by dipping the spoon in and out, cutting clear through and lifting from the bottom with each stroke so as to bring the under part to the surface. The process must be a continuous one, and must never be interspersed with any stirring if it is designed to retain the air within the mixture. Cutting and Folding.— Cutting and folding is a combination of two motions. The first, a vertical chopping or cutting through the mixture, com-

24 Healthful Cookery The liquid should never be so cold as to chill the yeast. Milk, if used, should be first sterilized by scalding, and then cooled before using. After the sponge is prepared, the greatest care must be taken to keep it at an equable temperature. From jo° to 90° F. is the best range of temperature, 750 being considered the golden mean throughout the entire fermentive process of bread-making. After fermentation has well begun, it will con- tinue, but much more slowly, if the temperature be gradually lowered to 45° or 50°. If it is neces- sary to hasten the rising, the temperature may be raised to 8o° or 85°, but this will necessitate care- ful watching, as the bread will be liable to over- ferment, and become sour. Cold arrests the process of fermentation, while too great heat carries for- ward the work too rapidly. Too much stress can not be laid upon the importance of an equable tem- perature. Lightness of Bread.— A thin batter is suffi- ciently light when it is effervescent, like yeast, throughout; a thicker batter, when risen to double its first bulk, and cracked over the top. The loaf is sufficiently light when it has doubled its first proportions, and feels light when lifted on the hand.

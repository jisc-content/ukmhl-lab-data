IOO Healthful Cookery Many can use Protose and rice who can not digest potatoes. Browned rice may be used in the same way. * Protose and Rice Cakes.—Take equal quantities of cold boiled rice and chopped Protose (left-over Protose and Rice Hash). Season to taste with salt, and celery, onion, or sage, as desired. Moisten sufficiently to shape into cakes with the hand, and broil on a slightly oiled griddle. Serve with or without sauce. *Protose and Rice Croquettes.— Steam one-half cup of well-washed rice in one cup of water, with one-fourth teaspoonful of salt, for one hour, or until tender. Add to this an equal bulk of dry stewed Protose, one egg, and salt to taste. Shape, and roll in fine bread-crumbs or Granola. Bake in a quick oven until they begin to crack, and are of a delicate brown. If desired, one tablespoonful of chopped parsley or celery may be added before shaping. Serve with egg sauce or with fruit or jelly. *Protose with Browned Rice.— Broil slices of Protose. Have ready a nut gravy, using browned flour to thicken. Put the broiled Protose into a pudding-dish, pour the gravy over it, and bake in the oven for half an hour or longer. Serve with a border of nicely browned rice.

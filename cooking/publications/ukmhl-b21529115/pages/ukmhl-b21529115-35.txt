Breads 33 very light, and bake. Roils prepared in this manner are termed “ Imperial Rolls,” and if the folding has been properly done, when well baked they will be composed of a succession of light layers, which can be readily separated. What are called “ French Rolls ” may be made by shaping each portion of dough into small oval rolls quite tapering at each end, allowing them to become light, and baking far enough apart so that one will not touch another. If, when the dough is light and ready to shape, it be rolled on the board until about one eighth of an inch in thickness, and cut into five-inch squares, then divided through the center into triangles, rolled up, beginning with the wide side, and placed in the pan to rise in semicircular shape, the rolls are called “ Crescents.” What are termed “ Parker House Rolls ” may be made from well-risen dough prepared with milk, rolled upon the board to a uniform thickness of about one-fourth inch; cut into round or oval shapes with a cutter; folded, one third over the other two thirds; allowed to rise until very light, and baked. The rolled dough may be folded into a “ Braid ” by cutting into strips six inches long and one wide, joining the ends of each three, and braiding. 3

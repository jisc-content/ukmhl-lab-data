38 Healthful Cookery The heat of the oven for baking should be suffi- cient to form a slight crust over all sides of the bread before the air escapes, but not sufficient to brown it within the first fifteen minutes. To aid in forming the crust on the sides and bottom, the iron cups should be heated before introducing the batter, except for bread in which egg is used. The degree of heat required for baking will be about the same as for fermented rolls and biscuit, and the fire should be so arranged as to keep a steady but not greatly increasing heat. The heat should be greatest at the bottom of the oven. One hour is the average length of time required for properly baking the batter breads. From forty minutes to one hour will be required for* most of the dough breads. Success is also dependent upon the dexterity with which the materials when ready are put to- gether. Batter bread often proves a failure, al- though the beating is kept up without cessation, because it is done slowly and carelessly, or inter- spersed with stirring, thus permitting the air to escape between the strokes. If the bread is to be baked at once, the greater the despatch with which it can be gotten into a properly heated oven the

Breads 23 ceeds more rapidly in a thin batter, it is quite cus- tomary to start the bread with such a batter of flour, liquid, and yeast, called a ferment, or sponge, to which, when light, an additional portion of flour and water is added. Some cooks use for this sponge the entire amount of liquid needed for the bread, adding flour as the batter grows light, first for a thicker batter, and later, when this is risen, suffi- cient to make a stiff dough. Others use only a portion of the liquid needed at first; and when the sponge is well risen, add both flour and liquid to make a fresh sponge, more flour being added to this, when light, to make the dough. Still other cooks dispense altogether with the sponge, adding to the liquid at the first sufficient flour to make it into a dough, allowing it to rise once in the mass, and again after it is molded into loaves. As to the superiority of one method over an- other, much depends upon their adaptability to the time and convenience of the user. Good, light bread may be produced by any of the methods. Less yeast but more time will be required by the first two methods.

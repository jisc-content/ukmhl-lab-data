IOI Flesh-Food Substitutes *Protose and Granose Croquettes.— Take one cup of slightly juicy stewed Protose, one egg, salt to taste, and just enough Granose Flakes to shape. Form into rolls, and bake in a quick oven until they begin to crack, and are of a delicate brown. They may be prepared and set in a cool place until time to bake them. Grape pulp or fruit jelly are agree- able sauces for them. *Protose Croquettes.— Chop one pound of Pro- tose moderately fine, add one teaspoonful of celery salt, two teaspoonfuls of onions, minced fine, and two teaspoonfuls of chopped parsley. Serve with the following sauce: Pleat four large tablespoonfuls of Nut Oil, without scorching; stir into this one cup of pastry flour, and add one quart of boiling water, stirring until smooth; add another cup of dry flour, stirring it in carefully. Remove from the fire, add one teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of celery salt, and two eggs. Stir this into the above mix- ture of Protose, and allow it to stand until cold. Shape into rolls about three inches long and one inch in diameter; roll them in fine Zwieback- crumbs, dip into beaten egg, and roll in crumbs again. Bake in a moderate oven for twenty min- utes, or until done. *Protose Croquettes, No. 2.—Mash Protose with

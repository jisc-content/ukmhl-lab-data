Vegetables 135 CAULIFLOWER AND CABBAGE Boiled Cauliflower.— Prepare, divide into neat branches, and tie securely in a net. Put into boil- ing milk and water, equal quantities, and cook until the main stalks are tender. Boil rapidly the first five minutes, afterwards more moderately, to pre- vent the flower from becoming done before the stalks. Serve on a hot dish with cream sauce or diluted lemon juice. Cauliflower with Egg Sauce.— 2 heads cauli- flower, 1 pint rich milk, 1 tablespoonful Gluten flour, 1 egg. Steam the cauliflower until tender, separate into small portions, dish, and serve with egg sauce, pre- pared by heating a pint of rich milk or very thin cream to boiling, and stirring into it a level table- spoonful of Gluten Flour rubbed smooth with a little cold milk. Let this boil a few minutes, stirring constantly until the flour is well cooked and the sauce thickened. Then add slowly the well-beaten yolk of one egg, stirring rapidly, so that it shall be well mingled with the whole. Add salt to taste, and let it boil up once. It should be the consistency of thick cream.

RECIPES POTATOES Baked Potatoes.â€” Choose large, smooth pota- toes as nearly the same size as possible; wash and scrub with a brush until perfectly clean; dry with a cloth, and bake in a moderately hot oven (the heat of which should at no time be so great that the hand can not be held therein while moderately counting twenty-five) until a fork will easily pierce them, or until they yield to pressure between the fingers. They should be turned about occasionally. In a slow oven the skins become hardened and thickened, and much of the most nutritious portion is wasted. When done, take up in a clean cloth, press each one till it bursts slightly, as that will allow the steam to escape, and prevent the potatoes from becoming soggy. They should be served at once, in a folded napkin placed in a hot dish. Cold baked potatoes may be warmed over by rebaking, if of good quality, and not overdone the first time.

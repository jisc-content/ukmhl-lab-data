183 Soups with Nut Soup Stock Nut Soup Stock may be used in precisely the same way as extract of beef and other concentrated soup stocks. It dissolves instantly in either hot or cold water. It is best to add the water slowly at first, beating it together with a Dover or Cyclone egg-beater until smooth, when the remainder of the water may be added. Where tomato is men- tioned, strained stewed tomato of ordinary con- sistency is intended. If it should be unusually thin, a little more will be required, and a little less if it is thicker. The herbs,1 for the soups that are to be strained, are loosely tied in a piece of cheese-cloth or thin muslin, so that the flavor will come out into the soup as the sack is occasionally pressed with a spoon. The bay leaves are thrown in without any preparation. The stalks of celery are crushed or broken. Onions are sliced, except when they are chopped and left in the soup. Carrots are grated. 1 The herbs mentioned are usually obtainable in dry or powdered form of most dealers ; but those raised in oneâ€™s own garden are superior in flaYor, and may be dried and kept for winter use.

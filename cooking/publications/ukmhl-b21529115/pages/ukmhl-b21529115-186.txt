Healthful Cookery 184 Nut Soup Stock will keep almost indefinitely after being opened, by keeping it exposed to the air in a dry place, and turning it over occasionally on to a clean plate. The browned flour used in the recipes is prepared as follows: — *Browned Flour.—Take any good spring-wheat flour, and put it into a warm (not hot) oven, stir it often, to prevent lumping, until it is dried out. Then increasing the heat of the oven, stir the flour more often, and bring it to the degree of brown- ness desired. Be sure to brown it evenly. Do not let even a small portion of it become burned, for that will give a bitter flavor to the whole. No. 1 is of a delicate cream color, so light that one can hardly tell that it is browned at all except by com- paring it with some that has not been in the oven. No. 2 is of a dark cream or light brown color. No. 3 is a light chestnut. It requires a very hot oven and constant watching and stirring for the last half hour to bring No. 3 to perfection. One will need to watch closely that it does not burn on the bottom of the pan as well as on the top. These browned flours will keep almost indefinitely in clean, dry recep- tacles. *Brown Onion Flavor.— 2 medium-sized onions, sliced thin, 2 tablespoonfuls Browned Flour No. 3.

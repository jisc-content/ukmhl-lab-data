150 Healthful Cookery apparent, it is sufficiently cooked. Green corn is said to be sweeter if boiled with the inner husks on. For cooking in this way, strip off all outer husks, and remove the silk, tying the inner husk around the ear with a bit of thread, and boil. Re- move from the kettle, place in a heated dish, cover with a napkin, and serve at once on the cob. Some recommend scoring or splitting the corn by draw- ing a sharp knife through each row lengthwise. This is a wise precaution against insufficient mas- tication. Stewed Com Pulp.—Take six ears of green corn, or enough to make a pint of raw pulp; with a sharp knife cut a thin shaving from each row of kernels, or score each kernel, and with the back of the knife scrape out the pulp, taking care to leave the hulls on the cob. Heat a cup and a half of rich milk (part cream if preferable) to boiling, add the corn, cook twenty or thirty minutes; season with salt and a teaspoonful of sugar if desired. Nuttolene and Corn.— Place alternate layers of stewed or canned sweet corn and dice of Nuttolene in a pudding-dish. Cover, and place in a moderate oven until just heated through. Serve at once. This combination of Nuttolene and corn is most pleasing.

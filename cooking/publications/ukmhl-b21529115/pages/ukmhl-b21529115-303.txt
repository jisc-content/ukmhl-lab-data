Carolina Oklahoma Tennessee Texas On orders for $5.00 or more to this territory, a part of the ex- press is paid, the customer in this case being asked to add to his remittance one-sixth more than the value of the foods he orders. On a five-dollar order this is 83 cents; on a six-dollar order, ex- actly $1.00. This, of course, covers only a part of the express charges — we pay the balance. To Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado, freight is paid on $15.00 shipments. To all other States in the Union, on $20.00 orders. It costs something to supply individual customers in this way, but the results are well worth the expenditure. If your grocer sells our foods, buy them of him; if not, WE WILL BE PLEASED TO SUPPLY YOU DIRECT FROM FACTORY. If you are not already acquainted with Sanitarium Foods, write us for information about our Special Introductory Offer. It will pay you.

19 Breads The aim in bread-making should be to produce an article rich in nutritive elements, palatable, and easily digestible. The essential requisites for the production of good bread are good materials, prop- erly combined, together with careful management during the processes by which they are converted into the well-baked loaf. Bread is generally made of wheat flour and liquid, formed into a dough, and charged with some gas to distend it, or, as we say, to make it light, after which it is baked. Wheat flour is ordinarily used in preference to that of other grains, because, aside from the fact that wheat contains the most correct proportion of food elements, its gluten is in character different from and in quantity greater than that found in most other grains, and is, for these reasons, better adapted to the preparation of light bread. It is the gluten of the flour which, because of its tenacious properties, makes it pos- sible to stretch and distend the dough by the aid of some gas into a porous loaf. Even flours from different kinds of wheat vary in the amount and quality of gluten they contain. Flour made from

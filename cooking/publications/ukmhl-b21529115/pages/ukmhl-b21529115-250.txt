Healthful Cookery 248 articles of diet of which they could partake. Scru- pulous neatness and care in all the minute particu- lars of the cooking and serving of foods for the sick will help much in making it appetizing and digest- ible. Dainty dishes, polished glass and silver, with clean napery, should always be accessories of the invalidâ€™s tray. Such a large proportion of the dishes for which recipes are given in this little book are of a char- acter suited to the needs of the sick, as well as of those in health, that it is hardly necessary to append special directions for the preparation of invalid foods. In fevers, where the simplest nourishment is demanded, fruit juices are the most appropriate of all foods. It is now well recognized that beef tea and meat broths should be wholly discarded in cases of fever, as the patient is already suffer- ing from the accumulation of waste matter in the system to such an extent that even the small addi- tional amount obtained from beef tea may lessen his prospects of recovery. When other foods than fruit juices are allowable, fruit soups, fruit jellies, prepared with Sanitas Vegetable Gelatine, fruit egg-nog, fruit gruels, Gluten and Granose gruels, will afford a variety for much choice.

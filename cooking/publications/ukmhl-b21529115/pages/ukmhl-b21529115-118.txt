Healthful Cookery 116 -* Gluten Meal Custard.—• Beat together thor- oughly one pint of rich milk, one egg, and four tablespoonfuls of Gluten Meal. Add a little salt, if desired, and cook with the dish set in another con- taining boiling water, until the custard has set. Or, turn the custard into cups, place in a dripping-pan partly filled with hot water, and cook in a moderate oven until the custard is set. Potato Meal Omelet.— Prepare a Potato Meal Puree, as directed on page 180. To one cup of the puree, which should be quite stiff, add three well-beaten eggs. Turn into cups or timbale molds, and steam until the egg is well set. Serve plain or with a tomato sauce. Gluten Custard.— Into a pint of boiling milk stir two tablespoonfuls of 20-per-cent Gluten mois- tened with a little cold milk. Allow it to cook until thickened. When it is lukewarm, add two well- beaten eggs, and a trifle of salt, if desired. Turn into cups, and steam over a kettle of boiling water until the custard is set. *Granuto Omelet.— 4 eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls water, 4 tablespoonfuls Granuto, and salt. Beat all together with the regulation twelve strokes, and cook in an omelet-pan the same as plain omelet. Serve at once.

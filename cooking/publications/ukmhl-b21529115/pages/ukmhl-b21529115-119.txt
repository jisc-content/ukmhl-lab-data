117 Eggs *Gluten Olive Omelet.â€” For the omelet use one tablespoonful each of 20-per-cent Gluten and ice- water to every two eggs (a little more salt will be required than for a plain egg omelet). Serve with ripe olives alone, or with olives in tomato sauce or with cream sauce. For the tomato sauce, heat in strained stewed tomato (until the tomato is some- what thickened), ripe olives cut in halves. The tomato will require very little, if any, salt with the salted olives. The halves of olives may be laid around the upper edge of the omelet after it is folded, or on the platter in the sauce; or the olives may be left whole, and the sauce alone poured around the omelet.

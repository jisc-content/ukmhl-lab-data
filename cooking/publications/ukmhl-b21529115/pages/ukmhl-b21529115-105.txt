Flesh-Food Substitutes 103 sliced fine, for the rice, in Protose and Rice Hash; use no water; just heat through, but do not cook the apples. *Protcse and Potato Hash.— Cook potatoes in their jackets until tender. When cold, peel, and chop moderately coarse, or cut into one-third-inch dice. Cut Protose into one-third-inch dice. Have two parts of potato to one part of Protose, and one slice of onion chopped very fine to each. Put a little Nut Cream (made by mixing Nuttolene with water), into a stew-pan. Add the above ingre- dients, which have been well mixed together. Add salt to taste. Cover closely, and let it heat gently until a delicate brown crust is formed at the bot- tom, then turn, and stir carefully, and set where it will keep hot, but not scorch. Cold baked potatoes make very good hash, and those left over from meals may be used. Chopped celery, celery salt, or any of the sweet herbs powdered fine may be sub- stituted for the onion. *Lentil and Nut Loaf.— Take one pint of well- cooked lentil pulp, one cup of strained stewed to- mato, one and one-half cups of walnut meal, a very little pulverized sage, and enough Granola or crushed Zwieback, probably one cup, to make quite a stiff mixture. Bake for forty minutes in a mod- erate oven.

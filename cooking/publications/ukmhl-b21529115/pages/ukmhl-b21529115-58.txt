56 Healthful Cookery eggs; season with salt and powdered sage. Spread between buttered slices of white or whole-wheat bread. *Protose and Jelly Sandwiches.— Spread thin slices of bread with nice tart fruit jelly, then spread one of every two with a layer of minced Protose salted to taste. A different effect may be pro- duced by mixing a little powdered sage or savory with the protose. Parsley leaves, placed around the edges of one slice of bread before laying the two together add much to the effect. When all prepared, the sandwiches may be cut with a thin, sharp knife, into triangles or squares. Since the crust is the sweetest and most wholesome part of the bread, do not sacrifice it. Diploma Sandwiches.— Make these of well- baked linger rolls, fermented or unfermented, as preferred. Divide into halves lengthwise. Remove a portion of the inner crumbs, and spread with a mixture of seasoned mayonnaise, or the Boiled Salad Dressing (page 173), and minced Protose, or, if preferred, hard-boiled egg which has been rendered homogeneous by pressing through a sieve. Place small, crisp lettuce leaves between the halves, put together, and serve piled on large leaves of lettuce.

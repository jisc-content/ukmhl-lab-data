Salads 175 one-half teaspoonful of common salt, one-third cup of lemon juice. Beat well together, and cook in a double boiler over the fire, stirring constantly until it thickens, then remove from the fire, and beat until cold. *Sunflower Mayonnaise.— Press the yolks and whites of hard-boiled eggs separately through a wire strainer. Pile the yolks in the center of a salad-plate, placing the whites in a circle outside of it. Around this arrange shredded lettuce, piled lightly, and serve with a mayonnaise dressing. Two eggs for each three plates of salad will be sufficient. *French Dressing.— Boil together one-half cup of lemon juice, one-fourth cup of sugar, and a pinch of salt. Turn this slowly over one egg that is beaten separately, and then fold together.

Desserts 223 Fig Pulp.— Wash figs well by pouring boiling water over them. Drain, and grind fine through a food-cutter. *Date Pulp.—Wash dates, and stew them for a few minutes in a little water until the water has all cooked away, and rub them through a fine col- ander. The pulp may be dried in the oven after being prepared, if desired. When used alone as hard sauce for molds or puddings, a very little salt improves it. Raisin Pulp.—Wash seeded raisins, and stew until tender and well dried out. Rub through a fine colander. *Baked Banana.— Roll peeled bananas in fruit juice, then in Zwieback-crumbs. Sprinkle Malted Nuts on top, and bake until slightly browned. *Granuto and Baked Banana.— Grind Granuto moderately fine, add a pinch of salt, and roll in it peeled bananas until thoroughly covered. Lay the bananas in a granite basin, cover with strawberry juice, and bake until the juice is almost cooked away. Baste with the juice while cooking. Serve a little of the thick syrup on each banana. *Baked Banana with Cranberry Sauce.— Peel bananas, and roll them in lemon juice, sugar, and Granose Flakes. Bake until tender, and serve with any desired sauce. s

Unfermented, or Aerated, Bread 47 a bread-board, which has been dredged with flour. Continue this until the flour is all used up, and if necessary use more cream. With the hands press the particles of dough together, and knead carefully, taking pains to stretch the dough to make the gluten elastic, and fold in air with which to make them light. When the dough snaps well in pulling it apart, it is ready to roll. Roll about one third of an inch thick, and cut into sticks one third of an inch wide and the length of a silver knife handle. Bake in a perforated tin for about twenty or thirty minutes in a moderate oven. The sticks should be thoroughly dried out and brown when done. Nut Gluten Rolls.â€” Make a thin cream by dilu- ting Nut Butter with water until it is of the consist- ency of very thin cream. Sift a pint and a half of 40-per-cent Gluten Flour into a bowl, and into this stir one cup of the Nut Cream. Pour the liquid into the flour, a few spoonfuls at a time, mixing each spoonful to a dough with the flour as soon as it is poured in. When all the liquid has been added, gather the fragments of dough together, knead thor- oughly for ten minutes or longer, until perfectly smooth and elastic. The cream should be ice cold, and it is best to mix the dough in a cold place.

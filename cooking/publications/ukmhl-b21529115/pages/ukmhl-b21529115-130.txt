128 Healthful Cookery Old potatoes with shriveled skins are better pared before baking. Boiled Potatoes (without Skins).— Pare very thin, and wash clean. If not of an equal size, cut the larger potatoes in two. Cook in only sufficient water to prevent burning, until a fork will easily pierce their center; drain thoroughly, place the kettle back on the range, allow most of the steam to escape before covering them, leave a small aper- ture for the escaping steam, and let them dry four or five minutes. Shake the kettle several times while they are drying, to make them floury. Steamed Potatoes.—• Potatoes may be steamed either with or without the skin. Only mature po- tatoes should be steamed. Prepare as for boiling; place in a steamer over boiling water, and steam until tender. If water is needed to replenish, let it be boiling hot, and do not allow the potatoes to stop steaming, or they will be watery. When done, uncover, remove the potatoes to the oven, and let them dry a few minutes. If peeled before steam- ing, shake the steamer occasionally, to make them floury. Potatoes Stewed with Celery.— i quart sliced potato, 3 tablespoonfuls minced celery, milk to cover.

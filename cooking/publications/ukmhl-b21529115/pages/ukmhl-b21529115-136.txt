134 Healthful Cookery ^Vegetarian Boiled Dinner.— Scrape carrots, and slice into lengths. Pare and cut turnips into sec- tions' about one inch in the thickest part. Cook these in a salted broth made by using one fourth of a pound of Nuttolene which has been rubbed through a fine colander or put through a vegetable press, one tablespoonful of Nut Butter, and three pints of water. When about half done, add po- tatoes cut in halves or quarters. In the meantime have some cabbage, cut into two-inch sections, cooking in a cloth in boiling salted water. Have some small slices of Protose baking in water con- taining a little tomato juice thickened with flour to the consistency of thin cream. Serve on individual platters with a slice of Protose and some of each kind of vegetable and a slice of red beet which has been just heated through in salted lemon juice. Garnish with a sprig of parsley or a lettuce leaf. *Sweet Potato Cutlets.— Slice cold sweet po- tatoes which have been steamed or baked; dip each slice into beaten salted egg, then into Granola or toasted bread-crumbs, and bake on an oiled tin in a hot oven until browned.

112 Eggs The composition of eggs being largely albumen, from the point of digestibility requires that they be cooked at a lower temperature, and subjected to heat for a shorter period than starch foods. Eggs may be prepared in a variety of whole- some ways,— poached, boiled, steamed, but never fried,— and combined with other foods to form many palatable dishes. Used in connection with such starch foods as rice and potato, they form a well-balanced dietary. In breaking eggs, drop each separately into a dish. When it is thus ascertained that each is a perfect and healthy egg, it may then be turned into the dish with others. If to be used for omelets, unfermented breads, or cake, the white and yolk should be separated, and each by itself well beaten, the yolks until thick and lighter in color, the whites until perfectly stiff and flaky. The success of these articles depends upon the amount of air incorporated by the careful beating of the eggs, the viscous nature of the whites making it possible to catch and retain the air for some time.

21 Breads will retain its shape. Poor flour works soft and sticky when kneaded. Water and milk are the liquids generally used for bread-making, and the usual method of charg- ing the dough with gas is by fermentation through the use of yeast. Yeast.â€”The most convenient yeast is that sold as compressed yeast, made from pure yeast-cul- ture, to which is added a proportion of starch be- fore compression, to add to its keeping qualities. When fresh, this yeast is exceedingly strong, and vigorous in action. The use of too much, how- ever, is more likely to produce over-fermentation than yeast of other kinds. Many housekeepers prefer to manufacture yeast for themselves. Essentially the same principle is involved in their production; viz., the introduction of a small quantity of fresh, lively yeast into some mixture of starch and water, with or without the addition of such other substances as will promote fermentation or aid in preventing the yeast from souring. The starch may be obtained from po- tatoes or flour, or from a combination of both. If no seed-yeast is obtainable, such may be se- cured by covering a cup of raisins with water, and keeping it in a warm place until fermentation takes

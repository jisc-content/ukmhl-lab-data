Flesh-Food Substitutes 9i *Protose and Nuttolene in Shells.— Take two- thirds Protose and one-third Nuttolene, mince all fine with a fork (or grind through a food-cutter), and mix well together. It may then be made into cakes with the hands, or put into a pastry-bag with a star-shaped tube with large spaces, and pressed into the shells. Turn over the cakes the liquid from the can of Protose, flavored with celery salt, grated onions, or some of the herbs, or not flavored at all, as preferred. Place them on the top grate of a hot oven, or under a gas blaze, if not too hot. Just heat them through, and serve at once. They re- quire no sauce, but a teaspoonful of jelly on one side of the shell is very nice served with them. They may be served on a folded napkin or a plate, or from the chop-tray. Leaves of parsley may be used as a garnish. Crust Patties.— Beat until light the yolks of six eggs with four tablespoonfuls of ice-water and a half teaspoonful of salt. Add sufficient flour to make a dough stiff enough to knead. Knead well for a few minutes, and roll to about the thinness of a knifeblade.

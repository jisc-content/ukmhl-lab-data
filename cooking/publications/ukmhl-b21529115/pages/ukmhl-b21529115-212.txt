Healthful Cookery 210 PIES —RECIPES Granola Pie Crust.— 24 CUPS Granola, 24 to 1/3 cupful cream. For one pie take two thirds of a cup of Granola, moisten with an equal quantity of thin cream or rich milk, and let it stand a minute. A cream pre- pared by diluting Almond Butter with water to the consistency of cream is excellent for this purpose. Place the moistened mass in the center of the pie- tin, and with a spoon spread it evenly and thinly 1 over the bottom and round the sides of the tin, leav- ing no holes. Fill with any preferred filling, and bake ten or fifteen minutes. To form the edge nicely, rest the length of the first finger of the left hand against the edge of the tin, and press the ma- terial against it. The shaping of the crust will re- quire but a few moments, and should be done as soon as the Granola is well moistened, as it absorbs the liquid, and soon becomes dry again. Nut Meal Pie Crust.— Blend together thor- oughly equal parts of Nut Meal and good white flour. Make into a dough with ice-cold water, kneading it the very least possible. Cocoanut Pie.— 1 pint milk, p2 cup cocoanut, 24 cup sugar, 2 eggs.

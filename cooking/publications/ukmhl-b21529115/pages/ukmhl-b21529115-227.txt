Desserts 225 Sugar may be omitted, and Malted Nuts used in- stead. Fill the shells, and serve on a dish garnished with any appropriate leaves, such as lettuce, grape- leaves, or pineapple-tops. Baked Apples with Meltose.— Bake some equal- sized Northern Spies or other tart apples until tender. Serve hot or cold in individual dishes, with Meltose prepared in the following manner: Whip a cupful of Meltose with an egg-whip until white and creamy, then add two or three drops of vanilla extract, and pour over the apples as dressing. * Apple Snow.— To the whites of three eggs, beaten stiff, add three teaspoonfuls of powdered sugar and the grated pulp of three large apples. Beat until stiff. Serve in glasses with a candied cherry in each glass. Grape Apple.— Peel medium-sized apples, re- moving the core. Place in a baking-dish in rows, fill the cavity where the core has been removed with sugar, and pour grape juice over the apples to cover one third of the apple, place in oven, and bake until nicely colored. Cranberry or other fruit apples are made the same, using the different juices. Citron, chopped fine, or grated lemon-rind with sugar may be used to fill the center of the fruit, which may then be baked until tender. 15

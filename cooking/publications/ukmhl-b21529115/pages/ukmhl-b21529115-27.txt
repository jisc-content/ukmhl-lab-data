25 Breads Temperature for Baking.—Without an oven thermometer there is no accurate means of deter- mining the exact temperature of the oven; but housekeepers resort to various means to form a judgment about it. The baker’s old-fashioned way is to throw a handful of flour on the oven bottom. If it blackens without igniting, the heat is deemed sufficient. A common way of ascertaining if the heat in the oven is sufficient, is to hold the bare arm inside for a few seconds. If the arm can not be held within while thirty is counted, it is too hot to begin with. The following test, however, is more accurate: For rolls, the oven should be hot enough to brown a teaspoonful of flour in one min- ute, and for loaves in five minutes. The fire should be of sufficient strength to keep up the heat for an hour. The heat should increase for the first fifteen minutes, and remain steady for the next fifteen minutes, and may then gradually decrease during the remainder of the baking. The common test for well-baked bread is to tap the bottom with the finger; if it is light and well done, it will sound hollow, while heavy bread will have a dull sound. A thoroughly baked loaf will not burn the hand when lifted upon it from the pan. Whole-Wheat Breads.— Essentially the same

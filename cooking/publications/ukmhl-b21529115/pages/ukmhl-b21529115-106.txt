104 Healthful Cookery *Savory Nut Loaf.—Take two cups of browned Zwieback or Granola and one cup of walnut, pecan, or hickory-nut meal. Add one-half teaspoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of any preferred herb, as pul- verized sage, mint, or celery salt. Mix these ingre- dients thoroughly, and cover with rather thin Nut Cream, or, if preferred, boiling water may be used. Allow the mixture tb stand for a few moments (if Granola is used, the moisture will cause it to swell), then add enough more hot water to make the whole quite moist. Turn into a bread-tin, and bake in a 1 moderate oven for an hour. It may be served hot, with or without a nut dressing, or tomato sauce. It is also excellent served cold in slices, with a gar- nish of lemon, sliced thin, or with lettuce. *Nuts with Lentils.— Use three pints of strained cooked lentils and one pint of stewed tomato; sea- son to taste with Nut Butter and salt, and bake. If desired, an onion may be cooked with the lentils to flavor. Pease Patties.— Cook a quart of dried Scotch peas very slowly, until perfectly tender, allowing them to simmer very gently toward the last, until they become as dry as possible. Put them through a colander to remove all skins. Season with a teaspoonful of salt and a half cup of Nut Cream.

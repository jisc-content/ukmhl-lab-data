Use a porcelain or granite-ware kettle, with one- half pint of boiling water for each quart of peas, if young and tender; older ones, which require longer stewing, need more. Cover closely, and simmer gently till tender. The time required for young peas is from twenty-five to thirty minutes; older ones require from forty to fifty minutes. Serve without draining, season with salt and enough sweet cream to make them as juicy as desired. Nut Cream may be used instead of dairy cream. If pre- ferred, the peas may be stewed in a larger quan- tity of water, and served in their own juices thick- ened with a little flour and seasoned with salt. *Timbale of Granuto with Green Peas.— Cook Granuto porridge a little longer than to serve with- out molding.

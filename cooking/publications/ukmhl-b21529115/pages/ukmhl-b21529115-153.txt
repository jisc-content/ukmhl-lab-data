Vegetables 151 Stewed Nuttolene or Protose and Sweet Corn.— Heat canned corn in water, and salt to taste. Thicken a very little, and drop in strips or dice of Nuttolene or Protose. Heat through, and serve at once. Stewed Green Corn.— Cut the corn from the cob, and with the back of the knife scrape out all the pulp, being careful to leave the hulls on the cob. Put into a stew-pan with half as much water as corn, cover closely, and stew gently until thor- oughly cooked, stirring frequently to prevent the corn from sticking to the pan; add cream or milk, or Cocoanut Cream, to make the requisite amount of juice, and season with salt if desired. A tea- spoonful of white sugar made be added. Cold boiled corn cut from the cob and stewed a few minutes in a little milk makes a very palatable dish. Summer Succotash.— This may be made by cooking separately until tender equal quantities of shelled beans and corn cut from the cob, and then mixing them; or the beans may be cooked until nearly soft, an equal quantity of shaved corn added, and the whole cooked fifteen or twenty minutes or longer. Season with cream or Nut Cream, and salt if desired.

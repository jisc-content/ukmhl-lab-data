67 Vegetable Substitutes for Flesh Foods The dietetic value of meats, milk, and other ani- mal foods consists principally in the nitrogenous and fatty food elements with which they supply the system. These important food elements are essential to life and health, and if, for any reason, the use of animal foods wholly or in part is dis- carded, there must be made a substitution of the same elements secured from other sources, else the diet will become an impoverished one. While many food substances contain a proportion of one or both of these elements, the chief source of supply, aside from animal foods, is nuts and leguminous seeds. In leguminous seeds, when mature, we find a higher proportion of nitrogenous material than in any other foods, either animal or vegetable, as is shown by the accompanying tables of analyses. For this reason they are well adapted as substitutes for flesh foods, and for use in association with articles in which starch or other non-nitrogenous nutrients are the predominating principle; as. for example,

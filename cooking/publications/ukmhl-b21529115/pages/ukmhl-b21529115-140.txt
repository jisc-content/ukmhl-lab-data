Healthful Cookery 138 is spoiled. An excellent precaution, in order to keep them from scorching in case the water be- comes low, is to place an inverted saucer in the bot- tom of the kettle before putting in the turnips. Put into boiling water, cook rapidly until sufficiently tender to be pierced easily with a fork; too much cooking discolors and renders them strong in flavor. Boiled turnips should be drained very thoroughly, and all water pressed out before preparing for the table. The age, size, and variety of the turnip will greatly vary the time necessary for its cooking. The safest rule is to allow plenty of time, and test with a fork. Young turnips will cook in about forty-five minutes; old turnips, sliced, require from one and a quarter to two hours. If whole or cut in halves, they require a proportionate length of time. White turnips require much less cooking than yellow ones. Chopped Turnips.—■ Chop well-boiled turnips very fine, add salt to taste, and sufficient lemon juice to moisten. Turn into a saucepan, and heat till hot, gently lifting and stirring constantly. Cold boiled turnip may be advantageously used in this way.

14 Healthful Cookery very convenient utensil with which a half and a fourth of a teaspoonful may be measured, is obtain- able. Unless otherwise stated, a cupful, tablespoonful, or teaspoonful of either liquid or dry material means the utensil filled to the brim, level over the top. In the measuring of flour, sugar, or other dry materials, the exact amount is obtained by leveling the top with a knife. Any material like flour, sugar, salt, that has been packed, should first either be sifted or stirred up lightly, and should not be packed down in meas- uring. A rounded spoonful is one which above the edge of the spoon presents the same convex ap- pearance that the level spoonful would if turned bottom upward; in short, when fully rounded it is twice the proportion of a level spoonful. A heap- ing spoonful is all that can be lifted on the spoon without falling off. Such measurements are likely to be less accurate than the level measure, and are less commonly used. With liquids, it is always desirable to hold a cup in a saucer and a spoon over a dish while measuring, to prevent spilling the liquid upon the floor or table.

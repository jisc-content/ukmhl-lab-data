Desserts 209 quart of fresh, selected berries, sugar, and the rest of the tapioca. Fill the dish with cold water until the tapioca is covered about a quarter of an inch deep. Bake in a moderate oven until it looks clear, adding more water (hot) if it seems too dry. When done, let it get thoroughly cold, and serve it with a whipped cream or a fruit dressing. If fresh berries can not be had, use canned fruit, as cherries or plums, first draining off the juice, which can be diluted, then thickened with a little corn-starch and used instead of the whipped cream, if preferred. ^'Chocolate Blanc-Mange.—1 pint milk or cream, 2 tablespoonfuls corn-starch, 3 tablespoonfuls sugar, 3 tablespoonfuls Health Cocoa. Heat the milk, sugar, and Cocoa. Then add the corn-starch, or potato flour, if preferred. Cook thoroughly. Mold in cups if so desired. Serve with whipped cream. *Snowballs with Prunes.— Steam rice one hour, or until tender, and form into balls around one large or two small prunes in the center. Serve with a hot sauce made by warming for a few minutes one- half cup of Meltose to which the juice of one lemon has been added and a little prune juice to make it of the consistency to pour easily. 14

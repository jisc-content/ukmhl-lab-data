Season with salt, and add, or not, as preferred, a half cup of hot cream. Serve on slices of mois- tened Zwieback. Sunshine Toast.— Select good ripe tomatoes, cook thoroughly, sift through a fine colander to re- move the skins and seeds. To one pint of sifted tomato add one spoonful of white flour, a pinch of salt, the same of thyme, and a little Cocoanut Butter, if desired. Cook a few minutes, and serve hot over moistened Zwieback. Fruit Toast.—• Cook sweet California prunes, nicely dried apricots or peaches, allowing them to simmer very slowly for a long time until the fruit is well done, and the liquor thick and rich. When done, rub the fruit through a colander. If the pulp thus obtained is thin, stew again for a time until about the consistency of marmalade. Serve on slices of Zwieback moistened in cream, as directed.

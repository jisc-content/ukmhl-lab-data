37 Unfermented, or Aerated, Bread Unfermented breads made light by the introduc- tion of air are of two kinds, batter breads and dough breads. Air is introduced into the former by brisk and continuous agitating or beating of the batter; into the latter, by a thorough and continuous kneading, chopping, or pounding of the dough. All materials used for making these breads should be of the very best quality. All breads, whether fermented or unfermented, are lighter if baked in some small form, and this is particularly true of unfermented breads made light with air. For this reason, breads made into a dough are better baked in the form of rolls, bis- cuits, or crackers, and batter breads in small iron cups. It is especially essential in making aerated breads that everything be in readiness before be- ginning to put the bread together. All the ma- terials should be measured out, the utensils to be used close at hand, and the oven properly heated.

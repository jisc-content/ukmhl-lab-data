Healthful Cookery . 222 Bake sufficient sweet potatoes to make a pint of pulp when rubbed through a colander; add a pint of rich milk, a scant cup of sugar, salt if de- sired, the yolks of two eggs, and a little grated lemon rind for flavor. Bake with under crust When done, meringue with the white of the eggs beaten up with a tablespoonful of sugar. Simple Custard Pie.— I pint milk, 2 eggs, 1/3 cup sugar. Beat the eggs with one third of a cup of sugar, and a little grated lemon rind for flavoring, and one pint of milk. Bake in an under crust. If eggs are scarce, a very good pie may be made by using only one egg and a tablespoonful of corn- starch, with the above proportions of milk and sugar; in which case, heat the milk to scalding, stir in the corn-starch, and cook till thickened; cool, and then add the well-beaten egg. If preferred., the crust may be baked before filling, and the cus- tard steamed meanwhile. FRUIT DESSERTS A Palatable Dessert.— Place a cluster of raisins on one side of a fruit-plate, and a teaspoonful or two of Almond Meal on the other, to be eaten to- gether.

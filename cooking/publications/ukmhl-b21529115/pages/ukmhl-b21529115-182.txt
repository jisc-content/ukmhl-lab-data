1B0 Healthful Cookery Celery and Tomato Soup.— il/2 cups stewed to- mato and *4 cup celery, sliced fine. Cook together until the celery is tender. Rub all through a colander, season with salt, and serve; or if preferred, thicken with a little 40-per-cent Gluten or Potato Meal. Potato Meal Puree.— Into one pint of boil- t ing water stir two tablespoonfuls of Cocoanut Cream and three heaping tablespoonfuls of Potato Meal which has previously been braided with enough cold water (about three fourths of a pint will be needed) so that it will pour readily. If liked, the Meal may be braided with thin, strained stewed tomato instead of water. Savory Potato Meal Puree.— Prepare the same as in the preceding, having first steeped in the water for three minutes three stalks of celery cut in one-inch pieces, or one small onion, or if preferred, one half as much of both. Remove the pieces of onion with the fork before stirring in the Meal. *Protose Soup.— *4 pound mashed Protose, 1 can tomatoes, 1 large onion, 2 or 3 stalks celery or a little celery salt, and 1 quart water. Cook all together about two hours, and strain through a colander before serving. The addition of a little flour thickening makes the soup smoother.

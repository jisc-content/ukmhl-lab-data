224 Healthful Cookery Sliced Bananas with Meltose.—Whip a cup of Meltose with an egg-whip until white and creamy, then add one or two drops of vanilla extract, or lemon juice if preferred, and serve over sliced bananas. ^Strawberry Banana Dessert.— Take a quart of canned strawberry juice, thicken with corn-starch, and boil until the corn-starch is well cooked. When done, let it cool off a little, then slice four or five bananas into it, and mold in cups. Set aside to cool. Serve with Granose Flakes and whipped cream. ^Scalloped Bananas.— Cut one-half dozen ba- nanas into one-half inch slices. Cut some bread into small pieces, and put a layer of this into the bottom of an oiled pudding-dish. Add a layer of bananas, two tablespoonfuls of Malted Nuts, and one-half tablespoonful of lemon juice. A sprinkle of sugar may be used. Repeat these layers until all have been used, having bread as the top layer. Sprinkle the top with Malted Nuts or sugar, and bake for one-half hour in a quick oven. ^Filled Bananas.— Remove a section of the peel from large ripe bananas; then lift out the pulp so as to leave the shell. Crush raspberries slightly, and sweeten to taste; add a few drops of lemon juice.

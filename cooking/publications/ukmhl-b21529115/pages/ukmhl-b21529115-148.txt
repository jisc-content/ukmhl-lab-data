146 Healthful Cookery Stewed Tomatoes.—Peel and slice the tomatoes. Put them into a double boiler, without the addi- tion of water, and stew for an hour or longer. When done, serve plain with a little sugar added, or season with salt and a tablespoonful of rather thick sweet cream to each pint of tomatoes. If the stew is thin, it may be thickened with a teaspoonful of flour rubbed smooth in water. Tomatoes are much better, however, to stew until the water they contain is sufficiently evaporated to make them of the desired consistency. The stew may also be thickened by the addition of bread-crumbs, rice, or macaroni. Broiled Tomatoes.— Choose perfectly ripened but firm tomatoes of equal size. Place them on a wire boiler, and broil over glowing coals from three to eight minutes, according to size; then turn, and cook on the other side. Broil the stem end first. Serve hot with salt to season, and a little Nut Cream. Tomato with Okra.—Wash the okra, cut off the stem and nibs, and slice thin. For a quart of sliced okra, peel and slice three large tomatoes. Stew the tomatoes for half an hour, then add the okra, and simmer together for half an hour longer. Season with salt and a little cream.

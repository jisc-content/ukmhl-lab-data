Healthful Cookery 74 Everything should be well prepared, the toma- toes cooked in their own juice, and put through a fine sieve to remove seeds. Rub the pulp as nearly all through as possible, and cook until thick before measuring. Grate the onions, and strain without water. Grate the rind of the lemons carefully, the surface only, roll well, and extract the juice. Add lemon and onion juice last, boil slowly for thirty minutes, or until as thick as desired. *Broiled Nuttolene with Peas.— Cut Nuttolene into slices of halves or quarters, and broil as previ- ously directed. Place fresh lettuce leaves on one side of an individual platter. Lay the broiled Nut- tolene in the center, and put two or three spoonfuls of stewed green peas on the lettuce, around the Nut- tolene. *Broiled Protose with Peas in Mint Sauce.— Take canned or stewed green peas, with very little liquor, salt, heat to boiling, then add mint sauce. Keep quite warm, but do not boil. Broil Protose as directed on page 72, and serve one spoonful of the peas with each individual order. Broiled Pro- tose may also be served with any of the sauces men- tioned for broiled Nuttolene; also with Nut Gravy, Brown Gravy, etc. Sliced fresh tomatoes are a nice accompaniment for broiled Protose.

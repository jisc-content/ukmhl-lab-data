133 Vegetables Season the whole with salt to taste, and a little sage or onion may be added if desired. Steam for one and one-half hours, then bake in an oiled dish until heated through. Turn out on a platter, and decorate with the remaining potato by putting it through a pastry-tube that is fastened to one end of a bag made of coarse cloth. Serve with this dish seeded ripe olives, and garnish with parsley. If there is any left over, it may be cut into slices, and baked on an oiled pie-tin. This makes a nice break- fast dish. ^Spanish Stew.— 3 potatoes, 1 onion, 1 can Pro- tose. Take three medium-sized potatoes, peel and cube, one medium-sized onion cut into small pieces. Simmer the potato and onion until tender with suffi- cient water to cover. Then add the Protose cut into cubes. Salt to taste. *Nut Irish Stew.— Into two quarts of salted water cook from four to six large onions, sliced thin, and a few potatoes cut into irregular pieces about an inch in diameter. \Vhen the potatoes are nearly tender, add eight tablespoonfuls of Nut Meal, stirring it in carefully, so as not to break the po- tatoes. When the potatoes are done, drop in pieces of Nuttolene or Protose. Heat through, and serve.

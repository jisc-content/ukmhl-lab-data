INTRODUCTION. Among the variety of active and useful pursuits which have the improve- ment of the physical and moral condition of man in view, stands pre- eminently distinguished the rational means of preserving health, preventing disease, and, consequently, of prolonging human life. Natural and experi- mental philosophy, chemistry, anatomy and physiology, have respectively lent their aid in resolving the grand problem by which man is embodied with, and after a certain definite period, longer or shorter, he is separated from this world of matter, to enjoy a more refined existence in the world of mind. It is the same knowledge that has contributed the principal share towards developing the perishableness of our present structure and its mode of existence, as at variance with perpetual health and long life, without the interference of those auxiliaries which nature has so amply provided us with, and which are so wisely and profusely distributed over the face of the earth, to promote the ends of Providence. Since, then, it is admitted that the pre- servation of health, and the extension of human life to the longest possible period, depend on diet, assisted by other auxiliary means; and the cure of diseases on medicine and regimen; the utility of a knowledge of these respec- tive agents to meet such desirable ends, must be evident to every one capable of reflection. Medicine, considered as a science resting upon practical rules of experience, being, in a great measure, founded upon natural philosophy and chemistry, and the elements of our food being subject to the same laws, it follows, that with the daily progress of the one, the other must unquestion- ably partake of its improvements, and be continually and reciprocally receiving accessions, which cannot fail to lead to their further advancement. Nature, nevertheless, must still be held in view; she is our pilot and sheet- anchor, and will ever remain so with greater certainty, in the ratio of our acquaintance with her operations. Hence only, a source of many extensive benefits will be laid open to us; and through this labyrinth, however intricate at first sight it may appear, we shall approach our original destinationâ€”namely, that of enjoying health, and living to a good old age. Thus, aided by the knowledge and experience of the most distinguished philosophers, ancient and modern, and the practice and observations of the wisest and oldest phy- sicians, from Hippocrates the father of physic, down to the present enlightened age, may we still not indulge in the flattering hope of yet discovering more b

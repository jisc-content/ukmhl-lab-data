The antiseptic property of vinegar is employed with advantage in do- mestic economy, for preserving from decay a variety of roots, fruits, and leaves, and other parts of vegetables, which, by a species of refinement and luxury, are often considered as condiments to improve the relish of several kinds of food. The whole art of preparing vinegar pickles consists in impregnating the vege- table substances with the strongest vinegar, to which are usually added a portion of common salt and the most heating spices. To effect this object, the substance to be pickled is usually suffered to macerate, or slightly boiled with the acid, and afterwards kept infused in it, toge- ther Avith spices and salt.—See Cab- bage, Mushrooms, Walnuts, Sfc.

PIES.—Are those dishes Avhich consist either of meat, or of fruit, covered with a farinaceous crust, en- riched with butter or other fat, and rendered fit for eating by baking. The crust of the pie is usually made of two parts by weight of wheaten flour-, and one part of butter, lard, or other fat. The flour is made into a stiff paste with cold Avater, and rolled oirt on a board Avith a paste pin to the thickness of about one quarter of an inch, the board being previously sprinkled over Avith flour to prevent the dough from sticking to it. About one-sixth part of the butter, in pieces of the size of a nut- meg, is put over the extended paste, and the whole again dusted Avith flour, the paste is then doubled up, and rolled out as before. A like portion of butter is again distributed over the paste, Avhich, after being doubled up, is rolled out, and the same operation is repeated till the Avhole quantity of butter is thus incorporated Avith the flour. Part of the paste is then laid, one quarter or half an inch in thick- ness, over the inside of a deep dish in which the pie is to be baked, and the meat, cut in chops or slices, is put into the dish, together with the sea- sonings, and a portion of Avater or gravy, about a teacup-full to one pound of meat. The contents of the basin are then coA'ered Avith a lid, made of the remainder of the paste, rolled out rather thicker than the inside lining of the dish, and the lid is made to adhere to the inside sheeting, which should extend over the rim of the dish, by pressing the top paste close upon the margin. A feAv small holes are then made in the top crust, and the pie is put in the oven. The baking should be sIoav.

With respect to herrings, they are, confessedly, the most easy of di- gestion of all sea fish ; and salt her- rings, in particular, if eaten in small quantities, dissolve the slime in the stomach, stimulate the appetite, create thirst, and do not readily putrefy by keeping.—See Herrings. FISH, To Cook.—The method of cooking fish is a circumstance also of some importance. Frying them in oil or lard is objectionable, and the boiling process is best adapted to render them wholesome. Stewed fish, with all the usual additions of glu- tinous and stimulant materials, are extremely injurious to dispeptics. The objections urged against salted meats apply equally to salted fish; they are, however, rendered less in- jurious by a plentiful admixture of potatoes, an esculent root, which, with the exception of parsnip, is the only vegetable that ought to be eaten with any species of fish; and inva- lids would do well, during the use of

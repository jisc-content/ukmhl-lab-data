STOMACH, REGULATION OF.—It has been well observed that “temperance is the best physic:” although the ancient physicians did not hesitate to recommend occasional indulgence, and allowed people to exceed both in eating and drinking; but it is safer, if there be any safety in danger, to go to excess in drinking than in eating; inasmuch that in the former, should the debauch cause any extraordinary or distressing de- gree of pain or sickness, and should a temporary fever ensue, it may for the most part be shaken off, either by lying in bed and encouraging perspiration ; or getting on horse- back and using brisk exercise, to restore the body to its natural state. Should a person overload his stomach, that is, go to excess in eating, espe- cially in high seasoned things, with rich sauces, a draught of cold water acidulated with lemon juice or sul- phuric acid, will take off the sense of weight at the stomach, and assist the digestive process by moderating and keeping within bounds the alimen- tary fermentation, thus preventing the generation of too much air. The luxury of ices may be of real service at the tables of the great, for produc- ing similar effects to the acidulated cold water. Persons under these circumstances should not lay them- selves down to sleep, but, on the con- trary, keep up and use moderate exercise until they feel sensible of the stomach being unloaded, and that they no longer experience any oppressive weight in that bowel. The stomach should always be al- lowed time to empty itself before it is filled it again. From necessity a man may be obliged to fast, he ought, if possible, during that time, to avoid laborious work. After suf- fering from extreme hunger, people should not at once gorge or fill them- selves ; nor is it proper after being once filled, to enjoin an absolute fast: neither is it safe to indulge in a state of total rest immediately after exces- sive labour; nor suddenly to fall to work after having been long with- out motion: in a word, all changes should be gradually made ; for though the constitution of the human body be such that it can bear many altera- tions and irregularities without much danger, yet, wherever the transitions are extremely sudden, there is a great risk of producing some degree of disorder. The most obvious operation of bitters is, that being taken into the stomach they increase the appetite for food, and promote digestion of it: but let it be taken for granted that these functions depend upon the tone of the muscular fibres of the sto- mach ; and therefore we may sup- pose that the improvements of these functions depend upon an increase of tone in these fibres. And farther, as loss of appetite and indigestion can often be distinctly perceived to occur from a loss of tone in the sto- mach ; so bitters, as they are often effectual in curing these disorders, may be presumed to do it by restoring the tone of this organ. The medi- cinal part of bitters of eveyy kind may be extracted either by watery or spi- rituous menstrua; and such extrac- tions may contain the virtues of the substance from which they have been taken; though probably never to the same extent; consequently the bitter in substance in certain cases is the only effectual mode of exhibiting it. There are cases, however, where the stomach will not bear either the bark or bitters in substance, and therefore it becomes necessary to obtain these virtues in a liquid form; in the ma- nagement of which there are several particulars that demand attention. By infusion in hot water, and even in cold water, bitters give out their

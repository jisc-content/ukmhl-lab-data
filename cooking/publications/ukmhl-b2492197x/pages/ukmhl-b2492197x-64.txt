It rarely weighs above two pounds; it feeds on weeds, oysters, small fishes, &c. : it breeds three times. It is a little hard of digestion, in conse- quence of the gross juices it contains; at the same time these very juices make it extremely nourishing, and good durable food. It has a good taste, and was much esteemed by the Romans, which made them place it among those that brought an exces- sive price. The liver of the barbel is the most esteemed part, for the exquisiteness of its taste, and the head next. The small barbels are to be pre- ferred to the large, as they are easier of digestion. They should also be taken in pure running waters. There are two sorts of barbel, the one hairy the other not. It agrees at all times with young bilious people, those who have a good stomach, and use much exercise. BARLEY. — An annual plant, cultivated in almost every part of Europe.* The principal use of this well-known species ot grain among us is for the making of beer; in order to which it is first malted. In Scotland, barley is a common ingre- dient in broths; and the consump- tion of it for that purpose is very considerable; barley-broth being a3 frequent a dish with the Scots, as soup with the French. Pearl barley is barley freed from the husk by means of a mill. Malt is the entire seed, which has been fermented by watering it, and then killed by drying on a kiln. Barley- water is a decoction of the preceding, and is reputed soft and lubricating, of frequent use as a beverage in many disorders, and is recommended, with the addition of nitre, in slow fevers.

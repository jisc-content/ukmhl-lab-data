XXIV INTRODUCTION. What, and liow great the virtue and the art 'To live on little, with a cheerful heart! (A doctrine sage, but truly none of mine) Let’s talk, my friends, but talk before we dine: Not when the gilt buffet’s reflected pride Turns you from sound philosophy aside ; Not when from plate to plate the eye-balls roll, And the brain dances to the mantling bowl. * * * * Now hear what blessings temperance can bring ; (Thus said my friend, and what he said I sing). First Health: the stomach cramm’d with ev’ry dish, A tomb of boil’d and roast, and flesh and fish, Where bile and wind, and phlegm and acid jar, And all the man is one intestine war. Remember oft the scholar’s simple fare. The temperate sleep, and spirits light as air. How pale each worshipful and reverend,guest Rise from a clergy, or a city feast! What life in all that simple body 1 say : What heavenly particle inspires the clay"! The soul subsides and wickedly inclines, To seem but mortal, ev’n in sound divines. On morning wings, how active springs the mind That leaves the load of yesterday behind. Hence, of all the knowledge necessary to suffering humanity, the most important for the preservation of man, and for the perpetuity of all the enjoyments of nature, is a perfect acquaintance with the aliments best cal- culated to form our constitution, to fortify all our members, to strengthen all those organs destined to the perfection of the senses, and to be the mediators of talents,’mind, and genius. It is of the juice expressed from our alimentary fluids, that is formed the tissue of our frail machine; it is to the chyle that proceeds from it, that our blood, flesh, nerves, organs, and all our senses, owe their existence and sensibility.

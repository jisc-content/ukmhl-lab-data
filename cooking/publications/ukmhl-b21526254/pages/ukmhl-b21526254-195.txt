Ch. IV. Pies, Pasties, &c. To \ To make fine Gingerbread. Take two pounds and a half of flour j mix an ounce of beat ginger with it, and half a pound of brown fugar; cut three quarters of a pound of orange-peel and citron not too fmall ; mix all thefe toge- ther ; take k mutchkin and a half of good treacle, and melt it on the fire ; beat five eggs ; wet the flour with the treacle and eggs ; weigh half a pound of frefh butter, Scots weight; melt it, and pour it in amongft your other materials;, caft them all well together; butter a frame, and put it in the oven. This gingerbread wonâ€™t fire without frames. If it rifes in bliflers when it is in the v oven, run a fork through it. It makes very fine plain bread without the fruit, with a few caraway feeds. All thefe cakes muft be fired in an oven neither too hot nor too cold. The way to know when the cakes are fired enough, is to run a clean knife down the middle of them ; if the knife comes out dry, they are enough ; if the leaf! of it flicks to the knife, put it into the oven again.

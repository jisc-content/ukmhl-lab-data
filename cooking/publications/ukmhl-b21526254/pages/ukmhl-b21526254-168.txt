Cookery and Pastry. 150 To A Hens Nejl, Make a ftrong jelly of calves feet or hartfhorn ; take a bowl, the mouth of which will go within the affet you in- tend to difh it on ; fill about a third part of the bowl with the jelly when it is cold and firm ; lay in the eggs ; melt down the reft of the jelly, and let it be quite cold, but not faftened, and pour it on the eggs ; take the thin pairings of lemons, and boil them a little in water ; cut them like ftraws, and ftrow them on the top of the jelly before it is quite firm. You make the eggs of blan- mange. 'Jelly in Cream. Fill (mail cups full of the jelly ; when it is firm, turn the cups out upon a china aiTet, and put fome thick fweet cream round the jelly in the bottom of the affet. This way of making up jelly looks very well, elpecially when it is on a pretty difh, as the painting is very pretty through the jelly.

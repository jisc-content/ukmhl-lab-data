Ch. III. Ft ES H. 41 To collar Beef. : Take the nineholls of beef; bone* it; rub it well with fait and faltpetre; let it lie three or four days, or more* according to the thicknefs of the beef; take it up and dry it well with a cloth; then feafon it very well with mixed fpices and fweet herbs, if you chufe it; roll it up very hard, and roll a cloth about it; rie the cloth very tight at both ends ; bind the whole collar very firm with broad tape ; put it in- to a pot of boiling water; be fure to keep it always covered with water. If it is very thick, it will take near four hours boiling. When it is boiled* hang it up by one of the ends of the cloth, to drop the water from it; when it is cold* loofe it out of the bindings. You may make a collar of pork the very fame way ; it takes al- ways a little more boiling than beef. D 3 Scarlet

I 'i SWEET DISHES. 197 j wine, one ounce of coriander seeds, a quarter of an ounce of allspice, a bit of cinnamon, and six cloves, all I bruised, after having previously mixed them cold. The i jelly should boil fifteen minutes without stirring; then dear it through a flannel bag. While running take a little jelly, and mix w ith a**tea-cupful of w^ater, in which a bit of beet-root has been boiled, and run it through the bag when all the rest is run out; and this is to garnish the other jelly, being cooled on a plate; but this is mat- ter of choice. This jelly has a very fine high colour and flavour. Orange Jelly. Grate the rind of two Seville and two China oranges, and tw'o lemons; sciueeze the juice of three of each, and strain, and add the juice of a quarter of a pound of lump sugar and a quarter of a pint of w'ater, and boil till it almost candies. Have ready a quart of isinglass-jelly * made with tw'o ounces; put to it the syrup, and boil it once up ; strain oftâ€™ the jelly, and let it stand to settle as above, before it is put into the mould. Hartshorn Jelly. Simmer eight ounces of hartshorn shavings with two quarts of water to one ; strain it, and boil it with the rinds of four China oranges and two lemons pared thin; ' when cool, add the juice of both, half a pound of sugar, and the whites of six eggs beaten to a froth ; let the jelly itave three or four boils without stirring, and strain it through a jelly-bag. Cranberry Jelly. Make a very strong isinglass-jelly. When cold, mix it with a double quantity of cranberry juice pressed as directed in page 229, sweeten and boil it up ; then strain it into a shape. The sugar must be good loaf, or the jelly will not be clear. Cranbeny and Rice Jelly. Boil and press the fruit, strain the juice, and by degrees mix into it as much ground rice as will, when boiled.

131 SAVOURY PIES. bit, going down to the bottom of the dish; and when done thus, thinner slices can be cut; the different co- lours, and the clear jelly, have a beautiful marbled ap- pearance. A small pie maybe made to eat hot, which with high seasoning, oysters, mushrooms, trudlcs, morels, &c. has a verjT^ good appearance. The cold pie will keep many days. Slices make a pretty side-dish. Instead of isinglass, use a calfâ€™s-foot, or a cow-heel, if the jelly is not likely to be stiff enough. The pickled tongues of former calves^-heads may be cut in, to vary the colour, instead of, or besides ham. Excellent Pork Pies, to eat cold. Raise common boiled crust into either a round or oval form, as you choose; have ready the trimming and small bits of pork cut off when a hog is killed ; and if these are not enough, take the meat off a sweet bone. Beat it well with a rolling-pin; season with pepper and salt, and keep the fat and lean separate. Put it in layers, quite close up to the top ; lay on the lid ; cut the edge smooth round, and pinch it; bake in a slow soaking oven, as the meat is vcrv solid. Directions for raising the crust will be given hereafter. The pork may be put into a common dish, with a very plain crust; and be quite as good. Observe to put no bone or water into pork-pie ; the out- side of the pieces will be hard, unless they are cut small and pressed close. Mutton Pie. Cut steaks from a loin or neck of mutton thathas hung; beat them, and remove some of the fat. Season with salt, pepper, and a little onion; put a little water at the bottom of the dish, and a little paste on the edge; then cover '.vith a moderately thick paste. Or raise small pies, and breaking each bone in two to shorten it, season, and cover it over, pinching the edge. When they come out, pour into each a spoonful of gravy made of a bit of mutton.

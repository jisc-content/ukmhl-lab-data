POULTRY. 19 inch long, a little nutmeg, pepper, and salt, two shalots shred fine, and a glass of white wine. Simmer ten mi- nutes ; then put a little of the gravy to the yolks of three eggs well beaten, and by degrees mix the whole. Turn the gravy back into the pan, and stir it till of a fine thickness without boiling. Garnish with lemon. A very nice Dish. Take the best end of a neck of lamb, cut it into steaks, and chop each bone so short as to make the steaks almost round. Egg, and strew with crumbs, herbs, and season- ing ; fry them of the finest brown; mash some potatoes with a little butter and cream, and put them into the middle of the dish raised high. Then place the edge of one steak on another with the small bone upward, all round the potatoes. Pies of the different meats are directed under the ge- neral head of savouiy pies. PART III. POULTRY, GAME, &c. To choose Poultry, Game, A Turkey Cock.—If young, it has a smooth black leg, with a short spur. The eyes full and bright, if fresh, and the feet supple and moist. If stale, the eyes will be sunk and the feet dry. Hen-turkey is knowm by the same rules; but if old, her legs will be red and rough. jPou>/5.—If a cock is young, his spurs will be short* but take care to see they have not been cut or pared, which is a trick often practised. If fresh, the vent will b» close and dark. Pullets are best just before they beo-in to lay, and yet are full of egg : if old hens, their combs and legs will be rough; if young, they will be smooth. A good capon has a thick belly and a large rump : there is a particular fat at his breast, and the comb is very pale. J^lacklegged fowls are most moist, if for roasting.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 112 three pints of water, in a stew-pot that shuts very close. As soon as it boils skim it well, and let it simmer very slowly till quite strong; strain it, and when cold take oif the fat with a spoon first, and then, to remove every particle of grease, lay a clean piece of cap or blotting- paper on it. When cold, if not clear, boil it a few minutes with the whites of two eggs (but donâ€™t add the sediment), and pour it through a nice sieve, with a nap- kin in it, which has been dipped in boiling water, to pre- vent waste. Jelly, to cover cold Fish. Clean a maid, and put it into three quarts of water, with a calf^s-foot, or cow-heel, a stick of horse-radish, an onion, three blades of mace, some white pepper, a piece of lemon-peel, and a good slice of lean gammon. Stew it until it ivill jelly; strain it oflT; when cold re- move every bit of fat; take it up from the sediment, and boil it with a glass of sherry, the whites of four or five eggs, and a piece of lemon. Boil without stirring; and after a few minutes set it by to stand half an hour, and strain it through a bag, or sieve, with a cloth in it. Cover the fish with it when cold. PART V. SAUCES, &c. A very good Sauce, especially to hide the bad colour of Foivls. CUT the livers, slices of lemon in dice, scalded pars- ley, and hard eggs: add salt, and mix them with but- ter, boil them up, and pour over the fowls. This will do for roast rabbit. White Sauce for Fricassee of Fowls, Rabbits, White Meat, Fish, or Vegetables. It is seldom necessary to buy meat for this favourite sauce, as the proportion of that flavour is but small.

LREAD, &C. 21-3 M 2 To take off the bitter of yeast, put bran into a sieve, and pour it through, having first mixed a little warm water with it. To make Bread. Let flour be kept four or five weeks before it is begun to bake wdth. Put half a bushel of good flour into a trough, or kneading-tub ; mix with It between four Snd five quarts of warm water, and a pint and a half of good yeast; put it into the flour, and stir it well with your hands till it becomes tough. Let it rise about an hour and twenty minutes, or less if it rises fast; then, before it falls, add four quarts more of warm water, and half a pound of salt; work it well, and cover it with a cloth. Put the fire then into the oven; and by the time it is warm enough, the dough will be ready. Make the loaves about five pounds each ; sw'eep out the oven very clean and quick, and put in the bread ; shut it up close, and two hours and a half will bake it. In summer the water should be milk-warm, in winter a little more, and in frosty weather as hot as you can well bear your hand in, but not scalding, or the whole will be spoiled. If baked in tins, the crust will be very nice. The oven should be round, not long; the roof from twenty to twenty-four inches high, the mouth small, and the door of iron, to shut close. This construction will save firing and time, and bake better than long and high-roofed ovens. Rolls, muffins, or any sort of bread, may be made to taste new when two or three days old, by dipping them uncut in water, and baking afresh or toasting. American Flour Requires almost twice as much water to make it into 1 bread as is used for English flour, and therefore it is more jprofitable;- fora stone of the American, which weighs 1 fourteen pounds, will make twenty-one pounds and a I half of bread, but the best sort of English flour produce.? <only eighteen pounds and a half.

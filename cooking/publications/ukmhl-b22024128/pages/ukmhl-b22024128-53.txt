XXI this, the cook should give orders to the butcher to divide the joints of the bones of all carcass-joints of mutton, lamb, and veal (such as neck, breast, and loin); which may then be easily cut into thin slices attached to the adjoining bones. If the whole of the meat belonging to each bone should be too thick, a small slice may be taken ofF between every two bones. The more fleshy joints (as fillet of veal, leg, or saddle of mutton, and beef) are to be helped in thin slices, neatly cut and smooth ; observing to let the knife pass down to the bone in the mutton and beef joints. The dish should not be too far oft’ the carver; as it gives an awkward appearance, and makes the task more difficult. Attention is to be paid to help every one to a part of such articles as are considered the best. In helping fish, take care not to break the flakes; which in cod and very fresh salmon are large, and con- tribute much to the beauty of its appearance. A fish- knife, not being sharp, divides it best on this account. Help a part of the roe, milt, or liver, to each person. The heads of carp, parts of tliose of cod and salmon, sounds of cod, and fins of turbot, are likewise esteemed niceties, and are to be attended to accordingly. In cutting up any wild-fowl, duck, goose, or turkey, for a large party, if you cut the slices down from pinion to pinion, without making wings, there will be more prime pieces. A Cod's Head.—Fish in general requires very little carving, the fleshy parts being those principally esteemed. A cod’s head and shoulders, when in season, and pro- perly boiled, is a very genteel and handsome dish. When cut, it should be done with a fish-trowel, and the parts

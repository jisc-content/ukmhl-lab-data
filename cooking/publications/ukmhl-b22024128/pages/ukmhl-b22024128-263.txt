131 PICKLES, Pickled Lemons. They shoukl be small, and with thick rinds; rub them with a piece of flannel ; then slit them half down in four quarters, but not through to the pulp: fill the slits with salt hard pressed in, set them upright in a pan for four or five days, until the salt melts; turn them thrice a day in their own liquor, until tender; make enough pickle to cover them, of rape-vinegar, the brine of the lemons, Jamaica pepper, and ginger; boil and skim it; when cold, put it to the lemons, with two ounces of mustard- seed, and two cloves of garlick to six lemons. When the lemons are used, the pickle will be useful in fish or other sauces. Olives Are of three kinds, Italian, Spanish, and French, of dif- ferent sizes and flavour; each sort should be firm, though some are most fleshy. Preserve them from the air. Pickled Onions. In the month of September, choose the small white round onions, take of the brown skin, have ready a very nice tin stew-pan of boiling water, throw in as many onions as will cover the top; as soon as they look clear on the outside, take them up as quick as possible with a ' slice, and laj" them on a clean cloth; cover them close with another, and scald some more, and so on. Let them lie to be cold, then put them in ajar, or glass wide-mouth bottles, and pour over them the best white wine vinegar, just hot, but not boiling. When cold, cover them. Should the outer skin shrivel, peel it oft'. They must look quite clear. To pickle Cucumbers and Onions sliced. Cut them in slices, and sprinkle salt over them ; next day drain them for five or six hours; then put them into a stone jar, pour boiling vinegar over them, and keep them in a warm place. The slices should be thick. Re- peat the boiling vinegar, and stop them up again instant-

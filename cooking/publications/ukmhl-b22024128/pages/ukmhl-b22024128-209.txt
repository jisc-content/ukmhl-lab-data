127 SAVOURY PIES. may be made of so great a variety of things. Some are best eaten when cold, and in that case, there should be no suet put into the forcemeat that is used with them. If the pie is either made of meatthatwill take moredress- ing, to inake it extremely tender, than the baking of the crust will allow j or, if it is to be served In an earthen pie- form ; observe the following preparation : Take three pounds of the veiny piece of beef (for In- stance) that has fat and lean; wash it; and season it with salt, pepper, mace, and allspice, in fine powder, rub- bing them well in. Set it by the side of a slow fire, in a stew-pot that will just hold it; put to it a piece of butter, of about the weight of two ounces, and cover it quite close ; let it just simmer in its own steam till it begins to shrink. When it is cold, add more seasoning, force- meat, and eggs: and if it is in a dish, put some gravy to it before baking; but if it is only in crust, don^t put the gravy till after it is cold and in jelly, as has been de- scribed in pages 111 and 112. Forcemeat may be put both under and over the meat, if preferred to bails. Eel Pie. Cut the eels in lengths of two or three Inches, season with pepper and salt, and place in the dish, with some bits of butter, and a little water; and cover it with paste. Cod Pie. Take a piece of the middle of a small cod, and salt it well one night: next day wash it: season with pepper, salt, and a very little nutmeg, mixed ; place in a dish, and put some butter on it, and a little good broth of any kind into the dish. Cover it with a crust; and when done, add a sauce of a spoonful of broth, a quarter of a pint of cream, a little flour and butter, a grate of lemon and nutmeg, and give it one boil. Oysters may be added. Mackerel will do well, but do not salt them till used. Parsley picked and put in, may be used instead of oysters.

The cock kills all the young chickens he can get at, by one blow on the centre of the head with his bill; and he does the same by his own brood before the feathers of the crown come out. Nature therefore impels the hen to keep them out of his way till the feathers rise. Guinea TIens Lay a great number of eggs; and if you can discover the nest, it is best to put them under common hens, which are better nurses. They require great warmth, quiet, and careful feeding with rice swelled with milk, or bread soaked in it. Put two pepper-corns down their throat when first hatched. Pigeons Bring two young ones at a time ; and breed every month, if well looked after, and plentifully fed. They should be kept very clean, and the bottom of the dove- cote be strewed with sand once a month at least. Tares and white peas are their proper food. They should have plenty of fresh w^ater in their house. Starlings and other birds are apt to come among them, and suck the eggs. Vermin likewise are their great enemies, and destroy them. If the breed should b^e too small, put a few tame pigeons of the common kind, and of their own colour, among them. Observe not to have too large a propor- tion of cock'birds ; for they are quarrelsome, and will soon thin the dove-cote. Pigeons are fond of salt, and it keeps them in health. Lay a large heap of clay near the house, and let the salt-brine that may be done with in the family be poured upon it. Bay-salt and cummin-seeds mixed is a univetsal re- medy for the diseases of pigeons. The backs and breasts are sometimes scabby : in which case, take a quarter of apound of bay-salt, and as much common salt 3 apound

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 134 Pigeon Pie. Rub the pigeons with pepper and salt, inside and out; in the latter put a bit of butter, and if approved, some parsley chopped with the livers, and a little of the same seasoning. Lay a beef steak at the bottom of the di.^h, • and the birds on it; between every two, a hard egg. Put a cup of water in the dish ; and if you have any ham in ihe house, lay a bit on each pigeon: it is a great im- provement to the flavour. Observe, when ham is cut for gravy or pies, to take the under part rather than the prime. . Season the gizzards, and two joints of the wings, and put them in the centre of the pie ; and over them, in a hole made in the crust, three feet nicely cleaned, to show what pie it is. Partridge Pie in a Dish. Pick and singe four partridges; cut off the legs at the knee; season with pepper, salt, chopped parsley, th3'me, and mushrooms. Lay a veal-steak, and a slice of ham, at the bottom of the dish ; put the partridge in, and half ■a pint of good broth. Put puff paste on the ledge of the dish, and cover with the same; brush it over with egg, and bake an hour. Hare Pie, to eat cold. Season the hare after it is cut up; and bake it, with egofs and forcemeat, in a raised crust or dish. When it is to be served, cut off the lid, and cover it with jelly- gravy, as \npage 111. A French Pie. Lay a puff-paste round on the ledge of the dish : and put in either veal in slices, rabbits or chickens jointed ; with forcemeat-balls, sweetbreads cut in pieces, arti- choke-bottoms, and a few truffles. Vegetable Pie. Scald and blanch some broad beans; cut young carrots, turnips, artichoke-bottoms, mushrooms, peas, onions, lettuce, parsley, celeiy, or any of them you have; make the whole into a nice stew, with some good veal-gravy.

71 MUTTON. To dress Haunch of Mutton. Keep it as long as it can be preserved sweet by the diilereiit modes : let it be washed with warm milk and water, or vinegar, if necessary ; but \vhen to be dressed, observe to wash it well, lest the outside should have a bad flavour from keeping. Put a paste of coai*se flour or strong paper, and fold the haunch in; set it a great distance from the fire, and allow proportionable time for the paste; don’t take it off till about thirty-five or forty minutes before serving, and then baste it continually. Bring the haunch nearer to the fire before you take off the paste, and froth it up as you would venison. A gravy must be made of a pound and a half of loin of old mutton, simmered in a pint of water to half, and no seasoning but salt: brown it with a little burnt sugar, and send it up in the dish ; but there should be a good deal of gravy in the meat; for though long at the fire, the distance and covering will prevent its roasting cut. Serve with currant-jelly sauce. To roast a Saddle of Mutton. Let it be well kept first. Raise the skin, and then skewer it on again; take it off a quarter of an hour be- fore serving, sprinkle it wdth some salt, baste it, and dredge it well with flour. The rump should be split, and skewered back on each side. The joint may be large or small according to the company : it is the most elegant if the latter. Being broad it requires a high and strong fire. Fillet of Mutton braised. Take off the chump end of the loin, butter some pa- per, and put over it, and then paste as for venison ; roast it two hours. Don’t let it be the least brown. Have . ready some French beans boiled and drained on a sieve; and while the mutton is being glazed, give them one heat-up in gravy, and lay them on the dish with the meat over them. Harrico. Take off some of the fat, and cut the middle or best end of the neck into rather thin steaks; flour and fry

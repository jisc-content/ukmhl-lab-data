DOMESTIC COOKERY. 218 juice of a lemon. When come to a jelly, let it gro\T cold, and put it on and among the apples; cut the peel of the lemon in narrow strips, and put across the eye of the apple. Observe that the colour be fine from the first, or the fruit will not afterwards gain it; and use as little of the cochineal as will-serve, lest the syrup taste bitter. Dried Apples. Put them in a cool oven six or seven times, and flatten them by degrees, and gently, when soft enough to bear it. If the oven be too hot they will waste j and at first it should be very cool. The biffin, the minshnl crab, or any tart apples, are the sorts for dryins;. To preserve jarganel Pears most heautifidly. Pare them very thin, and simmer in a thin syrup ; let them lie a day or two. Make the syrup richer, and sim- mer again ; and repeat this till they are clear ; then drain, and dry them in the sun or a cool oven a very little time. They may be kept in syrup, and dried as wanted, which makes them more moist and rich. Gooseberry Jam for Tarts. Put twelve pounds of the red hairy gooseberries, when ripe and gathered in dry weather, into a preserving-pan, with a pint of currant-juice, drawn as for jelly ; let them boil pretty quick, and beat them with the spoon; when they begin to break, jmt to them six pounds of yjure white Lisbon sugar, and simmer slowly to a jam. It re- quires long boiling, or will not keep; but is an excel- lent and reasonable thing for tarts or pufls. Look at it in two or three days, and if the j^rup and fruit separate, the whole must be boiled longer. Be careful it does not burn to the bottom. Another.â€”Gather your gooseberries (the clear white or green sort) when ripe ; top and tail, and weigh them ; a pound to three quarters of a pound of fine sugar, and half a pint of water ; boil and skim the sugar and water; then put the fruit, and boil gently till clear : then break, and put into small pots.

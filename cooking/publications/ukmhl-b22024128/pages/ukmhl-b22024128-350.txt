DOMESTIC COOKERY. 2(38 < buttermilk. If made of sweet cream, is a delicious and most whole- some food. Those who can relish sour buttermilk, find it still more light; and it is reckoned more beneficial in consumptive cases. Buttermilk, if not very sour, is also as good as cream, to eat with fruit, if sweetened with white sugar, and mixed with a very little milk. It likewise does equallv for cakes and rice-puddings, and of course it is econo- mical to churn before the cream is too stale for any thing but to feed pigs. To keep Milk and Cream. In hot weather, when it is difficult to preserve milk from becoming sour, and spoiling the cream, it may be kept perfectly sw^eet by scalding the new milk very gently, without boiling, and setting it by in the earthen dish, or pan that it is done in. This method is pursued in Devonshire; and for butter, and eating, would equally answer in small quantities for coffee, tea, &c. Cream already skimmed may be kept twenty-four hours if scalded without sugar ; and by adding to it as much pow'dered lump-sugar as shall make it pretty sweet, will be good two days, keeping it in a cool place. Syrup of Cream May be preserved as above in the proportion of a pound and quarter of sugar to a pint of perfectly fresh cream ; keep it in a cool place for two or three hours; then put it in one or two ounce phials, and cork it close. It will keep good thus for several weeks, and will be found very usiBful in voyages. Gallino Curds and Whey, as in Italy. Take a number of the rough coats that line the giz- zards of turkeys and fowls ; clean them from the peb- bles they contain; rub them well with salt, and hang them to drv. This makes a more tender and delicate curd than common rennet. When to be used, break olF some bits of the skin, and put on it some boiling water ; in eight or nine hours use the liquor as you do other rennet.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 228 fruit, and forms a jam. Keep it in small jars in a dry- place. If too sweet, mix with it some of the fruit that IS done without sugar. Another way.â€”Choose steen-pots if you can get them, which are of equal size top and bottom (they should hold eight or nine pounds), put the fruit in, about a quarter up, then strew in a quarter of tlie sugar ; then another quantity of fruit, and so till all of both are in. The pro- portion of sugar is to be three pounds to nine pounds of fruit. Set the jars in the oven, and bake the fruit quite through. When cold, put a piece of clean-scraped stick into the middle of the jar, and let the upper part stand above the top ; then pour melted mutton-suet over the top, full half an inch thick, having previously covered the fruit with white paper. Keep the jars in a cool dry place, and use the suet as a cover; which you will draw up by the stick, minding to leave a little forked branch to it to prevent its slipping out. To preserve Fruit for Tarts, or Family-desserts. Cherries, plums of all sorts, and American apples, gather when ripe, and lay them in small jars that will hold a pound : strew over each jar six ounces of good loaf-sugar pounded; cover with two bladders each, .separately tied down; then set the jars in a large stew- pan of water up to the neck, and let it boil three hours gently. Keep these and all other sorts of fruit free from damp. \ To keep Lemon-juice. Buy the fruit when cheap, keep it in a cool place two or three days: if too unripe to squeeze readily, cut the peel off some, and roll them under your hand to make them part with the juice more readily ; others you may lea'^e unpared for grating, when the pulp shall be taken out and dried. Squeeze the juice into a china basin; then strain it through some muslin w'hich will not permit the least pulp to pass. Have ready half and quarter ounce phials perfectly dry; fill them with the juite so near the top as only to admit half a tea-spoonful of sw'eet

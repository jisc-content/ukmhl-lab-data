DOMESTIC COOKERY. 188 ounces of currants picked clean, and washed; stir them, and boil till they are done. Beat the yolks of three eggs, and a little nutmeg, with two or three spoonfuls of milk; add this to the wheat; stir them together while over the fire; then sweeten, and serve cold in a deep dish. jSome persons like it best warm. Curds and Cream. Put three or four pints of milk into a pan a little warm, and then add rennet or gallino. When the curd is come, lade it with a saucer into an earthen shape perforated, of any form you please. Fill it up as the whey drains off, without breaking or pressing the curd. If turned only two hours before wanted, it is very light; but those who like it harder, may have it so, by making it earlier, and squeezing it. Cream, milk, or a whip of cream, sugar, wine, and lemon, to be put in the dish, or into a glass bowl, to serve with the curd. Another way,—To four quarts of new milk warmed, put from a pint to a quart of buttermilk strained, accord- ing to its sourness; keep the pan covered until the curd be of firmness to cut three or four times across with a saucer, as the whey leaves it; put it into a shape, and fill up until it be solid enough to take the form. Serve with cream plain, or mixed with sugar, wine, and lemon. A Curd Star. Set a quart of new milk upon the fire with tW'O or three blades of mace; and when ready to boil, put to it the yolks and whites of nine eggs well beaten, and as much salt as will lie upon a small knife’s point. Let it boil till the whey is clear; then drain it in a thin cloth, or hair sieve ; season it with sugar, and a little cinnamon, rose-water, orange-flower water, or white wine, to your taste ; and put into a star form, or any other. Let it stand some hours before you turn it into a dish; then put round it thick cream or custard. Blanc-?}iange, or Bla??iange.

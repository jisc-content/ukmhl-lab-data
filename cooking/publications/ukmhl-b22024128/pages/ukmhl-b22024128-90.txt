26 DOMESTIC COOKERY. When sirloins of beef, or loins of veal or mutton, come in, part of the suet may be cut otF for puddings, or to clarify. Dripping vs'ill baste every thing as well as butter, ex- cept fowls and game ; and for kitchen pies, nothing else should be used. The fat of a neck or loin of mutton makes a far lighter pudding than suet. Meat and vegetables that the frost has touched, should be soaked in cold water two or three hours before used, or more if they are much iced. Putting them into hot water, or to the fire, till thawed, makes it impossible for any heat to dress them properly afterwards. In warm weather, meat should be examined well when it comes in ; and if flies have touched it, the part must be cut off, and then well washed. In the height of summer, it is a very safe w^ay to let meat that is to be salted lie an hour in very cold water, rubbing well any part likely to have been fly-blown : then wipe it quite dry, and have salt ready, and rub it thoroughly in every part, throwing a handful over it besides. Turn it every day, and rub the pickle in, which vvill make it ready for the table in three or four days. If to be very much corned, wrap it in a well-floured cloth, after rubbing it with salt. This last method will corn fresh beef fit for the table the day it comes in, but it must be put into the pot when the water boils. If the weather permit, meat eats much better for hang- ing two or three days before it is salted. The w'^ater in which meat has been boiled makes an excellent soup for the poor, by adding to it vegetables, oatmeal, or peas. Roast-beef-bones, or shank-bones of ham, make fine peas-soup; and should be boiled with the peas the day before eaten, that the fat may be taken oft'. In some families great lossis sustained by the spoiling of meat. The best way to keep what is to be eaten un- salted, is, as before directed, to examine it well, wipe it every day, and put some pieces of charcoal over it. If

289 SICK COOKETIY. It should form the whole of the patient’s drink, and the food should be biscuits and rusks, in every way and sort; ripe and dried fruits of various kinds, when a de- cline is apprehended. Baked and dried fruits, raisins in particular, make excellent suppers for invalids, with biscuits, or common cake. Orgeat. Beat two ounces of almonds with a tea-spoonful of orange-flower water, and a bitter almond or two ; then pour a quart of milk and water to the paste. Sweeten with sugar, or capillaire. This is a fine drink for those who have a tender chest; and in the gout it is highly useful, and with the addition of half an ounce of gum arable, has been found to allay the painfulness of the attendant heat. Half a glass of brandy may be added if thought too cooling in the latter complaints, and the glass of orgeat may be put into a basin of warm water. Another orgeat, for company, is in page 229. Orangeade, or Lemonade. Squeeze the juice; pour boiling water on a little of the peel and cover close. Boil water and sugar to a thin syrup, and skim it. When ail are cold, mix the juice, the infusion, and the syrup, with as much more water as will make a rich sherbet; strain through a jelly- bag. Or squeeze the juice, and strain it, and add w^ater and capillaire. Egg Wine. Beat an egg, mix with it a spoonful of a cold water; set on the fire a glass of white wine, half a glass of water, sugar, and nutmeg. When it boils, pour a little of it to the egg by degrees, till the whole be in, stirring it well; then return the whole into the sauce-pan, put it on a gentle fire, stir it one way for not more than a minute • for if it boil, or the egg be stale, it will curdle. Serve with toast. Egg wine may be made as above, without warmina* the egg, and it is then lighter on the stomach, though not so pleasant to the taste. o

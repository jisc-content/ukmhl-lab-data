ADVERTISEMENT. 1 As the following directions were intended for the conduct of the families of the authoress's own daughters^ and for the arrangement of their table, so as to unite a good figure with proper economy, she has avoided all excessive luxuryy such as essence of ham, and that wasteful expenditure of large quantities of meat for gravy, which so greatly contributes to keep up the price, and is no less in- jurious to those who eat than to those whose penury obliges them to abstain. Many receipts are given for things, which, being in daily use, the mode of preparing them may be supposed too well known to require a place in a cookery-book; yet we rarely meet with butter properly melted, good toast and water, or well-made coffee. She makes no apo- logy for minuteness in some articles, or for leaving others unnoticed, because she does not write for pro- fessed cooks. This little work woidd have been a treasure to herself when she ffirst set out in life, and she therefore hopes it may prove useful to others. In that expectation it is given to the Public; and as she will receive from it no emolument, so she trusts it will escape without censure. SI 2

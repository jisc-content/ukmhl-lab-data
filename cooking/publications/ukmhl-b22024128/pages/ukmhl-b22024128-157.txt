Pheasants.â€”The cock-bird is accounted best, except when the hen is with egg. If young, he has short blunt or round spurs ; but if old, they are long and sharp. Directions for dressing Poultry and Game. All poultry should be very carefully picked, every plug removed, and the hair nicely singed with white paper. The cook must be careful in drawing poultry of all sorts, not to break the gall-bag, for no washing will take off the bitter where it has touched. In dressing wild fowl, be careful to keep a clear brisk fire. Let them be done of a fine yellow brown, but leave the grav}" in: the fine flavour is lost if done too much. Tame fowls require more roasting, and are longer in heating through than others. All sorts should be conti- nually basted; that they may be served with a froth, and appear of a fine colour. A large fowl will take three quarters of an hour; a middling one half an hour; and a very small one or a chicken, twenty minutes. The fire must be very quick and clear before any fowls are put down. A capon will take from half an hour to thirty-five minutes; a goose an hour; wild ducks a quarter of an hour; pheasants twen- ty minutes ; a small turkey stuffed, an hour and a quar- ter; turkey-poults, twenty minutes; grouse, a quarter of an hour; quails, ten minutes; and partridges, from twen- ty to twenty-five minutes. A hare will take near an hour, and the hind part requires most heat. Pigs and geese require a brisk fire, and quick turning. , Hares and rabbits must be well attended to: and the ex- tremities brought to the quick part of the fire, to be done equally with the backs.

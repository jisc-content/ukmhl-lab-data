DOMESTIC cookery. 250 gins to thicken, stir constantly. It must be as thick as treacle. A dessert-spoonful thrice a day. To preserve Yeast. When you have plenty of yeast, begin to save it in the following manner; whisk it until it becomes thin, then take a new large wooden dish, wash it very nicely, and when quite dry, lay a layer of yeast over the inside with a soft brush; Jet it dry, then put another layer in the same manner, and so do until you have a sufficient quantity, observing that each coat dry thoroughly be- fore another be added. It may be put on two or three inches thick, and will keep several montlis; when to be used, cut a piece out; stir it in warm water. If to be used for brewing, keep it by dipping large handfuls of birch tied together; and when dry, repeat the dipping once. You may thus do as many as you please; but take care that no dust comes to them, or the vessel in which it has been prepared as before. When the wort is set to work, throw it into one of these bunches, and it will do as well as with fresh yeast; but if mixed with a small quantity first, and then added to the whole, it will work sooner. Remarks on English Wines. O English wines would be found particularly useful, now foreign are so high-priced; and though sugar is dear, they may be made at a quarter of the expense. If care- fully made, and kept three or four years, a proportion- able strength being given, they would answer the pur- pose of foreign wines for health, and cause a very con- siderable reduction in the expenditure. A rich and pleasant Wine. Take new cider from the press, mix it with as much honey as will support an egg, boil gently fifteen minutes, but not in an iron, brass, or copper pot. Skim it well; when cool, let it be tunned, but donâ€™t quite fill. In March following bottle it, and it will be fit to drink in six weeks; but will be less sweet if kept longer in the cask.

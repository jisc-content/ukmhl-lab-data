LAMB. 77 meat; braise it two hours over a slow stove. Take it up, glaze it; or it may be glazed only, and not braised. The method for both, see page S-l'. Serve with sorrel- sauce under the lamb. Lamb Steaks. Fry them of a beautiful brown; when served throw over them a good quantity of crumbs of bread fried, and crimped parsley ; the receipt for doing which of a fine colour will be given under the head of Vegetables.

Sauce for them, called sauce Robart, will be found in the list of Sauces. House-Lamb Steaks white. Stew them in milk and water till very tender, with a bit of lemon-peel, a little salt, some pepper, and mace.

Season them with pepper, salt, nutmeg, grated lemon- peel, and chopped parsley ; but dip them first into egg : fry them quick.

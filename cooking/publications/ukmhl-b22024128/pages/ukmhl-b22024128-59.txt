To take off the wing, put your fork into the small end of the pinion, and press it close to the body; then put in the knife at d, and divide the joint, taking it down in the direction d, e. Nothing but practice will enable people to hit the joint exactly at the first trial. When the leg and wing of one side are done, go on to the other; but it is not often necessary to cut up the whole goose^ unless the company be very large. There are two side bones by the wing, which may be cut off; as likewise the back and lower side-bones : but the best pieces are the breast and the thighs after being divided from the drum-sticks. Hare.—The best way of cutting it up is, to put the point of the knife under the shoulder at «, in the figure opposite the next page, and so cut all the way down to the rump, on one side of the back-bone, in the line «, b. Do the same on the other side, so that the whole hare will be divided into three parts. Cut the back into four, which with the legs is the part most esteemed. The shoulder must be cut off in a circular line, as, c, d, a : lay the pieces neatly on the dish as you cut them; and then help the company, giving some pudding and gravy to every person. This way can only be practised when the hare is young: if old, donT divide it dowm, which will require a strong arm : but put the knife betw^een the leg and back, and give it a little turn inwards at the joint; which you must endeavour to hit, and not to break by force. When both legs are taken off, there is a fine collop on each side the back ; then divide the back into as many pieces as you please, and take ofT the c

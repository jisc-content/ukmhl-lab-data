sot DOMESTIC COOKERY. To give a Gloss to fine Oak-wainscot. If greasy, it must be washed with warm beer; then boil two (juarts of strong beer, a bit of bees-wax as large as a walnut, and a large spoonful of sugar; wet it all over with a large brush, and when dry rub it till bright. To give a fine Colour to Mahogany. Let the tables be washed perfectly clean with vinegar, having first taken out any ink stains there may be with spirit of salt; but it must be used with the greatest care, and only touch the part alfected, and he instantly washed off. Use the following liquid ;â€”Into a pint of cold- drawn linseed oil, put four pennv'worth of alkanet-root, and twoTpennyworth of rose-pink, in an earthen vessel; let it remain all night, then stirring well, rub some of it all over the tables with a linen rag ; when it l;as lain some time, rub it bright with linen cloths. Eating-tables should be covered with mat, oil-cloth, or baize, to prevent staining, and be instantly rubbed when the dishes are taken off, while still warm. To take Ink out of Mahogany. Dilute half a tea-spoonful of oil of vitriol with a large spoonful of water, and touch the part with a feather; watch it, for if it stays too long it will leave a white mark. It is therefore better to rub it quick, and repeat if not quite removed. Floor-cloths. Should be chosen that are painted on a fine cloth, that is well covered with the colour, and the flowers on which do not rise much above the ground, as they wear out first. The durability of the cloth will depend much on these two particulars, but more especially on the time it has been painted, and the goodness of the colours. If they have not been allowed sufficient space for becoming thoroughly hardet>ed, a very little use will injure them ; and as they are very expensive articles, care in preserv- ing them is necessary. It answers to keep them some time before they are used, either hung up in a dry barn where they will have air, or laid down in a spare room.

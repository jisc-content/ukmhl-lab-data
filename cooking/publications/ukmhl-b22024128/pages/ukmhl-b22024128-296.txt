214. DOMESTIC COOKERY. W'hat form you please, turn the other side up, and dry that. Keep them in a box, with layers of paper. They are for desserts; and are also useful asastomachic, to carry in the pocket on journeys, or for gentlemen when shooting, and for gouty stomachs. Orange-jiovoer Cakes. Put four ounces of the leaves of the flowers into cold water for an hour; drain, and put between napkins, and roll with a rolling-pin till they are bruised; then have ready boiled a pound of sugar to add to it in a thick sy- rup, give them a simmer until the syrup adheres to the sides of the pan, drop in little cakes on a plate, and dry as before directed. To preserve Oranges or Lemons in Jelly. Cut a hole in the stalk part, the size of a shilling, and with a blunt small knife scrape out the pulp quite clear without cutting the rind. Tie each separately in muslin, and lay them in spring-water two days, changing twice a dav : in the last boil them tender on a slow fire. Ob- serve that there is enough at first to allow for wasting, as they must be covered to the last. To every pound of fruit, weigh two pounds of double-refined sugar, and one pint of water; boil the two latter together with the juice of the orange to a syrup, and clarify it, skim well, and let it stand to be cold ; then boil the fruit in the syrup half an hour ; if not clear, do this daily till they are done. Pare and core some green pippins, and boil in water till it tastes strong of them; don’t break them, only gently press them with the back of a spoon ; strain the water through a jelly-bag till quite clear; then to every pint put a pound of double-refined sugar, the peel and juice of a lemon, and boil to a strong syrup. Drain oft‘ the syrup from the fruit, and turning each orange with the hole upwards in the jar, pour the apple-jelly over it. The bits cut out must go through the same process with the fruit. Cover with brandy-paper.

XXX Pigeons.â€”Cut them in half, either from top to bottom or across. The lower part is generally thought the best; but the fairest way is to cut from the neck to a, figure 7, rather than from c to b, by a, which is the most fashion- able. The figure represents the back of the pigeon; and the direction of the knife is in the line c, b, by a, if done the last way.

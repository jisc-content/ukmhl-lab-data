306 DOMESTIC COOKERY. The sides of stairs or passages on which are carpets, or floor-cloth, should be washed with sponge instead of linen or flannel, and the edges will not be soiled. Dif- ferent sponges should be kept for the two above uses ; and those and the brushes should be well washed when done with, and kept in dry places. To extract Oil from Boards or Stone. Make a strong lye of pearl-ashes and soft water; and add as much unslaked lime as it will take up ; stir it to- gether, and then let it settle a few minutes ; bottle it, and stop close; have ready some water to lower it as used, and scour the part with it.

It looks extremely well. The lamp-black must be sifted first. To take Stains out of Marble.

This will, by very good rubbing, give a beautiful polish. Clear otf the soap, and finish with a smooth hard brush till the end be eflected. To take Iron Stains out of Marble.

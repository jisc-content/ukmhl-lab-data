SICK COOKERY. ^17 A clear 'Broth that ivill keep long. Put the mouse-round of beef, a knuckle-bone of veal> and a few shanks of mutton, into a deep pan, and cover close with a dish or coarse crust: bake till the beef is done enough for eating, with only as much water as will cover. When cold, cover it close in a cool place. When to be used, give what flavour may be approved. A quick-made Broth. Take a bone or two of a neck or loin of mutton, take ofl the fat and skin, set it on the fire in a small tin sauce- pan that has a cover, with three quarters of a pint of water, the meat being first beaten, and cut in thin bits; put a bit of thyme and parsley, and, if approved, a slice of onion. Let it boil very quick, skim it nicely; take off the cover, if likely to be too weak; else cover it. Half an hour is sufficient for the whole process. A verp supporting Broth against any kind of iveakness. Boil two pounds of loin of mutton, with a very large handful of chervil, in twoquarts of water, to one. Take off part of the fat. Any other herb or roots may be added. Take half a pint three or four times a day. A very nourishing Veal Broth. Put the knuckle of a leg or shoulder of veal, with very little meat to it, an old fowl, and four shank-bones of mutton extremely well soaked and bruised, three blades of mace, ten pepper-corns, an onion, and a large bit of bread, and three quarts of water, into a stew-pot that covers close, and simmer in the slowest manner after it has boiled up, and been skimmed; or bake it; strain, and take off the fat. Salt as wanted. It will require four hours. Broth of Beef Mutton, and Veal. Put two pounds of lean beef, one pound of scrag of veal, out pound of scrag of mutton, sweet herbs, and ten pepper-corns, into a nice tin saucepan, with live quarts of water; simmer to three quarts, and clear from the fat when cold. Add one onion if approved.

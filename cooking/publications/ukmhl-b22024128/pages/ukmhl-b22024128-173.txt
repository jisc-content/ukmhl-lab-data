GAME, &c: 93 butter; and sprinkle a little salt before they are taken up, put a good gravy upon them, and serve with shalot- sauce, in a boat. Woodcocks, Snipes, and Quails Keep good several days. Roast them without drawing, and serve on toast. Butter only should be eaten with them, as gravy takes off from the fine flavour. The thigh and back are estetmed the most. For the manner of trussing a woodcock or snipe, see plate IX. Ruffs and Reeves Are skewered as quails ; put bars of bacon over them, and roast them about ten minutes. Serve with a good gravy, in the dish. To dress Plovers. Roast the green ones in the same way as woodcocks and quails (see above), without drawing; and serve on a toast. Gray plovers may be either roasted, or stewed with gravy, herbs, and spice. Plovers^ Eggs Are a nice and fashionable dish. Boil them ten minutes, and serve either hot or cold on a napkin. To roast Ortolans. Pick and singe, but do not draw them. Tie on a bird-spit, and roast them. Some persons like bacon in slices tied between them, but the taste of it spoils the flavour of the ortolan. Cover them with crumbs of bread. Guinea and Pea Fowl Eat much like pheasants. Dress them in the same way {seepage 91). Hares, If properly taken care of, will keep a great time, and even when the cook fancies them past eating, maay be in the highest perfection; which if eaten when fresh-killed they are not. As they are usually paunched in the field, the cook cannot prevent this ; but the hare keeps longer, and eats much better, if not opened for four or five days, or according to the weather.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 322 The Bills of Fare which have been given from page 309 to 320, may be modified at discretion. In some houses, one dish at a time is sent up with the vegetables or sauces proper to it, and this in succession hot and hot. In others, a course of Soup and Fish: then Meats and boiled Fowls, Turkey, &c. Made Dishes and Game follow; and lastly. Sweet Dishes: but these are not the common modes. It is worthy observation here, that common cooks do not think of sending up such articles as are in the house, unless ordered; though, by so doing, the addition of a collared or pickled thing, some Fritters, fried Patties, or quick-made Dumplings, would be useful when there happen to be accidental visitors: and at all times it is right to better the appearance of the table rather than let things spoil below, by which the expense of a family is more increased than can be easily imagined. Vege- tables are put on the side table at large dinners, as like- wise sauces, and servants bring them round : but some inconveniences attend this plan ; and, when there are not many to wait, delay is occasioned, besides that by awkwardness the clothes of the company may be spoiled. If the table is if a due size, the articles alluded to wdll not fill it too much. SUPPERS. Hot suppers are not much in use where people dine very late. When required, the top and bottom, or either, may be Game. Fowls. Rabbit. Boiled Fish, such as Soles, Mackarel. Oysters stewed or scalloped. French Beans. Cauliflower, or Jerusalem Artichokes, in white Sauce. Brocoli with eggs. Stewed Spinach and ditto. Sweetbreads. Small Birds. Mushrooms. Po- tatoes. Scallop, &c. Cutlets. Roast Onions. Salma- gundi. Buttered Eggs on Toast. Cold Neat’s Tongue. Ham. Collared things. Hunter’s Beef sliced. Rusks buttered, with Anchovies on. Grated Hung Beef with butter, with or without Rusks. Grated Cheese round, and Butter dressed in the middle of a plate. Radishes

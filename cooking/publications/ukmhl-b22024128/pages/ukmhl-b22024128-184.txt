DOMESTIC COOKERY. 102 When there is plenty of vegetables, no meat is neces- sary ; but if meat be preferred, a pigâ€™s foot or ham- bone, &c. may be boiled with the old peas, which is called the stock. More butter than is mentioned above may be used with advantage, if the soup is required to be very rich. When peas first come in, or arc very young, the stock may be made of the shells washed, and boiled till they will pulp with the above; more thickening will then be wanted. Gravy Soup. Wash and soak a leg of beef; break the bone, and set it on the fire with a gallon of water, a large bunch of sweet herbs, two large onions sliced and fried a fine brown (but not burnt), tvvo blades of mace, three cloves, twenty berries of allspice, and forty black peppers. Stew til! the soup is as rich as you choose ; then take out the meat, which will be fit for the servants^ table with a little of the gravy. Next day take off the cake of fat; which will serve for basting, or for common pie-crust. Have ready such vegetables as you choose to serve. Cut car- rots, turnips, and celery, small, and simmer till tender : some people do not like them to be sent to table, only the flavour of them. Boil vermicelli a quarter of an i^ur; and add to it a large spoonful of soy, and one of mushroom-ketchup. A French roll should be made hot, put into the soup till moist through, and served in the tureen. Vegetable Soup. Pare and slice five or six cucumbers; and add to these the inside of as many cos-lettuces, a sprig or two of mint, two or three onions, some pepper and salt, a pint and a half of young peas, and a little parsley. Put these, with half a pound of fresh butter, into a sauce-pan, to stew in their own liquor, near a gentle fire, half an hour; then pour two quarts of boiling water to the vegetables, and stew them two hours; rub down a little flour into a tea-cupful of water, boil it with the rest fifteen or twenty minutes, and serve it.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 192 the same quantity of mountain wine, the juice of two or three lemons, a pint of rich cream, and as much sugar as will make it pleasantly-flavoured. Beat it with a whisk, and put it into glasses. This cream will keep eight or ten days. Le77ion Cream, Take a pint of thick cream, and put to it the yolks of two eggs well beaten, four ounces of fine sugar, and the thin rind of a lemon; boil it up, then stir it till almost cold ; put the juice of a lemon in a dish, or bowl, and pour the cream upon it, stirring it till quite cold. Yellow Lemon-cream, without Cream. Pare four lemons very thin into twelve large spoonfuls of water, and squeeze the juice on seven ounces of finely- pounded sugar; beat the yolks of nine eg^s ivell; add the peels and juice beaten together for some time; then strain it through a flannel into a silver or very nice block-tin sauce-pan; set it over a gentle fire, and stir it one way till pretty thick, and scalding hot; but not boiling, or it will curdle. Pour it into jelly-glasses. A few lumps of sugar should be rubbed hard on the lemons before they are pared, or after, as the peel will be so thin as not to take all the essence, and the sugar will attract it, and give a better colour and flavour. White Lemon-cream is made the same as the above; only put the whites of the eggs in lieu of the yolks, whisking it extremely well to froth. Imperial Creain. Boil a quart of cream' wuth the thin rind of a lemon, then stir it till nearly cold; have ready in a dish or bowl that you are to serve in, the juice of three lemons strained with as much sugar as will sweeten the cream ; which pour into the dish from a large tea-pot, holding it high, and moving it about to mix with the juice. It should be made at least six hours before it be served, and will be still better if a day.

68 DOMESTIC COOKERY. ounces of juniper-berries, an ounce of pepper, the same quantity of allspice, an ounce of saltpetre, half an ounce of sal-prunel, a handful of common salt, and a head of shalot, all pounded or cut fine. Boil these all together a few minutes, and pour them over the ham: this quan- tity is for one of ten pounds. Rub and turn it every day, for a fortnight; then sew it up in a thin linen bag, and smoke it three weeks. Take care to drain it from the pickle, and rub it in bran, before drying. To make a Pickle that will keep for years, for Hams, Tongues, or Beef, if boiled and skimmed between each parcel of them. To two gallons of spring-water put two pounds of coarse sugar, two pounds of bay, and two pounds and a half of common salt, and half a pound of saltpetre, in a deep earthen glazed pan that will hold four gallons, and with a cover that will fit close. Keep the beef or hams as long as they will bear, before you put them into the pickle ; and sprinkle them with coarse sugar in a pan, from which they must drain. Rub the hams, &c. well with the pickle, and pack them in close; putting as much as the pan will hold, so that the pickle may cover them. The pickle is not to be boiled at first. A small ham may lie fourteen day’'s, a large one three weeks ; a tongue twelve days, and beef in proportion to its size. They will eat well out of the pickle without drying. When they are to be dried, let each piece be drained over the pan; and when it will drop no longer, take a clean spunge and dry it thoroughly. Six or eight hours wdll smoke them, and there should be only a little saw- dust and wet straw burnt to do this; but if put into a baker’s chimney', sew them in coarse cloth, and hang them a week. To dress Hams. . If long hung, put the ham into \vater anight; and let it lie either in a hole dug in the earth, or on damp stones sprinkled with water, two or three days, to m.ellow; covering it with a heavy tub, to keep vermin from it.

Tin vessels, if kept damp, soon rust, which causes holes. Fenders, and tin linings of flower-pots, &c. should be painted every year or two. Vegetables soon sour, and cortode metals and glazed red w are, by w'hich a strong poison is produced. Some years ago, the death of several gentlemen was occasioned at Salt-hill, by the cook sending a ragout to table, w hich she had kept from the preceding day in a copper vessel badly tinned. Vinegar, by its acidity, does the same, the glazing being of lead or arsenic. . I'o cool liquors in hot weather, dip a cloth in cold water, and wrap it round the bottle two or three times, then place it in the sun; renew the process once or twice. The best way of scalding fruits, or boiling vinegar, is in a stone jar on a hot iron hearth; or by putting the vessel into a saucepan of water, called a water-bath. If chocolate, coflee, jelly, gruel, bark, &c. be suffered to boil over, the strength is lost. The cook should be encouraged to be careful of coals and cinders: for the latter there is a new contrivance to sift, without dispersing the dust of the ashes, by means of a covered tin bucket. Small coal wetted makes the strongest fire for the back, but must remain untouched until it cake. Cin- ders, lightly wet, give a great degree of heat, and are better than coal for furnaces, ironing-stoves, and ovens.^

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 96 To make a Rabbit taste much like Hare. Choose one that is young, but full grown : hang it in the skin three or four clays; then skin it; and lay it, without washing, in a seasoning of black pepper and all- spice in a very hne powder, a glass of port wine, and the same c|uantity of vinegar. Baste it occasionally, for forty hours; then stuff it, and roast it as a hare, and wâ€™ith the same sauce. Do not wash off the liquor that it was soaked in. To pot Rabbits. Cut up two or three young but full-growm ones, and take the leg-bones off at the thigh ; pack them as closely as possible in a small pan, after seasoning them with pepper, mace, Cayenne, salt, and allspice, all in very fine powder. Make the top as smooth as you can. Keep out the heads and the carcasses, but take off the meat about the neck. Put a good deal of butler, and bake the w^hole gently. Keep it two days in the pan; then shift it into small pots, adding butter. The livers also should be added, as they eat well. To blanch Rabbit, Fold, ^c. Is to set it on the fire in a small quantity of cold water, and let it boil: as soon as it boils, it is to be taken out, and put into cold water for a few minutes. PART IV. SOUPS AND GRAVIES. General Directions respecting Soups and Gravies. When there is any fear of gravy-meat being spoiled before it be wanted, season w'ell, and fry it lightly, which will preserve it two days longer; but the gravy is best when the juices are fresh. When soups or gravies are to be put by, let them be changed every day into fresh scalded pans. Whatever has vegetables boiled in it, is apt to turn sour sooner than the juices of meat. Never keep any gravy, &c. in metal.

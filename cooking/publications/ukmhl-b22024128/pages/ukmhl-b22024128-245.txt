Excellent light Puffs. Mix two spoonfuls of flour, a little grated lemon-peel, some nutmeg, half a spoonful of brandy, a little loaf- sugar, and one egg; then fry it enough, but not brown; beat it in a mortar with five eggs, whites and yolks; put a quantity of lard in a frying-pan, and when quite hot, drop a dessert-spoonful of batter at a time: turn as they brown. Serve them immediately, with sweet sauce. To prepare Venison for Pasty. Take the bones out, then season and heat the meat, lay it into a stone jar in large pieces, pour upon it some plain drawn beef-gravy, but not a strong one, lay the bones on the top, then set the jar in a water-bath, that is, a saucepan of water over the fire, simmer three or four hours—then leave it in a cold place till next day. Ee- move the cake of fat, lay the meat in handsome pieces on the dish ; if not sufficiently seasoned, add more pep- per, salt, or pimento, as necessary. Put some of the gravy, and keep the remainder for the time of serving. If the venison be thus prepared, it will not require so much time to bake, or such a very thick crust, as is usual, and by which the under part is seldom done through.

The shoulder being sinewy, it will be of advantage to rub it well with sugar for two or three days, and when to be used wipe it perfectly clean from it and the wine. A mistake used to prevail, that venison could not be baked too much; but, as above directed, three or four hours in a slow'oven will be sufficient to make it tender.

DIRECTIONS TO SERVANTS. 305 When taken up for the winter, they should be rolled round a carpet-roller, and observe not to crack the paint by turning the edges in too suddenly. Old carpets answer extremely well, painted and sea- soned some months before laid down. If for passages, the width must be directed when they are sent to the manufactory, as they are cut before painting. To clean Floor-cloths. Sweep, then wdpe them with a flannel; and when all dust and spots are removed, rub with a waxed flannel, and then with a dry plain one; but use little wax, and rub only enough with the latter to give a little smooth- ness, or it may endanger falling. Washing now and then with milk after the above sweeping and dry-rubbing them, give as beautiful a look, and they are less slippery. To dust Carpets and Floors. Sprinkle tea-leaves on them, then sweep carefullv. Fine carpets should be gently done with a hair hand- brush, such as for clothes, on the knees. To clean Carpets. Take up the carpet, let it be well beaten, then laid down, and brushed on both sides with a hand-brush ; turn it the right side upwards, and scour it with ox-gall, and soap and water, very clean, and dry it with linen cloths. Then lay it on grass, or kang it up to dry. To give to Boards a beautiful appearance. After washing them very nicely clean with soda and warm w’ater, and a brush, wash them with a very large sponge and clean water. Both times, observe to leave no spot untouched ; and clean straight up and down, not crossing from board to board ; then dry with clean cloths, rubbing hard up and down in the same way. The floors sliould not be often wetted, but very tho- • roughly w^hen done; and once a week dry-rubbed with hot sand, and a heavy brush, the right way of the boards.

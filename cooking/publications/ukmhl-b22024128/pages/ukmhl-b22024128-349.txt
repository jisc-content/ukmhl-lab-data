DAIRY. 207 To preserve butter for Winter, the best way. When the butter has been prepared as above directed, take two parts of the best common salt, one part of good loaf-sugar, and one part of saltpetre, beaten and blended well together. Of this composition put one ounce to sixteen ounces of butter, and work it well together in a mass. Press it into the pans after the butter is becom^ cool; for friction, though it be not touched by the hands, will soften it. The pans should hold ten or twelve pounds each. On the top put some salt; and when that is turned to brine, if not enough to cover the butter en- tirely, add some strong salt and water. It requires only then to be covered from the dust. To manage Cream for Whey Butter. Set the whey one day and night, skim it, and so till you have enough : then boil it, and pour it into a pan or two of cold water. As the cream rises, skim it till no more comes; then churn it. Where new-milk cheese is made daily, whey butter for common and present use may be made to advantage. To scald Cream, as in the West of England. In winter let the milk stand twenty-four hours, in the summer twelve at least; then put the milk-pan on a hot hearth, if you have one; if not, set it in a wide brass kettle of wâ€™ater large enough to receive the pan. It must remain on the fire till quite hot, but on no account boil, or there will be a skim instead of cream upon the milk. You will know when done enough, by the undulations on the surface looking thick, and having a ring round the pan the size of the bottom. The time required to scald cream depends on the size of the pan and the heat of the fire; the slower the better. Remove the pan into the dairy when done, and skim it next day. In cold weather it may stand thirty-six hours, and never less than two meals. The butter is usually made in Devonshire of cream thus prepared, and if properly it is very firm. ' N 2

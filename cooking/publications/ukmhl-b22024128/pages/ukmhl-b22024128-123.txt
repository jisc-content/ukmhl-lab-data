51 VEAL. D 2 of your liand, and prepare it the same way as in the last receipt; three or four bones only will be necessary, and they will make the gravy; but if the prime part of the leg is cut olfi it spoils the whole. Fricandeau another way. Take two large round sweetbreads and prepare them as you would veal; make a rich gravy with truffles, morels, mushrooms, and artichoke-bottoms, and serve it round. Veal Olives. Cut long thin collops, beat them, lay on them thin slices of fat bacon, and over these a layer of forcemeat seasoned high, with some shred shalot and Cayenne. Roll them tight, about the size of two fingers, but not more than two or three inches long; fasten them round with a small skewer, rub egg over them, and fry them of a light brown. Serve with brown gravy, in which boil some mush- rooms pickled or fresli. Garnish with balls fried. Veal Cake. Boil six or eight eggs hard ; cut the yolks in two, and lay some of the pieces in the bottom of the pot; shake in a little chopped parsley, some slices of veal and ham, add then eggs again; shaking in after each some chop- ped parsley, with pepper and salt, till the pot is full. Then put in water enough to cover it, and lay on it about an ounce of butter ; tie it over with a double pa- per, and bake it about an hour. Then press it close to- gether with a spoon, and let it stand till cold. It may be put into a small mould; and then it will turn out beautifully for a supper or side dish. Veal Sausages. Chop equal quantities of lean veal and fat bacon, a handful of sage, a little salt and pepper, and a few an- chovies. Beat all in a mortar and when used roll and fry it, and serve it with fried sippets, or on stewed vege- tables, or on white collops.

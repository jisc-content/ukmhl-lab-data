XV a book for entering the dates; which will not only serve I to prevent overcharges, but will show the whole year’s I consumption at one view. An inventory of furniture, linen, and "china should ! be kept, and the things examined by it twice a year, or I oftener, if there be a change of servants; into each of ! whose care the articles used by him or her, should be intrusted, with a list as is done with plate. Tickets of parchment with the family name, numbered, and speci- 1 fying what bed it belongs to, should be sewed on each ' feather-bed, bolster, pillow, and blanket. Knives, forks, and house-cloths, are often deficient: these accidents 1 might be obviated, if an article at the head of every [ list required the former should be produced whole or I broken, and the marked part of the linen, though all I the others should be worn out. The inducement to ' care of glass is in some measure removed, by the in- creased price given for old flint glass.—Those who wish for trifle-dishes, butter-stands, &c. at a lower charge than cut glass, may buy them made in moulds, of w'hich there I is great variety that look extremely well, if not placed near the more beautiful articles, j The price of starch depends upon that of flour; the ; best will keep good in a dry w'arm room for some years ; therefore when bread is cheap it may be bought to ad- vantage, and covered close. Sugars being an article of considerable expense in all families, the purchase demands particular attention. The cheapest does not go so far as that more refined; and there is difference even in the degree of sweetness. The white should be chosen that is close, heavy, and shin- ing. The best sort of brown has a bright gravelly look.

4 DOMESTIC COOKEliY. Ohservations on D ressing Fish. If the fishmonger does not clean it, fish is seldom veiy nicely done; but those in great towns wash it be- yond what is necessary for cleaning, and by perpetual watering dilliinish the flavour. When quite clean, if to be boiled, some salt and a little vinegar should be put into the vVater to give firmness; but cod, whiiing, and haddock, are far better if a little salted, and kept a day ; and if not very hot weather they will be good two days. 't Those W'ho know how to purchase fish, may, by tak- ing more at a time than they want for one day, often get it cheap : and such kinds as will pot or pickle, or keep by being sprinkled with salt and hung up, or by being fried will serve for stewing the next day, may then be bought with advantage. Fresh-water fish has often a muddy smell and taste, to take olf which, soak it in strong salt and water after it is nicely cleaned; or if of a size to bear it, scald it in the same ; then dry and dress it. The fish must be put into the water wdiile cold, and set to do very gently, or the outside will break before the inner part is done.. Crimp fish should be put into boiling ivater ; and when it boils up, pour a little cold water in, to check extreme heat, and simmer it a few minutes. The fish-plate on which it is done may be drawn up, to see if it be ready ; it wall leave the bone^vhen it is.— It should tiien be immediately taken out of the water, or it will be woolly. The fish-plate should be set crossways over the kettle, to keep hot for serving ; and a clean cloth cover the fish, to prevent its losing its colour. Small fish nicely fried, covered with egg and crumbs, make a dish far mord elegant than if served plain.— Great attention should be paid to garnishing fish : use plenty of horse-radish, parsley, and lemon. When well done, and with very good sauce, fish is more attended to than almost any other dish. The liver

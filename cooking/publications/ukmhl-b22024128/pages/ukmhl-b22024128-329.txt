The first sort is shorter ; the last lighter. Hard Biscuits. Warm two ounces of butter in as much skimmed milk as will make a pound of flour into a very stiff paste, beat it with a rolling pin, and work it very smooth. Roll it thin, and cut it into round biscuits; prick them full of holes with a fork. About six minutes will bake them. Plain and very crisp Biscuits. Make a pound of flour, the yolk of an egg, and some milk, into a very stiff paste ; beat it well, and knead till quite smooth ; roll very thin, and cut into biscuits. Bake them in a slow ov^en till quite dry and crisp. PART X, HOME-BREWERY, WINES, &c. To brew very fine Welch Ale. POUR forty-two gallons of water hot, but not quite boiling, on eight bushels of malt, cover and let it stand three hours. In the mean time infuse four pounds of hops in a little hot water, and put the water and hops into the tub, and run the wort upon them, and boil them together three hours. Strain off the hops, and keep for the small beer. Let the wort stand in a high tub till cool enough to receive the yeast, of which put two quarts of ale, or, if you cannot get it, of small beer yeast. Mix it thoroughly and often. When the wort has done working, the second or third day, the yeast will sink rather than rise in the middle : remove it then, and turn the ale as it works out; pour a quart in at a time, and gently, to prevent the fermentation from con- tinuing too long, which weakens the liquor. Put a bit of paper over the bung-hole two or three days before stopping up.

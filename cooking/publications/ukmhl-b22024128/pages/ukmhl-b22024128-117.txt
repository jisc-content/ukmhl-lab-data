VEAL. 45 Knuckle of Veal, As few people are fond of boiled veal, it may be well to leave the knuckle small, and take off some cutlets or collops before it be dressed ; but as the knuckle will keep longer than the fillet, it is best not to cut off ihe slices till wanted. Break the bones to make it take less room ; wash it well; and put it into a sauce-pan with three onions, a blade of mace or two, and a few pepper-corns ; cover it with water, and simmer till quite ready. In the mean time some macaroni should be boiled with it if approved, or rice, or a little rice flour, to give it a small degree of thickness; but dofft put too much. Before it is served, add half a pint of milk and cream, and let it come up either with or without the meat. Or fry the knuckle with sliced onion and butter to a good brown; and have ready peas, lettuce, onion, and a cucumber or two. stewed in a small quantity of water an hour; then add these to the veal; and stew it till the meat is tender enough to eat, but not overdone. Throw in pepper, salt, and a bit of shred mint, and serve '^11 together. Shoulder of Veal. Cut off the knuckle, for a stew or gravy. Boast the other part for stuffing: you may lard it. Serve with melted butter. The blade-bone, with a good deal of meat left on, eats extremely well with mushroom or oyster-sauce, or mush- ' room-ketchup in butter. Neck of Veal. Cut off the scrag to boil, and cover it with onion- sauce. It should be boiled in milk and water. Parsley and butter may be served with it, instead of onion- sauce. Or it may be stewed with whole rice, small onions, and pepper-corns, with a very little water. Or boiled and eaten with bacon and greens. The best end may be either roasted, broiled as steaks, or made into pies.

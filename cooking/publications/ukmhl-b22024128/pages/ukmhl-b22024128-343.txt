DAIRY. 261 in which the cows feed. Various modes of preparing may effect a great deal; and it will be bad or good of its kind, by being in unskilful hands or the contrary; but much will still depend on the former circumstance. The same land rarely makes very fine butter, and re- markably fine cheese; yet due care may give one pretty good, where the other excels in quality. When one is not as fine as the other, attention and change of method may amend the inferior. There is usually, however, too much prejudice in the minds of dairy-people, to make them give up an old custom for one newly recommended. This calls for the eye of the superior. A gentleman has been at the expense of pro- curing cattle from every county noted for good cheese, and it is affirmed that the Cheshire, double Gloucester, North Wiltshire, Chedder, and many other sorts, are so excellent, as not to discredit their names. As the cows are all on one estate, it should seem that the mode of making must be a principal cause of the difference in flavour; besides, there is much in the size, and manner of keeping. Cheese made on the same ground, of new, skimmed, or mixed milk, will differ greatly, not in richness only, but also in taste. Those who direct a dairy in a gentle- manâ€™s family, should consider in which way it can be managed to the best advantage. Even with few cows, cheeses of value may be made from a tolerable pasture, by taking the whole of two meals of milk, and propor- tioning the thicicness of the vat to the quantity, rather than having a wide and flat one, as the former will be most mellow. The addition of a pound of fresh-made butter, of a good quality, will cause the cheese made on poor land to be of a very different quality from that usually produced by it. A few cheeses thus made, when the weather is not extremely hot, and when the cows are in full feed, will be very advantageous for the use of the parlour. Cheese for common family-use will be very well produced by

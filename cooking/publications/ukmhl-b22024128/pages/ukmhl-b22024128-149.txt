MUTTON. 75 eggs well beaten. Put it all, when well mixed, into a little pot: and use it by rolling it into balls or sausage- shape and frying. If approved, a little shalot may be added, or garlick, which is a great improvement. To dress Mutton Rujnps and Kidneys, Stew six rumps in some good mutton-gravy half art hour; then take them up, and let them stand to cool. Clear the gravy from the fat: and put into it four ounces of boiled rice, an onion stuck with cloves, and a blade of mace; boil them till the rice is thick. Wash the rumps with yolks of eggs well beaten; and strew over them crumbs of bread, a little pepper and salt, chopped parsley, and thyme, and grated lemon-peel. Fry in butter of a fine brown. While the rumps are stewing, lard the kidneys, and put them to roast in a Dutch oven. When the rumps are fried, the grease must be drained before they are put on the dish, and the pan being cleared likewise from the fat, warm the rice in it. Lay the latter on the dish ; the rumps put round on the rice, the narrow ends towards the middle, and the kidneys between. Garnish with hard eggs cut in half, the white being left on; or with dillerent coloured pickles. An excellent Hotch-potch. Stew peas, lettuce, and onions, in a very little water with a beef or ham-bone. While these are doing, fry some mutton or lamb-steaks seasoned, of a nice brown ; three quarters of an hour before dinner, put the steaks into a stew-pan, and the vegetables over them; stew them, and serve altogether in a tureen. Another.—Knuckle of veal, and scrag of mutton, stewed with vegetables as above; to both add a bit of butter rolled in flour. Mutton kebohbed. Take all the fat out of a loin of mutton, and that on the outside also if too fat, and remove the skin. Joint it at every bone: mix a small nutmeg grated with a little •alt and pepper, crumbs, and herbs; dip the steaks into £ 2

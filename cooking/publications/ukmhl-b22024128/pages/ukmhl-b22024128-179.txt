97 SOUPS. When fat remains on any soup, a tea-cupful of flour and water mixed quite smooth, and boiled in, will take it oft'.

Long boiling is necessary to give the full flavour of the ingredients, therefore time should be allowed for soups and gravies j and they are best if made the day before they are wanted. Soups and gravies are far better when the meat is put at the bottom of the pan, and stewed, and the herbs, foots, &c. with butter, than when water is put to the meat at first; and the gravy that is drawn from the meat should be almost dried up before the water is put to it.

Have ready four or five carrots, the same number of turnips, and three onions, all cut, but not small; and put them in soon enough to get quite ten- der: add four large spoonfuls of Scotch barley, first wet- F

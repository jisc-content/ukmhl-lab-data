DOMESTIC COOKERY. 130 pour in at the top, through a funnel, a few spoonfuls of good veal-gravy, and some cream to fill up; but first boil it up with a tea-spoonful of flour.

Put a little water and a little gravy into the dish, and cover it with a tolerably thick crust; bake it in a slow oven, and when done, pour into it as much gravy as it can possibly hold, and do not cut it till perfectly cold; in doing which observe to use a very sharp knife, and first cut out a large

At the top a little sprig of curled parsley may be stuck in; or^ without any thing on the dish, the salmagundy may be laid in rows, or put into the half-whites of eggs, which', may be made to stand upright by cutting off a little bit at the round end. In the latter case, each half egg has but one ingredient. Curled butter and parsley may be put as garnish between. Macaroni as usually served. Boll it in milk, or a weak veal broth, pretty well fla- voured with salt. When tender, put it into a dish with- out the liquor, and among it put some bits of butter and grated cheese, and over the top grate more, and a little more butter.

The bread should be in separated crumbs, and look light. Omlet. Make a batter c f eggs and in'Ik, and a very little flour ; put to it chopped parsley, gie n onions, or chives (the latter is best), or a very small quantity of shalot, a little

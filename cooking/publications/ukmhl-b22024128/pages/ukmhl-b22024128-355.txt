POULTRY-YARD. 275 drying them in a cool oven, which may be pursued if they are wanted before five or six months. Ducks Generally begin to lay in the month of February. Their eggs should be daily taken away except one, till they seem inclined to sit; then leave them and see that there are enough. They require no attention while sitting, except to give them food at the time they come out to seek it; and there should be water placed at a moderate distance from them, that their eggs may not be spoiled by their long absence in seeking it. Twelve or thirteen eggs are enough: in an early season it is best to set them under a hen ; and then they can be kept from water till they have a littje strength to bear it, which in very cold weather they cannot do so well. They should be put under cover, especially in a wet season; for though water is the natural element of ducks, yet they are apt to be killed by the cramp be- fore they are covered with feathers to defend them. Ducks should be accustomed to feed and rest at one place, which would prevent their straggling too far to lay. Places near the water to lay in are advantageous; and these might be small wooden houses, with a parti- tion in the middle, and a door at each end. They eat any thing: and when to be fattened, must have plenty, however coarse, and in three weeks they will be fat. Geese Require little expense ; as they chiefly support them- selves on commons or in lanes, where they can get water. The largest are esteemed best, as also are the white and grey. The pied and dark-coloured are not so good. Thirty days are generally the time the goose sits, but in warm weather she will sometimes hatch sooner. Give them plenty of food, such as scalded bran and light oats; and as soon as the goslins are hatched, keep them housed for eight or ten days, and feed them with barley-meal, bran, curds, &c. For green-geese, begin to fatten them at six or seven weeks old, and feed N 5

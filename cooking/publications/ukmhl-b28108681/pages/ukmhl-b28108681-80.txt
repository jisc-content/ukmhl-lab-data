We have just seen that the accumulations of debris and other material at the roots of the hair are prejudicial to its growth. It must not be inferred from this, however, that incessant washing of the scalp, by removing these col- lections, is a good thing. Now, it is advised by some that the hair should be wetted daily at the same time the bath is taken.

FOOD HABITS AND THEIR FAULTS. 115 are not in harmony with the climatic conditions, it would, perhaps, be well to suggest in what direction amendment should take place. A reference to the isothermal lines in any physical atlas will be of considerable value in assisting us to the elucida- tion of the subject under consideration. These are certain lines drawn over a chart of the earth’s surface, on which are located those cities and regions where the mean annual temperature is the same. Thus the mean annual tempera- ture of Sydney is 62*9° ; the corresponding line in the northern world runs through Naples and Lisbon in Europe, and a little below the central portion of the United States and California in America. At Melbourne the average yearly temperature is 57*5°, corresponding in the old world to a temperature met with at Marseilles, Bordeaux, the south of France and Northern Italy, while across the Atlantic a somewhat similar climate obtains about the middle of the United States. The mean annual temperature at Brisbane is 67,74°; this is the same as that of Algiers and the southern shores of the Mediterranean generally, and coin- cides with that met with in New Orleans and the southern states of North America. At Adelaide the average yearly temperature is 63T°, and the climate is considered to greatly resemble that of Sicily. Now, no other mode that I am aware of, such as this juxtaposition of localities where the mean annual temperature is the same, will afford such a convenient way of contrasting the mode of living which is practised in Australia with that which is followed by the inhabitants of the regions referred to in Europe. The cardinal difference, and one which stands out in bold relief, is that the Australian food habits are characterised by a preponderancy of meat diet and a corresponding neglect of vegetable products. On the other hand, the dietary of Southern Europe is in rational harmony with its climate,

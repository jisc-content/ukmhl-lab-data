FISH AND OYSTERS—THEIR FOOD VALUE. 131 “ food fishes which we exhibit, were not less surprised at “ our very limited materials and methods of capture than at “ the immense undeveloped wealth of our fisheries and fish “ fauna.” Now, I venture to say that a more unconsciously subtle insinuation at the crude methods of fish capture at present employed in our Australian fisheries was never penned. But what makes it so keenly effective is that it really hits the right nail on the head. In giving evidence, also, before Mr. Frank Farnell’s select committee of 1889, Dr. Ramsay, upon being asked whether he thought our fishermen were abreast of the times with regard to appli- ances, replied :—“ They are about 200 years behind the times.” To my mind another most convincing proof of the crude methods of fish capture employed in Australian waters is to be found in the following. In one of the Fisheries Reports it is gravely recorded that “ some very “ valuable gear in general use amongst English, Norwegian, “ and American fishermen, had been destroyed in the “ Garden Palace fire, but that the Commissioners had been “ able to replace the otter-trawl and the beam-trawl.” The very fact that these appliances, in active use at the present time by those in the foremost front of fishery enterprise, are regarded in the light of curiosities in Australia, proves only too forcibly the correctness of this opinion as to our primitive fishery appliances. THE BEAM-TRAWL IN DEEP-SEA FISHING. It must not be imagined that trawling has never been ad- vocated (indeed, it has even been experimentally practised), for we have only to look through the various Fisheries Reports to find it repeatedly referred to ; unfortunately, however, these appeals so far have been without any practi- cal results. It will, therefore, be most instructive to refer

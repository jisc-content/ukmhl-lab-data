150 THE ART OF LIVING IN AUSTRALIA. oysters and the drift oysters, are quite different, and, as it will be seen, believes that they require different food. It can be well understood from this, then, that rock oysters will fail to grow on drift-oyster beds. As to the mud oyster, he thinks very highly of it, and regrets that it has been so ignored by our oyster culturists. He is quite sure that if our mud oyster were cultivated and educated as it is’ now in Europe, it would be brought to the same perfection as the European and American oyster. It has been said of our mud oyster that it will not keep, and will not carry ; but the same was said of its European representative until its cultivators came to dis- cover that by a gradual process of raising it could be educated to keep quite long enough for all commercial purposes. To come to the real point on which Dr. Cox considers that all oyster culture has failed in Australian waters. It is an established fact that the drift oyster and also the mud oyster require a diatomatic food for their existence. These two varieties of oysters no doubt consume other forms of food, but living diatoms constitute by far the greatest part. On the contrary, the rock oyster does, not appear to need the diatomatic nutriment to any extent, and is fed chiefly by larval forms of marine life. Thus, knowing that the drift and mud oysters require different food from the rock oyster, it is easy to see why our oyster culturists have failed in establishing new beds of oysters in various places. For the whole purport of Dr. Cox’s paper may be summarised into expressing his belief that sufficient attention has not been devoted to the replenishment of our natural beds, ivith their own hind. In former days, when our drift and mud oysters were in their prime, there were many pools of naturally pre- served fresh water—in fact, often very extensive lakes—

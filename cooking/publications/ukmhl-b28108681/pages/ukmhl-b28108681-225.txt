181 AUSTRALIAN WINE. that before these lines see the light of day what is now proposed will be an accomplished fact. The next most notable occurrence in the history of Australian viticulture is undoubtedly the action of James Busby, who in 1828, says Mr. T. A. Coghlan in his Wealth and Progress of Neiv South Wales, “ returned from Europe 44 with a large collection of cuttings from the most cele- 44 brated vineyards of France, Spain, the Rhine valley, and 44 other parts of the continent of Europe, and started, on 44 his estate at Kirkton, in the Hunter River district, a 44 vineyard which has been the nursery of the principal 44 vineyards of the Colony.” This was a more important event than would be imagined from a bare recital of the fact, for Busby has conferred upon Australian wines a high quality for all time to come in this way. His collection of cuttings from the best of the vineyards in Europe consisted of the choicest varieties or 44 cepages,” and this has been a matter for congratulation ever since. Fuller reference, however, will be made to this important subject a little farther on. What is certainly interesting also is that Busby was so impressed with the future of the Australian wine industry that in 1830 he published his Manual of Plain Directions for Planting and Cultivating Vineyards, and for Malting Wine, in New South Wales; and, as I have just said, the high qualities of our wines are due to him alone, so that the name of James Busby must always be gratefully remembered by all Australians. It makes one think that these sturdy pioneers of former times had a greater belief in Australia and her possibilities, and more energy and foresight, than are apparently possessed nowadays. But while I am on the subject of the literature of Australian viticulture I must not forget to mention an excellent little pamphlet by James King in 1857, entitled, Australia may be an extensive Wine-growing Country.

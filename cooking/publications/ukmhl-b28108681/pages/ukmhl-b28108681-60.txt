THE ART OF LIVING IN AUSTRALIA. 16 were in the beginning of the month seven consecutive days above 100° (maximum 107*5°). In the middle of the same month, seven days were over 90°, of which five exceeded 100°, two days reaching 113*7°. These are, however, exceptions to our usual experience. Although there are several other instances of great heat, yet the foregoing will suffice to show what we occasionally suffer without much harm being done. Queensland.—During the period February 17th to February 23rd, 1891, the shade temperature at Townsville ranged between 81° and 62°, but at Cairns a range bet ween 82° and 70° is of frequent occurrence, within at least fort- nightly periods. Any information ivith regard to the humidity of the atmo- sphere, also, will he of great value. All physicians are of opinion that a high temperature, combined ivith moisture, is very irritating to the lungs of those affected ivith pulmonary disease. Before setting forth the different answers in response to this, it will be desirable to refer briefly to the term “ hu- midity.” The humidity of the atmosphere is defined as the degree of its approach to saturation. Air completely saturated is represented by 100, and that absolutely free of vapour by 0. As a matter of fact, however, the latter never occurs; even in the driest regions of Arabia a humidity of 10 per cent, is almost unknown. For its estimation the Wet and Dry Bulb thermo- meters are employed. These consist of two ordinary thermo- meters. One has its bulb exposed so as to register the temperature of the air. The bulb of the other is covered with muslin; this latter material being kept wet through its connection with a cotton wick dipping into a vessel of water. The water ascends from this vessel by capillary attraction, spreads over the muslin, and evaporates quickly

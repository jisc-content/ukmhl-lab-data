They are then blanched, and when cooked recall somewhat the flavour of the globe artichoke. These tender leaf-stalks are used in soups and salads, and it may be boiled also in a similar manner to sea-kale, in which latter form it is especially palatable. The celeriac or turnip-rooted celery is a very choice vege- table, and is much cultivated on the Continent. Its nutty root is not at all unlike the solid root portion of common celery in taste, which by many is considered superior in flavour to the other parts of the latter plant.

In aubergines farcies, a favourite dish, they are cut in halves, the centres chopped and put back into the skins with oil, &c. They are then sprinkled with bread- crumbs, and browned.

THE ART OF LIVING IN AUSTRALIA. 52 In addition to their texture or permeability to air, and to their conducting or non-conducting powers, fabrics also vary according to their hygroscopic qualities. By hygro- scopic is meant the power of absorbing moisture ; thus a thin flannel is. one of the coolest materials we can have, for it absorbs perspiration ; while linen, which is non-hygroscopic, when moist allows the fluid to evaporate rapidly, and thus cools the body too quickly, and there- fore dangerously. Hence flannel is a most suitable fabric in which to take exercise, as there is less danger of taking a chill. There are four chief materials to be considered in con- nection with clothing, namelyâ€”cotton and linen, which belong to the vegetable kingdom, and silk and wool, which are obtained from the animal world. These four, either in their own form or else in combination with each other, such as merino, constitute most of our wearing apparel. Cotton is the fine, soft, downy material of a hairy nature which is found on the seeds of a certain plant, the cotton plant, which belongs to the mallow family. Its fibres are flattened in shape, and are twisted at intervals. The form of the fibres has an important effect in the action of cotton material on the skin. Being of a flattened shape, they have sharp edges, which in delicate skins are apt to cause irritation. Cotton wears well, it is not absorbent of moisture nearly to the same extent as linen, nor does it conduct away the heat of the body so quickly as the latter, hence it is a warmer material than linen. On the other hand, it does not retain the heat against the body like wool, and is an appropriate material for dress in hot climates. In merino there is a mixture of about one-fifth to one-half part of wool with cotton. Linen, the other product of the vegetable kingdom, is obtained from the fibres of the common flax. Its fibres,

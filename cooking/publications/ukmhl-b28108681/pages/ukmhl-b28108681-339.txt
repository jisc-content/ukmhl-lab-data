295 COOKERY RECIPES, $c. Bake the fish in the oven, unless there is cold fish in the larder, which will do just as well; take away the skin and bone, and flake it up. Make a sauce of the butter, flour, and milk ; season with anchovy, pepper, salt, and lemon juice ; stir in the fish and mix well. Line some small patty pans with flaky pastry, put a spoonful of the mixture in the centre, cover with a round of pastry, press the edges together, and trim into a neat shape ; make a small hole in the centre with a skewer, brush over with egg or milk, put into a quick oven, and bake for about twenty minutes. Dish on a fancy paper, and garnish each patty with a tiny sprig of parsley. FISH, TO FRY. Fish requires careful preparation for successful frying ; it may be filleted or fried whole, but in either case it must be well washed in cold water, but not soaked ; dry in a cloth. Mix on a plate a spoonful of flour, pepper, and salt. Beat on another plate an egg, with a spoonful each of water and oil, and have plenty of dry fine crumbs on a sheet of paper ; when these things are all ready, dip the fish in the flour and dust off again ; put at once into the egg and cover well; then drop into the crumbs, shake them all over it ; next toss in the hands to shake all the loose crumbs off; lay on a plate separately, and either fry at once or leave in a cool place for an hour or two. Plunge into plenty of hot fat and fry till crisp and brown ; drain for a few minutes on kitchen paper ; pile on a dish, and garnish with either fresh or fried parsley. CURRIED FISH. 3 Bream Is.

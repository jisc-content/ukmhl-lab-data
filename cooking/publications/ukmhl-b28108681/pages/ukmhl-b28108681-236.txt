192 THE ABT OF LIVING IN AUSTBALIA. It will be evident from the preceding that the greatest discrimination is necessary in the selection of the variety for any particular region; and from the knowledge at present at the vine-grower’s command he can do no more than form an approximate opinion of the “ cepage ” likely to suit his locality best. It is recommended, therefore, that new planters, before starting their vineyards, should care- fully observe what varieties are giving the best results at any neighbouring vineyards ; if some appear to be doing better than others, they should stick to the successful kinds. And again, it is advisable that they should be chary of what plants other vine-growers extol, when perhaps the latter are in another part of the country altogether and under totally different conditions of climate and soil. Instead of com- mitting themselves to a large purchase, therefore, they should plant a selection of several varieties, and find out those which are the most suitable. THE GROWING OF THE GRAPE—THE PREPARATION OF THE SOIL. It is not my purpose to enter fully into the entire sub- ject of grape-growing, for that is too extensive to be dealt with here; nevertheless, there are many points about it of Australian concern, over which there has been considerable discussion. This shows that our vignerons, instead of placidly following out old lines, are determined to find out for themselves the methods which will give the best results. That such a spirit is in active existence is unquestionably a source of satisfaction to those who have the welfare of Australian viticulture at heart, for it is only by a deter- mination to find out the best course to be pursued in the many points connected with grape-growing, and more espe- cially with wine-making, that we can hope to reach per- fection.

THE ART OF LIVING IN AUSTRALIA. 40 It is quite deplorable to see what little interest people take in the preservation of their teeth ; even those who should know better are in too many instances quite as neglectful. But the teeth play a very important part in the thorough division of food, and if this be not ensured the health is bound to suffer. They should be kept scrupulously clean, therefore, and the formation of tartar prevented. These two objects are best accomplished by their thorough cleansing with a moderately stiff brush. Too soft a brush is insufficient for the purposes of removing the accumula- tions which collect upon the teeth. A tooth-powder or dentifrice of some kind will also be required. One of the simplest, and possibly also one of the very best, is composed of the following : Powdered borax . . ^ an ounce. Powdered orris root . . 1 ounce. Powdered white Castile soap \ of an ounce. Precipitated chalk . . 3 ounces. Oil of cloves . . .2 drops. Oil of winter green . . 6 drops. This leaves nothing to be desired, and will be found satis- factory in every respect. It is customary to dip the tooth-brush into water, so as the better to enable it to take up the dentifrice. But it will be found an advantage if, after dipping the brush into water, it then be rubbed once or twice over a piece of white Castile soap. It will by this means pick up a larger amount of the powder. The teeth should be attended to after each meal, although cleansing them the last thing at night is an im- portant duty, never on any account to be neglected. It must not be imagined, however, that even the foregoing is suffi- cient. Particles of food, which the brush fails to remove, collect between the teeth, and, if allowed to remain, ulti- mately lead on to decay. This is most likely to occur when

AUSTRALIAN WINE. 245 Colleges indispensable, how much more must a young country, with its wine industry quite undeveloped, need them ! It must with confidence be said, therefore, that Australia cannot do without these Yiticultural Colleges. Something has already been done by the establishment of Agricul- tural Colleges, and this is most commendable. But what I believe is this, that a wine-grower must be a wine-grower and nothing else. To know everything connected with the growth of the grape and cellar management thoroughly is quite enough for any ordinary man to attempt to master. Therefore viticulture must either be made a distinctly separate course at the Agricultural Colleges ; or, what is better still, Yiticultural Colleges must be established for the purpose alone. At Montpellier, in France, the course of viticultural education is elaborately comprehensive, and includes the study of the anatomy of the vine, its flowers, leaves, seeds, &c. The pupils become thoroughly acquainted with every variety of vine in practical form; they see it grow, learn the art of pruning, and of everything pertaining to the growth of the vine. They also master all the details con- nected with grafting, the laying out of vineyards, the diseases to which the vine is liable, and the remedies which are most effectual. And, in addition, there is minute in- struction in every step in cellar management and the after care and treatment of the wine itself, from the start to the finish. In this way the subject is studied from a thoroughly scientific standpoint, with a result that influences for good the whole of French viticulture. But if the benefits derived from the establishment of Yiticultural Colleges in France are thus remarkable, those which have followed their introduction into Italy are nothing less than wonderful.

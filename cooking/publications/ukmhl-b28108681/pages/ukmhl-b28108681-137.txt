SCHOOL COOKERYâ€”INFLUENCE ON DAILY LIFE. 93 tant New South Wales requires annually 7*8 lbs.; Victoria, 7*7 lbs.; South Australia, 6*5 lbs.; and Queensland 8*4 lbs.; and moreover, that West Australia attains a maximum with 10*6 lbs. Now, according to Mulhall, in his Dictionary of Statistics, the amount of tea consumed annually for each inhabitant in the United Kingdom is only 5 lbs.; and for the United States of America the proportion is but 1*5 lbs. A survey of these figures consequently must compel us to admit that Australia is inhabited by a people largely carnivorous and addicted to tea. Surely not one person in a thousand would advocate such a diet under any circumstances. Is it not astonishing, therefore, that in- nutritious fare of this kind is still tolerated in Australia ? Facts such as these call for the most serious consideration, since they must irresistibly affect the national life ; but though it may seem strange, these matters have never received the notice they stand in need of, if, indeed, they have ever received any notice at all. There are worlds of interest, however, centred in the notable circumstance that Australia, a new and a semi- tropical country, is now being peopled by the descendants of those who belonged to an entirely different climate. At the present time the old racial instincts are actively power- ful, and exert an influence diametrically opposed to climatic surroundings ; and, as a matter of fact, we are witnessing a struggle between our Anglo-Saxon heredities and our Australian environment. But such a conflict against our destiny is one in which the odds are overwhelmingly on one side. For of all forces, that of climate is the most powerful. It is true that man is able almost to remove mountains, and that he can create rivers in an arid land ; but to endeavour to resist the dominating influence of climate is to attempt the impossible.

THE ALPHABETICAL PENTAGON OF HEALTH. 23 Criminelle ”; and finally, the Code Penal.” It is recorded that Napoleon was prouder of this than of his victories. “ I shall go down to posterity,” he said, “ with my Code in my hand.” The best proof of its excellence is that to-day it remains in force as the law of France (though it has been re-christened the “ Code Civil ” under the Republic), and that it has been the model for many Continental Codes, notably Belgium, Italy, and Greece. But, leaving these references to the many associations attached to the number five, it must not be supposed that my desire is to make people unnecessarily timorous about themselves on the score of health. This is certainly not my intention, for such a frame of mind would defeat the very object I have in view. Yet there still remains the fact that a little rational attention is indispensable if the vigour of the body is to be maintained at its best. There is a very great difference between carefulness carried to extremes in this respect, on the one head, and a heedlessness and total disregard of personal health, on the other. The golden mean between these two is the proper knowledge of what is required for the preservation of health, and so much con- formity thereto as will give the best results. And yet it must be remembered that no cast-iron code can be laid down which would be applicable to one and all. No; idio- syncrasy, that personal peculiarity which makes each individual different from every one else, is too potent a factor to be ignored. In matters of this kind, each one, to a certain extent, is a law unto himself, and, consequently, what agrees and what disagrees is only discoverable by the individual concerned. In what follows, therefore, I have endeavoured to lay down rules for guidance which will be beneficial to by far the greatest number; although this element of the ego must never be forgotten.

173 SALADS, $c. divided leaves, which are aromatic, and which are thus absolutely a necessary component of any well-ordered salad. The plant will grow everywhere, and, as it is never seen, it is only one instance out of the many which might be ad- duced, that much is neglected in Australian cultivation which would be of advantage to the whole community.

It is recommended, however, that the young plants should be propagated each year by division of the

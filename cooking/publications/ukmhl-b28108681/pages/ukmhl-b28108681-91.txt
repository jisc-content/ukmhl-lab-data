How many people ignorantly “ favour its occurrence by confining themselves to closely- “ shut, non-ventilated, stuffy, stifling rooms, in which the “ carbonic acid has accumulated to a poisonous degree in “ the air they respire ! How are these evil results to be “ prevented ? The simple answer is, let the rooms in “ wdiich you live be effectively ventilated by an incoming “ current of fresh air, and so arranged that no draught “ shall be felt.” Sanitarians avIio have devoted a good deal of time and study to the working out of questions relating to the amount of fresh air in bedrooms have decided that each person should, if possible, have at least 1,000 cubic feet of space, or in other words, the same amount contained in a room 10 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 10 feet high. It is also estimated that the amount of fresh air entering into a room of this size should be 3,000 cubic feet per hour, that is, the air in each room should be completely changed three times every hour. These observations of course apply only to the least amount of air which every sleeper is strictly entitled to.

The practical point to discover is how to have this con-

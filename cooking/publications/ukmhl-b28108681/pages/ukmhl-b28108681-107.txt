It consists of minute bodies, the corpuscles, immersed in a liquid, the liquor sanguinis. Salts also enter into its composition, and in- clude the chlorides of potash and soda; the phosphates of lime, magnesia, and soda ; the sulphate of potash, and free soda. Of these the salts of soda predominate, and the

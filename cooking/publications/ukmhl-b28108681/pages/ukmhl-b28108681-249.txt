AUSTRALIAN WINE. 205 that the must produced in Australia is equal, if not superior, to any in the world. Now, all that follows this portion relates to wine-making alone; and it should for that very reason, therefore, possess a special interest for us. Moreover, it will be a good thing for the wine industry, for Australia, and for her people, when such an interest becomes part of our daily life. Naturally the first thing to suggest itself, therefore, in the making of the wine, is the place in which it is made. There is no doubt that in Australia the importance of a proper cellar has never been sufficiently appreciated. But the French have a proverb, “ the cellar makes the wine,” show- ing that it plays no inconsiderable part in the production of good wine. As Mr. Walter W. Pownall, the representa- tive of the Australian Wine Company, explained before the Yegetable Products Commission in Victoria, a knowledge of cellar routine and cellar work would avoid the spoiling of much good wine. A man thinks when he has grown the wine that is all that is necessary. But the fact is, a wine- grower has never done with his wine till it has passed out of his hands. There was a valuable pamphlet on Australian wines written by the late Doctor Bleasdale, of Melbourne, in 1876. It is now out of print, and regrettedly so, for the worthy Doctor was one of the best connoisseurs of wine Australia ever had. Mr. L. Bruck, the well-known medical publisher of Sydney, however, has placed me under considerable obliga- tion by giving me his own copy, and in the preface therein I note that the author, in speaking of this very question, remarks :—“ I would here reiterate what I have often stated, “ namely, that if the cellar management in the three colonies “ were equal to the magnificent produce of the vines, no “ country on the earth could surpass, in quality and variety “ of kinds, Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales.”

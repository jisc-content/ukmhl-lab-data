THE CLIMATE OF AUSTRALIA. 9 Having thus compared the summer and winter tempera- tures of the Australian capitals with those of other cities in different parts of the world, it will be advisable to direct our attention to some details connected with the climate of these capitals, and of the corresponding colonies generally. Com- mencing with Sydney we find that the climate is charac- terized by the absence of very violent changes of tempera- ture, owing in great measure to its proximity to the ocean, which in winter is about 10째 warmer than the air. Its summer climate is marked by the absence of hot winds, which do not come more than three or four times, and then are short-lived, seldom lasting more than five or six hours. For a short time in the midsummer of each year, Sydney is visited regularly by moist sea breezes, which are enervating to many persons. While these continue the temperature seldom rises to 80째, but there is so much moisture that they are very oppressive. Otherwise the climate is one of the most enjoyable in the world. In other parts of Hew South Wales towns may be found varying in mean tempera- ture from 45*8째 at Kiandra to 69*1째 at Bourke. Speak- ing generally it is a fact that for the same mean annual temperature in Hew South Wales the range be- tween summer and winter temperature is less than it is in Europe. The climate of Melbourne is characterized by a low average humidity, moderate rainfall, and moderate winds, strong gales being of rather rare occurrence. The most marked feature is the summer hot wind. A hot wind is always a northerly wind, and the highest temperature generally occurs a little before the wind changes to west or south-west. When this takes place a sudden drop to a comparatively low temperature sometimes follows within a few minutes. These hot winds, however, are not frequent, only averaging eight or nine per annum. These charac-

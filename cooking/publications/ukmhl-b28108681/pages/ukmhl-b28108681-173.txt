FISH AND OYSTERS—THEIR FOOD VALUE. 129 of the public. Now, I am quite willing to admit that there should be proper supervision over the working of the Fisheries Acts, and that existing grievances should be recti- fied ; but, with all due deference, it seems to me that the finger has not been placed on the exact reason why failure occurs in our fish supply. For I say this, that you may do what you will to protect and supervise the shore and inland fisheries, and you may even increase the yield from these sources to an encouraging extent, but that till the deep-sea work is thoroughly taken up and properly developed there will be no cheap fish for Australia. It has been stated that if the deep-sea fisheries of the United Kingdom fell through from any reason, half-a-million of its inhabitants would be brought face to face with starvation. And even these enormous figures include only the fisher-folk them- selves, and do not take into account the vast army of buyers, curers, dealers, &c., who are dependent for their very exist- ence upon the fishing industry. Take away the deep-sea fisheries from the old country, and its whole fish supply would practically be at an end. In the same way by the development of our Australian deep-sea fisheries—and by the development of the deep-sea fisheries only—will it be pos- sible, in my humble opinion, to increase the supply and cheapen the price of fish so that it will form part of the dietary in every dwelling. There was an important select committee appointed by the Victorian Government, a short time ago, to inquire into the unsatisfactory condition of the fishing industry there. It examined a great number of witnesses, and its investiga- tions extended over a large area. Amongst other things, with a view of encouraging trawling operations, it was suggested— “ That a careful survey he made of the sea-bottom in the neighbour- hood of our coasts and in Bass’ Straits, and the part suitable for S. 1003.

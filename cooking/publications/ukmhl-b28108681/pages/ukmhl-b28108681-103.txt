The value of fat, in any of its many forms, in promoting the health of the body and preventing the onset of wasting diseases is hardly appre- ciated, and besides this action it markedly serves to nourish the brain and nervous system. Dr. Murchison, the late eminent physician, was wont to declare that bacon fat or ham fat was worth a guinea an ounce in the treat- ment of wasting diseases.

It would require a person with the stomach of an ostrich to digest, to say nothing of relish, such an oleaginous compound during our hot months. But if this necessary and all-important article of diet can be presented in an appetising shape, what a desirable result is achieved ! The mass of the people—I am not referring to those who are wTell endowed with worldly gifts—are apt to look upon the ice chest as a luxury which is altogether beyond their means.

The former would take it with great avidity, and the benefit to health resulting therefrom

Indeed, as far as they are concerned, there are many who believe that these ethereal oils have more to do with the characteristic properties of coffee than even the caffeine itself. And, lastly, there are the acids known as caffeo-tannic and caffeic acids, which are modified forms of tea tannin. They exist to a far less extent, however, than does the tannin in tea. Coffee has a decidedly stimulating effect upon the nervous system; so much so that in France it has been called une boisson intellectuelle (an intellectual beverage), from its stimu- lating all the functions of the brain. Not so long ago a writer, Dr. J. N. Lane, in the British Medical Journal gave some interesting information with respect to coffee and brain work. As the result of his own experience he recommended “ a cup of strong coffee, without cream or sugar, preceded “ and followed by a glass of hot water every morning before “ breakfast. The various secretions are thus stimulated, “ the nerve force aroused, no matter how the duties of the “ preceding day and night may have drawn upon the sys- “ tern. Another cup at four in the afternoon is sufficient to “ sustain the energies for many hours.” It is only fair to add, however, that the Journcd went on to remark that in this way some 50 grains of caffeine would be taken each week, and that very little more might develop injurious symp- toms, so that the power of doing an illimitable amount of work would be obtained under somewhat risky conditions. One of its most remarkable effects is that of relieving the feeling of fatigue or exhaustion, whether this be pro- duced by brain work or bodily labour. It enables the sys- tem also to bear up under an empty stomach and when the supply of food is shortened. In this way it is of signal value to the soldier in the field. Professor E. A. Parkes, an admitted authority on these matters, bears testimony to the fact that in military service it invigorates the system and is

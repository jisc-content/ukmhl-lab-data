184 THE ART OF LIVING IN AUSTRALIA. the whole subject of Australian viticulture is one of tre- mendous importance ; and I am strongly of opinion that practical results will only be brought about by awakening in the mind of the Australian public an active interest in every- thing connected with this, though yet undeveloped, great wine industry. With that object in view, therefore, it will be my endeavour to bring forward those main points of viti- culture which it is most desirable should be widely known. But such an attempt, to be successful, must largely depend upon the arrangement which is adopted, for it is impossible to do more than take up the principal matters concerned with the space which is at my disposal. The scheme which has been devised will, it is hoped, help to a clear under- standing of the subject. THE CLIMATE. If there is one reason more than any other why the wine industry should surely reach to colossal dimensions, it is that the climate is naturally adapted for the cultivation of the vine. Although human effort and human skill can over- come what looked to be almost insuperable difficulties, they cannot, as we know, fight against climate. Hence, having a climate created, as it were, for the growth of the grape, there can be no possible excuse offered for its neglect. Indeed, as I have already shown, the suitableness of the climate for this purpose directly attracted the attention of the first arrivals, and as a consequence the vine was actually planted a few years after the discovery of Australia. There are three constituents, namely, heat, light, and moisture, which in varying proportions make up what is known as climate. The first two, heat and light, are derived from the same source—the sun—and may, therefore, be conveniently considered together. The more heat and light a vine receives the more vigorously it grows. What is

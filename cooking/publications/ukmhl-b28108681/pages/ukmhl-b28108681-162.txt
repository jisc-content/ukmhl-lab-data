THE ART OF LIVING IN AUSTRALIA. 118 from time to time, no notice seems to be taken of them whatever. I propose, therefore, briefly to describe some of these comparatively unknown vegetables, and to point out their merits and their claims for recognition. The globe artichoke might be more frequently grown, as it is really a good vegetable and easily cooked. It con- stitutes the flower head of the Cynara scolymus (one of the thistle family), and is gathered before the flowers expand. The ends of the flower scales attached to the disc, and the central disc itself, are the parts that are eaten, and they con- stitute a delicately-flavoured vegetable. It is extensively cultivated in California, and is there to be met with in nearly all hotels and restaurants. Another thing in its favour is that it is peculiarly one of the vegetables which diabetics may indulge in without fear. It does well in the cooler parts of Australia, and should certainly be more generally grown. The Jerusalem artichoke is not to be confused with the preceding, as it belongs to a different vegetable genus alto- gether. It is a species of sunflower, as its name denotes, the prefix Jerusalem being in reality a corruption of the Italian word Girasole, a sunflower. It resembles the potato in that it is a tuberous-rooted vegetable, and grows readily enoughâ€”in fact, perhaps it grows too readily, for once it takes possession of the soil it is difficult to eradicate it. The Jerusalem artichoke, however, is comparatively common here, and when cooked properly it is a most delightful vege- table, although it may not be sufficiently appreciated at first. It often happens that these artichokes are of a bad colour, and too crisp when brought to table. This is easily pre- vented, however, by washing and paring them like potatoes and then placing them in a bowl of clear water, to which a few drops of fresh lemon juice have been added. When boiled with sufficient water to just cover them, and a liberal

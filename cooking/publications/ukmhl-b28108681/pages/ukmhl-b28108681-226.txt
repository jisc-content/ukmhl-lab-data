THE ART OF LIVING IN AUSTRALIA. 182 Indeed, James King was another of those far-seeing men who were convinced that there was a great future for the Australian wine industry; moreover, he did a good deal in the way of developing it by cultivating the grape and by making wine. Now, there are certain figures connected with vine- growing and the consumption of wine which possess a great value in relation to Australian viticulture, inasmuch as they enable us to see more clearly its relative progress, and, what is more, they indicate its future possibilities. It is only by methods of this kind that we are enabled to form an accurate estimate of the condition of any industry. And besides this, too, they act as a stimulus to increased exertion. But it will be still more interesting and instruc- tive to make a comparison between the little which has been done in wine production and the almost incredible proportions of our wool industry. And when it is remem- bered that there was nothing to prevent the wine trade from attaining a magnitude very like to that of wool, it will be seen what magnificent opportunities have thus far been practically thrown away. At present the whole of Australia annually produces only a little more than three million gallons of wine, while the yearly yield of France is 795 ; of Italy, 798 ; of Spain, 608 ; of Hungary, 185 ; and of Portugal, 132 million gallons. And another thing is that the whole of the five colonies of Australia and Tasmania have altogether no more than 48,099 acres under vine cultivation. The total amount of wine made in the six foregoing colonies for the year ending March 31st, 1892, was only 3,604,262 gallons. The city of Paris itself requires nearly 300,000 gallons of wine daily, so that this single city would consume in 12 days all the wine which the whole of Australia takes 12 months to make. So far back as 1875 the production of wine in France alone

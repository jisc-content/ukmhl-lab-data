6 THE ART OF LIVING IN AUSTRALIA. but that the Anglo-Saxon thinks there is only one way of living in every part of the worldâ€”no matter whether the climate be tropical, semi-tropical, or frigid. Those in the old country live in a certain manner, and all the rest of the globe have every right to follow their example. These two facts that Australia was peopled in part by the influx which followed the discovery of gold, and that its inhabitants belong essentially to the Anglo-Saxon race, have unquestionably exercised a great influence over our Aus- tralian food-habits. But notwithstanding these powerful underlying factors, there still remains that most extraordi- nary circumstance, to which I at first referred, namely, that the Australian people have never realized their semi-tropical environment. In order to assign to this latter the promi- nence it deserves, it seems desirable to make special inquiry into the peculiarities of the climate in its different parts. With that object in view, therefore, I wrote for certain information to the observatories of the four principal Australian metropolitan centres, namely, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Brisbane. As has always been the case, I received the fullest answers to my requests from Mr. H. C. Bussell, Government Astronomer of New South Wales; from Mr. B. L. J. Ellery, Government Astronomer of Victoria ; from Sir Charles Todd, Government Observer of South Australia ; and from Mr. Clement L. Wragge, Govern- ment Meteorologist of Queensland. And it is with a feeling of considerable indebtedness to these gentlemen that I acknowledge their uniform kindness. And yet it is important to remember that the annual temperature, by itself, of any given locality may afford no indication what- ever of its climatic peculiarities. Take for instance the climate of the North-Eastern portion of the United States. That region is characterized by intense heat during the summer, and extreme oold in the winter. In New York,

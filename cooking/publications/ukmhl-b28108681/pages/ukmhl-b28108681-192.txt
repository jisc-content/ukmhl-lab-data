148 THE ART OF LIVING IN AUSTRALIA. present Act) there was a reversal to the old system of long leases and larger holdings. Even at the present time mat- ters are far from perfect, and in the opinion of the Com- missioners of Fisheries some radical change is necessary if oyster production is to have a place at all. Now, it is true that the present Act has checked the wholesale exter- mination of oysters on the part of licensed dredgers. But, unfortunately, in its passage through Parliament, some un- happy amendments totally altered the intention of the Bill. For instance, one clause makes it penal to remove oysters from a reserve or leased area without authority ; but omits the protection of oysters on adjoining foreshores which may not be under lease at all; and it has accordingly happened that unprincipled persons have proceeded to rob the adjacent unleased beds of every single oyster they contained. But while faulty and inoperative legislation may be re- sponsible in part for the failure in our oysteries, it is certain that other causes must be at work to bring about such a disastrous result. And in the different annual reports on the fisheries of the colony this is attributed to various reasons. Thus at some places, between the Richmond and Port Macquarie, it has been set down to the presence of quantities of decomposing sea-weed on the oyster beds; in the Manning to deposits of mud and sand ; and elsewhere again to the ravages of a small worm. Besides these causes, too, it has been ascribed to the long continued absence of floods, with a consequent increased salinity of the waterâ€” the latter being considered inimical to oyster life. In the opinion of scientific writers, water containing 3 per cent, of salt is most suitable for oyster development, water above that salinity being too strong, and that below it too weak. It has also been well pointed out by Mr. Henry Woodward, in his admirable pamphlet on Oyster Culture in New

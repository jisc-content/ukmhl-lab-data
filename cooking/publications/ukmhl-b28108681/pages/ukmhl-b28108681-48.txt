4 THE ABT OF LIVING IN AITS THALIA. that the inhabitants of different regions adapt themselves to their surroundings. For instance, the Laplander and the Hindoo live in such a widely different manner, that one can scarcely believe they belong to the same human family. It has, however, been reserved for Australia, strange even from the first, to prove an exception to this universal law. Yes, strange even from the first! For did not the earliest arrivals find that the seasons came at the wrong time of the year ; that Christmas-tide came with sunshine, and that the middle of the year was its coolest part ? Were there not found in it curious animals, partly quadruped, partly bird, and partly reptile ? Were there not discovered, also, other animals who carried their young in a pouch ? Moreover, did not these first settlers see that the trees shed their bark, and not their leaves ; and that the stones were on the out- side, not the inside, of the cherries ? But even admitting these peculiarities of season, of fauna and of flora, it may be asked, How is it that the people of Australia have never adapted themselves to their climatic surroundings ? The answer, or rather answers, to such an interrogation must largely consist of matters of opinion. This being the case, therefore, I can do no more than attempt to give my own explanation of this singular anomaly. It must be remembered that the one great impetus to colonisation in Australia was the discovery of gold in 1851. Up till that time settlement had been pro- ceeding steadily, it is true. Indeed, one may go so far as to say that the development of the country was progressing, although slowly, on safe and natural lines. But the announcement of the finding of gold, which was continually being corroborated by successive reports, acted as an electric stimulus throughout the whole civilized world. As a con- sequence shipload after shipload of new comers flocked to Australia, all aflame with the same ardent desireâ€”gold.

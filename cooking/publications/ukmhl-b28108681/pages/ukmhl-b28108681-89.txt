45 BELHOOM VENTILATION. ever knows what a collection of rubbish he possesses till he has occasion to remove. There may not be much to be ashamed of in the first load or two of furniture, but at the latter end there is a strong feeling that a dark night would be more adapted for moving—the darker the better. At least every twelve months there should be a regular clearance of worn-out articles, and that miscellaneous collection of odds and ends which can be of no earthly value to anybody, unless he be an antiquary. Let us now go on to consider what ill effects result from the breathing of vitiated air. In his work, A Manual of Practical Hygiene, Professor Edmund A. Parkes has pointed out: “ When air moderately vitiated by respiration “ is breathed for any period and continuously, its effects “ become complicated with those of other conditions. “ But allowing the fullest effect to all other agencies, “ there is no doubt that the breathing of the vitiated “ atmosphere of respiration has a most injurious result “ on the health. The aeration and nutrition of the blood “ seems to be interfered with, and the general tone of “ the system falls below par. Of special diseases it “ appears pretty clear that affections of the lungs are more “ common.” The volume of air inhaled and exhaled by the adult in the twenty-four hours averages 360 cubic feet, or 2,000 gallons, while the amount we take in the shape of liquid or solid food does not amount probably to more than 5J pints, which is equal to only l-3000th part of the volume of air passed through the lungs. From this it will be seen how necessary it is that such a large amount of air should be perfectly fresh and wholesome, for the lungs act as a pair of immense sponges or absorbers. When the ventilation does not allow of a continuous supply of fresh air it smells close, and is surcharged with an increased amount of carbonic acid, while the noxious exhalations from

COOKERY RECIPES, $c. 317 tough and greasy, yet the same piece of meat if grilled or stewed would be tender and nutritious. There is often a prejudice against meat twice cooked, but the most delicate entrees that are so highly esteemed by many are only re- cooked meat. It is the time and care expended on it that- makes it so delicious. Even- in plain cooking there is no reason why the homely dish of hash should not be appetizing and wholesome. I trust that the following recipes, if care- fully carried out, will prove this to be true. STEAK AND 2 lbs. Steak 2 Kidneys 1 lb. Flour | lb. Dripping . 1 gill Water Pepper and Salt Total Cost—8\d. Time—One Hour and a Half. Mix a teaspoonful of flour in a plate with some pepper and salt, slice up the meat into pieces about three inches long by two broad, dip each piece lightly in the flour ; skin and slice up the kidneys, and cut the fat into small pieces. Roll a piece of kidney and a piece of fat alternately in the slices of meat, pile high in a dish, and pour in a gill of water or stock. Make a short crust by directions given for short pastry, wet the edge of the dish and line it with a strip of the paste, wet this strip again with water and cover the dish with paste ; trim off the edge, cut a small piece out of the centre of the pie, and ornament it with a few leaves cut out of the paste trimmings. Brush over with water and bake in & moderate oven for one hour and a half. As soon as the crust- lias acquired some colour, cover with a piece of paper well rubbed with dripping.

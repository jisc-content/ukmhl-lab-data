THE ABT OF LIVING IN AUSTRALIA. 34 the same time it must be borne in mind that the hot bath, when used to an excess, tends to induce a debilitated con- dition. THE HAIR. The loss of hair is so frequent in Australia, at least amongst the male population, that it requires a little con- sideration ; and apart altogether from this, the whole sub- ject is one of extreme interest, so that some reference to the actual structure of the hair and the hair-follicles .is called for. The roots of the hair are formed in the hair-follicles, which may be described as little pear-shaped bags, formed either in the true skin or in the cellular tissue beneath it. Each hair-follicle, hair-sac, or hair-pit, as it is variously termed, bulges out at its deeper part, contracting to a long narrow neck as it passes to its skin. Near the surface of the latter the follicle widens out again, and it is from this part that the hair emerges. As it has been pre- viously mentioned, a duct from one of the oil glands usually opens into each follicle. At its very bottom, also, is the papilla, or little mound-like elevation. This protrudes into the follicle, and from it the hair is formed. The blood supply for the hair is very abundant. There is a complete system of blood vessels encircling every one of the follicles, and besides this each papilla has a special dis- tribution of blood to itself. That part of the hair lying within the hair-follicle is called the root. The lower end of the root, which swells out into a knob, named the bulb, is concave in shape underneath, so as to fit on top of the pro- jecting papilla. The shaft is the long stem of the hair, while its extreme end is termed the point. By the aid of the microscope it may be seen that the hair itself on the outside is covered by a layer of scales—the cuticle—overlapping one another like the tiles on the roof of a house. Beneath the cuticle is the fibrous part, con-

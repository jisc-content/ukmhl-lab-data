( 114 ) CHAPTER IX. AUSTRALIAN FOOD HABITS AND THEIR FAULTS.—A PLEA FOR THEIR IMPROVEMENT. It is somewhat curious that, among the many questions which pertain to the national life of Australia, little, if any, attention has been directed to the influences which the daily food and habitual dietary exercise upon the present, and in what way they will affect the future population. And yet it must be apparent that the life of a nation is moulded in no small degree by its daily fare, by its general food habits, and still more by the fact of its living in con- formity with, or in direct opposition to, its climatic require- ments. It is evident that the natural dietary of the earth’s inhabitants is controlled largely by the particular region in which they dwell. Thus the Hindoos, and contiguous Eastern nations, subsist mainly upon the cereals, in which rice plays so prominent a part. The Greenlander's fare, on the contrary, consists almost entire1 y of oils and fats; in- deed, on this point Sir Anthony Carlisle relates the follow- ing anecdote :—“ The most Northern races of mankind,” says he, 44 were found to be unacquainted with the taste of “ sweets, and their infants made wry faces and sputtered out 44 sugar with disgust, but the little urchins grinned with 44 ecstasy at the sight of a bit of whale’s blubber.” In the same way the Arab is a date-eater and the Kaffir is a milk consumer. These facts being borne in mind, it will be desirable to ascertain whether the usual food habits ob- taining in Australia are those which the nature of the climate renders advisable. If, as a result of such an inquiry, it be demonstrated that the dietary customs followed here

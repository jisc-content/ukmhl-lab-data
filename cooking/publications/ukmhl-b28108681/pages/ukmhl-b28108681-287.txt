AUSTRALIAN WINE. 243 age. But with these “ restored ” and “ clothed ” wines the reverse happens, and they become worse and worse by keeping. Then again, many of the widely advertised Australian wines in the old country are sold too young ; and unfortu- nately these young wines constitute the bulk of the trade done wTith England. They are bottled when too green and crude, and have not been given a sufficient time in cask to develop into high-class wines. They must be allowed to acquire a proper amount of cask ripeness, and if they were stored and attended to for twelve months before being bottled they would vastly improve. In some cases, also, wines are shipped from Australia before they are twelve months old, and as they are usually fined, bottled, and sold as soon as possible after arrival, it has actually happened that the British public have repeatedly drunk wines that are hardly one year old. Indeed, the wines are frequently bottled when in a state of fermentation, consequently secondary fermentation goes on in the bottle, and the bottles are often shattered by an explosion. And more than this, they are often badly blended; they do not receive suffi- cient care and attention; and they are not uncommonly in the hands of a few men whose sole object is to make money.

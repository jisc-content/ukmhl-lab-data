COOKERY RECIPES, $c. 381 Cut up some cold boiled mutton into small pieces and lay them in a salad bowl. Mince up the celery and capers and strew over it, then pour over the dressing. Slice up the cold carrots and lay them on top ; garnish with the chopped parsley, and serve. CALF’S FOOT SALAD. Calves’ feet that have been boiled down for jelly make a good salad. They must, of course, be boiled very thoroughly for at least eight hours. Strain off the stock, remove the bones, and put the meat on one side till quite cold. Then cut up into neat pieces and put into a salad bowl. Pour over a salad dressing or just oil and vinegar ; shred over it a nice white lettuce, and garnish with sliced beetroot. rEmoulade salad dressing. This is a good dressing wThen mayonnaise is not liked. It is made in the same way as mayonnaise, using hard boiled eggs (yolks) instead of raw ones. Put the yolks into a basin and work very smoothly with the bowl of a wooden spoon ; add the oil gradually, using about one gill to every two yolks. A little French mustard and vinegar may be added before using. SOUP MEAT SALAD. The meat which has been boiled down for soup makes a nice salad. When the stock has been poured off, press the meat into a basin with about a gill of jelly stock, and some salt and pepper. When cold and firm, cut it into neat pieces and lay in a salad bowl. Pour over it some remou- lade sauce and shred on top some nice white lettuce leaves ; it may be garnished with beetroot or hard boiled eggs.

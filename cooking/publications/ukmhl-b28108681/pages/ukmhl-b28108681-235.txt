191 AUSTRALIAN WINE. obtained their plants from the finest “ cepages ” in Europe. And this is a magnificent legacy which must inevitably ex- ercise a powerful influence for ever on the Australian vine. Mr. Hubert de Castella drew special attention to this very fact in his paper read before the Royal Colonial Institute, London, in 1888 : so that a beginning was made under the most auspicious conditions. There are some interesting facts in connection with the different “cepages” which are certainly worth noticing. If the climate and the soil in one place be similar to the climate and soil in another, each variety—le cepage—of the grape will always produce the same wine. Thus some vineyards on the Yarra, Victoria, having a similar climate and similar soil to one of the great Bordeaux districts of France, pro duced a wine hardly to be distinguished from that of the latter. Then, again, one vine may produce a choice wine in one locality, but only an indifferent growth in another; and, conversely, a different “ cepage ” which does well in the latter region is almost a failure in the former. For instance, in France, the Gamay in the Beaujolais district, in which the soil is granitic, gives a superior wine to the Pinot; but, on the other hand, the Pinot in the Burgundy country, where there is a limestone formation, gives forth a world- famous wine, whilst the G-amay is nowhere in comparison. Next, it is necessary to remember that the effect of a warmer climate is to increase the alcoholic strength of a wine. At the same time, however, it must not be forgotten that this effect is greater in some varieties than in others. One “ cepage,” giving in a cool region a wine of 18 per cent, of alcohol, when transported to a warmer locality may show an increase to 26 per cent, of alcohol. Another “ cepage,” showing 20 per cent, in the lower temperature, may only develop 23 per cent, in the hotter districts.

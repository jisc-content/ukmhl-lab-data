167 SALADS, $c. price is certainly no drawback. The oil, too, must be the purest you can buy, and Crosse and Blackwell’s is as good as any ; at least, I do not know of a better oil at present, as it is sweet and without the slightest suspicion of rankness. So, too, with regard to vinegar : pay a little more for a good article, and you will have no cause to regret it.

The show of meat which is to be found in our Australian capitals is certainly worthy of any

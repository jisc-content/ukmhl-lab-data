Large areas where land is not expensive are devoted to its growth, and hundreds of acres are required annually for the New York markets alone. It does splendidly in all parts of Australia, and for growing- children it constitutes one of the most nutritious vege- tables that can be well imagined. On this latter account alone, therefore, it is really a matter for national regret that it is so improperly passed over.

These nutritious, although somewhat unknown vege- tables, therefore, evidently deserve to be brought into prominent notice, and once public interest is aroused, their cultivation and ready sale will speedily follow. At the same time it must not be forgotten that the tomato itself had a desperate struggle for reception into public favour when first introduced to us. It actually trembled in the balance for no inconsiderable time, and it was some years before its good qualities were universally recognised. To-day, however, it occupies a very different position, and takes rank as a luscious vegetable, appreciated by thousands of people; and besides, it is of undoubted value in many disorders of the liver.

Their effect, too, in indirectly populating the agricultural areas of Australia will materially aid the great work of decentralisation. But apart altogether from this matter of the introduction of vegetables which have hitherto been overlooked is

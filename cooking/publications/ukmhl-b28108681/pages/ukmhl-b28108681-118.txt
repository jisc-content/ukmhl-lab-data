74 THE ART OF LIVING IN AUSTRALIA. The best mill for grinding the coffee, and one which may be obtained from any ironmonger, is that which can be screwed on the edge of the kitchen table or dresser. It has a little contrivance to regulate the size of the grains, and care must be taken not to grind the coffee too fine; it should be in minute crumbs rather than in powder. As I have already said, the perfection of coffee is only to be obtained under three conditions. These are, first, that the beans should be roasted at home ; that they should be ground without much delay ; and, thirdly, made into coffee as soon as possible. Many people are, however, unable to carry out the first of these three requirements. The next best substitute is to have the roasted coffee beans sent daily to them by their grocer. This is a practice which might be followed more frequently with a great deal of advantage, for all are able, at least, to possess a mill and grind their own coffee at home. The making of the coffee is quite as important as the preceding, and the number of different models of coffee- makers is almost perplexing. But of them all, the one which is simplest, and perhaps most effective, is the ordinary cafetiere, or French coffee-pot. This has the advantage of costing only a few shillings, and is readily obtainable from any ironmonger. It consists of an upper compartment in which the coffee is made, and a lower part—the coffee-pot itself—into which the coffee descends. These two portions are quite separate, although the upper fits* on the lower. The floor—on which the coffee is placed—of the upper part is perforated by a number of minute holes. There is also a movable strainer about an inch in depth, which fits on top of the upper part; and a presser, consisting of a long rod with a circular plate at its end, which for convenience passes through the centre of the strainer, and rests on the perforated floor of the upper part.

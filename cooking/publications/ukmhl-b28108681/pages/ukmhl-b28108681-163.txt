They are especially deli- cious when served up with melted butter and egg sauce.

The demand for it in America is so great, and it yields such a good return, that some growers make 100?. and upwards yearly profit for each acre.

Brussels sprouts are the most delicate of all the borecoles, and it is a thousand pities that this delightful vegetable is not more often to be met with.

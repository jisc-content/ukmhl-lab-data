When the joint is served pour the dripping into a basin and stand away till cold ; then cut it out of the basin. The gravy that will be found at the bottom is an excellent addi- tion to hash or mince. Cut the dripping into small pieces and pour over it sufficient boiling water to dissolve it. Stir it well and leave till it is a solid cake of fat. Cut it off the water, scrape the impurities from the bottom, and it will be ready for use. TO CLARIFY FAT. The fat from meat not required in dressing it, and the ends of chops, &c., make excellent shortening for pies and cakes. Cut it into small pieces and put it into an old sauce- pan with about one quart of water. Boil until all the water is evaporated ; the fat will then begin to boil. Strain this melted fat into a basin, and continue to do so until all the fat is extracted. This is a good substitute for butter and lard. MELTED BUTTER SAUCE. | pint Water 1 oz. Butter . . . . .

AUSTRALIAN WINE. 195 Mr. Francois de CasteUa, formerly Expert to the Board of Viticulture, the author of The Handbook on Viticulture for Victoria, aud who is now the proprietor of the Tongala vineyard, in an instructive article on viticulture in Victoria lays down the following rules with regard to the spacing of vines :—“ There is for each locality, ivith the same conditions of soil and climate, a certain distance, which we may call the optimum, at which vines will thrive best; if this distance be in- creased they will not improve, and may even deteriorate. Unless this be a distance which cannot conveniently be worked by horse labour, it would evidently be a waste of land to plant any wider, and would entail the use of unneces- sary labour for its cultivation. It would be just as foolish to plant vines any closer than this, as it would give unnecessary pruning, disbudding, tying up, &c.— that is, if the climate be such that grapes will ripen satisfactorily. “I have come to the conclusion that in our district (Lilydale, a cool region) the optimum distance is by 4J feet, practically 2,000 vines per acre, at least in the poorer soils ; and, after careful observation, I am of opinion that vines planted any wider will not bear more fruit. This is, however, rather too close to be conveniently worked by horse labour. I should, therefore, recommend 5 by 5 feet. But on the Murray (a warm region) this distance would not suit at all, and I believe that the vine-growers are right to plant 8 by 8, and even 10 by 10 feet, in that district. “ In conclusion, I would advise every vine-grower starting in a new district to determine by experiment what is his optimum distance. He can make a pretty good guess from observations of soil and climate, and for the rest let him, instead of planting all his vineyard on one scale, plant different blocks at different distances apart, so that if he

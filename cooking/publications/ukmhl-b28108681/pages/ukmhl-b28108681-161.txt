117 FOOD HABITS AND THEIR FAULTS. In how many houses does the breakfast ever consist of any- thing but the ubiquitous chops, steaks, or sausages ? indeed, one might almost term them “the faith, hope, and charity” of domestic life. I remember reading some little time ago that if a map of the world were made in which lands of utter darkness wTere coloured black like the coalfields in an atlas of physical geography, certain races would be signalised by their opaqueness.

14 THE ART OF LIVING IN AUSTRALIA. As a corollary to the preceding, would you say that the climate is marlced hy great variability ? New South Wales.—No; just the opposite. Indeed, as regards Sydney itself, there are few cities in which so much uniformity of temperature and slow changes are to be found. The cause of any great change is the hot wind, and as that seldom comes more than three or four times in the year, great changes are infrequent. The mean diurnal range in Sydney is 11|°, and taking a series of years it is very unusual for the range on any day to reach 25°. Victoria.—No ; because these are exceptional phenomena. In the late spring and during early summer the climate may be said to be occasionally subject to sharp and sudden changes, which give it the character of variability. But the devia- tions from mean temperature, except for short periods, are not remarkable. South Australia.—Yes, in summer; but not in winter. Queensland.—Certainly not; with the exception of the wide diurnal range of temperature in winter in the southern “ continental ” districts, as at Cambooya and Thargomindah. The changes are, according to my knowledge, far more sudden and marked in the southern colonies (as during a “ shift ” from N.E. by W., to S.W. for instance, at Mel- bourne, and especially at Adelaide) than in Queensland and its coastal districts. With regard to sustained, prolonged, or continued high temperatures during the summer months, for hoiv many days have you Inown the temperature remain continuously at a high level ? This is a very important question, as it con- cerns infantile mortality in no small degree; I shall be grate- ful for your experience. New South Wales.—Much depends upon what tempera- ture is deemed a “ high level.” If we assume that 90° and

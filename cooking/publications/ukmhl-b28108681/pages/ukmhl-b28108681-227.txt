183 AUSTRALIAN WINE. v^as 1,844,400,602 gallons. And lastly, there is just one more fact worth remembering, which is that the approxi- mate value of the 1890 vintage to France was nearly 40,000,000/. sterling. Let us see, on the other hand, the gigantic strides on the part of wool. In 1805 the amount of wool exported from Spain was 6,895,525 lbs., and from Australia nil. In 1811, however, Australia exported the modest quantity of 167 lbs. In 1861 the exportation from Spain had fallen to 1,268,617 lbs., while from Australia it had increased to 68,428,000 lbs. In 1891 New South Wales alone produced 357,096,954 lbs., representing a value of 11,036,018/. And lastly, the wool exportation of Australia and Tasmania (not reckoning New Zealand) for the same year reached the enormous figures of 593,830,153 lbs., with a value of 20,569,093/. The disproportion between the attention which has been given to viticulture and that which has been bestowed upon wool-growing is well brought out in the following table :— Table showing the value of the total amount of Wine pro- duced in the Five Colonies of Australia (including both that for local use and that for export) for the year ending March 31st, 1892 ; and the value of Wool (only that exported, and therefore irrespective of that locally required) for the Five Australian Colonies and Tasmania alone, and not including that exported from New Zealand, for the year 1891 :— Total value of Australian -wine (local use as well as £ export) produced for the year ending March 31st, 1892, only about - 800,000 Value of wool exported from Australia and Tasmania alone in 1891 (and therefore irrespective of the additional value of that locally required), not less than ------ 20,569,093 From the foregoing, therefore, it will be apparent that

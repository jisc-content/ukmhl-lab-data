238 THE ABT OF LIVING IN AUSTRALIA. The reply to this question is not an easy matter, but I shall endeavour to answer it to the best of my ability. The pro- bability is, if a dozen people were asked, at random, why Australian wine is so little used in Australia, that at least that number of different explanations would be forthcoming. The truth, however, is more likely to be found in a combina- tion of reasons, rather than from any one single cause. These are obviously worth considering, from the very fact that the knowing of what they consist is of the first importance in rectifying them. I shall begin, then, by saying that the label on the bottle has much to answer for, in that it is misleading. It does not give any idea of what is to be found inside. Thus the word Riesling, on one bottle, may be attached to a wine grown on the Hunter, in New South Wales, and on another to a wine from the Yarra, in Victoria. It is true that the wine from these two places may be grown from the same “cepage.” But while the river Yarra wine will contain perhaps 14 per cent, of alcohol, that from the Hunter River will have quite 20 per cent.—so much does an increase in the warmth of the climate increase the alcoholic strength of the wine. And while we are on the subject of labels, I must cer- tainly take exception to the unattractive character of those employed on the bottles of our Australian wines. There is no reason whatever why a little consideration should not be paid to the artistic sense in this respect. Our wine mer- chants, it would appear, fail to understand the selling power which belongs to the “ get-up ” of the label on a wine bottle. I feel sure this attractiveness has a great deal to do with the success of many products, notably in the case of the American preserved fruits. Some of these are labelled in a manner which is creditable in the highest degree—and what is more, from a practical point, it is no unimportant factor in their huge sale.

Another objection may be taken to it on cosmetic grounds, and it certainly is difficult to make a flannel garment look attractive ; but still, with a little taste in the way of bordering, this may be overcome to a great extent. On the other hand, it has great advantages which none of the foregoing fabrics possess, and which have been already referred to. Having thus minutely and scientifically examined into the properties of the various clothing materials, it will clearly be seen that the one which possesses the greatest advan- tages with the least possible disadvantages is wool. Hence it is to be chosen in preference to all other fabrics for wear- ing next the skin, because it wards off all risk of a chill striking the body.

The next objection, that it cannot be made to look attractive or ornamental, is to a certain extent true; but if it is simply a question of health versus appearance, those who would sacrifice the former deserve to suffer. In this matter we may learn a wrinkle from a practical class of men, namely, sailors.

It is better to have four made, so that two can be washed

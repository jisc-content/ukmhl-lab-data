SCHOOL COOKERY-INFLUENCE ON DAILY LIFE. 113 marry, and commence their new existence under the most unfavourable conditions. In the first place, they are totally ignorant of everything connected with household manage- ment, and what is far worse, they have almost a contempt for it. What the result is, in too many cases, I have already dwelt upon,—either the husband and the family suffer from the effects of bad Cookery, and unhappiness and ill-health follow, or else the bread-winner flies to alcohol in order to forget his troubles. It must not be imagined however, that this condition of affairs is altogether beyond remedy, and that our Aus- tralian girls are hopeless in this respect. No, on the con- trary, those of whom I have just spoken are as attractive and fascinating—as Australian girls always are; but it is a thousand pities that they do not possess a greater appre- ciation of the importance of home life. Still, after all, may it not be that our educational system is defective in that it does not implant—all through a girl’s school life —a love of Cookery, and of domestic management ? It is during this impressionable age that all these truths can be so well indoctrinated. Indeed, I am thoroughly con- vinced that one of the greatest defects in the superlatively scientific education of to-day, as far as the girls are con- cerned, is the neglect which these matters receive ; for it stands to reason that if they are passed by during school life, they are never learnt at all. And, further, it should not be forgotten that a cook is always able to command high wages. That is a fact which should not be lost sight of, although perhaps it is some- what mercenary. A cook need never fear but that she will always he in constant employment. Ah, yes ! Max O’Rell got in a home thrust when he declared that “ the “ average woman who finds herself alone in the world “ could earn her living if she could cook—but she can’t.” S. 1003. H

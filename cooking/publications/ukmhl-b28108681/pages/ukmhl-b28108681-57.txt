13 THE CLIMATE OF AUSTRALIA. other hand, the pressure sometimes varies quickly to the extent of two inches. Victoria.—-Yes ; the temperature much more so than the barometric pressure ; it has fallen from a high temperature to 20 and even 30 degrees sometimes in as many minutes, when a hot north wind has suddenly changed to a cold southerly one. But such sudden and great changes occur very seldom, and then only in the hot summer months, and are known as “the change.” On several occasions in the last 30 years it has fallen from 105° in the shade to 70° and 65° in the shade in less than an hour. South Australia.—Yes, in the summer ; but, especially as regards temperature, rarely in the winter. One notable example occurred on February 9th, 1887, when during a heavy thunder-storm the temperature fell 25° in 10 or 15 minutes, followed by a rising temperature. In other instances the fall of temperature has been almost equally rapid. From this it will be seen that we are subject to large and quick falls of temperature following extreme heat. The approach of hot weather is usually gradual, and the fall abrupt. The barometer has been known to show a rise of xex of an inch in 24 hours; this, however, is exceptional. Queensland.—There is no record of a fall of as much as 22° in 15 minutes. But, on the other hand, a rise of 30° in three hours is a common feature over the Darling Downs after sunrise. Owing to the diathermancy of the atmosphere already referred to, it is a fact, nevertheless, that in the “ continental ” or inland districts of Southern Queens- land the temperature in winter is subject to sudden and marked changes. Barometric pressure, owing to the com- paratively low latitude, is not exposed to sudden and marked changes, except during- hurricane conditions, which usually affect the central coast-line in February and March.

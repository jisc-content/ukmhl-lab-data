FISH AND OYSTERS—THEIR FOOD VALUE. 149 South Wales, that most of our deep water beds are situated in the rivers, a little way from the sea. Under favourable circumstances there is just that commingling of the fresh water from the river and the salt water from the sea which produces the oyster to perfection. In times of drought, however, the salt water drives out the oysters from the deeper beds by reason of its greater density. On the other hand, the fresh water, being the lighter, floats at the top and enables the oysters to live in the shallower parts, by maintaining the required 3 per cent, of salinity. It is evident from this, that the lessees have acted in direct oppo- sition to this natural law, for they have stripped the oys- ters from the shallow water, where they wTould have done well, and laid them down on the deep beds, where the in- creased percentage of salt water has proved too much for them. Dr. James C. Cox, of Sydney, the President of the Fisheries Commission, and our best known authority on conchology, has contributed a very valuable paper upon “ The Australian Oyster, its Cultivation and Destruction,” to the recent official work, The Fisheries of New South Wales, already referred to. A brief summary of his view’s will, therefore, be full of interest. First of all, then, he sepa- rates oysters into three classes, namely, drift oysters, mud oysters, and rock oysters. Now, this classification must be clearly borne in mind, as it will the better enable the reader to understand what follows. He attributes the want of success in our oysteries to several causes, which have not been sufficiently heeded. One of these is that the oyster culturists have expected that the seed oysters which they obtained from between high and low water mark (rock oysters) would produce drift oysters if placed on beds on which drift oysters once throve in abundance. Dr. Cox maintains, however, that these two kinds of oysters, the rock

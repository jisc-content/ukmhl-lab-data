And more than this, imagine carrying the employment of ice to such an extent that it culminates in that gastronomical curiosity, a baked ice ! The “ Alaska ” is a baked ice, of which the interior is an ice cream. This latter is surrounded by an exterior of whipped cream, made warm by means of a Salamander. The transition from the hot outside envelope to the frozen inside is painfully sudden, and not likely to be attended with beneficial effect. But the abuse of a good thing is no argument whatever against its use in a moderate and rational manner. It will be desirable, however, to see what is believed in India about iced drinks, for it will be something of a guide for us in Australia. There are two authorities in particular who have been already referred to, and who have written on this matter in its application to India. The first of these is Sir James Ranald Martin, who had twenty-two years experience there in different parts, and is therefore entitled to be listened to. He says that ice is a matter of neces- sity in the East, and quotes Dolomieu, who observes of iced drinks that “they revive the spirits, strengthen the body, and assist the digestion.” There is also that other great name, that of Sir Joseph Fayrer, who is most competent to speak on Indian matters.

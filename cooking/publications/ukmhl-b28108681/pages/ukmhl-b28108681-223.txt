The history of the introduction of the grape to Australian soil deserves more than bare reference to that event. It will be remembered that Captain Cook discovered this territory in 1770 ; in November 1791, barely more than twenty years afterwards, the first vine was planted at Parramatta, near Sydney. Nothing can demonstrate the suitability of the climate and the soil for its cultivation more than this one fact, namely, that at the very beginning of Australian settle- ment it was plain enough that the land was meant for the grape; and there is an interesting historical association, well worthy of note, attached to this circumstance. By order of the Emperor Napoleon, the Great Napoleon, a voyage of discovery to the Southern Hemisphere was per- formed by a fully equipped expedition during the years 1801, 1802, 1803, and 1804. One of the naturalists, M. F. Peron, has given us an excellent account of his New South Wales experience, and after referring to the Parramatta vineyards as likely to be followed by the most excellent results, he goes on to say:—“ By one of those chances “ which are inconceivable, Great Britain is the only one of “ the great maritime powers which does not cultivate the “ vine either in her own territories or her colonies, not- “ withstanding the consumption of wine on board her fleets “ and throughout her vast regions is immense.” This is another illustration of the old adage that lookers-on see most of the game, for this observant Frenchman has recorded an opinion the very truth of which comes well home to us. His remarks, moreover, open up a vista of what a great

82 THE ART OF LIVING IN AUSTRALIA. tobacco in any shape or form is an absolute poison ; se- condly, those who can enjoy a very small amount daily ; and thirdly, those who are able to smoke in moderation. Now, while those who use tobacco with wise discretion appear to be none the worse for it, yet it unfortunately happens that far too frequently there is no limit to this discretion.

In this way the rhythm of the heart has been aptly compared by Dr. Lauder Brunton to a restive horse, who goes into a gallop for a few yards, next pulls up all at once, and then breaks off

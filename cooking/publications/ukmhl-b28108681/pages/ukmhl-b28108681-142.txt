This I hope will never be, for it would at once take away all personality from the teacher, and transmute him into a mere auditory machine. His individuality would become lost in the official, and teaching as teaching resolve itself into a stereotyped function ; and this latter consideration leads me to remark that one man has the gift of impart- ing knowledge, in which another fails entirely.

96 THE ART OF LIVING IN AUSTRALIA. as a continuation of the Kindergarten system. Through the exertions of Uno Cygneeus the whole of the national system of education in Finland was reorganized, and manual work was first made a part of the regular instruction in the common schools. In Sweden, likewise, the same prin- ciples have been introduced chiefly by Herr Otto Salomon, the director of the great :sloyd seminar um at Naas. Sloyd work is used in the schools in a disciplinary way as an integral part of general education; the children, generally boys, are employed for a certain number of hours a week in making articles of common household use. It is main- tained that work of this kind is specially invaluable in supplementing the ordinary school education of the three R’s. It fulfils the injunction “to put the whole boy to school; ” it develops faculties which would otherwise lie dormant, while at the same time it trains the eye and does away with clumsy fingers. THE PURPOSE OF EDUCATION. From the foregoing it will be seen that within the last 130 years a striking change has come over the views held respecting education. Prior to that time an artificial and pedantic method prevailed, which received its first check from the pen of Rousseau. The system which he attacked, however, built up as it was upon centuries of mediaeval learning, was not to be disposed of by this one encounter. Such a result was not to be expected in the natural order of things; but as the ideas of Rousseau contained the living truth, they were bound to find advocacy in due course, and though the seed might lie quiescent for a time, yet it was sure to germinate sooner or later. After him the path of educational reform was illumined by the genius of Pestalozzi, and a few years later Froebel appeared to influence for ever the methods of education.

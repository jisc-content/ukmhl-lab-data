239 A USTEALIAN WINE. Then again, there is that want of uniformity which Mr. James Smith has so ably descanted upon, and to which I have already referred. It is bad enough to have a wine labelled Riesling, or whatever it may be, from one place differing entirely from a wine of the same name which comes from some other locality. But it is a far more serious defect when the wine of any particular place one year differs entirely from the same wine coming from the same locality at another. For the same variety of wine, of the same vineyard, thus to vary, year by year, is simply unpardonable. This must not be allowed to continue, for while it exists Australian wines will always be subject to reproach—a reproach, indeed, which cannot be explained away. And while dealing with these shortcomings I propose to speak of another matter, which is by no means unimportant. I refer to the size of the bottle. It has frequently happened that visitors to Australia have said to me, “ I should very “ much like—indeed, I am anxious—to try your Australian “ wines ; but unfortunately I cannot drink a whole bottle “ at table, and I am unable to obtain less.” Now, this is undoubtedly a grievance, and should be overcome in some way ; either by putting up a portion of our wines in smaller bottles, or else by making some arrangement so that a smaller quantity may be obtained. Since these lines were written, however, it is very pleasing to record the fact that one enterprising firm in Sydney has taken a highly commendable step in this very direction; and already smaller bottles of Australian wine may be obtained for the low prices of 6d. and 9d. Up to this point I have made no remarks with regard to the knowledge of wine possessed by the majority of Austra- lians, and yet in many respects it is the most important of all.

19 THE CLIMATE OF AUSTRALIA. point between north-west and south-wTest, and hence the dry climate. In Sydney no less than 39'6 per cent, of the wind comes from this quarter. The winds known as southerly bursters are generally to be expected from No- vember to the end of February ; they are always attended with strong electrical excitement, a stream of sparks being sometimes produced for an hour at the electrometer. The approach of the true burster is indicated by a peculiar roll of clouds, which, when once seen, cannot be mistaken. It is just above the south horizon, and extends on either side of it 15° or 20°, and looks as if a thin sheet of cloud were being rolled up like a scroll by the advancing wind. The change of wind is sometimes very sudden ; it may be fresh N.E. and in ten minutes a gale from S. Hence vessels not on the look-out are sometimes caught unprepared, and suffer accordingly. When a southerly wind commences anywhere south of Sydney it is at once telegraphed to its principal coast towns, and a signal put up indicating its approach. As to the hot winds, they are so insignificant in number that it cannot be said they play any particular role. Their effect is to raise the temperature, because they flow from the heated interior of Australia ; but they do not last long, and for the majority of people are dry, healthy winds. In- deed, they are by no means so oppressive as the warm north- east wind, so charged with moisture, which comes in the summer. Victoria.—In summer the N. winds blow to the extent of 8 per cent,, the 8.W. winds 24T per cent., and the S. winds 20*4 per cent. Northerly, or warm-quarter winds, in sum- mer are 20 per cent., and southerly, or cool-quarter winds, 64 per cent. The northerly winds in winter, however, are bleak and cold, like easterly winds in England. The par- ticular role played by the hot wind is to precede a cyclonic movement, and is always in front of a low pressure area or

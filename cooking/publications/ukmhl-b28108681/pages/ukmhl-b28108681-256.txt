212 THE ART OF LIVING- IN AUSTRALIA. THE MAKING OF THE WINE—THE MUST ITSELF. The must—that is, the juice expressed from the grape, but in which (juice) fermentation has not yet taken place—is a fluid of very complex composition. It is made up of a variety of ingredients, with which it is necessary to become familiar in order to follow, during the process of fermenta- tion, its change into wine. We find, therefore, that a large part of the must consists of water; this serves to dissolve the other constituents, and to dilute them to the required extent. Tor instance, the sugar in the must needs to be considerably diluted for the purposes of fermentation. In too concentrated a form it actually prevents it, as we see when fruits are preserved in syrup. Next to water, sugar is the material which exists in the largest proportions in the must; it is, however, that peculiar kind of sugar termed “ glucose,” which may be described as uncrystallisable sugar, and as consisting of half grape sugar and half fruit sugar. It possesses the property of being able to ferment, which cane or crystallisable sugar cannot do, unless, indeed, it first be changed into glucose. Noav, it is a curious fact that although cane sugar can be trans- formed into glucose, yet the latter form of sugar has never, so far, been changed into cane or crystallisable sugar. As Mr. J. A. Despeissis points out, the invention of a process that would achieve this would be worth more than all the mines of New South Wales put together. In the process of fermentation the glucose is broken up into a number of substances, which differ entirely from it; and as these different bodies are very important they deserve much attention. Under the influence of fermentation glu- cose undergoes a great change, of which the principal pro- ducts are alcohol and carbonic acid gas. The alcohol is, of course, the one predominant feature in wine ; and according

It was found that the ice which occasioned this outbreak had been taken from a stagnant pond containing a large amount of decomposing matter. A portion of it was carefully melted, and was found to contain a considerable quantity of decaying vegetable matter. In the case of artificial ice, the question of purity is even more important. The reason for this is that the water used in the manu- facture of artificial ice is usually frozen solid, and what- ever substances, consequently, are dissolved in the water remain in the ice itself. TOBACCO. Five out of every six male adults smoke, whether it be cigarette, cigar, or pipe. That is, in a gathering of, say, 600 men, 500 will be smokers and 100 non-smokers. At least, this is the estimated proportion in the old country. In Australia the ratio is about the same, but the average amount of tobacco used by every smoker is greater. Accor- ding to Mr. T. A. Coghlan in his Wealth and Progress of New South Wales, the annual consumption of tobacco in Australia for each inhabitant is 3 lbs. all but a fraction. For the United Kingdom the corresponding amount is T41 lbs.; and for the United States of America, 4-40lbs. Italy, it would seem, consumes in the same way 1*34 lbs.; France, 2*05 lbs.; Germany, 3 lbs. ; Austria, 3*77 lbs. ; Turkey, 4*37 lbs. ; while Holland reaches the excessive amount of 6*92 lbs. Of the five colonies of Australia, namely, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queens- land, and West Australia, the use of tobacco is greatest in the latter two; the figures for Queensland being 3â€™53 lbs., and for West Australia 4T1 lbs. With regard to the effect of tobacco on the human system, it will perhaps be most convenient to make a

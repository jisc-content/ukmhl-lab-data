FISH AND 0YSTEES— THEIB FOOD VALUE. 155 over 1,000 embryo oysters adhering to them. The other form of spat collector he employs consists of cemented slates, arranged ridge-wise on light ti-tree frames, and in some localities these were found to be even more efficacious than the palings. In the old country the same necessity for oyster culture is well recognised. In an interesting address given not so long ago, Professor Huxley, after referring to the growing scarcity of the bivalve, expressed his belief that the only hope for the oyster consumer was first in oyster culture, and secondly in discovering a means of breeding oysters under such conditions that all the spat was safely deposited. France has done more than any other country in the world in the artificial culture of the oyster. Not many years ago the oyster fisheries there were in danger of absolute extinc- tion—a state of affairs brought about by reckless and unre- stricted fishing, without any effort to provide for a re-supply. Mainly through the efforts of M. Coste, the propagation of oysters was scientifically carried out, with a result that has even exceeded the marvellous. According to a recent French official report, the Bay of Arcachon contained in the year 1857, 20 private pares, or district oyster beds. In the year 1865 these had increased to the number of 297, with an out-at of 10,000,000 oysters. In the year 1887, the area under cultivation in the same bay amounted to 15,000 acres, and produced 300,000,000 oysters. In addition to this, a still later report attributes the present flourish- ing condition of this industry “ to the steps primarily “ initiated by the Government, and to the necessity of “ upholding this success by continuing the same system “ of administrative supervision, together with the practical “ illustration in the Government model pares of the most “ perfected methods of oyster culture, for the benefit of “ private cultivators.”

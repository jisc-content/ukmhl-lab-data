THE ART OF LIVING IN AUSTRALIA. 198 the relative merits of planting cuttings or rooted vines in the vineyard. The majority of the witnesses examined by the Royal Commission on Vegetable Products in Victoria, 1889, admitted that cuttings ultimately produced a better vine. But, as in some of the preceding points at issue, may it not be that climate and soil have a great deal to do with the results ? Signor Romeo Bragato, the Expert to the Board of Viticulture in Victoria, in his Hints to Intending Vine-growers, recommended cuttings, not only for cheap- ness, but because if planted in the vineyard at the first they did not require removal. In the course of his advice he proceeded to remark :— “ The ways used here and elsewhere by the vine-grower are two—namely, by cuttings, and rooted vines—but they do not always agree which of the two is the better. There are many who say that, for the new plantation, rooted vines must be preferred ; others maintain that it is better to plant by cuttings, because they grow more flourishing and give the vine a longer life. Both these methods are good and to be recommended ; but, in a general way, I would advise you to stick to the cuttings, and that not only because by planting them you will have a sensible economy, but also because if you plant the cuttings in the vineyard you will never have to move them. If you use rooted vines, it is impossible, not- withstanding all your care and attention, for you to carry them from the nursery to the vineyard without hurting their roots, wThich are very delicate. “ But if the ground which you intend to plant with vines Were loose and arid, then I would never hesitate to advise you to always use in that case rooted vines, because the cuttings without roots would not absorb the rainy water; which in such kind of soil runs away in the same time it takes to fall. This is the reason why, in such a soil, the cuttings seldom strike.

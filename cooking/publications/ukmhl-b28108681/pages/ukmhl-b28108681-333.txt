COOKERY RECIPES, %c. 289 Peel the artichokes and lay them in vinegar and water for an hour ; this will make them a good colour. Mix up half a pint of the milk with the stock, and boil the arti- chokes, onions, and peppercorns in this for an hour. Pub through a hair sieve with a wooden spoon. Stir in the milk and some salt, pour back into the saucepan and stir until it boils. If the artichokes do not thicken the soup sufficiently, sprinkle in a little sago or semolina when it is returned to the saucepan. Serve with fried bread. S. 1003. T

ABLUTION-THE SKIN AND THE BATH. 39 below. It cannot grow backwards, since it is confined in a groove. But as the fresh cells form they gradually thrust the whole nail forward, till at last it requires paring. As a matter of fact, however, the nails really require more atten- tion than they usually receive. The finger nails should be trimmed into a bow shape, and the corners rounded off, while the skin near the root of the nail, which tends to grow over the lunula, should be repressed into position by means of any suitable appliance. On the contrary, those of the feet should be cut squarish in shape, with a liollowed-out centre, so as to prevent the nail from ingrowing. THE TEETH. It is not my purpose to enter fully into all the details concerning the teeth, but there are one or two matters of great importance connected with them which require a few words. There are many people, beginning to get on in years, perhaps, who have had the misfortune to lose many of their teeth. The first thing that happens is an inability to masticate their food ; and, before long, indi- gestion sets in, with all the evils attendant on its train. These unfortunates know that they have indigestion; the pain and discomfort after food tell them that. They do not know, however, that all their sufferings arise solely from their want of teeth. They begin to lose flesh, and get alto- gether in a bad way. But if they can be induced to apply to a competent and skilful dental surgeon, they are pro- perly fitted with what they require, and the consequence is their sufferings almost immediately cease. They begin to enjoy their food, and before long their whole appear- ance is transformed into one of health. In the opinion of all dental authorities, when the natural teeth are lest, artificial substitutes unquestionably conduce to health and comfort.

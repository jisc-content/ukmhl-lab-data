FISH AND 0YSTEDS— THEIR FOOD VALUE. 157 THE FOOD VALUE OF THE OYSTEB. In the first place I shall begin by affirming that it would be a difficult matter indeed to say too much in favour of the oyster.

At the same time, it must not be forgotten that it is not every person who cares for the oyster, showing that there are various forms of affliction; and we find, accordingly, that there is no half-heartedness about the like or dislike for the oyster—it is either held in the loftiest admiration, or looked upon almost with repugnance. It is both food for the sick-room and food for the strong man. It is one of the most valuable forms of nourishment for the growing child, and it gives strength to those of declining years. It is specially appropriate for the brain worker, and yet it is deservedly in great repute with the muscle user— whether athlete or artisan.

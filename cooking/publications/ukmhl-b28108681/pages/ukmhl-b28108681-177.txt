FISH AND OYSTERS—THEIR FOOT VALUE. 133 family, including the brill, the sole, and the turbot, is also known to spawn near the surface. The eggs of the mac- kerel and the garfish have likewise been found floating, and successfully hatched. Now, no fish comes so close to the land as does the mackerel, yet it is certain that it never makes its way into the estuaries and inlets till after spawn- ing is finished—for that it spawns in the open sea is almost without a doubt. These facts consequently do away altogether with the old statements concerning the destructive results of trawling. The yield from the English trawleries alone is computed to be over 200,000 tons annually, and as the price for trawled fish at the Billingsgate market averages £12 per ton, this represents about two and a half million pounds. And, in addition to these weighty figures, Professor Huxley’s words deserve to be well remembered, for, says he, “ Were “ trawl fishing stopped, it wTould no longer be a case of high “ prices, but that ninety-nine out of a hundred would hardly “ be able to afford any at all—herrings and a few other “ fish caught in the old way excepted.” Indeed, it is. chiefly by this method of beam trawling that London and the interior are supplied with brill, turbot, and soles ; while by it thousands of tons of plaice, haddock, and other fish are brought within the reach even of the poorest. DRIFT-NET AND OTHER DEEP-SEA FISHING. Important though the beam-trawl may be, there is another mode of deep-sea fishing which deserves to be well known by us in Australia, and which undoubtedly must come into general use before we can make any pretensions with regard to our fisheries. I refer to that by means of drift-nets. As the trawl is absolutely necessary, on the one hand, for cap- turing fish which frequent the bottom, so, on the other, the drift-net is essential for those whose resort is the upper

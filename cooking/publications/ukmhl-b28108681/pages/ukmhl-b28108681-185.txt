FISH AND OYSTERS— THEIR FOOD VALUE. 141 briefly to the different methods with regard to the dis- posal of fish practised in the Woolloomooloo, the Bedfern, and the Melbourne Fish Markets. At the former, the sales are conducted by Mr. Bichard Seymour, the inspector and auctioneer of the fish market—with other auctioneers— who act directly from the Sydney Municipal Council; the Bedfern markets are conducted by the Messrs. Hudson ; while in Melbourne there are licensed auctioneers, who pay for the privilege. But to return to our middleman, upon whom the whole controversy centres. Indeed, the discussion over him in Melbourne, not so long ago, might be said to have reached to a white-heat phase. But the premises on which the arguments were based were so hopelessly conflicting that it was impossible to logically settle the point. It was claimed, on the one hand, that the price the fishermen received was cruelly small in comparison with that which the public had to pay. On the other, the contention was that the price paid to the fishermen was fairly satis- factory, and that the public obtained comparatively cheap fish. We have seen, however, what takes place in other parts of the world, and, indeed, every one must admit that there is a remarkable difference between the price which the fisherman gets and that which the public have to pay. Between these two extremes there is an inordinate disparity, and the difficulty is to connect the two to- gether—to bring to light the leakage—and to find out who is living both on the fisherman and the public at one and the same time. On this point a recent Fisheries Beport of Victoria says :—“ The solution of the very important question of “ providing a larger and cheaper fish supply for the masses “ rests mainly in the hands of the public. The present high “ prices are maintained in virtue of a monopoly which can

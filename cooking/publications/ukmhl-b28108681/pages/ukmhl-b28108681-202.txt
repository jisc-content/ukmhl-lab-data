158 THE ART OF LIVING IN AUSTRALIA. when all else is indigestible; in nervous disease it renews the nervous energy. The list, in fact, might be multi- plied indefinitely, but enough has been instanced to prove the value of the oyster. It should be added, in conclu- sion, that it is best eaten raw, with its juice, which is its blood mixed with sea-water. A squeeze of lemon is gene- rally employed to bring out its flavour, and, for those who are not invalids, a sensation of cayenne pepper is dis- tinctly an improvement. THE FOOD VALUE OF FISH. Along with its great ally, the oyster, fish undoubtedly occupies one of the highest places on the food list. Un- fortunately, it is not met with in every home as it should be, its high price and scarcity combining to make it con- spicuous by its absence. That such a state of things is actually the case in Australia can only be deeply deplored.

If such were the case—and I would it were so—how would a sudden reversal to the present state of our fish supply be received ?

It was perfectly dry, and thereby differed entirely from ordinary port wines, which contain from 2 to 6 per cent, of sugar. Its alcoholicity was cer- tainly below all the port wines usually sold. With all these desirable qualities, therefore, it possessed high dietetic and hygienic virtues, and refreshed the system like Bur- gundy or Medoc wine. It will be convenient to make reference here to two terms about which there is a great deal of confusion. It is the difference between the “ aroma ” and the “ bouquet ” of wine. Now, the Settimana Vinicolct has recently well observed that although these two are usually supposed to be the same, yet they are entirely different. The aroma of a wine is altoge- ther distinct from those agreeable and delicate odours known by the name of “ bouquet.” For instance, some American grapes have what is called a “ foxy ” smell, and the wine prepared from them has this aroma, which is perceptibly disagreeable. Aroma pre-exists in certain grapes, and during vinification will pass into the resulting wine. On the other hand, perfume, the bouquet of the French, as it has been pointed out by Professor G-. Grazzi-Soncini, is the complex sensation produced simultaneously on the palate and nose, owing to the intimate connection between these two organs, and which has already been referred to. This bouquet is due to the action of the ethers, which are formed during the life of the wine. The Corriere del Villcigio remarks, in addition to the preceding, that there is a chemical difference between the “ aroma ” and the “ bouquet ” of wine. The former is produced chiefly by one or more carburets of hydrogen, and their oxidation derivatives. The bouquet, however, results from the admixture of aldehydes with one or more essential oils and various ethers, produced by com- bination of fatty and other acids with ethyl ic and other

ABLUTIONâ€”THE SKIN AND THE BATH. 29 upon the liver, bowels, or kidneys, and often results in their disease. In our warm climate, where the skin acts more freely than it does in colder latitudes, the use of the bath is certainly indispensable, if the health of the body is to be maintained at all. The cold bath, at any rate during the summer months, should always be taken before breakfast, but in the cooler part of the year the shock may be lessened, if it be desirable, by using tepid water instead of cold. And since there is, as we have seen, a good deal of oily matter excreted by the skin, it becomes necessary to use something in addition to water for cleansing purposes, for the latter is unable to dis- place the greasy collection by itself.

The face is then to be dipped into the water a second time and thoroughly rinsed,

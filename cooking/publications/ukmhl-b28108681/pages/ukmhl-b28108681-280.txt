236 THE ART OF LIVING IN AUSTRALIA. Australian wines there is a lamentable difference. Wines of the same denomination and from the same grower differ so materially one year from those bearing a similar name, and coming from the same cellar, in another, that it is difficult to believe they are the same. As Mr. Smith justly observes, this is an unpardonable defect in the estimation of connoisseurs ; more especially such as attach themselves to a particular kind of wine, and naturally drink it by preference. Constancy of type should be un- remittingly aimed at by the vigneron. And this can only be possible by continuous attention to each individual factor concerned in vine-growing and wine-making. THE FUTURE SUCCESS- OF THE AUSTRALIAN WINE INDUS- TRYâ€”AND UPON WHAT IT DEPENDS. Figures help us considerably more than words in enforc- ing a proper idea of the magnitude to which the Australian wine industry should develop. It will be appropriate, therefore, to preface this portion by bringing forward a few speculative data. In an earlier part of this chapter it was stated that the city of Paris alone requires nearly 300,000 gallons of wine daily, and that this single city would consume in 12 days all the wine which the whole of Australia takes 12 months to make. The population of Paris is nearly two and a half millions, while that of Australia is three millions odd. By considering these together it will be seen that the wine which it takes over three million people all the year to make, lasts another two and a half million people only 12 days. Now, the total annual wine yield of Australia, including both that used here and that which is exported, is only worth about 800,000?. It follows from the foregoing, then, that Paris will in 12 days consume about 800,000?. worth of wine, and for the whole year the Parisian figures for wine

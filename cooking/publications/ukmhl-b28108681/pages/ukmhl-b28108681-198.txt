154 THE ART OF LIVING IN AUSTRALIA. carefully cultivated for breeding purposes. He points out that the capacity of oysters for breeding is greatly aug- mented when they are collected together in a small space, in comparison with that of equal numbers thinly scattered over any extensive area. Each reserve in this way con- stitutes a prolific breeding centre for stocking the surround- ing waters, and by this means alone the process of restoring the natural beds is quickly accelerated. Indeed, he is particularly careful to draw attention to the fact that in the previously attempted establishment of artificial oyster fisheries a prominent error was in working too large areas. One or two acres intelligently cultivated can be made to produce far more substantial results than a very large area under inefficient management, and at a much less expenditure of time and money. A vast amount of money has been expended in different localities on the Yictorian coast for the purpose of developing the oyster fisheries. In the great majority of cases, however, the site selected was unsuitable for such a purpose, and the mode of culture adopted impracticable and inefficient. Eor in- stance, one place was the recipient of a vast amount of sedimentary deposits. Here he found that they had sur- rounded the chosen areas with fences of great height and strength, and closely wattled, for the purpose of catching and retaining the young oyster brood. Instead of this, however, they had simply acted as “ catch-pits,” which had accumulated soft oozy mud to the depth of several feet, and a few dead oyster shells were the only result. Instead of such an evident failure as this, he recommends oyster-spat collectors of two kinds, one consisting of extra thick split palings 4 ft. long by 8 in. wide, with a brick at- tached to each end to weigh them down, and at the same time to raise them off the ground. Several of them on being raised for inspection, after three months, were found to have

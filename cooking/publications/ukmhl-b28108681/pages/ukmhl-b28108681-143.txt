SCHOOL COOKERY-INFLUENCE ON DAILY LIFE. 99 intended that the sole object of education should be the principles of money making, hut at the same time there is a considerable amount of truth in his contention. But the chief purpose I have in view is to advocate a thorough and systematic teaching of Cookery to girls. In the re- maining part of this chapter, therefore, I shall endeavour to bring forward reasons in support of my proposition. COOKERY INSTRUCTION IN ENGLAND, NEW SOUTH WALES, AND VICTORIA. Under this heading I propose to describe briefly what is being done in connection with Cookery Instruction in the places mentioned. Now the principal object I have in view is to further the teaching of Cookery to girls during school life. It will, however, somewhat strengthen my advocacy if I refer to the beginning of this move- ment in England, for it undoubtedly had its origin in causes quite outside of any educational system. There is no question but that the increased facilities for communi- cation, resulting from the advent of steamships and rail- ways, gave to travel an impetus it never before experienced. And as a result thousands of people in the old country acquired a practical knowledge of Continental life, which would otherwise never have been theirs. These travellers saw for themselves the perfection of Cookery in countries like France, and naturally their eyes were opened to the neglect which culinary matters received in their own land ; at least, this seems to me a satisfactory explanation of what has occurred, and I put it forward, therefore, purely as a matter of personal opinion, and whether this is the right reason or not, it is quite certain that a desire for improvement in this direction is insensibly coming over our English people.

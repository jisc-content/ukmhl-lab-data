LEWIS & WHITTYâ€™S BORAX SOAP IS The PUREST and BEST. SOLD EVERYWHERE. [Copy of a Letter from Dr. Fortescue.J Dear Sirs, I am very well pleased with the whole of the Wines sent last week. I never tasted any Australian Wines to equal them; and, there are some that would be most valuable in cases of debility. If you can keep up the supply of these choice Old Wines, I will send you many buyers, and you are at liberty to use my name should you wish to do so. Sincerely yours, (Signed) FORTESCUE, M.B. Messrs. FI. Hookings & Co., 108, Pitt Street, Sydney.

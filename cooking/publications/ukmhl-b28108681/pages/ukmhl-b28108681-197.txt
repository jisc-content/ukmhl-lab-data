FISH AND OYSTERS—THEIR FOOT VALUE. 158 THE RE-CREATION OF OUR OYSTER FISHERIES. If one only looks to the conduct of some of those who have been engaged in our oyster fisheries, the reason for their present defective state will be readily apparent. The Fisheries Commissioners well express it when they state that “ If a person takes up ground only for the purpose “ of collecting and selling whatever oysters he finds upon “ it, and bestows no care in providing for the continuity “ of the supply, that ground must cease to be produc- “ tive.” And apart from this it will be found that even when every effort has been made to provide for continuous supply, yet the matter is by no means easy. The truth is the oyster fisheries have been managed in a happy-go-lucky way. There has been but little care taken in their conservation, and the inevitable result is that the winnings, as the official figures show, are rapidly failing. The same thing is not peculiar to Australia, however, and has happened everywhere else where the same careless policy has been pursued. We have, then, a grain of comfort from the fact that it is not confined to us. In our own case the Fisheries Commissioners have re- peatedly called attention to the need for certain legisla- tive reform in connection with our oysteries. They assert, in fact, that “ it is absolutely imperative that our oyster “ beds and deposits must be regulated on quite a different “ system to that which obtains under the existing law.” Mr. Saville Kent, who has been investigating the cause of failure in connection with the oyster fisheries of Vic- toria, not so long ago, has made some interesting recom- mendations. The principle of his system is to establish on selected spots, in the neighbourhood of the formerly most productive natural oyster grounds, small Government reserves, whereon stocks of oysters shall be laid down and

FISH AND OYSTERS— THEIR FOOD VALUE. 147 other colonies—New Zealand and Queensland—for two- thirds of our supply. Again, Mr. Lindsay Thompson, the chief inspector of New South Wales fisheries, in his recent official work, The Fisheries of Neiv South Wales, makes the following statements :—In the year 1871 no less than 93,000 bushels of oysters were obtained from the New South Wales beds, which, indeed, helped to supply the Yictorian as well as our own needs; in the year 1883 there was a fall to 46,377 bushels ; while in 1891 our fisheries yielded only 14,181 bushels. This is a very significant shrinkage, and shows a remarkable falling off in the winnings. It is still maintained by some, however, that there has been a succes- sion of bad spatting years, and that the supply may yet reach to something of its old proportions. It will be instructive, then, in this connection to refer briefly to the efforts which legislation has made to remedy matters in New South Wales. Under the old Oyster Beds Act of 1868 the areas given to lessees were somewhat large, and consequently what with the prolific natural supply, and a relatively small population, they appeared to be doing too well. It was urged, therefore, that the holdings should be more restricted in size, and that in this way a large num- ber of small occupiers would be afforded a means of living, while at the same time these smaller areas would receive more attention. By the Fisheries Act of 1881 a new era dawned upon the oyster fisheries of this colony, and a sys- tem of licensing small holdings was initiated. Under this Act licensed dredging was permitted, but with such disas- trous results that within two years a Fisheries Act Amend- ment Act had to be passed. What happened, in short, was that the beds were actually skinned, so that the total dis- appearance of the oyster was looming in the distance. But even the passing of this latter Act was powerless to check the evil, and by the Oyster Fisheries Act of 1884 (the

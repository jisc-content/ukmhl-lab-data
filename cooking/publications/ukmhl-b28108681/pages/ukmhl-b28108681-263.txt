219 AUSTEALIAN WINE. quality is enormously increased by the development of those delicate and subtle ethers which have so much to do with the flavour and bouquet of all wines. The operation of racking, consequently, is one of great importance, as it requires to be repeated from time to time. A copious deposit of lees generally takes place after the first racking, and a second one should speedily follow. During the first year young wines are often racked off as many as three times, but with the older wines once a year, at the beginning, of spring, may be sufficient. But it is precisely in matters of this kind that judgment and experience are so much needed. Now, it has been pointed out over and over again that it is solely by a correct treatment of Australian wines in the cellar that we can hope to attain to excellence; in fact, the whole secret lies in this direction. And it is very much to be regretted, therefore, that cellar management and wine treatment have not yet been conceded their proper position, that of being the principal factors in the success of Aus- tralian wine. Amongst others, this very truth was pointed out by Mr. Pownall, to whom I have previously referred. In giving evidence before the Vegetable Products Com- mission of Victoria in August 1889, he observed:—44 In “ some of the cellars I have been horrified with the amount “ of Avine which I should describe as 4perished’ and as “ 4 perishing.’ It is astounding. I can hardly express the “ quantity. And very often the vine-grower is so ignorant “ of his business that he shows one wine which is 4 tart ’ “ and 4 sour,’ and even praises it. I find those wines are 44 generally exceeding three years old, and I attribute it to 44 the lack of cellar knowledge and treatment, because in the 44 same cellar where I find large quantities of bad wine I 44 find this year’s and last year’s wine good, and promising 44 well; but if longer kept, and so treated, after a few years 44 it will be utterly useless.”

BOX 919. G.P.O. 229, CLARENCE STREET, SYDNEY. PITT BROWN & CO. “CUP BLEND” AND “ASSAM BLEND” PURE TEAS. Patient: And now, Doctor, what about Tea? Doctor: Drink “CUP BLEND”; it is perfectly pure, and is also the most palatable. Or if you prefer a stronger Tea, I should advise the “ASSAM BLEND.” I have used them my- self for the last eight years.

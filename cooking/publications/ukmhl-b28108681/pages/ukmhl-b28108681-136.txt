In all probability there are but few who have ever had their attention called to certain figures duly set forth with- in the pages of that mine of information, namely, Mr. T. A. Coghlan’s Wealth and Progress of New South Wales. Nevertheless, the facts associated with these statistics so directly concern our Australian daily life that they deserve to be widely known. That portion of the work in which our food supply is considered, therefore, is well worth refer- ring to.

Thus the amount of meat required for each member of the community every year in New South Wales is 291 lbs.; in Victoria 275 lbs.; whilst in Queensland 370 lbs. are called for. On the other hand, in the United Kingdom only 109 lbs. are similarly needed ; in the United States of America 150 lbs.; while the figures for the different European countries show an average of no more than 70 lbs.

The tables show that for each inhabi-

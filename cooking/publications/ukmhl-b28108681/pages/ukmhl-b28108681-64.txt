So far as its effects on the people are concerned, it does not appear to hinder the ordi- nary occupations of life. Some invalids are better during its continuance, some worse ; but all weakly people feel some depression after “ the change ” comes. The aged are gene- rally better in hot winds, unless they suffer from disease. South Australia.—As far as the southern regions of the colony are concerned, we may say, speaking generally, that light winds and calms are a very distinctive characteristic. The prevailing wind in the summer is the S.E., varied by sea-breezes during the day. In the winter there are mostly dry, cold N.E. winds, broken at intervals by westerly and S.W. gales of moderate strength, squalls, and rain. The best and heaviest rainfalls are those which set in with the surface winds at N.E., the rain increasing in intensity as the Avind veers to N.W., and breaking up into showers and squalls as it veers to S.W. In the interior, north of, say, latitude 30° to about 18° S., the prevailing wind all the year is the S.E. North of latitude 18° to the north coast the country is Avell Avithin the influence of the north-AATcst mon- soon during the summer months, with frequent thunder- storms and heavy rains ; and during the winter dry S.E. Avinds prevail. Queensland.—Eastern Queensland (or rather the Pacific Slope) is very seldom troubled Avith hot winds. The hot Avinds of “ continental ” Queensland are always very dry, and are usually accompanied by dust storms.

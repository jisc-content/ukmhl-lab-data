FISH AND OYSTERS—THEIR FOOD VALUE. 135 the water, thus forming a long wall against which the fish “ strike,” and get enmeshed by being caught in the gill opening. The nets are kept on the stretch by being “ shot ” in the face of the wind, and the vessel from which they are paid out, being to leeward of them, drifts more rapidly than they do, and consequently keeps them well extended. My object, however, is not so much to enter into the details of these different methods of deep-sea fishing as to indicate their value and necessity, if we are to have any fisheries worth speaking of. I shall, therefore, do no more than briefly mention a few other modes of fish capture. Thus, at the mouth of the Thames, thousands of tons of sprats are caught every winter by means of the large bag net, known as the stow net. In shape it is like an enormous funnel, 30 feet high, 20 feet wide, and nearly 180 feet in length. By means of this contrivance the yield of sprats is so great that there is often some little difficulty in disposing of the catch. The renowned whitebait, too, which are be- lieved to be young herrings, are caught by means of a similar, though much smaller, net. »-v. • Besides these and various other forms of net fishing, there are the methods in which the long line is employed. For the capture of the cod, both in Newfoundland and in the North Sea, what is called the bultow is used. This is a long line many hundreds of feet in length, and at every twelfth foot shorter and smaller cords called “ snoods ” are fastened. These “ snoods ” are about 6 feet long, and have the hooks attached to their free ends. The bultow is “ shot ” across the tide to prevent entanglement of the hooks, and is laid in the afternoon. At daybreak, when the lines are hauled in, as many as 400 of the large cod sometimes result from the catch. There are various other appliances used for fish capture in different parts of the world, such as the purse-seine net,

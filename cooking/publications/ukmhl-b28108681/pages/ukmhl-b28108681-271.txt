AUSTRALIAN WINE. 227 “ excellence. Moreover, these wines need the most skilful “ cellar treatment during the long years they are maturing. “ All great wines, it should be remembered, ripen slowly, “ and cannot be ‘pasturised’ into perfection—that is to “ say, cannot be rapidly matured by heating them to a “ certain temperature, as ordinary wines may be.” The Hochheim vineyards are situated, as I have previously indicated, on the banks of the Maine, several miles above its confluence with the Rhine. There is one exceptionally fine Hochheim growth which comes from the vineyard of the “ Dechanei,” or deanery. True Hochheimer is a remark- ably aromatic wine, and possesses both body and fire. In- deed, it contains as large a percentage of alcohol as the so- called noble Steinberger—the most spirituous of the Rhenish growths—with more sweetness. It consequently lacks that subdued acidulous freshness of flavour which is such a marked characteristic of the wines of the Rheingau. Some reference to sherry and port is necessary, because they are both types of wines that are widely known, and consequently any remarks concerning them are of value by comparison. It would appear that with most sherry, and certainly with all port, there is an addition of alcohol to the wine. Even the wines which are sold in England under the name of “ natural sherry ” contain from 13*2 to 15*5 percent, of alcohol. Beyond all question, therefore, from 1| to 3J per cent, of alcohol must have been added, for no “natural sherry ” should ever contain more than 12 per cent, of alcohol. Some sherries, however, have been introduced with an alcoholicity of from 12 to 13’6 per cent., with the fol- lowing characters: The taste is freely vinous, rich, pure, mellow, and quite free from heat or the taste of added spirit. But fashion has much to do with the type of sherry in request; thus the colour has varied from time to time. In the same way, too, a taste for dry sherries arose with the

46 THE AFT OF LIVING IN A USTFALIA. the breath and lungs deposit themselves throughout the room. Nor are the ill-effects of impure air confined to man alone, for it is well known that cows, horses, sheep, and other animals, when penned up in close quarters, show an increased death-rate from many diseases. But though it is perfectly plain that badly ventilated sleeping apartments tend greatly to the production of diseases of the lungs, it is not generally understood by the greater number of persons that diseases of the heart are brought on by similar conditions, and there is without doubt a great increase of heart diseases at the present time. It is estimated that upwards of 10,000 people in England alone die yearly from affections of the heart; yet, taking into consideration the ceaseless work of that organ (in the words of the motto upon Goethe’s ring, “ Ohne Rast ”— without rest), it is wonderful that it is not more frequently diseased. It is said that “ the heart is a small muscular “ organ weighing only a few ounces, beating perpetually “ day and night, morning and evening, summer and winter ; “ and yet often an old man’s heart nearly a hundred years “ of age is as perfect and complete as when he was a “ young man of twenty ” (Haughton). The effect of impure air in its action on the heart is thus spoken of by Dr. Cornelius Black : “ I showed the effect of “ impure air in promoting the degenerative tendency in “ the structures of the heart, and especially those of the “ right side of the heart, after the age of forty.

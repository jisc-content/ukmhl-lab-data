140 THE ABT OF LIVING IN AUSTRALIA. arrival of a large amount of fish with a consequent glut in the market. But the “ bummarees ” pure and simple are com- paratively few. Their ranks, however, are swelled in the following way : A salesman, having disposed of his own fish, will “ bummaree ” for the sake of the possible profit, or a fishmonger, having purchased a double supply for a cheaper price, will “ bummaree ” half his purchase. In France the procedure is different. First of all there is an agent termed an ecoreur, deputed by various persons and armed with purchasing power, who is ready to buy the fisherman’s catch at once. This simplifies matters wonder- fully for the fisherman, who gets ready money and has no further bother. Next, from the ecoreur the fish is bought by the moreyeur, or trader, who despatches it to Paris and the other large cities. Thus, so far, the fish, after leaving the fisherman, has passed through two hands, those of the ecoreur, and those of the moreyeur. After this it has to face a most unjust tax—the octroi—by which all pro- visions are specially taxed before entering the “ barriers ” of any French city or town. Hence the initiated, when travelling in France, often reside on the outskirts of a town, just outside the barrier, where the cost of living is reduced by one-third. On arriving at the markets the fish is publicly disposed of by the facteurs a la criee, or auctioneers, who of course are paid for their trouble. Lastly, it is bought for sale to the public by the jpoissarde, or fishwife. And thus we see from the time of leaving the water till finally it reaches the unfortunate public the fish has passed through no less than six levies, that by the fisherman, the agent, the trader, the octroi (i.e. the city toll or town due), the auctioneer, and, finally, that by the fishwife or costermonger. Having thus explained the system pursued in England and in France respectively, it will be interesting to refer

HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 56 Cold Meat Rolls. i lb. Cooked Meat. 8 Cooked Potatoes. 1 Onion. Butter. Flour. Pepper and Salt. Chop up the cooked meat and the onion (also cooked) very finely, and season with pepper and salt. Mash the potatoes smoothly, and add to them a tea- spoonful of butter or dripping melted, then whisk them over the fire to dry. Turn the whole out on the table, and add as much Hour as the potatoes will take up, and roll the potato paste out about a quarter of an inch thick. Cut it into pieces about 6 inches square. Place on each piece a spoonful of the chopped meat; wet the edges, and double the paste over one side above the other, and press the ends down. Place these oblong rolls on a greased tin, and bake till they become a light brown colour, or fry them in hot fat in a frying-pan. Some fine Bread-crumbs. The mutton for this dish should be cut from the back ribs above the loin, and is best not to be too heavy mutton. The same part of lamb may be used instead of mutton. The cutlets should have a bone in each, and the bone should be 5 or 6 inches long. Saw or chop oft the chine bone, that, is the bone at the thick end, as it spoils the shape of the cutlet. Then flatten each with a wetted chopper; afterwards trim them neatly, leaving half an inch of bone bare at the Mutton Cutlets. 1 lb. of Mutton from the ribs. 1 Egg. Pepper and Salt. Some Mashed Potatoes.

STEWING AND ROASTING OF MEAT. 55 Tripe, to Clean. If the tripe cannot be got cleaned, empty and wash it thoroughly with cold water; then put it in a pot with cold water, in which there is a good piece of soda; let it get hot, but on no account must it be allowed to boil; then take it out and scrape it white. Let it lie all night in cold water with a little butter milk in it, and next day it will be ready to be cooked. Sea Pie. 1 lb. Meat. 1 Onion. I Carrot. 1 Turnip. i teaspoonful Baking Powder, i lb. Flour. i lb. Suet. Pepper and Salt. Put the meat, cut in rather small pieces, into a middling-sized stew-pan; cut up the carrot and turnip in small pieces, and sprinkle them over the meat, and also the onion, chopped finely ; then pepper and salt to taste. Pour in water to cover the meat and vege- tables ; set the stew-pan on the fire, and bring to the boil. Put into a basin the flour and suet chopped very finely, and rub them together; add a pinch of salt and half a teaspoonful of baking powder, and mix all well. Make this into a paste with cold water; roll it out into a round cake the size of the stew-pan, and put it neatly upon the top of the meat and vegetables; cover closely with the lid, and let it stew gently for an hour- and-a-lialf. Lift the paste carefully off, dish the meat and vegetables, and place the cake of paste on the top, and serve.

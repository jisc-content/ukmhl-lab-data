127 PRESERVES. Candied Peel. Skins of 6 Oranges or Lemons. | 1 lb. Crystallised Sugar. Put the skins in salt and water to soak for a few days ; then put them on in a sauce-pan, with fresh cold water, to boil till they are quite soft, which is known by the head of a pin being easily put in. Remove them from the sauce-pan, drain, and put them in a basin. Boil a pound of sugar and a breakfast-cupful of water for a few minutes, and pour it over the peel in the basin, and allow it to stand thus for about a week. Pour the syrup into the sauce-pan and allow it to boil up; put the peel in and let it boil gently till it looks clear, which will be in about a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes. Take it out and spread it on a dish, put a little of the syrup in the hollows, dust some line sugar over, and put it in the sun or a warm place till dry and candied. When dry, put away in a jar. Bramble Jelly. Gather the brambles in dry weather if possible. Pick^them, and put them into a jelly-pan. To about 4 lbs. of brambles, put 1 lb. apples, cut up in small bits. The apples had better be washed, and need not be pared. Put them in the jelly-pan with the brambles ; add as much cold water as covers all the fruit. Boil this gently for perhaps 15 or 20 minutes, till all the fruit is quite a pulp. Put it into a pointed jelly bag, and allow it to drip perhaps all night. Measure the juice then, and to each pint add 1 lb. sugar ; boil from 10 to 15 minutes, and put in jars.

CAKES AND BAKING. 97 Put into a smaller basin an ounce of German yeast and a teaspoonful of soft sugar; mix it to a smooth paste with a little lukewarm water as starch is mixed; when quite smooth pour in 2| breakfast-cupfuls of lukewarm water, and mix thoroughly ; now pour all this liquid into the basin of flour, and with a spoon mix it thoroughly. All the flour should be wet, but not in the least sloppy, and it should be the thick- ness of a good paste. It may be necessary to add a little more water; if so, add it carefully. When the whole is mixed well, knead it a little with the hand, and sprinkle a little flour on the top. Cover the basin with a plate, and put it where it will keep at the same heat, to “rise” for 1| hours. Then add a little flour to the dough in the basin to help to gather it from the sides, and, still adding a very little flour, punch and knead it well. When the paste is well gathered into a mass, and not sticking to the basin, turn it out on a table and knead it for 10 minutes, always adding a little flour—at least half a pound of flour will be added during this kneading process. Divide this paste into 4 loaves, which either make up shaped like cottage loaves and put them on a floured oven plate, or make like pan loaves and put them in shapes floured inside. Set the loaves in a warm place to rise for 20 minutes or a quarter of an hour. Then put them into a father quick oven to bake for about half-an-hour. The quantity of water that is required to make bread depends greatly on the flour used. Fine flour requires more water than coarse, and consequently it makes a larger quantity of bread ; but it requires also a little more yeast. The above recipe is for ordinary Hour. G

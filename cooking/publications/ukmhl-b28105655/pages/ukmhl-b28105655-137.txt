While the garments are drying, take them down and shake well, if possible between two persons; at all events shake two or three times during the process of drying, and hang up again. If the garment be a knitted one, then pull it into shape backwards and for- wards, here and there, and hang up again, putting the peg in a different place each time. Thus you will keep the flannel soft and woolly, which is as it ought to be. Coloured flannels must be quickly washed in the same way, and if the colour is suitable, a little vinegar may be added to the last warm water, as it fastens and brightens certain colours. Stockings.—All flannel garments and stockings ought to be washed on the right side in the first water, then, in the second, turned outside in and washed again. Stockings may have soap rubbed on heels and toes, otherwise soap should not be rubbed; then wring out across the stocking—that is, roll it up from the toe to the top, and wring so. When turned and washed in the second water, wring, shake out, fold, and clap. New flannels are generally a little more troublesome to wash, and require care, else they are never quite nice.

One plan is to soak flannel in cold water, which certainly extracts some of the sulphur, but that plan is very troublesome, and not a very good one for large articles, such as blankets, etc. The best plan is to rub

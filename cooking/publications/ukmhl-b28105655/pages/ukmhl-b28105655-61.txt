STEWING AND ROASTING OF MEAT. 57 top. Sprinkle a little pepper and salt over each : now beat up the egg on a plate, and dip the cutlets in this and then into the bread-crumbs. Pat each cutlet either with the hand or a knife, to put the bread- crumbs smooth and firmly into it. Now put a table-spoonful of sweet dripping into a frying-pan; when it is quite hot, put in the cutlets and fry a golden colour on each side. Have the potatoes nicely boiled and mashed; make them into a heap in the centre of a dish, and put the cutlets neatly round; some good brown or tomato sauce may be served with the dish. Cold Meat Mince. 1 lb. Cooked Meat. 2 Eggs. Bread. Milk. Onion, Carrot and Turnip. Flour. Ketchup. Pepper and Salt. Take a pound of lean cooked meat and chop it up very finely; soak a thick slice of bread in milk, and press the milk well out when quite soaked; beat it up with a fork, add it to the beef, and mix all well together; add pepper and salt to taste; now beat up one egg, and mix it with the meat and bread. Have a nice deep pudding-dish, butter it well inside, and cut up, in small pieces, a hard-boiled egg. Ornament the bottom and sides of the pudding-dish very neatly with the egg; press the mixture in, and when baked for an hour, turn it out gently. Make a sauce as in recipe for Brown Sauce (page 91); use the bones to make the stock for it.

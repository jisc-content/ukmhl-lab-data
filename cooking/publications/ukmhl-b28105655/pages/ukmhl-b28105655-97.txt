SAUCES. 93 Melted Butter. 1 oz. Butter. 1 breakfast-cupful of 1 oz. Flour. Water. Put into a small sauce-pan the butter and the flour, and stir over the fire till the butter has absorbed the flour; add a breakfast-cupful of water, weak broth, or milk, and stir till it boils and thickens; season with pepper and salt, and serve very hot. This mode of proceeding insures the melted butter being perfectly smooth. Sweet Melted Butter Sauce. Butter. Sugar. Flour. Flavouring. Put | oz. of butter and | oz. of flour in a small sauce-pan, and stir over the fire till smooth; add half a pint of water, and stir till it boils and thickens; then add a table-spoonful of sugar and some essence of cloves or cinnamon, or any flavouring preferred, and serve in a sauce-tureen. Pudding sauces should be rather thicker than good cream. Mint Sauce. 1 table-spoonful of Green Mint. 1 dessert-spoonful of Sugar. 1 gill of Vinegar. 1 table-spoonful of Hot Water. Wash and pick the mint carefully, and chop it up. Mix the sugar, vinegar, and water in the sauce-tureen, and stir in the mint. It is better to be made an hour before being required, in order to flavour the vinegar well with the mint.

For the cooking of all meat which is not to be made into soup, but either stewed, roasted, or broiled, one rule, without exception, appliesâ€”namely, that the out- side of the meat be quickly subjected to strong heat; in order to shut up all the pores, after which a slower process of cooking should be proceeded with, such as suits each particular kind of meat. To stew meat is the most profitable of those three methods of cooking, as no part of the meat is lost, and there is, besides, a good gravy which supplements it. The principle of all stewing, whether applied to beef, mutton, chicken, or game, is, first of all, to put into a pot some kind of fat (either butter, suet, or dripping) and make it quite hot; then put i% the piece of meat, small or large, and fry it all round to shut the pores; then put in less or more water or other liquid, and stew the meat for the given time. This rule applies alike to small pieces of steak or large joints. The reason is, that the heat hardens the albumen in the meat all over the surface, and stops up the pores like sealing-wax on bottles; the juice is thus kept in, so that the meat cooked is much more savoury. Roasting is a more wasteful way of cooking; but roasted meat, if well cooked, is more easily digested. A roast should be put very near a hot fire for 5 minutes to shut up the pores, and after wards put

Pare the rind of the lemons very thinly; put it in a very nice sauce-pan with the water and boil gently for a quarter of an hour; then add the juice of the lemons, and boil for a quarter of an hour more with the lid very closely shut. Strain it all through a jelly-bag, and put it back into the pot with the sugar and citric acid, and let it all boil gently for 5 minutes. Allow it to cool, and bottle for use. This syrup is delightful, and will keep for any length of time. It may be used either with water or potash water.

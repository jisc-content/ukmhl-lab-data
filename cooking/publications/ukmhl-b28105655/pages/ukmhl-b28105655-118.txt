114 HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. Suet and Milk. 2 breakfast-cupfuls Milk. | 1 table-spoonful Suet, chopped up. Boil the milk and suet together for 10 minutes, and strain; add either a teaspoonful of sugar or a small pinch of salt. This is excellent for a weak chest. Arrowroot. 1 dessert-spoonful Arrowroot. 1 breakfast-cupful Milk or 1 teaspoonful Sugar. Water. Wet the arrowroot in a small basin with a table- spoonful of cold milk. Boil what remains of the milk, and when boiling pour it over the arrowroot, stirring all the time, and sweeten it with the sugar. It then becomes a clear thick jelly. It is equally good made with either milk or water, but for some sicknesses water is preferable. It is made into a small pudding by the addition of 1 well-beaten egg stirred in and baked for a quarter of an hour. Arrowroot is best not to be boiled. Gruel. Put in a small basin a table-spoonful of Scotch oat- meal, and after wetting it with a very little cold water, pour over it a pint of boiling water or milk, stirring all the time; stir for a few minutes, and then allow it to settle 1 minute. Pour carefully into a clean sauce- pan all the liquid, which stir over the fire till it boils. Let it boil for 10 minutes, when it is ready for use. It may be sweetened with honey, sugar, treacle, or may be flavoured with salt or a small piece of butter but should be taken very hot.

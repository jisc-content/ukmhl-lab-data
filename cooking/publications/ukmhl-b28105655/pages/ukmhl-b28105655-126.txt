If there is chicory, it colours the water red and sinks to the bottom of the glass, whereas pure coffee floats on the top Cocoa. Cocoa is a very nourishing beverage, and very suit- able for those persons of nervous temperament for whom tea or coffee is too stimulating. It is sometimes found to be a little indigestible though nourishing. Put 2 teaspoonfuls of cocoa in a breakfast-cup, and moisten it with a little cold milk or water; then fill up the cup with boiling milk and water in about equal proportions; stir well, and sweeten to taste. Cocoa is very much adulterated, and, indeed, to such an extent, that prepared cocoa is frequently sold at a cheaper rate than the nibs can be procured at. For this reason many persons use cocoa nibs, which must be bruised and boiled for about 3 or 4 hours; then the floating fat removed from the top. It yields a very pleasant and much lighter beverage than the other. o o Water which has been boiled for any length of time should not be used for any kind of food or drink, as long boiling causes the water to lose its gases, and its mineral substances get deposited on the bottom and sides of the kettle, making the water insipid and less nourishing.

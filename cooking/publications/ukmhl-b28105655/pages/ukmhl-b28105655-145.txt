141 LAUNDRY WORK. Cold-water Starch is often made by soaking the starch in cold water several davs before it is to be t/ used. It may be made thus :— Take any quantity of starch you wish, and put it in a jar sufficiently large. Cover it with plenty of cold water, and leave it for several days, or even a week or two. It ought to be covered carefully, both with cloth and lid, to exclude all dust. When the starch is to be used, pour off all the water that may be on the top, and take of the starch 1 table-spoonful; put this in a basin and add to it 1 breakfast-cupful of cold water, and throughly mix them; dissolve 1 teaspoonful of borax and 1 teaspoon- ful of turpentine in a quarter-teacupful of boiling water; add this to the contents of the basin, and use. The advantage of thus soaking the starch before- hand is this, that it gives it plenty of time to dissolve, and so becomes very smooth and nice. What starch remains in the jar should have plenty more cold water poured on, and be left till again required, and used in the same way. Starch is often old, or long kept and dry, and is therefore difficult to dissolve. Care must always be taken to dissolve it thoroughly. To Starch a Shirt.—Turn the right side out, then gather up the breast and collar neatly in the left hand, dip it in clean cold water, and wring it out. This is to make the part to be starched wet, as the rest of the shirt must be dry, else it would not iron at once. Do the same to the cuffs. Then dip breast and collar in the starch, and give a little rub with the right hand to make the starch go well into it, and then wring out. Next do the very same to the cuffs.

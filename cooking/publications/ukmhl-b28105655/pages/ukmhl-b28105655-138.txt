Finish exactly like other flannels. To Wash Prints.—Prints require great care in washing, or they will lose their colour and look very bad. Prints with fast colours should be washed thus:— Put enough melted soap in warm, but not at all hot, water; have a second water ready with a little melted soap—also warm. There must be no alkali at all. Wash the article quickly in the first water, and then in the second. Then rinse thoroughly, fold, clap, and hang up to dry. Repeat this till all are finished. Prints with doubtful colours are washed the same way in the first two waters. Into the rinsing water put a handful of salt, which helps to fasten the colour. If the water looks dirty in the case of black prints, repeat the rinsing again and again until it looks clean. In blue, green, pink, and red prints put vinegar in the rinsing water, which brightens those colours. If the print is desired stiff, make some hot-water starch, and starch it while wet. Turn the wrong side out, and hang up in the air, but not in the sun, as the sun takes the colour out. Take down before quite dry, sprinkle with water those parts that require damping, fold, and clap ready for ironing. Iron with a hot iron on the right side.

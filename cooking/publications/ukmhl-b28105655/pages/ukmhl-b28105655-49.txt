STEWING AND ROASTING OF MEAT. 45 be drained and put between the folds of a towel to dry, then put in the pan with the steak if there is room, and fried at the same time ; they should have a little colour, without being over-browned. The steak is dished up with the onions round it. Put in the pan a teaspoonful of flour, sprinkled in, a table-spoonful of ketchup, pepper and salt, and a teacupful of water; stir them till they boil, and strain the sauce over the steak. The flour and the ketchup may be omitted. Hough of Beef Stewed, Hough of Beef Turnip. Carrot. Onions. Have a nice piece of the thick part of the hough, about 4 or 5 lbs.; take all the marrow from the bone, cut it in little bits, and put in a stew-pan on the fire. After the marrow has become quite hot, put in the piece of meat and fry it brown all round, par- ticularly at the ends, to shut up the pores of the meat; when quite well fried, pour off any remains of fat in the pot, and add a pint of water; put the lid closely on, and allow it to stew very slowly for an hour; now add a carrot cut in quarters, a turnip neatly cut, and 2 onions halved. Allow all to stew for an-hour-and-a- half longer. Slow stewing makes the muscles of the shin to swell and become very tender; but if cooked too fast, this piece of meat is spoiled. This is a profit- able as well as a very nice dish, if stewed for 2£ or 3 hours. Put the meat on a dish with the vegetables round, and the gravy poured over. N.B.—Care must be taken that the gravy does not dry up too much, and that the stewing is extremely slow.

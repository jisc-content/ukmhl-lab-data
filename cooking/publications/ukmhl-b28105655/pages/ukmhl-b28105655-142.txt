It will be found very easy, and you had better not use a rubbing or washing board, because that, like all rubbing, wears the fabric. Also, do not rub your hands, but hold the cloth in such a way that cloth rubs on cloth, and not on your bare hands. When this is finished, prepare another water with very little melted soap in it, and pretty warm. Wash the clothes through this, and before boiling give them a good rinse in a tub with plenty of clean, cold water; wring out, and they are ready for the boiler. It is very good and necessary to rinse the clothes (it need only be a rough rinse) before boiling them, because it takes all the dirty water away. If any remains, it is apt to boil into them and discolour them. Repeat this process with the coarser articles, and finally use up the soapy water to soak and wash out kitchen towels and dusters. To Boil White Clothes.—Put about 3 gallons of water in the boiler, and add 2 table-spoonfuls of melted soap and 1 dessert-spoonful of paraffin. Let this all boil up ; put in the finest clothes to fill the boiler, press them down with a stick, and allow them to boil for half-an-hour. The water must be boiling when the clothes go in, and be kept boiling, else the paraffin will stain. This quantity of either paraffin or turpentine is excellent for cleansing—whitening and disinfecting —and does no harm whatever. After the boiling is finished, take them out into cold water, rub out, rinse again in more water, and the clothes are ready to blue. If fine muslins or many small articles are to be boiled, they might with advantage be put in a bag, as they are apt to get torn when being taken from the boiler.

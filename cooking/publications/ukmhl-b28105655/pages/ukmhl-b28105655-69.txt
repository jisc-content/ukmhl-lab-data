VEGETABLES. 6 E Potatoes Mashed. The best way to mash potatoes, in a plain way, is to take a strong fork and stir or whisk them with it till they become smooth and light. The longer they are whisked the lighter they become. Add a very little sweet milk, and stir them well; then dish them up very neatly in a heap. When potatoes are pared before boiling, it should be very thinly indeed, as the best part is next the skin; then put into cold water at once, and boil according to the directions given. Leeks, to Boil. 6 Leeks. ^ oz. Butter. ^ oz. Flour. ^ teaspoonful of Sugar. Pepper and Salt. Â£ pint Milk. 1 slice Toast. Select leeks about the thickness of a finger, and cut them all about the same length, leaving scarcely any of the green part on, and wash them very carefully and trim them neatly. Tie them in a bundle, and put into a small stew-pan, with boiling water and a little salt, to parboil for 5 minutes, when they should be drained and afterwards put into a clean sauce-pan, with enough milk to cover, and the sugar. Let them stew in this till tender, about 20 minutes or more, according to age, and dish them on toast. Thicken the milk with half an ounce of butter and half an ounce of flour kneaded together, which season to taste, and, after allowing it to boil, pour over the leeks. They may be cut in inch-lengths if preferred, and piled high on the toast. E

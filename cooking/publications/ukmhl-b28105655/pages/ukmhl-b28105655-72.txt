HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 68 * PUDDINGS. The most important article that enters into the com- position of puddings is milk. It is a perfect food, and contains all the substances necessary to sustain life, and in the young of animals does sustain life for a lengthened period. It is converted into solid food in the stomach on the same principle by which milk is converted into cheese. The gastric juices in the stomach separate the milk, so that there is a solid part like curd, and a liquid like whey. Two cupfuls of new milk contain as much nourishment as- a mutton chop, and the same quantity of milk makes an ounce of cheese; so that an ounce of cheese contains as much nourishment or nitrogenous food as a mutton chop. This gives an idea of the value of milk as food. The cream of the milk is carbonaceous, and milk itself contains a large proportion of mineral food. Eggs are much used in the composition of pud- dings, and it is desirable that their value be well understood. They are very nutritious, and contain a great deal of nitrogenous food in a remarkably concentrated form. A henâ€™s egg of average size weighs If ounces, and contains water, albumen, fat, oil, and mineral matter. It is said that 18 eggs contain as much flesh-forming substance and other nutrients as would suffice for an adult man for a day, and it would be necessary to consume 70 lbs. of fruit, such as a pear, to provide the same amount of albumen or nitrogenous food. This very strikingly shows the concentrated nourishment

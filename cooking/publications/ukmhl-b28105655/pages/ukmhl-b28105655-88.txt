84 HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. Apple Dumplings Baked. The same ingredients are required as in the previous recipe, only use 2 oz. of butter or dripping instead of suet, and add a dessert-spoonful of sugar to the paste. Make the paste up as before described, then divide it, and inclose the apples in each piece ; when rolled quite round, brush the top of each over with a little beaten egg or milk, and sprinkle a little sugar over. Place the 6 dumplings on a greased baking-sheet, and bake for half-an-hour. One clove, a little grated lemon rind, or a little nutmeg, may be put with the sugar in the core of each apple, and will give it a nice flavour. Pancakes. I lb. of Flour. 1 Egg. Â£ pint Milk. Sugar. 1 pinch Salt. Put into a basin a teacupful of flour (which is a quarter of a lb.), and add the salt to it. Beat up the egg well, and add to it a small breakfast- cupful of milk, which is half a pint, and mix them very gradually with the flour, to prevent lumps; and when all is poured in, beat it up for a few minutes. Have a small frying-pan if possible, and melt a piece of butter about the size of a small nut in it; then pour in as much of the mixture as thinly covers the pan, and allow it to cook till it gets firm, which takes a minute or two. Shake the pan, and turn the pancake over to cook the other side ; then turn out on a plate, and after sprinkling the top with sugar, roll it up. Repeat the same process till all the material is finished; and send to table covered up, and very warm.

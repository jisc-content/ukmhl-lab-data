50 HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. To Truss it. Fold back the first point of the wings; take off the legs, and push the thigh bone well up. Take a skewer, and with it catch up the end of the wing and the back joint of the leg; run it over the back, and catch the other leg and wing in the same wayj put a trussing- needle and a bit of string through the side bone of the fowl over the ends of the legs, and tie it firmly round the end of the back-bone. Have a pot with 2 quarts of water boiling, into which put the fowl with the breast down, and boil it 1 or 1 b hours, according to age. When boiled, take it up, remove the skewer and string, and pour over it egg sauce, or any other white sauce preferable. A Good Breakfast Dish. 4 lbs. Pork. Onions. 1 Pork Tongue Pepper. Sage. Take a piece of pickled pork, the thin part of the belly, which should be about 8 or 9 inches broad, and rather more than that long; take out the bones and flatten it a little; get a good pork tongue, which, like the pork, has been salted for a few days; sprinkle on the pork a few leaves of sage chopped finely, and a middling-sized onion chopped ; also some pepper. Roll the tongue up in the middle of the pork into a nice roll; bind it outside with a long slip of calico, rolled round neatly and tightly. Put it on covered with cold water, and boil gently for 4 or 5 hours, allowing it to become nearly cold in the water, and when quite cold remove the bandage. O

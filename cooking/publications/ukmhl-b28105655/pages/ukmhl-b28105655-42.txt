Procure a nice breast of mutton; take off the shoulder-blade; take all the bones out; cut off any superfluous edges of fat, and, with a rolling-pin, flatten the mutton by beating it well. Now take a breakfast-cupful of bread-crumbs, a table-spoonful of finely-chopped parsley, a teaspoonful of chopped herbs (thyme and marjoram if to be had), pepper and salt enough to season the whole, and, after mixing all well, moisten it with a little milk. Spread the mixture on the mutton, and roll it tightly up, tying it with tape in at least three places.

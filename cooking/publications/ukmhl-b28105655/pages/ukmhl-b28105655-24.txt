HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 20 Trimmings of fish make this soup very well, or small fish of different kinds, such as children catch. A few oysters or other shell-fish may be added at the last, but must not boil; only thoroughly heat. Tomato is skinned easily if it be dipped in boiling water for one moment. This soup is delightful. Tomato Soup. Small table-spoonful Butter or Fat. ^ a tin Tomatoes, or 1 lb. Tomatoes. 2 Onions. 3 table-spoonfuls Tapioca. 2 quarts Stock. Pepper and Salt. Put into a flat stew-pan an ounce of butter, or some fat ham cut in small pieces (there should be a table- spoonful). When it is hot, put in 2 middle-sized onions sliced, and fry them; then add half a tin of tomatoes, or 1 lb. of fresh tomatoes, cut up roughly in pieces. Let this all stew for about 20 minutes, after which rub it through a sieve or cullender to keep back the seeds and to pulp the tomatoes and onions. Have 2 quarts of common stock made either with a small piece of mutton, veal, or beef; it need not be rich, as the very plainest is quite good for this soup. Add the pulp of the tomatoes, etc., to the stock, and set it on the fire to boil; then put in 3 table-spoonfuls of tapioca which has been soaked for an hour in either warm or cold water, and keep stirring till it boils. The soup will be ready after boiling for 10 minutes, and having pepper and salt added to it. N.B.â€”If fresh tomatoes are used, half a cupful of water may be put in along with them.

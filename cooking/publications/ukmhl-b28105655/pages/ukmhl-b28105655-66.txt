HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 62 Brussels Sprouts. 1 lb. Brussels Sprouts. I Pepper and Salt. 1 oz. Butter. Put the sprouts in plenty of cold water to wash them well. Take each sprout and trim the stalk, cutting off any withered leaves on the outside, and put them in a basin of clean cold water. Have plenty of boiling water (salted), and a small pinch of car- bonate of soda in it; drain the sprouts, and put them in the pot to boil, with the lid off, for about 10 minutes; drain them in a cullender, and return them to the pot with half an ounce of butter and a little pepper and salt. Shake them about in the pot gently to send the butter quite over them ; dish them neatly in a pile on a dish, and serve. Haricot Beans Boiled. \ lb. Beans. 1 dessert-spoonful of Dripping. \ oz. Butter. 1 table-spoonful of Chopped Parsley. Pepper and Salt. Soak the beans in cold water for 24 hours. Put them on to boil in 3 breakfast-cupfuls of cold water, with a dessert-spoonful of dripping in it, or a small piece of any fresh fat. Let them boil about an hour, till the beans are soft, but not broken. Drain them, and add the butter and parsley, pepper and salt, and shake them about in the pan till the butter and parsley are well mixed over them ; then serve. No salt must be used when boiling the beans, as it would make them hard and tough. Melted butter or tomato sauce may be poured over the beans, in which case they make an excellent substitute for meat.

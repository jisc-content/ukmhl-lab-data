LAUNDRY WORK. 135 The linings of body and sleeves of a dress ought to be ironed first, then sleeves and body, and finish with the skirt, which requires a skirt-board to do it well. The skirt-board is put between two tables, and the dress hung over it. To Wash Lace.—Lace requires great care and nicety in washing. In the first place, good lace should on no account be rubbed or even squeezed. It may be laid in a lather of melted soap and warm water, put near the fire^ and allowed to heat, by which means the dirt is extracted—the water being changed now and again ; or, it may be laid on a plate in which is a good deal of soapy water and placed in the sun. The sun extracts the dirt and bleaches the lace. When clean, rinse the same way without rubbing or squeezing. Then put into a little very thin starch, press between the folds of a towel, and proceed to iron. Place the lace on an ironing-table with the wrong side up; put a piece of muslin across it, and go over it once or twice with a cool iron. Then take off the muslin, and, beginning at the right hand side, pick out all the edges and slightly iron the lace. A hot iron will make it too stiff, and a heavy iron will flatten it too much. It ought to be lightly ironed, and the edges and other parts nicely picked out. If you pull it gently from side to side and slightly press it, you can make old lace look quite new again. Tatting may be easily dressed, but it must simply be left in water by the fire until it is clean, and never touched with the hand, or it will be impossible to pick out the loops. When rinsed and starched, fold it in a towel, and proceed to iron it like lace.

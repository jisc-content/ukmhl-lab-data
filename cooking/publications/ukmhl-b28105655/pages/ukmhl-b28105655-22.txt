HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 18 Salt and Pepper. 1 teacupful of whole Rice. Carrot Soup 6 Carrots, 1 Turnip. 2 Onions. Celery. Stock. This soup may be made of second stock, or of bones of roast beef or mutton. Put 2 quarts of stock in a stewpan, with 6 carrots, 1 small turnip, 2 onions; a blade of celery is an improvement. The carrots must either be grated or cut in very small pieces. Add a table-spoonful of flour, wet in a little water; allow the whole to boil for 2Â£ hours, until the carrots are tender; pass the soup through a wire sieve or cullender; rub the carrot through; return to the pot to warm, and add salt and pepper. If made with raw bones, the stock is much better boiled the day previous, as the fat can be taken off when the soup is cold. Put into a pot 2 quarts of liquor in which a fowl or a knuckle of veal has been boiled. It may be improved by having a carrot and small turnip boiled along with it, which can be picked out at the last. Now add to the soup the white part of the leeks cut up in very thin pieces, and the rice well washed, and boil for half-an-hour; then add a table-spoonful of parsley washed, dried, and chopped up very finely, a breakfast-cupful of good milk, and salt and pepper. After boiling for 5 minutes, the soup will be ready. Rice Soup. 2 quarts Stock. 4 large Leeks. Milk. Parsley.

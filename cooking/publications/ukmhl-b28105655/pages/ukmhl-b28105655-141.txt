Fill an ordinary boiler rather less than half-full— say about 2 gallons of water; put in a quarter of a pound of a yellow soap cut up into thin shavings, and 1 large table-spoonful of paraffin. Let them boil up. Then shake out the clothes and put them in dry, pushing them down with a stick. When as many are in as can conveniently be covered by the water, let all boil for half-an-hour, pressing the clothes at intervals down with the stick. Take them out into a tub with cold water; wash through this, then through another water; rinse, blue, and finish in the usual way. Put coarser articles into the boiler, to which add more soap and paraffin. The precautions necessary are, that the water in the boiler must be really boiling before the clothes go in; and it must be kept in ebullition, as paraffin is an oil and floats on the top, and will be apt to discolour the clothes. Also, care must be taken when putting it in, for if it gets into the fire it will blaze dangerously. Finally, plenty of water must be used to rinse, so that the smell be removed.

74 HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. Bread and Jam Pudding. Bread. ยง pint Milk. Jam. Sugar. 2 Eggs. Have a plain round tin or basin that will hold a pint and a half (three breakfast-cupfuls), and grease it well inside with sweet dripping or butter. Take some very thin slices of bread, and spread them with jam; then cut them up in slips about 1 inch wide and 3 long. Place them lightly in the mould, filling it very nearly full. Now beat up 2 eggs well, to which add a table-spoonful of sugar and the milk, and after mixing all well together, pour into the mould. Allow it to stand for half-an-hour to soak; then cover the mould with a greased paper and place it in a sauce-pan with boiling water (the water must reach only half-way up the mould); steam for an hour and turn out. The pudding must steam very slowly, or the eggs will curdle, which would spoil the pudding. Marmalade may be substituted instead of jam in this pudding, and the bread may be buttered before the jam is put on if a richer pudding is desired.

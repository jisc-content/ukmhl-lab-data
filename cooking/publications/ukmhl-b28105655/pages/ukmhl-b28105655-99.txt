CAKES AND BAKING. 95 CAKES AND BAKING. Oakes, buns, biscuits, etc., form pleasant adjuncts to the necessaries of the household, and are only of secondary importance to that of bread baking. They are well worthy of attention, as they can be easily and cheaply made at home. Solid cakes, such as seed, pound, and ginger cakes, require a rather hot oven. It is better to protect the cake with a good many folds of paper in the bottom of the pan and a paper cover on the top, than by putting the cake in a slow oven, to allow the fruit to sink to the bottom, and the cake to become heavy. Light sponge cakes, and all light cakes, must have a quiet oven, as well as all large cakes which contain much baking powder. The lighter the cake is, in general the quieter the oven should be. A very light cake put into a quick oven rises rapidly round the sides, but leaves a hollow in the middle. When baking powder is not to be had, a substitute can easily be made by putting in the required quantity of carbonate of soda and some acid to counteract it. Soda alone is never good in a cake where there is butter or dripping-, unless some substance containing acid is along with it. Treacle is one of those substances con- taining acid. The best carbonate of soda is a decided advantage over the common kind. The following tests for trying the temperature of the oven may be found useful:â€” 1. If a sheet of paper burns when thrown in, the oven is too hot.

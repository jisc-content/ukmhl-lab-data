SOUPS. 19 Stock from Bones. 6 lbs. Bones. 1 Turnip. 2 Onions. Peppercorns. 1 Carrot. Raw and cooked bones should not be boiled together. Take 6 lbs. of raw bones; remove as much marrow and fat from them as possible; put them in a pot and cover them well with cold water (see that the bones are all covered, as any portion remaining uncovered adds no strength to the soup); add 2 onions, 1 large carrot, 1 turnip, a teaspoonful of peppercorns, and boil 8 hours on a slow fire. Care must be taken that the water does not reduce too much; in that case it must be added to. The stock is best to simmer very slowly by the fire all day, and then be strained through a sieve. The next day the fat may be removed, and the stock is ready for use. Fishermanâ€™s Rice Soup. li lbs. of Fish. 1 Onion. Bit of Celery and Carrot. I lb. Rice. 2^ quarts of Water.

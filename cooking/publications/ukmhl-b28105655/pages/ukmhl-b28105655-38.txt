Flesh that is fried should not be over- cooked, as in that case it gets dry and indigestible. Pork takes a longer time, either to roast or fry, than other flesh; and it should always be well cooked, as when underdone it is very disagreeable and unwhole- some.

Wash the tail well in warm water, and cut it up at the joints ; the larger joints may be cut in two. Dry the pieces well, and mix on a plate a table-spoonful of flour, a teaspoonful of salt, and half a teaspoonful of pepper. Rub each piece of tail over with this mixture. Put into a stew-pan a table-spoonful of dripping, and let it get quite hot; then fry the pieces of tail all round in it, and lift them out when done. Pour out the fat that remains, and return the pieces of tail to the pan with the onion chopped up, 2 break- fast-cupfuls of water, and the ketchup, and stew gently for an hour-and-a-half.

All other articles with which cold-water starch is used must be done practically in the same way, and ironed before they can get dry.

Now iron the shoulder, taking care not to touch the breast or collar. Next iron the collar. Iron it well, and make it quite dry, now double the back from the button on the collar to the middle of the shirt; iron first one side, then the other; then spread out the shirt on the table, front jppermost, and iron all the unstarched parts.

It is best to iron from the front of the breast towards the sides, and the iron must be brought neatly round the edge at the collar; then iron the under side in the same way.

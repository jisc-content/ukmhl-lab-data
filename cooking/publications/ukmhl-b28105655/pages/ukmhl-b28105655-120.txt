116 HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. Toast and Water. Toast the quarter of a slice of bread till it is quite brown in every part without being in the least burned. Have a jug, with three breakfast-cupfuls of cold water in it, into which put the bread, and allow it to stand for a few hours. Hot water is frequently used instead of cold, but the water is scarcely so clear and nice. In this case it must cool before being used. The water is put in the jug first, and the bread put in, otherwise the bread gets crumbled. It is a most refreshing drink. Barley Water. 2 oz. Barley. I 1 dessert spoonful Sugar. ^ Lemon Rind. I 1 quart Water. Wash the barley well, and put it in a sauce-pan with a quart of cold water; add the rind of half a lemon, very thinly pared off, and boil for half-an-hour; after- wards add the sugar, and strain into a jug to cool. Clear Barley Water. 1 table-spoonful of Barley. i Small bit of Lemon Rind. 3 teacupfuis of Water. | 1 teaspoonful of Sugar. Wash the barley well, and put it in a jug with the lemon rind and sugar; pour over it 3 teacupfuls of boiling water; then cover the jug, and stand to get cold, when it may be poured off for use. The barley in those recipes can be used again, as it is said to be better the second than the first time.

HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 64 cases the potato is very watery, being unripe, and is best to have the skin scraped off and put in boiling water and boiled rapidly, as this draws out some of the water and makes the potato better food. In the second case, the potato acquires a bitter taste when it gets old, and is better pared and even soaked for a short time in cold water, before boiling in the usual way. Potatoes, however, should never be soaked longer than 1 or 2 hours, as one of the principal components of the potato is starch, and with soaking in water the starch gradually loosens, comes out into the water, and is lost, as may be seen in the white sediment that remains in the bottom of a basin in which the potatoes have been soaked. A few simple rules may be given now for the boiling of the potatoes :â€” 1. Select the potatoes all one size, or as nearly as possible. It is impossible to boil small and large potatoes properly together. 2. Barely cover the potatoes with water. 3. Add as much salt as tastes the water. 4. Bring them slowly to the boil. 5. Boil the potatoes slowly; the larger the potatoes are the slower they should be boiled, because the heat takes longer to penetrate to the heart. For very large potatoes a little cold water may be added once or twice, to prolong the boiling. 6. Drain them before the skin cracks in the least, but not quite dry. 7. Allow them to steam 5 or 10 minutes with the lid on, and a few minutes with it off. They may now be quickly peeled and dished up.

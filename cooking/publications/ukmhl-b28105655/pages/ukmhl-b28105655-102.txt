HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 98 Yeasts of all kinds require a warm temperature to encourage fermentation, or, in other words, to make them â€œ rise consequently, the secret of making bread light is to have everything connected with it warm during the process of baking. Bake in a warm place, set it to rise in a warm place, and from beginning to end of the process let the bread get no chill. Setting the bread to rise on a kitchen fender is not a good plan at all, as the fire always draws a current of air from the door or window, and consequently must chill the outside of the basin with the dough or the loaves when set to rise. The best way is to set them up near the fire and quite out of the draught. The tempera- ture of the oven for baking bread should be about 2b0- Buns with Yeast. 1 lb. Flour. 1 table-spoonful of Sugar. 1 cup of Milk. \ lb. Currants or Raisins. 1 pinch Salt. 2 Eggs. 1 dessert spoonful of Butter. 1 oz. German Yeast. Flavouring. Mix in a basin the flour, sugar, salt, and currants -. then warm the butter and milk a little, just lukewarm, and mix the yeast smoothly with it; also beat up the eti'cfs and mix them. Pour all into the flour, etc., in the basin, and mix with a spoon till the flour is all wet. More milk may be required, but the flour is to be just wet. When well mixed, set to rise near the fire for half-an-hour, as bread is raised. Then with well- floured hands make the dough up into buns either large or small as required, and place them on a buttered and floured oven tin, and set to rise again

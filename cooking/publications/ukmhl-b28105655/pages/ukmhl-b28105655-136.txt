132 HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. To Wash Flannel.â€”Prepare two tubs, into which put warm or tepid, but not hot, water. Add to this, in the first water, a large table-spoonful of melted soap and a dessert-spoonful of ammonia; but only add the ammonia when you are quite ready to begin to use the water. Into the second tub put less soap, and if the flannels are not dirty, do not add ammonia. Ammonia is an alkali which helps quickly to remove grease and dirt, and does not leave the flannel hard, as it evaporates. Having had your flannel well shaken out, put one article at a time into the first water, and wash it quickly. It must not be rubbed with soap or with the hand, but dumped up and down and moved about under the hands, as rubbing makes the fibres and wool of the flannel go into a hard thick mass and shrink. The only parts that should be rubbed are any cotton bands or button-holes; these may require to be rubbed with soap and with the hands also. When the first washing is finished, put the same garment into the second water, wash quickly, and wring out. A wringer is of great benefit to flannels, as twisting the flannel in the process of wringing has been found to make it shrink. A wringer is, there- fore, a valuable utensil in the laundry. If the flannel be clean and nice, shake out very well, fold and clap, and leave in the fold for 5, but not more than 10, minutes. If not quite clean, put through a third tepid water with scarcely any soap and no ammonia. Repeat this process, putting only one article into the water at a time. Flannels should be hung out in warm sunshine or, at least, on a bright day, and dried very quickly. If

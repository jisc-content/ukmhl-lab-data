HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 140 A good way to make this starch for ordinary purposes is to put 2 teacupfuls of water and 1 tea- spoonful of borax to each table-spoonful of starch. Mix all thoroughly and use. If too stiff for the purpose required, add a little more water to reduce it. The following will be found an excellent recipe for cold-water starch for collars, shirts, etc.:â€” 3 table-spoonfuls Starch. 1 large teacupful Cold Water. 1 teaspoonful B' rax. 1 teaspoonful Melted White Curd Soap. 1 dessert-spoonful Turpentine. Scrape down a little white curd soap, put it in a small, clean jar, and add as much water as will cover it. Put the jar near the fire, or in a sauce-pan with a little boiling water, and leave near the fire till the soap is melted. It may be kept in this jar, covered over, for future use. Now put the starch in a basin, add to it the cold water, and mix with a spoon till quite smooth. It requires to be well stirred, as not the smallest lump must remain. Then put into the teacup the borax and melted soap, and mix with them rather more than half-a-teacupful of boiling water; mix this thoroughly and add to the contents of the basin. Lastly add the turpentine, and mix. This starch is excellent, and just the proper stiffness for shirts, collars, and cuffs. Care must be taken, however, to measure the different ingredients very carefully, else it will not come right. Also remember that the article that is starched with this starch must be wet. If the article were dry, it would be much too stiff.

FISH. 29 white, or pull it off altogether. Put the fish on in a stew-pan, covered with cold water, to boil for three- quarters of an hour, or longer if very hard; take it up on a dish and drain the water entirely from it, wiping the dish quite dry. Boil the egg hard, i.e., for 10 minutes; take off the shell and chop it up. Take a small sauce-pan and put in it an ounce of butter and a dessert-spoonful of flour, stirring them together over the fire; then add a breakfast-cupful of milk, and stir till it boils; add the chopped-up egg, and mix. Pour the whole over the fish, and serve. Boil about 9 potatoes, and mash them quite smoothly, adding a very little milk to moisten them. Have the fish boiled (the remains of fish previously cooked will do). Put into a small pudding-dish 3 spoonfuls of the mashed potatoes, and spread it over the bottom of the dish; then put in the fish, broken up with a fork into flakes; over that sprinkle a table-spoonful of finely- chopped parsley, and a small cooked onion chopped up. Then add half a teaspoonful of mustard, made with vinegar instead of water, and a few small bits of dripping or butter, and cover all with the remainder of the mashed potatoes, making the top smooth, and marking it neatly. Put the pie into an oven for three- quarters of an hour, or on a toaster in front of the fire, to brown the potatoes nicely. Salt Fish Pie. Potatoes. Mustard. Vinegar. Pepper. Dripping. \ lb. Fish.

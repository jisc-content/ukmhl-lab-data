HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 26 A few minutes is enough to fry the fish if the fat quite covers them ; if it does not, turn them over and fry them on the other side. They ought to be of a nice brown colour; and if proper attention is paid to the heat of the fat, the fish will be perfectly whole. They are equally well fried without the egg and bread- crumbs, using only flour to dry them, but they do not look quite so well. A slice of a large fish, or fillets of fish, should all be fried in the same way. Melted butter may be served with them. Haddocks are the better of being skinned ; but the skin of whiting is very delicate, and does not require to be removed. Fish Pudding. 1 lb. Fish. 1 Egg. Potatoes. Pepper and Salt. 1 oz. Butter. Take any remains of boiled fish; carefully remove the flesh from the bones, and cut it up into small dice, and have equal bulk of mashed potatoes. Put both into a basin and mix them together with a fork, then melt the butter and pour it in, mixing well; add salt and pepper and a few grains of cayenne pepper; beat up an egg and add it last; mix all well together; put it in a pudding-dish, smooth and score it neatly at the top, and bake for half-an-hour. The same mixture is very good made into small round cakes. Flour them well outside. Put a table-spoonful of dripping in a frying pan to get quite hot; put in a few cakes at a time to fry a brown colour on both sides. Then drain and serve. They are a breakfast dish.

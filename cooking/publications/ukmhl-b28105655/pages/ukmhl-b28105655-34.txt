30 HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. Baked Herrings. 6 fresh Herrings. % teaspoonful Salt. £ teaspoonful Pepper. i teacupful Vinegar. 1 Bay Leaf. ^ teacupful Water. Fresh herrings should not be washed, unless in exceptional circumstances. They should be emptied, the heads taken off, the scales scraped off, and then the herrings well wiped. With a sharp knife split the herring up the back and lay it open; cut it in half; lift the bone out, beginning at the head; now roll each half up into a nice firm roll, beginning at the head ; from 6 herrings you will have 12 of these rolls. Stand them in a small pudding dish with the back uppermost—they will quite fill the dish. Now pour in half a teacupful of water and one-third of a teacupful of vinegar mixed, a bay leaf slipped in at the side, and the pepper and salt. Cover the dish over with a plate, and cook at the side of the fire, or in the oven, for half- an-hour. The herrings may be served in the dish in which they are cooked. They are good either hot or cold./ Prepare as above—namely, empty the herrings, take off the heads, scrape the scales off, and wipe them quite clean ; then split them open from the back and lay them Hat. Dust over them a little pepper and salt. Have a clean frying-pan quite hot; place the herrings in it, the skin next the pan, and fry them for 5 minutes ; then fry the other side about the same time. Fry the skin side first. Good herrings need no dripping, as they contain sufficient oil in themselves to fry in. Fried Fresh Herrings.

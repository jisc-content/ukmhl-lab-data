HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 104 Warm the butter sufficiently to melt it a little ; then beat up the eggs and mix them with the butter; afterwards add the milk. Now stir the milk, butter, and eggs among the mixture in the basin, and mix well. Have a cake-tin greased and covered with paper, into which pour the cake, and bake till ready, which will be -at least an hour. N.B.—The raisins should be stoned, the currants washed and dried, and the orange peel cut up in small pieces. This makes a nice dark cake, like a Christmas cake. M ix together in a basin the dour, sugar, butter or dripping, and add the currants, after being well washed in cold water and dried. The dripping must be crumbled down by rubbing it with the fingers. Beat up the egg, and mix the milk thoroughly with it. Now put into a dry basin the carbonate of soda and tartaric acid, and pour on this the milk and egg, stirring quickly till it effervesces, when at once pour the whole in among the ingredients in the basin, and mix well and very quickly. Have a cake-tin greased before you begin, and into it pour the cake at once; put it into a warm oven to bake for about an hour. Before beginning to make this cake, the oven should be heated and the cake-tin prepared. Sultana raisins may be substituted for the currants. Cun ant Cake. 1 lb. Flour. \ lb. Sugar. \ lb.

HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 46 3 Onions. Pepper and Salt. Scotch Collop. 1 lb. Steak. 1 oz. Butter or Dripping. 1 oz. Flour. Pepper and Salt. 3 Onions. Take a pound of shoulder-steak, cut very thinly; put in a stew-pan an ounce of butter or dripping, and let it get quite hot; then put in the steak cut in pieces about 3 inches square or so; let this fry well on both sides till*the outside is crisp; sprinkle in a table- spoonful of flour; stir it round till it has mixed well; then add the onions, either cut in rings or chopped up, some pepper and salt, three-quarters of a pint of water, and stir until it boils up ; after that let it simmer very slowly for an liour-and-a-half. This stew should be kept quite below boiling point until it is done, as boiling hardens the meat. Cut up the meat in rather small pieces, and put it in a stew-pan with a cupful of water, and allow it to stew for half-an-hour. Pare the potatoes and slice them about half an inch thick, and put them in a basin; pour over them plenty of boiling water, and cover them up. The same may be done to the onions if a strong taste is objected to, but for this dish the onions should only be chopped and added. Drain the potatoes when the meat has stewed for a quarter of an hour, and put them in the stew-pan on the top of the meat; add the onions, pepper and salt, a cupful of Irish Stew 1 lb. Mutton. 1| lbs. Potatoes.

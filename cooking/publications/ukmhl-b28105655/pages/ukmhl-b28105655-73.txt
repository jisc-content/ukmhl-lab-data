69 PUDDINGS. to be found in an egg. Eggs contain as much heat- giving and flesh-forming substance as an equal weight of butcher meat. Puddings composed principally of milk and eggs should be very gently cooked, as a very strong heat will cause them to curdle. Puddings with suet should be well cooked, as suet takes a long time to combine with the other materials of which puddings are composed. Rice makes excellent puddings, and although in itself not nitrogenous food, yet, combined with milk and eggs, is sufficiently nourishing, and very light. Rice is prin- cipally composed of starch, and is carbonaceous; on that account it is excellent for the young and old, who require food that is warming and easily digested. Macaroni is a composition of wheaten flour made into a kind of paste. There are many varieties of this, which go under the name of Italian Pastes. Macaroni is the cheapest and most useful article which can be used for puddings. It is nitrogenous, because it is made of wheat, and on that account is much more strengthening than rice. The nitrogenous principle in wheat is called gluten. Combined with cheese, macaroni is particularly good, and in that form is much used in foreign countries, and it is well worthy of being more extensively used in this country than it has formerly been. Semolina resembles ground rice in its grain, but is of a yellow colour, and is a portion of wheat which is not finely ground. It makes very good puddings, and can be used in any form in which rice is used, and is much more strengthening. Corn Flour is almost wholly starch, and on that ac- count is fattening and warming, but not strengthening.

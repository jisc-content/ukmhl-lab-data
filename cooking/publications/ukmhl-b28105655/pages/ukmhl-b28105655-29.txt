25 FISH. To Fry Fish, Etc. All fish are fried in a somewhat similar manner, and a few general directions may be given. Fish that are to be fried should be made perfectly dry, and, to accomplish this, must be covered either with flour or bread-crumbs. The fat should be perfectly hot, i.e., at the temperature of at least 345Â° Fahr. This is ascertained in several ways. The best is to use a thermometer; but as that is not always to be had, a very good way is to put the fat on the fire and allow it to get hot till it begins to smoke. It must be quite still, for as long as fat bubbles there is water in it. When the fat becomes quite still, and slightly smokes, put the fish in and fry till they become a light brown. Another good rule is to have plenty of fat to cover whatever you wish to fry. After the fish are fried, put them on a cloth or coarse paper before the fire to drain. Those rules of the heat of fat refer to all kinds of frying, fritters, etc. 3 Small Whitings or Haddocks. Bread-crumbs. Egg. Pepper and Salt. Lard or Dripping. Have nice fresh haddocks or whitings; wash and dry them well, and rub them with a little flour in which is mixed some pepper and salt; beat up an egg on a plate, cover the fish well with it, and roll them in dry bread-crumbs. Prepare the fat for frying as directed above, and put the fish in, not many at a time, as the temperature of the fat must not be reduced too much.

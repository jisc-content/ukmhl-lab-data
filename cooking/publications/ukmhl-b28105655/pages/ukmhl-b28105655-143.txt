LAUNDRY WORK. 139 Starching. There are two different ways of making starch, and it is just a question of convenience and suitability which would be used. One kind is called boiled starch, or boiling-water starch; the other cold-water starch. Now it is only when starch of any kind comes to boiling heat that it has any stiffening property whatever; therefore, in the one case the stiffening property is brought out by the boiling water, in the other case the stiffening property is only brought out by the heat of the iron. So it is plain that a good hot iron serves the purpose of cook- ing the starch, and so bringing out its stiffening properties. It will be quite plain that all articles that are heavy, or that are wanted to be very stiff, or where a very hot iron can be used, are better starched with cold- water starch. In the case of lace, or fine muslin, or sewed muslin, or any article that should be flexible and not very stiff, a hot iron would not do at all, and so the starch would not be cooked, but would have a floury appearance, because the starch granules would not be cooked. For much the same reason articles starched with cold-water starch must not be allowed to dry, as of course a hot iron could not cook or stiffen dry starch; it requires moisture as well as heat. Then fine, thin goods had better have hot-water starch, and firm goods, that require to be very stiff, cold water. Cold-water starch may be made any stiffness to suit the article.

A great deal more of a country’s prosperity depends upon comfortable homes than philosophers might be willing to acknowledge ; for people cannot prosecute business with great energy, or study with much enjoy- ment or profit, if there are worries at home, or muddle and discomfort there. This is quite apparent to all, and though it seems a matter of minor importance com- pared with the great interests and objects that have to be carried on out of doors, yet if the household machinery is out of order or not moving smoothly, the derangement may be carried forward till very important interests are disturbed. The home is the nursery of the present and future inhabitants of a country, and the care of the home devolves generally upon woman—in our country, at all events, it does so universally ; and by the manner in which she performs her most important duties, not only the present comfort, but, it may be, the future destinies of the inmates may be influenced, if not moulded. Incapacity on her part leads to many certain evils—disorder, waste, and muddle ; and may have still worse effects on the health and tempers of the family. Whatever other duties a woman may have, she must either manage her house herself, or devolve the care of it upon some other woman ; consequently all women should be carefully trained for this their occupation. Parents would never think of setting a young man up in business unless he had been trained, probably by8 INTRODUCTION. a long apprenticeship ; and yet it has been practically decided by many people that a young woman in- stinctively knows all about housekeeping; that she can cook without being taught, and can manage a house and instruct servants without ever having studied the subject of domestic management; that if she has received a liberal education and some know- ledge of needlework, everything else necessary to set her up as the mistress of a house comes naturally. Good mothers do and have always done great things in training their daughters, but many girls have not that advantage; and even mothers may see the neces- sity of their best instructions being supplemented. Happily most people are now alive to the necessity of training girls of all classes for their natural and certain occupation — the care of the home; and domestic economy and cookery, instead of being shunted aside and picked up by degrees how and where they can be, are now prominent branches of instruction, and few girls of any rank finish their education without these branches being studied. This little book proposes to be a practical guide to some departments of domestic management in a plain household,—namely, in Cookery, Laundry Work, and Household Management. Ignorance of these subjects has caused many a young housekeeper headaches and heartaches; and only after many trials and much waste has she succeeded in learning duties which a little early training would have made quite easy. Perhaps the most important result of this training is, that a knowledge of the constituents of different classes of food is acquired, and children may be fed with suitable food, which so greatly promotes health,INTRODUCTION. 9 and thus sent out to fight the world’s battles with the sound, healthy bodies which so greatly assist the sound mind; for improper or unsuitable food generally impairs health or saps its foundations; and want of health impairs very greatly the energy and usefulness, as well as the individual happiness. The recipes given have all been, repeatedly worked by the writer, and are perfectly reliable, and purposely made so plain that very young people can easily follow them. There are only a few specimens of the different classes of recipes given, because, with a little experi- ence and practice, they may be varied and altered to a great extent to suit the circumstances of the house- hold; they are moderately economical, and, if necessary, can be made more so. Three different constituents must enter into the daily food of all to supply the waste and the wants of the human body, and keep all the organs in good working order — Nitrogenous, Carbonaceous, and Mineral Foods. Nitrogenous food forms flesh and muscle and sup- plies strength ; carbonaceous food gives heat and acts as the fuel to the engine ; mineral food is necessary for the formation and repair of bone, and is an important constituent of the blood.

Milk.INTRODUCTION. 10 CARBONACEOUS OR BODY-WARMING FOODS. Animal. Vegetable. Rutter. Sugar. Treacle. Rice. All starchy foods. Suet. Oil. Fat. MINERAL FOODS. Green Vegetables. Wheat and Oatmeal. Water. Milk. Those three constituents, which ought to enter into the daily food of all, are to be found in plain ordinary materials, and, as will be seen by the foregoing table, in vegetable as well as in animal food. Animal food is by no means an absolute necessity, and may, with advantage to health in many cases, be entirely dispensed with. The nitrogenous principle in vegetable food is not so concentrated as in animal food, and consequently a larger bulk is required to procure the same amount of strength. Persons who have plenty of work or exercise in the open air can easily consume sufficient vegetable food for all purposes of life and health; whereas for persons who lead sedentary lives, a smaller bulk of more concentrated food will probably be found more beneficial. The combination of eggs, milk, butter, and cheese, with vegetables, makes a dietary that is quite sufficient for life and health ; and it is questionable whether it is not really the best sort of food for all.HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. SOUPS. Soup may be made of meat, vegetables, bones, milk, fish, etc., and is liquid food of a warming and very nourishing kind. Our bodies require a certain amount of liquid, and soup supplies that want in an excellent and healthful manner. Warm food is much more nourishing than cold. As the stomach requires quantity as well as quality to assist digestion, and as it can contain a great deal more than is necessary, it is desirable to decrease the appetite for solid food. The French use the liquid in which fish, vegetables, and meat of all kinds have been boiled to make light, nourishing soups. It is .advisable to make soup a daily article of food ; and for that purpose meat is not always necessary. Vegetables, beans, peas, lentils, tomatoes, etc., make excellent soups, in which the want of meat is difficult to discover. Warm light soup is excellent for invalids or persons afflicted with sleeplessness, as the warm liquid enters the blood quickly, and draws it away from the head in order to assist the stomach to perform its functions, thereby causing drowsiness. Beans, peas, and lentils are all nitrogenous vegetable foods; and, when used in the composition of soup, supply almost entirely the want of meat. Tomatoes are much used and highly prized, especially in soups; they are powerful purifiers of the blood and12 Salt and Pepper. HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. Dripping. highly nutritious. A celebrated medical man describes the tomato as “ an invaluable article of diet,” and ascribes to it various important medical properties. “ It is an almost sovereign remedy for dyspepsia and indigestion, and is the most healthy article of diet now in use.” Tinned tomatoes can be procured at a cheap rate, and very good ; they can be used where fresh tomatoes are not procurable. 2 Onions. Wash the beans, and soak them for a day and night in cold water. Put them into a pot with 2 quarts of water and a piece of fat pork, or a small table-spoonful of butter or dripping. Let it all boil ; then add the vegetables, cleaned and roughly cut up; a little car- bonate of soda, the size of a pea, may be added, as sometimes the beans are old and very hard. Let all boil for 2| hours, then put it through a strainer; it must be well mashed up, and use some of the milk to wash it through, as all ought to be put through, except the skins of the beans. Now add the milk; pepper and salt to taste. Warm all up in the pot, and serve. N.B.—No salt must be put in until the beans are quite boiled, as salt hardens them and renders them difficult to boil down. Half of a can of tomatoes boiled with the beans for the last half hour, and all rubbed through the Haricot Bean Soup. 1 lb.

SOUPS. strainer, makes a delightful change in this soup, and adds greatly to its valuable properties. The milk is left out when tomatoes are used. Beans have much the same component parts as cheese, and are almost as strengthening in every respect as beef. Their only want is fat, but the bacon or butter supplies that. quarts of Water. Put into a dry, clean pot a table-spoonful of sweet dripping, or fat of some kind ; let it get quite hot. Cut up the mutton into small square pieces; put it and the bones into the pot with the fat, and fry them, turning them over and over with a spoon. Cut up the carrot and turnip into small square pieces like the size of peas, and add them to the meat; then the leeks, washed and cut small; keep turning- all over with the spoon ; then add the rice, well washed, a teaspoonful of sugar, and a teaspoonful of salt. Let the whole be turned about in the pot with the spoon for more than 5 minutes; then add quarts of water. Put on the lid, bring it to the boil, and boil slowly rather over an hour. Add pepper and salt, and it is ready. N.B.—There are 4 breakfast-cupfuls in a quart. This is an excellent vegetable soup, and a very valuable article of food from the vegetables it contains. The fat supplies a want in the vegetables. This soup Cottage Soup. \ lb. Neck of Mutton. 1 teacupful of Rice. 1 Carrot. 2 large Leeks. 1 table-spoonful Dripping. 1 teaspoonful Sugar.14 HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. is extremely good made without any meat, and the small quantity of sugar counteracts any disagreeable effects leeks or onions may have on the stomach. Lentil Soup. 1 lb. Lentils. 2 Onions or Leeks. Carrot, Turnip, Parsnip. | Pepper and Salt. Take 1 lb. of lentils and wash them thoroughly in many waters until they are perfectly clean; soak them for a night in cold water; then put them into a pot with the water in which they are soaked and as much more as makes 2b quarts, or 10 breakfast- cupfuls. When this boils, add carrot, turnip, parsnip, 2 large onions, all cut up roughly, and a small pinch of carbonate of soda about the size of a pea. Allow it to boil 2 hours, then strain through a cullender, washing the lentils all through except the skins; return it to the pot to warm. Season with pepper and salt, and serve. Lentil soup is delightful if nicely made, and requires no meat of any kind, or bones, as it has the taste and the good properties of butcher meat to a large extent in itself. Windsor Milk Soup. 1 lb. Potatoes. I a Turnip \ a Parsnip. Salt and Pepper. 1 oz. Butter. Small bit of Celery (if possible). 2 large Leeks or Onions. 1 teaspoonful of Sugar, Flour, or Sago. Put into a pot the potatoes, turnip, parsnip, celery onions, or leeks, all cut up in small pieces; then add the sugar and butter; put it on the fire to get quiteSOUPS. 15 hot—add 2 quarts of water, and boil for an hour till all the vegetables are soft. Put through a strainer, using a spoon to press it through, and return it to the pot with a table-spoonful of Hour that has been moistened in a breakfast-cupful of milk, and boil for 5 minutes, stirring frequently till it boils. Two table-spoonfuls of sago may be used instead of the Hour; it should be washed and moistened in the same way as the hour, and stirred till it boils. Add salt and pepper to taste, and serve. German Soup. 1 lb. Neck of Mutton. 4 Potatoes 2 good-sized Onions. 1 large red Carrot. \ lb. Rice. Pepper and Salt Put the mutton, well washed, into a pot with 2| quarts of water ; when it boils, add the onions chopped up finely, the potatoes peeled and cut in very small pieces, and the carrot grated ; add a teaspoonful of salt, and let the whole boil 2 hours. Then wash a teacupfnl of rice (which is of a lb.) and add it, and allow the whole to boil half-an-hour longer. Season with enough pepper and salt, and the soup is ready. This is a delightful soup, and very cheap. Skirt Soup. H lbs Beef Skirt I l Turnip. 1 large Carrot. I Salt and Pepper. Kemove all the skin from the beef skirt and the fat; cut it up in pieces about half-an-inch square, and put the meat on in a pot with 2|- quarts of cold water.HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 16 Scrape and wash the carrot, peel the turnip, and cut both up in small square pieces about the size of peas; add them when the pot boils. Add also half a tea- spoonful of salt, and boil the whole for 2 hours. Season with pepper and salt to taste. This soup is delightful, and contains as much nourishment as good beef-tea. Beef skirt contains a considerable amount of good gravy, and is a part of the animal which lies just within the ribs. Green Pea Soup. 1 peck of Peas. Stock Parsley. Mint. Onion. Sugar. Pepper and Salt. Shell the pease, which should be J^oung; put the shells into a stewpan with a quart of water, a teaspoon- ful of salt, and 1 of sugar; boil for 1 hour, then pulp through a cullender or sieve; return to the pot, and add 1 quart of good stock, made with shin of beef; add 1 onion and a few leaves of lettuce, chopped very finely, a very little parsley, mint, and the pease; boil till the vegetables are tender (about 15 minutes); then season to taste, and serve. Mutton Broth. 1 lb. Neck of Mutton. \ lb. Barley. 1 large Carrot. 1 small Turnip. 1 small Cabbage or Savoy. 2 large Leeks. A little Parsley. 3| quarts Water. Salt and Pepper. Put the barley, mutton, and water into the pot; let them boil half-an-hour; then add the carrot, turnip17 SOUPS. cabbage, and leeks, cut up very finely, with 1 teaspoon- ful of salt. Let all boil for an hour-and-a-half; add the parsley chopped up finely, and enough salt and pepper to season; then serve. N.B.—Barley should be washed, and vegetables cut and left in water till they are required. To make the vegetables for this soup more delicate and digestible, cut them all up as indicated above, put them in a basin, and cover them with boiling water. When they stand thus for 10 minutes, the water may be drained, and the vegetables put into the pot and boiled as above. Potato Soup. 1 lb. Neck of Mutton. 1 Carrot. 2 lbs. Potatoes. Pepper and Salt. 3 Onions. This soup is excellent made with bones, either raw or cooked; with any inferior piece of beef or mutton; with liquor in which tripe has been boiled; or with part of a pluck. If made from raw bones, they must be boiled for several hours before the potatoes are put in. Take the mutton and put it in a pot with three quarts of cold water; bring to the boil; pare thinly and slice small 2 lbs. potatoes, and add them to the soup when it boils. Grate a nice red carrot, chop up the onions very finely, and add all to the soup, with a little pepper and salt. Boil 2 hours, season to taste, and serve. The potatoes should be boiled to a pulp, and the soup be nice and thick, not watery. BHOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 18 Salt and Pepper. 1 teacupful of whole Rice. Carrot Soup 6 Carrots, 1 Turnip. 2 Onions. Celery. Stock. This soup may be made of second stock, or of bones of roast beef or mutton. Put 2 quarts of stock in a stewpan, with 6 carrots, 1 small turnip, 2 onions; a blade of celery is an improvement. The carrots must either be grated or cut in very small pieces. Add a table-spoonful of flour, wet in a little water; allow the whole to boil for 2£ hours, until the carrots are tender; pass the soup through a wire sieve or cullender; rub the carrot through; return to the pot to warm, and add salt and pepper. If made with raw bones, the stock is much better boiled the day previous, as the fat can be taken off when the soup is cold. Put into a pot 2 quarts of liquor in which a fowl or a knuckle of veal has been boiled. It may be improved by having a carrot and small turnip boiled along with it, which can be picked out at the last. Now add to the soup the white part of the leeks cut up in very thin pieces, and the rice well washed, and boil for half-an-hour; then add a table-spoonful of parsley washed, dried, and chopped up very finely, a breakfast-cupful of good milk, and salt and pepper. After boiling for 5 minutes, the soup will be ready. Rice Soup. 2 quarts Stock. 4 large Leeks. Milk. Parsley.SOUPS. 19 Stock from Bones. 6 lbs. Bones. 1 Turnip. 2 Onions. Peppercorns. 1 Carrot. Raw and cooked bones should not be boiled together. Take 6 lbs. of raw bones; remove as much marrow and fat from them as possible; put them in a pot and cover them well with cold water (see that the bones are all covered, as any portion remaining uncovered adds no strength to the soup); add 2 onions, 1 large carrot, 1 turnip, a teaspoonful of peppercorns, and boil 8 hours on a slow fire. Care must be taken that the water does not reduce too much; in that case it must be added to. The stock is best to simmer very slowly by the fire all day, and then be strained through a sieve. The next day the fat may be removed, and the stock is ready for use. Fisherman’s Rice Soup. li lbs. of Fish. 1 Onion. Bit of Celery and Carrot. I lb. Rice. 2^ quarts of Water. Handful of Parsley. 2 Tomatoes or 1 cupful of Tinned Tomato. A blade of Mace. 6 Cloves. Put on the water in the soup-pot to boil ; have the fish cleansed thoroughly and cut up in pieces; put it in; add the onion, carrot, turnip, the mace and cloves, and the celery. Let all boil 1 hour and strain. Have the pot' washed out and put the stock back into it. Skin the tomatoes, and cut them up and add then? Wash the rice and add it, and let it all boil for 20 minutes longer. Add salt and pepper to season well.HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 20 Trimmings of fish make this soup very well, or small fish of different kinds, such as children catch. A few oysters or other shell-fish may be added at the last, but must not boil; only thoroughly heat. Tomato is skinned easily if it be dipped in boiling water for one moment. This soup is delightful. Tomato Soup. Small table-spoonful Butter or Fat. ^ a tin Tomatoes, or 1 lb. Tomatoes. 2 Onions. 3 table-spoonfuls Tapioca. 2 quarts Stock. Pepper and Salt. Put into a flat stew-pan an ounce of butter, or some fat ham cut in small pieces (there should be a table- spoonful). When it is hot, put in 2 middle-sized onions sliced, and fry them; then add half a tin of tomatoes, or 1 lb. of fresh tomatoes, cut up roughly in pieces. Let this all stew for about 20 minutes, after which rub it through a sieve or cullender to keep back the seeds and to pulp the tomatoes and onions. Have 2 quarts of common stock made either with a small piece of mutton, veal, or beef; it need not be rich, as the very plainest is quite good for this soup. Add the pulp of the tomatoes, etc., to the stock, and set it on the fire to boil; then put in 3 table-spoonfuls of tapioca which has been soaked for an hour in either warm or cold water, and keep stirring till it boils. The soup will be ready after boiling for 10 minutes, and having pepper and salt added to it. N.B.—If fresh tomatoes are used, half a cupful of water may be put in along with them.21 SOUPS. . Chicken Soup. 1 Fowl. 1 Onion. Small bit of Turnip. A dessert spoonful of Chopped Parsley. 2^ quarts of Water. Blade of Celery. Bit of Mace and 4 Cloves. 1 table-spoonful of Arrowroot. 1 teacupful of good Milk or Cream. Empty, cleanse, and truss the fowl; put the water in the soup-pot, and when it is hot put in the fowl. When it boils add the vegetables all cut up, and boil from 1| to 2 hours. Remove the fowl, and strain the stock through a very line strainer or napkin. Have the pot thoroughly washed, and return the stock to it. Then mix the arrowroot and the milk together, add salt and pepper, and put it all in the stock. Stir till it boils; then add the parsley, and boil for 1 or 2 minutes longer. If this soup is made with an old fowl, it may require to boil 2 hours; if a chicken, 1 hour or 1| hours will be sufficient. Serve the fowl with white sauce over it. Kidney Soup. 1 lb. Shin of Beef 1 Ox Kidney. 1 oz Butter. Flour. 1 Carrot, 1 Turnip. 2 Onions. 2 table-spoonfuls Corn-flour. Pepper, Salt, Mustard, Sugar. To make stock for kidney soup, take all the marrow from the shin of beef and put it into a soup-pot with 2 quarts of water. Bring it to the boil. Add the carrot, turnip, and onions, cut up into pieces, and allow all to boil at least 3 hours, when it mustHOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 22 be strained. Take a fresh ox kidney, wash it well, and dry it. Remove all the fat from the middle, and cut up the kidney into half-inch pieces. Put the butter in a stew-pan and let it get quite brown, but not burnt; then put in the pieces of kidney and fry them all round. When quite fried, stir in a table-spoonful of flour and mix it well till the Hour has absorbed all the moisture in the pan, then add a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful each of pepper, dry mustard, and sugar, stirring all till they become a paste in the pan. Now add 2 breakfast- cupfuls of water, and stir over the fire till it boils. Set it on a slow part of the fire, and allow it all to boil for at least 2 hours, stirring frequently, Return the strained stock to the pot, and add the kidney to it. Mix in a basin the corn-flour and a little water, and pour this also into the pot with enough of salt to season the whole, stirring occasionally till it boils, when the soup is ready. This soup, if well made, requires no artificial brown- ing ; it may be made still browner by leaving the skins on the onions, which must be well washed. Put the knuckle of veal on to boil with 2 quarts of cold water, allowing it to boil an hour. Peel and cut up the onions, and soak them for an hour in cold Onion Soup.

Let all boil 2 hours and strain, rubbing the onions through the strainer; then return the soup to the pot, and add a small table-spoonful of butter and 2 table-spoon- fuls of Hour mixed together, -and a breakfast-cupful of milk—stirring it till it boils. Allow it to boil 5 minutes, when the soup is ready; after which season to taste. This soup is made frequently without meat, leaving out the veal, and making it in every other respect the same. Hotch-Potch. 3 lbs. Neck of Mutton or Lamb. 6 young Turnips. 6 young Carrots. 6 young Onions. 2£ quarts of Water. 1 Lettuce. 1 Cauliflower. 2 pints of Green Peas. 1 handful of Parsley. Salt. Put rather more than half of the mutton or lamb in the soup-pot, with the water and a little salt; when it boils, skim it carefully, and allow it to boil for an hour. Cut up the remainder of the mutton or lamb into small chops and add them; also the turnips and carrots; cut up in neat square pieces the onions and half of the peas, and allow it to boil for half-an- hour longer. Chop up the lettuce, divide the cauli- dower into sprigs, chop the parsley finely, and add all to the soup, with the remainder of the peas, and boil for another half hour, when season to taste and serve.HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 24 FI SH. The varieties of fish available for food in this country are numerous and excellent; those containing the least fat are the most easily digested. The flesh of fish contains fibrine, gelatine, and albumen in small proportions, mineral matter and water in larger. Whiting,' haddock, and soles are nearly equally digestible, and even suitable for the food of invalids. Salmon, mackerel, and herring are more oily, and not quite so digestible. The common herring con- tains a large amount of nourishment, and if cooked so as to get rid of some of its superabundant oil, contains a large amount of nourishment at a cheap rate. Lobsters and crabs are not easily digested, and to some people are injurious. They are rather coarse feeders, and this may, to some extent, account for their indigestibility. All fish out of season are unwholesome, and sometimes positively injurious. Buckland, who has given so much information on the nature and habits of fish, writes very emphati- cally against the taking and using of fish out of season. It is said that fish are fully as nutritious as animal food ; and though they may not have such a satisfying effect upon the stomach, that arises from their being so easily digested. They are not only good food, but food of the best description, well able to supply the wants of the body, suitable for young and old, healthy people and invalids.25 FISH. To Fry Fish, Etc. All fish are fried in a somewhat similar manner, and a few general directions may be given. Fish that are to be fried should be made perfectly dry, and, to accomplish this, must be covered either with flour or bread-crumbs. The fat should be perfectly hot, i.e., at the temperature of at least 345° Fahr. This is ascertained in several ways. The best is to use a thermometer; but as that is not always to be had, a very good way is to put the fat on the fire and allow it to get hot till it begins to smoke. It must be quite still, for as long as fat bubbles there is water in it. When the fat becomes quite still, and slightly smokes, put the fish in and fry till they become a light brown. Another good rule is to have plenty of fat to cover whatever you wish to fry. After the fish are fried, put them on a cloth or coarse paper before the fire to drain. Those rules of the heat of fat refer to all kinds of frying, fritters, etc. 3 Small Whitings or Haddocks. Bread-crumbs. Egg. Pepper and Salt. Lard or Dripping. Have nice fresh haddocks or whitings; wash and dry them well, and rub them with a little flour in which is mixed some pepper and salt; beat up an egg on a plate, cover the fish well with it, and roll them in dry bread-crumbs. Prepare the fat for frying as directed above, and put the fish in, not many at a time, as the temperature of the fat must not be reduced too much.HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 26 A few minutes is enough to fry the fish if the fat quite covers them ; if it does not, turn them over and fry them on the other side. They ought to be of a nice brown colour; and if proper attention is paid to the heat of the fat, the fish will be perfectly whole. They are equally well fried without the egg and bread- crumbs, using only flour to dry them, but they do not look quite so well. A slice of a large fish, or fillets of fish, should all be fried in the same way. Melted butter may be served with them. Haddocks are the better of being skinned ; but the skin of whiting is very delicate, and does not require to be removed. Fish Pudding. 1 lb. Fish. 1 Egg. Potatoes. Pepper and Salt. 1 oz. Butter. Take any remains of boiled fish; carefully remove the flesh from the bones, and cut it up into small dice, and have equal bulk of mashed potatoes. Put both into a basin and mix them together with a fork, then melt the butter and pour it in, mixing well; add salt and pepper and a few grains of cayenne pepper; beat up an egg and add it last; mix all well together; put it in a pudding-dish, smooth and score it neatly at the top, and bake for half-an-hour. The same mixture is very good made into small round cakes. Flour them well outside. Put a table-spoonful of dripping in a frying pan to get quite hot; put in a few cakes at a time to fry a brown colour on both sides. Then drain and serve. They are a breakfast dish.27 FISH, Boiled Haddock or Cod. 3 lbs. Cod. Salt. Procure a piece of cod weighing 3 lbs., or a haddock of similar weight; scrape very clean, and, if quite fresh, an hour or two in salt is an improvement. Have a fish- kettle containing plenty of boiling water, well flavoured with salt; put the fish in and boil for a minute, then pour in a cupful of cold water, gently, to reduce the heat, and allow the fish to cook in the water, below boiling heat, for about 15 or 20 minutes, according to the thickness of the fish; it must be immediately taken out and drained, as to allow fish to remain in water after it is boiled spoils it; dish it on napkin with some parsley to garnish, and serve with melted butter in a sauceboat, separately. Procure a fine fresh haddock of 2 lbs. weight; wash and scrape it quite clean; take out the eyes and dry it outside and inside,then prepare the following stuffing:— A teacupful of bread-crumbs, \ oz. of suet or butter, a dessert-spoonful of chopped parsley, a teaspoonful of chopped herbs, pepper and salt; either an egg or a little milk moistens this. Form the stuffing like a O sausage, place it in the belly of the fish, and sew it up ; truss the haddock into the form of the letter S, brush the top over with a little beaten egg, sprinkle bread- Baked Haddock. 1 Haddock.

It must be frequently basted with fresh dripping while baking. Serve with melted butter. To Stew Fish. lbs. Fish. 1 Onion. Vinegar. Flour. 1 oz. Butter or Dripping. Pepper and Salt. Any of the coarser kinds of fish do well to stew ; and the different varieties of fish stews have always been favourite dishes where fish are easily procured. Cut up the fish into pieces about 2 inches long, after being well washed and cleaned. Put the dripping or butter into a small stew-pan, and let it get quite hot; chop up the onion and fry it brown in the hot fat; sprinkle a dessert-spoonful of flour into the pan, and stir it smooth; then add a teaspoonful of vinegar, salt and pepper to taste, and a breakfast-cupful of water. Stir till it boils ; then put in the pieces of fish, put on the lid, and let them simmer very gently for 10 minutes. Skate (which stews very well) takes 20 minutes, or even longer; but, in general, 10 minutes is quite enough time. Serve with the sauce over the fish. Salt Fish, to Cook. 1 lb. Salt Ling or Cod. 1 oz. Butter. Flour. Milk. 1 Egg. Salted fish are neither so nutritious nor so profitable as fresh fish; because salt extracts the juices from the fish, and greatly wastes its nourishing properties. Cut up the fish into convenient pieces and soak it all night in cold water. Either scrape the skin till it isFISH. 29 white, or pull it off altogether. Put the fish on in a stew-pan, covered with cold water, to boil for three- quarters of an hour, or longer if very hard; take it up on a dish and drain the water entirely from it, wiping the dish quite dry. Boil the egg hard, i.e., for 10 minutes; take off the shell and chop it up. Take a small sauce-pan and put in it an ounce of butter and a dessert-spoonful of flour, stirring them together over the fire; then add a breakfast-cupful of milk, and stir till it boils; add the chopped-up egg, and mix. Pour the whole over the fish, and serve. Boil about 9 potatoes, and mash them quite smoothly, adding a very little milk to moisten them. Have the fish boiled (the remains of fish previously cooked will do). Put into a small pudding-dish 3 spoonfuls of the mashed potatoes, and spread it over the bottom of the dish; then put in the fish, broken up with a fork into flakes; over that sprinkle a table-spoonful of finely- chopped parsley, and a small cooked onion chopped up. Then add half a teaspoonful of mustard, made with vinegar instead of water, and a few small bits of dripping or butter, and cover all with the remainder of the mashed potatoes, making the top smooth, and marking it neatly. Put the pie into an oven for three- quarters of an hour, or on a toaster in front of the fire, to brown the potatoes nicely. Salt Fish Pie. Potatoes. Mustard. Vinegar. Pepper. Dripping. \ lb. Fish.

Fresh herrings should not be washed, unless in exceptional circumstances. They should be emptied, the heads taken off, the scales scraped off, and then the herrings well wiped. With a sharp knife split the herring up the back and lay it open; cut it in half; lift the bone out, beginning at the head; now roll each half up into a nice firm roll, beginning at the head ; from 6 herrings you will have 12 of these rolls. Stand them in a small pudding dish with the back uppermost—they will quite fill the dish. Now pour in half a teacupful of water and one-third of a teacupful of vinegar mixed, a bay leaf slipped in at the side, and the pepper and salt. Cover the dish over with a plate, and cook at the side of the fire, or in the oven, for half- an-hour. The herrings may be served in the dish in which they are cooked. They are good either hot or cold./ Prepare as above—namely, empty the herrings, take off the heads, scrape the scales off, and wipe them quite clean ; then split them open from the back and lay them Hat. Dust over them a little pepper and salt. Have a clean frying-pan quite hot; place the herrings in it, the skin next the pan, and fry them for 5 minutes ; then fry the other side about the same time. Fry the skin side first. Good herrings need no dripping, as they contain sufficient oil in themselves to fry in. Fried Fresh Herrings.31 FTSH. Salmon, to Boil. Empty the salmon and wash it, but handle the fish as little as possible, to prevent the scales from being- rubbed off. Put into a fish-kettle enough water to cover the fish, with salt in the proportion of a table- spoonful to each gallon of water. When it boils, put the fish in, and let it boil for 5 minutes; then put 2 breakfast-cupfuls of cold water in to reduce the temperature, and put the kettle on a cooler part of the fire; allow it to remain thus under boiling point for the proper time; then take the fish-kettle off the fire and allow it to stand for 10 minutes before removing the salmon. This improves the flavour and makes the fish firmer. Table of Time to Boil Salmon. A slice weighing 1 lb. requires a quarter of an hour. „ 3 lbs. „ 25 minutes. G lbs. from a thick fish „ 40 minutes.

For the cooking of all meat which is not to be made into soup, but either stewed, roasted, or broiled, one rule, without exception, applies—namely, that the out- side of the meat be quickly subjected to strong heat; in order to shut up all the pores, after which a slower process of cooking should be proceeded with, such as suits each particular kind of meat. To stew meat is the most profitable of those three methods of cooking, as no part of the meat is lost, and there is, besides, a good gravy which supplements it. The principle of all stewing, whether applied to beef, mutton, chicken, or game, is, first of all, to put into a pot some kind of fat (either butter, suet, or dripping) and make it quite hot; then put i% the piece of meat, small or large, and fry it all round to shut the pores; then put in less or more water or other liquid, and stew the meat for the given time. This rule applies alike to small pieces of steak or large joints. The reason is, that the heat hardens the albumen in the meat all over the surface, and stops up the pores like sealing-wax on bottles; the juice is thus kept in, so that the meat cooked is much more savoury. Roasting is a more wasteful way of cooking; but roasted meat, if well cooked, is more easily digested. A roast should be put very near a hot fire for 5 minutes to shut up the pores, and after wards putSTEWING AND ROASTING OF MEAT. 33 a good deal further back, and cooked more slowly. The secret of having meat well roasted is to have an even heat, and to baste it very frequently. Basting keeps the meat from drying up, and the action of the fire on the hot fat with which it is basted keeps the surface of the meat well crusted over, and all the juice retained in the joint. Broiling or grilling is really just roasting a small slice of meat instead of a large piece. It certainly is not a very economical mode of cooking, but, if well done and not over-cooked, is very easily digested and nourishing. The principle is exactly the same as roasting:—Let the meat be put on a hot gridiron over a clear hot fire for a minute or two to shut up the pores, turning both sides to the fire; afterwards a little slower, to cook it to the heart. Eight or ten minutes is enough to grill steak nearly an inch thick; of course a little depends upon the fire, but no grilling is well executed unless the fire is clear and quite free from smoke. Both roasted and broiled meat are spoiled if over-done. Broiled meat should be turned very often, and thus bastes itself, just as roasted meat requires to be basted. Frying and frying-pans have been very much abused of late years; and one hears of “dirty frying- pans and greasy messes,” but there is no need for the frying-pan to be dirty, or the food greasy, and for certain kinds of flesh and fish frying is a very good mode of cooking. Almost without exception, the rule above applied to roasting or stewing applies to frying. The meat to be fried should be put either on a hot pan to shut up the pores, or in hot fat for the same purpose. This has always the effect of retaining the juices in c34 HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. the meat, and consequently making it more tender. The more the juices belonging to fish, flesh, or fowl are bottled up, the more tender and digestible the meat will be. Flesh that is fried should not be over- cooked, as in that case it gets dry and indigestible. Pork takes a longer time, either to roast or fry, than other flesh; and it should always be well cooked, as when underdone it is very disagreeable and unwhole- some. White flesh of all kinds, either of animals or fowls, takes a longer time than brown, and requires to be more thoroughly cooked. Wash the tail well in warm water, and cut it up at the joints ; the larger joints may be cut in two. Dry the pieces well, and mix on a plate a table-spoonful of flour, a teaspoonful of salt, and half a teaspoonful of pepper. Rub each piece of tail over with this mixture. Put into a stew-pan a table-spoonful of dripping, and let it get quite hot; then fry the pieces of tail all round in it, and lift them out when done. Pour out the fat that remains, and return the pieces of tail to the pan with the onion chopped up, 2 break- fast-cupfuls of water, and the ketchup, and stew gently for an hour-and-a-half. Cut the carrot and turnip into very neat pieces, add them, and stew three- quarters of an hour longer. Ox-tail Stewed 1 Ox-tail. Flour. 1 Onion. Carrot and Turnip. Pepper and Salt. Ketchup.

Dish the meat in the centre of a dish with the vegetables round it. Take the fat from the gravy and strain it over all. Rabbit Stewed. 1 Rabbit. 1 Onion. Flour. Pepper and Salt. Butter or Dripping. Wash the rabbit well and dry it thoroughly outside and inside; then cut it up into joints, after taking off the head and removing the heart and liver. In order to dry it still better, rub over each piece with flour. Put into a stew-pan a dessert-spoonful of butter or dripping; let it get quite hot; then put in the pieces of rabbit and fry them. When all are fried, add a breakfast-cupful of water, an onion finely chopped up, and the heart and liver. Take out the eyes, and wash the head well; add it also, and stew the whole slowly with the lid closely on for an hour, stirring it occasionally. Dish neatly, and pour the sauce over. Ox Kidney Stewed. 1 Ox Kidney. 1 table-spoonful Flour. Mustard. Sugar. Butter. Ketchup. 1 Onion. Pepper and Salt. Wash an ox kidney well and dry it thoroughly; then cut it up into thin slices, after all the fat has been removed from the middle. Put into a smallHOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 36 stew-pan a dessert-spoonful of butter; let it get quite hot and quite brown; chop up the onion and fry it slightly ; then put in the pieces of kidney and fry them well. Sprinkle in gradually the hour, and stir till it is quite mixed with the moisture in the pan. Add, now, a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful each of pepper, dry mustard, and sugar; a table-spoonful of ketchup may be added. Stir all well over the fire till it be quite dry, like a paste. Now add a breakfast- cupful and a half of water, and stir till it boils up; put on the lid, and allow it to stew very gently for an hour-and-a-half. Serve with nicely-shaped pieces of toasted bread round. The kidney majr be cut up in only 6 or 8 thick pieces or left whole. In those cases it must cook longer. Steak Stuffed and Rolled. 1 lb. Steak. 2 breakfast-cupfuls of Grated Bread. 2 table-spoonfuls Suet, chopped. 1 Egg. 1 table-spoonful Parsley, chopped. 1 teaspoonful Salt. ^ teaspoonful Pepper. Dripping. Carrot and Onions. Get 2 thin slices of steak, cut from the top of the rump, weighing half a pound each, and about a quarter of an inch in thickness. Put the grated bread, the suet, the parsley, pepper, and salt into a bowl, and mix them well. Beat up the egg well, and stir it in among the bread-crumbs, etc., in the basin; with the hand knead it to wet the whole mixture, and gather it into a lump ; but if the egg is not enough to moisten the mixture, add a very little milk or water. DivideSTEWING AND ROASTING OF MEAT, 37 the stuffing into 2 pieces, and shape them like a turkey’s egg; roll this neatly into each piece of steak, and tie it up with string. Each piece should be very neatly shaped. Put into a stew-pan a dessert-spoonful of nice drip- ping, and when it has got quite hot, fry the pieces of meat in it. Pour otf any dripping that remains, and put into the pan a cupful and a half of water, and allow it to stew for a quarter of an hour; then add 2 onions, and a pretty large carrot cut in quarters lengthways, and a little salt, and stew for an hour. Take otf the string from the steak, and place it on a dish; arrange the vegetables neatly round, and strain the sauce over. Dutch Stew. li lbs.

Put the lid instantly and closely on the pot, and let it stew slowly for three- quarters of an hour. Take a nice, firm cabbage, wash it, remove the withered leaves, and cut it into 8 pieces length- ways, like the divisions of an orange; place the cabbage in water; peel 6 potatoes and cut them in slices half an inch thick, and place them also in the water.

It must be cooked slowly, else it will burn. The whole is cooked by steam, and is a most delicious as well as profitable dish. Procure a nice breast of mutton; take off the shoulder-blade; take all the bones out; cut off any superfluous edges of fat, and, with a rolling-pin, flatten the mutton by beating it well. Now take a breakfast-cupful of bread-crumbs, a table-spoonful of finely-chopped parsley, a teaspoonful of chopped herbs (thyme and marjoram if to be had), pepper and salt enough to season the whole, and, after mixing all well, moisten it with a little milk. Spread the mixture on the mutton, and roll it tightly up, tying it with tape in at least three places. Place it then in a dish, and put it in the oven for a quarter of an hour to draw out a good deal of fat from it. Put two table- spoonfuls of this fat into a stew-pan and let it get hot; slice the onions and fry them till pretty brown in the fat; then add the mutton. Put into a basin a table- spoonful of flour, a little pepper and salt; rub the flour smooth with a very little water, and then add two breakfast-cupfuls of water, and mix. Now pour Mutton Stuffed and Rolled. 4 lbs. Mutton. 2 Onions. Parsley.

Then take up the mutton and put it on a dish, after cutting off the tape. Remove as much fat as possible from the top of the sauce, and pour it over the mutton. See that the sauce is not too thick. Breast of Veal Stuffed and Rolled, Breast of Veal. 1 Egg. £ lb. Bacon Ham. Pepper and Salt. Breakfast-cupful Grated Bread. Take a fore-quarter of half-fed veal, or the thin part of the breast of fed veal, weighing about 5 or 6 lbs. Remove all the bones, taking care not to break the outside skin. Take off all the rough or uneven pieces of the veal in the inside, and mince them up as finely as possible; mince also the ham finely—it should not be too fat. Put the chopped meat, ham, grated bread, half a teaspoonful each of pepper and salt in a basin, and, with the hand, mix them thoroughly together; beat up an egg well, add it, and mix well. Lay the veal out on a table with the skin next the table ; spread the stuffing neatly over the surface of the meat, leaving an inch bare all round; then roll it up tightly, and either sew it up or tie it in several places with broad tape. Put a teaspoonful of butter into a stew-pan large enough to hold it, and when hot put in the roll of veal and fry it all round; add an onion chopped up; then put in a breakfast-cupful of water and stew gently for 2 hours. Take it up and untie the fastenings.

The veal may be put into a roasting pan with a breakfast-cupful of boiling water, covered with another pan or dish, and put into the oven for an hour-and-a- half. It is very nice done thus. The gravy must be thickened and poured over. It is good either hot or cold. Cut the mutton into neat pieces the thickness of chops, and about 2 inches square, as near as may be. Put into a stew-pan a table-spoonful of good dripping, and let it get quite hot—which is when it begins to smoke. Slice the largest onion and fry it in the hot dripping till very brown; then lay in the mutton and fry all the pieces well, lifting them out as they are done. When all are fried, pour the dripping out of the pan, leaving the onions in the bottom. Now mix in a small basin a table-spoonful of flour, a teaspoonful of salt, and a little pepper, with 1| breakfast-cupfuls of water; stir all well and pour it into the pan, and keep To Bake the Roll Haricot Mutton 1 lb.

Strain it into a bowl to keep back the fried onions, and make it smooth. Return it to the pan and lay the chops into it; put on the lid and stew gently for half-an-hour. Peel the 6 small onions, and cut up the carrot and turnip into very neatly-shaped pieces, and put them in the pan; allow the whole to stew 20 minutes longer without stirring it, as the vegetables must not be broken. Dish the meat neatly with the vegetables round, and nour the sauce over all. i. Boiled Meat Pudding. I lb. Lean Beef. 1 Mutton Kidney. 4 lb. Flour. \ teaspoonful Baking Powder, 4 lb. Suet. Pepper and Salt. Put the flour into a basin; add to it a pinch of salt and the baking powder; then chop the suet very finely and mix it in, rubbing it into the flour with the fingers. Add as much cold water as will wet it, and make it up into a stiff piece of paste ; then flour the table, and roll it out into a round piece scarcely half an inch thick. Take a pudding bowl that holds a pint, rub it inside with clean dripping, line it neatly with the paste, which then cut even round the edges. Mix together on a plate a table-spoonful of flour, a teaspoonful of salt, and half a teaspoonful of pepper for seasoning. Cut the meat in thin slices, dip them in the seasoning, and place them lightly in the basin; split the kidney, skin, and cut it in thin slices ; dip them also in the seasoning, and put them into the bowl, and pourHOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 42 in a teacupful of water for gravy. Wet the edges of the paste on the bowl; roll out the scraps that remain large enough to cover the dish ; place it on, press down at the edges, and sprinkle a little Hour over the top. Now dip a pudding-cloth in boiling water, tie it tightly over the top, and plunge the pudding in plenty of boiling water; then boil it for 2| hours. Remove the cloth, and turn the pudding out on a dish. Liver and bacon mixed, or mutton, make a good pudding of this kind. Steak Stewed. 1 lb. Steak. 1 Carrot. 1 small Turnip. Flour, 1 Onion. Butter. Pepper and Salt. Have the steak tender, and cut it about three-quarters of an inch thick; put into a small-sized stew-pan an ounce of butter or dripping—the butter, however, is preferable—and let it become quite hot; cut the onion in rings, and fry it in the butter till it becomes very brown; also scrape and cut up the carrot and fry it as well. This frying of the vegetables brown colours the gravy nicely. When quite brown, lift the vegetables out on a plate, and put the steak in to fry on both sides; it should be fried crisp, so as to shut up the pores of the meat and keep the juice in. If any butter remains in the pan, it should be poured out. The vegetables are then returned to the pan, and the meat placed on the top of them; cut up the turnip in smallish pieces, and add it; a leaf of celery is a great43 STEWING AND ROASTING OF MEAT. improvement. Now put into a basin a small table- spoonful of Hour with salt and pepper to taste, and rub it smooth with a little cold water; when quite smooth, add a breakfast-cupful and a half of cold water, and stir; now pour this into the stew-pan, and put it on the tire to come to boiling point; after that it must be allowed to simmer very slowly for an hour-and-a-half. Serve the steak on a hot dish, and strain the sauce over it, as by this time all the substance has been extracted from the vegetables. Beef Steak Pie. lbs. of Steak. 2 Mutton Kidneys.

Roll up the seasoned pieces of steak, and lay them in a pie-dish ; put a layer of meat in the bottom of the dish; skin the mutton kidneys, or half an ox kidney, and cut them up in thin slices, leaving out the fat in the middle of the kidney; dip them also in the seasoning; repeat till the meat is used up and the dish is full ; pile it high in the middle, put in some water in the dish for gravy, and then make the crust as follows:— Beat up an egg on a plate; put on a board half a pound of flour, quarter pound of butter, half a tea- spoonful baking-powder; mix the baking-powder with the flour; chop the butter into pieces the size of a nut among the flour ; now pour about a gill of water in theHOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 44 middle of the Hour, and the half of the egg; with these make it up into a stiff paste, which roll out length- ways, keeping the edges as straight as possible and about a quarter of an inch thick; fold this piece in three, turn it round, and roll lengthways again; fold in three, turn it round, and roll once more. This time it may be rolled rather larger than the size required for the dish. Wet the edge of the dish, and put a narrow band of paste round; wet the band, place on it the remainder of the paste, which cut to the size of the dish, then notch the edges very neatly, and brush over with the half egg you have left. Make a large hole in the top, and into this put the ends of some leaf-shaped pieces of paste, with an ornament in the centre; egg the leaves, and bake. After the crust begins to brown, cover it with a buttered paper, and bake for 1| hours. Steak and Onions Fried. 1 lb. Steak. Ketchup. Flour.

The flour and the ketchup may be omitted. Hough of Beef Stewed, Hough of Beef Turnip. Carrot. Onions. Have a nice piece of the thick part of the hough, about 4 or 5 lbs.; take all the marrow from the bone, cut it in little bits, and put in a stew-pan on the fire. After the marrow has become quite hot, put in the piece of meat and fry it brown all round, par- ticularly at the ends, to shut up the pores of the meat; when quite well fried, pour off any remains of fat in the pot, and add a pint of water; put the lid closely on, and allow it to stew very slowly for an hour; now add a carrot cut in quarters, a turnip neatly cut, and 2 onions halved. Allow all to stew for an-hour-and-a- half longer. Slow stewing makes the muscles of the shin to swell and become very tender; but if cooked too fast, this piece of meat is spoiled. This is a profit- able as well as a very nice dish, if stewed for 2£ or 3 hours. Put the meat on a dish with the vegetables round, and the gravy poured over. N.B.—Care must be taken that the gravy does not dry up too much, and that the stewing is extremely slow.HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 46 3 Onions. Pepper and Salt. Scotch Collop. 1 lb. Steak. 1 oz.

Take a pound of shoulder-steak, cut very thinly; put in a stew-pan an ounce of butter or dripping, and let it get quite hot; then put in the steak cut in pieces about 3 inches square or so; let this fry well on both sides till*the outside is crisp; sprinkle in a table- spoonful of flour; stir it round till it has mixed well; then add the onions, either cut in rings or chopped up, some pepper and salt, three-quarters of a pint of water, and stir until it boils up ; after that let it simmer very slowly for an liour-and-a-half. This stew should be kept quite below boiling point until it is done, as boiling hardens the meat. Cut up the meat in rather small pieces, and put it in a stew-pan with a cupful of water, and allow it to stew for half-an-hour. Pare the potatoes and slice them about half an inch thick, and put them in a basin; pour over them plenty of boiling water, and cover them up. The same may be done to the onions if a strong taste is objected to, but for this dish the onions should only be chopped and added.

Take it out of the pot immediately, wash and scrape it well, and lay it in salt and water until needed. Mince the best part of the lungs and the heart, leaving out all gristly parts; grate the best parts of the liver, and put all in a large basin. Toast well the oatmeal, and add to it the contents of the basin. Chop the suet very finely; add a middling-sized onion very finely chopped up, 2 teaspoonfuls of salt and a teaspoonful of pepper, and a breakfast-cupful of the liquor in which the pluck was boiled to moisten, and mix the whole. Now take up the stomach-bag; keep the fat or smooth side inside, and fill it up, but not quite full; sew up the opening, and put in boiling water to boil gently for 3 hours. Prick the haggis several times with a darning-needle to prevent it from bursting; also put a plate under it to prevent it sticking to the bottom of the pot. Skin the kidneys and mince them very finely; also mince the suet, and put both in a basin with the bread-crumbs; add a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, a very little chopped thyme and grated nutmeg, half a teaspoonful of salt and a quarter teaspoonful of pepper, and mix all well together.

Wash out all the cavities of the heart thoroughly both with hot and cold water, and dry the inside. Mix all the above ingredients together, seasoning nicely, adding and mixing the eggs last. Stuff with this all the cavities. Cut some of the flaps at the top off, and sew together the opening. Put the heart into a sauce-pan of hot water, and boil 1 hour. Afterward cover with a thickly-greased paper, and put in the oven to roast for 1^ hours. Serve with brown sauce. The cavities may all be cut into one and a large opening made. Fowl Trussed and Boiled. Wipe off all the brown particles left when singeing; empty the fowl neatly and carefully, removing only the stomach and windpipe at throat end. Wipe the fowl out with hot and cold water—it is best to do this with a cloth dipped in hot water; dry it thoroughly. If the bird is at all “ high ” it may be rinsed with a little vinegar, afterwards washed with water. D50 HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. To Truss it. Fold back the first point of the wings; take off the legs, and push the thigh bone well up.

Have a pot with 2 quarts of water boiling, into which put the fowl with the breast down, and boil it 1 or 1 b hours, according to age. When boiled, take it up, remove the skewer and string, and pour over it egg sauce, or any other white sauce preferable. A Good Breakfast Dish. 4 lbs. Pork. Onions. 1 Pork Tongue Pepper. Sage. Take a piece of pickled pork, the thin part of the belly, which should be about 8 or 9 inches broad, and rather more than that long; take out the bones and flatten it a little; get a good pork tongue, which, like the pork, has been salted for a few days; sprinkle on the pork a few leaves of sage chopped finely, and a middling-sized onion chopped ; also some pepper. Roll the tongue up in the middle of the pork into a nice roll; bind it outside with a long slip of calico, rolled round neatly and tightly.

Cut the ham in neat, small pieces, and put it on a hot, clean frying-pan to fry lightly. Take up the pieces of ham on a plate to keep hot; put the liver on the pan to fry—about 8 minutes—turning the slices once. The fat left on the pan, after the ham is fried, should be sufficient to fry the liver. Dish it neatly with a small bit of ham on each piece of liver. Put into the frying-pan a small table-spoonful of flour, a little pepper and salt, and stir till it gets mixed with the remains of the fat; pour in a breakfast-cupful of water and a table-spoonful of ketchup, if to be had, and stir over the fire till it boils.

Put nearly a teacupful of water into a pan, and a table-spoonful of ketchup, or a little gravy if to be had; add the mixture of meat and flour, and stir over the fire till it comes to boiling heat, when the flour is cooked; afterwards turn it out on a plate to get cool. This mixture should be made very tasty and nice, and quite a thick paste. Put in a basin a pound of flour, a pinch of salt, and the baking powder; add the dripping broken into pieces the size of a small nut; make it into a stiff paste with water; roll it out lengthways and quite thin; then fold it in three, turn it round, and roll it again lengthways; fold it in three and turn it round, and roll once more. This time roll it in any way most convenient, and about one-eighth of an inch thick. Cut the sheet of paste into pieces 5 inches square; wet the edges of each square and place on each a spoonful of the meat; turn one side of the paste over on the meat, and overlap it with the other side; press the ends down with the back of a knife, and place the sausage rolls on a greased oven plate. Brush them over with beaten egg, and bake about a quarter of an hour in a quick oven. Take a nice rabbit, empty and wash it very well, and, after drying it thoroughly, cut it up into small joints. Have a small stew-pan, and put the butter in it to get quite hot; peel and chop un the onions, and fry Curried Rabbit. 1 Rabbit. 2 Onions. 1 oz. Butter. 1 Apple. Curry Powder.

Dish with a border of boiled rice round it. Rice, to Roil. To boil rice dry and light for curry, or even to use with jam, requires a little care. Wash half a pound of rice well, and put it into boiling water with a little salt. Let it boil for 8 minutes, then drain it; pour some cold water over it, and drain it again. Return it to the sauce-pan; put the lid closely on, and let it steam on a slow fire for a quarter of an hour. It will then be found dry and light. Patna rice is best, and is also cheapest. Tripe and Onions. 3 lbs. Tripe. | 3 Onions. 1 pint Milk. i Flour, Pepper, and Salt. Get the tripe cleaned by the butcher, if possible, but wash it well. Put it on in a sauce-pan covered with cold water, and bring it to the boil. When it just boils, take out the pieces of tripe and put them iu a basin of cold water to wash again ; take each piece out on a table and scrape it well on both sides, and cut it up in pieces about 8 inches square. When well scraped, washed, and cut up, put it on again, covered with cold water, and bring to the boil, and allow it to boil gently for 5 hours. It is absolutely54 HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. necessary to keep it boiling for this length of time to make the tripe tender enough. Now pour off' the water (which can be used to make soup), and replace it with the milk, which bring to the boil. Have the onions parboiled ; chop them up, and add them to the tripe and milk. Put into a small basin a dessert-spoonful of flour, a little pepper and salt, and rub them smooth with a little cold milk ; add the flour, etc., to the sauce-pan containing the tripe, and allow all to boil for a quarter of an hour. Dish up, and serve very hot. Tripe is very nutritious and also very digestible, taking a much shorter time to digest than any other animal food, and is consequently an excellent food for the convalescent. The liquor in which tripe has been boiled makes excellent potato or pea soup. Tripe Stewed. 3 lbs. Tripe. , Flour. 3 Onions. ! Pepper and Salt. If the tripe is preferred brown, put into a stew- pan an ounce of dripping, and make it quite hot; slice the onions, and fry them in the dripping a brown colour; sprinkle in a table-spoonful of flour, and stir till quite mixed and a little brown; now add three-quarters of a pint of water, with peppei and salt, and the pieces of tripe (prepared and cut up exactly as in the preceding recipe), and stew gently for half-an-hour.STEWING AND ROASTING OF MEAT. 55 Tripe, to Clean. If the tripe cannot be got cleaned, empty and wash it thoroughly with cold water; then put it in a pot with cold water, in which there is a good piece of soda; let it get hot, but on no account must it be allowed to boil; then take it out and scrape it white. Let it lie all night in cold water with a little butter milk in it, and next day it will be ready to be cooked. Sea Pie. 1 lb. Meat. 1 Onion. I Carrot. 1 Turnip. i teaspoonful Baking Powder, i lb.

Put the meat, cut in rather small pieces, into a middling-sized stew-pan; cut up the carrot and turnip in small pieces, and sprinkle them over the meat, and also the onion, chopped finely ; then pepper and salt to taste. Pour in water to cover the meat and vege- tables ; set the stew-pan on the fire, and bring to the boil. Put into a basin the flour and suet chopped very finely, and rub them together; add a pinch of salt and half a teaspoonful of baking powder, and mix all well. Make this into a paste with cold water; roll it out into a round cake the size of the stew-pan, and put it neatly upon the top of the meat and vegetables; cover closely with the lid, and let it stew gently for an hour- and-a-lialf. Lift the paste carefully off, dish the meat and vegetables, and place the cake of paste on the top, and serve.HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 56 Cold Meat Rolls. i lb. Cooked Meat. 8 Cooked Potatoes. 1 Onion.

Mash the potatoes smoothly, and add to them a tea- spoonful of butter or dripping melted, then whisk them over the fire to dry. Turn the whole out on the table, and add as much Hour as the potatoes will take up, and roll the potato paste out about a quarter of an inch thick. Cut it into pieces about 6 inches square. Place on each piece a spoonful of the chopped meat; wet the edges, and double the paste over one side above the other, and press the ends down. Place these oblong rolls on a greased tin, and bake till they become a light brown colour, or fry them in hot fat in a frying-pan. Some fine Bread-crumbs. The mutton for this dish should be cut from the back ribs above the loin, and is best not to be too heavy mutton. The same part of lamb may be used instead of mutton. The cutlets should have a bone in each, and the bone should be 5 or 6 inches long. Saw or chop oft the chine bone, that, is the bone at the thick end, as it spoils the shape of the cutlet. Then flatten each with a wetted chopper; afterwards trim them neatly, leaving half an inch of bone bare at the Mutton Cutlets. 1 lb. of Mutton from the ribs. 1 Egg. Pepper and Salt.

Pat each cutlet either with the hand or a knife, to put the bread- crumbs smooth and firmly into it. Now put a table-spoonful of sweet dripping into a frying-pan; when it is quite hot, put in the cutlets and fry a golden colour on each side. Have the potatoes nicely boiled and mashed; make them into a heap in the centre of a dish, and put the cutlets neatly round; some good brown or tomato sauce may be served with the dish. Cold Meat Mince. 1 lb. Cooked Meat. 2 Eggs. Bread. Milk. Onion, Carrot and Turnip. Flour. Ketchup. Pepper and Salt. Take a pound of lean cooked meat and chop it up very finely; soak a thick slice of bread in milk, and press the milk well out when quite soaked; beat it up with a fork, add it to the beef, and mix all well together; add pepper and salt to taste; now beat up one egg, and mix it with the meat and bread. Have a nice deep pudding-dish, butter it well inside, and cut up, in small pieces, a hard-boiled egg. Ornament the bottom and sides of the pudding-dish very neatly with the egg; press the mixture in, and when baked for an hour, turn it out gently. Make a sauce as in recipe for Brown Sauce (page 91); use the bones to make the stock for it.HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 58 VEGETABLES. Vegetables are most valuable food, and can easily sustain life and promote health without the aid of animal food, or (more properly speaking) butcher meat. Vegetable food, however, generally requires the addition of milk, butter, or cheese, which are animal foods. Many vegetables, such as grain, beans, peas, lentils, etc., are highly nitrogenous or flesh-forming; they all contain a large proportion of mineral substances, and many are carbonaceous, or body-warming foods in a high degree ; so that in vegetable diet the wants of the body, under ordinary circumstances, are all supplied. All green vegetables are anti-scorbutic, or blood-purifiers; they help to dissolve other food in the stomach and assist digestion, and, as they contain a great deal of water, are particularly suitable to be used in hot weather. The blood contains a great many mineral substances as well as salts ; and vegetables and water supply some of these necessaries. Wheat contains more of the mineral matter of which the bones are formed than any other food ; and all growing children should have a dietary consisting of bread or food largely composed of flour. When green vegetables, such as cabbage, leeks, etc., are not easily digested, or seem to disagree with the stomach, let them be boiled half the necessary time, the water in which they are being boiled should then be thrown away and replaced with fresh boiling water, and the requisite time completed; by doing this, vegetables will be found to agree with very delicate stomachs. The same process may be advantageously59 VEGETABLES. followed with potatoes that are old and out of season, and will remove the bitter taste and rather injurious juice which their age engenders. Vegetables require sufficient and very careful cooking, their flavour and appearance being easily- spoiled by want of attention. Every country abounds with the vegetables most suited to its climate, and they are so obviously intended for the use of the inhabitants that it is impossible to avoid the inference that they ought to form a very large proportion of our diet. In hot countries extremely watery vegetables and fruits abound, such as melons, pumpkins, etc., for the comfort and pleasure of the inhabitants ; and in our own country, the vegetables that are most abundant are precisely those that are most valuable for our food. Fruits also ought to enter largely into our diet. If ripe, they cannot be too freely partaken of by all, the young especially; and when not quite ripe, subjected to some process of cooking. Green Vegetables, to Boil. 1 Cabbage. Soak the cabbage (after it has been well washed and the withered leaves removed from the outside) in salt and water for an hour. This makes all insects come out and freshens the cabbage. If the cabbage is large and firm, cut the stalk across about 3 inches deep, or rather more, and then cut again in the opposite direction; this opens up the heart of the cabbage and allows the water to penetrate; have a sauce-pan with plenty of boiling water, having in it a table-spoonful60 HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. of salt, and a little carbonate of soda the size of a pea, or a very little sugar; put the cabbage in head downwards, holding it down till it sinks to the bottom; when the water boils again, take the lid off and let it boil the rest of the time with the lid oft' (this preserves the colour), from 20 minutes to half-an-hour. When so tender in the stalk that you can easily put a fork in, it is ready; lift it out on a drainer and press the water well out of it. It may be served with French sauce or plain melted butter. N.B.—A piece of bread, tied in a linen rag and put in the water, prevents the unpleasant smell the boiling of green vegetables causes in a house. To Boil Green Peas. Shell and wash the peas, and put them in boiling water with a little sugar, salt, and a sprig of mint in it; let them boil for about 20 minutes, or perhaps a little longer if the peas are old. Drain them in a cullender, take out the mint, and shake a small bit of butter and a little pepper and salt among them, and serve. Cauliflower, to Boil. Wash carefully, and allow the cauliflower to lie in salted water for an hour at least; then trim the leaves even with the top of the flower, removing the coarser outside leaves altogether. Put it head downwards in plenty of boiling water, salted (just enough salt to taste the water), and a small61 VEGETABLES. pinch of carbonate of soda, or half a teaspoonful of sugar. Let it boil rapidly for about a quarter of an hour, with the lid off the pot to allow the gas to escape from the cooking vegetable. When a fork can be put into one of the outside leaves easily, it is ready. Take it up in a cullender to drain, and send it to table with white sauce or melted butter over it. To Stew Carrots. Scrape the carrots and cut them in nicely-shaped pieces, about an inch long, or in the form of young carrots; put them in a saucepan with as much stock as will cover them, and a teaspoonful of sugar; let them stew gently till tender—about an hour; pile them high in a dish, add a little chopped parsley to the stock, which should be much reduced, and pour it over them, and serve. Turnips, to Boil and Mash. Peel the turnips thickly, taking off all the fibrous skin, and cut them in quarters, or in smaller pieces. Put them in boiling water, with salt, and boil quickly about three-quarters of an hour; drain them dry and mash them well, either with a fork, or rub them through an iron sieve. Return them to a clean sauce-pan with half an ounce of butter, pepper, and salt, and stir till hot and dry; add a little cream, and dish in a pyramid, on a plate.HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 62 Brussels Sprouts. 1 lb. Brussels Sprouts. I Pepper and Salt. 1 oz. Butter. Put the sprouts in plenty of cold water to wash them well. Take each sprout and trim the stalk, cutting off any withered leaves on the outside, and put them in a basin of clean cold water. Have plenty of boiling water (salted), and a small pinch of car- bonate of soda in it; drain the sprouts, and put them in the pot to boil, with the lid off, for about 10 minutes; drain them in a cullender, and return them to the pot with half an ounce of butter and a little pepper and salt. Shake them about in the pot gently to send the butter quite over them ; dish them neatly in a pile on a dish, and serve. Haricot Beans Boiled. \ lb. Beans. 1 dessert-spoonful of Dripping. \ oz. Butter. 1 table-spoonful of Chopped Parsley. Pepper and Salt. Soak the beans in cold water for 24 hours. Put them on to boil in 3 breakfast-cupfuls of cold water, with a dessert-spoonful of dripping in it, or a small piece of any fresh fat. Let them boil about an hour, till the beans are soft, but not broken. Drain them, and add the butter and parsley, pepper and salt, and shake them about in the pan till the butter and parsley are well mixed over them ; then serve. No salt must be used when boiling the beans, as it would make them hard and tough. Melted butter or tomato sauce may be poured over the beans, in which case they make an excellent substitute for meat.VEGETABLES. 63 Spanish Onions Boiled. 1 Onion. I 1 dessert-6poonful of Flour. 1 teacupful of Milk. I Pepper and Salt. Take the outside skin neatly from the onion, and put it in plenty of boiling water (salted) and with half a teaspoonful of sugar, and allow it to boil. An onion weighing 1 lb. requires to boil an hour-and-a-half; weighing f of a lb., 1 hour; | a lb., three-quarters of an hour. Drain the onion from the water, and mix the Hour and milk, salt and pepper, together. Put the mixture in a small pan to boil, stirring it constantly, then pour it over the onion, and serve. Potatoes Boiled. Potatoes are a most valuable article of food, and undoubtedly deserve and require great care in their preparation. The skin is designed and btted to preserve the valuable juices which the potato contains, and that potato is not well cooked which allows those juices to escape. All succulent vegetables possess anti-scorbutic or blood-purifying powers—the potato possesses such properties in a high degree. A potato cooked, keeping the skin entire, will digest much more quickly than if the skin is broken and the juices allowed to dow into the water in the pot; and a potato roasted in its skin is by far the lightest and most digestible way in which to prepare it for an invalid. Potatoes are really best to be boiled in their skins, although there are two exceptions to this rule—one is when the potatoes are unripe, when they just come in ; and the second is when they are old and out of season, in the spring and early summer. In the drst of thoseHOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 64 cases the potato is very watery, being unripe, and is best to have the skin scraped off and put in boiling water and boiled rapidly, as this draws out some of the water and makes the potato better food. In the second case, the potato acquires a bitter taste when it gets old, and is better pared and even soaked for a short time in cold water, before boiling in the usual way. Potatoes, however, should never be soaked longer than 1 or 2 hours, as one of the principal components of the potato is starch, and with soaking in water the starch gradually loosens, comes out into the water, and is lost, as may be seen in the white sediment that remains in the bottom of a basin in which the potatoes have been soaked. A few simple rules may be given now for the boiling of the potatoes :— 1. Select the potatoes all one size, or as nearly as possible. It is impossible to boil small and large potatoes properly together. 2. Barely cover the potatoes with water. 3. Add as much salt as tastes the water. 4. Bring them slowly to the boil. 5. Boil the potatoes slowly; the larger the potatoes are the slower they should be boiled, because the heat takes longer to penetrate to the heart. For very large potatoes a little cold water may be added once or twice, to prolong the boiling. 6. Drain them before the skin cracks in the least, but not quite dry. 7. Allow them to steam 5 or 10 minutes with the lid on, and a few minutes with it off. They may now be quickly peeled and dished up.VEGETABLES. 6 E Potatoes Mashed. The best way to mash potatoes, in a plain way, is to take a strong fork and stir or whisk them with it till they become smooth and light. The longer they are whisked the lighter they become. Add a very little sweet milk, and stir them well; then dish them up very neatly in a heap. When potatoes are pared before boiling, it should be very thinly indeed, as the best part is next the skin; then put into cold water at once, and boil according to the directions given. Leeks, to Boil. 6 Leeks. ^ oz. Butter. ^ oz. Flour. ^ teaspoonful of Sugar. Pepper and Salt. £ pint Milk. 1 slice Toast. Select leeks about the thickness of a finger, and cut them all about the same length, leaving scarcely any of the green part on, and wash them very carefully and trim them neatly. Tie them in a bundle, and put into a small stew-pan, with boiling water and a little salt, to parboil for 5 minutes, when they should be drained and afterwards put into a clean sauce-pan, with enough milk to cover, and the sugar. Let them stew in this till tender, about 20 minutes or more, according to age, and dish them on toast. Thicken the milk with half an ounce of butter and half an ounce of flour kneaded together, which season to taste, and, after allowing it to boil, pour over the leeks. They may be cut in inch-lengths if preferred, and piled high on the toast. E66 HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. Parsnips, to Boil. 4 Parsnips. 1 teaspoonful Flour. 1 teaspoonful Butter. £ teacupful of Milk. Pepper and Salt. Wash the parsnips clean, scraping away the discoloured parts. Have a sauce-pan with plenty of boiling water, and enough salt to taste the water well, into which put the parsnips, and boil them for about three-quarters of an hour, or till tender; then drain them, scrape the skin entirely off, and cut them into slices. Mix the flour and butter together, and put both in a small stew-pan, with the milk, pepper, and salt, and stir till boiling; add the parsnips, and shake over the fire till they are well heated up, and serve very hot. Parsnips, to Mash. 4 Parsnips. i Pepper and Salt. £ oz. Butter. I Vinegar. Wash and boil the parsnips as described above; when sufficiently boiled, scrape clean, and mash up thoroughly with a fork. Put them into a small sauce- pan, with the butter, pepper, salt, and a few drops of vinegar ; stir over the fire till they are quite hot. Dish in a pile, and serve hot. A table-spoonful of tomato improves the parsnips, and may be used instead of vinegar. Red Cabbage, to Pickle. Take a nice, firm red cabbage and wash it well, taking off the coarse outside leaves. Shred the cabbage up finely into very slender slips, and put a layer of67 VEGETABLES. the cabbage on a sieve or basket; sprinkle salt rather plentifully over it, and repeat till the whole is finished. Allow it to remain thus for 2 days, turning it over several times that it may drain; then put it into ajar. Boil a pint of vinegar with a teaspoonful of pepper- corns, a blade of mace, and G cloves, and pour boiling- over the cabbage in the jar; add a few slices of beetroot if convenient, which will improve the colour. Cover up tightly when cold. Wash the beetroots gently, taking care not to break the fibres, as they will bleed and lose their colour. Put them into a sauce-pan, with boiling water tasted with salt, to boil for an hour-and-a-half. Peel and cut them in slices one-eighth inch thick, and put them in ajar. Boil a pint of vinegar with the peppercorns, mace, cloves, ginger, and, when boiled, add to it a pint of cold vinegar. Pour the whole over the beetroots in the jar, and when quite cold cover tightly. Beetroot, to Pickle. 6 Beetroots. 2 pints Vinegar. \ oz. Ginger. J oz. Peppercorns. 1 blade Mace. 1 doz. Cloves.HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 68 * PUDDINGS. The most important article that enters into the com- position of puddings is milk. It is a perfect food, and contains all the substances necessary to sustain life, and in the young of animals does sustain life for a lengthened period. It is converted into solid food in the stomach on the same principle by which milk is converted into cheese. The gastric juices in the stomach separate the milk, so that there is a solid part like curd, and a liquid like whey. Two cupfuls of new milk contain as much nourishment as- a mutton chop, and the same quantity of milk makes an ounce of cheese; so that an ounce of cheese contains as much nourishment or nitrogenous food as a mutton chop. This gives an idea of the value of milk as food. The cream of the milk is carbonaceous, and milk itself contains a large proportion of mineral food. Eggs are much used in the composition of pud- dings, and it is desirable that their value be well understood. They are very nutritious, and contain a great deal of nitrogenous food in a remarkably concentrated form. A hen’s egg of average size weighs If ounces, and contains water, albumen, fat, oil, and mineral matter. It is said that 18 eggs contain as much flesh-forming substance and other nutrients as would suffice for an adult man for a day, and it would be necessary to consume 70 lbs. of fruit, such as a pear, to provide the same amount of albumen or nitrogenous food. This very strikingly shows the concentrated nourishment69 PUDDINGS. to be found in an egg. Eggs contain as much heat- giving and flesh-forming substance as an equal weight of butcher meat. Puddings composed principally of milk and eggs should be very gently cooked, as a very strong heat will cause them to curdle. Puddings with suet should be well cooked, as suet takes a long time to combine with the other materials of which puddings are composed. Rice makes excellent puddings, and although in itself not nitrogenous food, yet, combined with milk and eggs, is sufficiently nourishing, and very light. Rice is prin- cipally composed of starch, and is carbonaceous; on that account it is excellent for the young and old, who require food that is warming and easily digested. Macaroni is a composition of wheaten flour made into a kind of paste. There are many varieties of this, which go under the name of Italian Pastes. Macaroni is the cheapest and most useful article which can be used for puddings. It is nitrogenous, because it is made of wheat, and on that account is much more strengthening than rice. The nitrogenous principle in wheat is called gluten. Combined with cheese, macaroni is particularly good, and in that form is much used in foreign countries, and it is well worthy of being more extensively used in this country than it has formerly been. Semolina resembles ground rice in its grain, but is of a yellow colour, and is a portion of wheat which is not finely ground. It makes very good puddings, and can be used in any form in which rice is used, and is much more strengthening. Corn Flour is almost wholly starch, and on that ac- count is fattening and warming, but not strengthening.70 HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. It is not sufficiently nitrogenous to be the constant food of infants, as it does not develop the muscles and flesh sufficiently. Boiled or baked flour is much better food for infants than corn flour. Puddings are much lighter steamed than boiled. Steaming means that a very little water is put into a pot or pan, having a close lid. When the water boils, the pudding is put in, and it cooks in the steam. There should only be enough water to keep steam in the pot; but care must be taken that it does not all evaporate, and the pudding as well as the pot get burned. Boiling means that a pudding is covered with either a cloth or lid, and plunged overhead in boiling water, and cooked so for the necessary time. This generally makes a pudding heavier and less digestible. A lid is particularly to be avoided, as it so hermetically seals the pudding that none of the gas engendered by the cooking escapes, and it cannot be either so light or wholesome. Puddings with suet, much butter, or fat of any kind, are greatly improved by having a sauce served with them; as cold milk or cream is liable to congeal the fat and render it unpleasant. A few recipes for Pudding Sauces will be given in their place. Bread 2 thick slices of Bread. 2 table-spoonfuls of Marma- lade. Pudding. 1 breakfast-cupful of Milk. 2 Eggs. 1 table-spoonful of Sugar. Cut the crust from the bread, and break the soft part into a basin. Boil the milk and pour it over the bread. Cover the basin with a plate, and stand it71 PUDDINGS. aside for ten minutes. Then with a fork whisk it up till it forms a pulp. Beat up the eggs, and stir them in, mixing well; to which add a table-spoon- ful of marmalade, and mix all together. Butter a basin or plain mould, and spread a table-spoonful of marmalade over the bottom of it. Pour in the pudding and cover it with a buttered paper; then steam for an hour. Turn it out on a plate and allow the marmalade to pour round it like sauce. Raisins may be mixed with the pudding instead of marmalade, and the mould ornamented with raisins instead of having the marmalade in the bottom. Scrap Bread Pudding. \ lb. scraps ofBread. 1 table-spoonful chopped Suet or Dripping. 1 handful Currants or Raisins. 1 table-spoonful of Sugar. \ teaspoonful of Ground Ginger. 1 teacupful of Milk. 1 Egg. Keep all scraps of bread that are clean, and neatly cut from them all the brown crust. Put the bread into a basin of water to soak for an hour. Less time is required if the bread is not very hard. Have very clean hands, and after squeezing the water entirely out, put the bread in a dry basin, and add to it the sugar, the dripping or suet, and the fruit. Boil the milk, and pour it over the bread, etc., in the basin, and whisk it well up with a fork. Beat up the egg and add it, also the ground ginger. Butter a basin, into which put the pudding, and allow it to steam for hours. Serve with sweet sauce.72 HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. Plum Pudding. t lb. Bread-crumbs. ^ lb. Flour. ^ lb. Suet. ^ lb. Sugar. £ lb.

Orange Peel. 1 Lemon. 1 salt-spoonful of Salt. 1 Apple or 1 Carrot. 2 Eggs. \ pint Milk. 2 teaspoonfuls Mixed Spice. \ teaspoonful Nutmeg. £ teaspoonful Baking Powder. For this pudding the currants ought to be washed and dried, the raisins stoned, and the orange-peel cut up in small pieces; grate the lemon rind, and squeeze out the juice. If an apple is used, it must be peeled and chopped finely, and if a carrot, the red part of it grated. Put into a basin all the dry ingredients, including the apple, the lemon rind and juice, and mix them all together. Beat the eggs well, add to them the milk, and pour both among the ingredients in the basin, mixing thoroughly. Butter a pudding basin or mould and pour the pudding in; cover it with a piece of buttered paper, and steam for 4 hours. Serve hot with either custard or sweet melted butter sauce. Rothesay Pudding. I lb. Flour. ^ lb. Bread-crumbs. £ lb. Suet chopped. 1 teacupful of Raspberry Jam. 1 teacupful of Milk. 1 dessert-spoonful of Sugar. 1 Egg. ^ teaspoonful Carbonate of Soda. \ teaspoonful of Vinegar. Mix in a basin the flour, bread-crumbs, sugar, and suet. Stir in the jam and mix well; beat up the egg and add the milk to it, and mix it also into the pudding. Wet the carbonate of soda with a very little vinegar, just enough to moisten it, and stir it73 PUDDINGS. thoroughly through the other ingredients. Pour all into a buttered shape. Cover with a buttered paper and steam for 2 hours. Serve hot with swreet sauce. This pudding is good with either white or red gooseberry jam.

Wash and dry the currants, and chop up the suet very finely. Put into a basin all the dry ingredients—the bread Hour, sugar, currants, suet, salt, ginger, carbonate of soda, and cream of tartar—and mix them well, after which add the treacle, stirring it about. Beat up the egg and mix it with a teacupful of water; pour this in and mix all well together. It should be quite moist without being at all sloppy. Put it into a shape or basin well rubbed with dripping or butter, and cover with a buttered paper. Place it in a pot in which there is half an inch of boiling water. Put the lid closely on the pot and steam for 2| hours; then turn out and serve with sweet sauce. N.B.—If more water is required to moisten the pudding properly, it must be added, but it is best not to put more among the egg, in case it should not be required.74 HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. Bread and Jam Pudding. Bread. § pint Milk. Jam. Sugar. 2 Eggs. Have a plain round tin or basin that will hold a pint and a half (three breakfast-cupfuls), and grease it well inside with sweet dripping or butter. Take some very thin slices of bread, and spread them with jam; then cut them up in slips about 1 inch wide and 3 long. Place them lightly in the mould, filling it very nearly full. Now beat up 2 eggs well, to which add a table-spoonful of sugar and the milk, and after mixing all well together, pour into the mould. Allow it to stand for half-an-hour to soak; then cover the mould with a greased paper and place it in a sauce-pan with boiling water (the water must reach only half-way up the mould); steam for an hour and turn out. The pudding must steam very slowly, or the eggs will curdle, which would spoil the pudding. Marmalade may be substituted instead of jam in this pudding, and the bread may be buttered before the jam is put on if a richer pudding is desired.

This pudding, having no egg, is suitable when the eggs are objected to, or in winter, when they are very expensive. Urney Pudding. 2 Eggs. Flour. Butter. Sugar. Jam. Carbonate of Soda. Take 2 eggs, with their weight in butter and flour, and the weight of 1 egg in sugar. Put the butter and sugar in a basin, and beat them to a cream ; add the eggs and beat smooth ; then add the flour, in which should be mixed half a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda.

Have a plain mould well buttered, and ornamented with cherries or raisins; pour the pudding in, cover it with buttered paper, and steam for ar hour ; then turn out gently. Ground rice is made into a pudding in precisely the same way and in the same proportions. Almond flavour- ing is good with rice, or a bay leaf boiled with the milk Rice Pudding. 1 tea-cupful of Whole Rice. 1 table-spoonful of Marmalade. 2 breakfast-cupfuls of Milk. 2 Eggs. 1 table-spoonful of Sugar. Wash the rice well, and put it on to boil in a small pan with a breakfast-cupful of water. Let it boil for 5 minutes; then pour in the milk, and allow it to boil for half-an-hour without stirring it. Take the pan from the fire and add the sugar and the marmalade, and stir well. Beat up the eggs, and add them last, mixing all together; then pour into a pudding dish, and bake in the oven or in front of the fire for half-an-hour.

Pour the milk over, and put it in a slow oven for 1| hours; or cover the basin with a buttered paper, and place it in a sauce-pan with a little water, and steam for an hour. This pudding cooks anywhere near the fire where the rice can get gradually heated and cooked. Skimmed milk does very well, as the suet supplies the want of fat both in the rice and the milk, and makes a very rich and good pudding at a small cost. The currants may be omitted. 1 teaspoonfnl of Sugar. Put the flour into a basin along with the suet chopped very finely, to which add the salt, sugar, and baking powder, and mix all well together. Now add as much of either butter milk or water as will make a stiff paste, gathering up all the flour in the basin. Turn it out on the board, and roll it into a thin sheet. Take a bowl or plain shape (a melon shape is best) and rub it well inside with dripping. Take as much of the paste as will line the shape, and fit it nicely all round, cutting the edges even. Now put a spoonful of jam in the bottom of the shape, and cover it with a piece of the paste; repeat this operation till the dish is full, leaving a piece of paste last, which wet round the edges a little to make it adhere. Cover the top with a buttered paper, and put the shape into a pot with half-an-inch of boiling water in it; put the Roly-Poly Pudding. 1 breakfast-cupful of Flour. \ lb. of Suet finely chopped. | teaspoonful of Salt. | teaspoonful Baking Powder. \ lb. of Jam.

Sago Pudding. 1 lb. of Sago. 2 breakfast-cupfuls of Milk. 1 table-spoonful of Sugar. 2 Eggs. 1 teaspoonful of Butter. Ground Cinnamon. Wash the sago and pour off the water; then soak it in a teacupful of warm water for 10 minutes. Put on 2 breakfast-cupfuls of skimmed milk to boil; when it boils, stir in the sago and boil for 5 minutes, stirring constantly, by which time the sago will be cooked enough and quite clear; take the pan from the tire, and stir in the sugar and butter. Now beat up the eggs and add them, mixing well, and pour the whole into a pudding-dish; sprinkle a little ground cinnamon over it, and put it on a toaster in front of the fire to brown on the top and cook ; turn it round once or twice to cook evenly, or put it in an oven for half-an-hour.

Put into a basin the flour, salt, baking powder, and mix them well. Beat up the eggs, and add the milk to them, mixing thoroughly ; then pour all gradually into the flour, stirring constantly, to prevent the flour going into lumps. When this is well mixed, pour the pudding into a well-greased flat tin, and bake for half-an-hour. This pudding should have the tin greased with the dripping from roasted mutton, and is often baked under the meat while roasting. Batter and Fruit Pudding. 1 lb Apples. 6 oz.

Put into a basin the corn flour, and wet it with a little cold milk; then add the sugar and essence. Put on the 2 cupfuls of milk to boil in a nice clean pan, and when it boils stir in the corn flour, and stir constantly and rapidly for 3 minutes; then wet a shape in cold water, and pour the corn flour in, and turn out when cold on a plate. A bay leaf boiled in the milk, and picked out before the corn flour is put in, flavours this very nicely and very cheaply. Fruit Tart 2 lbs. Fruit. \ lb. Sugar. Ginger. \ lb. Flour. 3 oz. Butter.

If the tart is to be made of rhubarb, it should be well washed (not skinned) and cut up in inch-lengths, packed tightly into the dish, the sugar sprinkled among it, also half a teaspoonful of ground ginger. If made of gooseberries, they should be picked clean, washed, and put in the dish with a, little cinnamon. If apples are used, they must be peeled and sliced very thinly, sugar sprinkled among them, and a little lemon FHOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 82 peel grated, or half a teaspoonful of ground cinnamon.

Paste.—Put the flour in a basin with a dessert- spoonful of fine soft sugar, half a teaspoonful of baking powder, 3 oz. of butter, and crumble the latter among the flour until all lumps have disappeared; then pour in enough cold water to make a stiff* paste ; turn it out on a board, and roll it a little larger than the size of the dish ; after wetting it, cut off' a band of paste to put round the edge of the dish; wet the band again and place the remainder of the paste on. Press it down very lightly, to make the edges adhere; pare and notch them neatly according to taste; brush the top with cold water, and dust fine sugar over; then put it in the oven to bake for an hour. When a fruit tart begins to boil out at the side, it is usually ready. h lb. of Flour. Have a pudding-bowl that will hold pints, and rub it inside with butter. Make the flour, suet chopped, salt, baking powder, and a teaspoonfu] of sugar up into a paste with either sweet or butter milk, which roll out rather thinly, and line the basin as described in recipe for “ Boiled Meat Pudding ” (page 41). Pare and cut up the apples, also wash and dry the currants. Put a few apples in the bottom of the basin, then a little sugar, a few currants, and a little of the Boiled Apple Pudding. 1| lbs. of Apples.

N,B.—Water may be used instead of milk to make the paste. Pare G good-sized and firm apples, and take the cores out with an old penknife, so as not to break the apple. Put in a basin ^ lb. flour, lb. suet chopped very finely, a teaspoonful baking powder, and | teaspoonful of salt, which mix thoroughly, rubbing out any lumps in the suet with the fingers. Mix into a paste with cold water, and divide it into 6 equal-sized pieces; then take one of the pieces and make it round like an apple, flatten it in your hand, put the apple on the top of it, and fill the core with sugar till the hole is quite full; now work the paste up over and round the apple, closing it at the top, and leaving no crack or mark where the paste is fastened. Have a small piece of linen cloth dipped in boiling water, with some flour sprinkled on it, into which tie the dumpling pretty tightly, and drop it into boiling- water, to boil for 20 minutes. A square piece of coarse knitting may be used instead of a cloth to boil it in, which will leave the impression of the pattern on the paste. Apple Dumplings Boiled. 6 Apples. \ lb Flour. \ lb. Suet. Baking Powder. Sugar. Salt.84 HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. Apple Dumplings Baked. The same ingredients are required as in the previous recipe, only use 2 oz. of butter or dripping instead of suet, and add a dessert-spoonful of sugar to the paste. Make the paste up as before described, then divide it, and inclose the apples in each piece ; when rolled quite round, brush the top of each over with a little beaten egg or milk, and sprinkle a little sugar over. Place the 6 dumplings on a greased baking-sheet, and bake for half-an-hour. One clove, a little grated lemon rind, or a little nutmeg, may be put with the sugar in the core of each apple, and will give it a nice flavour. Pancakes. I lb. of Flour. 1 Egg. £ pint Milk. Sugar. 1 pinch Salt. Put into a basin a teacupful of flour (which is a quarter of a lb.), and add the salt to it. Beat up the egg well, and add to it a small breakfast- cupful of milk, which is half a pint, and mix them very gradually with the flour, to prevent lumps; and when all is poured in, beat it up for a few minutes. Have a small frying-pan if possible, and melt a piece of butter about the size of a small nut in it; then pour in as much of the mixture as thinly covers the pan, and allow it to cook till it gets firm, which takes a minute or two. Shake the pan, and turn the pancake over to cook the other side ; then turn out on a plate, and after sprinkling the top with sugar, roll it up. Repeat the same process till all the material is finished; and send to table covered up, and very warm.85 PUDDINGS. Sago and Fruit. £ lb. Rhubarb. i \ lb. Sago. 6 oz. Sugar. I 2 teacupfuls of Water.

Stir it occasionally, and pour it into a shape which has been wet with cold water. Turn out when cold, and serve with either syrup, sauce, or milk. Apple and Orange Fritters. Flour. Butter. 2 Eggs. Sugar. Apples. Oranges. Fritters are pieces of fruit or meat dipped in batter and then fried. They may be made of fish, or any slices of cooked meat or tripe, and are an excellent mode of using up cold meat. They are frequently made of fruit, and any kind of fresh fruit does for the purpose. Batter.—Ingredients : 6 oz. of flour, a table-spoonful of melted and clarified butter, dripping, or salad oil, a salt-spoonful of salt, and a tea-cupful of tepid water These ingredients must be rubbed together very smoothly and carefully, and should be a good thick batter, to which add the whites of 2 eggs, beaten up very stiffly, and mix carefully with the batter. Apple Fritters.—Peel the apples, and with a sharp- pointed knife take out the cores and slice the apples across, \ of an inch thick.HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 86 Have a pan with plenty of dripping or lard heated till it begins to smoke; and after dipping the slices of apples into the batter, in order to cover them with it, lift them out into the hot fat, and fry till they become a pale brown colour; then sprinkle sugar over them on a plate, and serve very hot. Orange Fritters.—After taking the skin off, cut the orange in slices across, or divide it into its natural divisions, and dip each piece in the batter; then with a spoon lift them into the hot fat, and fry them a pale brown colour. Fritters should be put on soft paper or a kitchen towel for a few minutes, to drain the fat off, after which sprinkle sugar over them, and serve very hot. Slices of meat, tripe, fish, etc., are cooked in a similar way, only sprinkle salt over them instead of sugar. The same batter may be used. Stewed Prunes. 1 lb common Prunes. I 1 small Lemon, lb.

Put into a pan ^ lb. of sugar, a breakfast-cupful of water, the lemon juice, also the rind of half a lemon thinly pared, and bring all to the boil. Drain off' the water the prunes are soaked in, and put them in the pan, which cover up, and stew gently for an hour at least, but longer if they are very hard; then pick out the pieces of lemon peel and serve.

It should be dry but sufficiently cooked. Make a border of the rice neatly round a dish, and «/ ' place the apples in the centre, pouring the reduced syrup over them. Whip up the whites of 3 eggs till quite stiff' (about 10 minutes), adding a teaspoonful of sugar during the process, and pile this smoothly over rice and apples in the shape of a pyramid.

Break up a quarter of a pound of macaroni into short lengths, and put it in a sauce-pan with enough boiling water, slightly salted, to cover it well, and let it boil slowly for 20 minutes; then drain it and put it on again with the milk to boil till it is tender, but not broken. It will require 20 minutes or half-an-hour. Have the cheese grated (it should be old and rather strong), and mix half of it with the macaroni, a little salt, cayenne pepper, and the mustard , then turn it out on a flat dish, and sprinkle over it the bread and the remainder of the cheese, and place on the top the butter broken in little bits.

Oakes, buns, biscuits, etc., form pleasant adjuncts to the necessaries of the household, and are only of secondary importance to that of bread baking. They are well worthy of attention, as they can be easily and cheaply made at home. Solid cakes, such as seed, pound, and ginger cakes, require a rather hot oven. It is better to protect the cake with a good many folds of paper in the bottom of the pan and a paper cover on the top, than by putting the cake in a slow oven, to allow the fruit to sink to the bottom, and the cake to become heavy. Light sponge cakes, and all light cakes, must have a quiet oven, as well as all large cakes which contain much baking powder. The lighter the cake is, in general the quieter the oven should be. A very light cake put into a quick oven rises rapidly round the sides, but leaves a hollow in the middle. When baking powder is not to be had, a substitute can easily be made by putting in the required quantity of carbonate of soda and some acid to counteract it. Soda alone is never good in a cake where there is butter or dripping-, unless some substance containing acid is along with it. Treacle is one of those substances con- taining acid. The best carbonate of soda is a decided advantage over the common kind. The following tests for trying the temperature of the oven may be found useful:— 1. If a sheet of paper burns when thrown in, the oven is too hot.HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 96 2. When the paper becomes dark brown, it is suitable for pastry. 3. When light brown, it does for pies. 4. When dark yellow, for cakes. 5. When light yellow, for puddings, biscuits, and small pastry. Cakes ought to be baked until they are firm and dry in the middle. It is better to press the fingers on the centre of the cake, and not make an opening with a skewer, until one is pretty sure it is ready. For light cakes the tin may be well greased with dripping and thickly dusted with flour, instead of using paper, but even if paper is used, it ought to be greased and dusted with Hour. Flour is a non- conductor of heat, and protects the cake from burning. Baking Powder. 2 oz. of Carbonate of Soda. | 2 oz. of Rice Flour. 2 oz. of Tartaric Acid. Put all the ingredients in a basin and mix them well • then rub the mixture through a sieve or cullender several times to take out the lumps. Put it into a bottle or jelly-can, and keep for use. Bread. 3 lbs. of Flour. 1 teaspoonful of Salt. 1 oz. German Yeast. 1 teaspoonful of Sugar. Lukewarm Water. Put into a basin 2\ lbs. flour, and sprinkle in round the edges a teaspoonful of salt; gather the flour up to the sides of the basin, leaving a hollow in the middle.CAKES AND BAKING. 97 Put into a smaller basin an ounce of German yeast and a teaspoonful of soft sugar; mix it to a smooth paste with a little lukewarm water as starch is mixed; when quite smooth pour in 2| breakfast-cupfuls of lukewarm water, and mix thoroughly ; now pour all this liquid into the basin of flour, and with a spoon mix it thoroughly. All the flour should be wet, but not in the least sloppy, and it should be the thick- ness of a good paste. It may be necessary to add a little more water; if so, add it carefully. When the whole is mixed well, knead it a little with the hand, and sprinkle a little flour on the top. Cover the basin with a plate, and put it where it will keep at the same heat, to “rise” for 1| hours. Then add a little flour to the dough in the basin to help to gather it from the sides, and, still adding a very little flour, punch and knead it well. When the paste is well gathered into a mass, and not sticking to the basin, turn it out on a table and knead it for 10 minutes, always adding a little flour—at least half a pound of flour will be added during this kneading process. Divide this paste into 4 loaves, which either make up shaped like cottage loaves and put them on a floured oven plate, or make like pan loaves and put them in shapes floured inside. Set the loaves in a warm place to rise for 20 minutes or a quarter of an hour. Then put them into a father quick oven to bake for about half-an-hour. The quantity of water that is required to make bread depends greatly on the flour used. Fine flour requires more water than coarse, and consequently it makes a larger quantity of bread ; but it requires also a little more yeast. The above recipe is for ordinary Hour. GHOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 98 Yeasts of all kinds require a warm temperature to encourage fermentation, or, in other words, to make them “ rise consequently, the secret of making bread light is to have everything connected with it warm during the process of baking. Bake in a warm place, set it to rise in a warm place, and from beginning to end of the process let the bread get no chill. Setting the bread to rise on a kitchen fender is not a good plan at all, as the fire always draws a current of air from the door or window, and consequently must chill the outside of the basin with the dough or the loaves when set to rise. The best way is to set them up near the fire and quite out of the draught. The tempera- ture of the oven for baking bread should be about 2b0- Buns with Yeast. 1 lb.

Mix in a basin the flour, sugar, salt, and currants -. then warm the butter and milk a little, just lukewarm, and mix the yeast smoothly with it; also beat up the eti'cfs and mix them. Pour all into the flour, etc., in the basin, and mix with a spoon till the flour is all wet. More milk may be required, but the flour is to be just wet. When well mixed, set to rise near the fire for half-an-hour, as bread is raised. Then with well- floured hands make the dough up into buns either large or small as required, and place them on a buttered and floured oven tin, and set to rise again09 (JAKES AND BAKING. for 10 minutes near the fire. Then brush the tops over with egg or sugar and water ; dust with sugar, and bake for 10 minutes, less or more according to the size. To make hot cross buns, spices, such as cinnamon, mace, and cloves, may be put into those buns and the currants left out, and a cross may be formed on the top. Lemon essence and peel substituted for raisins and currants will increase the variety of the buns. Gingerbread Cake. \ lb. Flour. £ lb. Butter. £ lb. Treacle. 1 lb. Sugar. £ lb. Raisins. 2 oz.

The cakes should be set 2 inches apart on the pan. Take up a little beaten egg, and brush the tops over. Sprinkle some sugar over, and bake in a quick oven for about half-an-hour. A little of the egg in the cakes may be kept out to brush the tops over. These cakes should be quickly made ind baked to render them light, and may be brushed over with milk instead of egg. Put the flour into a basin with the sugar and IT teaspoonfuls of baking powder, and mix all together. Add the butter, and crumble it down till the whole is ] ike bread-crumbs; also add the orange peel cut in dices about the size of a pea. Beat up 3 eggs in a basin, and add them to the other ingredients, keeping back about a table-spoonful, and mix well. Now add a little butter-milk, but only enough to wet the ingredients in the basin, as the paste must be very stiff; use a spoon, and stir till thoroughly mixed and wet. Grease a flat tin and take a piece of the paste, about the size of an egg; roll it round like a ball and place it on the tin, and repeat till all the paste is used up.

Divide it in 2 pieces. Take 1 piece and roll it out quite thin and round. Cut the edges smooth and even ; then cut in 8, similar to the divisions of a wheel. Have a perfectly clean griddle very warm. Bake about 5 minutes altogether, turning the scones once. If cream can be had instead of the milk, the butter is unnecessary, or only a small bit need be used.SICK-ROOM COOKERY 109 SICK-ROOM COOKERY. Sick nursing is even more essentially women’s work than housekeeping, and requires knowledge, combined with tenderness and care, a feeling heart, and skilful hands. Fresh-air is most essential to a sick-room, as many forms of sickness cause the air to become very impure, and impure air, being lighter than pure, ascends to the roof of the room; therefore let the window be open a little at the top to permit the foul air to escape. A good fire is also necessary in order to keep up the temperature, as well as to induce a current of fresh air. Cleanliness in the arrangement of the room is as essential as fresh air; and in the cooking and serving of food great care ought to be taken that everything is so nicely arranged that the fastidious eye of the invalid may be refreshed and the appetite stimulated. A rustling dress or a heavy foot should never enter a sick room, nor a loud voice be heard. A sick person’s nerves are morbidly acute, and trifling noises that would not be noticed in health cause positive pain to an invalid. The food of the sick should be varied as much as possible, and prepared in the very best manner that the materials will admit of. Beef tea particularly requires skilful preparation, as life and returning health often depend upon it. Nice toast or grated bread may be used with beef tea, as well as other tilings of the same kind.HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 110 It may also be coloured a little brown with either ketchup or Harvey sauce to make it look appetising, as what commends itself to the eye is usually more easily digested than what is taken unwillingly, or is repulsive in appearance; at the same time it should be remembered that the body is nourished not by what is eaten, but by what is digested. Beef Tea—Simple Way. ^ lb. Lean Beef. | Small pinch of Salt. 1^ breakfast-cupfuls of Water. Chop up the beef as finely as possible, and put it into a jelly-can, with the salt and the water, stirring it with a fork for a few minutes. Cover the jelly-can with a paper, and put it into a sauce-pan containing a little boiling water, and put it on the fire to steam for 20 to 30 minutes, with the lid of the pot on; after which strain it through a coarse strainer, or pour it off, holding back the meat with a knife, otherwise the part of the beef tea which is food for the invalid is lost. The very best lean beef should be used for beef tea. Beef Tea—Best Way. | lb. Lean Beef. | Very small pinch of Salt. Water. Chop up the beef very finely, and put it in a large jelly-can, with a small pinch of salt. Mix in a jug equal quantities of boiling and cold water, which produce a temperature slightly over tepid, and pour a breakfast-cupful and a half of it among the beef CoverIll SICK-ROOM COOKERY. the jelly-can with a piece of paper, and set it in a pot with the remainder of the mixed water (it ought to come to the height of water in the jelly-can); then put the lid on the pot and set it near the fire, where it will keep about the same temperature, for an hour, but it must on no account boil. After that strain off all the liquid and set it aside, and put the meat in a small sauce-pan with a large teacupful of water, and allow it to boil for at least a quarter of an hour; strain this also, and add it to what was previously set aside. The beef tea thus obtained may be boiled for use, or merely heated, and contains all the stimulating and nourishing properties of the meat. Veal Jelly. 1 lb. Lean Veal. I Turnip, size of an egg. 1 breakfast-cupful Water. | Pinch of Salt. Slice the veal very thinly, and put in ajar alternately with slices of the turnip cut very thinly, to which add a small pinch of salt, and the water. Cover the jar very tightly with a paper, and put it in a sauce-pan of boiling water coming more than half-way up the jar, and boil continuously for 4 hours ; then strain and use. This is a strong jelly and very nourishing. Turnip is particularly good for chest complaints. Raw Beef Tea. \ lb. Lean Beef. 1 teacupful Cold Water. 1 pinch Salt. Chop up the meat finely, and mix it with the water and salt: mix with a fork, and allow it to stand for a quarter of an hour or longer; then strain it off for use112 HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. There are extraordinary healing properties in the unboiled juices of meat, and in cases of extreme illness this is invaluable. This beef tea may be made palat- able by heating it a little (not boiling), and flavouring with a little ketchup or Harvey sauce. On no account should wine or spirits be used to flavour. Beef Tea Pudding. 1 breakfast-cupful of weak 1 table-spoonful of Bread, Beef Tea. grated. 2 Eggs. ! Salt. Soak the bread crumbs in the beef tea, and allow it to stand a few minutes. Beat up the eggs and add them with a very little salt; then pour all into a small dish, and bake for a quarter of an hour, or steam gently about half-an-hour till it gets firm. This is a very nourishing dish for the sick. Flour for Infants’ Food. To Boil.—Fill a breakfast-cup or small bowl quite full with Hour, using the knuckles to press it down tightly. Tie a cloth over the top and plunge it in a pot of boiling water, and boil continuously for 4 hours. The cloth is then removed, the outside scraped off, and the flour put into a jar for use. To Bake.—Put the flour into a basin in the same manner, and bake in the oven for 4 hours. The brown outside in this case is scraped off, and the flour used in the same way. Baking or boiling the flour prevents it becoming acid on the stomach, and it is more nourishing for infants than corn flour. It should be prepared as corn flour is.SICK-ROOM COOKERY. 113 Milk 1 cleaned Calf s Foot. 1 pint Water. 2 inches Cinnamon Jelly. 1 table-spoonful Sugar. 1 pint Milk. ^ Lemon Rind, thinly pared.

Suet and Milk. 2 breakfast-cupfuls Milk. | 1 table-spoonful Suet, chopped up. Boil the milk and suet together for 10 minutes, and strain; add either a teaspoonful of sugar or a small pinch of salt. This is excellent for a weak chest. Arrowroot. 1 dessert-spoonful Arrowroot. 1 breakfast-cupful Milk or 1 teaspoonful Sugar. Water. Wet the arrowroot in a small basin with a table- spoonful of cold milk. Boil what remains of the milk, and when boiling pour it over the arrowroot, stirring all the time, and sweeten it with the sugar. It then becomes a clear thick jelly. It is equally good made with either milk or water, but for some sicknesses water is preferable. It is made into a small pudding by the addition of 1 well-beaten egg stirred in and baked for a quarter of an hour. Arrowroot is best not to be boiled. Gruel. Put in a small basin a table-spoonful of Scotch oat- meal, and after wetting it with a very little cold water, pour over it a pint of boiling water or milk, stirring all the time; stir for a few minutes, and then allow it to settle 1 minute. Pour carefully into a clean sauce- pan all the liquid, which stir over the fire till it boils. Let it boil for 10 minutes, when it is ready for use. It may be sweetened with honey, sugar, treacle, or may be flavoured with salt or a small piece of butter but should be taken very hot.BEVERAGES. 115 BEVERAGES.

Put the jam in a nice clean sauce-pan with a pint of water, and allow it to simmer for half-an-hour; then strain, and drink it as hot as possible; but if to allay thirst, it is better cold. For a sore throat an additional spoonful of jam should be used.116 HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. Toast and Water. Toast the quarter of a slice of bread till it is quite brown in every part without being in the least burned. Have a jug, with three breakfast-cupfuls of cold water in it, into which put the bread, and allow it to stand for a few hours. Hot water is frequently used instead of cold, but the water is scarcely so clear and nice. In this case it must cool before being used. The water is put in the jug first, and the bread put in, otherwise the bread gets crumbled. It is a most refreshing drink. Barley Water. 2 oz. Barley. I 1 dessert spoonful Sugar. ^ Lemon Rind. I 1 quart Water. Wash the barley well, and put it in a sauce-pan with a quart of cold water; add the rind of half a lemon, very thinly pared off, and boil for half-an-hour; after- wards add the sugar, and strain into a jug to cool. Clear Barley Water. 1 table-spoonful of Barley. i Small bit of Lemon Rind. 3 teacupfuis of Water. | 1 teaspoonful of Sugar. Wash the barley well, and put it in a jug with the lemon rind and sugar; pour over it 3 teacupfuls of boiling water; then cover the jug, and stand to get cold, when it may be poured off for use. The barley in those recipes can be used again, as it is said to be better the second than the first time.117 BEVERAGES. Rice Water. 3 oz. Whole Rice. 1 inch Stick Cinnamon. 1 quart Water. Sugar. Wash the rice well, and put it, with the water and cinnamon, into a sauce-pan to boil for an hour; then strain and put aside to cool, when sugar should be added to taste. This is a valuable remedy in cholera, dysentery, and similar sicknesses, but in those cases no sugar should be used. Apple Water. 3 Apples. I 1 table-spoonful of Sugar. 3 breakfast-cupfuls of Water. | \ Lemon Rind. Pare and cut the apples up in small pieces, and put them into a jug, adding the lemon rind and sugar, pour over all the water, boiling; cover the jug, and stand aside to cool.

Pour in a glassful of the cream, when a froth rises to the top immediately, and makes a delicious drink like lemonade.HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 118 Lemon Whey. 1 Lemon. i 1 breakfast-cupful of Water. 1 breakfast-cupful of Milk. | 1 dessert spoonful of Sugar. Put the milk and water into a sauce-pan with the juice of a lemon, which boil and strain. The whey part is then sweetened with the sugar, and drunk when very hot. This is excellent for a cold, as all wheys are sudorific, or causing perspiration. Treacle Posset. 1 breakfast-cupful Milk. | 1 dessert-spoonful Treacle. Put both in a small pan to boil; when it boils, let it stand to settle a few minutes; then strain. It will have curdled, as in the previous recipe. The whey part is used very hot for a cold. Lemon Syrup. 2 large Lemons. i 1 oz. Citric Acid. 3 lbs. White Sugar. ' 6 breakfast-cupfuls Water. Pare the rind of the lemons very thinly; put it in a very nice sauce-pan with the water and boil gently for a quarter of an hour; then add the juice of the lemons, and boil for a quarter of an hour more with the lid very closely shut. Strain it all through a jelly-bag, and put it back into the pot with the sugar and citric acid, and let it all boil gently for 5 minutes. Allow it to cool, and bottle for use. This syrup is delightful, and will keep for any length of time. It may be used either with water or potash water.119 BEVERAGES. Orange Syrup. 8 Valentia Oranges. 1 oz. Citric Acid. 3| lbs.

Strain it then through a jelly-bag without pressure, and to each breakfast-cupful of juice allow half a pound of white sugar. After boiling for 5 minutes, skim it, and when quite cold, bottle it for use.120 HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. Tea Much has been said and written regarding the uses of tea. Without presuming to discuss its effects upon the system, we may remark that it is certainly possible to abuse the use of tea, as many other blessings are abused. Many men and women, however, tired in brain or body, have gratefully acknowledged the blessings and comfort of “ a cup of tea.” Tea contains a volatile oil, which has a peculiar effect upon the nerves, reviving the body, and driving away drowsi- ness ; while at the same time it has a soothing effect on the heart and circulation, and is thus beneficial in removing nervous headaches. It also contains a peculiar substance called theine, which Liebig says “ plays a part in the nourishment of the body.” It causes perspiration, and weak tea is useful on that account to persons suffering from cold. Tea is nearly always acceptable to invalids, to whom it is extremely refreshing. It can also be used as a means of conveying nourishment when necessary, such as a well-beaten egg in addition to milk or instead of it. To Make Tea Well.—The teapot should be perfectly clean and hot. The water should be soft, as hard water will spoil the best tea. If the kettle boils for any length of time, the water becomes hard, and con- sequently does not make good tea. Have the teapot hot, put in the quantity of tea desired, and immediately the kettle boils infuse it. The time required for infus- ing must be judged by the quality of the tea. It sometimes requires 10 minutes, sometimes only 5 to make it good. On no account should it boil or infuse a long time, as in that case it is no better than stewed121 BEVERAGES. tea leaves. The quantity of tea used must be judged also by the quality of the tea and the strength required. The traditional teaspoonful to each person and one over for the teapot is a very fair proportion. The abuse of tea consists in taking it too frequently, too strong, and too hot; in all these cases it has a pernicious effect. An excellent mode of using tea, which is becoming common, and is particularly acceptable for invalids, is to make it in the usual way, but not too strong, and to each breakfast-cupful of tea add a very thin slice of a small lemon. Allow it to stand a few minutes; then sweeten and use it. Coffee, Coffee has more nutritive powers than tea, and is to most people not so stimulating. Taken very strong it is a stimulant; but generally it has a sedative effect on the nerves, and is on that account good to take late in the evening. Coffee is best when newly roasted and ground, and cannot be really good unless it is so. Only those who can procure such can secure the proper flavour of coffee. Have a perfectly clean and dry coffee-pot. Make it hot, and put in the coffee in the proportion of 1 table-spoonful to 2 breakfast-cupfuls of boiling water, and allow it to infuse for 10 minutes. Pour out a cupful and pour it quickly back again, and allow it to stand by the fire a minute or two longer; then pour it out for use. The milk ought to be boiled before being put into the coffee, as boiled milk imparts a peculiarly pleasant flavour to the coffee. Coffee shouldHOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 122 never be boiled, only infused, and the best white sugar used, as coarse sugar spoils the flavour. As it is sold frequently mixed with chicory, the adulteration can easily be discovered by putting a little of the mixture in a glass of cold water. If there is chicory, it colours the water red and sinks to the bottom of the glass, whereas pure coffee floats on the top Cocoa. Cocoa is a very nourishing beverage, and very suit- able for those persons of nervous temperament for whom tea or coffee is too stimulating. It is sometimes found to be a little indigestible though nourishing. Put 2 teaspoonfuls of cocoa in a breakfast-cup, and moisten it with a little cold milk or water; then fill up the cup with boiling milk and water in about equal proportions; stir well, and sweeten to taste. Cocoa is very much adulterated, and, indeed, to such an extent, that prepared cocoa is frequently sold at a cheaper rate than the nibs can be procured at. For this reason many persons use cocoa nibs, which must be bruised and boiled for about 3 or 4 hours; then the floating fat removed from the top. It yields a very pleasant and much lighter beverage than the other. o o Water which has been boiled for any length of time should not be used for any kind of food or drink, as long boiling causes the water to lose its gases, and its mineral substances get deposited on the bottom and sides of the kettle, making the water insipid and less nourishing.PRESERVES. 123 PRESERVES. Gooseberry Jam. 4 lbs. Gooseberries. | 4 lbs. Sugar. Pick the stalks and stems from the gooseberries, and wash them well. Put them on in a preserving pan with the sugar, half a pint of currant juice or water, and stir frequently till boiling. Allow them to boil for a quarter of an hour ; then skim and fill the pots. Raspberry, damson, and black currant jams are made in the same way as gooseberry. Gooseberry Jelly. 4 lbs. Gooseberries | \ lb. Red Currants. | Sugar. Wash the gooseberries and currants, and put them in a preserving pan with 4 breakfast-cupfuls of water; bring it to boiling point, and after boiling gently for 5 minutes, pour all into a pointed flannel jelly-bag, and allow it to drain quite dry.

Pour the whole into a pointed flannel jelly-bag to drain till all the juice has run out without pressure. Measure the juice, and to each pint allow 1 lb. of sugar, and add half a pound more. Put this on the fire, and stir frequently till it boils; allow it to boil for 5 minutes, then skim and pot. Three black currant leaves added to this quantity and boiled with the currants at first, give a fine flavour; in that case, leave out the raspberries. The currants may be put in the pan again with a little more water and heated ; then squeezed through a coarse linen cloth, and boiled in the same way with sugar, which makes a secondary kind of jelly. A pint is 2 very small breakfast-cupfuls. Crystallised sugar is best for preserves.PRESERVES. 125 The best way to pot preserves is to have clean pots quite ready ; papers cut the proper size, with the name of the preserve written thereon; and a little common paste made. Have the papers rubbed round with paste, and as each jar is hlled, let the paper be instantly put on, when it may be wiped and stored past. If not instantly covered, then they must stand till quite cold. Strawberry Jam. 4 lbs. Strawberries. | 4 lbs. Sugar. Pick the strawberries nicely, and put some of them in a deep basin; sprinkle sugar pretty thickly over them; then repeat strawberries and sugar till all are used up, and allow them to stand thus for 24 hours. There will be a good deal of liquid in the basin, which pour off into the preserving pan, and bring to boiling point, stirring frequently ; then add the strawberries, and boil for 20 minutes ; after which skim and pot. Some varieties of strawberries do very well to be picked and put on at once with the sugar; in that case, an improvement is to put on with the straw- berries and sugar a cupful of currant or other fruit juice, or even water, to moisten the sugar, as the fruit gets too much broken when all is dry at first.

Then fill the bottles with the syrup. Cork them tightly, and tie the corks over with string. Put them in a sauce-pan with some hay in the bottom to prevent the bottles breaking; fill the sauce- pan with cold water, put on the lid, and put it on the fire till it comes to boiling point; lift off the fire, and stand till the water is nearly cold. See then that the corks are tight; cover them with sealing wax, and put away. These are excellent for use in winter. If they are ready, they will have risen about an inch from the bottom of the bottle. Currants are preserved in the same way, but must not be quite so long on the fire. Orange Marmalade. 4 lbs.

Remove them from the sauce-pan, drain, and put them in a basin. Boil a pound of sugar and a breakfast-cupful of water for a few minutes, and pour it over the peel in the basin, and allow it to stand thus for about a week. Pour the syrup into the sauce-pan and allow it to boil up; put the peel in and let it boil gently till it looks clear, which will be in about a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes. Take it out and spread it on a dish, put a little of the syrup in the hollows, dust some line sugar over, and put it in the sun or a warm place till dry and candied. When dry, put away in a jar.

Preparation.—The family linen must be looked over the day before the washing, and people in Scotland usually prefer Tuesday to be that very important day— first, because it is best to have the washing early in the week, so that it is all finished and put away before Saturday ; second, because it is better to have Monday to look out and mend the clothes, soak, remove stains, etc., and of course that cannot be done if we wash on Monday, as Saturday is too far away, and the clothes would lie too long if soaked on Saturday ; and Sunday, of course, is out of the question. There is a Scotch saying that only lazy wives wash on Saturday. That may or may not be true—as a rule it is not desirable. First, melt some soap, and have it ready. Second, look out all the flannel articles to be washed—worsted stockings, under-garments, etc.; give them all a good shaking to remove dust, and put them by themselves. Then gather together prints that are not fast colours, and put them aside dry; they must not be soaked: then lace, silk, fine sewed work, etc.; put them also aside. We come now to body clothing and hed linen. This class requires some explanation, so that a teacher or housewife may thoroughly understand her business. All garments that have touched the skin at all have some grease on them when they are soiled, because the iHOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 130 pores of the skin are constantly giving out grease and refuse from the body. This is the case with all human beings alike. Now cold water has no effect upon grease whatever—it simply makes the garment blacker—and the object of washing is to make the article clean without injury to the fabric, and with as small a proportion of labour as possible. We must also repeat that rubbing causes the most tear and wear; naturally that is only commonsense, as it is rubbing that wears out anything, so if we must rub linen a great deal we wear it in proportion. We therefore soak body linen and bed linen in hot water, in which we put melted soap and a little wash- ing powder. The water should be quite hot, and to about 2 gallons add 1 large table-spoonful of the melted soap and 1 dessert-spoonful of washing powder. Put in body and bed linen—the finer in one tub, the more soiled in another—and leave them so all night. The clothes ought to soak a few hours at least. Washing powder has the property of extracting grease and dirt, and so saves rubbing and labour. Pocket handkerchiefs are best dealt with separately, unless when very little soiled, in which case they can be soaked with the finer body clothes. When influenza or a bad cold is prevalent in the house, the pocket handkerchiefs used by the patient are full of germs, and must not be put among the linen of the household, or certainly the disease will spread. They should be sprinkled over with plenty of salt, then immersed in cold water, and allowed to lie so for a few hours. Then wash out, and afterwards wash by themselves in the usual way. You will thus remove the germs. The body clothes of the same patient had better beLAUNDRY WORK. 131 put into cold water at the bedroom door with some ot' the best disinfectant among the water, and afterwards washed like the handkerchiefs. Blinds, window-curtains very much soiled, counter- panes, etc.—anything, in fact, that has been exposed to dust or smoke—must be put in plenty of cold water to soak for some hours, for cold water washes off the soot and dust, keeping them hard till they are washed off, whereas hot water turns the dust speedily into mud, and simply soils and discolours the article. Kitchen towels and dusters should be soaked and washed in the different waters previously used for the body and table linen. This is done to use up and save needless waste. A sensible mistress or maid shows her good sense and capacity for her situation by economy in this department as in all others, so as to secure the best results with the least expenditure of time and money. Washing. If possible, 1 or 2 hours ought to be added to the day at the beginning of the washing day, to prevent the wheels of the household machinery getting out of gear before the day is over, and prevent the bread- winners from feeling unnecessary discomfort. First light the boiler fire and fill the boiler; then make and take a cup of tea, which is the best and a necessary refreshment before starting hard work at an early hour. By this time the water is warm. If the day be dry, it is best to wash the flannels first, as they must be dried quickly, and are best dried in the open air.132 HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. To Wash Flannel.—Prepare two tubs, into which put warm or tepid, but not hot, water. Add to this, in the first water, a large table-spoonful of melted soap and a dessert-spoonful of ammonia; but only add the ammonia when you are quite ready to begin to use the water. Into the second tub put less soap, and if the flannels are not dirty, do not add ammonia. Ammonia is an alkali which helps quickly to remove grease and dirt, and does not leave the flannel hard, as it evaporates. Having had your flannel well shaken out, put one article at a time into the first water, and wash it quickly. It must not be rubbed with soap or with the hand, but dumped up and down and moved about under the hands, as rubbing makes the fibres and wool of the flannel go into a hard thick mass and shrink. The only parts that should be rubbed are any cotton bands or button-holes; these may require to be rubbed with soap and with the hands also. When the first washing is finished, put the same garment into the second water, wash quickly, and wring out. A wringer is of great benefit to flannels, as twisting the flannel in the process of wringing has been found to make it shrink. A wringer is, there- fore, a valuable utensil in the laundry. If the flannel be clean and nice, shake out very well, fold and clap, and leave in the fold for 5, but not more than 10, minutes. If not quite clean, put through a third tepid water with scarcely any soap and no ammonia. Repeat this process, putting only one article into the water at a time. Flannels should be hung out in warm sunshine or, at least, on a bright day, and dried very quickly. If133 LAUNDRY WORK. such an atmosphere is not to be had, then hang up near a good tire and dry quickly. It makes flannels thick*and hard to leave them long damp. While the garments are drying, take them down and shake well, if possible between two persons; at all events shake two or three times during the process of drying, and hang up again. If the garment be a knitted one, then pull it into shape backwards and for- wards, here and there, and hang up again, putting the peg in a different place each time. Thus you will keep the flannel soft and woolly, which is as it ought to be. Coloured flannels must be quickly washed in the same way, and if the colour is suitable, a little vinegar may be added to the last warm water, as it fastens and brightens certain colours. Stockings.—All flannel garments and stockings ought to be washed on the right side in the first water, then, in the second, turned outside in and washed again. Stockings may have soap rubbed on heels and toes, otherwise soap should not be rubbed; then wring out across the stocking—that is, roll it up from the toe to the top, and wring so. When turned and washed in the second water, wring, shake out, fold, and clap. New flannels are generally a little more troublesome to wash, and require care, else they are never quite nice. There is a good deal of sulphur used in finishing flannel for the market, and this sulphur makes water so hard that it quite counteracts an ordinary amount of saponine matter in soap. One plan is to soak flannel in cold water, which certainly extracts some of the sulphur, but that plan is very troublesome, and not a very good one for large articles, such as blankets, etc. The best plan is to rubHOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 134 the article over with melted soap—that is, take melted soap in the hand and rub it over the surface of the garment; then make a lather with rather hotter water than for other flannel, plenty of melted soap, and a little washing powder, which, being an alkali, counter- acts the effect of the sulphur; wash the flannel quickly in this (be sure to get the lather to rise), and there will be no more difficulty with the flannel. Finish exactly like other flannels. To Wash Prints.—Prints require great care in washing, or they will lose their colour and look very bad. Prints with fast colours should be washed thus:— Put enough melted soap in warm, but not at all hot, water; have a second water ready with a little melted soap—also warm. There must be no alkali at all. Wash the article quickly in the first water, and then in the second. Then rinse thoroughly, fold, clap, and hang up to dry. Repeat this till all are finished. Prints with doubtful colours are washed the same way in the first two waters. Into the rinsing water put a handful of salt, which helps to fasten the colour. If the water looks dirty in the case of black prints, repeat the rinsing again and again until it looks clean. In blue, green, pink, and red prints put vinegar in the rinsing water, which brightens those colours. If the print is desired stiff, make some hot-water starch, and starch it while wet. Turn the wrong side out, and hang up in the air, but not in the sun, as the sun takes the colour out. Take down before quite dry, sprinkle with water those parts that require damping, fold, and clap ready for ironing. Iron with a hot iron on the right side.LAUNDRY WORK. 135 The linings of body and sleeves of a dress ought to be ironed first, then sleeves and body, and finish with the skirt, which requires a skirt-board to do it well. The skirt-board is put between two tables, and the dress hung over it. To Wash Lace.—Lace requires great care and nicety in washing. In the first place, good lace should on no account be rubbed or even squeezed. It may be laid in a lather of melted soap and warm water, put near the fire^ and allowed to heat, by which means the dirt is extracted—the water being changed now and again ; or, it may be laid on a plate in which is a good deal of soapy water and placed in the sun. The sun extracts the dirt and bleaches the lace. When clean, rinse the same way without rubbing or squeezing. Then put into a little very thin starch, press between the folds of a towel, and proceed to iron. Place the lace on an ironing-table with the wrong side up; put a piece of muslin across it, and go over it once or twice with a cool iron. Then take off the muslin, and, beginning at the right hand side, pick out all the edges and slightly iron the lace. A hot iron will make it too stiff, and a heavy iron will flatten it too much. It ought to be lightly ironed, and the edges and other parts nicely picked out. If you pull it gently from side to side and slightly press it, you can make old lace look quite new again. Tatting may be easily dressed, but it must simply be left in water by the fire until it is clean, and never touched with the hand, or it will be impossible to pick out the loops. When rinsed and starched, fold it in a towel, and proceed to iron it like lace.136 HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. To Wash Crewel Work.—Crewel work, sewed worsted work, and embroidery with silk or coloured wools that have many colours, require the utmost care in washing, else some of the colours will fade and the work be spoiled. Soap contains an alkali which will extract colour, so for these materials we use bran, which has a soapy substance sufficient for the purpose, but no alkali. Have the bran prepared, and enough warm water added for the purpose. Have two basins or tubs with bran water, and a third with clean, cold water. Wash quickly through each water, and, when finished and tightly rung out, fold, clap, and hang up to dry. Do each article all through and then begin another, as allowing it to lie damp an instant loosens the colour. If the piece of work is very dirty, a little melted soap may be added, but it is better not if it can be avoided. Into the rinsing water put a little vinegar if the colours are blue, green, pink, or red. Vinegar restores and brightens those colours. When nearlv O «- dry, proceed at once to iron. Never touch wool work or silk with an iron on the right side. The piece of work may be ironed on the wrong side, and afterwards on the right side, with a „ muslin between the work and the iron. Cretonnes have so many bright colours that they are best washed in the same way, only they should be ironed on the right side. There is enough starch in the bran to render them stiff enough. Paraffin Washing.—This method of washing has been much spoken against, and has a few disadvantages, but it has also many advantages, both to the clothes and in saving labour in families where there is much137 LAUNDRY WORK. work. The only clothes that can be washed in this way are white cotton or linen, as it would spoil the colour of prints. Fill an ordinary boiler rather less than half-full— say about 2 gallons of water; put in a quarter of a pound of a yellow soap cut up into thin shavings, and 1 large table-spoonful of paraffin. Let them boil up. Then shake out the clothes and put them in dry, pushing them down with a stick. When as many are in as can conveniently be covered by the water, let all boil for half-an-hour, pressing the clothes at intervals down with the stick. Take them out into a tub with cold water; wash through this, then through another water; rinse, blue, and finish in the usual way. Put coarser articles into the boiler, to which add more soap and paraffin. The precautions necessary are, that the water in the boiler must be really boiling before the clothes go in; and it must be kept in ebullition, as paraffin is an oil and floats on the top, and will be apt to discolour the clothes. Also, care must be taken when putting it in, for if it gets into the fire it will blaze dangerously. Finally, plenty of water must be used to rinse, so that the smell be removed. Paraffin soap is now made, and serves much the same purpose as a cleansing agent, and of course is not in danger of blazing by contact with the fire ; but it seems to have no other advantage. Washing of White Clothes.—We have already treated on the sorting of the clothes. We now proceed to have them washed. They were to be soaked either since the evening or at all events for some time. Now we add to the soaking water enough hot water out of138 HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. the boiler to make it quite hot. Proceed to wash them out. It will be found very easy, and you had better not use a rubbing or washing board, because that, like all rubbing, wears the fabric. Also, do not rub your hands, but hold the cloth in such a way that cloth rubs on cloth, and not on your bare hands. When this is finished, prepare another water with very little melted soap in it, and pretty warm. Wash the clothes through this, and before boiling give them a good rinse in a tub with plenty of clean, cold water; wring out, and they are ready for the boiler. It is very good and necessary to rinse the clothes (it need only be a rough rinse) before boiling them, because it takes all the dirty water away. If any remains, it is apt to boil into them and discolour them. Repeat this process with the coarser articles, and finally use up the soapy water to soak and wash out kitchen towels and dusters. To Boil White Clothes.—Put about 3 gallons of water in the boiler, and add 2 table-spoonfuls of melted soap and 1 dessert-spoonful of paraffin. Let this all boil up ; put in the finest clothes to fill the boiler, press them down with a stick, and allow them to boil for half-an-hour. The water must be boiling when the clothes go in, and be kept boiling, else the paraffin will stain. This quantity of either paraffin or turpentine is excellent for cleansing—whitening and disinfecting —and does no harm whatever. After the boiling is finished, take them out into cold water, rub out, rinse again in more water, and the clothes are ready to blue. If fine muslins or many small articles are to be boiled, they might with advantage be put in a bag, as they are apt to get torn when being taken from the boiler.LAUNDRY WORK. 139 Starching. There are two different ways of making starch, and it is just a question of convenience and suitability which would be used. One kind is called boiled starch, or boiling-water starch; the other cold-water starch. Now it is only when starch of any kind comes to boiling heat that it has any stiffening property whatever; therefore, in the one case the stiffening property is brought out by the boiling water, in the other case the stiffening property is only brought out by the heat of the iron. So it is plain that a good hot iron serves the purpose of cook- ing the starch, and so bringing out its stiffening properties. It will be quite plain that all articles that are heavy, or that are wanted to be very stiff, or where a very hot iron can be used, are better starched with cold- water starch. In the case of lace, or fine muslin, or sewed muslin, or any article that should be flexible and not very stiff, a hot iron would not do at all, and so the starch would not be cooked, but would have a floury appearance, because the starch granules would not be cooked. For much the same reason articles starched with cold-water starch must not be allowed to dry, as of course a hot iron could not cook or stiffen dry starch; it requires moisture as well as heat. Then fine, thin goods had better have hot-water starch, and firm goods, that require to be very stiff, cold water. Cold-water starch may be made any stiffness to suit the article.HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 140 A good way to make this starch for ordinary purposes is to put 2 teacupfuls of water and 1 tea- spoonful of borax to each table-spoonful of starch. Mix all thoroughly and use. If too stiff for the purpose required, add a little more water to reduce it. The following will be found an excellent recipe for cold-water starch for collars, shirts, etc.:— 3 table-spoonfuls Starch. 1 large teacupful Cold Water. 1 teaspoonful B' rax. 1 teaspoonful Melted White Curd Soap. 1 dessert-spoonful Turpentine. Scrape down a little white curd soap, put it in a small, clean jar, and add as much water as will cover it. Put the jar near the fire, or in a sauce-pan with a little boiling water, and leave near the fire till the soap is melted. It may be kept in this jar, covered over, for future use. Now put the starch in a basin, add to it the cold water, and mix with a spoon till quite smooth. It requires to be well stirred, as not the smallest lump must remain. Then put into the teacup the borax and melted soap, and mix with them rather more than half-a-teacupful of boiling water; mix this thoroughly and add to the contents of the basin. Lastly add the turpentine, and mix. This starch is excellent, and just the proper stiffness for shirts, collars, and cuffs. Care must be taken, however, to measure the different ingredients very carefully, else it will not come right. Also remember that the article that is starched with this starch must be wet. If the article were dry, it would be much too stiff.141 LAUNDRY WORK. Cold-water Starch is often made by soaking the starch in cold water several davs before it is to be t/ used. It may be made thus :— Take any quantity of starch you wish, and put it in a jar sufficiently large. Cover it with plenty of cold water, and leave it for several days, or even a week or two. It ought to be covered carefully, both with cloth and lid, to exclude all dust. When the starch is to be used, pour off all the water that may be on the top, and take of the starch 1 table-spoonful; put this in a basin and add to it 1 breakfast-cupful of cold water, and throughly mix them; dissolve 1 teaspoonful of borax and 1 teaspoon- ful of turpentine in a quarter-teacupful of boiling water; add this to the contents of the basin, and use. The advantage of thus soaking the starch before- hand is this, that it gives it plenty of time to dissolve, and so becomes very smooth and nice. What starch remains in the jar should have plenty more cold water poured on, and be left till again required, and used in the same way. Starch is often old, or long kept and dry, and is therefore difficult to dissolve. Care must always be taken to dissolve it thoroughly. To Starch a Shirt.—Turn the right side out, then gather up the breast and collar neatly in the left hand, dip it in clean cold water, and wring it out. This is to make the part to be starched wet, as the rest of the shirt must be dry, else it would not iron at once. Do the same to the cuffs. Then dip breast and collar in the starch, and give a little rub with the right hand to make the starch go well into it, and then wring out. Next do the very same to the cuffs.142 HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. Afterwards give a little dry rub to the breast and cuffs, or else take a bit of muslin damped and rub over, in case of rough starch remaining. Wring dry in a towel; fold the shirt up, doubling the breast and spreading out the cuffs, and roll tightly up for a few minutes, when it is ready for ironing. If one has a number of shirts, just do them all over, and then begin to iron the first one. All other articles with which cold-water starch is used must be done practically in the same way, and ironed before they can get dry. If such articles cannot be ironed quite at once, then roll them all up in a wet towel to keep them damp, but they are best ironed at once. To Iron a Shirt.—Take it out of the fold, and iron the back of the sleeve first, then the front, nicely; then the cuff; gloss the cuff and curl it round ; do the same to the other sleeve. Now iron the shoulder, taking care not to touch the breast or collar. Next iron the collar. Iron it well, and make it quite dry, now double the back from the button on the collar to the middle of the shirt; iron first one side, then the other; then spread out the shirt on the table, front jppermost, and iron all the unstarched parts. Put in the shirt-board under the starched breast of the shirt, and iron the upper side first. The iron must be hot and clean. It is best to iron from the front of the breast towards the sides, and the iron must be brought neatly round the edge at the collar; then iron the under side in the same way.INDEX Beverages— page Apple Water, . . . 117 Barley Water, . . . 11(5 ,, Clear, . .11(5 Black Currant Jam Water, . 115 Boston Cream, . . . 117 Cocoa, 122 Coffee, 121 Lemonade, .... 115 „ without Lemon, 115 Lemon Syrup, . . . 118 Lemon Whey, . . . 118 Orange Syrup, . . . 119 Raspberry Syrup,. . . 119 „ Vinegar, . . 119 Rice Water, , 117 Strawberry Syrup, . . 119 Tea 120 Toast and Water, . . 116 Treacle Posset, . . . 118 Cakes and Baking— Baking Powder, ... 96 Bread, 96 Buns with Yeast,. . . 98 Cream Scones, . . .108 Currant Cake, . . . 104 German Sponge Cake.. . 100 Ginger Biscuits, . . .100 Gingerbread Cake, . . 99 Good Plum Cake, . . 101 London Buns, . . .106 Oatmeal Biscuits, . . 107 Rock Cakes, . . . .105 Seed Cake 100 Shortbread, .... 107 Soda Scones, . . .108 ,, Cake, .... 103 Sultana ,, . . . . 102 Tea Cakes 105 „ _ Light, . . . 103 Victoria Biscuits.. . .101 White Cake, . . .102 Fish- Haddock or Cod, Boiled, . 27 ,s Baked, ... 27 Herrings, Baked,. . .30 ,, Fried, . . .30 Salmon, to Boil, . . .31 Salt Fish, to Cook, . . 28 „ Pie, ... 29 To Fry Fish, etc., . . 25 To Stew Fish, ... 28 Meats— PAGE A Good Breakfast Dish, . £0 Beef Steak Pie, ... 43 Boiled Meat Pudding, . . 41 Breast of Veal Stuffed and Rolled, .... 39 Cold Meat Mince, . . 57 Cold Meat Rolls, ... 56 Curried Rabbit, ... 52 Dutch Stew, .... 37 Fowl Trussed and Boiled, . 49 Haricot Mutton, ... 40 Hough Stewed, ... 45 Irish Stew 46 Kidney Pudding,... 48 Liver and Bacon,... 51 Mutton Cutlets, ... 56 Mutton Stuffed and Rolled, 38 Ox Kidney Stewed, . . 35 Ox Tail Stewed, ... 34 Rabbit Stewed, ... 35 Roast Bullock’s Heart, . 49 Sausage Rolls, ... 51 Scotch Collop, ... 46 Scotch Haggis, ... 47 Sea Pie, .... 55 Steak and Onions Fried, . 44 ,, Stewed, ... 42 ,, Stuffed and Rolled, . 36 Toad in a Hole, ... 47 Tripe and Onions, . . 551 „ Stewed, ... 54 ,, to Clean, ... 55 Miscellaneous— Omelette 128 Porridge, . . . .128 Preserves— Apple Jelly. .

159 Tlio RoxhurgJie Club Dinners. Marquess of Blandford, Lord Althorp, Lord Morpeth, Lord Gower, Sir Mark Sykes, Sir Egerton Brydgea, Mr. (afterwards Bai-on) Bolland, Mr. Dent, the Eev. T. C. Heber, Eev. Eob. Holwell Carr, Sir Walter Scott, &c. &c.; Dr. Dibdin, secretary. The avowed object of the club was the reprinting of rare and neglected pieces of ancient literature; aud, at one of the early meetings, “ it was proposed and concluded for each member of the club to reprint a scarce piece of ancient lore, to be given to the members, one copy being on veUum for the chairman, and only as many copies as members.” It may, however, be questioned whether “the dinners” of the club were not more important than the literature. They were given at the St. Alban’s, at Grillion’s, at the Clarendon, and the Albion, taverns; the Amphytrions evincing as rech&i'che taste in the carte, as the club did in their vellum reprints. Of these entertainments some curious details have been recorded by the late Mr. Joseph Haslewood, one of the members, in a MS. en- titled, “ Eoxbm-ghe Eevels; or, an Account of the Annual Dis- play, culinary and, festivous, interspersed incidentally with Mat- ters of Moment or Merriment.” This MS. was, in 1833, pur- chased by the Editor of the Athenaeum, and a selection from its rarities was subsequently printed in that journal. Among the memoranda, we find it noted that, at the second dinner, a few taiTied, with Mr. Heber in the chair, until, “ on arriving at home, the click of time bespoke a quarter to four.” Among the early members was the Eev. Mr. Dodd, one of the masters of West- minster School, who, until the year 1818 (when he died), en- livened the club with Eobin-Hood ditties and similar productions. The fourth dinner was given at Grillion’s, when twenty members assembled, under the chairmanship of Sir Mark Masterman Sykes. The bill on this occasion amounted to hll., or 2L 17^. per man; and the twenty “ lions” managed to dispose of drinkables to the extent of about 33/. The “reckoning,” by Grillion’s French waiter, is amusing.* * Dinner du 17 Juin 1815. 20 200 0 (Not legible) .... . 0 14 0 Desser 20 0 Soder . 0 2 0 Deu sorte de Glasse . . 1 4 0 Biere e Ail .... . 0 6 0 Glasse pour 6 . . . . 0 4 0 Por la Lettre . . . . 0 2 0 6 Boutelle de Cliampagne 4 0 0 Pour faire un prune . . 0 6 0 7 Boutelle de harmetago 6 5 0 Pom un fiacre . . . . 0 2 0 1 Boutelle de Hok . . . 0 16 0 4 Boutelle de Port . . 1 6 0 66 6 0 4 Boutelle de Maderre . 2 0 0 Waiters . . 1 14 0 22 Boutelle de Bordeaux 16 8 0 2 Boutelle de Bourgogne 1 12 0 67 0 0

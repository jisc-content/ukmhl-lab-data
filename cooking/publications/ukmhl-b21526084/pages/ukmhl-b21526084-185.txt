The supposed indignity offended the pride of Ralph, who, with great gravity sent back the messenger and his caii'iage with a long expostula- tory letter. Foote was ostentatious and vulgarly fine before his guests. As soon as the cloth was removed from the table, he would ask, “Does anybody drink port?” If the unanimous answer hap- pened to be “ no,” he always called out to the servant in waiting —“ take awaj'^ the ink.” Fontenelle, who lived till within one month of 100, was rarely known to laugh or to cry, and even boasted of his insensibilit}^* One day, a certain hon vivant Abbe came unexpectedly to dine with him. The Abbe was fond of asparagus dressed with butter; for which also Fontenelle had a great but preferred it dressed with oil.

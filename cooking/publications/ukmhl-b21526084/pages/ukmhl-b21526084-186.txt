170 Hints jor the Table. Mr. Pitt’s great recreation, after the fatigue of business, was stealing into the country, entering a clean cottage, where there was a tidy woman and a nicely scoured table; and there he would eat bread and cheese like any ploughman. He detested routs, and always sat down to plain dinners. He never eat before he went to the House of Commons ; but when anything important was to be discussed, he was in the habit of taking a glass of port wine with a teaspoonful of bark in it. Yet Mr. Pitt was a man of princely hospitalit}', and amiable nature, as appears in the following extract from a letter written by the Marquis Wellesley, who was an early, constant, and intimate friend of the illustrious statesman:— In all places, and at all times, bis constant delight was society. There he shone with a degree of calm and steady lustre whicli often astonisheil me more than his most splendid efforts in Paidiament. His manners were perfectly plain, without any affectation; not only was he ■ndthout presumption or arrogance, or any air of authority, but he seemed utterly unconscious of his own superiority, and mucli more disposed to hsten than to talk.

With these quahties, he was the life and soul of his own society: his appearance dispelled all care; his brow was never clouded, even in the severest pubhc trials; and joy, and hope, and confidence, beamed from his countenance in every crisis of difficulty and danger.—Communicated to the Quarterly Review. Lord Byron notes: “ What a wreck is Sheridan! and all from bad pilotage; for no one had ever better gales, though now and then a little squally. Poor dear Sherry! I shall never forget the day he, and Rogers, and Moore, and I passed together; when he talked, and we listened, without one yawn, from six to one in the morning.” One night, Sheridan was found in the street by a watchman, bereft of that “ divine particle of air,” called reason; and fuddled, and bewildered, and almost insensible. He, the watchman, asked, “ Who are you, sir ?”—no answer. “ What’s your name ?”—A hiccup. “ What’s your name ?”—Answer, in a slow, deliberate, and impassive tone, “ Wilberforce !” Byron notes: “ Is not that Sherry all over ?—and, to my mind, excellent. Poor fellow! his very dregs are better than the first sprightly runnings of others.” Ozias Linley, Sheridan’s brother-in-law, one day received a

Uinls for the Table. 4 of that class of hon vivants arrive, and even above eiglity, still in the full enjoyment of degustation, &c. (for example, Talleyrand, Cambaeferes, Lord Sefton, &c,); it tho first of the said epicures, when entering on tlie tenth spring of his extraordinary earecr, lind been placed on an eminence —say the top of Primrose Hill—and had had exhibited before his infantine eyes tho enormous quantity of food his then insignificant person would destroy before he attained his seventy-first year—first, he would believe it must be a delusion; then, secondly, he would inquire where tho money could come from to purchase so much luxurious extravagance ? Imagine, on the top of the above-mentioned hill, a rushlight of a hoy just entering his tenth year, surrounded with the richerche provision and delicacies claimed by his rank and wealth, taking merely the consumption of his daily meals. By closely calculating, he would be surrounded and gazed at by tho following number of quadrupeds, birds, fishes, &c.:—By no loss than 30 oxen, 200 sheep, 100 calves, 200 lambs, 60 pigs; in poultry, 1200 fowls, 300 turkeys, 150 geese, 400 ducklings, 263 pigeons, 1400 partridges, pheasants, and grouse; 600 woodcocks and snipes; 600 wild ducks, widgeon, and teal; 450 plovers, ruffes, and reeves; 800 quails, ortolans, and dotterels, and a few guillemots, and other foreign birds; also, 600 hares and rabbits, 40 deer, 120 guinea fowl, 10 peacocks, and 360 wild fowl. In the w'ay of fish, 120 turbot, 140 salmon, 120 cod, 260 trout, 400 mackerel, 300 whitings, 800 soles and slips, and 400 flounders; 400 red mullet, 200 cels, 150 haddocks, 400 herrings, 5000 smelts, and some 100,000 of those delicious silvery whitebait, besides a few hundred species of fresh-water fishes. In shell-fish, 20 turtles, 30,000 oysters, 1600 lobsters or crabs, 300,000 prawns, shrimps, sardines, and anchovies. In the way of fruit, about 600 lb. of grapes, 3(50 lb. of pine-apples, 600 peaches, 1400 apricots, 240 melons, and some hundred thousand plums, greengages, apples, jjears, and some millions of cherries, strawberries, raspberries, currants, mulberries, and an abundance of other small fruit, viz., walnuts, chestnuts, dry figs, and plums. In vegetables of all kinds, 6475 pounds weight; about 2434j pounds of butter, 684 poimds of cheese, 21,000 eggs, 800 ditto of plovers. Of bread, tons, half a ton of salt and pepper, near 2|^ tons of sugar; and if he had happened to be a biba- cious boy, he could have formed a fortification or moat round the said hill ndth the liquids he would have to partake of to facilitate the digestion of the above-named provisions, which would amount to no less than 'll,673j gallons, which may be taken as below:—49 hogshearls of wine, 136Sj- gallons of beer, 584 gallons of spirits, 342 ditto of liqueur, 2394 ditto of coffee, cocoa, tea,. &c., 304 gallons of milk, 2736 gallons of water—all of which would actually protect him and his anticiuated pro- perty from any young thief or feUow-schoolboy. This calculation has for its basis the medium scale of the regular meals of the day, \yhieh, in sixty years, amounts to no less than 33j tons weight of meat, farinaceous food [ind vegetables, &c.; out of w'hich the above are in detail the pro- bable delicacies that would be selected by an epicure through life. Liebig’s theoet of e'uteitiox. “ Among all the arts known to man,” sai’s Liebig, “ there is none which enjoys a juster appreciation, and the products of ■which are more universally admired, than that which is con- cerned in the preparation of our food.

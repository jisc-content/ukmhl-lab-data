Jlints for the Tahle. 12 nOlIE PKOVEUBS. Here is a string of Home Proverbs worth observance. A bit in the morning is better than nothing all day. Old young and old long. They who would be young when they are old, must be old when they are young. . Good kale is half a meal. liutter is gold in the morning, silver at noon, lead at night. ]de that would live for age, must eat sage in May. After cheese comes nothing. You must drink as much after an egg as after an ox. He that goes to bed thirsty rises healthy. Ol'ten and little eating makes a man fat. Fish must swim thrice. Drink wine and have the gout, drink no wine and have it too. Young men’s knocks, old men feel. Eat at pleasure, drink by measure. Cheese is a peevish elf. It digests all but itself. Drink in the morning staling. Then all the day be sparing. Eat a bit before you drink. Feed sparingly and dupe the physician. Better be meals many than one too many. Fish spoils water, but flesh mends it. Apples, pears, and nuts spoil the voice. Old fish, old oil, and an old friend. Eaw pullet, veal, and fish make the chiu’chyard fat. Of wine the middle, of oil the top, of honey the bottom. If you take away tbe salt, throw the meat to the dogs. Qwi a hu hoira.—Ever drunk ever diy. Bitter to the mouth, sweet to the heart. Dr. Hunter says: “ Instead of drinking three glasses of wine after dinner, drink only two; and if you want more, drink a glass of ale. The saving will bring wine back to its old price.” Rise from table with an appetite, and you will not be in danger ■of sitting down without one. It is a mistaken notion that good cookery is expensive; on the contrary, it is the cheapest. By good cookery, we make the most of everything; by bad cookery, the least.

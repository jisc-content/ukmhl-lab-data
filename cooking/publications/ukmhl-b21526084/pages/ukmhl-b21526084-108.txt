Green peas have been sold here at Christmas at 21. the quart, and asparagus and rhubarb at 16s. tli3 bundle. This relates to the supply of vegetables grown in England. Those of forced growth, from the Continent, are very early; but their flavour is inferior to those grown at home. The foreign green-fruit trade of Covent Garden is ver^-^ exten- sive in pine-apples, melons, cherries, apples, and pears. The cheap West India pine-apple trade dates from 1844, when pines were first cried in the streets “ a penny a slice.” Of the 250,000,000 oranges imported annually into England, comparatively few are sold in Covent Garden. Mr. Cuthill, the gardener, of Camberwell, states the ground under cul- tivation for the supply of the London markets to be about 12,000 acres occupied by vegetables, and about 6000 by fruit-trees. These lie chiefly in Middlesex, Essex, Hertford, and Bedford, north of the Thames, and Kent and SuiTey south; some 36,000 persons are employed on them. From distant counties are sent up the produce of acres of turnip-tops, cabbages, and peas; while himdreds of acres in Cornwall and Devon grow early potatoes, brocoli, peas, &c., which reach London by railway. The quantity of water-cresses annually sold in the principal whole- sale markets of London (above one-third of which are retailed in the streets) is as follows:—Covent Garden, 1,578,000 bunches; Farringdon, 12,960,000; Borough, 180,000; Spitalfields, 180,000; Portinan, 60,000; total, 14,968,000. The amount realized by the sale is 13,9491.—Henry Mayhew’s London Labour. Salads. Persons in health, who feel a craving for salad, may indulge in the enjoyment of it to a great extent with perfect impunity, if not with positive benefit. Oil, when mixed in salad, appears to render the raw vegetables and herbs more digestible. Vinegar likewise promotes the digestion of lettuce, celery, and beet-root.
